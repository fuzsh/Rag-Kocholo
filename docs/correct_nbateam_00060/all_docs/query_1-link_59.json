Both Byrnes and Poppe were given suspended sentences, put on probation for three years, and given the first official bannings from the NBA in what became the precursor to the CCNY point-shaving scandal.[4][5] — 1950\n\n1951 1950–51 On January 17, 1951, Poppe and Manhattan College teammate John Byrnes were both arrested alongside three other men for the purpose of fixing a college basketball game. Both Poppe and Byrnes were given suspended sentences, put on probation for three years, and given the first official bannings from the NBA in what became the precursor to the CCNY point-shaving scandal.[4][6] — 1950\n\n1951 1950–51 In 1951, Levy was effectively removed from his position as a referee in the NBA that he held for three seasons,[7][8] if not outright permanently banned from the NBA entirely, after it was discovered he had arranged the outcome of \"fixing\" six NBA games in 1950 under the discretion of former LIU Brooklyn basketball player Eddie Gard as an accomplice of his.[9] Levy was later sentenced to three years in prison for his work in \"fixing\" those NBA games,[10] though ultimately won an appeal after spending a year in prison due to a technicality.[11] Levy could be considered the first person within the NBA proper to be permanently banned from the NBA in that case following the revelation that he fixed games within the league. — 1951 1950–51 In 1951, Roth, a City College of New York player, was banned permanently for his involvement in the CCNY point-shaving scandal,[12] with him avoiding prison time from it by choosing to join the United States Army as a private for two years.[13][14] — 1951 1950–51 In 1951, Roman, a City College of New York player, was banned permanently for his involvement in the CCNY point-shaving scandal.[15][16] — 1951 1950–51 In 1951, Warner, a City College of New York player, was banned permanently for his involvement in the CCNY point-shaving scandal after being sentenced to six months in prison in Rikers Island due to a previous run-in with the law he had earlier on before the scandal occurred.[17][18] — 1951 1950–51 In 1951, Schaff, a New York University player, was banned permanently for his involvement in the CCNY point-shaving scandal.[9][19] — 1950\n\n1951 1950–51 On February 18, 1951, Gard, a former LIU Brooklyn player and agent to greedy game fixer Salvatore \"Tarto\" Sollazzo at the time of his arrest, was first arrested alongside Sollazzo, Schaff, Warner, Roman, and Roth.[9][20] After originally being given a three year sentence in prison for his involvement with gambling before only serving nine months in the end for helping out in his case, Gard was permanently banned from the NBA and other professional sports leagues for his role in the CCNY point-shaving scandal. — 1951 1950–51 In 1951, Bigos, a LIU Brooklyn player, was banned permanently for his involvement in the CCNY point-shaving scandal.[9][21] — 1951 1950–51 In 1951, Smith, a LIU Brooklyn player, was banned permanently for his involvement in the CCNY point-shaving scandal.[9][22] — 1951 1950–51 On February 20, 1951, White, a LIU Brooklyn player, was arrested alongside LIU Brooklyn teammates Smith and Bigos.[4][23] After originally being given a year-long prison sentence at Rikers Island before only serving eight months and twenty-four days there, White was banned permanently for his involvement in the CCNY point-shaving scandal.[9] He was originally intended to have been selected by the New York Knicks with a territorial pick in the 1951 NBA draft before he was caught in the scandal.[24] — 1951 1950–51 In 1951, Layne, a LIU Brooklyn player, was banned permanently for his involvement in the CCNY point-shaving scandal.[9] — 1951 1950–51 On February 27, 1951, Miller, a LIU Brooklyn player, was

scandal as well.[9][25] — 1951 1950–51 In 1951, Cohen, a City College of New York player, was banned permanently for his involvement in the CCNY point-shaving scandal.[9][26] New York Knicks 1950 1950–51 In 1951, Dambrot, a former City College of New York player, a seventh overall pick of the New York Knicks in the 1950 NBA draft, and a graduate student and dental student at the Columbia University College of Dental Medicine at the time of his arrest, was given a permanent ban from the NBA due to his involvement in the CCNY point-shaving scandal.[9] While he had considered his path to the NBA unlikely at the time due to his decision to get a greater education for dentistry instead, the decision for said banning was still made final all the same for Dambrot.[27] Baltimore Bullets 1950 1950–51 On March 26, 1951, Mager was arrested alongside former City College of New York teammates Cohen and Dambrot despite him playing in the NBA by this point in time.[9] He was later banned permanently as a result of shaving points while playing in college alongside his other teammates that were implicated in that case.[28][29] Mager would technically be considered the first official NBA player to ever be banned properly from the NBA due to his banning occurring while he was playing for the original Baltimore Bullets franchise in the NBA. — 1949\n\n1951 1950–51 On March 30, 1951, Lipman, a LIU Brooklyn player, was arrested under suspicions of match fixing the January 1, 1949 match LIU Brooklyn had against Duquesne University.[30] He was later given a permanent banning in

was brought up in the CCNY point-shaving scandal altogether.[9] Despite later being handed a suspended sentence in that point-shaving scandal, he was still given a permanent banning afterward due to his association at hand in the case.[31] — 1951 1951–52 On July 20, 1951, Feeman was one of four University of Toledo basketball players named under fixer Eli \"Kaye\" Klukofsky after his arrest that day as different players that had dumped games for him either two or three years earlier.[9] Despite having his charges dropped in the end (likely due to Klukofsky having a fatal heart attack before hearing awaiting his trial and hearing his verdict), he would still be permanently banned from the NBA alongside the other players named from Klukofsky due to their relation in the CCNY point-shaving scandal.[32] — 1951 1951–52 On July 20, 1951, McDonald was one of four University of Toledo basketball players named under fixer Eli \"Kaye\" Klukofsky after his arrest that day as different players that had dumped games for him either two or three years earlier.[9] Despite having his charges dropped in the end (likely due to Klukofsky having a fatal heart attack before hearing awaiting his trial and hearing his verdict), he would still be permanently banned from the NBA alongside the other players named from Klukofsky due to their relation in the CCNY point-shaving scandal.[33] — 1951 1951–52 On July 20, 1951, Muzi was one of four University of Toledo basketball players named under fixer Eli \"Kaye\" Klukofsky after his arrest that day as different players that had dumped games for him either two or three years earlier.[9] Despite having his charges dropped in the end (likely due to Klukofsky having a fatal heart attack before hearing awaiting his trial and hearing his verdict), he

one of four University of Toledo basketball players named under fixer Eli \"Kaye\" Klukofsky after his arrest that day as different players that had dumped games for him either two or three years earlier.[9] Despite having his charges dropped in the end (likely due to Klukofsky having a fatal heart attack before hearing awaiting his trial and hearing his verdict), he would still be permanently banned from the NBA alongside the other players named from Klukofsky due to their relation in the CCNY point-shaving scandal.[35] — 1949\n\n1951 1951–52 On July 22, 1951, Goldsmith, a former LIU Brooklyn, National Basketball League (NBL), and American Basketball League (ABL) player,[36] was arrested for his involvement in the CCNY point-shaving scandal, specifically in games revolving around LIU Brooklyn with Eddie Gard and Manhattan College with players John Byrnes and Henry Poppe.[9] Goldsmith was ultimately given a two-and-a-half to four year prison sentence for his primary role in the point shaving scandal, which was the largest sentence given to a player (current at the time or former) involved in that scandal. Despite not playing professionally since 1949 following a brief stint with the Brooklyn Gothams in the original ABL,[37] Goldsmith was still issued a permanent ban from the NBA and other professional sports leagues for what he had done. — 1951 1951–52 On July 24, 1951, Grover alongside four other Bradley University basketball players (current or former at the time) admitted to taking bribes from gamblers to hold down scores in multiple specific games of interest.[4] He was later acquitted in the case alongside three other students from Bradley, but he was still permanently banned from the NBA due to his association with the point-shaving case.[38] — 1951 1951–52 On July 24, 1951, Kelly alongside four other Bradley University basketball players that had since graduated and mostly been drafted by other NBA teams by this time admitted to taking bribes from gamblers to hold down scores in multiple specific games of interest.[4] He was later acquitted in the case alongside three other students from Bradley, but he was still permanently banned from the NBA due to his association with the point-shaving case.[39] Baltimore Bullets 1951 1951–52 On July 24, 1951, only months after being selected as the 21st pick of the 1951 NBA draft by the Baltimore Bullets,[40] Mann alongside four other Bradley University basketball players (current or former at the time) admitted to taking bribes from gamblers to hold down scores in multiple specific games of interest.[4] Originally, Mann was looking at a three year sentence in prison by Judge Saul S. Streit after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor by accepting bribes from gamblers to hold down scores before praise from Assistant District Attorney Vincent A.J. O'Connor led to him getting a suspended sentence instead.[9] Despite the leniency, he was still given a permanent banning from the NBA in relation to the point-shaving scandal.[41] 1951 1951–52 On July 24, 1951, only months after being selected as the #1 pick of the 1951 NBA draft by the Baltimore Bullets,[42] Melchiorre alongside four other Bradley University basketball players (current or former at the time) admitted to taking bribes from gamblers to hold down scores in multiple specific games of interest.[4] Originally, Melchiorre was looking at a three year sentence in prison by Judge Saul S. Streit after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor by accepting bribes from gamblers to hold down scores before praise from Assistant District Attorney Vincent A.J. O'Connor led to him getting a suspended sentence instead.[9] Despite the leniency, he was still given a permanent banning from the NBA in relation to the point-shaving scandal, with Melchiorre being the second ever #1 pick in NBA history to never play a single game in the NBA.[43] Tri-Cities Blackhawks 1951 1951–52 On July 24, 1951, only months after being selected as the 72nd pick of the 1951 NBA draft by the Tri-Cities Blackhawks,[44] Preece alongside four other Bradley University basketball players (current or former at the time) admitted to taking bribes from gamblers to hold down scores in multiple specific games of interest.[4] He was later acquitted in the case alongside three other students from Bradley, but he was still permanently banned from the NBA due to his association with the point-shaving case.[45] — 1951 1951–52 On August 27, 1951, an indictment was filed against Chianakas in relation to taking bribes from gamblers to holding down scores in multiple games of interest.[9] Originally, Chianakas was looking at a three year sentence in prison by Judge Saul S. Streit after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor by accepting bribes from gamblers to hold down scores before praise from Assistant District Attorney Vincent A.J. O'Connor led to him getting a suspended sentence instead. Despite the leniency, he was still given a permanent banning from the NBA in relation to the point-shaving scandal.[46] — 1951 1951–52 Sometime after August 27, 1951, Schlictman's name would be brought up as a player involved with the other Bradley University basketball players involved with the point-shaving scandal that was grouped in with CCNY by this time.[9] However, no charges were ultimately filed against Schlictman and he was considered acquitted alongside three other Bradley teammates of his. Despite his apparently random inclusion in the case, Schlictman was still given a permanent banning from the NBA due to that association with the point-shaving scandal.[47] Boston Celtics 1949\n\n1951 1951–52 On October 20, 1951, over a year after being drafted as the 73rd pick of the 1950 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics (though never officially playing for them[48]), former University of Kentucky players Dale Barnstable, Ralph Beard, and Alex Groza were arrested after admitting they had shaved points while playing in college.[28] Barnstable, Beard, and Groza would each receive suspended sentences, be placed on an indefinite probation period, and be barred from playing professional sports for three years in addition to receiving permanent bans from the NBA.[9] Indianapolis Olympians 1949\n\n1951 1951–52 In 1951, Beard and teammate Alex Groza were banned permanently from the NBA after they admitted that they had shaved points while playing in college.[28] Beard and Groza also received suspended sentences, be placed on indefinite probation periods, and be barred from playing other professional sports for three years in addition to the ban.[9] 1949\n\n1951 1951–52 In 1951, Groza and teammate Ralph Beard were banned permanently from the NBA after they admitted that they had shaved points while playing in college.[28] Groza and Beard also received suspended sentences, be placed on indefinite probation periods, and be barred from playing other professional sports for three years in addition to the ban.[9] — 1951\n\n1952 1951–52 On March 2, 1952, Spivey, a University of Kentucky player, was barred from athletic play in college after previously giving up his eligibility to play for them earlier in the season due to a knee injury and surgery on December 24, 1951, despite not being directly implicated in the CCNY point-shaving scandal (though he was accused of being involved by his fellow Kentucky teammates).[4] Not long after that, he was considered permanently banned from the NBA in relation to his supposed involvement in the CCNY point shaving scandal, with Kentucky subsequently being suspended for their 1952–53 season.[9][49] His case against him originally resulted in perjury before it ultimately resulted in a mistrial and subsequently got dismissed afterward. While being banned from the NBA, the Cincinnati Royals were still interested in acquiring Spivey at the time due to the mistrial results.[50] He then tried to sue the NBA for an unjust blacklisting with $800,000 in damages being sought after,[51] but he would only get $10,000 in a settlement. On February 11, 1968, Spivey would take advantage of NBA loopholes to play in an unofficial game hosted by the Baltimore Bullets that involved players from both the original team from 1944–1954 and the EPBL, the latter of which Spivey played for at one point in time, which became the last basketball game he ever played.[52] — 1950\n\n1952 1951–52 On March 2, 1952, Hirsch, a University of Kentucky player, was permanently banned from both the NBA and minor league baseball from his role as first baseman there after Hirsch and former teammate Jim Line admitted to point shaving while in college and sought to implicate Bill Spivey as well, though Hirsch was never formally charged in the CCNY point-shaving scandal.[53][54] Indianapolis Olympians 1950\n\n1952 1951–52 On March 2, 1952, Line, a former University of Kentucky player and 45th pick of the 1950 NBA draft by the Indianapolis Olympians that never played with the Olympians at the time, was permanently banned from the NBA after Line and former college teammate Walter Hirsch admitted to point shaving while in college and sought to implicate Bill Spivey as well, though Line was ultimately acquitted in his case.[55][56] Fort Wayne Pistons 1952\n\n1954 1953–54 On January 10, 1954, Molinas was banned permanently for betting on his own team while playing in college and the NBA, with there being claims that he was also involved in the CCNY point-shaving scandal during that period of time.[28][9] Years later, Molinas became a key figure in the 1961 NCAA University Division men's basketball gambling scandal as a tamperer to other student-athletes and more college sports games, which banned more student athletes from play at the time than the CCNY point-shaving scandal.[4][57] Name Team(s) Year(s) Season(s) Reason — 1961 1961–62 After being named as one of the players involved with fixed NCAA games according to the testimony of the gamblers involved in the 1961 NCAA University Division men's basketball gambling scandal,[57] Bowler, a La Salle University player, would be permanently banned from collegiate play and the NBA.[60] — 1961 1961–62 After being implicated alongside North Carolina University teammate Doug Moe in late April 1961, Brown was permanently banned from entering the NBA alongside Moe, despite later having his name cleared of any wrongdoing.[61][62] At the time, however, Brown was given a suspended sentence with a lengthy probation period during a New York trial. — 1961 1961–62 After previously going from a captain of the Brooklyn College men's basketball team to later joining a group of fixers and gamblers primarily led by Jack Molinas under the 1961 NCAA University Division men's basketball gambling scandal,[63] Budin was given a permanent ban from the NBA and other similar leagues even though he was primarily a school teacher that was 27 years old when he got caught at the time.[64] Budin would later receive a suspended sentence in New York for his involvement in the gambling scandal. — 1961 1961–62 After being one of the players indicted following the early 1960s arrest of Jack Molinas, Callahan, a former University of South Carolina player, was given a permanent banning from the NBA.[65][66] — 1957\n\n1961 1961–62 After being named as one of the first ever players involved with fixed NCAA games according to the testimony of the gamblers involved in the 1961 NCAA University Division men's basketball gambling scandal,[57] Chrystal, a St. John's University player, was given a permanent ban from the NBA despite not playing basketball since 1957.[67] — 1961 1961–62 Following the arrests of pool shark Aaron Wagman and gambler Joey Hacken, Cross, a University of Connecticut player, was expelled from his university and given a permanent ban from the NBA alongside two of his teammates due to their involvement in the scandal.[58][68] — 1961 1961–62 After being one of the players indicted following the early 1960s arrest of Jack Molinas, Dial, a former University of South Carolina player, was given a permanent banning from the NBA.[69] Philadelphia Warriors 1961 1961–62 After being discovered as one of three players from St. Joseph's University to have shaved points for the team during the 1961 NCAA University Division men's basketball gambling scandal (which subsequently led to their third place finish being stripped away from the NCAA),[70] Egan was permanently banned from the NBA for his involvement in the scandal after being drafted by the Philadelphia Warriors as the 29th pick in 1961.[71] — 1961 1961–62 Despite not taking up an offer made by local dental teacher Edward H.

He said, \"Don’t put him on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don’t bring him to my games. Yeah, it bothers me a lot that you want to promo, broadcast that you’re associating with black people. Do you have to?\", and, \"You can sleep with [black people].
