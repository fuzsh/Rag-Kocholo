        "text": "The 2024 NBA All-Star Weekend is about to begin. Let’s preview tomorrow’s events, the Celebrity Game, and the Rising Stars Challenge.\n\nCelebrity Game\n\nGame info\n\nWhen: Friday, Feb. 16 at 7 p.m. ET at Lucas Oil Stadium\n\nTV: ESPN\n\nWhat is it? A 5-on-5 coed basketball game featuring music and entertainment personalities, athletes in other sports, former NBA players, and current WNBA players.\n\nThe teams will be “coached” by “First Take” host Stephen A. Smith, ESPN’s most well-known journalist, and “First Take” co-host Shannon Sharpe, who is one of the network's NFL analysts.\n\nWho are on the teams?\n\nTeam Shannon\n\nAnuel AA (rapper)\n\nKai Cenat (YouTuber)\n\nConor Daly (NASCAR driver)\n\nWalker Hayes (country singer)\n\nQuincy Isaiah (actor)\n\nJewell Loyd (guard, Seattle Storm)\n\nMicah Parsons (linebacker, Dallas Cowboys)\n\nLilly Singh (YouTuber)\n\nSiR (singer)\n\nDylan Wang (actor)\n\nThe “assistant coach” is Curtis Jackson. You know him best for this song.\n\nTeam Stephen A.\n\nAdam Blackstone (music producer)\n\nNatasha Cloud (guard, Phoenix Mercury)\n\nJennifer Hudson (singer)\n\nTristan Jass (YouTuber)\n\nAJ McLean (singer)\n\nKwame Onwuachi (chef)\n\nMetta World Peace (retired NBA player)\n\nJack Ryan (basketball entertainer)\n\nC.J. Stroud (quarterback, Houston Texans)\n\nGianmarco Tamberi (track athlete)\n\nThe “assistant coaches” are rapper Lil’ Wayne and Las Vegas Aces center A’ja Wilson. We know Wilson’s great at basketball, but since I played 50 Cent’s first big hit, this was Lil’ Wayne’s first hit back in the 20th century. He didn’t get a No. 1 hit until “Lollipop” in 2008!\n\nWhy the shade?\n\nThis game is simply an exhibition. It is not a reflection of how good the players are in basketball. The best basketball players here would be Loyd, Cloud and World Peace. If this game had everyone’s personal money on the line, I guarantee these three will be scoring the lion’s share of the points. But I have never seen a former NBA or current WNBA star singlehandedly win them because ... it’s just for fun and games. So, I expect one of the non-basketball players to win the MVP award.\n\nRising Stars Challenge\n\nGame info\n\nWhen: Friday, Feb. 16 at 9 p.m. ET at Gainbridge Fieldhouse\n\nTV: TNT\n\nWhat is it? A mini tournament of NBA rookies, sophomores and G-League players who are on four seven-man teams. They will play in a single elimination tournament with semifinals having a target score of 40 and the final game having a target score of 25.\n\nThe seven-man G-League team will be coached by former long-time NBA player Detlef Schrempf, who played for the Indiana Pacers from 1989 through 1993, earning an All-Star appearance in 1993. The remaining coaches: former NBA player Pau Gasol; former NBA player and Pacer (1996-2001) Jalen Rose; and former WNBA player and Indiana Fever legend Tamika Catchings drafted the NBA players.\n\nThe good news for us, in the national storylines as Wizards fans, is that rookie guard Bilal Coulibaly will be on the same team as San Antonio Spurs forward Victor Wembanyama on Team Pau!\n\nTeams\n\nTeam Pau\n\nVictor Wembanyama (Rookie, San Antonio Spurs)\n\nBrandon Miller (Rookie, Charlotte Hornets)\n\nBrandin Podziemski (Rookie, Golden State Warriors)\n\nJaime Jaquez. Jr. (Rookie, Miami Heat)\n\nJabari Smith Jr. (Sophomore, Houston Rockets)\n\nCason Wallace (Rookie, Oklahoma City Thunder)\n\nBilal Coulibaly (Rookie, Washington Wizards)\n\nTeam Tamika\n\nPaolo Banchero (Sophomore, Orlando Magic)\n\nJaden Ivey (Sophomore, Detroit Pistons)\n\nJalen Duren (Sophomore, Detroit Pistons)\n\nKeegan Murray (Sophomore, Sacramento Kings)\n\nScoot Henderson (Rookie, Portland Trail Blazers)\n\nKeyonte George (Rookie, Utah Jazz)\n\nDyson Daniels (Sophomore, New Orleans Pelicans) *\n\nVince Williams Jr. (Sophomore, Memphis Grizzlies)\n\n* = Daniels is injured and will not play; replaced by Williams Jr.\n\nTeam Jalen\n\nChet Holmgren (Rookie, Oklahoma City Thunder)\n\nJalen Williams (Sophomore, Oklahoma City Thunder)\n\nBennedict Mathurin (Sophomore, Indiana Pacers)\n\nShaedon Sharpe (Sophomore, Portland Trail Blazers) *\n\nDereck Lively II (Rookie, Dallas Mavericks)\n\nJordan Hawkins (Rookie, New Orleans Pelicans)\n\nWalker Kessler (Sophomore, Utah Jazz)\n\nJeremy Sochan (Sophomore, San Antonio Spurs)\n\n* = Sharpe is injured and will not play; replaced by Sochan\n\nTeam Detlef\n\nIzan Almansa (G League Ignite)\n\nEmoni Bates (Cleveland Charge)\n\nMatas Buzelis (G League Ignite)\n\nRon Holland (G League Ignite)*\n\nMac McClung (Osceola Magic)\n\nTyler Smith (G League Ignite)\n\nOscar Tshiebwe (Indiana Mad Ants)\n\nAlondes Williams (Sioux Falls Skyforce)\n\n* = Holland is injured and will not play; replaced by Bates\n\nLet us know your thoughts on the games in the comments below!
