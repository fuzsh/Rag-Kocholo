        "text": "Former Indiana women's basketball star Grace Berger — currently a member of the WNBA's Indiana Fever — put smiles on the faces of several children on Valentine's Day this year. The Hoosiers legend joined Metta World Peace (formerly known as Ron Artest), Fred Jones and others at Peyton Manning Children's Hospital for a special day.\n\nThe Fever teamed up with NBA Cares to visit patients at the children's hospital on Wednesday. Berger was part of the group, joining Metta World Peace, Jones and Jerome Williams for the event.\n\nVideo captured Berger and others making special Valentine's Day crafts, handing out flowers and spending time with children. It was a really awesome initiative from the Fever and NBA Cares.\n\nIt was also a great way for some of the sport's biggest stars to give back to the Indianapolis community during NBA All-Star Week — also being held in Indy.\n\n\"Just to get to see their smiling faces, get to make their day, it's been really fun,\" Berger said.\n\nBerger just completed her rookie season with the Fever in 2023. She played in 36 games, averaging 14.2 minutes. She posted 4.2 points, 1.9 assists and 1.6 rebounds per game.\n\nThe Fever selected Berger with the No. 7 pick in last year's WNBA Draft. She finished her career with the Hoosiers in 2022-23, leading Indiana to a Big Ten regular season championship.\n\nBerger averaged 12.9 points, 5.8 assists and 4.8 rebounds per game in her final season in Bloomington.\n\n\"Yeah, it's great when you have the chance to work with NBA Cares, go see the children\" said Metta World Peace, who played with the NBA's Indiana Pacers from 2002-06. \"It's good for publicity, it's good for community building, but it's also good individually for the children.\"\n\nIt was a great opportunity for Berger and others to get involved in the community on Valentine's Day.\n\nRelated stories on Indiana women's basketball"
