Michael Connelly I like a ton of different writers and frequently re-read Raymond Chandler who has probably had the greatest influence on me. But to be honest, I most often am inspired to write about Harry Bosch by real detectives. I spend time with people who really do the work that Harry does in the pages of fiction. The pressures and dangers they face are real and when I hear them tell stories about cases and their dedication, I canâ€™t help but get inspired to write.
