Set in Los Angeles, the book follows Marlowe as he becomes involved in a complex case surrounding the death of Terry Lennox, a troubled war veteran.\n\nThe novel explores themes of corruption, betrayal, loyalty, and the blurred lines between justice and personal morality. As Marlowe delves deeper into the case, he uncovers a web of deceit, blackmail, and murder that stretches beyond the initial crime. The story takes readers through various social strata of 1950s Los Angeles, revealing the underbelly of the city and its dark secrets.\n\nOne of the central themes of “The Long Goodbye” is the idea of loneliness and alienation in a world filled with flawed characters.
