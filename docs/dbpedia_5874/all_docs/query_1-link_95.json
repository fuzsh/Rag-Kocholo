        "text": "In this “dazzling” (New York Times Book Review) mystery from an Edgar Award winning author, a fearless black-bag publicist exposes the belly of the L.A. beast.\n\nA New York Times Best Crime Book of the Year • A NYTBR Editors' Choice Selection • An Anthony Award Nominee • A Barry Award Nominee • An ABA January 2023 Indie Next List Pick •\n\nRecommended by New York Times Book Review • NPR/Fresh Air • Wall Street Journal • Washington Post • LA Times • CrimeReads • The Boston Globe • South Florida Sun Sentinel • Alta Online • Lit Hub• Kirkus Reviews• Publishers Weekly• NBC/TODAY and many more!\n\nWelcome to Mae Pruett’s Los Angeles, where “Nobody talks. But everybody whispers.” As a “black-bag” publicist tasked not with letting the good news out but keeping the bad news in, Mae works for one of LA’s most powerful and sought-after crisis PR firms, at the center of a sprawling web of lawyers, PR flaks, and private security firms she calls “The Beast.” They protect the rich and powerful and depraved by any means necessary.\n\nAfter her boss is gunned down in front of the Beverly Hills Hotel in a random attack, Mae takes it upon herself to investigate and runs headfirst into The Beast’s lawless machinations and the twisted systems it exists to perpetuate. It takes her on a roving neon joyride through a Los Angeles full of influencers pumped full of pills and fillers; sprawling mansions footsteps away from sprawling homeless encampments; crooked cops and mysterious wrecking crews in the middle of the night."
