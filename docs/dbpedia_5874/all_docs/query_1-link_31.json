        "text": "A friend pointed out a house in a Hollywood side street the other day where, as he put it, \"a man with whisky and tobacco on his breath once sat down and wrote The Big Sleep\".\n\nA few days later, at a party to launch The Jasmine Trade by Denise Hamilton, a writer who says her main influences are Raymond Chandler, James M Cain and Walter Mosley, I mentioned the house and was told that, in fact, Chandler wrote The Big Sleep when he lived in Santa Monica and that the reason for the confusion was that he had had 16 different addresses during his time in southern California.\n\nEveryone seemed to know one or two of his addresses, which appeared to indicate that, more than 40 years after he had embarked on his own big sleep, Chandler still cast a giant shadow over the LA novel.\n\nThis summer there have been no fewer than six new books that could claim, to greater or lesser degrees, to be LA novels, and earlier this year the British academic Julian Murphet explored the subject in Literature and Race in Los Angeles. So is the city best known for a siren medium that has wrecked many of the world's great writers finally asserting itself as a new home of American fiction?\n\nAs Murphet points out, \"If there is a literary establishment in America, a pantheon of hallowed luminaries including Updike, Bellow, Wolfe, Roth, Ashbery and DeLillo, there is no question as to its spatial location: it is in the east and north.\" This has long been taken as a given. New Yorkers like to joke that an LA book party is an oxymoron and that to the average Californian, the main function of a book is as a coaster for a margarita. Things change and evidence is emerging that not only does LA have one of the richest literary heritages of the 20th century but that a new LA novel is emerging.\n\nThe six latest books are from a mix of writers, male and female, black and white, gay and straight, young and middle-aged, first-time and established, literary and populist, travelling both familiar routes and taking diversions. Sandro Meallet, for instance, the young author of Edgewater Angels, comes from the San Pedro docklands area of the city, a part of LA of which many of its citizens are barely aware.\n\nSusan Compo, whose first novel, Pretty Things, is published in the UK this month, came from a military family and the conservative heartlands of Orange County. Denise Hamilton, whose first book deals with the \"parachute kids\", the wealthy Asian children left in LA while their parents continue to work in Hong Kong, is a former LA Times reporter. The other three new novels come from famous names: Walter Mosley, who has created a new character, Fearless Jones, and set him in 50s Watts; Clive Barker, the sultan of horror, who has written a Hollywood novel, Coldheart Canyon, full of plastic surgery, fantasy, silent stars and sex; and Jackie Collins, who has come up with Hollywood Wives: the New Generation, which has been enjoying a long stay in the bestseller list of the New York Times (but not, note, that of the LA Times).\n\nSo what is the LA novel? A couple of years ago the literary editor of the LA Times, Steve Wasserman, asked a cast of writers to pick what they reckoned was the best of LA literature. The most frequently chosen books were: Nathanael West's The Day of the Locust, Raymond Chandler's Farewell My Lovely and The Big Sleep, F Scott Fitzgerald's The Last Tycoon, Horace McCoy's They Shoot Horses, Don't They? and Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye, Chester Himes's If He Hollers Let Him Go, Budd Schulberg's What Makes Sammy Run?, Ludwig Bemelmans' Dirty Eddie, Evelyn Waugh's The Loved One, Joan Didion's Play It As It Lays, Gavin Lambert's Inside Daisy Clover, James Ellroy's The Black Dahlia and My Dark Places, Christopher Isherwood's A Single Man and John Fante's Ask the Dust.\n\nOthers would certainly find a place on their lists for more recent works such as John Rechy's City of Night, Yxta Maya Murray's Locas, Judith Freeman's The Chinchilla Farm, Hector Tobar's The Tattooed Soldier, Brett Easton Ellis's Less than Zero, Carolyn See's Golden Days and Making History, Elmore Leonard's Get Shorty, Gary Indiana's Resentment, DJ Waldie's Holy Land, Michael Nava's The Burning Plain, April Smith's North of Montana and Susan Straight's The Gettin' Place. Michael Connelly, a former LA Times crime reporter, is on many lists for his LA-based mystery tales featuring the detective Harry Bosch.\n\nRichard Rayner, the English writer and author of the well-received LA Without a Map, lives in the Los Angeles suburb Venice and is working on a new book in which he again uses the city as a backdrop, albeit in a different period. He lists four genres of LA novel, although some merge: Hollywood, noir, Hispanic and \"expat-fish-out-of-water\" such as his own.\n\n\"I have always thought the place was crying out for one Balzacian novel,\" says Rayner. \"This a great place for a novelist to live . . . as long as you don't have anything to do with the machine. It's a real hogfest of material that is around you every day.\"\n\nJulian Murphet notes how many of those fish-out-of-water books there are, written with a \"vision that was essentially modernist and imported - alienated, anti-commercial and ironic - and it assumed that the jaded eye of the newcomer alone held the power to condense the otherwise imponderable lessons of a bizarre locale into palpable aesthetic forms.\"\n\nDavid Fine, professor of English at California State University, Long Beach, explored the city's fiction comprehensively in last year's Imagining Los Angeles: A City in Fiction, in which he concluded that \"20th-century fiction about Los Angeles is less a collection of hate mail to a beleaguered city than an expression of anxiety about the modern condition\", but he also noted the importance of what he calls \"migrant fiction\" - those writers, east coast American, English, whatever, who came to \"the site of (America's) Heaven and Hell, the best and worst place the country has to offer\" in order to write.\n\nThe British expat writers almost deserve a category of their own. Chandler was, of course, a Dulwich boy and Evelyn Waugh transformed Forest Lawn Memorial Park into Whispering Glades in The Loved One. Christopher Isherwood's A Single Man is the story of an expat English professor who gazed out on the place which had once been \"a sub-tropical English village with Montmartre manners\" and LA has proved fertile ground for British writers ever since. Clive Barker's accent floats between the Liverpool of his childhood and the Coldwater Canyon of his present, and he has just produced Coldheart Canyon, whose characters (vain star, ruthless manager etc) fulfil the requirements of the Hollywood genre, this \"vale of luxury and tears\", as Barker has it.\n\n\"The great thing about fantasy is that it dates nicely,\" he says. And then there's Britain's own Jackie Collins and her Hollywood Wives: the New Generation with its quota of cocaine, topless bars and script doctors.\n\nSusan Compo almost counts as an honorary Englishwoman as she has lived in London and is probably the only woman novelist in LA fully conversant with English football: she used to write for Match of the Day magazine and has invited Chelsea's Graeme LeSaux to her book launch party in London. Pretty Things is her first novel, although she has written collections of stories before, one of which, Life After Death, elicited praise for her \"extremely original vision\" from Hubert Selby Jr and comparisons with Dorothy Parker. She uses LA as the canvas for a story that deals with would-be stars, porn empires and agents. Compo explains: \"I don't like it when it's made out to be a cultural wasteland, so dated. It's like thinking that in London people are always going for tea.\"\n\nThe Hollywood story remains a staple. Most recently Dori Carter entered the field with Beautiful Wasps Having Sex: \"Only in Hollywood can you redo your phone list, throw out your friends and never miss them.\" Carolyn See, author of Golden Days, has issued her own appraisal of \"Hollywood novels [which] were - and still are, I suppose - a dime a dozen, generally the products of homesick eastern writers who were lured out to Hollywood, furiously disappointed and who then issued standard jeremiads about the bogusness of this place: flowers here had no scent and fruit no taste. There were no seasons. 'Love' meant nothing.\"\n\nBut what is finally happening is that the genres of noir, Hollywood and expat are finally being joined by writing from all the parts of the city that have changed so much since Philip Marlowe trod their sidewalks.\n\nNow there are new writers, black and Latino, from east LA or the projects, who are also being recognised. These would include Sandro Meallet, who writes in Edgewater Angels of the gangs and the standoffs, and Hector Tobar, author of the much-praised The Tattooed Soldier. Tobar is the son of Guatemalan immigrants and a journalist with the LA Times, whose book focuses on the large but often ignored Guatemalan community in LA. What stories they have to tell. They arrive, like his character Antonio, who felt \"he knew California because he'd seen it come to life over and over again on his television screen. In Antonio's homeland, the words 'Los Angeles' sparkled, like sunlight glimmering off a mountain lake.\" The cast in The Tattooed Soldier hang out not in agents' offices or juice bars in West Hollywood but in \"MacArthur Park, where all the other Guatemaltecos and Salvadorenos and Mexicanos went, a little Parque Central almost like the ones back home.\"\n\nYxta Maya Murray, a young law professor in LA, has also been praised for her book, Locas, for breaking the mould and getting publishers to recognise that LA is a city in transition, the 2000 census showing that nearly half - 47% - is now Latino, 30% white and 11% black. Murray has followed up her success with Whatever It Takes to Get to Vegas.\n\nWalter Mosley has ploughed a sometimes lonely furrow and his new book introduces the eponymous Fearless Jones and a period when \"it was odd to see a black woman so well treated at a fancy Hollywood hotel. I didn't even think that a police detective had the clout to make a place like that serve a Negro.\" Mosley's A Red Death (1991) also explored a less familiar LA, placing its hero, Easy Rawlins, in the old red-baiting era of the city and looking at the Hollywood blacklist from a black perspective: \"Mosta these guys gonna have work again... but you still gonna be a black niggah, Easy.\"\n\nAnd it was with a sense of frustration that another LA writer, Wanda Coleman, nominated her own work, A War of Eyes, in the LA Times book list on the grounds that \"I have no choice but to toot my own horn because absolutely nobody has written with significant merit about the South-Central LA I grew up and spent most of my adult life in except me.\"\n\nSteve Wasserman, who edits the LA Times Books Review, agrees with Rayner that \"Balzac has yet to emerge\" to bind together the different LAs of Bel Air and Boyle Heights, of Compton and Culver City. He feels that the strength of the new literature that has come out of the city is through its immigrants and because LA is, in Susan Sontag's phrase, \"America's America\".\n\nThere may not be as many LA novels as screenplays being pumped out in the cool of the Los Feliz night or beneath the police helicopter searchlights in Hacienda Heights these days. But, as screenwriters complain about the destruction of their craft and seek something purer and less subject to the iron whim of the studios' marketing departments, perhaps one of their number will finally emerge as the Dickens of Doheny Drive or even the Beverly Hills Balzac."
