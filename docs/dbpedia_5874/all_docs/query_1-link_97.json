        "text": "Which Crime Novels Would You Recommend?\n\nReading has been my salvation for as long as I can remember. This year, I’ve struggled with health and work issues, and somehow, I’ve lost the ability to focus on a book. I start books but sometimes leave them unfinished.\n\nOf course, I’m also reading fabulous short stories for the Forge Literary Magazine. (If you write short stories or flash fiction, we want to see them!)\n\nFor now, I’m reading crime novels because they seem to hold my interest. Crime books mostly deal with the seamier side of human nature, and the guilty parties get punished, more often than not.\n\nI’m looking for detective novels, mystery novels, literary crime novels, good thriller books involving crime– a bunch of crime novel recommendations, in short.\n\nA few books I read this year:\n\nThe Killing Lessons by Valerie Hart–I liked this one, but found the protagonist too tortured, and the scenes a little staged/forced. Did not feel like picking up anything else by this author.\n\nI Let You Go by Clare Mackintosh: Did not like the twist in this one, but loved the protagonist.\n\nCase Histories by Kate Atkinson: lovely writing, and the characters were fantastic. A bit slow, but it is not a chore to take the time on this journey.\n\nApple Tree Yard by Louise Doughty, which has a wonderful voice. This was a signed copy by the author, and I have fond memories of the reading. The book is quite a long one, but the ending is very well earned.\n\nThe Kind Worth Killing by Peter Swanson: This had a very promising beginning, but was so implausible in parts that I was happy to put it down. This author can write, just that this book didn’t do it for me. At all.\n\nThe Heavens May Fall by Allen Eskens: I liked the premise, but not so much the execution of this courtroom novel.\n\nI’m reading The Girls by Emma Cline this week, and liking it so far.\n\nWhat novels are you reading? Do you read or write crime?\n\nWould you recommend a crime novel you read this year?\n\nDrop me the title in the comments, and I’ll look it up!\n\nFor those of you who read books you loved but they weren’t crime novels–please add them, too. Who knows, they might just help me find my ‘reading-focus’ again!\n\n———\n\nI co-host the monthly We Are the World Blogfest: I’d like to invite you to join, if you haven’t as yet, to post the last Friday of each month a snippet of positive news that shows our essential, beautiful humanity.\n\nThis monthly event has brought smiles on the faces of a lot of participants and their audiences, and somewhat restored their faith in humanity.
