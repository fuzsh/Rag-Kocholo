        "text": "My guest today is Alex Segura, author of the gritty and gripping Pete Fernandez Mystery series (published by Polis Books). The fifth and final book in the acclaimed series—Miami Midnight—just launched last month and has received high praise from the likes of Entertainment Weekly, Library Journal, New York Times bestselling author Alafair Burke, and—least importantly—me.\n\nIn addition to writing kick-ass crime novels, Alex writes kick-ass comic books, and is the co-creator and co-writer of the LETHAL LIT podcast, which was named one of the Five Best Podcasts of 2018 by The New York Times despite never having had me on as a guest.\n\nAs talented a writer as Alex is, what’s even more impressive is his humility, compassion, and gratitude. One look at his Twitter feed will tell you that. As will an interview with him—so let’s get to it!\n\nHi Alex! HUGE congrats on Miami Midnight! The book has received a ton of buzz—thus I assume you’re buzzing too. But it being the final installment of the Pete Fernandez Mystery series, has this book launch/tour been bittersweet for you?\n\nThanks, Greg. Appreciate it. Yes, it has been a little bittersweet—more than I expected, honestly. I thought it’d just be the end, you know? But the reaction has been so positive, and it’s also come with a lot of nice notes about the series as a whole, with fans decrying the end in a really nice way! So while I don’t think I regret ending the series for now—it is time—it has been bittersweet to look back on the entire run as this complete thing. I can’t believe we’ve reached the fifth book.\n\nEvery reader loves a highly flawed protagonist they can’t resist rooting for, and Pete Fernandez certainly falls into that category. How did you and Pete first “meet”? Have you always gotten along with him?\n\nI first saw him when I started toying with the idea of writing my own PI novel, before I even considered it becoming a series. I wanted to write about someone sort of like me, Cuban-American, younger, just starting out in the PI game, saddled with real problems. Then the name appeared, and I got this visual of Pete, passed out drunk in his bed, struggling to get his life in order—which is literally the first time we see him in the first novel, Silent City. And then we were off!\n\nWhat do you like most about writing a series? What do you like the least?\n\nI like the continuity. I like spending time with the same characters. It’s like TV vs. the movies. You get comfortable with these people and start to believe they’re real. And while every series book involves some level of recap for new readers or those coming back, there’s an element of “okay, here’s the next thing,” where you can just dive in and showcase the new adventure. I think, in terms of what I like least, it has to be the barnacles you collect along the way—you just add baggage to the characters and it becomes more challenging to say something new after a while. Which is why I had a finite set of stories I knew I could tell with Pete and his crew. Eventually, it’d start to challenge reality/plausibility. So by book five, it felt like the right time to say goodbye... for now.\n\nWhich authors have influenced you and your writing the most? Have you ever met any of them and, if so, how much did you stammer and sweat during the encounter?\n\nI’ve made no secret about my influences. Crime writers like Laura Lippman, George Pelecanos, Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane, Megan Abbott, James Ellroy, and a few from an earlier generation—like Raymond Chandler, Jim Thompson, Ross Macondald, John D. MacDonald, Charles Willeford, Patricia Highsmith, Margaret Millar... those are all off the top of my head. But those are the ones that directly affect my writing, to this day. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting most of the living ones, and even more proud to call a few of them a friend. I was pretty cool and collected with most, but admit to losing my chill the first time I met Dennis Lehane. Thankfully, I got to make up for that the second time I spoke with him, so I think we’re good.\n\nFor me, one of the most interesting things about crime fiction is the research the author must conduct before and while writing the novel. What kinds of crazy things might we (or the FBI) find in your browser history? (Assuming you haven’t cleared it.)\n\nAll my research is on the page—I spent a lot of time reading about cults and political assassinations for my fourth novel, Blackout, for example. For Miami Midnight, it was more about what I was enjoying as a reader and listener—so, jazz, the Cuban mob, true crime memoirs and stuff like that. I’m pretty transparent. I don’t do much “homework reading” when it comes to my novels. Whatever I’m reading for pleasure becomes what I write about because it feels more natural that way.\n\nWhen did you first realize you wanted to be a crime novelist? What are some key things you know now that you wish you’d known when you first started?\n\nI always wanted to write, as far back as I can remember. Whether it was comics, sci-fi, literary fiction, or what-have-you, but the crime aspect hit me in my late twenties, when I started reading more modern takes on the PI novel—and that’s when it crystallized for me that I might be able to add my voice to that chorus.\n\nWhat’s the last book you read? Are you currently reading anything now, and, if so, how the hell do you find the time in the middle of your launch/tour?\n\nI just finished rereading Rob Hart’s fantastic The Warehouse. Everyone is rightfully talking about this novel, which will be sticking with me for a long time. I’m currently finishing up J. Michael Straczynski’s memoir, Becoming Superman, which is heartbreaking, intense and thoughtful. I’m also reading Alison Gaylin’s Never Look Back next, which I’m excited to dive into. In terms of time, well, reading is important! If I’m not reading all the time, I shouldn’t be writing.\n\nGot another book in the works? Or do you, like me, need a couple months of therapy and/or binge drinking before resuming the madness of novel writing?\n\nWell, I don’t drink, and I’m not sure what a break is! I tend to start the next thing while revising or copyediting the last one, so I’m about a quarter into a new standalone that I’m really excited about.\n\nOoh, now I’m excited, too… as I’m sure all your readers are. Thanks a ton for taking the time to chat with me, Alex. Here’s to your continued success with Miami Midnight, and beyond!\n\nThank you for having me, Greg!"
