        "text": "Exorcism or Murder? John Jordan investigates the death of a troubled young woman undergoing exorcism – a case he’s uniquely qualified to investigate. But is he dealing with forces not even he can understand? And what will it cost him?\n\nDo you love mystery, suspense, thrillers, with some romance and a smart, unique, thoughtful detective? Then John Jordan is for you and you’ll love Michael Lister's Award-winning John Jordan Mystery series.\n\nIn the thrilling BLOOD SACRIFICE . . .\n\nFollowing a particularly brutal and costly case, John Jordan goes to a secluded retreat center and encounters one of the most bewildering and haunting cases of his career—the suspicious death of a young woman undergoing an exorcism.\n\n”Michael Lister may be the author of the most unique series running in mystery fiction. It crackles with tension and authenticity”, Michael Connelly.\n\n˃˃˃ Blood Sacrifice is an exciting entry into one of the most unique series in contemporary crime fiction.\n\nMichael Koryta says, \"If you like crime writing with depth, suspense, and sterling prose, you should be reading Michael Lister.\"\n\nLister writes lyrical, evocative prose, reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy - Panama City News Herald.\n\nQ&A with author Michael Lister.\n\nHow did chaplaincy work help you write fiction?\n\nJohn Jordan and the “Blood” series wouldn’t exist had I not been a prison chaplain.\n\nI wanted to write clerical detective mysteries from the moment I first happened upon a 1990 Avenel edition of Father Brown Crime Stories in a dusty old bookstore in Atlanta the year I graduated from seminary school and was ordained.\n\nBut as inspiring and influential as I found Father Brown and the ecclesiastical sleuths that followed him, particularly those penned by Andrew Greeley, I was far more influenced by hard-boiled writers like Robert B. Parker, James Lee Burke, Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Michael Connelly, Graham Greene, Dennis Lehane, Ernest Hemingway, Walter Mosley, and Cormac McCarthy, and I knew that my clerical detective would be different. I would introduce a strong, tough, troubled clerical detective into the world of the hard-boiled detective novel. And that’s where prison chaplaincy came in."
