        "text": "Saul Bellow said a writer is a reader moved to emulation.\n\nI am a reader moved to emulation. I am a moviegoer moved to make story.\n\nI am a crime, mystery, detective, noir novelist inspired by more writers and filmmakers than I can begin to catalog, but here are three contemporary crime writers that first moved me to emulation, and continue to inspire me.\n\nFirst, there was Parker.\n\nAs a junior in high school in 1985, I watched “Spenser for Hire,” the TV series about Robert B. Parker’s Boston PI. At the time I was reading philosophy, psychology and religion books, and very little fiction.\n\nThe TV series led me to Parker’s books.\n\nIn Parker’s work, crime and investigation merely provide a framework for his characters, giving them something to do while the real investigation into their psyches takes place.\n\nFrom book to book, Parker was tweaking the themes that mattered to him — which, more than anything, was what it means to be a man, exploring why hard-boiled, tough, tender, autonomous, honorable men are the way they are. I didn’t read Parker for plot so much as for his stripped-down style, sharp, often witty dialog, and his interesting, evolving characters, and the insights that peppered his prose like a boxer with a great jab. Most of all, I read him for the journey of the man at the center of the story, which, inevitably, was Parker himself.\n\nNext, there was James Lee Burke.\n\nIn 1996, I grabbed a VHS tape of “Heaven’s Prisoners” as the Dixie Dandy, a gas station-grocery store, was closing and watched it late that night on a small TV beside my bed, wearing headphones so as not to wake my 1-year-old son sleeping in the crib at the end of the bed.\n\nOnce again the relationship between film and literature. An adaptation led me to the amazing source material it was based on, introducing me to James Lee Burke’s novels featuring Louisiana detective Dave Robicheaux.\n\nHere was a writer working in a milieu that matched my own.\n\nAs a writer, as a reader, as a Southerner, I understood and identified with James Lee Burke in ways I wasn’t able to with any other writer before.\n\nMr. Burke is one of the finest writers to ever pick up a pen, his lush prose, devastating descriptions, and startling metaphors, transcendent, poetic, revelatory.\n\nIn 1975, in the theater of the Student Union at the University of Florida, a building-trade major saw Robert Altman’s adaptation of Raymond Chandler’s “The Long Goodbye.” Like “Spenser for Hire” and “Heaven’s Prisoners” had for me, the film led him to the books and the books moved him to emulation. The student changed his major. And that change changed my life. The student was Michael Connelly –– another writer whose work has consistently inspired and instructed me and moved me to emulation.\n\nMichael Connelly writes about things lost — lost innocence, lost life, lost love, lost and missing persons, lost souls, “Lost” Angeles, and, most of all, lost light. Harry Bosch, Connelly’s cop, inhabits a world so dark even the light is lost. He continually and willingly enters the dark, looking for lost light, leading others to it, an arduous, treacherous, painful journey that always makes me think of Milton.\n\n“Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light.”\n\nWhile working on this piece, a new writer with his first novel out wrote me to say that he had spent an entire month this summer studying my novel “Double Exposure.” Having him say that reminded me of how I have been able to express similar sentiments of appreciation to Mr. Connelly, Mr. Burke, and the late Mr. Parker — and how giving or receiving such a message is equally gratifying.\n\nMichael Lister is a writer living in Panama City.
