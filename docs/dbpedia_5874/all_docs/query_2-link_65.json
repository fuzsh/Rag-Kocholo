        "text": "Justin Warren is a high school teacher who has dreams of one day becoming a full-time novelist. His love for writing came when he picked up a copy of Michael Connelly's Blood Work, and couldn't put it down. Like Connelly, Justin's work has a strong sense of \"place,\" transporting the reader into the often turbulent world of his characters.\n\nDuring his time at university, Justin took up a part-time job as a newspaper journalist and honed his craft in the cutthroat environment of a busy newsroom. This face-paced life of interesting characters, interviews, deadlines, and breaking news significantly influenced his writing style.\n\nJustin has successfully self-published two crime novels and is currently working on a third. His second book, THE LEWIS PASS, received a \"highly commended\" in the 2020 Lilian Ida Smith Literary Awards. Justin is slowly building a growing following of enthusiastic readers from the USA to the UK to Canada, Australia, and also in his home country of New Zealand. All his books are set on the beautiful West Coast of New Zealand and deal with issues of loss and loneliness, crime, and the fragility of life.\n\nHe lives in Christchurch New Zealand with his wife and two young children. His literary influences include Michael Connolly, Raymond Chandler, Paul Cleave, Ben Sanders, and Tana French."
