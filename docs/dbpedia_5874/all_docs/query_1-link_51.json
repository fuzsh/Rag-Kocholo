        "text": "Here's something truly unique! Do you love mystery, suspense, thrillers, with some romance and a unique, thoughtful detective?\n\nThen John Jordan is for you and you’ll love Michael Lister's \"BLOOD\" SERIES beginning with POWER IN THE BLOOD.\n\nThe popular, award-winning, and critically-acclaimed John Jordan mystery series.\n\n˃˃˃ POWER IN THE BLOOD a John Jordan novel from multi-award-winning and bestselling author Michael Lister\n\nWitness the series Florida Weekly calls “a treasure of contemporary literature–suspenseful, provocative, and unsettling,” and bestselling author Julia Spencer-Fleming says is “one of the most ambitious and unusual crime fiction series going. Read this and see what crime fiction is capable of.”\n\nIn this debut novel Lister, a prison chaplain, introduces John Jordan, chaplain of a prison in the Florida Panhandle, who witnesses the bloody death of Potter Correctional Institution inmate Ike Johnson. Jordan discovers that in the closed society of captives and captors no action goes unseen, and no one takes kindly to a cop in a collar. He soon finds his reputation, his career, and even his life are at stake.\n\n\"Michael Lister may be the author of the most unique series running in mystery fiction. It crackles with tension and authenticity.\" Michael Connelly\n\nIn a mystery book market saturated with stories of gruesome serial killers devoid of morality and shady investigators whose questionable tactics make them difficult heroes, Power in the Blood by Michael Lister offers a more spiritual view of social ills and acknowledges that, behind every despicable act, there is always room for forgiveness and redemption.\n\n\"While writing Power in the Blood , I attempted to present Chaplain Jordan as a person who is in many ways quite ordinary despite being a man of the cloth. Like everyone else, Jordan attempts to find romance, deals with the demands of work on a daily basis, and struggles with his faith,\" said Michael Lister. \"Despite the extraordinary violence that he must face and the misdeeds of fallen souls he endures, Jordan manages to pursue the investigation with honesty and grace. I think that makes him an unusual hero in today's mystery market.\" By offering up the sacred as well as the profane, Power in the Blood is sure to please both mystery readers and general fiction enthusiasts.\n\n\"Eerie and cinematic, classic whodunits with thoroughly modern sensibilities. John Jordan manages to be deeply flawed yet utterly appealing. Lister, with his gift for exploring the nuances of human relationships, creates a vivid and multi-faceted supporting cast, each character finely-wrought, each portrayal unflinching. Suspenseful, complex and original, page-turners with a soul.\" Lisa Unger\n\nIf you love exciting, gritty, thoughtful mysteries, don't miss Michael Lister's POWER IN THE BLOOD.\n\nQ&A with author Michael Lister.\n\nHow did chaplaincy work help you write fiction?\n\nJohn Jordan and the “Blood” series wouldn’t exist had I not been a prison chaplain.\n\nI wanted to write clerical detective mysteries from the moment I first happened upon a 1990 Avenel edition of Father Brown Crime Stories in a dusty old bookstore in Atlanta the year I graduated from seminary school and was ordained.\n\nBut as inspiring and influential as I found Father Brown and the ecclesiastical sleuths that followed him, particularly those penned by Andrew Greeley, I was far more influenced by hard-boiled writers like Robert B. Parker, James Lee Burke, Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Michael Connelly, Graham Greene, Dennis Lehane, Ernest Hemingway, Walter Mosley, and Cormac McCarthy, and I knew that my clerical detective would be different. I would introduce a strong, tough, troubled clerical detective into the world of the hard-boiled detective novel. And that’s where prison chaplaincy came in.\""
