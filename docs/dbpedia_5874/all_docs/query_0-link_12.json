        "text": "Michael Connelly started out as a crime reporter in Florida and eventually moved to Los Angeles. Inspired by Raymond Chandler, he began writing mystery novels. He has twenty-one bestselling titles in the Harry Bosch series alone.\n\nI decided to read his novels when my stepfather recommended him. Wow, was he right.\n\nMichael Connelly novels:\n\nHarry Bosch Series:\n\nLos Angeles Police Detective Hieronymus (Harry) Bosch is Michael Connelly’s most famous character. (Red = read)\n\nThe Black Echo (1992)\n\nThe Black Ice (1993)\n\nThe Concrete Blonde (1994)\n\nThe Last Coyote (1995)\n\nTrunk Music (1997)\n\nAngels Flight (1999)\n\nA Darkness More Than Night (2001)\n\nCity Of Bones (2002)\n\nLost Light (2003)\n\nThe Narrows (2004) (sequel to The Poet, below)\n\nThe Closers (2005) – shelf\n\nEcho Park (2006) -shelf\n\nThe Overlook (2007) -shelf\n\nNine Dragons (2009) (also featuring Mickey Haller)- shelf\n\nThe Drop (2011) – shelf\n\nThe Black Box (2012) -ordered\n\nThe Burning Room (2014)\n\nThe Crossing (2015) (also featuring Mickey Haller)\n\nThe Wrong Side Of Goodbye (2016) (also featuring Mickey Haller)\n\nTwo Kinds Of Truth (2017) (also featuring Mickey Haller)\n\nDark Sacred Night (coming October 2018) (also featuring Renée Ballard)\n\nConnelly’s main character also inspired the popular Amazon series Bosch, loosely based on the novels.\n\nMichael Connelly has also written novels featuring other characters:\n\nJack McEvoy- reporter:\n\nThe Poet (1996)\n\nThis novel has a great first line:\n\nDeath is my beat.\n\nHenry Pierce – chemical scientist and entrepreneur:\n\nChasing the Dime (2002) -shelf\n\nMickey Haller -defense attorney:\n\nThe Lincoln Lawyer (2005)\n\nThe Brass Verdict (2008) -shelf\n\nThe Reversal (2010)\n\nThe Fifth Witness (2011)\n\nThe Gods of Guilt (2013) – shelf\n\nRenée Ballard – police detective:\n\nThe Late Show (2017)\n\nThe Late Show*\n\n(*Amazon Affiliate link)\n\nRenée Ballard is a police detective who works the midnight shift, catching new cases but never getting the opportunity to see them through because they are passed on to the day shift. That is until she and her partner are sent to the hospital to check on a badly beaten prostitute and a young waitress who was shot in a bar fight. Renee senses these are important cases and decides to follow the investigations to the end. Can she obtain justice for the victims no one else cares about?\n\nConnelly tends to torture his main characters with workplace problems. In this case, Renée Ballard is working the midnight shift because she had accused her supervisor of sexual harassment and the supervisor demoted her.\n\nI can’t wait to see the sparks fly when Harry Bosch meets Renée Ballard in Dark Sacred Night coming out in October 2018.\n\n###\n\nAbout Author Posts:\n\nBecause I read a lot of mysteries, I’ve been trying to come up with a better system to keep track of which novels I’ve finished. I thought blogging would help, which it does, but I don’t always review everything I read. To get more organized, I’ve decided to create a series of author posts with lists of novels and links to my reviews. I plan to edit these pages as needed."
