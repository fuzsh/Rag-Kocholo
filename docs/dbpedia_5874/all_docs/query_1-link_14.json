        "text": "DEAD BEAT: Michael Connelly’s latest noir thriller, “The Scarecrow,” which enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 1, begins with the veteran crime reporter Jack McEvoy being laid off at The Los Angeles Times. But after some grousing with fellow ink-stained wretches, McEvoy starts to see the silver lining: “Deep down, every journalist wants to be a novelist. It’s the difference between art and craft. Every writer wants to be considered an artist and I was now going to take my shot at it. The half novel I had sitting at home — the plot of which I couldn’t even correctly remember — was my ticket.”\n\nHey, it worked for Connelly. Since his early days on the crime beat at The Los Angeles Times, he has published 21 books, including some 16 hardcover best sellers. As it turns out, Connelly (who once rented the apartment used in the 1973 film version of Raymond Chandler's “Long Goodbye” as a writing studio) got out of the newspaper business before things turned really scary. In “The Scarecrow,” in addition to facing down corporate bean counters and the usual gangbangers, McEvoy does battle with remorseless cyberthieves operating out of an underground bunker called the Farm. Do I smell an allegory here? O.K., maybe not. Asked recently by an interviewer about the technological changes laying waste to newspapers, Connelly replied in true hard-boiled style: “Google doesn’t kill newspapers. People kill newspapers.”"
