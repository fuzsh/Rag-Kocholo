        "text": "Michael Connelly is the kind of guy who will pick up the phone at 10 a.m. on the day he’s leaving for a European vacation. In fact, he’s the kind of guy who will talk to a fellow Gator alum on speaker phone while he and his wife are driving to the airport.\n\n“It’s my wife’s birthday,” he said by way of explanation. The couple met at the University of Florida, both in the College of Journalism and Communications in the late 1970s.\n\nOf course, Michael Connelly also is the kind of guy who has spent the last 25 years of his life writing exorbitantly popular and successful novels. The kind whose work you’ve seen on Netflix for the past four years and going strong. His first published work, The Black Echo, came out in 1992 and featured the now TV famous, fictional Hieronymus “Harry” Bosch.\n\n“To have that first book turned into a season of TV almost 25 years later, that’s pretty amazing,” Connelly said. “A lot of my feelings about being a writer are still wrapped up in that book and that writing experience, and this is like validation. I was right back then when I thought it was a book worthy of publishing.”\n\nNot all of Connelly’s early work made his own cut. The first two novels he started to write were set here in Florida, but they never saw the light of day. In fact, he never even finished them.\n\n“The first two are in a box somewhere in storage. They got what they deserved. They were learning experiences,” he said.\n\nConnelly hasn’t always been a novelist. He started as a journalist for The Daytona Beach News Journal and the Sun Sentinel, and moved to the L.A. Times where he continued as a reporter on the crime beat. His real-life experience served as a conduit for his fictional characters and conundrums.\n\n“I’m kind of a journalist in novelist clothing,” Connelly said. “I was a newspaper reporter for a long time, and I had to think, what do I have that other authors don’t have? And I had this huge police department with all this drama, so I decided to write what I know.”\n\nIt’s how he first broke into the fiction-writing world, as well.\n\n“I said, ‘I’m a crime reporter for the L.A. Times.’ I thought that would be a door opener [for agents],” he said. “I talked about the real cases I wrote about. I played up that I had an inside track to this world, and that’s what I’m writing about in fiction. And they weren’t clamoring for me, but I got a few bites.”\n\nConnelly is a long way from those first name-making years, with several awards and a TV series to his name. He says his slow climb keeps him grounded, and he’s not content to coast on his previous work.\n\n“I want to get better over time,” he said. “Whether writing news or books, you write for an audience of one; you are your own harshest critic. All along, I’ve always just wanted to be satisfied with myself.”\n\nHe considers himself a reader as well as a writer, and while Raymond Chandler will always be one of his favorite authors who influenced him the most, he makes room for new literary loves, too.\n\n“Probably over all time, my favorite is Raymond Chandler,” Connelly said. “I discovered him by going to the Reitz dollar movie night ‘The Long Goodbye,’ which led me to read all Chandler’s books, which led me to want to be a writer. My current new favorite writer is probably Lori Roy, who wrote ‘Bent Road.’ ”\n\nConnelly is a fan of what is new in many ways. While many authors cringe at the advent of self-publishing and e-books, Connelly views the change with hope and pleasure.\n\n“It expanded the reader base, as far as writers go,” he said. “I can’t list a lot of negatives about what’s happened in the 25 years I’ve been published. My readership has grown, but I also think the overall base has grown. Before it would be small mystery groups, and now there are internet groups that can be millions. If you test the right nerve, things can take off.”\n\nConnelly hasn’t forgotten his roots, either. He splits his time between Los Angeles and Tampa, and is an avid Gator fan.\n\n“I have courtside seats at the basketball games; I have friends that moved back after retiring,” he said. “The school is a big draw. I’m also on the Dean’s advisory board, and we meet twice a year to talk about ways to improve the school. I stay involved at UF; I’m still a big Gator.”"
