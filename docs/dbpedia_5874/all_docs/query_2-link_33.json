        "text": "Fans of Michael Connelly’s Harry Bosch thrillers, and there are many millions of us globally, will doubtless be pleased that his troubled L.A.P.D. detective—the abandoned son of a murdered prostitute—has at last become the hero of his own TV series. Bosch, starring Titus Welliver, begins streaming on Amazon Prime this month, and the unassuming Mr. Connelly met me for lunch in the Grill Room of the Four Seasons restaurant as he passed through New York recently en route to his home in Florida.\n\n“There’s something really decadent about ordering a $38 hamburger,” he remarked, mulling it over as he scanned the menu. A waiter hovered: “My name is Grant if you have any questions.” Mr. Connelly chose the pompano special. “I’m up for that. I caught pompano fishing off a bridge as a kid, and it was a prize catch. We wrapped it in foil and cooked it on a little hibachi grill with some lemon while we fished.” He also requested an iced tea (which he practically lives on, he explained, particularly when writing).\n\nThis quiet, contented man appeared to be the antithesis of the hard, damaged detective he christened Hieronymus Bosch—after the 15th-century Dutch artist whose fantastic paintings of the fallen in hell serve as a metaphor for L.A.'s criminal cesspool. “I’ve always thought of L.A. as the modern version of The Garden of Earthly Delights,” he said. “So much of it is physically beautiful—from the ocean to mountains to deserts. It’s all there—but it’s all messed up, you know? It's a town that reaches for the brass ring but always misses it.”\n\nHarry Bosch has been the antihero of 19 of Connelly's thrillers since the first, The Black Echo, in 1992. What do they have in common? “We’re both left-handed, we have teenage daughters, and we like jazz—that’s about it.” Bosch’s uncompromising credo, “Everybody counts or nobody counts,” speaks for the dead and the dregs. But at the bruised heart of the matter, Connelly shares his alter ego’s righteous sense of honor.\n\nHe mentioned almost casually that when he was 16 he was a witness to a crime and spent time with detectives. He was working late nights as a dishwasher at a hotel in Florida, when, returning home, he saw a man running and hiding something in a hedge. “It was a shirt wrapped around a gun—the first time in my life I ever held a gun,” he went on. He trailed the man into a biker bar. Police cars were already descending on the neighborhood with lights flashing. The teenage Connelly flagged one over, told them what he’d seen, and described the man. “They said someone had just been shot in a robbery.”\n\nThe cops emptied the bar, and Connelly, who was at first fascinated and then fearful, had to look at lineups of bikers to identify the robber. “It wasn’t through a one-way mirror. They could see me.” He was convinced they didn’t have the right guy. But the cops could see he was scared. “I couldn’t convince the detectives that they didn’t have him. They just thought I was this white kid from the suburbs who wouldn’t stand up and do the right thing. It left me feeling very poorly about myself. I was telling the truth. But I was found guilty by those cops and it really bothered me.”\n\nSome 40 years on, it still bugs him. He told of a remarkable coda to the story. When he became a rookie crime reporter for the local Florida paper eight years later, he met the same detective who hadn’t believed he was telling the truth that night. “You probably don't remember this case,” he insisted. “I'm telling you that you didn't have the right guy.” But he still didn't believe him.\n\nBorn in 1956, Michael Connelly was raised in Fort Lauderdale, the son of an engineer, and he lives in Tampa with his family. Los Angeles has long since been his spiritual home (where he also keeps a place). He was on a path to follow in his father’s footsteps and become an engineer when, in another decisive moment, he discovered Raymond Chandler.\n\nConnelly was 19 years old when he saw Robert Altman’s 1973 film noir of Chandler’s 1953 novel, The Long Goodbye, on a student-union Dollar Movie Night, and it changed the direction of his life. “I read all of Chandler’s novels in two weeks, and it really turned my head. That’s when I started saying I don’t want to just read this stuff. I want to write it. It wasn’t a decision to become a writer. I wanted to become a writer of crime fiction. I was very specific.”\n\nEncouraged by his father, he wound up a newspaperman, which he remained for 14 years, working mostly on the crime beat. (He was a Pulitzer-nominated investigative reporter before joining the Los Angeles Times.) The crime beat gave Connelly his intimate knowledge of the twilight world of cops like Bosch. But Chandler’s mythic, hard-drinking private eye, Philip Marlowe, remained his touchstone.\n\nHe even rented the 1930s High Tower apartment where Marlowe lived overlooking Hollywood in Altman’s The Long Goodbye. (Marlowe first lived there in Chandler’s 1942 The High Window.) “As a writer, you look for inspiration wherever you can get it,” said Connelly, who moved out of the place after four unfruitful years. (Plus, it didn’t have air-conditioning.)\n\nBut whenever he begins a new Bosch novel, he ritualistically reads Chandler’s melancholic homage to Los Angeles in Chapter 13 of his 1949 The Little Sister. And it inspires him every time. “Maybe we all get like this,” Marlowe ruminates darkly as he drives round the corrupt, compelling city. “In the cold half-lit world where always the wrong thing happens and never the right … ”\n\nHollywood\n\nIndustry Season 3 Is Dark, Addictive, and Filled With “Beautiful Fuckups”\n\nCreators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay open up about new cast member Kit Harington, Succession/Industry overlap, and the odds that their cult HBO drama gets a fourth season.\n\nAward Season\n\nHow Ripley Changed Dakota Fanning: “If I Can Do That, I Can Do Anything”\n\nAfter nearly 25 years onscreen, Fanning just received her first Emmy nomination for the Netflix series. She tells Vanity Fair why it represents her next chapter in Hollywood: “People feel like they know me, but then they also don’t.”\n\nStyle\n\nA Trump Fundraiser in the Hamptons Unleashed a Gridlock Nightmare\n\nLast Friday, never-ending traffic from Riverhead to Amagansett lasted late into the night, with vehicles on main roads, side streets, highways, and everything in between snarled for hours.\n\nCelebrity\n\nChasing James Baldwin’s Shadow in the South of France\n\nIt is the centenary of my literary hero. I went on a pilgrimage to trace his legacy.\n\nPolitics\n\nAll of the Crazy Things Donald Trump Said to a Roomful of Black Journalists\n\nThe former president baselessly claimed immigrants are coming for “Black jobs,” played dumb about the definition of DEI, and falsely questioned Kamala Harris’s multiracial identity. “She was Indian all the way,” he said, “and all of a sudden, she made a turn and she became a Black person.”\n\nHollywood\n\n“He’s Absolutely Extraordinary”: Remembering Robin Williams\n\nOn the 10-year anniversary of Robin Williams’s untimely passing, we asked more than 20 of his costars, collaborators, and friends—including Billy Crystal, Matt Damon, Ben Stiller, Al Pacino, Sally Field, Jeff Bridges, and Julianne Moore—for their favorite memories of this kind, playful, and uniquely intelligent artist.\n\nPolitics\n\nDonald Trump Has Nothing Else\n\nWhen the ex-president is desperate, he gets stuck on the 2020 election—and racist taunts.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe Woman Who Engineered Donald Trump’s Rise From the Ashes of 2020\n\nIn an excerpt of Trump in Exile, Meridith McGraw reveals how the former president was overwhelmed by the dysfunction his election loss brought upon Mar-a-Lago—until Susie Wiles took the wheel of his comeback campaign. “I don’t know who’s in charge,” he told Wiles. “I need you to fix it.”"
