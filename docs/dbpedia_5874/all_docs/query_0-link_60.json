        "text": "Matt Coyle is the author of the bestselling Rick Cahill crime series. Matt knew he wanted to be a crime writer at age fourteen when his father gave him Raymond Chandler’s The Simple Art of Murder. His books have won the Anthony, Shamus, Lefty, Ben Franklin Silver, Foreword Reviews Book of the Year Silver, and San Diego Book Awards, and have been nominated for the multiple Macavity, Shamus and Lefty Awards, as well as named to numerous Best Of lists. Blind Vigil is the seventh book in the Rick Cahill series. Matt hosts the “Crime Corner” podcast on the Authors on the Air Global Radio Network and lives in San Diego with his yellow Lab, Angus, where he is writing the next Rick Cahill novel.\n\nCheck out our reviews of his books Lost Tomorrows and Blind Vigil.\n\nBOOKS:\n\nYesterday’s Echo (2013)\n\nNight Tremors (2015)\n\nDark Fissures (2016)\n\nBlood Truth (2017)\n\nWrong Light (2018)\n\nBlind Vigil (2020)\n\nYour biggest literary influences:\n\nRaymond Chandler, Ross Macdonald, T. Jefferson Parker, Robert Crais, Michael Connelly\n\nLast book read:\n\nFair Warning by Michael Connelly\n\nThe book that changed your life:\n\nThe Long Goodbye by Raymond Chandler. I read it in my last quarter of college my senior year in a detective fiction writing class. Chandler’s prose gripped me and reminded me that crime fiction could be so much more than pulp fiction. Chandler showed me that a drunk wasn’t just a drunk, he had a real life and a story to tell. The Long Goodbye demonstrated exactly what Ross Macdonald meant when he said of Chandler, “He wrote like a slumming angel…” Chandler’s writing was at the same time raw and elegant. He wrote with eloquence and grit and showed me that the gray in the private investigator’s world was more interesting than the black and white world of whodunits. He wrote about real people with real problems who made bad choices and had to live with the consequences. That was the world I wanted to write about.\n\nYour favorite literary character:\n\nNot surprisingly, Raymond Chandler’s cynical private detective Philip Marlowe is my favorite literary character. Marlowe lived by his own code and always did what he deemed the right thing, no matter the consequences. He distrusted powerful institutions, whether they be city hall, law enforcement, or gentrified wealth. He was an educated man, but also schooled in the hard knocks of the street and could take a beating and dole one out when necessary. Marlowe finds the truth no matter who gets hurt, including himself. Marlowe’s wry first-person observations give readers a glimpse of his world view plus memorable lines to savor. To me, Philip Marlowe is the father of all fictional private eyes that follow. He is an old-school American hero. Without him, there never would have been a Rick Cahill.\n\nCurrently working on:\n\nThe next book in the Rick Cahill series.\n\nWords to live by:\n\nKeep your ass in the seat.\n\nAdvice for aspiring authors:\n\nWrite. Write every day. Write when it’s easy. Write when it’s difficult. And then revise.\n\nARTICLES AND REVIEWS\n\nLost Tomorrows:\n\nNew York Journal of Books review\n\nSanta Barbara New-Press review\n\nTimes of San Diego article\n\nWrong Light:\n\nSan Diego Union-Tribune interview\n\nBlood Truth:San Diego Union-Tribune interview\n\nForward Reviews review\n\nNight Tremors:\n\nSan Diego Union-Tribune interview"
