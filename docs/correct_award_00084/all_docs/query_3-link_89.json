        "text": "by Jo Gabel\n\nFor the truth to be light, your heart must feel merry. Then the truth reveals itself and, without being disturbing, it becomes liberating, especially when it is made of knowledge, study, passion! Sometimes even made of impetuosity, nevertheless it meets all people … and makes them smile.\n\nThis is the first thought that occurs to me when I hear that Dario Fo has died. And I think I shall not be capable to talk about this playwriter and his work without having the impression to limit the essence: a genuine artist, acrobat, enchanter; like a magic potion the hilarious fairy tales of his theatre will thrill forever.\n\nHis love for logic, for non elitist knowledge, all the trust that he put in what should have not been silenced, in his work aimed at not just to denounce but also to give hope, all these things are his happy freedom…\n\nI still cannot explain why last May I could not attend his seminary at Alcatraz (the city invented by his son Jacopo for the lovers of all arts). That would have been not just tutorials about theatre, since Dario Fò was not only a poliedric artist , playwriter, actor, singer, but also set designer, director, political activist and, as he liked to call himself, a jester.\n\nA wonderful opportunity lost forever. Perhaps the very first in my life that opens that chapter of things not done, that one would very much like to have done.\n\nWe should also have talked about his film project, a major one like many of his ideas.\n\nSurely I would have learnt the enthusiasm of those extraordinary plays that he reinvented every time. A scathing satire that he could push beyond a too often limited boundary line and in so doing he was soft and resounding at the same time: slowly revealing the truth for the audience and it would be clear to everyone that he was enjoying their astonishment.\n\nSuch is his work “Mistero buffo”, summary of the fundamental subjects of his theatre, where the lively oral tradition of the Po river people mingle with contemporary references and interpretative shrewdness. His ability to renew himself and be modern, at the same time always coherent, shows the deepness of his work; censorship at times imposed to his work and the charges against him, although preying him, could never discourage him.\n\n“Arresting the spread of knowledge is an instrument of control for the power since education means being able to read, interprete, being critical and not trusting what they tell you.Knowledge makes you to doubt, especially of the power, of any power”\n\nThe motivation of the Nobel prize award in 1997 went “ following the tradition of medieval jesters he mocks the power, restoring dignity to the oppressed” and we cannot forget his ability to transform reality in tales and in so doing he was educating. We have proof of this with his “canovacci”, that he could not stop to re-elaborate, in an improvisation game that makes the audience alert and attentive.\n\nAnd that’s why I keep thinking of those days in May that will never return.\n\nTogether with him we must remember Franca Rame, his life companion and wife, passed away three years ago, to whom he dedicated his whole work: they walked together along the streets of the world, creating, writing, performing and singing, just like wise but at the same time fool actors.\n\nListen to the monologue of Eve and Adamo that Franca had wanted in a female version: you can immediately perceive the meaning and the deepness of their relationship.\n\nEven in the last moments of his life, during those few days in hospital, Dario Fo found the strength to sing a song, so that the suffering and sorrow could not interfere with his desire of communicating or, perhaps, to enchant death. As he did so many times on the stage to ridicule the lie and cowardice, expressing himself such as he was: an icon in becoming, who will never stop to inspire, and whose gaiety has really conquered death:\n\n“There is an ancient rule in theatre: when you have completed your performance, there is no need to add a word, just say goodbye and think that those whose thought and word you have satisfied will be grateful. Ciao!”\n\nTo read the article in Italian, go to:"
