        "text": "Dario Fo, the Italian playwright and actor famous for his cutting political satires, has died in Milan at the age of 90.\n\nFo, whose plays include Accidental Death of an Anarchist and Can't Pay? Won't Pay!, won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1997.\n\nHe was also known for Mistero Buffo, a one-man play he travelled the world with for 30 years.\n\nHis plays often starred his actress wife Franca Rame.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, a target himself of Fo's sharp wit, remembered him on Thursday as \"one of the great protagonists of theatre, culture and the civic life of our country\".\n\nHe said: \"His satire, his research, his work on set design, his multi-faceted artistic activity remain the legacy of a great Italian in the world.\"\n\nBorn in March 1926 in Sangiano, a small town on Lake Maggiore, Fo learned the art of storytelling from his grandfather, a travelling salesman with a gift for spinning yarns.\n\nHe was conscripted towards the end of World War II but managed to escape, spending the last months of the war hidden in an attic.\n\nDario Fo thought the long Italian tradition of commedia dell'arte - broad, even slapstick humour - could be used to comment on modern society.\n\nHis work was filled with energy and political protest. He drew on the history of Italian theatre but became one of the most performed modern playwrights anywhere.\n\nHis early material was gentle enough, but Fo later became a sharp-eyed satirist of the Italian state and corruption. For years he was banned from Italian TV for his irreverence.\n\nHis radical politics meant he was twice prevented from entering the USA. Writers, among them Arthur Miller, protested at his exclusion.\n\nWhen Fo was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1997, the citation said he \"emulated the jesters of the Middle Ages in scourging authority and upholding the dignity of the downtrodden\".\n\nOn stage, Dario Fo made serious political points by being comic."
