        "text": "DARIO FO EVENT RESCHEDULED!!!\n\nThe exceptional workshops of Nobel Prize laureate, Dario Fo, curated by Francesca Bortoletti, in collaboration with Walter Valeri and ICC Board Members Anna Olivero and Massimo Bonavita, have been rescheduled in TWO meetings.\n\nA special guest, Mr. Chang Wang, will participate in the first workshop to discuss his \"accidental encounter with the Maestro\". Please view his articles on Dario Fo below, as published on Dario's website (in Italian and English), and by a local newspaper \"China Insight.\"\n\nhttp://www.chinainsight.info/culture/968-an-accidental-encounter-with-the-maestro.html\n\nhttp://www.dariofo.com/it/content/un-incontro-accidentale-con-il-maestro\n\nThe workshops will concentrate on Stage, Text and Tradition\n\nDates: March 7, and April 13, 2013.\n\nLocation: Hennepin Center for the Arts, Suite 502\n\nTime: 6:00 p.m.\n\nCost Per Workshop: Because of the schedule change, the first workshop will be offered free to members, and at a cost of $10 to ICC non-members.\n\nIn the first workshop, scheduled for March 7th, Francesca will focus on Dario Fo's acting work and his political and revolutionary theater. During the workshop, Mr. Wang, a new member of the ICC, will talk about his \"accidental encounter with the Maestro\" and will discuss Dario Fo and Franca Rame's political struggles and how they have been perceived in China.\n\nThe second workshop, set for April 13, will be held by special guest, Walter Valeri, a poet and writer who has long worked with Dario Fo and his wife, Franca Rame. The workshop will focus on Fo's acting career, techniques through video, and demonstration of the use of masks.\n\nPlease register via the provided Paypal link, and contact Peggy at info@theitalianculturalcenter.org with any questions.\n\nDario Fo, (born March 24, 1926, Leggiuno-Sangiano, Italy), Italian avant-garde playwright, manager-director, and actor-mime, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1997.\n\nFo’s first theatrical experience was collaborating on satirical revues for small cabarets and theaters. He and his wife, the actress Franca Rame, founded the Compagnia Dario Fo–Franca Rame in 1959, and their humorous sketches on the television show “Canzonissima” soon made them popular public personalities. They gradually developed an agitprop theater of politics, often blasphemous and scatological, but rooted in the tradition of \"Commedia dell’arte\" and blended with what Fo called “unofficial leftism.”\n\nIn 1968 Fo and Rame founded another acting group, Nuova Scena, with ties to the Italian Communist Party, and in 1970 they started the Collettivo Teatrale La Comune. They began to tour factories, parks, and gymnasiums.\n\nFo wrote about 70 plays, coauthoring some of them with Rame. Their works have been translated into more than 30 languages.\n\nAmong his most popular plays are Morte accidentale di un anarchico (1974; Accidental Death of an Anarchist) and Non si paga, non si paga! (1974; We Can’t Pay? We Won’t Pay!). As a performer, Fo is best known for his solo tour de force Mistero Buffo (1973; “Comic Mystery”), based on medieval mystery plays but so topical that the shows changed with each audience.\n\nAll events must be cancelled at least 72 hours in advance to receive a refund, less administrative costs.\n\n_________________________________________________"
