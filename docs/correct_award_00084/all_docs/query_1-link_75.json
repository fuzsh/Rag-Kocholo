The information in the country column is according to nobelprize.org, the official website of the Nobel Foundation. This information may not necessarily reflect the recipient's birthplace or citizenship.\n\nBob Dylan has won the 2016 Nobel Prize in literature. The prolific musician is the first Nobel winner to have forged a career primarily as a singer-songwriter. What's more, he's also the first American to have won the prize in more than two decades. Not since novelist Toni Morrison won in 1993 has an American claimed the prize.\n\nWhile many celebrated writers hail from this region of the planet, only six of them have earned the great honor of being Nobel prize in literature winners. Read this article to discover six Nobel prize-winning Latin American authors and their books.\n\nAs reported by the Associated Press, Horace Engdahl, the permanent secretary of the academy, said the decision to award Coatzee with the prize was easy. \"We were very much convinced of the lasting value of his contribution to literature. I'm not speaking of the number of books, but the variety, and the very high average quality,\" he said. \"I think he is a writer ... that will continue to be discussed and analyzed and we think he should belong to our literary heritage.\"\n\nIn its press announcement, the Swedish Academy also praised Coetzee for \"his intellectual honesty [which] erodes all basis of consolation and distances itself from the tawdry drama of remorse and confession.\"\n\nGl√Éck is also one of the few women honored with the literature prize. She is the fourth woman to receive the award since 2010. Only 16 women have won the Literature Prize since the Nobel awards began in 1901.\n\nHer poetry is \"characterized by a striving for clarity,\" often focusing on childhood and family life, and close relationship with parents and siblings, it said.\n\nIt noted her 2006 collection \"Averno,\" calling it \"masterly\" and \"a visionary interpretation of the myth of Persephone's descent into hell in the captivity of Hades, the god of death.\"\n\nThe award, which includes a 10 million kronor (more than $1.1 million) prize, comes after several years of controversy and scandal for the world's pre-eminent literary accolade.\n\nIn 2018 the award was postponed after sex abuse allegations rocked the Swedish Academy, the secretive body that chooses the winners, and sparked a mass exodus of members.\n\nAfter the academy revamped itself in a bid to regain the trust of the Nobel Foundation, two laureates were named last year, with the 2018 prize going to Poland's Olga Tokarczuk and the 2019 award to Austria's Peter Handke.\n\nHandke's prize caused a storm of protest: a strong supporter of the Serbs during the 1990s Balkan wars, he has been called an apologist for Serbian war crimes. Several countries including Albania, Bosnia and Turkey boycotted the Nobel awards ceremony in protest, and a member of the committee that nominates candidates for the literature prize resigned.\n\nOn Monday, the Nobel Committee awarded the prize for physiology and medicine for discovering the liver-ravaging hepatitis C virus. Tuesday's prize for physics honored breakthroughs in understanding the mysteries of cosmic black holes, and the chemistry prize on Wednesday went to scientists behind a powerful gene-editing tool.\n\nStill to come are prizes are for outstanding work in the fields of peace and economics.\n\nThe Nobel prize is a prestigious award that has been around for over a century. It is given to individuals who have made outstanding contributions in the fields of physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace. In recent years, the award has also been given to economics, though this was not originally one of the categories. This list includes some of the most brilliant minds of our time, who have made significant contributions in their field and have helped change the world as we know it.\n\nDerek Walcott was born in 1930 in Castries, Saint Lucia. He is a Black man who has won the Nobel prize for literature. Walcott's parents were both of mixed African and European descent. His father worked as a minor civil servant while his mother was a homemaker. Derek Walcott was educated at the local Methodist school and then at St. Mary's College. After graduating from high school, he attended the University of the West Indies on a scholarship.\n\nThe literature prize has had other brushes with controversy, including complaints that the award committee has too often favored European writers. Last year, two literature prizes were handed out, one for 2019 and a belated one for 2018, following a sexual harassment scandal that engulfed the committee and forced organizers to postpone naming the 2018 winner.\n\nThe 2016 literature prize granted to American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan sharply divided opinion over whether a popular musician should be given an award that had been largely the domain of novelists and playwrights.\n\nHe is the first American to win the Nobel literature prize since Morrison in 1993, and his award probably hurts the chances of such older American writers as Philip Roth and Don DeLillo, since the Nobel judges try to spread the honors around.\n\nDylan is the most unorthodox Nobel literature prize winner since 1997, when the award went to Italian playwright Dario Fo, whose works some say also need to be performed to be fully appreciated. By a sad coincidence, Fo died Thursday at 90.\n\nThe Swedish Academy will announce the winner of the Nobel Literature Prize on Thursday, amid critics' charges that anti-American bias was blocking literary figures such as Philip Roth from clinching the award.\n\nThe list of nominees is never disclosed, leaving observers to speculate wildly up until the moment the Academy's permanent secretary Horace Engdahl announces the laureate at 1:00 pm (1100 GMT).\n\nIn the run-up to this year's prize announcement, French novelist Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio has been widely tipped to win in Stockholm literary circles, while Romanian-born German author Herta Mueller and South Korean poet Ko Un also figure among the favourites.\n\nIn recent days however, Swedish media have hotly debated comments Engdahl made in an interview with a US news outlet in which he criticised American writers for being too influenced by their own popular culture.\n\nHe also said that Europe, in his mind, remained the centre of the literary world.\n\nIn another interview with British daily The Guardian, Engdahl attempted to smooth over the controversy by insisting that \"it is of no importance, when we judge American candidates, how any of us views American literature as a whole in comparison with other literatures.\"\n\n\"The Nobel prize is not a contest between nations but an award to individual authors,\" he said.\n\nSome Swedish literary critics have suggested that Engdahl's initial inflammatory remarks may simply have been a smokescreen to hide the fact that this year's prize will go to an American author like Roth, Joyce Carol Oates or Don DeLillo.\n\nUnlike with the other Nobel prizes, Americans have in recent years rarely landed the prestigious Literature Prize. The last US citizen to take the honours was Toni Morrison in 1993.\n\nThe vast majority of the literature laureates have been Europeans, with last year's prize going to British novelist Doris Lessing.\n\nIn order to second-guess the committee, some observers point to continents, countries or languages, as well as genres that have not been awarded for a while.\n\nSouth America and Africa are continents that have not had a literature laureate in a while, so if the Academy is thinking along those lines possible winners could be Mexico's Carlos Fuentes, Peru's Mario Vargas Llosa or Assia Djebar of Algeria.\n\nItaly's Antonio Tabucchi, Israeli Amos Oz, Haruki Murakami of Japan, Australian Les Murray and Syrian poet Adonis are other names making the rounds.\n\nAs last year, online betting site Ladbrokes singled out Italian essayist Claudio Magris as a clear favorite in the run-up to the announcement, ahead of Adonis, Oz and Oates to receive the Nobel gold medal, a diploma and 10 million Swedish kronor (1.42 million dollars, 1.02 million euros).\n\n5. Middle East. Countries in the Middle East have received 22 Nobel Prizes, with more than half (12) of the awards going to Israeli laureates. Of the 22 Nobel laureates from the Middle East, more than half (12) received either the literature (3) or peace prize (9). For the remaining 10 Nobel Prizes in medicine, chemistry, physics, and economics, 8 of those laureates were Israeli, one is Egyptian (chemistry) and one is Turkish (chemistry).\n\nNote that 33 of the 57 female laureates received a Nobel Prize for either literature or peace, and those two categories together represent 58% of the total female Nobel laureates. This year, four of the 11 laureates are female: Andrea Ghez for physics, Emmanuelle Charpentier, and Jennifer A. Doudna for chemistry, and Louise Gluck for literature. The record for the most Nobel prizes awarded to women in a single year was set in 2009 when there were five female laureates out of 13 total.\n\n38c6e68cf9"
