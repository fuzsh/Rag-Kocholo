        "text": "This is the motto that accompanied the long journey of the eclectic Dario Fo, artist at three hundred and sixty degrees e Nobel Prize for literature in 1997. Born under a lucky star, he began to play with words from an early age, when as a child he came into contact with children from foreign realities who have difficulty understanding the Italian language.\n\nOn stage in the theater and in life\n\nTo make himself understood, Dario uses onomatopoeias and neologisms, re-elaborates thoughts with his imagination and filters them through a skilful use of the word. Later this children's game grows, evolves and lays the foundations of the expressive style embodied in the famous grammelot: a linguistic invention with dialectal voices from the north that are combined with onomatopoeic words, therefore based on sound. Non-existent words, completely invented, but which communicate the author's thought in a masterly way. The Funny Mystery, an excellent work that owes a lot to Dario's fame and which winks at religious satire.\n\nBut what makes Dario Fo a man so popular?\n\nA very multifaceted personality, it would be difficult to point out merits that concern only one field. He was born as a painter and juggler of words, evolves into man of show, playwright e notes until he took over the reins of his theater company. He engages in politics in the Soccorso Rosso Militant and after the armistice of 1943 he enlisted as a volunteer in the Italian Social Republic, raising criticism and controversy. Dario is a little bit of everything. And to complete it, his soul mate takes care of it, Franca Rame.\n\nThey know each other as kids and, given Franca's beauty, Dario thinks it's not within his reach. Certainly she doesn't think so when they get married in 1954. Love surprises him behind the scenes just before going on stage and from there they will never leave. Dario lives in complete harmony with his sweetheart, sharing the stage, political militancy, life.\n\nOn stage in the theater and in life\n\nAtheist through and through, he firmly believes in the potential of comedy and laughter as a weapon against injustice and oppression, elements already present in the first play The finger in the eye, made with four hands with the irreplaceable Franca. Dario Fo in his plays he always says what he thinks, and perhaps he does it too much. Censorship targets him several times, but he is not discouraged and goes on with his ideas. Lover of Italy and a little less of its politics, \"You do it!\" it is the cry he sends out to young people as an invitation to change, a change in which he has always believed but which unfortunately he has not witnessed.\n\nThe disappearance of his wife in old age creates a rift in the life of Dario, who abandons us only three years later, however, leaving a rich legacy to our country. Man of art and culture endowed with great humility and promoter of a writing that went far beyond the Alps, Dario Fo said several times that he forgot he received a Nobel Prize for literature, I hope we will not do the same."
