        "text": "Press Quotes\n\n“The pieces are comic, grotesque, on purpose. First of all because we women have been crying for two thousand years. So let’s laugh now, even at ourselves. And also because a certain gentleman of the theatre, who knew a lot, a certain Molière, used to say: When you go to the theatre and see a tragedy, you identify, empathise, cry, cry, cry, then go home and say, ‘What a good cry I had tonight,’ and you have a good night’s sleep. The social significance went by like water over glass. But for us to provoke you to laughter … you have to have a brain, you have to be alert … to laugh you throw open your mouth and also your brain and into your brain are hammered the nails of reason.” —Franca Rame\n\n“Set at the point where reality and ideology rub up against each other, [these] monologues are vivid, concise and entertaining comments on the female condition … comic-but-angry, raw-but-precise.” —The Independent (London)\n\n“… buoyant, angry and vitally funny monologues … the evening becomes a rich human comedy of the sexes. Even as the women rail against their male oppressors, they see the bigger picture — their own contradictions and absurdities, the social forces that grind down men and women alike, the whole messy business of living with the alien other gender.” —Steven Winn, S F Gate\n\n“Subversive wit and theatrical extravagance.” —L A Weekly\n\n“Funny and lusty.” —L A Times"
