        "text": "Wow. There wasn’t a whole lot of suspense in the NCAA Tournament regional semifinal games played Friday night, was there?\n\nI thought there was a distinct possibility that a couple of the games could fall into the “blowout” category.\n\nI nailed one of them – Kansas over a 12 seed, Villanova, 72-57, in the Midwest Regional in Detroit.\n\nAnd I thought there could be another in Detroit, as well.\n\nThere was. But I think I was joined by most of those in the world’s population who gave the matter any thought in assuming it would be Wisconsin cruising past 10 seed Davidson, not vice versa, 73-56.\n\nAnd I expected both semifinals in the South Regional in Houston to be tight and competitive affairs.\n\nOne of them was – for about 29 minutes, that is.\n\nNo. 3 seed Stanford managed to cut its deficit to No. 2 Texas to a point with 11 minutes to go.\n\nAnd then the D.J. Augustin-led guard patrol proceeded to slice and dice the Cardinal defense up for a 30-11 run to close out things, 82-62.\n\nAs for the second game, Memphis and Michigan State, so many pundits were picking Michigan State to win – including someone you may have caught on ESPN or in pizza or chicken wings establishment television ads a time or two, Dick Vitale – that some begin to forget that it was the Memphis Tigers who were the No. 1 seed and took a 35-1 record into the game.\n\nThis is how overwhelming John Calipari’s Memphis team was for most of the game against the Spartans:\n\nMichigan State had a 16-0 run through the second half. And it only served to cut its deficit to 18 points before the Tigers won, 92-74.\n\nSo we’re into the regional finals, UCLA versus Xavier (West) and North Carolina versus Louisville (East) today, and Kansas versus Davidson (Midwest) and Memphis versus Texas (South) Sunday.\n\nIt means that all four No. 1 seeds (the Bruins, Tar Heels, Jayhawks and Tigers) are still in position to advance to the Final Four for the first time ever.\n\nAnd it means that only one true Cinderella-type team, Davidson, remains in the field.\n\nAs well as sophomore guard Stephen Curry, who played Friday night in Detroit (33 points, dropping his tournament average, amazingly enough, to 34.3), the Wildcats demonstrated once again, in the win over the Big Ten champion Badgers, that they are far from a one-man team riding his velvety jump shot to within a Sunday afternoon win against Kansas of a spot in the Final Four.\n\nJason Richards leads the nation in assists (but you knew that already, right?) and offers a nice blend of creativity and precision in running Coach Bob McKillop’s offense.\n\nAndrew Lovedale and Thomas Sanders are solid rebounders and post defenders, who also do a great deal of the screening that Curry so patiently maneuvers his way around.\n\nSo the Wildcats are 29-6 and just one more upset – albeit, a biggie against the region’s top seed, Kansas – away from becoming “America’s favorite” (at least in those parts of the USA not also represented in San Antonio) next weekend.\n\nAnd anyone who followed the nearly endless in-print, on-line and on-air speculation in February and early March concerning which teams were likely “in the tournament” (as an at-large selection, assuming they didn’t win a conference tournament for the automatic bid) knows that Davidson’s status was a subject of much debate.\n\nAlthough the Wildcats went 20-0 in regular-season Southern Conference play, some who play the “they’re in/they’re not” game felt Davidson’s spotless conference record wouldn’t mean a thing to the NCAA Tournament Committee come time to fill out the 65-team field with the 34 at-large selections.\n\nIn reeling off wins over Gonzaga, Georgetown and Wisconsin, the Wildcats have done a pretty good job of supporting that position, haven’t they?"
