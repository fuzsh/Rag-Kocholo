        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1) gene encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor of 59 kilo Daltons (kDa), a nuclear protein that contains three zinc fingers of the Cys2His2 subtype. The EGR1 GC-rich consensus sequence, 5’-GCG(T/G)GGGCG-3’ and 5’-TCC(T/A)CCTCCTCC-3’, have been identified in the promoter regions of genes for transcription factors that mediate cell growth, differentiation, or apoptosis (1–3). EGR1 can compete with the transcription factor SP1, which binds to extremely GC-rich sequences (so called ‘SP’ box), and is involved in the constitutive expression of housekeeping genes (4, 5). Because the consensus sequence for SP1 and EGR1 binding overlaps, EGR1 often displaces SP1 from gene promoters (6, 7). The gene targets mediated by Egr1 in response to ionizing radiation (IR) include TNFα, p53, Rb and Bax, effectors of apoptosis. Based on these, Egr1 is a pivotal gene that initiates signal transduction events in response to IR leading to either growth arrest or cell death in tumor cells. EGR1 also controls tissue repair, wound healing, fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and other stress-related responses (2). Finally, EGR1 regulates cell response to hypoxia, promotes the formation of new blood vessels, and triggers tumor angiogenesis (2).\n\nThe transcriptional activity of EGR1 is inhibited through direct interaction with the NFGI-A-binding proteins named NAB1 and NAB2 (8). Mice lacking both Nab1 and Nab2 show severe congenital hypomyelination of peripheral nerves, with Schwann cell development arresting at the promyelinating stage (8). Their expression is also inducible, albeit delayed in comparison to Egr1 induction (8), creating an early negative feedback to ensure that the Egr1 activity is transient. Hence deregulated expression of NAB proteins in disease may contribute to alteration of EGR1 function. For instance, elevated expression of NAB2 in endothelial cells reduces angiogenesis whereas loss of NAB2 in prostate cancer contributes to increased EGR1 activity (9).\n\nEGR1 protects normal cells from transformation by inducing apoptosis or growth arrest upon DNA damage (1–3). A strong evidence for EGR1’s pro-apoptotic activity is that Egr1−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) are resistant to apoptosis induced by IR (10, 11). Although Egr1-deficient mice do not spontaneously develop tumors, they show accelerated tumor growth in a two-step carcinogenesis model of skin cancer (12). UV-B radiation of keratinocytes induces EGR1 expression through activation of NF-κB (p65/RelA), which mediates apoptosis and acts as a protection mechanism against the tumorigenic effect of UV-B. These observations support the hypothesis that EGR1 inhibits the growth of DNA damage-induced tumors. Thus EGR1 has been considered to be a tumor suppressor gene rather than an oncogene (10-13; reviewed in 14; ).\n\nTwo independent mechanisms, i.e. the induction of the epithelial cell suppressor TGFβ1 and induction of p53 family proteins, have been pointed out to explain the tumor-suppressive properties of EGR1 (14, 15; ). Numerous other genes that affect cell growth such as Insulin-like Growth Factors (IGFs), TGFβ, Fibronectin, PDGF, PTEN, WT1, Dmp1, Arf, and p53 genes have consensus sequences for EGR1 on the promoter suggesting direct binding of EGR1 and transactivation (14–21). Both the Dmp1 and Arf promoters have binding sites for Egr1/2/3 (19; ) and our microarray analysis has shown that Egr1 is a target for Dmp1 (20). It has thus been hypothesized that Egr1 participates in the regulation of tumor suppressor gene networks involving these proteins, especially Dmp1, Arf, and p53 ( ). Any defects in this network may lead to the unopposed action of EGR1 on TGFβ1 that favors tumor progression. In this review, we discuss the importance of these molecules that have potential tumor suppressive activities.\n\nDmp1, a cyclin D binding myb-like protein 1 (Dmp1; also called Dmtf1), was originally isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a murine T-lymphocyte library with cyclin D2 as bait (23, 24; 25-29 for reviews). Dmp1 physically interacts with any of the three D-type cyclins, each of which can inhibit its ability to bind to DNA (23, 24). Biological studies indicated that overexpression of Dmp1 causes cell cycle arrest in NIH 3T3 cells, the activity of which was attenuated by D-type cyclins independent of Cdks (24). Dmp1 (Dmp1α) shows its activity as a tumor suppressor by directly binding to the Arf promoter to activate its gene expression, and thereby induces Arf- and p53-dependent cell cycle arrest (19, 30, 31; 32–36 for Ink4a/Arf reviews). Other transcriptional targets for Dmp1 include CD13/APN (37), Areg, Thbs1, JunB, and Egr1 (20), suggesting that it is involved in signal transduction, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. The activity of the Arf-53 pathway is significantly subverted in Dmp1-deficient cells since they can easily give rise to immortalized cell lines that retain wild type p19Arf and wild type p53 and are transformed by oncogenic Ras alone (38, 39). The murine Dmp1 promoter is activated by oncogenic Ras as well as by constitutively active MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in primary culture cells (19). Thus, Dmp1 is a key mediator between Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK mitogenic signaling and the Arf-p53 tumor suppressor pathway. Both Dmp1 and Arf mRNA levels decrease at S-G2/M phase of the cell cycle since promoters are repressed by mitogenic signals mediated by E2Fs (40). Both promoters are repressed by and genotoxic signals mediated mainly the p65 subunit of by NF-κB (41). Dmp1 (Dmp1α) physically interacts with p53 to neutralize all the activities of Mdm2 on p53, indicating that this is the secondary mechanism of tumor surveillance in Arf-deficient cells (42, 43). Recent studies show that Dmp1 also transactivates p16Ink4a although the effect is less than stimulation of Arf (44, 45).\n\nBoth Dmp1−/− and Dmp1+/− mice are prone to tumor development when neonatally treated with dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) or by IR (38, 39). Tumors induced by the Eμ-Myc (39), K-RasLA (46), neuNT (activated mutant) (47), or cyclin D1 (44) transgene were greatly accelerated in both Dmp1+/− and Dmp1−/− background with no differences between groups lacking one or two Dmp1 alleles, suggesting a haploid-insufficiency of Dmp1 in tumor suppression (29, 39). Moreover, tumors from Eμ-Myc, K-RasLA, or MMTV-neuNT mice rarely show p53 mutation or Arf deletion, indicating that Dmp1 is a physiological regulator of the Arf-p53 pathway in vivo (39, 46, 47). The details of tumor-prone phenotypes in Dmp1-deficient mice, and the mechanisms for tumor suppression, their roles in human cancer are discussed in this review."
