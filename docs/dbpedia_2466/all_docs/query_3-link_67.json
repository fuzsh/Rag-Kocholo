        "text": "Colin Hoare, 1959-62\n\nWhat Exeter University Football meant to me\n\nBefore arriving at Exeter, I had been forced to play rugby at school, until the school allowed hockey as an alternative. Rugby was a game that never appealed, and my goalkeeping “experience” consisted mostly from “pick-up” Sunday afternoon games on the local village green.\n\nMy first year at Exeter, I was the University hockey goalkeeper – there being no competition for the position. It was not a strong team, and the win-loss record was pretty abysmal. At the end of the season, the football club happened to be looking for someone to keep goal in the third eleven fixture for a Wednesday afternoon league game. I mentioned that I was interested, and Brian Guscott (one of the first team players), who was playing as well, arranged for me to be selected (masquerading as T. G.). We won the game 3-2, and both Brian, along with other players, were so impressed with my goalkeeping that he said I should try out for the football first team for the 1960-61 season, as the incumbent (T. Y.) was off for a year-long sabbatical in France.\n\nI had never received any coaching (at that time, training players for that position was non-existent), so I bought a copy of a book in the (probably now long-forgotten) “Teach Yourself” series – the one dedicated to football. That proved to be pretty much useless, as the chapter on goalkeeping was pathetic.\n\nKeep in mind, the total enrolment at the University at that time was in the region of 1,600 students, but the football team itself had, despite these low numbers, at least six schoolboy county players. Not enough to make a strong team for the first season, as we lost all three U. A. U. Southern Region games to Bristol, Reading & Southampton (more of the Reading game later).\n\nPrior to the start of the season the U. A. U. also announced it was running a pre-season week-long camp, with the Loughborough Colleges coach, Alan Wade, as coach. I signed up (the only student from Exeter). It was not a great success, as Alan admitted when I got there that “he did not know very much about goalkeeping!”\n\nAnyway, we also had a pre-season session on Top Field (it was grass at the time), and again, as the only candidate for the position, I was selected. I played all but two games, having been dropped, replaced by T. G., and then back in the squad after two games as T. G. liked weekend hiking on the Devon Moors, and decided this was his preferred way of spending a Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe following season, the team was strengthened by the arrival of some more strong players, notably Tim Brown, who had had a trial with Burnley. T. Y. was back as well. Again, there was a pre-season training session – and again I was the only goalkeeper who showed up. Knowing that there might be more competition, I had embarked on a fitness training session at home for a few weeks, and played several games for one of our local teams.\n\nAnother challenger also arrived (A. C.), who was a serious competitor. Nevertheless, I retained my place – but again was dropped at one point, to be replaced by A. C. Unfortunately (for him), he broke his wrist in a pre-game warm-up, so I was back.\n\nThis time, we defeated Bristol & Southampton, and tied with Reading, so we were through to the U. A. U. Semi-final for the first time ever.\n\nWe were drawn at home to Loughborough Colleges, a side that had eliminated Maidenhead United 4-0 the previous Saturday in the F. A. Amateur Cup. They were so confident of beating this upstart competitor that their coach, Alan Wade (again) did not make the trip to the West Country, but instead left the running of the team to Bob Wilson – yes, that Bob Wilson who later played for Arsenal and Scotland, had a long career in broadcasting, and wrote “You’ve got to be crazy: Bob Wilson on goalkeepers and goalkeeping.”\n\nWe had a couple of advantages, however: Gras Lawn. A sloping pitch that was very short, and we had about 100 supporters (at least 95 more than usual). The team played extremely well, and indeed, almost won the game. Our very fast striker, John Balson put the ball in the net twice, only to have both goals cancelled as the referee ruled he was offside (John always averred that he was not).\n\nThe final score was 0-0, so we had to replay at Loughborough. Prior to travelling to Leicestershire, a friendly was arranged against the Fourth Division home side of Exeter City. Before the kick-off, the player-manager (whose name escapes me) said to Brian Wood, our captain: “Of course, you have got to expect to lose six or seven nothing.” We did lose, but by the far more respectable score of 3-2.\n\nAt Loughborough, we again held our own until just over halfway into the second half, when a controversial penalty kick was awarded against us. Loughborough scored, and then added two more in the dying minutes to run out 3-0 winners.\n\nSadly, this was the last time the team played together.\n\nThe only games I played after that were in the inter-hall competition, where I played for Kilmorie (now long gone). I picked up an injury when I was kicked in the shoulder by a rugby player in the Semi-final, and could not play against Bradninch in the Final T. Y. took my place – and played a proverbial ‘blinder.’\n\nMost memorable moments\n\nWhen you are a goalkeeper, there are memorable moments that are negative and positive. The first Reading game was my nightmare game: it was played on Guy Fawkes Day 1960, and my performance that day can best be described as a damp squib. On the plus side, however, the two U. A. U. Semi-final games against Loughborough Colleges (as it was then) in 1962 were among the finest of my career. There were others as well, and the team we had in 1961-62 played some great games.\n\nLife post Exeter\n\nI left for Canada immediately after graduation, and my participation in football continued for another two decades. I played for Canadair, a team in Montreal, for a couple of seasons. Because of the severe winters, both cricket & football are played at the same time – May to September/October. In contrast to the quality pitches in England, the fields are hopelessly overused, with very little grass. They are also rock hard. Even wearing padded shorts, diving to make saves & collect balls took its toll. Two knee cartilage replacements in my twenties, and one total knee replacement in my sixties is proof!\n\nI retired from playing and took up refereeing for two decades. Plenty of games over that time, including two years as an Assistant Referee in the North American Soccer League. The most memorable game was when Pele came to Montreal (still as a player with Santos) for an Exhibition game against an Italian side.\n\nI also got a compliment from F. I. F. A. when I contacted them to point out that the diagram for the pitch in the current Rule Book had an error: the flag at the halfway line positioned on the line itself, instead of being one meter outside. Thousands of copies had been published in many languages – and no-one else had told them.\n\nAnother area in which I was involved was in administration. For six years, I was the President of the Metropolitan Soccer League in Montreal.\n\nFinally, I got into freelance broadcasting for two years. A local radio station, CJAD, picked up the broadcasting rights for Montreal Le Manic for 1982-1983. I sent in my résumé (I had also plenty of acting experience), and landed the position of colour commentator. My employer was willing to let me do the job, as it did not interfere with my regular work. I saw more of North America then than I had before!\n\nSadly, that was it – well, not quite. My company relocated to Toronto, and I got a three-month TV stint as host of “World Soccer Report” on a local TV station. Unfortunately, the ratings did not justify keeping the programme, so it did not last very long – just three months.\n\nDavid Green, 1966-69\n\n3rd XI photograph:\n\nBack row L to R: Ian Parry, TBC, Vance Gallagher, Sam Twiston – Davies, Chris Williams, Ian Stratford, Tony May, Brian Lancaster\n\nFront Row L to R: Peter Clyst, Ian Pateman, Pete Wyatt, David Green ( Capt, Charlie Lawrence, Paul Bateman, Dave Templeton\n\nDavid says: \"The trophy in this photo is for the league championship of the Devon and Exeter Division 2 East for 1968-69.

I particularly remember the match against Princeton University as it was filmed, so we watched the game afterwards in the clubhouse - the first time for many of us that we had actually seen ourselves in action! This picture is from the match against Cornell University which in many ways was the highlight of the tour. The match itself was played in the evening under floodlights by which time there were several thousand people in the stadium. They had expected to do well against us, but we produced a brilliant performance to win by 7-3.\n\nThe line-up was:\n\nBack - Alan Young, Phil Chamberlain, Dave Whitney, Mickey Smith, Dick Head, Terry Phillips, Micky Clarkson, Andy Childs.\n\nFront - John Gilbert, Ian Murray, Martin Oakes, Steve Perkins, Tony May, Rob Thomas, Simon Dobbs.\n\nColin Appleby was also on the tour and I think taking the photograph.\"\n\nJohn Gilbert, 1969-72\n\nWhat Exeter University Football meant to me\n\nMy entry point into men’s football from under 18s football and having to learn / adapt quickly in the uncompromising Devon Leagues before playing in University 1st X1 football.\n\nMeeting fellow student footballers several of whom became lifelong friends and extending the Exeter University playing experience in and around London over three decades.\n\nExperience of both playing but also running a football club and having to deal with many on and off the field issues.\n\nEnjoying the banter, fun, comradeship and competitiveness that playing in a team brings especially at Gras Lawn before and after big UAU matches. Also the singalongs coming back by coach from long distance away trips.\n\nBecoming a good friend of Ted Wragg who helped me organise Exeter’s first US football tour in September 1972 and whose love of the Club over many years from the touchline inspired many generations of students.\n\nAlways enjoying returning for a number of alumni matches.\n\nMost memorable moments\n\nBeating Cornell University 7-3 under floodlights in their large on-campus stadium and partying well into the night at the local Holiday Inn. Some textbook goals that will long remain in the memory. September 1972 including a hat-trick from captain Martin Oakes.\n\nLosing 7-1 to Ajax Under 18s inspired by Johann Neeskins at their Amsterdam training ground (outside the main stadium where we changed) in April 1970 after scoring first before the floodlights came on!\n\nWitnessing two of the hardest shots of my playing career – a free-kick by Malaysian player Lan Harun in October 1971 that was hit with such ferocity that the Essex University wall all ducked as the ball hit the back of the net in an 8-2 win and former Grasshoppers junior Ian Murray lashing in a half volley at Clyst Hydon that the referee said he had never seen a football hit so hard.\n\nScoring with a long range header beating the Bath UAU keeper to draw level 4-4 towards the end of a fractious match against Bath University that saw Exeter down to ten men March 1971.\n\nBeating St Luke’s 1st XI 5-2 having gone behind in a friendly December 1970.\n\nScoring 2 vital goals that helped the 2nd X1 win the Devon & Exeter League at the end of the 1969-70 season at Newton Rangers, Torbay.\n\nWinning the Crediton 6-a-side tournament in June 1971 scoring 2 goals in the final.\n\nReturning on several playing reunion occasions, the last of which was in 2001 when a team averaging around aged 50 played a pre-season match not against fellow veterans but a warm up against the University 1st X1 at Duckes Meadow. Fortunately the pitch was dry, bouncy and compact and the ball often went far out of play. Half time the score was 0-0 and in the first 20 minutes of the 2nd half the Alumni team went 2-0 up with 2 well executed goals from Dave Whitney and Charlie Hawker. Eventually the fitness of the students told and ended up 4-2 winners but a great game for many to prolong and end their Exeter playing football memories. Ted Wragg made an appearance as a sub for the University 1st X1.\n\nLife post Exeter\n\nM.Sc at Birmingham University playing 1st X1 football & cricket before moving to London and a career in international banking with postings to Hong Kong (where 2 seasons were spent playing for HKFC in professional league, although amateur club) & Australia. In the mid-1990s set up a business research consultancy based in Wimbledon and holiday cottage business in Devon.\n\nFormer Chairman & Trustee of The Change Foundation (formerly Cricket 4 Change) a charity using sport and dance to change the lives of disadvantaged children in the UK and abroad from 2005-16.\n\nAlways kept in touch with former Exeter sporting alumni and with Rod Alexander (History 1971) established the Exeter University Alumni Golf Society (EUAGS) in 2005 that has run up to 4 events every year with some 300+ alumni attending one or more event & raised some £100,000 towards golf scholarships and equipment. EUGC 2019-20 No 1 ranked UK university. Sit on The Alumni Network Group Board.\n\nRoger Peek, 1963-1967\n\nBefore describing the Football Club in the early sixties a quick bit of history to give some context. I applied to Exeter in 1962 to start in the academic year 1963/64. This was the first year that UCCA existed; you put down 4 Universities with a fifth reserve. Before that one made individual applications to all 17 Universities (excluding Oxford, Cambridge, London & the Scottish Universities); if you lived in the South East and were struggling to get a place then you applied in descending order to Cardiff, Swansea, Bangor and Aberystwyth. Exeter was the last of the old University Colleges of London to get its charter in 1956 and become a university in its own right. Leicester, Southampton, Nottingham, and Keele all gained their charters a few years before Exeter.\n\nContinue reading Roger's memories\n\nJack Parry, 1966-70\n\nWhat Exeter University football meant to me:\n\nFriendship, confirmation that I was only an average goalkeeper!\n\nMost memorable moments:\n\nBreaking the leg (above the knee!) of the North Taunton centre forward – watching the ambulance crew trying to fit an inflatable splint to his leg.\n\nLong trips to Brighton, London, Reading etc and getting back to Exeter at about 2-3am on a Sunday morning.\n\nLift post Exeter:\n\nContinued playing football until 39 years old.\n\nA lovely wife, 2 beautiful children and 3 grandchildren.\n\nTony Charles, 1967-70\n\nWhat Exeter University football meant to me:\n\nGreat times with great players.

Along with my contemporaries, we had filled in the U.C.C.A. paperwork which asked us to list our three top choices of university. In the tense wait afterwards, we nervously sat back to see which one would respond. Thankyou Exeter, for the gift of an entry place!\n\nThe trepidation of beginning an unknown future in an unknown town was slightly relieved by discovering that a fellow ‘Chis & Sid’ export was also headed to Exeter and he a footballer, er, to boot. This was Steve Neale (English faculty fresher) and soon to be an early member (goalkeeper) of the University 3rds team like myself. Taking the express train from Waterloo, I arrived at Exeter St Davids station and was kindly helped on the last leg to Raddon House hall of residence by a kind third-year student taxi-ing me in his open-topped sports car. In these days, the University contrived to ensure we freshers got one of the limited number of places in the halls. Raddon was very close to the railway shunting yards so the rattling clang of wagons, especially at night, was ever present.\n\nScanning the Devonshire House sports notice board, located just outside The Ram bar, we soon spotted an open invitation to attend a ‘trials’ session where, we hoped, selection for the University’s numerous teams would result. In an effort to make sure I got noticed in the trials, I quickly went into Exeter town and bought a football shirt in Newcastle United’s colours. Someone must have spotted me (being six foot two inches helped) as my name appeared in the next University 3rds fixture. I forget who the first match was against but it would have been one of the many Devon village teams.\n\nAttired in the University’s renowned all-green colours, we played our home matches at the big Duckes Meadow complex beside the river Exe, or at Gras Lawn. The coach journeys to away matches always started from outside Devonshire House and were a jovial, often hilarious, event due to our captain, Vance Gallagher, an English Literature (2nd year) student. Vance came from Rochdale and conducted the team in raucous, out-of-tune singing and endless comic one-liners. The other names that return to memory from 55 years ago include, Pete Mountain (who roomed next to me in Raddon), Bob Dodd (Social Studies student who took over the goalkeeping from Steve Neale), tall scouser Andy Childs, Johnny Harrison (theology student), Kim Nguyen (a centre-forward who wore his long, jet-black locks in a bandana), Martin Quinn (a Geordie) and big winger Alan Pain.\n\nThe 3rds team regularly won at places such as Okehampton, Pinhoe, Exmouth, Clyst St Mary, and Crediton. Of these, three matches in particular stand out. One was against a RAF radar lookout-post’s team stationed on the wind-battered headland of Hartland Point. Where did we change kit? In a literal pig-sty! Another match was against RAF Chivenor on the river Taw in the north of the county. Here we were well beaten by the ultra-fit aircraft squad but the abiding memory is of the (literally) deafening jets taxi-ing on the runway just yards away. The poor referee’s whistle was rendered pointless and a bizarre kind of semaphore was adopted between all concerned to indicate infringements and decisions! The third match I recall was in the grounds of what was then titled a ‘mental institution’ and play was once or twice interrupted by some poor lost souls deciding to meander across the muddy pitch while we were actually in play.\n\nIt was while playing for the 3rds that I first met someone who played a big role in my soccer time at Exeter. This was Johnny Gilbert, later to become a long-time stalwart among University alumni. I clearly recall crossing the football for Johnny to score with a low header while he was actually leaning away from goal. If that sounds strange, I can best explain how he scored by saying that it was an exact replica of Ian St John’s FA Cup winner at Wembley in 1965 (try Youtube).\n\nWithin a term or so of being resident at Raddon, I decided to move out. In truth, I was a lonely, ill-at-ease lad for much of the time, so set off down Pennsylvania Road one desperate day and just walked and walked... Purely by chance, opposite a grocery store in Mount Pleasant Road there was a row of three-storey flats-cum-digs. Here, at no.104, I discovered there lived a landlady, Mrs Barton, a Dutch woman with her teenage son Richard. She explained her rent terms and I instantly accepted, becoming much happier with life. Even better, I soon discovered that Johnny Gilbert was in lodgings just a few yards away and he and Steve Perkins (another footballer) occasionally invited me round to watch BBC’s Match of the Day. ‘Mrs B’ would look after me like a son for three years and I even helped wallpaper three floors of no. 104 in return.\n\nIt is now 1971 and your correspondent is elevated to the University 2nds team. I spent my time as either central defender or midfield and the standard of play was definitely rising. The names from this era included big Tony May (central defence), Pete Wilson (a tirelessly hard-working midfielder and Social Studies student, later to gain a First degree), Pete Phillips (a brilliant left-winger with long hair who sadly left University early, declaring that it was not for him), Malcolm Campbell (red-haired and a brilliant winger), Wyn Evans (a prolific striker), Dick Airley (a mature student with a big sense of humour), Pete Owen (striker), Dave Wright, Geoff (?) Prout (central defender), Stuart Loze (a local Devonshire lad) and northern goal-keeper Warren Holland (known as ‘Woz’). There was later a strange moment involving Woz and TV. The BBC used to transmit an early evening local news slot called Nationwide hosted by gravelly-voiced Michael Barrett. One evening MB decided to highlight graduate unemployment and announced that the Plymouth studio was set to interview a graduate called Warren Holland. I viewed this while back home in Kent, watching with Mum and Dad in Orpington; I was agog. Then Mr Barrett sadly announced, “I’m sorry but we seem to have lost Mr Holland from our studio...!”\n\nAnother player of this time was Lan Harun, a Malayan lad who had, beyond question, the fiercest shot of all. It was explained to me that, when a child, Lan had practiced Malayan football in his bare feet. He had hardened his feet to the point that adding a football boot turned his shots lethal. Once, an opposing team’s wall was formed in front of Lan’s free-kick but when he struck the ball, the entire wall fled!\n\nIt was in 1972 that Ted Wragg, the University football coach, announced that there would be an Exeter University summer holiday excursion to the U.S.A. including accommodation at several big State universities and friendly soccer matches. The U.S.A. was just then acquiring an appetite for soccer but I was unable to afford the cost; a big regret. (There are more details of this tour elsewhere on the website).\n\nFor my third University year I was, to my surprise, promoted to the first team. I decided to try and improve my fitness and impress Ted Wragg. Incidentally, Ted would later become celebrated in education at a national level, frequently introduced on television chat-shows as ‘our resident education boffin, Dr Wragg...’\n\nPlaying for the first team often required long-distance travel. I recall visits to the universities of Southampton, Surrey, Reading, Bath, and Brunel. Alas, Exeter never progressed beyond the group stages in my time but we did follow closely those players who had progressed to professional level. These included Republic of Ireland and Liverpool winger Steve Heighway, a product of Warwick University in 1970 and Steve Coppell, emerging from Liverpool University to join Manchester United in 1973.\n\nFollowing graduation in 1972, I tacked on an extra year’s M.A. study in the Economic History department. This enabled me to enjoy two years of first team football, rotating between centre-back and centre-forward again. The names from this period included Johnny Gilbert, Steve Perkins, goalkeeper Simon Dobbs (a big Leyton Orient fan), full-back Brian Hicks (I think...), striker Charlie Hawker, Ian Murray, striker Terry Phillips, midfielder Johnny Parmenter (psychology student), Kevin Smith (captain and central defender), dashing winger Stevie Moss, striker Dave Whitney.\n\nOf these, a few had famously had trials at professional football clubs; Stevie Moss at Tottenham, Johnny Parmenter at West Ham and Phil Fitzpatrick at Liverpool. Sadly, Phil broke a leg in my time at University so I scarcely saw him play. Dave Whitney was signed to Barnstaple Town F.C. (then in the Western League) while still at Exeter University. In 1972 or 1973 the University first team played a friendly against Exeter City, whose fortunes we followed very closely of course. We lost 6-1 but I seem to recall that in the second-half the City team ‘allowed’ us students an honourable 1-1 draw. My highlight from that game was playing against Dave Gibson, a tiny midfielder who had played for Leicester City in the 1963 F.A. Cup final and for Scotland.\n\nIncidentally, readers will have seen Steve Moss’s own memoir elsewhere on this part of the University website which includes a team photograph from, I’m fairly certain, 1973. This team picture appeared on the back page of Express & Echo, the town’s local ‘rag’. I recall my professor/tutor Walter Minchinton summoning me into his study at Streatham Court shortly after and demanding to know if I was the glum looking chap in the team photograph and, more importantly, why I had played university football for four years but never revealed my ‘other life’ to him.\n\nWhen the last day as a student dawned, I felt overwhelmed at having to leave Exeter University. Today, more than ever, I am conscious that it was a blessed time. The vast national expansion in university places had not yet occurred, so there was still some cachet attaching to the word ‘degree’. My local borough council, Bromley, had furnished me with wonderful academic possibilities. The University was then well funded, offering numerous opportunities to expand one’s mind socially, attend music gigs and indulge in any number of sports. The football matches had also given me a thorough grounding in Devon’s geography, a county entirely new to me. Above all, the thing that remains with me is the spirit in which the game was played; in four years I do not recall a single incidence of a referee imposing any disciplinary card of any colour.\n\nAfterwards, I continued to play intermittent football for a variety of teams in Maidstone, Salisbury, and Sidcup, but nothing ever matched the innocent fun of the university years.\n\nAfter leaving University I had a mad dalliance in Canada for a year and then took up work in Sidcup working for the I.T.T. accounts department. Incidentally, while there I did meet another Exeter University footballer (from the same 3rds team) called, I think, Dave. This was followed by time in Hampshire at the TSB bank, finally by early retirement to Dunbar, Scotland where I golfed myself to distraction. Today, I’m in Sussex.\n\nIf the above chronology has gone awry, please just blame my disintegrating powers of recall. If any university footballers happen to live in the south-east Sussex and fancy a ‘blether’ about ancient Exeter times, the beer is on me; just contact alumni H.Q. and email me.\n\nSteve Moss, 1971-75\n\nThe main photo I think was taken in 1972 or 1973 and it has our loyal supporter, Professor Ted Wragg - deceased 2005, standing back row far right with yours truly next to him. I remember that Ted was a great man to have on your side, always positive beyond belief. At half time, with the score at 0-1 he would encourage us by saying “your good enough to be 5 goals in the lead”. What a lovely optimist Ted was.\n\nAt one stage we were trained by the Exeter City centre forward (whose name escapes me).\n\nIn the early days of Exeter University football team, pre-72/73 I believe, we played in the South West Universities League (Exeter, Bath, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and Kings College London). This league gave rise to good quality football played with finesse. For some reason (probably prohibitive travel costs) the University switched to a local Exeter league with lots of pub teams who would kick the crap out of you whilst dribbling past them. But it hardened us up.\n\nOur home venue was Gras Lawn, a lovely pitch with a wooden cricket pavilion as changing rooms. That venue disappeared after I left the Uni.\n\nWe had a summer soccer tour of the east coast USA in 1972/73 playing 5 or 6 games against novice American University sides (such as Temple Uni) and did well, playing in the scorching summer heat against fit Americans with no football skill as such. We stayed with hospitable American families of opposition players. A wonderful experience for me as I hadn’t ever visited the USA.\n\nOver the decades we’ve had a couple of re-union matches against the then current University 1st team, and I have to say I was surprised at how good most of the vets were (some featured in the above photo), but I won’t include myself in that list even though I had always kept myself in good condition. The games were knackering! There are two photos of the our reunion vets’ team.\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\nIt was a wonderful time playing for Exeter Uni football team during that period and I have fond memories of it. If I’ve got an of my facts or dates wrong in this memoir I know our team captain (Charlie Hawker - kneeling, far left in the photo) will correct them!\n\nNick Armitage, 1973-76\n\nI played football most days of the week for my first couple of years at Exeter and captained the 3’s or 4’s in 74/75 – sorry can’t remember which! My greatest memories are of Sunday football when Sodom n’ Gomorrah were one of the best teams; it would be great to re-contact Rob Ashmore who was the skipper.\n\nJames Tonge, 1975-78\n\nWhat Exeter Football meant to me.\n\nI’m from a small mining village in S Yorkshire and football gave me a chance to integrate into the University. I went to trials in the fall of 1975 and to be honest most of the players were woeful. So I walked into the 4th and was in the 2nd by Christmas. I played in the 1st but I preferred the 2nd it was more fun. I played for 1st in final two years in both UAU games against Hull in quarters and semi’s and got my colours in 1978.\n\nMost memorable moment\n\nI remember having 10 games in three weeks after Easter break with a chance to win the league if we won out, almost but we were dragging bodies out of Cornwall house during finals. I continued at Exeter in the PhD program like three other of my team mates. I loved playing with Hope Hall team on Sunday morning in intra mural no matter what our state. When Lukies came in I played for one more year before playing for fun at Lympstone until 1982.\n\nLife Post Exeter\n\nI post doc’d at UCNW Bangor for two years and played in UAU both years. As we had Roy Reese, an Umbro head coach, we had an amazing team. I got my FAW U 16 coaching badge but never used it. We won the welsh cup in my first year and went 1/4’s in UAU both years.\n\nI did another post doc at Northwestern University in Evanston IL, and unlike the UK I wasn’t eligible to play football due to strict NCAA rules. I joined the research department of a fortune 100 company in US and forgot about football/soccer for 30 years. Today I travel 150 miles each way on a weekend to watch Liverpool games at the supporters club bar in Detroit with my son, and about 100 other ex-pats even though my nephew coaches Barnsley and I bled Wednesday Bluesince birth.\n\nPhil Greenfield, 1977-80\n\nI played for the first team from 1977-80, and my firmest memories were probably of that 1979-80 season which I received my 'colours' for. We beat a Devon County side in a friendly at the Uni's 'all weather' pitch 4-0 and that set the tone for some sparkling football to come. As I remember it, we went through the season in the Premier Division of the Devon & Exeter League unbeaten until the very last game of the season when we narrowly lost in an evening game to, I think, the runners-up, Alphington. We also lost in the semi-final of the National UAU Competition to Liverpool University, at Warwick I believe (and we 'wuz' robbed on the balance of play).\n\nI now live in London, turned 60 a few months ago and am still playing - in the Southern Veterans Football League (over 35s and still 45 minutes each way). Or technically not playing at the moment, as I have a broken leg - hopefully back after Christmas!\n\n‌\n\nView more newspaper stories\n\nDr Charlie Hawker, 1971-84\n\nSome photos from Charlie's time at Exeter:\n\n1977/78 UAU Semi-Finalists, lost 5-4 to a last minute goal in extra time on a snowy day in Warwick (we were robbed….)\n\n1977/78 Match report and action photo from Gras Lawn (Phil Monk in full flight!!) from the quarter final revenge victory over holders Hull - 8-7 on penalties after a two all draw\n\n1976/77 UAU Quarter Finalists, lost 2-1 to eventual winners Hull who had Tony Galvin (later to win the European Cup Winners Cup with Tottenham) in their team\n\nEarlier 70’s Ram’s Reunion from 1996\n\n1972/73 Team Photo\n\n1975/76 Team Photo\n\nCharlie's colours certificate 1972-73\n\n‌Robert (Bob) Vaughan, 1975-76\n\nI was almost reduced to tears when I reviewed the football memories. I wasn’t very good but I played for the First team and loved every minute. Charlie Hawker was Captain and a lovely guy. I will never forget when Steve Moss ran down the left wing in an away match and sent over an inch perfect cross for me to head home to clinch a 2-0 win. Great memories at a great University.\n\nPaul Mapson, 1974-77\n\nWhat Exeter University football meant to me:\n\nVery high standard of friendly football with lots of trips around the county playing in Exeter and Devon League.\n\nResponsible for getting me a rubbish degree (2:2) due to football taking priority over work/study.\n\nMost memorable moments:\n\nUAU semi final vs Liverpool (lost 5-4)\n\nScoring 8 goals vs Beer\n\nManaging 2nd team for a year plus 3 years in 1st team\n\nLift post Exeter:\n\nAccountant – director of finance in NHS in Bristol\n\nRetired June 2019\n\nJohn Palmer, 1979-83\n\nWhat Exeter University Football meant to me\n\nFootball played a huge role in my whole 4 years at Exeter while training to be a PE and Maths teacher. My first day in Exeter was meeting in the Black Horse for pre-season training a week before the term started. I made my 1st X1 debut before I attended a lecture, and my last game was the evening before one of my final exams four years later. The Black Horse, Gras Lawn, Ted Wragg, the annual dinner at Dawlish Warren, training on the main campus redgras and Lukes gym, Devon and Exeter league championship battles, Exeter City fixtures, UAU – away trips, highlights and disappointments, and 4 games a week after Easter all became the norm - and frankly enriched the whole Exeter experience massively.\n\nPlaying 1st X1 for 4 years, being club captain, being fortunate enough to play 4 years of representative football for UAU/British Universities including foreign travel to Europe and USA, brought countless opportunities and friendships that have impacted me ever since. For example, through university football networks I was able to coach in the USA - initially during the summers when a student and young teacher, and then as a coaching graduate assistantship at an NCAA top 20 football (soccer!) university while studying for a master’s degree.\n\nGreat memories.\n\nMost memorable moments\n\nIn my 1st year we beat Loughborough in the last 16 of the UAU at Gras Lawn. Prior to the game we found out that they had already made the date for their last 8 game v Bangor University! This was highly motivating to us. This game in 1980 was the first time I had seen a fully choreographed team warm up (they didn’t do this in the First Division!), performed by players in specialist purple warm up tops with the Loughborough name in huge lettering - beating them was very enjoyable. We went on to beat favourites Bangor University – run by Roy Rees British Universities manager and future USA Under 16s coach - away in the last 8, and then lost narrowly to Liverpool University (including Barry Horne) who went on to win the final. (Ted Wragg as usual somehow appeared on the touchline in Liverpool and was as gutted as us).\n\nLife post Exeter\n\nTeaching / managing in School and Further Education. Latest role managing a Sports Development and Coaching degree. Based in Taunton, Somerset. Married to Gill - 4 children and a dog.‌\n\nView memorabilia from the 1980s\n\nJon Tilt, 1980-83\n\nWhat Exeter University Football meant to me\n\nI always tell my friends that I studied Football and Computer Science at Exeter and I’m convinced that the EUAFC side had more impact on my career than anything I learned in the classroom.\n\nI was 4th team skipper, so can’t profess any great skills on the field, however I was lucky enough to be voted Clubman of the year in 1983 and I think this award was enough to secure my first job in IT. My third class Computer science degree looked pretty flakey on my CV, but I managed to convince my new boss that the trophy represented great leadership and teamworking potential.\n\nI retired last year after many happy and successful years in the industry. It was probably that trophy, and the rich life experiences I gained from being part of EUAFC that unlocked the doors for me. In my experience, the so-called ‘soft’ skills of leadership, teamworking, communication, training discipline and knowing how to graft will get you further than any bits of paper.\n\nMost memorable moments:\n\nWhen asked about his most memorable moment, Eric Cantona explained that it was not a goal, but a pass.\n\nIn my case, it was not a goal but a miss! Or more correctly a brilliant save by the then 1st XI keeper, John Palmer. In a pre-season trial I hit the sweetest volley from perhaps 25 yards and it was arrowing for the top corner - I had visions of first team selection, perhaps a call up for the Grecians, until Palmer lept like a dolphin to caress the ball over the bar. Dashing my hopes, but opening the door to some fun times in the 4s.\n\nMy favourite game was against Starcross on a Bank holiday Monday. As captain I led the team to a pre-match tipple in the Anchor inn close to their ground. The first half was an interesting experiment in the effects of alcohol on highly tuned athletes. Luckily we made it to the interval only two goals down, saved by the alcohol tolerance of a rugby player (Paul Wogan) who we’d enlisted earlier in the day. As we sobered up in the second half our silky skills returned and we won 3-2. A lesson learned for the rest of my life, keep the beer until after you’ve done the business.\n\nWhilst Duckes Meadow was our spiritual home, I loved the away games as they fostered a great team spirit, all travelling to the lands that time forgot in an old minibus. Away trips were always the opportunity for the locals to remind us that we were ‘bound to be fit as we didn’t pay any taxes.’ Never worked out what they meant by that but it kept them amused!\n\nOn one trip down the East bank of the Exe, our minibus ran out of fuel. Fortunately we were at the top of a very long hill and we managed to roll what seemed like miles to the nearest garage and make it back in time to meet with the other teams at the Blackhorse for a few beers, a few stories and a few songs!\n\nLife post Exeter:\n\nPlayed a few games of football after leaving Exeter, but wasn’t able to match the atmosphere we had back in the EUAFC days. I made the move to rugby union which provided the friendships and camaraderie I’d had at university, and played for several clubs in the South of England as well as playing in the US for a while.\n\nMy first job was as a computer programmer for a branch of Philips in Crawley, West Sussex. In 1986 I joined IBM and spent 33 very happy years with them, solving problems, both technical and people related, around the World. At 40 years old I took up athletics (mainly 400m hurdles) and have travelled around Europe and The States competing at Masters level for GB. I also coach a group of talented 400m runners at Southampton AC. I married in 1988, have two daughters and am now happily retired in Romsey, Hampshire.\n\nStuart Clark, 1980-84\n\nWhat Exeter University Football meant to me\n\nAs a fresher I was invited to pre-season, but cricket commitments back home prevented me from going. I then missed the trial and was left with a free weekend until club captain Iain Felton found me on the morning of the game and asked if I would play for the fourth team. That was it, the journey had begun. That season I played for all four teams finishing up in the first team and staying there for the rest of my time in Exeter.\n\nI was privileged to play for Exeter University alongside some extremely talented footballers, who became good friends. I remember Dennis, the groundsman at Gras Lawn and the perfectly manicured pitches, being careful not to walk across the cricket square. The games against Exeter City at St. James Park, Exmouth Town, Civil Service and our constant run-ins with the Manager at Dolphin. Fair to say he didn’t like us much. As students we were fair game for the more mature players in the league. We did take a bit of a kicking at times but I wouldn’t change a thing. I think most of us lived for Wednesday and the UAU fixtures. We always started as favourites in the regional group, and that put a bit of pressure on us but we thrived on it. For somebody who is travel sick, the coach journey to away games was not so great, especially when the Fines Committee kept fining me for feeling sick. I also got fined for coming from the North and supporting Newcastle United which I found a bit harsh. Great memories, great friendships.\n\nMost memorable moments\n\nIn my first year we beat Birmingham at Loughborough in the final of the UAU (for the 3rds), a game I was lucky to play in as I had established myself in the first team.\n\nMemorable for all the wrong reasons was breaking my leg in Canterbury playing against the University of Kent in my final year. The journey back in a full length cast in a minibus full of drunken footballers was memorable but not much fun, especially with most of your leg stuck out of the window.\n\nI was always amazed how Ted Wragg managed to get to so many games. I understand, to watch us play in the UAU against Bristol, he ducked out of a meeting with Secretary for Education Sir Keith Joseph. We were far more important. Ted had a great passion for football but was burdened with being a Sheffield Wednesday supporter – he took a lot of stick for that.\n\nDoes anybody remember Peter Amos? A mature student and excellent football coach, he introduced us to zonal marking and the POMO line (look it up!). That first training session was mystifying.\n\nLife post Exeter\n\nI chose to go into Facilities Management rather than teaching, working for Leeds Leisure Services as an Area Manager with a portfolio of leisure centres and golf courses. I then moved into education as a Facilities Manager for schools in West Yorkshire before completing my working life as a Contracts Manager for Carillion and managing 15 schools in Barnsley. It is maybe no coincidence that a year after my retirement Carillion folded.\n\nI have a son who has inherited the football gene and is Head of Marketing at Barnsley FC. My Daughter works as a Product Manager at Nestle in York. I am now happily retired and living just outside York.\n\nView more memorabilia from alumnus Roger Cantello (English, 1984)\n\nChris Westphal, 1981-84\n\nWhat Exeter University Football meant to me:\n\nFriends, friendship, the enjoyment and fun of playing the greatest game, representing my University, some great competitive games in UAU and the associated trip, Saturday leagues that everyone wanted to beat and sometimes beat up the students (never happened), great nights in The Blackhorse.\n\nMost memorable moments:\n\nWinning 3rd Team UAU at Bath v Birmingham 1984.\n\nBeating Leeds 2nds at Leeds on ICE for 2’s.

I played mainly in the second eleven, with the odd game for the firsts through my six years. Though a busy man, Ted always had time for a chat, and was great company.\n\nIn November 1989, just prior to submitting my PhD thesis, I was asked to play for the 1st XI in the UAU against Bristol. The game was won convincingly.\n\nAfter the game I had a good chat with one of the Bristol players in the Black Horse. He was a friend of my brother. Next thing I hear is that Bristol had raised an objection about me playing, claiming I was ineligible. Points were to be deducted, and there was a threat of expulsion from the competition, I believe.\n\nTed was having none of it. He must have spent hours in communication with the AU. I have a copy of the letter that he sent to them.\n\nAs others have mentioned, all his other work would have gone out the window, while he devoted all his effort to saving his beloved football club!\n\nEventually the points were lost, but the team was not expelled and went on to reach the final that year.\n\nSimon Dunkley, 1988-92\n\nWhat Exeter University football meant to me:\n\nGreat feelings of being part of a special group of people.

EUAFC meant everything to me during my whole time at Exeter and the memories have lived on ever since and always bring a smile to my face. Despite enjoying a semi-pro career for 14 years, it was always playing at Gras Lawn or UAU matches with mates that meant the world to me (I played when injured so many times, would never miss a match for anything!).\n\nI was lucky enough to play 1st XI as a fresher and we won the Devon & Exeter league and got to the last 16 of UAU. I looked up to the 3rd & 4th years and we had a great team spirit. I also played English Universities in 1994 & 95, and GB Universities in 1995. But EUAFC was always my 'home'!\n\nMy memorable moments from EUAFC are numerous, so here goes:\n\nTed Wragg - what an absolute legend, always appeared at every match and gave his witty and inspirational advice; Pub Socials - whether it was the Black Horse, Clifton Inn, Mount Radford or St Luke’s Bar - we always created an atmosphere and just had brilliant fun every time we got together; Playing at Gras Lawn - our 'Wembley', with its tiny 'shed' changing rooms and huge crowds on UAU Wednesdays. What an atmosphere, and what a shame it's gone; Training at Top Site on Mondays - we walked all the way from St Luke’s, up the hill, trained indoors with about 60 people for an hour, and then if you were selected in the 1's or 2's for the Wednesday 'UAU' matches, it was another hour out on the 'Red Gras' in the wind and rain (before walking all the way home); UAU Away Tours - fancy dress, fines on the bus, arriving late, winning anyway, out-singing the oppo in the student bar, leaving freshers at Exeter servs, and ending up at St Luke’s to join the other teams before heading out to Timepiece for some 'Mad Dog 20/20's'; Rennes Tours - I went in 1993 and 1995, we drank on the ferry all the way there, played a couple of matches, wandered around the streets of Rennes with nowhere to sleep(!), and drank all the way home - absolute carnage, it took us a week to get over these trips; Summer term football - returning after Easter to a full programme of fixtures for all teams! 1st XI having to play 9 'away' matches (because Gras Lawn was now a cricket square) and winning most of them to win the league. Playing almost every night as 'Birthday XI's' and 'Luke’s XI's' made up the 3's or 4's as we battled with the local 'Oggies', whose dislike of the students was always apparent. And finally, to finish where I started - one of the most influential people I was lucky enough to meet and know, I will always remember what you did for me personally and the whole of EUAFC - Ted Wragg.\n\nLife and plans Post-Exeter:\n\nI have been a PE teacher since graduating in 1996; now Director of Sport at Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Amersham, Bucks. Enjoyed a semi-pro football career until 2002 with Grays, Purfleet, Hendon, Kingstonian, Enfield & Wealdstone. Got married at St Luke’s(!) to fellow Lukey Jacqui; we have two daughters - Esme (19) & Abbie (16). Life plan is to part-retire by the age of 55, and hopefully 'fully-retire' five years later down to my beloved Exeter?!\n\nAndy Russell, 1998\n\nFor me, the connection to the football family at Exeter goes beyond sport.\n\nAs for so many, the pre-season freshers week introduced me to university life before term had even begun. I'm not sure what was the most enjoyable, the gruelling pre-season sessions running up and down Exmouth beach, or the 'refuelling' evenings around Exeter's bars and pubs. What was clear from the very start was that the football and the social side of the club was going to be serious, but also lots of fun.\n\nAs a 'main siter' it took me awhile to break into the top teams, which meant serving a great apprenticeship in the thirds with a great bunch of lads. Eventually I managed to progress into the seconds and then first team in my second year, which took a lot of hard work and discipline. I was able to learn from and compete with some top players, hugely improving my game in the process. Throughout however, the ethos was always work hard and play hard, and I can still remember the fancy dress shenanigans involved in UAU Wednesdays as we toured around different universities. Win lose or draw, all of the teams reconvened in Timepiece to compare notes over a few sherbets…\n\nHowever it was in 1996 that the football club really showed what supporting a teammate was all about. Unfortunately, I had an accident during that summer which meant I became a wheelchair user and my football days were over. It was a super difficult time for all involved, especially family and friends. The football club, alongside the University in general were hugely supportive. So many people visited me in hospital, and I seem to remember a whole bunch of teammates shaving their heads to raise money for me to buy equipment.\n\nThere was even a decision to rename 'most improved player' award which I had won the season before was temporarily in my name, which was a lovely gesture. I was able to graduate one year after leaving hospital and since then I’ve lived and worked in London and regularly return to Exeter to see my nephew who is studying there as well as provide support and careers advice to current students.\n\nThese are all things that 20+ years later I still remember, and highlight the strength and unity that comes with sports and this club in particular. I'm still in touch with many of the guys, and shout out to all of those who played at that time and can remember me!\n\nPaul Fuggle, 1996-1999\n\nI played in all of the games for the EUAFC 1st XI as a fresher in 1996-1997, and didn’t miss a 1st XI game over the next 2 seasons between 1997-1999.\n\n\"The football club WAS my University experience. I respected the senior players who I looked up to as a fresher; I remember my debut and the marrow; the away tours (particularly the only fools and horses tour to Brunel); the celebrations after winning our league in 1996-1997, representing the South West and English Uni teams, and playing in a testimonial game in front of hundreds of people against Exeter City; the pre season hill runs with Dizzy; and playing with some of the best players I ever played with in my life.\"\n\nJames Heale, 1992-96\n\nWhat Exeter University football meant to me:\n\nFantastic memories of playing in Devon and Exeter League and UAU competitions. Friendship, many war stories and brilliant tours to all corners of England and France.\n\nMost memorable moments:\n\nSummer term, playing 5-6 games a week for every side in the club.\n\nScoring a hattrick on my 22nd birthday.\n\nFinding my way back from Exeter services in my boxer shorts as a fresher.\n\nLift post Exeter:\n\n25 years of teaching.\n\nHeadteacher of secondary school in West London.\n\nTEDX speaker.\n\nFounder of Flywheel learning – leadership coaching and development.\n\nJay Davenport, 1992-96\n\nWhat Exeter University football meant to me:\n\nGreat football and great friendships that have lasted a lifetime. When we meet up now it's like we have never been away.\n\nMost memorable moments:\n\nAway trips to UAU fixtures across the country.\n\nSummer term fixtures everyday against Devon and Exeter opposition.\n\nLife post Exeter:\n\nTwenty five years teaching including being a head teacher for the last seven. Now running own leadership programme, executive coaching and consulting business. My son has just started at Exeter as a fresher in 2021."
