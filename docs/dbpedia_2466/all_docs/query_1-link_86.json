It met in Washington, D.C., from January 3, 1971, to January 3, 1973, during the third and fourth years of Richard Nixon's presidency.\n\nThe apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the 1960 census. Both chambers maintained a Democratic majority.\n\nPassing legislation on revenue-sharing was a key event of the congress. President Richard Nixon had it listed on his list of top policies to cover for the year. Nixon signed the bill into law at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The law gained support from many state and local officials including: San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto whose city received $27 million in revenue-sharing money in the first year. Alioto said that many projects that would not have been possible could now be done, \"That will effectively enable us to meet those programs which up to now because of very tough budgeting we've had to trench.\"[1]\n\nDecember 18, 1971: Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, Pub.
