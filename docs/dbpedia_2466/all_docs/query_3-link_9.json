        "text": "Childhood and early political career\n\nMenendez, whose parents were Cuban immigrants, grew up in Union City, New Jersey, where he served as president of his high-school class. He was the first in his family to attend college, graduating from Saint Peter’s College (now Saint Peter’s University) with a bachelor’s degree in political science in 1976. During that time Menendez entered local politics by mounting a drive to reform the Union City Board of Education. He was elected to the board in 1974 and served until 1978. After studying law at Rutgers University (Juris Doctor, 1979), he entered private legal practice in 1980.\n\nIn 1982 Menendez ran for mayor of Union City but was defeated. However, his second bid, in 1986, was successful, and he held the post until 1992. Menendez concurrently served in the New Jersey General Assembly (1987–91). In 1992 Menendez ran for the U.S. House of Representatives following redistricting that created the Latino-majority 13th district. He was elected and took office the following year. In January 2006 Gov. Jon Corzine appointed him to fill a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate. Menendez won a special election later that year to retain the seat.\n\nIn Congress Menendez took varied political stances. On foreign policy matters he was generally conservative and often voted with Republicans. He called for military intervention in Libya and Syria, though he opposed a 2002 resolution that authorized the use of force against Iraq. He was notably more liberal on environmental and domestic issues. Menendez supported abortion rights and same-sex marriage, and he emerged as a leading advocate for immigration reform.\n\nLegal troubles\n\nIn 2015 Menendez was indicted on federal corruption charges that he allegedly failed to report numerous gifts from a political donor on whose behalf he interceded with various government agencies. Menendez denied wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty, continuing to serve in the Senate. His trial began in September 2017, and two months later it ended in a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. In January 2018 the Department of Justice announced that it would not retry Menendez. However, three months later the Senate Ethics Committee “severely admonished” Menendez and ordered him to “repay the fair market value of all impermissible gifts not already repaid.” In November 2018 he was elected to a third term in the Senate.\n\nIn September 2023, Menendez again faced legal charges when he and his third wife, Nadine Arslanian Menendez, were federally indicted on bribery charges alleging that the sentator used his position to secretly benefit the Egyptian government. The indictment alleged that Menendez accepted “cash, gold, payments toward a home mortgage, compensation for a low-or-no-show job, a luxury vehicle, and other things of value.”\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

However, Menendez did step down as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His trial, which ended in the conviction on all counts, began in May 2024."
