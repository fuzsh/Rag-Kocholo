        "text": "Guestbook Archive: 1996\n\n2006 | 2005 | 2004 | 2003 | 2002 | 2001 | 1999 | 1998 | 1997 | 1996\n\nThe African-American community today needs leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Conditions in America have improved for blacks, however I see no difference in the police officer that beats a black man in 1996, than the one in 1960. We still have a long way to go. As a 17 year old senior in high school, I will try to continue the legacy that King began.\n\nThena Kaprice Robinson, Bethel High School\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nDr. King awoke a nation to the need to treat all men equal. He is to be greatly admired. However, my daughter has written four papers about Dr. King. I wonder when she will be allowed to write about other great men. Men such as Thomas Jefferson (oops, I forgot  He was a white guy  he contributed nothing).\n\nMax S. Watson, Fort Worth, Texas\n\nAll of us have one life. Some of us live through it well and okay. Others make a difference. Martin Luther King made clear the negativity of society, a task that seemed insurmountable to many. I am only 16, but I am so grateful for Martin's courage, strength, and knowledge which helped make America what it is today. Very different from back then.\n\nDiep Nguyen, Piedmont Hills High School\n\nSan Jose, California\n\nI visited the United States in 1987, 1989 and 1992. During these vacations I travelled in several southern states (Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Georgia). To be honest, I was shocked to see that so many, mainly black, people lived in poverty. I don't think that the dream of MLK has come true ... yet. White people still don't see (and treat) the Afro-Americans as equal. I think that there's a lot of work to do in the \"greatest nation on this planet\" (according to Mr. Clinton).\n\nEric van Nieuwenhoven, Roggel, Holland\n\nWe studied the \"I Have a Dream\" speech in my college English class. I was very moved (as were all admirers) by this speech and the life of MLK. Someone in class mentioned that they heard he gave a large portion of this speech impromptu. I have been searching the Internet trying to verify this. Has anyone else heard this, and if so, do you remember where? This would make the speech even more special. Thank you!\n\nSusan Heath, Yuba College\n\nYuba City, California\n\nI am a native South African living in Johannesburg. Martin Luther King had inspired me to struggle against the apartheid system and still continues to inspire me to work towards racial reconciliation.\n\nClayton Peters, Johannesburg, South Africa\n\nI feel that what you are doing is cool. Everyone needs to learn what the African Americans have gone through. Sometimes we take it for granted that we are white. To many they look at your color and nothing else. Many African Americans have made a impression in History.\n\nAdam Hunt, Brunswick High School\n\nBrunswick, Maine\n\nI have been inspired by Dr. King since a young teenager growing up in New York. Now at the age of 47, I am getting a chance to tell actually visit the places of the struggle he gave his life for. In March of 1997, a diverse group of students from the University of Texas at San Antonio, will recreate the freedom rides of 1961-3. This alternative spring break project will leave San Antonio, TX on Friday, March 14, and tour for 7 days, visiting 4 historic civil rights sites: Atlanta, Birmingham, Montgomery, Selma, and culminate our trip with a site visti and work project in Philadelphia, Mississippi, where Goodman, Cheney, and Schwiener were murdered. It is our hope that we will have the opportunity to work at one of the recently fire-bombed churches.\n\nFred Wilson, Methodist Student Movement,\n\nUniversity of Texas at San Antonio\n\nSan Antonio, Texas\n\nDr. Martin Luther King has had an huge impact in the world. If everyone would study the works of this brilliant man, then people might not be as sexist or racist.\n\nOver the hundred of years we have been trying to overcome inequalities that white males have put on the minorities: minorities are not only those of a different race, but of a different sex. I never realized how much our country could learn from a man who only had a dream. I believe that if a person has a goal or something they believe in that they should pursue it no matter how long it takes.\n\nThe only thing that will matter is that you did attain it. I am a college student and King's letter from jail is the first work I ever read of his. It is sad that schools don't advocate learning more about such a powerful person.\n\nSynamin, University of Nevada\n\nLas Vegas, Nevada\n\nI just got an album of of the man's speeches. And I find the words are just as important today as when he spoke them all those years ago. Does this mean that nothing has changed ? No I feel that his struggle has made life better for the generations that followed him. All it really means is that words spoken with love, honour and respect will always be important. PEACE!\n\nIlan Ostrove, London, England\n\nI hope that someday MLK's dream becomes a reality. For the love of living in the U.S should be shared, without discrimination, by all ... black or white!\n\nBrooke Norland, Boise State University\n\nBoise, Idaho\n\nMartin had a vision and he saw it through to the best of his abilities; we should all be so diligent.\n\nEarl A. Jones, Indiana University of Pa.\n\nIndiana, Pennsylvania\n\nIf he (Martin Luther King Jr.) was alive today, instead of trying to free the black man from the white man he would be trying to free us from ourselves.\n\nWayman, Eisenhower High\n\nRialto, California\n\nOn April 4, 1968, America lost a great man. He was murdered because some people couldn't understand his ideas. Peace was the same as cowardice to these people, and equality was the same as communism.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nThe actions of James Earl Ray and his co-conspirators were that of blatant cowardice. The irrational fear of other races achieving equality and coexisting with whites woke them up at nights screaming. Peace, they thought, was totally impossible and illogical. I am by NO means condoning their actions. They were cowards and bigots, to the fullest extent. But only when we understand bigotry, can we truly begin to combat it...\n\nSamuel, Chantilly High School\n\nI think that great strides in the direction of social and economic reforms for African-American people have been made. Yet I believe that racial reconciliation and unity between races have not been achieved. When I read Martin Luther King's \"I have a dream\" speech, I can't help but think that racial reconciliation remains a dream. I have talked to my African-American friends who feel the same way.\n\nI am a Christian and I see the whole issue from a spiritual viewpoint. Racism will remain until this country comes to repentance for the awful things done to the African-American population. Go back in history and see how many excuses were made for the sin of slavery. Racism has just replaced slavery. Many people still treat African-Americans as people of little or no worth.\n\nMartin Luther King advocated brotherhood among the white and black race, but has that really happened? I don't think so. We are more separated today than ever. I probably will never make such an impact as Martin Luther King, but I have long decided that I am not going to sit and watch the gap between races broaden. I will do my part in making racial reconciliation happen right where I am at. That is my dream!\n\nUli Chapa, San Antonio, Texas\n\nI think what we lack today is a leader with the guts to lay down his life for what he or she believes is right, true and just.\n\nLynn Miles, San Antonio, Texas\n\nBRAVO!\n\nJ'ai 13 ans et je suis blanche et je crois que tout le monde devrait se riunir pour former un seul monde entre toutes les races, soit noir, blancs, jaune et meme bleu! abas le racisme!\n\n(Editor's translation: BRAVO! I am 13 years old and white, and I believe that everyone should unite to make one world for all races, whether black, white, yellow or even blue! Down with racism!)\n\nSophie, Ecole secondaire St-Sacrement (St-Sacrement high school)\n\nTerrebonne, Quebec, Canada\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. is someone I have admired for his bravery and relentlessness. He was not afraid to act on his thoughts and it has affected many Americans.\n\nRyan Hadeed, Reynolds High School\n\nPortland, Oregon\n\nI don't think things have improved since MLK's days. It has to do with the economy most of all. Too few have too much.\n\nSuzanne Bell, Whately, Massachusetts\n\nLove. Dr. King recognized it as the one force that could save us all. What he knew, what he wanted, and what we all need to learn, if we want to survive, is how to love each other. Please, everyone, love each other.\n\nThank you, Martin.\n\nRob DuMars, San Francisco, California\n\nDr. Martin Luther King crusaded against the unjust treatment of Afro-American people. He was a great leader with the purpose of obtaining human rights for all people.\n\nThe dream was far ahead of its time because today people are still judged by the color of their skin instead of the content of their character. However, his dream set the standard for the whole of humanity to understand and realize that prejudice, hatred, and bigotry are the tools of the oppressors. It has made me realize that this country wasn't ready for equal rights in the sixties and since Dr. King's death the same influx of discrimination is slowly happening again. The rights that were gained are slowly being taken away from all Afro-Americans.\n\nThe only memory that stands out among the rest is Malcolm X and Dr. King talking together about the same issue. Human rights!\n\nTheodore R. Berry, Sr., Community College of Philadelphia\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nI think that the civil rights movement started too late ... These sorts of (discriminatory) things have been happening for too long. The people that are involved with this (movement) were heroes and they deserve the respect of all American citizens.\n\nIan Tunbridge, Brighton\n\nSLC, Utah\n\nI admire Dr. King, because he stood up for what he believed in, even though he knew it would probably cost him his life. We have too many people in the world who just do whatever is easiest. I homeschool my two boys, and I would like to find a complete copy (tape or written) of Dr. King's \"I Have A Dream\" speech. I don't want to just teach them the few phrases that have been played over and over by the media. The whole speech is incredible, and it's a shame we don't hear it more often. If anyone knows where I can get a copy or a tape of this speech, please let me know.\n\nDebbie Payne, mom and homeschool teacher\n\nDecatur, Mississippi\n\nI think that he was one of the greatest and bravest men that ever existed, who truly cared about his race and his people. He stood for all that is good and appropriate in the way we should be living today.\n\nAngelique Nicole Bourthoumieu, South Bend, Indiana\n\nWe have a long way to go!\n\nRob Bauer, Concordia University\n\nMequon, Wisconsin\n\nThe fight for continuing civil rights in our country lives on today, in many aspects of our life. People like Martin Luther King Jr. have an important message to give to people about demonstrating their opinions in a peaceful manner.\n\nOut Bowling, Mt. San Antonio College\n\nWalnut, California\n\nI believe that through trial and error, Dr. King has shown us the way towards total equality; our only problem is that we haven't figured which road to take to achieve total equality in our cities, towns, and country. I hope to see one day the togetherness that we can all share. I have a dream just like anyone else, and that dream is for equality.\n\nSandra Rohloff, St. Helens Senior High School\n\nSt. Helens, Oregon\n\nDr. King has provided a direction for me in my march, here on earth. Along with other heroes of mine such as Jesus Christ, Don Quixote, and the Tick, MLK has given the whole world a dream. Dr. King has so inspired me that I have written a screen play that focuses on his teachings and ideology as it applies to everyday life. I have had the honor of meeting his eldest daughter Yolanda. I have so many things I would like to say about MLK but instead I will just close with one of my favorite quotes. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, \"the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in times of comfort and convenience, rather where he stands in times of conflict and controversy.\" Peace be with you and yours.\n\nBrian Michael Sandvig, The University of North Dakota\n\nGrand Forks, North Dakota\n\nI believe in Martin Luther King's dream. The world is not like it was back in the early years, but there's still a lot of prejudice today. It's in our school system today. We have to all stick together and overthrow this cancer. It's not just about black people it's about every color.\n\nJanice Gallegos, Montrose High School\n\nMontrose, Colorado\n\nI am a student at Arizona State University, Tempe, and I just read one of his letters from a jail somewhere in the South that I found in my philosophy book.\n\nNow I have never read anything of his before, and I must tell you that I was completely stirred by his words. They reminded me very much of the way I interpret the words of many great men, including Jesus.\n\nI hope I can find more of his words on the Internet. I, like this great man, have been called to preach the good news to all members of this planet but have yet to know when I will begin. I have begun, but wish to do more.\n\nThank you\n\nClark L. Hays, Jr., (pen name) Brother Frank Lee Bold, Arizona State University\n\nTempe, Arizona\n\nI teach 8th grade civics. Our unit on Dr. King was one of the more interesting units we did this year. To my surprise, many of my students have studied very little about the civil rights issues of the 1950-60 period. I would encourage teachers to do more in this area. It was a great way to introduce the study of law and law related issues.\n\nE.K. Trone, Frost Middle School\n\nFairfax, Virginia\n\nHow does the story goes after the African-Americans got what they wanted  Civil Rights? Is it a happy ending story? Look at the world today. What are we missing here?\n\nHoward Chang, MacDonald International Academy\n\nMississauga, Ontario, Canada\n\nI am doing a report now on Martin Luther King Jr. for a term paper in 11th grade. Before doing this paper I didn't know much about this man, but now he is one of the most heroic men that I have ever learned about. His bravery set a tone which no other man in the world has done. He gained equal rights for blacks and it is still being done today. He is just amazing and so fascinating. It is great that you have these pages here and it would be even better to have an entire section on him.\n\nI believe that Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the greatest men to ever live. He was a true hero not only to blacks in America, but to whites, like me. He is an inspiration and I hope to continue my study on him until the information runs out. If anyone has the address of Coretta Scott King, please send it to me. Thank you.\n\nJeremy Welles, Herricks High School\n\nRoslyn, New York\n\nI feel that King was one of the most influential leaders of this century. He stood as a symbol for equality, freedom, respect, nonviolence, leadership, and religion. It's amazing to see how a man with a dream could lead so many followers to obtain the ultimate dream!\n\nCy Salazar, New Mexico State University\n\nAlamogordo, New Mexico\n\nI believe that the dream of Dr. King was one of the most vivid and unselfishly benevolent dreams that any man could have ever possessed. It is a dream that any human being, any person with a hope for humanity, might agree with. However and much to my disappointment, it is as it has always been for King as well as for God a dream, whose reality lies in an ending. That to me  not to be morbid  will be realized in our society's final hour. But I must say that it is always my hope to wake up and greet this dream in its full reality.\n\nAnn-Renee Mathis, University of Texas at Arlington\n\nArlington, Texas\n\nI am glad that Martin Luther King Jr. stood up for what he believed in. He gave me hope that I will be able to stand up for my beliefs too.\n\nVanessa, Rosenort Collegiate\n\nRosenort, MB, Canada\n\nI know that the existence of Martin Luther King, Jr., and his dream have provided a grounding rod for all the challenges I have met in raising my African-American family. His dream has helped my children with the hope and joy of humanity.\n\nMrs. Harris, Marysville, Washington\n\nMartin Luther King was an inspiration to humanity and we should appreciate what he lived and died for. The civil rights movement was necessary for progress  however as an African, I feel that we should not become complacent and stop striving for freedom and equality for all. As long as there is prejudice fed by ignorance the struggle continues.\n\nH. Smith, California State University\n\nDominguez Hills\n\nCarson, California\n\nWir sollten diesen Traum leben !\n\n(Translation: We should live this dream!)\n\nOlaf Samtleben, Technical University Clausthal\n\nClausthal-Zellerfeld, Deutchland\n\nI believe that Dr. King was an asset not only to the advancement of the civil rights movement; but also to all of humanity. I am 20 years old and though I never had the chance to meet him I can truly say that I admire him extremely. I just hope for the sake of our generation and others that we carry on his visions and dreams of equality. So that one day we will not be black or white; but human.\n\nRobert, Chowan College\n\nMurfreesboro, North Carolina\n\nI hope that we will continue to look for ways to make Dr. King's dream a reality. One reason he was successful was that he set concrete goals and planned specific actions in order to reach those goals. Although he had a dream, he was a man of action. I think we should do the same thing. We should use this holiday as a day to set goals for achieving racial justice, and each year on this day we can reflect on what progress we have made toward attaining those goals, toward making the dream a reality.\n\nI want to thank Martin Luther King for all of his sacrifices.\n\nEileen Cain, University of Hawaii at Manoa\n\nHonolulu, Hawai'i\n\nI read an article today from an old newspaper (San Jose Mercury News, Feb. 5 1995) and I was moved by the words that he used in his sermons.\n\nDarren Pozzi, De Anza College\n\nSaratoga, California\n\nMartin Luther King meant us to have equality among all races regardless of color, race or creed. He taught us to respect one another and believe in ourselves. The man's legacy will live on forever in the lives of those who look up to him.\n\nEddie and Chris, Clay CEC\n\nSt. Louis, Missouri\n\nI might be white, but I still look up to Martin Luther King Jr. I always have and always will. I think what he has done and is still doing is great. I wish everyone from all races would give him a listen. I admire him a lot. I'm doing an informative report on him in my Speech class. I needed info. on him and am greatly satisfied with everything on the Internet about him! Give props to my man, Martin! May his \"dream\" still live through all of us!\n\nMelissa Blankenbeckler, Fountain Central School\n\nVeedersburg, Indiana\n\nI think Mr. King was incredibly smart.\n\nRoss Clark, Lincoln Elementary School\n\nMadison, Wisconsin\n\nI think that Dr. King was a great man and it is a shame that the young black youths who are supposed to be the leaders of tomorrow are just not living up to what he spoke for. It seems as if all his efforts were in vain.\n\nDiane G. John, University of the Virgin Islands\n\nChristiansted, Virgin Islands\n\nThe world would be a better place if we all would follow the philosophy that was espoused by Martin Luther King, Jr. This Web site has aided in making the world a better place by spreading his message. Kudos and muchas gracias to all of you at this site and to the world wide participants.\n\nWalter P. Maynard, M.D., Bel Air, California\n\nI think that Martin Luther King was a very important person. He was the kind of person a black person could look up to. I think if he was still living a lot of things would be different today.\n\nShureka White, Rock Hill High School\n\nRock Hill, South Carolina\n\nI don't like the way the white men were always on Martin Luther King's case. Because he was just trying to accomplish something, doing the best thing he could. I think that the white people could not handle the fact that Martin Luther King was doing the best thing. So they had him assassinated and they picked the stupidest person in the world. If Martin Luther King was still alive things would be different. But I will keep his dream alive that \"white kids and black kids would hold hands and not judge by the color but by the content of their being.\"\n\nI wish that James Earl Ray had gotten the electric chair.\n\nDalina Redd, Central High School\n\nKansas City, Missouri\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a champion of civil rights for ALL persons! Not only did he lead the cause for equality for African-Americans but for everyone whose civil rights were violated. The sooner we understand that Martin Luther King Jr. was a man for everyone, the sooner we can understand what civil rights was REALLY all about.\n\nKennis Austin, Snow Hill Middle School, teacher\n\nSnow Hill, Maryland\n\nI feel that his views have changed the way of life in our society forever.\n\nManuel Soriano, Ukiah High School, Grade 9\n\nUkiah, California\n\nDr. Martin Luther King never gave up. He wanted freedom for all blacks and he had faith in himself.\n\nYomara Manson, Sanislo Elementary School, Grade 3\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\nI have never met Martin Luther King Jr. yet his life and views have changed my life forever. Ever since I can remember, I have watched movies about his life and what he took a stand for. I too am against any form of racial discrimination but, more than anything else, I admire Martin Luther King Jr. for his nonviolent protests. So much more was accomplished this way. Thank you Martin Luther King Jr. for giving your life for what you knew was right.\n\nJonathan Lucas, Gospel Outreach, Grade 10\n\nOlympia, Washington\n\nMartin did what we all must find a way to do, sacrifice our own dreams for dreams that are bigger than we could ever imagine. Seeing the good in all people's hearts and minds.\n\nHow much of a difference can you and I make? What will we do to keep his dream alive? He gave us hope, now it is up to you and me to keep that hope alive, only then will that dream become a reality. Hope is not dead, it is sleeping in our hearts and needs to be awakened.\n\nMatthew Lysaker, University of Minnesota, Crookston, Junior\n\nCrookston, Minnesota\n\nSanislo Elementary School, Seattle, Wash.\n\nDreamed of freedom for all\n\nRisked his life\n\nKnew all people were equal\n\nIntegrated with whites\n\nNever gave up\n\nGave many talks for black people to fight for freedom.\n\nAlly B., Grade 3\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a very peaceful man. He was so smart that he even skipped grades. If Dr. King was killed before his speech, the world would not have peace. One day Dr. King had a dream that was wonderful to hear. He dreamed that the great day of freedom was near. He told his dream to the world loud and clear. Dr. King was a nonviolent man. Dr. King stopped segregation and gave people rights. I think Dr. King's dream was a wonderful dream because he saved the world from violence.\n\nSandra M., Grade 3\n\nPoem About Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nDreamed of the world to be equal. Risked his life for us. Knew\n\nhis life for us. Integrated with whites. Never gave up and let\n\nblack people have freedom. Gave freedom to all.\n\nPauline T., Grade 3\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. never gave up.\n\nHe had faith in himself. He wanted black people\n\nto have freedom. Martin Luther King Jr. wanted\n\nto stop Jim Crow laws. Who was Jim Crow?\n\nJeffrey A., Grade 3\n\nI think that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s dream was that everybody would be equal no matter what color they are.\n\nAlbert C. S. Jr., Grade 3>\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. changed the world. Everybody wants you to change the world. Please just change the world. If you do, we will have freedom and be free at last. And every person needs to fight for freedom.\n\nJudy M.C, Grade 3\n\nDr. King was a smart person. When he was a minister, he told the white and black people to get along and have peace.\n\nHa Na P., Grade 3>\n\nDr. King was a very nice person and everybody is proud of him. The people were proud of him. After his death people kept fighting for freedom.\n\nHieu V., Grade 3\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a nice man. We all like him because he made black and white people get along. Every one has his picture in Sanislo school. I like MLK.\n\nDavid Vann, Grade 3\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was a good man. He stood up for what he believed in. He never gave up. Not very many people stand up for what they believe in. If more people stood up for what they believed in, then more would be accomplished. Martin Luther King Jr. was a great man.\n\nKe'lah Lehtola, Martha Lake Elementary, Grade 5\n\nLynnwood, Washington\n\nI feel today in 1996 Dr. King would be a little disappointed in society. It has been thirty years or more since his assassination; we are still dealing with the issue of racism in the school systems, work places and communities.\n\nBut what can we expect, after four hundred fifty years of slavery, do we really expect society to change their beliefs and value systems about racism? Half of society denies racism still exists and the other half enforces it. (Could somebody please give me the date in history when racism ended; because it's not in any books I have ever read?)\n\nI have a dream....will we ever be rid of the evils of racism?\n\nCynthia A. Dailey, Lincoln University, graduate\n\nJefferson City, Missouri\n\nMartin Luther King fought for what he believed in. He was willing to die for what he believed in. Things would be very different now in the United States now if MLK had not been a strong leader.\n\nAshley Ehrmantrout and Michelle LeFebvre, Martha Lake Elementary School, Grades 4 and 5\n\nLynnwood, Washington\n\nI think that Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy has had a large impact on society but there is still so much more to be accomplished. I still feel there is too much racism in society, especially anywhere besides the West Coast. The West Coast is probably the most liberal anywhere and it's still got a lot of work to do. There is still racial tension with some people, the way that they may have been raised. I think we need to come together as a community and as a society. Make a new friend today, no matter the color of your skin. Do something in your own life to release racial tension. If everyone does something in their own life, it can only improve society's ignorant viewpoints. MLK, Jr. deserves it; he gave his life for our sake.\n\nWynne McIntosh, University of Portland,\n\nPortland, Oregon\n\nI remember Dr. King very well. He came within 40 miles of my hometown in Maben, Miss. in the 1960's. I lived 40 miles from where James Meredith entered Ole Miss. I remember several white men from our town going to Oxford to help stop integration of the University. Also during the time of 3 civil rights workers who were killed, I remember the search team coming through my town headed to Philadelphia, Miss. looking for these men who were later found dead.\n\nI have great respect for the dream of Dr. King. I cannot think of a better reason for one person to give his life for. I did not realize the full impact of the movement at the time. I was only 16 yrs. old. Many people from my town followed him on several marches across the country. He was an amazing person to be around according to those who followed him. He fired up every person. Some that followed him didn't care whether they lived or died, as long as they were standing up for what was right. Dr. King will always be dear to me and the dream has already been carved into my children. I look forward to seeing Dr. King in Heaven someday ... Jesus said he that loses his life for a friend shall gain it eternally.\n\nTommie Heard, Murfreesboro, Tennessee\n\nIt is very important that we try to understand the diversities of all races of the American society. I am a Dallasite by choice. It amazes me how this holiday is observed by few and totally ignored by so many. Most people I know are not sure how to discuss their feelings, good or bad in reference to this day. Not much is done outside of the black community. I commend the Seattle Times for your choice and commitment. I intend to share this with my company which is State Farm Insurance.\n\nSteven Burlison, Farmers Branch, Texas\n\nComing from the standpoint of a student born long after the Civil Rights Revolution, the sixties and most of the seventies, this whole day is one large illusion of peace and goodwill in a time of turmoil and persecution. It was not until I took an interest in rebellion and protest that I was even exposed to the true nature of Dr. King's dream.\n\nI'll save you time and screen space by not making empty exaltations about one man's greatness. Instead I use the rest of my time and space to remind you of his vision or his \"dream\".\n\nCommitted to non-violent protest, he fought the opposition with moral conviction. He dedicated his life to the abolishment of injustice; not because he sought fame or glory, but because he felt a moral conviction and obligation to do so. He understood that to stand idly by as injustice ran rampant was to condone it by compliance. He could not look the other way as people, of any race, creed or sex, were discriminated against. \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere\"  King.\n\nAnd with that I leave you to your thoughts and convictions. Feel free to mail me in response.\n\nPhil Pluckebaum, Redwood High, Grade 11\n\nVisalia, California\n\nI think M.L.K.'s dream was an admirable one. He saved the world from hatred. He is one of the greatest men that ever lived.\n\nCheryl Baker, Nelsen Middle School, Grade 8\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\nI think it is neat. I like Martin Luther King's day. If I had a dream it would be the same thing.\n\nLaShell Tolden, Nelsen Middle School, Grade 8\n\nRenton, Washington\n\nMartin Luther King is one of the best things that ever happened to this country. If I had lived then, I would have helped too.\n\nCheryl Baker, Nelsen Middle School, Grade 8\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\nHe was a great man and if it wasn't for him blacks would still be fighting for freedom.\n\nJordan, Carl Cozier, Grade 4, Bellingham, Washington\n\nI think Dr. King was a great man of God and a great leader. I am sure he is dearly missed by all.\n\nThe civil rights movement has affected my life because I'm sure were it not for the generation before I would not be a senior in college now. By working as a multicultural assistant on the campus of Grand Valley State University in Allendale, MI I hope to keep Dr. King's dream alive. I also hope to be instrumental in helping his dream become a reality, because looking over his \"I have a dream\" speech, what he desired has not yet come to pass.\n\nDoresa Perry, Grand Valley State University, senior\n\nAllendale, Michigan\n\nAs an adult who grew up in the tumultuous 60's, I am so uplifted to see that young people now are understanding the message Dr. King so eloquently told us without violence or retribution. It was so sad that so many during his lifetime didn't get \"it\". The heart condition of mankind has always been lacking, but after reading the comments of students, I have a renewed hope for the future.\n\nDebra Smith-Lovato, Kent, Washington\n\nMostly I remember Dr. King from coverage of the movement. His ministry was a major force in my life paradigm. It saddens me that his \"Letter from the Birmingham Jail\" continues to be relevant.\n\nIn the intense days after his death, television coverage included an interview with one of his sons (likely his oldest). The boy, age 9 (I recall), was asked if he hated the man being held for his father's murder. The boy's answer defined his father for me as much as anything:\n\n\"My father taught me not to hate anyone.\"\n\nPam Rider, San Diego, California\n\nYesterday (1/15/96) Martin Luther King Jr.'s daughter, Yolanda, came to Minneapolis, Minnesota. She gave a beautiful speech about her father. At first it started out a little bit uninteresting but after all we got something out of it. We got a first-hand experience about what life is really about, then and now. After all Dr. King really was a great, kind, loving man for his country. He was very intelligent, sensitive; he was very handsome, full of thoughts and full of joy. Most of all he showed young kids what was right from wrong. He showed people how to stop the violence. He fought with words and not with his hands. He did what he could to try to stop the violence.\n\nKenyatta Roberson and Verna Williams, Northeast Middle School, Grades 6-8\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. was a man to be admired. He showed us that we, as people, need to stick together. Throughout history people have been discriminated against and he started a movement that has shown people not to judge, but to love. He had a dream that needs to be carried on, and our generation should be the one to do it. If you're not part of the solution, you are part of the problem.\n\nBess Dwyer, Mountlake Terrace High School, Grade 10\n\nMountlake Terrace, Washington\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. was a man with a dream. He devoted his life to the cause of human equality using non-violence. In my eyes, he was a champion of the human race. Today, his dream is still alive and the struggle continues.\n\nJennifer C. Johnson, Archbishop Carroll High School, Grade 11\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nI read a lot of what people said. I think that all Americans, just not blacks nor whites, but all Americans should live by the example that Dr. King was trying to give. I'm a black man who in his school is trying to make a difference. I was created by God like everybody else. People need to stop the violence and need to love one another. If Dr. King had used a gun or a knife to get his point across where would we be? A lot of black men need to stop killing each other. They need to work together and try to keep Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream alive.\n\nGarrett Williams, Graceland College\n\nLamoni, Iowa\n\nI am a 17-year-old white male, and what I would like to know (with the highest respect for black people) is, what caused the \"downfall\" of blacks from the level of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his followers, to the condition today?\n\nAlan Weissman, Concord High, Grade 12\n\nWilmington, Delaware\n\nDr. King changed the moral values of a significant part of America. The idea of non-violent change is still a part of American problem-solving.\n\nWalshes, Chicago, Illinois\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. was a great man. He taught us a lot about fairness and about peace. We still have a lot to learn from his life.\n\nHunter Widell, St. Anne's, Grade 1\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\nI think Martin Luther King did his best to help race relations. He truly inspired us all.\n\nErik Houser, Twin City Elementary, Grade 2\n\nStanwood, Washington\n\nHe made peace out of blacks and whites. He won the Nobel Peace Award. He taught me to live in peace.\n\nBen H., Alternative Elementary #2, Grade 2\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\nI think Martin Luther King Jr. is a man who got people motivated to do what was needed and not to leave it up to him or other important leaders to do.\n\nNick Moats, King's Schools, Grade 8\n\nLynnwood, Washington\n\nJust a little comment ...\n\nI believe that the inclusion of all people in the destiny of humankind is what made Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. great. I see his statements as the most mature to date, reflecting the realization that today there is no supreme in-group anymore.\n\nWith everyone having their cultural horizon destroyed so quickly the backlash from this breakdown was inevitable. What Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned was what was actually happening right before everyone's eyes: the creation of a world that the religious historian and mythologist Joseph Campbell called a world with \"no horizons.\"\n\nI believe it to be true that the wisest humans are able to see the brilliance of a subject, while others see only one aspect. Others for centuries have reacted to realizing foreign people were coming by turning away, talking about strengthening a separate community rather than embracing the possibility of a wonderfully diverse community.\n\nHis words remind me of the remarkable acceptance of Chief Seattle when Europeans began to take over tribal lands. Humans of vision see change as healthy and positive, while others may take the route of trying to hold on to the disappearing horizons, even though they have already disappeared.\n\nIt is a very dangerous time, but one of the greatest the world has ever known, thanks to Dr. King, and those who challenge the truths of all known horizons.\n\nDennis Lanigan, Juanita High School, Grade 12\n\nKirkland, Washington\n\nWhat can we do to help make his dream come true?\n\n\"I could cheer people up and give poor people food and shelter and care.\"\n\nAshly S.\n\n\"When people feel bad, I can help them feel better.\"\n\nGeneva L.\n\n\"I can work hard to earn freedom for everyone.\"\n\nDaniel H.\n\n\"We can throw away violent stuff and try not to be mean.\"\n\nLaurel S.R.\n\n\"I can treat people the way I want to be treated.\"\n\nMaria S.\n\n\"I believe in the dream, I can tell it to people, and act like in my dream.\"\n\nKim W.\n\n\"I can help other people and take them places.\"\n\nCalvin V.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if you are black or white to have civil rights. Just believe it yourself.\"\n\nGabby M.\n\nGrant Street School, Grade 2\n\nPort Townsend, Washington\n\nI am not a child, I lived the history from the beginning to the end. I pray that we can rekindle the spark and let the \"Dream\" live on. God bless Dr. King and his family for their sacrifice.\n\nDoris D. Holmes, Kent State University, Freshman\n\nNiles, Ohio\n\nMartin Luther King was really good for the American people. He helped us realize that all people are created equal.\n\nJohn Fry, Espaniola High School, Grade 12\n\nEspaniola, New Mexico\n\nLos Alamos Middle School, Los Alamos, N.M.\n\nSometimes white men shudder when they look at black. Sometimes black shudders at white. We are still not perfect, man.\n\nMike Dugger, Grade 7\n\nI think Martin Luther King was a great man who shouldn't have been shot.\n\nNick Cummings, Grade 2\n\nMartin Luther King was a great man who changed the US and the world forever. He accomplished so much for civil rights and equality, no one deserves a national holiday more than him.\n\nCourtney Habbersett, Grade 8\n\nI think that Martin Luther King Jr. was a great leader and a great person.\n\nAngelo Montoya, Grade 8\n\nMartin Luther King was a great man and no man deserves to die fighting for people's rights.\n\nCarlos Ramirez, Grade 8\n\nMartin Luther King was a great man. He helped many people both black and white. And I think it was a very good idea to make this site.\n\nAlexander, Grade 8\n\nI think MLK's dream came TRUE.\n\nKamaal Kyrala, Grade 8\n\nDr. Martin Luther King was a great man. He inspired people to change their minds about prejudice. When he spoke the crowd always was quiet until he had made his point across. He has to be the man of the century. He accomplished what most men could probably not do.\n\nTobias Haag, Grade 8\n\nM.L.K. shouldn't have died. He fought for civil rights. He died fighting for something he should have gotten anyways.\n\nLizzie Kee, Grade 8\n\nI think MLK Jr. is a great man with perseverance and strength. He is a great role model and should be remembered by all. What he did was to try and stop prejudice and it took extreme dedication. This site is great for learning about him and what he did. It is well put together.\n\nRikki Reiss, Grade 8\n\nI think Martin Luther was a great man and should be a role model to us all. He stood up for what he believed, knowing that it could cost his life. I respect him very much and we should try to be like him.\n\nAmy Yactor, Grade 8\n\nKing's dream is coming true.\n\nAaron Mason, Grade 8\n\nI am very glad Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. did what he did. If he was alive today there would be no racism at all. He knew what was right and did his best to teach others. He didn't deserve to die.\n\nKristy Keane, Grade 8\n\nMartin L. King taught us that racism is bad. And I think his quote (\"I refuse to accept the view ... that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality\") will truly come true.\n\nChris Gaffney, Grade 8\n\nI think Mr. King was a great man. People may have been killed when he got laws passed but I think he did the right thing.\n\nBart Williams, Grade 8\n\nI am sorry he is dead. He did a lot for his people. I wish he could see what he has done for the black people.\n\nCarmen Eaborn, Grade 8\n\nThe Martin Luther King Jr. \"I Have A Dream\" speech was cool. The bad thing is that everybody treats everybody like they're not one of us.\n\nChris Meyer, Grade 8\n\nI think that Martin Luther King Jr. was smart and cool and helped a bunch of people when help was needed during a critical time.\n\nMichael Whiteside, Grade 8\n\nHe was a great man that we should never forget about. I only wish there would be other great people like that. He was a brave man to do what he did. If our world had only people like that, our world would be perfect.\n\nLiz R., Grade 8\n\nI think he had a big impact on our community. I don't see much in our town. I still think it is really bad at times and better at times.\n\nElizabeth Ramirez, Grade 8\n\nIt took a brave person to do what Martin Luther King Jr. did. I hope that someday his dreams for racial peace in America will become a reality. The holiday in honor of him should be used to commemorate his efforts.\n\nTera Stidham, Grade 8\n\nHe was a great man whose vision of peace was and is an inspiration to millions. He gave us hope that someday America really would be the land of the free. He gave our country hope and something to believe in .\n\nLeslie Springer, Grade 8\n\nWe think Martin Luther King Jr. was a determined leader, and he stood up for what he thought was right.\n\nBrandi and Christina, Grade 8\n\nHe was a very determined man and his determination brought forth a new nation. He helped out both the black and the white community. He was very kind and never used violence to solve his problems.\n\nSteph, Grade 8\n\nMartin Luther King was a man who was determined to see this country in harmony. Unfortunately, someone disagreed with his ideas and ended his life before he could see what he did do for our country. MLK did not deserve to die at such a peak in his career.\n\nChristine Kelley, Grade 8\n\nI think that Martin Luther King was a tough man and set a good example for America. I also think he changed America forever.\n\nGrant Fox, Grade 8\n\nI think Martin L. King Jr. is really brave and courageous for what he did. I think he was also a very great man because he helped change the world and how every person lives. He helped all of the African Americans by getting them freedom and helping them be able to vote. And to have the freedom that they should have had a long time ago, before Martin L. King and Martin L. King Jr. were even born.\n\nKristin Osborn, Grade 8\n\nI think that Martin Luther King Jr. was a great man. He changed many people's lives and also the world. He never used anger or violence, always hoping to try to get everyone equal rights. I do not think that it was fair to him or any other people the way they had been treated. I believe that his dream came true, but if only he knew ... I do not think that it was fair that he was killed for wanting to make the world a better place.\n\nStacy Terp, Grade 8\n\nMartin Luther King was a powerful leader and a brave man. He had strong views on what America should be like. He was a hero to many people. MLK is an inspiration to me and will always be.\n\nBeth Ladino, Grade 8\n\nM.L.K. Jr. was a brave man. He fought for freedom and civil rights for all humans. I believe in his thoughts and opinions.\n\nLisa Detwiler, Grade 8\n\nI think that Martin Luther King was a wonderful man. He really tried to bring out the best in Americans. Even though he died I think that we should keep trying for him. He would be very proud of how far we have come.\n\nMorgan Gallimore, Grade 8\n\nI like what MLK Jr. did for all people and that he did it peacefully and he was a good example for other peace leaders.\n\nMax M. Baptiste, Taos Valley School, Grade 8\n\nTaos, New Mexico\n\nI think that Martin Luther King had a big impact on the future of Negroes because it opened the eyes of white people and people of other races. His speeches mean a lot if you delve into them. I think they are beautiful. He was strong and i really look up to him.\n\nApril Fleming, Los Alamos, New Mexico\n\nMR. KING is indeed a great man but it is equally important to stand for what the man stood for today.\n\nJames R. Pugh, Graduate of Montbello High\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\nI think that this movement was (and is) great. If it wasn't for him, one of my best friends, Vanessa, and I wouldn't be friends. This has affected my life in many ways. My mom is watching a movie about MLK Jr. and it shows what the KKK has done. It is brutal. I have a Dream also....PEACE,UNITY.\n\nAshley D., Central Intermediate School, Grade 5\n\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma\n\nI really enjoyed going through this Web site. I learned a lot about him.\n\nRobbie King, Westside Middle School, Grade 7\n\nOmaha, Nebraska\n\nIt was not right that King was assassinated by James Earl Ray. He should not have been killed because he did nothing to hurt anybody except to proclaim his thoughts.\n\nChris and Joey, Grade 5, Papillion, Nebraska\n\nPrairie Lane School, Omaha, Neb.\n\nWe think that Martin Luther King Jr. made a great impact on society.\n\nAdam Guck and J.D. Ellwanger, Grade 5\n\nMartin Luther King was great at establishing his views and ideas in a peaceful way. He also is really cool!\n\nMark Johnson, Grade 8\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was a great man and had the voice of a lion. He spoke out against segregation in the South. He and his followers were a big part of society.\n\nSavannah Yapuncich & Kelly Caruso, Grade 5\n\nFremont Jr. High, Fremont, Neb.\n\nWe think that Martin Luther King was a great man and that he did great things for African Americans.\n\nMindy Lewis, Grade 8\n\nPersonally speaking, I think Martin Luther King had a great impact on the human society and the way some people think. I believe that if a man can do all of this, anyone can if he/she sets his or her mind on it.\n\nBrooke Holt and Mackenzie Knoell, Grade 8\n\nI think he was a good man. He was an inspiration to so many.\n\nDianna Lehman, Grade 8\n\nI think that Martin Luther King Jr. was a great man and a great speaker. He was liked by most people. Martin Luther King Jr. was a great leader.\n\nMatt, and Levi, Grade 8\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was a wise man. He believed one day everyone would be treated equal. He was right, but only after a long hard fight.\n\nAngel, Grade 8\n\nMartin Luther was a great man and leader. He gave many people hope. There should be more people like him to give people a chance to dream.\n\nLauren and Cassie, Grade 8\n\nTo me Martin Luther King Jr. was a man with great intentions to give people freedom and the same rights.\n\nMichelle, Grade 8\n\nMLK was a educational man who taught the world a lot. When he was alive he made a difference. Here he is, six feet under and still teaching us today.\n\nDesirae Stahlecker, Janee Vongsay, Grade 8\n\nMartin Luther King was honest and he did not deserve to die.\n\nMitch, Silver Beach School, Grade 5\n\nBellingham, Washington\n\nIn our class we did some bookwork on Dr. King Jr. Here is mine. Martin Luther King Jr. was born January 15, 1929, and was assassinated April 4, 1968. He was a minister and an important person in the civil rights movement. He organized many marches. His famous \"I have a dream\" speech will always remind us of him. He was a man of peace. He did not use violence to stop segregation. He was a peaceful warrior. He looked up to Mohandas K. Gandhi. Martin Luther King Jr. will always remain in our hearts.\n\nShannon Swords, Leal School\n\nUrbana, Illinois\n\nI think he is a very peace-loving man. He died for you and me to save this land. I think he was a man of freedom. And I think his dream came true.\n\nMarsha Zaydenberg, Tanishia Smith, Minadeo Elementary School\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nI think what MLK did for our country was very good. He is a role model for younger children. I also like the way you formatted the info on MLK.\n\nAmanda Silberschatz, Susan Lindgen, St. Louis Park, Minnesota\n\nI LOOK UP TO MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.\n\nZara and Michael, Minadeo Elementary School\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nI think Martin is a good influence on our city. His son came to our city last year.\n\nDavid Samsa, Barnette Elementary School\n\nFairbanks, Alaska\n\nI think he should not have been killed because he was a very nice man, and also he was an innocent man."
