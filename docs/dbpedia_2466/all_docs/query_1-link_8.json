        "text": "Bouncing around, appropriately enough, a variety of hoops-related topics as I try to grasp why 2010 seems to be drifting away so rapidly:\n\nHe had, undoubtedly, many more listeners as the radio voice of the Angels than he did in his comparable role for the USC men’s basketball program.\n\nBut, whatever sport he was describing, Rory Markas was the consummate professional – someone who described the action taking place on the court in a crisp and direct fashion, without sounding like he was shilling for “his” team or trying to audition for an anchor’s role on SportsCenter.\n\nMore importantly, though, Markas – who died Monday morning – was as real as it comes, in his or, quite frankly, any other profession.\n\nGood guys don’t come any more genuinely nice than you were, big guy.\n\nR.I.P.\n\nThere figures to be a hefty crowd in the Lakewood High gymnasium on the evening of Jan.22.\n\nAnd the Lancers’ Moore League boys basketball game played against Wilson that night should pretty nifty, as well.\n\nThat’s the night the gym will officially be named “Tim Sweeney Gymnasium,” in honor of the coach who led the Lancers to their only CIF Southern Section title in hoops during the 1981-82 season.\n\nThe 67-year-old Sweeney – who stepped down, after 12 years, as the Lancers’ coach in 1992 but taught math and was a vice principal at the school until retiring in 1999 – hasn’t stepped away from coaching.\n\nHe helps his son (Tim Sweeney Jr.) coach the highly successful program at Martin Luther King High in Riverside and also coached at Hope International University in Fullerton after leaving Lakewood.\n\nSweeney coached numerous high-level players with the Lancers, including Tod Murphy and Dwayne Corbitt (two of the standouts on the 1982 title team before starring at UC Irvine and Portland, respectively); Duane Cooper (who played at USC and had NBA stints with Phoenix and the Lakers); and Brian Camper and Terrance O’Kelley (who played on NCAA Tournament teams at Long Beach State).\n\nExpect to see most of those, and many others, in the building that night.\n\nIn case you were sitting around recently and thinking, “I wonder when was the last time an NCAA Tournament field didn’t include a program from Southern California?” you’ve come to the right place get an answer.\n\nIt really wasn’t that long ago: 2004, when Stanford, Washington and Arizona represented the Pacific-10 Conference; Pacific got the Big West’s lone bid and Gonzaga represented the West Coast Conference.\n\nThat is how I segued to this observation:\n\nCollectively, this is as bad as I can recall the Pac-10, Big West and WCC being in one season.\n\nCertainly, the Big West is only going to be represented in the NCAA Tournament by its tournament winner.\n\nRight now, at least, the only Pac-10 and WCC teams I see getting into the tournament by way of at-large bids are Cal and Gonzaga.\n\nUSC had the best out-of-conference resume of any Pac-10 club but that, of course, became moot as of the sanctions placed on the Trojans by their administration Sunday morning.\n\nIf the Final Four was being played this weekend in Indianapolis, the teams I think would be participating are Kansas, Kentucky, Purdue and Duke.\n\nBased upon the way they have played, the Jayhawks are still solid choices to win the program’s second national title in three seasons.\n\nCoach Bill Self’s team doesn’t have a have a discernible weakness.\n\nKentucky has the most gifted and dominant player on the college level – 6-foot-3 freshman guard John Wall – and a potent pair of post players in 6-10 freshman DeMarcus Cousins (whose volatile nature is going to cost the Wildcats a game – or more – at some point this season) and 6-8 junior Patrick Patterson.\n\nPurdue has one of the two or three best defenses in the country – its New Year’s Day performance against then-unbeaten West Virginia was among this season’s most impressive – and plenty of offensive balance.\n\nDuke has the best pair of guards (Jon Scheyer and Nolan Smith) in the country and its usual high-pressure half-court defense.\n\nThree teams just short of those four right now: Texas, Villanova and Michigan State.\n\nJacob Thomas, a 6-4 guard who signed a national letter of intent with Long Beach State in November, is averaging 27.6 points per game while shooting 55 percent from behind the 3-point arc for his Columbia Heights High (located near Minneapolis) team.\n\nThree first-team Best in the West selections will be on display Saturday at Cabrillo High during the 10th Pangos Dream Classic.\n\nAllen Crabbe (6-6) and Richard Solomon, both of whom signed with Cal in November, will lead L.A. Price against Gahr at 6:30 while 6-6 Anthony Brown (who signed with Stanford) paces Ocean View against La Verne Lutheran at 8 p.m.\n\nThe most intriguing of the five games scheduled for the event, though, will be the 2 p.m. meeting between Centennial and Etiwanda.\n\nLong Beach State’s alumni band (the Big Brown Music Machine) is set to perform during the 49ers’ men’s hoops game with UC Irvine Saturday, starting at 4:30p.m. in the Walter Pyramid.\n\nA tournament, featuring 1980s and 90s men’s alumni teams from Jordan, Lakewood, Millikan, Poly, Wilson and St. Anthony, will be held at Long Beach City College on Jan. 23.\n\nFor more information, contact Victor Camper at 951-237-5514 or viccamp71@yahoo.com."
