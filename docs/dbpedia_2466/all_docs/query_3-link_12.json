The youngest respondent was 22 years old, while the oldest respondent was 77 years old. Respondents with secondary education (36.1%) were the predominant group. Urban residents, with a predominance of those living in cities with more than 200,000 inhabitants (residents of Bialystok), dominated in the study group. Rural respondents accounted for less than 14%. Almost one in two patients was single. Married respondents accounted for almost 30% of the surveyed group. Detailed data are shown in . The mean duration of diagnosis was almost 12 years (11.8 ± 7.7), with less than 10 years since diagnosis in half of the study group.\n\nTable 1\n\nSociometric Variablen%Genderfemale4329.3%male10470.7%Age (years)<30149.5%30–395034.0%40–495134.7%50–592215.0%60–6985.4%≥7021.4%Educationprimary3121.1%vocational3725.2%secondary5336.1%higher2617.7%Place of residencerural2013.6%city up to 50,0002919.7%city of 50–100,0003926.5%city of 100–200,000138.8%city > 200,0004631.3%Marital statussingle7148.3%married4228.6%divorced2819.0%widow/widower64.1%\n\nThe majority of respondents (60%) reported no significant changes in their lives as a result of HIV infection. Some respondents (16%) received a disability pension as a result of the infection, thus giving up their employment. For some respondents (28%), HIV infection meant the breakup of their family or the loss of friends. About 11% of respondents consciously gave up starting their own family. Only 2% of those infected started substance abuse therapy after learning about their infectious status ( ).\n\nTable 2\n\nLife Plan Changes Related to the Detected Infection n% 1)no change8960.5%disability pension2315.6%relationship breakdown2013.6%no family of one’s own1610.9%loss of friends117.5%loss of contact with the family96.1%moving to another city64.1%change in friends64.1%loss of job42.7%start of substance abuse treatment32.0%lack of choice10.7%\n\nAlmost one in five respondents (18%) changed their job after learning about their HIV status. Physical inability to perform current job (work that was too physically demanding) was reported as the main reason for this change.\n\nThe majority of patients surveyed positively rated their personal social relationships with other people—47% were satisfied and 11% were very satisfied. Only 7% and 3% of respondents were dissatisfied and very dissatisfied in this respect, respectively. Moderate satisfaction was reported by 31% of respondents. When assessing personal relationships with one’s family after receiving the HIV diagnosis, it was found that about ¾ of respondents did not feel that they had deteriorated (72.1%). For 40 respondents (27.2%), the diagnosis had a negative impact on family relationships. One person did not answer the question.\n\nThe level of infection acceptance was rather high in the study population. The median AIS score was 31. The mean satisfaction with life score in the study group was about 18, which is closer to the lower limit of possible values and thus indicates that the satisfaction with life in the study group was rather poor. The quality of life assessed with the SF-36 questionnaire varied depending on the aspect of life in question. Physical functioning was rated high (median up to 95), while the rating of vitality was very low. The mean for the somatic domain of the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire was 14.5, while the mental domain score was lower (12.5).

Measures from the different questionnaires were also strongly correlated with each other, e.g., the SF-36 measures with the WHOQOL-BREF measures at a level of no less than 0.70. The SWLS measure was slightly less correlated with the other variables. Detailed correlation coefficients are shown in .\n\nTable 4\n\nQuality of Life Measures(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(1) SWLS10.450.540.510.610.540.520.50(2) Physical domain (SF-36)0.4510.680.910.740.700.390.47(3) Mental domain (SF-36)0.540.6810.900.630.680.520.47(4) Total quality of life (SF-36)0.510.910.9010.740.730.470.50(5) Somatic domain (WHOQOL-BREF)0.610.740.630.7410.770.490.65(6) Psychological domain (WHOQOL-BREF)0.540.700.680.730.7710.580.64(7) Social domain (WHOQOL-BREF)0.520.390.520.470.490.5810.48(8) Environment (WHOQOL-BREF)0.500.470.470.500.650.640.481\n\nThe correlation coefficients for infection acceptance and QoL measures were positive, which means that the fact of infection acceptance had a positive impact on the participants’ quality of life ( ).\n\nTable 5\n\nPsychometric MeasuresInfection Acceptance (AIS)Life satisfaction (SWLS)0.53Somatic domain (WHOQOL-BREF)0.49Psychological domain (WHOQOL-BREF)0.52Social domain (WHOQOL-BREF)0.50Environment (WHOQOL-BREF)0.42\n\nThe analyses showed that gender was not a differentiating factor in the quality of life of people living with HIV. The variation of psychometric measures within the group of women and men was definitely greater than the difference between them, which was evident when comparing standard deviations against the difference of means for both groups (p < 0.05).\n\nNo significant differences were found for any of the SF-36, SWLS and AIS measures. The only result close to being statistically significant (test probability values of p minimally above 0.05) was found for the WHOQOL-BREF measures. It was found that men’s quality of life in the environmental domain was minimally higher. However, this was a difference of <1 (mean score was 13.9 for women and 14.5 for men), so the substantive value of these results appeared to be small ( ).\n\nTable 6\n\nPsychometric MeasuresGender p Women\n\n(n = 43)Men\n\n(n = 104) x¯ SD x¯ SDQuality of life\n\n(SF-36)Physical function76.427.480.427.40.2593Role limitations due to physical health problems59.946.759.942.20.8904Pain60.535.067.628.40.3404General health49.420.645.820.40.4512Role limitations due to emotional problems75.241.268.343.70.4589Vitality43.614.742.514.20.4667Social functions70.326.675.824.70.3030Wellbeing55.722.454.220.70.5711Physical area68.027.670.625.50.7073Mental domain57.919.756.417.70.5039Total quality of life62.922.063.520.20.9408WHOQOL-BREFSomatic domain14.33.414.53.00.6362Psychological domain12.73.112.53.30.9645Social domain13.33.612.54.10.2816Environment13.92.314.52.60.0554SWLS17.48.418.28.10.5711AIS27.29.328.69.60.3557\n\nAnother analysis looked at the relationship between age and time since diagnosis and the quality of life in people living with HIV. It was observed that time since diagnosis was not associated with QoL, while in the case of age, there were two statistically significant correlations, but both were of very low strength (rS < 0.30). The negative sign of the correlation coefficient indicated that the QoL in physical functioning, total physical domain and total quality of life lightly declined with age. No statistically significant correlations were found between age and time since diagnosis and QoL measures in the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. Also, none of the other measures considered (SWLS and AIS) showed a relationship with age or time since diagnosis ( ).\n\nTable 7\n\nPsychometric MeasuresAge (Years)Time since DiagnosisSF-36Physical function−0.24\n\n(p = 0.0030 *)0.00\n\n(p = 0.9687)Role limitations due to physical health problems−0.09\n\n(p = 0.3056)0.03\n\n(p = 0.7499)Pain−0.02\n\n(p = 0.7680)−0.01\n\n(p = 0.9462)General health−0.09\n\n(p = 0.2584)0.03\n\n(p = 0.6793)Role limitations due to emotional problems−0.09\n\n(p = 0.2903)0.15\n\n(p = 0.0704)Vitality−0.10\n\n(p = 0.2315)−0.08\n\n(p = 0.3594)Social functions−0.05\n\n(p = 0.5548)0.12\n\n(p = 0.1615)Wellbeing−0.03\n\n(p = 0.6852)0.01\n\n(p = 0.9189)Physical domain−0.17\n\n(p = 0.0404 *)0.03\n\n(p = 0.7452)Mental domain−0.12\n\n(p = 0.1389)0.04\n\n(p = 0.6471)Total quality of life−0.17\n\n(p = 0.0392*)0.01\n\n(p = 0.8661)WHOQOL-BREFSomatic domain−0.05\n\n(p = 0.5294)−0.05\n\n(p = 0.5175)Psychological domain−0.08\n\n(p = 0.3571)0.06\n\n(p = 0.4363)Social domain−0.12\n\n(p = 0.1396)-0.03\n\n(p = 0.7224)Environment−0.14\n\n(p = 0.0889)−0.07\n\n(p = 0.3742)SWLS−0.08\n\n(p = 0.3149)−0.05\n\n(p = 0.5414)AIS−0.14\n\n(p = 0.0968)−0.01\n\n(p = 0.8834)\n\nIn contrast to gender, age and time since diagnosis, marital status clearly differentiated the quality of life. Married people showed by far the most favourable measures in the SF-36. Their overall quality of life was about 10 points higher than in the other two groups. Marital status was a similar differentiating factor in the quality of life measured with the WHOQOL-BREF. The least pronounced differences were in the social domain (p = 0.0302), with p ≤ 0.001 for the other three measures. In contrast, marital status did not differentiate the level of infection acceptance. For life satisfaction, as in the case of QoL measures, the differences between groups were highly statistically significant. A comparison of mean values indicated that married respondents showed the highest life satisfaction ( ).\n\nTable 8\n\nPsychometric MeasuresMarital Status p Single\n\n(n = 71)Married\n\n(n = 42)Previously Married\n\n(n = 34) x¯ SD x¯ SD x¯ SDSF-36Physical function77.930.385.221.074.727.20.1859Role limitations due to physical health problems59.540.877.440.139.044.00.0002 *Pain63.830.772.325.160.835.20.3267General health45.419.851.820.043.821.60.2730Role limitations due to emotional problems64.844.085.733.062.747.70.0254 *Vitality43.913.846.411.936.016.00.0061 *Social functions69.924.886.919.567.627.70.0005 *Wellbeing50.023.862.315.454.819.10.0089 *Physical domain68.626.678.323.061.826.10.0048 *Mental domain53.520.165.412.853.417.00.0014 *Total quality of life61.121.971.916.757.619.80.0022 *WHOQOL-BREFSomatic domain13.93.516.11.913.52.6≤0.001 *Psychological domain11.73.714.42.111.92.5≤0.001 *Social domain12.04.314.13.712.63.20.0302 *Environment14.02.915.42.013.61.60.0002 *SWLS16.77.921.78.915.86.30.0007 *AIS27.610.329.59.327.87.80.4345\n\n4. Discussion\n\nHIV infection can significantly compromise the quality of life of the affected person. This impact can be complex and involve various aspects of life, with a number of demographic, social, economic and emotional interactions, as well as factors related solely to the infection, such as its duration, comorbidities, health limitations or adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy. The introduction of effective treatment for HIV infection has not only extended the lifespan of these patients but also allowed for a change in the perception of HIV infection by both the patients themselves and those around them. HIV infection itself is now considered a chronic condition rather than a death sentence for the patient. With this in mind, the holistic approach has become an extremely important part of the management strategy for these patients. In addition to the purely medical aspects, it includes an assessment of the patient’s quality of life.\n\nOur study showed that, in contrast to the respondents’ age, duration of infection was not correlated in any way with the quality of life. However, QoL in terms of physical function slightly decreased with age (p = 0.003), but the strength of these correlations was low. This may be due to the fact that the mean age of respondents was 42 years (35% of the study group), followed by 30–39 years (34% of the study group). A cross-sectional study by Kitilya et al. [18] in a group of 272 people living with HIV in Tanzania, who were similar in terms of age to our study group, found that these individuals were also characterised by poorer QoL in terms of physical function, which translated into reduced activity and physical capacity [18]. Emlet et al. [19] assessed quality of life in more than 200 homosexual and bisexual men with HIV in the US. They found that neither age nor duration of infection were related to QoL in terms of physical health. However, these results decreased with an increase in the number of comorbidities and the resulting activity limitations. Interestingly, experiencing violence resulting from the stigma of HIV-positive status was a significant factor decreasing physical functioning. Additionally, these results positively correlated with a sense of being in control over one’s life [19]. In conclusion, the results of studies on the relationship between illness duration and the age of patients and the quality of life in the physical function domain are inconclusive, with some researchers showing a deterioration of QoL in the somatic aspect with age and other studies showing no such relationship. Wellbeing, in terms of physical function, is a very important element that enhances the quality of life in all patients.\n\nThe prevalence of pain in people living with HIV ranges from 24% to 93% [20]. There are most often pain syndromes due to HIV infection, secondary immunosuppression and diagnostic and therapeutic management, and their frequency increases with the progress of the disease, significantly limiting the patients’ functioning and preventing them from fulfilling social and occupational roles [20]. In our study, pain measured with the SF-36 questionnaire was not a factor significantly affecting the quality of life of respondents. Nevertheless, almost one in five respondents had changed jobs due to HIV infection. They reported physical inability to perform their previous job (work that was too physically demanding) as the main reason for this change. The above analyses showed that physical activity among HIV/AIDS patients is related to a number of complex factors that should be considered in the treatment process. However, for the impact of physical activity on the quality of life to be positive, it is important to remember that moderate-intensity exercise improves immune function in people with HIV/AIDS, while high-intensity exercise has an immunosuppressive effect [21]. HIV-positive individuals should receive professional counselling in this regard.\n\nSince studies on gender differences in relation to health-related quality of life in HIV/AIDS patients are scarce and contradictory, we decided to analyse this factor in our study. SF-36, SWLS and AIS measures showed no statistically significant differences. It was only in the case of measures calculated from the WHOQOL-BREF that one result close to statistical significance was found (p-value minimally above 0.05). It was found that men’s quality of life was minimally higher in the environmental domain. However, this difference accounted for less than one point. A similar analysis was conducted by Rzeszutek [22] in a study aimed at identifying gender differences in health-related quality of life and coping strategies in people living with HIV. The study involved 444 men and 86 women with HIV. It was a cross-sectional study in which health-related QoL was also assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. There were no statistically significant differences in individual QoL domains that could be directly attributed to gender. However, statistically significant interactions were found between participants’ gender and coping strategies in relation to the domains of health-related QoL. It was found that access to emotional support had a positive impact on the quality of life in the environmental, social and psychological domains only in the female group, while in the male group, the use of emotional support was negatively correlated with the somatic domain [21]. A study by Gebremichael et al. [23] on the impact of gender on health-related QoL in people living with HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia suggests that QoL differs significantly between genders. A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among 520 patients with HIV/AIDS receiving antiretroviral therapy using the WHOQOL-HIV BREF questionnaire. It found that women had significantly lower QoL in the somatic, psychological, social and environmental domains compared to men, with the exception of social and spiritual relationships [23]. In their meta-analysis of 49 studies conducted in highly developed countries, Degroote et al. [12] concluded that gender was sometimes a differentiating factor between men and women with HIV in terms of quality of life, but some of the results did not confirm this relationship. In those cases where such a difference did occur, women scored lower than men [12]. The impact of gender on QoL of people living with HIV was also investigated by Fumaz et al. [24] among an HIV-positive Spanish population. The sample consisted of 744 patients, of whom 538 (72.3%) were men. Analysis of the results showed that women exhibited more emotional distress and negative moods related to HIV infection, were less satisfied with their body image and experienced more discriminatory behaviour than men [24]. Thus, as can be seen, the relationship between gender and QoL in seropositive individuals cannot be stated unequivocally, and those that do occur may be due to, for example, the sociocultural background of the community. As quality of life is influenced by multiple independent factors, it may be that the observed gender differences are secondary to these factors.\n\nIn our study, single people made up 40% of the study group, and therefore, we assessed whether the respondents’ marital status had an impact on their quality of life. The results clearly confirmed this relationship, in favour of those married. The highest level of QoL in this group of respondents was found in the context of the SF-36 measures, where the overall QoL of the respondents was found to be on average 10 points higher than in the other two groups. In a similar way, marital status differentiated QoL measured with the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. The least pronounced differences were found for the social domain (p = 0.0302), with probability values p ≤ 0.001 for the other three measures. The marital status of respondents did not, however, differentiate the level of infection acceptance (AIS). For satisfaction with life (SWLS), as for the QoL measures, the differences between the groups proved highly statistically significant (p = 0.0007). A comparison of the mean or median showed that married persons were characterised by the highest life satisfaction. The positive impact of the marital relationship on the QoL in seropositive individuals has been confirmed by numerous studies. Joulaei et al. [25] found a statistically significant association between marital status and quality of life, with married patients presenting a significantly higher QoL compared to single patients. Khademi et al. [1], who conducted their study in a sample of 364 HIV-positive patients, also confirmed that being married vs. single correlated positively with overall QoL, as well as psychological and social relationships in people living with HIV (p ˂ 0.001) [1]. There are a number of studies [26,27,28] that clearly show a strong relationship between marital status and QoL among seropositive people, demonstrating that the absence of a formal marriage was significantly associated with lower QoL among HIV-positive people. In conclusion, the impact of the marital relationship on the QoL of HIV-positive people is definitely positive and confirmed. The problem, on the other hand, may be related to those relationships in which there is serodiscordance, i.e., only one partner is seropositive. Determining the level of QoL and marital satisfaction in HIV seroconcordant and HIV serodiscordant couples, compared to healthy couples, became the focus of a study by Faraji et al. [29]. Quality of life and marital satisfaction were assessed using a short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) and the ENRICH questionnaire, respectively. The study confirmed that quality of life and marital satisfaction were significantly higher in healthy couples than in the two other study groups (p < 0.001). In contrast, there was no significant difference between QoL and marital satisfaction between seroconcordant and serodiscordant groups; however, marital satisfaction was higher in men than in women in these groups [29].\n\nLimitations\n\nResearch on the quality of life in HIV-positive persons is a complex process that requires specialised knowledge, interpersonal skills and, above all, the maintenance of a high ethical level at every stage of the study. In order to make the above assessment as reliable as possible, it becomes necessary to study many aspects of life, including the intimate sphere, which is often an extremely difficult subject for HIV-positive patients. The assistance in completing the survey and questionnaires offered to patients was not met with respondents’ approval. It should be emphasised that in order to maintain a high ethical standard, respondents were informed that they could withdraw from this study at any stage.\n\nIn analysing the research data, it was found that one or more questions, mainly related to the intimate sphere, were not answered. Given the very broad scope of this study, and therefore the necessity to complete an extensive survey and four questionnaires (SF-36, AIS, WHOQOL-BREF and SWLS), it can be assumed that some respondents may have consciously skipped selected questions. It can also be assumed that this may have resulted from accidental or deliberate omission, due to the overly intimate nature of the questions or the voluminous nature of the questionnaires. The questionnaires completed by the respondents were handed over to the medical staff (doctor, nurse) involved in the patient’s therapy. Although each questionnaire was prepared in such a way that those receiving it from the patients did not have direct access to the contents (a sealed return envelope was used), it can be assumed that some respondents may have had concerns about whether the confidentiality principle applicable to the survey would actually be maintained. In the future, consideration should be given to providing a specially prepared and secured box for this purpose. It is also possible that some questions were incomprehensible to respondents. The place where the survey was completed may also have been the reason why some questions were left unanswered. Some respondents took the questionnaire home, while others did not for personal reasons. This group chose to complete the questionnaire either while at the doctor’s appointment (in a specially prepared room) or in the patient room (the group being hospitalised). This could have been a reason for respondents to be distracted or to fill in the forms superficially, without deeper reflection, due to haste or impatience (having to return to work, home duties or public transport schedules). Also, some of those who decided to take the questionnaire home did not return them. It must be assumed that they simply did not intend to take part in the survey. Therefore, the quality of life of patients treated in the Observation and Infection Clinic with the Subunit for HIV/AIDS Patients at the Teaching Hospital of the Medical University of Bialystok does not refer to the total group of seropositive individuals attending the Centre. In the future, it would be advisable to consider involving interviewers who would provide assistance in completing the questionnaires or using fewer survey tools.\n\nAnother limitation was small sample size, which may result in difficulty in achieving statistical significance, particularly for groups with small size (females, etc.). In addition, a survey questionnaire that was too extensive (several similar scales) could cause fatigue of respondents with the survey, in particular with similar content of questions regarding QoL."
