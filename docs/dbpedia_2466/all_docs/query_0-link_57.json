        "text": "Idaho became a magnet for ambitious prospectors in the mid-1800s. People from all over flocked to Clearwater, Boise Basin, and the Owyhees in search of gold. By 1862, significant lodes were discovered in Boise Basin, making it a top destination for placer miners virtually overnight. In 1863, Michael Jordan and his party of twenty-nine men and sixty horses left Boise Basin for Southwest Idaho’s Owyhee Mountains in pursuit of rumored deposits. They stumbled upon a gold-filled creek near the mountains, and after establishing camp, they named the creek after Jordan, which eventually led to the name of the surrounding valley and town.\n\nThe discovery of gold in the Owyhee Mountains in 1863 spurred the need for better transportation infrastructure. At the time, routes for packing out the yields of gold from mining towns like Ruby City and Silver City in the Owyhees and getting them to the mint in San Francisco were difficult, inefficient, and unreliable. From 1863 to 1865, transportation companies from Oregon and California worked on trails to the Owyhee mines, but despite the investments, their routes left a lot to be desired and, at times, were unusable. Silas Skinner, from the Isle of Man, saw an opportunity and formed two road companies to undertake the ambitious project of constructing a complete and navigable toll road through rugged terrain.\n\nSkinner partnered with H.C. Laughlin and began construction on the project, repairing old roads and creating new ones, meanwhile overcoming natural obstacles such as hardened lava fields, steep gradients, and unpredictable weather with basic tools, manual labor, and oxen. Nearing completion in late December 1865, Skinner applied to the Idaho Territorial Legislature for franchises to operate two toll roads: one was for the existing Reynolds Creek Road he repaired, and the other was for a new road extending from Ruby City to the Oregon border via Jordan Creek. Skinner’s applications for toll road franchises were approved by the Third Session of the Idaho Territorial Legislature on January 3, 1866. Governor Lyon signed off on these franchises, allowing him to charge a toll on the Idaho portions of the road, and as the news spread, freighters eagerly anticipated the full opening of the road. In Sacramento, a train of one hundred horses, eight mules, eight yokes of cattle, thirty men, and twenty-five wagons capable of carrying 4500 to 6000 pounds each were prepared by April 1866 to head to Idaho. Skinner opened his highly anticipated toll route a few weeks later, in May 1866. By then, the road spanned approximately seventy miles from Silver City in the Owyhee Mountains down Jordan Creek to its junction with the Owyhee River at Duncan’s Ferry.\n\nThe toll road opened up transport to new arteries and provided a vital link to Chico, CA, for transport to the mint in San Francisco, significantly reducing travel times to and from the Owyhees. On the renovated Reynolds Road, tolls ranged from five cents per head for sheep and swine to a three-dollar toll for a four-horse team and one loaded wagon. Rates were approximately double on the newly constructed road. Skinner’s toll system funded road maintenance and improvements, essential for the road’s survival in harsh conditions under heavy use.\n\nSkinner’s toll road boosted trade and economic growth in the region, fostering new stage stops, ranches, and settlements. The rapid development also led to conflicts with Native American tribes, prompting the establishment of military posts along the Idaho-Oregon border to protect settlers, including Camp Lyon. However, soldiers offered little protection and freighters would travel in companies of ten or more, camping in circles around their fire to protect themselves against raiders and outlaws.\n\nSilas Skinner’s influence extended beyond road construction; he invested in mining and ranching, bolstering the region’s economic stability. As mining activity declined by the late 1870s, the road’s importance waned, and Silas sold off parts of the Skinner Toll Road. In 1878, after Owyhee County purchased much of the road in Idaho, the Skinners relocated to a new ranch further down the valley before moving to Napa Valley, CA for the remainder of Silas’ life. After Silas died in 1886, the Skinner family returned to Jordan Valley, where the family remains. The historic Skinner Rockhouse, built in 1872 and owned by the family since 1929, now operates as a coffee and ice cream shop, serving as a testament to their enduring presence and contributions to Jordan Valley.\n\nThe Skinner Toll Road’s legacy endures in tales of hardship and success from the Owyhee mining era, marking a lasting impact on Idaho’s economic and social fabric. Today, remnants of the road exist as segments of modern highways, local roads, work roads, mountain biking trails, and cattle grazing fields. Historical stations and structures remind modern visitors of its significance, preserving a piece of Idaho’s past.\n\nWritten by Noé Zepeda\n\nhttp://skinnerfamilynw.org/history/skinner%20toll%20road.htm\n\nhttps://skinnersrockhouse.com/\n\nhttps://history.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/0427.pdf\n\nSkinner Toll Road\n\nImage: http://www.skinnerfamilynw.org/images/gallery/skinner%20map.jpg\n\nWho’s ready for a short history pop quiz?\n\nWhat do the following Gem State campgrounds share in common? Here’s the list: Lake Walcott State Park near Rupert; Twin Creeks Campground just outside of North Fork in east central Idaho; Heyburn State Park, Idaho’s first state park, built on Lake Chatcolet north of Plummer; and finally, let’s throw in a series of smaller campgrounds along the banks of the South Fork of the Salmon River east of McCall.\n\nNeed a hint? Ok, consider the fact that all of these recreational sites are linked to one of the most successful federal programs ever created, an all-out effort designed to put hundreds of thousands of Americans back to work and, at the same time restore and improve millions of acres of forests and public lands across the country.\n\nThe fact is, each of these campgrounds, along with hundreds of other projects across the state, were built or improved thanks to the handiwork of the Civilian Conservation Corps. Better known as the CCC, this New Deal program launched by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1933 was a response to a nation languishing in economic depression and the 1929 stock market crash. But the CCC had more practical ambitions, such as rejuvenating America’s natural resources that had been damaged by overcutting, overgrazing, soil depletion, farm closures and devastating wildfires.\n\nAs Idahoans gear up for a summer of camping, hiking, fishing, and exploring state parks and national forests, it seems timely to take a glimpse back in time and examine the CCC’s impact on the state’s abundant and enduring recreational resources. Whether it’s building campgrounds, fish hatcheries, or fire lookouts – many of which are rented out for lodging today – or constructing roads, trails, and bridges through forest lands, the CCC’s fingerprints are scattered all across Idaho’s recreational backcountry.\n\nOn Apr. 5, 1933, FDR signed an executive order creating the CCC. Leaders in Idaho, realizing the potential of the program, responded immediately. Within weeks of FDR’s action, Idaho Gov. C. Ben Ross dispatched two of his top officials to Washington, D.C., to negotiate the state’s involvement in the new program.\n\nThe first CCC camp arrived on the scene months later. On Jun. 6, Camp Prichard, located on the North Fork of the Clearwater River, became the first operational CCC camp in the state. Over the next ten years, more than 87,000 Americans between the ages of 18 and 25 who enrolled in the CCC would make Idaho their temporary home and job site. When the CCC ended its run, Idaho had the largest number of CCC camps per population, second only to California.\n\nIn many ways, it’s hard to imagine Idaho’s impressive inventory of campgrounds, parks, hiking trails, backcountry roads and other recreational infrastructure without the sweat, muscle of CCC laborers and the engineering savvy of the Corps’ officer class.\n\nHere are a few facts to consider as part of the scope and impact of the program. The “CCC Boys” are credited with building thousands of miles of trails in the backcountry and hundreds of fire lookouts that, for decades, would play a vital role in helping fight wildfires. CCC crews built dozens of U.S. Forest Service ranger stations, some of which the agency rents to people looking for a unique backcountry lodging experience.\n\nIn 1935, a party of explorers, scientists, and documentarians sponsored by the National Geographic Society ventured down the Salmon River, marking one of the first public research expeditions into the Western wilderness. The explorers paid a visit to Camp French Creek, the base for CCC crews assigned to the challenging task of building a road between the river and the cliffs lining the banks. This project, which on paper was intended to but a path through the largest wilderness area in the lower 48 states, was ultimately shelved after leadership determined it was too costly and difficult. In north Idaho, CCC crews blasted the 415-foot Fishhook Tunnel through the Bitterroot Mountains near Avery.\n\nThe impact of the CCC also extends beyond recreation. Crews connected more than 3,000 miles of telephone line across the state. CCC enrollees were on the front lines of fighting wildfires and played a critical role in improving forest health with efforts to control disease and pests harming native stocks of White Pine.\n\nCCC camps in the Palouse helped restore soil and erect soil protection barriers, in and southern Idaho the CCC helped to finish building the canals that play such an integral role in delivering water to crops.\n\nIn the late 1930s, the direction of the CCC mission changed toward national defense and preparedness as war in Europe intensified. The CCC in 1939 was moved to the Federal Security Agency, meaning enrollees could receive training applicable to the U.S. entering World War II. While training for combat was prohibited from CCC camps, hundreds of thousands of enrollees had learned the kind of discipline, teamwork and physical conditioning should the U.S. enter the conflict overseas.\n\nWhen the U.S. finally entered the war on Dec. 8, 1941, many of the new noncommissioned officers turned out to be CCC veterans. The CCC was officially closed in June 1942.\n\nWritten by Todd Dvorak\n\nIf you stroll through Downtown Historic Weiser, you’ll undoubtedly see a castle façade tucked amidst the usual brick storefronts. Complete with sweeping Tudor arches, glass plate windows, stained glass transoms, cylindrical pilasters, and crenelated battlements, the Romanesque Revival style of this building is a whimsical nod to late 10th- through 12th-century European architecture. Except for areas of natural staining from environmental exposure on the stonework, the building looks much as it did initially. The first-story awnings added in previous decades have been removed, and the central stained glass window, once boarded, is entirely on display.\n\nIn 1904, the Boise architectural firm John E. Tourtellotte & Company designed a structure that would become a landmark in Weiser-the Knights of Pythias Lodge Hall. The Weiser Signal hailed it as a “handsome new building” that would be a credit to any city. The Pythian Castle, one of the few buildings designed by Tourtellotte & Company in Weiser, was originally owned and commissioned by the city’s Knights of Pythias. The Weiser Lodge, incorporated on March 27, 1897, has its roots in a fraternal organization dating back to 1864 in Washington, D.C.\n\nDuring their formative years, Weiser members of the Knights of Pythias convened at the city’s Independent Order of Odd Fellows Hall, and two societies agreed that they would share the building. Saturday night on their inaugural assembly, the Knights of Pythias adjourned at 7 o’clock for supper—and to allow the Odd Fellows their regularly scheduled meeting—and returned to session at 9 o’clock. They concluded their final adjournment around 5:30 Sunday morning, completing all initiations and lodge business. As a modest number of 25, the Knights of Pythias Lodge christened itself Myrtle Lodge No. 26, with Monday evenings declared for regular sessions.\n\nSteady membership growth enabled financial milestones to be reached. In February 1904, the Knights of Pythias announced plans in the Weiser Signal to build a castle hall on a lot they had purchased on East Idaho Street. By August of that year, they had all necessary approvals; in September, they began accepting construction and fine trade bids, eventually securing Tourtellotte & Company as the architect. The grandness of the new Castle Hall reflected members’ aspirations for equal prestige alongside the older secret societies; it also represented ambitions of an emerging business class developing in Weiser and across the United States.\n\nLocal newspaper coverage estimated the Pythian Castle over $9,000 or $10,000 in final construction costs. (Comparatively, the city’s Odd Fellows hall cost $7,000 in 1891.) Sandstone for the castle façade was quarried at nearby Sand Hollow and hauled by wagon to town, where it was meticulously cut and custom fit onsite. First-floor occupancy of the two-story building was anticipated by January 1905. At least by February, the Weiser Lodge was holding its regular meetings, as mentioned in the 41st celebratory announcement for the Knights of Pythias order in the Weiser Signal. On Monday, June 12, 1905, Grand Chancellor Charles R. Foss presided over the structure’s formal dedication ceremonies to the order’s principles.\n\nAlthough no longer used as a lodge hall, the building’s legacy continues. Through the Idaho State Historic Preservation Office, the Pythian Castle was officially listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. In 1982, the building was owned by the Weiser Architectural Preservation Committee. Today, the Pythian Castle celebrates its 120th construction anniversary under the lease of Co-Opportunities Inc., a non-profit business founded in 2017 that teaches the community arts, crafts, music, and basic living skills like cooking. The Castle serves as the main office of their Bee Tree Folk School and museum space for the Simpson-Vassar Collections.\n\nWritten by Katie Hall\n\nNext to the jagged peaks of the Sawtooth Mountains and the flowing waters of the Middle Fork of the Boise River sits the sleepy town of Atlanta, Idaho, home to nearly 20 full-time residents. Now known as a haven for outdoor enthusiasts, this town was once an industrious community with hundreds of prospectors, miners, shopkeepers, and others drawn to potential of a Western pioneer town.\n\nIn 1863, a prospector named John Stanley was searching for gold around the basin that now bears his name. Scant yields led him further south, where he struck gold along the Yuba River, just a few miles from what we now know as Atlanta, Idaho. Following the news of Stanley’s boon, miners soon flocked to the area, and after a substantial lode discovery in 1864, Atlanta was established as a mining town.\n\nFrom 1864 through 1867, Atlanta saw an influx of placer miners, immigrants, and merchants. Many of the new settlers arrived because of unrest from the Civil War further East and South, and the name Atlanta was chosen by Confederate miners who incorrectly reported General Hood’s victory over General W.T. Sherman in Georgia. While Atlanta’s population was slowly growing, outside investors became interested in building mills and opening mines, but the town’s remoteness, harsh weather, and rugged terrain kept most development at bay. In 1865, the only road into Atlanta came up from Rocky Bar, the county seat at the time, and winters made it nearly impossible to access, much less transport heavy equipment and materials. In fact, within the first two years of settlement, at least six mailmen died in snowslides while delivering mail to Atlanta and nearby towns.\n\nIn 1868, motivated British investors finally began funding the construction of the Lucy Phillips Mill in Atlanta. Following suit, a company from Indiana began construction on the nearby Monarch Mill in 1869, but within a few months into operations, ore recoveries proved less rich than hoped, leading to a lull in operations for a few years.\n\nDespite the hiatus, small mine operators and placer miners stayed persistent, and the Atlanta community saw the additions of a postmaster, butcher, blacksmith, lumber manufacturer, and brewer. In 1870, the town had its first brewery and billiard hall, the Atlanta Brewery, which crafted beer from local hops. Chinese migrants and placer miners also settled in Atlanta and established China Basin, a small camp on the north side of the Boise River. Improvements in ore recovery and a new road into town facilitated further growth, and by the mid-1870s, Atlanta had grown to a population of about 500.\n\nMills in Atlanta successfully produced gold between 1878 and the early 20th century, but the scarcity of high-grade ore, milling costs, and legal battles between unpaid creditors impeded significant economic development and growth of Atlanta. In 1907, the Atlanta Miners Company constructed the Atlanta Dam and Power Plant on the Boise River to power the mine, mill, and town. Unfortunately, a year later, a fire on Main Street claimed the Atlanta Brewery, The Atlanta Hotel, Greylock Saloon, and the Butler Store.\n\nAfter years of rebuilding, improvements in the 1930s helped open Atlanta to easier intrastate commerce and more efficient mining practices; The Middle Fork Road expedited travel between Boise and Atlanta, and the introduction of the amalgamation-floatation concentrator in 1932 nearly eliminated the long-standing issue of recovery that plagued mills for decades. From 1932 through the Great Depression and WWII, the Atlanta mining district went on to successfully produce at scale until 1953. According to estimates, from 1864 to 1953, the Atlanta mining district produced approximately $16M – $18M in silver and gold, with the majority coming after 1932.\n\nIn 1939, Talache Mines, Inc. acquired the Monarch Mine, Last Chance Mine, and all previously established mining properties along the Atlanta lode. After WWII, production sharply decreased for Talache, and most of the mining effort shifted to smaller, higher grade ore shoots. Talache ceased mining operations by 1953 and leased out parts of the mine to smaller miners who continued producing limited amounts of ore until 1963. At this point, the population, community, and economy had all but left Atlanta and moved on to different parts of the state.\n\nJohn Stanley and his party tried keeping the location of Atlanta a secret, but the town’s significance to Idaho’s history cannot be understated. Today, Atlanta is a living ghost town with several relics of the booming years. It’s now mostly known as a paradise for backcountry lovers, but visitors can explore shops and travel back in time by touring buildings on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nWritten by Noé Zepeda\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://history.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/0365.pdf\n\nhttps://history.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/0202.pdf\n\nhttps://history.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/0009.pdf\n\nhttps://history.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/0494_Atlanta-Dam-and-Power-Plant.pdf\n\nhttps://www.theatlantaschool.org/archives/2019/2/5/atlantas-pioneer-past\n\nhttps://westernmininghistory.com/towns/idaho/atlanta/\n\nhttps://www.goldrushnuggets.com/gosimiinatid.html\n\nU.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2004-1205: Preliminary Report on the Geology and Mineral Deposits of the Atlanta Hill Area, Elmore County, Idaho\n\nhttps://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1205/of2004-1205.pdf\n\nHistory of the Boise National Forest 1905-1976: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p32WI_ir8raPCUA28zGAbMrZaQYi-12p/view\n\nWhat do the giant salamander, square dance, and potato all have in common? While this may sound like a setup for a joke, these are all examples of Idaho’s state symbols—the state amphibian, state folk dance, and state vegetable, respectively.\n\nState symbols or emblems are legally approved representations of a state’s character, history, goals, and landscape. Each state has its own collection of symbols, some of which include state soil, state sport, and state cat. Since Idaho entered the union, the state’s symbols have been unique, quirky, and, frankly, Idahoish because they represent a state that takes pride in its distinct environment, people, creatures, and culture. In fact, Idaho’s first symbol was its state seal, which was chosen in 1891 through competition. A Boise art instructor named Emma Edwards Green submitted an entry that depicted the resources and industries of Idaho at the time. Her design won unanimously and was declared the official state seal by Governor Norman B. Willey. Although it received a touchup in the 20th century, Idaho’s seal remains the first and only state seal designed by a woman. Nearly 20 years following the adoption of the state seal, Idaho approved its flag in 1907, which is still in service today and depicts the seal in the center of a blue rectangle.\n\nAfter establishing its two primary icons, state legislators welcomed efforts to grow the list of Idaho’s trademarks. In the 1930s, the legislature approved adding the state bird (Mountain Bluebird), state flower (Syringa), and state tree (Western White Pine). “Here We Have Idaho,” the song composed by Sallie Hume Douglas in 1915, became Idaho’s State Song in 1931. It might not have as much airplay as Sweet Home Alabama or New York State of Mind, however, it’s still popular in Idaho’s elementary schools and around Moscow as the University of Idaho’s alma mater.\n\nFollowing the mid-century, Idaho dug further for some of its subsequent symbols, such as the state gem (Star Garnet) and state fossil (Hagerman Horse). The Hagerman Horse is a relic of the horses that once roamed North America more than 3 million years ago and is the oldest known relative of the modern horse. In 1928, a farmer in Gooding County uncovered the first set of Hagerman Horse bones at a site that eventually became the Hagerman Fossil Bed. To date, the fossil bed has yielded the remains of more than 200 horses and 200 other species of pre-historic animals. In 1988, the Hagerman Fossil Bed became a national monument, and the Hagerman Horse became the state fossil that same year.\n\nIdahoans’ appreciation for wildlife is evident through an assortment of iconography. The Hagerman Horse is the second horse symbol recognized by the state, with the first designation going to the Appaloosa as the state horse. Other animal symbols include the state fish (Cutthroat Trout), state insect (Monarch Butterfly), state raptor (Peregrine Falcon), and even state dinosaur (Oryctodromeus). The Oryctodromeus, or Orycto for short, was a small burrowing dinosaur found only in eastern Idaho and the southwest corner of Montana. In 2022, a group of elementary school students in East Idaho persuaded legislators to introduce the Orycto as the state dinosaur, and in 2023, the bill passed both chambers with little resistance.\n\nIdaho’s selection of state symbols can also generate vigorous debate, however. In 1997, students at Boise’s Summerwind Elementary School noticed no state reptile. They petitioned on behalf of the rattlesnake, a species they said embodied the courage and bravery of Idaho citizens. Legislators brought it to a vote, but the proposal was shot down because of the rattlesnake’s nuisance to those working in Idaho’s agriculture industry. Another symbol that went to vote but was rejected by the Senate was the Silver Tipped Sagebrush as the state bush in 1988. Surprisingly, the potato was introduced as a state symbol in the early aughts, and even then, it was debated whether it would be appropriately classified as a vegetable. A group of 4th graders made the case to lawmakers in 2002 and after putting it up to vote, the spud became the state vegetable.\n\nCurrently, Idaho has close to 20 State Symbols, ranging from state fruit to state motto. As the state continues to trace its history and shape its identity, one can only anticipate that more state symbols will emerge thanks to the enthusiastic and visionary 4th graders residing in all corners of the state.\n\nWritten by Noé Zepeda\n\nDecades before the Boise State University Broncos took to the Blue Turf and pedestrians crossed Friendship Bridge on the Greenbelt, the BSU campus was actually the site of one of the country’s first commercial airmail trips, the country’s longest airport runway, and the birthplace of an airline that would later become United Airlines.\n\nIt all began in 1926 when WWI pilot Walter T. Varney successfully bid for 40 acres of city-owned marshland and built the first municipal airport to fly commercial mail throughout the Western United States via Varney Airlines. Constructed mostly on a gravel bed, the original airport spanned the Boise River between Capitol and Broadway Avenue. It served as a hub for Varney Airlines to deliver mail to places like Pasco, WA, Elko, NV, and other towns. Within a few years of the maiden flight, Varney Airlines introduced passenger travel in 1930, carrying travelers four at a time. That same year, United Aircraft and Transportation Company purchased Varney Airlines, a merger that would ultimately become United Airlines.\n\nAs demand for air cargo and air travel grew, so did the Boise airport. By 1938, the airport’s runway had expanded from its original 2,000 feet to 8,800 feet –the longest in the country. At the same time, Boise Junior College (now Boise State University) was expanding, and its Board of Trustees applied to move the college to the airport to ease accessibility for in-and-out-of-state students. Between sharing space with the college and larger airplanes necessitating more extensive facilities, the airport relocated its operations to a plot of land in the southern part of the city where the current Boise Airport resides. After the move, Boise Junior College bought and used the old hangars and airport to teach ground and flight school, offering a semi-professional degree until 1946. The college kept the airstrip until the 1950s and eventually built over it to create additional space for Bronco Stadium, resulting in the current campus’ relatively linear layout.\n\nOperating out of its new and current location, the Boise Airport started as a joint-use airport serving air mail and cargo, passenger, and military services. With WWII looming, the U.S. War Department posted military personnel at the airport in the early 1940s and named it Gowen Field in honor of 1st Lt. Paul R. Gowen of Caldwell, who was killed when his twin-engine Army Air Corps bomber crashed in Panama. During WWII, the Army Air Corps leased Gowen Field as a training base and stationed over 6,000 men (including actor Jimmy Stewart). After the war ended, the War Department turned over the airport to the City of Boise in 1946, when the Boise Department of Aviation and Public Transportation began managing it.\n\nAir travel became far more popular and accessible in the 1950s and 60s, with the number of enplaned passengers in Boise reaching 86,000 in 1961 and nearly doubling to 148,000 by 1966. United Airlines was the first company to offer jet service to and from Boise in 1964, and by 1969, the Boise airport had its first concourse. The airport added its second concourse in 1979 and used its outgrown hangar as part of the terminal until renovations in 2003.\n\nNearly a century since its first flight, the Boise Airport has come a long way and shows no signs of slowing down. The Treasure Valley’s boom as both a living and tourist destination has facilitated further development at the Boise airport, including two parking structures, a new rental car facility, and a new concourse by 2025. BOI is on course to surpass 4,000,000 total passengers, 100,000,000 freight items, and 7,000 military operations for the 2024 calendar year.\n\nWritten by Noé Zepeda\n\nIn 1947, countries were still reeling from the toll WWII was having on life, infrastructure, and the economy. Stateside, Americans were helping returning veterans adjust to post-war life and getting businesses back on their feet. But many were also conscious of the long road to recovery for our allies overseas. Coinciding with conversations and policies to help Western Europe rebuild, a grassroots movement called the American Friendship Train brought Americans together to collect and donate food, medicine, equipment, and clothing that would be shipped to Europe and distributed by rail.\n\nAlthough the American Friendship Train traveled throughout Western Europe, the French were the biggest recipients of the provisions. No strangers to love languages, France responded by crowdsourcing its own gift for the Americans and sent over the Train De La Reconnaissance Françoise Au Peuple Americains, otherwise known as the French Gratitude Train or Merci Train. Through this initiative, the French packed 49 boxcars with public donations and shipped them across the Atlantic, designating one for each state and one for both Washington D.C. and the Territory of Hawaii. Boxcars were overflowing with items of French culture, history, and character and none had the same contents.\n\nThe Merci boxcar destined for Idaho arrived in downtown Boise on February 22, 1949, bearing its unique coat of arms to a crowded reception with a parade, speeches, and media coverage. Veterans, politicians, and Francophiles were on hand to celebrate and admire the gifts from the French. Among the items displayed that drew the most attention was a sculpted replica of the Winged Victory of Samothrace, now a distinguished fixture of the rotunda inside the Idaho State Capitol building.\n\nIn the years following its ceremonial arrival, Idaho’s Merci Train boxcar was relocated around Boise several times, but unfortunately was neglected and fell into disrepair. In 1977, members of the American Legion and the Idaho State Historical Society coordinated an effort to preserve the boxcar and move it to the Old Idaho Penitentiary. By 1980, it finally arrived inside the prison walls where it remains today. With the help of military veteran and history enthusiast Tom Brown, the Merci Train boxcar was restored to its original shape and color with a new coat of Ponderosa Blue 51. The contents that once packed the boxcar were donated to the Idaho State Historical Society and sorted for exhibit, including old artillery shells, dishware, and even a wooden stool handcrafted by a blind octogenarian. Despite all boxcars having distinct gifts, each included one “Friendship Cord” made of red, white, and blue threads from the French and American flags that flew atop the Eiffel Tower on Liberation Day in 1944. Incidentally, Idaho received two Friendship Cords.\n\nIdaho’s Merci Train is still located at the Old Idaho Penitentiary and serves as a reminder of a shared goodwill between the United States and France. And although trains may not always translate to thanks, it is fitting that gratitude is the same in both English and French.\n\nVisitors to the Old Pen can view the Merci Train during business hours by appointment.

Although the region’s large lakes—Coeur d’Alene and Pend Oreille—boast of a flurry of steamboats that ferried miners, supplies, and later excursionists across the majestic waters, Lewiston’s water transportation history is equally important to the state’s economic development. The arrival of steamboats to Lewiston, provoked by the gold rush along the Clearwater River watershed, had a profound impact on the region’s growth, economic prosperity, and transformation into a bustling hub of commerce.\n\nBefore 1855, there needed to be more water transportation on the upper Columbia River watershed. Tributaries of this system include Idaho’s Snake River and Clearwater River. In the early 1860s, pioneers and gold seekers were only beginning to understand the water infrastructure of these two Idaho rivers. Yet, by 1863, Idaho’s first territorial governor would select the burgeoning town of Lewiston at the confluence of these rivers as the territory’s first capital city. In the early 1860s, a water navigation company, The Oregon Steam Navigation Co., controlled most of the steamboat traffic in the region. The first recorded steamboat to reach Lewiston was the SS Colonel Wright in 1861, under the command of Captain Thomas Stump. Before this, Lewiston had been a remote and isolated settlement accessible only by arduous overland journeys. The arrival of steamboats opened the region to trade, connecting it to the broader network of river transportation, even if this transportation was only feasible during high water and spring runoff. If not for Stump’s daring 8-day journey up the Snake River over rocks and through rapids, this revolutionary breakthrough in transportation may have been left untapped. This accessibility by steamship, in turn, attracted settlers and businesses to Lewiston, boosting its population and economic activity.\n\nSteamboats remained crucial for transporting essential commodities like timber, which was readily available in North Idaho’s forests, and wheat once irrigated agriculture reached the region. They facilitated the export of resources from the inland region to the coast and enabled the import of essential goods for the town’s growth. This exchange had a profound impact on Lewiston’s development, as it established the town as a vital link in the regional supply chain.\n\nThe heyday of steamboats in Lewiston was during the late 19th century and the early 20th century. However, with the advent of improved railroads and roads, steamboat transportation gradually declined. By 1893, the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company had laid tracks along the south side of the river. As a result, steamboat transportation virtually ended on the Columbia and Snake Rivers above the Dalles, at least until November 1896, when the Cascade Locks and Canal were completed, allowing open river navigation from Portland to The Dalles.\n\nThe history of steamboats in Lewiston, Idaho, is a captivating tale of transformation and progress. The arrival of these majestic vessels not only connected the town to the rest of the region but also catalyzed its growth and economic development. While the era of steamboats has passed, the legacy of this remarkable period is still evident in the town’s historical sites and the collective memory of its inhabitants. Additional development of locks and dams along the Columbia River has made the river’s navigation possible, meaning that today, Lewiston is the most inland seaport on the West Coast. Located 465 river miles from the Pacific Ocean, Lewiston can still receive cargo barges and other boats, keeping it connected strategically to the Pacific Northwest’s water transportation systems and making the chapter of steamboat history in Lewiston a vital reminder of the indomitable spirit of pioneers, and the legacy of their work in laying a foundation for today’s economic opportunities.\n\nWritten by Mark Breske\n\nOutside of movie theaters and disco clubs, one of the largest attractions in the 1970s was the stunt work of Robert Craig Knievel, otherwise known as Evel Knievel. Famous for death-defying jumps with his motorcycle, Evel knew how to draw crowds throughout the ’60s and ’70s, and forty-nine years ago, he brought national attention to Southern Idaho when he attempted to jump the Snake River with his X-2 Skycycle on September 8, 1974.\n\nKnievel developed a taste for doing tricks and stunts around his hometown of Butte, Montana, from an early age, usually in front of friends, schoolmates, and even coworkers. Although most people enjoyed his acts, sometimes they landed him in trouble. After crashing his motorcycle and being arrested for reckless driving in 1956, Knievel heard one of the other inmates, William Knofel, referred to as Awful Knofel. Knievel liked the rhyme scheme and adopted the name “Evel” Knievel, swapping out letters because he didn’t want to be considered evil.\n\nHis early jumps as the Evel Knievel act had him jumping over boxes of rattlesnakes, pools, cars, and pickup trucks. As he gained attention, he started performing more impressive jumps to outdo himself, clearing 50 stacked cars or the Caesar’s Palace fountains in Las Vegas. Evel successfully positioned himself in the national spotlight after appearing on talk shows, ABC’s Wide World of Sports, and record books, so riding the momentum, he set his eyes on his next big jump over the Snake River in Twin Falls, just west of Shoshone Falls.\n\nOn the day of the Snake River Jump, Evel was dressed in his white, American-themed suit and facing a large crowd of onlookers eager to witness history. For this jump, Evel hired aeronautical and NASA engineers to build a rocket-powered cycle with enough force to launch him up and over the gorge, using a parachute to safely reach the ground on the other side. Just after take-off, his parachute deployed and slowed down Evel so much that he only made it about halfway across the quarter-mile-wide gorge, sailing down towards the river on the same side he launched from. Evel survived with a few minor injuries, but had he landed a few feet further into the water, he would have drowned because of a harness malfunction. Despite the outcome, the crowd cheered on and fans praised him for his bravery and ingenuity.\n\nEvel continued riding and performing around the country until 1980 when he retired and shifted his focus towards supporting his son Robbie’s daredevil career. In 2007, at the age of 69, Evel passed away after a long bout with diabetes and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and he was laid to rest in his hometown of Butte. Evel’s career and persona left a lasting impression on people across the globe; forty years after Evel’s Skycycle took off from the south side of Snake River, stuntman Eddie Braun successfully jumped the gorge with his rocket-powered motorcycle named “Evel Spirit” on September 16, 2016. Now, when visitors walk Twin Falls’ Centennial Trail, they can see the ramp where Knievel took off, as well as a monument to Evel’s jump in 1974 at the city’s visitor center.\n\nWritten by Noé Zepeda\n\nThe history of the Boise School District is a testament to the growth and development of education in the capital city of Idaho. The district’s evolution mirrors the societal changes and educational advancements that have shaped the region and the nation.\n\nThe origins of the Boise School District can be traced back to the mid-1860s when the city of Boise was experiencing rapid growth due to the discovery of gold and the expansion of the railroad. As the population increased, so did the demand for education. In 1864, the Territorial Legislature established a public school system in Idaho Territory. Territorial Governor Caleb Lyon appointed J.B. Knight as the Ada County superintendent in 1865, where he established School District No. 1, and the first public school, marking the beginning of formal education in the area.\n\nIn the early years, common schools were small and often located in makeshift buildings. However, as the city flourished, there was a growing recognition of the need for more organized and comprehensive educational facilities with sustainable financial support. This demand led to the first tax levy in September of 1868 to fund public education with tax revenue. Dedicated school buildings like the iconic Boise High School were integrated into the city’s planning and design and are still operational today.\n\nBoise embraced three school districts in 1880 to manage higher enrollment rates and the financial strain of the school system. Territorial Governor John Baldwin Neil signed a bill on February 4, 1881, officially creating the Independent School District of Boise City No. 1. Of all the provisions afforded in the bill, granting a Board of Trustees power and authority to propose a budget, conduct public hearings, and determine tax revenue supporting the budget, has proven to be among the most important.\n\nA newspaper article from the Idaho Triweekly Statesman from October 6, 1885, indicated that Central School was divided into four departments: 1) primary, 2) intermediate, 3) grammar, and 4) high school. Music and art were said to be taught in the first three departments in addition to the traditional courses of reading, writing (including penmanship), arithmetic, and social studies. Garfield High School students studied higher math, science, and college prep courses in the classics. In 1888, bookkeeping was added to the high school curriculum. The Boise District had one of only two high school programs before statehood in 1890. The first graduating class 1884 included two students: Tom G. Hailey and Henry Johnson. The class of 1885 doubled and included women: Hetty Cahalan, Mary Cahalan, Harry Humphrey, and Philo Turner. The sizes of the graduating classes continued to increase. In 1887 there were eleven graduates; by 1900, there were twenty-three, and by 1910 the number had increased to seventy-two. By 1920 there were 151 graduates, and within ten years, the number of graduates had reached 223 (boiseschools.org).\n\nWhile the school district’s enrollment increased greatly from 1881-1930, Boise City’s physical limits also increased as the city annexed surrounded townships and county property. With these annexations, smaller rural schools that developed around the City of Boise out of necessity before 1881 found themselves within city limits, and many opted to join the more extensive Boise District. Hawthorne was the first district to annex in 1907, followed by Garfield in 1910, Lowell in 1909, Collister in 1922, and Whitney in 1923.\n\nIn recent decades, the Boise School District has strongly emphasized academic excellence, preparing students for higher education and the workforce. Rigorous academic standards, advanced placement programs, and a wide range of extracurricular activities have become integral parts of the district’s offerings. Additionally, as technology became more prominent in education, the Boise School District adapted to the digital age. Today, computers and the internet have transformed how students learn, and teachers instruct. The district embraced these technological changes, incorporating digital resources and tools into its classrooms to enhance the learning experience. Community involvement has also been a hallmark of the district’s history. Parents, educators, and local leaders have collaborated to ensure the best educational experience for Boise’s students. Bond measures and community support have enabled the construction of state-of-the-art facilities and the implementation of innovative educational initiatives.\n\nThe history of the Boise School District reflects the region’s growth, evolution, and adaptability of education. From humble beginnings in the late 1800s to today’s modern, technology-driven classrooms, the district has continually transformed to meet the changing needs of its students and the community. As Boise’s population grows and society evolves, the district’s history serves as a reminder of education’s crucial role in shaping the future.\n\nWritten by Mark Breske\n\nSource: https://www.boiseschools.org/our_district/district_history\n\nThe Sacred Heart Mission, also known as Cataldo Mission, is located in northern Idaho and is the oldest building in the state. The mission was the second Jesuit mission in the area. The first was St. Mary’s, established among the Flatheads in Montana in 1841 by Father Pierre-Jean De Smet. Father De Smet was instrumental in establishing several missions throughout the Pacific Northwest, including the St. Ignatius Mission in Montana and the Sacred Heart Mission in Washington.\n\nWhile traveling for supplies in 1842, De Smet met Coeur d’Alene chief, Twisted Earth, whose father, Chief Circling Raven, had in 1740 prophesied the coming of the “Black Robes” (Jesuit missionaries) with special powers who would provide spiritual help for the Coeur d’Alene people. In response to a request from the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, De Smet sent Father Nicholas Point and Brother Charles Huet to establish the mission along the St. Joe River near the southern end of Lake Coeur d’Alene. Due to ongoing flooding in the area, Point moved the building site from its original proposed location near the St. Joe River to a hill overlooking the Coeur d’Alene River 27 miles east of the lake, where it still stands today.\n\nConstruction materials were limited, including no nails being used. The Coeur d’Alene people quarried fieldstones for the foundation and mixed clay and water to create a bonding mortar. They shaped nearby trees into sills, posts, and beams, using pulleys with hemp rope to secure them into place. They weaved grasses and saplings together and applied a coat of clay, creating a “wattle and daub” insulation. The design of the mission was inspired by Father Antonio Ravalli, a priest stationed at St. Mary’s in Montana who had learned construction skills like woodworking and bricklaying in Italy. The Sacred Heart Mission was constructed by Jesuit missionaries and members of the Coeur d’Alene Tribe between 1850 and 1853.\n\nIn 1873, President Grant issued an Executive Order creating a reservation for the Coeur d’Alene people that excluded the mission, which forced the Tribe to move out of the area. Father Joseph Cataldo, who had begun ministering to the Coeur d’Alenes in 1865, made the recently vacated mission his headquarters when he became Superior-General of the Rocky Mountain Missions in 1877. Cataldo continued to use the facility for a decade. Over time, the church was being used less, aside from being a transportation hub connecting steamboats from Coeur d’Alene with trains to Wallace and other mining towns in the 1880s. The mission was no longer being maintained and subsequently began to fall apart. Though the building was repaired in 1884 by Father Joseph Joset and again in 1910 by Father Paul Arthuis, the Jesuits realized they could not afford the upkeep of the structure. In 1924 they deeded the mission and its property to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Boise led by Bishop Gorman. In 1925 Bishop Gorman initiated a funding campaign to restore the mission. With $12,000 raised, Boise architect Frederick Hummel and contractor James Lowery completed the restoration in 1929.\n\nThe Sacred Heart Mission was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. In 1975, the Diocese of Boise leased the Old Sacred Heart Mission to the Idaho Board of Parks and Recreation, establishing Old Mission State Park and ensuring the landmark’s preservation. In 2001 the Diocese deeded the mission and its property to the Coeur d’Alene Tribe. Ownership of the mission was a meaningful achievement for the Tribe, whose ancestors built and worshipped at the mission. As a testament to the importance of the mission to the Coeur d’Alene people, in 2011, the Tribe built a new $3.26 million visitor center to accommodate a permanent exhibit about the relationship between Jesuits and the Coeur d’Alene people and neighboring tribes. The mission is still a popular tourist destination today. Visitors can tour the mission and learn about the history of the region and the role that the mission played in it. The Sacred Heart Mission is a testament to the dedication and perseverance of the early Jesuit missionaries and a reminder of religion’s important role in the settlement of the American West.\n\nWritten by Mark Breske\n\nSource: https://sah-archipedia.org/buildings/ID-01-055-0008\n\nBy law, we recognize March 4th each year as the anniversary of the day on which President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 signed the Bill creating Idaho Territory. From the outset, Idaho was formed in the crucible of American history. Two months earlier, the Sixteenth President issued his and our Emancipation Proclamation. Seven months later, Lincoln at Gettysburg would remind us that all men (and women) are created equal.\n\nJust a week after March 4th in the same room at the White House where he earlier pondered and produced emancipation, Honest Abe, gave Idaho an honest start by appointing the first of a total of fifteen loyal “Union Men” which he would send to Idaho to be our earliest territorial officers over the next two years. During the rest of his presidency, Lincoln kept abreast of Idaho political affairs. For instance, he commented in his 1863 and 1864 Messages to Congress on the state of the Territory’s political organization, the wealth of our mineral riches, and the situation of our Native American relations.\n\nBut what is not so well known about Lincoln and Idaho is that, at the four greatest speeches ever delivered by him, people with Idaho connections were present and even assisted Lincoln at those most significant and memorable addresses ever delivered on American soil! In February of 1860, not-yet candidate Abraham Lincoln spoke to 1500 people in the basement auditorium of Cooper Union in New York City. At first, the speech was a failure, until he received a prearranged signal from his Illinois lawyer-friend, Mason Brayman from the back of the room, urging him to speak louder and project more enthusiasm. Lincoln did, suddenly engaging the crowd, rousing their passions against the extension of slavery with phrases like\n\n“RIGHT MAKES MIGHT.” Thereby, he instantly became a leading presidential possibility. Brayman, the man who raised his hat on the top of his cane to signal, was appointed Governor of Idaho Territory by President U.S. Grant in 1875 and moved to Boise.\n\nOne year later, sorrowful, pensive Abe Lincoln said “Farewell” to a few hundred Springfield, Illinois neighbors in February of 1861 as President-elect, beginning his journey to Washington by train. “I HOPE IN YOUR PRAYERS YOU WILL COMMEND ME”, he told them. In the crowd, were two young boys named Dubois, neighbors who lived across the street and often played with the Lincoln children and even romped and wrested with their father. In 1880, Jesse and Fred moved to Blackfoot. Jesse became the medical doctor for the Shoshone Bannock Tribe. Fred Dubois, in short order became the appointed U.S. Marshall and then was elected Territorial Delegate to Congress for the Territory. In that role, the little boy who grew up on Eighth Street with Lincoln led the successful political campaign to tum Idaho Territory into Idaho state in 1889-1890 and became our first United States Senator.\n\nWritten by David Leroy, President, Idaho Lincoln Institute and former Attorney General and Lt. Governor\n\nOf all the notable figures in Idaho’s history, Polly Bemis stands out as one of the most resilient and memorable. Polly Bemis was born in northern China in 1853. In 1872, she was smuggled to the United States and sold as an enslaved person in San Francisco for $2,500. From San Francisco, Bemis was escorted to Portland, Oregon, and eventually settled in Warrens, Idaho Territory (now Warren) with her Chinese owner. Polly earned a reputation in the small community for her clever, pragmatic, and kind personality. While it is uncertain how Polly eventually acquired her freedom, a census shows Polly living with her future husband, Charlie Bemis, in the mid-1880s. Charlie had called Idaho home since roughly 1866 and made a name for himself in Warren as a merchant, miner, saloon owner, and boarding house operator.\n\nCharlie and Polly formed an intense bond. It’s been noted that Charlie often saved Polly from harassment at the saloon. Polly returned the favor by, nursing Charlie back to health after he was shot in the face following a disputed poker game. Polly would again save his life when their home caught fire in 1922. Polly and Charlie married on August 13, 1894, in their home, which was also Charlie’s saloon. The couple soon filed a mining claim along the Salmon River near Warren, where they mined and established a small farm. Polly grew an array of fruits and vegetables and raised chickens, ducks, and cows. Polly was known to sew, crochet, and fish in the nearby river.\n\nPolly and other Chinese immigrants of her time were never considered American citizens due to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and its extension, the Geary Act of 1892. The legislation prohibited all immigration of Chinese laborers. It also required Chinese immigrants to apply for a certificate of residence and always carry it with them if they wished to stay in the United States. In remote Warren, Polly had been promised assistance in filing for her certificate by George Minor, an IRS collector. Minor failed to make the journey due to impassable winter roads leaving Polly at risk of deportation. In 1896, Polly and roughly fifty other Chinese migrants appeared in the Moscow district court to petition for their certificates. She was successful and lived in Idaho until her death in 1933.\n\nBy 1920, Charlie’s health had steadily declined. He passed away shortly after suffering severe burns in the fire that destroyed their Salmon River home. Polly returned to Warren, and with the help of friends, she rebuilt their home and lived along the river by herself for over a decade. Later in life, Polly left the Warren area and was often amazed by the glimpses she got of bustling towns and cities. Regional newspapers reported Polly’s wonder at seeing a railroad for the first time, riding in a car, and even watching her first movie. Weeks after a stroke, Polly died on November 6, 1933, at the age of 80.\n\nThe National Park Service listed the Polly Bemis Ranch in the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The 26-acre property is surrounded by 2.2 million acres of the Frank Church Wilderness Area, the largest protected wilderness area in the continental United States. During her lifetime, Polly Bemis was respected for her welcoming, bright, and mischievous personality. Today we also see her story as one of true Idaho resilience.\n\nWritten by Nicole Inghilterra and Mark Breske\n\nAs we head into the holidays, learning about the traditions at the Old Idaho State Penitentiary offers us a chance to reflect on our own holiday experiences. Thanksgiving at the Idaho State Penitentiary was welcomed by many who were serving time at the site. But, for some incarcerated men and women, the holiday season was a painful reminder of the distance and isolation from family. However, it is not all a loss of hope and a time of despair. The inmate-produced prison newspaper The Clock is an excellent source of insight into the monthly experiences of incarcerated individuals at the site. Nearly every November issue of The Clock featured updates from the dining hall and what to expect for the annual Thanksgiving meal. The holiday issues also usually included articles written by the chaplain and contributing writers about giving thanks. It was a treat for the men working in the dining hall and kitchen to prepare a special meal for everyone else.\n\nThe dining hall was built in 1898 and was the first building designed and constructed entirely by prisoners. George Hamilton designed the dining hall and oversaw its construction. The ground floor held space for the dining room, a kitchen, and the bird’s nest. An armed guard sat in the bird’s nest to watch over meal times. Down below, the basement had six rooms. Initially, there was a bakery, a root cellar, bathing facilities, a butcher shop, a laundry room, and a shoe shop within the space. The riot of 1973, which led to the site’s closure, caused the building to go up in flames, leaving just the exterior walls standing today.\n\nBy the 1950s, the Idaho State Penitentiary was largely self-sufficient in almost every aspect. Under the wardenship of Louis E. Clapp, the pen flourished in the growth of rehabilitative initiatives and vocational industries. Farming was always one of the industries tied to the site, but it grew with Clapp at the helm. There were three major areas where men cultivated land: the penitentiary grounds, Moseley Ranch (now Warm Springs Golf Course), and Eagle Island Prison Farm (now Eagle Island State Park). The food the farms produced was enough to keep the dining hall and bakery stocked, provide a reserve for the prison’s use, and feed residents at State Hospital South in Blackfoot. The prison sold any remaining surplus back into the community.\n\nIn the November 1959 issue of The Clock, an article titled “The Life Line” described statistics surrounding meal production in the dining hall basement during–and outside the holiday season. The dining hall would feed about 350 men in a half hour, three times per day. Most kitchen and bakery staff would work 7-hour days, sometimes longer, especially around the holidays. The bakery went through 1,300 pounds and 60 dozen eggs per week, which the prison farm chickens provided. Inmates processed vegetables in the root cellar; according to the article, workers processed about 3,000 pounds of potatoes per week! Between the biennium of 1959 and 1960, workers processed 680 turkeys, and inmates consumed 399,182 potatoes. The men working in the kitchen took pride in what they did and especially looked forward to providing a good holiday meal.\n\nThough the menu in 1959 wasn’t published in the November issue of The Clock, the November issues in 1956 and 1971 had robust offerings. Menu items included roast turkey, sno-flake potatoes, giblet gravy, creamed peas, buttered corn, cranberry jelly, tossed salad, stuffed celery, hot rolls, creamed pumpkin pie, and hot coffee.\n\nThe Nez Perce War stemmed from an escalating land conflict between several bands of the Nez Perce Tribe and the United States government. The 1863 Treaty, known as the ‘Thief Treaty’ by the Nimiipuu, outlined the conditions that would eventually lead to an all-out war between the Nez Perce and the US Army in 1877. The treaty era for the Nez Perce began in 1846 with the creation of Oregon Territory. Westward expansion immediately made land in the northwest more of a commodity, so much so that in 1855, territorial governor Isaac Stevens met with tribal representatives to negotiate the tribe’s surrender of 7.5 million acres of land in exchange for hunting and fishing rights. The US Senate ratified the treaty in 1859.\n\nWhen gold was discovered along the reservation’s boundaries in 1860, the US government drafted another treaty to further shrink the reservation by absorbing another five million acres of reservation lands, which became the 1863 Treaty. By 1869, reservation lands were reduced to just 750,000 acres in Idaho Territory. All Nez Perce members were ordered to move onto smaller reservation land east of Lewiston. Many tribal members defied the order and remained on their lands.\n\nDisputes between white landowners and tribal members continued to escalate. In May 1877, General Otis Howard ordered non-treaty tribal members to move to the reservation within 30 days. By June, 600 Nez Perce members gathered on the Camas Prairie, where warriors began war ceremonies. Warriors then acted against four white men in a raid. Chief Joseph and his brother Ollokot arrived at the camp the next day to find out what had happened. Joseph knew an attempt at peace was futile at this point as General Howard moved 130 men to the reservation to retaliate. The military underestimated the power of the Nez Perce and was defeated in the Battle of White Bird Canyon on June 17, 1877, thus beginning the Nimiipuu’s escape eastward from US soldiers. A small band of Nez Perce warriors slowed military efforts amidst the retreat from Idaho into Montana Territory. Brigadier General Nelson Miles led a surprise attack on the Nez Perce camp on the morning of September 30. On October 5, 1877, Chief Joseph surrendered at the Bear Paw battlefield in Montana Territory with one of the most infamous speeches in US history:\n\nI am tired of fighting. Our chiefs are killed. Looking Glass is dead. Toohoolhoolzoote is dead. The old men are all dead. It is the young men who say, “Yes” or “No.” He who led the young men [Ollokot] is dead. It is cold, and we have no blankets. The little children are freezing to death. My people, some of them, have run away to the hills, and have no blankets, no food. No one knows where they are — perhaps freezing to death. I want to have time to look for my children and see how many of them I can find. Maybe I shall find them among the dead. Hear me, my chiefs! I am tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands I will fight no more forever.\n\nInstead of returning to Idaho as promised during surrender negotiations, General William Tecumseh Sherman ordered the remaining tribal members to be sent to Kansas. First, captives began their 265-mile trek east to the Tongue River Cantonment on October 23, 1877. On November 23, the remaining prisoners left for Fort Leavenworth by train, along with their lodging and provisions.\n\nIn 1879, Chief Joseph made one final plea to President Hayes and US Congress in Washington DC to return to Idaho. The government did not grant Joseph’s wish, and he and the Nez Perce were sent to Oklahoma, establishing a small reservation near Tonkawa. In 1885, Joseph and his 268 surviving tribespeople returned to the pacific northwest, settling at the Colville Indian Reservation in Washington. Chief Joseph died there in 1904 at the age of 64. He was revered, even by his adversaries, as a humanitarian, peacemaker, and diplomat.\n\nWritten by Mark Breske\n\nWhen your child is misbehaving, just ship them away!\n\nIn 1913, Parcel Post opened to serve U.S. citizens. For those who drove to large cities to mail packages, no one took the luxury of sending a package from your mailbox for granted. In the first six months of being opened, the Parcel Post transferred over 300 million boxes across the country. Some Idahoans attempted to see just how far they could push the definition of shipping “a package” with access to this new modern process.\n\nOnly a month after the Parcel Post opened, a couple in Idaho was looking for ways to send their daughter, Charlotte May Pierstorff, to her grandparents. This would not be a long journey, only about 73 miles, but to a young five-year-old like Charlotte, that may as well be the entire length of the United States. Most Idahoans traveling between cities would take the passenger train that ran between these two locations. However, the cost of a train ticket deterred the couple. Because the post office did not charge extra for shipping a live child, the frugal parents decided that they would mail their daughter.\n\nWith a weight limit of 50 pounds per package, Charlotte just made the cutoff at 48 and a half pounds. Her parents may not have been the most responsible for sending a young girl to another city alone, but they were wise to see this opportunity to save some money. At the post office, her parents attached the postal stamp directly to her winter coat and sent her on her way. Little Charlotte was then loaded onto a train from Grangeville to Lewiston.\n\nThe postmaster who accepted the young girl as a package accompanied her while on the train, so she was not completely alone on her long ride. Once the pair arrived in Lewiston, he delivered Charlotte to her grandparents’ front door. Sadly, she was too big to fit inside the mailbox, so she was left at the door in the care of her grandmother.\n\nThis incident made national news and caused the Postmaster-General, Albert Burleson, to make many new rules on what the public can and cannot ship through the mail. That summer, Burleson decreed that the post office would no longer accept human cargo or animals except bees. While a box of bees might just be one of the scariest things that could spill out if accidentally dropped, the post office has good reasons for allowing them to be shipped.\n\nCharlotte May Pierstorff was not the first nor the last child to be shipped through the mail. Within the same month Parcel Post allowed packages to ship, a 10-pound infant from Ohio was already on his way to his grandmother’s home a mile away. This journey cost his parents 15 cents, but being the responsible parents, they insured their little boy for $50 just in case.\n\nKids growing up at this time had to take the threat of “I’ll ship you off to boarding school” very seriously, lest they get put in a box and get slapped with a postal sticker.\n\nWith each shipped child making national news, many reporters took it as a sign of what’s to come from future technology. After all, what can’t you mail if a child can be packaged and shipped? May Pierstorff’s story sparked many newspapers around the world to think about how new technologies could be used in everyday life. In 1914, the Emmet Index predicted that people would have long range conversations without telephones and groceries delivered over wireless. While we can order groceries on our phones and have them delivered to our homes, we are far from the technology that will let us download our breakfast over WIFI.\n\nWritten by Joey Przedwojewski and Cathy Charlton\n\nSome experts see the 1925 International Exposition of Decorative Arts and Modern Industries in Paris as the beginning of the Art Deco era, but the design movement emerged in early 1900s Europe.\n\nLong seen as the authority on fashion, France found itself competing with other nations to usher the world into the next era of style. With growing industrialization and a burgeoning arts movement, Germany threatened France’s trendsetter status. After successful appearances at international exhibitions in 1900 (Paris) and 1904 (St. Louis), critics celebrated the rising success of German arts. In response, French designers and art authorities decided they had to do something.\n\nSo, as historian Charlotte Benton wrote, “… the main purpose [of the exposition] was not to consolidate and encourage the spread of an international style but to reassert, in an international forum, France’s authority as an arbiter of taste and producer of luxury goods.” Whatever the organizers’ motives, the 1925 Paris exhibition succeeded in promoting Art Deco across the world.\n\nThe rapid spread and popularity of Art Deco style can likely be attributed, in part, to when it was born. Increased tensions and competition between European countries encouraged growth and modernization. Innovations in radio and film, prompted by World War I, made communication faster and easier. The global stage of conflict exposed more people to more cultures than they had known before. When the war ended, people were primed for any opportunity to find optimism. For some, like the United States, a growing economy meant there was more money to spend on goods.\n\nArt Deco objects, like those shown in Paris in 1925, were expensive. They contained precious stones, were gilded with gold, or lacquered by artisans with years of training. The average American could not afford to buy such luxurious things. Hoping to make money, companies tried to make the style accessible to a growing middle class. New materials, like plastics and synthetic fabrics, allowed manufacturers to imitate the pricey materials. With assembly lines and automated machinery, companies made more stuff than ever before. Soon, Art Deco displays filled department store windows across the United States.\n\nRecognized today as the first international visual and decorative arts trend, Art Deco relied upon inspiration from all over the globe. Patterns taken from the weavings and sculptures of African cultures are echoed in Art Deco objects. Fashion designers adapted Chinese embroidery and clothing styles to the slim lines of Western women’s wear. Art Deco architects copied built elements from Indigenous cultures of South America, Mexico, and the United States.\n\nMany of the elements and motifs repurposed by Art Deco design have special meaning to the originating cultures. Art Deco designers rarely acknowledged the significance in what they recreated, and some refused to recognize creators outside of Europe as inspiration for their work.\n\nRather than one uniform trend, Art Deco comprises many distinct styles. For example, one facet of Art Deco design relies on the use of geometric shapes, heavily stylized figures, and lots of decoration. While other Art Deco pieces utilize simplified, or streamlined, designs that mimic movement and speed. Due to the broad and varying nature of the style, it can be difficult to determine if something is Art Deco. In fact, an exact description of the style and parameters on the era itself continue to be debated by historians, architects, and artists alike.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Art Deco and how it materialized in Idaho, visit The Art of Deco exhibition at the Idaho State Museum. Open through January 14, 2023, the exhibition features more than 40 artifacts that illustrate Art Deco and its inspirations.\n\nThe above text is adapted from The Art of Deco exhibition at the Idaho State Museum.\n\nWritten by Capitol Curator & Museum Registrar Nicole Inghilterra and Museum Registrar Chelsee Boehm.\n\nSources:\n\nArt Deco 1910-1930, edited by Charlotte Benton, Tim Benton and Ghislaine Wood.\n\nEtymologists may lament the less than glamorous history of how Idaho got its name. Idaho, bountiful in its resources and beauty, has no shortage of inspiration for a namesake. The influence of Native American history can be seen in placenames like Bannock, Coeur d’Alene, and Nez Perce. French trappers solidified their place in Idaho history through names like Latah, Palouse, and Lapwai. In the early to mid-1800s, Idaho’s trapping and mining heritage were honored through names like Fish Creek, Hungry Creek, Mores Creek, Placerville, and Ruby City. Following Idaho’s solidification as a territory, new influences like railroads, Mormon colonization, and conflicts between white settlers and Idaho’s indigenous tribes inspired names like Burley, Rexburg, Battle Creek Massacre Rock, and Camp Lyon. A summary of Idaho’s name sources shows that people inspired 42% of names, 30% by descriptive features, and flora and fauna inspired 14%. 4% of Idaho’s names were from transfer and another 4% from minerals and mines. 2% of names were derived from incidents, 2% from biblical, legendary, and mythological characters, and 2% from “other” (Idaho Place Names). But how did the state of Idaho get its name?\n\nOriginally believed to be a Native American Shoshone word meaning “Gem of the Mountains,” Idaho was initially intended to be the name of present-day Colorado (formerly Pike’s Peak territory). Mining lobbyist George M. Willing presented the name to Congress as the name for Colorado under the pretense the name was of Native American origin. The proposal made its way to the U.S. Senate before being struck down after word got out that Idaho was a made-up word. In a letter to the New York Daily Tribune on December 8, 1875, William O. Stoddard would later describe how his “eccentric friend,” the late George M. Willing, had coined the name early in 1860. According to Stoddard, Willing often told the story “With the most gleeful appreciation of the humor of the thing.” Some even went as far as to label it a “practical joke.”\n\nThe leaders of Colorado were still fond of the name, although its origin story was less than captivating. In 1860, a friend of Colorado’s delegation in the Pacific Northwest named a steamboat on the Colombia River “Idaho.” Soon after, Elias Davidson Pierce discovered gold in the Clearwater Valley, leading people to the “Idaho mines,” which were named after thousands of miners arrived in the area by steamboat to prospect in the area.\n\nWhen Idaho pushed to become a territory in 1863, the name stuck. By that time, most people had forgotten about Colorado’s history with the state name and were back to believing it meant “Gem of the Mountains.” Despite best efforts to trace the actual origin of the word, there has still been no connection to tribal language or otherwise. An Idaho bill, introduced on December 22, 1862, somehow got renamed “Montana” before House passage on February 12, 1863. But in a showdown on the last night of the session, Senator Wilson, who sponsored the bill himself, fought successfully to restore the name “Idaho” to the proposed territory.\n\nDr. Merle W. Wells’ essay on the origins of Idaho’s name suggests that its highly probable Willing’s claim to be the originator is accurate. Willing was no stranger to scandal, which may have impacted the credibility of his recounted history, but he was, at the very least, involved in the name’s inception. Since Willing introduced the name in Colorado in 1860, it has gained two widely accepted and unfounded etymologies (“gem of the mountains” and “sunrise”) and a dozen or more other Indian explanations, all of them equally baseless. Had it not been for William O. Stoddard’s recounting of George M. Willing’s story, and for some revealing passages in the record of the early debates of the name in Congress, the origin of “Idaho” would remain a mystery today.\n\nWritten by Marketing and Communications Officer Mark Breske\n\nSources:\n\nIdaho Place Names: A Geographical Dictionary, Lalia Boone\n\n“Prospector”, February 2005, https://history.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/howidahogotitsname.pdf\n\n“Origins of the Name “Idaho” and How Idaho Became a Territory in 1863″, https://digitalatlas.cose.isu.edu/geog/explore/essay.pdf, Merle W. Wells\n\nThis year marks the 150th Anniversary of the opening of the U.S. Assay Office Building, and in May the Idaho State Historic Preservation Office celebrated this milestone by unveiling this year’s Idaho Archaeology and Historic Preservation Month Poster designed by Boise artist Ward Hooper.\n\nThe Assay Office, a National Historic Landmark, is significant for its association with the development and professionalism of mining in the Intermountain West and for the subsequent settlement and economic development of a vast region of the nation’s interior. Opened in 1872, the building was constructed by the Federal Government in 1870-71, and, for a decade, was the most important example of public architecture in the Idaho Territory. The Assay Office is a symbol of the importance of mining in the political, social, economic, and legal development of Idaho and the West and represents the legacy of federal encouragement of mining in the region.\n\nFollowing the discovery of gold and silver, miners flocked to the region. The ore extracted by mining operations in the newly-created Idaho Territory was rich. Between 1861 and 1866, Idaho’s gold output totaled somewhere between $42 and $52 million or about 19% of the United States’ total during this period. This yield placed Idaho third–after California and Nevada–in gold production during that period.\n\nHowever, despite their contribution to the nation’s economy, Idaho miners were isolated from federal services by great distances and rugged mountain terrain. While private assayers could be found locally, the nearest U. S. Department of the Treasury facilities that could provide official governmental ore reports were in Denver and San Francisco, with travel requiring extraordinary effort and expense. As early as 1864, the Idaho territorial government began lobbying for a federal mint or assay office, but it wasn’t until 1869 that a federal appropriation was made for the construction of an assay office in Idaho.\n\nThe new $75,000 building would be constructed at Boise and plans and specifications for the building were drawn up under the direction of Alfred B. Mullet, Supervising Architect of the Treasury with construction beginning in June of 1870. Built of rusticated local sandstone, the two-story Italianate building at the center of its block is surmounted by a low hip roof and central cupola. Decorative features of the design are limited to quoining at the corners and around the fenestration and stylized references to the Department of the Treasury in the façade’s central pediment.\n\nA steady decline in mineral production coupled with the early 20th Century growth of timber production in the state resulted in the transfer of the Assay Office to the U.S. Forest Service in 1933. While completing substantial interior alterations upon acquisition, that agency left the building’s exterior and grounds largely intact. In August of 1972, a century after construction, the Assay Office was transferred by the Federal Government to the Idaho State Historical Society. It continues to be owned by the agency, which houses the State Historic Preservation Office and the Archaeological Survey of Idaho in the building.\n\nWritten By Outreach Historian Dan Everhart\n\nThe 1892 Coeur d’Alene labor strike stemmed from a dispute between mining companies and railroads over increased rates for hauling ore amidst a national decline in prices for lead and silver. The introduction of boring machines reduced the need for laborers in those positions, forcing them into lower-paying jobs. Mine owners reduced wages and increased work hours to offset increased costs, deepening the rift between union workers and mine owners. In 1892, miners began to strike against the unfair wages and hours. When union miners walked away from their jobs, mine owners recruited replacement workers by rail from surrounding states to maintain operations. Union miners often confronted the replacement workers upon their arrival, even threatening violence if they chose to work.\n\nSilver-mine owners hired undercover Pinkerton detective agent Charles Siringo to infiltrate the union and gather information about their activities to combat the increase in hostility and slow the union’s momentum. Siringo joined the Gem Miners’ Union under the identity “Charles Leon Allison.” The union appointed him as recording secretary, which gave him access to all the union’s records. Siringo would then report back to his employers, which subsequently foiled several attack and sabotage efforts by union workers. He was eventually suspected as a spy when the Mine Owners’ Association newspaper published information unknown to those outside the union circle. In fear of retribution, mining companies hired armed guards to patrol mining grounds while union miners began assembling.\n\nOn July 11, 1892, union members opened fire on guards and workers at the Frisco mill. Siringo had warned of a standoff, so guards were somewhat prepared for the ambush—equipped with Winchesters behind barricades. Nevertheless, a three-and-a-half-hour standoff ensued. Finally, striking miners loaded a Union Pacific railroad car with 750 pounds of giant powder. They sent it down the track toward the mine, destroying the mill and reportedly killing twenty union men before taking several captives. Shortly after the explosion, hundreds of union strikers closed in on the mining town of Gem, where a similar gunfight broke out, resulting in three deaths per side and 150 more strikebreakers and guards held captive at the union hall. Siringo narrowly escaped through a hole in the barracks floor and fled to a nearby wooded area.\n\nLater that same evening, five hundred union strikers boarded a train to Bunker Hill mine. Strikers swiftly overpowered staff at the mine before placing explosives beneath the ore mill. The next morning, union miners gave the manager an option to vacate the mine with all staff, or they would blow up the mine. The mine’s manager “hastily discharged” three hundred non-union men from the site, seventeen of whom suffered injuries from gunfire while waiting to board a boat at Lake Coeur d’Alene.\n\nGovernor Willey declared martial law and deployed six companies of the Idaho National Guard to end the violence. Federal troops also aided in ending the standoff, detaining over six hundred miners. Siringo emerged from hiding and identified union leaders and suspects in the attack, which led to eighteen convictions, including George Pettibone, who prosecutors later linked to the 1905 bombing assassination of former Governor Frank Steunenberg. Martial law and the Coeur d’Alene military occupation lasted until November 18, 1892. Eventually, the mines were re-opened, and union miners were re-employed.\n\nWhile the 1892 Coeur d’Alene labor strike was not the end of labor disputes between mine owners and union workers, the events inspired the founding of the Western Federation of Miners in 1893, which sought to outlaw hiring labor spies. The union also moved to pay fair wages relative to job danger, ensure preferential employment of union men, and repeal conspiracy laws against unions. The union was viewed as conservative and economically focused, seeking change through “education, organization, and legislation,” a stark contrast to the violent movement that sought to incite change just one year prior.\n\nWritten by Marketing and Communications Officer Mark Breske\n\nFrom 1872 to 1973, the Idaho State Penitentiary served Idaho from its territorial days through a proclamation of statehood in 1890 to a major riot in March 1973 that destroyed three buildings on-site, including the Dining Hall and the Chapel. The Chapel, previously the “Territorial Prison” building, stood as the oldest building within the compound. Construction began on this three-story cell house on April 2, 1870, with a groundbreaking ceremony and placement of a cornerstone containing a time capsule filled with community contributions. As administrators prepared to relocate the prison population to a new site near Kuna, tensions between staff and incarcerated men overtook the penitentiary. Prisoners set fire to the building, leaving just the shell of the prison’s first structure and accelerating the prison’s closure. By December 1973, buses moved men permanently to the Pleasant Valley Road site.\n\nAfter a battle between Lewiston and Boise, Idaho, for the prison location, Ada County commissioners ultimately approved the Boise site near Table Rock, a lookout point for the Shoshoni Tribe. In addition, the area provided a source for local sandstone that inmates would eventually quarry to construct the penitentiary’s imposing walls and cell houses.\n\nThe compound grew over time with the addition of the 1890 Cell House, followed by the addition of the wall, guard towers, and Administration Building in 1893-94, now iconic structures within the Boise landscape. Despite its seventeen-foot height, guards found the wall lacking in security. In its 101 years of operation, around 500 men and women attempted to flee from the site, with nearly ninety successful escapes, several of whom climbed over the wall unnoticed before guards could stop them.\n\nA series of defined confinement areas awaited those who attempted to escape or commit another offense deemed worthy punishment, including violent acts, disobeying authority, or even throwing a full “honey bucket” (containers used as toilets) at another individual.\n\nFollowing the early use of an outdoor two-cell cage called the “bug house,” the 1890 Cell House (or “New Cell House”) included both a dungeon and a third-tier dark cell nicknamed the “Black Maria.” By 1923, a new corner complex called “The Cooler” with six cells each holding up to six men at once, became the site’s primary means of punishment. After a group of six broke out of the Cooler, the site added twelve solitary cells dubbed “Siberia” in 1926. The final building added to the interior penitentiary grounds, called #5 House or Maximum Security when it opened in 1954, housed both a solitary confinement system and death row. The indoor gallows in #5 House operated only once on October 18, 1957. Nine previous executions took place on outdoor wooden gallows in the penitentiary’s tenth and final instance of capital punishment.\n\nThe prison operated for another sixteen years after the construction of #5 House. Prison staff began facilitating public guided tours for a fee in the early 1970s before the site closed. This form of fundraising and sales of prison hobby crafts transitioned into the 1974 launch of the Old Idaho Penitentiary’s Museum operations, managed by the Idaho State Historical Society. March 21, 2022, marks the 150th Anniversary of the Idaho State Penitentiary.\n\nDedicated staff and volunteers preserve and maintain the historic site, placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Over 75,000 guests from across the globe visit the Old Idaho Penitentiary annually for educational programs and guided tours, annual events, and groundbreaking exhibits that focus on the human experience of those who lived and worked on the grounds.\n\nWritten by Old Idaho Penitentiary Staff Members Jacey Brain and Anthony Parry\n\nOn March 24, 1961, Governor Robert E. Smylie penned a special introduction to the Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology Bulletin No. 18, titled “Idaho Mining Industry, the First 100 Years.” Throughout the publication, industry experts, academics, and our agency’s state historian, Merle W. Wells, explored the history of mining in Idaho, addressed misconceptions about the mineral industry, and provided a snapshot of the industry’s continued importance in the Gem State. These individuals recognized that Idaho’s mining history aligned with the territorial centennial (1863-1963). In preparation for statewide centennial commemorations, they developed this unique bulletin to inform Idaho residents of how the state’s mineral wealth supported the development of the territory and state. Keep reading to learn more about Idaho’s mineral resources and how industries relied on these Idaho commodities during the 20th century.\n\nElias Davidson Pierce and his party of prospectors first discovered gold in the Clearwater River watershed in what would become Idaho Territory in 1860. Between 1860 and 1960, discoveries of other minerals, such as silver and zinc, allowed the industry to grow from the romantic notion of a prospector armed with a pick and shovel to one that encouraged technological advances. These advances improved mine safety, efficiency, and environmental concerns, all while meeting the ever-changing raw material needs of the state and country. Over the course of these one hundred years, the industry maintained a position as one of the top three most important industries in the state, ranking 3rd in terms of dollar value of production.\n\nWhile gold literally helped put Idaho on the map, the state’s leading mineral commodities between 1860-1960 were silver, lead, and zinc. These non-fuel metals had many and varied uses in the mid-20th century.\n\nSilver’s role in human history dates back centuries, and ancient civilizations primarily used silver for coinage. However, by the 20th century, scientists discovered that silver was also an excellent conductor of electricity and heat. Silver naturally resists corrosion, and when alloyed with copper, forms sterling silver. In the 1960s, the photo and electroplating industries used silver mined in Idaho, as did the medical industry in the form of silver fillings and sutures, wires, and plates for surgical purposes.\n\nLead had a particularly high usage rate in the 1960s. During this decade, the United States annually used more than 170,000 tons of lead as an additive to gasoline. Like silver, ancient civilizations also used lead. Some archaeologists believe that mankind first started using lead over 6,000 years ago because it was an abundant resource and relatively easy to mine. The mineral’s properties make it very malleable, easy to work with, and resistant to corrosion. It also has a low melting point and easily stands up to weather elements. In the 20th century, manufacturers used Idaho’s lead in storage batteries, electrical cables, ammunition, and pipes. By the mid-20th century, scientists also used Idaho lead as an important element in nuclear shielding against radiation from gamma rays. Although American scientists had begun studies in the 1940s to better understand the dangers of exposure to lead, especially in babies and children, it wasn’t until the 1970s that the US Congress passed legislation banning a common household item responsible for lead exposure – lead paint.\n\nCivilizations in China and India first mined zinc, and they used the metal to produce brass, which is an alloy of copper and zinc. Zinc discoveries in Idaho occurred in north Idaho; however, the railroad’s arrival was paramount to making zinc production profitable. The Sullivan Mining Company’s Star Mine in Mullan first erected an electrolytic zinc plant in 1926, and production hit record levels during World War II. During the 20th century, most manufacturers used zinc in alloys.\n\nWritten by State Historian HannaLore Hein\n\nPhotos:\n\n1968.121.8 – Metal Bar, ore mined at Bunker Hill\n\n2012.023.006 – Zinc from Idaho, casted as a token in the shape of Idaho\n\n62-181-22 – Silver Bars produced from the Bunker Hill Company, Kellogg, Idaho 1962.\n\nArtifacts in the Idaho State Historical Society (ISHS) Collection can reflect multiple lifetimes of use and stories. One such item resides in the Idaho State Museum’s Idaho Room: the 1878 Weber grand piano originally owned by Caroline “Carrie” Cartee.\n\nThe Cartee family have deep ties to ISHS and Idaho. Originally from New York, Lafayette Cartee traveled west in 1848; he ventured from California and Oregon until settling down in Boise by 1863. His wife, Mary Bell Cartee, died in The Dalles, Oregon in 1862. Their four children Carrie, Ella, Ross, and Mary Bell were cared for by their aunt Henrietta Baker Bell in Milwaukie, Oregon until Lafayette sent for them in 1866. With 24 acres encompassing a barn, orchards, and the first greenhouse in Boise, the Cartees resided in an extravagant mansion off Grove and 4th for decades.\n\nLafayette was appointed as the first Surveyor General of Idaho in 1863; he would hold this position for 14 years. As early as 1886, he served as a charter member of the Historical Society of Idaho Pioneers, an institution that later evolved into ISHS. He became superintendent of construction for the Boise Assay Office in 1869 (which today houses the State Historic Preservation Office), and for a new cell house at the Idaho Territorial Penitentiary in 1890 (later renamed the Idaho State Penitentiary). Both the State Historic Preservation Office and the Idaho State Penitentiary are part of ISHS today.\n\nThe Cartee children had a privileged upbringing in the high society of Boise. “Auntie” Bell accompanied them to the Grove Street mansion and served as a homemaker. All four children attended St. Michael’s Episcopal Parish School, with Carrie and Ella regularly listed as honor students in the Idaho Tri-Weekly Statesman. Lafayette emphasized musical education with his children, and Carrie, Ella, and Mary Bell took lessons from Mr. Morse, the first voice instructor in Boise.\n\nChaperoned by family friends Mr. and Mrs. Falk, Carrie travelled to Mannheim, Germany to study music in 1875. At the behest of her father, she stopped in New York City on her way back in 1877 to purchase a Weber grand piano for herself and a pipe organ for Boise’s St. Michael’s. The Weber travelled by train from New York City to Salt Lake City, and from there by covered wagon to the Cartee mansion, where it resided for many years to come.\n\nEach Cartee sibling married from the upper echelon of Boise families. Carrie married local attorney Fremont Wood on New Years Eve, 1885. By 1889, Wood was appointed U.S. attorney, and in 1906 he presided over the famous William “Big Bill” Haywood trial. Carrie and Fremont had nine children, two who died in childhood. Ella married local attorney Charles H. Reed in 1884. Their only daughter, Mary Snowden Reed, helped organize the Boise Business Women group in 1910 and served as their first president. Ross married Leona Hailey in 1887, daughter of pioneer John Hailey for whom Hailey, Idaho is named after. Leona contributed extensively to forming what is now ISHS, going so far as to store artifacts in her home in 1904 and serving as one of the first trustees in 1907. Mary Bell married John E. McCrum, the brother of Julia McCrum Davis. McCrum died suddenly in 1886, and Mary Bell would later marry Clarence W. Joy in 1890.\n\nLafayette died on September 2, 1891. As a testament to how influential he was in the community, all Boise businesses closed that day and a large group of family friends walked behind his casket as it travelled to Pioneer Cemetery off Warm Springs. Beloved “Auntie” Henrietta Bell lived in the Grove Street house until 1914. She moved in with longtime friend Mrs. Adelina Rossi in 1915 and died at her home soon after sustaining a broken hip.\n\nBy 1941, the Cartee mansion was being used for apartments and Fayette Wood Simpson, Carrie and Fremont’s eldest daughter, was the only Cartee descendant still in Boise. 17 years later, Carl Oppel purchased the Cartee estate and promised the mansion to the Sons and Daughters of Idaho Pioneers with the intention that they move the building. The Pioneers submitted a request to Boise City Council to relocate the Cartee mansion to Julia Davis Park, and the Council denied this request due to overcrowding concerns. The mansion was demolished to make way for Oppel Harvester Inc. in 1958.\n\nFayette’s daughter, Margaret Simpson Peterson, donated the Weber grand piano to the Idaho State Historical Society in 1974. Since then, it has been a treasured part of the collection and has undergone multiple restoration projects. One of the main advocates for these restoration projects is Paul Schiller.\n\nPaul Schiller is a master Steinway technician and a longtime chief concert technician at Dunkley Music in Boise. He originally worked on the Weber grand piano in 1984, a 15-month project that included installing new custom hammers, replacing wires, and tuning the instrument. Then, in 2014, Schiller reached out to ISHS and arranged an extensive restoration for the Weber. Dunkley Music moved the piano to a temporarily loaned workspace in the Esther Simplot Performing Arts Building basement. It took 3 years for him to restore the Weber Grand piano to its former 1878 glory. While most of the piano remains original, some of the internal parts – like the strings and a customized action – Schiller replaced. After he finished, the piano was sent to Provo, Utah for exterior maintenance on the rosewood veneer.\n\nOn September 5th, 2019, the Idaho State Historical Society honored Paul Schiller’s contributions with a proclamation of Paul Schiller Day in Idaho. Thanks to all the time and effort Schiller and ISHS staff put in, the Cartee piano can now be heard at select events throughout the year at the Idaho State Museum.\n\nWritten by Visitor Services Representative Micah Hetherington\n\nSources:\n\nBauer, Barbara Perry and Elizabeth Jacox.
