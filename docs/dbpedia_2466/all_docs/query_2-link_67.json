        "text": "Carrier Free\n\nWhat does CF mean?\n\nCF stands for Carrier Free (CF). We typically add Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as a carrier protein to our recombinant proteins. Adding a carrier protein enhances protein stability, increases shelf-life, and allows the recombinant protein to be stored at a more dilute concentration. The carrier free version does not contain BSA.\n\nWhat formulation is right for me?\n\nIn general, we advise purchasing the recombinant protein with BSA for use in cell or tissue culture, or as an ELISA standard. In contrast, the carrier free protein is recommended for applications, in which the presence of BSA could interfere.\n\n403-ML\n\nFormulation Lyophilized from a 0.2 μm filtered solution in PBS with BSA as a carrier protein.

In addition, IL-3 also affects the functional activity of mature mast cells, basophils, eosinophils and macrophages. Because of its multiple functions and targets, it was originally studied under different names, including mast cell growth factor P-cell stimulating factor, burst promoting activity, multi-colony stimulating factor, thy-1 inducing factor and WEHI-3 growth factor. In addition to activated T cells, other cell types such as human thymic epithelial cells, activated mouse mast cells, mouse keratinocytes and neurons/astrocytes can also produce IL-3. At the amino acid sequence level, mature human and mouse IL-3 share only 29% sequence identity. Consistent with this lack of homology, IL-3 activity is highly species-specific and human IL-3 does not show activity on mouse cells.\n\nIL-3 exerts its biological activities through binding to specific cell surface receptors. The high affinity receptor responsible for IL-3 signaling is composed of alpha and beta subunits. The IL-3R alpha is a member of the cytokine receptor super family and binds IL-3 with low affinity. Two distinct beta subunits, AIC2A ( beta IL-3) and AIC2B ( beta c) are present in mouse cells. beta IL-3 also binds IL-3 with low affinity and forms a high affinity receptor with the alpha subunit. The beta c subunits does not bind any cytokine but forms functional high affinity receptors with the alpha subunit of the IL-3, IL-5 and GM-CSF receptors. Receptors for IL-3 are present on bone marrow progenitors, macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, basophils and various myeloid leukemic cells.\n\nYokota, T. et al., 1984, Proc. Natl.
