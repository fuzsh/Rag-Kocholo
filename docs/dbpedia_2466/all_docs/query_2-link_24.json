        "text": "Eric Friedl/Goner Records Update\n\nPhoto by Don Perry\n\nAlongside Zac Ives, Eric Friedl is the co-owner of Goner Records. He also plays in The Oblivians and True Sons of Thunder.\n\nLocated in Memphis, Tennessee, Goner operates as both a record label and storefront. Like Shangri-La, Goner Records has been a Memphis institution since the storefront’s opening in 2004. Every year, Goner hosts Gonerfest—a still-vibrant music festival stretching several days. For those outside of Memphis, Goner’s frequently updated online store is a hub for what’s new in esoteric music. The site’s message board is a place to get updates on touring bands, small labels’ releases and anything else music related.\n\nLike countless small businesses, Goner has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The storefront has been closed since March 16. I caught up with Friedl to talk about how Goner’s coping with these changes and what their plans are for the future. Goner is and hopefully will remain an important part of independent music’s infrastructure.\n\nInterview by Ryan Leach\n\nRyan: How’s everyone at Goner doing?\n\nEric: We’re good. But like everyone, we’ve fallen into a freefall. Locally, we’ve been doing door deliveries. People have been stopping by to pick up records. We’ve had some success selling online. If we really scale back and don’t spend anything for a minute, we can hang on for a little while. We might have to lay off our staff; have folks go on unemployment. Goner would be reduced to just me and Zac (Ives) as the owners. We could limp through it that way. We’re trying to figure it out.\n\nRyan: Like most small businesses in America, Goner’s storefront is closed. How are these alternative strategies like doing door deliveries and having folks stop by to pick up records working?\n\nEric: One of our regulars just can’t stop buying records. He’ll call me up in the morning—I guess he’s unaccustomed to looking at the site—and I’ll tell him what’s come in. He’ll respond, “Oh, man, I’ve got to get that album.” We then pack his records and he comes by to grab them. We’ve delivered a few records off locally. It’s super informal. But every little bit counts. People have been helping out. It’s been great.\n\nRyan: You had mentioned to me a couple of months ago that you were going to relaunch the Goner website. While the COVID-19 pandemic and economic meltdown have been an unmitigated disaster, it was at least fortuitous timing.\n\nEric: We were getting ready to launch the site when the coronavirus hit. We wanted to fine-tune it a little more and add some things. But once it became imperative that we be able to sell stuff online, we said, “Screw it. Here it is. We’ll fix it as we go.”\n\nRyan: I went to buy the Aquarium Blood LP you had recently released and it took me to a Bandcamp site initially.\n\nEric: (laughs) It really is a matter of working out the kinks as we go.\n\nRyan: While everyone’s situation has changed, in some ways Goner wasn’t a case of just punching a timeclock. Record stores are hubs and hangouts for people. When Trailer Space closed down in Austin, it was a significant loss.\n\nEric: It is weird. We definitely weren’t a Trailer Space-style of hangout, but people on their regular circuit would stop by and explore the used bin. On weekends, we had a big crew of normal folks buying classic rock albums. There’s absolutely no way to sell that stuff online. We were stocked for those folks and that side of the business completely died. We had a bunch of really cool events coming up. You feel like you’re right in the middle of things and then you’re isolated. That was sort of my idea with doing these video check-ins. I sent out requests for people to give us video updates. I want to show people that we’re still in this. Facebook just makes us feel like we’re on our own little islands, which we really are now. We’re isolated from one another. It doesn’t have that sense of community that you can get from other places online. We’re just hoping to keep people’s spirits up as we go forward into the unknown.\n\nRyan: That’s a good point. Used bins are the home of the “five-dollar record,” although I’m unsure what people are selling them for now. You’re not going to sell used copies of David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars or a Led Zeppelin record online. They’re so ubiquitous that it doesn’t make much sense. However, they’re perfect for a store.\n\nEric: Sure. People would walk in and buy’em. We’ve had people call up and ask, “Do you have this Allman Brothers record? You do. Great, I’ll pick it up.” They can buy it on eBay. They can buy it on Discogs. But because they live locally, they can stop by the shop, purchase it, and listen to it this afternoon. It still works. The store sold a lot of meat-and-potatoes rock ‘n’ roll records. We needed that balance between selling weird, underground rock records and classic rock albums.\n\nRyan: Byrds, Bread and Toto records all at the same place without the shipping price and wait.\n\nEric: It’s awesome. There is a little bit of that at the store. Speaking of which, if anyone out there is looking for a Sister Sledge record, we’ve got it! Call us up.\n\nRyan: Talking about the atomization associated with Facebook—I think of the site’s sort of opposites. Terminal Boredom’s message board was a great place for likeminded people to share ideas about music. The Goner message board, which has been revamped, was a predecessor of sorts to Terminal’s board.\n\nEric: Yeah. Even for me, it’s frustrating to use the Goner board. It’s such a dinosaur. It kept chugging along for years. We need to tweak it and make it more functional. It’s hard to envision people staying on it now like they used to. But it is there, and it was a big hub for people who were into underground stuff. Terminal Boredom was too. I always felt comfortable reading that stuff up until a point. The squabbles got to be a bit much and I’d lose track of what was going on. Anyway, check out the Goner board!\n\nRyan: For bedroom record labels like ours (Spacecase), you could sell 15 titles almost right away by going on those boards. And you didn’t need to pay a public relations company a couple grand to do it.\n\nEric: You were getting your records in front of the right people.\n\nEric Friedl photo by Mor Fleisher-Leach\n\nRyan: Beyond COVID-19 and the global economic meltdown, in our milieu we had Apollo Masters burn down a couple months ago. I use Musicol out in Columbus, Ohio, and I know they’re going to be closed for at least a few weeks. Did the Goner label have anything in the works that’s been put on hold?\n\nEric: The Bloodshot Bill record is done and is supposed to come out on April 10. We’ve got those shipping soon. We did the preorders on that album, so it is in motion—if you get what I mean. We had this Optic Sink record in the works. Optic Sink is Natalie (Hoffmann) from Nots and Ben Bauermeister from the Magic Kids. It’s really cool, electronic stuff. That’s at the digitally mastered stage. The Ar-Kaics record is up there. So is the new Quintron record. We have a choice of getting these lacquers cut and then wait to press. Or we can try to hang tight and wait. I think we’re going to have to wait to minimize expenses right now. They’re all there. I think once we get through this it’s going to be a clusterfuck of people trying to rush through records. But who really knows what’s going to happen? There are all these Record Store Day LPs that supposedly got pressed or are getting pressed.\n\nRyan: I read that Record Store Day’s date has been pushed back to June 20, 2020. That might be a little optimistic.\n\nEric: Yeah. It’ll be interesting. It’s another nail in the coffin for trying to sell records. We’re limping along. If we can get our weekend regulars in to pick up records, that’ll help. But this shutdown is going to put a lot of people—obviously, record stores included—out of business. Labels are going to be in trouble too. If you’ve got records scheduled for a Record Store Day release in mid-April, that’s done. That money isn’t coming back until Record Store Day finally happens. The market was already shrinking before all of this hit.\n\nRyan: You’re still getting new stuff in. Goner’s site is getting updated regularly. What new records have you been listening to?\n\nEric: We’re trying. It’s going to be hard justifying it going forward. We were really excited to get that Dadamah record (This is Not a Dream) in. I remember it coming out in the early 1990s. That kind of dreamy, New Zealand stuff is what we want to push. However, the hard part is that everyone into that subgenre already knows about it. It’s difficult to get new people into it. We did that Chubby and the Gang record (“All Along the Uxbridge Road” 7”). That was a street punk-type of chugger. We sold a bunch of records for them. Alec (McIntyre) and Cole (Wheeler) at the shop were really into it. So, we gave it a shot. That’s been interesting—getting into the American Oi!-type stuff. We were trying to put some more of that material out when everything ground to a halt. It’s not really my scene, but it’s been interesting weeding through all of this stuff and going, “Oh, yeah, this is pretty good.” Currently, I’ve been trying to find music for the kids at home that they’ll find palatable. They’re playing really crappy stuff. It’s a constant battle. They like songs from cartoons.\n\nRyan: I bought that recent Exek record (Some Beautiful Species Left) off the Goner site. It was great. It had a real Neu! and Tuxedomoon feel to it.\n\nEric: That’s a great record. I appreciate that.\n\nRyan: It’ll be difficult getting inventory. Just thinking about it now—Revolver (Distribution) is closed for at least another couple of weeks.\n\nEric: Yep. Because all of the distributors and stores are closing, it drives the people who want those records straight to the labels. It’s bad for the stores, good for the labels. We’re a store and a label, so we kind of benefit. But it takes away from having a centralized place to buy records. Which is fine, but it’s something else to worry about down the line.\n\nRyan: I always looked at our (Spacecase’s) relationship with Goner as symbiotic. I always knew you were going to buy our releases. The Goner store has enabled us to kick the can down the road for a couple extra years.\n\nEric: For sure.\n\nRyan: Any closing thoughts, Eric?\n\nEric: We’re just another small business caught up in total economic collapse. We’re lucky in the sense that we have a pretty loyal customer base. It’s awesome. But in the end we’re very vulnerable. We have to make tough decisions on how to move forward and keep it going. We’ve always had to do that. It’s just that right now it’s so dramatic. You screw up, you’re done. It’s really heavy. At the same time, we’re not going down without a fight. We’ll see what models develop. If we can get through this—if it’s not too long—we’ll make it. If not, everyone’s going to get wiped out. But we’ll see.\n\nWebsite: goner-records.com\n\nGonerfest photo courtesy of Eric Friedl\n\nConversations with The Baron, Part One: Memphis Engineers, Producers and Studios\n\nLeft to right: Ross Johnson and Jeffrey Evans\n\n\"I don't speak for my peers, but I certainly do like speaking about them.\" -Ross Johnson\n\nAs a Memphis-based rock journalist since the early '70s and a founding member of the Panther Burns, Ross Johnson is a walking encyclopedia of Memphis music. Forever self-deprecating--he falsely refers to himself as \"simply a footnote to the careers of Alex Chilton and Jim Dickinson\"--Johnson is a top-notch music writer and a linchpin of the original Memphis punk scene, playing in the short-lived Malverns and backing Alex Chilton on his seminal debut, Like Flies on Sherbert (Ross opens the record with \"Baron of Love, Part II\"). A Memphis music lifer, Ross has played on-and-off with a slew of influential musicians--including the Panther Burns for more than three decades--but these days shares most of his stage time with the great Jeffrey Evans. This interview with The Baron focuses largely on Memphis recording studios and two of Johnson's idols--the legendary Roland Janes and Jim Dickinson.\n\nInterview by Ryan Leach\n\nPhoto by BullyRook\n\nRyan: Did you ever meet Sam Phillips?\n\nRoss: No. Although there was the proximity of Memphis, I never did meet him. I did get to hang out in his office during the Cramps' recording session (at Phillips Recording) in the summer of '79. A friend of mine went upstairs to where Sam's office was and we sat behind his desk. We just looked at all the stuff on hiswalls, drank beer and thought we were Sam C. Phillips. Sam was definitely a great producer. I think he relied on Jack Clement and Stan Kessler as engineers a lot, but Sam knew the sound he wanted. There's not much more I can say about Sam C. Phillips.\n\nRyan: Was Knox Phillips around Phillips Recording in the late '70s?\n\nRoss: Knox was at Phillips a lot. He was always really nice to us. Knox would let Eric Hill borrow the Korg mini synth that the Panther Burns used. The Panther Burns didn't own a synth. Alex would go by Phillips and Knox would say, \"Sure, Alex (Chilton), take whatever you need. Just get the equipment back to us when you can.\" Of course we'd spill beer in the Korg and knock it around. Knox never said a word. He'd always let us borrow it. For the first couple of years, I'd say that little Korg synth was the defining sonic element of the Burns' sound. We also used that Korg on Like Flies on Sherbert. (Jim) Dickinson plays it.\n\nRyan: Was stopping by Phillips Recording a regular occurrence in the late '70s?\n\nRoss: Yeah. It was very much a walk-in place. In the late '70s, people would get really tweaked out and do sessions there. They were recording drums—just drums—and then overdubbing cymbals. They wanted that sonic clarity. That was so emblematic of Memphis sound engineers at that time—everything had to be isolated and close mic'ed; drums were taped and damped down. I cut several Panther Burns records at Phillips. I played in this plywood drum booth. I went there a couple of years ago and the booth is still there. Being in it recently made me feel claustrophobic and it was difficult to play in. But Roland Janes was producing so I didn't say anything. I wouldn't complain with Roland around.\n\nRyan: There's a great photo of Alex (Chilton) at the old Sun building on Union from the late '70s (see A Man Called Destruction: The Life and Music of Alex Chilton). Did you ever break into the old Sun building when it was abandoned?\n\nRoss: I think they did that during one of the Barbarian sessions. I believe it was the \"Rumble\" one.\n\nRyan: The Dickinson single?\n\nRoss: Yeah. That was like '75. At that point I think the old Sun Studios was a body shop. I know Lesa (Aldridge) was there that night. I think they might have recorded some ambient sounds there.\n\nRyan: Didn't the Panther Burns cut Sugar Ditch Revisited (1985) at Phillips?\n\nRoss: (laugh) Oh yeah! There was some guy in town—I can't recall his name—who gave us seven hundred fifty dollars out of the goodness of his heart to start recording at Phillips. We recorded in sort of the B studio of Phillips. The room was semi-abandoned, very small, and located in the back of the building. Roland was the engineer on it. Patrick Mathe—our beloved Parisian benefactor—then offered us some sort of deal (on New Rose Records). That revived us. The Panther Burns didn't even have a booking agent then. Mathe taking an interest in the Panther Burns extended the life of the band by another thirty years. I learned a lot about playing in the studio on Sugar Ditch Revisited. There's a big difference between playing live and in a studio—and it was Jim Dickinson (Sugar Ditch's producer) and Roland Janes who really made me aware of that. I was pretty clueless about music. Roland would say something like, \"Ross, play the ride cymbal on the chorus.\" And I'd say, \"What? Where's the chorus?\"\n\nRyan: A lot of people remain unaware of Roland Janes' (1933-2013) illustrious career as a session guitarist and engineer. Can you talk about Roland?\n\nRoss: Roland first came to prominence as Jerry Lee Lewis' guitar player. Roland plays on almost all of the Sun cuts Jerry did. Roland really defined rockabilly guitar playing. There were a few other guitarists who did as well—certainly Cliff Gallup—but when I interviewed Roland with Rob Bowman, he said he idolized Les Paul. Roland said, \"There was no such thing as rockabilly when we started out. We just thought of it as music. And I was just trying to sound like my idol, Les Paul.\" Roland went out on the road with Jerry Lee Lewis and with Billy Lee Riley and the Little Green Men. Roland got tired of the road and ended up opening up his own studio, Sonic Studio on Madison Avenue.\n\nThere was a local television music program called Talent Party (1964-1973). George Klein—Elvis' gofer and also a really good DJ at WHBQ—hosted Talent Party. The show featured local bands. A lot of these local bands didn't have a record out, so they were sent to Sonic Studio where Roland would cut them. The kids in these bands were generally between the ages of thirteen and seventeen. Some of them could not play. Roland told me he came up with something called \"defensive mixing.\" Roland said, \"Well, Ross, I would push up the most competent player and pull down the ones who couldn't play.\" Those recordings Roland cut (for Talent Party) meant so much to me. I'd watch the show every Saturday afternoon. All of these great teen bands would play. The last time I was in the studio with Roland, just before he died, I asked him if he knew what happened to those Talent Party tapes. He said, \"I do. We'd wipe all the tracks and use the same tape over and over again.\" I had hopes of finding a label to put out all those songs he recorded but they were long gone. Because of Talent Party, a lot of garage bands that did cut records went to Sonic Studio. Roland could successfully record these garage bands. For me, Roland helped define Memphis garage rock. I don't think there would have been a Memphis garage-rock sound had it not been for Roland Janes and the late John Fry.\n\nRoland came back to Phillips in '82 and started engineering there. That's where we met him. For me, Roland was just a great teacher. I can recall during a Panther Burns session our bassist Rene Coman—who also backed Alex (Chilton) and played in the Iguanas—asked Roland a question about mic placement on an amp. Roland got out a piece of paper and started drawing different diagrams, saying, \"Well, if you want this sound, you place the mic here. If you're looking for this sound, place it here.\" It took Roland all of about two minutes to break it down and it was an invaluable lesson in mic placement. Roland was a fount of knowledge. He was very patient but if you got him angry, watch out. The only time I ever saw Roland really mad was when Rob Bowman and I interviewed him. We talked with him, going up to the mid '70s when Roland had stopped playing live, and Bowman said something like, \"Well, I guess that about covers it.\" And Roland yelled, \"What do you mean that about covers it? I ain't dead yet!\" Boy, was that a lesson in interviewing a legend. That interview, which I no longer have, ended up being used in the Sun Rock Box compilation.\n\nRyan: I doubt those Memphis garage-rock bands could have recorded in many other local studios; they would have been turned away. In It Came From Memphis (by Robert Gordon) Roland states the session fee at Sonic Studio was thirteen dollars an hour. Talk about a deal.\n\nRoss: Oh yeah. While there would have been a live teen scene in Memphis in the mid '60s, much of it would have gone unrecorded without Roland. Any rare garage-rock 45 from that period was likely cut by Roland at Sonic Studio.\n\nRyan: Did Roland ever talk with you about the short-lived labels he started—Rita and Rolando?\n\nRoss: Yes, but I can't recall all of the stories. When Harold Dorman scored a hit with \"Mountain of Love\" (on Rita Records), there were some monetary disagreements. I don't think Roland got his fair share. About thirty years ago, The Panther Burns were doing a session with Roland. He told me, \"Ross, if I could get some collector to take all of those records out of my attic for a thousand bucks, he could have them all.\" Roland really didn't care too much about that sort of stuff. I found out later that Roland had two houses—one for all his records and recording equipment, the other for him to live in.\n\nAs I said earlier, I got to record with Roland a few times before he passed away. Roland wasn't the kind of producer who'd say, \"You're doing it wrong.\" But he would say, \"I think you're a little out of tune.\" One thing I loved about Roland—and he did this up until a few years ago—was he would have you go over a song four of five times. Then he'd say, \"Now I think you're ready to cut it.\" That's just such an old school approach to producing. It was such a beautiful thing to hear someone say, \"I think you're ready to cut it.\" Roland would go for the take. Like Sam Phillips, everything didn't have to be perfect but Roland knew the best take. Always. I can't say enough good things about Roland. He was a sweet man and I miss him.\n\nRyan: Roland seemed like the consummate professional. There's a Roland Janes Vinyl District article you wrote that touches on the Panther Burns' recording session for The World We Knew (1987). Alex was supposed to produce it but he ended up passing out under the mixing console. Roland went from engineering to engineering and producing part of the record.\n\nRoss: (laughs) Yeah! Alex was curled up in a ball under the console with a bag of Hawaiian weed and his shoes off. Roland just did his job. There are a lot of funny stories about Roland. I am glad he did get some attention before he died because he certainly deserved it.\n\nRyan: When did you meet Jim Dickinson?\n\nRoss: In the summer of '72 I was nineteen years old and packing groceries at—I kid you not—a Big Star grocery store. Not the one on National where Ardent was first located, but the one at Poplar and Perkins in East Memphis. On Friday nights, Jim would come in and do his shopping. I knew who he was. I was really excited to meet him. One day I got the nerve up while taking his groceries out to say, \"Hey, you're Jim Dickinson and you played piano on the Flamin' Groovies record Teenage Head.\" And he said, \"Yeah!\" Jim thought I was going to say \"Wild Horses.\" He said, \"That was an awesome gig! I got seven hundred bucks and a plane ticket to do one night's work.\" I think we hit it off then. I'll also say this about Jim: he was one of the few people who'd tip me. All of the other moneyed East Memphis people would just say, \"Oh, thanks for taking my groceries out.\" But Jim tipped and so did (Booker T and the MG's drummer) Al Jackson, Jr. So I was always glad to see Jim and Al, especially for financial reasons.\n\nRyan: When did you really get to know Jim?\n\nRoss: I really got to know Jim through Alex. Alex being the portal through which I entered life, so to speak. At least musical life. I got to know Jim well around mid '76. He was a big part of the early Panther Burns. I view Jim as a fifth member of the Panther Burns. I don't think the band would have existed without Jim's influence and encouragement. I learned a lot from Jim. He was always aware of what was going on with a band and the other people in the room during a recording session. He might let things get a little wild but if he felt someone was too drunk or too high or if a musician was getting picked on unfairly, he'd put a stop to it. I can recall once I was having this difficult session at Phillips with The Panther Burns. Alex and Tav were running things. I couldn't take it so I just went outside. Jim followed me out and said, \"Ross, you have as much right to be in that room as they do. Just calm down and come back in and cut the track.\" I wouldn't say Jim was a father figure, but he had those qualities. He looked out for people and encouraged them.\n\nThe Panther Burns were recording Shake Rag (1986). Alex and Rene were out on tour, so it was just Jim, Tav and me recording. Tav was doing a version of \"Warrior Sam\"—the rockabilly song by Don Willis—and Tav would lose the rhythm every time at this one point. We had done twenty-six takes. Finally I got so mad I just left the studio and got a Diet Coke. Jim came out and said, \"Ross, I think the next take will be the one.\" And sure enough, we got it on the twenty-seventh take! Imagine doing twenty-seven takes with me and Tav. Jim was a very patient man.\n\nRyan: What sticks out about Jim (Dickinson) was just how copasetic he was with the Midtown Memphis scene. Take those Barbarian Sessions. I doubt many producers would want to participate in those.\n\nRoss: I know. I went to a couple of those Barbarian Sessions and I could barely handle them. Once I dropped Alex off at dawn at Ardent for a Barbarian Session. Jerry Lawler, the wrestler and entertainer, was there and so were some of the Klitz. I told Alex, \"No, I can't do this.\" Dawn was my cut off time unless Bill Eggleston was there. If Bill was there, I'd stay as long as he would.\n\nRyan: Being good friends with Jim, he must have told you stories about his early days with the Dixie Flyers.\n\nRoss: Oh, yeah. Jim had so many great stories. He'd tell me them over and over again which was great because I liked hearing them over and over again. He told me this one story where the Dixie Flyers were backing up Aretha Franklin at a recording session. She was drinking these big Orange Julius drinks mixed with vodka and just crying. She was having trouble with this guy she was with. But the band worked around it. When she'd have it together they'd do the take. Jim also told me great stories about recording and drinking with Jesse Ed Davis, the Native American guitar player from Oklahoma. I loved Jesse Ed's playing.\n\nRyan: Were those Jesse Ed Davis stories from the sessions Dickinson cut with Ry Cooder?\n\nRoss: Yeah. You could ask Jim about just about anyone and he'd have a great story.\n\nRyan: Did Jim ever talk about (fellow Dixie Flyer) Charlie Freeman?\n\nRoss: I know Jim did do a couple of interviews where he spoke about Charlie. I don't recall too many of Jim's stories about Charlie but I do recall Jim referencing his playing: \"If Charlie were here, he would have played that part this way.\"\n\nIn '69 and '70, there was a little underground newspaper in Memphis called the Dixie Flyer. They did this interview with Jim and he gave them this great quote: \"If someone shook Steve Cropper up in the middle of the night and asked, 'Who are you trying to sound like?' he certainly would have said, 'Lowman Pauling.'\" (laughs) That was perfect because Cropper did sound like the great Lowman Pauling. Jim would talk about the STAX guys a lot but as far as I know Jim never cut at STAX. Jim did cut with Chips (Moman). Chips cut as many hits as STAX did. Plus Chips worked with one of my favorite guitar players and singers, Bobby Womack. I love Bobby Womack.\n\nRyan: When Bobby Womack went to American he was still persona non grata. There was still a lot of fallout over his marriage to Sam Cooke's widow.\n\nRoss: Oh, yeah. Bobby sort of started over in Memphis.\n\nRyan: Alex cut all those great Box Tops records at American with Reggie Young and Tommy Cogbill.\n\nRoss: And Dan Penn. Alex had great Dan Penn stories.\n\nRyan: There's a great interview online where Jim talks about his transformation as a producer. He used to buy into the idea that a producer should be loud and crazy like Phil Spector. But later on he realized that the opposite approach of less is more could be more effective.\n\nRoss: Jim produced by telling stories. I loved that about him. I think it got to Alex eventually. Jim would tell stories and have a good time in the studio. When he felt everyone was ready to cut, he'd start recording. Again, Jim had patience. I saw Jim produce a lot of sessions. I never once saw him lose his cool. He'd deal with people in extreme emotional states—believe me, I saw it—but Jim always held it together.\n\nRyan: Jim Dickinson's progressive taste in music always impressed me. Here was a guy who cut records for Atlantic and backed up some of their biggest acts, yet Jim fully embraced punk rock.\n\nRoss: Jim liked punk rock. When Cody and Luther (Dickinson) were teens he'd walk by their room and hear some SST record playing. He'd say, \"Now that song I really like. Who's that?\" I think Jim was really encouraged by the Cramps. Jim was around during their first session here in Memphis in October of '77 and he was so excited by them. He actually recorded them at a lock-in at Phillips one night. They recorded \"Red Headed Woman\" which I believe eventually came out on a 7\". The Cramps were just a perfect group. The lineup they had from approximately '77 to '80 was the best band around. The only possible exception being the Gun Club. I thought Jeffrey Lee Pierce was great.\n\nRyan: I know you're a huge fan of John Fry's engineering.\n\nRoss: I am. I didn't meet John Fry until I met Alex. I was always in Alex's company so I quickly became known as another one of his drunken friends. John spoke in the cadence of Jimmy Stewart. Alex used to always say, \"John sounds just like Jimmy Stewart.\" And John really did. John sounded like a Southern Jimmy Stewart. But John Fry was very much a Southern Gentleman. He signified the best aspects of being a moneyed individual from East Memphis. He was very circumspect in speech and personal habits. Then again he did not take a career path his parents had hoped he would. He got involved in Ardent which was really an act of rebellion on his part. His parents would have preferred him to follow a more legitimate career. John Fry was an excellent engineer. I heard this mix he did on Radio City. There are supposedly only two or three acetates in existence. I don't have a copy of it but it sounded so different from the record that was released. The mix that released sounded great to my ears but John's was excellent. John also kept the Memphis music biz going after Union Planters Bank pulled their line of credit from STAX in '75, forcing them to go under. John Fry was just an interesting man. In the summer of 2009 John Fry, Jody Stephens, my friend Bob Mehr from the Commercial Appeal and I went to visit Mary Lindsay Dickinson after Jim died. We wanted to say something. That was a very strange set of people to go. I always felt nervous around John. I wasn't exactly the type of person he'd want to be associated with. But it was a very sweet visit we had with Mary Lindsay. Very heartfelt. I think it was a great loss that John stopped engineering to focus more on the business side of Ardent. The Big Star Third sessions were definitely ruckus-filled and I don't think he knew what to make of them. But even in the summers of '76 and '77, Alex still had the key to Ardent. We'd go in after a night of drinking and hang out; maybe Alex would cut something. John never said, \"Alex, you can't come in here!\" They always had a friendship. John was very indulgent in his own way and he lived a very private life. John Fry was a very decent person.\n\nJeremy Scott of Reigning Sound and Toy Trucks Interview\n\nJeremy Scott, former bassist extraordinaire for the Reigning Sound, talks about his early days in New Jersey and laying down the low end for the original incarnation of the Reigning Sound. Jeremy still lives in Memphis and currently plays in Toy Trucks.\n\nInterview by Ryan Leach\n\nRyan: You're from New Jersey, correct?\n\nJeremy: Yes. My parents were born in Philadelphia. South Jersey is where most of my family is from; a number of them still live there. I moved around a lot when I was young. I even spent a couple of years in Memphis when I was two or three—sometime around '73-74. My folks and I moved to New Jersey in 1975 where I grew up. I lived there until I moved to Memphis in the summer of '99.\n\nRyan: Were you playing music in New Jersey?\n\nJeremy: I was in several bands (in New Jersey). I had started taking guitar lessons (after clarinet and sax) when I was thirteen. I was a late bloomer in that I didn't play in a band until I was in college. I was in a three-piece band called Sponge; this was before the alt-rock band of the same name hit it big. We were punk, sort of pop-punk. This was in 1991 before pop-punk became synonymous with Blink 182 and other crimes against nature. My band mates were into Gorilla Biscuits, Descendents, Shudder To Think, things like that.\n\nRyan: None of the New Jersey bands you were in formally released a record?\n\nJeremy: No. It was like a curse. We'd record, self-release a cassette or a disc and then someone in the band would move away or there'd be a falling out.\n\nRyan: What brought you to Memphis?\n\nJeremy: I met someone at SXSW in '98. We were part of the same internet chat group, oddly. This was back in the early days of the internet and before SXSW blew up to its current state. She lived in Memphis. The relationship ended up imploding, but I had a job lined up in Memphis so I went anyway. I wanted out of the Northeast. I was sort of lost for a second in Memphis, with the relationship over and the job I lined up being pretty bad.\n\nThis is quaint: since the internet was still relatively new, I actually put an advert in the local weekly, The Memphis Flyer, trying to find people to play with. I got a bunch of bad calls. Only two ended up being somewhat interesting. One of them was from Greg Roberson. He wanted to write songs with someone. He didn't tell me at the time that he was writing songs with (Greg) Cartwright. Three weeks later, he told me that he was working with Greg and asked me if I wanted to play bass with them. I hadn't played bass in forever and I didn't even own one at the time. We got together one night and it was fun. It sort of went from there.\n\nRyan: Were you familiar with Greg Cartwright's previous bands? Were you into Crypt Records?\n\nJeremy: I did know The Oblivians and The Compulsive Gamblers by that point. I wasn't so familiar with the Crypt stable. I listened to a lot of older (Nuggets era) garage rock when I was young though so I was able to grasp that stuff.\n\nRyan: Although your first year in Memphis (1999) was inauspicious, it was a great time for underground music in Memphis.\n\nJeremy: Well, it was an interesting time, kind of transitional—both for local music and for Greg (Cartwright). As far as Greg was concerned, The Oblivians were over. He'd returned to doing the Compulsive Gamblers. I think the Gamblers, Mach II, was a crucial development for Greg. Side two of Bluff City (1999) was kind of a blueprint for The Reigning Sound. There are the ballads on one side, the rockers on the other. Shades of what we’d do later on the vinyl version of Time Bomb High School.\n\nRyan: What were the early days of The Reigning Sound like?\n\nJeremy: We probably weren't very good at first. It took several months to really get it together. Roberson hadn't played drums in a while and Cartwright had new songs he was working on, kind of outside the mold of what he had been doing. Alex (Greene) wasn't with us from the beginning, so we played several gigs without him. We practiced a lot in Melissa Dunn's basement—Melissa being Duck Dunn's niece. It was kind of intimidating as a bassist in a way. I would say we practiced a lot more at the beginning than a lot of local bands did—remember, we’re talking Memphis here, where on-stage rehearsal had been elevated to an art form. Early on I remember practicing two or three times a week, two or more hours a shot. We were working intensively. Apparently there was time for everybody to do this; speaking for myself, I was single then. (Sorry, Pam.)\n\nRyan: Gene Clark was a big influence on the early Reigning Sound. There's the Clark cover on the debut single (\"Here Without You\"). You mentioned Roadmaster being a staple in the van while on tour.\n\nJeremy: Oh, yeah. Roadmaster was always in the van with us. Sir Doug also. I kind of wish we had chosen another Gene song. It's not that there's necessarily an obvious Gene Clark song—most people don't know who he is—but that song was already covered on Mavericks, the Holsapple and Stamey (ex-Db’s) record. But that's the one Greg wanted to do. That track came out of the same recording session for Break Up, Break Down.\n\nRyan: You recorded Break Up, Break Down (2001) at Easley McCain, correct?\n\nJeremy: Yeah. The whole thing seemed to happen quickly once we got rolling. The first weekend in August 2000, we played our first show with Alex (Greene). Within the next week we're in the studio. Alex hadn't spent a lot of time with those songs when we went in. That might have been part of Greg's design—not getting too familiar with the material. For instance, there were always one or two songs on every record we cut that we learned in the studio. I'm fairly certain we learned \"You Don't Hear The Music\" in the studio. It was a great experience, cutting Break Up, Break Down. We were working with Stuart Sikes who would eventually work on White Blood Cells a few months later. It was wild—how that record blew up. Anyway, Stuart and Alex were crucial to the sound of Break Up, Break Down.\n\nRyan: Sympathy wasn't known for tour support. What were you doing to promote Break Up, Break Down?\n\nJeremy: Oh, no—money wasn't coming from Long Gone John. We recorded Break Up, Break Down in August of 2000, but it didn't come out until May of 2001. In the meantime we'd gotten a lot tighter, playing locally on a regular basis. We did do a two-week tour right after the record came out; we played about twelve shows. We did have this guy who booked the tour, Scott Winland. He put a rider out to all the clubs. It was nothing out of the ordinary: hook them up with beer and food or give them a buyout. One of the shows—I believe it was the fourth show of the tour—was in Columbus, Ohio. We had played the previous night in Detroit. It was the White Blood Cells CD release party. The White Stripes had shows booked on Thursday, Friday and Saturday night of that week in Detroit, in three different venues and with different opening acts each night. We opened one of those shows in Detroit—it was a great night, I met both Jim Shaw and Mick Collins also—and then we drove to Columbus to play a place called Bernie's Distillery. It was a pretty rancid place. They did have a kitchen but it had just closed, but we didn’t know this on arrival. When we asked what they had to eat, the guy there told us to hold on; he'd check the fridge. He came back and said, \"Okay, there's a thing of ham in the fridge. The top is green, but I can shave off some of the bottom for you.\" We told him, \"No, we'll get some pizza!\" One night you're playing with the White Stripes, the next you’re contending with rancid ham. And then there was the bathroom, which was horrific. Put it this way—you’ve heard about the infamous bathroom at CBGBs? I’d found myself in the CBGBs bathroom a few times and it was never like the one at Bernie’s. Maybe in the '70s it was but it’s hard to imagine. Scarring.\n\nRyan: You signed to In The Red for Time Bomb High School (2002).\n\nJeremy: Time Bomb High School was mostly recorded over two different sessions, so it took somewhat longer than Break Up, Break Down, which was recorded over one four day period. We recorded some tracks for Time Bomb High School and then resumed recording for the album a few months later. We had sent the record to Larry (Hardy) and he wanted a couple of extra tracks; it was a short record so we wound up adding on another four songs. I remember Greg showing us \"Straight Shooter\" and “She’s Bored With You” in the studio. Recording that record felt more like what we were doing live, and obviously Alex was more integrated in the band by then. Lori—better known as Lorette Velvette—Alex's wife was pregnant at the time and due very soon, so Alex was there for the sessions intermittently. Alex was there for most of the basic tracking, but there were a few songs where we did the basic tracks as a trio and Alex overdubbed his part later. As a performance, I’m pretty proud of \"Brown Paper Sack\" which was a first take with no overdubs, everybody present. It’s not one of Greg’s songs—The Gentrys did the original—but that track is a good example of what we were about at the time.\n\nRyan: Was Time Bomb High School recorded on analog tape?\n\nJeremy: Yeah, Doug didn't use Pro Tools for a while. A few years later, I did a record with Harlan T. Bobo. This was after Easley McCain got hit by the fire, so we were in another studio. Doug was learning Pro Tools at that point, I believe (2005 or 2006).\n\nRyan: Time Bomb High Schoolwas the record that really got me interested in The Reigning Sound. I was twenty when it came out and it had enough rockers on there for me. That's what I wanted at the time.\n\nJeremy: Seemingly we had this rule: if we weren't pissing someone off with each successive record, we were doing something wrong. With Break Up, Break Down I think there were a lot of people who were thrown off due to the laid-back nature of the record, but some did wind up coming around. During that first Reigning Sound tour for Break Up we played Richmond, Virginia. There were a bunch of people there to see Greg. They knew about The Oblivians but not so much about the new band. Understandably, they wanted Oblivians-type stuff. They were feeding us shots and beer in anticipation of the high-octane rock show they thought was in store. I was getting drunk and I remember thinking, \"I'm not sure how this show is going to go.\" The band that opened the show was good, but it was sort of a hardcore thing; their average song went at a faster speed than our fastest. We went on and about four songs in we played \"Since When.\" This dude, in the center of the crowd, stood straight up, fist pumped and yelled, \"Holy shit!\" No irony employed whatsoever. The show wound up being one of the best—a two-and-a-half hour war of attrition and as we got drunker, the more revved up we got.\n\nI get a lot of feedback from musicians about Break Up being their favorite. With Time Bomb, some people missed the sound of the first record, as we went in more of an up tempo direction. With Too Much Guitar—good lord. That was the “ugly rock” record.\n\nRyan: You guys were getting some real press around the time of Time Bomb High School. You mention in another interview that Steven Van Zandt was playing your records on his show. There was the tour with The Hives and I think Cartwright might have made Rolling Stone or Spin. I recall a picture of him with Howlin' Pelle in a mainstream publication. Pretty mind blowing.\n\nJeremy: That was helpful to a point because at some level people have to be told what to like, even intelligent people who think they are making their own decisions. Maybe “guided” is a better word. This is where publications like Rolling Stone come in and now in the days of online media, sites like Pitchfork. As far as the Rolling Stone bit, The Strokes were a \"thing\" and The Hives were becoming \"a thing.\" We were sort of affiliated with The Hives in a way but coming from a somewhat different place musically. And we were older than them. That's a reason why we never bullshitted ourselves into thinking The Reigning Sound was going to be a big thing. It’s harder to sell older guys who aren’t exactly male model material. But it was pretty amazing, being around The Hives in 2002. That's the closest I'll ever get to being around The Beatles, circa A Hard Day's Night. It sounds dramatic but the atmosphere around the Hives was insane at that point.\n\nRyan: They reached casual music fans with decent music. That's saying something in this day in age of no free format or regional radio stations.\n\nJeremy: Oh, yeah, those days are over. (Free format and regional radio, not decent music!) I'll say this: The Hives put on a great live show. I guess I saw it thirty times. They were pros and delivered every night. You can say what you want about them but the Hives were a great rock 'n' roll band. As people, they were pretty egoless and just nice.\n\nRyan: Did The Reigning Sound first go to Europe after Time Bomb High School?\n\nJeremy: Yeah, after some more touring domestically. We did part of the big Hives tour in 2002. They were big Oblivians/Cartwright fans and wanted us to join them for their entire tour but we all had jobs which precluded this. We only did the West Coast shows, maybe six or seven gigs. We hit the Rust Belt frequently: Cleveland, Chicago, Columbus, Detroit. We did another longer tour toward the end of 2002. Half of those shows were with Dead Moon. Christ, what a band. That was educational. We did wind up going to Sweden and Norway in spring '03. That was a great trip.\n\nRyan: My favorite Reigning Sound record is Too Much Guitar.\n\nJeremy: Mine too.\n\nRyan: Alicja and Jay recorded you guys with a digital 24-track. I think she got that from Larry (Hardy) so that the Lost Sounds could record Future Touch on it.\n\nJeremy: That sounds right.\n\nRyan: She told me that Too Much Guitar has such a hot mix because she and Jay didn't know how to use the digital 24-track properly at that point.\n\nJeremy: Yeah! (laughs) I don’t doubt that’s a significant factor. I think they got it the week before we started recording. We had done a whole record before that; I remember hearing it mixed and sequenced. Some of those tracks were released on the Home for Orphans record. Alex (Greene) told us he was leaving the band just after we finished listening to the “original” third album. Consequently, Greg was thinking for a minute about dissolving the band. Then again, Greg said he was thinking about breaking up the band about four times when I was in it, but this was probably the closest it came to actually happening. We had been trying to decide whether to pursue Reigning Sound full time or not. Alex had one baby at home and another on the way, so I could understand his hesitation. Anyway, we did a few shows as a trio, rearranged many of the tunes we had been doing, and decided it was still viable. That’s when Greg reached out to Jay and Alicja.\n\nRyan: Did you guys record Too Much Guitar completely at Legba? Or was part of it done at Easley McCain as well?\n\nJeremy: It was done almost evenly between the two places. Alex is on half the record, the earlier material done at Easley. I think the album properly credit Alex. \"We Repel\" was recorded at Legba. The version of \"I'll Cry\" on Too Much Guitar was recorded at Legba. \"Drowning\" was done at Easley. It was a little less revved up than the Legba version. \"Medication\" was an outtake from the Time Bomb High School sessions at Easley. The Easley tracks were remixed in such a way as to sound similar to the Legba stuff.\n\nRyan: Your bass playing really stands out on Too Much Guitar. Once your ears adjust to just how loud the record is—and filters through the guitars and cymbals—your bass playing really holds that album together.\n\nJeremy: It's nice of you to say that. I think there was more room for me now that the band was a trio. Too Much Guitar was about attacking the listener. The guitars are brittle. Roberson was doing his stomp thing. I mean that in the best possible way. Roberson's a totally solid drummer and his playing allowed me to move around a bit.\n\nRyan: Did Jay and Alicja record half the record and then later on master all of the tracks?\n\nJeremy: They did all of the stuff at Legba. Alicja was there a lot more than Jay. Jay had some place to be. I believe he had a sound gig. Alicja and Jay set everything up together, fought a little bit, and then Jay split. Alicja supervised all of the overdubs. Those two are responsible for the sound on that record. I dig what they did with it.\n\nRyan: You mentioned confounding people earlier. Too Much Guitar is not for the faint of heart. But if you have the good sense to listen to it—I think the record's already a classic.\n\nJeremy: It's hard for me to judge that kind of stuff! It does grab you and that's what a rock record should do. Although Cartwright, Roberson and I were together as a three-piece for less than a year, there was a different vibe to that band. It was more aggressive. We did a tour right after finishing the record. I mean from the first show it was completely fucking on. It was a great trip despite the three of us getting sick at one point or another during the course of the tour. In fact, I would like to formally apologize to the fine city of Buffalo, eleven years after the fact, for the show we gave you that night. I think all of us were pretty under the weather at that point.\n\nRyan: It wasn't too long afterwards that Roberson left and you got Lance Wille in.\n\nJeremy: Lance joined in the spring of 2004. Going back a few months, Cartwright mentioned to me and Greg that he wanted to fold the band in December ’03. I was upset in that I thought Too Much Guitar, which was still a few months away from coming out, was the best thing we'd done and now it looked like it was all going to be over. Greg (Cartwright) was also planning to move to Asheville, North Carolina, which I don’t believe Roberson or I knew when Greg sat down with us. Anyway, Cartwright moved around the end of 2003—could have been early 2004—and things were quiet for a while. Then around April '04, I get a call from Cartwright. He told me, \"You know, we have an opportunity to play some shows in support of the album.\" We talked about a possible European tour, booked by this woman named Ankie who worked at the Paradiso in Amsterdam. Greg was like, \"Ankie is arranging for us to play a bunch of shows in Holland and Belgium. It won't be a long tour—maybe a week and a half.\" Also, the Hives wanted us to tour the US with them and the Sahara Hotnights, a three-week tour which would start maybe a week after we would get back from Holland. There was going to be some money for us as well. Cartwright asked if I was in and I said yeah; I figured I could somehow get the time I needed off from work. Then Greg said, \"Well, Roberson isn't going to be with us,\" which was a surprise. Greg told me of three potential drummers, but from the way he was describing Lance, I could tell that he was the one Cartwright really wanted. Looking back on it, on one level he needed me to say \"yes\" before he brought the drumming situation up. I’ve thought about that from time to time. I don't mean to overstate things, but it was a crucial moment because Reigning Sound was able to continue.\n\nRyan: It was a transitional period for him. I see your point.\n\nJeremy: I went to Asheville and practiced with Lance. We did a show there and then got on the plane to Amsterdam. Lance was a little nervous. Going from Greg Roberson to Lance was a big shift. Greg has a limited amount of colors in his drumming palette but what he does, he does very, very well. He plays with a certain amount of “authority.” Lance could do things Greg couldn't do, but he didn't have the authority of Roberson. Kind of a trade-off in a way, but I think you need a certain amount of authority on drums, especially in a three-piece rock band. That said, please don’t get me wrong—Lance is a great guy and I dug playing with him too.\n\nRyan: I've always felt the Too Much Guitar lineup was the definitive Reigning Sound lineup.\n\nJeremy: Well, again, Alex was on fifty-percent of that album. But I get what you’re saying—the sound of that record is definitely more aggressive. Truthfully, some of that might have been fueled by animosity by that point. We didn't always see eye to eye at that point, which is not unusual after a while. How long are bands supposed to be together anyway? Looking back, I would chalk some of it up to the forceful personalities involved. In other words, it wasn’t any one thing that created the tension.\n\nRyan: I know some stuff came out after the tour—including the Live at Maxwell's record with Lance. But with Cartwright in Asheville, that was pretty much it for you in the Reigning Sound, huh?\n\nJeremy: That show was recorded the night before the Hives tour. It was a one-off headlining gig, then the bus showed up the next morning to take us to the first Hives show in D.C. That Maxwell's show felt good at the time and the audience was fantastic, but Greg had broken about three strings toward the end of the set and the guitar is out of tune on the recording. There was a backup guitar about three feet behind Cartwright that he apparently couldn't be bothered with. I haven't listened to that recording in a long time, so I don’t know if this bit made it onto the album, but someone was actually gesturing toward Greg to use the backup, and Greg leaned into the mic and said, “I enjoy a challenge.” (Laughs.) We did a few other shows after the second Hives tour, including a wedding at CBGB's, interestingly enough. The last show I played with The Reigning Sound was on New Year's Eve 2004, at the Hi-Tone. Insane show. A great night and in retrospect a great way to go out, even if nobody realized that was going to be the case at the time.\n\nThis happened ten years ago, so maybe the statute of limitations has run out. We hadn't gotten together in early 2005. Cartwright gave me a call after some time had passed: \"I think it’s about time to kick it in the head. We’ve had a good run. We do have an opportunity to do a few more shows though.\" By this point I was back at my job full time, so I told Greg, \"That's cool, just let me know the dates.\" It was getting harder anyway, with Greg in Asheville and me in Memphis. Then maybe a week later someone on the Goner Board asked, \"Hey, what's up with The Reigning Sound? It's been a long time since you've gone on tour.\" Greg wrote back, \"Hey, man, we're playing these shows with Jeremy. They'll be his last shows with the band, then we’re going to do these other shows with Dave Gay, our new bass player.\" That's how I found out. I called Cartwright. \"I read something funny on the Goner Board.\" He said \"I can explain!\" Greg said he was thinking about going out under his own name. He talked with club promoters and they told him they'd be happy to book him, but by that point The Reigning Sound was more of a recognizable name. Also, he talked with some friends about whether he should continue using the name; they said yes. I mean, he was the front guy and songwriter. I might have done the same thing if I were in his place. I just wish he would have told me first. It's 2014 and it's all water under the bridge now. We're friends to this day, but at the time, it did bother me. I can't lie. It did make sense for Greg to go with Dave—he and Lance had played together in the Unholy Trio. In fact, when I first got together with Greg and Lance, Dave was living upstairs from where we were practicing. Greg needed someone local. I get it. But it was bizarre for a minute. In the meantime, I had already started playing with Harlan T. Bobo, which I wound up doing for awhile. Harlan became somewhat of a Memphis sensation, but that’s a story for another day. . .\n\nRob Bowman (Stax Historian) Interview, Part One\n\nRob Bowman is a Canadian rock journalist and professor of ethnomusicology at York University. He's the author of the incredible Soulsville U.S.A., an exhaustive history of STAX Records, which is the main topic of our conversation.\n\nInterview by Ryan Leach\n\nThis interview originally ran in Roctober magazine in 2011.\n\nRyan: It took you twelve years to complete Soulsville U.S.A. I can only imagine how tiresome the project must have gotten at certain points and how hard finding funding must have been. What inspired you to dedicate a big chunk of your life to Stax Records?\n\nRob: When I started Soulsville U.S.A., I didn’t know that it would take 12 years to finish it, but I never did get tired of writing the book. This was partially because I put together three massive box sets—two nine CD sets and one ten CD set—along the way. Those box sets were great for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it got a ton of music out there and increased people’s awareness of Stax. The first box set had 31,000 words for liner notes; the second one contained about 40,000 words; the last box set had 47,000 words. So each time I did one, it provided a forum for a whole lot of additional research that, fortunately, was paid for by Fantasy Records. So much of the book was paid for through the liner notes. Also, partnering up with the record company meant that I got access to all of the Stax archives. That was really important. The archives contained royalty statements, promotional materials, letters, and session sheets. The box sets allowed me to publish a lot of detailed stuff I had about the music; information about particular songs and lesser-known groups. This material might have bogged down a book.\n\nThe legal stuff was an issue. Did I really want to deal with it? People had warned me early on not to get involved with it, partially because of Johnny Baylor (head of KoKo Records and in charge of Stax Security. Baylor was a bona fide gangster who wasn’t afraid to use force if he felt it was necessary). He ended up dying early in my research which meant that he was no longer a threat. I decided that if I wanted to write Soulsville U.S.A. properly, I would have to dig into the legal stuff. That was an incredible amount of work. It was one 16-hour day of work after another, going through these legal documents and court records. It was incredibly boring, but then you’d hit upon some incredible piece of information that would make the whole process worthwhile. I could have written the book after four or five years and I think it would have been good. But I take things to the wall. I’m glad I waited. I think it’s about as comprehensive as it could be.\n\nRyan: You mentioned Johnny Baylor. Although I know he died relatively young from stomach cancer, I take it he hadn’t changed his ways much by the ‘80s.\n\nRob: He was a gangster till the end. I forget which year he died. But as long as he was alive it would have been difficult to probe into a few things without risking my safety.\n\nRyan: I’d like to go back a bit and talk with you about your initial encounters with Stax. You had traveled to Memphis to work on a PhD dissertation that revolved around the label, correct?\n\nRob: Yes. That was initially how I made it down to Memphis. Needless to say, I took it a lot further.\n\nRyan: A great point you make several times in Soulsville U.S.A. is that for a number of people, Stax Records was like a university or a trade school. Many people at Stax would go on to have rewarding careers as producers, engineers and publicists. A good deal received their respective starts at Stax with little or no previous experience. What struck me was how this openness to Memphians was extended to Stax’s musicians as well. Take Stax’s house band Booker T and the MG’s. Duck Dunn and Steve Cropper are pretty frank about their inability to read music and somewhat limited knowledge of music theory. A lot of the MG’s music was fairly simple but had a great groove. I couldn’t see Dunn or Cropper fitting in with the Funk Brothers in Detroit or the Wrecking Crew out in Los Angeles, two groups lined with studio musicians who read music fluently and were generally well-versed in music theory.\n\nRob: They probably wouldn’t have worked with either one of those groups.\n\nRyan: Yet the MG’s were able to develop their own musical identities and became excellent musicians at Stax. And the number of musicians the MG’s inspired is immeasurable. Stax really provided the opportunity for people to develop without many prejudices.\n\nRob: That’s 100 percent true. Stax provided many opportunities for people who would have never had similar opportunities elsewhere. Outside of the great music it produced, Stax was also a very special social institution in Memphis.\n\nRyan: Lewie Steinberg is a Stax figure we hear very little about. There’s almost no information available on the man anywhere. He played bass on the first two MG’s albums and on a lot of Stax sessions before Dunn joined the group. What can you tell me about Lewie?\n\nRob: I think I was the first person to interview Lewie. He played bass on most of the Stax stuff from 1962 to 1964. Lewie came from a large family of musicians. Most of his brothers played music professionally in Memphis. A lot of them played jazz. Lewie was a blues-based bass player. He didn’t have the same kind of melodic sense Duck had. If Lewie had stayed in the MG’s, they wouldn’t have sounded the way they did from ’65 on when Dunn joined the band. I can’t imagine Lewie playing things like “Time Is Tight” and “Hip Hug Her.” It wasn’t his style. You listen to the early stuff like “Green Onions” and “Jellybread,” and it’s all blues based. Nevertheless, Lewie was a very, very good blues bass player. There’s not a whole lot of information out there on Lewie because he had a drinking problem. That’s really why he got booted out of the MG’s. Had he not had the drinking problem, I don’t think Dunn would have made that switch from the Mar-Keys to the MG’s.\n\nRyan: That’s really interesting.\n\nRob: The sound of the MG’s would have been very different. It is quite interesting how these things hinge on certain events. Lewie’s drinking problem made him difficult to work with and he became unreliable to the point where the other guys decided they couldn’t deal with him. After the MG’s, Lewie didn’t have much of a career doing anything. When I met him (in the ‘80s), I think he was a painter or a bricklayer—some sort of building trade. That’s what he had been doing all those years. He more or less drank himself out of the music business which is a very sad story. When I met Lewie he still had a problem with drinking and he was also somewhat bitter. The MG’s and Stax became really big and few people cared about him or knew who he was. He wasn’t a reliable interview. He made up some stuff to make himself look bigger.\n\nI’m not sure if he did any other interviews after me. I got Lewie by luck. I ran into him at a bar with some people who could vouch for me and my work. Lewie didn’t want to do the interview but he finally agreed. I picked him up later and we just drove around in my car. He wanted to show me around. We parked outside the Stax building; he showed me where people got their hair cut. He wasn’t a deep kind of person so what he said wasn’t all that revelatory. I tried to give him his due as best I could. But basically there isn’t much more information on Lewie out there. He’s dead now by the way. He died sometime in the last ten years.\n\nRyan: I didn’t know that. I thought Lewie was still alive.\n\nRob: It was old age although alcoholism might have curtailed his life a little bit. I can’t remember the exact cause of his death.\n\nRyan: That’s too bad. I can tell by the body style of the bass he played that he purchased his Fender Precision sometime in the mid ‘50s or earlier. It had the Telecaster body shape and not the Stratocaster one that came out in ’57. Lewie was right on the cusp of that transformation from standup bass to electric bass. It’s a shame he hasn’t received recognition for being there at that transitional period. Most bassists at the time looked at the electric bass as a novelty instrument.\n\nRob: Absolutely. That makes total sense.\n\nRyan: You mentioned Lewie being hesitant to do the interview. That being said, when Stax went under, things got ugly. Although I imagine some interviews were easy to obtain, I’m sure others were incredibly hard to get.\n\nRob: It took me a year to get Isaac Hayes; six months to get Jim Stewart and Deanie Parker (Parker played a crucial role at Stax, working as director of publicity as well as an occasional singer, songwriter and jack of all trades). All of those people would have gotten rid of me if they could. I walked the fine line between being persistent without being obnoxious. At all points, I had to convey to them why I was writing about Stax and eventually they felt that my reasons were pure enough. Jim Stewart told me he never would have given me an interview had it not been used for my PhD. But once he met me, he began to trust me. He was then willing to do subsequent interviews. That first night we met, we spoke for seven hours. Again, I was only able to speak with him for seven hours because it was for my PhD. If I had been doing it for a book or an article, he would’ve turned me down. Since Stax folded, Jim has only been interviewed by me and Peter Guralnick.\n\nGetting people’s trust was crucial; getting Jim Stewart was crucial. When I approached people, I just said I wanted to talk about the music. They could tell I was there for the music and not the sensational shit that happened at the end, which was horrible. But as I got further and further along, people were actually interested in me trying to find out how things unraveled. They wanted that story told. That’s where getting into the archives and getting into the court stuff enabled me to draw a picture that no one had understood before then, including me. It took me years to understand what happened. A lot people think Stax going under was part of some conspiracy theory—that the United States, CBS and Union Planters worked together to put Stax—a black business—out of business. All of these groups did attack Stax for various reasons. But they did not work in conspiracy with each other. In fact, CBS and Union Planters were at war with one another over who got what was salvageable out of Stax. It took me a long time to understand the dynamics and the motivations behind these institutions in taking down Stax.\n\nRyan: I found the last chapters of Soulsville U.S.A., which dealt with Stax going under, to be fairly depressing. However, I admired your ability to decode the legal documents from this time period, which I’m sure employed obfuscating and specialized language. Were you able to get any outside help with this work?\n\nRob: I don’t mean this arrogantly, but I’m pretty intelligent and I do have a PhD. However, I’m not a lawyer. There was a judge in Memphis who used to be a lawyer. He briefly was involved with Stax and he felt that what had happened to the company was wrong. He wished to remain anonymous which is something I’ve always respected. He helped by donating his time; he set me up in an office with 24 hours access; he gave me unlimited photocopying and helped me out with any parts of the legal documents I found confusing. A few times I took him up on that last aspect, but most of it I could figure out on my own. I can read contracts…I just had to reread stuff a lot. I would work 16 hours a day going through these documents. I’d do this day after day. It was mind numbing, but I was determined.\n\nRyan: Jumping back to the origins of Stax, can you discuss how crucial the early successes of Carla Thomas and the Mar-Keys were to the survival of Stax?\n\nRob: Absolutely crucial. There were several points where the label nearly went under. That’s the nature of the record industry. You start out with money but have to put a lot of it into pressing records and then hopefully wait for the money to come in. Then there’s rent and payroll to worry about. Your lifeline doesn’t last long unless you have a medium or big hit. Estelle Axton had to mortgage her house twice to keep Stax going. If “Gee Whiz” and “Last Night” hadn’t hit, Stax likely would have petered out right at the beginning.\n\nRyan: It has been said before, but I’d like to mention it again here: Stax was one of the first record companies to embrace racial integration. I remember when I was 12 or 13 years old, my dad—who was a fan of music—told me that Booker T and the MG’s was one of the first groups to have both white and black members in it. I was too young to contextualize the importance of this then. My dad had been in the South in 1968; he spent a few days in Fort Polk, Louisiana on his way to Vietnam. He described it as shocking. He had never experienced such open segregation. This was 14 years after the Brown vs. Topeka Board of Education (1954) decision, which federally called for the end of state-sponsored segregation. I feel it’s worth reiterating this aspect of Stax.\n\nRob: It’s impossible to conceive what Stax did in terms of integration unless you’ve spent time in the South. Stax was in the heart of the Mid-South. When Stax began, Memphis was as racially segregated and polarized as a city could get. The city was 50 percent white and 50 percent black. But nothing was integrated except Stax. I call Stax an oasis of racial sanity in an otherwise insane world. A lot of the people who worked at Stax commented on how going to work was like going to church. You stepped into the Stax building and the world was somehow different. Black and white people were working together and becoming friends at Stax in a way that was totally organic. Stax was the organic manifestation of Dr. Martin Luther King’s dream, where black and white people came together through a common purpose. Working together toward a common goal—making music—black and white people realized that their differences were a matter of culture and not a matter of species. The latter thought lead to the racist attitudes that have dominated American social thought, especially in the South, for so long up until that point. You also have to remember that Dr. King was assassinated in Memphis in 1968. As late as 1971, the Memphis City Council decided to close public swimming pools rather than let black and white kids swim together. There was a federal order that banned segregated public facilities by that point. So in that 110 degree heat in summer black and white kids couldn’t swim together. That’s the racist insanity that Stax existed in. The label was color blind. The house band was integrated; the office staff was integrated and by 1968, the ownership of the company was integrated. Supposing the music Stax produced was terrible, it would still be an interesting and fascinating sociological story. Of course, the music Stax produced changed the world of music around the world. It’s an interesting and tremendous story in terms of musicology, sociology and black business.\n\nEric Oblivian Interview, Part Two\n\nRyan: Was The New Memphis Legs the next thing you did?\n\nEric: I think so. After The Oblivians I was just kind of hanging out. James (Arthur) moved to Memphis and I was determined not to be in a band with him. It seemed way too obvious. We would drink whiskey on a Saturday night and ride our BMX bikes to places with pinball machines. Eventually we decided to work up some songs. We already had a drummer. But then we realized Forrest (Hewes) from The Neckbones was in town. We ditched the first drummer because Forrest was around, but we were too chicken to tell him he was out of the band. We claimed that we had formed a new group. That’s why the band is called The New Memphis Legs (laughs). As soon as we got Forrest in, the band was amazing. The first drummer was good, but Forrest has amazing time. He can sing. His kick pedal was like a bass. James is a great guitarist. He was wild. The New Memphis Legs was a really fun band. We were listening to a bunch of Australian ‘60s stuff from the Ugly Things compilation. We covered some of those songs and made up a bunch of dumb originals.\n\nRyan: As far as I know, The New Memphis Legs only had one properly released song on a Shangri-La Records compilation. Goner is going to release a posthumous full-length LP, correct?\n\nEric: We are going to release a New Memphis Legs LP. A buddy of ours had an early recording program on his computer. He said he’d record us. We were into it, so we recorded some songs in his living room. At the time we weren’t into how the recordings turned out. But it’s another example where as time moves on you start picking out the good things you missed earlier when you were solely focusing on the aspects you didn’t like. Eventually James and I decided to put it out.\n\nRyan: Bad Times was another case of having the right people (Eric Oblivian, King Louie Bankston, Jay Reatard) at the right place, huh?\n\nEric: Yeah.I was just breaking up with this girl. I don’t remember what was going on with Jay, but Louie was getting divorced. Jay and I decided to go down to New Orleans and record a record with Louie. We drove down. Jay had his four-track. We spent a day recording. The next day we mixed the record. That was it. It was the same experience we had with The New Memphis Legs. We thought the recording was crappy. There was too much delay on the vocals. Later we changed our minds: “It sounds pretty good. Let’s put it out!” Recording the album was fun. I’ve told this story before, but when we got back to Memphis—it’s a six-and-a-half hour drive from New Orleans to Memphis—at three in the morning, Jay came home to find out that his mom had kicked him out of the house. All of his stuff was on the front lawn. I dropped Jay off with his buddy Sean. I asked Jay if he was okay. He said, “Yeah, I’m fine, man.” I said, “Okay. You can stay at my house.” I don’t know what he did that night. We were going through bad times. That band was aptly named (laughs)!\n\nI also played in the Dutch Masters. The band was me, Punk Rock Pat on drums, Scott Rogers on second guitar, and at various times Talbot Adams, Joe T and Robin Pack on bass. We put out a 7” on Goner. The highlight of the band was playing Horizontal Action Blackout Fest and getting asked by Fred Cole of Dead Moon to go on tour with them. Which, of course, never happened. That was a total bummer.\n\nRyan: When you opened up The Goner store with Zac (Ives) in 2004, you two took over the location Greg (Cartwright) previously occupied with Legba Records. I don’t know much about Legba. Was the shop open for long?\n\nEric: No. He only had it for a couple of years. Greg is a big record collector. Legba was doing pretty well even though it seemed like Greg wasn’t putting much effort into it. The inventory was mostly his collection. Of course, when you own a record store, records just seem to show up at your door whether you like it or not. We asked Greg what kind of money Legba was bringing in. We bought most of his stock when he moved out to Asheville. His wife got a job out there, so they were moving out of town. He told me and Zac, “I think you should take over this store front. I’m moving out of town. People know this location as a record store.” It just all fell into place. Goner is in a nice neighborhood. There are other shops around and places to eat.\n\nRyan: Things seem to develop around you. Gonerfest is another example.\n\nEric: That’s the worst example of that happening. I started Goner (the record label) in 1993. But before 2004, I hadn’t done too much with the label. I had gotten into a car wreck in the mid ‘90s. For years I didn’t know whether I was going to get sued or not. That’s why I didn’t keep putting out Guitar Wolf records. I didn’t know if I’d lose all of my money in a lawsuit. I would have released more Guitar Wolf records had the car accident not happened. The band asked me to. Looking back on it, I should have just gone for it. Guitar Wolf ended up releasing albums on Bag of Hammers and then Matador. I had put out a few records prior to opening the shop, but not many. Zac and I wanted to run the shop and get the label really going again. King Louie had his one-man band thing. We did the first King Khan and BBQ Show record. King Khan and BBQ had sent those songs out to a lot of people. Apparently no one listened to them. We loved them. We thought they were great. I knew The Spaceshits; they had done a show with The Oblivians. But King Khan and BBQ had a reputation that was pretty terrible. So Goner put it out. We had two releases coming out at the same time (by King Khan and BBQ and King Louie Bankston). King Khan and BBQ were on tour. We said to King Louie: “King Khan and BBQ are playing a show this Friday in Memphis. Louie, if you want to come up and do a show on Saturday, we can release Gonerfest editions of your records. We’ll call the two nights ‘Gonerfest’”. The Black Lips were on tour with King Khan and BBQ. We just padded the rest of the lineup out with Memphis bands. All of a sudden people said, “Man, I’m going out to Memphis. This is going to be great!” We had people come in from England. People from Italy like Frederico (Zanutto), the guy who runs Solid Sex Lovie Doll, came out. It was ridiculous. The place we held the shows at (The Buccaneer) holds about seventy-five people. There were easily two hundred people there. The shows were great. People were going bananas. It was sweaty and packed. The bands were excited. It was such a great time. Those accidental things can turn out so great. They’re so surprising and shocking. That was the start of Gonerfest. We called it a festival as a joke. But people like coming to Memphis. It’s cheap. There’s great BBQ. And what’s better than drinking beer and watching great bands for a whole weekend? Gonerfest works well too because the bands really want to play. They think it’s cool. We couldn’t afford to fly people in or provide guarantees on most of the shows. It’s grown because the bands are doing it out of their own goodwill.\n\nRyan: How is working out the logistics for Gonerfest? I imagine it must be difficult. You’re now doing shows at the Hi-Tone, The Buccaneer and the Goner store.\n\nEric: It’s a lot to organize, but it hasn’t been too hard. Again, when you’ve got bands that want to be there, it goes a lot easier. If someone’s playing a show strictly for money, it’s a different situation. The backstage might not be what they thought it’d be. Little problems can escalate quickly. But with a little bit of goodwill, things go a lot easier and everyone has more fun. The reason we started doing all of the other shows was because they started popping up anyway. You’d think that having twelve bands playing over three days was enough. But all of these other groups would show up to the festival and would want to play. So we started doing afternoon shows. Instead of having someone else book it—and maybe getting crappy bands in there—we started taking control over it and booked the shows ourselves. The afternoon shows have occasionally been better than the night shows. It’s just an outdoor party. It’s worked out pretty well. Planning for it hasn’t been too difficult.\n\nRyan: Did True Sons of Thunder just sort of happen like most of your other bands?\n\nEric: Funnily enough, True Sons of Thunder is probably the most planned out band I’ve had. The main singer, Richard Martin, plays a half banjo, half guitar that was made by a guitar and amp genius in town named Robert Hinson. Richard has been in noise bands like Corn For Texture. He was doing that in the ‘80s. I always wanted to be in a band with Richard. We started hanging out. Sam Liemer had moved up from New Orleans. He had played bass in Mangina. Abe (White) from The Oscars wanted to do something. Joe Simpson was around too. Joe had played in The Dutch Masters and The Rat Traps. We decided to do something. I was sort of in the middle of everything; not everyone knew each other. The first time Sam met Richard he thought Richard was homeless. Richard is six years older than I am. I’m probably six years older than Sam; Sam might be six years older than Abe. That sounds like eighty years! It’s a strange mix of people. Richard’s banjitar spews out this weird, effected noise that sounds like no other instrument. We did a record (Spoonful of Seedy Dudes) that our friend Chad (Booth) from New Orleans released. We’ve got other recordings that we’re trying to figure out what to do with. We like opening up people. It’s a good way to help touring bands. We know that we’re not going to be the most popular band in town. But that’s not the point. It’s for our own enjoyment. We think we’re great (laughs). It doesn’t really matter if we are or not.\n\nRyan: The Oblivians have recorded a new record that should be out fairly soon. I’ve heard some early mixes and the tracks are incredible.\n\nEric: Thanks. As far as The Oblivians record, it turned out pretty well. It was a little bit more work. We each brought some songs together. We recorded it in a fancier studio. It was pretty ridiculous. We tried to use this nice, two-inch reel-to-reel tape player that didn’t work. We’d do a take and if we wanted to listen to it, we’d have to stop and pull a section of the tape player apart. It was kind of perfect. It was recorded on broken equipment, even though we worked in a nicer studio. Doug Easley helped to produce. He didn’t do much because the engineer had to do all this technical stuff to keep the session going. It was perfect for Doug. He’d just nod his head from time to time and give some advice. Doug has a studio now that he does digital recordings at. After taking part in The Oblivians session he said, “Man, hearing how crappy that stuff sounded made me check to see if my old analog machines still worked.” We ended up going to Doug’s studio in Memphis and recorded stuff on his tape machine. It worked out well. The record was fun. “Call The Police” is a fun song to play. I think the record sounds like the Oblivians. I hope other people feel the same way.\n\nRyan: Usually when bands experience long gaps in recording, their new material sounds off. Production values will be different and songwriting changes. But the new album sounds like an Oblivians record.\n\nEric: I think so. It’s definitely not us drunk in the back of Shangri-La Records. But we haven’t really changed that much.\n\nEric Oblivian Interview, Part One\n\nEric playing with True Sons Of Thunder (photo by Renate Winter)\n\nEric Friedl (AKA Eric Oblivian) has played in some incredible garage-punk bands: The Oblivians, The New Memphis Legs, Bad Times and Dutch Masters.\n\nFriedl spent most of his youth in Hawaii and moved to Memphis in the early 1990s. With Greg Cartwright and Jack Yarber, he formed The Oblivians in 1993. Friedl started Goner Records the same year.\n\nThe Oblivians released three seminal full lengths on Crypt, as well as singles and EPs on Goner, Estrus, Sympathy For The Record Industry and In The Red. Friedl’s early selections for Goner Records were nothing short of amazing. When no other label was interested, Goner put out Guitar Wolf’s debut LP and released the first Reatards single, featuring fifteen-year-old Oblivians fan Jay Reatard banging on buckets for percussion.\n\nAfter the Oblivians disbanded in 1997, Eric formed The New Memphis Legs with James Arthur (ex-Necessary Evils) and Forrest Hewes of the Neckbones. As Bad Times, Friedl recorded a one-off record in 2001 with King Louie Bankston and Jay Reatard. A couple years later The Dutch Masters released their sole 7” on Goner.\n\nIn 2004, Eric and Zac Ives opened up the Goner storefront. Known for its incredible selection, Goner has become one of the most respected record stores in the United States. In 2005, Friedl and Ives started Gonerfest. Formed as a joke, the festivals have become major events, gathering diehard garage-rock fans from all across the world.\n\nWhen not busy running the Goner storefront and label, Friedl currently plays around Memphis with True Sons of Thunder. To the delight of garage-punk fans everywhere, The Oblivians recently recorded Desperation, their first full length in fifteen years. Look for it on In The Red Records.\n\nInterview by Ryan Leach\n\nThe following interview originally ran in Razorcake #72 (www.razorcake.org)\n\nRyan: What prompted your family to move to Hawaii from San Diego when you were young?\n\nEric: Although my dad wasn’t in the navy, he worked for the navy. They moved his job to Hawaii when I was twelve years old. We went from one nice beach place to another. It was perfect for a kid. I ran around on the beach all day. It kept me out of trouble.\n\nRyan: Was getting access to records difficult in Hawaii?\n\nEric: I grew up listening to Top 40 radio. I was really into pop music and Dr. Demento. I didn’t have an older brother to turn me on to Led Zeppelin. When I moved to Hawaii there was a DJ my friends and I knew—I don’t remember how we became friends with him—who gave us tapes with Ultravox and The Damned on them. We listened to those tapes a lot and the music on them spanned the gamut, from New Romantic to punk. By the age of thirteen I was looking for any records that seemed odd. A lot of weirdos ended up moving to Hawaii in the ‘60s and ‘70s. They got rid of their records by the ‘80s. Vinyl was cheap and their collections varied from Funkadelic to punk. Not a whole lot of live music was going on in Hawaii. I eventually found some people who were into punk.\n\nRyan: I read that you sang in a band that eventually became known as The Dambuilders. They later signed to a major label.\n\nEric: Yeah (laughs). It was pathetic. I was the worst singer the band ever had. We were called the Exactones then. I wanted to play music but I couldn’t play an instrument, so they made me the singer. We were really bad. They loved REM. We started out playing aggressive, fast songs. As the group got better at their instruments, they wanted to play prettier songs. For whatever reason, death rock and gothic music were really big in Hawaii. Bauhaus was popular. We’d play bills with these gothic bands. We were wimps and totally afraid of them. We played at a million miles an hour. The audience loved it because the gothic bands were playing at one mile an hour, pretending to be junkies. It was fun and the guys in the band put up with me. When they got more serious about their music, they moved to Boston. They took me along on one of their tours as their soundman, even though I knew nothing anything about being a soundman. They kept making bad decisions (laughs).\n\nRyan: How long did you live in Hawaii?\n\nEric: I stayed there through high school. Afterwards, I went to the mainland to go to college and wander around. When I got to Los Angeles, I started getting into weirder music. There was a lot more going on.\n\nRyan: You moved to Los Angeles from Hawaii?\n\nEric: I went to college in Los Angeles. I ended up moving to San Diego after I graduated college in ’88. I stayed in San Diego for a year. I moved to Boston next, stayed there for another year, and then I went to Memphis.\n\nRyan: What prompted you to move to Memphis?\n\nEric: I had a friend in college named Sherman Willmott. He was opening a record store in Memphis.\n\nRyan: Shangri-La Records?\n\nEric: Shangri-La Records. He asked me to come on down and help with his store. I wasn’t really doing anything, so I said, “Sure.” That’s how I started out in Memphis.\n\nRyan: Did you play in any other bands in Memphis before the Oblivians?\n\nEric: Not really. Jack (Yarber, AKA Jack Oblivian) and Greg (Cartwright, AKA Greg Oblivian) had already been in great bands. Even before The Compulsive Gamblers, they had played in The Pain Killers. I loved The Compulsive Gamblers. Their shows were ridiculous. They’d have horn sections. It was a spectacle. They’d let me get up on stage with them and sing some songs. Greg and Jack started hanging out at Shangri-La more often.\n\nAt the last minute, Greg was asked to play drums for 68 Comeback with Jeffrey Evans. While Greg was on tour, Jack showed me some guitar chords and we wrote some songs. When Greg came back, we asked him if he wanted to start a band. He said, “That sounds stupid. Why not?” I think Jack and Greg were tired of having to coordinate the practices for The Compulsive Gamblers. They wanted to do something stripped down and simple.\n\nRyan: It had to be simple. You were just learning guitar.\n\nEric: I knew nothing about playing guitar. Jack and Greg could do what they wanted to do, so long as I could keep up. “Show me the chords, and I’ll do my best to hang in there.”\n\nRyan: Jack mentioned in an interview that The Oblivians sound was largely attributable to the instruments you were using. Jack played the now infamous Airliner. Greg played a Harmony Rocket. I’m not sure what guitar you were using, but it looked like a Japanese model from the ‘60s.\n\nEric: When we formed The Oblivians I had to go out and buy a guitar. I found a ’60 or ‘70s Gretsch solid body. It was called a Corvette. I bought it for $100.\n\nRyan: That’s a great guitar.\n\nEric: It was. I didn’t have an amp, so I played through my home stereo. Plugging my guitar into a mic input on a tape deck gave me a great sound. It was completely fuzzed out. That helped hide the fact that I couldn’t play at all. I had gotten really excited one day and smashed that Gretsch. I didn’t know it at the time, but finding a great guitar is not easy. I had gotten lucky finding that one. I eventually picked up a Stratatone. I played that for most of my time with The Oblivians. Some of the guitars I played in the band were given to me. I’d change them up so they’d work for me. I’d put heavier gauge strings on them so they wouldn’t break.\n\nThe instruments we used were important. Greg’s distorted hollow body guitar is the early Oblivians sound. On the first recordings we did with (Doug) Easley, I’m still playing through my home stereo. That was my amp. That’s all I had.\n\nRyan: The Oblivians recorded some demos early on that later showed up on the On The Go record. Just after recording the demos, Jack moved down to New Orleans. You guys weren’t too serious about The Oblivians at the beginning, huh?\n\nEric: No. The Oblivians was a joke band. We wrote songs that we thought were too dumb to listen to but were fun to play. The songs gave us a reason to get together and have some beers.\n\nJack did go down to New Orleans for a while. The move didn’t really work out for him. Greg was in New York then. He played on a record with a girl named Casey Scott. He told Jack to come to New York because Jack had never been there before. We figured since two-thirds of the band was in New York, I should come up too and we could get some shows. Through working at Shangri-La, I knew Billy Miller (of Norton Records). He put me in touch with Todd Abramson; Todd booked Maxwell’s. Todd stuck us on a bill opening up for the Blues Explosion. That was an amazing experience; the Blues Explosion was just starting out. Jon Spencer loved us and gave our tapes out to people. It was a totally accidental thing. We gave a couple of songs to Larry Hardy (In the Red) and Tim Warren (Crypt Records) for singles. Eventually we decided to do a whole record (Soul Food). But for a long time we never took The Oblivians seriously.\n\nRyan: You started Goner Records in 1993 with the Guitar Wolf LP (Wolf Rock!).\n\nEric: The Oblivians and Goner started at about the same time. I went to Garage Shock and saw Guitar Wolf. I thought they were amazing. They weren’t even invited to the festival but showed up anyway. Dave Crider said, “Well, you came from Japan so I guess you can play.” They performed on a slot that was setup for a sound check, before the festival was supposed to start. They were completely out of tune and going bananas. I thought they were great. We followed them up to Vancouver. Guitar Wolf borrowed Young Fresh Fellows equipment. They managed to break an instrument or an amp. Young Fresh Fellows were not happy about it. It left an impression on me. Guitar Wolf was going to be in The States for a while. They came down to Memphis, played a couple of shows, and left me a cassette tape of their songs. It was great. It didn’t seem like anyone else appreciated their music—although they had a better reception with their live show (laughs). Guitar Wolf and I were faxing each other back and forth once they got back to Japan; this was pre-Internet. They thought I was asking them to do a 45. Until the records ended up in Tokyo, they thought it was going to be a 45 and not an LP. It was the right time. The garage-rock thing wasn’t played out yet. And Guitar Wolf was a weird mix—sort of a noise rock and garage-rock band. Distributors like Forced Exposure, who liked noisier stuff, could relate to it and the rock ‘n’ roll guys liked it too. Guitar Rock! is a fun record. Guitar Wolf ended up bringing us to Japan later on. It was a great time.\n\nRyan: Whenever I talk with Larry Hardy about the early days of In The Red, he mentions the early to mid ‘90s as being a great time for mail order and starting a small label.\n\nEric: It was. I was looking at old Forced Exposure magazines from the ‘80s recently. I could be wrong, but I’m pretty sure The Gibson Bros. would sell five thousand copies of a record. People were looking for those albums. Five thousand copies is nothing for a major label. But it is a lot for an indie label. Today we think of The Gibson Bros. as being obscure. But the bands we think of as big now, they likely don’t sell five thousand copies of a new release. Goner started at the tail end of that great period for mail order. Back then if someone you knew gave a good recommendation on a 45, you’d send off your three bucks.\n\nRyan: Another incredible early Goner release was the first Reatards 7”. The Oblivians influenced Jay tremendously. Do you remember meeting him for the first time?\n\nEric: Jay was just a bored, hyperactive kid when I met him. He wrote us a letter. The Oblivians were his favorite band. Jay asked for some stuff so I sent him some stickers. He sent me a tape. I was blown away by it: “Holy shit! This is exactly what I wanted to hear.” He was banging on buckets (for percussion). He played everything on the tape himself. It was like The Oblivians but a little bit different. The Dead Boys were in there too. He was also covering Buddy Holly songs. Jay was absorbing a lot of influences at a very young age. The single was so exciting. I sold a number of those. I remember I went to the Austin Record show. I was sitting there, sharing a table with Tim Warren. All these garage rock and punk rock people were stopping by. They were real collectors. I had a weird Moondog record that I wanted to sell for good money and a few other rare 45s. I had a stack of brand new Reatards records on the table too. People kept saying, “This Reatards 7” looks really cool!” It was on the same table as a bunch of rare records, and these collectors probably didn’t want to miss out on it. They played the 7” on a battery-powered turntable. It was all treble. It sounded like white noise. People asked, “How many of these can I buy?” We sold a ton. In retrospect, it might have been twenty. But the number of people who approached me about it was a total surprise. We had no idea that Jay would keep progressing. At the time he was just a kid coming up with great stuff. We didn’t think about the future. It was all about the present.\n\nRyan: I’m amazed that Jay used found objects for percussion. That’s something Bo Diddley did. People today rarely display that kind of ingenuity.\n\nEric: (laughs) I know.\n\nRyan: Your intuitiveness was really keen as well. You could have had three hundred Reatards singles stuffed away in your closet. Jay was just an unknown kid from Memphis then.\n\nEric: Jay was playing exactly what I wanted to hear. It was so exciting. The DIY aspect was appealing too. It was perfect. I started Goner because I wanted to release records that other labels wouldn’t. The Reatards single was one of those records. Here’s a fifteen-year-old kid from Memphis, banging on buckets. Jack, Greg and I loved it. Jay started hanging around. He used Jack and Greg as drummers at different points.\n\nRyan: Did you record all the early Oblivians singles that later showed up on the Soul Food LP with Doug Easley?\n\nEric: Doug recorded all of those songs. We recorded most of them in a single day. They were pulled from a cassette we had recorded in the back of Shangri-La. Doug is a really quiet guy who’s sort of hard to read. He’s a great guitarist; he played with Tav Falco. We’d throw songs out there and ask, “What do you think, Doug?” He’d respond, “I don’t know. What do you think?” We ran the vocals straight through a guitar amp. Anything we suggested he was fine with. Doug was sort of starting out too. It was perfect. We felt really comfortable recording with him.\n\nRyan: The Oblivians always chose great, varied covers: Trio, Love, Lightin’ Hopkins and the song “The Locomotion.”\n\nEric: We chose songs that we thought we could play together. That being said the Love song (“Alone Again Or”) was one we probably couldn’t play.\n\nRyan: It has a really intricate guitar part.\n\nEric: It does. I haven’t listened to that session in a while, but I’m pretty sure there’s a guitar amp that’s not mic’ed. We recorded the song live for a radio show. It’s a whacky recording.\n\nRyan: It’s a great cover. Love gets the Oblivians treatment.\n\nEric: Greg really liked Trio. He was into them for a long time. They were an underappreciated band. Everyone knows “Da Da Da”. Their songs were simple and had great riffs. We would take Blue Oyster Cult songs and dumb them down to the point where we could cover them. We never planned anything. I don’t know why Jack chose “The Locomotion” but it was a great song to play.\n\nRyan: Not long after The Oblivians formed you guys toured Europe. Did Tim Warren make that happen?\n\nEric: Yeah. We had only been around for a little while and hadn’t done much. Tim wanted to release all of the songs we had recorded with Doug Easley as a full-length record (Soul Food). Tim said, “Yeah, man, let’s put out a record and you guys can come and tour Europe!” We had done about ten shows, including the ones in New York with Jon Spencer. Tim put us on a tour with The Country Teasers for two months. It was great but the tour contained a lot of shows. We became tighter and more confident. When you’re playing in a hostile environment, you have to keep it together and just keep hitting people with songs. We developed that ability which was a good thing that came out of those shows. A bad thing about the tour was that we were drinking like crazy. The Oblivians was a half-assed band. We didn’t want to perform every night. That wasn’t really why we formed the band. We just wanted to play funny songs. Thinking about it now, I’m not sure if becoming tighter as a band was a good thing. Maybe by getting better at our instruments we were getting worse as a band.\n\nRyan: That’s sort of like The Shaggs. Although their second recordings are good, they’re not as brutal as the first ones on Philosophy of the World.\n\nEric: Right (laughs).\n\nRyan: Most things with The Oblivians seemed impromptu. You recorded Popular Favorites at two places—in New York with Jerry Teal and with Doug Easley in Memphis. Some of the tracks have a fuller sound.\n\nEric: We were actually surprised at how well they went together. We recorded the stuff with Jerry when it was freezing out, right at the end of a tour. We weren’t really feeling the tracks at first, but over time they sat well with us. We tried to do some stuff with Doug (Easley) afterwards. That wasn’t that great either. We ended up picking and choosing what we thought was the best stuff from the two sessions and putting them together for the album.\n\nRyan: The Oblivians Play Nine Songs With Mr. Quintron LP might be my favorite Oblivians record. It was a really different album for you, venturing into gospel music.\n\nEric: I really like it too. Jack and I didn’t stop writing songs. Greg just happened to have all of these gospel songs. He wasn’t feeling the rock thing then; he really wanted to do some gospel recordings. I was fine with it. Greg suggested Quintron. We were friends with him; he’d come through Memphis often. We called up Quintron and he said, “I’ll do it, but I have to have a (Hammond) B3 organ.” We thought, “Man, Quintron knows what he’s doing.” We found a studio that a friend of ours had. We had never recorded with him before but he had a B3. Quintron gets off the bus and into the studio, sees the B3 and says, “Man, this is great. A B3! I’ve never played one of these before.”\n\nRyan: (laughs) That’s hilarious. "
