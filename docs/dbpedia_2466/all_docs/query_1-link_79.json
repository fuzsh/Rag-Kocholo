        "text": "If we were to enter a brief history of college basketball into Captain Kirk's log, it might go something like this: In the beginning, the paleo-coaches, Adolph Rupp at Kentucky, Hank Iba at Oklahoma State and Phog Allen at Kansas, roamed their respective planets and ruled them as they wished. Then came the reign of the interplanetary emperors, who subjugated all other life-forms—NCAA executive director Walter Byers off the court and UCLA coach John Wooden on it. The game entered new dimensions of time and space during the 1980s. NCAA rulesmaster Ed Steitz introduced the shot clock and the three-pointer, and the omnipotent one, Big East founder and NCAA Basketball Committee chairman Dave Gavitt, skillfully disseminated that improved product throughout our universe.\n\nBut now Steitz is dead, and Gavitt has moved on to the NBA. And in the aftermath of what an earthling named Ross Perot might call \"a giant sucking sound,\" a lot of jockeying has commenced to fill the power vacuum.\n\nThe NCAA Presidents Commission is attempting to lead a Great Reformation of the sport. So far that has meant a later start to the season (this year practice began on Nov. 1 instead of Oct. 15), stricter limits on recruiting (coaches' trips have been cut back, and players must meet stiffer academic standards) and fewer coaches on the benches (staffs have been docked one assistant each). Needless to say, many in the coaching fraternity are not pleased.\n\nThe TV networks have also been busy, locking up exclusive deals with conferences. The leagues themselves are discovering a new pecking order; no longer does the Big East seem a threat to send three teams to the Final Four, as it did in 1985, while the Great Midwest Conference, which came into existence only a year ago with six members, suddenly looks like it might be a late-March regular.\n\nIn other words, the college basketball universe is changing, as all things inevitably must. To tip off the 1992-93 season, we've attempted to chart those heavens on the pages that follow, and here direct your attention to 20 of the most powerful forces in that firmament.\n\n(As you get out your telescopes, please note that some celestial bodies, in apparent defiance of physical law, appear in several places at once. In our universe that's perfectly possible—if you don't like it, make up your own universe.)\n\nIndiana's Bob Knight, North Carolina's Dean Smith and Georgetown's John Thompson are still the dominant figures in the three strongest leagues, the Big Ten, the ACC and the Big East, respectively. Each can make or break a would-be coach's candidacy with a single phone call, and their opinions count in the debate on any issue pertaining to college athletics. So why do we get the sense that none is as influential as before? Perhaps because all three seem to have lost a step: Knight spent much of this fall's recruiting season on a hunting trip in Montana; Smith still appears at times to be feeling the strain of losing top assistants Roy Williams (to Kansas) and Eddie Fogler (to Vanderbilt) in recent years; and only Thompson's last-minute signing of Othella Harrington in May temporarily eased the criticism that he has been a lollygagger of late on the recruiting trail. Further, each has recently had top players leave after a season or less. In Knight's case, Lawrence Funderburke bolted after six games; in Smith's, Clifford Rozier made it through one year; and in Thompson's, a parade of signees dating back to Michael Graham—Anthony Tucker, John Turner, David Edwards, Charles Harrison—have departed the Hilltop in a hurry.\n\nSome of this is attributable to these coaches' undiminished backbone—none is willing to kowtow to today's overflattered recruit. But Bob Gibbons, the scout whose ratings of high school players are respected by coaches and fans alike, poses another theory to explain those defections: \"In every instance it was a case of a round peg and a square hole. The new recruiting rules allow fewer contacts between coaches and recruits, and with fewer contacts neither party is going to know whether someone is a truly good fit.\"\n\nAnd, of course, as Gibbons points out, when coaches are limited to fewer contacts, some become more reliant upon middlemen. That creates an opening for undesirables, including all manner of summer coaches and street agents. New York City's Rob Johnson rates particular mention as a power broker because dealings with him landed both Syracuse and Texas A&M on probation in the space of 11 months.\n\nTom Odjakjian, Jim Haney and Tom Jernstedt are as obscure as Johnson is notorious—yet they're just as powerful. Odjakjian, an ESPN programming executive who has a hand in the scheduling of almost every game you see on the cable network, gets coaches the exposure they need to attract the players they need to win the games they need to get the exposure they need. It's NCAA deputy executive director Jernstedt, not boss Dick Schultz, who shapes the character of each season's tournament as a standing member of the men's basketball committee, which selects and seeds the field. As for Haney, the new executive director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), he's making it clear that his group will henceforth do much more than throw brunches at the Final Four. He has moved the NABC headquarters to Overland Park, Kans., just down the road from the NCAA offices, so that his organization can lobby more effectively on behalf of coaches, whose jobs are forever in jeopardy because of fickle university administrators.\n\nUntil he left Nike a year ago, rumpled shoe salesman Sonny Vaccaro wielded power through friendships—both with rising high school stars and with such coaches as Thompson, Syracuse's Jim Boeheim, Seton Hall's P.J. Carlesimo and Georgia Tech's Bobby Cremins. Vaccaro has gone out on his own now, but his clout is only slightly diminished as he embarks on a more variegated career—as a marketing consultant, game promoter and director of the new Academic Betterment and Career Development (ABCD) Camp, which attracted enough high school stars in its first season to suggest that Vaccaro will soon be a player-procurement player again.\n\nBeing employed at a traditional power gives Kentucky athletic director C.M. Newton a platform; being a former coach gives him credibility; being a panjandrum with USA Basketball—he was just named president but has had a hand in picking U.S. national teams for 12 years—gives him clout; and being a reformer fits him with a halo so he can act without being second-guessed. Hank Nichols has taken over Steitz's role as editor of the rules and sits on a permanent worldwide commission looking into ways to standardize the pro, college and international games. But his most immediate power is as NCAA supervisor of officials, the man who assigns referees for the tournament. The nation's refs spend months whistling for his attention.\n\nIf Dick Vitale and Billy Packer were mere TV commentators, they might not merit mention. They count because they're the only analysts who regularly engage the issues. Love him or hate him, Vitale reaches more people more volubly than anyone else in the game, and his access to players is unparalleled. Packer has similar clout with coaches, and he uses it to CBS's advantage in the scheduling of interconference games (although his network's contractual ties to the Big East and Big Ten mean he can't do as much game-making as he used to).\n\nNewcomer Mike Slive is neither the best-connected nor the most-respected collegiate commissioner, but his Great Midwest Conference debuted in splashy fashion last season—Cincinnati went to the Final Four and Memphis State to the final eight—and it could become the Big East of the Flyover if it can lure into its membership Notre Dame or a couple of schools (West Virginia? George Washington? Temple?) from the Atlantic 10. Slive's former law partner in Chicago, Mike Glazier, is influential in a different way. He used to work as the director of the NCAA's enforcement office, and he now conducts in-house probes for schools in trouble with his former employer. Illinois, Missouri, Texas A&M and Syracuse all used Glazier and Slive when they were under investigation by the NCAA, and some schools still pay Glazier large sums to keep them out of hot water. The infractions folks (David Berst, the most powerful vestige of the Byers era, remains the NCAA's chief cop) have tended to show more mercy for Glazier's clients than for saps like Kansas and Maryland, which decided to go it alone.\n\nAmong the younger generation of coaches, Mike Krzyzewski, the NABC president, has singular credibility for doing what none of his peers has done: winning back-to-back titles with serious students. Drake's Rudy Washington is the founder of the Black Coaches Association and continues to prod the consciences of administrators who otherwise might not take seriously the issue of minority hiring. USC coach and world-class networker George Raveling has suddenly emerged as a leader in the effort to reform the summer recruiting scene—pretty good for a guy who just two seasons ago looked as if he would be fired. And Tom Penders of Texas has used his position as one of the few shining lights of the Southwest Conference to good advantage. He threatened to leave Texas a few years ago if the conference didn't upgrade its officiating and even interviewed for various coaching vacancies. The stir he created probably still translates into an edge on the floor.\n\nEvery one of the aforementioned 20 movers and shakers is a player in the Tim Robbins sense, but none is a player in the more orthodox sense, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why real players don't shine in this galaxy. Forget about not being paid; players are worse off than that. They have no power. Their scholarships can be summarily canceled after any season. Their coaches can light out for another campus at any time, yet they must sit out an entire season if they want to leave. That's why, search as you might, you'll find no undergraduates on these pages.\n\nTHE HAND OF...\n\n...Dave Gavitt.
