        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe role of the immune system in controlling tumors has been suggested by numerous animal models and anecdotal reports of spontaneous regressions of tumors in humans following septic episodes or following various attempts at immune stimulation. Central to pathways for activating tumor antigen-specific T cell and antibody responses is the uptake, processing, and presentation of the tumor antigen by dendritic cells (DC), professional antigen-presenting cells [1, 2]. The importance of endogenous DC has been highlighted by better clinical outcomes for patients with various tumor types when DC are found to be infiltrating the tumor [3, 4].\n\nA major obstacle in the effort to develop effective cancer vaccines has been the capacity of tumors to evade immune surveillance. One mechanism for doing so is the inhibition of DC function [5]. DC isolated from tumor-bearing mice [6] and humans [7] have a diminished ability to stimulate T cells. Furthermore, the generation of “functionally mature” HLA-DR + DC from CD34+ precursors is diminished [8, 9]. Such inhibition leads to an imbalance between mature and immature myeloid cells (iMCs), and there is increasing evidence that progressive tumor growth is associated with an increase in iMCs, monocytes/macrophages, and a decrease in mature, functional DC [10–13].\n\nSeveral soluble factors have been implicated in defective DC maturation including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is critical for tumor-induced angiogenesis by promoting endothelial cell proliferation [14, 15]. Furthermore, high VEGF levels appear to block DC differentiation from immature precursors [16]. Specifically, VEGF binds to hematopoietic progenitor CD34+ cells through the VEGF-receptor-1 (VEGFR1/Flt-1) and inhibits the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB [17, 18], a component of which, RelB, has been implicated in the generation of mature DC. Conversely, anti-VEGF antibodies block the inhibitory effects of tumor cell supernatants on DC in vivo [16]. When anti-VEGF antibodies are used alongside DC immunotherapy, the antitumor effect is much more prolonged and pronounced [19]. These studies all suggest that blocking VEGF signaling may be one approach to improving DC response and hence improve host immune system function and the efficacy of antitumor immunotherapy in cancer patients.\n\nWe performed this study to determine the impact of pro-angiogenic molecules on DC and their precursors and to study the immunologic impact of eliminating VEGF with bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech) in patients with advanced malignancies. We demonstrate that VEGF is associated with defective DC maturation, which is restored by therapy with bevacizumab and that markers of immune function improve following bevacizumab treatment.\n\nResults\n\nDeficits in DC maturation in cancer patients\n\nTwo strategies were utilized to enumerate blood DC in cancer patients. First, we stained whole white blood cells with a cocktail of lineage antibodies against CD3, 14, 15, 19, 34, and 57, and then gated on the lineage negative population to identify the HLA-DR + cells as blood DC. This seemed to overestimate the percentage of blood DC (2.06 ± 1.57% of the mononuclear cells by this method) compared with the percentage generally reported in the literature (data not shown). To improve upon the method of DC quantification, we next used a different antibody cocktail consisting of antibodies against CD3, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 34, and 56, and gated on the lineage negative, HLA-DR + cells (see Fig. , region R2). Because this method was reproducible (coefficient of variance of 3.8% for three replicate analyses), it was used throughout the remainder of this report. There was no difference in the percentage of DC between the cancer patients (0.66 ± 0.28%) and healthy volunteers (0.57 ± 0.22%, P = 0.28) (Fig. ). The percentage of freshly analyzed DC that expressed CD86 was greater amongst healthy volunteers (71.54 ± 8.63%, Fig. a) compared with cancer patients (61.80 ± 11.29%, Fig. b) (P = 0.043), but there were no other differences in phenotypic markers between the cancer patients and healthy volunteers DC. We evaluated the subtypes of DC and found that the percentage of DC1 (CD11c + CD123−) tended to be lower in cancer patients (57.1 ± 15.8%) than in normal volunteers (66.6 ± 9.9%) (P = 0.058) [2], and the percentage of DC2 (CD123+) was nonsignificantly higher in cancer patients (29.3 ± 12.4%) than in normal volunteers (26.2 ± 10.7%) (P = 0.29).\n\nWe next examined the ability of DC to mature to CD83+ cells after an overnight incubation without additional cytokines added to culture conditions (Fig. ). A portion of the DC obtained from cancer patients (Fig. b) was able to mature spontaneously as determined by CD83 upregulation (19.7 ± 14.7%), although DC from healthy volunteers (Fig. a) showed higher CD83 upregulation (31.9 ± 12.7%, P = 0.054). Mean fluorescent intensity of HLA-DR expression on DC was significantly higher for DC from normal donors than those from cancer patients after overnight incubation (1,097 ± 469 vs. 637 ± 377, P = 0.047). In summary, these data show that the cancer patients, as a group, had deficits in DC maturation and a bias toward the immunoregulatory DC2 compared to DC from normal volunteers.\n\nAccumulation of immature myeloid cells in cancer patients\n\nWe next sought to determine whether there were defects in differentiation of cells toward the DC lineage, resulting in an increase in cells without lineage or differentiation markers (iMCs) in cancer patients. We first enumerated the entire population of cells that was CD45+ Lin− HLA-DR− (Fig. , region R3) and found no significant differences between cancer patients and healthy volunteers (1.23 ± 0.64% compared with 1.10 ± 0.47% of the CD45+ cells, P = 0.25). Because it is possible that NK and other cells with dim expression of the lineage markers might have been included in this gate (R3), we next focused on the population of cells with the least fluorescence for lineage markers and HLA-DR (see Fig. , region R4). There was a significantly higher percentage of these iMC in the cancer patients (0.50 ± 0.31%) compared with 0.32 ± 0.16% of the CD45+ cells in healthy volunteers (P = 0.011). A forward scatter/side scatter gram of iMC showed their distribution in the overlapping area of the lymphocyte and DC populations, suggesting that these might be the precursor of DC, but they are not red blood cell contamination or cell debris (Fig. a). These iMCs expressed myeloid markers, CD13, CD33, and CD11c (Fig. b), although with less intensity than DC, and only a minority was weakly positive for CD40 and CD86 expression. They were negative for CD80 and CD83, indicating their lack of maturation. They also lacked CD133 expression, indicating they were not stem cells (Fig. c).\n\nImmature myeloid cells correlate with markers of angiogenesis\n\nHigh levels of VEGF have been shown to increase the number of iMC, but other angiogenic markers have not been studied in detail. We therefore analyzed various markers of angiogenesis to determine whether an association might exist between these biomarkers and percentages of mature and immature DC and iMC. We found that D-dimer and VEGF were significantly elevated in platelet-poor plasma of patients compared to controls. There was no correlation between the percentage of DC or DC1 and D-dimer, VEGF, uPA, and PAI-1. However, a moderate positive correlation existed between the percentage of DC2 and PAI-1 (R = 0.50) (Fig. a). A weak positive correlation was also found to exist between the percentage of iMC and VEGF levels (R = 0.35), and a stronger positive correlation was found between the absolute number of iMC per microliter of blood and VEGF levels (R = 0.52) (Fig. b, c). Other markers such as D-dimer, uPA, and PAI-1 had no correlation. These data suggest that higher VEGF levels may be associated with an increased frequency of iMC. Analysis of CEC by flow cytometry showed a modest (1.3-fold) but not statistically significant increase in cancer patients compared to normal donors; however, CEP (Flk+/CD133+) was similar between patients and controls (data not shown). CEC and CEP levels in cancer patients with metastatic and localized disease were also not significantly different (data not shown). There were no correlations between iMC and CEC or CEP.\n\nAnti-VEGF antibody treatment reduces immature myeloid cells in cancer patients\n\nSince VEGF level in the serum showed a moderate correlation with the number of iMC in this study, we performed a pilot study in which cancer patients were treated with the anti-VEGF mAb (bevacizumab), to examine if manipulation of VEGF level can affect iMC or DC or both. Sixteen patients were originally enrolled and both pre- and post-treatment blood were available from 14 patients. Interestingly, administration of anti-VEGF mAb mildly increased DC numbers (pretreatment 0.47 ± 0.23 % vs. 0.53 ± 0.30% following bevacizumab); however, it did not affect DC1/DC2 ratio nor maturation status of DC (Fig. a, data not shown). However, anti-VEGF treatment induced a significant decrease in the number of iMC in peripheral blood (0.39 ± 0.30% pretreatment compared with 0.27 ± 0.24% following bevacizumab, P = 0.012) (Fig. b). Thus, the decrease in VEGF level may release the block on differentiation of the iMC.\n\nAnti-VEGF antibody treatment enhances immune function in cancer patients\n\nTo assess the effect of anti-VEGF antibody treatment on DC function, PBMCs from pre- and post-treatment blood were incubated with CD40 ligand, GM-CSF, and IFN-γ for 48 h, and IL-12 secretion was evaluated. As shown in Fig. a, 8 out of 11 available cases showed increase (more than 1.2 times) in IL-12 secretion, and the average for pre- and post-treatment PBMCs were 222.9 and 320.3 pg/ml, respectively (P < 0.01).\n\nMixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) and proliferation assays, using Candida Albicans, tetanus toxoid, phytohaemagglutinin antigen, and pokeweed mitogen, were performed on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three cancer patients before and approximately 14 days after they received bevacizumab alone. Allostimulatory function was enhanced in post-treatment samples in 9 of 14 patients, unchanged in 3 (Fig. b), and was suppressed in 2 patients. Proliferation of PBMCs against these antigens was enhanced in post-treatment samples in majority of the cases, especially for Candida Albicans and tetanus toxoid antigens (Fig. c). Significant increase in stimulation index (post/pre ratio > 1.2) was observed in 6, 9, 5, and 4 out of 14 patients for Candida Albicans, tetanus toxoid, PHA, and PWM, respectively. On the other hand, decrease in stimulation index (post/pre ratio < 0.8) was observed in only one case for each antigen. These results indicate that the anti-VEGF therapy is associated with enhanced antigen-presenting capacity of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, especially DCs. We suspect that the improvement in the immune response is due to the fact that the iMCs have an inhibitory activity in dendritic cell functional assays, because iMC do not possess any ability to present antigen in proliferation assays to autologous T cells nor do they activate an allo-immune response (data not shown).\n\nDiscussion\n\nCancer patients, particularly those with advanced stages of disease, have a diminished ability to activate immune responses against their tumor. Although the mechanisms responsible for this immune “defect” are multifactorial, DC dysfunction plays a key role [6, 7, 16, 27]. In the earlier studies performed by Gabrilovich, Carbone, and colleagues [10, 28, 29], the presence of increased iMC in cancer patients, which is associated with elevated levels of VEGF, was demonstrated to be involved in mediating DC dysfunction. Here, we extend these observations by focusing on an association of VEGF with DC maturation and the accumulation of iMC that correlates with serological biomarkers of angiogenesis. We observed an increase in iMC as defined by the lineage−, HLA-DR− cells in cancer patients compared with healthy volunteers and found a moderate correlation with VEGF levels (Fig. ), but not the other angiogenic markers (i.e., D-dimer, uPA, and PAI-1). The only other correlation identified was that of DC2 and PAI-1 (R = 0.50). These data implicate VEGF as an inhibitor of DC maturation, in addition to its role in directing neovascularization of tumors. They also suggest a possible association between PAI-1 and immunotolerizing DC, though not a direct cause and effect. Since PAI-1 is associated with poor prognosis of patients with different types of cancers [24, 25, 30], PAI-1 may have indirect correlation with immunoregulatory DC (DC2). Interestingly, Koretz et al. [31] observed that DC within colon cancers strongly expressed u-PA and, at a lower level, also PAI-1.\n\nAlthough our results are largely consistent with those of Gabrilovitch and colleagues, we did not observe an actual decrease in the total number of DC in cancer patients compared with healthy volunteers; however, we did detect fewer of the immunostimulatory DC1 and a trend toward more of the immunotolerizing DC2 amongst the cancer patients. We also found that DCs in cancer patients were less matured based on costimulatory molecule expression (CD86) and did not mature (less upregulation of CD83 and HLA-DR expression) after overnight culture. These findings may explain the defective function of DC in cancer patients, because mature DCs have a more potent immunostimulatory function than immature DC.\n\nWe found a significant decrease of iMC in cancer patients after the administration of anti-VEGF mAb (Fig. b). Since we observed a moderate correlation between the serum VEGF level and the number of iMC in the peripheral blood of cancer patients (Fig. ), this finding of anti-VEGF mAb effect on iMC might suggest the direct correlation between VEGF and iMC. Almand et al. reported three metastatic lung cancer patients, who experience a decline in iMC following treatment with chemotherapy and anti-VEGF mAb for several months [32]. However, the respective roles of the chemotherapy and anti-VEGF therapy in the decline in iMC cannot be determined from their study. Our study with anti-VEGF treatment alone can provide more direct evidence of possible association between eliminating VEGF and reducing iMC in humans.\n\nThe mechanism for the effect of VEGF on DC maturation and function could either occur at the level of bone marrow precursors or at later stages of development during the transition from immature to mature DC. VEGF could be a growth or survival factor for iMC. It is also possible that VEGF promoted differentiation of iMC to granulocytes/macrophages rather than toward DC. In our study, there was a greater effect of anti-VEGF therapy on reducing iMC than on increasing DC number (Fig. ), which supports the former scenario; however, we also observed that cancer patients’ DC do not mature as readily after overnight culture as the DC of healthy volunteers (Fig. ), which supports a further role for VEGF in inhibiting the ability of DC to mature. However, in our in vitro incubation system of human leukocytes, we cannot rule out the possibility that coexisted iMC might have inhibited the maturation of DC during overnight incubation time. By using in vitro culture system of murine cells, Dikov et al. [17] and Laxmanan et al. [33] reported that the direct impairment of DC function by VEGF is mediated primarily by VEGFR1/Flt-1. Dikov et al. reported that VEGF acted on early stages of DC differentiation but not on later phase of maturation. On the other hand, Mimura et al. [34] recently reported, using matured human monocyte-derived DC, that VEGF did not affect DC phenotype, but inhibited allo-stimulatory capacity through VEGFR2 receptor. Thus, more studies are needed to reveal the detailed mechanism of VEGF effect on human DC.\n\nBecause Gabrilovich and colleagues [10, 11] showed that the undifferentiated hematopoietic cells from cancer patients inhibited the function of fully differentiated DC, we hypothesized that administration of anti-VEGF Ab would result in enhanced DC functional capacity to activate alloimmune and antigen-specific immune responses. We could confirm the decrease of VEGF level in the sera of patients after anti-VEGF treatment, with some variations in the magnitude (data not shown). As shown in Fig. b, c, we observed that anti-VEGF mAb treatment enhanced the MLR (9 out of 14 patients) and antigen-specific T cell response (6, 9, 5, and 4 out of 14 patients for Candida Albicans, tetanus toxoid, PHA, and PWM, respectively), which coincided with a decrease of iMC. Interestingly, the patients with larger decrease in VEGF level by anti-VEGF treatment demonstrated strongly enhanced stimulation index for Candida albicans or PHA (data not shown). Thus, the decrease in VEGF level by anti-VEGF treatment seems to enhance antigen-presenting capacity of DC, probably, at least partly, by reducing iMC, which is reported to be inhibitory for DC function [10–13]. As mentioned earlier, we did not see clear change of DC phenotype or numbers in anti-VEGF-treated patients but still detected enhanced DC functional capacities after anti-VEGF treatment. The elimination of VEGF might not induce differentiation of iMC to DC, but rather induce differentiation to other cell types (i.e., granulocytes, macrophage). Alternatively, the direct effect of VEGF on DC is playing the major role in VEGF-induced suppression of DC function, and phenotype or number of peripheral blood DC might not be affected by short-term reduction of VEGF level in the serum. Larger number of patients with anti-VEGF treatments are needed to elucidate more precise mechanism of VEGF-mediated inhibition of human DC function.\n\nIn summary, our data indicates an association between VEGF and defects in DC maturation and function. Eliminating VEGF with anti-VEGF mAb in vivo resulted in a decrease in iMC, and induced a trend to an enhanced antigen-presenting function of DC. Future studies are needed to determine whether eliminating VEGF prior to cancer vaccines will lead to improvements in antitumor immunotherapy efficacy in cancer patients. We are currently evaluating the effect of eliminating VEGF with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab in human clinical trials."
