It represents a significant individual endeavor that can be either creative, scholarly, pedagogical, scientific, or service-oriented.\n\nWhether applying to graduate schools or to possible employers, Honors students discover that their senior project is a distinctive addition to their professional portfolios.\n\nThe students’ theses titles are listed on special pages of the graduation program and also, with their permission, digitally published on the WOU Honors Digital Commons webpage, available online."
