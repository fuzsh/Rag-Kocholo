        "text": "Emotional Impact of Medical Errors Victims of medical mistakesâpatients, families, and professionalsâare similar in many ways to victims of other types of traumas as they experience frequent images and/ or thoughts of the events that are triggered by nonspecific occurrences. But the sense of betrayal, loss of trust, isolation, and heightened vulnerability felt by both patients and their families is exacerbated in most cases because continued care is needed within the same system that harmed them. Patients and families perceive indifference from caregivers and feel isolated because emotional support is not typically provided when treatment ends (Delbanco & Sigall, 2007). Emotional support and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy have been suggested as strategies to ameliorate the negative effects of surviving medical error. All victimsâbe they patients, families, or professionalsâexpress the desire to connect with others who have experienced similar trauma (Delbanco & Sigall, 2007). Involving patients and families in the processing of an adverse event in a structured manner may provide better communication with those affected by the event (Etchegaray et al., 2014). As\n\nnursing staff represent that the majority of healthcare staffing, researchers have examined the safety culture within specific units, such as psychiatric inpatient units, to understand if unit safety culture is most salient for promoting patient safety. The research of Cho and Choi (2018) in this domain appears to verify that specific unit safety culture is among the most important factors, especially in the area of communication openness. Feedback and communication about errors, especially with family members, was associated with specific unit safety culture learning and practice. Because little research has been done to measure or identify patient safety competency among acute unit nursing staff, Cho and Choi (2018) sought to define measure and evaluate these factors, identifying attitudes, skills, and knowledge as the core of this type of competency. The authors concluded that nursing safety competency is plastic and can be improved with the right inputs. Case processing and debriefing related to adverse events were identified as useful measures to increase the safety competency of nursing staff.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe 1999 IOM report broke through the secrecy surrounding medical errors and fostered the growth of the patient safety movement, creating the research and clinical landscape that exist today. Patient safety has been the focus of many well-intentioned initiatives for more than a decade, but healthcare safety is still a work in progress and needs continual improvement. Few in the scientific and clinical community would dispute this claim. While many admirable projects have been studied and implemented, the overall field of patient safety suffers, as do many clinical fields, from fragmented definitions, insufficient regulatory oversight, and the clinical inertia that allow current practice to simply keep operating. The culture of medicine pervades most behavioral health settings. This cultural attitude can blame clinicians for adverse events rather than focusing on systems. To be safe, healthcare must learn from HROs, which perform high-risk activities with few accidents and adopt the human factors approach that acknowledges human fallibility, focusing on designing work processes that prevent harm and improve patient safety. Strategies to improve patient safety include safety briefings, root cause analysis, and full disclosure to patients and families about the circumstances surrounding adverse events.

Adverse events that are common in behavioral health settings include suicide, unreported abuse and neglect, and medical illnesses that are misdiagnosed as psychiatric conditions. The Joint Commission has placed these as top priorities for client safety in behavioral health. Licensed behavioral health professionals are advised to check with their licensing boards as to specific continuing education requirements on medical error prevention. Behavioral health professionals can play an important role in creating a safety culture by providing mental health services for victims of medical error. Victims experience symptoms similar to those experienced by other trauma survivors, such as burdens of betrayal, loss of trust, isolation, and heightened vulnerability. Professionals involved in adverse events that harm their clients are called second victims, and they may suffer from guilt, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, and decreased self-esteem. Behavioral health professionals can provide safer care by learning to identify vulnerable clients and error-prone conditions in the work setting and by providing psychosocial services to victims of medical mistakes.
