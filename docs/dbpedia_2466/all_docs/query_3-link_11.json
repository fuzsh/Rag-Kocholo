When he was discharged he went to college at Northeast Missouri State University, now Truman State, and received a degree in Nursing before entering Medical School at the Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine.\n\nUpon his return to Lewis County in 1984, Dr. Childress began his medical practice because there was a need for medical services that had been lacking since he was a child. He immediately poured all his efforts into serving the community and trying to help it grow in any way, shape, or form. He ran his practice with compassion, never turning anyone away – trading his services for baked goods, foraged fruits and mushrooms or wild game, taking phone calls at his house at all hours, and making house calls in any weather and down any road. He was the quintessential country doctor. He loved spending time on his farm, tending to cattle and fence and chewing the fat over the back of a truck or scoop of a tractor. He was a passionate outdoorsman. If you couldn’t find him in the clinic, he was in the outdoors sharing it with his friends. He also made time to be a family man, caring for his 4 sisters, and loved making memories with his children and grandchildren. In conversations with anyone, he would be quick to update them on his family’s current activities whether they asked for it or not. There isn’t enough space on this paper to list all his accomplishments and things that he was proud of, but being from and caring for the residents of Lewis County was #1 on the list. Doc Gene was a member of the Lewis County Memorial Post #578 and the LaBelle Masonic Lodge #222 as well as numerous other civic organizations supporting the betterment of the community.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Peggy Childress of Lewistown, MO; two sons, Christopher (Monica) Childress of Collierville, TN and Nathan (Amanda) Childress of Lewistown, MO.; six grandchildren, Caleb, Dalton, Bradyn, Asher, Reece and Adley Childress; four sisters, Joyce (John) Logan of Ewing, MO, Kitty Shults of Ewing, MO, Veda Shults of Lewistown, MO and Pamela Childress of Canton, MO; and several nieces & nephews.

Michael was the only son of Albert Frank French, Jr., and Kathryn Patricia (MacKoske) French. Michael graduated from Saint Thomas Aquinas High School in La Crosse in 1966 and earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Education at the University of Wisconsin in 1972. After 3 years of public-school teaching, Michael joined the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services Emergency Medical Services team as they regrouped to upgrade training. Over his 15 years there, Michael rose from emergency medical services instructor to section chief of EMS. In addition, he participated in development of national training materials and standards including the “EMS Instructor Training Course” for the United States Department of Transportation in 1985. Michael was a founding member of the Continuing Education Coordination Board for Emergency Medical Services Inc. in 1992 and newsletter editor for the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians from 1983 to 1991. Following his employment at the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services, Michael served as co-director of the Missouri Area Health Education Centers Program located at the A.T. Still University/Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine in Kirksville, Missouri from 1990 to 2020. Serving the state through seven regional offices and three partner medical school offices, the Missouri AHEC program worked to enhance Missouri’s health professions workforce distribution, quantity and quality. Engaging a wide range of health professions in addition to medicine, AHEC leaders and staff helped communities enhance their efficacy at identifying, supporting, recruiting and retaining future providers. As in Wisconsin EMS, Michael was active in national AHEC program initiatives, eventually becoming one of the most recognized leaders in AHEC legislative relations. He was active in a variety of community and professional organizations, frequently holding leadership positions and receiving recognition for contributions to the work of the group.\n\nOn October 11, 1991 Michael and Janet Streeter Head secretly got married on a trip to Washington DC. On November 26, 1991, they celebrated their marriage with family and friends in Oklahoma City, OK. They worked together at ATSU until retirement in 2019 and relocated to Lakeview Village Senior Living Community in Lenexa KS in 2021. Michael had many non-work interests through the years including collecting LP records, stuffed animals, coins, neckties, books by and about William Faulkner, about the civil war, US Presidents and state histories. He also took an interest in others’ areas of interest—oldest granddaughter Annabel worked her way up to a pitching position for the Truman State Lady Bulldogs and Michael subscribed to the feed carrying the Great Lakes Valley Conference games so we could watch the games we couldn’t go to. He also shared expertise and interest in computers/technology with Dan and shared with the entire family an interest in Wisconsin Volleyball.\n\nWhile working in health administration and education and living a large part of his adult years in Missouri; Michael maintained strong ties with both theater and his home state of Wisconsin. This commitment was demonstrated by his annual attendance and support of the outdoor presentations of American Players Theater of Spring Green, Wisconsin. The joy he experienced every year from these treks was apparent from January when tickets went on sale, till the tickets were delivered in April, and positively palpable as he and Janet headed to Wisconsin in the summer or fall.\n\nIn late January 2023, after having meticulously managed kidney disease for nearly 40 years and having carefully juggled symptoms of several chronic conditions that can come with increasing years, he was diagnosed with bladder cancer. After two surgeries and multiple readmissions for complications, he was transferred to Hospice service on December 21 and died December 24; all with his usual calm, persistence and grace.\n\nMichael is survived by his wife, Janet, and by his children Rebecca (Drew) Zimmer and Daniel (Tera Linenberger) Head. He is also survived by grandchildren: Annabel, Audrey, Aliza, and Bella Zimmer and Noah and Lane Linenberger.\n\nJames E. Gardner, DO, ’62, Kirksville, Missouri, died Dec. 21, 2023, at age 90. Doc Gardner led a legendary life. At 90 years old this Northeast Missouri farm boy, veteran, doctor, businessman, exotic animal trader and rare coin collector, known as “Doc” by those who knew him from his medical career, and “Animal Papa” by those who loved him and are his legacy, passed away in his hometown of Kirksville, Missouri from a heart so big it couldn’t be contained. He passed away at home under the care of Hospice of Northeast Missouri while surrounded by loving family on Thursday December 21, 2023. That legacy includes his wife of nearly a half century, Wilma (Wells) Gardner, six children: Lynn Ann (Gardner) Roberts and husband Larry of Weatherby Lake, MO., James Michael Gardner and wife Cindy of Columbia, David Bryan Gardner and wife Joy of Lee’s Summit, MO., Kelly Wayne Gardner and wife Pam of Cottleville, MO., Cynthia Marie (Gardner) Lewellen and husband Chuck of Kirksville, MO., and stepson Greg Murphy and wife Kim of Kirksville, MO., along with eighteen grandchildren, and fifteen great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his parents, Earnest and Maxie (Smith) Gardner, his sister Mary (Gardner) Emdia, stillborn granddaughter Tanya Gardner, and grandson Matthew Lewellen, a Green Beret killed in action in Jordan.\n\nHis larger-than-life persona drew comparisons to John Wayne, but his smooth moves on the dance floor brought Fred Astaire to mind. On any given Saturday night, you could find Jim and Wilma dancing at the VFW, where he rarely sat out a dance, especially if the great-grandchildren were there. He was not one to sit out much in life.\n\nJames Edgar Gardner was born October 18, 1933, in Hurdland, Missouri, to Earnest and Maxie Gardner. His father was a farmer and his mother a teacher in Knox County. In fact, she taught in a one-room schoolhouse near their farm and Jim was one of her students. He said he never gave his mother credit for her intelligence; she earned a Masters degree in the 1950’s when few women were pursuing a college education. He graduated in 1952 from Knox County High School in Edina, Missouri, and left Missouri to seek his fortune in factories out of state, then enlisted in the U.S. Navy where he served two years on the USS Randolph aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean. When he returned to Kirksville he married his high school sweetheart, Sue Bishop, in 1954. Together they had five children in seven years: Lynn, Mike, David, Kelly and Cindy. After their divorce he married Wilma Murphy in 1977 and gained a stepson, Greg Murphy.\n\nAs a young father in his senior year at Kirksville College of Osteopathy and Surgery, Jim was elected student body president. While still in medical school he began working at the downtown clinic of Mildred Gelbach, D.O., and he took over her practice in 1964 after she was struck by a car while in California. He recently told a reporter for the Adair Historian that he didn’t leave the county for seven years after taking over the clinic. He trained himself to function on just four hours of sleep a night. He was known as Kirksville’s baby doctor and estimated he delivered more than 4,600 babies in his career. If there was a complicated birth, his colleagues called on him for the special delivery. He also pioneered the use of the laparoscope in Missouri. His clinic partners over the years included the late Mary Boller, D.O., and Joseph Marino, D.O., now of South Carolina. Along with Dr. Marino and several other doctors he owned and operated Grim-Smith Hospital until they sold it. He continued owning farms and became one of the first to raise French Charolais cattle in the state. He and fellow investors built a thriving night club, the Golden Spike, that hosted nationally known musicians and comedians in downtown Kirksville; they opened a second one in Quincy, Illinois. Among the other local businesses he developed were the Crown Drive Professional Building on Hwy. 63, two medical research businesses, Sunbrite Laundry, Aladdin Glass and home decor store, Colonial Manor Motel, and Pancake City on Hwy. 63 in partnership with daughter Cindy and her husband Chuck Lewellen, and Gardner Miniatures with wife Wilma.\n\nWhen Dr. Gardner retired from medicine at the age of 53, he and Wilma moved to wooded acreage adjoining Thousand Hills State Park and began their exotic animal business. Over the following decades they raised llamas, zebras, red deer, buffalo, elk, camels, fainting goats, exotic birds like emus and peacocks, and finally, miniature donkeys and miniature horses. Their first llama was house-trained and slept with them in the bunkhouse while their home was being built. Every Fourth of July, the Gardners and the Waddles invited hundreds of family members and friends to gather in a clearing at the place he called “theBrush” to create memories riding mules, playing horseshoes, eating turkey fries, and telling tall tales, culminating in the largest fireworks display in Northeast Missouri. The other holiday he made famous for the family became known as “Walmart Christmas” when he and Wilma hosted a big meal and distributed envelopes filled with cash to take the whole family shopping together at Walmart the weekend before the holiday.\n\nAn athlete in high school, he recalls playing basketball against Norm Stewart, whom he remembered as “a tough SOB”. As an adult he coached the American Legion Kirksville Royals and other KBA baseball teams to many a victory and all of his sons played the game. The baseball field in Kirksville is named “Doc Gardner Field” in his honor. In recent years he was elected to the KBSA Hall of Fame. He traveled the region in support of his grandkids and great-grandkids, whether it be basketball, football, softball, baseball, track, dance, poker, or even soccer (not his favorite sport). He loved to cheer them on.\n\nBefore moving to Missouri to farm, Jim’s father Earnest built roads in Illinois with wagons pulled by mules. In his forties, Jim Gardner took up Mule Jumping and trained his favorite mule to jump over a wall as tall as 67 inches. With his jumping mule Icey they won three state fair competitions in Missouri, Iowa and Illinois. Doc asked that his ashes be spread on the ridge where his best mule Icey and his best dog Phideaux (pronounced Fido) are buried. A farm boy at heart, as his medical career in Kirksville flourished, he bought a series of farms in Adair County and kept them until he could double his money, using the proceeds to buy the next farm. Land was important to him. Striking a good deal was too.\n\nWell known for his generosity, Doc Gardner was asked to help put together a Wagon Train for Boys Town of Missouri in St. James. For eight years he and Wilma, along with friends from the Waddle family, provided riding animals for a trail ride for 100 abused and neglected boys. The 170-mile ride started in St. James and went all the way to the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. Over those eight days, Doc recalled that the boys learned to ride and gained a sense of pride and connection to their animals. Missouri’s governor presented Jim and Wilma with the Child Advocate of the Year award for their work.\n\nJim Gardner had a love of adventure, hunting, fishing, and pulling legendary pranks; he was adept at telling a good joke, especially the off-color ones. His tenderness when caring for the sick or small children and animals, along with his legendary zest for life, benefited multiple generations. His resiliency in surviving more than two decades with a brain tumor gave him countless opportunities to experience the joy and fullness of a life well lived with family and friends. At the end of his life, despite the pain, he was the first to say his nine decades went by in a flash and that he was “a lucky man who had a great run!”\n\nJohn H.

Magnus, DMD, ’19, MPH, ’12, Union, New Jersey, died May 4, 2024, at age 40. George was born on September 5, 1983, to Leonid Mironyuk and Zinaida (Zinkevych) Mironyuk in Lutsk, Ukraine. He was the youngest sibling of Serhiy, Vitaliy, Pavel, Helen, and Mariya. In October 1990, he immigrated to the United States with his father and siblings. His mother passed away en route. Despite his complicated childhood that prevented him from finishing high school, he persevered and obtained a General Education Diploma. In 2007 he graduated from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology. He worked as a dental assistant at various places, including American Dental Center in Union, NJ, where he moved in 2008. After relocating to Arizona in 2009, he continued to pursue dental work and studies. In 2012, he graduated from A.T. Still University of Health Sciences with a Master of Public Health degree. In 2019, after obtaining another degree, Doctor of Dental Medicine, from the same university, he worked for three years at Affordable Dentures and Implants in Bullhead City, AZ, where he was owner of the practice. In 2022, he moved to Yuma, AZ, to work as a dentist at Arizona State Prison Complex. In October 2023, he made another move and started as a dentist at Zufall Health, West Orange, NJ.\n\nRecently, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which finally provided him with answers to his mood shifts and behavior throughout his life. George had a roller coaster life with periodic ups and downs. In his up times, he was outgoing, meeting new people, and taking on difficult projects. In his down times, he withdrew, stopped communicating, and had difficulties performing simple tasks. As a result, his social life suffered and he often blamed himself for not always being “the same person.”\n\nGeorge moved to Arizona hoping to take advantage of the sunny climate. He thought that he had seasonal disorder where a person feels great in summer and lousy in winter. Right after settling in Arizona, he was really happy. All his problems seemed to be in the past. But the ups and downs came back. He returned to New Jersey hoping to find a cure through being with family. He thought that maybe the loneliness was the problem. It seemed to work at first. He felt upbeat, communicative, full of energy, invincible. He became so confident that he decided to go to Ukraine and open a company. The company was his way to make a material contribution in supporting his native country fighting a war. He succeeded in this effort. However, this turned out to be his up time. When he came back he slowly slipped into his down time. George was aware of his problems and took advantage of his up times as much as possible. While living in Massachusetts and attending UMass, he built his own shed room in the backyard. It had electricity from the main house, air conditioning, a TV, a bed, and a set of drums and guitars which he played alone and with his friends. He read ravenously trying to make sense of the world and find answers to the questions that kept him up at night. He visited many countries and learned Spanish, which served him well in his dental work. Together with his cousins once removed, and best friends, Alex Glib and Dmitriy Kukharchuk (Samoylov), he made a memorable trip to Peru in 2015. After graduating from ATSU in 2019, he went on a motorcycle trip across Europe, including Ukraine. He also rode a motorcycle across Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. He performed pro bono dental work in the Dominican Republic and ventured across the border into Haiti, despite unsafe conditions there. During his short life, he experienced more than most people would in their entire lifetime.\n\nHe took advantage of his down times as well by scaling back on his activities and rescheduling important work and decisions for later. He was able to manage it for some time. That is how he achieved a great education and professional success. As time passed by, the stressors of life started to take more and more effect on him. He fought back fiercely by seeking help from family, psychiatrists, and therapists. He also wrote in his diary, conversing with himself, deliberating about various decisions, looking for answers. On the endpaper of one diary book he wrote, “Don’t be sad that it’s over. Be grateful that it happened.”\n\nGeorge was predeceased by his mother and father. He is survived by his siblings: Serhiy, Vitaliy, Pavel, Helen, and Mariya; his stepmother, Vera Mironyuk; his sister-in-law, Nadya Geniush; his brother-in-law, Ilya Kobzar; his niece, Martha Myroniuk and her husband, Dmitriy Chaplin; his niece, Polina Myroniuk; his niece, Anya Kobzar; his nephew, Daniel Kobzar; his aunt, Nina Derevyanchuk and her husband Vasiliy; his aunt, Vira (Mironyuk) Vaplyaruk in Ukraine; as well as numerous cousins and their children.\n\nRichard J.
