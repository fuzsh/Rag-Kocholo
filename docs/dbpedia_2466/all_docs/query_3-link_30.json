        "text": "MHP STUDENT RESEARCH, PROJECTS & WORK\n\nInternships\n\nTheses\n\nHistoric Structures Reports\n\nINTERNSHIPS\n\nProfessional internships are strongly encouraged for students in the MHP program. Dozens of opportunities are available through the United States and abroad. Internships may be eligible for credit hours, and often include a stipend or other form of compensation. Read below for a sample of how our students have gained valuable experience interning with preservation organizations.\n\nMHP SUMMER 2021 INTERNSHIP HIGHLIGHTS\n\n|\n\nSTUDENT INTERNSHIP SPOTLIGHTS: ENGLISH HINTON AND ZACK ORR\n\n|\n\nAnders Yount, left, and Mills Dorn, right, in the field for Find!It\n\n(Photo Credit: UGAToday)\n\nFindIt! Program\n\nMills Dorn ('19), Carter Finch ('19), Savannah Young ('19), and Anders Yount ('18) worked with the FindIt! Program to complete cultural resource surveys in Dooly County. This included conducting field surveys to identify and document historic properties, as well as entering this data into Georgiaâs Natural, Archaeological, and Historic Resources GIS. FindIt! is housed in the Center for Community Design and Preservation at the College of Environment and Design here at the University of Georgia. Read UGAToday's feature on the program and learn more at http://findit.uga.edu/.\n\nFive historic boathouses dubbed the \"Painted Sisters\" at Thousand Island Park.\n\nThousand Island Park\n\nFor the past two years, Caitlin Plesher ('19) has spent her summers interning with the Thousand Island Park Landmark Society and Thousand Island Park Corporation in beautiful upstate New York. The park was a Methodist campground established in 1875 that still continues to attract visitors from throughout the United States. As part of her internship, Caitlin put together exhibits on TIPâs history, surveyed historic cottages and boat houses, and compiled archival research and maps that will assist in the addition of the boathouses to TIPâs National Register listing. She said, âThe Thousand Islands area is absolutely gorgeous with a rich history that has been beautifully preserved. I canât wait to go back soon!â\n\nSherrie Raleigh (left) with members of the Hartwell citizen committee\n\nArchway Partnership\n\nThe Archway Partnership is a UGA program that pairs students with communities to address their needs. As part of second-year student Sherrie Raleigh's ('19) assistantship with Archway, she is collaborating with citizens of Hartwell, Georgia to consolidate historic walking tours and research downtown buildings. Other projects MHP students have completed for Archway in the past include making recommendations for adaptive reuse, writing National Register nominations, and developing interpretative markers.\n\nLauren Patterson at the Portland Head Light, Maine's oldest lighthouse\n\nGreater Portland Landmarks\n\nLauren Patterson ('19) joined Greater Portland Landmarks in Maine to perform architectural surveys of neighborhoods vulnerable to development. With a team of three other graduate students from around the country, she surveyed six neighborhoods, researched their historic contexts, and helped develop the case for how the areas tell the story of Portland and deserve diligence to ensure their character is retained. Check out the Landmarks' blog for more on her adventures in New England.\n\nMaxwell Nosbisch in front of Sagamore's main lodge\n\nGreat Camp Sagamore\n\nFor the past two years, Maxwell Nosbisch ('20) has spent his summers and falls interning with Great Camp Sagamore National Historic Landmark in Raquette Lake, New York- an Adirondack Great Camp.The site was the summer home of the Vanderbilt family and is the progenitor of \"Rustic\" architecture in the United States. The internships focused on interpretation and the preservation of the original structures. Maxwell took part in a rehabilitation of the original servants' quarters which now serves as the site's gift shop, intern lodging, and lounge. Maxwell also created a new tour of the site that focused on the female history including Margaret Vanderbilt. Maxwell said, \"Great Camp Sagamore is always looking for interns that are ready to get their hands-dirty and learn hands-on preservation techniques. Anybody interested in the MHP at UGA will find Great Camp Sagamore a beneficial internship to their possible career goals.\"\n\nThe Governor's Mansion was built in 1839, when Milledgeville was the capital of Georgia.\n\n(Photo Credit: Visit Milledgeville)\n\nThe Governor's Mansion\n\nDarcie Scales ('20) has always loved history. Thatâs why she jumped at the opportunity to take an internship with the Old Governorâs Mansion in Milledgeville, Georgia. She quickly found herself doing such things as transcribing the private journals of people like former Governor Joseph E. Brown and his wife. The chance to work with original documents thrilled Darcie as she is interested in a career in archival research. Her time at the Old Governorâs Mansion taught her what it takes to read and interpret historical manuscripts, which in turn helped the site further the interpretation it gives to the public.\n\nElyse Hoganson dove into her hometown's history by interning with the local historical society.\n\nEtowah Valley Historical Society\n\nBeing from Cartersville, Georgia, Elyse Hoganson ('20) has always felt a connection to the history of her hometown. That is why she decided to spend the summer interning with the Etowah Valley Historical Society. Hoganson wrote articles for the Society's website regarding her research on historic schools in Bartow County, Georgia. The research was intensive, involving a variety of materials such as historic newspapers, microfilm, interviews, and site visits. Through her work, Hoganson identified three different types of historic schools in Bartow County. The depth of research surprised Hoganson, who feels the lessons learned helped her become a more professional preservationist.\n\nKnox Heritage\n\nAs a Knoxville, Tennesee native, Rose Mayo ('20) has seen the impact of a growing effort toward historic preservation throughout her hometown. When the opportunity arose to intern with Knox Heritage, she was eager to contribute her efforts to the fantastic work the organization does in the community. Rose assisted on a number of projects under the direction of the Director of Education and Technical Services, most notably researching and writing portions of a National Register nomination for the first multi-level parking garage in the downtown area. This internship provided Rose invaluable insight into the work of preservation professionals and helped her ultimately decided to pursue an MHP at UGA.\n\nOther organizations with which MHP students have recently interned include: Athens-Clarke County Planning Department (Athens, GA); Great Camp Santanoni (Adirondacks, NY); Historic Savannah Foundation (Savannah, GA); Historic Rural Churches of Georgia; the Northeast Georgia Regional Planning Commission (Athens, GA); the Cannonball House (Macon, GA); WLA Studio (Athens, GA); and Historic Macon Foundation (Macon, GA), among others.\n\nTheses\n\nMaster of Historic Preservation students represent a variety of academic and cultural backgrounds and interests. This is reflected in the breadth of projects taken on as independent thesis research. The below list includes completed topics through the Spring 2018 semester.\n\nWhile travel is not required, many MHP students choose to do their thesis research on locations with which they have a strong connection. This has taken them to places such as duck camps in Louisiana (left); Nassau, Bahamas (middle); and Minneapolis, Minnesota (right).\n\nHistoric Structures Reports\n\nAccording to the National Parks Service, âa historic structure report provides documentary, graphic, and physical information about a propertyâs history and existing condition.â By partnering with local historic sites, students in the MHP program get hands-on experience completing HSRs and learning how this vital resource plays into preservation planning. Below are examples of HSRs that students have completed on a variety of different building types for the Building Materials Conservation class.\n\nOconee County High School\n\nDenmark Hall\n\nBowersville Gin\n\nWright House Outbuilding"
