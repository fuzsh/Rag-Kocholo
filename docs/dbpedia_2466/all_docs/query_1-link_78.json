        "text": "20th-Century Environments\n\nWhile the field of vernacular architecture emerged from a concern about how old buildings can be used to better understand the past, it has shifted to include more recent aspects of the built environment. Some scholars have taken a historical approach, emphasizing the rise of new forms, while others have focused on lessons to be learned in the present from places created in the very recent past. Housing has been a major focus, with the rise of suburban landscapes occupying much attention. Additionally, commercial environments, from main streets to motels to strip malls, have become subjects of investigation and scrutiny. As 20th-century places age, issues related to their preservation have also risen to the fore.\n\nHousing\n\nIn the 20th century, housing patterns shifted as people moved from cities to the suburbs, where they embraced pastoral ideals and took advantage of new forms of transportation. Jackson 1985 introduces the subject, including post World War II suburbs, in Crabgrass Frontier. That volume was followed more recently by books such as Jacobs 2015 and Lane 2015, which offer greater historical perspective on the postwar building of average single-family houses in subdivisions. While much scholarship has focused on the United States, Harris 1996 examines the prewar period in Toronto, Canada, and Cupers 2014 looks at post–World War II France. Aside from suburban single-family houses, other works have addressed alternative residential types, including Lasner 2012 on condos.\n\nCupers, Kenny. The Social Project: Housing Postwar France.

Cupers explores their motivations, influences, and legacy as he charts their proposed solutions, which transformed the French countryside. For students of American suburbs, the books provides a useful comparison.\n\nFind this resource:\n\nGoogle Preview»\n\nWorldCat»\n\nLasner, Matthew Gordon.

Changes in transportation, particularly the rise of the automobile, affected not only residential patterns but also commercial ones. Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown, and Steven Izenour published the results of a graduate seminar at Yale in their trailblazing book Learning from Las Vegas (Venturi, et al. 1977), which called on designers to take lessons from everyday roadside architecture. Inspired by their work, Chester Liebs further explored roadside architecture through his history of building types such as drive-ins and supermarkets, no longer limiting the study of roadside buildings to the iconic Vegas strip (Liebs 1985). Continuing in this tradition, other works explore new building types more specifically, including Jakle, et al. 1996 on motels and Longstreth 1997 on retail environments, while Esperdy 2008 looks into how older spaces of main street were updated. Longstreth 2015, Looking Beyond the Icons, also includes religious, educational, and cultural spaces and calls for informed preservation of vernacular 20th-century buildings.\n\nEsperdy, Gabrielle. Modernizing Main Street: Architecture and Consumer Culture in the New Deal.

Esperdy’s work is informed by national architectural trade journals and was inspired by New York City, but it embraces main streets in towns and small cities across the United States, concluding with a case study of Reading, Pennsylvania. While about commercial buildings, the book uses architecture as a lens to explore public policy and consumer culture, as well as extruded aluminum sash and international style facades.\n\nFind this resource:\n\nGoogle Preview»\n\nWorldCat»\n\nJakle, John A., Keith A.

Distinct regional trends have thus been the subject of many works. Scholars explain why this place is different from that place or how ideas spread across space and time. Given the origins of the field in the United States on the East Coast, the New England and Chesapeake regions are best represented in regional studies, although slowly scholarship has embraced other regions as well.\n\nNew England\n\nThree works mark the beginning of vernacular architecture studies of early New England: The Framed Houses of Massachusetts Bay (Cummings 1979), A Little Commonwealth (Demos 2000), and New England Begins (edited by Jonathan L. Fairbanks and Robert F. Trent. Boston: Museum of Fine Arts, 1982), which includes a seminal essay on domestic and agricultural architecture by Robert Blair St. George. All three arose within the context of public history. Framed Houses brings together decades of fieldwork undertaken by Abbott Lowell Cummings as part of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, now Historic New England. In A Little Commonwealth, first published in 1970, John Demos uses a new social history approach to better understand families in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The first third of the book focuses on the physical setting, drawing on research being done for Plimoth Plantation. New England Begins: The Seventeenth Century, an exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, was accompanied by a monumental three-volume catalogue featuring essays by noted scholars, including St. George who writes on vernacular architecture. While all of these studies focused on the earliest buildings in the region, other works expand both the geography and scope. Hubka 1984, Heath 2001, and Garrison 2006 all turn their attention to the 19th century, using different lenses. Hubka writes about a regionally distinct building type, the connected domestic and agricultural buildings found on interior New England farms. Heath 2001 shifts attention to the industrial landscape of textile mills and their surrounding communities, not only as they existed when first developed, but also as they changed over time. And Garrison examines the buildings and practices of two generations of the Stearns family, who worked in Northfield, Massachusetts.\n\nCummings, Abbott Lowell.

The mid-Atlantic offers a place to explore the role of ethnicity in the creation of distinctive, regionally specific buildings. Pennsylvania particularly, with its large 18th-century Germanic population, provides an opportunity to examine the role of cultural difference as it relates to architecture. Pendleton 1994, Falk 2008, and McMurry and Van Dolsen 2011, are all aimed at better understanding Pennsylvania German people through their buildings. Lanier 2005, a study of the Delaware Valley, which includes New Jersey and Delaware as well as southeastern Pennsylvania, describes the area as a region of regions. Lanier and Herman 1997 likewise examines a variety of building types and locations from throughout the southern portion of the region. Much of the scholarship on mid-Atlantic vernacular architecture in recent years has its roots at the University of Delaware. With this in mind, some works, such as Herman 1992, have focused on Delaware itself, using a very local example as a way to better understand the built environment more broadly.\n\nFalk, Cynthia G.

For the Chesapeake, studies have been driven largely by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation in Virginia and the St. Mary’s City Commission in Maryland. In both cases, the desire to interpret the early Chesapeake to a public audience has led to questions about why the built environment in Maryland and Virginia, where only a few 17th-century and early 18th-century buildings survive, is so different from that further north in New England, where extant early buildings are more prolific. A multidisciplinary group of scholars published “Impermanent Architecture in the Southern Colonies” in 1981 in Winterthur Portfolio and began offering an explanation by describing earthfast building techniques (construction directly on the ground or with wooden members placed in holes or trenches) and the reason for their use. The subject continued to be explored, bolstered by decades’ more fieldwork, in Carson and Lounsbury 2013. Carl Lounsbury, formerly of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, has been among the leading writers on the topic of southern architecture. In addition to the 2013 co-edited volume on the Chesapeake house, he has contributed to Architects and Builders of North Carolina (Bishir, et al. 1990), edited An Illustrated Glossary of Early Southern Architecture and Landscape (Lounsbury 1994), and authored a monograph on early Virginia courthouses (Lounsbury 2005). Camille Wells, who with Lounsbury was a founder of the Vernacular Architecture Forum, adds to the literature on southern colonial architecture with her volume Material Witness (Wells 2018), which addresses plantations in the 18th century as well as more recently as they have been interpreted for the public. Michael Ann Williams, a folklorist who places a strong emphasis on oral narrative, puts people at the center of her study of Appalachia, which also emphasizes the complete life cycle of its subject buildings. Williams 1991 emphasizes traditional approaches and ideas that inform more contemporary building practices and uses.\n\nBishir, Catherine, Charlotte Brown, Carl Lounsbury, and Ernest Wood III.

Since Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, New Orleans has garnered special attention in the field of vernacular architecture, in large measure because of the great loss and preservation issues the storm created. Verderber 2009, for example, documents the everyday built environment, much of which was damaged or lost as a result of the hurricane and calls for preservation and rebuilding. But even before Katrina, the Mississippi Delta’s history as a cosmopolitan port, influenced by French, Spanish, and English colonial regimes, made it a region unto itself. And the remarkable presence of the Mississippi River has provided a subject for those studying the relationship between land, water, and built form.

Wilson 1997 looks particularly at Santa Fe, New Mexico, with an eye to how the built environment has been used to create a past only partially born in reality. In turning her attention to California missions, Kryder-Reid 2016 likewise examines the public interpretation of the past with particular attention to the place of race in the heritage field. The diversity of groups that have called the southwest home, from Pueblo and Diné (Navajo) people, to Spanish and Mexican settlers, to Americans from the East Coast makes this a region ripe for the exploration of various building traditions.\n\nKryder-Reid, Elizabeth.

For the Caribbean, Berthelot and Gaumé 1982, a trilingual catalogue, marked the beginning of a movement to examine the everyday buildings that resulted from the colonial context of the West Indies. The recent move to embrace globalization, both past and present, has resulted in significant new works. For example, Nelson 2016 explores the architecture of the British Empire in Jamaica, and Edgerton 2001 examines colonial missions in Mexico. Both books focus on the past and are closely tied to studies of similar subjects and, therefore, buildings in the continental United States. Other works take a more contemporary approach; for example, Lopez 2015 examines the complex interchange of ideas and resources through remittances that flow from the United States to Mexico. Global studies, still grounded in particular places at particular times, have broken new ground in the field of vernacular architecture and likely demonstrate a trend that will only continue to grow.\n\nBerthelot, Jack, and Martine Gaumé.

One vein has led to the exploration of distinct, often remote, places where traditions of the past are still remembered if not enacted. Pocius 1991, for example, takes a folkloristic approach to the author’s own home place of Newfoundland, focusing on the community of Calvert. Mellin 2003, influenced by Pocius, provides a thorough examination of Tilting, an island community off the coast of Newfoundland. In both cases, fishing serves as a primary occupation, and therefore the authors address vernacular landscapes related to the water. Other scholars of the Canadian built environment have turned their attention to urban areas, particularly in the 20th century. Two studies of Toronto, The Ward (Loring, et al. 2015) and Unplanned Suburbs (Harris 1996), tackle the common North American phenomenon of suburbanization and urban renewal. Yet in each case the Canadian perspective offers a new angle. In Harris 1996, the focus is shifted from well planned, middle-class suburbs to the working-class periphery settlements of the early 20th century, which were characterized by a lack of regulation and planning. In The Ward, numerous authors work to provide a robust pre-urban renewal picture of this immigrant community.\n\nHarris, Richard. Unplanned Suburbs: Toronto’s American Tragedy, 1900–1950.

His analysis focuses on the working-class, self-built suburbs created outside Toronto, bringing light to a type of community that has escaped much attention anywhere in North America.\n\nFind this resource:\n\nGoogle Preview»\n\nWorldCat»\n\nLoring, John, Michael McClelland, Ellen Scheinberg, and Tatum Taylor, eds.

The differences between how white and black Virginians viewed the cultural landscape and built environment was the subject of Upton 1985, a seminal article on race and space. Vlach 1993 further documents the landscape of racialized slavery and the experience of enslaved people. Works like these have initiated reinterpretation for public audiences, particularly at historic sites that once facilitated and benefited from slave labor. While studies from the 1980s and 1990s often examine race through the lens of slavery in the American South, more recent works recognize the need to temporally move beyond the Civil War and/or geographically expand borders. Schein 2003, an essay in the edited volume dedicated to J. B. Jackson, raises issues of the “normative” and how racial discrimination has been embedded in the built environment. Upton 2015 returns to the topic of race to examine the building of monuments to commemorate the civil rights movement and African-American history. Other authors have taken a more international approach. Ginsburg 2011 examines domestic service in South Africa during the period of apartheid. And, Louis Nelson carefully reconstructs the experience of capture and enslavement along Africa’s Gold Coast under British rule in the 17th and 18th centuries. While much of the literature has focused on how space has been used to oppress and discriminate, there are hints that place and the experience of it can also be liberating, one of the major themes in the earlier literature on slavery. When scholars have returned to the subject of enslavement more recently, for example in two edited volumes Ellis and Ginsburg 2010 and Ellis and Ginsburg 2017, they have likewise emphasized the interrelationship between space and resistance, documented a diversity of experiences, and expanded geographic coverage.\n\nEllis, Clifton, and Rebecca Ginsburg, eds.

Religious spaces, of all places, provide the prefect avenue to explore how deep-seated convictions are physically manifest. And, religious buildings have the potential to embody difference as much as they do sameness, especially considering the religious plurality of North America. Studies of vernacular religious buildings have up until this time largely focused on Christian groups: Congregationalists, Anglicans, Catholics, and Mormons. Like other subfields within the study of vernacular architecture, the focus has been on the colonial East Coast with a few jaunts further afield. Upton 1986 offers a pioneering study on early Virginia’s Anglican parishes, demonstrating that church buildings can say as much about nonreligious affairs, such as social stratification, as they do about the sacred. In Edgerton 2001 the interactions between European Catholics and indigenous Mexican groups take priority and help the reader understand the form and decoration of conventos. For the Mormons, Carter 2014 shows the construction of settlements in Utah was about advancing both spiritual and secular concerns. Those who study religious buildings draw on a wide variety of sources. Benes 2012, for example, focuses on the earliest meeting houses in New England, the majority of which do not survive. Benes therefore has to turn to documentary and visual sources. Buggeln 2005 examines a slightly later period when New Englanders in Connecticut torn down their early buildings and replaced them with new edifices, many of which still dot the landscape. Here the surviving buildings, in addition to numerous written documents, help inform the study. In examining suburban churches of the 20th century, Buggeln is able to additionally add interviews to her source base for her 2015 volume. In using religious buildings to understand the culture of the people who used them, having access to the spoken or written word is an important adjunct to the buildings themselves. As scholars continue to probe the meaning of these types of spaces, incorporating more and different faith communities, as in the edited volume American Sanctuary (Nelson 2006), they will benefit from the use of such rich and varied source material.\n\nBenes, Peter.
