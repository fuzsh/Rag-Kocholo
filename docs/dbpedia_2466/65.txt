Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan, wife of John Comyn, 7th Earl of Buchan of the original creation Isabella was the daughter of Duncan MacDuff, Earl of Fife. She married John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, who took the side of the English during the Scottish Wars of Independence. Isabel, however, was a strong supporter of Robert the Bruce. She was betrayed to the English, whereupon Edward I of England sentenced her to be shut up in a cage. The following extract is taken from "The Terrific Register; or record of crimes, judgements, providences and calamities" [London 1825]:- 'In 1306, the Countess of Buchan, who had been extremely active in the cause of Bruce, and even placed the crown on his head, was, by the command of King Edward [I], shut up in a wooden cage in one of the towers of Berwick Castle; as was Mary, sister to Bruce, in the castle of Roxburgh. The order to the Chamberlain of Scotland, or his lieutenant in Berwick, for making the cage for the Countess of Buchan, was by writ of privy seal; by which he was directed to make in one of the turrets of Berwick upon Tweed, which he should find most convenient, a strong cage of lattice work, constructed with posts and bars, and well strengthened with iron. This cage was to be so constructed that the Countess might have therein necessary conveniences, proper care being taken that it did not lessen the security of her person; that the said Countess being put in this cage, should be so carefully guarded, that she should not by any means go out of it: that a woman or two of the town of Berwick, of unsuspected character, should be appointed to administer her food and drink, and attend her on other occasions; and that he should cause her to be so strictly guarded in the said cage, as not to be permitted to speak to any person, man or woman, of the Scottish nation, or any other, except the woman or women assigned to attend her, and her other guards. 'Matthew of Westminster, a contemporary writer, says, that the king declared, that as she did not strike with a sword, she should not die with the sword, but ordered her to be shut up in a habitation of stone and iron, shaped like a crown, and to be hung out at Berwick in the open air, for a spectacle and everlasting reproach, while living and dead, to all that passed by.' Isabella was imprisoned in the cage for four years, and then transferred to a Carmelite friary. He subsequent fate is uncertain, but she probably died about 1314. David Stuart Erskine, 13th Earl of Buchan The following article was published in 'The Washington Post' of 9 December 1898:- ''Some considerable time is likely to elapse before the eldest son of the old Earl of Buchan .. is permitted to assume full-fledged possession of the peerage, or to take part in those elections of Scotch representative Peers which take place in the Palace of Holyrood at Edinburgh at the outset of each new Parliament. For the old Earl, who was a most eccentric and cranky individual, distinguished himself some six or seven years ago by indicting a remarkable letter to the London newspapers, announcing that he had appealed to the committee of privileges of the House of Lords to take note of the fact that his first marriage to the mother of his eldest son was not legal. 'The late Lord Buchan, there is every reason to believe, made these allegations from a feeling of revenge, being exceedingly embittered against his son because of the latter having refused to avert his bankruptcy a short time previously. The old Lord spent nearly his entire life in hot water and in the early portion of his career earned a precarious livelihood as a professional jockey. His first wife found life so unbearable that she left him, and died when her eldest boy was twenty-five years of age. A few months afterward Lord Buchan married again, this time a widow. But the match was not a happy one, and she soon parted from him. He likewise figured as co-respondent in a couple of divorce cases, and what with these and ridiculous lawsuits which he was constantly bringing against people he managed to keep his name pretty well before the public. 'About twenty years ago [actually in 1872] he surrendered the whole of his heavily-mortgaged estates to his eldest son, Lord Cardross, who had some money of his own by his mother and through his wife, in consideration of Lord Cardross paying his debts and settling upon him an annuity [of £500 p.a.]. Subsequently, oil was discovered on the estates which, consequently, largely increased in value, whereupon the old Earl regretted his bargain, and tried to get them back again. Failing in this, he went in for all sorts of extravagance, largely exceeding his annuity. He not only went to the extent of indorsing other people's notes, but actually, in spite of his age, got himself heavily mulcted in damages as a co-respondent in a divorce case, and then borrowed money at extravagant interest from the notorious money-lender, Jay, in London, in order to meet this liability. 'Small wonder if his eldest son, who had never forgotten or forgiven the manner in which his mother had been maltreated by the old Earl, permitted his father to be made a bankrupt [in 1894] rather than to pay his debts [£388] afresh. It was in consequence of this that the Earl wrote the letter .insisting that his first marriage to the mother of his eldest son was illegal, and that Lord Cardross was therefore illegitimate. 'The Lords of Buchan ..have always been eccentric. The eleventh Earl of Buchan, for instance, when appointed by Prime Minister Pitt as Secretary to the British Embassy in Spain, calmly declined to proceed to Madrid because the Ambassador, Sir James Gray, was a person of too low social rank and too plebeian ancestry.' The author of this article adds, as a delightful postscript, that 'the new Earl of Buchan, until now known as Lord Cardross, is celebrated as possessing the smallest head in point of size of any man in London.' The Buckhurst Peerage remainder From the "London Gazette" of 26 April 1864 (issue 22848, page 2280):- "The Queen has been pleased to direct letters patent to be passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, granting the dignity of a Baroness unto Elizabeth, Countess De La Warr, by the name, style, and title of Baroness Buckhurst, in the county of Sussex, during her life, with remainder after her decease, of the dignity of Baron Buckhurst, of Buckhurst, in the county of Sussex, unto the Honourable Reginald Windsor Sackville West, now now second surviving son of the said Elizabeth, Countess De La Warr, and the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten, with other remainders over." The other remainders referred to were that failing the heirs male of Reginald Windsor Sackville West, a special remainder to her 3rd, 4th, and 5th surviving sons by her husband in like manner respectively; and with a proviso that if any person taking under these letters patent "shall succeed to the Earldom of De la Warr, and there shall upon, or at any time after, the occurrence of such an event be any younger son or any heir male of the body of any such other son, then then and so often as the same shall happen the succession to the Honours and dignities thereby created shall devolve upon the son of the said Elizabeth, Countess De la Warr, or the heir who would next be entitled to succeed to the said dignity of Baron Buckhurst, if the person so succeeding to the Earldom of De la Warr was dead without issue male." That is to say that, following the death of Baroness Buckhurst, the peerage would descend to her second surviving son and the heirs male of his body, and contained a proviso that, in the event of such second son becoming Earl de la Warr, the peerage would then devolve upon her next youngest son. This remainder was designed so as to attempt to ensure that the barony of Buckhurst would 'jump' to an heir who was not the direct heir to the earldom of de la Warr, but what it failed to do was to take into account the possibility that the barony might jump from one holder to another during the lifetime of the then current Earl de la Warr, with the result that the earldom became inherited by persons nearer and nearer in blood to the holder of the barony. At the time of the creation of this peerage, Baroness Buckhurst had five surviving sons. The eldest surviving son, Charles, inherited the Earldom of de la Warr on the death of his father in 1869. On the death of his mother in January 1870, the Barony of Buckhurst was inherited by Charles's next brother, Reginald, since he was the second surviving son of the Baroness. When the 6th Earl de la Warr died in 1873, the earldom was inherited by his next brother, Reginald, who had previously inherited the barony of Buckhurst. Under the remainder to the peerage, it would seem that, when Reginald succeeded to the earldom, the barony should then have passed to the next youngest son, Mortimer. Mortimer claimed the barony of Buckhurst under the terms of the remainder, but Reginald argued that the Crown did not have the power to divest him of an hereditary dignity he had once enjoyed. The case was heard by the House of Lords Committee for Privileges in July 1876. It was held that the proviso outlined above was incapable of operating so as to give the barony to Mortimer. Reginald, having succeeded to the barony, could not have it taken away from him and given to another. The Committee found that, if the object of the proviso was to prevent the dignity of Earl de la Warr and Baron Buckhurst being held together by the same person, then the Crown had no power to grant a dignity with such a shifting and transferrable quality. They were therefore of the opinion that the barony of Buckhurst, having been inherited by Reginald, did not transfer to Mortimer once Reginald had succeeded to the earldom of de la Warr. As a result, the barony of Buckhurst has remained since that time as a subsidiary title of the Earls de la Warr. Mortimer, however, did not have to endure his disappointment for very long, as less than three months later, he was created Baron Sackville as a consolation prize. For another example of a 'jumping' remainder, see the earldom of Selkirk. Augustus Charles Hobart ["Hobart Pasha"], 3rd son of the 6th Earl of Buckinghamshire The following biography of Hobart Pasha appeared in the October 1955 issue of the Australian monthly magazine "Parade":- 'A rocket, soaring high in the darkness, threw a glow over the Danube one moonless night in April, 1877, revealing a tiny Turkish gunboat slipping like a phantom down the broad surface of the river. War had just flared between Turkey and Russia. The river was the frontier between opposing armies. With shots hurling spouts of water all round it, the venomous little craft steamed on to the safety of the open waters of the Black Sea. On the bridge was the defiant bearded figure of Hobart Pasha, rebellious son of an English earl, whose family gave its name to the thriving city of Hobart, in Tasmania. 'Hobart Pasha, Admiral of the Sultan's fleet, was one of the most astonishing sailors of fortune of the 19th century. The Hobart family had been producing wealthy and sober English squires for centuries, when the stormy petrel Augustus Charles Hobart was born third son of the sixth Earl of Buckinghamshire, at Walton, Leicestershire, on April Fool's Day, 1822. He was the dunce of his school, and, at the tender age of 14, was shipped to sea as midshipman in the 18-gun frigate, Rover. 'His early experiences bred a hatred of cast-iron navy discipline. Hobart's first captain was a sadistic bully who flogged his steward because the pea-soup was lukewarm, and once had his entire boat's crew lashed because they kept him waiting five minutes on Devonport's pier-head. Hobart left the ship after one voyage to study at the Naval College. In 1842 he was lieutenant in the squadron cruising off South America. The squadron's task was to hunt slave traders in the South Atlantic. Scores of fast sailing ships, their holds crammed with half-starved negroes, ferried the wretched slaves from Africa to Brazil, the Argentine and Central America. 'Young Augustus Hobart became feared as the most daring officer in the anti-slavery service. Cutlass in hand, he led his boat crews into uncharted inlets on the South American coast, forcing the slavers to burn, abandon or run their ships aground. Hobart's gallantry was as notorious ashore as afloat. At a ball in Buenos Aires he fell in love with a 16-years-old Spanish beauty, eloped with her to a country estate, where they were pursued and caught by her furious parents. At Rio de Janeiro, Hobart acted as second to a fellow-officer who killed in a pistol duel a Brazilian rival for the hand of another senorita. In British Guiana he landed in more serious trouble. Complaining that life in Demerara, the capital, was "so damned, dismally dull," he fell in love with the Governor's daughter. He challenged her official suitor to a duel by flinging a pack of cards in his face and shot him through the leg. The Governor kept his daughter prisoner in her room, and angrily demanded that Hobart be sent back to Britain under arrest. Hobart had to leave his squadron in disgrace. 'Back in London, the youthful Earl's son found his anti-slaving triumphs had made him a popular hero. Young Queen Victoria read of his exploits and had him transferred to the Royal Yacht where he served for a year. Hobart, however, was itching for more active service than piloting royalty. After serving at Malta and in the North Sea, he had his chance with the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854. He was given command of a ship in the Baltic Fleet, which was designed to batter its way past the great fort of Kronstadt into the harbour of St. Petersburg. 'The expedition, led by the timid Admiral [Sir Charles] Napier, was a fiasco. The fleet scurried off from Kronstadt after firing a few salvoes, and contented itself with leisurely shelling Helsinki and other ports in the Gulf of Finland. Hobart led a daring raid of small ships on the Åland Islands [during this campaign, a young sailor named Charles Davis Lucas threw a live enemy shell overboard before it could explode, a deed for which he was awarded the first ever Victoria Cross.] 'Peace found Hobart discontented by slow promotion and the "spit-and-polish" routine of navy life. When, in 1862, he gained the rank of captain, he asked to be placed on the navy reserve on half pay. Adventure was beckoning from across the Atlantic. The Northern and Southern States of America were locked in bloody civil war. From the Chesapeake to New Orleans, Abraham Lincoln's Northern navy had proclaimed a blockade of the Southern coasts. 'Every article on which the South depended had to run the gauntlet of the blockade - from muskets and gunpowder for the grey-clad armies to fashions for the Southern Belles. Southern cotton to pay for the imports was piling up on the quays of Charleston and Savannah. Nassau, in the British Bahamas, was the headquarters of the blockade runners. Here, in the booming town thronged with rich merchants, Yankee spies, Southern agents and escaped slaves, they fitted out the fast ships that darted in and out of the Southern ports under the noses of the Northern cruisers. 'To Nassau came Captain Augustus Hobart R.N. (retd.), bringing with him a handpicked crew and the 400-tons steamer Don, chartered in Liverpool, and the fastest ship on the American coast. 'In her holds was a strange but profitable cargo. It comprised 1000 pairs of women's corsets, bought in Glasgow for 1s 1d each and sold in Charleston, South Carolina for 12s each. There were crates of toothbrushes, "Cockle's antibilious pills," blankets, shoes and hardware - none of which brought a profit of less than 700 per cent. In return, Hobart and other blockade-runners bought cotton in the Southern ports for 3d a lb., and sold it to the Lancashire spinning mills for 2s 6d. 'Often Hobart eluded capture by daredevil navigation. Twice he tried to steam up-river to Savannah, Georgia, where £50,000 worth of cotton was piled up. The first time, he passed enemy forts only to run full speed into treacherous shoals and sandbanks. Three days later he made another attempt. This time he almost collided with a waiting Northern cruiser and had to run for the Bahamas. For two days the ships raced through a hurricane. When the Don's coal was exhausted, Hobart and his crew hacked cabin fittings, spars, oars and hemp cable to feed the furnaces. The Don limped into the safety of Nassau with her engines dying only a few hundred yards ahead of the enemy cruiser. 'A year later Hobart was back in England. His crew was riddled with yellow fever. The Southern cause was collapsing. General Sherman's famous march had cut the Confederate states in half. Though Hobart had salted away a handsome fortune, he was soon wandering restlessly again. In 1867, he set out on a European tour, during which he visited Constantinople with a letter of introduction to Fuad Pasha, Grand Vizier of Turkey. It was the turning point of his life. 'The island of Crete, long groaning under Turkish oppression, was wracked by rebellion, aided and supplied by sympathisers in Greece. Hobart told the distracted Grand Vizier: "Give me a command in the Turkish fleet and I'll break the revolt in a month." Hobart got the job. Hoisting his flag on an ancient wooden frigate, he arrived off Suda Bay and took command of a Turkish squadron of six ironclads. With them he hunted the ships running arms from Greece. His blockade was so effective that, within a month, the starving and unarmed Cretan rebels swarmed from the mountains to surrender. Defying international law, Hobart chased the blockade runners right into Greek harbours, ignoring the Grand Vizier's frightened protests that he would provoke war with Greece. 'His outrageous actions staggered the British Admiralty. As a Reserve List officer, he was peremptorily ordered to return to Britain, or his name would be erased from the Navy List. Hobart telegraphed the Admiralty: "Erase and be damned." The name of Captain Hobart promptly disappeared from the rolls. He delighted Sultan of Turkey, however, raised Hobart to the rank of Pasha and "Naval Adviser." Within a few years he was an Admiral, Chief of Staff of the Turkish Navy, and special A.D.C. to the Sultan himself. 'With fiery energy, he reorganised the Sultan's decrepit navy. He founded a naval college and gunnery school and ordered new ships from British yards. To the corrupt bureaucrats of Constantinople, the bearded Briton was a strange demon of honesty, efficiency and hard work. They hated him and intrigued ceaselessly to oust him from the Sultan's favour. Gradually the value of his work filtered through to Whitehall. In 1874, the Foreign Secretary, Lord Derby Whitehall. In 1874, the Foreign Secretary, Lord Derby, asked the Admiralty to restore Hobart's name to the Navy List "as a matter of Imperial policy." 'Three years later in 1877, the long-smouldering war between Russia and Turkey in the Balkans burst into open flame. The Turkish army occupied Bulgaria; the Russians marched into Romania and threatened to sweep over the Danube. Hobart Pasha was at Galatz, 100 miles upstream from the Black Sea mouth of the Danube, when war broke out. He had been sent there to reorganise the feeble Turkish river defences. He was at once recalled to take personal command of the fleet. The war ended in Turkish defeat on land. Hobart could do nothing to redress the balance on sea for the Russian Admiral refused to leave Odessa and risk battle with him. The scapegrace son of English earls however, still dreamed of a crushing counter-attack on Russia with Britain as an ally. He visited London in 1880 and tried to open negotiations with Whitehall. Gladstone's Government, stirred by the Turkish atrocities in Armenia, abruptly rejected his proposals. For the second time, Hobart's name was struck off the Navy List. It was not restored till the year of his death. 'In 1881 Hobart was appointed Marshal of the Turkish Empire - the first Christian ever to hold the position. He continued to work untiringly for his cherished plan for a British alliance, but his health was failing rapidly. He spent the winter of 1885-6 on the French Riviera, and died on the Henry Seymour Berry, 1st and only Baron Buckland subsequent inquest appeared in "The Scotsman" on 25 May 1928:- 'A verdict of accidental death was returned yesterday at the inquest on Lord Buckland, the Welsh Peer, who was killed on Wednesday morning when he came into collision with a telephone post while out riding with his groom. 'Harry J. Weaver, an elderly stud groom, said Lord Buckland started out on his usual morning gallop over the estate. "Lord Buckland was talking to me about his horses as we went along. We were then galloping round a meadow. I had replied to a question. Lord Buckland was looking over his shoulder at me, and said - "What's that?" At that moment I noticed that his mare was making straight for the telephone post, and I called out an once, "Mind the pole, my Lord." The next thing that happened was that the mare swerved. My master seemed to lose his balance, and he collided head first with the post. He was hurled to the ground, and the mare galloped onwards. I rode up to him and dismounted. Lord Buckland was lying motionless on his back." 'The Coroner - Was he conscious? - He never breathed a word, and made no movement. He seemed to have died instantly. I went to loosen his collar, but I saw that he was dead. 'The Coroner - Was there anything peculiar about the mare? - No. She was perfectly quiet, and Lord Buckland had her under perfect control. 'Was Lord Buckland an experienced horseman? - Yes. 'Weaver said the accident was due to the fact that Lord Buckland had turned his head over his shoulder, and did not see the telephone post in his path. 'A doctor said death, which must have been instantaneous, was caused by a compound fracture of the skull.' Angela Georgina Burdett-Coutts, Baroness Burdett-Coutts The activity commonly known as stalking first came to the attention of the general public during the 1980s when a series of well-known celebrities suddenly found themselves the target of one or more adoring, but obsessed, fans. In general terms, stalking involves one person's obsessive behaviour toward another person, motivated by either intense affection or intense hatred. Stalkers exhibit an irrational mania to pursue their quarry and, in extreme cases, the stalker's behaviour may turn to violence, generally without warning or apparent reason. Stalking can be a terrifying experience for victims, leading to psychological trauma and possible physical harm. The subject of stalking has been the central theme of a number of famous films and books, including 'The Phantom of the Opera', 'Fatal Attraction', 'Les Miserables' and 'The Cable Guy.' In England, the act of stalking was criminalised in 1997 by the Protection from Harassment Act. Notwithstanding the apparent rise in stalking in recent years, stalking has been practised for centuries, one of its earlier victims being Angela Georgina Burdett-Coutts, later Baroness Burdett-Coutts. In 1837, at the age of 23, Angela became the wealthiest woman in England when she inherited the estate of her grandfather. Not surprisingly, she became a notable subject of public curiosity, and received numerous offers of marriage. Unfortunately for Angela, one particular man went further. Richard Dunn was a lawyer who, around 1838, became infatuated with Angela who, at the time, was single and had no knowledge of or interest in Dunn. He initially wrote to Angela a letter in which the language used was later described in court as 'strange.' Angela simply threw the letters out, on the basis that they appeared to have been written by someone who was apparently insane. Over the next two years, Dunn escalated his campaign; he followed Angela whenever she left her house, he attempted to commence conversations with her and continually wrote letters to her. Finally, in June 1840, Angela took action against Dunn, charging him with breach of the peace. Dunn was forced to enter into a £500 surety to keep the peace and stay away from Angela. However, Dunn continued unabashed. He wrote further letters and started to follow her again. A second surety was sought and obtained, but this time Dunn became violent and had to be restrained by court officials. He was sent to prison, but was later released because of a defect in the committal warrant. Again, he harassed Angela, accosting her while out walking. A servant was summoned to protect her and Dunn followed her to the house where she had taken refuge. The police were called in and Dunn was arrested, but to no avail, as Dunn immediately sought a writ of habeas corpus. In a most unjust decision, Dunn's application was successful. The court refused to draw any inferences from the evidence presented to it. Their argument was that the evidence in the case did not allege any threats against Angela and that it was not their role to infer such a threat. This is equivalent to saying that, because Dunn had not physically threatened Angela, nothing could be done until he did so, surely a remarkably short-sighted interpretation of the law. In June 1846, Dunn was charged with perjury, based on an alleged false affidavit made in the Court of Bankruptcy by Dunn which stated that Angela Burdett-Coutts owed Dunn £100,000. In February 1847, Dunn was found guilty and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. The special remainder to the Barony of Burton From the "London Gazette" of 30 November 1897 (issue 26915, page 7172):- "The Queen has been pleased to direct Letters Patent to be passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, granting the dignity of a Baron of the said United Kingdom unto Michael Arthur, Baron Burton, and the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten, by the name, style, and title of Baron Burton, of Burton-on-Trent and of Rangemore, both in the county of Stafford, to hold to him and the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten; and, in default of such issue male, to hold the name, style, and title of Baroness Burton, of Burton-on- Trent and of Rangemore, to Nellie Lisa Baillie, wife of James Evan Bruce Baillie, of Dochfour, in the county of Inverness, Esquire, only daughter of the said Michael Arthur, Baron Burton, and after her decease to hold the name, style, and title of Baron Burton, of Burton-on-Trent and of Rangemoor aforesaid, to, the heirs male lawfully begotten of the body of the said Nellie Lisa Baillie." William Byron, 5th Baron Byron Byron was known as 'the Wicked Lord' or 'Devil Byron.' In the mid-1760s, when aged in his early 40s, Byron began to spiral downwards into constant scandal and eventual madness. On 26 January 1765, after an argument as to the best method to preserve game, Byron killed his cousin, William Chaworth, in a duel which took place at the Star and Garter Tavern in Pall Mall in London. Byron and Chaworth duelled with swords in an empty and dimly-lit room at the tavern, where Byron ran his sword through Chaworth's stomach, causing Chaworth's death the next day. Byron was subsequently tried by his peers on 16 and 17 April 1765 and found guilty of manslaughter 'and as, by an old statute, peers are, in all cases where [benefit of] clergy is allowed, to be dismissed without burning in the hand, loss of inheritance, or corruption of blood, his Lordship was immediately dismissed on paying his fees.' For a full account of the duel, see 'The Annual Register for 1765' on pages 208-212. After this let-off, Byron became increasingly eccentric. On one occasion, while out driving, he is reported to have became embroiled in an argument with his coachman. The story goes that Byron shot him and took over the reins himself. The event which appears to have finally tipped Byron over the edge of insanity was the elopement of his son, also William, with his cousin Juliana, daughter of Lord Byron's younger brother, Admiral John Byron. The 5th Baron felt that the marriage of the cousins would produce insane children and, as a result, he strongly opposed the marriage. When his son defied his wishes, the 5th Baron set out to ruin his son's inheritance; he laid waste to his property, let his house fall into disrepair, cut down all the timber on the property and killed all * and when his grandson was killed in Corsica in 1794, the 5th Baron's legacy of poverty was inherited by the eventual 6th Baron, the famous poet Lord Byron. The Byron family lived at Newstead Abbey, near Nottingham. According to local tradition, the owner of Newstead Abbey was cursed, in that he would never have a son to inherit the property. The tradition states that the 5th Baron, while carrying out some building operations at Newstead Abbey, happened to come upon the remains of one of the former Abbots of the Abbey. He permitted the Abbot's bones to be re-interred, apart from the skull, which he had converted into a drinking-cup. As a result, a curse was passed upon him to the effect that he would die without leaving any male issue to inherit the estate, and it was further added that, as long as the skull remained unburied, there would never be any direct male heir to inherit Newstead Abbey. The 5th Baron's son and grandson both predeceased him and Newstead Abbey passed to the poet and distant relative, the 6th Baron Byron. In November 1817, the 6th Baron sold Newstead Abbey to Thomas Wildman, who died childless in 1859. The property was then sold to William Frederick Webb, who, shortly after taking possession of the property, found the drinking-cup in a silversmith's shop in London. Being aware of the story of the curse, he immediately purchased the cup and caused it to be reverently re-interred within the precincts of the Abbey. It is interesting to note that, prior to purchasing the Abbey, Webb had become the father of four daughters and that it was only after the cup had been re-interred that his two sons were born.
