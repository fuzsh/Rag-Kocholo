Cisco Systems Inc. is an American multinational tech giant, which designs and sells technologies that power the internet. The Company integrates platforms across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud.

Through its fully owned Israeli subsidiaries, Cisco Systems has a broad base of complicity with Israel’s occupation economy, predominantly through the provision of services to the Israeli military.

Services to the Israeli Military

In October 2023, Cisco Systems Israel supported the development of the digital platform “Israel Rises” of the Home Front Command, a branch of the Israeli military.

Also in October 2023, amid the attack on Gaza, the company gave grants to its employees who were on reserve duty in the Israeli Military.

Unified Communication Systems

Cisco provides the Israeli military with Cisco Unified Communications, an IP-based communications system that integrates voice, video, data, and mobility products and applications.

In March 2020, Cisco Systems began laying tens of Unified Communication systems for the Israeli military, expected to reach hundreds of systems. The unified network centralizes the transfer of video, voice, and data between different Israeli military units. Cisco’s Unified Communication system serves to accelerate the Israeli military’s response timeframe.

David’s Citadel – underground ICT Data Center

Cisco Systems’ computing and communication systems as well as cyber security and load balancing systems were integrated into the Israeli military’s biggest ICT underground data center in the Naqab called David’s Citadel, completed in 2020. The Data Center cost reached NIS 1.6 billion.

The Military server farm has a storage capacity that’s 10,000 more than the standard computer and integrates 300 of the Israeli military’s surveillance, intelligence, and combat units’ ICT data systems in one base. Centralizing Israel’s ICT data serves to bolster the capacity of Israel’s intelligence and combat military units.

The center is part of the Israeli military’s strive to centralize data and its “move to the south” plan launched in 2011. The plan involved the relocation of Israeli military bases to the Naqab as part of Israel’s broader strive to Judaize the Naqab.

Joint projects with the military

In May 2022, it was reported that Cisco engineers together with Israeli soldiers of the ICT Unit developed application for use by civil society organizations which work with the military.

According to the Cisco’s VP of technology, “The connection between the technology units in the Israeli military and the high-tech companies in Israel is a significant anchor in the accuracy and advanced development of technologies that serve the security of the state and the bodies responsible for it… The sight of officers in uniforms sitting next to our engineers and developing technological solutions together is very natural to us, but still exciting.”

Servers

In 2017, Cisco Systems won a tender to supply the Israeli military with servers for the duration of three years with the possibility of extension, for a total amount of NIS 1 billion. The servers were to be integrated by the Israeli company Bynet Data Communications Ltd. The tender was funded by US foreign aid provided by the United States to Israel.

Services to settlements

In February 2019, the Ministry for the Development of the Negev and the Galilee allocated NIS 90 million for the 'Klika' project, in cooperation with Cisco Systems, for the launch of 45 technological hubs, all of which will be equipped with Cisco communication technology. By September 2023, seven of the 36 hubs that have been opened are located on occupied territory. Five hubs are located in the occupied West Bank, in the settlements of Modi’in Illit, Beitar Illit, Kiryat Arba, Itamar, and Sha’ar Binyamin Industrial Zone. Two additional hubs are located in the occupied Syrian Golan – one at the Ha’Emir junction, between the settlement of Sha’al and Odem, and the second in the settlement of Katzrin.

Technological Hubs in the Naqab

As of September 2023, eleven Cisco technology-equipped hubs have been opened in the Naqab, of which two are located in the Palestinian Bedouin towns of Hura and Rahat.

These hubs form part of the Israeli government’s industrialization and resettlement plan which strives to create jobs in the Naqab, in the hope of drawing Jewish Israelis to settle in the region, while concentrating its Palestinian communities into ghettoized residential areas.

Services and Equipment to the Israeli police

In August 2022, the Technology Department of the Israeli police purchased communication equipment called “Nituv” (Routing) including licensing and software manufactured by Cisco through the seller, Matrix Network Net Ltd.

According to a response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request submitted by Who Profits to the Israeli Police, between the years 2020 and 2021 the Israeli police purchased Cisco Systems equipment and software worth NIS 4,060,533 million.

Enhancing surveillance in Jerusalem

In 2017, Cisco and the Jerusalem Municipality signed a memorandum of understanding for cooperation between the municipality and the company to make Jerusalem the first smart city in Israel.

In the same year, Cisco installed communication equipment and CCTVs for the Jerusalem municipality as part of a pilot project for the development of Smart City technology in the west of the city.

The Smart City project is part of Israel's surveillance apparatus in Jerusalem, which is aimed mainly at the Palestinian residents of the city. For more on surveillance in occupied East Jerusalem see Who Profits report “Big Brother” in Jerusalem’s Old City.
