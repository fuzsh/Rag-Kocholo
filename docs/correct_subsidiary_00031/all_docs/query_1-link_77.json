        "text": "Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Can you share with us the ‘backstory” of how you decided to pursue this career path in AI?\n\nI was born and raised in Bulgaria, and since a young age, I’ve had a passion for technology. At around 10 years old, I began working with electronics and building various devices for generating sounds, controlling lights, and short-distance radio communication with my friends. For me, it was really about finding a way to develop tech that could enhance human capabilities. In fact, I considered it my “superpower” as a kid.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I was a member of a youth organization that specialized in technology development, and the team that I was on was tasked to build a robot. That robot turned into a 5-foot tall, “intelligent” piece of technology — it talked, listened, and moved by itself. We could teach the robot where to go and what to say all through automation, and it was even shown at exhibitions. This project only fueled my love for tech and working on fascinating projects.\n\nMy passion for building and tinkering stayed with me throughout my entire career. Eventually, I focused on software and was part of multiple teams at startups and large organizations building solutions for telecom, cloud, insurance, collaboration, autonomous driving, and other industries at multiple roles throughout the whole technology stack. Regardless of the technology, I was working on at the moment or the company I was at, I tried to stay up to speed with AI, which always fascinated me. While AI was introduced in the 1950s, it went through multiple ups and downs and was not very applicable in real-life applications. The down periods were even referred to as “AI winters,” when the tech was not as popular and was under-researched, but then it would be revived again. Over the last 5–6 years, AI has been booming, fueled by the abundance of data and computing power. With the main goal of AI being to simulate, augment, and enhance human capabilities, I was drawn back to the technology, focusing on practical AI and how to take advantage of the latest AI technology to create impactful solutions.\n\nWhat lessons can others learn from your story?\n\nThrough the evolving AI landscape, it’s absolutely critical that engineers and technology professionals be ready to learn and to embrace change. These tools accelerate at a rapid rate and what was once a brand-new type of technology will soon be outdated. Because of this, we must always be learning and veer away from complacency. While those AI winters were once very real, we saw the popularity of the technology pick up in just a matter of years. Being diligent about what’s next and prepared to respond will help us be the most impactful in our work and allow us to build the most helpful solutions possible.\n\nCan you tell our readers about the most interesting projects you are working on now?\n\nMy current focus is applying AI technology to help our customers discover, manage and use the data they have stored on Quantum appliances and beyond. Our customers keep exabytes of unstructured data, mostly videos, images, and documents which are stored on the Quantum StorNext filesystem, Quantum ActiveScale object store, and Quantum tape libraries. This is a huge amount of extremely valuable data, which currently is very hard to use. The content could be motion pictures, corporate videos, or medical images.\n\nThe speed of new media creation is also accelerating. We are building a platform that enables the user to discover the content of the data, what is recorded as video, images, objects, situations, people, etc., and who said what and when. We also discover specific situations, like when there was a goal or a penalty in a 90-minute soccer game. We are annotating all of this information and creating metadata included in our Media Asset Management system, which allows users to quickly find what they are looking for and even allows the system to automatically find areas of interest and create a summary or highlight of the content. This is applicable in many industries starting with M&E, but also hospital patient monitoring or video surveillance.\n\nBy taking advantage of the latest AI advancements in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, etc., we are building a highly scalable platform that could be deployed on the cloud or in the data center and allows data discovery and indexing regardless of where the data is stored. The number of capabilitiesis endless, and we are balancing our long-term vision and the everyday demands we are seeing from our customers and delivering specific features based on their requests. It is always very exciting to work closely with the end users to clearly understand their challenges and provide the appropriate solutions. Building a highly scalable, flexible, extensible AI/ML platform where our or third-party AI models could be deployed and used by our customers is what keeps me very busy.\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\n\nI’m very fortunate to have a family that has supported me throughout my entire career. My parents are in the medical field, so they understand the drive it takes to be successful in the sciences. At an early age, they nurtured my passion for technology by finding and granting me access to some of the best technology available — powerful computer, labs, etc. — so I could explore my passions. My brother is in life sciences and has helped teach me about the scientific process and problem solving. Without this support system at home, I would not have been able to grow my knowledge and further my education, and for that, I am forever grateful.\n\nBut outside of the house, I stayed in touch with the team I built that robot with during my youth. We’ve exchanged ideas, brainstormed, and problem solved to help each other further in our careers and learn more about our fields. We share a passion for what we do and have been constantly cheering each other on through both successful and trying times in our professional lives. Having that kind of support group has been invaluable.\n\nWhat are the 5 things that most excite you about the AI industry? Why?\n\nReal-life application. In recent years, we’ve truly seen how AI can impact the real word and the benefits that it’s bringing. Innovations like self-driving cars, healthcare diagnostics, software coding, and more have truly been exciting to witness, and we can only hope that these benefits will continue in the future with even stronger use cases.\n\nHuman augmentation. Time is of the essence, and we all feel pressed for it. But AI is helping humans to focus their efforts where they thrive, allowing AI to complete more mundane or tedious yet necessary tasks, including office work — document analysis, for example. Ultimately, amid the hype of the technology, we have seemingly overestimated what AI can do in some industries but have underestimated what it can do for administrative tasks in office work.\n\nHuman-computer interface. For years, we’ve had to take the time to learn and understand computers and their applications. But AI is changing that through natural language processing. For instance, today, if you want to work with a computer program or application you hadn’t used before, you would either need to take a class to understand its complexities or hire a specialist to do it for you. In the future, we’ll be able to tell the program what we want, and it will listen and complete the tasks automatically.\n\nCollaborative community. I love that the AI community is full of knowledge sharing and collaboration across universities and institutions — it’s never a closed-door policy. AI professionals constantly have access to thousands of articles and pieces of research, sharing open-source and AI models. This allows for quick advancements and effective collaboration across the community.\n\nEndless possibilities. Due to the increased interest and demand in AI technology, there recently have been massive investments from various sources, including venture capital firms. There is a buzz around what’s possible through AI, and people are excited to see it come to fruition.\n\nWhat are the 3 things that concern you about the AI industry? Why?\n\nThe technology getting into the wrong hands. This technology is extremely powerful, and when it’s fallen into the wrong hands, it can be used to manipulate people. Take cyberattacks, for example. As the technology grows and more people learn how to use it, this will be a negative side effect that we will have to overcome.\n\nExpectations. While it’s exciting to think of the possibilities that come with AI, we also have to understand that many of these advancements are years away. The general public has to keep their expectations reasonable about what’s to come and when it’s coming.\n\nLack of Maturity. We should always keep in mind that AI is still being figured out. These developments are still in their infancy in many cases.\n\nAs you know, there is an ongoing debate between prominent scientists, (personified as a debate between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg,) about whether advanced AI has the future potential to pose a danger to humanity. What is your position about this? What can be done to prevent such concerns from materializing? And what can be done to assure the public that there is nothing to be concerned about?\n\nAs mentioned, AI is an extremely powerful technology, and as such, it could certainly cause potential danger to humanity. Just like with sensitive areas like nuclear energy, pharmaceuticals, or food, there are regulations that must be considered. While we are still probably around five years out from any serious potential danger, we must tread lightly and take the necessary steps to put controls in place.\n\nHow have you used your success to bring goodness to the world? Can you share a story?\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve been proud to build impactful solutions that help save time, improve productivity, and make life better for people overall. Outside of work, I take time to mentor and help the new generation of engineers learn from my experience and share the knowledge I have collected to help them pave a successful path forward in the field of technology and AI.\n\nAs you know, there are not that many women in your industry. Can you advise what is needed to engage more women into the AI industry?\n\nHaving grown up in Europe, I have seen that there are regional differences in the STEM communities. For example, my engineering programs were always a near-even divide between men and women; yet, in the United States, that is not the case. The passion of STEM starts at a young age, and we must foster the creativity and curiosity that we see across the entire population, introducing the same scientific and problem-solving skills to the girls, just as we do the boys. Ultimately, this is a cultural issue that we need to address in the American education system early on.\n\nWhat is your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share a story of how that had relevance to your own life?\n\nI have two quotes that have stuck with me throughout my entire career — the first being, “The only constant in life is change”. I mentioned this earlier, but the field of technology is far from static. It’s consistently evolving and what was “state of the art” just ten years ago was already obsolete five short years later.\n\nTo help address this, my other life lesson quote is, “Learning is a lifelong endeavor”. To have an impact and be relevant in tech, we must be ready to learn and change quickly. I continue my education year-over-year to better address the needs of the industry and create solutions that are the most impactful.\n\nIf you could start a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger.\n\nWhile I wouldn’t start a movement per se, I would love to fuel the desire for further education around arts and sciences. Education will only change our approach to life completely, in the best way possible. Supporting education brings positive impact and continued growth across around the globe. I’m a firm believer in free, accessible education for all, and we are beginning to see this happening with online school systems and internet access putting valuable teaching materials at our fingertips.\n\nFurther, I would love for the world to celebrate and promote scientific virtues and education now more than ever. We’re taught early on that money is power, but in my opinion, knowledge is what’s powerful. It’s about what you’ve learned and shared that makes the most impact in our lifetime.\n\nHow can our readers further follow your work online?\n\nFor more, readers can follow me on Linkedin and on the Quantum blog."
