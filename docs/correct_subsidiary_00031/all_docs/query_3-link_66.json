        "text": "Cisco intends to acquire the service fulfillment software assets and associated employees from the UK subsidiary (formerly Axiom Systems) of parent company Comptel Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, Cisco will pay approximately $31 million in cash for the acquisition of AXIOSS software and talent.\n\nCisco will acquire the AXIOSS software suite, a fulfillment platform that strengthens the Cisco service provider management offering by automating ordering and fulfillment. The software will provide management capabilities for network services across Ciscoâ€™s five company priorities, and it will enhance Cisco Prime.\n\nThe AXIOSS software suite has already been integrated into the Cisco managed services solutions. The Cisco Advanced Services operational support systems practice will offer implementation, customization and integration services for the Cisco Prime fulfillment platform as a result of the acquisition.\n\nUpon the close of the acquisition, the AXIOSS team will be integrated into the Cisco Network Management Technology Group and Cisco Advanced Services Group. The acquisition is subject to various standard closing conditions and is expected to be complete in the third quarter of calendar year 2011."
