(CSCO) said Friday it has completed its acquisition of service fulfillment software assets and associated employees from the UK subsidiary of Comptel Corp.\n\nThe acquisition gives Cisco the ability to extend network and service management technologies across its next-generation Internet Protocol network platforms, allowing service providers to quickly and efficiently launch new video, data, mobility and cloud services to their customers.\n\nCisco acquired the AXIOSS software suite, a fulfillment platform that strengthens the Cisco service provider management offering by automating ordering and fulfillment. The software provides management capabilities for network services across Cisco's five company priorities. It also enhances Cisco Prime, which enables service providers to better manage their networks and network services.\n\nThe AXIOSS team will join the Cisco Network Management Technology and Cisco Advanced Services Groups.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com"
