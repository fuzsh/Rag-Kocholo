Aporeto was a cloud-native security startup that was acquired by Palo Alto Networks in November of 2019. Amir started his career at Sun Microsystems. In 2003, he joined Topspin Communications as a product manager. After the acquisition of Topspin by Cisco Systems, Amir joined VMware as the product manager for VMware ESXi. When not working on inventing the future in a startup, Amir enjoys time with his six children and, when the kids let him, he curls up with a history book."
