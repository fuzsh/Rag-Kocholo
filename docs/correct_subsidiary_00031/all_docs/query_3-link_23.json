ThousandEyes enables organizations to visualize any network as if it was their own, quickly surface actionable insights, and collaborate and solve problems with service providers.\n\nMore than ever, the internet has become a critical lifeline for billions of people worldwide. Moving to the next normal, IT teams must ensure business continuity during irregular operations to ensure positive and high-quality digital experiences.\n\nRecent global challenges have accelerated the pace of change, making remote working the new norm creating a surge in home shopping and digital commerce. As companies evolve towards digital businesses, it places enormous strain on enterprise IT teams that are now responsible for infrastructure, networks and services they do not own or control, yet where quality of experience impacts employee productivity, customer experience, revenue, and brand reputation.\n\nCisco’s strength in network and application performance and ThousandEyes visibility into the internet will provide customers with a complete, end-to-end view into the digital delivery of applications and services over the internet, enabling them to pinpoint deficiencies and improve network and application performance across enterprise and cloud networks.\n\nCisco will incorporate ThousandEyes capabilities across Cisco’s core networking, cloud, security and application portfolios to deliver unparalleled visibility across the enterprise, internet and the cloud, from the data center to branch offices, from cloud-hosted applications to users and devices anywhere.\n\nQ: Can you explain ThousandEyes offering?\n\nA: ThousandEyes combines a variety of active and passive monitoring techniques to give customers deep insight into user experience across the applications and services delivered over the internet. ThousandEyes leverages an expansive Internet monitoring data set to provide real-time Internet outage detection, powered by collective intelligence.\n\nThousandEyes enables real-time deep network visibility including the public internet to pinpoint application experience problems caused by network outages. Network monitoring is done through a global network of agents:\n\n● Cloud – performance of local transit providers and last mile ISPs\n\n● Enterprise – performance within sites and WAN\n\n● Endpoint – end-user perspective of application and networking experience\n\nThousandEyes focuses on three key use cases that visualize user experience across networks and applications:\n\n● Customer Digital Experience: visualize, understand and improve connected experiences everywhere with a focus on revenue, reputation, risk and regulatory compliance\n\n● Employee Digital Experience: transform remote worker experience, and successfully embrace multi-cloud and SaaS, focusing on productivity, cost, speed, and competitive advantage\n\n● WAN Experience: deploy modern WAN infrastructures as a baseline for branch readiness, including both overlay and underlay monitoring\n\nQ: Why did Cisco choose ThousandEyes?\n\nA: The internet is the new corporate network with rapid acceleration of Cloud adoption and widespread use of SaaS applications due to many businesses and their employees working from home. Bringing together Cisco’s strength in network and application performance and ThousandEyes visibility across the internet will provide customers with a complete, end-to-end view into the digital delivery of applications and services over the internet, enabling them to pinpoint deficiencies and improve network and application performance across enterprise and cloud networks. This acquisition will also empower enterprises to accelerate their digital transformation, no matter where they are in their journey.\n\nQ: Has Cisco previously worked with ThousandEyes? If so, in what capacity?\n\nA: Cisco has been a customer of ThousandEyes since November 2013."
