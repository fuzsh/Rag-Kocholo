The investment fund secured a 63% stake in the company, valuing it at $2.4 billion, after a bidding war that pitted it against mainframe modernization firm Rocket Software. Prior to the deal, Software AG’s largest shareholder was a foundation, SAGST, created by one of its founders. SAGST’s 30% holding had for years protected the company from takeovers, but in April the foundation agreed to sell most of its stake to Silver Lake. Sanjay Brahmawar, CEO of Software AG since August 2018, said the company will benefit from the stability and certainty provided by a single major shareholder.\n\nJune 2023\n\nIBM offers $4.6 billion for Apptio\n\nIBM has agreed to buy cloud cost control specialist Apptio from private equity firm Vista, which has owned it since 2018.

With the acquisition, Databricks hopes to make it easier for enterprises to build LLMs based on their own data.\n\nSilver Lake buys Qualtrics for $12.5 billion\n\nQualtrics has changed hands again. SAP acquired it for $8 billion in 2018, but the graft didn’t take, and SAP soon sold a minority stake. Now Silver Lake and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board have snapped up the whole company. The deal closed on June 28. SAP will remain a go-to-market partner of Qualtrics and service their joint customers.\n\nData center operator nLighten has bought Euclyde, owner of six data centers in neighboring France.

The deal came just days after Neeva closed its subscription-based, ad-free search engine. While difficult to build a search experience people were willing to pay for, it turned out to be the easy part, according to a farewell blog post from Neeva’s founders: “Convincing users to pay for a better experience was actually a less difficult problem compared to getting them to try a new search engine in the first place.” Now it’s up to Snowflake to convince its customers to change.\n\nIBM to automate cloud data protection with Polar Security acquisition\n\nData security posture management specialist Polar Security will soon be part of IBM, which plans to integrate the Israeli company into its Guardium range of data security products.
