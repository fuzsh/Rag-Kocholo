        "text": "Cisco Systems Inc. is an American multinational tech giant, which designs and sells technologies that power the internet. The Company integrates platforms across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud.\n\nThrough its fully owned Israeli subsidiaries, Cisco Systems has a broad base of complicity with Israel’s occupation economy, predominantly through the provision of services to the Israeli military.\n\nServices to the Israeli Military\n\nIn October 2023, Cisco Systems Israel supported the development of the digital platform “Israel Rises” of the Home Front Command, a branch of the Israeli military.\n\nAlso in October 2023, amid the attack on Gaza, the company gave grants to its employees who were on reserve duty in the Israeli Military.\n\nUnified Communication Systems\n\nCisco provides the Israeli military with Cisco Unified Communications, an IP-based communications system that integrates voice, video, data, and mobility products and applications.\n\nIn March 2020, Cisco Systems began laying tens of Unified Communication systems for the Israeli military, expected to reach hundreds of systems. The unified network centralizes the transfer of video, voice, and data between different Israeli military units. Cisco’s Unified Communication system serves to accelerate the Israeli military’s response timeframe.\n\nDavid’s Citadel – underground ICT Data Center\n\nCisco Systems’ computing and communication systems as well as cyber security and load balancing systems were integrated into the Israeli military’s biggest ICT underground data center in the Naqab called David’s Citadel, completed in 2020. The Data Center cost reached NIS 1.6 billion.\n\nThe Military server farm has a storage capacity that’s 10,000 more than the standard computer and integrates 300 of the Israeli military’s surveillance, intelligence, and combat units’ ICT data systems in one base. Centralizing Israel’s ICT data serves to bolster the capacity of Israel’s intelligence and combat military units.\n\nThe center is part of the Israeli military’s strive to centralize data and its “move to the south” plan launched in 2011. The plan involved the relocation of Israeli military bases to the Naqab as part of Israel’s broader strive to Judaize the Naqab. For more on development and military projects in the Naqab visit Who Profits’ interactive map Tools of Dispossession in the Naqab: Development & Military Projects\n\nJoint projects with the military\n\nIn May 2022, it was reported that Cisco engineers together with Israeli soldiers of the ICT Unit developed application for use by civil society organizations which work with the military.\n\nAccording to the Cisco’s VP of technology, “The connection between the technology units in the Israeli military and the high-tech companies in Israel is a significant anchor in the accuracy and advanced development of technologies that serve the security of the state and the bodies responsible for it… The sight of officers in uniforms sitting next to our engineers and developing technological solutions together is very natural to us, but still exciting.”\n\nServers\n\nIn 2017, Cisco Systems won a tender to supply the Israeli military with servers for the duration of three years with the possibility of extension, for a total amount of NIS 1 billion. The servers were to be integrated by the Israeli company Bynet Data Communications Ltd. The tender was funded by US foreign aid provided by the United States to Israel.\n\nServices to settlements\n\nIn February 2019, the Ministry for the Development of the Negev and the Galilee allocated NIS 90 million for the 'Klika' project, in cooperation with Cisco Systems, for the launch of 45 technological hubs, all of which will be equipped with Cisco communication technology. By September 2023, seven of the 36 hubs that have been opened are located on occupied territory. Five hubs are located in the occupied West Bank, in the settlements of Modi’in Illit, Beitar Illit, Kiryat Arba, Itamar, and Sha’ar Binyamin Industrial Zone. Two additional hubs are located in the occupied Syrian Golan – one at the Ha’Emir junction, between the settlement of Sha’al and Odem, and the second in the settlement of Katzrin.\n\nTechnological Hubs in the Naqab\n\nAs of September 2023, eleven Cisco technology-equipped hubs have been opened in the Naqab, of which two are located in the Palestinian Bedouin towns of Hura and Rahat.\n\nThese hubs form part of the Israeli government’s industrialization and resettlement plan which strives to create jobs in the Naqab, in the hope of drawing Jewish Israelis to settle in the region, while concentrating its Palestinian communities into ghettoized residential areas.\n\nServices and Equipment to the Israeli police\n\nIn August 2022, the Technology Department of the Israeli police purchased communication equipment called “Nituv” (Routing) including licensing and software manufactured by Cisco through the seller, Matrix Network Net Ltd.\n\nAccording to a response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request submitted by Who Profits to the Israeli Police, between the years 2020 and 2021 the Israeli police purchased Cisco Systems equipment and software worth NIS 4,060,533 million.\n\nEnhancing surveillance in Jerusalem\n\nIn 2017, Cisco and the Jerusalem Municipality signed a memorandum of understanding for cooperation between the municipality and the company to make Jerusalem the first smart city in Israel.\n\nIn the same year, Cisco installed communication equipment and CCTVs for the Jerusalem municipality as part of a pilot project for the development of Smart City technology in the west of the city.\n\nThe Smart City project is part of Israel's surveillance apparatus in Jerusalem, which is aimed mainly at the Palestinian residents of the city.
