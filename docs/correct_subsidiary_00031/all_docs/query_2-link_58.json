We test our products internally before we release them, and we strive to correct all vulnerabilities quickly. If you think that you have identified a vulnerability in a Cisco product, contact PSIRT:\n\n• For Emergencies only — security-alert@cisco.com\n\nAn emergency is either a condition in which a system is under active attack or a condition for which a severe and urgent security vulnerability should be reported. All other conditions are considered nonemergencies.\n\n• For Nonemergencies — psirt@cisco.com\n\nIn an emergency, you can also reach PSIRT by telephone:\n\n• 1 877 228-7302\n\n• 1 408 525-6532\n\nTip We encourage you to use Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) or a compatible product (for example, GnuPG) to encrypt any sensitive information that you send to Cisco. PSIRT can work with information that has been encrypted with PGP versions 2.x through 9.x.\n\nNever use a revoked or an expired encryption key. The correct public key to use in your correspondence with PSIRT is the one linked in the Contact Summary section of the Security Vulnerability Policy page at this URL:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html\n\nThe link on this page has the current PGP key ID in use.\n\nIf you do not have or use PGP, contact PSIRT at the aforementioned e-mail addresses or phone numbers before sending any sensitive material to find other means of encrypting the data.\n\nObtaining Technical Assistance\n\nCisco Technical Support provides 24-hour-a-day award-winning technical assistance.

(S3 and S4 service requests are those in which your network is minimally impaired or for which you require product information.) After you describe your situation, the TAC Service Request Tool provides recommended solutions. If your issue is not resolved using the recommended resources, your service request is assigned to a Cisco engineer. The TAC Service Request Tool is located at this URL:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/techsupport/servicerequest\n\nFor S1 or S2 service requests, or if you do not have Internet access, contact the Cisco TAC by telephone.

Cisco engineers are assigned immediately to S1 and S2 service requests to help keep your business operations running smoothly.\n\nTo open a service request by telephone, use one of the following numbers:\n\nAsia-Pacific: +61 2 8446 7411 (Australia: 1 800 805 227)\n\nEMEA: +32 2 704 55 55\n\nUSA: 1 800 553-2447\n\nFor a complete list of Cisco TAC contacts, go to this URL:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/techsupport/contacts\n\nDefinitions of Service Request Severity\n\nTo ensure that all service requests are reported in a standard format, Cisco has established severity definitions.\n\nSeverity 1 (S1)—An existing network is down, or there is a critical impact to your business operations. You and Cisco will commit all necessary resources around the clock to resolve the situation.\n\nSeverity 2 (S2)—Operation of an existing network is severely degraded, or significant aspects of your business operations are negatively affected by inadequate performance of Cisco products. You and Cisco will commit full-time resources during normal business hours to resolve the situation.\n\nSeverity 3 (S3)—Operational performance of the network is impaired, while most business operations remain functional. You and Cisco will commit resources during normal business hours to restore service to satisfactory levels.\n\nSeverity 4 (S4)—You require information or assistance with Cisco product capabilities, installation, or configuration. There is little or no effect on your business operations.\n\nObtaining Additional Publications and Information\n\nInformation about Cisco products, technologies, and network solutions is available from various online and printed sources.\n\n• The Cisco Product Quick Reference Guide is a handy, compact reference tool that includes brief product overviews, key features, sample part numbers, and abbreviated technical specifications for many Cisco products that are sold through channel partners.
