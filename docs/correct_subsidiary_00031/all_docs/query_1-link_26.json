(Don't include\n\nthe brackets!) The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n\ncomment syntax for the file format.

Additional Definitions.\n\nAs used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\n\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\n\nGeneral Public License.\n\n\"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\n\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\nAn \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\n\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\n\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\n\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\nA \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\n\nApplication with the Library. The particular version of the Library\n\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\n\nVersion\".\n\nThe \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\n\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\n\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\n\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\n\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\n\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\n\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\n\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\n\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\n\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\n\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\n\nversion:\n\na) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n\nensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n\nfunction or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n\nwhatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\nb) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n\nthis License applicable to that copy.\n\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\n\na header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object\n\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\n\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\n\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n\ncovered by this License.\n\nb) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n\ndocument.\n\n4. Combined Works.\n\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\n\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\n\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\n\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\n\nthe following:\n\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n\nthe Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n\ncovered by this License.\n\nb) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n\ndocument.\n\nc) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n\nexecution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n\nthese notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n\ncopies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\nd) Do one of the following:\n\n0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n\nLicense, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n\nsuitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n\nrecombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n\nthe Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n\nmanner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n\nCorresponding Source.\n\n1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n\nLibrary. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n\na copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n\nsystem, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n\nof the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n\nVersion.\n\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n\nbe required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n\nGNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n\nnecessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n\nCombined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n\nApplication with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n\nyou use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n\nthe Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n\nCode. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n\nInformation in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n\nfor conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n5. Combined Libraries.\n\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\n\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\n\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\n\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n\non the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n\nconveyed under the terms of this License.\n\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n\nis a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n\naccompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\n\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\n\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\n\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\n\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\n\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\n\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\n\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\n\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\n\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\n\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\n\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\n\nLibrary.\n\nSoftware: Eigen 3.4.0\n\nCopyright notice:\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Benoit Steiner <benoit.steiner.goog@gmail.com>\n\nCopyright (C) 2013 Christian Seiler <christian@iwakd.de>\n\nCopyright (C) 2015 Eugene Brevdo <ebrevdo@gmail.com>\n\nCopyright (C) 2014-2015 Benoit Steiner <benoit.steiner.goog@gmail.com>\n\nCopyright (C) 2015 Navdeep Jaitly <ndjaitly@google.com>\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Eric Martin <eric@ericmart.in>\n\nCopyright (C) 2015 Benoit Steiner <benoit.steiner.goog@gmail.com>\n\nCopyright (C) 2016 Rasmus Munk Larsen <rmlarsen@google.com>\n\nCopyright (C) 2016 Benoit Steiner <benoit.steiner.goog@gmail.com>\n\nCopyright (C) 2015 Jianwei Cui <thucjw@gmail.com>\n\nCopyright (C) 2016 Eugene Brevdo <ebrevdo@gmail.com>\n\nCopyright (C) 2015 Ke Yang <yangke@gmail.com>\n\nCopyright (C) 2016 Mehdi Goli, Codeplay Software Ltd <eigen@codeplay.com>\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Navdeep Jaitly <ndjaitly@google.com>\n\nCopyright (C) 2016 Igor Babuschkin <igor@babuschk.in>\n\nCopyright (C) 2016 Dmitry Vyukov <dvyukov@google.com>\n\nCopyright (C) EDF R&D, lun sep 30 14:23:30 CEST 2002\n\nCopyright (C) 2008 Gael Guennebaud <gael.guennebaud@inria.fr>\n\nCopyright (C) EDF R&D, lun sep 30 14:23:31 CEST 2002\n\nCopyright (C) 2008-2010 Gael Guennebaud <gael.guennebaud@inria.fr>\n\nCopyright (C) 2008-2016 Gael Guennebaud <gael.guennebaud@inria.fr>\n\nCopyright (C) 2009 Mark Borgerding mark a borgerding net\n\nCopyright (C) 2008-2009 Gael Guennebaud <gael.guennebaud@inria.fr>\n\nCopyright (C) 2013 Desire Nuentsa <desire.nuentsawakam@inria.fr>\n\nCopyright (C) 2013 Gael Guennebaud <gael.guennebaud@inria.fr>\n\nCopyright (C) 2011 Gael Guennebaud <gael.guennebaud@inria.fr>\n\nCopyright (C) 2012 Desire NUENTSA WAKAM <desire.nuentsawakam@inria.fr>\n\nCopyright (C) 2009 Benoit Jacob <jacob.benoit.1@gmail.com>\n\nCopyright (C) 2009 Gael Guennebaud <gael.guennebaud@inria.fr>\n\nCopyright (C) 2006-2010 Benoit Jacob <jacob.benoit.1@gmail.com>\n\nCopyright (C) 2006-2008 Benoit Jacob <jacob.benoit.1@gmail.com>\n\nCopyright (C) EDF R&D, lun sep 30 14:23:28 CEST 2002\n\nCopyright (C) 2010 Manuel Yguel <manuel.yguel@gmail.com>\n\nCopyright (C) 2009 Claire Maurice\n\nCopyright (C) 2010,2012 Jitse Niesen <jitse@maths.leeds.ac.uk>\n\nCopyright (c) 2011, Intel Corporation.

Definitions\n\n1.1. “Contributor”\n\nmeans each individual or legal entity that creates, contributes to the creation of, or owns Covered Software.\n\n1.2. “Contributor Version”\n\nmeans the combination of the Contributions of others (if any) used by a Contributor and that particular Contributor’s Contribution.\n\n1.3. “Contribution”\n\nmeans Covered Software of a particular Contributor.\n\n1.4. “Covered Software”\n\nmeans Source Code Form to which the initial Contributor has attached the notice in Exhibit A, the Executable Form of such Source Code Form, and Modifications of such Source Code Form, in each case including portions thereof.\n\n1.5. “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”\n\nmeans\n\nthat the initial Contributor has attached the notice described in Exhibit B to the Covered Software; or\n\nthat the Covered Software was made available under the terms of version 1.1 or earlier of the License, but not also under the terms of a Secondary License.\n\n1.6. “Executable Form”\n\nmeans any form of the work other than Source Code Form.\n\n1.7. “Larger Work”\n\nmeans a work that combines Covered Software with other material, in a separate file or files, that is not Covered Software.\n\n1.8. “License”\n\nmeans this document.\n\n1.9. “Licensable”\n\nmeans having the right to grant, to the maximum extent possible, whether at the time of the initial grant or subsequently, any and all of the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n1.10. “Modifications”\n\nmeans any of the following:\n\nany file in Source Code Form that results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of Covered Software; or\n\nany new file in Source Code Form that contains any Covered Software.\n\n1.11. “Patent Claims” of a Contributor\n\nmeans any patent claim(s), including without limitation, method, process, and apparatus claims, in any patent Licensable by such Contributor that would be infringed, but for the grant of the License, by the making, using, selling, offering for sale, having made, import, or transfer of either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n\n1.12. “Secondary License”\n\nmeans either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, the GNU Lesser General Public License, Version 2.1, the GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3.0, or any later versions of those licenses.\n\n1.13. “Source Code Form”\n\nmeans the form of the work preferred for making modifications.\n\n1.14. “You” (or “Your”)\n\nmeans an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this License. For legal entities, “You” includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with You. For purposes of this definition, “control” means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n2. License Grants and Conditions\n\n2.1. Grants\n\nEach Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n\nunder intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and\n\nunder Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n\n2.2. Effective Date\n\nThe licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.\n\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n\nThe licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n\nfor any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n\nfor infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or\n\nunder Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.\n\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\nNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\n\nEach Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6. Fair Use\n\nThis License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n\n2.7. Conditions\n\nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\n\n3. Responsibilities\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\nsuch Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\nYou may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\nCovered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\nUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\nThis Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.\n\nIf it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.\n\nYou may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n\nExhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice\n\nThis Source Code Form is “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.\n\nSoftware: JSON for Modern C++ 3.10.1\n\nCopyright notice:\n\nCopyright 2015 Google Inc.
