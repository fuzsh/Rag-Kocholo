        "text": "Cisco, one of the largest technology companies in the world, specializes in networking, cyber security, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and video collaboration.\n\nCisco is committed to innovation and research through which it develops technology that changes the way people communicate.\n\nInteresting Statistics From 2021 that Highlight Ciscoâs Success:\n\nTotal revenue ofÂ $49.8 billionÂ\n\nNet income ofÂ $10.6 billionÂ\n\nMarket capitalization ofÂ 178.35 billion\n\nStock price ofÂ $43.07\n\n79,500Â total employees\n\nMarket share ofÂ 38.7Â in ethernet switch and router market\n\nLetâs explore Ciscoâs history to find out how it became the biggest provider of networking solutions and a pioneer in the field of cloud computing.\n\n{{cta('eed3a6a3-0c12-4c96-9964-ac5329a94a27')}}\n\nCisco Systemâs Innovation Strategy Revolutionizes Router Technology\n\nIn 1984, two computer scientists discovered how to connect computer networks housed in separate buildings on the Standard University campus.\n\nThose two scientists wereÂ Leonard Bosack and Sandra LernerÂ and our power couple soon realized that their newly discovered router technology could be modified for large-scale use in corporate organizations and government agencies.\n\nThe idea laid the foundation for Cisco Systems success and the company would go on to become the leading supplier of computer networking products and services to corporations, research institutes, and government organizations.\n\nThe Invention of the Multi-Protocol Router Gets Cisco Going\n\nIn 1985, Cisco Systems sold its first product, which was a network interface card, to a company called Digital Equipment Corporation.\n\nBut Ciscoâs big break was yet to come.\n\nThe next year, the company developed a new product calledÂ AGS Multi-Protocol RouterÂ which was an advanced version of an internetworking router.\n\nIt was a device that automatically selected the best route for data to flow between two networks enabling faster communication between different networks.\n\nCiscoâs multi-protocol router was revolutionary because it could be used on any kind of network even those with different protocols or data transmission standards.\n\nIt could also be used with different types of computers, from IBM-compatible personal computers and IBM mainframes to Apple Macintosh computers and UNIX workstations.\n\nHence, Cisco Systems became the first company to produce a multi-protocol router for commercial use that could be used by all kinds of organizations to connect their computer networks in different locations.\n\nBy 1987, Cisco Systems was selling almost $250,000 worth of routers per month (almost $652,000 today after adjusting for inflation). Annual sales for that year climbed to $1.5 million ($3.9 million after adjusting for inflation).\n\nBut the company never stopped innovating and soon introduced theÂ Interior Gateway Routing ProtocolÂ (IGRP). It was a distance vector routing protocol that could be used by routers to exchange information about IP routes within an autonomous system.\n\nBy 1989, Cisco Systems had released more innovative products such as the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) for DCN Networks, Enhanced Ethernet interface, and the cBus Controller for Fiber Distributed Data Interface.\n\nThe new products were all designed to speed up network-to-network communications to minimize any time delays.\n\nFor example, the BGP protocol was designed specifically for the internet. The protocol ensured that routers picked the most efficient route to deliver Internet traffic.\n\nAlthough Cisco Systems innovation in router technology helped the company expand its product offerings, its market base was still limited. Hence, the company developed a new marketing strategy to reach out to more customers.\n\nCisco Systemâs Marketing Strategy Secures Mainstream Consumers\n\nThe company initially marketed its products to individual scientists at research centers, government facilities, and universities.\n\nHowever, the company now wanted to expand its reach to mainstream corporations with branches in geographically diverse regions.\n\nBut, Cisco Systems needed an impressive lineup of products to appeal to these new customers. Plus, the new products had to be tailor-made to meet the exclusive needs of commercial entities.\n\nSo, Cisco Systems went back to the drawing board to do what it does best, and that is innovating. The company upgraded many of its routers to serve an even greater range of communication protocols so that clients could use the routers with any network.\n\nIn fact, Cisco Systemâs routers supported more protocols than any other router manufacturer in the industry. So, the company was well ahead of the competition when the commercial market for router technology began to take off.\n\nHowever, Cisco Systems was still a young company, and it needed to secure investments to fuel growth over the coming years. So, the company reached out toÂ Sequoia CapitalÂ for assistance.\n\nIt would prove to be a symbiotic partnership. Cisco Systems received the required financial support whileÂ Donald T. ValentineÂ of Sequoia Capital acquired the role of chairperson in Cisco Systems.\n\nValentine soon brought inÂ John MorgridgeÂ as the new CEO and president of Cisco Systems. Under Morgridgeâs lead, the company built up a dedicated sales team to market its products to corporate clients.\n\nDuring this period, all kinds of organizations were creating their own local area networks to connect different branches. So, Morgridgeâs team knew that the market for their products was going to expand, so they redoubled their efforts to reach out to clients.\n\nSoon, Cisco Systems was selling products to all kinds of major organizations. The company helped connect the computer systems of different offices of the same organization for example, by connecting the regional and local branches.\n\nIn 1991, the company recorded total sales revenue of $183.2 million ($398.6 million today) and a net income of $43.2 million ($94.0 million today).\n\nBy 1992, sales revenue had crossed the $339.6 million mark ($717.2 million today), and net income stood at $84.4 million ($178.3 million today).\n\nIn 1993, Cisco Systems entered into a joint venture withÂ AT & TÂ andÂ StrataComÂ to develop asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) protocols for Frame Relay networks. ATM technology provided high-speed communications of data, voice, video, and images without the use of routers.\n\nSo, Cisco Systems developed a strategy to include ATMs in all of its new product offerings, and the following year the company launched its first ATM switch for commercial use.\n\nThe company also released an upgraded version of its high-end router called theÂ Cisco 7000.\n\nIt also released a more economical router called theÂ Cisco 2000Â for smaller companies that wanted to link remote employees or small branches but could not afford the pricier Cisco 7000.\n\nIndeed, Cisco Systems was dubbed the second fastest growing company in the United States by Fortune Magazine based on its phenomenal growth in such a short time from its inception in 1984.\n\nKey Takeaway 1: Innovation Works When It Serves Your Customers\n\nCisco Systems' foundation was laid in the spirit of innovation.\n\nThe company quickly established itself as a powerhouse of innovation with the release of multiple products such as the multi-protocol router, the Interior Gateway Routing Protocol, the ATM switch, and the Cisco 7000.\n\nAfter all, nothing draws in customers like an innovative new product that can eliminate major pain points and improve organizational productivity. Cisco Systems products did just that by helping companies connect their local area networks that were present in different locations.\n\nThe company also made sure to provide products that were tailor-made for clientsâ needs and which supported more protocols than any other service provider.\n\nPlus, Cisco Systems was also successful in expanding its customer base because it created products that catered to all kinds of consumers from mainstream corporations to small companies who could only purchase low-priced products.\n\nCisco Systemâs Acquisition Strategy Makes it a One-Stop Networking Solution\n\nThe '90s can rightly be called the decade of acquisitions for Cisco Systems. The company developed a comprehensive plan to acquire businesses that could enhance its capabilities and product offerings with the influx of fresh ideas and technology.\n\nThis is the story of how Cisco Systems became the leader of the networking industry, a position that it retains to this day.\n\nCisco Systems International Expansion Increases Sales Revenue\n\nSo far, the company had served clients in the U.S and Japan, but now it sought to expand its international presence to reach customers in other parts of the world.\n\nIn 1993, Cisco Systems established subsidiaries in Japan and Australia, and Hong Kong. The company also established a European Technical Assistance Center in Belgium.\n\nIn 1992, international sales accounted for only 36% of total sales, but the newly established subsidiaries helped increase international sales to 39%. Cisco Systems international strategy helped boost international sales to 42% of total sales by 1994.\n\nThe deregulation of the U.S telephone industry brought new opportunities for Cisco Systems. The company could now market its products to long-distance telephone companies that wanted to partner with a router manufacturer like Cisco Systems to expand their data communications products and services.\n\nCisco Systems entered a joint venture withÂ MCI InternationalÂ to provide routers for MCIâs telephone lines. The company also signed agreements withÂ Bell Atlantic Corp. and U.S. West Information Systems Inc.\n\nIn 1993, the company signed an agreement with Pacific Bell to become the main supplier of routers for the companyâs telephone networks.\n\nCisco Systems also expanded its presence in the international telecommunications market. It entered into original equipment manufacturer agreements with multiple European telecommunications companies, including British Telecom, Alcatel, and Siemens.\n\nFurthermore, the company also expanded its market presence at home by partnering with software companies such asÂ NovellÂ andÂ Microsoft Corporation.Â\n\nCisco Systems marketing strategy involved a joint venture with Microsoft to use Microsoftâs market channels to advertise its own products such as the Cisco PC-based router card.\n\nIt also provided routers to Novell to link Novellâs Netware software network with Unix-based networks.\n\nCiscoâs Acquisition Strategy for Better Networking Solutions\n\nIn 1993, Cisco Systems initiated a phase of aggressive acquisitions to expand its product offerings.\n\nCrescendo CommunicationsÂ was the first in a long line of acquisitions by Cisco Systems. The company acquired Crescendo Communications for $95 million ($194.8 million today) to gain access to advanced ATM switching technologies that were incorporated into the latest Cisco Catalyst 5000 switches.\n\nThe following year, Cisco Systems acquiredÂ Newport Systems SolutionsÂ for $93 million ($185.9 million today) in stock. The acquisition gave Cisco Systems access to Newportâs LAN2LAN software that was used to connect different local area networks.\n\nIn 1994, Cisco Systems acquired two more companies that were involved in the production of switching technologies. The first acquisition wasÂ Kalpana IncÂ for $240 million ($477.9 million) and the other one wasÂ LightStream Corp.Â for $120 million (239.9 million today).\n\nThe two acquisitions helped Cisco Systems gain access to better Ethernet and ATM switching technologies. The acquisitions helped Cisco Systems develop Cisco Fusion.\n\nCisco FusionÂ was a new networking architecture that helped clients gradually transition from routers to advanced switched networks.\n\nIn 1994, the company released a range of new products such asÂ ATM Interface ProcessorÂ and theÂ Catalyst FDDI-to-Ethernet LAN switchÂ through its Cisco Fusion initiative.\n\nThe Fusion initiative was a major Cisco Systems achievement and the company recorded a whopping $1.24 billion ($2.5 billion today) in net sales in fiscal year 1994. Net income stood at $314.9 million ($629.6 million today) which was an increase of 82% from the previous year.\n\nBut the company had more acquisitions lined up so that it could keep ahead of its competition. In 1995, the company acquiredÂ Grand Junction Inc.Â for $400 million ($777.7 million today) to gain access to its Fast Ethernet and Ethernet switching technology.\n\nThe following year the company spent $220 million ($415.5 million today) to acquireÂ Granite Systems Inc. which was a company known for its Gigabit Ethernet switches.\n\nHowever, Cisco Systemâs biggest acquisition during this period was that ofÂ StrataCom, Inc.Â The hefty $4.67 billion ($8.6 billion today) acquisition gave Cisco Systems access to advanced ATM and Frame Relay WAN switching equipment that could handle both audio and video data communications.\n\nPlus, the acquisition of StrataCom Inc. was a strategic move on the part of Cisco Systems to gain more customers in the telecommunications access providers market.\n\nCisco Systems was also keeping an eye on emerging networking sectors such as DSL, and internet telephony.\n\nIn 1998, Cisco Systems acquiredÂ NetSpeed, Inc.Â which made DSL equipment. In those days, DSL was the fastest way for homes and small businesses to access the Internet through existing telephone lines.\n\nThe company also acquiredÂ LightSpeed International, Inc.Â andÂ Selsius Systems, Inc.Â to gain a foothold in the internet telephony sector.\n\nOther emerging areas at the time included fiber-optic networking and wireless networking. In 1999, Cisco Systems acquired the fiber-optic companyÂ Cerent CorporationÂ for an enormous $7.6 billion ($13.5 billion today) price tag.\n\nThe company also acquired the Italian firmÂ PirelliÂ which made fiber-optic technology that could split light into 128 âcolorsâ with each one carrying a separate piece of audio or video data.\n\nFiber-optics technology enabled telecommunications companies to handle more audio and video transmissions than ever before, so Cisco Systemâs acquisition of Cerent Co. and Pirelli was a well-planned maneuver to better serve its telecommunications clients.\n\nWireless technology was also an emerging field at the time. In 1999, Cisco Systems acquiredÂ Aironet WirelessÂ for $800 million ($1.4 billion today) to make wireless local area networks for homes and offices.\n\nKey Takeaway 2: Make Strategic Acquisitions To Expand To Adjacent Categories\n\nCisco Systems' aggressive acquisition strategy helped the company expand its product line to include upgraded networking solutions that helped the company remain relevant to consumers.\n\nBy the time the 90s wound to a close, Cisco Systems had managed to secure customers beyond corporations and research institutes. The company was now a major provider of networking solutions to multiple firms in the telecommunications industry, both at home and abroad.\n\nWith the addition of new technologies to its portfolio, Cisco Systems was able to enter emerging sectors in the networking industry well ahead of the competition.\n\nIt was able to incorporate the latest technology into its products to improve their performance so that they could meet the evolving needs of its biggest consumers.\n\nThe move paid off, and Cisco Systemâs market capitalization rose to $100 billion in 1998 to make the company the industry leader in networking products and services. Cisco Systemsâ revenue also crossed the $12.15 billion mark by the time the financial year 1999 came to a close.\n\n{{cta('eed3a6a3-0c12-4c96-9964-ac5329a94a27')}}\n\nCiscoâs Growth Strategy for the 21stÂ Century\n\nCisco Systems' market capitalization surpassed the $500 billion mark ($860.3 billion today) in 2000 and revenues stood at $906 million ($1.6 billion today) for just the second quarter of the 2000 fiscal year.\n\nSoon, Cisco Systems thenÂ CEO John ChambersÂ announced plans for an acquisition-led growth strategy to power growth for the coming years.\n\nThe strategy would be characterized by strategic alliances with other companies in the area of telecommunications and network security to double Cisco's existing revenue.\n\nCiscoâs âQuadruple Playâ Business Model\n\nThe company had spent much of the 90s developing strategic partnerships with telecommunications firms, but Cisco Systems now needed an updated strategy to remain a key provider of products and services to its industry clients.\n\nMany telecommunications companies at the time wanted to provide their customers with a complete package deal that included broadband Internet access, Internet-based telephone service, wireless calling, and video services such as video-on-demand.\n\nHence, Cisco Systems pursued a âquadruple play' business strategy to become a one-stop provider of all kinds of services from broadband internet, telephone, and paid TV services. But to do that, the company needed to upgrade its video product offerings.\n\nIn 2005, Cisco Systems purchasedÂ KISS TechnologyÂ which was a manufacturer of networked DVD players. A few months later, the company also acquiredÂ Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.,Â a key producer of cable television set-top boxes.\n\nBoth acquisitions helped Cisco Systems expand its video offerings, thereby completing its 'quadruple play' strategy. The strategy gave Cisco Systems a competitive advantage over rival suppliers to major telecommunications companies.\n\nCiscoâs Acquisition-led Growth StrategyÂ\n\nIn 2006, Cisco Systems shortened its name to Cisco to make the company a household name.\n\nThe company also continued to expand its international presence with the establishment of aÂ Globalization Centre EastÂ in India.\n\nHowever, the companyâs main strategy for growth was characterized by entry into new markets through strategic acquisitions and partnerships.\n\nA good example is Ciscoâs entry into the network security area through a series of acquisitions from 2007 to 2015.\n\nStarting in 2007, Cisco acquiredÂ IronPortÂ for $830 million ($1.2 billion today). IronPort was a well-known developer of anti-spam and email security services. The company was integrated into Ciscoâs Security business division, and IronPortâs SenderBase technology was used to createÂ SensorBase.\n\nSensorBase was a service provided by Cisco that let devices create a risk profile on IP addresses to keep users protected from malicious content from unsafe email addresses and suspicious websites.\n\nFurthermore, Cisco acquired two cyber security firms in 2013 for enhanced cyber threat protection. The two companies wereÂ Cognitive SecurityÂ andÂ SourceFire.\n\nThe following year, Cisco acquiredÂ ThreatGRIDÂ to gain access to dynamic malware analysis and threat intelligence technology.\n\nIn 2015, Cisco acquiredÂ Embrane,Â which was a software start-up that provided network services such as firewalls, VPN termination, and SSL offload.\n\nCisco also acquiredÂ PortcullisÂ Computer SecurityÂ in 2015. The UK-based firm provided security services for enterprise clients and government agencies.\n\nOther key acquisitions includedÂ OpenDNS, a company that monitored domain name requests for added security, andÂ Lancope,Â which focused on the detection of potential cyber security threats.\n\nCisco also entered other markets besides network security, such as network management, and network intelligence.\n\nFor instance, Cisco carried out several acquisitions to expand its portfolio in network management.\n\nIn 2011, Cisco acquired a network management software company calledÂ Pari Network. It was followed by the 2013 acquisition ofÂ IntucellÂ for $475 million ($625.7 million today). The move helped Cisco upgrade its mobile network management services.\n\nThe following year, Cisco acquiredÂ Tail-f SystemsÂ which was a leading provider of multi-vendor network service orchestration solutions.\n\nOther strategic acquisitions include that ofÂ ParStreamÂ in 2015. The German-based company provided an analytics database to help businesses analyze large amounts of data and store it in real-time on their networks.\n\nIt was followed by the 2016 acquisition ofÂ SpringpathÂ which provided the flagship technological input needed to develop CiscoâsÂ HyperFlexÂ Systems.\n\nFinally, Cisco completed the acquisition of a network intelligence firmÂ ThousandEyesÂ in 2020. The firm was a leading developer of software that could be used to analyze the performance of local and wide area networks.\n\nKey Takeaway 3: Holistic Growth Strategy Increases Market Share in Emerging Industries\n\nThe corporate team at Cisco has always kept a close eye on market conditions and emerging areas.\n\nFrom 2005 onwards, the top leadership at Cisco was keenly aware that the technology market was slowing down, especially the hardware sector.\n\nAs a result, Cisco began its transition from a producer of hardware devices to becoming a provider of a wide range of software products and services.\n\nThe company moved away from the production of routers and processors to offer software solutions to its clients.\n\nIt could not have been possible without Cisco's expansion into emerging areas such as network management, intelligence, and security.\n\nEntry into these new areas helped the company provide new services, including products for both physical and virtual networks.\n\nSome of the new services included cyber security services, data analytics capabilities, and network management solutions.\n\nThe strategy proved to be successful and Ciscoâs revenue growth in 10 years was approximately $14.6 billion. Total revenue stood at $25.8 billion ($39.1 billion today) in 2005. It increased to $40.4 billion in 2010 ($54.9 billion today) and peaked at $49.16 billion in 2015.\n\nHence, Cisco continued to follow a similar growth strategy in the years to come to sustain its annual revenue generation at the same level.\n\nCiscoâs Digital Transformation Strategy Harnesses the Power of Cloud Computing\n\nCisco is redefining itself for the future. The company is moving away from the production of hardware devices to software solutions.\n\nHence, Cisco chalked out a strategy to invest in the field of cloud computing. The plan involved acquiring the much-needed technology through targeted acquisitions and partnerships.\n\nThe company also set out to develop its own cloud-based products and services which are being used to power Ciscoâs digital transformation. Cisco also propels the digital transformation of other companies by providing these services to its corporate clients.\n\nLet's take a look at Cisco's digital transformation through the power of cloud computing.\n\nCiscoâs Corporate Strategy to Unlock the Cloud Computing Market\n\nCisco has always kept a close eye on emerging areas that have the potential to fuel company growth in the years to come. Hence, Cisco began a gradual transition towards cloud-based products in 2015 .\n\nThe company joined hands withÂ ARM Holdings, Dell, Intel, Microsoft, and Princeton UniversityÂ to launch theÂ OpenFog ConsortiumÂ to promote the development of fog computing.\n\nTo increase market share Cisco began making certain carefully planned acquisitions. It also acquiredÂ TropoÂ which was an API platform that simplified the integration of real-time communication and collaboration capabilities in a wide range of applications.\n\nIn 2015, Cisco also acquiredÂ MaintenanceNetÂ which was well-known for its ServiceExchange platform. The platform mainly provided cloud-based contract management services.\n\nCisco also acquired a tech company in India calledÂ Pawaa. The company provided Cisco access to secure cloud-based file-sharing software.\n\nIn 2016, Cisco acquired a software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) startup calledÂ VeloCloud. The company provided cloud services to help businesses configure and optimize their networks between different office branches.\n\nIt also acquired the cloud security company calledÂ CloudLockÂ for $293 million in 2016. It was followed by the acquisition of SD-WAN companyÂ ViptelaÂ Inc. for $610 million in 2017.\n\nThat same year, Cisco acquiredÂ BroadsoftÂ for $1.9 billion to penetrate further into the areas of cloud communication and collaboration.\n\nCisco also launched its first cloud-based internet gateway calledÂ Cisco UmbrellaÂ in 2017. The gateway provided secure internet access to users who needed an alternative way to connect to remote data centers without having to rely on corporate networks or VPNs.\n\nThe move paid off and Ciscoâs price-per-share value increased by 7%. The companyâs earnings per share ratio also increased from 60 to 61 cents per share.\n\nIt was followed by a string of well-planned acquisitions, starting withÂ AccompanyÂ for $270 million in 2018 andÂ VoiceaÂ in 2019. Both companies specialized in providing AI-driven solutions.\n\nCisco also acquired a customer experience management company calledÂ CloudCherryÂ in 2019.\n\nCiscoâs Digital Transformation Strategy for Better & Faster Service\n\nCisco has developed a three-pronged strategy to digitally transform its workplace and operating model.\n\nCloud-based solutions form a key part of this strategy.\n\nThe strategy involves digitally transforming the companyâs business model, workplace, and customer experience.\n\nFirstly, Ciscoâs innovation in cloud technology is helping transform the companyâs operating model by aligning its internal IT processes in five key areas:\n\nSecurity: a policy-driven approach to enable end-to-end security for the entire value chain.\n\nSimplification: an automated supply chain simplifies the operating model resulting in productivity gains. Automation results in accurate demand planning, real-time inventory\n\nmanagement, and reliable fulfillment.\n\nAutomation: the company is using modular IT to automate network edge, data center, and cloud processes.\n\nMonitoring: continuously monitor data to better support real-time business decisions.\n\nInnovation: the company is always innovating to provide stakeholders with enhanced capabilities while minimizing vulnerabilities at the same time.\n\nSecondly, Cisco is digitizing the workspace to create a better workplace environment for its employees. The goal is to improve employee productivity and reduce operating costs.\n\nCisco IT is equipping employees with digital tools so that they can better respond to consumer needs. The new digital tools include aÂ dCloudÂ self-service platform where customers can try out more than 200 Cisco services.\n\nThe company has also started aÂ Spark-based customer service program. Cisco technicians use this platform to bring together experts, engineers, and sales team representatives to create tailor-made solutions for each client.\n\nFinally, Cisco is digitally transforming critical business processes to improve the overall customer experience. The company has singled out five key areas where digital transformation is most needed:\n\nManufacturing: The company is using machine learning tools to conduct adaptive testing in manufacturing processes. Machine learning has also helped Cisco move towards perspective analysis which has resulted in a cost saving of $10 million.\n\nSupplier Collaboration: Cisco has created a cloud-based platform to manage its global supply and inventory processes. Connecting suppliers through a single platform have enabled Cisco to bridge the gap between demand and supply 35 percent faster.\n\nIT: Cisco has developed an agile IT approach by integratingÂ Docker Containers,Â OpenShift,Â andÂ Big DataÂ into its internal processes. It has helped the company develop new features faster than ever before to provide customers with improved capabilities.\n\nSales: Cisco has integrated Salesforce, LinkedIn, WebEx, and Twillio into a single digital leads platform. It has helped the company generate better sales insights and improved the overall forecasting process for clients.\n\nEnergy Management: Cisco is digitizing its factories to reduce the companyâs carbon footprint. Cisco factories are now equipped with over 1300 sensors to create an improved monitoring system. The company is also using a cloud-based solution to improve power management for a cleaner factory.\n\nHow Is Cisco Helping Its Clients Embrace Digital Transformation?\n\nCisco provides cloud-based services to clients through a Software as Service model (SaaS) and helps them digitize their companies in three ways:\n\nInnovative Business Models: Cisco helps clients develop new business models to create new ways of doing business. It also helps companies collect data from all parts of the value chain. Hence, clients can achieve leaner operations, and greater agility to respond to market changes.
