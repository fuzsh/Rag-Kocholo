        "text": "By SETH SCHIESEL\n\nrying to deliver high-speed Internet links without wires, Cisco Systems Inc. and Motorola Inc. plan to announce Monday that they have agreed to acquire a subsidiary of the Robert Bosch Corp. of Germany that is developing advanced wireless technology.\n\nCisco and Motorola do not plan to disclose terms of the agreement, but executives close to the deal said the price would be substantially less than $1 billion. That would be in line with other recent acquisitions by Cisco, which has made a string of deals but none for more than $265 million since 1996, when Cisco acquired Stratacom Inc. for $4.7 billion.\n\nCisco, the No. 1 maker of data networking equipment, and Motorola, a big maker of cellular phones and equipment, plan to buy a Bosch unit based in Richardson, Texas, that has between 100 and 200 employees. The unit is trying to make products to transmit large amounts of data between stationary fixed antennas using a wireless technology called local multipoint distribution services.\n\nOne of the hottest battlegrounds in the communications industry has become the battle to offer high-capacity data links to consumers and small and medium-sized business customers. The AT&T Corp. has bet more than $90 billion that it can offer advanced communications packages using cable television systems, for example.\n\nThe Baby Bell local phone carriers, MCI Worldcom and others are focused on so-called digital subscriber lines, a new technology that increases the data capacity of normal phone lines.\n\nThe dark horse technology in this race has been wireless. Wireless mobile telephones have become popular, but no company has yet succeeded in broadly and profitably delivering torrents of Internet data using wireless links -- whether mobile or stationary.\n\nWith the Bosch deal, Motorola and Cisco want to make high-speed, stationary wireless data delivery possible.\n\n\"This really strengthens our position in high-speed Internet access,\" said Donald J. Listwin, a Cisco executive vice president. Referring to digital subscriber line technology, he added: \"We have leading technology in cable. We have leading technology in DSL, and we have leading technology in the fixed-wireless space. We have leadership in high-speed access, which is the future of the Internet.\"\n\nIn acquiring the Bosch unit, Cisco and Motorola intend to form a new company called Spectrapoint Wireless. Motorola will own 81 percent of Spectrapoint while Cisco will own 19 percent.\n\nCisco began developing technology in cooperation with Bosch about a year ago, but found that potential customers wanted not only technology, but also financing and help in deploying wireless equipment. Partly to address those needs, Cisco turned to Motorola and in February Cisco and Motorola announced plans to jointly spend $1 billion for a period of up to five years to develop wireless products.\n\nOne challenge to Spectrapoint in the United States could be in finding customers. (Cisco's first wireless customer is in Canada.) Teligent Inc. and Winstar Communications Inc. were the first two U.S. companies to attempt to broadly deliver voice, video and data services using stationary, or fixed, wireless technology. But Teligent has committed to use mostly wireless equipment from the Nortel Networks Corp. of Canada while Winstar is working closely with Lucent Technologies.\n\nPotential new customers, including Nextlink Communications Inc., which is backed by Craig O. McCaw, the cellular phone pioneer, are on the horizon, however.\n\nRelated Sites\n\nThese sites are not part of The New York Times on the Web, and The Times has no control over their content or availability."
