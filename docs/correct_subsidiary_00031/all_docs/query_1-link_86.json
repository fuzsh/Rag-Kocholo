        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Scale Computing a leading provider of seamlessly integrated IT infrastructure for small to medium-sized organizations today announced it has added two industry veterans to its executive team. Patrick Conte joins Scale Computing as its new EVP and GM of Worldwide Field Operations. Clint McVey will join as SVP of Products and Technology.\n\n“As we are preparing to launch HC3,” said Jeff Ready, CEO and co-founder of Scale Computing, “ the addition of Pat and Clint will position us to maximize our launch into the mid-market. Their extensive backgrounds and proven experience in operations, sales and revenue growth, development and product management will accelerate our introduction of this game-changing technology to first-time virtualizers seeking an affordable, easy to manage and integrated solution we call our ‘datacenter-in-a-box.”\n\nConte joins Scale from Azul Systems, where he was the SVP of Worldwide Field Operations. With over 25 years of experience in successfully launching companies into the market from pre-revenue into IPOs and major acquisitions, Conte has consistently demonstrated strong sales execution and growth strategies, leading sales teams and maximizing relationships with channel resellers and strategic partners. Prior to Azul, Conte was President and CEO of Agiliance, an enterprise software company focused on IT governance, risk, and compliance (IT GRC) solutions. Conte was also EVP and GM of Teneros. He was VP Field Operations at TopSpin Communications (acquired by Cisco) and EVP at NetScalar (acquired by Citrix). Conte was VP of Sales and Marketing at Cobalt Networks and a key member of the executive management team that led Cobalt’s IPO in 1999. He played a major part in its success, culminating in a $2 billion acquisition by Sun in 2000. Experience prior to Cobalt includes VP Worldwide Sales and Channels at Dynamic Pictures (acquired by 3dlabs) and VP Sales at Wyse Technologies (acquired by Dell).\n\nMcVey comes to Scale from Permabit, where he was SVP Product Operations. An accomplished technology executive with over 20 years experience in both domestic and international product management, software engineering and operations management, McVey has a record of driving market share, revenue and profit growth – all while building valuable products and successful engineering teams. Previously, he was the SVP at Avamar Technologies (acquired by EMC), where he transformed product management and engineering teams into leading providers of quality solutions. He also served in executive roles at Symantec, Computer Associates, Cheyenne Software and Novell.\n\n“Scale is positioned to dramatically change the IT industry and the way in which IT administrators, CIOs and technology directors run their infrastructures,” said Bill Gurley, General Partner at Benchmark Capital and Scale Computing board member. “The ability of Scale to attract and attain top executive talent prior to the launch of HC3 is a testament to the excitement and promise of this disruptive virtualization technology.”\n\nEVP and GM of Worldwide Field Operations, Conte, will report directly to Scale CEO, Jeff Ready. He will be responsible for Scale’s customer-facing functions including all sales, channel, distribution management, business development, marketing and operations activities. Conte will lead collaboration efforts in these areas to increase sales and revenue, as well as provide overall guidance, direction and strategy for new business and continued market growth.\n\nAs SVP of Products and Technology at Scale, McVey will also report directly to Ready. He will be responsible for product and technology strategy for all products, overseeing the product management, development QA and support organizations. McVey will lead the engineering and development teams, ensuring the creation of quality products that are both differentiated and aligned with mid-market demand and opportunities.\n\nTo learn more about Scale Computing, visit www.scalecomputing.com or call 877-SCALE-59.\n\nAbout Scale Computing"
