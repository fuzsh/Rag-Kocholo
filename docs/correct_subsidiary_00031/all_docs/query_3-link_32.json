Together, Cisco and AppDynamics will deliver visibility across the network, data center, security and applications and drive digital transformation that improves customer experiences.\n\nAs digital experiences get simpler for consumers, they get more complex for companies trying to stay ahead of customer expectations. The rise of connected devices, distributed architectures, and multi-clouds have increased the complexity of application environments. Companies need insight into the health of every application and every transaction in order to keep up with the pace of change.\n\nAppDynamics empowers the world's largest customers to digitally transform themselves faster and with more confidence. With AppDynamics, enterprises can watch every line of code and understand its impact on user experience and application performance, while providing real-time insight into the digital business. Together with AppDynamics, Cisco will now be able to offer intelligence, correlation and insights at every level of the infrastructure, security and application. This will enable customers to make more informed IT decisions and improve business results.\n\n\"In a digital world, the user experience, application, and business are converged and inseparable. AppDynamics sits at this intersection monitoring the impact of every line of code on business outcomes,\" said David Wadhwani, current chief executive officer, AppDynamics. \"By joining forces with Cisco, we're able to double down on our vision of helping companies overcome the complexity of modern software so they can deliver exceptional customer experiences and drive better business performance.\"\n\n\"We acquired AppDynamics because they are a market leader in a category that will be a cornerstone for how enterprises drive their business forward,\" said Rowan Trollope, senior vice president and general manager, Internet of Things (IoT) and Applications, Cisco. \"Together, AppDynamics and Cisco will be the only company that can deliver complete visibility spanning from the infrastructure to application to end user.\"\n\nIn its last fiscal period as an independent company, AppDynamics saw year over year revenue growth of over 50%, with approximately 75% of last year's product revenue purely subscription-based*. The company has enjoyed significant success and customer traction, including:\n\n● Continued growth with customer wins with the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Vodafone, and Wells Fargo\n\n● Introduction of breakthrough product innovation including Business iQ, a new App iQ performance engine, and Microservices iQ, a new performance engine in the App iQ Platform\n\n● New partnerships with Microsoft for delivery of advanced support for real-time monitoring digital businesses in Microsoft Azure cloud environments, and AppDynamics for ServiceNow to enable companies to proactively manage enterprise applications to deliver exceptional business uptime\n\n● Significant industry accolades, including being named a leader in Gartner's 2016 Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring Suites, San Francisco's Best Technology Work Culture, and top 10 of Forbes 2016 World's Best Cloud Companies List\n\nAppDynamics will continue to be led by David Wadhwani as a new software business unit in Cisco's IoT and Applications business, reporting to senior vice president Rowan Trollope. As part of Cisco, AppDynamics will serve a critical role in helping drive Cisco's continued transformation into a software company.
