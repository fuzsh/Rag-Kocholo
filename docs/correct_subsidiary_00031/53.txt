Established in 1984, Cisco Systems, Inc. has evolved into a global technology conglomerate specializing in networking hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment. The company was founded by Leonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner, who developed the first multi-protocol router, a device pivotal to the functioning of the modern internet. Cisco's innovative technologies have played a crucial role in shaping the infrastructure of the internet.

Cisco actively monitors its trademarks and has been involved in legal actions to protect its brand integrity. The company has filed trademark lawsuits against entities engaging in activities that could potentially infringe upon its intellectual property. In 2007, shortly before Apple's launch of the iPhone, Cisco owned the trademark for "iPhone" through its subsidiary, Linksys (acquired by Cisco in 2003). However, Apple announced its iPhone, leading to a legal dispute between the two tech giants. Cisco had already been using the iPhone name for a range of VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) phones. Eventually, both companies reached an agreement, allowing Apple to use the iPhone name while both agreed to explore opportunities for interoperability in areas such as security, consumer and enterprise communication. Cisco has been involved in numerous domain name disputes, where entities register domain names that infringe on trademarks or are used in bad faith. In one instance, Cisco filed a complaint against a cybersquatter who had registered domains using variations of Cisco's trademarked terms to redirect users to unrelated websites or offer the domains for sale.
