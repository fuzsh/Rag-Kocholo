        "text": "WHKY-TV, virtual channel 14 (UHF digital channel 40), is an independent television station licensed to Hickory, North Carolina, United States and serving the northwestern corner of the Charlotte media market, a region locally referred to as \"The Unifour\". The station is owned by Long Communications, LLC, and is sister to radio station WHKY (1290 AM & 102.3 FM). WHKY-TV's studios are located on Main Avenue SE in Hickory. Its primary transmitter is located on Baker Mountain in southwestern Catawba County, with a secondary transmitter in the unincorporated area of Newell in northeastern Mecklenburg County (just northeast of the Charlotte city limits).\n\nOn cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum channel 7 in the Hickory area and channel 18 in the Charlotte area (CW affiliate WCCB, which broadcasts over the air on virtual channel 18, is carried by Spectrum on cable channel 5 in Hickory and channel 11 in Charlotte). It is not presently carried by AT&T U-verse in the Charlotte market. Google Fiber carried the station until July 1, 2017. WHKY is also available on cable in Mountain City, Tennessee, which is part of the Tri-Cities television market.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe station first signed on the air on February 14, 1968; WHKY holds the distinction of being the oldest independent station in the state of North Carolina. (Charlotte's WCTU-TV channel 36, now NBC affiliate WCNC-TV, was the first independent station in North Carolina, signing on eight months before WHKY-TV.) During the 1980s, WHKY-TV aired Major League Baseball games from the Cincinnati Reds. In 2002, WHKY-TV installed two new antennas: one for its digital signal and one which replaced its older analog antenna. The latter antenna's installation helped to increase WHKY-TV's analog signal coverage into the far northern corner of Mecklenburg County. As a result, the station was granted a must-carry claim, allowing it to be added to Time Warner Cable's systems in the Charlotte area; the station also began identifying as \"Hickory/Charlotte\" in its on-air legal identifications.\n\nIn 2004, WHKY-TV boosted its analog transmitter's power to 2 million watts. In June 2006, the station began to be carried on Dish Network and DirecTV's Charlotte area local station lineups, expanding its reach to cover two million people in North and South Carolina. The station's digital transmitter was relocated to Baker Mountain in the fall of 2011, with its effective radiated power increasing to 950,000 watts (equivalent to 4.75 million watts in analog); the station also launched a fill-in translator, whose transmitter is located just north of Charlotte (near the Charlotte Motor Speedway).\n\nTV stations in North Carolina Independent stations Religious stations Spanish-language stations Other stations WSKY, Manteo/Hampton Roads/Norfolk/Virginia Beach WRAY/WLXI, Wake Forest/Greensboro WSOC-DT2, Charlotte WFPX, Archer Lodge WILM-LD, Wilmington WHFL-CD, Goldsboro WUVC/WTNC-LD, Fayetteville/Durham WNCR-LD, Tarboro WHKY, Hickory WGTB-CD, Charlotte WRTD-CD, Raleigh WARZ-CD, Smithfield WGSR-LD, Reidsville WHWD-LD/WDMC-LD, Statesville/Charlotte WNCB-LD/WIRP-LD, Fayetteville WTMH-LD, Kinston WUBX-CD, Durham WWIW-LD, Raleigh/Durham WHEH-LD, Lumberton WAXN, Kannapolis"
