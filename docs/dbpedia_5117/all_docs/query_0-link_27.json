DAVID MIDDELTON,* (* Department Editor.)W20EN\n\nLEFT> One of the original 2-inch Iconoscope amateur television camera units. Circuit details were almost identical to those described in October, 1940, QST.\n\nGUIDED-MISSILES have long been a dream of the fighting services. One obstacle in the path of their research was the lack of a\n\nsuitable and effective \"eye\" in the controlled missile that could scan the scene and transmit this intelligence to the control operator who could then correct for any possible deviation in direction.\n\nSuch an \"eye\" was finally supplied in the form of compact, light-weight, expendable television camera units which could be attached to or installed in a remotely-controlled missile such as a robot bomber, a glide bomb or a high-angle bomb. Two outstanding facts become evident in an\n\nanalysis of the background of one such equipment. The first includes the inquisitiveness and ingenuity of the radio amateur that led him to delve into the mysteries of television. The second demonstrates the foresight and courage shown in QST's program to present amateur television in a manner designed to stimulate the radio amateur's activities along these lines.\n\nThese two features combined to produce the type of compact, light-weight military missile-borne television camera equipment\n\nshown in the photographs.\n\nFrom the radio amateur's laboratories\n\ncame the incentive. the original designs. applications and construction technique and radio amateurs initiated, nurtured, developed and carried through a program of research, development and production of television camera equipment in the Electronic Division of Remington Rand at Middletown, Conn.\n\nAmong the first amateur television transmission experiments were those made by W1BCR, about 1932. This station transmitted television\n\npictures on 160 meters utilizing a 48-hole scanning disc. These signals were received by various New England amateurs. including Philip S. Rand, W1DBM. Television transmissions were directed to definite stations and these stations answered back on 160-meter 'phone and described the character of the picture received. In those days it was considered an exceptional feat if the receiving station could identify and describe any details of the received images. Rand said recently, \"I'll never forget the thrill when, at the end of a Falmouth Radio Club meeting at my shack, we tuned in on 160 meters for a few QSOs. Upon hearing the characteristic buzzsaw note I switched in the neon tube and after synchronizing the scanning disc we saw through a magnifying glass, my call, W1DBM, spelled out in big characters. W1BCR was 'calling' me by television! 1 answered on 160-meter 'phone and he replied by televising some Mickey Mouse cartoons in black and white. ,.\n\nIn the latter part of August, 1940, while Rand was in Washington, he made inquiries on the possibility of controlling, by radio, bombs and other missiles so that they might be directed to their targets more accurately than with a bombsight. W1DBM had read Sherman's article in QST on a new electronic television transmitting system for the amateur and also Lamb's article on a new iconoscope for amateur\n\ntelevision cameras. During a discussion with a naval officer concerning the possibility of guiding a bomb by radio remote control, Rand was told \"that this would not be feasible due to the difficulty in seeing the falling bomb from a plane and hence the difficulty of estimating its probable striking point.\" This original opinion later proved incorrect. (The Army recently announced successful remote-controlled bombs known as the Azon and Razon. The difficulty in seeing bombs fall from the plane was overcome through the use of a smoke flare in the bomb.)\n\nLeft to right -Philip S. Rand, WIDBM, James J. Lamb, WIAL, and Joseph Brustman, ex-OEI34. Rand's arm rests on the first model of the 4-inch Orthicon television camera developed by this trio. WIAL is holding the latest model incorporating. 2.inch Vericon pick-up tube. This unit, combined with the pulse box held by Brustman, makes up the \"latest word\" in compact television camera equipment.\n\nAs Rand sat there having his remote-controlled bomb idea picked to bits he recalled his amateur television interest and amateur television's recent publicity in QST. He countered that if a television camera could be built small enough to be put in the nose of the bomb then the bombardier would not have to worry about visually following the bomb in its fall but could see, on a television screen in his plane, the exact spot at which the bomb was hitting.\n\nRand returned home, approached company officials, and was assigned the job of building an amateur television outfit to test the feasibility of building television cameras small enough to fit into a bomb. Due to the military secrecy surrounding such projects, Rand was unaware that research groups, having vast resources and engineering personnel, were also engaged in the development of television camera equipment for missile-borne use. In true amateur fashion Rand started on the project without the aid of outside sponsorship and satisfactory equipment was actually developed before any agency was sufficiently interested to offer any aid.\n\nA project had been started by H. J. Rand (W1DBM's nephew) utilizing' a two-inch amateur \"ike\" for picking up objects through fog and darkness by infrared rays. Experiments determined that the two-inch amateur \"ike\" was not particularly sensitive in the infrared region and therefore was of no value for this purpose and this equipment was made available and the television camera project got under way in September, 1940 with W1DBM and H. J. Rand as co-workers. .\n\nTests disclosed that the two-inch amateur\n\n\"ike\" lacked sensitivity and definition for high quality pictures. This operating defect was brought home forcefully late one afternoon when demonstrating the equipment. There was insufficient light outdoors to get a decent pick-up. However, upon tuning in NBC's television they saw an excellent outdoor picture of a football game. Upon investigation it was learned that NBC was using an Orthicon type of pick-up tube. Samples of these tubes were procured and work started on a small camera utilizing this more sensitive pick-up. By now, the project had grown considerably and additional personnel was required. J. J. Lamb, W1AL, of QST, had been working on amateur television and was a logical choice. He was engaged on a consulting basis and later secured a leave of absence from the ARRL to devote full time to the project. Next came Joseph Brustman, ex-OEI34, a native of Vienna, Austria, a man with wide television experience. H. J. Rand dropped out to begin work on another project. Later he joined the. Army Air Forces. Toward the end of the war, with the rank of major, Rand actually controlled television guided missiles in the ETO.\n\nThe first model utilizing a four-inch Orthicon was completed in the spring of 1941 and given vehicular tests transmitting back to the laboratory on 105 Mc. This camera unit weighed about 65 pounds as compared to the then existing \"portable\" commercial equipment comprised of six or seven large-size suitcases weighing a total of some 700 pounds.\n\nThis midget television equipment was demonstrated to the armed forces but they did not appear particularly enthusiastic about such a \"fantastic idea.\" However, the OSRD and the NDRC thought it worth while. They could not sponsor a completed project but if a smaller and lighter camera could be made it would be a new development which NDRC could sponsor.\n\nA new type of Orthicon pick-up tube had been experimentally made by Dr. H. B. DeVore of RCA, and this tube was used in a considerably smaller television camera subsequently developed for and demonstrated to the NDRC by the Middletown group.\n\nEarly in 1942, Vernon Chambers, W1JEQ, obtained a leave of absence from QST and joined Rand and Lamb, as did Harry Whittemore, W1BR.\n\nBy late spring it became apparent that more of the two-inch Orthicons would not be available from RCA, so it became necessary to manufacture them and Marshall P. Wilder, W2KJL, started the production of the desired pick-up tubes, assisted by Frank Norman, W1JZB. Daniel Smithwick, jr., W1NKA, went to work on construction of the cameras as did Calvin Bennett, W1KHL. August, 1943 brought George Grammer, W1DF (obtained on leave of absence from QST) and later Milton Bloomquist, ex W2BAI, joined Wilder's vacuum-tube section. John S. Muskatallo, W1BFW, and Thomas S. Pugarelli, ex-W2LWL, also were included in the project. Approximately fifty workers, men and women, were finally engaged in the manufacture and development of this equipment.\n\nPhil Gildersleeve, W1CJD, city editor of the Middletown Press and famous QST cartoonist, holds one of the 2-inch Vericon cameras during a recent demonstration of the equipment to the press. The cord stretched along the unit is part of the automatic iris control system.\n\nAfter the Germans began using their robot bombs the Army and the Navy became intensely interested in remotely-controlled guided missiles and the Middletown group was given contracts by both services to develop still smaller and lighter weight units.\n\nVarious models built concluded with the latest and smallest model comprised of two pieces; one, a long slim box containing the camera and the video amplifier and a smaller square box housing the pulse and synchronizing signal generator. The outstanding characteristics of these units are their small, compact and light-weight construction and features such as the automatic iris control and the automatic focusing control. These units will stand temperatures from -500 to +500 C. as well as centrifugal force up to 10 Gs. Circuit details are still shrouded in military secrecy.\n\nBoth the Army and Navy have disclosed some of the uses to which equipment of this type has been subjected, including details on the high angle television bomb, the glider bomber, (called a \"Glomb\") and the television-equipped robot plane.\n\nOne actual use of the equipment might be as follows: A suitable bomb (maybe 2000 pounds) has a streamlined housing strapped under it. This contains the camera head. A wing of sufficient lifting capability, to maintain a glide of possibly 6 to 1, is strapped on top. Fastened to the rear of the bomb is a fuselage containing the pulse box, transmitter and a remote-control receiver together with motors and solenoids for controlling the rudders and fins which project from the rear of the fuselage. This is the so-called\" glide bomb\" which is carried to within gliding range of the target. The bombardier switches on the television apparatus and when he is within gliding range of the target he releases the glider. At this time the bomber circles away and gets out of range of enemy AA fire and fighter planes. The operator ill the bomber synchronizes his television receiver with the transmitter and holds it synchronized while the bombardier, looking at a separate monitor 'scope in a darkened part of the cabin, throws switches on his remote-control apparatus and changes the glide bomb's path - up or down or right or left so that the target is centered on the crosshairs on his picture 'scope. Meanwhile the bomb, gliding at a speed of some 200 or 300 m.p.h., approaches the target. The target looms larger and larger on the 'scope in the plane and the bombardier makes minute corrections as various cross winds throw the bomb off course. Suddenly the ground seems to leap up and hit the observer in the face. The scene disappears in\n\nan enlarging close-up as the camera is destroyed. And so is the target!\n\nThe camera unit can be installed in the nose of a robot plane, complete with motors and all the necessary controls. The robot is flown off the ground by remote radio control or by a pilot who parachutes to earth after flying the plane off the ground. The two planes now fly hundreds or even thousands of miles until they come to the target area. Then the operator flies the robot plane, carrying a heavy charge of explosives, right into the target, guiding the robot by the view of the area ahead as received over the television circuit.\n\nTelevision may also be used in the so-called high-angle bomb carrying a television camera in front of the\" war head\" and with the associated equipment in the bomb's tail portion. This bomb has no wings but has controlling devices on the tail. The bomb is dropped from 25,000 to 30,000 feet by a standard bomb sight and theoretically would hit the target without any remote control. However, unknown cross winds and unknown temperatures at lower levels often cause high elevation bombs to miss their target, therefore the bombardier utilizes television to see in what direction the bomb deviates and then corrects its trajectory by remote control.\n\nMany amusing incidents occurred in connection with the development and testing of this equipment. One day when parked on a hill about five miles away from the lab, W1DBM tried frantically to raise the lab on the 112-Mc. talkback circuit However, those viewing the images had become so engrossed that they paid no attention to the voice circuit. Rand then thought of a simple way of \"raising\" them. He got out of the truck, walked around to the front and pointed first at the camera and then at his ear, meanwhile making talking motions with his mouth. The lab called him before he could get back into the truck! Another day while demonstrating the equipment W1DBM was driving with the camera turned on. The television camera, mounted inside a station wagon, had its lens about two inches away from the windshield. Suddenly it began to rain so hard that the windshield wipers were ineffective. Rand stopped because he couldn't see beyond the radiator cap and the talk-back speaker barked, \"Don't stop there! Continue to your location.\" Rand informed his base that he couldn't see where he was going due to the rain. They replied, \"That's funny, we can see all right.\"\n\nThe windshield, so close to the lens that it was out of focus, acted more like a neutral density filter and while it cut the light in half, it still permitted vision outside the windshield.\n\nOn one occasion during a flight in the Connecticut valley the test plane seemed to be losing altitude so the pilot was ordered to climb back up to his original altitude. The pilot radioed back that he couldn't see the ground through the haze and so would continue to come down until he could establish his position. But he halted his descent when he learned that a good picture of the Connecticut River was being transmitted to the ground and the men on the ground could give him instructions as to his course.\n\nMany problems had to be solved and serious difficulties overcome before a television camera could be made as small and as light-weight as the final models shown in the accompanying photographs. One of the tough problems was that of automatically adjusting the iris in the lens to the various changing light conditions encountered by an airborne television camera. Another serious problem was the constant battle to reduce size and weight. This was so vital that one of the slogans of the lab was, \"Cut it in half!\" The engineers were constantly on the watch for smaller tubes, resistors, condensers and other components and searching for new layouts which could reduce the physical size and weight. Another important detail was that of maintaining the right temperature range. It was necessary to install thermostatically-controlled heated jackets on the lens and on some of the other components before the temperature problem was licked. The equipment was required to withstand all the abuse put upon airborne radio through the severe vibration and high noise levels. Extensive tests on vibration tables and in acoustical boxes were conducted and, one by one, the offending parts or circuits were eliminated.\n\nProbably the most important problem was that of dispensing with the usual three or four television engineers and operators that, in the past, accompanied so-called \"portable\" apparatus. This camera unit had to be fully automatic as the only adjustment permitted was that of turning on the power supply.\n\nBut these perplexing problems were overcome by this group of radio amateurs in their development of television camera equipment. Inspired by amateur television experiments, developed and \"followed-through\" by amateurs, this type of equipment may well prove to have many useful functions in a peacetime world, in spite of the fact that it was originally conceived to aid our country in battle. It is truly another worth-while contribution made by the radio amateur in the battle of the laboratory and the production floor.\n\n-end-\n\nBefore the Mini-cam news\n\nvideo camera there was...\n\nGordon Yoder\n\n16mm Bach-Auricon Sound-On-Film Camera.\n\nProfessional CINE TELEVISION CAMERA. This is an original Gordon Yoder, model 31507. Yoder, who died in October, 2005, was the owner and operator of Gordon Yoder Inc. in Dallas, Texas. He developed a modification for the 16mm Bach-Auricon sound-on-film camera, expanding its film capacity to hold larger film magazines, incorporating a transistorized magnetic sound recording system, and using 12 volt synch motors. Many considered the Yoder camera a standard of the news film industry.\n\nYoders converted camera meant that photojournalists could shoot longer than 2 minutes and 45 seconds. Before magnetic sound on film was invented, cameras werent portable. Sound was recorded optically. This required a big, heavy conversion box. TV cameramen had to carry not only heavy battery packs (lead-acid, because Ni-Cads had not yet been invented), but also an inverter to convert the electricity to alternating current (AC). The Yoder-converted cameras, and the CP-16s that followed, revolutionized the way news was covered.\n\nThis functional Camera weighs 10 lbs. Dimensions: 9 ¼ x 5 x 7. This rare Camera comes in its original 27 x 10 ¾ x 15 ¾, 12 lbs trunk (when empty). The auction also includes 5 film canisters, Two (2) 200mm Telephoto P. Angenieux Paris Lenses. One lens is a P. Angenieux-ZOOM, TYPE 10 X 12A No. 1209506; F.12-120mm 1:2.2. It is equipped with 72 M 9 TIFFEN Adapter Ring, Series 9, U.S.A. Second lens is the same except for serial number 1255457. Both Lens have EMS TV LEFF II hand written on them.\n\nAlso included are two (2) All Transistor High Fidelity 16mm SOUND-ON-FILM AMPLIFIERS Filmagnetics by Bach Auricon, Filter, and BASF Blank SP52 Tapes. This camera originally belonged to KVOS-TV which can be seen in Bellingham, Washington, and British Columbia, Canada. The Camera works.
