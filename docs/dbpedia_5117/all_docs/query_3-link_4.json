        "text": "The Many Powerful Benefits of Connected TV to Advertisers\n\nWith traditional TV seeing an increasing plummet, our advertising behavior has seen a paradigm shift. This shift is accelerated by the growth of CTV or Connected TV advertising. With CTV, you have the ability to watch your favorite shows anytime, at your convenience.\n\nCTV (connected TVs) are smart TVs that have the ability to deliver video content through an internet connection on devices such as Roku, Samsung and other Smart TV’s, Chromecast, Amazon Firestick, Apple TV and major gaming consoles, such as Xbox and PlayStation. If you’re buying a big screen TV these days, you’re most likely buying a Smart TV. This is a television with a built-in connection to the internet.\n\nThe video is delivered to viewers through media company APPs like ABC, CBS, NBC, Paramount+, Discovery, ESPN, Fox Nation, Hulu, Prime Video, HBO Now, Fubo, etc…\n\nThe programming type that is delivered through CTV are long-form episodic television programming that is either live or on-demand like Grey’s Anatomy (all seasons) and Law & Order as well as live events like The NBA Playoffs or MTV Music Video Awards. Other live programming includes most of everything you can currently watch on linear TV like ML Baseball, CNN News, Housewives, etc… but it’s through the designated app on devices as mentioned previously: Roku, Samsung Smart TV’s, Amazon Firestick, Apple TV, etc…, ads can be served within commercial breaks to a targeted household and audience.\n\nReach The Right Audience…at the right time, every time.\n\nConnected TV is expected to continue increasing at a rapid rate, eventually surpassing linear television, by providing viewers with a controlled watching experience with access to high-quality content that allows them to pick what they want to watch when they want to watch it.\n\nWith Connected TV advertising, advertisers can assess their target audience and reach them at the right time – generating more traffic and gathering more potential clients.\n\nIt Is Light On The Pocket\n\nCTV advertising is an opportunity for advertisers to save chunks of impression costs. Only one person sees an ad when they watch it on their personal Internet-connected device, whereas advertising on television might be seen by multiple individuals.\n\nBrand Resonance\n\nCommercials are broadcast at a considerably reduced frequency or controlled frequency, and usually only one ad at a time. In support of this, recent research revealed that when compared to completion rates on other digital platforms, CTV consumers complete 98 percent of video commercials.\n\nBecause viewers aren’t inundated with commercial after commercial vying for their attention, they’re more likely to give undivided attention to an ad and remember the brand. When compared to desktop and mobile viewers, CTV viewers demonstrated greater levels of brand recognition and favorability, according to the same survey. Showing an ad to a more responsive viewer increases the likelihood that they will become a customer.\n\nThe same ad is viewed by several individuals at the same time, lowering the cost per impression for the advertiser. This renders it a budget-friendly option for the advertiser.\n\nEnhanced User Experience\n\nConnected TV allows for full-screen delivery of targeted, highly customized, HD-quality advertisements with stereo sound. As a consequence of both sight and sound, better ad quality enhances brand loyalty and increases brand visibility.\n\nFurthermore, advertisements on connected TV provide a natural large-screen experience with excellent ad viewability. It mimics the look and feel of regular cable television. Consumers not only pay greater attention to CTV advertisements which are customized to them, but they also watch them for longer periods of time.\n\nThe 2023 “Big Screen” without Crushing Budgets\n\nThe entire landscape of digital advertising is being taken over by CTV – and that is largely because of the option of getting your commercials on the big screen without the large price tag, reaching both cord-cutters and highly engaged viewers in real time!\n\nMoreover, there are more than 164 million U.S. consumers viewing video content via connected TV devices, and a forecast of up to 204 million viewers by the end of 2022. 80% of households that have a cable TV service also watch shows via CTV.\n\nIn comparison with traditional TV advertising, CTV allows for more precise targeting and inventory selection, resulting in a more efficient route for reaching a larger market.\n\nSimply put, CTV is the present and future medium for powerful digital advertising.\n\nWith CTV gaining mass appeal across the world, we can expect to see a complete digital renaissance in the coming years. It is the present and the future medium for the most powerful digital advertising."
