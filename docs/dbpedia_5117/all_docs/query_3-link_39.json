        "text": "October 29, 2009\n\nReno - I had no idea that you had such a sense of humor - or that you were such an organ player. Why have you kept your 'candle under a bushel?' - at least from me? I am now truly a fan.\n\nI was looking around the internet trying to determine the name of the men's store in Downtown Charlotte - across from the S&W Cafeteria on West Trade Street when I found the website \"BT Memories.\" That is truly a great website. I have spent way too much time listening to the recording on that website - I especially (as an old 'farm boy' who shoveled a lot of manure and drove the manure spreader over many a field) have enjoyed the 'Grady Cole' advertisement for the 'manure loader.' I have also sent a link to this site to a number of other old 'farm boys' in my acquaintance.\n\nOf course I grew up with WBT and then WBTV when television finally came to Caroleen - and to Cliffside. I clearly remember standing on the sidewalk in Forest City watching the television in the window of the furniture store up there. I also remember that as part of my job as a 'somewhat' delivery boy for the Lowe's Furniture Store that I climbed on many roofs in Cliffside to install tv antenna. [TV reception was especially difficult for some of the houses down on the river side of the road going to Boiling Springs. Charles Robins would watch the tv in the house and I would maneuver the antenna around to get the best WBTV signall possible - WBTV was the only television station signal available in Caroleen and Cliffside at that time.]\n\nThanks for the memories. If there are any other 'hidden' websites how about clueing me in to them.\n\nBy the way I did find the name of the men's store. It was Ed Mellon's Clothing. It was detailed in the story Jack Burney \"Downtown Charlotte in the '40s\"\n\nI graduated from Caroleen Elementary School in a brand new blue suit - the very first suit I ever had - that my Dad purchased for me at Ed Mellon's Store.\n\n—Leon Neal\n\nRaleigh, NC\n\nOctober 25, 2009\n\nI discovered your fabulous web site BT Memories today and it brought back a treasure trove of memories.\n\nI used to own a trucking company in Charlotte and would go out with my drivers to various places between Maine and Miami and one of the great treats WBT offered us was Larry James on the overnight Carolina Country Show.\n\nLarry had a character on the show named Monroe Slump who reminded me of a cross between Festus on Gunsmoke and that guy who sang Please Mr. Custer. I know it was Larry doing the voice but it sure sounded like two people.\n\nI talked to the then Program Director Andy Bickel and he revealed the secret that Monroe was on tape and that was how their conversations overlapped. Andy confided to me that Larry probably had the most entertaining show on WBT but that he was so shy in person. Larry came on after the great Henry Boggan and sometimes Henry would hang around and cut up with Larry and it was such a treat.\n\nI was watching the Country Music Association Awards one night in 1978 because I knew Larry had been nominated for an award. Sure enough Johnny Cash announced his name Larry James WBT Charlotte! He was the 1978 Deejay Of The Year.\n\nMany of us were so full of pride that someone from our city could win such a prestigious award. A day or two later on the front page of the Charlotte Observer was Larry, or LJ as Monroe called him, thumbing through a stack of 45s. I spent some enjoyable nights listening to Hello Henry then Larry James. When LJ lost his radio voice because a doctor goofed during vocal cord surgery it broke my heart and the hearts of my workers.\n\nHe left for parts unknown and nobody that followed him ever gave us that kind of entertainment. I wish I knew if Larry did well after leaving WBT.\n\nAgain, thanks for the wonderful web site.\n\n—Casey Ward\n\nSeptember 9, 2009\n\nAll the wonderful story telling about the old days at WBTV and 60th anniversary has me reflecting about the role WBTV played in my life starting as a child growing up in Gastonia, gathering at neighbor's homes on Jackson Road when I was about five years old to watch Hopalong Cassidy, Lone Ranger, and Boston Blackie and then getting our first TV set in 1951. Doug Mayes, Clyde McLean, Betty Feezer, Pat Lee, Arthur Smith, Fred Kirby, et al. were all like movie stars to me growing up (if I ever did).\n\nWhile attending Clemson I happened upon a party one night following the North-South Double Header in Charlotte at Mark Conrad and Sam Fuller's apartment at Hamilton House. They were total strangers but I remember sitting on their couch and asking what they did for a living and then asking 'how'd ya get those jobs,' thinking how lucky they were. Fast forward about three years and I'm out of college working for Procter and Gamble in Charlotte and the phone rings. Tom Cookerly wants Jim Babb and Bud Coggins to hire P&G trained sales people and would I be interested in working for WBTV? Are you kidding, little old Gastonia hick me working with the giants of broadcasting, and I didn't know what giants they really were. I was there for only two years -1969-'71 - but those two years were my most formative, and the lessons learned and friends made there are still with me today.\n\nNow 40 years later I'm the general mangler (appropriate term for me coined by Markus T Conrad) of a WBTV type, old-line NBC station. Like WBTV, WGAL started out in an old downtown building in Lancaster PA (smallest city in the nation with a TV station at the time) and moved into a state of the art TV studio in the mid 50's. Unlike WBTV, WGAL has maintained its market dominance, thank heavens, and have had the good fortune to stay in touch with former employees and invite them back to events every year. On March 18th this year WGAL celebrated its 60th anniversary with an hour special which just won a Telly Award. We did not have a big party but we did invite our current and past employees to a special screening in our big studio and everyone seemed to have a great time.\n\nThank you all for allowing me to share the halls at #1 Julian Price Place. I was a very lucky SOB to have had that opportunity and owe much of what success I have had in this crazy business to what you taught me way back when.\n\nHappy 60th anniversary to all who made WBTV such a magical and fun place to be.\n\n—Paul Quinn\n\nWGAL President/ General Manager\n\nLancaster, PA\n\nMarch 7, 2009\n\nMy name is Tracey Copeland-Horton and I am the only child of Gordon Phillip Copeland & (formally) Norma Faye Dallas Monnett. Both of my parents worked for Jefferson-Standard in the 1960's. The television station is where they met, fell in love and then later, married. I have heard so many stories from them about their time at WBTV. The ones that I remember most are about when my parents would, on occasion, have to go in front of the camera to fill in or do little skits when the regular actors were unavailable, or the time in 1968 or 69, when we returned to NC for a visit and I 'starred' in a local commercial for Valentine's Day candy (I was 2 or 3 yrs. old), and about the time, in 1965, that my mother and her friend, Vivian, rode on the Thanksgiving Day Tweetsie Railroad float, both dressed as Can Can Girls. I recall how my father talked about getting to watch my mom be on TV.\n\nMy father passed away in 1994, at the age of 66 and my mother, now close to 70, lives in Eden, North Carolina. It would mean a great deal to me to find any film footage or photos of them while they were at the TV station.\n\nMy father, Gordon Phillip Copeland, worked at Jefferson-Standard from 1964 to Feb. 1966 as an Account Executive and my mother, Norma Faye Monnett worked there from 1963 - Feb. 1966. She started off as a secretary, but was promoted to traffic operations manager. In either late 1963 or early 1964 she moved to High Point for 6 months to work for WGHB-TV, so that she be closer to her recently widowed mother. When her mother remarried in 1964, she returned to WBTV and worked as the secretary to Bob Rieison until she and my father moved to California in 1966.\n\nI know that I have, in storage, at least one office 'brochure' from that time highlighting various employees accomplishments. I believe that there are some photos, as well. As soon as I am able to get these items out of storage and go through them, I will forward copies of these to you for your website.\n\n—Tracey Lee Copeland Horton\n\nJuly 21, 2008\n\nI don't think I ever met Betty Feezer when I worked at FM. In fact, I don't recall even seeing her but once in the station as I was wandering around one day. My grandfather was a huge fan of hers. He owned a sausage packing business in north Mecklenburg County, and he arranged his work hours to allow him to watch her show every day. He should have been advertising on her program, but he intentionally kept his business very small to keep the meat-packer's union out. He's been dead for 35 years, but my mother still laughs about how he wouldn't miss her show for anything.\n\nLike most young'uns who grew up around Charlotte, I was a big fan of Fred Kirby. I saw him at Tweetsie Railroad once as a child, riding Calico and shooting at the raiding Indians. Then I met him once, and that was in the FM control room when he was roaming around visiting people in the building. What a nice guy! He treated me as though we were old friends. I don't recall ever seeing him without that big broad smile on his face.\n\nI didn't get to know Jim Patterson, but I do recall when he would come upstairs to FM to cut up and chew the fat with you.\n\nI remember that towards the end of my summer at FM, the station had a big employee cookout. I was allowed to bring my girl friend. I don't think we saw you, Don [LeBreque], Matilda [Massingill], or anyone else from the station that I already knew, but we were fortunate enough to sit at a table across from Gil Stamper and his wife. He was already way up in age if I recall, but he couldn't have been nicer. You would never have known that he was a pretty famous local TV personality. I think the station was full of people like him.\n\nI appreciate you adding me to you BTmemories network.\n\n—Mike Henderson\n\nApril 29, 2008\n\nI just wanted to chime in with my memories of working at WBT from 1985-1990 I hope it will give you some prespective on the latter days. I leave it up to you to decide if you want to include my comments or not. I won't be offended; there are no ego problems here!\n\nI came to Charlotte to work afternoon drive at WSOC in the fall of 1981, but everything I knew about Charlotte I learned by listening to WBT while living in Fort Lauderdale. Henry Bogan painted a picture of Charlotte that was very appealing he was probably the best promotion the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce ever had!\n\nThough the years I got to know Henry while I worked at WSOC AM 930 and he couldn't have been nicer to me. Somehow Henry would even promote my show on WBT! I'm sure management would not have liked that if they had heard him, but Henry acted like WBT was his to do with it what he wanted, and I guess in fact it was.\n\nAfter several failed formats at WSOC, I was shown the door. They decided to stop trying to do anything with WSOC-AM; it just wasn't working. I had made some friends at WSOC-TV and they would occasionally give me TV spots to read. On one of those trips Bill Ellis at WSOC-FM told me that Steve Harmon left the all-night show at WBT and I should get over there and apply. Ellis and James K. Flynn were good friends so there was a pipeline between the two stations. Wow, you didn't have to tell me twice! I went right over there and talked to Program Director Dave Bishop, who explained they were not sure what they were going to do with all nights, they might add Larry King (which they did). However if I wanted to, I could do overnight till the decision was made. Being unemployed (but not for long) I jumped at the chance to ride the big 50,000-watt signal of Charlotte's personality powerhouse. While on the air I used to hear from friends in Miami who were listening and made new friends up and down the east coast including a man who lived 20 miles north of Montreal. The overnight show was all oldies which I have considerable knowlege and interest in, so doing overnights at WBT was a dream come true!\n\nThe dream was short lived because in a couple of months station management had decided to go with Larry King at night. I heard that Larry himself was very interested in landing WBT as an affiliate. Larry's show had been heard in Charlotte on WSOC. If only they had held on to Larry King at WSOC, who knows what might have happened!\n\nFrom my full-time but temporary stint overnight I went to weekends and vacation fill. Hey, I've got my foot in the door and I'm having way too much fun to give up WBT! So, from the rest of 1985 till 1990 I worked whatever shifts I could work. In fact at one point I did three shifts on the weekend: a Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon followed by a Sunday late-night shift.\n\nThe Sunday late night was something that Henry Bogan had started called \"The Sunday Show\" it was all standards and similar to what I had done at WSOC This was the last time I was allowed to pick all my own music. The overnight oldies show was done that way as well. Most people don't realize that radio stations do not let the jocks pick the music, it used to be hand picked by the music director and later done by a computer list. On the \"Sunday Show\" I would play \"Heartaches\" by Ted Weems and tell the story of how Curt Webster, using the power of WBT, made the song a hit all over again some 10 years after it came out. I think when working at WBT you must know about the history of the station and those who came before.\n\nMy fondest moment would have to be the night Jim Patterson came on the \"Sunday Show\" at my invitation to host it with me. First of all I was hesitant to even ask since I knew he had to get up early for the \"Good Morning Show\" on WBTV. Having seen all the pictures around the station of Jim at the turntables I just had to ask. To my surprise he not only consented but seem genuinely pleased that I asked him! We had a great night on the air. I let Jim talk and play anything he wanted. He brought some records with him and he left at Midnight leaving me to do the last hour solo. I thought it was great and hoped to do it again but that was not to be, Jim died a few months later. I remember being on the air the day we heard about his accident. It was a very sad day to be sure.\n\nIt was my good fortune to work with a staff that was pure magic. Bob Simpson, Mike Collins, H.A. Thompson, Henry Boggan, Ray Gooding, Don Russell, James K. Flynn and David Appleford. In news, Scott White, Cleo Crowder and Lee Melvin. In sports, Gary Sparber and Steve Martin.\n\nThat's just a few of the talented people who allowed me to spend some quality time with them. I never had an issue or \"ego problem\" with any of these fine people. Many in fact were very supportive of me, a comparative rookie.\n\nFor me radio will never be quite as good as it was then.\n\nI had a great time at WBT and was happy to be a small part of the station and it's history.\n\n—Mike (Sheridan) Miranda\n\nPS: I still think Don Russell should be on WBT full time!\n\nThe nicest thing for me was to be able to do the top-of-the-hour ID with pride: \"The news voice of the Carolinas, WBT, Charlotte....\"\n\nMarch 11, 2008\n\nThat's Andy Anderson at the switcher, Wade Lawrence seated the camera shading console with back turned toward camera, and Cliff Livingston talking to (a then) young man whom I cannot identify.\n\nThe picture is taken looking back toward an equipment rack in the background. Behind that rack was the film chains room (two of them) with live operators, like Ron Hovis. And, behind the film chair room was the quad VTRs room, where T. Keller Bush presided over five or six large 2-inch tape machines that require \"5 second roll cues\".\n\nTo the right hand side of this photo (roughly the direction Wade Lawrence is turned) was the engineering shop with veterans like Warren Wilson and Harvey Hood.\n\nBill [Napier] is right about what awful color pictures those giant TK-42 cameras made. We had three of these in the larger studio, and two more in the smaller studio where Betty Feezor's kitchen set was located. These monsters required 500 foot-candles of light to work, as compared with about one-fifth that amount (now called \"lumens\") to make beautiful High Definition color pictures with modern equipment. The TK-42's were so heavy... the camera heads themselves, that the pedestals had to use an electric motor to \"boom up\" or down. They barely \"rolled\" and it took a lot of momentum just to get one of these studio cameras moving around the studio floor at all. Therefore, we tended not to.\n\nMost of the shots were from fixed positions for newscasts, the cooking shows, and \"Top 'O The Day.\"\n\nWhen we taped Jim Crockett's \"Championship Wrestling\" (hosted by Big Bill Ward) on Wednesday nights for playback in \"access\" early evening time on Saturday nights... a one-hour live-on-tape circus... we had to use a large industrial motorized wench to raise one of the TK-42's camera heads to go atop a separated raised electric pedestal on top of a heavy duty construction scaffolding to get the wide shots of the temporary wrestling right that had to be erected and torn down in between Wednesday night's 6 and 11p newscasts that were produced from that same studio \"A.\" That included the crew having to pull out bleacher seating for the live audience who lined up at One Julian Price Place every Wednesday afternoon.\n\nHope these memories add some \"color\" and detail to your posting.\n\n—John Hutchinson\n\nBahakel Communications\n\nCharlotte\n\nApril 11, 2007\n\nWell, now that the cows got loose, they only told me about the barn door at BTMemories.com!\n\nI was commissioned to write about WBT's already rather well-told history for the April 2007 edition of Radio Guide magazine. In fact, most of that history is well told in the artifacts you have on BT Memories, but I sure wish I had known about them to include a factoid or two here and there.\n\nAt this very moment, the Radio Guide publisher, Ray Topp, is laying out the Aprial issue and getting it printed for mailing, April will be a tough month for Ray as it is the month of the BIG annual NAB Convention in Las Vegas, which will take a week and more out of the month for him.\n\nSometime after all that, he will put the PDF files of the April edition up on the Radio Guide website, which will be the best place to get them to you...once that is done.\n\nFor my own personal part, I started a radio and later international telecommunicaitons engineering career in the late 1950s down in the Tampa Bay area of Florida.....where WBT was our Conelrad skywave key station, the one we monitored on an old Hammarlund HQ-129X receiver with a carrier alarm after our local Conelrad key station sighed off at night. Many's the Sunday night when my curiosity was piqued at hearing the sign-off announcement that said, \"This is WBT, Charlotte, with WBT Repeater, Shelby, North Carolina....\" Repeater? Hardly any AM stations had a repeater? At the time, not knowing a bit of the WBT story, I wondered why WBT had a repeater. I of course found out more later.\n\nBut. the primary item that piqued me to write to you was the Kurt Webster/Heartaches story. In 1959, I had gone across town down in St. Petersburg, FL to join in the engineering side of opening a new daytime station that featured a Big Band format. The station manager actually ran out in the hall all excited one day to tell us he'd just hired a great Big Band personality for an afternoon DJ. The Big Name was Elmo Tanner, the whistler of \"Heartaches\" for Ted Weems.\n\nSince you mentioned there weren't many famous whistlers, Jack seemed to have a short pang of memory about then, as he apparently recalled Fred Lowery, the blind whistler who had made many records. Jack said, \"Uh-oh....wait a minute! Did I hire the blind guy? Can he run his own board?\"\n\nWell, it turned out that Elmo was quite [well] sighted and he could run his own board and not destroy the budget of our little local daytimer. Elmo, in fact, enjoyed quite a long career in St.Petersburg, ultimately retired there, and had a newspaper article written about him every few years, In the final one just before his death, he said he'd lost all his teeth and couldn't whistle any more.\n\nEverywhere Elmo went, people asked him how to whistle. In fact, he'd tell folks openly that he was not a whistler by trade; that Weems hired him as a vocalist and the whistling part only came about in the arrangement for \"Heartaches.\" It was the only song he ever whistled.\n\nIn fact, Elmo could not whislte very loudly. He said that to do the song live, he'd cup his hands around a microphone and whistle ever so gently across the mike! He did teach me how to warble softly the way he did. and I got to the point of being able to do a fair rendition myself.\n\nAt any rate, I hope there might be something of interest to you in all this, and in the April Radio Guide article when it gets published. We do have a few bits like the Nazis listening to WBT and transatlantic airplane pilots naivgating by it.\n\n—Don Kimberlin\n\nP. S. Egads! You even mentioned Rich Pauley! In the late 50s. he was a mid-day DJ at WTSP in St, Petersburg, FL, whre I was a dewy-eyed Boy Engineer who was thrilled at being permitted to work in the control room. One day, he was gone, and all the other talent was agog, \"Rich landed a job at 'BT!\" I listened to them all in wonderment. It was sad to hear a few years later that Rich apparently died of testicular cancer while in the employ of WBT.\n\nJanuary 29, 2007\n\nI'm relatively young - 50 - but have some very fond and cherished memories of WBTV. When I would come to visit my grandmother in Kannapolis - we lived in Burlington - her huge \"Magnificent Magnavox\" tv/radio/stereo console was tuned to WBTV almost constantly. She watched Betty Feezor as a lead-in to As The World Turns and Guiding Light every single afternoon. I would lounge on her sofa in the evenings watching The Lucy Show, Ed Sullivan, or the Jackie Gleason show with her and my grandfather. On Sundays, it was Fred Kirby after church. And yes, my baby-boomer friends and I can still do the \"high sign\"! We later moved to Charlotte after my parents divorced, and WBTV became a huge part of my life.\n\nI have a huge love of television history and still feel that it was a travesty when the Wilder Building was demolished. I hate it that Lincoln Financial is literally splitting up the family.\n\nA quick and funny side note - when I was a very little girl, I was very timid and shy. The oddest things scared the daylights out of me. Three of them were directly connected to CBS. One was the old endcap, in which the eye opened and closed like the shutter of a camera. I would run screaming from the room, much to my parents' exasperation. The other was the opening theme and graphics from \"The Twilight Zone\". Okay, okay, that one still creeps me out just a little, but back then I'd hide my head under a pillow! The last was watching Ann Sothern wink during the opening credits of \"Private Secretary\". I still haven't figured that one out.\n\nRecently I found a clip of that old endcap online and wondered what in the world could have bothered me so about it - now I get such a kick out of looking at it, along with the old NBC chimes visual.\n\nThanks for your BT memories website, and the great memories!\n\n—Susan Walker\n\nMarch 29, 2006\n\nI can't thank you enough for the BT Memories website, although I'm afraid it has created an itch that can't be scratched enough. Growing up in Charlotte in the 80's and 90's, my dad's radio was always locked in at 1110 AM. Whether we were having breakfast in the kitchen, or riding in the car, there were the voices of Don Russell and James K. Flynn, John Hancock, \"Jeff Pilot,\" Moira Quinn, Mike Collins, Henry Boggan, and many other hosts and news anchors and reporters.\n\nBehind the voices there was the unmistakable \"WBT sound.\" The Skyview traffic sounders, the jingles, and at the top of every hour, Mike Collins letting us know that we were listening to \"the Carolinas broadcasting leader since 1922.. this is the flagship station of Jefferson-Pilot Communications. First in the Southeast, and still leading the way!\"\n\nMy obsession with WBT began on September 22, 1989, when Hurricane Hugo pummeled the Queen City. That happened to be my seventh birthday. There I was huddled with my mom, dad, and sister in the hallway of our home. I asked my dad if there was a tornado outside. He told me to grab my little Fisher-Price Radio out of my room. We turned it on, and there was Don Russell and James K. Flynn, filling us in on the storm outside our home.\n\nI was hooked. I became a WBT listener at the ripe old age of seven. Whenever my dad would call in to one of the shows, I would make a racket in the background. Then, about seven seconds later, I could hear my noise, ever so softly, going out over the airwaves, followed by my dad staring at me, the signal to knock it off. At Skyshow, while everyone would be awed by the fireworks, I would be scanning the nighttime sky, looking for \"Jeff Pilot.\"\n\nAs for TV, it was blasphemy to suggest watching any newscast other than WBTV's.\n\nSo you can imagine how humbled I was that in the spring of 2002, I was hired to work in the WBT newsroom. Now I am working with some of the people I grew up listening to.\n\nHowever, that was the WBT and WBTV of my childhood. Things have changed, some for the better, not so much for others. But the fondness for those days lives on, especially among the people behind the microphone today.\n\n—Chris Miller\n\nNews Anchor\n\n1110 WBT-AM\n\nDecember 13, 2005\n\nHello Reno!\n\nI am the young guy that inherited your desk at WBTV when you transfered to JP in April of 1972!\n\nYou, at that time, and then I shared the cubical with Vivian Harris. Yes, I am Dennis Phillips.\n\nI worked at BTV from April of '72 until September of '75. Maybe you recall the Kid's Show I created named Whistlestop? George Booker and Eddie Wade made the Whistlestop set that Rick Frye and I designed.\n\nNotable highlights of my years at WBTV are: I wrote and produced the Carowinds opening day show. I still have the script! I also wrote and produced the WBTV 25th Anniversary Show that may exist somewhere in their archives. It has probably long been transferred from 2-inch quad.\n\nFor the finale of that show, Dave Clanton laid on the hood of my '74 Hornet Sportabout as Jim Patterson drove it up the winding road at the old Spencer Mountain transmitter site. Clanton was rolling 16mm on the Arri . In the background was an audio montage of past news and programs. We then closed the program with Jim standing in the transmitter building looking out at the distant (and small) Charlotte skyline reading the final monologue and using the then current slogan \"Part of your Life!\"\n\nOther things stand out, like helping Russ Ford on the air at WBT Radio News cover the Eastern Airline Crash in September 1974. I also used to often sit in with Jim Patterson from 5AM to 6AM when he did that hour on WBT. I helped with the remote telecast when President Gerald Ford visited Freedom Park and gave a speech in 1975 where the first shots of the American Revolution were fired. There were also countless hours of the Boys Town Auction.\n\nI know that you have purged from your mind one of the funniest bits ever done on any local television show. You and Vivian Harris (I think—maybe it was Fuzzy Prevatte) appeared as \"guests\" on the Morning Scene and Jim Patterson interviewed you. You were dressed in a bowling jacket and wore sunglasses and the gag was that you and your \"wife\" were a team trying to set a Guinness record by going coast to coast on roller skates while yo-yoing. She was dressed as a bimbo and was chewing a mouthful of bubble gum! Jim Patterson played the bit with all seriousness while all of us off camera were laughing hysterically.\n\nIn 1975 the handwriting was on the wall that the glory days of local TV production were coming to an end, due to cable TV, satellite and home video systems. I left the Whistlestop show to Jim Strader and moved to Orlando, Florida. Today, my wife and I own a costume business, Allied Costumes. (http://www.alliedcostumes.com) I am a college professor in the theater department at a local University and I still find time to do a bit of radio.\n\nThank you for the memories! ...All were from the best days of my life!\n\nIf you would like some photos and information from my collection, I will be happy to add to your collection.\n\n—Dennis Phillips\n\nOrlando, Florida\n\nFull disclosure: The bit on the Morning Show was on an April Fool's day. Jeanette Garner (who worked in the program department) and your editor appeared as \"Buster & Yolanda,\" an itinerant husband and wife act. Buster was a yo-yo artist; Yolanda a tap dancer. Their simultaneous performance was a flurry of dazzling and daring dexterity, a veritable blizzard of terpsichorean and yoyo-ean excitement. They/we were yo-tapping our way across America, with the ultimate goal of being booked on the Ed Sullivan Show. Perfectly costumed, of course, Yolanda had on something shiny, short and tight-fitting, tap shoes a-clacking. I was outfitted not unlike a conga drummer in the Xavier Cugat orchestra, wearing black tuxedo pants, an outlandish puffy-sleeved shirt and a colorful cummerbund, all topped off with a fake mustache and a cheesy-looking hairpiece I had borrowed from a toupee salesman. We leapt into a frenzy of yo'ing and tapping, all the while being interviewed by the hosts, Dick Taylor and Jim Patterson. Somewhere in the performance/interview they happened to mention that Ed Sullivan had gone off the air several months before. It was in all the papers, they said. We were deflated. In fact, our crests were fallen. What'll we do now? Were our yo-dancing careers over? The hosts were suitably sympathetic and did their best to comfort us.\n\nAlthough the bit concluded with a full screen card that said \"April Fool!\", some elderly viewer immediately called in, so distraught over our predicament that she offered to let us come live with her. I'm sure that producer Michael Nabicht, a mischievous co-conspirator in all this nonsense, encouraged us to do just that.\n\nDecember 6, 2005\n\nI just wanted to say how much I am enjoying your website. WBT has such a rich well- documented broadcast history. I thought I had seen it all until I saw your website!\n\nI worked at WBT from 1985-1990 part-time first on the overnight oldies show \"After Hours,\" then when Larry King came in I did weekends and vacation fill. It was one of the high points of my career. On Sunday nights WBT did a program called \"The Sunday Show\" which featured the music of the '40's and '50's of course I played \"Heartaches\" with a sense of pride and awe as I repeated the famous story behind the music.\n\nGathering up my courage one day I asked Jim Patterson if he would be a guest on the show. To my surprise he not only consented but he was obviously pleased that I had invited him. He did the first two hours together from 10 till midnight (the show ran until 1am) despite the fact Jim had to do the morning show on WBTV the next morning. We had a great time, I let Jim play anything he wanted and we talked and the stories came. I only wish I had recorded it because it was not long after this that he passed away. I was on the air the day Jim died in that accident. The sadness throughout the entire building was like nothing I had ever experienced. Everyone loved him.\n\nI played a small part at WBT. Some of the talented professionals I worked with include James K. Flynn, Don Russell, H.A. Thompson, Henry Boggan, Dave Bishop (PD), Mike Collins, Bill Jennings, Tony Renaud, and Bob Simpson. In engineering there was Sam Robertson, Karen?, Bob White, Bob Denny was Chief Engineer.\n\nAlso there was Rockin' Ray, David Appleford, Andy Bickel (PD), Lee Melvin and Scott White (in news), Kate McKinna (in programming) and engineer Bill Booth in the list of really great people I worked with.\n\nThat's just a few of the very talented people on the staff. I came to Charlotte in 1981 to work at WSOC-AM and was there till 1985 doing afternoons and music director duties. Comparing the two stations I would have to say the radio and TV staffs at WBT/WBTV were closer and worked together more than the staffs at WSOC.\n\nWell, enough rambling! It was a happy experience to say the least. Thanks for a really fine website.\n\n— Mike Miranda (aka Mike Sheridan)\n\nNovember 05, 2004\n\nI just wanted to let you know what a fantastic web site you've created! I'm working with Jerry King in a job search campaign, and he mentioned the site to me when I saw him yesterday. I've spent the past couple of hours looking at it, reminiscing about some of the people, and sharing the memory of that special \"spirit\" you refer to that used to exist at WBT and WBTV, and that I remember so well from my brief years there.\n\nYou may or may not remember me, but you probably remember my Dad - Clif Livingston. I'm his oldest son, Tom, and I also worked at WBTV from July of 1969 to May of 1972 as a projectionist intern during my summers and holidays while I was a college student at UNC-Chapel Hill. That was not only a fun job to have for a college student, but it set the standard for the kind of working atmosphere that I would love to find again somewhere, although that's probably a futile hope. The people who worked there at that time, yourself included, were some of the most professional people I've ever encountered, and their enthusiasm for creating the best programs and advertisements/commercials they could create was contagious, and that professionalism has continued to inspire me in every job I've had since then. It was just great to have been able to share that experience with the people I worked with, and that was probably the only job I've ever had where I actually looked forward to going to work every day, primarily because of the people I had the pleasure of working with and the exciting \"cutting edge\" atmosphere that existed in those days. I remember that I had so much fun working there that I used to volunteer to work other people's shifts in addition to my own - letting them keep the money!\n\nJerry and I get together about once a week to review my progress with interviews, etc., but we always spend some of our time asking each other if we remember this or that person, and comparing our memories of what we experienced at Jefferson-Pilot. Jerry's done a better job of keeping in touch with people than I have, but I'm surprised at how many fond memories I still have of the people I knew over the years, not only from my own time there, but also from my Dad's 33 year career at WBTV (1950 to 1983). Your web site has reminded me of other people whose names I had forgotten over the years, and I've added the site to my \"favorites\" so I can revisit it periodically as you update it and add to it in the coming months and years.\n\nThanks for giving us \"alumni\" of the station such a terrific gift commemorating that special bond that we once had and can still have through our shared memories and stories of that time. You've probably done more good than you realize in contributing something positive to the lives of the people who will visit your web site. I hope everything's going well for you and your family these days.\n\n—Tom Livingston"
