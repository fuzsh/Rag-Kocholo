        "text": "FROM THE NACW OFFICE UPDATED 4/28/03\n\nRE: please scroll down the page to view past updates to this column.\n\nHello all ...I know...I know...it's been a month since I've updated this coulmn. In my defense NACW has been hopping and there's lots of good stuff going on.\n\nAs most of you who follow NACW know, your North American Heavyweight Champion is a disagreeable fellow called \"THE PROFILE\" RICK STONE who is managed by a gentleman, and I use that term very loosely, by the name of PERRY JAMES.\n\nThese two have taken the wrestling world by storm, defeating and injuring The Barbarian and others too numerous to mention. I caught up with Stone and James at The Hilton in Charlotte last week and here is the results of the interview that followed.\n\nBEN T: Thank you both for taking the time to speak with me here today.\n\nP. JAMES: It's about time you goofs got around to interviewing YOUR North American Heavyweight Champion and myself...I guess it was inevitable that you finally show a little class.\n\nBEN T: You are certainly never at a loss for words.\n\nR. STONE: When you're the man, you SHOULD have a lot to say. And I know for a fact that NACW fans have been begging for an opportunity to soak up some class from my Illustrious manager and myself...you know, they don't call him THE ILLUSTRIOUS Perry James for nothing..moron\n\nBEN T: Be that as it may, let's start with the matter of one DANNY DOLLAR.\n\nP. JAMES: Please don't make me sick this early in the interview!\n\nBEN T: Dollar has had some real wars against you Rick. How do you feel about him?\n\nR. STONE: Perry just answered your question...Danny Dollar makes me sick. Dollar is so jealous of my superior ability and my superior looks that he's afraid to even come to the same arena as me.\n\nP. JAMES: That's right Rick... Dollar talks a big game and claims to be the # 1 contender for the North American Heavyweight Championship but I've got news for him... He's low man on the totem pole and right there next to him is BONEHEAD BAGWELL and TRICKY RICKY MORTON.\n\nBEN T: The men you have just mentioned are top competitors who care about the fans and follow the rules...they are role models for our children.\n\nR. STONE: I follow my own rules! Dollar is an idiot. He thinks he can win my title by making the fans cheer for him...HA! what a maroon....\n\nP. JAMES: Yeah WHAT A MAROON!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nBEN T: What about Buff Bagwell and Ricky Morton?<\n\nR. STONE: What about them? Buff Bagwell is a puffed up bag of wind and Morton is an over the hill has been. I've spanked both of them...heck Perry could take those two losers by himself.\n\nBEN T: You're saying Perry James could defeat Buff and Ricky?\n\nP JAMES: Just look at us.... Look at the way we inspire people...Notice the way the women flock around us...If Rick Stone ran for govoner of North Carolina, I can guarantee he would be elected in a landslide!\n\nBEN T: Rick, people have compared you to Jack Brisco and also men like Ox Baker and Bulldog Brower...They say you have the technical ability of Brisco and the savagery of Baker and Brower...\n\nP. JAMES: Let me stop you right there...The truth of the matter is they are comparing Brisco and the others to Stone not the other way around!\n\nBEN T. Why have you not wrestled for a world title yet?\n\nP. JAMES: He will and soon! I was recently in New York looking at Brock Lesnar and Triple H. I'm not impressed! neither man could last 10 minutes in the ring with a champion of the calibre of \"THE PROFILE\" RICK STONE.\n\nBEN T: Tell me Rick...would you wrestle Chris Steele and or Scott Powers if the money was right?\n\nR. STONE: I'm not sure ..we're such good friends ...it wouldn't feel right..\n\nBEN T: Come on Rick answer the question..the fans want to know.\n\nP. JAMES: DON'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION RICK...this weasel is trying to cause trouble between me an Big Tony..he's trying to trick you into something.\n\nBEN T: Calm down Perry..I withdraw the question\n\nP. JAMES: Throckmorton, you watch your mouth or you'll wind up in deep deep trouble!,br>\n\nBEN T: What are Rick Stone's hobbies?\n\nR. STONE: Beating up people!\n\nBEN T: I'm talking past times Rick...\n\nP. JAMES: SO are we...Rick loves breaking bones and busting people up...especially people like Danny Dollar, Buff Bagwell, and Ricky Morton. HAHAHAHA\n\nBEN T: Rick, you're a brash, some would say arrogant man, who rubs many people the WRONG way. How do you feel about that?\n\nR. STONE: First, I don't feel I'm brash or arrogant..Perry and myself are both rather modest..Secoundly, there is not a man alive capable of teaching me a lesson. I'm rougher, tougher, meaner, and might i say, better looking than any other professional wrestler in the world today.\n\nBEN T: Last question...Do you consider yourself a supersta of the sport?\n\nP JAMES: Of course he does you moron and so does anybody else with half a brain ...Let's go Rick..Brooke and Jennifer are waiting....\n\nWell, as you can all see, The Profile Rick Stone and The Illustrious Perry James are two men who are very confident in their abilities and not shy about saying so. One thing's for sure, at the time of this interview, Stone and James control The North American Heavyweight Championship but the question is....FOR HOW LONG?\n\nSee you at the matches\n\nBen Throckmorton\n\nNACW, Inc.\n\nWell, it's Thursday morning 3/13/03 ..Our Shallotte event is only 2 days away and there is a bunch of interesting things going on here in North American Championship Wrestling. It will be very interesting to see how things develop in Shallotte Saturday night and how this particular event will shape NACW's Spring and Summer 2003\n\nAs most of you probably already know, Rick Stone's heart punch was officially ruled illegal Saturday, March 1st just before Stone's match with Danny Dollar in Shelby, NC. This, however, did not stop Stone from administering the heart punch to Dollar and it's a testament to this young man's strength, conditioning and courage that he will appear in Shallotte Saturday night and with Stone and James in the same building with Dollar...who knows how tempers are going to flare and what confrontations may take place.\n\nCommissioner Buddy Diamond has promised an official announcement in Shallotte Saturday night concerning the NACW TV Championship. It is rumored that the belt will be taken from Stone and put up for grabs in a tournament to be held this summer. Stone and James' reaction to this announcement, if the rumor is true, will set off fireworks for sure.\n\nThe Lost Souls will also be in Shallotte Saturday night and they have vowed to ELIMINATE another tag team from NACW competition. Who do they mean? A likely answer would be Bubba and T-Roy, The Jones Brothers, who the Lost Souls will face Saturday night but you never know what these two are thinking and that could spell trouble for any tag team in NACW and you can bet that all teams are going to keep a watchful eye on the pair from the pits Saturday night.\n\nAnd speaking of watchful eyes, our best wishes for a speedy recovery go out to The Black Angel after he was injured March 1st in Shelby at the hands of The Lost Souls. I spoke with Black Angel briefly yesterday and he assured me that he will return to NACW on April 5th in Shallotte and that he has demanded a return match against the Souls in Morganton, NC on April 19th. This could be a little aggressive on the part of The Black Angel as his eyes were severely burned when The Lost Souls threw some sort of thick red fluid into Angel's face in Shelby. Only time will tell if Black Angel can make a comeback here in NACW. I know for sure that his heart is in it and if and when he does return, I have to believe The Lost Souls will be headed for parts unknown. Tommy Gunn has re-affirmed Angels comments and has vowed retribution on The Lost Souls any time, any place. Tommy is slated to battle Stone Saturday night for The North American Heavyweight title and should he be victorious, it will be interesting to see just how that victory effects his dedication to The Black Angel and tag team competition.\n\nThe feature bout Saturday night will see Buff Bagwell and Ricky Morton defend their newly won North American Tag Team Championships against the former title holders Main Attraction and their manager Big Tony Cicero\n\nBuff and Ricky defeated The Main Attraction in Shelby on March 1st only to have Main Attraction pearl harbor them and Rick Stone delivered the heart punch to both men. Adding insult to injury, Main Attraction and Cicero made off with the tag team belts and have not returned them to their rightful owners. Speaking with Morton and Bagwell, it is not hard to detect the disdain they hold for Cicero and the Main Attraction\n\nThe fued between these two teams is a powder keg waiting to explode and Saturday night in Shallotte, NACW is going to light the fuse.\n\nStay tuned fans for some of the most exciting and competitive professional wrestling action in many, many years right here in North American Championship Wrestling..we are coming to your town soon!\n\nIf you are interested in bringing exciting North American Championship Wrestling to your area as a benefit, fund raiser, or to your town's event, fair, or festival, email me, Ben Throckmorton at info@NACW.net or write to us at:\n\nNACW PO Box 606 Supply, NC 28462\n\nor call\n\n1(888)546-5375,br>\n\nSee you all at ringside\n\nBen Throckmorton\n\nNorth American Championship Wrestling\n\nFROM THE NACW OFFICE UPDATED 2/26/03\n\nRE: please scroll down the page to view past updates to this column.\n\nWell with March 1st and The event in Shelby quickly approaching, I thought I would take a moment a reflect on one of the most controversial issues in North American Championship Wrestling...SHOULD THE HEART PUNCH BE BANNED?\n\n\"The Profile\" Rick Stone has a weapon that a referee can do little about. It is not a concealed weapon that he pulls from his trunks when the moment is ripe. Nor is it something he grabs at ringside, such as a chair, with which to nail his opponent. The weapon I speak of is Rick Stone's fist and it has proved to be a devasting tool of destruction.\n\nThis \"weapon's\" utilization inside North American Championship Wrestling arenas around the territory and the devasting effects it's had on Stone's opponents has caused the board of directors of NACW to seriously consider banning this manuver in future NACW competition.\n\nThis weapon, of course, is the HEARTPUNCH...a blow that has caused many worries for NACW's executive staff, to say nothing of NACW Legal, who are very concerned about the eventualities of death in the ring and subsequent lawsuits.\n\nDanny Dollar, who has witnessed and experienced the devasting effects of this blow, will face Stone and his manager Perry James in Shelby Saturday night for The North American Heavyweight Championship and he believes that a manuever like this has NO PLACE in professional sport. \"It should be banned. The heart punch is too dangerous. I've seen many wrestlers including The Barbarian carried out on stretchers after being hit by Stone's heart punch. NACW should ban this manuever before someone gets KILLED!\"\n\nThe letters, by wrestlers and fans alike, keep piling up on the desks of NACW officials and also those in the North and South Carolina Athletic Commissions. They want immediate action taken to end the use of the heartpunch. The NACW commission is meeting this week and we could have a decision before Saturday night when Stone is scheduled to defend his North American Heavyweight Title against Danny Dollar.\n\nThe self proclaimed \"Illustrious\" Perry James who is the manager of Rick Stone had these comments: \"The NACW Board of Directors nor The State Athletic Commissions would dare ban Stone's punch..it's perfectly legal and if whiners like Dollar, Buff Bagwell, and Ricky Morton are not in the condition to compete with my North American Heavyweight Champion, then they shouldn't be in the ring because wrestling is a dangerous sport and only the strong survive.\"\n\nThe dilemma presented to the board of directors and the commissions is that if the heart punch is a life endangering manuver, exactly how much more dangerous it is it than say...a backbreaker, or a piledriver, or the list goes on and on? Is it fair to single out one hold and let the others go unquestioned? To ferret out all the holds which could potentially under certain circumstances cause death or serious injury would be a monumental undertaking which would undoubtedly take months. Evidently, having said that, The NACW board has taken all this under consideration and could be ready to render it's decision as early as this Saturday night(3/1) in Shelby, N.C..\n\n\"The Profile\" Rick Stone who used the heartpunch to severely injure The Barbarian and win the North American Heavyweight Championship in January will have to find another manuver should the board rule against him. Only time will tell! In the meantime, in spite of all the uproar and uncertainty surrounding Stone's heartpunch, there remains an apparent lack of interest on the part of Stone and James. Whether Perry James is responsible for keeping the punch alive and well or simply the negligence of the board of directors, the fact remains that for the time being, there is a very dangerous and potentially lethal weapon on the loose in North American Championship Wrestling.\n\nGo to the opening page of NACW.net and cast your vote...SHOULD THE HEART PUNCH BE BANNED?\n\nCURRENT TV LISTINGS\n\nNACW, Inc.'s partnership with WHKY TV 14 in Hickory, NC continues to grow and thrive as we head into 2003.

Most of that controversary centers on \"The Profile\" Rick Stone, his manager \"The Illustrious\" Perry James and The North American Tag Team Champions, Main Attraction and their mentor ..Big Tony Cicero.\n\nStone's heart punch has devastated many opponents the last several weeks including Danny Dollar, and The Barbarian. Stone has also sent non-wrestlers to the emergency room including Referee Darrell Morris and also Commissioner Buddy Diamond. The Board of Directors of NACW have taken it under advisement whether or not to ban the heartpunch in North American Championship Wrestling and their decision is expected in the next few weeks.\n\nCicero and The Main Attraction have been at the center of controversy since SUMMER SHOWDOWN in July, 2002 when Main Attraction betrayed The Holy Alliance of Reverend Slim & The Black Angel and joined forces with Big Tony Cicero. The latest of these controversaries involve the newly formed team of Buff \"The Stuff\" Bagwell and NWA legend Ricky Morton. Morton and Bagwell defeated The Main Attraction in Newland, NC on January 11th only to have the decision reversed when Main Attraction was declared the winner by disqualification. The rematch has been signed and will take place in Shelby, NC at THE CITY PARK RECREATION CENTER on Saturday night, March 1st at 8:00pm. A special twist has been added to that match and that is if Buff and Ricky defeat The Main Attraction, they get 5 minutes with Cicero and Perry James in a tag match.\n\nI talked with Tony Cicero via telephone yesterday and here's some of what he had to say:\n\n\"Well, Well, Well....Bagwell and Morton are crying on everybody's shoulder...what a laugh. Sure, I know Buffy and Ricky Morton...one is a reject from some now defunct weight lifting organization, and Morton belongs in a retirement home with all the other old people.\"\n\n\"What the two of them know about professional wrestling you could put in the eye of a needle and still have room for the thread!\"\n\n\"Let me get completely serious for a moment....First of all Bagwell and Morton are LIARS. They never beat Main Attraction..look at the tape...Big, fat Bubba Jones runs in and interferes in the match when CLEARLY Main Attraction was on the verge of victory. He hit Scott Powers with a chair and you Throckmorton, like the cheat you are, try to run to ringside and count three before referee Morris could make the proper call....I think you should be fined and suspended for your actions in additon to suspending Bubba Jones for interfering in our match and I'm going to make sure it happens if we have to BEAT the suspensions out of Commissioner Buddy Diamond\"\n\n\"All the fans should know that before I accept the contract to manage any team, I check them out thoroughly because there is one factor that you cannot build in a man, and that factor is heart. He may possess all the physical factors to become champion but if he doesn't have the heart to fight, he will not succeed!\"\n\n\"Main Attraction have the heart and have defeated the best and will continue to defend these North American Tag Team titles against all comers.\"\n\n\"You see, Bagwell and Morton are crying because they are jealous of myself and Main Attraction.....They are jealous of our abilities, our titles, and our looks. They are in a line of challengers as long as your arm...Well let me tell you this, they don't pick CHAMPIONS...they pick CHALLENGERS. Champions are Champions because they are the best and have beaten the best.\" \"By all rights, NACW brass should have told Morton and Bagwell to go out and earn a reputation but NO...they give them NOT one, but two title matches and offer them a stipulation where they get to wrestle myself and my brilliant brother in law, Perry James...Well Bagwell and Morton, after Main Attraction has demolished you in Shelby and shown all the ignourant fans and the NACW brass just who the real champions are... I think Perry and myself will finish you both once and for all!\" \"HAHHAHAHHHAHAH\" \"Yes, That's what we'll do! Now stop bothering me...my time is very valuable.\"\n\nFans, Cicero was obviously upset during this conversation and I had to take the liberty of editing out the obscenities he used during the conversation. Like them or hate them though, one thing I can say is when these two teams clash in Shelby on March 1st, it should be a match for the ages and you, the fan, will be the winner. Bagwell and Morton want Main Attraction and they have a score to settle with Cicero and James. Cicero says it will be \"NO CONTEST.\" These four men represent two of the top tag teams in professional wrestling and you can look forward to action and excitement.\n\nCome out and see North American Championship Wrestling. featuring the VERY BEST in Professional Wrestling.\n\nTil next time...See you at ringside,\n\nBen Throckmorton NACW, Inc.\n\nCurrent NACW Champions\n\nNACW Heavyweight Champ-Rick Stone\n\nNACW TV Champ-Rick Stone\n\nNACW Tag Team Champs-Ricky Morton & Buff Bagwell\n\nWhile you're here check out:"
