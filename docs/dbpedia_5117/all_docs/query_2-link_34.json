        "text": "The TMU women's hockey team secured another commitment on their blueline, signing defender Nahvin Bal from Surrey, B.C. Bal graduated from Lord Tweedsmuir Secondary, playing junior hockey for the Fraser Valley Rush.\n\nDuring her career in interior B.C., Bal was an assistant captain with her club team, leading Fraser Valley to three provincial gold medals, two provincial silver medals, and two Pacific region championships. Bal was also an honour roll student throughout her entire time at Lord Tweedsmuir.\n\n\"Nahvin brings a dynamic offensive upside to our blueline,\" head coach, Lisa Haley, told the Bold. \"We think her playmaking skills, combined with her skating abilities, will translate very well to the OUA level.\"\n\nA self-described \"team-first player\", Bal will join the Biology program when she arrives on campus in the fall. She cites the educational opportunities, as well as the chance to live in the big city as reasons for choosing TMU.\n\n\"I wanted to experience playing hockey, going to school and living outside of my home province,\" said Bal. \"I also know that TMU is a great school, and has a great coaching staff, which will help me achieve my goals both in school and on the ice.\"\n\nThe Bold begin their regular season October 9th, with a home matchup against York.\n\nTMU Women's Hockey Recruiting Class 2024-25\n\nDayle Chinnick\n\nNahvin Bal"
