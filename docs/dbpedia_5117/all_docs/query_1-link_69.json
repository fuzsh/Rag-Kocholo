        "text": "My name is Noah Shoun. I am a graduate from Western Carolina University with a Bachelor’s of Science in Communication degree in Communication, concentrating in broadcasting, and a minor in computer information systems . My passion for broadcasting comes from wanting to deliver concise information to the public.\n\nI job shadowed at WHKY-TV, local broadcast station in my hometown. WHKY gave me the opportunity to shoot a news segment, record the weather forecast, be a part of WHKY radio talk show, and record a radio commercial. Any form of broadcasting gives me a way to connect with others and be able to give them the information they deserve. My other work i did for Blueridge Healthcare as an intern to help create videos for their patients and community.\n\nMy family and friends always talk about how I have a big heart and when I have my mind set on doing something I do it, giving nothing less than 100 percent. Since my early years of high school, I have been hard at work familiarizing myself with Adobe Audition, After Effects, Photoshop, and Premiere to be able to qualify for my dream career. I am still not done learning at WCU, but I am ready to take those skills and apply them to shape my future."
