        "text": "Coming soon! We sat down with Paul Sarker, Entertainment Attorney at Greenberg Traurig, for a deep dive into the world of collegiate athletics and the game-changing NIL deals. Stay tuned for a great discussion on how athletes can navigate their newfound wealth wisely. Don't miss out! #NIL #AthleteWealth #PodcastEpisode\"\n\nIn the fifth article of the series I have written for LawInSport summarising the legal issues discussed at their Global Summit 2023, I provide my key takeaways from the Commercial Developments panel. A variety of perspectives were provided by Jeffrey Gewirtz, Xavier Cuch Grases, Arthur McAfee, III, Christopher R. Chase, Steve Bainbridge and Jamie Andrew. There is notably unrelenting growth in the commercialisation of sport and I outline the discussions that took place in this panel on topics including American Football, diversity, media rights and eSports. Please do have a read if interested! #sportslaw #footballlaw #sportsbusiness #sport #athletes #sportlaw #law #lawinsport #americanfootball #nfl #mediarights #esports\n\nIt’s truly the game-changer in modern collegiate sports as some student athletes are getting paid for their names through Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) deals. The NCAA, however, does have special rules and limits on these kind of deals, so it’s important that athletes and their parents or guardians are well informed before signing any such deal. In this recent segment for AZ Family, attorney David A. McCarville provides legal commentary on NILs, and what you should know. To view this informative segment, please visit: https://ow.ly/3Aje50Q9ZYN #NameImageLikeness #NIL #NCAARules #BusinessFinance #Fennemore #Phoenix\n\nLove this initiative, #NFLPA. Mental Health Champions, let's join Hall of Famer Walter Jones and the National Football League Player's Association to check in with each other today. Make a call to a colleague. Lift them up. Let's keep the play moving across the field. #privatepracticesuccess #PsychFusion #LPC #LPCC #LCSW #Psychologist #burnoutprevention #burnoutrecovery\n\nAnnouncing a football shirt sponsorship deal is…a big deal. When you’re one of the worlds biggest companies….which to be honest….the majority have never heard of…it’s an even bigger challenge. Like any new brand announcing itself onto a world stage, you need to know who your audience is. You need to understand their passions. What they engage with. What makes them stop, sit up and take notice. That comes down to emotions. Emotional intelligence. Emotional engagement. Emotional triggers. And above all…it’s how you get your messages down in authentically, organically. So well done Snapdragon today. An icon. Iconic moments. Reinforcing the tribal mentality with numbers. And some humour. #brands #football #sponsorship #bizsport #marcomms #snapdragon #manutd https://lnkd.in/eMzDPwfP\n\nDisability+Business=Innovation #NDEAM is more than promoting disability one month out of the year. It is a long-term commitment. It is empowering inclusion by utilizing the benefits of 5G and new and emerging technology. It is connecting deaf and disabled communities, inside and outside companies, with those who understand the possibilities that tech can provide. #ConnectingChangesEverything #Deaf #AbilityAtATT @ATT"
