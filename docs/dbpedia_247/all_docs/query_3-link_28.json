        "text": "July 17, 2023\n\nThis is the sixth of a series for the City Six athletic programs where we look back at the bright, shining stars from the athletic season.\n\nWe will name the Team of the year and Student Athlete of the year for each school. In addition we will list an honor roll for teams and student athletes. A team recognition will be noted by a championship, post season advancement, and / or a significant achievement. To be named as a player one should have a national award or honor, a league accolade, significant achievement, or team record.\n\nLet’s take a look back at this past season on the at Franklin Field, The Palestra, Penn Park, Rhodes Fields, Tommy Lasorda Field at Meiklejohn Stadium, and the rivers, here and abroad, and the links for The University of Pennsylvania.\n\nCo-Teams of the Year\n\nWomen’s Lacrosse\n\nIn the previous season the team had a sub-.500 record and did not qualify for the Ivy League Tournament for the first time. The team had a good, young core group. Coach Karin Corbett gathered her senior leaders and alumni to remind the players of what it takes to be a Penn Women’s Lacrosse player. And that message got through to the delight of the coach. This Penn team won the Ivy League going undefeated in the Ancient Eight, then swept both games in the Ivy Tournament to land an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. Penn defeated Connecticut in the first game before losing to eventual NCAA finalist Boston College 9 – 7 to end the season. The tournament championship is the 4th in program history. The team posted a 14 – 5 overall record, 7 – 0 in the Ivy League. The Quakers won 9-striaght before losing to BC. Along the way the Red and Blue played seven ranked teams in the regular season, winning three, in gaining a #14 ranking. Penn won the title with a thrilling 15 – 14 overtime win against Yale at Penn Park on a goal by Anna Brandt. Maria Themelis was named the Most Outstanding Player. In the league awards Niki Miles received the Attacker of the Year honor, Brandt being the Midfielder of the Year, and Izzy Rohr named as the Defensive Player of the Year. She had 35 Caused Turnovers. More details for those student athletes will follow. The Coach of the Year Award went to Corbett. Ten players were selected to All-Ivy teams. Nearly everyone returns for next season along with notable newcomers. Bright days lie ahead for Penn. With Coach giving them the reminder about what it will take.\n\nBaseball\n\nThe talk of the late spring college season revolved around the University of Pennsylvania baseball team who were poised to make a Super Regional, the first time for the program and the Ivy League. But the Quakers fell short losing twice to Southern Mississippi in the Auburn Regional. But the Red and Blue served notice that they were playing to win. They won their first two games starting with a 6 – 3, 11-inning win over host Auburn, their first regional victory since 1990. Penn beat Samford 5 – 4 to have an opportunity to advance. But just getting to the Regional called on the resolve of this team. They qualified for the Ivy Tournament, then got the number one seed and home field advantage by beating Columbia three times at the end of the season. Penn beat Columbia one more time, Harvard, and Princeton 16 – 3 to get the title and a trip to the NCAA Championship. Jarrett Pokrovsky was named the Most Outstanding Player. At the conclusion of the regular season the Red and Blue saw five players get named to the All-Ivy first team; Ryan Dromboski, who is the Pitcher of the Year, Cole Zaffiro (Pitcher), Jackson Appel (Catcher), Cole Palis (2B), and Wyatt Henseler (3B).
