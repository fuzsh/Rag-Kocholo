        "text": "Nitrogen cycle pathways\n\nWe identified significant differences in functional gene abundance as a result of tree species within the nitrification, denitrification, DNRA, and ANRA pathways (Fig. 2). Overall, gene abundance exhibited the greatest differences between soils beneath chestnut and cherry, while the gene abundance in soils beneath oak was generally intermediate between cherry and chestnut. This is supported by the significantly lower gene abundance values of amoA, narJ, nirK, norB, nosZ, narJ, napA, nirB, nrfA, nrfH, and nasA beneath chestnut relative to cherry. This data supports the stated hypothesis that abundance of functional genes related to nitrification and denitrification, in particular, would be elevated in soil beneath cherry. The soils beneath cherry exhibited the greatest N mineralization rates and NO3- in leachate, indicating a rapid N cycle and high inorganic N availability (49). As other studies support, we relate the high inorganic N availability in cherry soil to its AM fungal association and relatively low C:N litter, as well as low NAG enzyme activity, indicating that N is not limiting microbial processes in soils beneath cherry.\n\nAbundances of all genes within the nitrification pathway (amoABC, hao) were low, regardless of tree species, and amoA was not detected in either chestnut or cherry soils (Fig. 2). This is contrary to our hypothesis that cherry soil would have greater abundance of functional genes related to nitrification, relative to chestnut or cherry, which are both ECM-associated tree species. That no amoA was detected is surprising, as others have shown high numbers of gene copies from forest soils (up to 1.2 x 109 copies per g dry soil of AOA amoA) (50) and others have shown a strong relationship between NO3- production and amoA gene abundance (38). NO3- production was indeed detected in our prior incubation study for soil and litter from each tree species. However, low amoA gene abundance from grassland soil has also been reported (28), with a much greater abundance of nxrA and nxrB gene copies within the nitrification pathway. Our analysis did not include nxr genes, as it was not recognized in the IMG/M gene or function processing, but considering other nitrite oxidoreductase genes (narGH genes shown in the denitrification pathway here) suggest no difference in nitrite oxidoreductase gene abundance as a function of tree species.\n\nWithin the denitrification pathway, chestnut soils had the lowest gene abundance for narJ, nirK, norB, and nosZ relative to cherry or oak. Low denitrification-related gene numbers in chestnut soil was expected and aligns with the low inorganic N availability in chestnut soils, as denitrification rates are low in N-limited soil (51). N limitation in chestnut soil is likely a function of the high C:N ratio of the leaf litter and evidenced by the higher NAG enzyme activity. nirK and norB gene abundance was greatest in cherry soil, while narJ and nosZ were similar in soils beneath cherry and oak. High nirK and norB in cherry soil, which encode for the reduction of nitrite and nitric oxide, respectively, supports our hypothesis that cherry, with relatively high inorganic N availability, would stimulate denitrification capacity. Additionally, an analysis of the nirK:nosZ ratio, which has been used to estimate endpoint N2O production from soil (N2O:N2 ratio) (33, 40), suggests similar ratios across tree species and no difference in the capacity of these particular tree species to influence N2O emission relative to N2 gas through denitrification processes. Abundance of nirK was also much higher (10-fold or more) than nirS in all soils. nirS:nirK ratio may be related to the N2O sink capacity of soil, with a higher N2O consumption with increasing nirS:nirK ratio, related to the observation that nosZ occurs less frequently in genomes of strains with nirK relative to those with nirS (52).\n\nWithin the DNRA pathway, chestnut soil again exhibited the lowest abundance of several functional genes, including narJ, napA, nirB, nrfA, and nrfH relative to cherry or oak. The DNRA process is thought to play a role in N retention in forest soils by reducing NO3- to NH4+ (53). The amount of inorganic N was consistently low in soil leachate from our incubation study from chestnut soil (49) and the relatively low abundance of DNRA-related genes in chestnut soil suggests low initial inorganic N availability through low C:N litter inputs, rather than N retention through DNRA processes. Relative abundance of NRA genes (greatest abundance of nirB nitrite reductase in DNRA and nasA nitrate reductase in ANRA, regardless of tree species) aligns with those from a metagenomic assessment of a Minnesota, USA grassland soil (28), but do not reflect those from a GeoChip microarray assessment of a Tennessee, USA forest soil (54), which exhibited greatest relative abundance of narG nitrate reductase in the DNRA pathway. Differences in relative abundance of these genes by location may be a function of the two methodologies (metagenomic and microarray) (55).\n\nWithin ANRA, nasA was most abundant for all tree species, and was significantly more abundant in cherry relative to either chestnut or oak. High nasA abundance in soils beneath cherry may be related to greater amount of NO3- available to enter the process of assimilatory reduction to NH4+ for microbial biosynthesis (56) and ANRA is generally low when NH3 is present (57). Greater abundance of nasA beneath cherry shown here fits within the mycorrhizal framework of nutrient cycling as cherry, an AM fungal-associated species, should engender greater microbial assimilation of nutrients and microbial biomass relative to ECM-associated species (12, 23).\n\nAs expected for these soils influenced by forest tree species, genes related to organic N metabolism were abundant (up to 677 normalized gene copies for glnR), but surprisingly did not vary by tree species. We expected variation in gene abundance related organic N metabolism, particularly glnR, as glnR has been referred to as the central regulator of N metabolism and mediates the integration of C and N metabolism through uptake and utilization of non-phosphotransferase-system C compounds (58). There is evidence that glnR is inhibited in systems with N limitation (59) and is activated when N availability is high (60). However, others suggest that the rate-limiting step of organic matter decomposition is not the mineralization of amino acid to NH4+, but rather the previous step of depolymerization of proteins to oligopeptides (61â€“63). In the present soils, even given the relative differences in inorganic N availability, no difference in organic N metabolism gene abundance was detected and differences exhibited in N metabolism support that N metabolism is mediated by protein depolymerization."
