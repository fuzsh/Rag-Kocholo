It must be fought for, protected and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.” Ronald Reagan\n\nVoorhees Township is proud to honor those who fought for our freedom with the unveiling of the Veterans Wall of Honor. The ceremony will be held on Monday, Oct. 20 beginning at 6 p.m. with a program in the Macy’s Court on the lower level of the Voorhees Town Center. The Wall of Honor is located in Town Hall and will be unveiled immediately following the program.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWe are proud of the men and women who wore the uniform of the United States Military. It is fitting that these heroes be honored on a Veterans Wall because they stood on the “Wall of Freedom” to risk their lives for our great grandparents, grandparents, parents and generations to follow.\n\nThis year, 219 veterans will be honored on the wall. We expect the Wall of Honor to be a lasting tribute that will grow annually with the addition of other local heroes.\n\nBelow is a list of the first veterans being honored on the wall. Notable names include Harry E. Beach and George Frank Ziesch, both of whom were killed in action. Joseph Francis Toner is the brother of our former Municipal Clerk, Jeanette Schelberg, and is missing in action. The wall also includes former Voorhees Mayors Robert Pilkauskas and Raymond Potts. For over 50 years, our township physician has been Robert Binder, another honoree on the wall.\n\nWe are proud to honor the following heroes on the Voorhees Veterans Wall of Honor:\n\nHerman Robert Aducat, Leonard G.
