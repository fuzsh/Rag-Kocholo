        "text": "This is great news. How do we get more Female Athletic Directors? Let's celebrate all the ones who have made it. Give them a shout-out. Currently, only five out of the 65 athletic director positions are held by women. From Sandy Barbour in the Big Ten, to Jennifer Cohen in the Pac-12, to Heather Lyke and Carla Williams in the ACC, and Candice Storey Lee in the SEC, and Renee Baumgartner at Santa Clara. These exceptional women are, well, the exception. Working on the change - remind me of others..... Sandy Barbour, JenniferCohen, Heather Lyke, Carla Green Williams, Candice Storey Lee, Ed.D. #Womencoaching #sportknowledge #sportcoaching\n\nI really enjoyed writing this article about the Texas Christian University football team! The Big 12 conference is hosting its football media days ahead of another exciting season! Coach Sonny Dykes talked to the media about what he sees in this yearâ€™s team and what he has learned in his role as head coach for the last two seasons. To read my article, visit this link: https://lnkd.in/gDdSRU8Y\n\nThe Celtics are for sale. Time to break open the piggy bank and call your richest friends. Wyc Grousbeck, fresh off his 18th banner, is looking to cash out. But this isn't your average fire sale. Grousbeck's playing 4D chess with a two-stage deal that would make even the most seasoned M&A shark dizzy. Key stats for you number nerds: ðŸ’° Boston Celtics valued at $4.7B pre-championship ðŸ’¸ Current National Basketball Association (NBA) record: $4B for the Phoenix Suns ðŸ“ˆ The holy grail: $6.05B Washington Commanders sale Grousbeck's not just selling a team, he's selling a dynasty. It's like putting the Mona Lisa on eBay, but the Mona Lisa dunks. The kicker? He's staying on as governor until 2028. Talk about having your cake, eating it, and then selling the bakery. This isn't just a sale, it's a masterclass in exit strategy. Aspiring billionaires, take notes.\n\nWhat defines a great day out to you? The chance to be in a room with an actual (war) elephant? To get to meet the man who scored the first ever goal in Premier League history? To get lessons on how to persuade #stakeholders to do the right thing from people who have experienced difficult VIPs, adversarial courtrooms, war zones and hostage negotiations? Mastering the art of getting a fussy toddler to eat vegetables*? Well, AURA are collaborating with our Agency of the Year Kokoro Global to bring you all of this and more on 16th April at the Royal Armouries in Leeds. Tickets for Plug into Persuasion: Stakeholder Management are free to AURA members, who can now sign up at our website. Work clientside but still not an AURA member? You can try us for free using the link here: https://lnkd.in/e5vwTg6x *It may not be quite enough to get a fussy toddler to eat their vegetables but we promise what you'll learn could be a really good start.
