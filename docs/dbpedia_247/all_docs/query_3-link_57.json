        "text": "Welcome\n\nfrom Neal Litvack, President & CEO\n\n4,000-plus animals! That's the number of pets we saved in 2022 by relocating them to Massachusetts and placing them into loving homes. It was three years ago that we teamed up with the Northeast Animal Shelter (NEAS) to save thousands of pets by way of transport to New England—and today NEAS is officially part of our organization. Your enduring support of our mission makes this life-saving work possible and, as we mark the start of a new year, I'm more grateful to you than ever before.\n\nLearn More About NEAS\n\nIn addition to founding the Neurology Financial Assistance Fund, the couple generously support the âCatvocatesâ initiative, which helps the MSPCAâs adoption centers shelter and provide medical care to homeless cats before they too can be placed into loving homes.\n\nCristin and Mike have also extended their generosity to the Angell Animal Medical Center staff. As a 24/7 emergency and specialty hospital, Angell never closes, never goes on holiday. No matter the day, doctors and veterinary technicians are onsite tending to patients. Knowing they often work long hoursâand sometimes skip their own mealsâthe couple sponsored a food truck in 2022 that served countless grilled cheese sandwiches (among other goodies) to a very hungry staff. Needless to say that truck was extremely popular among the Angell team!\n\nCristin and Mikeâs generous support of the MSPCA-Angellâs mission means that many a pet lover need not worry about how they can afford care, and their kindness and concern for Angellâs hardworking staff is deeply appreciated by all.\n\nMedical equipment is prohibitively expensive, however, and the hospital owes its world-leading reputation to donors such as Amy Remondi, also an MSPCA-Angell Advisory Council member, whose five-figure donation in 2022 has ensured that Angell remains cutting edge nearly a quarter century into the new millennium. Amyâs relationship with Angell began when her now 11-year-old Cockapoo, Winter, was treated by Dr. Zach Crouse, who continues to monitor this much-loved pet. Amy has two other dogs, a one-and-a-half-year-old Daisy named Luna and Golden Retriever, Dashâwho was rescued from an abusive situation at 10 months old and has had two ACL-repair surgeries. Amy also has two horses.\n\nAmyâs daughter, Chloe, recently toured Angellâs all-new Critical Care Unit, which inspired Amy to support the hospital further. Indeed, Amyâs entire family is heavily involved in the grander mission to protect and advocate for animals, and we are grateful for her continued support of the MSPCA-Angell.\n\nJoeâs generosity has seen Angell through some of the most challenging times in the organizationâs history: from the pandemic and its aftermath, to crippling staffing shortages that too often result in long wait times and the frustrations that go along with these challenges. Joe has made waiting for care at Angell that much more comfortable for people and their pets, however, by enabling us to install dynamic, instructive flooring improvements in the Angell lobby.\n\nMoreover, countless pieces of critical diagnostic and treatment technology have been installed at Angell as a direct result of Joeâs giving. We are grateful for Joeâs supportâand his friendship.\n\nMartha, who owned and adored several cats during her lifetime, made a generous gift to the MSPCA-Cape Cod in Centerville. Moved by the mission to house, safeguard and adopt animals to pet lovers across Cape Cod, Martha ensured her legacy would live on through the hundreds of adoptions the MSPCA-Cape Cod facilitates every year. We are profoundly thankful for her generous support and proud of the trust she placed in our mission to protect animals on the Cape, and everywhere else."
