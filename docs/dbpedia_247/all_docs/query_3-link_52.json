        "text": "Contamination with positivity bias is a potential problem in virtually all areas of psychological assessment. To determine the impact of positivity bias, one common approach is to embed special indicators within one's assessment battery. Such tools range from social desirability scales to overconfidence measures to the so-called overclaiming technique. Despite the large literature on these different approaches and underlying theoretical notions, little is known about the overall nomological network-in particular, the degree to which these constructs overlap. To this end, a broad spectrum of positivity bias detection tools was administered in low-stakes settings ( N = 798) along with measures of the Big Five, grandiose narcissism, and cognitive ability. Exploratory factor analyses revealed six first-order and two second-order factors. Overclaiming was not loaded by any of the six first-order factors and overconfidence was not explained by either of the two second-order factors. All other measures were confounded with personality and/or cognitive ability. Based on our findings, overclaiming is the most distinct potential indicator of positivity bias and independent of known personality measures.\n\nThe overclaiming technique (OCT) is a novel way of measuring how socially desirable responding influences survey responses. It has the potential to enhance the cross-cultural comparability of survey data. It allows the identification of respondents' knowledge accuracy and exaggeration by comparing their assessments of familiarity with existing and nonexisting concepts in a particular field of knowledge. We aim to compare the response patterns of countries and world regions based on their OCT accuracy and exaggeration-index values and validate these OCT scores using external variables. We also introduce a general model for the categorization of respondents based on their OCT indices values. We use the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 data from 64 countries (N = 275,904). We found considerable differences in response patterns across world regions: high accuracy values in East Asia, low accuracy values in Southern and Central America, high exaggeration values in Southern Europe, and low exaggeration values in Western Europe. Furthermore, we show that familiarity with math concepts changes substantially after adjustment using the OCT. The correlation between unadjusted math familiarity and math test scores is weak and nonsignificant (.13) whereas after adjustment the correlation becomes strong and significant (.66). Concerning other indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), public expenditure in education, and Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), before adjustment the correlation is negative and even significant for CPI (–.11, –.22, and –.45) whereas after adjustment the correlation becomes, though nonsignificant, positive (.05, .19, and .07). We also discuss the OCT in the context of other methods indicative of culturally preferred scale usage.\n\nA variety of approaches have been presented for assessing desirable responding in self-report measures. Among them, the overclaiming technique asks respondents to rate their familiarity with a large set of real and nonexistent items (foils). The application of signal detection formulas to the endorsement rates of real items and foils yields indices of (a) knowledge accuracy and (b) knowledge bias. This overclaiming technique reflects both cognitive ability and personality. Here, we develop an alternative measurement model based on multidimensional item response theory (MIRT). We report three studies demonstrating this new model’s capacity to analyze overclaiming data. First, a simulation study illustrates that MIRT and signal detection theory yield comparable indices of accuracy and bias—although MIRT provides important additional information. Two empirical examples—one based on mathematical terms and one based on Chinese idioms—are then elaborated. Together, they demonstrate the utility of this new approach for group comparisons and item selection. The implications of this research are illustrated and discussed.\n\nStudent self-reports of knowledge are widely used by researchers and educators, though their accuracy has been questioned due to potential biases. The overclaiming technique (OCT), based on the familiarity ratings of existing (reals) and non-existing (foils) items, has been used to identify accuracy and exaggeration in respondents' self-reports. We developed an original English OCT measure specifically for students who learn English as a foreign language (EFL). Our sample consists of Czech lower secondary students (N = 1391). We show that students' foil claiming relates to their gender, EFL exposure at school, at home, in their free time, and through peers, but not to their school type. School type, however, is a relevant factor in the claiming of reals. Warning about foils relates to lower foil claiming. Further research could examine students' understanding of OCT items through cognitive interviews and extend the use of the OCT to other foreign languages.\n\nResearch on self-reported knowledge and overclaiming in children is sparse. With the current study, we aim to close this gap by developing an overclaiming questionnaire measuring self-reported knowledge and overclaiming that is tailored to children. Moreover, we examine the nomological net of self-reported knowledge and overclaiming in childhood discussing three perspectives: Overclaiming as (a) a result of deliberate self-enhancement tendencies, (b) a proxy for declarative knowledge, and (c) an indicator of creative engagement. We juxtaposed overclaiming, as indicated by claiming familiarity with non-existent terms, and self-reported knowledge with fluid and crystallized intelligence, creativity, and personality traits in a sample of 897 children attending third grade. The results of several latent variable analyses were similar to findings known from adult samples: We found no strong evidence for any of the competing perspectives on overclaiming. Just like in adults, individual differences in self-reported knowledge were strongly inflated by overclaiming, and only weakly related to declarative knowledge."
