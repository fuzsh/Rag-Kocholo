        "text": "Distillation is a separation method with a high energy demand, and it is aspired to run these processes close to minimum energy limit. The operation of a distillation column with minimum energy input means to operate the column with minimum reflux and reboil. This is characterized by the existence of a pinch point within the column. A novel method for the calculation of minimum reflux is presented. This method needs the knowledge of the phase equilibrium at the feed concentration only. With this data the characteristic direction of the internal concentration profile can be deduced. A further step leads to the direct calculation of the minimum reflux without any iteration. This method can be used for rough estimations and for calculating a starting value for rigorous column simulations. It is valid for continuous distillation and batch distillation with constant distillate concentration."
