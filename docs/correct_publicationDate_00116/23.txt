Documents Relating To The Sentimental Agents In The Volyen Empire - 1st Edition/1st Printing

Doris Lessing

A charming first edition/first printing in Very Fine/Very Fine condition. SIGNED by author and Nobel Prize winner Doris Lessing directly on the half-title page.

In her Canopus in Argos series, Nobel laureate Lessing creates a "space" fiction universe to metaphorically explore spiritual, cultural and social issues. With debased language, propaganda, and political rhetoric as its theme, Vol. V uses social satire to document the disintegration of a weaker empire as agents from the more powerful Canopus, Sirius, and Shammat compete to manipulate Volyen's citizens; Canopus in Argos: Archives; Vol. 5; 8vo; [viii], 178, [6] pages; Signed by Author.
