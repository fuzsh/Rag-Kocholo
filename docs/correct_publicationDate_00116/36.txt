This must be the first time the Nobel Prize for Literature goes to a author that I have read (and very much enjoyed).

that epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny

I don’t really get the motivation given by the Svenska Akademien but I do think she is well worth the prize.

The latest book I have read by Doris Lessing is “Mara and Dann”. The ones that I remember most strongly is the series “Canopus in Argos: Archives” with books like Shikasta and The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire.

Make time to read books! Get e.g. one of Doris Lessing books and give yourself some perspective on life, the universe, and everything.
