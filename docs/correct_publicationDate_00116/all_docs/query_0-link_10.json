        "text": "By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN\n\nDOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE SENTIMENTAL AGENTS IN THE VOLYEN EMPIRE\n\nCanopus in Argos: Archives. By Doris Lessing.\n\nhen George Orwell complained just after World War II about the decay of the English language, he insisted that its decline was not inevitable. While pessimists argued that our language - like the civilization it reflects - was doomed, Orwell insisted that ''The process is reversible.'' If language is languishing, he urged its rescue; if thought is sloppy, well, it was time to think clearly.\n\nNow, writing out of the same country as Orwell, but out of a less pragmatic political tradition, the British novelist Doris Lessing repeats Orwell's lament about language. But it has become more urgent. ''Words, words, words, words,'' a character cries in her latest novel. In fact, language has become so grotesquely distended in her fictional realm that citizens suffer from a condition known as Undulant Rhetoric. Their eyes glaze, their breathing becomes heavy, and out of their mouths come symptoms of political intoxication:\n\nThe ''ritual patriotic mode'': ''We shall fight them on the beaches, we shall fight them on the roads, we shall fight them in the air!''\n\nThe postrevolutionary mode: ''The worms and maggots that have crept into our healthy new society will be squeezed out and exposed before the bar of history.''\n\nSo serious are these disabilities that sufferers are placed in the Hospital for Rhetorical Diseases, where they go on the rhetorical wagon and are treated for their addictions.\n\nThis world of language gone awry is similar enough to our own, but Mrs. Lessing, in her own rhetorical venture, actually locates it in another part of our galaxy, on the outside edge of a spiral arm. There, on the planet of a ''Class 18'' star, revolutionary struggles are taking place. The once thriving Volyen Empire is about to fall prey to the Sirian Empire, on whose expansive celestial realm the sun never sets. As the Volyen Empire begins to disintegrate, revolutionaries are waiting to seize power, opportunists are ready to claim resources, and patient stoics bide their galactic time.\n\n''The Sentimental Agents In the Volyen Empire'' can be read on its own, but it is the fifth volume of Mrs. Lessing's series of visionary novels, ''Canopus in Argos: Archives.'' The archives are those of a galactic empire of nearly awesome beneficence. Canopus, an empire as grand as the Sirians' but far more enlightened, has its predecessors in science fiction - it fills a role similar to that of the protective Second Foundation in Isaac Asimov's ''Foundation'' books. Wherever there is trouble in the universe, there agents from Canopus will be, attempting to straighten it all out and, in the process, teach the galaxy how to live with Harmony and Purpose. And in opposition to their omniscient protectiveness is the Empire of Shammat, an empire so evil that it causes trouble just for the fun of it.\n\nIn the Volyen Empire, then, there are a number of Canopean agents stationed to watch over the precarious political situation, which is being provoked more by agents from competing powers than by Volyen's own citizens. Canopus must also make sure that as the Sirian Empire moves in on Volyen, the evil forces of Shammat are prevented from cashing in on the confusion.\n\nMuch has already been said about the transformation of Mrs. Lessing from a realist who chronicled contemporary human relations and political movements in her earlier novels to the fantasist behind this confounding series of books which began appearing four years ago - ''Re: Colonised Planet 5, Shikasta,'' ''The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four, and Five,'' ''The Sirian Experiments'' and ''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8.'' The most recent set of ''archives'' seems an anomaly even among its predecessors. ''The Sentimental Agents'' is a satirical romp through rhetoric in a foreign empire. But simply because of its minor ambitions - and major flaws - it also sheds some light on what Mrs. Lessing has been up to in this series and just where her galactic expedition is heading.\n\nThe archival documents in ''The Sentimental Agents'' are messages from Klorathy - the all-patient, angelic Canopean agent who was introduced in ''The Sirian Experiments.'' Much of Klorathy's time is spent with another Canopean agent, who, because of a ''sentimental'' weakness, is so fraught with sorrow over the poverty and oppression he sees about him that he falls prey to revolutionary rhetoric - much as Mrs. Lessing did herself, when in the early 1940's in Southern Rhodesia she joined the Communist Party, remaining a member until 1956.\n\nOther concerns of Klorathy during this period of crisis include an attempt to dissuade a poor planet endowed with rich mineral deposits from taking a simplistic revolutionary position, urging it instead to become economically self-sufficient through the development of its own food supply - a red lichen which grows on stone and is dubbed (rather unfortunately) ''Rocknosh.'' And in Volyen, the decadent finde-siecle atmosphere is meant to recall nothing less than the final days of the British Empire - and the West as a whole.\n\nMrs. Lessing, who herself left the English Communist Party following the Russian invasion of Hungary and Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin, casts a cold eye on the delusions of those who ruthlessly castigate liberal regimes for their injustices while extravagantly idealizing the most oppressive of totalitarian realms. She touches on the rhetoric of empire as well - its pretense to conquer and rule solely for the good of its colonies. Words become tools used for ''enslavement, or manipulation, or concealment or arousal.'' As Orwell showed far more subtly in the ''Newspeak'' of ''1984,'' tyrants become benefactors, sadists saints, war peace and barbarism progress. The Canopeans, seeing through this rhetoric, teach, in fact, that an empire lasts only as long as it does not take its own benevolent rhetoric seriously.\n\nThis novel would seem, then, to be a dark satire indeed, a dissection of the political illusions of our own terrestial 20th century - and a parable about how language is debased when used as an instrument of power.\n\nYet a curious thing happens in this book: Whatever promise it offers of satire and enlightened vision dissipates into cliche and platitude. The humor falls flat, the rhetorical jests become tiresome and the political insights seem derivative. The tone wavers uncertainly, mixing farce, cynicism and banal religiosity.\n\nFor rather than showing how rhetorical excess distorts political ideas, Mrs. Lessing finds nothing behind political rhetoric at all. Klorathy asserts, for example, that the French Revolution - a historical example taken from the planet the Canopeans call Shikasta (known to us as Earth) -built an ''orgy of killing'' on an ''orgy of words, words, words.'' Here, as elsewhere, it is as if words (''Liberty or Death!'') are themselves evil and not that they derive their power from the ideas they are supposed to embody.\n\nBut if there are no ideas worthy of our consideration, it matters little what they are or who is holding them. When references are made to earthly politics, here and in the previous books, there is no distinction made between West and East, democracy or totalitarianism. Though the revolutionary rhetoric of the Left is a major target in this book, from Mrs. Lessing's transcendental perspective all positions are equally deluded. Rhetoric is disruptive because the realm of politics itself is corrupt and corrupting; it is ''sentimental.'' Politics is founded on impulsiveness, overwrought sympathy, imperfect solutions and ambiguous decisions, while the path to utopia, Mrs. Lessing indicates, leads exactly in the opposite direction.\n\nMrs. Lessing argues that changes in the political realm -the rise and fall of empires, the transformation of ideas, the evolution of societies - have nothing to do with the efforts of humans (or other beings) at all, but are ineluctably derived from the working out of universal Laws of the Galaxy. ''We are not in control of these processes,'' one character learns in ''The Sirian Experiments,'' and in the afterword to the fourth novel in the series, Mrs. Lessing agrees: ''Politicians and rulers are not the makers of events, but their puppets.''\n\nThere is, then, no ''responsibility'' in Mrs. Lessing's universe. Even Germany in World War II, it is suggested in ''Shikasta,'' may not be considered wholly responsible for its actions. Human civilization, in fact, may take no credit for itself either. It developed entirely because of extraterrestial forces. Neither in ''Shikasta'' nor in ''The Sirian Experiments,'' which deal with versions of earthly history, are the actions of human beings of any significance. Cosmic forces fight their way across the earthly stage, importing species of various shapes and colors, waging strategic wars between good and evil. ''Natives'' become puppets in intergalactic maneuverings that range from the construction of Stonehenge and the destruction of Atlantis to the warfare of this century.\n\nThe Canopeans, understanding how to balance opposing powers, are the forces of Good, dispensing compassion for all suffering. They are the divinities who omnisciently attempt to bring others along with them in a spiritual evolutionary path to Cosmic Consciousness, known in this book as the ''path of the Purpose.'' That path, toward a sense of ''we-feeling,'' leads away from the will and desires of the individual, which are evidence of ''Degenerative Disease'' and which contribute to Rhetorical Illnesses. All actions must be in ''harmony with the plan'' as it is put in ''Shikasta.'' The plan might be considered the Canopean Empire's version of a white man's burden for less developed species and races.\n\nA novelist, of course, has complete freedom in creating a fictional world. And this one may reflect the spiritual attitudes of Sufism, which Mrs. Lessing has been exploring in recent years. But Mrs. Lessing, in her created universe, affirms a sort of dialectical spiritualism. It is an ideology that leaves a deep hole in these Canopean books, into which most of Mrs. Lessing's considerable writing talents sink into darkness. ''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8,'' for example, ends as residents of a freezing planet transcend the material world, with a miraculous suddenness unconvincing even in the realm of science fiction. This sort of dogmatic faith is certainly a self-defeating stance for a writer whose gifts for exploring the nuances of interaction between individuals were apparent not only in her early fiction but in the lovely, haunting detail of ''The Marriages'' - an evolutionary fable that chooses to explore subtle shifts in consciousness rather than simply invoke them through an act of faith.\n\nMrs. Lessing, throughout her career, has straddled the rather uncomfortable contradiction between her concern and talent for evoking earthly particulars and her nearly religious attraction to Communism, to the psychiatry of R. D. Laing and, now, to Canopean idealism. The result in this book is saddening indeed. She rejects the entire realm of politics, but her proposed substitution has its own political ideology.\n\nThis is most evident when she hints at analogies beween her fictional empires and the mundane political realms on Earth. She implies here, as she did in the earlier volumes, that all earthly governments, all policies, are interchangeable. But even her divine Canopeans lose a bit of their cool when stating their cosmically ''correct'' position about contemporary earthlings: The ''white race'' on Earth is a 20th-century version of the Mongol hordes, the rapacious destroyer of superior harmonious civilizations, and of an evil so great that - as one trusted character asserts in ''The Sirian Experiments'' - it has no equal in the entire history of the galaxy. Their ''nature,'' Klorathy points out, is ''Shammat'' - decay and dissolution. Mrs. Lessing firmly draws the battle lines.\n\nThis is, then, itself a ''rhetorical'' book. Like the political cliches Mrs. Lessing satirizes, it calls for ''the great will, the great purpose, the great decision.'' It leans back on the ''cunning of History.'' It establishes absolutes of good and evil. And if political rhetoric ignores differences and distinctions, and submerges the individual in undulant swells of universal platitudes and invocations, Mrs. Lessing's own position is not too different.\n\nFar from being a herald of a new world vision, Mrs. Lessing presents one that is all too familiar. Her cosmos, with its benevolent Canopean Empire offering protection and compassion, with its Universal Law and the irrelevance of earthly politics, may seem comforting to a world in which rhetorical difficulties are not the only ones. But this vision is, in fact, a symptom of the very decline that she is warning against. George Orwell is much less comforting but offers much more hope.\n\nEdward Rothstein is a music critic of The New York Times."
