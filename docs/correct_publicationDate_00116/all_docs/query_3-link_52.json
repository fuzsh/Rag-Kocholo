Her father had been a soldier who was nearly killed in a burst of shrapnel during World War I in an incident in which he lost his leg.\n\nHe had met his mother who was a nurse at the London hospital where he was sent to recover after his amputation. In 1925, Lessing’s family moved to Zimbabwe to become maize farmers even though they struggled in the endeavor.\n\nIt was an unhappy childhood and Lessing remembers living in an inhuman, cold, and provincial society and she was always running from her mother or fighting with her.\n\nImmersed in works that had been sent to the family from a book club in London Lesingquit school as a fourteen-year-old and moved to Harare where she had just landed a job as a telephone operator.\n\nWhen she was 19 she got married to Frank Wisdom her first husband and the two would get two children before they divorced in 1943.\n\nShe attributed the divorce to the fact that she was too intelligent to be stuck with a small child the whole day, which she found too boring.\n\nAfter her divorce, Doris Lessing moved to England as a single mother. With hardly any qualifications, you would believe that she would have a hard time but she would rise to become one of the most important figures in English literature post-war.\n\nShe made her debut with the 1950 published work “The Grass is Singing,” which was all about interracial relations in Zimbabwe. The work was very popular in the United States and Europe that astounded audiences in the United States and in Europe.\n\nThe work was penned in the form of extended flashbacks that combined searing social critiques of colonial wrongs and stinging observations from her own childhood.\n\nAfter achieving success very early on, Lessing finally had the money to pay a family to take care of Peter her son so that she could write her novels. “Five Short Novels” published in 1953 was the winner of the Somerset Maugham Prize in 1954.\n\nWorking with a literary intelligentsia that tended to be very left-wing, she would become an active critic of South African Apartheid and also campaigned for nuclear disarmament.\n\nHer political views would result in Doris getting banned from Zimbabwe and South Africa for several decades.\n\nHowever, it was with the publishing of “The Golden Notebook” that Doris Lessing would become a renowned literary fiction author.\n\nShe would transform into a reluctant feminist icon when she penned what many people deem to be her magnum opus. The work explored themes of mental breakdown, feminism, motherhood, and communism.\n\nIt was also a daring experiment as it offered candid depictions of orgasms, menstruation, and the tension between erotic and maternal life.\n\nWhile she was deemed the ultimate feminist icon in literature she never intended it to be that and said that it was some form of albatross for the rest of her life.\n\nIn the intervening years, she started experimenting more and got into the writing of science fiction which was very unpopular with literary critics.\n\nFrustrated with how the literary establishment was trying to restrict her to a box, she would publish “If the Old Could” and “The Diary of a Good Neighbor” under the pen name Jane Somers.\n\nAs expected, her publishers refused to publish the two works as they highlighted how many unknown novelists were treated terribly in the publishing industry.\n\nDespite being lambasted by the media in the intervening years, she would win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2007.\n\nDoris Lessing’s novel “Shikasta” is a work that is a combination of direct reports compiled by Johor the envoy. In addition, to the reports are entries and letters from history books and some memorandums.\n\nThe work is a chronicle of the history of Earth referred to as Shikasta from the time of its early beginnings to some point in the future.\n\nCanopus the protagonist takes the lead in developing higher life forms as he migrates species from one of the colonies in the universe. He also builds cities by making them take advantage of invisible energy flows.\n\nHe also established a direct channel of energy between the Earth and himself thus guiding the development of knowledge and guaranteeing the transfer of the same from himself to the world he has built.\n\nBut then his channel is interrupted when the cosmic constellation changes inexplicably.\n\nOn the other hand, Shammat drains whatever had been left and Shikasta goes into a regression that results in more than 100 years of war, culminating in the Second World War.\n\nLessing models his galactic entities on fundamental human traits as Shammat is the embodiment of evil while Canopus represents everything that the ideal man should aim to be.\n\nDoris Lessing’s “The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four, and Five” introduces Ben Ata as a gritty and interesting character. He is the epitome of the patriarchal zone frozen in time that the author dramatizes at first using fables.\n\nAl Ith who is a representation of the frozen-in-time matriarchal sensibilities is both fascinated and repelled by Ben Ata. In the matriarchal framework, intuition is greatly valued and this had resulted in a harmonious trance.\n\nAt some point, the providers call them and they are instructed to embark on a marriage that is to be set in Ben Ata’s framework. Their staying together is pledged by the sound of a dream beat that sounds at the place designed to be their new home.\n\nEvery time the drum beat stops which it does at varying intervals, they will have to separate from each other and reflect on their relationship.\n\nIt is a unique exploration of the conflict that is inevitable between the language and politics of the active rational, and the receptive intuitive which are often opposed to each other.\n\nDoris Lessing’s “The Sirian Experiments” is a work that narrates a tale from the perspective of the Sirians. They had been sharing their world with the Canopeans and they had been given the southern parts of the world for their experiments.\n\nThe lead writer is an administrator named Ambien II who has been in contact with Canopus and Rohanda for millennia. She pens this work at a time when she has finally come to a good understanding of Canopus.\n\nFor the longest time, the Sirians have been desperately trying to understand planet management from the Canopus and believe that Canopus has been needlessly deceitful and obscure."
