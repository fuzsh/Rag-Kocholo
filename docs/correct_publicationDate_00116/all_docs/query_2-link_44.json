        "text": "Doris Lessing, the Nobel Prize winner of 2007 is one of the outstanding novelists of modern English literature. In her novels, there is space for memories, retrospection, introspection, foreshadow, flashback and terrible recognitions that are hued by torment and trauma. She displays a well-crafted plot, occurrence, meditative or philosophical description that suggest the workings of the deep layers of the mind. Her writing embodies and extends open panoply of subjects explicit to late-twentieth-century consciousness: race; the conflict of the generations; psychological dimensions of male female relations; philosophical inquiries regarding life; the nature and planes of the real world; exploration of psychological illness, and modes of consciousness. Her writing portrays realism, and is packed with the technique of myth and speculation. In spite of her genius, she set her characters against the backdrop of human history to demonstrate their experience.\n\nTrauma involves a rupture in the temporal and symbolic orders at individual and collective levels. Fictional representation of trauma, therefore, is marked by a problem of referentiality, where mimesis fails and chronology breaks down. The article opens with a discussion on the disorientation in the co-ordinative links between the world, the self, and representational tools in the event of a traumatic experience, which results in the crisis of referentiality. The inadequacy of language as a representational medium on the one hand, and unacknowledgement of extreme events beyond \" socially validated reality \" on the other, constitute two of the major issues creative artists have to deal with. An extreme event leaves a mnemonic gap in the psyche of the traumatized individual, and the process of recovery involves the gap being filled in with narrative memory, suggesting an epistemological void. Narrative memory acts as the surrogate memory of the traumatic event, which is unavailable to willed recollection. This surrogate memory is compared to Jean Baudrillard's third order of simulation, where a false presence conceals the absence of any basic reality. Recognizing the referential and representational crises at work in rendering traumatic experiences in fiction, the article goes on to explore the ways of bypassing them and discuss the idea of indirect representation in Michael Rothberg's Traumatic Realism: The Demands of Holocaust Representation. Rothberg believes that an oblique rendition of traumatic events in fiction may be an appropriate representational mode within the conflicting demands of the documentation of reality, meditation on the formal limits by the creative artist, and risky circulation of images in the globalized world. This leads to a deliberation on Anne Whitehead and Laurie Vickroy's idea of the emerging genre of \" trauma fiction \" with its thematic and stylistic concerns. The article ends with a summary of the representational techniques likely to feature in fictions written on violent events.\n\nDoris Lessing’s novels reveal the way in which war affects humanity by capturing the traumatic state of the author herself and also of the characters in her works. As a result of the two world wars, in the twentieth century, trauma emerges as a paradigmatic discourse for defining its catastrophic, disastrous and injurious aftermaths. In the novels Martha Quest and A Proper Marriage, the author shows how the war is an extremely traumatic experience for those who are direct witness to its violence and how it wreaks havoc on the entire generation. In A Proper Marriage, there is no particular mention of any catastrophic effects of war. The novel vividly portrays the anxiety which people suffer before a war. The catastrophe of the World War-I aggravates the impact of the forth coming World War-II. Hasty marriages and pregnancies are manipulated as the ways to escape the trauma of the impending war. Such discourse of trauma of wars, with its vivid catastrophic and disastrous effects on the people, narrated in the Martha Quest and A Proper Marriage, forms the topics of investigation and discussion in the present paper. The paper also explores and discusses how scientific war accelerated the destruction of the youth without coming to their aid. Attempt has also been made to shed light upon various techniques of escapism used by the characters to survive in the chaotic world. Keywords: Doris Lessing’s Novels, Paradigmatic Discourse, Stress Disorder, Martha Quest, Trauma of war, escapism\n\nTo become a true scholar on the subject of the Doris Lessing protagonist is to accept the roles of her protagonists, despite their likelihood to be female, without definition or resolution. To achieve a sense of Doris Lessing‘s purpose is to accept the idea that an institutionalized purpose is preposterous, despite her common themes of madness. To appreciate Doris Lessing from a literary stance is to accept her word that she writes without any feminist persuasion. As Katherine Fishburen said, ―Through the metaphor of her fiction, we learn that the meaning of the world eludes us if we try, by constitutionalizing or labeling it, to pin it down‖ (qtd in Kaplan 90). Doris Lessing believed that instead of attempting to explain the world, we should simply experience it, and her characters reinforce this idea.\n\nAbtract: Speculative fiction has always provided a suitable ground for contesting social constructions such as strict gender roles and conventional views on sexuality. In the 1970s especially, with the influence of second wave feminism, speculative fiction authors began to depict the political struggle of women in fictional universes which presented alternative modes of subjectivity and social structures. Doris Lessing’s The Memoirs of a Survivor (1974) and Joanna Russ’s The Female Man (1975) make use of the historically-situated nature of speculative fiction to narrate their experiences, reflect personal as well as political struggles in fictional alternate and future worlds which are indeed reflections of the here and now. Both Lessing and Russ combine autobiographical and fictional elements in their exploration of female subjectivity and experience. This preference leads to a more genuine, less generalized impression of female identity and solidarity. In The Memoirs of a Survivor, described as “an attempt at autobiography” by its author, Lessing integrates personal experiences from her own life into the text while exploring a post-apocalyptic, or more precisely, a post-“Crisis” world. Although the events take place in a fictional future, they are influenced by the author’s past in real life. Similarly, in The Female Man, Russ adds autobiographical elements into the text, especially her experiences as a lesbian feminist and her struggle to exist in male-dominated environments. FM presents four different alternate narratives, two of which take place in the future (one is a utopia and the other is a dystopia); however, all of them express a different version of women’s, and of course Joanna Russ’, struggle in life. Both FM and Memoirs therefore reflect the multiplicity and plurality of the voices of women, and by employing speculative fiction tropes, they point to diverse ways of confronting oppressive ideologies both collectively and individually.\n\nAs a genre, apocalyptic fiction has experienced a boom in popularity in recent years. This essay focuses on representations of trauma theory in apocalyptic fiction, specifically in Emily St. John Mandel's novel Station Eleven. Trauma theory has evolved and expanded rapidly since Freud's original work, and applying it to apocalyptic fiction is an effective way to illuminate and extrapolate trauma theory's more complex points. The trauma lens, in return, provides context and insight into the experiences of the characters that populate apocalyptic texts. Station Eleven covers a broad range of trauma-related experience, including multiple character viewpoints; simultaneous timelines of before, after, and long-after the end of civilization; and an ongoing debate on memory. Much of the conflict in the plot of Station Eleven mirrors the very conflict of the experience of trauma itself: it showcases the different approaches the human psyche may take in its attempt to absorb that which is unabsorbable. By exploring the relationship between trauma reactions, such as various coping mechanisms that arise, and apocalyptic fiction, it is possible to imagine how a decimated society of traumatized survivors rebuilds a world.\n\nThere has been a particular interest in trauma studies since the end of the twentieth century; not just in psychology and psychiatry, the main fields of study concerning mental disorders, but in every aspect of life. Consequently, a growing number of publications have been published that approach trauma from various fields: social and literary studies, comparative literature, philosophy, ethics, etc. At the same time, from talk shows to the news broadcasts, from popular media (post-apocalyptic movies, disaster films, games to art movies), from direct testimonies of survivors to fictive accounts of traumatic experience, there is a proliferation of all kinds of representations of trauma to the extent that testimony has been suggested as “the literary mode […] of our times”, whereas “our era can precisely be defined as the age of testimony” (Felman 1995: 17). The question naturally arises whether trauma has become a cliché in contemporary literature and culture, or whether literature h...\n\nTrauma narratives are “marked by interruptions, temporal disorder, refusal of easy readerly identification, disarming play with narrative framing, disjunct movements in style, tense, focalization or discourse, and a resistance to closure that is demonstrated in compulsive telling and retelling.” The trauma genre is avant-garde, experimental, and fragmented; it refuses the consolations of beautiful form, and is suspicious of conventions. Its resistance to closure can be paired with a view, especially in W. G. Sebald, that trauma is permanent and cannot be healed, but can at best be witnessed. The ways in which trauma simultaneously defies and demands readers’ witness, not a simple knowledge of the event, is what marks it as trauma. Trauma writers such as Sebald and Patrick Modiano interrupt their narratives with excerpts, images, and digressions. They frame their narratives by layering voices, often beyond two degrees of separation from the narrator.\n\nIn this study, our aim is to read the novel titled The Memoirs of a Survivor: An Attempt at Autobiography as a depiction and critique of the human/environment relationship, and to explore dualisms embedded in modern thought as portrayed in the novel. The text offers insight into the current debates about the human-nature relationship, and underlines the dualistic tendencies prevalent in the discourse of modernity. It gives an account of the chaotic events that the narrator experiences at a time when civilisation collapses and human constructs fail to function, and depicts human beings’ struggle for survival when law and other systems are dysfunctional. By depicting a collapsing civilization and exploring the relationship between human and nature, the text also portrays human’s alienation. The failure of civilization, which is contingent on the failure to recognise the ties among all beings, is at the heart of the text. As well as providing a critique of the cult of progress, the novel also suggests a possible solution to this crisis in civilization. In this paper, our aim is to read the novel as an attempt to define the sources of the above-mentioned crisis, and to focus on those aspects of the text which lay bare the dichotomous thinking which modern thought is largely based on. We believe that this text contributes to the debates about human’s relationship to other entities, and that it can be read as a commentary on such current issues as the Covid-19 pandemic and its possible consequences."
