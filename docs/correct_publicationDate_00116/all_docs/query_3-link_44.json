In his introduction to the book, Reilly argues that ‘One can… see that physical science can be included within the scope of [the] definition of religion. It uses rational means to explain order in the universe and provides a relationship (the experimental method) to the source of order. The scientists themselves are a sort of priesthood’ (p. 3). Doris Lessing expresses a similar point of view. In an interview published in 1980, she postulates: The best scientists, those on the highest levels, always come closer and closer to the mystical. Much of what Einstein said could have been said by a Christian mystic, St. Augustine, for example. Science, which is the religion for today, looks for the metaphysical… Hence the boom in science fiction, which reflects this preoccupation and which moves in the world of the non-rational.\n\nN.
