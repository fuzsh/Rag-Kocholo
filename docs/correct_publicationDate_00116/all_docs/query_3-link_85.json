CANOPUS IN ARGOS: ARCHIVES comprising RE: COLONISED PLANET 5 SHIKASTA, THE MARRIAGES BETWEEN ZONES THREE, FOUR, AND FIVE, THE SIRIAN EXPERIMENTS, THE MAKING OF THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR PLANET 8, and DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE SENTIMENTAL AGENTS IN THE VOLYEN EMPIRE. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1979-1983. Octavo, five volumes, cloth. First editions. Complete set of Canopus in Argos: Archives comprising RE: COLONISED PLANET 5 SHIKASTA (1979), THE MARRIAGES BETWEEN ZONES THREE, FOUR, AND FIVE (1980), THE SIRIAN EXPERIMENTS (1981), THE MAKING OF THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR PLANET 8 (1982), and DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE SENTIMENTAL AGENTS IN THE VOLYEN EMPIRE (1983). An epic tale of the major galactic empires: Canopus, Sirius and Puttiora, and their rivalries and interactions. \"Shikasta is Earth, whose history -- extended over millions of years -- is here put into the cosmic perspective, observed by Canopeans who seem to be in charge of galactic history although responsible to some higher, impersonal authority. The sequels follow the exploits of various human cultures whose affairs are subtly influenced by the Canopeans; all share the remotely detached perspective the transforms the way in which individual endeavors are seen. Thoughtful and painstaking.\" - Anatomy of Wonder (2004) II-664. \"Lessing is a major novelist, and her first full-blown foray into SF caused some consternation and controversy. It also elicited much praise. The philosophical tale of galactic empires in conflict, the opening volume concerns the visit of an emissary from benign Canopus to the colonized (but fallen) planet Earth, now renamed 'Shikasta.' Here and in the following volumes, our planet's affairs are put into a very wide context indeed.\" - Pringle, The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction, second edition (1995), p. 325. \"Lessing's primary cosmological and ethical source is the Old Testament, though she blends in stuff from Blake, Gilgamest, Celtic and Arabic traditions; and of course von Daniken.\" - Colin Greenwood, Foundation. Sargent, British and American Utopian Literature, 1516-1985, pp. 394; 401; 412; 418. A fine set in fine dust jackets. (#169571).\n\nPrice: $1,000.00"
