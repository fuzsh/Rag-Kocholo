        "text": "1In her space fiction, Doris Lessing makes clear her aim to encourage us to look at our individual and collective identities more objectively. Included in this study of identity, of our role as a member of a society based on group affiliation, are works which can be considered under the rubric of what Lessing calls ‘space fiction’: the five novels of Canopus in Argos: Archives, as well as Briefing for a Descent into Hell and Memoirs of a Survivor, all of which have more to do with their effects on inner rather than outer space, at least in terms of our interest in identity construction. Nevertheless, ‘space’ fiction is also important in a geographic sense, as we human beings are often defined in terms of our ‘place’; our relationship to others. Our insertion in this network happens automatically, and seemingly with our cooperation, from the very beginning; we are born into the ‘game’. We are defined, and our sense of self is determined by our membership in certain groups, or by our ‘co-ordinates’ on a cultural map which seems to represent reality.\n\n2Our identity is also defined ideologically, through a body of received ideas which are the ‘rules of the game’ just mentioned (Bourdieu 111–113), and which ensure the integration of those who play by the rules. It is important to believe in the game, because such cultural baggage is in fact a falsehood, what Kathleen Kirby calls a ‘functional fiction’, which nevertheless has profound effects and very real consequences in the daily lives of subjects (39), becoming a social text, the product as well as the producer of meaning, knowledge, and ultimately reality for all of us, defining the norm among and between groups, and our individual and collective identity as a result. Belief in the display is absolutely necessary, otherwise ‘reality’ itself would no longer exist. To improve our condition, Lessing argues, we must resist these ideologies of fracture, and become infidels toward the logic of predatory groups which have defined our position, and ultimately we must adhere to a philosophy of ‘us’ in a truly universal sense.\n\n3In Doris Lessing’s Briefing for a Descent into Hell, for example, even a messenger from the gods will not be taken seriously if he gets too far away from accepted social norms; his difference will earn him the label of ‘insane’. His ‘identity’, his proper place in society, will be imposed on him, from the simple starting point of some papers found in his wallet and a handful of testimonies from his family and colleagues. The institution of psychiatry, as a tool of the dominant power, has become the filter through which eccentric voices must pass. Lessing, as a means of social critique, dislocates the reference points which support the dominant ideology, and in such a destabilized society, the madman becomes the voice of reason within an insane community.\n\n4In Memoirs of a Survivor, civilized society has broken down into general anarchy, and with it people’s certitude regarding their place; as a solution, they form themselves into tribes, thus proving that social evolution, though very slow to progress, can be reversed overnight. The pillars which support ‘civilized’ society, being largely cultural constructions, even outright lies, have revealed their fragility. The genuine solution offered in the novel is to find a space outside the status quo, outside the ‘common sense’ of predatory groups in search of an identity, not at the level of tribes but in a truly universal sense.\n\n5In Shikasta, a formerly-utopian society has fallen away from its ideal, and has now divided itself into groups based on race, gender, nationality and such, against a backdrop of perpetual violence. As in Briefing, the ‘Link people’ are meant to guide the populations, but their message is not understood by most, hence the status quo is assured by marginalizing any criticism of the way things are.\n\n6The Marriages between Zones Three, Four and Five also questions the basis of an identity which is defined in spatial and geographic terms, in other words by group formation; the forced mixing of diverse cultures is commanded by the Providers as a means of healing the current social fractures. The organization of space is a very important tool in subject formation, since we find our place in relation to others on a geographic map which has, apparently, all the characteristics of a natural space in the real world. As the novel progresses, Lessing exposes the lie of impenetrable borders–borders are indeed fictions, but with very real effects, which define ‘us’ in relation to ‘them’ and at the same time give a sense of protection, a sense of security which comes at the price of isolation. Movement is limited, not only in a geographic sense but also in the sense of social evolution, since for Lessing social problems like war and imperialism are only symptoms of a deeper and more troubling illness, that of division into competitive and predatory groups.\n\n7The Sirian Experiments is the report of Ambien, a senior administrator, regarding the inter-galactic colonial project of the Sirian empire. Whereas initially Sirius fixes its identity between the poles of the indigenous natives and the planet Canopus, Ambien’s continual questioning of her relation to the Other leads to her realization that Sirian identity is interdependent with the Other in the largest sense, not something apart to be defined in dialectical fashion. Ambien’s insight does not come quickly; she must start at the beginning, as a member of the ruling elite with all of its preconceptions, and go all the way through her formation as a social critic, struggling at times with ideas that she only partly understands. While she is rewarded with greater insight regarding concepts like ‘necessity’ and ‘wholeness’, she is ostracized by her Sirian peers as no longer one of the Five, and sent away to corrective exile.\n\n8Like Ambien and the Link people, or the narrator of Memoirs or the king and queen of Zones, the representative of the title of The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 must look beyond the current situation, in this case the physical extinction of the entire population of a dying planet. The residents of this formerly- peaceful planet fall away from the utopian ideal as soon as their conditions begin to deteriorate. While waiting to die, the key characters literally change their identities as necessary, as a function of the group’s needs. As the residents of Planet 8 die one by one, those who remain, those who go furthest in their understanding, come to recognize their errors of perception from their ordinary senses; they will see more clearly with their ‘new eyes’ and will radically change their way of thinking as a result. The collective identity of these residents has been recovered, freed from any material anchors in a body or a geographic zone, to become an identity ultimately understood as both plural and one, but never fixed.\n\n9Group affiliation is a key concept throughout Lessing’s space fiction, and in The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire rhetoric is the tool which accomplishes this herd mentality as the basis for identity, a way of conditioning people to need a tyranny. Instead of geographic zones, groups are formed by means of rhetoric, which the agents target as their principal obstacle to positive change. Although in the minority, those who refuse the rhetoric of group minds succeed, at least for a short time, in their effort to see humanity in a more universal manner.\n\n10In 2003 The Grandmothers was published, a collection of four short novels, one of which, The Reason for It, must be mentioned in this study of questions of identity in Lessing’s space fiction. The Reason for It unites many of the themes which have been addressed in the space fiction series, in an attempt to ask: Why, given the overwhelming historical evidence that group formation always results in violence and mutual destruction, is the application of a collective, utopian ideal so difficult to achieve in practice?\n\n11Lessing, as a writer who takes seriously the task of exposing contradictions inherent in our present notions of ‘who we are’, encourages us to refuse membership in a society where identity is a closed subject. She reminds us that it is the ‘much longer story’ of humanity which must be our preoccupation, and our place within this whole: Lessing’s space fiction series identifies the universal problem—society’s division into competitive and predatory groups—and places it outside the bounds of time and space, encouraging a critique which takes into account our inherited blindness, our ‘degenerative disease’ which must be addressed before positive social transformation can take place. The principal anxieties of our day—discrimination of all sorts, economic exploitation, war—are all symptoms of this underlying problem, namely that people are defined and identified by their place within certain groups, and if we are to improve our condition we must address this fundamental cause rather than simply treat the symptoms. Seemingly-material anchors ground everyday reality and identity, and Lessing’s space fiction does nothing if not insist that such hierarchies and group affiliations, which propose order and security at the price of isolation and conformity, must be abandoned if identity is to be understood on a universal basis, without credentials, without exclusion, and ultimately, without violence."
