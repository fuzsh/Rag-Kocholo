        "text": "Lessing was born in Iran on 22 October 1919. Her parents were both English. They met at the Royal Free Hospital. Her father, Captain Alfred Tayler, was a patient because he had lost his leg in World War I. Her mother, Emily Maude Tayler (maiden name McVeagh), was a nurse.[4][5][6]\n\nAlfred Tayler and his wife moved to Kermanshah, Iran. He started a job there as a clerk for the Imperial Bank of Persia. Doris was born here in 1919.[7][8] Later, the family moved to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia (now called Zimbabwe) in 1925 to farm maize.\n\nLessing studied at the Dominican Convent High School in Salisbury (now Harare). It was a Roman Catholic convent school for girls.[9] She left school aged 14, and taught herself after that. She left home at 15 and worked as a nursemaid. She started reading about politics and sociology[6] and began writing around this time. In 1937, Lessing moved to Salisbury to work as a telephone operator. She soon married her first husband, Frank Wisdom. They had two children (John and Jean), before the marriage ended in 1943.[6] She took care of future author Jenny Diski after her parents abused her. Diski lived with Lessing for four years in London.\n\nAfter her divorce, Lessing became more involved with members of the Left Book Club. She had joined this communist book club the year before.[10][11] She met her second husband, Gottfried Lessing there. They married soon after she joined the group, and had a child named Peter. This marriage ended in divorce in 1949. Gottfried Lessing later became the East German ambassador to Uganda. He was murdered in the 1979 rebellion against Idi Amin Dada.[6]"
