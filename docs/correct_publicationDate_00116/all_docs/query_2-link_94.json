        "text": "The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (a.k.a. the Whorfian hypothesis) concerns the relationship between language and thought. Neither the anthropological linguist Edward Sapir (b. 1884–d. 1939) nor his student Benjamin Whorf (b. 1897–d. 1941) ever formally stated any single hypothesis about the influence of language on nonlinguistic cognition and perception. On the basis of their writings, however, two proposals emerged, generating decades of controversy among anthropologists, linguists, philosophers, and psychologists. According to the more radical proposal, linguistic determinism, the languages that people speak rigidly determine the way they perceive and understand the world. On the more moderate proposal, linguistic relativity, habits of using language influence habits of thinking. As a result, people who speak different languages think differently in predictable ways. During the latter half of the 20th century, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was widely regarded as false. Around the turn of t...\n\nSome have sought to describe the form of the relationship between language and mind, or more narrowed again, how language affects the human mind. Of the many characters that describes the relationship between language and mind, the authors saw that the exposure of Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf is widely cited by various researchers in examining the relationship of language and mind. Sapir and Worf says that there is no two languages that have similarities to be considered as the same social reality. Sapir and Worf describe two hypotheses about the relationship between language and thought. The influence of language on thought can occur through habituation and operation of the formal aspects of language, for example gramar and lexicon. Whorf said that \"grammatical and lexical resources of individual languages heavily constrain the conceptual representations available to their speakers\". Gramar and the lexicon in a language determines that there is a conceptual representation of the user's language.\n\nThe history of empirical research on the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is reviewed. A more sensitive test of the hypothesis is devised and a clear Whorfian effect is detected in the domain of color. A specijic mechanism is proposed to account for this effect and a second experiment , designed to block the hypothesized mechanism, is performed. The effect disappears as predicted. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is reevaluated in the light of these results. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND THE DOCTRINE OF RADICAL LINGUISTIC RELATIVITY is to be understood historically as a reaction to the denigrating attitude toward unwritten languages that was fostered by the evolutionary view prevalent in anthropology in the 19th century. Subsequently, the research of Boas and his students showed these languages to be as systematic and as logically rich as any European language, and it was perhaps inevitable that the latter finding should spawn a doctrine on non-European languages and cultures antithetical to the evolutionary view. If this doctrine of radical relativity has led to certain excesses of its own-in which the valid insistence on the integrity of each linguistic system has led to an underestimation of their common structural features-we should not forget that it nonetheless supplied a needed corrective to the ethnocentric evolutionism it replaced. Indeed, outside of certain rarified academic milieux, the early relativists' battle for a rational and unprejudiced view of our nonliterate contemporaries is not yet won. Sapir was Boas's student and Whorf, Sapir's. The following two passages are among the most frequently cited from Sapir and Whorf, respectively. In the first, Sapir expresses , in terms no less lucid for being poetic, the basic empirical finding of the Boasians on the formal completeness and intellectual adequacy of unwritten languages. Both simple and complex types of language of an indefinite number of varieties may be found spoken at any desired level of cultural advance. When it comes to linguistic form, Plato walks with the Macedonian swineherd, Confucius with the headhunting savage of Assam. [Sapir 1921 : 21 91 In the second passage, Whorf takes the further step, foreshadowed in other writings of"
