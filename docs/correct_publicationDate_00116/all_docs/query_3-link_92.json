        "text": "Biography\n\nDoris Lessing was born Doris Tayler (note spelling) in Kermanshah in what was then Persia, in 1919. She grew up on a farm in Southern Rhodesia, her family moving there when she was six. Unfortunately, the farm was not financially successful. She left school at the age of thirteen and subsequently educated herself. When she was sixteen, she started work for the telephone company. She later worked for a firm of lawyers and then for the Southern Rhodesian parliament. In 1947 she moved to Cape Town and then, in 1949, to London. In 1939, she married Frank Wisdom. They had two children but they divorced in four years later. In 1945 she married Gottfried Lessing, a German communist, and they had a son, Peter. After they moved to England, Gottfried moved to East Germany, where he eventually became trade commissar. He was killed in Uganda in 1979 while ambassador there. While initially a communist, Lessing soon became disillusioned with it and eventually quit the Party. By his time she had started writing and her first novel, The Grass Is Singing, about white settlers in Rhodesia was successful, not least because it was one of the first works to expose apartheid to the English. With her emphasis on the role of women, consciousness, mysticism (she has been an adherent of Sufism) and various left-wing causes, her writings have been consistently successful and well-received by both critics and the reading public. She won the Nobel Prize in 2007. She died in 2013.\n\nBooks about Doris Lessing\n\nKatherine Fishburn: Doris Lessing: Life, Work and Criticism\n\nCarole Klein: Doris Lessing: a Biography\n\nMargaret Moan Rowe: Doris Lessing\n\nRuth Whittaker: Doris Lessing\n\nOther sites\n\nDoris Lessing\n\nDoris Lessing\n\nDoris Lessing\n\nDoris Lessing\n\nDoris Lessing\n\nDoris Lessing: A Retrospective\n\nLessing, Doris\n\nSept 11 ‘not that terrible’ says Doris Lessing\n\nDoris Lessing warns of ‘inanities’ of internet\n\nDoris Lessing Reflects on World, Change\n\nDoris Lessing’s MI5 file: was she a threat to the state?\n\nSimilarities Between Virginia Woolf and Doris Lessing\n\nLay off men, Lessing tells feminists\n\nThe Doris Lessing Society\n\nPolitical Correctness (article by Lessing)\n\nInterview\n\nInterview\n\nInterview\n\nInterview\n\nInterview\n\nBibliography\n\n1950 The Grass Is Singing (novel)\n\n1951 This Was the Old Chief’s Country\n\n1952 Martha Quest (novel)\n\n1953 Five: Short Novels (stories)\n\n1954 Proper Marriage (novel)\n\n1956 Retreat to Innocence (novel)\n\n1957 Going Home (memoir)\n\n1957 The Habit of Loving (stories)\n\n1958 A Ripple from the Storm (novel)\n\n1959 Each His Own Wilderness (drama)\n\n1959 Fourteen Poems\n\n1960 In Pursuit of the English: A Documentary (non-fiction)\n\n1962 The Golden Notebook (novel)\n\n1962 Play with a Tiger (drama)\n\n1963 A Man and Two Women (stories)\n\n1964 African Stories (stories)\n\n1965 Landlocked (novel)\n\n1966 The Black Madonna (stories)\n\n1966 Winter in July (stories)\n\n1966 Play with a Tiger (drama)\n\n1967 Particularly Cats (cat tales)\n\n1968 Nine African Stories\n\n1969 The Four-Gated City (novel)\n\n1971 Briefing for a Descent into Hell (novel)\n\n1972 The Story of a Non-Marrying Man and Other Stories (US: The Temptation of Jack Orkney and Other Stories) (stories)\n\n1973 The Summer Before the Dark (novel)\n\n1973 This Was the Old Chief’s Country: Collected African Stories, Volume 1 (stories)\n\n1973 The Sun Between Their Feet: Collected African Stories (stories)\n\n1974 The Memoirs of a Survivor (novel)\n\n1974 A Small Personal Voice (collected essays)\n\n1978 To Room Nineteen: Collected Stories, Volume One (US: Stories (combined with Volume Two)) (stories)\n\n1978 The Temptation of Jack Orkney: Collected Stories Volume Two (US: Stories (combined with Volume One)) (stories)\n\n1979 Re: Colonised Planet 5, Shikasta (novel)\n\n1980 The Marriages between Zones Three, Four, and Five\n\n1981 The Sirian Experiments (novel)\n\n1982 The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 (novel)\n\n1983 Documents Relating to the Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire\n\n1983 The Diary of a Good Neighbor (published under the pseudonym Jane Somers) (novel)\n\n1984 If the Old Could (published under the pseudonym Jane Somers) (novel)\n\n1985 The Good Terrorist (novel)\n\n1986 Prisons We Choose to Live Inside (essays)\n\n1987 The Wind Blows Away Our Words (non-fiction)\n\n1988 The Fifth Child (novel)\n\n1989 Particularly Cats and More Cats (cat tales)\n\n1989 The Doris Lessing Reader\n\n1990 Through The Tunnel (stories)\n\n1991 Particularly Cats… and Rufus (cat tales)\n\n1992 London Observed: Stories and Sketches (stories)\n\n1992 The Real Thing: Stories and Sketches (stories)\n\n1992 African Laughter (memoir)\n\n1994 Shadows on the Wall of the Cave (transcript of a talk)\n\n1994 Conversations (interviews)\n\n1994 A Small Personal Voice (essays)\n\n1994 Under My Skin: Volume One of My Autobiography, to 1949\n\n1995 Playing the Game (graphic novel)\n\n1995 Spies I Have Known and Other Stories (stories)\n\n1996 Love, Again (novel)\n\n1996 The Pit (stories)\n\n1996 Play with a Tiger and Other Plays (drama)\n\n1996 Putting the Questions Differently (interviews)\n\n1997 Walking in the Shade, Volume Two of My Autobiography, 1949 to 1962\n\n1999 Mara and Dann, an Adventure (novel)\n\n2000 Ben, in the World (novel)\n\n2000 The Old Age of El Magnificato (cat tales)\n\n2001 The Sweetest Dream (novel)\n\n2002 On Cats (cat tales)\n\n2003 The Grandmothers (stories)\n\n2005 Time Bites (essays)\n\n2005 The Story of General Dann and Mara’s Daughter, Griot and the Snow Dog (novel)\n\n2006 The Cleft (novel)\n\n2008 Alfred and Emily (novel)\n\n2008 On Not Winning the Nobel Prize (Nobel Prize lecture)\n\nDetailed bibliography"
