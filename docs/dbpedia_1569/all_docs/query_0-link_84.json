Anybody feels that there are any simulator that is important that is missing from this list? Or what is your experience with these?\n\nThese simulators have been found to support aerial flight:\n\nAIRsim (GitHub - microsoft/AirSim: Open source simulator for autonomous vehicles built on Unreal Engine / Unity, from Microsoft AI & Research):\n\nFlightgear (https://www.flightgear.org/)\n\nGazebo (https://gazebosim.org/):\n\nIsaac Sim (https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim):\n\nPybullet (Bullet Real-Time Physics Simulation | Home of Bullet and PyBullet: physics simulation for games, visual effects, robotics and reinforcement learning.):\n\nRealFlight (https://www.realflight.com/):\n\nWebots (https://www.cyberbotics.com/):\n\nXPlane (https://www.flightgear.org/)\n\nThese are some aerial robotics for simulation (with ROS support I think):\n\nRotorS (GitHub - ethz-asl/rotors_simulator: RotorS is a UAV gazebo simulator):\n\nFlightmare (GitHub - uzh-rpg/flightmare: An Open Flexible Quadrotor Simulator):\n\nGym-pybullet-drones (GitHub - utiasDSL/gym-pybullet-drones: PyBullet Gym environments for single and multi-agent reinforcement learning of quadcopter control):\n\nPegasus Simulator (https://pegasussimulator.github.io/):\n\nAlso, there are also some aerial dynamic models that people can use as plugins for these simulators, but arguably there are most likely a lot more out there so this.\n\nJSBSim (GitHub - JSBSim-Team/jsbsim: An open source flight dynamics & control software library)\n\nYASim (https://wiki.flightgear.org/YASim) ’\n\nHope to know more about your experience with these so we can use that as fuel for our next meeting\n\nThat abbrivation stands for Digital Combat Simulator right?\n\nI guess technically it is? I’m hesitant to put it on the list from my pacifists views but for completeness it should probably be on the list. Does anybody use this for drone development?\n\nOne thing that came out of the discussion was that we also need to think about making a clear definition of what is called a simulator and what is not… or subelements of it. think of other names for it as the word ‘simulation’ is extremely broad and confuses a lot of people too."
