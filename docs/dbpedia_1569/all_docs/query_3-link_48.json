        "text": "Overview\n\nSimulating an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) allows for early verification and validation of its performance and behavior. By utilizing physics-based plant models, simulated sensors, and 3D virtual environments, simulation aids in visualizing the system's response during the design and testing of autonomy algorithms, as well as the tuning of control parameters.\n\nTo minimize risk before actual UAV flight, it is crucial to test the UAV controller and autonomy algorithms in a controlled lab environment. In this webinar, we will demonstrate how to simulate a commercially available drone equipped with a PX4 autopilot and utilize the model for testing and tuning the control algorithms.\n\nAutonomous algorithms like obstacle avoidance demand significant computational resources and necessitate an onboard computer on the drone, in addition to the autopilot. We will showcase how to test these algorithms by simulating them with a UAV autopilot and onboard computer in a hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) workflow. Furthermore, we will highlight the integration with the PX4 architecture, the process of identifying an accurate plant model, deploying a tuned controller, and conducting real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulations using Speedgoat.\n\nHighlights\n\nYou will learn about:\n\nParameter identification for plant and attitude controller using flight logs\n\nDesigning and tuning a controller through simulations\n\nDeployment of controller with a 3-axis gimbal for lab-controlled testing\n\nDeployment of an obstacle avoidance algorithm on NVIDIA Jetson, utilizing vision data from Unreal for path correction to PX4\n\nSimulating sensor failure during a UAV mission\n\nReal-time simulation with plant model deployed on Speedgoat\n\nAbout the Presenters\n\nRonal George\n\nRonal George is a senior application engineer for robotics and autonomous systems at MathWorks.
