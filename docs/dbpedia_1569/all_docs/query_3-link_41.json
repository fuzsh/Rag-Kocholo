        "text": "KU UAS research aims to develop guidance, navigation, and control systems that can function in GPS denied environments and utilize collision avoidance technology. KU UAS research focuses on increasing reliability, adaptability, and scalability of UAS systems.\n\nUAS missions often require unique sensing capabilities to assess features of interest to ensure safe operation. One goal of KU UAS research is to develop cooperative sensing and perception of the environment to support operations in challenging environments. Radars developed can be used in applications ranging from understanding the ice-bed depth to insight into aspects of agricultural conditions affecting plant growth."
