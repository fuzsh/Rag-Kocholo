        "text": "Kimon P. Valavanis\n\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) research and development has matured to the point that such systems are now used for a wide range of civilian and public domain applications. However, safety, reliability, robustness and resilience challenges are still integral components of any flight control system (FCS) and navigation controller.\n\nThis seminar focuses on detailed designs and implementations of navigation controllers for unmanned rotorcraft operating under nominal and failure/fault conditions, as well as a controller design for a new type of unmanned fixed-wing circulation-control aircraft, endowed with enhanced aerodynamic efficiency. Obtained mathematical models are the result of exhaustive simulations, flights in a realistic simulation environment, and actual flight tests. Theoretical developments are verified and validated through implementation and testing on real unmanned aircraft.\n\nBiography:\n\nDr. Kimon P. Valavanis received the Diploma in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (DiplômeIngénieur, 5 years of study) from the National Technical University of Athens (http://www.ntua.gr), Greece, in 1981, and he completed the Professional Engineer (PE) exams in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering in February, 1982. He has been a member of the Technical Chamber of Greece since 1982. He received the M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering and the PhD degree in Computer and Systems Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) (http://www.rensselaer.edu) in 1984 and 1986, respectively.\n\nDr. Valavanis held the Analog Devices Career Development Chair for Assistant Professors, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Northeastern University (http://www.northeastern.edu) from 1987 to 1990, where he also was Director of the Robotics Laboratory. From 1991 to 1999 he was with The Center for Advanced Computer Studies (CACS), University of Louisiana at Lafayette (http://www.cacs.louisiana.edu), where he served as Associate Professor (1991-1995) and,since 1995, as Professor of Computer Engineering. He also was Associate Director for Research at the A-CIM Center (1993-1999) and Director of the Robotics and Automation Laboratory. During 1993-1999, he also held the A-CIM/[TC]2/Regents Professorship in Manufacturing.\n\nFrom 1999-2003, Dr. Valavanis was Professor in the Department of Production Engineering and Management (DPEM), Technical University of Crete (TUC) (http://www.tuc.gr), Greece, where he also established and served as Founding Director of the Intelligent Systems and Robotics Laboratory (ISRL). He served as Director of the DPEM Graduate/PhD Program and as Chair of the TUC Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) and Technical Council; one of his major responsibilities was coordinating and approving new campus building development.\n\nDr. Valavanis joined the University of Denver (DU) on September 1, 2008, as Professor and Chair of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, and in June of 2013 he was named John Evans Professor, which is the highest award at DU. He also served as Interim/Acting Chair of the Computer ScienceDepartment for two years (7/2009 to 6/2011). He was the Founding Director of the DU Unmanned Systems Laboratory (DU2SL), which he established in early 2009. In November of 2012, he officially created the DU Unmanned Systems Research Institute (DU2SRI), in which he serves as Founding Director. One of the objectives of the Institute is to build the next generation of safe and reliable autonomous / semi-autonomous unmanned systems and aircraft that will be integrated into the national airspace system. Activities within the Institute have already resulted in ‘transformative research’ and patented technology that has been licensed to companies. More specifically, a patented sense-detect-and-avoid (SDAA) system for UAVs has been licensed to Integrated Robotics and Imaging Systems for testing. Recent patented technology relates to: landing platform prototype ground mobile vehicles on which helicopters and quadrotors can land and recharge; real-time pose estimation for autonomous landing of rotary wing UAVs; and, developing circulation control based (unmanned) aircraft.\n\nSince the middle 1990’s, Dr. Valavanis has been Guest Professor in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Department of Telecommunications, University of Zagreb (http://www.fer.hr), Croatia. He also was invited through the European Union PhD Research Program in Italy to teachRobotics and Unmanned Systems at the Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica, Gestionale e dell’ Automazione, Universitά Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy (2004). Furthermore, he was invited through the PhD – Excellence program in Italy to teach an accelerated course in UAV navigation and control at the Politecnico di Torino, Dipartimento di Ingegneria Meccanica e Aerospaziale (September, 2016). He offered the same course at the South China University of Technology in November, 2016. In addition, he collaborates regularly with colleagues at TUC, NTUA, University of Patras, University of Zagreb, Politecnico di Torino, Universitά Politecnica delle Marche, Georgia Tech, University of Notre Dame, and he is a member of the Advisory Board of European Union (EU) funded projects.\n\nDr. Valavanis’ research interests focus on the areas of Unmanned Systems, Distributed Intelligence Systems, Robotics and Automation. He has published close to 400 book chapters, technical journal/transaction, referred conference papers, invited papers and technical reports. He has authored, co-authored and/or edited the following books: Intelligent Robotic Systems: Theory, Design and Applications (with Dr. G. N. Saridis), Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1992; Control Problems in Robotics and Automation (co-editors with B. Siciliano), Lecture Notes in Control and Information Sciences, Vol. 230, Springer-Verlag, 1998; Intelligent Manufacturing Systems: Programming and Control (with J. Balic, N. Tsourveloudis and S. Ioannidis), University of Maribor Publications, 2003; Advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: State of the Art and the Road to Autonomy (editor and co-author of nine Chapters), Springer, 2007; Unmanned Aircraft Systems – International Symposium on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, UAV’08, (co-editors with P.

Vachtsevanos), Springer, 2015, which is the only handbook published worldwide – a five-Volume Handbook that includes all aspects of UAVs, also translated into Chinese – a 2nd Edition is now in progress, to be published by Springer in 2017;Unmanned Aircraft Systems: Research and Development on Theory and Applications, (editor, K. P. Valavanis), Springer (to be published in late 2017). Two more, highly specialized recent books, now in production by Springer are: Foundations of Circulation Control Based Small-Scale Unmanned Aircraft: A Comprehensive Methodology from Concept to Design and Experimental Testing (K. Kanistras, K. P. Valavanis, M. J. Rutherford), and, Modeling, Navigation and Control of a Small-Scale Flybarless Unmanned Rotorcraft (J. Alvarenga, K. P. Valavanis, M. J. Rutherford).
