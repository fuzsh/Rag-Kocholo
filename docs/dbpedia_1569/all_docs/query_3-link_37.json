        "text": "Our test and evaluation of system performance and goal demonstration features a wide array of trained unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) pilots with Department of Defense sensor expertise and thousands of hours of simulation and flight demonstration experience. Our software development, vehicle interface expertise, and demonstration of multi-vehicle and sensor control make us a leader in this field. Furthermore, our work with the Air Force Research Laboratory Command and Control System Development is particularly noteworthy, as we were able to transform a test and evaluation capability for a single platform into a multiservice, multi-platform capability that is making its way into operational use.\n\nAutonomy/Unmanned Systems Command and Control (C2)\n\nParallax operates a robust C2 program for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). Our UAS team has well over a decade of experience in UAS systems testing in support of the Air Force Research Laboratory and has conducted thousands of hours of testing in numerous environments. This includes work on the evaluation of advanced control and display systems for semi-autonomous, remotely piloted aircraft that is critical to the development of C2 systems that enable a single operator to control multiple UAVs.\n\nOur core capabilities include:\n\nTesting\n\nControl algorithms\n\nAutonomy\n\nFlight integration testing\n\nHardware in the loop\n\nHuman-machine teaming/interfaces\n\nData Links\n\nPayloads\n\nConcept of Operations Development\n\nSurrogate or actual hardware"
