        "text": "UAS 2200 - Unmanned Aerial Systems Overview (3)\n\nThe purpose of this course is to provide the student with an overview of the Spectrum of UAS design, operations, and employment considerations. The student will study the developmental history of UAS systems. UAS operations within the National Airspace System and existing and proposed Federal Aviation Administration regulations will be extensively covered. Students will understand the basic physics of atmospheric flight.\n\nUAS 2202 - Principles of UAS Design (3)\n\nAn in-depth look at military and civilian UAS designs. The Northrop-Grumman Global Hawk, General Atomics Predator, micro-UAVs and U.S. Army small reconnaissance vehicles will be featured.\n\nUAS 2204 - Principles of UAS Sensors & Sensing Systems (3)\n\nCourse will cover the design considerations, packaging, and employment of various sensors and systems for UAS. Electro-optical, Forward Looking Infrared, low light, electronic sensing, and other remote sensors will be featured. Systems Integration Factors in Platform Selection is included.\n\nUAS 2206 - Human Factors in UAS Operations & Accidents (3)\n\nThe physical, emotional, and environmental aspects of military and civilian UAS operations will be analyzed. The impact of human error including workload, fatigue, poor situational awareness, inadequate training, lack of crew coordination and poor ergonomic design on increasing UAS accident rates will be discussed. The effects of the unique remote piloting environment on mental workload will be considered.\n\nUAS 2208 - Legal & Ethical Considerations for UAS Operations (3)\n\nDiscuss FAA guidelines and ethical issues, including international laws of war. Case studies on drone strikes, police surveillance, and other relevant topics.\n\nUAS 2210 - Real World Applications (3)\n\nUsing UAS technology in the real world, such as law enforcement, national security, public affairs, natural resources, forest fire detection, remote sensing, aerial surveillance, oil-gas exploration, transportation, conservation, and scientific research. Case studies in actual applications.\n\nUAS 2212 - UAS Piloting Familiarization (3)\n\nThis will be a laboratory split between UAS operations instruction and actual UAS piloting. The student will learn basic flight and mission planning techniques, and will be prepared to pass the FAA part 107 “Remote Pilot” certification. Students will participate in quadcopter and fixed wing drone setup, flight safety, mission programming, virtual practice, and “hands on” flight experience (fixed wing drone flight will be simulated using student input)."
