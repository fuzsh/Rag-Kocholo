        "text": "By testing and validating our autonomous systems in realistic synthetic environments, we can increase the time we spend running our software while decreasing the time we spend on the real vehicle. The Virtual Integration and Simulation Environment (VISE™) is Neya’s 3D sensors and physics simulation software that is optimized for the integration and testing of autonomous systems. Built on the Unreal Engine, VISE is fully integrated with ROS and JAUS communication paths.\n\nOften, to work with a simulation, developers will create bypasses and alter system parameterizations to work with the simulator interface. This is not the case with VISE. Instead, VISE is built to digitally replicate the behaviors of vehicles by providing accurate physics responses. In addition, by simulating the hardware specific to a vehicle, such as the B-Kit, VISE also provides the same interface the vehicles provide to outside software.\n\nVISE provides a vast array of configurable landscapes for the testing and evaluation of machine learning, mission planning and robotic systems. By leveraging these simulated environments, users can safely test new capabilities across thousands of permutated scenarios before moving to field testing. VISE contains digital recreations of real-world locations as well as configurable representative environments. Partnering with the Virtual Heroes Division of ARA, we can rapidly create new, highly detailed, and realistic virtual environments.\n\nTerrain and Feature Generations Tools (TFGT) can be leveraged to create hundreds of miles of testable landscape with complete features, such as vegetation, roads, and other environmental objects–all at runtime. VISE is configurable using the metadata contained in scenario files, allowing users to deterministically run generated environments multiple times and share their setup with the rest of the development team.\n\nOur simulation platform supports a broad range of sensors such as LiDAR, Stereo Camera, GPS, IMU and RADAR. Every sensor in VISE is fully customizable and can be configured to fit the requirements of the project or match the behavior of a real-world sensor model. Neya has developed a Dual Return LiDAR model that can accurately represent the noise of vegetation returns."
