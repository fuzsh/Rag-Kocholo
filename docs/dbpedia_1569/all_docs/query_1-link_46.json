        "text": "With 50 years of experience in aviation education, training, and research, UND was the first to offer a UAS degree in 2009. We continue to be national leaders in UAS education today. When you enroll in our unique UND program, youâ€™ll gain the expertise in unmanned aircraft to execute and manage applications in the military, firefighting, disaster relief, law enforcement, surveillance, aerial photography, transports and future uses of this rapidly evolving area. You'll gain expertise to work in a crew environment as a pilot operator, sensor operator, or other key team member of unmanned aircraft systems. You'll also gain a clear understanding of National Airspace System (NAS) safety and operations procedures.\n\nUND is one of the first universities to enter into a long term relationship with the Federal Aviation Association (FAA) and become part of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Collegiate Training Initiative (CTI-UAS) program. We are poised to deliver up-to-date UAS education that matches the requirements of the NAS. This ongoing collaboration with the FAA will further ensure you as a UND student are qualified to enter into careers involving Unmanned Aircraft Systems.\n\nOur Grand Forks campus has been called \"the Silicon Valley of unmanned aircraft systems\" by the New York Times. UND students are given the opportunity to interact with small and large UAS companies and agencies such as Northrop Grumman, General Atomics, SkySkopes, Grand Sky, and Customs Border Protection in a comprehensive UAS ecosystem In the region, you'll be given options beyond traditional internships to get real-world experience. For example, at the UND Center of Innovation, you can work alongside a legion of UAS startups to solve real-time problems. Flights are conducted regularly where UND flight students are jointly flying next to unmanned aircraft in the National Airspace System.\n\nUAS Degree\n\nUND offers a comprehensive UAS Aviation degree. It includes relative topics such as:\n\nHuman factors\n\nCrew resource management\n\nAutonomous systems\n\nCounter UAS applications\n\nExperience in small, medium and large UAS operations\n\nSafety management\n\nAircraft systems\n\nThe UAS degree offers two career tracks to specialize in:\n\nLow Altitude UAS Commercial Applications and Operations\n\nMedium/High Altitude Long Endurance UAS Commercial Applications and Operations\n\nAABI Accredited UAS Degree\n\nUND Aerospace was the first four year degree UAS Operation program to receive Aviation Accreditation Board International (AABI) Accreditation for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).\n\nStudent Achievement Data\n\nAs the as the first university accredited for UAS by AABI, UND has been at the forefront of educating the first generation of UAS pilot operators and professionals in related fields. We are also dedicated to preparing students for complex careers of the future in areas like counter UAS and Beyond Visual-Line-of-Sight (BVLOS).\n\nThe aviation industry continues to expand with the advent of UAS operations. It has also opened an unlimited number of industries who can now safely and cost effectively integrate UAS operations. These industries need aviation professionals who understand the various aspects of what it means to integrate UAS and autonomy into the National Airspace System. With large employers in various industries seeking the unique and specialized UAS skills to deploy and manage programs, graduates can expect plentiful opportunities.\n\nUND graduates with a B.S. in Unmanned Aircraft System can expect exciting opportunities in many industries, including:\n\nOil and Gas\n\nWindmill Inspection\n\nConstruction\n\nAgriculture\n\nMilitary and defense\n\nLaw enforcement\n\nFirefighting\n\nTransport\n\nSurveillance\n\nAerial photography\n\nAir and rescue\n\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems Operator Jobs\n\nOur comprehensive UAS degree gives you the strategic skills you need, including:\n\nProject Management\n\nStrategic Planning\n\nOperations Management\n\nCommercial Operations\n\nAviation Safety\n\nUnmanned Aircraft System Operations alumni have gone on to a variety of successful careers with:\n\nGeneral Atomics\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation\n\nIsight RPV\n\nNorthern Plains UAS Test Site\n\nCargill\n\nArgenTech Solutions Inc."
