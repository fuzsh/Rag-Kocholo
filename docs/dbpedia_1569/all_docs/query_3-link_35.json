        "text": "Participation\n\nMore than 400 individuals from 250 public- and private-sector organizations supported the development of the UASSC roadmap, including representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), other U.S. federal government agencies, standards developing organizations (SDOs), industry, academia, and others. Participation is open to UAS stakeholders that have operations in the U.S. Membership in ANSI is not a prerequisite and there is no fee to participate at this time.\n\nTo develop the roadmap, the UASSC established four working groups that typically held online meetings twice a month: WG1 covering airworthiness; WG2 covering general flight operations, personnel training, qualifications and certification; WG3 covering flight operations for critical infrastructure inspections, environmental applications, commercial services, and workplace safety; and WG4 covering flight operations for public safety.\n\nFor those who want to receive periodic informational updates about the UASSC, click here. By clicking this link, you consent to the ANSI PRIVACY POLICY. You also consent to allow ANSI to retain your personal information. You may receive communications from ANSI directly related to your request.\n\nSPONSORS\n\nAs a general matter, ANSI undertakes to respond to national priorities on behalf of the community of interest with the expectation that those who benefit will provide funding to support the Institute’s engagement. While there is no fee associated with participating in the UASSC, ANSI welcomes financial support with appropriate recognition from those who are able to provide it. All sponsorship revenue is directly applied to help offset the Institute’s costs of operating the UASSC.\n\nThe reason for undertaking the version 2.0 update was to expand the document’s content, engage subject matter experts not previously involved, identify potentially overlooked gaps, track progress by SDOs to address the recommendations contained in version 1.0, review priorities, and otherwise incorporate feedback. Of 78 issue areas examined, 71 open gaps were identified, meaning there is currently no published standard or specification that covers the issue in question. Each gap includes a corresponding recommendation for action, along with a priority level for producing a standard and the name of a suggested organization(s) that can address the need. Of the open gaps, 47 have been identified as high priority, 21 as medium priority, and 3 as lower priority. In 53 cases, additional R&D is needed. Two version 1.0 gaps were closed, 3 were withdrawn, and 16 new gaps were added.\n\nMany sections of the document were substantially revised or expanded, including such areas as: categories of spectrum applicable to command and control (C2) link and communications, continued operational safety, UAS detection and mitigation, and public safety tactical operations. New gap analysis sections were added related to:\n\nBlockchain for UAS\n\nRecreational Operations\n\nDesign and Operation of Aerodrome Facilities for UAS\n\nUAS Service Suppliers (USS) Process and Quality\n\nImplementing UAS for Hydrocarbon Pipeline Inspections\n\nImplementing UAS in Airport Operations\n\nCommercial Cargo Transport via UAS\n\nCommercial Passenger Air Taxi/Transport via UAS (both short- and long-haul flights)\n\nCommercial Sensing Services\n\nUse of Small UAS for News Gathering; UAS for Emergency Management and Disasters\n\nStandardization of Data Formatting for Small UAS Public Safety Operations"
