        "text": "Methods\n\nThe analysis for this study consisted of two main subsections: analysis of suitable drone placement using GIS-models and delivery test-flights on these sites with a UAV system.\n\nStockholm County\n\nThis explorative study was carried out in Stockholm County, Sweden, which covers a total area of 6,488 km2 and has a population of 2,224,156 inhabitants, producing an average density of 343 individuals/km2 [9] The county consists of both rural areas with <250 inhabitants/km2 and downtown areas in the city centre with ≥6000 inhabitants/km2 [4].\n\nThe incidence of OHCA in Stockholm County is 46/100,000 per year. Four dispatch centres receive emergency “112” calls originating in Stockholm County and dispatch 58 ambulances during daytime and 38 at night. The EMS operates a two-tier system providing ALS treatment and is staffed with mainly registered nurses with university paramedic training. Dual dispatch parallel to EMS dispatch is carried out by police and fire departments [10].\n\nIn OHCA cases in Stockholm County presenting with a shockable rhythm, the median response time from collapse to defibrillation was 11 min, and survival to 30 days was 31 % for EMS cases versus a 70 % survival rate if a public AED was used prior to EMS arrival [10].\n\nAnalysis of optimal drone placement using GIS-models\n\nA spatial analysis of optimal drone placement was performed using geographic information system (GIS) tool ArcMap, and ArcGIS 10 [11] was used to analyse and visualize the results. Each area on a raster layer covering a map of Stockholm County was given a value based on EMS delay and incidence of OHCA.\n\nThis raster with interpolated values was produced from EMS delay times and was weighed against a raster created from the density of previous validated non-crew witnessed OHCA cases with a presumed cardiac etiology reported to SRCR in Stockholm County.\n\nA Point Density (PD) tool counted the number of OHCA within several distinct areas providing a raster layer giving values representing the density. Inverse distance weight interpolation (IWD) is an additional tool that creates a raster from a point layer; it was used on the OHCA layer with EMS delay as input, Fig. .\n\nMulti-criteria evaluation (MCE) is a spatial tool that was used to evaluate the most suitable placement of UAVs by integrating these different layers and ranking the importance of each layer. Every layer is multiplied by a weight which adds up to 1. Calculations of suitable drone placement were based upon two alternative scenarios.\n\nUrban locations–50/50 weighting, Fig.\n\nIn order to find suitable placement for the drones, this MCE model favoured EMS delay and OHCA incidence equally and gave these factors 0.5 weight points each.\n\nRural locations–80/20 weighting, Fig.\n\nIn order to find suitable placement for the drones, this MCE model gave 0.8 weight points to EMS delay and 0.2 weight points to OHCA incidence, favouring a more extensive EMS delay in addition to a presumed low OHCA incidence.\n\nEach circle on the map was given a 10 km radius from the suitable location, equalling an 8.5 min UAV flight time (70 km/h).\n\nTest flights\n\nIn Sweden the use of drones by civilians is restricted; they can not be operated beyond a pilot’s range of sight [12]. Test flights within the pilot’s range of sight were therefore carried out in the rural areas calculated with data based on historical OHCA in the archipelago surrounding Stockholm County. Two different eight-rotor class 2 UAVs from HEIGHT TECH GmbH & Co. KG company (DE) were used. These were operated by two licensed UAV-pilots and flown in manual flight-command mode. The UAV had a maximum velocity capacity of 70 km/h, with a maximal range of 10 km. The drone was modified with two latches holding the AED in place which could be opened remotely by the pilot. The AED was also prepared with a small parachute which unfolded after the opening of the latch-release.\n\nFor delivery of the AED, three different techniques were tested: (1) dropping the AED from the UAV using a parachute technique from high altitude, minimum 25 m, (2) dropping the AED from the UAV at an altitude of 3–4 m with a remote release system that included two latches holding the AED in place, Fig. , and (3) landing the UAV onsite.\n\nVisual data on performance of the UAV was gathered in a structured protocol alongside meteorological data by the pilots and researchers. Basic performance of flying, hovering, delivery and landing on-site with an AED attached to the UAV was evaluated by the pilots and researchers after each flight. The AED was attached to a CPR-manikin post-delivery. Visual inspection was used to evaluate the AED alongside tests of functionality in terms of attaching and starting the AED.\n\nAED system\n\nThe AED, (Schiller AG - FRED easyport®) weight 490 g with additional supplement case had a total weight of 1 kg and was attached under the UAV.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis both theoretical and practical study explores a novel method for delivering an AED to the scene of an OHCA by using a drone. We calculated suitable locations for UAVs equipped with an AED in a major metropolitan area such as Stockholm county and in areas with substantial EMS delay. The use of an UAV in rural areas to deliver AED in OHCA may be safe and feasible. By using a GIS model [11] suitable placement of UAV systems can be designed and the use of an AED equipped UAV may potentially reduce time to defibrillation in OHCA.\n\nSuitable placement of UAV and potential reduction in response time\n\nWith the use of data on EMS delay in response times as well as GPS-coordinates from retrospective OHCA cases, remote geographical areas can now be visualized. In remote areas with prolonged EMS response time (>20 min), the UAV might have real advantages in comparison to EMS in that a UAV may deliver an AED several minutes prior to EMS arrival. In contrast to our findings Pulver et al. estimated that a coverage of 80 % was met within one minute by placing drones at EMS-stations in an urban setting [13]. We believe this is optimistic and that the most significant time benefit will most certainly be found in rural areas, although the incidence of OHCA is less frequent than in urban areas. It is however important to take into account that a decrease in response time from ten minutes to seven minutes is less effective than one that goes from six minutes to three [4].\n\nThe difference in response time for EMS between urban and rural areas is substantial, as is the possible amount of time saved using this UAV-system. Changes in demographics over the year point out the need for a complement to EMS in rural areas. The suggested rural areas in this paper are largely inhabited in the summer time by people on vacation. Fire stations and sea-rescue stations in rural areas are reasonable alternatives for hosting such a system.\n\nFor implementation to be feasible, UAVs need to be implemented into the context of current jurisdiction, technological possibilities and existing search-and-rescue (SAR) infrastructure. Although time from call to dispatch has been set to zero for the UAV system, thus excluding time to recognition of the OHCA and dispatch, preliminary testing has shown that technical activation of the UAV (launch into the air) from the dispatch centre could be feasible within 10 s as compared to land-based EMS which can take up to 90 s in priority 1 cases. Helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) which usually take up to 5 min before they are airborne. We believe that safety features, navigational planning and delay in seeking authorization from aviation authorities will be the main obstacles for this kind of system to be effective.\n\nTransportation of the AED\n\nPrevious testing of using UAV to transport medical products such as laboratory specimens has shown it is possible that the accuracy of samples can be completely unaffected by a test flight [14].\n\nA change in legislation, implementation of a transponder, collision warning systems’ sound and lights, a delivery system, as well as a stable radio-link are all needed if a UAV is to be flown by automated means and out of a pilot’s visual range. Optimally UAVs should be deployed automatically with dual dispatch alongside EMS, and navigated via map-support. In commercial areas or in rescue scenarios, future autonomous flights can alleviate task interference and reduce the workload in the host/operating system [8]. An alternative to automated flights is to have a designated pilot requesting flight permission for an UAV that can be flown manually with a video-link.\n\nDelivery of the AED\n\nDuring delivery of the AED onsite, we generally believe there is a risk the AED may be damaged when dropped to the ground or into an aquatic environment. Precautions needs to be taken in order to avoid causing harm to bystanders or the environment. The latch-release technique from 3–4 m height presents low risk of people being hurt from the rotors of the UAV. Adequate packaging of the AED may be needed, Fig. . Landing onsite is a preferable alternative for delivery. Optimally on flat ground using appropriate collision warning sensors as well as lights and sounds to attract attention. Bystanders onsite should be informed of incoming UAVs by the dispatch centre and instructed on how to locally enact appropriate safety measures. The dispatcher should not risk interrupting CPR; rather it should wait and inform the bystander once an AED is available in the vicinity. One could also consider deploying a drone in cases with two bystanders. Propellers should be shut off after landing, and AEDs should be placed on top of the drone, a more intuitive location for easy bystander access. Notwithstanding, modes of delivery need to be further evaluated in order to find a safe procedure for both AED and bystanders.\n\nImplementation\n\nA majority of all OHCA cases with a presumed cardiac etiology present with ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the first minutes and early defibrillation is the key intervention. Non-cardiac cases may as well present with a shockable rhythm. [4, 10]\n\nThe rural cases can theoretically be reached by a UAV within 8.5 min from dispatch. Data from the SRCR suggest that 30-day survival rates in these cases can reach 30–41 % if defibrillation is carried out between 7–10 min, as compared to 0–8 % with an EMS delay of more than 21 min [2]. We believe that although the AED is not immediately present, the drone system can compensate for the EMS or HEMS delay.\n\nThe general public seems to have a neutral opinion regarding the risk involved with using UAVs; the risk is viewed as comparable to those of using existing manned aerial vehicles [15].\n\nImplementing a new system such as this in addition to dual or even triple-dispatch in OHCA probably introduces new problems in the time-critical interaction between dispatcher, EMS and bystanders. Yet another technical device needs to fit into the chain of survival. We know nothing of how productive or even counterproductive this system might be in clinical reality. Current legislation today, however, restricts UAV flights for the purpose of delivering an AED that occur out of the range of pilots’ sight. Technical innovations and further studies on automated UAV-alert is needed to accurately deploy such a device with ensured safety and without delay.\n\nPresuming that legal and technical requirements are met, we nevertheless believe that an autonomous dispatched UAV may have great potential in reducing time to first defibrillation."
