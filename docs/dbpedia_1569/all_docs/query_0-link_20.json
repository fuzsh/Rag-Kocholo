Students will utilize high resolution camaras, thermal imaging sensors, LiDAR, and other sensors for collecting various types of data and then learning to process and analyze that data.\n\nWith the Architectural Modeling Emphasis, in addition to the UAS courses, students will take multiple modeling courses using Autodesk Revit software. Construction methods and materials and print reading courses will also be included in the program for students to have a good knowledge of construction and ability to read prints.\n\nGraduates will have a broad range of knowledge of the construction industry which will allow them to pursue a career working for contractors. architectural firms, engineering firms, or drone companies who will utilize their knowledge and skills of Architectural Modeling combined with UAS for visual verification, historical documentation, improved construction transparencies and much more!\n\nWhile students are fully employable upon completion of this program, some may wish to return for an additional year and earn a second major in Construction Management Technology.\n\nGreen and/or sustainable construction ls covered at an awareness level in the methods and materials classes and the various modeling classes.\n\nAdmission Requirements\n\nThe applicants must be high school graduates or equivalent. Students considered for acceptance must complete all admission requirements.\n\nPlease Note: Students are placed into English, math and reading courses based on ACT, ACCUPLACER or other nationally recognized tests. Please see www.NDSCS.edu/current-students/student-success/test-center for the NOSCS Course Placement Policy and testing information. Students may be on an extended plan of study pending their course placement.\n\nProgram Admission Requirements are subject to revision. P/ease check the department or program website under Program Admission Requirements for current Information.\n\nAward\n\nUpon successful completion of the required courses, students will be awarded an Associate in Applied Science degree in Unmanned Aircraft Systems."
