        "text": "The UAV Simulator is designed for operator and pilot, mission commanders, and image interpreters training across a range of mission profiles. It is designed to simulate a generic aerodynamic model integrated with sensors and camera simulations to provide mission specific or operational training. It can be customized for your UAV model and visually adapted to any terrain or environment worldwide. It can operate either in standalone mode, or networked with other training systems for team-based training. The system is designed for portability and transportability for deployment worldwide or setup in classroom environment."
