        "text": "With the real-world experience and degree you obtain in our program, you’ll be prepared for a career as an UAS pilot, either working for a company or for yourself. You’ll be prepared for jobs such as a UAS inspection pilot, UAS cinema pilot, Mapping and Geospatial Information pilot, or Unmanned Systems specialist in the mining, forestry, environmental sciences, or fishing industries, among many others. You’ll have the knowledge, licenses and (optional) certificates to either work for a wide range of cutting-edge companies, or transfer to a four-year institution to pursue a bachelor's degree in a field like Geographic Information Systems, Aviation, or UAS systems.\n\nWhile earning your UAS degree, you also have the option of completing a 12 credit series of electives that include aviation sciences, manufacturing, computer science, CAD software design, and other exciting and practical courses related to Unmanned Technology. When you graduate from the UAS Program at Lane, you will have the knowledge and hands-on experience needed to excel in the industry."
