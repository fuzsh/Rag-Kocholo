        "text": "The goal of the EPA UAS program is to create a framework through which EPA regional offices, EPA headquarters offices and grant recipients can take advantage of UAS technology to protect human health and the environment. UAS offer data collection advantages by:\n\nIncreasing safety\n\nAffording operators safe monitoring distances\n\nAffording operators an opportunity to identify the location of hazards before entering into a hazardous zone\n\nAccessing difficult or dangerous to access locations with minimal risk\n\nReducing costs\n\nProviding cost-effective data\n\nDeploying fewer personnel\n\nIncreasing efficiency\n\nCan be quickly deployed (hours not days)\n\nMonitoring multiple locations simultaneously with fewer personnel\n\nDeploying additional technologies for data collection and research, such as:\n\nHigh Resolution Imagery: optical photo/video, infrared/thermal, and multispectral\n\nGeophysics and remote sensing: LiDAR, magnetometry, and ground-penertrating radar\n\nGas Sensors : H2S, SO2, NO, NO2, HCHO, VOCs, CO, Cl, HCl, HCN, NH3, CH3, dioxins, particulates, and more\n\nERT VIPER integration, for real-time data collection and transmission\n\nWhere We Work\n\nEPA works across the United States to fulfill its mission of protecting human health and the environment. View general information on what EPA is doing in your state.\n\nEPA may use UAS for work, such as:\n\nReconnaissance, response & mapping\n\nAbility to operate in hazardous situations\n\nStructural integrity assessment\n\nInvestigating releases and chemical, biological, radiological events\n\nLogistics and planning support\n\nSite mapping (aerials for pre, post, or ongoing site documentation, volume/3D)\n\nTerrain modeling (erosion, deforestation, forest mapping, riverbanks)\n\nEPA's UAS Community of Practice\n\nEPA has an EPA UAS Community of Practice made up of staff from across the Agency\n\nThe purpose of the EPA UAS Community of Practice is to:\n\nShare UAS news, requirements, experiences and technical information\n\nStandardize UAS use practices across EPA\n\nBuild a technical and practical knowledge base\n\nMore Information\n\nAna Greene, Deputy Geospatial Information Officer\n\nOffice of Information Management\n\nEPA_UAS@epa.gov"
