        "text": "UAVs refer to controlled aerial vehicles, which perform several missions without human assistance. They can be remotely operated through different electronic gadgets such as microprocessors and sensors [6]. UAVs can perform operations autonomously in such areas where human intervention is dangerous [7]. Figure 3 presents a general architecture of UAVs where they utilize communication links to establish connectivity with satellite or ground control system (GCS) such as a laptop or smart phone. A human operator is needed to operate and control the UAV remotely. In literature, several works have been presented to address different features of UAVs. For instance, Zhang et al. [8] have focused on mobile charging features for drones to enhance their battery life. Aldhaher et al. [9] the use of a wirelessly powered receiver in order to decrease the weight of UAVs. Several wireless charging techniques have been suggested in [10] to increase the UAV’s flight time. Raciti et al. [11] reported a charging system empowered by a wireless power transfer (WPT) system. This study also highlights misalignment losses and associated mitigation solutions. Rohan et al. [12], proposed an intelligent drone charging system empowered by WPT. Shin et al. [13] addressed charge scheduling for multi-drones networks based on deep learning algorithms. In Table 1, we have summarized different surveys and reviews reporting on multiple aspects of UAVs.\n\n2.1 Classification of UAVs\n\nUAVs come in a variety of specs, equipment, sizes, ranges, and forms. Different types of UAVs can be found in the literature: fixed-wing, single rotor, fixed-wing hybrid, and multirotor [31]. Fixed-wing UAVs contain a main body, wings, propeller and motor. These UAVs need special training to control and they remain useless for aerial surveillance. A fixed-wing UAV is depicted in Fig. 4a [32]. These unmanned aerial vehicles are often used for aerial mapping and power line inspection. Such UAVs are not capable of hovering or forward flight. Figure 4b depicts a hybrid fixed-wing UAV [33]. Figure 4c depicts a single-rotor UAV [34]. However, single-rotor UAVs are costly to produce and need skill training. These unmanned aerial vehicles are mechanically difficult and susceptible to obstacles such as vibrations. Furthermore, multirotor UAVs are the most affordable and simple to build. These unmanned aerial vehicles are often employed for image and video surveillance. Quadcopters are the most often utilized UAVs, as seen in Fig. 4d. Quadcopters have gained popularity for their vertical landing, or quick maneuverability, low cost, and compact size. We have illustrated basic UAV types in Table 2. While Table 3 provides a comparison of different UAVs considering various characteristics.\n\n2.2 UAV swarms\n\nFigure 5 depicts the classification of UAV swarms as partly and completely autonomous. This categorization is also divided into single and multi-layered swarms. Each drone in the swarm provides real-time data recording and processing capabilities. While core processing takes place in the base station (BS) or in the clouds. UAV swarms with sophisticated monitoring mechanisms can cover a zone reliably and quickly by deploying several parallel-operating drones. Numerous studies have been reported on the usefulness of UAV swarms. Such as [35] analyzes swarms of drones to solve the charging process of many drones at the same time. It employs UAV swarms for smart power management. When considering the mission accomplishment of swarms of UAVs such as quadcopters, UAV flight coordination and hovering endurance become critical. Furthermore, the communication efficiency of the quadcopter swarm is critical for a successful operation. The authors devised a multi-robot coordination strategy in [36] to address the challenges of real-time synchronization of UAV swarms across a broad area network. Other investigations have looked at swarms of UAVs in the context of surveillance. [37], for example, describes quadcopter swarms for object location and tracking operations. Similarly, Leonard et al. [38] suggested tracking and detection algorithms for a quadcopter swarm-based monitoring program.\n\n2.3 Developments in Navigation of UAVs\n\nNavigation has a strong impact on UAV flight control. Several navigation technologies, such as Droppler, integrated, geometric, satellite and inertial navigation, perform multiple functions. The key navigation systems for UAVs are high-altitude, long-endurance navigation systems and tactical or medium range navigation systems. We can evaluate the development in navigation as follows:\n\nHigh-performance navigation with data fusion: it plays a key role to determine the flight status to guarantee the normal UAV flight.\n\nNew inertial navigation system: it simplifies the volume and weight and takes less energy to refine the flight pliability.\n\nIntelligent navigation system ability: information technology is used to enhance the UAV technology, along with updating the navigation system.\n\n2.4 Formation control design\n\nMotion control employee’s communication architecture needed for flow of information. Formation control strategies are as follows:\n\nLeader–follower strategy: the main advantages of this technology are that it can be accomplished easily and simply. Owing to the leader dependency, it confronts single-point failures. The limitations of this strategy could be addressed by assigning virtual and multi-leaders.\n\nBehavior-based strategy: the key benefit of this strategy is that it is greatly adaptable to even some unknown environments. However, it requires to be modeled mathematically which creates problems in analyzing stability of the system.\n\nVirtual structure strategy: this strategy considers rigid structures for intended geometry or shape of the set of UAVs. The method fails to detect the faulty information in a UAV. The method also calls for a strong capability for computation.\n\n2.5 UAV characteristics\n\n2.5.1 Speed and flight time\n\nSmall-sized UAVs mostly fly at a speed of 15 m/s or below. On the other hand, large-sized UAVs can travel at higher speeds up to 100 m/s. Whenever any UAV is following any intended path to improve its energy or spectral efficiency, its speed should be taken into account at multiple turning points and locations along this path. In [38], authors have addressed this trade-off between UAV speed and turning agility.\n\nSimilarly, flight time indicates to the maximum time for which the UAV can fly until the batteries are drained out. It is of paramount significance along with cost. UAV weight, size and atmospheric conditions such as rain or wind have strong impact on battery endurance of UAVs which is closely associated to flight time. GPS and autopilot systems also play a crucial role in flight time. Small size UAVs can fly up to 20–30 min, while large size UAVs can fly up to several hours.\n\n2.5.2 Payload\n\nThe lifting capability of a UAV to carry any weight is referred to as payload. Lifting capacity ranges from a few grams to several hundred kilos. Greater payloads allow for more accessories to be carried at the expense of shorter flying times, greater power capacity, and wider dimensions. Sensors and video cameras are common payloads for reconnaissance, surveillance, and commercial purposes. Cellular user equipment (UEs), such as tablets, mobile phones, and tablets weighing less than one kilogram, may also be carried by UAVs [39]. UAVs with high payloads are thought to have shorter flight duration. However, if a UAV has a larger surface area along with occupying more motors; it has the ability to store more power, which increases flying time. As a result, the payload's quality might let it move faster while maintaining the same precision and resolution. In Table 4, we have illustrated payload capability of different UAVs.\n\n2.5.3 Sensing equipment\n\nRadiation detection has already been discussed in ground penetrating radar, and hyper-spectral cameras to Synthetic-Aperture Radar. The author identifies highly sensitive light sensors in the field of precision agriculture:\n\nFluorescence excitation\n\nInfrared spectrum imaging, and\n\nVisible spectrum imaging\n\nThe particular sensing arrays are highly precise but the specialized equipment is highly expensive with limited versatility. Table 5 presents an overview of some sensing devices in UAVs. While Table 6 provides comparison of different imaging and ranging sensors considering various parameters.\n\n2.5.4 Software\n\nUAVs are significantly capable of playing roles in data processing tasks and problem solving. Several algorithms are used for optimization, autonomy and path planning. These tools can minimize human assistance and the infrastructure required for various tasks, such as communication. It is challenging to figure out suitable off-the-shelf software, which requires time and resources. However, researchers are on the way to developing novel methods and algorithms to address a variety of such problems. A geometric correction algorithm can be employed to decrease image distortion. Image processing algorithms are used for remote sensing or to process images captured from UAV cameras. Similarly, an offline path planning tool can be employed for UAV- swarm aided persistent surveillance methods and a self-adapting multi-featured evolution approach offering trajectory planning for UAVs.\n\nThe software installed in UAVs has been validated as an essential factor in value creation. This concept has paralleled the expansion of industries and companies devoted to software development. Among these companies are Skyworks Aerial System (USA), SkyWards (USA), RedBird (France), PIX4D (Switzerland), MapBox (USA), DroneDeploy (USA), Dedrone (Germany), and Airware (USA). Most of these countries are from European countries and USA, outlining the emerging industry of this transformative technology. Some of these companies focus on processing and analysis through captured images through UAVs, using their results to various industries such as construction, surveying, agriculture and mining, etc. While others operate as flying simulators (Redbird) and developers of UAV detection (Dedrone).\n\n2.5.5 Range and altitude\n\nThe range of a UAV relates to the area it can be operated remotely from. Small drones have a range of a few meters, whereas bigger drones have a range of hundreds of kilometers. In contrast, altitude points to the maximum height at which a drone may fly. Aerial platforms are usually split into two groups based on their altitude.\n\nLow-altitude platforms (LAPs): LAPs are typically used to facilitate cellular connectivity since they are quick to deploy and inexpensive. LAPs also provide a line-of-sight route, which can boost communication performance greatly [49].\n\nHigh-altitude platforms (HAPs): high-altitude platforms (HAPs), including balloons, are also employed for cellular communication. When compared to LAPs, HAPs provide more coverage. The implementation of HAPs is complex, and they are mostly used to facilitate Internet connectivity. Table 7 shows the various kinds of UAVs based on their altitude. Table 8 provides a comparison of several types of UAVs. Figures 6a–d depict several UAV programs in various countries.\n\n2.5.6 Controllers of UAVs\n\nControllers are responsible for executing specific tasks for UAVs. They are defined as a series of actions that can affect UAVs and the physical world. The controllers vary according to the UAV type such as flapping wing, single rotor, multirotor and fixed-wing. These UAVs are designed for certain operations and face different aerodynamics. UAV control encompasses an extensive range of technologies and treatments. For some certain operations, the control may contain the macro- executions (such as formation control and path planning) and the micro flight control decisions of the actuators according to the provided commands. Due to the dynamic behavior of UAV configurations, the design and development of UAV control must follow an appropriate mechanism. As a result of the external disturbances, the operability of the flight control system is critical to following the stable response. The key objective of the controller is to reduce the error between the estimated and desired states, which can be altitude, velocity, or position of the UAV operating under varying atmospheric conditions. Next, we discussed the flight controller for UAVs in detail.\n\n2.5.7 Flight controllers\n\nFlight controllers are commonly known as autopilot systems, are the main elements of UAVs. They are generally designed to ensure autonomous flight control, such as mission planning, flight waypoint generation and attitude stabilization. To efficiently realize these operations, flight controllers require software or hardware assistance concurrently. The latter mostly consists of power control modules, communication entities, GPS modules, onboard sensors, inertial measurement units and onboard computers, and the former mainly contains signal processing algorithms, attitude control, path planning and task allocation.\n\nThe flight controller is based on three major components. The first one is named \"kernel control law,\" which is responsible for the asymptotic stability of the UAV’s mobility within the air. The second component is called the command generator, which is used to generate references for the kernel control. The last part is the flight schedule, which is responsible for generating a group of flight arrangements to realize the desired mission. Flight control of a UAV can be achieved by controlling the altitude in order to maintain the UAV at the desired height and controlling the orientation and velocity to follow specific trajectories. Different linear and non-linear controllers are used for UAVs. The linear controllers include H¥, LRQ, PD, and PID, and non-linear controllers include NDI, gain-scheduling, fuzzy logic control, nested saturation, sliding mode, and backstepping. The linear controllers are as follows:\n\nThe H¥ Loop-Forming technique, which integrates conventional loop forming control with robust control, provides high robustness than other techniques. However, it is not feasible for large-scale UAV control.\n\nA linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller is an optimal controller which operates in dynamic systems with quadratic costs. It is regarded robust concerning technique uncertainty with a viable stability margin to error. However, it is not feasible always as it needs the full state of the system.\n\nA proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller is the most commonly used controller in UAVs. They are very popular due to their ease of use. However, they also impose limitation in optimality and robustness.\n\nNonlinear controllers are required to tackle with coupling components and non-linearity of UAV state variables. Nonlinear controllers are as follows:\n\nRobust Control Algorithms are utilized to realize the effective behavior of the controller within an acceptable disturbance ratio. It can measure the performance changes with respect to the changing system parameters. It is feasible approach as it needs only the information about the limit in uncertainty.\n\nThe Backstepping Controller is a recursive design process which divides the controller task into various steps to ensure gradual stability in each sub-system. It can tackle external uncertainty and utilize less computational resources.\n\nThe Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) follows Lyapunov stability principles to force system state trajectory through a discontinuous control signal. It is inherently robust to any changes in parametric uncertainty, external disturbances and modeling errors. It is very feasible to analyze the second order dynamic systems. Table 9 provides a comparison of different flight controller.\n\n2.6 UAV standardizationsp\n\n2.6.1 UAVs 3GPP standardization\n\nIn this technological era, UAVs have gotten a lot of attention in the line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments [56]. The third generation partnership group (3GPP) completed numerous investigations in 2017 and produced Release-15 to recognize long-term evolution (LTE)-powered UAVs. The key objective of this research was to concentrate on UAV traffic demands, channel modeling methodologies for air-to-ground dissemination views, reuse of existing cellular networks to facilitate LTE support, UAV communication, and innovations necessary to incorporate LTE into UAVs. The 3GPP's goals also include determining which traffic categories require current cellular networks to accommodate UAVs flying more than 300 m above the ground. Table 10 highlights the following UAV communication needs: (i) synchronization and radio control; (ii) command and control; and (iii) application data [18].\n\n2.6.2 UAVs standardization outside the 3GPP\n\nAside from 3GPP standardization, numerous additional regulatory bodies have specified distinct UAV requirements to assure effective, consistent, and standardized communication.\n\nThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) established the Drones Working Group (DWG) in 2015. The primary goal of this group was to create a taxonomy for consumer drones in order to emphasize privacy and security issues. In order to do this, the DWG creates techniques, systems, specifications, testing, and evaluations for consumer drones to protect the privacy and security of the public and their properties. Similarly, the IEEE Conformity Assessment Program (ICAP) and OM/AerCom SC are collaboratively designing a conformity assessment program such that UAV approaches can show conformance with IEEE standardizations. The IEEE drone application certificate program is also introduced which is comprised of industry stakeholders, that will support regulators, system integrators, solution providers, manufacturers, users and other potential beneficiaries. It also includes the academic community and test laborite to demonstrate to buyers that UAV systems or products conform to IEEE standardizations.\n\nThe European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) investigates UAV operations, use cases, and knowledge of the to-be-built Internet Protocol (IP) suite framework, as well as the spectrum rules required to accommodate UAVs in current LTE networks [57]. ETSI has also developed European standards under EC regulation requests to ensure the extensive use of services such as Data Link Services (DLS), Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control along with Airport Collaborative Decision Making procedure. Furthermore, Radio Equipment Directive has been developed to employ on UAVs operating in conformity with the spectrum management. ETSI can also be utilized to show compliance with certain aspects of the directive.\n\nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) made work item (WI) Y.UAV.arch so that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned aerial vehicle controllers (UAVs) can have a stable and functional architecture over IMT-2020 networks [58]. IMT-2020 is employed for UAV communication. As UAVs need simultaneous applications with different aspects, thus a new kind of user terminal to IMT-2020 is needed. Likewise, the novel communication network IMT-2020 is designed for ground coverage of UAVs. A group of functionalities is required to fill the gap for interoperability between IMT-202 networks and UAVs in order to improve the quality of UAV operations and implement the feature of civilian UAV operations in IMT-2020. This recommendation supports an operational architecture for UAV operators through IMT-2020 networks and functionalities defined in the physical layer, application layer, and application support layer.\n\nFederal aviation authority (FAA) is responsible for civil aircraft operations in national airspace (NAS) in the USA. It aims to provide operational and regulatory framework for unmanned traffic management (UTM). It interacts with UTM for data or information exchange. In March 2020, FAA released an updated UTM concept in order to define the technical and operational requirements for UTM ecosystem to ensure the operations of unmanned airspace systems in all existing airspaces. FAA has also set a limit of weight less than 55 pounds to include as small UAS. In general, FAA divides the existing airspace in six classes A to G. G refers to uncontrolled while class A-G is for controlled airspace. It means class G will not be monitored by air traffic control will be overseen by ATC entities. According to FAA rules, UTM operation can be performed till 400ft above ground. In case of uncontrolled airspace, the remote pilots are exempted to get approval from authorized training center (ATC) authorities. However, while entering into controlled airspace, they must inform ATC about their intent. Moreover, the UAV operator should guarantee that the foreseen UTM operations are compliant with the certain rules, e.g., e-registration of both operator and UAV and must satisfy safety requirements including communication abilities and drone airworthiness [59].\n\nEuropean Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has also implemented regulations to operate UAVs. The EASA concepts are based on a regulatory framework considering operation-centric and proportional strategy which addresses conditions and the way of the operation rather than just focusing on UAV parameters. These actions are guided and accompanied by the European Roadmap to integrate civil remotely-piloted aircraft into the European Aviation System. The document identified several levels of integration and harmonization. It also contains three annexes with a clear strategy to implement and improve regulations, foreseeable research initiatives and societal impacts on UAV services. The major difference between proposed concepts is the application of three EASA drone categories such as OPEN, SPECIFIC and CERTIFIED [59]. Thus, UAV operations performed under both SPECIFIC and CERTIFIED must be authorized by the national aviation authorization (NAA). This authorization will allow UAV operations with high risk levels such as flying over populated area. Consequently, specific system capabilities and operational requirements must be satisfied by the operator to perform these operations.\n\n2.7 UAV docking station: preliminary description\n\nDocking stations are multipurpose to facilitate safe landing, recharge, or take off, payload and data transfer. Some docking systems are capable of storing UAVs safely, protecting them from harsh environmental conditions. Docking stations can be categorized regarding [1]:\n\nMobility\n\nCharging method\n\nAutomatic battery exchange\n\nPositioning\n\nDrone storage\n\nPackage delivery\n\nLanding type\n\nLanding platform type\n\nDocking station comprises multiple subsystems, for example, power supply, a landing platform, battery recharging setup, drone storage system and many more. Docking stations should satisfy specific criteria to meet their goals. The classification of UAV docking stations is illustrated in Fig. 7. We have summarized some commercially available docking stations in Table 11. In next section, we will comprehensively discuss the UAV charging techniques.\n\nOne major issue in UAV performance is limited battery capacity. It is not suggested to increase battery weight or size as ultimately it will enhance payload which is another crucial issue. Charging can be obtained through wired or wireless power transfer (WPT) system [65] as discussed below:\n\n3.1 Wireless power tranfer (WPT)\n\nAccording to an analysis [66], the estimated revenue of WPT is around $2000 million till 2020. Figure 8 provides the estimated growth market for WPT and drones till 2025. It is envisaged that total sales with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CARG) of 13.8% by 2025 will hit $43 billion [67]. This extensive growth is due to several applications in electronic industry with multiple advantages in terms of autonomy, reliability, convenience, security and safety. All these advantages can be obtained using various WPT techniques. One key benefit of using WPT techniques is the operability in those environments where wired medium power transfer is impossible or dangerous. WPT techniques are organized as radiative electromagnetic (EM) and non-EM techniques. In non-EM, power is transferred through optical or acoustic sources. In EM techniques; resonance coupling, magnetic coupling, inductive coupling and capacitive coupling are used. At present, these WPT technologies are commercially used for several applications such as implantable medical devices, smart phones and UAVs etc.\n\nWPT techniques offer reliable and efficient power transmission for UAVs. However, WPT techniques for charging UAVs must consider critical limitations under payload, interference, harsh weather conditions and misalignment. Among these critical factors, misalignment is a dominant challenge as UAVs mostly suffer from landing accuracy issues. UAV-empowered WPT techniques must be lightweight. These techniques should ensure efficient charging and high precision landing along with tolerance to misalignment factor. Several research works have been carried out for UAV charging through different WPT techniques [69, 70]. We have summarized some of these studies addressing UAV-based WPT systems in Table 12.\n\n3.1.1 Photovoltaic (PV) cell-based UAV charging\n\nThe PV cells are used to charge batteries by using sunlight and they can significantly enhance the flight time of UAVs. In the presence of sunlight, the PV cells provide the required power to UAVs. However, in the absence of sunlight, the required power is delivered through batteries. Several research studies have been reported on solar-powered UAVs [79, 80]. According to Fazelpour et al. [79], various parameters play a major role in solar-powered energy transfer such as type of PV cell, position, orientation, geometry, temperature intensity, weather conditions and angle of incidence of sun. However, this technique is critically limited in the absence of sunlight. Atmospheric conditions such as clouds, fog, rain, temperature, humidity can substantially reduce the UAV’s efficiency and reliability. Thus, it is suggested to investigate alternative solutions to continue the UAV mission under such scenarios. Controlling PV cell position based on incident sunlight, increasing PV cell size or UAV batteries, and carrying additional power supplies are some of these strategies.\n\nCurrently, different types of PV cells are available to ensure high-efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Some studies have focused on mono-crystalline silicon PV cells as they support high flexibility and easy integration with UAV wings [81]. Research fraternity is still looking for novel designs and energy management strategies with enhanced efficiency, high availability and reliability. There is a need to focus on research activities in material perspective as low-efficiency of these PV cells is a major limit [82]. In [83], authors proposed optimization approach for solar-powered UAV trajectory in order to attain high solar radiation at low usage of mechanical energy. In [84], authors reported that solar power may be beneficial for small size aircraft. They plotted a graph as shown in Fig. 9 considering PV cell size, drone size and mass for a continuous hovering flight. To plot this graph, authors assumed 30% efficient cells, 1/3 sunlight and drones capable of sensor-autonomous hovering. Table 13 shows the PV cell size required for persistent solar-powered hovering for different UAVs.\n\nSolar-powered UAVs have gained significant attention in both academia and industrial sectors. Several research and industrial activities have been initiated on solar-powered UAVs. Figure 10 shows solar-powered drones projects by technology giants e.g., Google and Facebook. Google started using these UAVs to provide internet access in remote areas. At present, such UAVs are being used for forest fire fighting, internet coverage, high-altitude communication, border monitoring, and power-line inspection.\n\n3.1.2 Charging with laser beaming\n\nLaser power transfer (LPT) is another promising charging technique, which is commonly used in space and military missions [93]. In this charging method, laser diodes of different wavelengths are used to deliver power to PV cells integrated on UAVs. These PV cells harvest energy from laser beams to charge batteries or deliver the required power to UAVs. This charging technique is mostly used for fixed wing and rotary wing UAVs. Laser power transfer is considered a promising approach to ensure unlimited endurance. It can deliver high energy to support various energy-hungry remote operations of UAVs [94]. Several studies have been reported on LPT techniques [95, 96]. In [96], the authors introduced a controller design mechanism considering laser PV module to adjust the power conversion of LPT system. In another reported work [97], the authors discussed results pertaining to voltage, current and efficiency considering a LPT system. Furthermore, author in [98] carried out analysis of wavelength and temperature output of PV cells in a laser-based charging system. In [99], authors discussed UAV-based missions for longer durations considering different techniques. Authors discussed laser charging based on low-power laser source and precise energy consumption for UAV along with investigating its dynamics in a mission environment. In another reported study [100], authors investigated the joint problem of trajectory and power optimization in a rotary-wing UAV-empowered mobile relaying network. In order to support sustainable and convenient energy supply, they considered wireless charging of UAV through a power beacon and properly realized through a laser charging system. Apart from different advantages of LPT systems, there are several critical issues such as mobility, blockage and limited performance on long-distance flight. Moreover, this system is not feasible in airports and military areas where laser beam usage can be harmful. In Fig. 11, we present a LPT system to charge multi-UAVs.\n\nThe ongoing activities on UAV deployment have created a new breed of promising applications to carry out autonomous missions. This section highlights several prominent application areas of UAVs.\n\n4.1 Disaster management\n\nUAVs can visit disaster regions that are unsafe for manned action in the event of a man-made or environmental catastrophe, such as terrorist strikes, tsunamis, and flooding. Power, telecommunications infrastructure, water utilities, and transportation are all vulnerable to these calamities. UAVs can assist in the collection of data, the need for quick answers, and the navigation of debris. UAVs equipped with sensors, radars, and high-resolution cameras can aid rescue teams in identifying damage, launching urgent recovery efforts, and dispatching supplies including first-aid manned helicopters and medical kits. UAVs can aid with catastrophe assessment, disaster alarms, and discovering preventative measures in real-time. A swarm of drones equipped with firefighting equipment can watch, analyze, and track any region in the event of a wildfire without jeopardizing human life. As a result, UAVs may help with real-time surveillance of a vast region without jeopardizing the safety and security of anyone involved. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can help to find people and animals in danger so they can be saved.\n\n4.2 Remote sensing\n\nDrone technology is increasingly being applied by amateurs to collect high-resolution imaging data of isolated places, such as mountaintops, coastlines, and islands. The usage of UAVs serves as a link between aerial, ground-based and space-borne remotely sensed data. UAVs' cost-effectiveness and ultralight features enable spatial and temporal resolution observation. Disease diagnosis, water quality inspection, famine monitoring, gas and oil yield estimations, conservation of natural resources, geological calamity survey, topographical survey, woodland mapping, hydrological modeling, and crop management are all possible applications of UAV remotely sensed. Poor water quality because of wastewater discharge and nutrient pollution is a critical concern in some marine and coastal environments. Particularly, nutrient flow from agricultural, urban, and industrial activities can cause harmful algal blooms (HABs), ultimately producing the harmful toxins. Some research labs in Virginia and Florida, USA are focusing on the use of UAVs to early trace and detect HABs through hyperspectral sensors. However, there are several challenges which must be tackled to make this technology practical for coastal monitoring activities. Moreover, this technique is also being utilized in archaeological and cartography for crowd-sourced mapping and the generation of 3D atmospheric maps. Drones may deliver current data at low cost, allowing land planners to avoid depending on obsolete mapping sources.\n\n4.3 Search and rescue (SAR)\n\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are considered critical in areas like disaster risk management, rescue missions, and public security. UAVs may save a lot of time and resources by providing real-time imaging data of desired sites. Resulting that, the SAR group is able to detect and pinpoint precisely where aid is necessary. Drones, for example, can be used to follow lost mountaineers on any trip or to defend humans in any isolated forest or desert. Drones may therefore aid in the tracking of unlucky victims as well as any difficult terrain or harsh weather conditions. Drones can deliver critical medical equipment before an emergency or physician arrives. Drones containing food supplies and medical supplies such as vaccines, medical kits and life-saving jackets can be sent to disaster-stricken communities and isolated locations. Drones, for example, can deliver clothing, water, and other essentials to stranded people in difficult regions before rescue workers arrive. This technology can help speed up SAR efforts in disasters such as mission personnel, avalanches, forest fires, and deadly gas penetration.\n\n4.4 Infrastructure and construction inspection\n\nUAVs have made as-built maps, project monitoring, and surveys more efficient, simple, and quick. Tracking the development of the building project from start to finish ensures that the work on the site is of high quality. It may deliver reports to prospective stakeholders that include pictures, video, and 3D mapping. Infrastructure and construction inspection applications can benefit greatly from this approach. UAVs are gaining high popularity for evaluating the global system for mobile communication (GSM) towers, keeping an eye on gas pipelines, inspecting power cables, and keeping an eye on building projects [101].\n\n4.5 Precision agriculture\n\nUAVs could be installed in smart agriculture to obtain specific information through ground sensors (quality of water, soil composition, humidity, and so on), spray pesticides, diagnose illness, schedule irrigation, detect weeds, and monitor and manage crops. The applicability of UAVs in precision agriculture is a cost-effective and time-saving strategy that can improve agricultural systems' revenue, performance, and agricultural production. Furthermore, UAVs aid in insect damage, weed monitoring, chemical spraying, and farm management, resulting in higher crop yields to handle these difficulties quickly. UAVs combined with remote sensing have the potential to revolutionize smart farming. It offers temporal, geographical, and spectral resolution, as well as multi-angular observation and comprehensive vegetation height data. By undertaking sophisticated aerial mapping, UAVs can have a huge influence on the agricultural system. UAVs outfitted with the necessary cameras and sensors can analyze crop health status, including leaf area, foreign pollutants, chlorophyll content, and temperatures [102]. WH Maes et al. evaluated the advancement of remote sensing through drones in growth vigor evaluation, nutritional status, disease and weed identification, and drought stress [103]. With more UAV photos, digital image methods will be able to study plant diseases and other things in the future.\n\n4.6 Real-time monitoring of road traffic\n\nThe integration of UAVs with road traffic monitoring (RTM) systems has piqued the curiosity of many. UAVs can accomplish 100% automation of the transportation industry in RTM [104]. Rescue squads, roadway surveyors, traffic cops, and field support personnel will all be automated. Reliable and intelligent UAVs can support with the automation of these parts. UAVs have emerged as a new viable instrument for gathering data on highway traffic situations. As compared to traditional monitoring systems e.g., surveillance cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and circuit analyzers, low-cost UAVs, or drones, can inspect large sections of road [101]. Local police can use drones to gain a clear picture of road accidents or to conduct a large security crackdown on illegal activities along the highway, including car theft. Some of the other implications include vehicle recognition; raids on suspect cars; pursuing hijackers and armed robbers, or anybody who breaches traffic regulations. It may also be used to monitor driving and incidents in vehicles and probably prevent traffic bottlenecks and overcrowding [105]. Figure 12 depicts an overview of UAV service on the roadway.\n\nLikewise, UAVs may be used to monitor road conditions, such as detecting fractures and providing early warning to avert traffic accidents and reduce damage. At present, road inspection and monitoring are carried out using human vehicles, and the level of automation must be increased. The combination of road inspection technologies with UAVs has the potential to drastically minimize road damage. UAVs can take pictures of road cracks and use target detection algorithms to figure out what they are.\n\n4.7 UAVs for automated forest restoration\n\nOne more developing study area is the use of UAVs for controlled forest restoration (AFR). UAVs could be used to aid in the accomplishment of re-vegetation activities e.g., site infrastructure, site inspection, restoration plan, seedling supply, site maintenance (germinating and weeding, for example), and bio-diversity survey after restoring interventions [106]. Existing technology, such as GPS and image sensors, assists UAVs in performing specific tasks, such as fundamental pre-restoration site inspections and monitoring various aspects of biodiversity revival. UAVs could evaluate any alterations in temperature, forest functions, and ecological composition, hence assisting in the surveillance of replanting [107]. High-resolution cameras mounted on UAVs can give useful data on natural forests to aid in forest restoration initiatives. Because of their simplicity of data acquisition and mobility, UAV cameras with suitable resolution can aid in the characterization and study of forest landscapes. Likewise, optical sensors mounted on UAVs are being used to obtain geometric properties of forests, such as vegetation cover, diameter, and length [108]. UAVs can also be used for remote sensing, which is a reliable and effective way to monitor forests that is different from the way it has been done in the past.\n\n4.8 UAVs for monitoring of overhead power lines\n\nPower line fault detection and avoidance are critical for the reliability and quality of generation capacity. Traditional procedures have several disadvantages, including expensive costs, inconvenient deployment, and dangerous dangers. As a result, researchers are interested in UAV-based power line distribution and inspection, as illustrated in Fig. 13. The safety of a power transmission system is sometimes referred to as power line inspection. The use of a digital camera installed on UAV to photograph power line corridors is a practical way to perform inspection duties [109]. UAVs can also be installed to look for broken bolts, rust or corrosion, and lightning strikes on electrical pylons. Short-circuiting issue of electricity lines is most commonly caused by severe weather, bushfires, and tree falls. Authors of a recent research [110] examined the use of UAVs to detect and monitor defects in overhead transmission lines. To find defects, both climbing robots and flying UAVs can be utilized. These inspection tasks may be carried out by UAVs at a cheaper cost than helicopters and with a lower risk than traditional foot patrol. Fixed-wing UAVs, which can fly at high altitude and speed than other types of UAVs, are most commonly used for rough inspection. Multirotor UAVs, on the other hand, obtain photographs in the air at a closer distance from the objects by hovering. Because of their excellent 3D mobility, multirotor UAVs are ideal. Despite these advantages, autonomous mission planning and piloting of a multirotor UAV in a limited or complicated area is difficult. Advanced data collection, exchange, and processing tools for cooperative UAV networks should be researched in the future to provide reliable, efficient, and speedier inspections.\n\n4.9 UAVs for monitoring and assessing plant stress\n\nUAVs have become an integral element of data collection in multiple applications. The use of UAVs in agriculture is highly suitable in multiple scenarios. Currently, the use of UAVs is steadily expanding to monitor and assess crops, forests and orchards. They play a major role to manage plant stress such as pests, nutrition deficiencies, disease and water quality and quantity. Several studies have been reported on plant height assessment, canopy cover estimation, vegetation classification, biomass estimation, yield prediction and stress detection [111]. Every domain has certain aspects which must be kept into account to address the impact of UAV-enabled services. Among these domains, plant stress detection and quantification has received high attention.\n\nSeveral UAV-based approached are being used to assess plant stress. However, there are several shortcomings which prevent their usage at a high-scale. For instance, the techniques based on thermal imagery are limited by negative impact from various factors including stomatal conductance patterns, canopy architecture, shadows and soil background. Similarly, methods based on hyperspectral and multispectral images suffer from spatial resolutions, angel of capture, illumination and canopy structure. Moreover, UAV-based red, green, and blue (RGB) images are only feasible in clear visibility scenarios. Although image-based techniques are useful for pesticide applications, irrigation practices, disease prediction and prevention and weather information, but they are not feasible yet, regardless of the deployment techniques and sensing devices. There is a need to develop sophisticated ML and computer vision techniques along with novel sensors for UAVs to overcome aforementioned limitations. At the same time, research fraternity should perform more experiments to study plant physiology and impact of various stresses on biological process. It will be an excellent opportunity to contribute in this domain and find viable solutions.\n\n4.10 UAVs for space exploration\n\nThere is an emerging trend to utilize UAVs for planetary exploration from last few years. UAVs offer tremendous potentials to carry our space missions such as study about moon surface and atmosphere. Although several planetary exploration techniques are available to perform these missions including rovers, landers, orbiters, flying balloons, flying spacecraft, probes and telescopes [112]. However, these techniques are restricted by resolution, limited information and versatility. Therefore, UAVs have recently got focus due to several benefits in such missions. Several government bodies and space agencies including National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has started using UAVs to other solar bodies. Researchers have focused on solar exploration works through autonomous, semi-autonomous and UAVs. According to Sharma et al. [112], UAVs have good chances to fly in the atmosphere of Mars. It is due to the potential features of hovering, VTOL and low-speed forward flight. In particular, UAVs offer a wide coverage area as compared to exiting orbiters and rovers. As gravity is less at Mars surface and it has low density, so UAV can achieve an optimal height of 380 m. However, some challenges still exist in terms of efficiency and cost. Thus, there is a need to develop compatible propulsion system, suitable aerodynamic design, and optimal flight trajectories.\n\n4.11 Aquaculture farm monitoring and management\n\nUAVs have the ability to monitor fish farms in aquaculture, particularly on offshore sites. The mobility and affordability of UAVs ensures accessibility to remote areas. The automation and mechanization to monitor farms through UAVs, sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches will support farmers to gather information about farms and interact efficiently. Moreover, due to the extensive advancements in aquaculture industry, UAVs can be used to achieve target results and effectively monitor the expanding farm sites. UAVs can significantly reduce cost and labors in the aquaculture industry, thus providing stability in fish form through minimizing farm deaths. In aquaculture, UAVs can be used to capture real-time images on underwater species, observing fish behavior, remote sensing, site surveillance, fish feeding management, and for assessment of the species [113].\n\nUAVs offer enormous benefits for monitoring offshore kelp aquaculture farms. Giant kelps are effective aquaculture crops which needs regular monitoring in order to achieve maximum production, and optimizing biomass and nutritional content. For this purpose, a small UAV carrying a lightweight optical sensor can be used to monitor these farms. It can estimate the tissue nitrogen quantity, density and canopy area based on space and time scales, which plays significant role to observe any changes in kelps. UAVs with integrated sensors such as hyperspectral, multispectral and RGB cameras can be used to provide a natural image of kelp forest canopy. Similarly, UAVs can be used to observe and characterize the mobility of the pellets. Through collected information, farmers can attain feeding optimization.\n\n4.12 UAVs in emergency medical services\n\nUAVs have shown great potential in smart cities worldwide. Smart cities have smart healthcare system based on telemetry, implantable medical equipments, and medical drones to quickly deliver first-aid supplies. Currently, UAVs have proven their stature to tackle with COVID-19 pandemic in different countries. However, it is worth noting that the leading organization to tackle with COVID-19 is the national EMS institution along with several parties such as EMS personnel, nurses, and medical doctors. In addition, several policy makers are considering different preventive measure to fight against COVID-19 including wearing surgical masks, avoiding facial-touching, regular hand-washing, city lockdown, high risk area avoidance, social gathering avoidance and implementing health codes [114]. Policy makers should consider the balance between economy and public safety before introducing any new measures. Currently, UAVs are being used to perform various tasks to prevent COVID-19 such as:\n\nTransport of patients\n\nPublic announcements\n\nCrowd surveillance\n\nSpraying disinfection\n\nMass screening\n\nCrown aerial monitoring\n\nDelivering vaccines and other medical supplies\n\nA very common application of UAVs is to supervise or monitor any specific area. UAV-integrated cameras can assist in real-time surveillance. Thermal cameras can be implemented to trace febrile patients. It helps to quickly implement isolation rules in any certain area in order to reduce the risk of further disease spread. Similarly, on-board loudspeaker can help to deliver official policies and give appropriate instructions in any community [115]. UAVs can help to deliver daily life items, ensuring reduction in mass contact at crowded markets or other public places. Furthermore, UAVs can support in transportation tasks such as medicament supply deliver and COVID test sampling collecting, ultimately reducing the risk of contact with infectious person and virus spread. UAVs can also play their role in nucleic acid testing, collecting samples and delivering reports. They can also be used to spray disinfection in order to mitigate the viability of the virus on the surface. In 2020, UAVs have been used during the COVID-19 crises to deliver medical supplies in USA, China, Chile etc. Recently, Zipline, working collaboratively with Novant-Health, has been providing COVID-19 vaccines in North Carolina, USA. UAVs have been used to provide personal protective equipment to frontline staff fighting against this pandemic. Different applications of UAVs to cope with COVID-19 are presented in Fig. 14.\n\n4.13 UAVs for maritime communication and surveillance\n\nAerial platform include the use of high-altitude platform Stations (HAPS), flying up to 20 km from the ground and UAVs flying at a few hundred meters above the sea surface [116]. Some UAVs can be installed and remotely operated from small boats, while larger systems rely on onshore architectures to launch and operate. This technology is complementary to surface and underwater vehicles since it can be easily controlled in the air at some distance and altitude, and thus communicate at a different speed and position. In maritime networks, UAVs can assist to forward the data from ground station to mobile vessel even in the absence of LoS path. In addition, UAVs can relay data from IoT sensors located in ocean and relay data from/to USVs. The main limitation in the operation of UAVs is limited battery capacity and payload. This limitation can be relieved through a tethered UAVs connected with a power supply. However, it can pose another issue of limited mobility. There is a need to find optimal path to collect data from the sensor nodes in maritime environment. Some recent works have been reported on tethered UAVs fixed on buoys [117]. Tethered UAVs can hover at a limited range above the water surface with limited mobility and coverage. Also, optical fibers can be connected with tethered UAVs to ensure high transmission rates. However, HAPs are more suitable as they offer extended coverage. Moreover, HAPs can carry large antennas, removing less weight limitations and offering autonomy up to several months.\n\nDue to enormous benefits of UAVs in maritime communication, UAV-to-ship wireless channels must be developed. Furthermore, efficient system testing must be conducted for the promising UAV-to-ship networks. In maritime environments, UAV communication faces different channel characteristics, including temperature of troposphere above the ocean, pressure, waveguide impact due to humidity, signal attenuation due to climate change and seawater irregular fluctuations. In contrast to terrestrial UAV-to-ground channels, the scatterers effect on UAV-to-Ship is uneven due to irregular sea waves. Similarly, waveguide propagation is another essential factor in UAV-to-ship channels, which ultimate introduces different channel characteristics. In order to ensure sophisticated UAV communication in such maritime environments, the related channel modeling is an open research area for future contributions. In US, both the coastal guard and Navy have deployed a group of small UAVs to assist manned assets, supporting in many aspects to support law enforcement, surveillance and military missions in marine and coastal environments. Moreover, two US-based systems ScanEagle and MQ-4C Triton are being used for naval missions. The former is deployed with radar as well as infrared (IR) and electro-optical (EO) sensors, making is capable to perform persistent maritime surveillance missions. It has the ability to identify ships through installed AIR receivers.\n\n4.14 Flying cars and eVTOLs\n\nRapidly expanding high infrastructure costs, land space limitations and urban population put a critical challenge for the future ground-based transportation systems. Flying cars, no more confined to the realm of fiction, are a remarkable step in transportation industry. Flying cars and eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft is envisaged to revolutionize the future transportation system, which can substantially minimize greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint of personal vehicles as well as travel time. Currently, over 250 companies have started initiatives on eVTOLs and flying cars, and few vehicles will pave their way to commercial market soon [118]. From last few decades, there has been a notable expansion in the use of personal vehicles worldwide, causing traffic congestion, a rapid climate change, and enhanced commuting duration, particularly in metropolitan areas. In this regard, eVTOLs and flying cars are expected to be the future of smart transportation system as they will support reduced emission and traffic congestion along with improving security. These disruptive technologies will have diverse requirements based on their application scenario. For example, personal vehicles should be economical, lightweight, and should contain fewer parking spaces, while piloted taxi services are envisaged to have range and speed according to their Rural Air Mobility (RAM) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) missions.\n\nFlying car manufacturers are finding innovative designs to shrink the vehicle size through detachable propellers or retractable wings for different tasks such as drive mode or garage parking. Several flight mechanisms and wing configuration are being proposed for the eVTOLs and flying cars to ensure forward flight for the cruise and vertical lift for both take-off and landing. At present, mostly available flying cars have hybrid energy supply system or only gasoline and do not have VTOL capabilities. However, ensuring a complete electric flying car is yet to be explored. In a recent study [118], authors discussed fully electric powertrain design with dual energy sources, such as hybrid fuel cells and batteries, to support extended range. Moreover, authors also discussed the use of a single propeller for both flight and drive modes in order to aid VTOL capability. Despite these technical advancements, initiating widespread deployment of flying cars will impose an immense standardization challenges and sustainability implications [119]. Despite these challenges, several companies have started innovative strategies to introduce these smart flying vehicles in future. With expanding features supporting timesaving, environment, and economic potentials, it’s time for regulatory bodies to make the life-changing leap to seed the architecture development for personal urban airspace utility. With these advancements in aviation regulations as well as processing and sensor technologies, we can expect a transition toward futuristic smart and automatic transportation systems."
