        "text": "Introduction\n\nAn unoccupied aircraft system or UAS is comprised of an aircraft (typically, fixed- or rotary-wing) and the equipment needed to remotely operate the aircraft including a remote controller, additional ground control (e.g., computing station), and communication between components. UAS are otherwise known as drones, unoccupied/uncrewed/unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) among others. In most cases, UAS refer to non-military small UAS (sUAS) that adhere to civil aviation size/weight requirements such as weighing less than 55 pounds (about 25 kilograms) in the United States as regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or the equivalent civil aviation authority in other countries. To geographers and geographic information scientists (GIScientists), UAS enable the collection of very high-spatial and -temporal resolution aerial data for a relatively low-cost compared to more traditional means (e.g., field-based surveys, weather balloons, occupied/piloted aircraft, satellites). The low-cost and relative ease of operation of UAS supports adoption of the technology in geographic research and teaching efforts. GIScientists including remote sensing experts have been quick to incorporate UAS into their work to examine geographic problems at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. In this way, UAS as a topic cannot be separated from remote sensing because the technology is primarily used to remotely sense Earth’s surface using optical sensors (e.g., images, video), lidar, and radar. Digital photogrammetric methods tie together overlapping aerial images to generate three-dimensional (3D) point clouds and orthophotos. Specifically, images are processed using a suite of computer vision algorithms referred to together as Structure from Motion-Multiview Stereo (SfM-MVS, SfM for short) photogrammetry. Geographers focusing on areas outside of geospatial techniques, though, also utilize UAS. These include physical geographers interested in modeling landforms and fluvial processes as well as human geographers interested in community-based work, social research, and/or ethical issues with UAS usage and data collection. It is important to note though that the topic of UAS is multi- and interdisciplinary. Design and development of UAS technology requires contributions from engineering and computer science among other fields, and UAS operation involves aspects of airspace regulation, aviation law, and policy. Here we focus on conceptual and applied aspects of UAS from the perspective of geography, but references from cognate fields are included when needed.\n\nGeneral Overviews\n\nConceptual works and meta-analyses (review papers) are incredibly important to those implementing unoccupied aircraft system (UAS) technology in their research. They can provide a broad background on the topic while also guiding readers to subfields of interest with their organization of content and extensive reference lists. Further, these works can help to conceptually frame the topic within a discipline or research area. Colomina and Molina 2014; Hardin and Hardin 2010; Pajares 2015; Tmušić, et al. 2020; and Watts, et al. 2012 contribute overarching reviews of UAS technology in the context of geographic and environmental research. Cummings, et al. 2017 and Singh and Frazier 2018 provide additional detail through meta-analysis and quantification of trends within published UAS research. Lippitt and Zhang 2018 and Simic Milas, et al. 2018 offer perspective on how UAS fits within the field of remote sensing while Hardin, et al. 2019 outlines challenges to UAS integration into geographic research.\n\nColomina, I., and P.
