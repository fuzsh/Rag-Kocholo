        "text": "Drones enable a significant enhancement in Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. Drones are a potentially life-saving tool in SAR operations, providing critical support to SAR teams to reduce risk to humans, enable quicker search and provide aerial support during adverse weather conditions[1].\n\nSearch and Rescue\n\n‍Search and rescue (SAR) is a subset of public safety operations and involves activities revolving around finding missing people. It generally comes under the purview of the fire department in most countries[2].\n\nAdvantages of Drones for SAR\n\n‍Search and rescue operations are fairly difficult and unpredictable, unlike other public safety operations. These two factors play an important role in the overall outcome of a SAR mission[2]:\n\nTime: In most SAR missions, the missing person is trapped in a life-threatening situation, where the person has less time. So it becomes important for rescuers to find the person at the earliest.\n\nTerrain: SAR missions outside human establishments can face challenging terrain in the form of a snowy mountain, rainforest, etc. which might slow the entire operation.\n\n‍\n\nHere are some of the reasons highlighted in[2] why SAR teams, all over the world, are using drones to overcome challenges in their work:\n\nDrones are fast: Compared to ground-based vehicles, drones can reach a location a lot faster; even reach inaccessible places. For example, in the Czech Republic, there is an agency called the Mountain Rescue Service of the Czech Republic that uses drones to find missing people trapped by an avalanche.\n\nSituational awareness: Drones provide cheap, fast access to aerial data of a large area. This allows responders to map the entire search zone and pinpoint possible places where the missing person might be trapped.\n\nDetect and identify: Drones can carry different sensors that can be used for identifying ground objects. In the next section, we will discuss in detail how these sensors are used.\n\nCommunication: A drone, carrying a loudspeaker, can repeatedly broadcast a message making the missing person aware that people are looking for him/her.\n\nSimulation of Drones-based Search and Rescue(SAR) Scenario with ns-3 and NetSimylyzer.\n\nThings Needed:\n\nPreferably a good Linux Variant OS\n\nns-3 Simulator,\n\nNetAnimator 2D Visualization tool,\n\nNetSimylyzer add-on module for ns-3\n\nNetSimulyzer 3D Visualization Tool,\n\nA suitable Mobility Model\n\nA suitable Traffic Model\n\n3D models of Drones\n\n3D model of a suitable landscape.\n\nInstalling Necessary Software\n\nStep 1: Installing Linux Variant OS\n\nIf you are planning to install a suitable Linux Operating system Under VirtualBox, then you may need to install VirtualBox First,\n\nYou may install VirtualBox and a suitable version of Linux by doing a procedure as the one explained in the following article[3].\n\nInstalling an old Linux under VirtualBox and using Shared Folders.\n\nStep 2: Installing a Suitable Version of ns-3\n\nYou may install a suitable version of ns-3 by following the article[4].\n\nCmake based ns-3.37 install in Debian 11 chroot Environment\n\nStep 3: Installing NetSimulyzer Add-on Module in ns-3\n\nYou may install a suitable version of NetSimulyzer Add-on Module in ns-3 by following the article[5].\n\nInstalling NetSimulyzer 3D Visualization Module with ns-3.37\n\nStep 4: Installing NetSimulyzer 3D Visualization Tool\n\nYou may install a suitable version of NetSimulyzer 3D Visualization Tool by following the article[6].\n\nInstalling NetSimulyzer 3D Visualization Tool under Debian 11\n\nStep 5: Simulating a Basic 3D UAV/Drone Scenario by following an Example\n\nYou may construct a ns-3 simulation and set up the 3D components of the simulation as explained in the article[7] and construct the UAV-based Search and Rescue (SAR) scenario.\n\nUsing Gauss-Markov 3D Mobility Model Under ns-3 for Simulating Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Aerial Ad-hoc Network (AANET) and Flying Ad-hoc Network (FANET)\n\nFrom the following article[8], you may understand the way of using a 3D landscape (here the buildings) in a 3D network simulation :\n\nTesting the New Semi Random Circular Mobility Model of ns-3.\n\nStep 6: Implementing the Actual Search and Rescue (SAR) Scenario.\n\nIf you are successful up to step-5, then you may proceed to remodel the above example FANET scenario for doing the proposed Search and Rescue (SAR) Scenario. For that, we will need some suitable 3D objects to mimic the actual Search and Rescue (SAR) Scenario. In this example, we assume that the search and rescue operation was conducted on a mountain forest landscape. So to simulate that landscape, we will need a suitable 3D model of a landscape. In addition to that, we may need different models of Drones/UAVs. There are some internet resources from which you may collect such royalty-free 3D models. You may first download the necessary 3D models from such resources.\n\nIn ns-3 simulation script, we should do the following\n\nInclude necessary header files\n\nDeclare variable\n\nOptionally set up some functions for tracing purposes\n\nSetting up things to log 2D outputs with NetAnim\n\nSetting up things to log 3D outputs with NetSimulyzer\n\nOptionally setting up some UDP/TCP flows to mimic communication in SAR\n\nOptionally setting up FlowMonitor for analyzing the performance of TCP and UDP flows\n\nUse a suitable Mobility model for simulating UAVs under SAR scenario\n\nFurther, to construct one such basic 3D scenario will need the following :\n\nA 3D model of a forest landscape or any suitable landscape to mimic SAR scenario\n\n3D models of Drones/UAVs\n\nIf you check the sections of the code from examples from [7] and [8], you may understand the above 10 things that are necessary to construct the proposed Search and Rescue (SAR) Scenario.\n\nThe following are the parameters of the actual implementation:\n\nSome Input Parameters of the Simulation:\n\nThe size of the Topology : 1000m X 1000m\n\nType of landscape : Mountain forest landscape.\n\nHeight of the highest peak : 100 m\n\nThe Number of Drones : 25 to 50\n\nSize of the Drones : ?\n\nThe Flying Height of Drones : 75 m to 120 m [10]\n\nSpeed of the Drones : 11 m/s [9]\n\nDrone’s Mobility Model : 3D Gauss-Markov Mobility\n\nNumber of Base Stations : 1\n\nDrone Data Rate : 500 kb/s (to mimic a small compressed image sent to the base station node)\n\nTransport Protocol : TCP\n\nMulti-hop Routing Protocol : AODV\n\nMac Layer Protocol : 802.11p or 802.11b\n\nSimulation Duration : 10 to 20 minutes (depends upon the estimated battery capacity of the drones)\n\nSome Outputs of the Simulation:\n\nAnalysis of FlowMonitor outputs (if possible, prepare some Tables & Graphs)\n\nConsumed Battery Energy\n\nPDF\n\nThroughput\n\nE2E Delay\n\netc.\n\n2D NetAnim Output\n\n3D NetSimulyzer Output\n\nStep 6a: Staring a Skeleton Simulation Code\n\nFirst, we may create a new simulation file “SimulationOfSARusingDrones1.cc” and prepare a few lines to start a 3D FANET/UAV simulation.\n\nFirst, include the necessary header files and use the necessary namespaces.\n\n#include “ns3/core-module.h”\n\n#include “ns3/mobility-module.h”\n\n#include “ns3/netanim-module.h”\n\n#include “ns3/netsimulyzer-module.h”using namespace ns3;\n\nNow enable 3D NetSimulyzer to create 3D output traces in a file “SimulationOfSARusingDrones.json”.\n\nSetup a 3D model to represent the mountain forest area\n\nCreate 2D NetAnim output if necessary.\n\nAnimationInterface anim (“SimulationOfSARusingDrones.xml”);\n\nInstruct to stop the simulation at ‘simTimeSec’ and run the simulation at last and destroy all the objects at the end of the simulation.\n\nIf we now run the simulation, it will show the following output:\n\nNow we can open the 3D output of the simulation with NetSimulyzer. Now we are having a roughly 1000 mX 1000 m forest area to do search and rescue operations.\n\nThe following is a runnable version of the small skeleton simulation script:\n\nStep 6b: Now Create Two Sink nodes\n\nHere we are going to use two jeeps as sink nodes. So we have to use appropriate 3D models as shown below:\n\nSet static mobility model in them.\n\nSet suitable 3D models to represent the Jeep sink object.\n\nnetsimulyzer::NodeConfigurationHelper bsHelper{orchestrator};\n\nbsHelper.Set (“Model”, StringValue( StringValue(netsimulyzer::models::JEEP)));\n\nbsHelper.Install(bsContainer);\n\nIf we run the simulation and visualize the 3D output in NetSimulyzer, then we will see two Jeeps parked at a corner of the forest.\n\nStep 6c: Now Create 25 Drone nodes\n\nHere we are going to use 25 drone objects to do a search and rescue operations. So we have to use appropriate 3D models as shown below:\n\nIf we run the simulation and visualize the 3D output in NetSimulyzer, then we will see 25 drones along with two Jeeps that are parked at a corner of the forest.\n\nThe following gif animation of the NetSimulyzer output shows the SAR operation in action.\n\nDoing Scholarly Research on SAR Network Simulation\n\nThe above outputs are elementary ones. In fact, it is possible to do excellent research work on UAV/FANET since it has a lot of scope for new innovations in this area. For example, it is possible to do an evaluation of MAC layer protocols or Network Layer protocols or Transport Layer protocols under the SAR scenario.\n\nIt is possible to do a research quality evaluation and new innovations in this area and attain results such as the one shown in the following article.\n\nGenerating Genuine, Quality Tables & Graphs for Publication.\n\nReferences:"
