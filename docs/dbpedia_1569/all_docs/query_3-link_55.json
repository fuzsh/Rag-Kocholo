        "text": "The use of UAVs, known popularly as drones, has been rapidly increasing across a range of commercial purposes, including infrastructure, agriculture, security, delivery, emergency response and government applications.\n\nDrones often save time and, by allowing operators to stay at a safe distance, reduce risk when performing certain activities. Photographers and videographers can capture aerial footage. Land can be quickly and accurately surveyed for detailed mapping. Data can be gathered in mining operations, keeping people out of hazardous situations. First responders can more effectively analyze dangerous situations while staying out of harm’s way. And inspectors can acquire footage from vantage points that they never thought possible.\n\nUL Solutions has the experience and expertise to help with a wide variety of certification and testing services for drone manufacturers and developers. And we also offer project management services to aid customers in large or multi-faceted compliance projects.\n\nDefinitions\n\nUAS - Unmanned Aerial System, the complete system including vehicle, controller, radios, and anything necessary for flight\n\nUAV - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, or Unmanned Aircraft, is the aircraft component of a Unmanned Aerial System, and is operated without the possibility of direct human intervention from within or on the aircraft\n\nDrone - another term for UAV\n\nUL 3030 — Listing for commercial drones\n\nUL 3030, the Standard for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, addresses electrical system requirements for commercial UAVs operated by trained pilots. This new Standard covers commercial (e.g., agricultural, scientific, research, film industry or news broadcast video, roof inspections) and tactical (e.g., government, local police, search and rescue).\n\nThough different energy sources may power drones, battery technology is a key element in the success of UAVs. As with all battery applications, there are several critical needs, including:\n\nAssessing and validating battery safety.\n\nProving/defining system capabilities in safe mode.\n\nEvaluating the coordination of the charger, battery system and load as safe.\n\nMechanical testing (e.g., impact, drop, vibration, mechanical shock).\n\nEnvironmental testing (e.g., thermal cycling, mold stress, water exposure, immersion).\n\nAspects such as airworthiness, the efficacy of controls and similar topics are outside the scope of this Standard, so these issues must be addressed by regulations, user programs and other standards.\n\nUL 3300 — Outline of Investigation for SCIEE robots\n\nCertification for certain types of consumer drones can be covered under UL 3300, Outline of Investigation for Service, Communication, Information, Education and Entertainment Robots.\n\nBattery safety and component certification for UAVs\n\nAs part of end-product certification or as a separate certification project, we can help customers with our pioneering expertise in battery safety testing, including:\n\nUN 38.3 battery transportation.\n\nBattery safety Standards.\n\nUL 2580, the Standard for Batteries for Use In Electric Vehicles.\n\nUL 2271, the Standard for Batteries for Use In Light Electric Vehicle (LEV) Applications.\n\nUL 62133-2, the Standard for Safety for Secondary Cells and Batteries Containing Alkaline or Other Non-Acid Electrolytes - Safety Requirements for Portable Sealed Secondary Cells, and for Batteries Made from Them, for Use in Portable Applications - Part 2: Lithium Systems.\n\nUL 2054, the Standard for Household and Commercial Batteries.\n\nIf your drone uses proprietary components that require certification, our experts are ready to help.\n\nPerformance testing, assessment and certification services for drones\n\nUL Solutions offers a wide range of testing, assessment and certification services for various attributes beyond safety, such as performance, functional safety and cybersecurity. These activities focus upon the drone as well as the safety-related components within UL 1998, the Standard for Software in Programmable Components.\n\nEnergy efficiency for battery chargers.\n\nWireless services – electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), FCC, antenna, radio types, 5G and RF testing.\n\nIngress protection (IP) testing – IEC 60529.\n\nInteroperability – ASTM F3411\n\nCybersecurity – UL 2900, the Standard for Software Cybersecurity for Network-Connectable Products.\n\nDrone use in hazardous locations – explosive atmospheres, such as inspection of mines, fuel tanks, pipelines, etc.\n\nToxic substances testing – RoHS, WEEE, REACH, TSCA and California Prop 65.\n\nInternational certification and global market access\n\nEuropean Directives and Regulations for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)\n\nOur Global Market Access team assists customers with market access readiness to help with successful access to their desired markets, as well as compiling technical files and other compliance documentation (toxic substances, etc.) to help you meet European Union Directives and Regulations:\n\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems.\n\nLow Voltage Directive.\n\nEMC Directive.\n\nRED Directive.\n\nMachinery Directive.\n\nRoHS Directive.\n\nQuality Council of India — Certification Scheme for Unmanned Aircraft Systems\n\nWe have a team of experts who can help you certify your products to India’s Quality Council drone program.\n\nRegulatory assessment services\n\nWe support your UAS with regulatory assessment for several countries. Our regulatory services provide customers with a regulatory compliance road map, investigative reports on technical requirements, as well as compliance testing to UL, IEC, ASTM and ASD-STAN standards.\n\nOther specialized services include research reports on:\n\nFAA Part 89 Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft.\n\nEASA and U.K. Remote Identification.\n\nFAA Means of Compliance."
