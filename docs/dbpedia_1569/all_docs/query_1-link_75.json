        "text": "Unmanned Systems\n\nVirginia’s collection of assets in the air, on land, and at sea uniquely position the Commonwealth to serve as a leader in this emerging industry. Home to one of six FAA-designated UAS test sites and two NASA facilities focusing on UAS research, Langley Research Center and Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia is poised to lead this promising disruptive technology sector and host unmanned systems manufacturing and testing.\n\nRead our Aerospace and Unmanned Aerial Systems brochure\n\nContact\n\nA Leader in Unmanned Systems\n\nVirginia’s R&D assets, top-ranked education system, varied geography for testing, and proximity to Washington, D.C. and major defense contractors set the foundation for success in Virginia for companies in the unmanned systems industry.\n\nRead More\n\nClose\n\nVirginia is already home to a collection of assets that are attractive to companies operating in the rapidly evolving unmanned systems industry. Virginia houses an FAA-designated test range, varied testing environments, including a Beyond-Visual-Line-of-Sight corridor, and university and federal centers engaged in cutting-edge industry R&D.\n\nVirginia's Unmanned Systems Assets\n\nMid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership (MAAP)\n\nHoused at Virginia Tech, MAAP is an FAA-designated test site for unmanned aircraft systems. MAAP focuses on foundational technologies and high-value operations that will enable the efficient use of unmanned aircraft for a broad range of applications. Key areas of focus include:\n\nFundamental and applied research on key topics including detect and avoid, UAS traffic management, UAS communications, and impact risk\n\nAdvanced testing and evaluation of technology and systems, including testing against new and emerging industry standards\n\nSafety case development\n\nVirginia Tech is also home to the Virginia Tech Drone Park, where students, researchers, faculty, staff, or university affiliates can safely operate UAS without the constraints of registrations, certifications, or specialized training. The Drone Park is one of the tallest netted facilities of its kind and features nearly 3 million cubic feet of flight space.\n\nNASA Langley\n\nNASA Langley is focused on the safe incorporation of drones into the airspace and has conducted testing to assess how well autonomous craft avoid structures, each other, and other hazards at low altitudes. Testing is being performed on a small flight range on Langley’s property, not far from CERTAIN - City Environment for Range Testing of Autonomous Integrated Navigation - which mimics an urban environment where drones can be monitored while safely flying between buildings and over streets with pedestrian and vehicle traffic.\n\nNASA Langley also houses the Autonomy Incubator — a group of multi-disciplinary scientists, engineers, and student interns that study and research autonomy skills that will contribute expertise across NASA missions and other applications where autonomous systems can be applied.\n\nWallops Island\n\nHome to NASA Wallops Flight Facility and the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS), Wallops Island on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, is also home to the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport’s Unmanned Aircraft Systems (MARS UAS) Airfield, which features:\n\nRunway that measures 3,000 feet long x 75 feet wide\n\nConcrete pad that measures 130 feet by 120 feet and is rated to 5,000 psi for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) operations\n\nAirfield surrounded by 75 square nautical miles of restricted airspace available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to unlimited altitude.\n\nHangar planned for construction will be 90 feet by 50 feet, with a 70-foot-tall rollup door, lab space, and communications and broadband connectivity\n\nFAA BEYOND Program\n\nVirginia is one of nine participants in the FAA’s BEYOND program, which continues the work of the highly successful UAS Integration Pilot Program (IPP) by focusing on enabling routine, scalable operations beyond visual line of sight. Virginia’s BEYOND team is advancing UAS applications for infrastructure inspection, insurance damage assessment, and package delivery. Day-to-day operations of the program in Virginia will be managed by the Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership (MAAP). Corporate partners include:\n\nVirginia Tech Transportation Institute\n\nDriving Innovation\n\nVirginia is home to a number of companies at the forefront of self-driving technology.

The VAC offers automated vehicle developers the opportunity to test their technologies on Virginia roads covering more than 70 miles of interstates and arterials in Northern Virginia, including Interstates 66, 495, and 95, as well as state routes 29 and 50. The corridors also include two test-track environments - the Virginia Smart Road, located on-site at the Transportation Institute, and the Virginia International Raceway in Southern Virginia.\n\nThere’s probably more real-world commercial-level activity happening here in Virginia than anywhere in the country. It’s a testament to the positive business climate, technical capability, and support from multiple administrations.\n\nMark Blanks Director, Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership\n\nMid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS), Accomack County\n\nAutonomous Underwater Research & Testing\n\nVirginia’s geographic position on the East Coast provides access to a wide variety of waters for testing – from marshes and shallow rivers to the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.
