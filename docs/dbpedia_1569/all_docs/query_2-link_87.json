        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nA numerical weather model’s ability to accurately simulate atmospheric dynamical and physical processes depends critically on several factors. These are among others the spatial grid resolution and the parameterization schemes used to represent processes connected to clouds, radiation, precipitation, and turbulence (e.g., Pleim and Xiu 1995; Alapaty et al. 2001; Teixeira et al. 2008). In addition, the quality of the data used to initialize and force the model is essential for the success of a numerical simulation. These data often originate from global atmospheric analyses or forecasts [e.g., from the Global Forecast System (GFS) or the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)] with resolutions typically being 15–50 km in the horizontal and 3–6 h in time. These atmospheric data are often not accurate enough for high-resolution simulations of local features, which may be sensitive to small errors in the large-scale flow, as pointed out by Nance and Durran (1997) in their study of lee waves. The quality of the analysis data depends mainly on two factors. One is the technique used to compile the analysis (i.e., the numerical weather prediction model used to generate the first guess and the statistical methods used to combine the first-guess information and the observations). The second factor is the quality and coverage of the observations used to create the analysis (e.g., Langland et al. 1999). Observations can be particularly sparse over areas such as the world’s oceans and the Arctic and Antarctic.\n\nTo improve numerical weather simulations, the initial and forcing data are often supplemented with additional in situ or remote sensing observations through a method called nudging, or four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA; e.g., Anthes 1974; Stauffer and Seaman 1990, 1994; Stauffer et al. 1991). When applied to observational data, as done in the present study, this assimilation method “nudges” the modeled atmospheric state toward the observations by introducing an artificial forcing term in the model’s governing equations. The forcing term is based on the difference between the modeled and observed atmospheric state. Compared to alternative data assimilation methods, like three/four-dimensional variational data assimilation (3D-Var or 4D-Var) and ensemble Kalman filter methods, nudging is conceptually simple and computationally inexpensive (e.g., Stauffer and Seaman 1990; Fast 1995; Reen and Stauffer 2010).\n\nThe provision of corresponding data for assimilation and also for model validation, however, poses major technical challenges. This is especially valid for high-resolution numerical simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), as the operational network of automatic weather stations and radiosondes generally is too sparse and unevenly distributed to accurately describe the temperature, wind, and moisture structure with high temporal and spatial resolution (e.g., Otkin et al. 2011). Conventional in situ instrument platforms like towers and captive balloons and remote sensing technologies as lidars, radars, sodars, and satellites have the potential of aiding toward the desired datasets for assimilation and validation. For some applications, like meteorological field campaigns that are targeted toward specific ABL phenomena in remote areas, and that are limited in time and by a small budget, these instrument platforms may, however, be too expensive. They may furthermore be too demanding to operate in the field (e.g., due to the requirement of expert personnel, limited in-field mobility, and infrastructural requirements like a continuous demand for electricity). In this context, unmanned aerial systems (UASs) have the potential to become an invaluable tool in ABL research. These systems, consisting mainly of an unmanned aircraft and a ground control station, were for the first time used for atmospheric measurements in the 1970s (Konrad et al. 1970). Following the recent development in micro-electrical components, both with respect to avionics as well as instrumentation and sensors for atmospheric measurements, these have now become significantly more viable and feature among other things fully autonomous navigation and advanced mission planning tools.\n\nExamples of such systems include the Mini Aerial Vehicle (M2AV; Van den Kroonenberg et al. 2008; Martin et al. 2010), the Aerosonde (Curry et al. 2004), and the Small Unmanned Meteorological Observer (SUMO; Reuder et al. 2009). These lightweight UASs represent a novel and very flexible instrument platform that is generally user friendly and cost efficient to operate. Furthermore, they are able to provide a unique data coverage in both space and time and thereby have the potential to augment and fill the observational gap between the aforementioned conventional instrument platforms. They are able to provide in situ data, not reliant on similarity or propagation assumptions, and they are undisturbed by clouds. Data delivery is fast or even instantaneous. Their low infrastructural requirements allow them to be used in otherwise data-sparse regions, such as the polar areas where the mentioned UASs have already been successfully operated.\n\nIn this article, we demonstrate a combined UAS and FDDA system, where profile data of temperature, humidity, and wind obtained with the UAS SUMO are assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF; Skamarock et al. 2008) using the FDDA technique. The system is applied to two case studies of weather situations that took place during the international Moso field campaign on 19 and 20 July 2009, in southwest Iceland. The weather situations were characterized by strong diurnal boundary layer temperature variation leading to thermally driven winds, predominantly in the form of sea-breeze circulation along the coast.\n\nSea breeze is recognized to have a great influence on the local to mesoscale flow in coastal areas. Knowledge on and predictability of this circulation may play an important role in local weather forecasting for aviation and transport at sea. Sea breeze is also found to be of large importance for the formation and movement of thunderstorm complexes (e.g., Pielke 1974) and transport of pollutants (e.g., Warner et al. 1978; Soler et al. 2011). Sea breeze is a widely studied phenomenon and reviews are given by Stull (1988) and Pielke (2002). Very few studies, however, focus on sea breeze at high latitudes. One such study is that by Grønås and Sandvik (1998) who studied sea breeze at latitudes higher than 60°N. With a main focus on Norway and Spitsbergen they found through idealized numerical simulations that the sea breeze is well developed at these latitudes in summertime. Another study of sea breeze at higher latitudes is that of Gahmberg et al. (2010) who focused on the interaction between sea breeze and synoptic flow. They found among other things the strongest sea breeze for moderate large-scale flows blowing 45°–90° anticlockwise from the offshore direction perpendicular to the coast.\n\nSea breeze in Iceland is mentioned in the paper of Bromwich et al. (2005), who made a high-resolution regional climate simulation of Iceland for 1991–2000. They concluded that sea breeze appears to be an integral part of the summertime weather along most of the coastline. Jónsson (2002) investigated wind speed and wind directions recorded by automatic weather stations throughout Iceland for the month of June and found observational evidence of the climatological presence of sea breeze in Iceland.\n\nSea-breeze circulations are finely balanced systems and typically a challenge for operational numerical weather prediction systems to accurately reproduce in both time and space (e.g., Fuentes et al. 2005). How the numerical simulations reproduce the surface and boundary layer flow and temperature including the sea-breeze circulation, with and without the assimilation of all and parts of the UAS temperature, humidity, and wind data, is the main topic of this study. In addition, several sensitivity experiments on different nudging parameters are carried out.\n\n3. The numerical simulations\n\nThe numerical simulations are performed using the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF-ARW) version 3.2.1 (Skamarock et al. 2008). The modeling system is fully compressible and is in this study run in nonhydrostatic mode using 3 two-way nested domains with a horizontal resolution of 9, 3, and 1 km. The outermost domain (855 × 810 km2) covers Iceland and the surrounding waters (50–100 km offshore) while the innermost domain (250 × 190 km2) covers southwest Iceland. In total, 51 vertical terrain-following model levels are used with an increased resolution toward the ground. The lowest half level is at approximately 9 AGL.\n\nTwo sets of 24-h simulations are performed: the first starting at 0000 UTC 19 July and the second at 0000 UTC 20 July 2009. The first 6 h of each simulation are considered as spinup. The Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM; Mlawer et al. 1997) scheme is used for longwave radiation parameterization, the Dudhia scheme (Dudhia 1989) is used for shortwave radiation, and the Unified National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP–NCAR)–Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) Noah land surface model (Chen and Dudhia 2001) is used with soil temperature and moisture in four layers for surface physics. Furthermore, the Yonsei University Scheme (Hong et al. 2006), a nonlocal-k theory, first-order scheme with an explicit entrainment layer, is used for the parameterization of boundary layer physics.\n\nOperational analysis from the ECMWF at 91 model levels and 0.125° horizontal resolution is used to initialize and force the model at its boundaries every 6 h.\n\nThe extent of the ever-retreating edges of the ice caps in Iceland is too large in the standard 24-category U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) land-use dataset compared to reality. An updated version of the 24-category USGS land-use dataset with more realistic ice cap extents provided by the Institute for Meteorological Research (Reiknistofa í Veðurfræði/Belgingur) is therefore used in the simulations of this study (Rögnvaldsson et al. 2007).\n\nFour-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA)\n\nThe FDDA technique has been described and employed in several studies (e.g., Anthes 1974; Stauffer and Seaman 1990, 1994; Schroeder et al. 2006). Various datasets from a range of atmospheric measurement platforms have been assimilated using FDDA, both for local and regional hindcasting, nowcasting, and forecasting applications. However, to the knowledge of the authors, data from UASs have never before been used for these purposes.\n\nThere are two main types of nudging available in the WRF FDDA system (Liu et al. 2005). One is the analysis nudging where the model state is nudged toward a gridded analysis field, which is often used at larger scales for coarse grid resolutions. The second is the observation nudging, which is used in this study. In observation nudging, each observation is used to nudge the model within a certain horizontal radius surrounding its location and within a given time window. The nudging is controlled by the nudging term, being proportional to the difference between the observed and simulated atmospheric state. The nudging is reduced as the distance in time and space from the observation to the model grid point increases. The parameters being nudged are the horizontal wind components u and υ, the specific humidity, and the temperature.\n\nThe nudging’s influence in time is limited to 40 min before and after each observation, with the strength of the nudging being ramped down toward the beginning and end of each time interval.\n\nThe strength of the nudging is controlled through the nudging coefficients G. The horizontal radius of influence R determines the size of the area that is directly affected by the nudging. Studies have shown that the values of G and R can be important for the data assimilation results (e.g., Xu et al. 2002). In this study, several FDDA sensitivity experiments are carried out and validated against AWS observations with the aim to find the optimal combination of these two parameters. The values tested for G are the default 6 × 10−4 s−1 in addition to 3 × 10−4 s−1 and 12 × 10−4 s−1. The parameter R is given the value 100 km, which covers approximately the innermost domain, and thus the area of main interest, as well as 50 and 150 km. In each of the simulations, the same values for G and R are used for all the nudged parameters and nested domains. In these experiments, all 17 UAS soundings from case 1 (19 July) and all 11 UAS soundings from case 2 (20 July) are used for assimilation. Both the mass fields (temperature and humidity) and the horizontal wind fields are assimilated.\n\nTable 2 gives an overview over the values of R and G used for the corresponding FDDA sensitivity experiments.\n\nA third factor, that influences the nudging, is the weighting function used to apply the nudging. Changing this is not as straightforward as changing the R and G parameters and is therefore left to a future study.\n\nThe results from the FDDA sensitivity experiments with different values of R and G are presented in the first part of the results section in this article. The best combination of R and G is defined as the one giving the best validation against AWS data. In the second part of the results section, a CTRL setup using no data assimilation is compared against four different FDDA setups using the best combination of R and G. In the FDDA-all setup, all UAS soundings are assimilated. In the FDDA-nomass and FDDA-nowind setups, the mass fields and wind fields, respectively, are left out of the assimilation. These latter experiments are performed to evaluate the relative importance of assimilating the wind and mass parameters for the case studies. In the FDDA-single setup, both the mass and the wind fields are assimilated, but only the first sounding in each case is used. This latter experiment is included to evaluate how long lasting the impact of assimilating a single profile is and can be considered a dynamical initialization.\n\nNo observations from the AWSs are used for assimilation in any of the FDDA simulations.\n\n5. Discussion\n\nIn this study, it has been shown how profile data from a small UAS can be used for assimilation through the FDDA technique to improve high-resolution numerical simulations. The method has been applied to two summertime fair-weather situations that took place in southwest Iceland during the Moso field campaign on 19 and 20 July 2009.\n\nThe simulated near-surface flow compares generally well against observations from a relatively dense network of AWSs. Aloft, however, with exception to the 1200 UTC Keflavik radiosoundings, which compare well with the model (not shown), only the soundings made with the UAS were available for validation. It is therefore hard to estimate the validity of the impact of the assimilation on the flow field aloft. Similar future studies can definitely benefit from more soundings of this kind, both for validation and also for assimilation.\n\nPrevious studies (e.g., Xu et al. 2002) have shown that the choice of nudging coefficients and radius of influence can have an important effect on the FDDA data assimilation result. Thus, as a first step in this study, several FDDA sensitivity experiments were carried out using different combinations of the two parameters. The results reveal only a marginal sensitivity to the choice of these parameters for our case studies and for any of the tested combinations of the parameters the results are markedly better than when using no FDDA at all. The default nudging coefficient of 6 × 10−4 s−1 and a radius of influence of 100 km, covering the area of interest, were therefore used for the rest of the study. These results are likely case dependent and more experiments with differing radii of influence for different domains and differing nudging coefficients for different parameters could prove beneficial, but are left for a future study.\n\nThe impact of the data assimilation on the model’s representation of the sea-breeze circulation, which dominated the weather of southwestern Iceland during both studied situations, is large and positive, but it differs between the two investigated cases. In case 1, the assimilation leads to a sea breeze that penetrates farther inland and the sea breeze also has a sharper front. Away from the coast, farther inland, the assimilation of the UAS data gives a local enhancement of the synoptic-scale flow, opposing the sea breeze. The correctness of this latter flow enhancement is confirmed by two AWSs (Arnes and Mork) in the area. The sharpening of the sea-breeze front associated with increased speed of the sea breeze and stronger opposing winds is consistent with the findings of Gahmberg et al. (2010) on sea breeze and its relationships to synoptic flow. In case 2, on the other hand, the assimilation of the UAS data leads to a sea breeze that is weaker and that penetrates shorter inland.\n\nInterestingly, the improvement seen when only assimilating the first profiles in each case (FDDA-single) is significantly larger and more long lasting in case 1 than in case 2. A possible explanation for this might be found in the differing synoptic conditions. Both cases had a northeasterly large-scale flow, but in case 2 it was stronger, which could potentially eradicate the impact of the assimilation faster than what is the case with the weaker flow in case 1.\n\nA detailed physical interpretation of the FDDA simulation results is made difficult by the fact that the FDDA technique is based on terms in the prognostic model equations that are strictly speaking nonphysical. However, the impacts of the nudging coefficients are related to time scales of true physical processes and they should ideally be determined based on location and flow-dependent investigations. Nevertheless, the locally enhanced flow to the north of the investigated area in case 1 can be mainly attributed to a modification of the southwest Iceland thermal low, which is induced by higher boundary layer temperatures through the data assimilation. No such increase in wind speeds is seen when the UAS temperature data are left out of the assimilation.\n\nVastly underestimated surface temperatures are found in the vicinity of Reykjavik (e.g., up to 8 K in Reykjavik) in the simulation of case 1 without data assimilation. This underestimation is caused by a fog that resides in the area for most of 19 July (see Figs. 7 and 8). All FDDA-simulations aid in removing this erroneous fog, with the effect of assimilating the mass data being the largest. The fog may be removed through at least two processes: the higher boundary layer temperatures induced by assimilating the UAS temperature data may evaporate the fog and the enhanced northerly flow to the north of Reykjavik (due to lower surface pressure over southwest Iceland) may transport the fog away. This northerly flow is also warmer than the air it replaces.\n\nIn both case studies, particularly large underestimations of the 2-m temperatures are found inland at the locations of Skalholt and Kalfholl. A detailed comparison of the USGS land-use dataset and official maps of the area reveals that the land use contains too large water bodies or a too high a percentage of wetlands. The two mentioned stations are actually situated over water bodies in the model, while in reality they are only close to these. An additional simulation of case 1 in which all inland water bodies in the south of Iceland were removed yielded a temperature increase of some 2–4 K at the aforementioned stations during daytime, even giving an overestimated temperature at some instances using an FDDA-all setup. The effect of this land-use modification was, however, very local and its impact on the general flow field was negligible. This nevertheless underlines the sensitivity of the local boundary layer temperatures to the underlying surface. This may seem obvious, but ever since the publication of Einarsson (1971), there has been consensus that temperatures in Iceland are governed by synoptic-scale advection and not local heat fluxes. Thus, future simulations of the local weather in the area could most likely benefit from a new and updated land-use dataset. Implementing such a dataset would, however, be a study in its own right and is therefore considered beyond the scope of the present study.\n\nA clear advantage of the UAS system over for example AWSs is that it provides observations not only from near the surface, but also from an atmospheric column farther aloft. Thereby, one can avoid several issues connected to the assimilation of only surface temperature observations, which are known to be especially problematic (e.g., Reen and Stauffer 2010). One such issue is connected to the surface heat flux, as its sign can change if the surface temperature is slightly increased by nudging the model toward observed surface temperatures. Such a switch in sign may lead to a drastic reduction in the boundary layer height. It is also well known that the assimilation of surface temperature observations can lead to an erroneous spread of temperatures not representative for the whole vertical extension of the ABL, as in the presence of a strongly stably stratified surface layer during nighttime or a superadiabatic surface layer during daytime (e.g., Stauffer and Seaman 1990). Solutions of various degrees of complication to these problems have been proposed. The switch in the surface heat flux can be avoided by also nudging the soil temperature (e.g., Reen and Stauffer 2010) and by making adjustments to the surface sensible and latent heat fluxes (Alapaty et al. 2001). Nudging a shallower layer when there are inversions and the whole ABL during events of free convection can mitigate the problem connected to strong temperature gradients near the surface. Nevertheless, these techniques are not optimal solutions and frequent profile observations as those provided by the UAS SUMO have the potential of avoiding the need to use them.\n\nThe inland penetration of the two investigated sea breezes was in this study deduced by manually investigating the AWS observations and corresponding model point estimations and horizontal fields. Future studies, including more cases and experiments, could benefit from a more statistical approach, as the objective technique proposed by Case et al. (2004).\n\nThe presented combination of WRF-FDDA and data acquired with a UAS is not limited to sea-breeze studies, but is likely to have a wide range of future applications. One example application in which one needs accurate high-resolution simulations and observations is investigations of flow in connection to existing and future wind farms. A related system is already proposed by Liu et al. (2011), where observations are combined with very high-resolution LES simulations using FDDA. The UAS SUMO would be an ideal tool for the verification and provision of atmospheric data for assimilation in such a system. SUMO has already been utilized to measure atmospheric turbulence in and around a small wind farm in Denmark, during spring 2011, as an integral part of the joint research project Autonomous Aerial Sensors for Wind Power Meteorology (Giebel et al. 2012; Reuder et al. 2012b).\n\nAnother potential future application for the SUMO-WRF-FDDA system is weather nowcasts or forecasts for search and rescue (SAR) missions, as proposed by Rögnvaldsson (2011). Such missions depend critically on accurate weather information, both as the safety of the field personnel must be secured and as the missions must be run as efficiently as possible. Rescue missions often take place in remote areas or regions severely affected by natural catastrophes. For the provision of in situ meteorological data from the affected area, UAS represents a unique tool that can provide in situ data from such regions where conventional instrument platforms may not be applicable and manned flights too dangerous. An example of another modeling system for emergency response applications is that by Warner et al. (2004)."
