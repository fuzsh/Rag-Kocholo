        "text": "Purdue University in West Lafayette\n\nUnmanned aircraft, or drones, are being utilized in science, agriculture, military and insurance. Drone uses range from product delivery to emergency rescue. Companies need drone experts to help them understand policies, regulations and flight paths.\n\nThe UAS major examines the entire unmanned aerial system, including operations, design, policy, sensors and commerce. Students learn how various drone aircraft are built and fit into the aviation system, including safety rules and regulations.\n\nThe Purdue Polytechnic Institute is one of 10 academic colleges at Purdue University. The Polytechnic specializes in team-based labs where you’ll test ideas, take things apart and put them back together — only better. You’ll learn side-by-side with professors who have worked in the industry and thrive on combining theory, imagination and real-world application. In this innovative environment, you'll learn by doing - gaining deep technical knowledge and applied skills in your chosen discipline coupled with problem-solving, critical-thinking, communication and leadership skills employers desire."
