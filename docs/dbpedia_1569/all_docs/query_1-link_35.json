Due to its versatile use in many industries, the GIS certificate is open to all disciplines that use geospatial data to manage workflows, processes, policies, and high-level decision-making.\n\nStudents in this certification program will learn the most common GIS and remote sensing workflows to generate, process and apply geospatial data via in-depth, hands-on experiences using state-of-the-art GIS software. Emphasis is placed on the practical aspects of working with a GIS using easy-to-understand, step-by-step tutorials and instructor demonstrations.\n\nStudents who successfully complete the GIS and remote sensing certificate will have the necessary skills to compete and work in the field of GIS and remote sensing in both the public and private sectors. Moreover, GIS and remote sensing skills earned through this certificate are useful in supporting capstone projects, master theses and can provide students with a robust foundation to engage in a research career.\n\nCertification Requirements\n\nTo obtain the proposed GIS and Remote Sensing Certificate (a total of 12 CH), students will be required to take the following 4, 3-CH GEO courses:\n\nGEO 210Introduction to Geographic Information Systems3 GEO 310Advanced Geographic Information Systems3 GEO 350Introduction to Remote Sensing with GIS3 GEO 450Lidar Processing with GIS3\n\nThe GEO courses in the GIS and Remote Sensing Certificate should be taken in the order outlined above, but it is not necessary, except for GEO 210 which is a course prerequisite for GEO 310, GEO 350 and GEO 495. The content of study in each GEO course participating in this certificate is described in each GEO course already offered."
