        "meta_description": "Drones, also known as unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), have revolutionised various industries, from farming to national security. (Wexler., Lesley. 2016) However, their broad use has revealed a severe weakness in cybersecurity. (Jean-Paul Yaacoub 2020) The urgent necessity to defend UAV networks from new cyber threats is explored in-depth in this research, making it a crucial subject for both technological development and national security. The two essential areas of our study are assault simulation and threat analysis in cybersecurity. This work demonstrates how easy it is to hack a drone mid-flight using only a Raspberry Pi3 and open-source online tools. This work illustrates the ability to penetrate a DJI drone currently used by the mercenary soldiers in the Ukraine war. (Greg Myre March, 2023) This research examines strategies used to attack UAV networks, such as the de-authentic attack and the man-in-the-middle attack. This work investigates the weaknesses in these networks' sophisticated attack simulations with a Raspberry PI 3 and the Alpha network adaptor from Amazon, showing that basic tools are needed to perform cyberattacks on drones. This research proposes creative solutions and preventative methods for protecting UAV operations and highlights the seriousness of the problem. As drones become more prevalent daily, maintaining their security becomes crucial. This work provides a compelling perspective on protecting vital infrastructure and preserving our skies by bridging the gap between the latest technologies and cybersecurity.",
