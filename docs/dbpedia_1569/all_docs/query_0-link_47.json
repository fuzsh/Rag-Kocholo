We contribute a UAV system which is able to autonomously plan a path, navigate, acquire views of an object in the environment from which a model is built. The UAV does collision checking of the path and navigates only to those areas deemed safe. The data acquired is sent to a registration system which segments out the object of interest and fuses the data. We also show a qualitative comparison of our results with previous work.",
