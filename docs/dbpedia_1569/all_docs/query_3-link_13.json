        "meta_description": "National airspace, the management for access and operation of these vehicles is required. This management is being developed under the unmanned aircraft system traffic management system (UTM) program. To determine the aerodynamic characteristics of drones, wind tunnel experiments and computation fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis have been conducted. These experiments and analyses are undertaken to understand the flight capabilities of these vehicles in variable head and cross wind conditions. The results of these investigations will provide metrics for the safe operation of these vehicles in and around civil populations and in urban settings. The focus of this paper is to model a drone installed in a wind tunnel for varying pitch attitudes and rotor rpm settings. Specifically, the IRIS drone is modeled in the NASA-Ames 7x10 ft. W/T. The tunnel mounting hardware and the tunnel enclosure are modeled with the IRIS drone geometry. The rotors of the drone are modeled using two methodologies: a rotor disk model and individual blade representations. The results of the analysis are compared with available experimental data to validate the computational approach.",
