        "text": "Numerous churches in Burlington County will ring in the 350th anniversary of New Jersey’s founding Tuesday.\n\nThe churches will join houses of worship statewide in commemorating the milestone by ringing their bells for a minute at noon.\n\nThe date marks the 350th anniversary of the signing of a 1664 land grant when English noblemen John Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret were awarded the property between the Delaware and Hudson rivers by King Charles II and his brother, James, the Duke of York.\n\nThe land later was named New Jersey in honor of Carteret’s ancestral British home, the Isle of Jersey.\n\nFollowing are some of the churches that have indicated they will participate in the ceremonial bell sounding:\n\nBeverly:\n\nSt. Stephen’s Episcopal Church, Warren Street\n\nBordentown City:\n\nSt. Mary Church, Crosswicks Street\n\nBurlington City:\n\nSt. Mary’s Episcopal Church, West Broad Street\n\nBurlington Township:\n\nAssemblies of God New Jersey, Columbus Road\n\nCinnaminson:\n\nSt. Paul Baptist Church, Bannard Street\n\nDelanco:\n\nDobbins Memorial United Methodist Church, Union Avenue\n\nDelran:\n\nDelran United Methodist Church, Conrow Road\n\nEdgewater Park:\n\nBeverly Presbyterian Church, Warren Street\n\nFieldsboro:\n\nFieldsboro United Methodist Church, Second Street\n\nMoorestown:\n\nFirst Presbyterian Church of Moorestown, Bridgeboro Road; Our Lady of Good Counsel Church, West Main Street; Trinity Episcopal Church, West Main Street\n\nMount Laurel:\n\nSt. John Neumann Church, Walton Avenue\n\nPalmyra:\n\nCentral Baptist Church, East Maple Avenue\n\nRiverside:\n\nZion Lutheran Church, Fairview Street and Pavilion Avenue\n\nRiverton:\n\nCalvary Presbyterian Church, Fourth Street; Christ Episcopal Church, Main Street; Sacred Heart Church, Thomas Avenue\n\nWillingboro:\n\nSt. Paul United Methodist Church, Levitt Parkway\n\nSen. Diane Allen, R-7th of Edgewater Park, said she was pleased so many county churches were choosing to participate in the ceremony.\n\n“It’s appropriate that we join together in commemorating the history of this great state,” Allen said in a statement. “The bells tolling on Tuesday will be a reminder of New Jersey’s unique history and how the events 350 years ago forever shaped this state and nation, and, in turn, each of us.”\n\nIn addition to the bells, Allen and other members of the Senate welcomed Alan Simon Crowcroft, a representative from the Isle of Jersey, to the Statehouse in Trenton on Monday, and the chamber passed a resolution celebrating the ties between New Jersey and its original namesake."
