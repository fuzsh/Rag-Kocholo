        "text": "Four hundred years have passed and New Jersey has had several \"owners\". Henry IV of France, Henry VII & James I of England, The Dutch of 1623, Swedes of 1637 and Charles II of England in 1663.\n\nJune 24, 1664 Duke of York, brother of Charles II of England, gave a large land grant to Lord Berkley & Sir George Carteret who were unsuccessful at colonization. Lord Berkley conveyed his portion to John Fenwick for 1000 pounds sterling and a royalty of 40 beaver skins annually. This led to a bitter controversy.\n\nWilliam Penn was chosen as arbitrator. On July 1, 1676 Penn divided the state in 1/2 from north to south, giving Sir George Carteret the eastern portion. The divisions were given the names of East and West New Jersey respectively. Penn sold off the western portion. The proprietors of the western grant formed a constitution. One of the major purchasers of this grant was Thomas Budd, Kenny's 6 great grandfather William's, brother. Thomas and William were grandsons of John Budd, the Earl of Berkshire.\n\nReverand Thomas Budd III, b 1617 in Banstead, Surrey, England was a rector of the Parish of Martock, Somersetshire, England. He was a minister of the Friends. In 1661 he was arrested, convicted and imprisoned for refusing to take the oath of obedience as ordered by King James I. Thomas stayed imprisoned until his death in 1670.\n\nThomas IV, a Quaker, had arrived in New Jersey around 1668 seeking personal and religious freedom from the grip of the English rule. He found the land promising. He returned to Somersetshire England and in 1678 arrived back with his siblings, William, John, James, Ann & Suzanna. They departed the ship \"Kent\" while docked in Bridlington (now Burlington). Thomas continued his travels and was involved in purchasing and settling several parcels in West Jersey, Philadelphia and Delaware.\n\nThomas was the author of a book titled, \"Good Order Established in Pennsylvania and New Jersey\" dated 1685.\n\nWilliam Budd, b 1649, Kenny's 6 great grandfather, a younger sibling of Thomas, migrated to the Mt. Holly - Pemberton - Springfield - Eastampton - Westampton & Southampton area and obtained several thousand acres of uninhabited land. Upon his death on March 25, 1722, buried at St. Marys Cemetary, Burlington, NJ, along with his wife Ann Clapgut Budd d. September 30, 1722, his son William inherited his fathers land and the love of domestic and home life. William II is Kenny's 5 great grandfather.\n\nWilliam II son, David, was one of the original planners for New Mills (later named Pemberton). David's brother Thomas IV is Kenny's 4 great grandfather.\n\nThomas' son Isaac farmed in Southampton and established Buddtown. Isaac's brother Stacy W., Kenny's 3 great grandfather farmed the Budd ground in Pemberton and Southampton. Stacy's son George W, Kenny's great grandfather, started a milk bottling company on the farm in Pemberton. His products were sold on a horse drawn ice cooled wagon in the Pemberton - Browns Mills - Mt. Holly area. His son, Kenny's grandfather, George Harold, enjoyed farming as well as commercial ventures including a gas station, a hardware store and several homes.\n\nToday we grow a large variety of vegetables the old fashioned way. We use only natural green and animal manure. The vegetables are hand hoed with no chemical input.\n\nWe have an \"Old Fashion Country Store\" on the farm selling homegrown and local seasonal produce and a large variety of fruits and vegetables not native to New Jersey. We offer dairy products. Jersey Fresh honey is available all year. We stock groceries, frozen food items, sundries, paper goods, household items, beverages including the entire line of Stewart's sodas, snack items, bread and rolls, candy, miscellaneous auto supplies and tobacco products.\n\nWe carry \"Jersey Fresh\" Seafood, clams from local clammers & live crabs when available from local crabbers. We also carry a line of frozen seafood. All of our prices are hard to beat.\n\nWe have seasonal bedding plants and flowers including Easter and Mother's Day flowers. Our Pet Food Department includes treats, pet supplies and a full line of Nutro Max pet foods at discounted prices.\n\nIn the changing times, in order to keep the farm profitable, we've expanded our menu for the Country Kitchen. The Country Kitchen offers a large variety of take-out foods at reasonable prices. If you are hungry for an old fashion half pound homemade beef or turkey burger, an original Italian hoagie or seafood combination dinner box, the County Kitchen is the place for you. In season, our garden salads are made from our homegrown produce. Potato and macaroni salads and cole slaw are made fresh daily here at the farm. Baked goods are made from scratch using no added preservatives, from our Grandmom's recipes."
