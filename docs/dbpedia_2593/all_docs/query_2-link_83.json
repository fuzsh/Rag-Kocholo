Lewis\n\nThe location of Carteret on the Atlantic coast of North Carolina accounts for the beginning of its history at an early date. Old Topsail and Ocracoke Inlets are famous in the early history of North Carolina as gateways to the mainland and both of these inlets are passages to Carteret. These inlets offered harbors to vessels during stormy weather and proved excellent gates of entrance to the mainland. These are some of the reasons why the earliest explorers visited Carteret and why some of the earliest settlers came there.\n\nEarly Explorations\n\nIn 1524, Giovanni Davenazzano, a Florentine navigator in the service of France, visited the Cape Fear region, remained there a few days and then turned northward to explore the coast. He made stops at every opening or inlet, touching Carteret first at Old Topsail inlet, then at Ocracoke Inlet. Giovanni and his crew were probably the first white men to visit Carteret.\n\nPhilip Amadas and Arthur Barlow set out in 1854 to explore the coast of the new world for Sir Walter Raleigh. After sailing sixty-seven days they arrived at Roanoke Island. From Roanoke they explored the coast southward for six weeks, stopping on the mainland and islands where they found Indians friendly and food in abundance. These explorers reported to Raleigh the names of the territory as given by the Indians. “The Indian name of the Albemarle Sound was Occam, and into it flowed a river called Nomopana, and near the mouth of this river was a town called Chowanook, and the name of the king thereof was Pooneno. The Pamlico shores of the county of Carteret were called Secotan, and those of Craven, Pomonick. Secotan was under the king of Wingandaceo, and Pomonick under an independent king named Piamacum. In the interior, toward the setting sun, the country was called Newsiok, and through it coursed the river Neus.” Barlow's account of a visit to the Island of Wingandacoa, which was somewhere within Ocracoke Inlet and in Core Sound near the mainland called Secotan, is given by Ashe in his History of North Carolina. This island was probably Cedar Island or one of the islands near it.\n\nAfter Barlow and Amadas reported a favorable trip to Queen Elizabeth, Raleigh secured a charter to send a colony to the new world. Ralph Lane was placed in charge of this colony of one hundred and eight men. They left England in seven ships in 1585 and were one month and twelve days in reaching the country later called Carolina. Three days later they narrowly escaped being wrecked on a beach which they called Cape of Fear. After three more days the colony reached Wocokon, a part of the North Carolina banks now known as Ocracoke. The colony spent the next month in exploring the mainland and islands of Core Sound and Pamlico Sound. This was the third expedition from the Old World which stopped at Carteret. At the end of a month the colony moved up to Hatteras and to Roanoke Island where they started the first English colony in America. Lane left for England in order to get supplies. When he returned in 1590 he found his colony gone and only the word Croatan carved on a tree to indicate their whereabouts. A legend still further connects this colony with the history of Carteret. Tradition says that this colony became mixed with the Indians by intermarriage, that some years later Indians in the locality of Carteret and adjoining counties told of parents with blue eyes and said that they could read out of books. The family names of many of the people in Carteret correspond to those given for Lane's Colony according to Hawks’ History of North Carolina. Some of these names are: White, Baily, Stevens, Howe, Johnson, Willes, Smith, Brown, Little, Taylor, Lucas, Berry, Butler, Wright, Chapman, Harris, Martin, Jones.\n\nThe next white men to visit Carteret, in 1652, were settlers from Virginia. Roger Green, a clergyman from Nansemond County, Virginia, played an active part in bringing settlers south of the Chowan river. This section includes Carteret County. In 1654 Francis Yeardley, a son of Governor Yeardley of Virginia, was sent on an expedition to explore the region which now includes the counties of Currituck, Camden, Pasquotank, Perquimans, Bertie, Washington, Tyrrel, Dare, Hyde, Beaufort, Pamlico, Craven, Carteret and Onslow. During the same year the Governor of Virginia reported, “Small sloops owned by Virginia settlers are employed in visiting the sounds of Carolina for the purpose of hunting and trading with the Indians.” These small vessels carried back much game and valuable products of trade made with the Indians as well as wonderful reports of the country visited. This news spread among the settlers in Virginia and caused those people to wish to move to the new region to the south because lands there\n\nwere free from quit rents. In 1656 the Virginia Assembly commissioned Thomas Dew and Thomas Francis to explore the coast between Cape Hatteras and Cape Fear and these men also visited Carteret. Settlers from Virginia were gradually spreading southward to the section known as Albemarle. In 1663 Charles the Second of Great Britain granted the land known as “Carolina” and part of Georgia to the eight Lords Proprietors. Among these proprietors was Sir George Carteret, and after his death in 1679 his son with three other proprietors bought Sir William Berkley's share of Carolina for three hundred pounds. At this time Albemarle was the only section settled by white men, but these settlers were looking for more land, better land, and cheaper land and continued to move slowly southward along the coast. Massachusetts and Pennsylvania had also sent out trading and exploring vessels to the shores of Carolina, and by the year 1650 the people of New England were beginning to migrate southward to Albemarle and counties along the coast. In 1669 the Proprietors decided to divide Albemarle into four precincts named Carteret, Berkley, Shaftesbury and Albemarle—this was a part of the Grand Model of the Proprietors. It did not meet with success as the thinly settled precincts, such as Carteret, objected to the rent on land being paid in silver rather than provisions. Peter Carteret, a relative of Sir George Carteret, was governor of the province at this time and the dissatisfaction increased to such an extent that he abandoned the colony and went back to England in 1673. By 1688 settlers from Albemarle had spread southward along the coast as far as the Cape Fear settlement.\n\nTerritorial Beginnings\n\nIn 1696 Bath County was separated from Albemarle, and Carteret by this division was in Bath County, Archdale Precinct. Bath County extended from Albemarle Sound down to the undivided limits of the province and when Carteret Precinct was established some years later, it included the entire unsettled region embracing the Cape Fear and down to the South Carolina line. The settlements in the region about Carteret were not growing rapidly because of trouble with the Indians. The northern part of the county around Cedar Island was most thickly settled. These first settlers were French Hugenots from Virginia. In 1710 De Graffenreid and Lawson brought a colony of Swiss and Germans who settled along the banks of the Neuse. Most of them remained around that vicinity but some of them, looking for more room and better land,\n\nmoved over to the Core Sound region. Carteret was now increasing in population. In 1712 the Core and Tuscarora Indians staged their last war on the whites in Carteret. They destroyed much property and many lives. Among those who lost their lives was John Lawson, the earliest historian of the state. Colonel Moore in 1712 closed the war by marching into Carteret and completely subduing the savages in a battle near the present town of Beaufort. In the same year a fort was built on Core Sound to protect the inhabitants. It was named in honor of Governor Hyde. After the Indian war was over settlers came more rapidly to the territory around Core Sound and North River. Most of these settlers came from the Berne colony, others came from Virginia, Albemarle and New England. In October, 1713, the town of Beaufort was laid out into lots which were sold to purchasers. In the following February tracts of land on Bogue Sound were taken up. Also in the same year a grant of land was issued to John Porter reaching from Drum Inlet to Topsail Inlet, which tract included Port Lookout. The Lords Proprietors allowed Governor Hyde to issue patents for land, not to exceed six hundred and forty acres in a body, requiring a cash payment of twenty shillings for every hundred acres and an annual rent of one shilling. These terms applied only to Bath territory as Albemarle was held under the reat Deed.\n\nThe Indian troubles were scarcely over when privateering became a menace to the settlers along the Carolina coast. The pirate most familiar in North Carolina history is Teach, better known as “Blackbeard.” He used Core Sound as a place to hide when he was being chased on the Atlantic, and all the harbors of Pamlico Sound were known to him. His ship, the Adventurer, was captured on November 22, 1718, by Lieutenant Mayard near Ocracoke Inlet. “Teach's Hole” is still pointed out by pilots on Pamlico Sound.\n\nThe Council established Carteret Precinct in 1722, including all the settlements in that direction and the town of Beaufort was incorporated into a seaport entitled to a collector of customs. A road was ordered opened from Core Point to New Bern. The following year it was decided that growth of this part of the province was being retarded for lack of commercial facilities. To improve this condition a navigation act was passed to encourage a settlement on Ocracoke Inlet because of the good harbor at this place. In 1729 the first Assembly was called together after Carteret was obtained by the English Crown. At this Assembly Carteret had two members\n\nand in 1733 it still had only two members. Gabriel Johnson was the royal governor of the province.\n\nSome Early Land Grants\n\nFrom 1735 to 1750 a great many land grants were issued by the King's Council for lands in Carteret County or Precinct. In the following list of grants familiar Carteret County names are recognized.\n\nPetitions granted in 1735:\n\nThomas Lovick and Francis Thornton, 640 acres.\n\nArthur Mabson, 640 acres.\n\nJoseph Morgan, 640 acres.\n\nPetitions granted in 1736:\n\nJohn Webster, 208 acres.\n\nNic Bryant, 327 acres.\n\nGeorge Cummins, 400 acres\n\nJohn Starkley, 400 acres.\n\nCarry Godbee, 200 acres.\n\nDavid Sheppard, 100 acres.\n\nPetitions granted in 1737:\n\nTheopelos Norwood, 640 acres.\n\nBryant McCullin, 500 acres.\n\nAnthony Cox, 300 acres.\n\nDavid Turner, 200 acres.\n\nCharles Cogdale, 422 acres.\n\nPetitions granted in 1738:\n\nJohn Webster, 140 acres.\n\nJohn Dudley, 270 acres.\n\nRichard Lovit, 100 acres.\n\nJohn Shaw, 640 acres.\n\nPetitions ganted in 1739:\n\nJoseph Sessums, 268 acres.\n\nJoseph Calvert, 292 acres.\n\nBradberry Cook, 100 acres.\n\nSam Noble, 320 acres\n\nMoses Houston, 300 acres.\n\nJohn Small, 300 acres.\n\nNevil Bell, 200 acres.\n\nWilliam Shackleford, 500 acres.\n\nPetitions granted in 1740:\n\nThomas Lovick, 400 acres.\n\nWilliam Houston, 300 acres.\n\nJohn Roberts, 400 acres.\n\nFrancis Allways, 300 acres.\n\nJoseph Bale, 100 acres.\n\nMichiel Pasquornett, 400 acres.\n\nJohn Hodgson, 350 acres.\n\nDavid Shepard, 100 acres.\n\nPetitions granted in 1741:\n\nFrank Brice.\n\nJoseph Noble, 500 acres.\n\nHenry Stanton, 480 acres.\n\nJames Salter, 200 acres.\n\nPetitions granted in 1742:\n\nJohn Webster, 250 acres.\n\nStephen Lee, 200 acres.\n\nJohn Shackleford, 640 acres.\n\nNicholas Hunter, 200 acres.\n\nPetitions granted in 1743:\n\nGeorge Bell, Jr., 200 acres.\n\nDavid Bailey, 300 acres.\n\nJames Yeats, 200 acres.\n\nCharles Cogdale, 100 acres.\n\nJames Winwright, 375 acres.\n\nThomas Morton, 200 acres.\n\nGeorge Read, 300 acres.\n\nNath Martin, 275 acres.\n\nPeter Barton, 100 acres.\n\nBenjamine Weeks, 200 acres.\n\nSam Chadwick, 175 acres.\n\nJonathan Bangs, 48 acres.\n\nJohnson Simpson, 480 acres.\n\nPetitions granted in 1744:\n\nThomas Lewis, 100 acres.\n\nMoses Houston, 300 acres.\n\nThomas Nelson, 300 acres.\n\nWilliam Coles, 200 acres.\n\nGeorge Styring, 100 acres.\n\nPetitions granted in 1745:\n\nJohn Saunders, 300 acres.\n\nNevil Bell, 200 acres.\n\nJames Johnson, 200 acres.\n\nLancaster Lovick, 200 acres.\n\nValent Wallace, Sr., 150 acres.\n\nWilliam Frazier, 100 acres.\n\nNathaniel Smith, 300 acres.\n\nPetitions granted in 1746:\n\nWilliam Salter, 200 acres.\n\nPeter Baston, 100 acres.\n\nPetitions granted in 1747:\n\nJohn Willison, 200 acres.\n\nJohn Lipton, 200 acres.\n\nValentine Wallace, 100 acres.\n\nJohn Hicks, 100 acres.\n\nThomas Nelson, 200 acres.\n\nPetitions granted in 1748:\n\nNathan Smith, 400 acres.\n\nThomas Nelson, 640 acres.\n\nGeorge Bell, 200 acres.\n\nGeorge Cogdale, 200 acres.\n\nThomas Dudley, 400 acres.\n\nJohn Nelson, 156 acres.\n\nRobert Savage, 300 acres.\n\nGeorge McKeen, 250 acres.\n\nJames Johnson, 200 acres.\n\nWilliam Whitehurst, 350 acres.\n\nThomas Lewis, 100 acres.\n\nPetitions granted in 1749:\n\nSamuel Negus, 100 acres.\n\nSamuel Smith, Cedar Island.\n\nHabakuck Russel, 50 acres.\n\nJoseph Roads, 100 acres.\n\nPetitions granted in 1750:\n\nDavid Hecks, 50 acres.\n\nWestern Williams, 300 acres.\n\nThomas Chadwick, 40 acres.\n\nAndrew Bet, 50 acres.\n\nChurch Bell, 400 acres.\n\nSeth Robens and Isaac Scrivers, 400 acres.\n\nJobeth Weeks, 100 acres.\n\nThomas Matchett, 100 acres.\n\nJohn Anderson, 100 acres.\n\nJohn Williams, 200 acres.\n\nPetitions granted in 1751:\n\nJohn Gillet, 250 acres.\n\nLancelot Lovett, 200 acres.\n\nLewis Trott, 200 acres.\n\nBy 1757 land grants in Carteret had reached 47,617 acres. The above list of grants given may not be entirely correct but it gives some idea of the families first taking up land in Carteret.\n\nCarteret was divided into four districts in 1745 as follows: (1). Northeastern Part of Newport River. (2). Southeastern Part of Newport River. (3). From Beaufort Township to Core Creek Bridge. (4). From County Courthouse at Beaufort to North River and Extreme East. This was for convenience in building and repairing roads and bridges. Thomas Baker was appointed treasurer of Carteret and several other eastern counties.\n\nThe Spaniards\n\nIn 1741 several Spanish Privateers took possession of Ocracoke Inlet and seized the vessels arriving there. They also landed and carried off the cattle of the inhabitants. Eventually they were driven away but their depredations were so great that provisions\n\nhad to be supplied to the distressed people at a cost to the province of more than ten thousand pounds. Again in 1744 they boldly entered the harbor of Beaufort. Major Enoch Ward hastily gathered some militia and held them at bay until August 26, when they succeeded in gaining possession of the town itself. In a few days, however, Colonel Thomas Lovick and Captain Charles Cogdell came to the rescue with a sufficient force, and early in September the Spaniards were expelled, suffering considerable loss. Later in 1753 Gov. Dobbs recommended that another fort be built near Ocracoke Inlet and the town of Portsmouth laid out. This Fort was called Fort Granville. Here commerce would have the protection of guns. In the same year a poll tax was levied on all taxable persons of Carteret. Some funds were necessary. Thomas Lovick with a regiment at Beaufort consisting of two companies of 195 men was collector at Beaufort in 1754, and in one of his reports he says, “No arms, no ammunition and no Indians.”\n\nIn 1755 Governor Dobbs visited Beaufort and the surrounding vicinity. This visit was made because of the unopposed raids of Spaniards on the coast of North Carolina. He found the work started on a fort on the land side of the sound, but he immediately decided that the fort should be built on Point of Bogue Island near Old Topsail Inlet. This change was made at once and the fort was called Fort Hampton. It was made of wood and kept in use, more or less, until after the war of 1812. It was replaced by the present Fort Macon.\n\nInternal Improvements\n\nFrom 1754 to about 1761 a number of bills were passed for improvements in Carteret County. An act was passed for the creation of parishes in Carteret for the promotion of the Protestant religion. An act was passed in 1754 by the King's Council to improve, mend and repair roads, bridges and water courses already laid out or thereafter laid out in Carteret. Two years later another bill was passed to change the method of work on roads and operation of ferries to more economical methods. Another act in 1762 gave the right to every freeholder in Carteret to serve on the jury. All entries for land in Carteret at this time had to be made with the Surveyor-general at Bath. In 1767 an act was passed to erect a beacon at Old Topsail Inlet and others through Core Sound—each vessel coming and going through Old Topsail Inlet must pay a toll or tax. Another act passed by the English Council was to prevent the ultimate destruction of fish in Core Sound, Bogue Sound, and Straits of Carteret. Due to the fact\n\nthat Ocracoke was not included in any county, the Governor, the Council and the Assembly included it in Carteret.\n\nReverend John Reed was pastor of Saint John's Parish in Beaufort which was located where the present Methodist church is now. He complained of trouble with the Methodists and asked for aid from the secretary of the Church of England. The settlers of Carteret at this time were so destitute that they were incapable of supporting the minister of Saint John's Parish which was the Church of England's Parish.\n\nCarteret in the Revolution\n\nWhen the call for troops came in 1771 to support the Revolutionary forces Carteret's detachment, consisting of one company, marched into New Bern from Beaufort under the command of William Thompson, Colonel; Solomon Shepard, Lieutenant Colonel; Thomas Chadwich, Major; and Malachi Bell, Second Major. In 1774 the Craven and Carteret detachment marched out of New Bern with two field pieces, six swivel guns mounted on carriages, and with supplies that would last them on their route to Hillsboro. During this year the first free and independent assembly met in New Bern. William Thompson represented Carteret County. In 1776 John Blackledge offered to Congress his salt plant to make salt during the war for eight shillings per bushel. And Robert Williams in a letter to the North Carolina Council of Safety says: “I am going to abandon the salt works till summer and tend to rice crop which is on thirty acres.” John Easton was appointed paymaster for the two independent companies commanded by Captain James Anderson and Captain Enoch Ward. One thousand pounds were put in his hands for this purpose. He was also to run a salt plant for the government at Gallant's Point. John Easton and Bryce Williams were appointed by Congress to purchase, receive and procure fire arms for the use of the troops.\n\nThe last court held in Carteret that recognized George the Third met in Beaufort the 19th of March, 1776. The next court was held in June but George the Third was not mentioned.\n\nWhen the English brigantine, William, anchored in Beaufort Harbor April 10, 1776, it was seized. On May 10, the North Carolina Provincial Congress opened negotiations with Virginia to supply two ships from that province to help guard Ocracoke Inlet. Congress was also of the opinion that the situation of Beaufort and the inlets adjacent were such that it appeared absolutely necessary that a considerable military force should be stationed near, or at that town. In 1777 British cruisers undertook to close the channel\n\nof commerce through Ocracoke Inlet. But many vessels continued to come in bringing ammunition and supplies and privateers were constantly sallying forth to prey on the British. Among these vessels were the Sturdy Beggar, the Nancy and the General Washington. In September, 1777, two English frigates appeared at Ocracoke Inlet and destroyed several ships ready to sail. Immediately the Sturdy Beggar with fourteen guns, and the Pennsylvania Farmer with sixteen guns sailed to clear the harbor. The inhabitants of Carteret now demanded that Old Topsail Inlet be fortified.\n\nJune 6, 1778, a French ship arrived at Cape Lookout with dry goods. The ship was the French frigate, Ferdinand, carrying thirty-six guns and two hundred men. Her goods were advertised for sale at Beaufort March 12, 1778. The French in this way were a great aid to the war stricken settlers.\n\nIn 1783 a tax of four pence was levied on every hundred pounds of taxable property, to go toward repairing public buildings in New Bern. The General Assembly of North Carolina also levied a tax of eight pence on every hundred acres of land and two shillings and two pence on every hundred pounds value of town lots. The money from this was to go toward clothing and housing the poor. In 1785 another act was passed to tax inhabitants of the county, the money from which was to go toward granting bounties to persons who “killed or otherwise destroyed” any wolves, bears, panthers or wildcats in Carteret County. Years before, the historian Lawson had complained of not being able to sleep on account of howling panthers and wildcats when he visited Carteret and Craven.\n\nIn 1779 a part of Carteret was annexed to Jones County. Carteret was flourishing as a trade center. The report of John Dawes, customs collector, showed that Carteret owed the state 1,896 pounds of customs collected.\n\nCarteret in the War of 1812\n\nIn the war of 1812 Carteret sent troops in the 2nd Regiment with other eastern counties. But her outstanding contribution was the noted commander, Otway Burns. He came to Carteret from Onslow, engaged in seafaring, and soon became captain of a coasting vessel plying between Beaufort and New York. When the war of 1812 commenced he obtained from the United States government letters of marque and reprisal, and built, through the aid of several wealthy persons as a stock company, a fast sailing ship called the Snap Dragon. She was fully armed and equipped with cannon, guns and men. His intimate knowledge of the Carolina coast and\n\nthe daring of a chosen crew of men soon made the name of Otway Burns a terror to all the British in American waters. He captured and destroyed a large number of English prizes and brought into Beaufort heavy cargoes of valuables. He established quite a market for the merchants of all eastern Carolina. From an observatory on the top of a high building, the old Atlantic Hotel, he used a spyglass and commanded an extensive view of the ocean. His ship was kept with a ready crew and anchor tripped. When he espied the English colors his fast vessel was soon in pursuit. In England the British Council decided that he must be captured and had a fast sailing vessel built as a merchant ship and with concealed arms. The Snap Dragon was deceived by his ruse and Burns and his crew were taken prisoners. They were released after the war.\n\nRailway Development\n\nThe coming of the Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad to the port towns of Carteret played a vital part in the history of the two towns. In 1852 the railroad received its charter—the road was to begin at Goldsboro and terminate at Beaufort at a cost of $900,000. In 1854 the town of Beaufort planned to take $100,000 worth of stock but in the following year decided to let the county take half of this amount. The Stock Company had Walter Quinn, a surveyor, measure the distance and pick out the best place for the railroad to terminate. The places picked were Gallant's point, Lenoxville, Shepard's Point and Beaufort. About this time land speculation sprung up around the vicinity of Beaufort. New Bern now tried to gain a controlling stock in the company, which it succeeded in doing, and the building of the railroad was delayed by the controersy arising over the change made in stockholders. When New Bern gained controlling stock they began to ask for contracts but in the meantime ex-Governor Morehead became interested in a tract of land known as Shepard's Point. He bought this tract of land from the Arrendell's estate and shortly afterward offered the Atlantic and North Carolina stockholders to take $100,000 of stock and build some of the road, the thirteen miles from Clumper's Creek to Shepard's Point, the cost of which he would deduct from his stock, if the stock company would build the road to Shepard's Point instead of Gallant's Point near Beaufort. The railroad company accepted the proposition and the road was started from Goldsboro to Shepard's Point. Land speculators began to buy up land in the vicinity at once, and three miles from Shepard's Point a town was laid out and named Carolina City. It was to be a resort\n\nand commercial city because of the nearby harbor and the railroad connections being made with the western part of the state. Governor Morehead began to sell his land at Shepard's Point in 1857. Lots were laid out and a town planned. His land sale on November 11, 1857, was the first public land sale to be held in Carteret, and the first day $13,000 worth of property was sold. The town was named Morehead City in honor of Governor Morehead. He planned to make his town a second New York City, believing that with the excellent location of the seacoast and with a railroad running from Asheville to this port, it would be possible to bring the products of the state here for shipment to foreign countries and to larger cities. The first train ran from Goldsboro to Morehead City on June 7, 1858. This was the beginning of the present seaside resort named in honor of its founder, Morehead City.\n\nIn 1860, just before the beginning of the Civil War, Carteret contained four hundred square miles of territory and had a population of 8,186. Then in 1861 came the secession of North Carolina and the ravages of the civil struggle which Carteret felt rather heavily.\n\nCarteret in the Civil War\n\nTroops were formed at Beaufort and the “Old Topsail Rifles” tendered to the Confederate government in May, 1861. They were assigned as Company C to the 2nd regiment at Fort Macon and were taken to a camp at Weldon for training and returned in September to Fort Macon. Another fort was hastily constructed at Ocracoke and Fort Macon was put in good condition and well garrisoned. This fort, which had taken the place of Fort Hampton in 1836, was built of the strongest masonry at a cost of $175,000. The regiments at Fort Macon were the 27th Volunteers and the 1st North Carolina Volunteers. The 7th North Carolina Regiment went to New Bern in August, 1861, and did picket duty at Bogue Island, near Fort Macon. They were later moved to Morehead City and then to Newport. In March, 1861, they went to New Bern where they were defeated by the Federals and driven back toward Kinston. Company C of the 2nd North Carolina Regiment was organized at Beaufort with 133 men including officers. Captain S. D. Pool was executive officer. They were transferred to Coast Artillery later and Captain Pool was promoted to Colonel of the 10th Regiment. Companies B, F, G and H were stationed at Fort Macon under Colonel White until its capture. The 10th Regiment did picket duty around New Bern, Wilmington, Goldsboro and Kinston\n\nuntil May, 1863. Picketing was also maintained on Shackleford's Banks and at Cape Lookout where much valuable information from the enemy was procured. A salt plant established at Morehead City was attacked and captured by the enemy just before the attack on Fort Macon. The attack upon the fort began on March 23, 1862, when General Parke of the Federals moved his forces to Carolina City, took possession of Morehead City and Beaufort, and demanded the surrender of Fort Macon. Colonel White refused. The armament of the fort was forty-four guns, fitted to defend the harbor from sea attacks but the guns were now brought to bear on the land side. Everything was prepared for a long siege. On April 11, General Parke began to land his troops on the “banks” and skirmishes took place in which the Federals were stronger. General Burnside came down to Morehead City to affect a surrender on April 24, but with no success. On April 25 an attack was made by land and also from the sea by the blockading squadron. The boats were driven off but the land guns could not do much to the Federal troops. Finally Colonel White realized that his flag would have to come down and on April 26, 1862, he surrendered the besieged fortress. The Confederate loss was seven killed and eighteen wounded. The captured garrison was paroled—some of them going inland and others to Wilmington.\n\nAfter the capture of Fort Macon, Newport was attacked and the Confederates were defeated by the 103rd New York Cavalry. The 43rd Massachusetts Infantry came through Morehead City on their way to New Bern. They were transferred to Morehead City by boats.\n\nWhen Sherman was at Goldsboro in March, 1865, getting his army in condition for further fighting, he had all his equipment and material transported from Morehead City and Wilmington over the Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad and for this purpose he had many repairs made, especially on the bridges, eleven of which had been burned between Goldsboro and Morehead City.\n\nReconstruction\n\nThe days of reconstruction began in 1868 with a majority of Carpetbaggers in the legislature. The conflict between the whites and Negroes took on a threatening aspect. As far back as 1821 there had been an insurrection of the Negroes of Carteret and one or two adjoining counties. Now the Negroes stationed at Fort Macon committed atrocities at Beaufort and even threatened to turn the guns of Fort Macon on the town if the people did not release\n\nsome Negro prisoners. Finally General Ruger forbade any Negro leaving the fort unless with a white officer. Many colored troops were organized by carpetbaggers and in their enthusiasm at having so much power they drilled all day and celebrated all night. The Freedmen's Bureau settled free Negroes on confiscated and abandoned lands and helped them in many ways to get adapted to their new condition. They even established food stations to feed them. No help was given to the white people until the yellow fever epidemic when the government established a hospital at Beaufort. In 1867 a company of ninety men and three officers were stationed at Beaufort for the purpose of maintaining order among the conflicting factions of reconstruction programs.\n\nThe United States sloop, Huron, was wrecked off the coast of Carteret by a severe storm in 1874 and soon afterward the United States government established the line Life Saving Stations along the coast of North Carolina which are today the protection of men following the sea. The remarkable feat of N. H. Bishop who arrived at Beaufort after having traveled from Quebec in a canoe through inland waterways, pointed out the feasibility of an inland waterway which would lessen the danger of Cape Hatteras and plans for the present Boston-Beaufort Inland Waterway was the result of this discovery.\n\nThe Great War and After\n\nCamp Glenn, formerly Carolina City, was established in 1913 as a training camp for the North Carolina National Guards and many thousand men were trained there for the Mexican War. During the great war Camp Glenn was turned into a Coast Guard Air Station where men were trained in the use of Hydroplanes with which to patrol the coast. The camp is still a Coast Guard Station. Carteret furnished men to the Army and Navy during the last war, built ships and patrolled the coast and made war savings investments. Most of Carteret's volunteers went into the Navy for which many of them were already trained and therefore Carteret's list of Naval Officers was long. Probably the most distinguished service done by a Carteret man in the late war was that of Youman Weeks who was a Corporal in Company F, 118th Infantry. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism in action near Bellicourt, France, September 30, 1918, and October 8, 1918. Corporal Weeks on the morning of September 30, when two enemy machine guns were making a part of the line untenable, advanced across open ground\n\nupon one of the guns, rushed the position alone, captured the gun and five of the enemy, and shot down the sixth who endeavored to escape. By this gallant act he prevented the enemy from enfilading our position and thereby saved the lives of many of his comrades. In a later advance he was killed.\n\nIn Carteret's history, which is long and very hard to obtain accurately, the most historic features, as we have seen, are the old town of Beaufort and Fort Macon located on the banks near Old Topsail Inlet to guard the entrance to Beaufort Harbor. Beaufort is still the county seat of Carteret, it looks out upon the same historic harbor; and it holds within its old streets the marks of wars and of honors in the past. Its population has reached 3,500 and like its twin city, Morehead, just across the water, has become a resort town with tourists in summer flooding its water-front driveways and giving it, for the moment, a cosmopolitan appearance.\n\nFort Macon, no longer of service to the United States as a fortification, has long since fallen into decay and visited only by tourists interested in its history. In 1924 Congress gave Fort Macon and the four hundred acres of land belonging with it to the state of North Carolina to be used as a state park. The old fort is in the midst of a string of government establishments, among them Camp Glenn, near Morehead City, the United States Laboratory for research in marine biology on Piver's Island near Beaufort, and the numerous Coast Guard Stations on the beach.\n\nSOURCES OF INFORMATION\n\nAshe, S.

Lay\n\nGeography\n\nCarteret County is situated in the east central part of the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. It is bounded on the north by Craven County, the Neuse River, and Pamlico Sound; on the east by Core Sound, on the south by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the west by Onslow and Jones Counties, being separated from Onslow County by White Oak River. According to the 1920 census report Carteret County contains 366,720 acres.\n\nTopography and Soils\n\nThe topography varies from swampy country principally in the north eastern region, to fairly high land in the western part, although there is swampy country scattered here and there all over the county. The highest elevations occur in the western end of the county. The elevation at Newport is 19 feet above sea level while at Beaufort and Morehead the elevation is 12 feet.\n\nCore and Bogue Sounds are separated from the ocean by a long narrow strip of land known as the banks, which extends along the ocean front of the county. The continuity of the banks is broken only at Beaufort, Ocracoke, Bogue, and Whalebone inlets. Many large sand dunes are found on these banks.\n\nThe county is split up very much especially in the eastern portion. Newport River, North River, and Cedar Island Bay serve to make communication difficult on the mainland while Core and Bogue Sounds separate the banks from the mainland.\n\nThe high sandy loam soils of Carteret County are well suited to the raising of truck products and general farming. Recently drained land that is very largely muck is suitable for corn, cabbages, onions, and celery.\n\nLarge quantities of fertilizer are used annually by Carteret farmers. In 1920, 806 farms reporting out of a possible 858 farms, used $163,613 worth of fertilizers.\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate of Carteret County is very mild with few cold days in winter. It is a common sight to see roses and other varieties of\n\nflowers in full bloom at Christmas. The average temperature for 1925 was 64.1 degrees Fahrenheit. The rainfall was well distributed throughout the year, September being the one exception. For 1925 the average rainfall was 3.9 inches per month. The following table shows the temperature as recorded at the United States Biological station at Beaufort.\n\nTemperature Chart for Beaufort, N. C., for 1925.\n\nMonth Mean (Degrees Fahrenheit) Highest Lowest Total Precipitation (Inches) January 47 68 27 5.94 February 54 70 30 3.97 March 56 71 25 3.33 April 63 80 40 1.47 May 69 88 50 1.37 June 71 90 69 7.11 July 81 93 68 7.57 August 80 92 65 3.55 September 80 92 65 .49 October 66 87 41 4.37 November 55 77 41 2.89 December 48 69 12 4.78 MEAN 64.1 Degrees Fahrenheit. 3.9 ins.\n\nCarteret County has a growing season of 365 days.\n\nForests\n\nThe forests of Carteret County form an important natural resource and lumbering gives employment to many people. The location of most of the standing timber is in the western and central parts of the county. The standing timber comprises 42,189 acres or approximately 11.2 percent of the total area of the county. A large part of it is in pine, but gum, poplar, oak, juniper, and cypress are plentiful. The timber is used for various purposes; pine lumber for shipment or for local building purposes forms the largest use, but large quanities of pine and gum are used in the manufacture of barrels. Cypress, juniper, and oak are used for boat building. There are three saw mills in the county besides a lumber manufacturing plant and several box and barrel factories.\n\nThe forests of the county are important in so much as they form a source of fuel and lumber, in the manufacture of which are employed many people who depend on it for a living.\n\nMuch of the waste land is cut over timber land which has been allowed to grow up in underbrush or has been burnt over from time to time. This land could be planted in trees after cutting over and owing to the natural rapidity of growth the trees would soon be ready to cut again. Disastrous fires have often destroyed valuable\n\nTop—Dairy Cattle. Upper Middle— Carteret County Court House. Lower Middle—Grading and Packing Irish Potatoes. Bottom—Old Fort Macon.\n\ntimber due to the carelessness of a camper or someone burning brush.\n\nThe present tax system does not encourage land owners to let their trees grow until they are big enough for timber. Each year the trees are taxed accordingly to their size and the tax increases in proportion to their size. Then the landowner cuts them for timber prematurely because the total tax has become so great that he considers it unprofitable to let them grow longer. Furthermore, the average landowner does not like to pay taxes on his property and get no return; it would be much more desirable to have the entire tax paid when the timber is sold.\n\nWater Surface\n\nCarteret County is different from most counties in that out of 366,720 acres within its boundaries 158,789 acres are water surface. A large part of the water surface is contained in Bogue, Core, and Pamlico Sounds. The principal rivers are North, Newport, and White Oak the last of which separates Carteret from Onslow County. There is approximately 19,802 acres of swamp land in the county. Since Carteret is a tidewater county it is natural for swamps to form. Some very good timber can be found in these swamps, and they afford an excellent refuge to wild animals. The drainage of the county is good because all the land is so near the water that a ditch will drain it unless it is unusually low.\n\nThe coast line of the county is approximately 85 miles long and consists of five reefs called “banks”. They are broken by Beaufort, Bogue, and Whalebone inlets. Beaufort and Morehead City are the two most important harbors in the county. Both towns are on the Inland Waterway which runs from New York to Beaufort. Twelve feet of water may be had by vessels on the Inland Waterway. In Core and Bogue Sounds vssels have navigable channels of three to six feet of water, while on the bar at Beaufort vessels drawing up to seventeen feet of water may enter.\n\nWater transportation is furnished the county by two lines of freight boats running from Morehead City and Beaufort to Newbern, Washington City, and Norfolk.\n\nFlora and Fauna\n\nCarteret County is an ideal spot for the naturalist for it abounds in plants and animals. Nearly all plants can grow here although there is not enough clay for some. The climate is such that many plants do not have to be protected during the winter\n\nmonths. It is a common sight to see roses and many other flowering shrubs blooming at Christmas. The Camelia Japonica flourishes in this mild climate. The county is noted for its holly, mistletoe, and yaopon.\n\nThe animal life of Carteret County is very abundant. Deer, bear, turkeys, wildcats, squirrels, minks, opossum, and raccoons are plentiful, especially around the swamps. Large numbers are killed every year and owing to the inroad of the sawmill on the refuge places there will soon be a very small number of these animals unless some steps are taken to preserve them. The bird life of Carteret County is large in variety and numbers. Most of the birds are migratory such as the ducks, geese, brant, swan, snipe, plover, herons, and many other species. Many bald-headed eagles have their habitat around Carteret County, while fish hawks, owls, and other birds of prey are common. There are several heron rookeries in the county, the one on Craney Island being of special interest.\n\nThe abundance of wild fowl attracts many hunters to the county every year and the fowl are suffering from their onslaughts.\n\nFishing Industry\n\nThe three natural industries of Carteret are agriculture, lumbering, and fishing. Of these three fishing is by far the most important. North Carolina is the most important fishing state on the South Atlantic coast, doing a $2,414,499 business in 1923. Carteret County carries on the largest fishing industry in the state, amounting to $729,363 in 1923, which is 30.2 percent of the total for the state.\n\nThe scallop industry of North Carolina is practically limited to Carteret County. Thousands of gallons of scallops are shipped to northern markets each year; 55,826 were shipped in 1924. Owing to heavy rains most of the scallops were killed last year and so the State Fish Commission declared a closed season until they have an opportunity to become abundant again.\n\nClams constitute another important phase of the fishing industry. They are able to keep well for several days and because of this hundreds of bushels are shipped north and to inland towns each year. In 1924, 11,468 bushels were shipped.\n\nThe oyster industry is an important item in the fishing industry. In 1924 Carteret County produced 128,905 bushels of oysters. There are more oyster shucking houses and canning plants in the\n\ncounty than in all the rest of the state. The only two wholesale shippers of oysters in North Carolina are located at Morehead City.\n\nOwing to the recent scare about the supposed oyster pollution the State Fish Commission equipped the patrol boat “Pamlico” with a laboratory under the charge of Mr. T. R. McCrea to ascertain as near as possible the amount of pollution of North Carolina oyster beds. As yet the pollution has been far below that of other states and there has been no cause to condemn any oyster beds.\n\nShrimps are another source of revenue to the fishermen. Shrimp trawling forms an occupation for many people. Hundreds of pounds of shrimp are canned annually at Morehead City and Beaufort. In 1924 the catch amounted to 42,540 pounds.\n\nThe shipments of food fish from Carteret County are very large, the catch in 1923 was 6,894,899 pounds, exclusive of oysters, clams, and scallops. The principal food fishes are trout, spots, croakers, bluefish, mackerel, shad, pigfish, mullet, sea mullet, harvest fish, butter fish, flounders, and drum. The wide variety of fish offers very good opportunities to fishermen with all types of nets. There are about 260 species of fish known around Beaufort and its vicinity.\n\nPerhaps the most important phase of the fishing industry is menhaden fishing and the manufacturing connected with it. In 1918 the catch amounted to 90 million pounds, while in 1923 the catch was only 40 millions of pounds. The menhaden is used in the manufacture of fish scrap and oils. The fish scrap is used for fertilizer and for stock feed, while the oil is used in paints and in the manufacture of soap. There are approximately 1500 people employed in the menhaden fishing industry and its associated manufacturies.\n\nSTATISTICS OF FISHING INDUSTRY IN Carteret County SHOWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE ENGAGED AND INVESTMENT FOR 1918\n\nPersons engaged Number On vessels fishing 656 On vessels transporting 35 In shore fisheries 1,251 Shoresmen 766 Total 2,708 Investment Number Value Vessels fishing Gasoline 49 $356,150 Tonnage 1,026 Outfit 142,350 Sail Tonnage 26 Outfit 5,144 Vessels transporting Gasoline 22 Tonnage 177 Outfit 8,025 Sail 4 Tonnage 36 Outfit 925 Boats Sail, row, etc. 414 9,755 Power 461 112,875 Apparatus, vessel fisheries Purse seines 38 102,600 Gill nets 13 800 Lines 50 Dredges 42 1,530 Tongs 16 82 Apparatus, shore fisheries Haul seines 123 3,185 Purse seines 1 1,000 Gill nets 1,877 49,305 Pound nets 268 24,750 Fyke nets Lines 230 Otter trawls 13 390 Dredges 492 1,525 Tongs and rakes 182 432 Eel pots 25 35 Other apparatus 370 659 Shore and accessory property 543,480 Cash capital 74,000 Total $1,475,828\n\nPRODUCTS OF THE FISHERIES OF Carteret County 1918 AND 1923\n\nProduct 1918 Pounds 1918 Value 1923 Pounds 1923 Value Alewives 75,636 $ 3,774 24,850 $ 895 Angel fish 3,800 155 5,000 252 Bluefish 261,055 32,545 511,190 45,199 Bonito 3,015 107 27,850 2,557 Butter fish 71,999 4,379 177,426 9,350 Catfish Cero 151,871 10,615 1,139 124 Crevalle 204 11 Croaker 232,226 9,863 1,734,495 34,700 Drum, red and black 32,165 1,332 96,470 3,347 Eels 1,500 150 15,535 2,325 Flounders 8,175 543 70,762 3,419 Gizzard shad Hickory shad 23,611 11,449 66,850 3,399 Menhaden 90,232,799 480,212 40,707,940 203,639 Mullet: Fresh 405,855 19,804 495,404 34,365 Salted 22,500 4,000 6,800 760 Perch, white Pigfish 152,380 4,859 277,835 5,714 Pike Pinfish 18,380 238 1,060 40 Pompano 2,768 332 15,360 1,501 Sea Bass 59,650 5,763 102,265 8,217 Shad 53,994 13,753 103,319 26,044 Sheepshead 17,099 988 136,185 2,322 Spanish Mackerel 115,330 11,372 131,175 13,568 Spot 792,565 11,372 766,248 17,919 Squeteague 1,584,096 122,323 1,234,190 85,772 Striped Bass 995 133 35,990 6,502 Sturgeon 540 27 Suckers Yellowtail 8,108 229 Shrimp 450,108 9,385 252,792 8,606 Crabs: Hard 2,000 150 Soft 233,665 23,811 181,996 27,673 Terrapin 60 57 Turtles 7,500 44 300 7 Clams 47,176 8,103 115,192 26,292 Oysters 879,977 31,925 1,592,906 89,602 Scallops 415,572 30,768 554,574 46,214 Shark hides 19,125 2,868 Other aquatic hides 1,050 157 Harvest fish, or “starfish” 319,070 7,892 Grunts 1,100 33 Sea Mullet 190,650 10,971 Snapper 1,200 84 Tautog 75 5 Total 196,479,790 $857,827 49,765,511 $739,363\n\nCarteret County COMPARED WITH THE TOTAL FOR North Carolina IN THE NUMBER OF POUNDS OF FISH FOR 1918 AND 1923 ACCORDING TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE VARIOUS FISHES\n\nSpecies Carteret County North Carolina Percent of State 1918 1923 1918 1923 1918 1923 Alewives 75,636 24,850 14,473,820 6,522,397 .5 .3 Bluefish 261,055 511,190 322,055 896,694 80.7 57.

The laboratory was established primarily to furnish aid to the fishing industry but it also serves as a laboratory for students doing scientific investigation. A terrapin hatchery is operated here in an effort to restock the marshes of North Carolina with the diamond back terrapin.\n\nSome recent investigations directed from Piver's Island are: The Mullet Investigation, Investigation of Summer Fisheries of Pamlico Sound, and Investigation of the Scallop Problem.\n\nOwing to the rapid decrease of the mullet in North Carolina, the United States Bureau of Fisheries started an investigation in 1925 under the direction of Mr. Elmer Higgins. Before any steps could be taken to conserve the mullet it was necessary to learn its life habits. In connection with this a tagging experiment was put on in which 3,000 fish were tagged. As yet no recommendations have been offered for the regulation of the fishery.\n\nDuring the summer of 1925 the Bureau of Fisheries with the cooperation of the State Fish Commission investigated the action of pound nets and long haul seines on fish. The results were that, of the two species forming the bulk of the catch in pound nets, grey trout and harvest fish, about half were under the marketable size, while practically no destruction occurs by long haul seins\n\nuntil October. The wastage of the pound nets occurs during June, July, August, September, and October. The State Fish Commission, upon recommendation, passed a ruling establishing a closed season on pound nets until August 1st.\n\nDuring 1925 such heavy rains occurred that the scallops were seriously decreased. Accordingly Mr. James S. Gutsell was finally secured by The State Fishery Commission from the Bureau of Fisheries to work out a solution. After much study of the problem he recommended a closed season until the scallops had an opportunity to spawn. As a result the season was opened January 18th, 1926. Although the scallops are small they are found in considerable quantities in some parts of the county.\n\nScenic Places and Tourist Advantages\n\nCarteret County is very fortunate in having very good natural advantages for pleasure seekers. Its excellent beaches on the sound and ocean attract thousands of people every summer. The prevailing breezes makes a delightful summer resort, while in winter it is warmed by the Gulf stream so that the climate is very enjoyable. The county is on the eastern end of Route 10 thus assuring good roads for those who prefer to motor down. In the waters around Carteret County abound large numbers of fish that are sought for by many sportsmen during the summer. The sounds and rivers offer a feeding ground for countless numbers of ducks and geese. Many sportsmen come each year to take advantage of the opportunities that nature affords them here.\n\nFort Macon, near Beaufort, is one of the historic spots in North Carolina. Fort Macon had its origin in 1755 under the name of Fort Hampton. Fort Hampton was only a wooden structure. In 1836 the fort was rebuilt of masonry and named Fort Macon. After its surrender to the Federal forces in 1862 it was held by a small garrison and finally dismantled. The Federal government has recently granted it to the state to be set aside as a State Park.\n\nIII THE COUNTY'S PEOPLE\n\nAleeze Lefferts\n\nThe Values of Human Bookkeeping\n\nTo have a record of Carteret's people which is based on statistics—to have written down how they have lived, with facts about their homes, health and interests; how they have worked, fished, farmed and manufactured; and how they have progressed from year to year is to view the county as it is and not as one hopes it is or imagines it to be. It is possible also by means of statistics to compare the achievements of Carteret's people with the achievements of the people of other counties. When Carteret's citizens are called upon to pass judgment upon county government and county programs of work they must judge the present and future needs of the county by their knowledge of the processes which brought success or failure in the past. Carteret's successful business men plan their work upon the basis of the facts obtained from good bookkeeping. Cannot a county do the same thing with success? This chapter presents some of the facts about the people of Carteret County.\n\nTotal Population\n\nThe one hundred counties of North Carolina averaged 25,591 inhabitants each in 1920. In that year Carteret ranked 68th in population with 15,384. But in the last nine census reports Carteret has shown a steady increase in population. Only one census report of the fifteen given below shows a decrease in the population of Carteret and that was a decrease of less than one percent in 1840. Carteret annexed a piece of territory from Craven County between 1880 and 1890 which affected the increase of population shown by the census of 1890.\n\nOf the nine North Carolina counties bordering the Atlantic ocean, Currituck, Dare, Hyde, Pamlico, Onslow, Carteret, Pender, New Hanover and Brunswick, Carteret ranked next to New Hanover in both population for 1920 and the percentage increase of population between 1910 and 1920. New Hanover increased 26 percent in population during the decade and Carteret 11.7 percent.\n\nThere were 3,413 families in Carteret occupying 3,231 homes in 1920. Of these homes 851 were rented by the families occupying them and 2,446 homes were owned by the families, or in other\n\nwords, 76 percent of the homes in Carteret are owned by the families occupying them.\n\nThe following table shows Carteret's population by decades since 1790.\n\nTOTAL POPULATION OF Carteret County: 1790-1923\n\nYear Population Percent Increase or Decrease Carteret North Carolina 1790 3,732 1800 4,399 17.6 21.4 1810 4,823 9.6 16.2 1820 5,609 12.1 15.0 1830 6,597 17.6 15.5 1840 6,591 - .001 2.1 1850 6,939 5.3 15.3 1860 8,186 17.9 14.2 1870 9,010 10.0 7.9 1880 9,784 8.5 30.7 1890* 10,825 10.5 15.6 1900 11,811 9.1 17.1 1910 13,776 16.6 16.5 1920 15,384 11.7 16.0 1923† 15,963 * Territory was annexed from Craven County between 1880 and 1890. † The figures for 1923 are estimated by the Bureau of Census.\n\nTownships\n\nAccording to the last United States Census report there were thirteen townships in Carteret County. Nine of them were officially numbered and four were townships created since 1910 from parts of adjoining townships. The townships are: White Oak (1), Morehead (2), Newport (3), Beaufort (4), Straits (5), Smyrna (6), Hunting Quarters (7), Portsmouth (8), Merrimon (9). Harkers Island Township and Carteret Township were organized from parts of Straits Township; Cedar Island Township was organized from a part of Hunting Quarters Township; and Harlowe Township was organized from a part of Newport Township. These last four townships created since 1910 have not been officially numbered. The population figures for the townships in the following table will include any town or village within them. The table shows the trend of population for the nine townships from 1900 to 1920.\n\nPOPULATION OF TOWNSHIPS WITH PERCENTAGE INCREASE AND DECREASE: 1900-1920\n\nTownships 1920 Percent Increase or Decrease 1910 Percent Increase or Decrease 1900 White Oak 881 -11.9 1,000 9.7 912 Morehead 3,867 24.3 3,109 37.7 2,259 Newport 1,093 -9.8 1,212 2.6 1,181 Beaufort 4,099 18.4 3,459 11.5 3,012 Straits 905 -37.4 1,445 18.0 1,224 Smyrna 894 -20.7 1,254 16.0 1,081 Hunting Quarters 1,724 1.4 1,700 11.2 1,520 Merrimon 455 9.6 415 -12.0 472 *Portsmouth 376 Cedar Island 376 Carteret 5 Harkers Island 681 Harlowe 404 * Returns from Portsmouth and Cedar Island made together, 1920.\n\nThis table shows Merrimon Township losing population from 1900 to 1910, and White Oak and Symrna Townships losing population from 1910 to 1920. The decreased population of Straits and Newport Townships is perhaps explained by the decrease in territory since 1910.\n\nRural and Urban\n\nThe United States Census treats as urban all incorporated places of 2,500 inhabitants or more and the remainder of the county as rural. Carteret's population was counted as entirely rural until 1920. The census for that year gave the urban population of Carteret as 5,926 which was the combined populations of the two largest towns, Beaufort and Morehead City. In 1920 the urban population was 38.5 percent of the total population and the percent of increase of population of all incorporated places was 29.3 while the percentage increase of open-country population was only 12.3 showing a slight trend toward urbanization.\n\nIn 1920 North Carolina was 80.8 percent rural and 19.2 percent urban. The United States, on the other hand, for the first time showed a higher urban than rural percentage—51.4 percent against 48.6 percent.\n\nOpen-Country Population\n\nIn 1920 the percent of open-country population in Carteret was 53.6 percent of the total population. In the state the open-country population was 71.4 percent of the total population. By “open-country” is meant those who dwell for the most part in isolated farm houses.\n\nThe following table gives the open-country population with percentages for the last three decades.\n\nOPEN-COUNTRY POPULATION OF CARTERET 1900-1920\n\nYear Open-Country Percent in Population Percent Increase or Decrease 1900 7,909 66.9 1910 8,409 61.0 6.3 1920 8,154 53.6 12.3\n\nCarteret shows a decrease in open-country population from 1910 to 1920 and also from 1900 to 1910. This fact further illustrates the drift toward the town and city that is taking place in Carteret County.\n\nDensity of Population\n\nThe total density of Carteret per square mile was 26.8 inhabitants in 1920 while the state averaged 52.5 inhabitants to the square mile. Carteret's rural population per square mile was 16.5 which was the lowest rate of rural population per square mile of the forty-nine counties having one or more incorporated places of 2,500 inhabitants in 1920. The open-country density per square mile in Carteret in 1920 was 12.7 inhabitants and the open-country contained 53.3 percent of the total population. In the state 71.4 percent of the population lived in the open-country in 1920.\n\nRace\n\nThe percentage of Negro population in Carteret has steadily decreased for the last thirty years. The same has been true of North Carolina and the United States. In 1920 the Negro population in Carteret had increased only 3 percent above that of 1890 while the white population increased 52 percent during that period.\n\nThe following table compares the population of the races in Carteret and also gives the percentage Negro population in North Carolina and the United States from 1890 to 1920.\n\nWHITE AND NEGRO POPULATION OF CARTERET WITH PERCENTAGES FOR N. C. AND U. S., 1890-1920\n\nPercentage Negro in Population Year White Negro Carteret N. C. U. S. 1890 8,528 2,297 21.2 34.7 11.9 1900 9,684 2,127 18.0 33.0 11.6 1910 11,460 2,292 16.6 31.6 10.7 1920 12,962 2,382 15.5 29.8 9.9\n\nForeign-Born Population\n\nIn the total population of Carteret County in 1920 there were only 24 of foreign parentage and 56 of mixed parentage. In the same year there were only 36 foreign-born whites. The fact that there are no great manufacturing industries in Carteret accounts for the small proportion of foreign-born inhabitants.\n\nThe native countries of Carteret's foreign-born population are given in the table below.\n\nFOREIGN-BORN POPULATION OF Carteret County: 1920\n\nCountry Number Country Number Canada 2 Hungary 1 Denmark 1 Ireland 1 England 4 Italy 1 Germany 1 Netherlands 1 Russia 4 Scotland 3 Sweden 6 China 1 Norway 8 Other Countries 2\n\nThe fact that there are more people from Norway and Sweden than from other foreign countries is accounted for by the fact that they are notably sea-faring people and Carteret is on the sea coast.\n\nSex\n\nCarteret County has more males than females according to the census report of 1920. This was true of the state at large which had a ratio of 101.6 white males to 100 white females.\n\nSEX RATIOS IN Carteret County: 1860, 1920\n\nMales per 100 Females Males Females Total: 1920 101.4 7,746 7,638 Total: 1860 96.8 3,060 3,156 Native White: 1920 102.0 6,546 6,414 Native White: 1860 97.9 3,001 3,063 Foreign-Born White: 1920 300.0 27 9 Negro: 1920 96.6 1,172 1,213 Negro: 1860 64.3 60 93 Total 21 years and over: 1920 96.9 3,901 3,922 Native White, native parentage 99.3 3,285 3,306 Native White, foreign or mixed parentage 166.0 35 21 Foreign-born White 300.0 27 9 Negro 90.9 533 586 18 to 44 years inclusive: 1920 95.0 2,819 2,965\n\nThe table shows 102.0 white males to every 100 white females and only 96.6 Negro males to 100 Negro females. The colored women are employed in domestic work and in the canning of sea foods which probably offers better chance of employment than is\n\noffered to the colored men. So far the Negro men have not adapted themselves to the fishing industry very well and they have not found many farms to rent in Carteret County where farms are usually small and cultivated intensively.\n\nIn 1860 there were 97.9 white males to every 100 white females. The ratio of white males to 100 females has greatly increased in Carteret since 1860—a condition which is explained by the fact that there are few industries in Carteret which give regular employment to white women. The number of Negro males per 100 Negro females was only 64.3 in 1860. In 1920 the ratio was 96.9 males to 100 females.\n\nMarriage and Divorce\n\nThe rate of divorce in the state in 1923 was 15.9 mariages per divorce. In 1916 the rate was 31.9 marriages per divorce. The number of marriages per divorce in 1906 was 52.8. The state's average increase in the divorce rate from 1906 to 1923 was lower than the average increase for the United States.\n\nThe following table gives marriage and divorce statistics for Carteret County from 1887 to 1923.\n\nMARRIAGE AND DIVORCE IN Carteret County 1887-1906; 1916, 1922, 1923\n\nNumber of Marriages Number of Divorces Number of Marriages per Divorce 1887 79 1 79 1888 75 1889 84 1 84 1890 105 1891 88 1 88 1892 100 3 33.3 1893 111 1 111 1894 94 1 94 1895 94 1 94 1896 129 3 43 1897 104 1898 101 1 101 1899 115 2 57.5 1900 108 2 54 1901 111 1 111 1902 138 4 34.5 1903 137 1 137 1904 139 4 34.7 1905 144 3 48 1906 136 1916 117 10 11.7 1922 106 4 24 1923 138 4 34.5\n\nIn 1922 the number of marriages per divorce in Carteret was 24. In 1923 the number was 34.5 which shows a slight decrease. However, there were only 30 divorces in Carteret from 1887 to 1906, a period of ninteen years, while in the year 1916 alone the number of divorces reached 10. In the two-year period 1922 and 1923, there were 8 divorces which showed a much increased rate of divorce over that of the period from 1887 to 1906. The tendency towards urbanization in the county as shown from the table on rural and urban population has brought increased divorce.\n\nBirth Rate\n\nThe birth rate for the white race and the birth rate for the colored race is approximately the same in Carteret County for the years 1920, 1921, and 1922. The majority of the white race is rural while the most of the Negro race which composes only a small part of the population live in the urban districts. Therefore the birth rates given in the table below are urban for the Negro race and to a large extent rural for the white race. This probably has some effect upon the result shown in the table.\n\nBIRTHS AND RATE PER 1,000 OF POPULATION IN Carteret County: 1917-1922\n\nWhite Negro Year Number Rate Number Rate 1917 375 29.3 71 29.4 1918 371 94 1919 389 75 1920 410 31.4 84 35.1 1921 468 35.4 82 34.2 1922 417 31.1 65 27.0\n\nBIRTHS BY SEX AND COLOR FOR Carteret County: 1917-1919\n\nWhite Negro Year Male Female Male Female 1917 187 188 38 33 1918 188 183 44 54 1919 227 162 37 38\n\nThis table shows that there were more males born among the white race in 1918 and 1919 than females while among the Negro race there were more female than male births.\n\nDeath Rate\n\nThe following table gives the number of deaths and the rate of deaths for both the white and the colored race from 1917 to 1922.\n\nWHITE AND NEGRO DEATHS AND RATE PER 1,000 POPULATION IN Carteret County: 1917-1922\n\nWhite Negro Year Number Rate Number Rate 1917 124 11.2 47 19.5 1918 218 14.1 87 1919 180 11.6 50 1920 207 13.4 158 31.4 1921 151 11.4 140 16.7 1922 147 11.0 34 14.1\n\nInfant Death Rate\n\nConsidering the small percentage of Negro population in Carteret County, the deaths shown in the tables for the Negro infants under one year of age and under five years of age, make a much higher rate of deaths than for the white infants of the same ages. This is seen from the tables which follow:\n\nDEATHS AND RATE PER 1,000 POPULATION OF INFANTS UNDER ONE YEAR OF AGE IN Carteret County: 1917-1922\n\nWhiteNegroYearNumberRateNumberRate19172053111551918271002020419193910014187192027661113119213779911019223789462\n\nDEATHS OF INFANTS UNDER FIVE YEARS OF AGE BY AGE AND RACE IN Carteret County: 1923\n\nRaceTotalUnder one YearOne YearTwo YearsThree YearsFour YearsWhite422910210Negro961200\n\nHealth\n\nCarteret organized a Department of Health in coöperative agreement with the State Board of Health on September 1, 1922, but this was discontinued March 1, 1923. During the time that work was reported the budget, expenditures, cost equivalents and average earnings were as follows:\n\nBudgetExpendituresCost EquivalentsAverage Earning$1,666.66$2,555.07$3,288.45$1.27\n\nCarteret should not be satisfied with less than the best which can be secured in behalf of the health of her citizens. The health of Carteret's citizens means wealth to the county and progress to\n\nthe county's enterprises. The money spent on health is not a charitable gift to the needy when a county has an organized health force; it is rather an investment which will add money to the county's treasury. Therefore Carteret which prides itself upon being a popular summer-resort section of the state must not neglect its health program.\n\nCrime In Carteret County\n\nIn the following tables comparing crime in Carteret County for the ten-year periods ending June 30 in 1914 and 1924, respectively, it should be kept in mind that:\n\n1. The population of the county increased about 15 percent over the ten-year period.\n\n2. Changes in the statutes increased the number of criminal acts that could be committed, for example, the prohibition law and changes in the definition of assault and battery.\n\n3. The increasing complexity of urban life has brought a consequent loosening of communities and the increase of petty crimes.\n\n4. Stricter enforcement may mean more prosecutions for fewer crimes. This is especially true of the law against carrying concealed weapons.\n\nCRIMINAL CASES DISPOSED OF IN Carteret County DURING THE FALL AND SPRING TERMS OF THE SUPERIOR COURT: 1913-14, 1923-24\n\n1913-1914 1923-1924 White 40 43 Colored 32 27 Male 68 69 Female 4 1 Convicted 56 70 Acquitted 11 Nolle pros Otherwise Disposed of 5\n\nCRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS WITH WHICH DEFENDANTS WERE CHARGED DURING THE FISCAL YEARS ENDING JUNE 30, 1914 AND 1924\n\nCharged With 1913-1914 1923-1924 Assault (inc. assault and battery) 2 1 Abandonment 1 1 Abduction 0 2 Affray 5 2 Assault with deadly weapon 9 1 Assault to rape 1 0 Carrying concealed weapons 2 1 Cruelty to animals 1 1 Disposing of mortgaged property 0 1 False pretense 1 1 Fornication and adultery 2 0 Fish and game laws 0 5 Forcible trespass 0 1 Gambling and lottery 0 4 Injury to property 0 2 Intoxicating liquors 0 37 Larceny 7 8 Murder: Second Degree 1 1 Resisting officer 2 0 Retailing 18 0 Seduction 1 0 Trespass 5 2 Miscellaneous 14 2\n\nDoes Carteret Read?\n\nCarteret County ranked 28th in 1924 in the number of inhabitants per county circulation of eight National magazines with 17.1 inhabitants per magazine. The eight national magazines are: The Ladies Home Journal, McCall's Magazine, Cosmopolitan, The Saturday Evening Post, the American Magazine, The Literary Digest, The Youth's Companion and The Woman's Home Companion. And although Carteret is largely rural it ranked 96th in 1924 in the number of inhabitants per county circulation of three farm periodicals with 53.7 inhabitants per paper. These periodicals are: Farm and Fireside, The Country Gentleman, and The Progressive Farmer.\n\nTotal Illiteracy\n\nIn 1920 the illiterate population of Carteret, ten years of age and over, was 1,121 which was 9.9 percent of its total population ten years of age and over. Of the counties adjoining Carteret, Pamlico has a lower percentage with only 7.6 percent. The percent of male adults in Carteret 21 years of age and over who are illiterate is 12.4, and the percent of females is 13.3. Between 16 and 20 years of age inclusive only 64, or 4.5 percent, are illiterate. Only\n\none adjoining county had a lower percent—this was Pamlico with 2.5 percent.\n\nWhite Illiteracy\n\nOf white illiterates in Carteret, ten years of age and over, in 1920 there were 754 or 7.8 percent of the white population ten years of age and over. Of the adjoining counties Pamlico and Craven have lower rates, Pamlico with 5.6 and Craven with only 3.3 percent. Of white male illiterates, 21 years of age and over, Carteret has 10.7 percent while Pamlico has 7.3 and Craven only 6.3 percent. The same is true of white females, 21 years of age and over,—Carteret has a percentage of 10.4 while Pamlico has 8.5 and Craven 4.6 percent. New Hanover ranks first in the state in white literacy of population 10 years of age and over, having only 1.8 percent illiterate.\n\nNegro Illiteracy\n\nOf the Negro population 10 years of age and over, 336 or 21.3 percent are illiterate. Of the adjoining counties only Pamlico has a lower rate with 11.5 percent. The number of male illiterates, 21 years of age and over, is 147 and the number of female illiterates, 21 years of age and over, is 177. The Negro population constitutes only a small percent of the population of Carteret, only 15.5 percent in 1920. These rates of Negro illiteracy are smaller than those of adjoining counties except that of Pamlico.\n\nNon-Voting In Carteret County\n\nThe average number of votes cast in Carteret County in 1920 for Governor, United States Senator, Congressman, and President of the United States was 4,353. In 1924 the average number cast was 4,044 for the same four officials. The total number of qualified voters in Carteret County in 1920 and 1924 is not available but reckoning all inhabitants 21 years of age and over in 1920 as eligible to vote, there would be 7,823 eligible, 6,591 of which are white. Reckoning on the basis of the native white population alone, only 66 percent of the citizens of Carteret voted in 1920 while upon the basis of the possible eligibles in the total population in 1920 only 55.6 voted. In 1924 the average number of votes cast was 309 less than in 1920 which would make the percentage voting in 1924 show a marked decrease since the population had increased considerably since 1920.\n\nNon-voting is at present assuming serious proportions in all sections of the United States. Collier's Magazine has pointed out the “descending curve of American Democracy” by revealing recent voting history as follows:\n\nIn 1896—80 percent of eligibles voted.\n\nIn 1900—73 percent of eligibles voted.\n\nIn 1908—66 percent of eligibles voted.\n\nIn 1912—62 percent of eligibles voted.\n\nIn 1920—50 percent of eligibles voted.\n\nIn 1924, in spite of an intensive campaign by the National League of Women Voters and other organizations, only 51.2 percent of all qualified voters in the United States voted. That our people should resume their responsibility of voting is apparent.\n\nThe table following gives the number of votes cast for four different officials in 1920 and 1924.\n\nTHE VOTE FOR GOVERNOR OF North Carolina IN Carteret County: 1920, 1924\n\nTotal vote: 1920 4,386 Cameron Morrison (D) 2,094 John J.

La Follette (I) 15\n\nLeisure Time Activities\n\nIn the summer Carteret abounds in places of amusement and sports from the gay palilions at Atlantic View Beach to the quiet summer cottages along Pamlico Sound. Swimming, sailing, and fishing are good everywhere on the shore line and it is said that no family in Carteret lives more than two miles from the water, thus everybody may enjoy it at will. The beaches are all free and as fine as any on the Atlantic coast, and gasoline launches are plentiful enough to carry everybody to and from the beaches whenever picnics, sailing parties or swimming is at hand. Also, in winter, the creeks and bays are the resort of thousands of wild geese and ducks which make the hunting clubs along the sound and beach quite popular places for sportsmen.\n\nThe larger communities of Carteret have well organized social groups such as community clubs and woman's clubs which plan leisure-time activities like ice-cream suppers, bazaars, and musical and dramatic programs. They also invite and sponsor Chatauqua and Lyceum entertainments and cooperate with the schools in giving support to their clubs and basketball and baseball teams.\n\nThe school buildings serve as community centers in all the smaller towns and villages. There the various clubs, fraternal lodges, and Parent-Teacher's Associations meet for work or for entertainment in the auditorium of the building. Home talent puts on entertainments here of music, plays, oyster suppers and holiday socials and here also the traveling speaker, artist, politician or magician meets the people at their leisure. Probably the most distinctive social of the smaller community of the tide-water section, however, is the oyster roast down at the water's edge on a moonlight night. This is the party that only a native can appreciate.\n\nSOURCES OF INFORMATION\n\n1.

W. Lewis.\n\nIt is the object of this chapter to give a review of the wealth resources of our county. The chapter is based on the table to be found at the close which compares Carteret in various particulars with each of the 100 counties of North Carolina.\n\nASSESSED VALUATION OF PROPERTY: 1902-1925\n\nYear Valuation 1902 $ 1,016,683 1910 2,140,374 1919 3,751,709 1920 14,175,841 1921 13,619,389 1922 12,861,389 1923 12,753,407 1925 12,086,497\n\nThe above table shows that Carteret's taxable wealth rose from $1,016,683 to $14,175,841 over a period of 18 years, from 1902 through 1920. In 1920, taxable property reached its highest mark and from this year to 1925 the value of taxable property has dropped from $14,175,841 to $12,086,497. In this period from 1920 through 1925 the wealth of the county has decreased $2,089,344. There are two reasons for the gradual decrease in taxable wealth. The first cause was the revaluation of 1919 which came at a time of abnormally high land values. Since 1919 the county officials have found it necessary from time to time to change the ratio of assessed valuation to real valuation. The county officials did this because they knew that some of the values placed on property were higher than the real value of the property. The second cause of the decrease in taxable wealth since 1919 is the deterioration of the value of the property. Such property buildings, boats, farms and machinery deteriorate when left idle and not repaired.\n\nWhen compared with other counties Carteret ranks low in wealth. In 1917, Carteret ranked 77th among the counties in taxable wealth. Durham led with $804 per inhabitant, Carteret had $267 per inhabitant, Dare was at the bottom with $391 per inhabitant. In 1923, Cartret ranked 56th among the counties in taxable property. Durham led with $1930 per inhabitant, Carteret had $876 per inhabitant, Wilkes was at the bottom with $465 per inhabitant. In 1925, Carteret ranked about 60th among the counties of the state with 755.40 per inhabitant.\n\nFor the taxable property of the white people of Carteret in 1921 we ranked 66th with an average of $1,016 per white inhabitant. This was just a little above the state average of $1,009 per white inhabitant. In negro taxable wealth per inhabitant we ranked 8th with an average of $187. The state's average in this particular was $135.\n\nFACTORS OF CARTERET'S WEALTH: 1925\n\nValue of all school property $ 451,000.00 Value of all land 10,116,271.00 Value of all automobiles 526,000.00 Value of all bank resources 1,690,760.00 Value of all railroads 475,613.00 Value of all highways 1,999,062.70 Value of all farm products 1,850,650.00 Value of all farm property 6,985,096.00 Value of all fish and products (1923) 739,363.00 Investment in fish industry (1918) 1,475,828.00 Value of all industries 1,781,946.00 Value of all products manufactured 1,146,858.00\n\nPersonal Property\n\nUnder this head all property is included except land, buildings, and permanent improvements. In 1925, personal property in Carteret County was valued at $729,053.00 or $45.50 per inhabitant in the county. In 1921, according to the report of the State Department of Revenue, Carteret ranked 73rd among the counties of the State in personal property per inhabitant. Durham County led with $1,480 per inhabitant. Carteret had $161 for each inhabitant, and Macon was lowest with $93 per inhabitant. The state's average of personal property for each inhabitant was $252.\n\nReal Property\n\nCarteret occupies an area of 252,965 acres. There are fifty other counties which have a larger acreage than Carteret. Robeson is the largest with 567,513 acres and the smallest is Chowan with 109,810 acres. The total value of land in Carteret was $2,993,060 in 1920. It was $10,006,334 in 1924, and $10,116,271 in 1925.\n\nWhen the value of real property in our county was compared with other counties of the State in 1920, we were found to rank 59th. Buncombe ranked first with $7,664,587. Dare ranked lowest with $474,859. In 1924, Pitt ranked first with $27,657,466. Carteret ranked 54th with a total value of $10,006,334. Clay ranked lowest with $1,278,459.\n\nThe number of town lots in 1920 were 2,242; in 1924, 3,344. In a period of four years Carteret County has gained over one thousand town lots. In 1920, Buncombe ranked first in the value of town lots with $13,484,771. Carteret ranked 41st with $1,097,840 and Clay ranked lowest with $22,336. In 1924, Mecklenburg ranked first with $66,138,499, Carteret ranked 35th with $3,671,189, and Clay was at the bottom with $67,594.\n\nAgricultural Wealth\n\nThere has been something like a three million dollar increase in the value of farm property over a period of six years in Carteret County. In 1919, the value of all farm property was $3,002,241. At this time the County ranked 93rd among the other counties of the state. Pitt ranked first with $44,937,177 as the value of all farm property. Dare was at the bottom with $184,893. In 1925, the value of all our farm property was $6,985,096. This three million dollar increase was due to the use of improved methods of farming and of planting more and larger money crops.\n\nValue of Farm Land\n\nThe value of farm land in Carteret County has increased about six million dollars during a period of fourteen years. In 1909, Buncombe County led with $5,708,474 as the value of all farm land. Carteret ranked 81st with $927,939 as the value of all farm land. Dare County was ranked the lowest with $350,163 as the value of her farming land. In 1923, Mecklenburg County led with $24,734,106. Carteret ranked 58th with $6,118,801. Clay County ranked lowest with $1,278,459.\n\nFarm Machinery and Implements\n\nAlong with the increase in farm land has come an increase in the value of farming utensils. This is proof that the farmers are keeping up with the modern method of farming. The use of machinery has to some extent taken the place of farm labor. The farmers have made a good increase over a period of fourteen years, but there is yet a great deal of room for improvement. In 1909, Swain County ranked first with $240,796 invested in farm implements. Carteret ranked 90th with $29,467 and Dare ranked lowest with $1,275 as the value of farming utensils. In 1923, Guilford County led with $6,602,474, Carteret ranked 60th with $376,480, and Graham County ranked the lowest with $51,205.\n\nCarteret's increase in the value of farming utensils over a period of fourteen years was $347,013.\n\nValue of Livestock\n\nThe value of live stock in the county has increased at a slow rate when compared with other counties. During a period of five years we have increased the value of livestock over $200,000. This is too small an increase for Carteret when the opportunities of our county are considered. If the people of the county would only look around them they could turn much idle land into livestock wealth. In 1920, Johnson County led in livestock wealth with $2,111,555. We were way down near the bottom with a rank of 92nd and a rate of $195,742 for our livestock wealth. Dare ranked lowest with a rate of $41,163 as the value of livestock. Our value of livestock in 1925 was $395,815.\n\nValue of Crops\n\nCarteret does not produce as much wealth as it should from its farms. We rank very low in money making crops. It is possible for our county to rank among the first in farm wealth because the soil is capable and will produce almost any crop on a good yield basis.\n\nIn 1919, Robeson County led all the other counties in the state in crop values with a rate of $22,955,950 for all crops. We ranked 79th with the rate of $1,580,851 for all crops. Dare was the lowest with a total crop valuation of $40,384.\n\nCarteret had 858 farms in 1919 and produced $1,981 worth of agricultural wealth per farm. The state average for each farm was $2,104 of agricultural wealth. If the money received from the crops of the county in 1919 had been divided among each male farmer, each would have received $408, just about enough to buy a Ford car. That is what many of the farmers did and their year's expenses went unpaid.\n\nCARTERET'S AGRICULTURAL WEALTH\n\n1919 1925 Value of all farm property $ 3,002,241 $ 6,985,096 Value of all crops produced 1,580,851 Value of livestock per farm 375.00 461.32 Number of farmers 858 910\n\nSchool Wealth\n\nIn the school year of 1913-14, Carteret had $2.19 invested in school property for each inhabitant. Our rank in this particular was 75th, Durham ranked first, and Tyrell ranked last with $.44\n\nper capita. In the school year 1923-24, Durham ranked first with the rate of $40.08 per inhabitant. Our rank in this particular was 11th with the rate of $28.00 per inhabitant. Clay's rank was at the bottom with the rate of $4.38 per capita.\n\nIn the school year of 1923-24, Buncombe County led all the counties in the value of school property with the rate of $2,486,075. In this particular our county ranked 36th with $435,500 as the value of all school property. Clay ranked the lowest with $48, 380.26 as the value of all school property. In the school year 1924-25 the value of all school property was $451,000. The school property has increased $15,500 in value during the period of one year.\n\nTaxation\n\nTaxable wealth and taxes have greatly increased in the county during the past fourteen years. In 1910, the total taxable wealth was valued at $2,226,658 and the tax rate was $.70 on the $100 valuation. In this year, 1910, Carteret collected $33,127.89 in property taxes. The county paid $481 of the amount collected to the State. In 1924, the taxable wealth of the county was valued at $12,205,176. The tax rate was $1.50, not including the school tax. The county collected $230,663.79 from taxes and paid $2,325.40 to the State. In fourteen years the county has increased $9,928, 518 in the value of taxable wealth. The tax rate has been increased $.80 on the $100 valuation during this period of fourteen years. The county's tax collections has increased $187,535.90 over the period of fourteen years. In 1912, the total tax burden for each inhabitant was $1.81; in 1922, the tax burden for each inhabitant was $6.35. Thus over a period of ten years the tax burden has increased $4.54 for each inhabitant of the county.\n\nIn 1919, Mecklenburg ranked first in the amount of income taxes collected. In this year Mecklenburg paid $24,119.12. Carteret ranked 44th on the income tax collection by paying $589.67. Alleghany County was ranked the lowest in income tax collections with only $1.50. In 1922, Mecklinburg ranked first again by paying $80,695. Our county ranked 37th and paid $15,759 in income taxes. Clay ranked the lowest with only $4,646.\n\nSALARIES OF COUNTY OFFICIALS\n\nCounty auditor $ 2,000 Clerk of court 2,000 Register of deeds 2,000 County commissioners 951.60 County demonstrator 1,279.21\n\nFisheries\n\nCOMPARATIVE TABLE OF WEALTH FROM FISHERIES\n\n1918 1923 Value of fish and products $ 857,828 $ 739,363 Number of pounds caught 196,479,790 49,765,511 Value of the vessels $ 1,475,828 Value of manufacturing plant $ 576,893\n\nThe fishing industry in Carteret County contributes a large portion of the county's wealth. The value of the fish caught in 1918, was $379,363. In this same year $1,475,828 was invested in the fishing industry for the county.\n\nBanks and Bonds\n\nBANKING WEALTH\n\n1923 1925 Number of banks 5 5 Number of inhabitants per bank 3,000 3,200 Bank capital $ 151,900 $ 167,326.23 Bank resources $ 1,607,350 $ 1,690,760.14\n\nCarteret has five banks as follows: Beaufort Banking and Trust Company, Bank of Beaufort, Bank of Morehead City, Marine Bank of Morehead City, and Bank of Newport. In 1925, the total bank surplus was $167,326.23, or an average of $10.75 per inhabitant. The bank capital per inhabitant in 1923, was $9.82. At this time Carteret ranked 59th among the counties. Mecklenburg led with $96.27 per inhabitant. Caswell County was at the bottom with $1.32 per inhabitant.\n\nIn 1923, New Hanover led other counties in per capita bank resources with $522.65 per inhabitant. Our county ranked 50th with $103.73 per inhabitant. Brunswick County ranked last with only $10.21 per inhabitant. In 1925, the total bank resources of the county were $1,690,760.14 or $108.35 per inhabitant.\n\nBonded Debt\n\nIn 1923, Lenoir County ranked first among the counties in per capita bonded debt with $74.40 per inhabitant. Our county ranked 11th with $44.80 per inhabitant. Columbus County ranked the lowest with a rate of $.33 per inhabitant. In 1925 the county bonded debt was $1,326,000 or $84.40 per each inhabitant. Our county had a difference in 1925 of $23.95 between per capita bank resources and per capita county bondage. The bank resources were $108.35 per inhabitant and the bonded debt was $84.40 per inhabitant.\n\nAutomobiles\n\nAUTOMOBILES, SCHOOLS, AND BANKS\n\n1925 Number of automobiles 561 Amount invested per capita in automobiles $ 28.1 Total amount invested in automobiles $ 568,000 Total amount invested in schools $ 451,000 Total amount bank capital $ 158,330\n\nThe automobile has increased in number very rapidly since 1915. In this year Guilford County led with a total of 985 cars. Carteret ranked 81st among the counties with a total of 27 cars. Graham, Alleghany, and Mitchell ranked the lowest with no automobiles at all. In 1924, Guilford led in the number of cars with 13,790. Carteret ranked 88th in the total number of automobiles with 561 cars. Graham ranked last with only 18 automobiles. In nine years Carteret has increased the number of autos from 27 to 561. This is an increase of 534 automobiles in nine years. In 1924, the county had invested in automobiles $568,000.\n\nHighways\n\nHIGHWAY TABLES: 1925\n\nTotal mileage 290 miles Hard surface 50 miles Soft surface 240 miles Cost of road labor $ 8,978.82 Cost of road supervision 1,598.49 Cost of machinery and material 9,334.89 Total expenses $ 19,912.20 Cost of bridges built and under construction 845,000.00 Cost of hard surface roads 1,133,150.50 $ 1,998,062.70\n\nIn 1925, Carteret spent $19,912.20 for the maintenance of its roads. In addition to this we built 50 miles of hard surface which cost $1,133,150.50. These roads cross several wide streams of water by means of concrete or wood bridges. These bridges number eleven in all, of which eight are wood and three are cement. The wooden bridges cost about $195,000 and all the cement bridges cost about $650,000.
