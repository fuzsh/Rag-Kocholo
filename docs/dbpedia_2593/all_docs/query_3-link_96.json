In 1780 was around 139.6 thousand. • People moved to New Jersey because : • religious freedom • and the proprietors (Lord John Berkeley and Sir Gorge Carteret) offered large tracts of land which was ideal for growing cash crops • a trial by jury • and a representative assembly that would make local laws and set tax rates.\n\nStructure of Society • Political: it was a royal colony with a governor appointed by the king • Slaves (12% of NJ population) • Prior to 1750 • a. Small Upper-class: • . Aristocratic plantation owners in South dominated wealth and influence • ii. Merchants, lawyers, officials, and clergymen dominated the North • b. Yeoman farmers constituted the majority of the population owned land • c. Small merchants, manual workers, and hired hands: many did not own land • d. Indentured servants and jailbirds: limited to no influence"
