        "text": "John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville (born April 22, 1690—died January 2, 1763, Bath, Somerset, England) was an English statesman, a vigorous opponent of Robert Walpole (who was chief minister from 1721 to 1742). A leading minister from 1742 to 1744, Carteret directed England’s involvement against France in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48).\n\nThe son of George, 1st Baron Carteret, and Lady Grace Granville (created Countess Granville in 1715), he succeeded his father as Lord Carteret in 1695 at the age of five and entered the House of Lords in 1711. He was appointed secretary of state in 1722, but, because he voiced opposition to Walpole, he was sent away from London in 1724 to serve as lord lieutenant of Ireland. Upon his return in 1730 he became one of Walpole’s most eloquent and prominent critics in the House of Lords, attacking in particular Walpole’s policy of accommodation with Spain."
