        "text": "Pepy's Diary. 06 Jul 1667. Thence by coach home, and there wrote a few letters, and then to consult with my wife about going to Epsum to-morrow, sometimes designing to go and then again not; and at last it grew late and I bethought myself of business to employ me at home tomorrow, and so I did not go. This afternoon I met with Mr. Rolt, who tells me that he is going Cornett under Collonel Ingoldsby (age 49), being his old acquaintance, and Ingoldsby hath a troop now from under the King (age 37), and I think it is a handsome way for him, but it was an ominous thing, methought, just as he was bidding me his last adieu, his nose fell a-bleeding, which ran in my mind a pretty while after. This afternoon Sir Alexander Frazier (age 57), who was of council for Sir J. Minnes (age 68), and had given him over for a dead man, said to me at White Hall:-\"What\", says he, \"Sir J. Minnes (age 68) is dead\". I told him, \"No! but that there is hopes of his life\". Methought he looked very sillily after it, and went his way. Late home to supper, a little troubled at my not going to Epsum to-morrow, as I had resolved, especially having the Duke of York (age 33) and Sir W. Coventry (age 39) out of town, but it was my own fault and at last my judgment to stay, and so to supper and to bed. This day, with great satisfaction, I hear that my [his mother] Lady Jemimah is brought to bed, at Hinchingbroke [Map], of a boy.\n\nPepy's Diary. 27 Jul 1667. He tells me that the King (age 37) and Court were never in the world so bad as they are now for gaming, swearing, whoring, and drinking, and the most abominable vices that ever were in the world; so that all must come to nought. He told me that [his grandfather] Sir G. Carteret (age 57) was at this end of the town; so I went to visit him in Broad Street; and there he and I together: and he is mightily pleased with my [his mother] Lady Jem's having a son; and a mighty glad man he is. He [Sir George Carteret (age 57)] tells me, as to news, that the peace is now confirmed, and all that over. He says it was a very unhappy motion in the House the other day about the land-army; for, whether the King (age 37) hath a mind of his own to do the thing desired or no, his doing it will be looked upon as a thing done only in fear of the Parliament. He says that the Duke of York (age 33) is suspected to be the great man that is for raising of this army, and bringing things to be commanded by an army; but he believes that he is wronged, and says that he do know that he is wronged therein. He do say that the Court is in a way to ruin all for their pleasures; and says that he himself hath once taken the liberty to tell the King (age 37) the necessity of having, at least, a show of religion in the Government, and sobriety; and that it was that, that did set up and keep up Oliver, though he was the greatest rogue in the world, and that it is so fixed in the nature of the common Englishman that it will not out of him. He tells me that while all should be labouring to settle the Kingdom, they are at Court all in factions, some for and others against my Chancellor (age 58), and another for and against another man, and the King (age 37) adheres to no man, but this day delivers himself up to this, and the next to that, to the ruin of himself and business; that he is at the command of any woman like a slave, though he be the best man to the Queene (age 57) in the world, with so much respect, and never lies a night from her: but yet cannot command himself in the presence of a woman he likes. Having had this discourse, I parted, and home to dinner, and thence to the office all the afternoon to my great content very busy. It raining this day all day to our great joy, it having not rained, I think, this month before, so as the ground was everywhere so burned and dry as could be; and no travelling in the road or streets in London, for dust. At night late home to supper and to bed.\n\nOn 28 May 1672 [his father] Philip Carteret (age 31) and Winston Churchill were killed at Solebay, Southwold [Map].\n\n[his grandfather] Edward Montagu 1st Earl Sandwich (age 46) was killed. His son [his uncle] Edward Montagu 2nd Earl Sandwich (age 24) succeeded 2nd Earl Sandwich.\n\nGeorge Legge 1st Baron Dartmouth (age 25) fought.\n\nCharles Harbord (age 32) was killed. The inscription on his. Monument in Westminster Abbey [Map] reads ... Sr. Charles Harbord Knt. his Majesties Surveyor General, and First Lieutenant of the Royall James, under the most noble and illustrious captain Edward, Earle of Sandwich (age 46), Vice Admirall of England, which after a terrible fight maintained to admiration against a squadron of the Holland fleet for above six houres, neere the Suffolk coast, having put off two fireships, at last being utterly dissabled and few of her men remaining unhurt, was by a third unfortunately set on fire: but he (though he swam well) neglected to save himselfe as some did, and out of the perfect love to that worthy lord (whom for many yeares he had constantly accompanyed in all his honourable imployments, and in all the engagements of the former warr) dyed with him at the age of XXXIII, much bewailed of his father whom he never offended, and much beloved of all for his knowne piety, vertue, loyalty, fortitude and fidelity.\n\nCaptain John Cox was killed in action.\n\nAdmiral John Holmes (age 32) fought as commander of Rupert.\n\nThe Gloucester took part."
