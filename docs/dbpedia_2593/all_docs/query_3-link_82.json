I shall not he needed for an hour yet. Meanwhile I’ll go downstairs and snatch a bit of sleep, or talk to old Jane.”\n\nThe night was hot and sultry. Though the windows of the chamber were wide open, and the muslin curtains looped back, not a breath of air was stirring. Only the shrill chirp of the cicada and the muffled croaking of the frogs in some distant marsh broke the night silence. The heavy scent of magnolias, overpowering even the strong smell of drugs in the sickroom, suggested death and funeral wreaths, sorrow and tears, the long home, the last sleep. The major shivered with apprehension as the slender hand which he held in his own contracted nervously and in a spasm of pain clutched his fingers with a viselike grip.\n\nMajor Carteret, though dressed in brown linen, had thrown off his coat for greater comfort. The stifling heat, in spite of the palm-leaf fan which he plied mechanically, was scarcely less oppressive than his own thoughts. Long ago, while yet a mere boy in years, he had come back from Appomattox to find his family, one of the oldest and proudest in the state, hopelessly impoverished by the war,–even their ancestral home swallowed up in the common ruin. His elder brother had sacrificed his life on the bloody altar of the lost cause, and his father, broken and chagrined, died not many years later, leaving the major the last of his line. He had tried in various pursuits to gain a foothold in the new life, but with indifferent success until he won the hand of Olivia Merkell, whom he had seen grow from a small girl to glorious womanhood. With her money he had founded the Morning Chronicle, which he had made the leading organ of his party and the most influential paper in the State. The fine old house in which they lived was hers. In this very room she had first drawn the breath of life; it had been their nuptial chamber; and here, too, within a few hours, she might die, for it seemed impossible that one could long endure such frightful agony and live.\n\nOne cloud alone had marred the otherwise perfect serenity of their happiness. Olivia was childless. To have children to perpetuate the name of which he was so proud, to write it still higher on the roll of honor, had been his dearest hope. His disappointment had been proportionately keen. A few months ago this dead hope had revived, and altered the whole aspect of their lives. But as time went on, his wife’s age had begun to tell upon her, until even Dr. Price, the most cheerful and optimistic of physicians, had warned him, while hoping for the best, to be prepared for the worst. To add to the danger, Mrs. Carteret had only this day suffered from a nervous shock, which, it was feared, had hastened by several weeks the expected event.\n\nDr. Price went downstairs to the library, where a dim light was burning. An old black woman, dressed in a gingham frock, with a red bandana handkerchief coiled around her head by way of turban, was seated by an open window. She rose and curtsied as the doctor entered and dropped into a willow rocking-chair near her own.\n\n“How did this happen, Jane?” he asked in a subdued voice, adding, with assumed severity, “You ought to have taken better care of your mistress.”\n\n“Now look a-hyuh, Doctuh Price,” returned the old woman in an unctuous whisper, “you don’ wanter come talkin’ none er yo’ foolishness ’bout my not takin’ keer er Mis’ ‘Livy. _She_ never would ‘a’ said sech a thing! Seven er eight mont’s ago, w’en she sent fer me, I says ter her, says I:–\n\n“‘Lawd, Lawd, honey! You don’ tell me dat after all dese long w’ary years er waitin’ de good Lawd is done heared yo’ prayer an’ is gwine ter sen’ you de chile you be’n wantin’ so long an’ so bad? Bless his holy name! Will I come an’ nuss yo’ baby? Why, honey, I nussed you, an’ nussed yo’ mammy thoo her las’ sickness, an’ laid her out w’en she died. I wouldn’ _let_ nobody e’se nuss yo’ baby; an’ mo’over, I’m gwine ter come an’ nuss you too. You’re young side er me, Mis’ ‘Livy, but you’re ove’ly ole ter be havin’ yo’ fus’ baby, an’ you’ll need somebody roun’, honey, w’at knows all ’bout de fam’ly, an’ deir ways an’ deir weaknesses, an’ I don’ know who dat’d be ef it wa’n’t me.’\n\n“”Deed, Mammy Jane,’ says she, ‘dere ain’ nobody e’se I’d have but you. You kin come ez soon ez you wanter an’ stay ez long ez you mineter.’\n\n“An hyuh I is, an’ hyuh I’m gwine ter stay. Fer Mis’ ‘Livy is my ole mist’ess’s daughter, an’ my ole mist’ess wuz good ter me, an’ dey ain’ none er her folks gwine ter suffer ef ole Jane kin he’p it.”\n\n“Your loyalty does you credit, Jane,” observed the doctor; “but you haven’t told me yet what happened to Mrs. Carteret to-day. Did the horse run away, or did she see something that frightened her?”\n\n“No, suh, de hoss didn’ git skeered at nothin’, but Mis’ ‘Livy did see somethin’, er somebody; an’ it wa’n’t no fault er mine ner her’n neither,–it goes fu’ther back, suh, fu’ther dan dis day er dis year. Does you ‘member de time w’en my ole mist’ess, Mis’ ‘Livy upstairs’s mammy, died? No? Well, you wuz prob’ly ‘way ter school den, studyin’ ter be a doctuh. But I’ll tell you all erbout it.\n\n“Wen my ole mist’ess, Mis’ ‘Liz’beth Merkell,–an’ a good mist’ess she wuz,–tuck sick fer de las’ time, her sister Polly–ole Mis’ Polly Ochiltree w’at is now–come ter de house ter he’p nuss her. Mis’ ‘Livy upstairs yander wuz erbout six years ole den, de sweetes’ little angel you ever laid eyes on; an’ on her dyin’ bed Mis’ ‘Liz’beth ax’ Mis’ Polly fer ter stay hyuh an’ take keer er her chile, an’ Mis’ Polly she promise’. She wuz a widder fer de secon’ time, an’ didn’ have no child’en, an’ could jes’ as well come as not.\n\n“But dere wuz trouble after de fune’al, an’ it happen’ right hyuh in dis lib’ary. Mars Sam wuz settin’ by de table, w’en Mis’ Polly come downstairs, slow an’ solemn, an’ stood dere in de middle er de flo’, all in black, till Mars Sam sot a cheer fer her.\n\n“‘Well, Samuel,’ says she, ‘now dat we’ve done all we can fer po’ ‘Liz’beth, it only ‘mains fer us ter consider Olivia’s future.’\n\n“Mars Sam nodded his head, but didn’ say nothin’.\n\n“‘I don’ need ter tell you,’ says she,’ dat I am willin’ ter carry out de wishes er my dead sister, an’ sac’ifice my own comfo’t, an’ make myse’f yo’ housekeeper an’ yo’ child’s nuss, fer my dear sister’s sake. It wuz her dyin’ wish, an’ on it I will ac’, ef it is also yo’n.’\n\n“Mars Sam didn’ want Mis’ Polly ter come, suh; fur he didn’ like Mis’ Polly. He wuz skeered er Miss Polly.”\n\n“I don’t wonder,” yawned the doctor, “if she was anything like she is now.”\n\n“Wuss, suh, fer she wuz younger, an’ stronger. She always would have her say, no matter ’bout what, an’ her own way, no matter who ‘posed her. She had already be’n in de house fer a week, an’ Mars Sam knowed ef she once come ter stay, she’d be de mist’ess of eve’ybody in it an’ him too. But w’at could he do but say yas?\n\n“‘Den it is unde’stood, is it,’ says Mis’ Polly, w’en he had spoke, ‘dat I am ter take cha’ge er de house?’\n\n“‘All right, Polly,’ says Mars Sam, wid a deep sigh.\n\n“Mis’ Polly ‘lowed he wuz sighin’ fer my po’ dead mist’ess, fer she didn’ have no idee er his feelin’s to’ds her,–she alluz did ‘low dat all de gent’emen wuz in love wid ‘er.\n\n“‘You won’ fin’ much ter do,’ Mars Sam went on, ‘fer Julia is a good housekeeper, an’ kin ten’ ter mos’ eve’ything, under yo’ d’rections.’\n\n“Mis’ Polly stiffen’ up like a ramrod. ‘It mus’ be unde’stood, Samuel,’ says she, ‘dat w’en I ‘sumes cha’ge er yo’ house, dere ain’ gwine ter be no ‘vided ‘sponsibility; an’ as fer dis Julia, me an’ her couldn’ git ‘long tergether nohow. Ef I stays, Julia goes.’\n\n“Wen Mars Sam beared dat, he felt better, an’ ‘mence’ ter pick up his courage. Mis’ Polly had showed her ban’ too plain. My mist’ess hadn’ got col’ yit, an’ Mis’ Polly, who’d be’n a widder fer two years dis las’ time, wuz already fig’rin’ on takin’ her place fer good, an’ she did n! want no other woman roun’ de house dat Mars Sam might take a’ intrus’ in.\n\n“‘My dear Polly,’ says Mars Sam, quite determine’, ‘I couldn’ possibly sen’ Julia ‘way. Fac’ is, I couldn’ git ‘long widout Julia. She’d be’n runnin’ dis house like clockwo’k befo’ you come, an’ I likes her ways. My dear, dead ‘Liz’beth sot a heap er sto’ by Julia, an’ I’m gwine ter keep her here fer ‘Liz’beth’s sake.’\n\n“Mis’ Polly’s eyes flash’ fire.\n\n“‘Ah,’ says she,’ I see–I see! You perfers her housekeepin’ ter mine, indeed! Dat is a fine way ter talk ter a lady! An’ a heap er rispec’ you is got fer de mem’ry er my po’ dead sister!’\n\n“Mars Sam knowed w’at she ‘lowed she seed wa’n’t so; but he didn’ let on, fer it only made him de safer. He wuz willin’ fer her ter ‘magine w’at she please’, jes’ so long ez she kep’ out er his house an’ let him alone.\n\n“‘No, Polly,’ says he, gittin’ bolder ez she got madder, ‘dere ain’ no use talkin’. Nothin’ in de worl’ would make me part wid Julia.’\n\n“Mis’ Polly she r’ared an’ she pitch’, but Mars Sam helt on like grim death. Mis’ Polly wouldn’ give in neither, an’ so she fin’lly went away. Dey made some kind er ‘rangement afterwa’ds, an’ Miss Polly tuck Mis’ ‘Livy ter her own house. Mars Sam paid her bo’d an’ ‘lowed Mis’ Polly somethin’ fer takin’ keer er her.”\n\n“And Julia stayed?”\n\n“Julia stayed, suh, an’ a couple er years later her chile wuz bawn, right here in dis house.”\n\n“But you said,” observed the doctor, “that Mrs. Ochiltree was in error about Julia.”\n\n“Yas, suh, so she wuz, w’en my ole mist’ess died. But dis wuz two years after,–an’ w’at has ter be has ter be. Julia had a easy time; she had a black gal ter wait on her, a buggy to ride in, an’ eve’ything she wanted. Eve’ybody s’posed Mars Sam would give her a house an’ lot, er leave her somethin’ in his will. But he died suddenly, and didn’ leave no will, an’ Mis’ Polly got herse’f ‘pinted gyardeen ter young Mis’ ‘Livy, an’ driv Julia an’ her young un out er de house, an’ lived here in dis house wid Mis’ ‘Livy till Mis’ ‘Livy ma’ied Majah Carteret.”\n\n“And what became of Julia?” asked Dr. Price.\n\nSuch relations, the doctor knew very well, had been all too common in the old slavery days, and not a few of them had been projected into the new era. Sins, like snakes, die hard. The habits and customs of a people were not to be changed in a day, nor by the stroke of a pen. As family physician, and father confessor by brevet, Dr. Price had looked upon more than one hidden skeleton; and no one in town had had better opportunities than old Jane for learning the undercurrents in the lives of the old families.\n\n“Well,” resumed Jane, “eve’ybody s’posed, after w’at had happen’, dat Julia’d keep on livin’ easy, fer she wuz young an’ good-lookin’. But she didn’. She tried ter make a livin’ sewin’, but Mis’ Polly wouldn’ let de bes’ w’ite folks hire her. Den she tuck up washin’, but didn’ do no better at dat; an’ bimeby she got so discourage’ dat she ma’ied a shif’less yaller man, an’ died er consumption soon after,–an’ wuz ’bout ez well off, fer dis man couldn’ hardly feed her nohow.”\n\n“And the child?”\n\n“One er de No’the’n w’ite lady teachers at de mission school tuck a likin’ ter little Janet, an’ put her thoo school, an’ den sent her off ter de No’th fer ter study ter be a school teacher. W’en she come back, ‘stead er teachin’ she ma’ied ole Adam Miller’s son.”\n\n“The rich stevedore’s son, Dr. Miller?”\n\n“Yas, suh, dat’s de man,–you knows ‘im. Dis yer boy wuz jes’ gwine ‘way fer ter study ter be a doctuh, an’ he ma’ied dis Janet, an’ tuck her ‘way wid ‘im. Dey went off ter Europe, er Irope, er Orope, er somewhere er ‘nother, ‘way off yander, an’ come back here las’ year an’ sta’ted dis yer horspital an’ school fer ter train de black gals fer nusses.”\n\n“He’s a very good doctor, Jane, and is doing a useful work. Your chapter of family history is quite interesting,–I knew part of it before, in a general way; but you haven’t yet told me what brought on Mrs. Carteret’s trouble.”\n\n“I’m jes’ comin’ ter dat dis minute, suh,–w’at I be’n tellin’ you is all a part of it. Dis yer Janet, w’at’s Mis’ ‘Livy’s half-sister, is ez much like her ez ef dey wuz twins. Folks sometimes takes ’em fer one ernudder,–I s’pose it tickles Janet mos’ ter death, but it do make Mis’ ‘Livy rippin’. An’ den ‘way back yander jes’ after de wah, w’en de ole Carteret mansion had ter be sol’, Adam Miller bought it, an’ dis yer Janet an’ her husban’ is be’n livin’ in it ever sence ole Adam died, ’bout a year ago; an’ dat makes de majah mad, ‘ca’se he don’ wanter see cullud folks livin’ in de ole fam’ly mansion w’at he wuz bawn in. An’ mo’over, an’ dat’s de wust of all, w’iles Mis’ ‘Livy ain’ had no child’en befo’, dis yer sister er her’n is got a fine-lookin’ little yaller boy, w’at favors de fam’ly so dat ef Mis’ ‘Livy’d see de chile anywhere, it’d mos’ break her heart fer ter think ’bout her not havin’ no child’en herse’f. So ter-day, w’en Mis’ ‘Livy wuz out ridin’ an’ met dis yer Janet wid her boy, an’ w’en Mis’ ‘Livy got ter studyin’ ’bout her own chances, an’ how she mought not come thoo safe, she jes’ had a fit er hysterics right dere in de buggy. She wuz mos’ home, an’ William got her here, an’ you knows de res’.”\n\nMajor Carteret, from the head of the stairs, called the doctor anxiously.\n\n“You had better come along up now, Jane,” said the doctor.\n\nFor two long hours they fought back the grim spectre that stood by the bedside. The child was born at dawn. Both mother and child, the doctor said, would live.\n\n“Bless its ‘ittle hea’t!” exclaimed Mammy Jane, as she held up the tiny mite, which bore as much resemblance to mature humanity as might be expected of an infant which had for only a few minutes drawn the breath of life. “Bless its ‘ittle hea’t! it’s de we’y spit an’ image er its pappy!”\n\nThe doctor smiled. The major laughed aloud. Jane’s unconscious witticism, or conscious flattery, whichever it might be, was a welcome diversion from the tense strain of the last few hours.\n\n“Be that as it may,” said Dr. Price cheerfully, “and I’ll not dispute it, the child is a very fine boy,–a very fine boy, indeed! Take care of it, major,” he added with a touch of solemnity, “for your wife can never bear another.”\n\nWith the child’s first cry a refreshing breeze from the distant ocean cooled the hot air of the chamber; the heavy odor of the magnolias, with its mortuary suggestiveness, gave place to the scent of rose and lilac and honeysuckle. The birds in the garden were singing lustily.\n\nAll these sweet and pleasant things found an echo in the major’s heart. He stood by the window, and looking toward the rising sun, breathed a silent prayer of thanksgiving. All nature seemed to rejoice in sympathy with his happiness at the fruition of this long-deferred hope, and to predict for this wonderful child a bright and glorious future.\n\nOld Mammy Jane, however, was not entirely at ease concerning the child. She had discovered, under its left ear, a small mole, which led her to fear that the child was born for bad luck. Had the baby been black, or yellow, or poor-white, Jane would unhesitatingly have named, as his ultimate fate, a not uncommon form of taking off, usually resultant upon the infraction of certain laws, or, in these swift modern days, upon too violent a departure from established social customs. It was manifestly impossible that a child of such high quality as the grandson of her old mistress should die by judicial strangulation; but nevertheless the warning was a serious thing, and not to be lightly disregarded.\n\nNot wishing to be considered as a prophet of evil omen, Jane kept her own counsel in regard to this significant discovery. But later, after the child was several days old, she filled a small vial with water in which the infant had been washed, and took it to a certain wise old black woman, who lived on the farther edge of the town and was well known to be versed in witchcraft and conjuration. The conjure woman added to the contents of the bottle a bit of calamus root, and one of the cervical vertebrae from the skeleton of a black cat, with several other mysterious ingredients, the nature of which she did not disclose. Following instructions given her, Aunt Jane buried the bottle in Carteret’s back yard, one night during the full moon, as a good-luck charm to ward off evil from the little grandson of her dear mistress, so long since dead and gone to heaven.\n\nII\n\nTHE CHRISTENING PARTY\n\nThey named the Carteret baby Theodore Felix. Theodore was a family name, and had been borne by the eldest son for several generations, the major himself being a second son. Having thus given the child two beautiful names, replete with religious and sentimental significance, they called him–“Dodie.”\n\nThe baby was christened some six weeks after its birth, by which time Mrs. Carteret was able to be out. Old Mammy Jane, who had been brought up in the church, but who, like some better informed people in all ages, found religion not inconsistent with a strong vein of superstition, felt her fears for the baby’s future much relieved when the rector had made the sign of the cross and sprinkled little Dodie with the water from the carved marble font, which had come from England in the reign of King Charles the Martyr, as the ill-fated son of James I. was known to St. Andrew’s. Upon this special occasion Mammy Jane had been provided with a seat downstairs among the white people, to her own intense satisfaction, and to the secret envy of a small colored attendance in the gallery, to whom she was ostentatiously pointed out by her grandson Jerry, porter at the Morning Chronicle office, who sat among them in the front row.\n\nOn the following Monday evening the major gave a christening party in honor of this important event. Owing to Mrs. Carteret’s still delicate health, only a small number of intimate friends and family connections were invited to attend. These were the rector of St. Andrew’s; old Mrs. Polly Ochiltree, the godmother; old Mr. Delamere, a distant relative and also one of the sponsors; and his grandson, Tom Delamere. The major had also invited Lee Ellis, his young city editor, for whom he had a great liking apart from his business value, and who was a frequent visitor at the house. These, with the family itself, which consisted of the major, his wife, and his half-sister, Clara Pemberton, a young woman of about eighteen, made up the eight persons for whom covers were laid.\n\nEllis was the first to arrive, a tall, loose-limbed young man, with a slightly freckled face, hair verging on auburn, a firm chin, and honest gray eyes. He had come half an hour early, and was left alone for a few minutes in the parlor, a spacious, high-ceilinged room, with large windows, and fitted up in excellent taste, with stately reminiscences of a past generation. The walls were hung with figured paper. The ceiling was whitewashed, and decorated in the middle with a plaster centre-piece, from which hung a massive chandelier sparkling with prismatic rays from a hundred crystal pendants. There was a handsome mantel, set with terra-cotta tiles, on which fauns and satyrs, nymphs and dryads, disported themselves in idyllic abandon. The furniture was old, and in keeping with the room.\n\nAt seven o’clock a carriage drove up, from which alighted an elderly gentleman, with white hair and mustache, and bowed somewhat with years. Short of breath and painfully weak in the legs, he was assisted from the carriage by a colored man, apparently about forty years old, to whom short side-whiskers and spectacles imparted an air of sobriety. This attendant gave his arm respectfully to the old gentleman, who leaned upon it heavily, but with as little appearance of dependence as possible. The servant, assuming a similar unconsciousness of the weight resting upon his arm, assisted the old gentleman carefully up the steps.\n\n“I’m all right now, Sandy,” whispered the gentleman as soon as his feet were planted firmly on the piazza. “You may come back for me at nine o’clock.”\n\nHaving taken his hand from his servant’s arm, he advanced to meet a lady who stood in the door awaiting him, a tall, elderly woman, gaunt and angular of frame, with a mottled face, and high cheekbones partially covered by bands of hair entirely too black and abundant for a person of her age, if one might judge from the lines of her mouth, which are rarely deceptive in such matters.\n\n“Perhaps you’d better not send your man away, Mr. Delamere,” observed the lady, in a high shrill voice, which grated upon the old gentleman’s ears. He was slightly hard of hearing, but, like most deaf people, resented being screamed at. “You might need him before nine o’clock. One never knows what may happen after one has had the second stroke. And moreover, our butler has fallen down the back steps–negroes are so careless!–and sprained his ankle so that he can’t stand. I’d like to have Sandy stay and wait on the table in Peter’s place, if you don’t mind.”\n\n“I thank you, Mrs. Ochiltree, for your solicitude,” replied Mr. Delamere, with a shade of annoyance in his voice, “but my health is very good just at present, and I do not anticipate any catastrophe which will require my servant’s presence before I am ready to go home. But I have no doubt, madam,” he continued, with a courteous inclination, “that Sandy will be pleased to serve you, if you desire it, to the best of his poor knowledge.”\n\n“I shill be honored, ma’am,” assented Sandy, with a bow even deeper than his master’s, “only I’m ‘feared I ain’t rightly dressed fer ter wait on table. I wuz only goin’ ter pra’r-meetin’, an’ so I didn’ put on my bes’ clo’s. Ef Mis’ Ochiltree ain’ gwine ter need me fer de nex’ fifteen minutes, I kin ride back home in de ca’ige an’ dress myse’f suitable fer de occasion, suh.”\n\n“If you think you’ll wait on the table any better,” said Mrs. Ochiltree, “you may go along and change your clothes; but hurry back, for it is seven now, and dinner will soon be served.”\n\nSandy retired with a bow. While descending the steps to the carriage, which had waited for him, he came face to face with a young man just entering the house.\n\n“Am I in time for dinner, Sandy?” asked the newcomer.\n\n“Yas, Mistuh Tom, you’re in plenty er time. Dinner won’t be ready till _I_ git back, which won’ be fer fifteen minutes er so yit.”\n\nThrowing away the cigarette which he held between his fingers, the young man crossed the piazza with a light step, and after a preliminary knock, for an answer to which he did not wait, entered the house with the air of one thoroughly at home. The lights in the parlor had been lit, and Ellis, who sat talking to Major Carteret when the newcomer entered, covered him with a jealous glance.\n\nSlender and of medium height, with a small head of almost perfect contour, a symmetrical face, dark almost to swarthiness, black eyes, which moved somewhat restlessly, curly hair of raven tint, a slight mustache, small hands and feet, and fashionable attire, Tom Delamere, the grandson of the old gentleman who had already arrived, was easily the handsomest young man in Wellington. But no discriminating observer would have characterized his beauty as manly. It conveyed no impression of strength, but did possess a certain element, feline rather than feminine, which subtly negatived the idea of manliness.\n\nHe gave his hand to the major, nodded curtly to Ellis, saluted his grandfather respectfully, and inquired for the ladies.\n\n“Olivia is dressing for dinner,” replied the major; “Mrs. Ochiltree is in the kitchen, struggling with the servants. Clara–Ah, here she comes now!”\n\nEllis, whose senses were preternaturally acute where Clara was concerned, was already looking toward the hall and was the first to see her. Clad in an evening gown of simple white, to the close-fitting corsage of which she had fastened a bunch of pink roses, she was to Ellis a dazzling apparition. To him her erect and well-moulded form was the embodiment of symmetry, her voice sweet music, her movements the perfection of grace; and it scarcely needed a lover’s imagination to read in her fair countenance a pure heart and a high spirit,–the truthfulness that scorns a lie, the pride which is not haughtiness. There were suggestive depths of tenderness, too, in the curl of her lip, the droop of her long lashes, the glance of her blue eyes,–depths that Ellis had long since divined, though he had never yet explored them. She gave Ellis a friendly nod as she came in, but for the smile with which she greeted Delamere, Ellis would have given all that he possessed,–not a great deal, it is true, but what could a man do more?\n\n“You are the last one, Tom,” she said reproachfully. “Mr. Ellis has been here half an hour.”\n\nDelamere threw a glance at Ellis which was not exactly friendly. Why should this fellow always be on hand to emphasize his own shortcomings?\n\n“The rector is not here,” answered Tom triumphantly. “You see I am not the last.”\n\n“The rector,” replied Clara, “was called out of town at six o’clock this evening, to visit a dying man, and so cannot be here. You are the last, Tom, and Mr. Ellis was the first.”\n\nEllis was ruefully aware that this comparison in his favor was the only visible advantage that he had gained from his early arrival. He had not seen Miss Pemberton a moment sooner by reason of it. There had been a certain satisfaction in being in the same house with her, but Delamere had arrived in time to share or, more correctly, to monopolize, the sunshine of her presence.\n\nDelamere gave a plausible excuse which won Clara’s pardon and another enchanting smile, which pierced Ellis like a dagger. He knew very well that Delamere’s excuse was a lie. Ellis himself had been ready as early as six o’clock, but judging this to be too early, had stopped in at the Clarendon Club for half an hour, to look over the magazines. While coming out he had glanced into the card-room, where he had seen his rival deep in a game of cards, from which Delamere had evidently not been able to tear himself until the last moment. He had accounted for his lateness by a story quite inconsistent with these facts.\n\nThe two young people walked over to a window on the opposite side of the large room, where they stood talking to one another in low tones. The major had left the room for a moment. Old Mr. Delamere, who was watching his grandson and Clara with an indulgent smile, proceeded to rub salt into Ellis’s wounds.\n\n“They make a handsome couple,” he observed. “I remember well when her mother, in her youth an ideally beautiful woman, of an excellent family, married Daniel Pemberton, who was not of so good a family, but had made money. The major, who was only a very young man then, disapproved of the match; he considered that his mother, although a widow and nearly forty, was marrying beneath her. But he has been a good brother to Clara, and a careful guardian of her estate. Ah, young gentleman, you cannot appreciate, except in imagination, what it means, to one standing on the brink of eternity, to feel sure that he will live on in his children and his children’s children!”\n\nEllis was appreciating at that moment what it meant, in cold blood, with no effort of the imagination, to see the girl whom he loved absorbed completely in another man. She had looked at him only once since Tom Delamere had entered the room, and then merely to use him as a spur with which to prick his favored rival.\n\n“Yes, sir,” he returned mechanically, “Miss Clara is a beautiful young lady.”\n\n“And Tom is a good boy–a fine boy,” returned the old gentleman. “I am very well pleased with Tom, and shall be entirely happy when I see them married.”\n\nEllis could not echo this sentiment. The very thought of this marriage made him miserable. He had always understood that the engagement was merely tentative, a sort of family understanding, subject to confirmation after Delamere should have attained his majority, which was still a year off, and when the major should think Clara old enough to marry. Ellis saw Delamere with the eye of a jealous rival, and judged him mercilessly,–whether correctly or not the sequel will show. He did not at all believe that Tom Delamere would make a fit husband for Clara Pemberton; but his opinion would have had no weight,–he could hardly have expressed it without showing his own interest. Moreover, there was no element of the sneak in Lee Ellis’s make-up. The very fact that he might profit by the other’s discomfiture left Delamere secure, so far as he could be affected by anything that Ellis might say. But Ellis did not shrink from a fair fight, and though in this one the odds were heavily against him, yet so long as this engagement remained indefinite, so long, indeed, as the object of his love was still unwed, he would not cease to hope. Such a sacrifice as this marriage clearly belonged in the catalogue of impossibilities. Ellis had not lived long enough to learn that impossibilities are merely things of which we have not learned, or which we do not wish to happen.\n\nSandy returned at the end of a quarter of an hour, and dinner was announced. Mr. Delamere led the way to the dining-room with Mrs. Ochiltree. Tom followed with Clara. The major went to the head of the stairs and came down with Mrs. Carteret upon his arm, her beauty rendered more delicate by the pallor of her countenance and more complete by the happiness with which it glowed. Ellis went in alone. In the rector’s absence it was practically a family party which sat down, with the exception of Ellis, who, as we have seen, would willingly have placed himself in the same category.\n\nThe table was tastefully decorated with flowers, which grew about the house in lavish profusion. In warm climates nature adorns herself with true feminine vanity.\n\n“What a beautiful table!” exclaimed Tom, before they were seated.\n\n“The decorations are mine,” said Clara proudly. “I cut the flowers and arranged them all myself.”\n\n“Which accounts for the admirable effect,” rejoined Tom with a bow, before Ellis, to whom the same thought had occurred, was able to express himself. He had always counted himself the least envious of men, but for this occasion he coveted Tom Delamere’s readiness.\n\n“The beauty of the flowers,” observed old Mr. Delamere, with sententious gallantry, “is reflected upon all around them. It is a handsome company.”\n\nMrs. Ochiltree beamed upon the table with a dry smile.\n\n“I don’t perceive any effect that it has upon you or me,” she said; “And as for the young people, ‘Handsome is as handsome does.’ If Tom here, for instance, were as good as he looks”–\n\n“You flatter me, Aunt Polly,” Tom broke in hastily, anticipating the crack of the whip; he was familiar with his aunt’s conversational idiosyncrasies.\n\n“If you are as good as you look,” continued the old lady, with a cunning but indulgent smile, “some one has been slandering you.”\n\n“Thanks, Aunt Polly! Now you don’t flatter me.”\n\n“There is Mr. Ellis,” Mrs. Ochiltree went on, “who is not half so good-looking, but is steady as a clock, I dare say.”\n\n“Now, Aunt Polly,” interposed Mrs. Carteret, “let the gentlemen alone.”\n\n“She doesn’t mean half what she says,” continued Mrs. Carteret apologetically, “and only talks that way to people whom she likes.”\n\nTom threw Mrs. Carteret a grateful glance. He had been apprehensive, with the sensitiveness of youth, lest his old great-aunt should make a fool of him before Clara’s family. Nor had he relished the comparison with Ellis, who was out of place, anyway, in this family party. He had never liked the fellow, who was too much of a plodder and a prig to make a suitable associate for a whole-souled, generous-hearted young gentleman. He tolerated him as a visitor at Carteret’s and as a member of the Clarendon Club, but that was all.\n\n“Mrs. Ochiltree has a characteristic way of disguising her feelings,” observed old Mr. Delamere, with a touch of sarcasm.\n\nEllis had merely flushed and felt uncomfortable at the reference to himself. The compliment to his character hardly offset the reflection upon his looks. He knew he was not exactly handsome, but it was not pleasant to have the fact emphasized in the presence of the girl he loved; he would like at least fair play, and judgment upon the subject left to the young lady.\n\nMrs. Ochiltree was quietly enjoying herself. In early life she had been accustomed to impale fools on epigrams, like flies on pins, to see them wriggle. But with advancing years she had lost in some measure the faculty of nice discrimination,–it was pleasant to see her victims squirm, whether they were fools or friends. Even one’s friends, she argued, were not always wise, and were sometimes the better for being told the truth. At her niece’s table she felt at liberty to speak her mind, which she invariably did, with a frankness that sometimes bordered on brutality. She had long ago outgrown the period where ambition or passion, or its partners, envy and hatred, were springs of action in her life, and simply retained a mild enjoyment in the exercise of an old habit, with no active malice whatever. The ruling passion merely grew stronger as the restraining faculties decreased in vigor.\n\nA diversion was created at this point by the appearance of old Mammy Jane, dressed in a calico frock, with clean white neckerchief and apron, carrying the wonderful baby in honor of whose naming this feast had been given. Though only six weeks old, the little Theodore had grown rapidly, and Mammy Jane declared was already quite large for his age, and displayed signs of an unusually precocious intelligence. He was passed around the table and duly admired. Clara thought his hair was fine. Ellis inquired about his teeth. Tom put his finger in the baby’s fist to test his grip. Old Mr. Delamere was unable to decide as yet whether he favored most his father or his mother. The object of these attentions endured them patiently for several minutes, and then protested with a vocal vigor which led to his being taken promptly back upstairs. Whatever fate might be in store for him, he manifested no sign of weak lungs.\n\n“Sandy,” said Mrs. Carteret when the baby had retired, “pass that tray standing upon the side table, so that we may all see the presents.”\n\nMr. Delamere had brought a silver spoon, and Tom a napkin ring. Ellis had sent a silver watch; it was a little premature, he admitted, but the boy would grow to it, and could use it to play with in the mean time. It had a glass back, so that he might see the wheels go round. Mrs. Ochiltree’s present was an old and yellow ivory rattle, with a handle which the child could bite while teething, and a knob screwed on at the end to prevent the handle from slipping through the baby’s hand.\n\n“I saw that in your cedar chest, Aunt Polly,” said Clara, “when I was a little girl, and you used to pull the chest out from under your bed to get me a dime.”\n\n“You kept the rattle in the right-hand corner of the chest,” said Tom, “in the box with the red silk purse, from which you took the gold piece you gave me every Christmas.”\n\nA smile shone on Mrs. Ochiltree’s severe features at this appreciation, like a ray of sunlight on a snowbank.\n\n“Aunt Polly’s chest is like the widow’s cruse,” said Mrs. Carteret, “which was never empty.”\n\n“Or Fortunatus’s purse, which was always full,” added old Mr. Delamere, who read the Latin poets, and whose allusions were apt to be classical rather than scriptural.\n\n“It will last me while I live,” said Mrs. Ochiltree, adding cautiously, “but there’ll not be a great deal left. It won’t take much to support an old woman for twenty years.”\n\nMr. Delamere’s man Sandy had been waiting upon the table with the decorum of a trained butler, and a gravity all his own. He had changed his suit of plain gray for a long blue coat with brass buttons, which dated back to the fashion of a former generation, with which he wore a pair of plaid trousers of strikingly modern cut and pattern. With his whiskers, his spectacles, and his solemn air of responsibility, he would have presented, to one unfamiliar with the negro type, an amusingly impressive appearance. But there was nothing incongruous about Sandy to this company, except perhaps to Tom Delamere, who possessed a keen eye for contrasts and always regarded Sandy, in that particular rig, as a very comical darkey.\n\n“Is it quite prudent, Mrs. Ochiltree,” suggested the major at a moment when Sandy, having set down the tray, had left the room for a little while, “to mention, in the presence of the servants, that you keep money in the house?”\n\n“I beg your pardon, major,” observed old Mr. Delamere, with a touch of stiffness. “The only servant in hearing of the conversation has been my own; and Sandy is as honest as any man in Wellington.”\n\n“You mean, sir,” replied Carteret, with a smile, “as honest as any negro in Wellington.”\n\n“I make no exceptions, major,” returned the old gentleman, with emphasis. “I would trust Sandy with my life,–he saved it once at the risk of his own.”\n\n“No doubt,” mused the major, “the negro is capable of a certain doglike fidelity,–I make the comparison in a kindly sense,–a certain personal devotion which is admirable in itself, and fits him eminently for a servile career. I should imagine, however, that one could more safely trust his life with a negro than his portable property.”\n\n“Very clever, major! I read your paper, and know that your feeling is hostile toward the negro, but”–\n\nThe major made a gesture of dissent, but remained courteously silent until Mr. Delamere had finished.\n\n“For my part,” the old gentleman went on, “I think they have done very well, considering what they started from, and their limited opportunities. There was Adam Miller, for instance, who left a comfortable estate. His son George carries on the business, and the younger boy, William, is a good doctor and stands well with his profession. His hospital is a good thing, and if my estate were clear, I should like to do something for it.”\n\n“You are mistaken, sir, in imagining me hostile to the negro,” explained Carteret. “On the contrary, I am friendly to his best interests. I give him employment; I pay taxes for schools to educate him, and for court-houses and jails to keep him in order. I merely object to being governed by an inferior and servile race.”\n\nMrs. Carteret’s face wore a tired expression. This question was her husband’s hobby, and therefore her own nightmare. Moreover, she had her personal grievance against the negro race, and the names mentioned by old Mr. Delamere had brought it vividly before her mind. She had no desire to mar the harmony of the occasion by the discussion of a distasteful subject.\n\nMr. Delamere, glancing at his hostess, read something of this thought, and refused the challenge to further argument.\n\n“I do not believe, major,” he said, “that Olivia relishes the topic. I merely wish to say that Sandy is an exception to any rule which you may formulate in derogation of the negro. Sandy is a gentleman in ebony!”\n\nTom could scarcely preserve his gravity at this characterization of old Sandy, with his ridiculous air of importance, his long blue coat, and his loud plaid trousers. That suit would make a great costume for a masquerade. He would borrow it some time,–there was nothing in the world like it.\n\n“Well, Mr. Delamere,” returned the major good-humoredly, “no doubt Sandy is an exceptionally good negro,–he might well be, for he has had the benefit of your example all his life,–and we know that he is a faithful servant. But nevertheless, if I were Mrs. Ochiltree, I should put my money in the bank. Not all negroes are as honest as Sandy, and an elderly lady might not prove a match for a burly black burglar.”\n\n“Thank you, major,” retorted Mrs. Ochiltree, with spirit, “I’m not yet too old to take care of myself. That cedar chest has been my bank for forty years, and I shall not change my habits at my age.”\n\nAt this moment Sandy reentered the room. Carteret made a warning gesture, which Mrs. Ochiltree chose not to notice.\n\n“I’ve proved a match for two husbands, and am not afraid of any man that walks the earth, black or white, by day or night. I have a revolver, and know how to use it. Whoever attempts to rob me will do so at his peril.”\n\nAfter dinner Clara played the piano and sang duets with Tom Delamere. At nine o’clock Mr. Delamere’s carriage came for him, and he went away accompanied by Sandy. Under cover of the darkness the old gentleman leaned on his servant’s arm with frank dependence, and Sandy lifted him into the carriage with every mark of devotion.\n\nEllis had already excused himself to go to the office and look over the late proofs for the morning paper. Tom remained a few minutes longer than his grandfather, and upon taking his leave went round to the Clarendon Club, where he spent an hour or two in the card-room with a couple of congenial friends. Luck seemed to favor him, and he went home at midnight with a comfortable balance of winnings. He was fond of excitement, and found a great deal of it in cards. To lose was only less exciting than to win. Of late he had developed into a very successful player,–so successful, indeed, that several members of the club generally found excuses to avoid participating in a game where he made one.\n\nIII\n\nTHE EDITOR AT WORK\n\nTo go back a little, for several days after his child’s birth Major Carteret’s chief interest in life had been confined to the four walls of the chamber where his pale wife lay upon her bed of pain, and those of the adjoining room where an old black woman crooned lovingly over a little white infant. A new element had been added to the major’s consciousness, broadening the scope and deepening the strength of his affections. He did not love Olivia the less, for maternity had crowned her wifehood with an added glory; but side by side with this old and tried attachment was a new passion, stirring up dormant hopes and kindling new desires. His regret had been more than personal at the thought that with himself an old name should be lost to the State; and now all the old pride of race, class, and family welled up anew, and swelled and quickened the current of his life.\n\nUpon the major’s first appearance at the office, which took place the second day after the child’s birth, he opened a box of cigars in honor of the event. The word had been passed around by Ellis, and the whole office force, including reporters, compositors, and pressmen, came in to congratulate the major and smoke at his expense. Even Jerry, the colored porter,–Mammy Jane’s grandson and therefore a protege of the family,–presented himself among the rest, or rather, after the rest. The major shook hands with them all except Jerry, though he acknowledged the porter’s congratulations with a kind nod and put a good cigar into his outstretched palm, for which Jerry thanked him without manifesting any consciousness of the omission. He was quite aware that under ordinary circumstances the major would not have shaken hands with white workingmen, to say nothing of negroes; and he had merely hoped that in the pleasurable distraction of the moment the major might also overlook the distinction of color. Jerry’s hope had been shattered, though not rudely; for the major had spoken pleasantly and the cigar was a good one. Mr. Ellis had once shaken hands with Jerry,–but Mr. Ellis was a young man, whose Quaker father had never owned any slaves, and he could not be expected to have as much pride as one of the best “quality,” whose families had possessed land and negroes for time out of mind. On the whole, Jerry preferred the careless nod of the editor-in-chief to the more familiar greeting of the subaltern.\n\nHaving finished this pleasant ceremony, which left him with a comfortable sense of his new dignity, the major turned to his desk. It had been much neglected during the week, and more than one matter claimed his attention; but as typical of the new trend of his thoughts, the first subject he took up was one bearing upon the future of his son. Quite obviously the career of a Carteret must not be left to chance,–it must be planned and worked out with a due sense of the value of good blood.\n\nThere lay upon his desk a letter from a well-known promoter, offering the major an investment which promised large returns, though several years must elapse before the enterprise could be put upon a paying basis. The element of time, however, was not immediately important. The Morning Chronicle provided him an ample income. The money available for this investment was part of his wife’s patrimony. It was invested in a local cotton mill, which was paying ten per cent., but this was a beggarly return compared with the immense profits promised by the offered investment,–profits which would enable his son, upon reaching manhood, to take a place in the world commensurate with the dignity of his ancestors, one of whom, only a few generations removed, had owned an estate of ninety thousand acres of land and six thousand slaves.\n\nThis letter having been disposed of by an answer accepting the offer, the major took up his pen to write an editorial. Public affairs in the state were not going to his satisfaction. At the last state election his own party, after an almost unbroken rule of twenty years, had been defeated by the so-called “Fusion” ticket, a combination of Republicans and Populists. A clean sweep had been made of the offices in the state, which were now filled by new men. Many of the smaller places had gone to colored men, their people having voted almost solidly for the Fusion ticket. In spite of the fact that the population of Wellington was two thirds colored, this state of things was gall and wormwood to the defeated party, of which the Morning Chronicle was the acknowledged organ. Major Carteret shared this feeling. Only this very morning, while passing the city hall, on his way to the office, he had seen the steps of that noble building disfigured by a fringe of job-hunting negroes, for all the world–to use a local simile–like a string of buzzards sitting on a rail, awaiting their opportunity to batten upon the helpless corpse of a moribund city.\n\nTaking for his theme the unfitness of the negro to participate in government,–an unfitness due to his limited education, his lack of experience, his criminal tendencies, and more especially to his hopeless mental and physical inferiority to the white race,–the major had demonstrated, it seemed to him clearly enough, that the ballot in the hands of the negro was a menace to the commonwealth. He had argued, with entire conviction, that the white and black races could never attain social and political harmony by commingling their blood; he had proved by several historical parallels that no two unassimilable races could ever live together except in the relation of superior and inferior; and he was just dipping his gold pen into the ink to indite his conclusions from the premises thus established, when Jerry, the porter, announced two visitors.\n\n“Gin’l Belmont an’ Cap’n McBane would like ter see you, suh.”\n\n“Show them in, Jerry.”\n\nThe man who entered first upon this invitation was a dapper little gentleman with light-blue eyes and a Vandyke beard. He wore a frock coat, patent leather shoes, and a Panama hat. There were crow’s-feet about his eyes, which twinkled with a hard and, at times, humorous shrewdness. He had sloping shoulders, small hands and feet, and walked with the leisurely step characteristic of those who have been reared under hot suns.\n\nCarteret gave his hand cordially to the gentleman thus described.\n\n“How do you do, Captain McBane,” he said, turning to the second visitor.\n\nThe individual thus addressed was strikingly different in appearance from his companion. His broad shoulders, burly form, square jaw, and heavy chin betokened strength, energy, and unscrupulousness. With the exception of a small, bristling mustache, his face was clean shaven, with here and there a speck of dried blood due to a carelessly or unskillfully handled razor. A single deep-set gray eye was shadowed by a beetling brow, over which a crop of coarse black hair, slightly streaked with gray, fell almost low enough to mingle with his black, bushy eyebrows. His coat had not been brushed for several days, if one might judge from the accumulation of dandruff upon the collar, and his shirt-front, in the middle of which blazed a showy diamond, was plentifully stained with tobacco juice. He wore a large slouch hat, which, upon entering the office, he removed and held in his hand.\n\nHaving greeted this person with an unconscious but quite perceptible diminution of the warmth with which he had welcomed the other, the major looked around the room for seats for his visitors, and perceiving only one chair, piled with exchanges, and a broken stool propped against the wall, pushed a button, which rang a bell in the hall, summoning the colored porter to his presence.\n\n“Jerry,” said the editor when his servant appeared, “bring a couple of chairs for these gentlemen.”\n\nWhile they stood waiting, the visitors congratulated the major on the birth of his child, which had been announced in the Morning Chronicle, and which the prominence of the family made in some degree a matter of public interest.\n\n“And now that you have a son, major,” remarked the gentleman first described, as he lit one of the major’s cigars, “you’ll be all the more interested in doing something to make this town fit to live in, which is what we came up to talk about. Things are in an awful condition! A negro justice of the peace has opened an office on Market Street, and only yesterday summoned a white man to appear before him. Negro lawyers get most of the business in the criminal court. Last evening a group of young white ladies, going quietly along the street arm-in-arm, were forced off the sidewalk by a crowd of negro girls. Coming down the street just now, I saw a spectacle of social equality and negro domination that made my blood boil with indignation,–a white and a black convict, chained together, crossing the city in charge of a negro officer! We cannot stand that sort of thing, Carteret,–it is the last straw! Something must be done, and that quickly!”\n\nThe major thrilled with responsive emotion. There was something prophetic in this opportune visit. The matter was not only in his own thoughts, but in the air; it was the spontaneous revulsion of white men against the rule of an inferior race. These were the very men, above all others in the town, to join him in a movement to change these degrading conditions.\n\nGeneral Belmont, the smaller of the two, was a man of good family, a lawyer by profession, and took an active part in state and local politics. Aristocratic by birth and instinct, and a former owner of slaves, his conception of the obligations and rights of his caste was nevertheless somewhat lower than that of the narrower but more sincere Carteret. In serious affairs Carteret desired the approval of his conscience, even if he had to trick that docile organ into acquiescence. This was not difficult to do in politics, for he believed in the divine right of white men and gentlemen, as his ancestors had believed in and died for the divine right of kings. General Belmont was not without a gentleman’s distaste for meanness, but he permitted no fine scruples to stand in the way of success. He had once been minister, under a Democratic administration, to a small Central American state. Political rivals had characterized him as a tricky demagogue, which may of course have been a libel. He had an amiable disposition, possessed the gift of eloquence, and was a prime social favorite.\n\nCaptain George McBane had sprung from the poor-white class, to which, even more than to the slaves, the abolition of slavery had opened the door of opportunity. No longer overshadowed by a slaveholding caste, some of this class had rapidly pushed themselves forward. Some had made honorable records. Others, foremost in negro-baiting and election frauds, had done the dirty work of politics, as their fathers had done that of slavery, seeking their reward at first in minor offices,–for which men of gentler breeding did not care,–until their ambition began to reach out for higher honors.\n\nOf this class McBane–whose captaincy, by the way, was merely a polite fiction–had been one of the most successful. He had held, until recently, as the reward of questionable political services, a contract with the State for its convict labor, from which in a few years he had realized a fortune. But the methods which made his contract profitable had not commended themselves to humane people, and charges of cruelty and worse had been preferred against him. He was rich enough to escape serious consequences from the investigation which followed, but when the Fusion ticket carried the state he lost his contract, and the system of convict labor was abolished. Since then McBane had devoted himself to politics: he was ambitious for greater wealth, for office, and for social recognition. A man of few words and self-engrossed, he seldom spoke of his aspirations except where speech might favor them, preferring to seek his ends by secret “deals” and combinations rather than to challenge criticism and provoke rivalry by more open methods.\n\nAt sight, therefore, of these two men, with whose careers and characters he was entirely familiar, Carteret felt sweep over his mind the conviction that now was the time and these the instruments with which to undertake the redemption of the state from the evil fate which had befallen it.\n\nJerry, the porter, who had gone downstairs to the counting-room to find two whole chairs, now entered with one in each hand. He set a chair for the general, who gave him an amiable nod, to which Jerry responded with a bow and a scrape. Captain McBane made no acknowledgment, but fixed Jerry so fiercely with his single eye that upon placing the chair Jerry made his escape from the room as rapidly as possible.\n\n“I don’ like dat Cap’n McBane,” he muttered, upon reaching the hall. “Dey says he got dat eye knock’ out tryin’ ter whip a cullud ‘oman, when he wuz a boy, an’ dat he ain’ never had no use fer niggers sence,–‘cep’n’ fer what he could make outen ’em wid his convic’ labor contrac’s. His daddy wuz a’ overseer befo’ ‘im, an’ it come nachul fer him ter be a nigger-driver. I don’ want dat one eye er his’n restin’ on me no longer ‘n I kin he’p, an’ I don’ know how I’m gwine ter like dis job ef he’s gwine ter be comin’ roun’ here. He ain’ nothin’ but po’ w’ite trash nohow; but Lawd! Lawd! look at de money he’s got,–livin’ at de hotel, wearin’ di’mon’s, an’ colloguin’ wid de bes’ quality er dis town! ‘Pears ter me de bottom rail is gittin’ mighty close ter de top. Well, I s’pose it all comes f’m bein’ w’ite. I wush ter Gawd I wuz w’ite!”\n\nAfter this fervent aspiration, having nothing else to do for the time being, except to remain within call, and having caught a few words of the conversation as he went in with the chairs, Jerry, who possessed a certain amount of curiosity, placed close to the wall the broken stool upon which he sat while waiting in the hall, and applied his ear to a hole in the plastering of the hallway. There was a similar defect in the inner wall, between the same two pieces of studding, and while this inner opening was not exactly opposite the outer, Jerry was enabled, through the two, to catch in a more or less fragmentary way what was going on within.\n\nHe could hear the major, now and then, use the word “negro,” and McBane’s deep voice was quite audible when he referred, it seemed to Jerry with alarming frequency, to “the damned niggers,” while the general’s suave tones now and then pronounced the word “niggro,”–a sort of compromise between ethnology and the vernacular. That the gentlemen were talking politics seemed quite likely, for gentlemen generally talked politics when they met at the Chronicle office. Jerry could hear the words “vote,” “franchise,” “eliminate,” “constitution,” and other expressions which marked the general tenor of the talk, though he could not follow it all,–partly because he could not hear everything distinctly, and partly because of certain limitations which nature had placed in the way of Jerry’s understanding anything very difficult or abstruse.\n\nHe had gathered enough, however, to realize, in a vague way, that something serious was on foot, involving his own race, when a bell sounded over his head, at which he sprang up hastily and entered the room where the gentlemen were talking.\n\n“Jerry,” said the major, “wait on Captain McBane.”\n\n“Yas, suh,” responded Jerry, turning toward the captain, whose eye he carefully avoided meeting directly.\n\n“Take that half a dollar, boy,” ordered McBane, “an’ go ‘cross the street to Mr. Sykes’s, and tell him to send me three whiskies. Bring back the change, and make has’e.”\n\nThe captain tossed the half dollar at Jerry, who, looking to one side, of course missed it. He picked the money up, however, and backed out of the room. Jerry did not like Captain McBane, to begin with, and it was clear that the captain was no gentleman, or he would not have thrown the money at him. Considering the source, Jerry might have overlooked this discourtesy had it not been coupled with the remark about the change, which seemed to him in very poor taste.\n\nReturning in a few minutes with three glasses on a tray, he passed them round, handed Captain McBane his change, and retired to the hall.\n\n“Gentlemen,” exclaimed the captain, lifting his glass, “I propose a toast: ‘No nigger domination.'”\n\n“Amen!” said the others, and three glasses were solemnly drained.\n\n“Major,” observed the general, smacking his lips, “_I_ should like to use Jerry for a moment, if you will permit me.”\n\nJerry appeared promptly at the sound of the bell. He had remained conveniently near,–calls of this sort were apt to come in sequence.\n\n“Jerry,” said the general, handing Jerry half a dollar, “go over to Mr. Brown’s,–I get my liquor there,–and tell them to send me three glasses of my special mixture. And, Jerry,–you may keep the change!”\n\n“Thank y’, gin’l, thank y’, marster,” replied Jerry, with unctuous gratitude, bending almost double as he backed out of the room.\n\n“Dat’s a gent’eman, a rale ole-time gent’eman,” he said to himself when he had closed the door. “But dere’s somethin’ gwine on in dere,–dere sho’ is! ‘No nigger damnation!’ Dat soun’s all right,–I’m sho’ dere ain’ no nigger I knows w’at wants damnation, do’ dere’s lots of ’em w’at deserves it; but ef dat one-eyed Cap’n McBane got anything ter do wid it, w’atever it is, it don’ mean no good fer de niggers,–damnation’d be better fer ’em dan dat Cap’n McBane! He looks at a nigger lack he could jes’ eat ‘im alive.”\n\n“This mixture, gentlemen,” observed the general when Jerry had returned with the glasses, “was originally compounded by no less a person than the great John C. Calhoun himself, who confided the recipe to my father over the convivial board. In this nectar of the gods, gentlemen, I drink with you to ‘White Supremacy!'”\n\n“White Supremacy everywhere!” added McBane with fervor.\n\n“Now and forever!” concluded Carteret solemnly.\n\nWhen the visitors, half an hour later, had taken their departure, Carteret, inspired by the theme, and in less degree by the famous mixture of the immortal Calhoun, turned to his desk and finished, at a white heat, his famous editorial in which he sounded the tocsin of a new crusade.\n\nAt noon, when the editor, having laid down his pen, was leaving the office, he passed Jerry in the hall without a word or a nod. The major wore a rapt look, which Jerry observed with a vague uneasiness.\n\n“He looks jes’ lack he wuz walkin’ in his sleep,” muttered Jerry uneasily. “Dere’s somethin’ up, sho ‘s you bawn! ‘No nigger damnation!’ Anybody’d ‘low dey wuz all gwine ter heaven; but I knows better! W’en a passel er w’ite folks gits ter talkin’ ’bout de niggers lack dem in yander, it’s mo’ lackly dey’re gwine ter ketch somethin’ e’se dan heaven! I got ter keep my eyes open an’ keep up wid w’at’s happenin’. Ef dere’s gwine ter be anudder flood ‘roun’ here, I wants ter git in de ark wid de w’ite folks,–I may haf ter be anudder Ham, an’ sta’t de cullud race all over ag’in.”\n\nIV\n\nTHEODORE FELIX\n\nThe young heir of the Carterets had thriven apace, and at six months old was, according to Mammy Jane, whose experience qualified her to speak with authority, the largest, finest, smartest, and altogether most remarkable baby that had ever lived in Wellington. Mammy Jane had recently suffered from an attack of inflammatory rheumatism, as the result of which she had returned to her own home. She nevertheless came now and then to see Mrs. Carteret. A younger nurse had been procured to take her place, but it was understood that Jane would come whenever she might be needed.\n\n“You really mean that about Dodie, do you, Mammy Jane?” asked the delighted mother, who never tired of hearing her own opinion confirmed concerning this wonderful child, which had come to her like an angel from heaven.\n\n“Does I mean it!” exclaimed Mammy Jane, with a tone and an expression which spoke volumes of reproach. “Now, Mis’ ‘Livy, what is I ever uttered er said er spoke er done dat would make you s’pose I could tell you a lie ’bout yo’ own chile?”\n\n“No, Mammy Jane, I’m sure you wouldn’t.”\n\n“‘Deed, ma’am, I’m tellin’ you de Lawd’s truf. I don’ haf ter tell no lies ner strain no p’ints ’bout my ole mist’ess’s gran’chile. Dis yer boy is de ve’y spit an’ image er yo’ brother, young Mars Alick, w’at died w’en he wuz ’bout eight mont’s ole, w’iles I wuz laid off havin’ a baby er my own, an’ couldn’ be roun’ ter look after ‘im. An’ dis chile is a rale quality chile, he is,–I never seed a baby wid sech fine hair fer his age, ner sech blue eyes, ner sech a grip, ner sech a heft. W’y, dat chile mus’ weigh ’bout twenty-fo’ poun’s, an’ he not but six mont’s ole. Does dat gal w’at does de nussin’ w’iles I’m gone ten’ ter dis chile right, Mis’ ‘Livy?”\n\n“She does fairly well, Mammy Jane, but I could hardly expect her to love the baby as you do. There’s no one like you, Mammy Jane.”\n\n“‘Deed dere ain’t, honey; you is talkin’ de gospel truf now! None er dese yer young folks ain’ got de trainin’ my ole mist’ess give me. Dese yer new-fangle’ schools don’ l’arn ’em nothin’ ter compare wid it. I’m jes’ gwine ter give dat gal a piece er my min’, befo’ I go, so she’ll ten’ ter dis chile right.”\n\nThe nurse came in shortly afterwards, a neat-looking brown girl, dressed in a clean calico gown, with a nurse’s cap and apron.\n\n“Look a-here, gal,” said Mammy Jane sternly, “I wants you ter understan’ dat you got ter take good keer er dis chile; fer I nussed his mammy dere, an’ his gran’mammy befo’ ‘im, an’ you is got a priv’lege dat mos’ lackly you don’ ‘preciate. I wants you to ‘member, in yo’ incomin’s an’ outgoin’s, dat I got my eye on you, an’ am gwine ter see dat you does yo’ wo’k right.”\n\n“Do you need me for anything, ma’am?” asked the young nurse, who had stood before Mrs. Carteret, giving Mammy Jane a mere passing glance, and listening impassively to her harangue. The nurse belonged to the younger generation of colored people. She had graduated from the mission school, and had received some instruction in Dr. Miller’s class for nurses. Standing, like most young people of her race, on the border line between two irreconcilable states of life, she had neither the picturesqueness of the slave, nor the unconscious dignity of those of whom freedom has been the immemorial birthright; she was in what might be called the chip-on-the-shoulder stage, through which races as well as individuals must pass in climbing the ladder of life,–not an interesting, at least not an agreeable stage, but an inevitable one, and for that reason entitled to a paragraph in a story of Southern life, which, with its as yet imperfect blending of old with new, of race with race, of slavery with freedom, is like no other life under the sun.\n\nHad this old woman, who had no authority over her, been a little more polite, or a little less offensive, the nurse might have returned her a pleasant answer. These old-time negroes, she said to herself, made her sick with their slavering over the white folks, who, she supposed, favored them and made much of them because they had once belonged to them,–much the same reason why they fondled their cats and dogs. For her own part, they gave her nothing but her wages, and small wages at that, and she owed them nothing more than equivalent service. It was purely a matter of business; she sold her time for their money. There was no question of love between them.\n\nReceiving a negative answer from Mrs. Carteret, she left the room without a word, ignoring Mammy Jane completely, and leaving that venerable relic of ante-bellum times gasping in helpless astonishment.\n\n“Well, I nevuh!” she ejaculated, as soon as she could get her breath, “ef dat ain’ de beatinis’ pe’fo’mance I ever seed er heared of! Dese yer young niggers ain’ got de manners dey wuz bawned wid! I don’ know w’at dey’re comin’ to, w’en dey ain’ got no mo’ rispec’ fer ole age–I don’ know–I don’ know!”\n\n“Now what are you croaking about, Jane?” asked Major Carteret, who came into the room and took the child into his arms.\n\nMammy Jane hobbled to her feet and bobbed a curtsy. She was never lacking in respect to white people of proper quality; but Major Carteret, the quintessence of aristocracy, called out all her reserves of deference. The major was always kind and considerate to these old family retainers, brought up in the feudal atmosphere now so rapidly passing away. Mammy Jane loved Mrs. Carteret; toward the major she entertained a feeling bordering upon awe.\n\n“Well, Jane,” returned the major sadly, when the old nurse had related her grievance, “the old times have vanished, the old ties have been ruptured. The old relations of dependence and loyal obedience on the part of the colored people, the responsibility of protection and kindness upon that of the whites, have passed away forever. The young negroes are too self-assertive. Education is spoiling them, Jane; they have been badly taught. They are not content with their station in life. Some time they will overstep the mark. The white people are patient, but there is a limit to their endurance.”\n\n“Dat’s w’at I tells dese young niggers,” groaned Mammy Jane, with a portentous shake of her turbaned head, “w’en I hears ’em gwine on wid deir foolishniss; but dey don’ min’ me. Dey ‘lows dey knows mo’ d’n I does, ‘ca’se dey be’n l’arnt ter look in a book. But, pshuh! my ole mist’ess showed me mo’ d’n dem niggers ‘ll l’arn in a thousan’ years! I ‘s fetch’ my gran’son’ Jerry up ter be ‘umble, an’ keep in ‘is place. An’ I tells dese other niggers dat ef dey’d do de same, an’ not crowd de w’ite folks, dey’d git ernuff ter eat, an’ live out deir days in peace an’ comfo’t. But dey don’ min’ me–dey don’ min’ me!”\n\n“If all the colored people were like you and Jerry, Jane,” rejoined the major kindly, “there would never be any trouble. You have friends upon whom, in time of need, you can rely implicitly for protection and succor. You served your mistress faithfully before the war; you remained by her when the other negroes were running hither and thither like sheep without a shepherd; and you have transferred your allegiance to my wife and her child. We think a great deal of you, Jane.”\n\n“Yes, indeed, Mammy Jane,” assented Mrs. Carteret, with sincere affection, glancing with moist eyes from the child in her husband’s arms to the old nurse, whose dark face was glowing with happiness at these expressions of appreciation, “you shall never want so long as we have anything. We would share our last crust with you.”\n\n“Thank y’, Mis’ ‘Livy,” said Jane with reciprocal emotion, “I knows who my frien’s is, an’ I ain’ gwine ter let nothin’ worry me. But fer de Lawd’s sake, Mars Philip, gimme dat chile, an’ lemme pat ‘im on de back, er he’ll choke hisse’f ter death!”\n\nThe old nurse had been the first to observe that little Dodie, for some reason, was gasping for breath. Catching the child from the major’s arms, she patted it on the back, and shook it gently. After a moment of this treatment, the child ceased to gasp, but still breathed heavily, with a strange, whistling noise.\n\n“Oh, my child!” exclaimed the mother, in great alarm, taking the baby in her own arms, “what can be the matter with him, Mammy Jane?”\n\n“Fer de Lawd’s sake, ma’am, I don’ know, ‘less he’s swallered somethin’; an’ he ain’ had nothin’ in his han’s but de rattle Mis’ Polly give ‘im.”\n\nMrs. Carteret caught up the ivory rattle, which hung suspended by a ribbon from the baby’s neck.\n\n“He has swallowed the little piece off the end of the handle,” she cried, turning pale with fear, “and it has lodged in his throat. Telephone Dr. Price to come immediately, Philip, before my baby chokes to death! Oh, my baby, my precious baby!”\n\nAn anxious half hour passed, during which the child lay quiet, except for its labored breathing. The suspense was relieved by the arrival of Dr. Price, who examined the child carefully.\n\n“It’s a curious accident,” he announced at the close of his inspection. “So far as I can discover, the piece of ivory has been drawn into the trachea, or windpipe, and has lodged in the mouth of the right bronchus. I’ll try to get it out without an operation, but I can’t guarantee the result.”\n\nAt the end of another half hour Dr. Price announced his inability to remove the obstruction without resorting to more serious measures.\n\n“I do not see,” he declared, “how an operation can be avoided.”\n\n“Will it be dangerous?” inquired the major anxiously, while Mrs. Carteret shivered at the thought.\n\n“It will be necessary to cut into his throat from the outside. All such operations are more or less dangerous, especially on small children. If this were some other child, I might undertake the operation unassisted; but I know how you value this one, major, and I should prefer to share the responsibility with a specialist.”\n\n“Is there one in town?” asked the major.\n\n“No, but we can get one from out of town.”\n\n“Send for the best one in the country,” said the major, “who can be got here in time. Spare no expense, Dr. Price. We value this child above any earthly thing.”\n\n“The best is the safest,” replied Dr. Price. “I will send for Dr. Burns, of Philadelphia, the best surgeon in that line in America. If he can start at once, he can reach here in sixteen or eighteen hours, and the case can wait even longer, if inflammation does not set in.”\n\nThe message was dispatched forthwith. By rare good fortune the eminent specialist was able to start within an hour or two after the receipt of Dr. Price’s telegram. Meanwhile the baby remained restless and uneasy, the doctor spending most of his time by its side. Mrs. Carteret, who had never been quite strong since the child’s birth, was a prey to the most agonizing apprehensions.\n\nMammy Jane, while not presuming to question the opinion of Dr. Price, and not wishing to add to her mistress’s distress, was secretly oppressed by forebodings which she was unable to shake off. The child was born for bad luck. The mole under its ear, just at the point where the hangman’s knot would strike, had foreshadowed dire misfortune. She had already observed several little things which had rendered her vaguely anxious.\n\nFor instance, upon one occasion, on entering the room where the baby had been left alone, asleep in his crib, she had met a strange cat hurrying from the nursery, and, upon examining closely the pillow upon which the child lay, had found a depression which had undoubtedly been due to the weight of the cat’s body. The child was restless and uneasy, and Jane had ever since believed that the cat had been sucking little Dodie’s breath, with what might have been fatal results had she not appeared just in the nick of time.\n\nThis untimely accident of the rattle, a fatality for which no one could be held responsible, had confirmed the unlucky omen. Jane’s duties in the nursery did not permit her to visit her friend the conjure woman; but she did find time to go out in the back yard at dusk, and to dig up the charm which she had planted there. It had protected the child so far; but perhaps its potency had become exhausted. She picked up the bottle, shook it vigorously, and then laid it back, with the other side up. Refilling the hole, she made a cross over the top with the thumb of her left hand, and walked three times around it.\n\nWhat this strange symbolism meant, or whence it derived its origin, Aunt Jane did not know. The cross was there, and the Trinity, though Jane was scarcely conscious of these, at this moment, as religious emblems. But she hoped, on general principles, that this performance would strengthen the charm and restore little Dodie’s luck. It certainly had its moral effect upon Jane’s own mind, for she was able to sleep better, and contrived to impress Mrs. Carteret with her own hopefulness.\n\nV\n\nA JOURNEY SOUTHWARD\n\nAs the south-bound train was leaving the station at Philadelphia, a gentleman took his seat in the single sleeping-car attached to the train, and proceeded to make himself comfortable. He hung up his hat and opened his newspaper, in which he remained absorbed for a quarter of an hour. When the train had left the city behind, he threw the paper aside, and looked around at the other occupants of the car. One of these, who had been on the car since it had left New York, rose from his seat upon perceiving the other’s glance, and came down the aisle.\n\n“How do you do, Dr. Burns?” he said, stopping beside the seat of the Philadelphia passenger.\n\nThe gentleman looked up at the speaker with an air of surprise, which, after the first keen, incisive glance, gave place to an expression of cordial recognition.\n\n“Why, it’s Miller!” he exclaimed, rising and giving the other his hand, “William Miller–Dr. Miller, of course. Sit down, Miller, and tell me all about yourself,–what you’re doing, where you’ve been, and where you’re going. I’m delighted to meet you, and to see you looking so well–and so prosperous.”\n\n“I deserve no credit for either, sir,” returned the other, as he took the proffered seat, “for I inherited both health and prosperity. It is a fortunate chance that permits me to meet you.”\n\nThe two acquaintances, thus opportunely thrown together so that they might while away in conversation the tedium of their journey, represented very different and yet very similar types of manhood. A celebrated traveler, after many years spent in barbarous or savage lands, has said that among all varieties of mankind the similarities are vastly more important and fundamental than the differences. Looking at these two men with the American eye, the differences would perhaps be the more striking, or at least the more immediately apparent, for the first was white and the second black, or, more correctly speaking, brown; it was even a light brown, but both his swarthy complexion and his curly hair revealed what has been described in the laws of some of our states as a “visible admixture” of African blood.\n\nHaving disposed of this difference, and having observed that the white man was perhaps fifty years of age and the other not more than thirty, it may be said that they were both tall and sturdy, both well dressed, the white man with perhaps a little more distinction; both seemed from their faces and their manners to be men of culture and accustomed to the society of cultivated people. They were both handsome men, the elder representing a fine type of Anglo-Saxon, as the term is used in speaking of our composite white population; while the mulatto’s erect form, broad shoulders, clear eyes, fine teeth, and pleasingly moulded features showed nowhere any sign of that degeneration which the pessimist so sadly maintains is the inevitable heritage of mixed races.\n\nAs to their personal relations, it has already appeared that they were members of the same profession. In past years they had been teacher and pupil. Dr. Alvin Burns was professor in the famous medical college where Miller had attended lectures. The professor had taken an interest in his only colored pupil, to whom he had been attracted by his earnestness of purpose, his evident talent, and his excellent manners and fine physique. It was in part due to Dr. Burns’s friendship that Miller had won a scholarship which had enabled him, without drawing too heavily upon his father’s resources, to spend in Europe, studying in the hospitals of Paris and Vienna, the two most delightful years of his life. The same influence had strengthened his natural inclination toward operative surgery, in which Dr. Burns was a distinguished specialist of national reputation.\n\nMiller’s father, Adam Miller, had been a thrifty colored man, the son of a slave, who, in the olden time, had bought himself with money which he had earned and saved, over and above what he had paid his master for his time. Adam Miller had inherited his father’s thrift, as well as his trade, which was that of a stevedore, or contractor for the loading and unloading of vessels at the port of Wellington. In the flush turpentine days following a few years after the civil war, he had made money. His savings, shrewdly invested, had by constant accessions become a competence. He had brought up his eldest son to the trade; the other he had given a professional education, in the proud hope that his children or his grandchildren might be gentlemen in the town where their ancestors had once been slaves.\n\nUpon his father’s death, shortly after Dr. Miller’s return from Europe, and a year or two before the date at which this story opens, he had promptly spent part of his inheritance in founding a hospital, to which was to be added a training school for nurses, and in time perhaps a medical college and a school of pharmacy. He had been strongly tempted to leave the South, and seek a home for his family and a career for himself in the freer North, where race antagonism was less keen, or at least less oppressive, or in Europe, where he had never found his color work to his disadvantage. But his people had needed him, and he had wished to help them, and had sought by means of this institution to contribute to their uplifting. As he now informed Dr. Burns, he was returning from New York, where he had been in order to purchase equipment for his new hospital, which would soon be ready for the reception of patients.\n\n“How much I can accomplish I do not know,” said Miller, “but I’ll do what I can. There are eight or nine million of us, and it will take a great deal of learning of all kinds to leaven that lump.”\n\n“It is a great problem, Miller, the future of your race,” returned the other, “a tremendously interesting problem. It is a serial story which we are all reading, and which grows in vital interest with each successive installment. It is not only your problem, but ours. Your race must come up or drag ours down.”\n\n“We shall come up,” declared Miller; “slowly and painfully, perhaps, but we shall win our way. If our race had made as much progress everywhere as they have made in Wellington, the problem would be well on the way toward solution.”\n\n“Wellington?” exclaimed Dr. Burns. “That’s where I’m going. A Dr. Price, of Wellington, has sent for me to perform an operation on a child’s throat. Do you know Dr. Price?”\n\n“Quite well,” replied Miller, “he is a friend of mine.”\n\n“So much the better. I shall want you to assist me. I read in the Medical Gazette, the other day, an account of a very interesting operation of yours. I felt proud to number you among my pupils. It was a remarkable case–a rare case. I must certainly have you with me in this one.”\n\n“I shall be delighted, sir,” returned Miller, “if it is agreeable to all concerned.”\n\nSeveral hours were passed in pleasant conversation while the train sped rapidly southward. They were already far down in Virginia, and had stopped at a station beyond Richmond, when the conductor entered the car.\n\n“All passengers,” he announced, “will please transfer to the day coaches ahead. The sleeper has a hot box, and must be switched off here.”\n\nDr. Burns and Miller obeyed the order, the former leading the way into the coach immediately in front of the sleeping-car.\n\n“Let’s sit here, Miller,” he said, having selected a seat near the rear of the car and deposited his suitcase in a rack. “It’s on the shady side.”\n\nMiller stood a moment hesitatingly, but finally took the seat indicated, and a few minutes later the journey was again resumed.\n\nWhen the train conductor made his round after leaving the station, he paused at the seat occupied by the two doctors, glanced interrogatively at Miller, and then spoke to Dr. Burns, who sat in the end of the seat nearest the aisle.\n\n“This man is with you?” he asked, indicating Miller with a slight side movement of his head, and a keen glance in his direction.\n\n“Certainly,” replied Dr. Burns curtly, and with some surprise. “Don’t you see that he is?”\n\nThe conductor passed on. Miller paid no apparent attention to this little interlude, though no syllable had escaped him. He resumed the conversation where it had been broken off, but nevertheless followed with his eyes the conductor, who stopped at a seat near the forward end of the car, and engaged in conversation with a man whom Miller had not hitherto noticed.\n\nAs this passenger turned his head and looked back toward Miller, the latter saw a broad-shouldered, burly white man, and recognized in his square-cut jaw, his coarse, firm mouth, and the single gray eye with which he swept Miller for an instant with a scornful glance, a well-known character of Wellington, with whom the reader has already made acquaintance in these pages. Captain McBane wore a frock coat and a slouch hat; several buttons of his vest were unbuttoned, and his solitaire diamond blazed in his soiled shirt-front like the headlight of a locomotive.\n\nThe conductor in his turn looked back at Miller, and retraced his steps. Miller braced himself for what he feared was coming, though he had hoped, on account of his friend’s presence, that it might be avoided.\n\n“Excuse me, sir,” said the conductor, addressing Dr. Burns, “but did I understand you to say that this man was your servant?”\n\n“No, indeed!” replied Dr. Burns indignantly. “The gentleman is not my servant, nor anybody’s servant, but is my friend. But, by the way, since we are on the subject, may I ask what affair it is of yours?”\n\n“It’s very much my affair,” returned the conductor, somewhat nettled at this questioning of his authority. “I’m sorry to part _friends_, but the law of Virginia does not permit colored passengers to ride in the white cars. You’ll have to go forward to the next coach,” he added, addressing Miller this time.\n\n“I have paid my fare on the sleeping-car, where the separate-car law does not apply,” remonstrated Miller.\n\n“I can’t help that. You can doubtless get your money back from the sleeping-car company. But this is a day coach, and is distinctly marked ‘White,’ as you must have seen before you sat down here. The sign is put there for that purpose.”\n\nHe indicated a large card neatly framed and hung at the end of the car, containing the legend, “White,” in letters about a foot long, painted in white upon a dark background, typical, one might suppose, of the distinction thereby indicated.\n\n“You shall not stir a step, Miller,” exclaimed Dr. Burns wrathfully. “This is an outrage upon a citizen of a free country. You shall stay right here.”\n\n“I’m sorry to discommode you,” returned the conductor, “but there’s no use kicking. It’s the law of Virginia, and I am bound by it as well as you. I have already come near losing my place because of not enforcing it, and I can take no more such chances, since I have a family to support.”\n\n“And my friend has his rights to maintain,” returned Dr. Burns with determination. “There is a vital principle at stake in the matter.”\n\n“Really, sir,” argued the conductor, who was a man of peace and not fond of controversy, “there’s no use talking–he absolutely cannot ride in this car.”\n\n“How can you prevent it?” asked Dr. Burns, lapsing into the argumentative stage.\n\n“The law gives me the right to remove him by force. I can call on the train crew to assist me, or on the other passengers. If I should choose to put him off the train entirely, in the middle of a swamp, he would have no redress–the law so provides. If I did not wish to use force, I could simply switch this car off at the next siding, transfer the white passengers to another, and leave you and your friend in possession until you were arrested and fined or imprisoned.”\n\n“What he says is absolutely true, doctor,” interposed Miller at this point. “It is the law, and we are powerless to resist it. If we made any trouble, it would merely delay your journey and imperil a life at the other end. I’ll go into the other car.”\n\n“You shall not go alone,” said Dr. Burns stoutly, rising in his turn. “A place that is too good for you is not good enough for me. I will sit wherever you do.”\n\n“I’m sorry again,” said the conductor, who had quite recovered his equanimity, and calmly conscious of his power, could scarcely restrain an amused smile; “I dislike to interfere, but white passengers are not permitted to ride in the colored car.”\n\n“This is an outrage,” declared Dr. Burns, “a d—-d outrage! You are curtailing the rights, not only of colored people, but of white men as well. I shall sit where I please!”\n\n“I warn you, sir,” rejoined the conductor, hardening again, “that the law will be enforced. The beauty of the system lies in its strict impartiality–it applies to both races alike.”\n\n“And is equally infamous in both cases,” declared Dr. Burns. “I shall immediately take steps”–\n\n“Never mind, doctor,” interrupted Miller, soothingly, “it’s only for a little while. I’ll reach my destination just as surely in the other car, and we can’t help it, anyway. I’ll see you again at Wellington.”\n\nDr. Burns, finding resistance futile, at length acquiesced and made way for Miller to pass him.\n\nThe colored doctor took up his valise and crossed the platform to the car ahead. It was an old car, with faded upholstery, from which the stuffing projected here and there through torn places. Apparently the floor had not been swept for several days. The dust lay thick upon the window sills, and the water-cooler, from which he essayed to get a drink, was filled with stale water which had made no recent acquaintance with ice. There was no other passenger in the car, and Miller occupied himself in making a rough calculation of what it would cost the Southern railroads to haul a whole car for every colored passenger. It was expensive, to say the least; it would be cheaper, and quite as considerate of their feelings, to make the negroes walk.\n\nThe car was conspicuously labeled at either end with large cards, similar to those in the other car, except that they bore the word “Colored” in black letters upon a white background. The author of this piece of legislation had contrived, with an ingenuity worthy of a better cause, that not merely should the passengers be separated by the color line, but that the reason for this division should be kept constantly in mind. Lest a white man should forget that he was white,–not a very likely contingency,–these cards would keep him constantly admonished of the fact; should a colored person endeavor, for a moment, to lose sight of his disability, these staring signs would remind him continually that between him and the rest of mankind not of his own color, there was by law a great gulf fixed.\n\nHaving composed himself, Miller had opened a newspaper, and was deep in an editorial which set forth in glowing language the inestimable advantages which would follow to certain recently acquired islands by the introduction of American liberty, when the rear door of the car opened to give entrance to Captain George McBane, who took a seat near the door and lit a cigar. Miller knew him quite well by sight and by reputation, and detested him as heartily. He represented the aggressive, offensive element among the white people of the New South, who made it hard for a negro to maintain his self-respect or to enjoy even the rights conceded to colored men by Southern laws. McBane had undoubtedly identified him to the conductor in the other car. Miller had no desire to thrust himself upon the society of white people, which, indeed, to one who had traveled so much and so far, was no novelty; but he very naturally resented being at this late day–the law had been in operation only a few months–branded and tagged and set apart from the rest of mankind upon the public highways, like an unclean thing. Nevertheless, he preferred even this to the exclusive society of Captain George McBane.\n\n“Porter,” he demanded of the colored train attache who passed through the car a moment later, “is this a smoking car for white men?”\n\n“No, suh,” replied the porter, “but they comes in here sometimes, when they ain’ no cullud ladies on the kyar.”\n\n“Well, I have paid first-class fare, and I object to that man’s smoking in here. You tell him to go out.”\n\n“I’ll tell the conductor, suh,” returned the porter in a low tone. “I ‘d jus’ as soon talk ter the devil as ter that man.”\n\nThe white man had spread himself over two seats, and was smoking vigorously, from time to time spitting carelessly in the aisle, when the conductor entered the compartment.\n\n“Captain,” said Miller, “this car is plainly marked ‘Colored.’ I have paid first-class fare, and I object to riding in a smoking car.”\n\n“All right,” returned the conductor, frowning irritably. “I’ll speak to him.”\n\nHe walked over to the white passenger, with whom he was evidently acquainted, since he addressed him by name.\n\n“Captain McBane,” he said, “it’s against the law for you to ride in the nigger car.”\n\n“Who are you talkin’ to?” returned the other. “I’ll ride where I damn please.”\n\n“Yes, sir, but the colored passenger objects. I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to go into the smoking-car.”\n\n“The hell you say!” rejoined McBane. “I’ll leave this car when I get good and ready, and that won’t be till I’ve finished this cigar. See?”\n\nHe was as good as his word. The conductor escaped from the car before Miller had time for further expostulation. Finally McBane, having thrown the stump of his cigar into the aisle and added to the floor a finishing touch in the way of expectoration, rose and went back into the white car.\n\nLeft alone in his questionable glory, Miller buried himself again in his newspaper, from which he did not look up until the engine stopped at a tank station to take water.\n\nAs the train came to a standstill, a huge negro, covered thickly with dust, crawled off one of the rear trucks unobserved, and ran round the rear end of the car to a watering-trough by a neighboring well. Moved either by extreme thirst or by the fear that his time might be too short to permit him to draw a bucket of water, he threw himself down by the trough, drank long and deep, and plunging his head into the water, shook himself like a wet dog, and crept furtively back to his dangerous perch.\n\nMiller, who had seen this man from the car window, had noticed a very singular thing. As the dusty tramp passed the rear coach, he cast toward it a glance of intense ferocity. Up to that moment the man’s face, which Miller had recognized under its grimy coating, had been that of an ordinarily good-natured, somewhat reckless, pleasure-loving negro, at present rather the worse for wear. The change that now came over it suggested a concentrated hatred almost uncanny in its murderousness. With awakened curiosity Miller followed the direction of the negro’s glance, and saw that it rested upon a window where Captain McBane sat looking out. When Miller looked back, the negro had disappeared.\n\nAt the next station a Chinaman, of the ordinary laundry type, boarded the train, and took his seat in the white car without objection. At another point a colored nurse found a place with her mistress.\n\n“White people,” said Miller to himself, who had seen these passengers from the window, “do not object to the negro as a servant. As the traditional negro,–the servant,–he is welcomed; as an equal, he is repudiated.”\n\nMiller was something of a philosopher. He had long ago had the conclusion forced upon him that an educated man of his race, in order to live comfortably in the United States, must be either a philosopher or a fool; and since he wished to be happy, and was not exactly a fool, he had cultivated philosophy. By and by he saw a white man, with a dog, enter the rear coach. Miller wondered whether the dog would be allowed to ride with his master, and if not, what disposition would be made of him. He was a handsome dog, and Miller, who was fond of animals, would not have objected to the company of a dog, as a dog. He was nevertheless conscious of a queer sensation when he saw the porter take the dog by the collar and start in his own direction, and felt consciously relieved when the canine passenger was taken on past him into the baggage-car ahead. Miller’s hand was hanging over the arm of his seat, and the dog, an intelligent shepherd, licked it as he passed. Miller was not entirely sure that he would not have liked the porter to leave the dog there; he was a friendly dog, and seemed inclined to be sociable.\n\nToward evening the train drew up at a station where quite a party of farm laborers, fresh from their daily toil, swarmed out from the conspicuously labeled colored waiting-room, and into the car with Miller. They were a jolly, good-natured crowd, and, free from the embarrassing presence of white people, proceeded to enjoy themselves after their own fashion. Here an amorous fellow sat with his arm around a buxom girl’s waist. A musically inclined individual–his talents did not go far beyond inclination–produced a mouth-organ and struck up a tune, to which a limber-legged boy danced in the aisle. They were noisy, loquacious, happy, dirty, and malodorous. For a while Miller was amused and pleased. They were his people, and he felt a certain expansive warmth toward them in spite of their obvious shortcomings. By and by, however, the air became too close, and he went out upon the platform. For the sake of the democratic ideal, which meant so much to his race, he might have endured the affliction. He could easily imagine that people of refinement, with the power in their hands, might be tempted to strain the democratic ideal in order to avoid such contact; but personally, and apart from the mere matter of racial sympathy, these people were just as offensive to him as to the whites in the other end of the train. Surely, if a classification of passengers on trains was at all desirable, it might be made upon some more logical and considerate basis than a mere arbitrary, tactless, and, by the very nature of things, brutal drawing of a color line. It was a veritable bed of Procrustes, this standard which the whites had set for the negroes. Those who grew above it must have their heads cut off, figuratively speaking,–must be forced back to the level assigned to their race; those who fell beneath the standard set had their necks stretched, literally enough, as the ghastly record in the daily papers gave conclusive evidence.\n\nMiller breathed more freely when the lively crowd got off at the next station, after a short ride. Moreover, he had a light heart, a conscience void of offense, and was only thirty years old. His philosophy had become somewhat jaded on this journey, but he pulled it together for a final effort. Was it not, after all, a wise provision of nature that had given to a race, destined to a long servitude and a slow emergence therefrom, a cheerfulness of spirit which enabled them to catch pleasure on the wing, and endure with equanimity the ills that seemed inevitable? The ability to live and thrive under adverse circumstances is the surest guaranty of the future. The race which at the last shall inherit the earth–the residuary legatee of civilization–will be the race which remains longest upon it. The negro was here before the Anglo-Saxon was evolved, and his thick lips and heavy-lidded eyes looked out from the inscrutable face of the Sphinx across the sands of Egypt while yet the ancestors of those who now oppress him were living in caves, practicing human sacrifice, and painting themselves with woad–and the negro is here yet.\n\n“‘Blessed are the meek,'” quoted Miller at the end of these consoling reflections, “‘for they shall inherit the earth.’ If this be true, the negro may yet come into his estate, for meekness seems to be set apart as his portion.”\n\nThe journey came to an end just as the sun had sunk into the west.\n\nSimultaneously with Miller’s exit from the train, a great black figure crawled off the trucks of the rear car, on the side opposite the station platform. Stretching and shaking himself with a free gesture, the black man, seeing himself unobserved, moved somewhat stiffly round the end of the car to the station platform.\n\n“‘Fo de Lawd!” he muttered, “ef I hadn’ had a cha’m’ life, I’d ‘a’ never got here on dat ticket, an’ dat’s a fac’–it sho’ am! I kind er ‘lowed I wuz gone a dozen times, ez it wuz. But I got my job ter do in dis worl’, an’ I knows I ain’ gwine ter die ‘tel I’ve ‘complished it. I jes’ want one mo’ look at dat man, an’ den I’ll haf ter git somethin’ ter eat; fer two raw turnips in twelve hours is slim pickin’s fer a man er my size!”\n\nVI\n\nJANET\n\nAs the train drew up at the station platform, Dr. Price came forward from the white waiting-room, and stood expectantly by the door of the white coach. Miller, having left his car, came down the platform in time to intercept Burns as he left the train, and to introduce him to Dr. Price.\n\n“My carriage is in waiting,” said Dr. Price. “I should have liked to have you at my own house, but my wife is out of town. We have a good hotel, however, and you will doubtless find it more convenient.”\n\n“You are very kind, Dr. Price. Miller, won’t you come up and dine with me?”\n\n“Thank you, no,” said Miller, “I am expected at home. My wife and child are waiting for me in the buggy yonder by the platform.”\n\n“Oh, very well; of course you must go; but don’t forget our appointment. Let’s see, Dr. Price, I can eat and get ready in half an hour–that will make it”–\n\n“I have asked several of the local physicians to be present at eight o’clock,” said Dr. Price. “The case can safely wait until then.”\n\n“Very well, Miller, be on hand at"
