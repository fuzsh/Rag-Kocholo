        "text": "Ancestors\n\n[sibling(s) unknown]\n\nThis page has been accessed 188 times.\n\nBiography\n\nElizabeth DeCarteret was born on December 30, 1663 and baptised at St. Martin in the Fields church in London. She was the daughter of Sir Edoard DeCarteret of Trinity, Bailiff (q.v.) and Elizabeth Johnson, daughter of Robert Johnson, Alderman of London.\n\nIn 1676 she married at St. Mary’s, Savoy, her kinsman Sir Philip Carteret 2nd Baronet of St Ouen, Jersey in the Channel Islands. Elisabeth was then a child of twelve. The marriage contract stipulated: “On the day of the marriage Sir Edouard shall pay to Sir Philippe £1,000 sterling as part of the marriage settlement. The said Elisabeth shall immediately after the marriage return to her parents, and remain with them till she is fifteen years old. Then Sir Edouard shall pay to Sir Philippe for a marriage portion the sum of £1,500 sterling together with the £100 bequeathed to the said Elisabeth by Mrs Anne Skelton. If the said Elisabeth survive her husband, she shall receive one third of the revenue of the manor”.\n\nTheir son Charles was baptised at St. Margaret's Westminster on June 4, 1679 with Charles II as one of his godfathers. He was Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Queen Anne and High Bailiff of Jersey. In 1693 he succeeded as 3rd Baronet and married Mary, daughter of Amias Carteret. His son James had no surviving issue so the title became extinct.\n\nElizabeth passed away March 26, 1717.\n\nIn the north aisle of the nave of Westminster Abbey is a monument to Dame Elizabeth Carteret. The inscription reads:\n\n“Near this place lyeth buried DAME ELIZABETH CARTERET daughter of Sr. EDWARD CARTERET, Knt. [Knight], Gent. Usher of ye Black Rod in the reign of K. Charles the Second Relict [widow] of Sr. PHILIP CARTERET Bart. [Baronet] and by him mother of Sr. CHARLES CARTERET Bart. her only son, interred likewise near this place by whose decease June ye 6th A.D. 1715 in ye 34th year of his age, was extinguished the eldest branch of the antient family of the name of Carteret Seigneurs of St. Ouen in ye Island of Jersey. She died March ye 26th A.D. 1717 aged 52 years.”\n\nHer monument originally consisted of her figure ascending from a sarcophagus extending a hand to an angel. In an arch a group of cherubs were shown in clouds. There was also a coat of arms. The inscription was on a narrow slab. By 1847 the monument had become dilapidated and was taken down by Lord John Thynne, Sub-Dean of the Abbey and representative of the Carteret family. He took all but the inscription slab to Hawnes (or Haynes) Park in Bedfordshire.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/commemorations/carteret-family\n\nFind a Grave, database and images (https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67235759/elizabeth-carteret: accessed 04 February 2024), memorial page for Lady Elizabeth Carteret Carteret (30 Dec 1663–26 Mar 1717), Find a Grave Memorial ID 67235759, citing Westminster Abbey, Westminster, City of Westminster, Greater London, England; Maintained by julia&keld (contributor 46812479).\n\nhttps://ourfamily63.wordpress.com/2021/09/05/biography-of-sir-philip-de-carteret-1st-bart/\n\nWestminster Abbey » Carteret family\".
