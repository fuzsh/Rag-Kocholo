        "text": "A tale of eight proprietors\n\nÂ\n\nBefore North Carolina was a state, we were a royal colony. And before we were a royal colony, we were a proprietorship.\n\nBut even before our chunk of real estate was bandied around several times: Queen Elizabeth handed it first to Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1578, and when he didnât deliver what she wanted in exchange (basically destroying everything Spanish in the New World and making her \"monarch of the seasâ) she handed the charter over to his half-brother Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584. He did a couple of explorations, sent over a colony, and lost it , then finally lost his own head.\n\nIn 1606 the Virginia Company of London got the charter from King James I and set up a colony that actually survived in Jamestown, Virginia. But they lost their charter in 1624 and King Charles I (who in turn would lose his head to a guy named Cromwell) handed the charter over to Robert Heath.\n\nBut Heath didnât have any success with Carolina either.\n\nBut while all people were messing things up, the colonists of Virginia were moving into Carolinaâs Albemarle region on their own. England worried that these new settlers were growing independent of the crown: living on their own, developing the countryside on their own with nary a thought to the king or his taxes. The free-spirited, pacifistic Quakers were also coming down in droves â there were more Quakers than Church of Englanders in the Albemarle by far. The residents, then and for years to come, believed that the government could best serve them by just going to hell and leaving them alone.\n\nAs nature abhors a vacuum, so government abhors too much freedom. England had just climbed out of its own horrific war with the Puritans â a war in which a king was executed, and the crown temporarily destroyed. Now Charles Iâs son, Charles II, was on the throne, he quickly set his mind to organizing Carolina and bringing its upstart settlers under control.\n\nOwing eight particularly brave men whoâd supported him against Cromwell, he yanked the charter back from Heath in 1663 and divided it among them: Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon; George Monck, the Duke of Albemarle; William, Lord Craven; John, Lord Berkeley; Anthony Ashley Cooper, later the Earl of Shaftesbury; Sir George Carteret; Sir William Berkeley, governor of Virginia; and Sir John Colleton.\n\nYou will easily recognize a few of those names: Albemarle, Carteret, and Craven at the least whose names have been given to counties (and, in the case of the first, a river and a sound). Weâll take a closer look at two of them â the Earl of Craven, our own namesake, and Governor Berkely, the only proprietor who ever actually stepped foot in America, and to whom most of the actual governance of the Carolinas was given.\n\nWhile those residing in the Carolinas were granted rights as English citizens, the proprietors were given almost absolute authority over them and their affairs.\n\nOver the next many years, most of those proprietors died or sold their holdings. According to North Carolina historian William Powell, \"During the 66 years of proprietary control nearly 50 different persons served as Proprietors or were entitled to do so.â\n\nIt wasnât long before England began pining to get that land back into its own treasury: the proprietors themselves werenât doing enough to develop the land, or just as importantly, to keep those upstart American colonials from competing with English manufacturers and farms. The whole point was to keep the colonies subservient to the Crown, after all, both politically and financially.\n\nIn 1729 all but one gave into pressure and sold their holdings back to the Crown, turning the Carolinas into a royal colony complete with its own royal, parliament-appointed governor. The stick-in-the-mud was Lord Carteret â now also known as the Earl of Granville. In 1744 a strip of land running the length of North Carolina at its northern border was declared the Granville District, still technically under proprietorship â resulting in a kind of chaos that drove at least one royal governor, William Tryon, to distraction.\n\nI donât know what the other proprietors got for selling their interests back to the crown, but I suspect that those Granvilles should have joined them because they lost their district when the United States declared itself a free nation. And I doubt that our Congress in Philadelphia agreed to pay so much as a penny when it seized that land.\n\nContact Bill at 252-229-4977 or bill.hand@newbernlive.org."
