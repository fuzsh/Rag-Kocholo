        "text": "on 2 Mar 2007 •\n\nScarronides: or, Virgile travestie. A mock-poem. Being the first book of Virgils Æneis in English, burlésque. Imprimatur, Roger L'estrange\n\nLondon : printed by E. Cotes for Henry Brome at the Gun in Ivy-lane, 1664\n\n[4], 112 p.; 8⁰.\n\nAnonymous, By Charles Cotton, 1630 - 1687. In verse. The first leaf bears a rebus of Henry Brome on verso. There are at least two editions with title pages in the same setting of type, but with the rest of the work in different settings.\n\nWing (2nd ed., 1994),C6391 Pforzheimer,222\n\nA popular work; there appear to be at least 3 separate editions in 1664, 10 to 1691.\n\nThis is the same Cotton who wrote the additional fly fishing portions of the \"Compleat Angler,\" by his friend Walton, first included with the fifth edition of 1676.\n\non 3 Mar 2007 •\n\nMeanwhile, at Deptford...\n\n\"Well, my love? Did your meeting with Mr. Pepys go well?\"\n\n\"There's no doubt he's interested, William. But a cautious little man. I'll have to go it carefully with him...Bring him along slow, playing the virtuous Englander maiden to perfection.\"\n\n\"No actress in this land better, Miep darling. But that Diary of his...?\"\n\n\"Not yet. But I saw where he keeps it locked up in the office. That young clerk of his...Hewer...Had it out, trying to read the shorthand. Locked it back up when I came in, asking where Pepys was.\"\n\n\"Hmmn...The Admiral and the Council want a look at that curious document, Miep. My information on the workings at Deptford can only go so far. We need his accounts of the frictions at the Naval Office and in the court...Especially on the decline of Lord Sandwich's standing. De Ruyter...\"\n\nA pause at Miep's nervous wave...She runs to check a sound at the door.\n\nPhew...Nothing.\n\n\"Caution, my love.\" she notes.\n\nHe nods.\n\n\"But that information could be vital. You must get at that Diary. Are you sure you can read his shorthand?\"\n\n\"I saw his notes earlier and the journal itself the other day with Hewer. It's an easy script. And I think once I become a common sight at the Naval Office, hanging on dear Mr. Pepys' favor...And becoming his mistress...\" Slight smile between the Bagwells...Things we do for the Republic... \"...I ought to be able to find a few quiet moments one morning or evening to open the desk and see what the little fellow is so eager to gossip to himself about.\"\n\n\"He's a man of detail...We must give him that. I'm sure his accounts will be enlightening. I hope, mein darling...This will not be too painful for you. It is after all, our sacrifice for the Republic.\"\n\n\"Not toooo tough, mein dearest. He's an amusing little man.\" Ummn...She eyes William's somewhat...Face.\n\n\"And for the Republic, anything...\"\n\n\"Ja...\" Bagwell frowns.\n\non 3 Mar 2017 •\n\nAndrew Hamilton wrote:\n\n\"Is anyone else struck by the fashion in the days of Charles II of putting one's name on some remote place? There's Pennsylvania, Charleston (S.C.), where the Ashley and Cooper Rivers flow together to form the Atlantic Ocean, as we all learned as children, Digby Nova Scotia, Carteret, New Jersey, and of course New York, then Fairfax, Va., lots of Virginia counties, and, of course, Sandwich, Massachusetts. Alas Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. is not named for Lord Lauderdale, but it may be named for a descendant. Nowadays the proprietors of all this real estate would command large premiums for such naming rights. I guess the Indians didn't have good agents.\"\n\nPeople were perhaps less mercenary and more ethical then. This is from Wikipedia\n\nVice Admiral Sir George Carteret, 1st Baronet (c.1610—18 January 1680 N.S.), son of Elias de Carteret, was a royalist statesman in Jersey and England, who served in the Clarendon Ministry as Treasurer of the Navy. He was also one of the original Lords Proprietor of the former British colony of Carolina and New Jersey. Carteret, New Jersey, as well as Carteret County, North Carolina, both in the United States, are named after him.\n\non 4 Mar 2017 •\n\n'That nobody almost understands or judges of business better than the King, if he would not be guilty of his father’s fault to be doubtfull of himself, and easily be removed from his own opinion.'\n\nIs this the first time that Pepys picks up on the fact that the King is a whole lot smarter than his public 'sex and drugs and rock and roll' image? There is a fascinating account in Arthur Bryant's The Saviour of the Navy around page 30 of Charles' deft management in front of the royal Councilof the accusations against the navy by Commissioners appointed by the House of Commmons. Sam was resposible for preparing and delivering the defence of the navy and the King presided. Every now and then he slips in little bits of information or good humoured comments and makes sure his dog in the fight Sam does not get too carried away. It is an impressive performance and crucial in defeating the anti-Navy Office gang in their attempts to prove that the money spent on the navy was being wasted or that things were much more econonically managed under Cromwell."
