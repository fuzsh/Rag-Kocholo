        "text": "-8- defeated all efforts before 1660 to set up a landed social order reflective of the reactionary ideals of the well-to-do. However, when the clever Edward Hyde and George Monck manuvered Charles II back to his father's throne, one more grand effort was made. III. There has rarely been a group of leaders who so seriously shifted the course of modern history as did the little clique who surrounded Charles II from the summer of 1660 to the autumn of 1667. Only three of them, Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon after the Restoration, Ashley Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury after 1673, and John Lord Berkeley, brother of the Virginia Governor, were of high aristocratic stock. The others were self-made men who knew even better than Clarendon and Shaftsbury the art of personal aggrandizement: George Monck, Earl of Albemarie, Henry Bennet, Earl of Arlington, Sir George Carteret, one-time pirate and the \"richest man in England,\" Sir Goerge Downing of Harvard College, and two merchants, Martin Noell and Thomas Povey (1). Nearly all of these 1. Burnet, Thomas; Bishop of Salisbury: History of His Own Time , 1818, Vol. I, Book II, gives contemporary appraisals of these characters. The Dictionary of National Biography (British) gives corrective facts."
