Hants 1699-1702.\n\nBiography\n\nSir Robert Worsley inherited the manor of Appuldurcombe, which had been in his family since 1527. Returned for Newtown on his own interest in 1715, he explained his reasons for standing to his brother Henry, envoy to Portugal:\n\nI am told my standing has done you service, and indeed that was the only reason that made me first think of it ... by offering myself, I kept out other pretenders, and had you been recalled, I was determined to transfer my interest to you.\n\nClassed as a Tory who might often vote with the Whigs, he voted against the Administration on the septennial bill and the repeal of the Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts, but with them on the peerage bill. He did not stand again and died 29 July 1747, leaving his mainland Hampshire property to Robert, Lord Carteret, the son of his daughter, Frances.\n\nRef Volumes: 1715-1754\n\nAuthor: Paula Watson\n\nNotes"
