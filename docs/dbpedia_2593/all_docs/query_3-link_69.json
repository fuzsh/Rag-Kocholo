        "text": "page 337 note b Daniel O'Niele, of the family of Tyrone, and, according to Lord Clarendon, nephew of the celebrated Irish confederate, General Owen Roe O'Niele, was Lieut.-Colonel to Prince Rupert, and afterwards of the Marquess of Ormonde's regiment of foot raised in Flanders. He had been Groom of the Bed Chamber to Charles I., sworn in 21st January, 1639. After the Restoration, he held, with his office in the royal bedchamber, that of Postmaster-General of the three Kingdoms, Master of the Powder, and the command of the King's troop of horse-guards. He married Catharine, eldest daughter and co-heir of Thomas second Lord Wotton, created Countess of Chesterfield for life 29th May, 1660; widow of the Hon. Sir Henry Stanhope, K.B., eldest son of Philip first Earl of Chesterfield, and of John Poliander vander Kirkhoven, Seigneur de Hemflete in Holland: and, dying at Belsize House, Hampstead, 24th October, 1664, æt. 60, was buried at Bocton Malherbe, co. Kent. (M.I.) His widow, who had been governess to the Princess of Orange, died 9th April, 1667, and was buried in the same church. (M. I.)\n\npage 338 note c Colonel Sir Gilbert Talbot, knighted at Oxford 5th January, 1644–5, was a younger son of Sherington Talbot, Esq., of Salwarpe, co. Worcester, and Lacock, co. Wilts. He had been Resident, and then Envoy Extraordinary, at Venice, 1637 to 1645, a Gentleman in Ordinary of the Privy Chamber to Charles I., and, in the Civil Wars, Governor of Tiverton Castle, which he gave up to Sir Thomas Fairfax 18th October, 1645. On the Restoration he vacated his office of Gentleman Usher for that of Master of the Jewel House, and was elected M.P. for Plymouth, on a vacancy, in the Parliament of 1661. In 1664 he was sent Envoy Extraordinary to Denmark, and, having resigned his place in the Tower, died in July, 1695. According to the directions of his will, dated 5th April, 1695, and proved in C. P. C. 29th July following, in which he describes himself of Lacock, he was buried at Salwarpe on 23rd July.\n\nSir Gilbert, who was a Fellow of All Souls' College, Oxford, and a F.R S., drew up—1. “A Narrative of Blud's attempt upon the Crown in the Tower;” 2. “The Jewel House, with the ancient Rights belonging to the Master and Treasurer thereof;” 3. “A Narrative of the Venetians' tender of Assistance to King Charles the First in his Civil Wars, and the Disappointment of it, as likewise of the Design of Confiscating the English Merchants' Effects in Turkey to His Majesty's use;” 4. “A true Narrative of the Earl of Sandwiche's attempt upon Berghen with the English Fleet on 3rd August, 1665, and the cause of his miscarriage thereupon:” all which are to be found in MS. Harl. 6859. The third of these papers has been printed by Sir Henry Ellis in his second series of Original Letters, iii. f. 318. He also prepared a Statement of his Claims upon the Government, dated 20th May, 1680, MS. Harl. 1843, f. 25.\n\npage 338 note d Colonel Eoger Whitley, second son of Thomas Whitley, Esq., of Aston Hall, Hawarden, co. Flint, and himself of Peel House, Tarvin, co. Chester, was, on the Restoration, made Knight Harbinger, also “Farmer of the Post Office, by which he has got a vast estate.” In 1660 he was elected M.P. for Flint Town, so likewise in 1661, 1678–9, and 1680. In 1680–1, 1688, and 1695 he was M.P. for Chester, and in 1692 and three following years Mayor of the same city. He married Charlotte, daughter of Sir Charles Gerard, Knight, of Halsall, co. Lancaster, and sister of Charles first Earl of Macclesfield; she was buried in Westminster Abbey 18th October, 1662; he died 17th July, 1697. In his will, dated 8th May, 1696, and proved in C. P. C. 4th August, 1697, he desires to be buried in the church of Tarvin, or in the cathedral of Chester, or in Westminster Abbey, near his wife, or in Hawarden Church, where his ancestors are buried. He lies buried in the latter church. (M.I.)\n\npage 339 note a Sir Edward “Walker, knighted at Oxford 2nd February, 1644–5, was the son of Edward Walker, gent., of Roobers, in Netherstowey, co. Somerset. He had been Secretary-at-War and a Clerk of the Privy Council to Charles I., and was at this time, and until his death, a Clerk of the Privy Council and Garter King of Arms. He married Agnes, daughter of the Rev. John Reve, S.T.P., Vicar of Great Bookham, co. Surrey, and, dying at Whitehall 29th February, 1676–7, aged 65, lies buried in the church of Stratfordon-Avon, co. Warwick. (M.I.)\n\nThe following is a list of Sir Edward's works:—\n\n“Iter Carolinum; being a succinct Relation of the necessitated Marches, Retreats, and Sufferings of His Majesty Charles the First from January 10, 1641, till the time of his Death, 1648: Collected by a daily Attendant upon His Sacred Majesty during all the said time.” Lond. 1660.\n\n“The Order of the Ceremonies used at the Feast of St. George when the Sovereign of the Most Noble Order of the Garter is present.” Lond. 1674.\n\n“Historical Discourses upon several occasions.” Lond. 1705.\n\n“A circumstantial Account of the Preparations for the Coronation of His Majesty King Charles the Second, and a minute Detail of that splendid Ceremony, with all the particulars connected with it, including the Installation of Knights, Creation of Peers, &c.: to which is prefixed an Account of the Landing, Reception, and Journey of His Majesty from Dover to London.” Lond. 1820.\n\n“The noble and worthy Acts of Knights of the Order of the Garter who were living when the Civil War began in 1641, and of those who were elected afterwards, both before and after the Restoration of Charles II.: observed and recorded by Sir Edward Walker, Knight, Garter King of Arms.” MS. Ashmole 1110, ff. 155–175.\n\npage 339 note c George, son and heir of Richard Lane, Esq., of Tulske, co. Roscomnion, who was created a Baronet 11th February, 1660–1, was knighted at Bruges 27th March, 1657, N.S. He had been a Clerk of the Privy Council to Charles I., and held at this time, with the same office, that of Secretary to the Marquess of Ormonde. On 5th October, 1668, he succeeded his father in the baronetcy; and, having served the offices of Secretary-at-War and of Principal Secretary of State for Ireland, he was, on 31st July, 1676, created Viscount Lanesborough in that kingdom. He married, first, 21st March, 1644–5, Dorcas, daughter of the Hon. Sir Anthony Brabazon, Knight, of Tallaghstown, co. Louth, third son of Edward first Lord Brabazon, of Ireland; she died 18th July, 1671, and was buried in St. Catharine's church, Dublin; secondly, Lady Frances Sackville, daughter of Richard fifth Earl of Dorset. He died 11th December, 1683, and was buried in the church of Rathcline, co. Longford. His widow, who remarried Denny Muschamp, Esq., of Rowbarns, in E. Horsley, co. Surrey, Muster-Master-General in Ireland, died 29th January, 1721–2, and was buried at Withyam, co. Sussex.\n\npage 340 note a John Earle, S. T. P., son of Thomas Earle, gent., Registrar of the Archbishop's Court at York, and a native of that city, was First Chaplain and Sub-Tutor to Charles II., and then Chaplain and Clerk of the Closet. Before this time he had been Rector of Bishopston, co. Wilts, 1639, and Chancellor of Salisbury Cathedral 10th February, 1643–4; and, on the Restoration, he obtained the Deanery of Westminster, 1660. On 30th November, 1662, he was consecrated Bishop of Worcester; and, on 19th September, 1663, translated to Salisbury. He died at Oxford 17th November, 1665, and was buried in the chapel of Merton College. (M. I.)\n\nHis works are: “Microcosmographie, or a Peece of the World discovered; in Essayes and Characters,” Lond. 1628; the thirteenth edition of which was published by Doctor Bliss in 1811, with an Appendix, containing lines on the death of Sir John Burroughs, killed at Rhé, 1627; on the death of William Earl of Pembroke, died 1630. These two poems Doctor Bliss informs me he now believes were not written by the Bishop. “Elegy on Mr. Beaumont,” &c. The Doctor also wrote lines intitled “Carolus, Walliæ Princeps ex Hispania Redux, anno 1623” (Musaram Anglicanarum, 1721, ii. f. 251, &c.); a poem called “Hortus Mertonensis” (Aubrey's Surrey, iv. f. 167, &c.); another, “Ad Joannem Cirenbergivm Dantiscanum Virum Clarissimum, Ode” (Carmen Honorarivm, 1631, f. 14, &c.); “Contemplations upon the Proverbs, with a Discourse in Memory of Lord Falkland” (mentioned in Clarendon's State Papers, ii. f. 350); and translated from English into Latin the. “ΕΙΚΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΑΙΚΗ,” Hague, 1649; and Hooker's “Ecclesiastical Polity” (not printed).\n\npage 340 note e William Armorer, Lieut.-Colonel of Horse and Equerry in succession to James I., Charles I., and Charles II., was knighted between 29th May, 1660, and 8th July, 1662. In December, 1655, he and Colonel the Hon. Sir James Hamilton (son of Thomas, first Earl of Haddington) pistolled Manning, the spy, in the neighbourhood of Cologne; and he is said to have offered to do the same office for Cromwell. He held the place of First Equerry of the Crown Stables on the Restoration, and retired to Reading, co. Berks, in 1677, where, four years after, he died. He was buried in the church of St. Laurence, Reading, 22nd August, 1681: Lady Anne, his wife, on 12th February, 1680–1. His will is dated 7th June, 1677, and was proved in C.P.C. 28th June, 1686.\n\npage 341 note a Henry Proger, Esq., of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, and of Gwernvale, Crickhowel, Brecknockshire, fourth son of Philip Proger, Esq., Equerry to James I., was at this time, and until the death of Charles, one of the royal equerries. He was Equerry of the Hunting Stables, and his name appears among the proposed Knights of the Royal Oak. On 5th June, 1650, while attending Charles's Ambassadors at the Court of Madrid, he became implicated in the murder of Anthony Ascham, the Envoy from the Parliament to the same power. He was knighted by James II., and became Serjeant Porter to the Palace. His will is dated 8th January, 1686–7, and was proved in C.P.C. 5th September, 1688. In it he directs his body to be buried in the church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, but this request does not seem to have been attended to.\n\npage 341 note c Edward, eldest son of Joshua de Carteret, Esq., Seigneur of Handois and La Trinité in Jersey, was knighted in 1660. He held, at the Restoration, the office of a Gentleman Usher Daily Waiter in Ordinary, and, in 1762, by seniority, that of Usher of the Black Rod also. He was at the same time Bailiff of the island of Jersey. Sir Edward married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Johnson, Esq., Alderman of London, and by will dated 30th March, 1682, and proved in C.P.C. 23rd April, 1683, assigned Westminster Abbey as his place of burial. He died 22nd February, 1682–3, æt. 63, and lies buried in the Church of La Trinité. (M. I.) The will of his widow was proved in C.P.C, February 1699–1700.\n\npage 341 note d Stephen Fox, at this time Clerk of the Kitchen, was a younger son of William Fox, Gent., of Farley, co. Wilts. On the Restoration he was appointed a Clerk of the Green Cloth and Paymaster of the Forces. He was knighted 1st July, 1665, and in 1679 became one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury and a Commissioner in the office of Master of the Horse, when he resigned his Paymastership. He was elected M.P. for Salisbury, on a vacancy, in the Parliament of 1661; for Westminster in 1678–9; for Salisbury in 1685, and again in 1713. Sir Stephen Fox married, first, Elizabeth daughter of William Whittle, of London, a lady whose character suffers with his own in “Flagellum Parliamentarian,'’ and who died 11th August, 1696, æt. 69 (M.I.); secondly, Christian, daughter and co-heir of the Rev. Charles Hope, Rector of Haceby (?), co. Lincoln, who died 17th February, 1718–19, æt. 39. (M.I.) He himself died at Chiswick, 23rd September, 1716, æt. 90 (M. I.), and was buried at Farley, where both his wives also lie interred.\n\npage 341 note e Richard, son and heir of Colonel Richard Bellings, of Bellingstown, in the Barony of Balrothery, co. Dublin, author of “Philopater Irenæus,” and other learned works. He was at this time the King's Secretary, and in 1662 he obtained the appointments of Principal Secretary and Master of the Requests to the Queen. He was knighted 6th of March, 1665–6, and married, in 1671, Frances, eldest daughter and co-heir of Sir John Arundell, Knight, of Lanherne, in St. Mawgan, co. Cornwall, Master of the Horse to Queen Catharine; and died, residing in the parish of St. James, Westminster, 30th October, 1716. Lady Bellings, who was a dresser to Queen Catharine and Keeper of H.M. Sweet Coffer, died 6th December, 1713. They both lie buried in the church of St. Columb-Major, co. Cornwall. (M. I.'s.) Sir Richard's will, dated 5th December, 1711, was proved in C.P.C. 2nd November, 1716. “Young Mr. Belling,” writes Sir Edward Nicholas, from Bruges, to the Marquess of Ormonde at Brussels, on Tuesday, 2nd October, 1657, N. S. “is come to this towne and under Mr. Knight's care, who says that the bullet is still in his jaw, and that he will endeavour to take it out as soone as he shal be in case for it, being at present very fevrishe.”\n\npage 343 note a Sir Charles Cottrell, knighted at Oxford 21st March, 1644–5, was son and heir of Sir Clement Cottrell, Knight, of Wilsford, co. Lincoln, Groom-Porter to James I. He was born in 1615, and in 1641 became Master of the Ceremonies to Charles I. In the interregnum he held, besides this office and the office mentioned in the text (1655), that of Steward to the Queen of Bohemia (1651). On a vacancy in the Parliament of 1661, he was elected M.P. for Cardigan; in 1663 he went Ambassador to Brussels; in 1669 he was made one of the Masters of the Requests (resigned 1675); and 20th December, 1670, LL.D. at Oxford. He married Frances, daughter of Edmund West, Esq., of Marsworth, co. Bucks; she died in 1695. He resigned his place of Master of the Ceremonies in 1686, and died in June, 1701. By will dated 16th April, codicil 9th May, 1701, and proved in C.P.C. 21st June following, he directed his body to be buried in the north aisle of the church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, near the bodies of his father and mother, and there he was interred 9th June. A bequest which he makes is worthy of note. He leaves to Sir Stephen Fox a ring with a figure cut in an onyx, which Charles I. gave from his finger to Sir Philip Warwick to seal the letters which he wrote for him at the treaty of the Isle of Wight, and which had been left to him by Sir Philip. Administration of the effects of Lady Frances Cottrell, of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, was granted to her husband 9th January, 1695–6. Sir Charles translated from the Italian, in conjunction with William Aylesbury, Esq., Davila's “Historia delle Guerre Civile di Francia,” London, 1647; from the Spanish “A Relation of the defeating of Cardinal Mazarin and Oliver Cromwell's design to have taken Ostend by treachery in the year 1658,” Lond. 1660–66; from the French of de la Calprenede the romance called “Cassandre,” Lond. 1661, (several editions); and again from the Spanish “The Spiritual Year, or a devout contemplation, digested into distinct arguments for every month in the year, and for every week in the month,” Lond. 1693.\n\npage 344 note b Major Edward Halsall, of the family of that name at Halsall in Lancashire, was frequently called Halsey. He was wounded in Lathom House when it was besieged by the Parliament 27th February, 1643–4, 2nd December, 1645, and wrote a journal of the siege (à Wood MS. D. 16, Ashmolean Museum, and Harl. MS. 2042, n. 4), which has been twice printed, separately in 1823, and in the Appendix to Bonn's edition of the “Memoirs of the Life of Colonel Hutchinson,” 1846, ff. 487–518. He accompanied the Duke of Gloucester to England, and on his death became Equerry to Queen Catharine. His widow, Susanna, daughter of Sir John Acland, the first Baronet, of Columb-John, co. Devon, remarried John Carleton, Gent., and dying 5th February, 1696–7, æt. 62, was buried in St. Pancras Church, co. Middlesex. (M. I.) In 1678, Mrs. Halsall's name is to be found in the list of Queen Catharine's “Pensioners.” Major Halsall had, as well as Sir Henry Proger, been concerned in the murder of Ascham, and in 1654 he is said to have undertaken the assassination of Cromwell.\n\npage 347 note e Robert, third son of Henry Holmes, Esq., of Mallow, co. Cork, afterwards so well known as Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Holmes. He was knighted at Deptford 27th March, 1666–7, being then Captain of the “Defiance” man-of-war, and the same year made Governor of the Isle of Wight. He became M.P. for Winchester, on a vacancy, in the Parliament of 1661; and in 1678–9, and 1688, he obtained a seat for Newport, Isle of Wight. His death occurred 18th November, 1692, at Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, where he lies buried. (M. I.) I have compared his signature in the Register with his known autograph.\n\npage 347 note f Lord Clarendon says that this gentleman, “being born of an English mother, had all imaginable duty for the King, and, being a man of excellent parts and very dexterous in business, was very serviceable to His Majesty, which he ever afterwards acknowledged.” He was the son of Jean Azazola de Onate, of Azazola, in Biscay, Secretary of the Chamber to the Infanta Isabella-Clara-Eugenia, and Chamberlain to her husband the. Archduke Albert, by his wife Beatrix, daughter of Jeromy Heath and his wife Elvira Ramirez. In 1666 (?) he went Envoy Extraordinary to the Court at London, when he obtained two charters under the Great Seal, dated, the one, Westminster, 10th July, 1666, and addressed to the Duke of York, Admiral of England, the, other, Whitehall, 29th August following, and addressed to the Duke of Lenox and Richmond, Admiral of Scotland, authorising the owners of fifty fishing vessels, being citizens of Bruges and residing with their families in the town, to fish in the British seas and to enter the British ports. These charters I have seen among the archives in the Hôtel de Ville, and with them a printed copy of the Proclamation issued on 2nd October, 1666, announcing to the fishermen the privileges obtained for them. The chevalier died in 1674, and was buried in the now destroyed church of the English nuns of St. Frances at Bruges. (M. I.) His wife was Josine, daughter of Jean Stochove, Councillor of Bruges in 1602 and 1604, and Eschevin in 1605 and 1613, who had previously been the wife of Jean de Sprangen, Captain of 300 foot soldiers in the service of Spain. Lord Clarendon is in error when he says he was Burgomaster of Bruges during Charles's residence there: he was several times Eschevin, and in 1649, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, Burgomaster of the Franc. He was also President of the Council of the Admiralty and of the Royal Chamber of Commerce, Captain of a free Company of Infantry, and, afterwards, “Capitaine Entretenu” in the Guidon of Philip IV., Lieut.-General of the Falconry of the Province of Flanders, Gentleman of the House to his said Majesty, and his Commissioner for the renewing of the Magistracy of Bruges.\n\npage 348 note a Letter to J. Y. Akerman, Esq., Secretary, dated 5th March, 1850, read 14th. These pictures were doubtless painted for the Society of St. Barbara—a fraternity of arquebusiers dispersed by the French revolutionists in 1798—record a circumstance which must have occurred in 1656. The first, which has the date 1667, represents Charles in the garden of the fraternity, on the termination of a trial of skill, suspending the golden bird from the neck of the Duke of York, who arrived in Bruges 23rd September, N.S., this year, the Duke of Gloucester standing by. In the second, which has no date, the three brothers are seated at a table supplied with viands. The artist has committed the singular anachronism of hanging against the wall of the interior a picture of the garden scene, and the further one of adorning the room with the bust and portrait above mentioned. From the introduction of the bust and portrait it is certain that Charles and the Duke of Gloucester became also members of this society, and I am disposed to believe that the Salle de Réunion, shown externally and internally, is another anachronism, and that this part of the building was erected in or after 1662, with the royal mortuary debts. The hôtel of St. Barbara is in the street of St. George, and adjoins the suppressed convent of the Carmelite Nuns of Sion."
