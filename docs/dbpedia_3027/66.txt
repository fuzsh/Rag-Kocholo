OpenTV has confirmed its technologies will be used in Casema’s new high definition television services. The Dutch cablenet plans to deploy HD digital video recorders with OpenTV Core2 middleware, OpenTV PVR2, and OpenTV HTML browser.

Plans to use Scientific-Atlanta’s Explorer 8455 DVB unit were confirmed by Broadband TV News during the Anga Cable event in May.

“With the aggressive timeline we have put in place for deployment, it is of paramount importance that our key vendors have solid experience in launching complex projects,” said Casema CFO Walter Blom.

The new digital platform will serve Casema’s customers in cities including The Hague, Amersfoort, Utrecht, Delft, and Breda.
