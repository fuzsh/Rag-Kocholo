Subscribers received a letter two weeks ago, warning them of the up-coming changes and offering them the (paid) services of engineers to set the new frequencies. Most of the complaints, says Casema, have come from elderly clients who are disappointed at not being able to watch the TV coverage of the birth of the new princess. The Hague pensioners' association ANBO also says that they have had thousands of phone calls and describes the channel-change operation as 'customer-unfriendly'.
