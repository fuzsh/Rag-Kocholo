The\n\nCompany is the third largest cable operator in the country, passing\n\n1.5 million homes. The Company's current customer base represents\n\napproximately 21% of all Dutch households.\n\nThe Sponsors acquired Casema in January 2003 from France Telecom,\n\nwith Providence and Carlyle each owning 46% of the Company and GMT 8%.\n\nUnder the ownership of the Sponsors and management of Chief Executive\n\nOfficer Jos Molenkamp who joined shortly after the acquisition, Casema\n\ninvested in excess of EUR 250 million in its network and\n\ninfrastructure. The Company has been transformed from a utility-like\n\nanalog television provider into the leading \"triple play\" operator in\n\nthe Netherlands, offering digital television, broadband internet and\n\ntelephony to the Dutch consumers.

This success is due to the\n\nstrengths of the Casema business and the great work done by management\n\nsince the acquisition. We are also very proud of having accompanied\n\nthe Company through this major transformation into one of the leading\n\ntriple-play operators in Europe.\"\n\nJorg Mohaupt, Managing Director at Providence said: \"Thanks to the\n\nleadership of Jos and his team, the hard work of our partners, and the\n\ndedication of all Casema employees, we have added significant value to\n\nthe company over the past three years and helped Casema grow, enhance\n\nits product offerings and customer service, and improve its financial\n\nposition. We are confident that Casema has a bright future with its\n\nnew partners.\"\n\nJos Molenkamp, CEO of Casema said: \"Casema has established itself\n\nas a strong competitor with an exceptional product offering, a large\n\nand sophisticated customer base, and one of the most reliable\n\nbroadband networks. We are pleased with the Company's success in\n\ndelivering excellent service to all of our customers.\"\n\nThe transaction, which is expected to close in the second half of\n\n2006, is subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nGoldman Sachs International acted as sole financial advisor to the\n\nSponsors.\n\nAbout Casema\n\nWith over 30 years of experience and around 1.3 million\n\nsubscribers, Casema is one of the Netherlands' leading cable\n\noperators.
