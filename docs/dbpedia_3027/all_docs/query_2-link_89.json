        "text": "A look at Article 620.51 indicates that the location of elevator disconnects need to be, something about, accessible to qualified persons. I believe there is a requirement for proximity to the door. Is there not? Has this changed OR should I be looking in the, in this case MA, elevator code for this.\n\nAlso,is there any reason why said disconnect or disconnects canâ€™t be. Circuit breaker. And lastly, does each device need to be isolated or could they be as part of a panel (for rooms with multiple elevators obviously)?\n\nThanks\n\nWe typically install a panel in the elevator machine room when there are mulitple elevators. In NYC there needs to be a disconnecting means reachable right inside of the door so we install separate disconnects at the door. We have in the past mounted a distribution board next to the door. Often our spec wants both the panel and separate disconnects."
