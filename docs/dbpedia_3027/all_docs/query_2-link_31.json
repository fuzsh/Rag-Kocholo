        "text": "It is always my goal to use an approach that meets the individualâ€™s needs. I approach counseling with curiosity and compassion with an eclectic style that best fits the client. I work from a person-centered and attachment-based lens, valuing the ways early-life relationships and experiences shape our view of ourselves, others, and the world around us. I also utilize Polyvagal Theory, Motivational Interviewing, Narrative Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). I believe our mind and body are interconnected and it is important to connect to both to improve well-being. My role is to hold a space for both the experiences of joy and the difficult and uncomfortable things in life. I encourage clients to feel empowered in their own needs, values, and identity.\n\nI enjoy working with individuals addressing challenges related to stress management, communication skills, relationships, anxiety, depression, co-occurring disorders, and family of origin issues. I have experience working with young adults, life transitions, identity development, and substance use concerns.\n\nSpecial Offerings:"
