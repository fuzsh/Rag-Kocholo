I'm trying to match up operational histories with serial numbers, which is not as easy as it sounds!\n\nInformation on these old jets is brutally hard to find, especially unit histories, crashes, combat losses, scrappings, that sort of thing, more than just the s/n. In particular, I have little on the West German F-84Fs except serial numbers, though I know about 36% crashed. Also for the Italian, Greek, Turkish and even the French F-84s, I can't find any place where there is a list of what serial numbers crashed where and when, and what happened to them after they were retired, what USAF units they came from, how they were disposed of, that sort of thing.\n\nPerhaps someone here could assist me, or point me in the right direction?\n\nThanks,\n\nNate"
