One thing I was wondering is if it is possible to train a Q&A chatbot to answer from a specific set of articles (200+).\n\nCurrently, there are details for training a customer support chatbot here but that seems to take in data regarding past chat history from users. For someone who does not have thousands of lines of past conversations, this doesn’t seem very practical so I’m hoping to provide GPT-3 more details specific to a certain area (e.g. economics) in the form of plain text/articles.\n\nGuidance on this is greatly appreciated! Just getting started so I might have missed this functionality if it already exists.\n\nGot it, makes sense! Thanks for the clarification.\n\nWhat is your take on this? Is it better to fine tune using the Q&A format they have provided or would it be better to fine tune using a large set of articles and other text relating to the subject matter? Is there a resource I can refer to that discusses fine tuning using just large amounts of text?\n\nHi @ayangupta I just published some code and a tutorial for doing what you’re asking about. I used the answers endpoint and a documents file as the source for the answers. It’s a complete app that you can get up and running in a few clicks. Also, all of the code is there for you to look at / use / modify / whatever. Here is the tutorial video. I hope this is helpful."
