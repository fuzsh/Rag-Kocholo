Financial services are increasingly provided online, without the intermediary of customer-facing institutions.\n\nRecovery from COVID-19: The changing structure of employment in the EU\n\nEuropean labour markets have recovered strongly from COVID-19. By the end of 2021, little more than 18 months after the start of the pandemic, employment rates in the EU were almost at pre-crisis levels."
