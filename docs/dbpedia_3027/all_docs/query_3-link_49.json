KDG is the Largest German cable operator and well-positioned to successfully roll-out triple play services.\n\nUnterfoehring, Germany - Today the owners of Europe's largest cable company Kabel Deutschland announced a major change in the Company's shareholder structure. Providence Equity Partners will acquire the entire shareholdings of Apax Partners and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and with about 95% ownership become the sole shareholder of Kabel Deutschland alongside management.\n\nApax, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, and Providence Equity Partners jointly acquired Kabel Deutschland in March 2003 as a carve-out from Deutsche Telekom AG. Under their ownership the Company transitioned from a traditional analog cable TV company into an innovative provider of cable services including pay-TV, Broadband Internet and Telephony, investing significantly into the network.\n\nAfter close to three years of joint ownership, Apax and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners are seeking liquidity for their shareholding while Providence Equity has committed itself to further support the Company and accompany the roll-out of its new services.\n\n\"Kabel Deutschland is Europe's largest cable operator and is extremely well positioned to capitalize on the substantial growth in broadband internet and digital television expected in the coming years\" said John Hahn, Head of Providence Equity's European operations. \"Our partnership with our co-investors Apax and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners has been very productive and Kabel Deutschland's management has successfully transformed the company into a growth-oriented business with a strong customer focus. Providence Equity is fully committed to further expand Kabel Deutschland's product scope and digital footprint for the benefit of our customers.\"\n\nKabel Deutschland will accelerate the upgrade of its cable network and invest approximatively €500 million over the next three years to offer triple play services to close to 90% of its 15.3 million homes passed in Germany.\n\nThe terms of the agreement signed today have not been disclosed. The transaction is subject to customary approval of the relevant governmental authorities and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2006.\n\nKDG operates the cable networks in 13 German states and generated sales of more than 1 bn Euros in the financial year 2004/2005 (End March 05).\n\nMedia contacts:\n\nApax Partners\n\nIra Wülfing Kommunikation\n\nIra Wülfing\n\n+49 89 2000 30 33\n\nira@wuelfing-kommunikation.de\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nDavid Kamenetzky\n\n+49 69 7532 2644\n\nDavid.kamenetzky@gs.com\n\nProvidence Equity Partners\n\nAndrew Cole\n\n+1-212-687-8080\n\nacole@sardverb.com\n\nRoland Klein\n\n+44 7776 162 997\n\nroland.klein@cnc-ag.com\n\nAbout Apax:\n\nApax Partners is one of the world's leading private equity investment groups, operating across the United States, Europe and Israel.
