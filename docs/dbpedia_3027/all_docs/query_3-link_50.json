        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nA major concern of the food sector and research community nowadays is to find the most appropriate strategy to authenticate foods. The term authentication is rather complicated. It involves the botanical and geographical origin determination of foods using specific compositional criteria and properties [1]. Products with a specific composition and origin demand a higher price in the international market. For example, there are over 6500 scientific papers dealing with honey worldwide [2,3,4,5,6].\n\nApis mellifera honeybees produce citrus honey when beekeepers place the beehives in citrus groves during the blossom period. The citrus nectariferous species involved dynamically in the production of citrus honey are oranges (Citrus sinensis L.), followed by bitter orange (Citrus bigaradia L.), tangerines (Citrus tangerina or Citrus reticulata), and lemons (Citrus limon L.). This type of honey has some special characteristics. These include its intense aroma, mild flavor, light amber color, and quick crystallization. Some statistics about the production rate show that this type of honey accounts for 10% of the annual honey production in Greece. Important amounts of citrus honey are also produced in Italy, Spain, Mexico, France, the USA, Israel, Egypt, and Morocco [5]. The percentage of pollen grains in citrus honey is often under-represented, and therefore is practically impossible to use only pollen data as a measure of the typification of citrus honey. This is supported by a wide range of pollen grain percentage reported for European and Mediterranean citrus honey (ca. 2–42%) [2,5,6]. In this context, physicochemical parameter analysis (electrical conductivity, pH, ash, acidity, minerals, sugars, volatile compounds, flavonoids, etc.), especially in the form of “physicochemical markers”, identified using multivariate statistics, sensory analysis, or the correlation of citrus pollen grains with volatile compounds, are adopted by the research community to deeper characterize this type of honey [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11].\n\nThe solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique was first introduced by Pawliszyn [12]. Until then, numerous studies were carried out on foods regarding determination of volatile compounds, including honey, which is rather a complicated matrix. The technical nature of SPME is that it is a sample preparation technique, which combines the usage of a fused-silica fiber that is coated on the outside with an appropriate stationary phase. The analyte in the sample is directly extracted to the coating of the fiber. The SPME technique can be applied, in fact routinely, in combination with other analytical techniques such as gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), or high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC–MS) [13]. SPME can be recognized as a “green” technique that, in combination with analytical chemical techniques, can rapidly provide adequate data regarding the volatile pattern of foods. The volatile markers of citrus honey that have been associated previously with its typicity include methyl anthranilate, isomers of lilac aldehydes, hotrienol, α,4-dimethyl-3-cyclohexen-1-acetaldehyde, dill ether, nerolidol, 1-para-menthen-9-al, linalool, DL-limonene, (E)-limonene oxide, ethyl linalool, etc. [3,4,5,6,7].\n\nTaking the aforementioned into consideration, the scope of the current study was to characterize and discriminate citrus honey from different countries using semi-quantitative data of volatile compounds in combination with machine learning algorithms. The obtained multivariate discriminating models were further evaluated using a set of honey samples containing other nectar honey types such as flower and thyme honey. Finally, an effort was made to establish a new metric for citrus honey authentication using the selected volatile compounds from the multivariate analysis and producing specific ratios. In the recent literature, this is the first attempt to establish such a metric index for citrus honey authentication, comprising the originality of the present study and providing support to previous studies in the relevant literature.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nConsidering citrus honey samples, the lilac isomers (I-IV) are of great importance, since these volatile compounds hold a high proportion in the total volatile fraction of citrus honey. It has been documented in previous studies [3,4,8] that these volatile compounds may potentially be considered as “key volatile compounds” in citrus honey. However, in more recent studies it was reported that lilac aldehydes could potentially contribute to the aroma of Spanish sunflower and thyme honey [6] and of Turkish pine honey [19]. Some other aldehydes such as octanal, nonanal, and decanal have been also identified in citrus honey [3,4,8]. In the present study, nonanal and decanal could aid to the geographical discrimination of citrus honey ( ). 2-Methylbutanal (which comprises a leucine- and isoleucine-derived volatile) was identified only in Egyptian citrus honey samples. Benzaldehyde, with an almond-like and pleasant aroma was identified in higher amount (mg/kg) in Moroccan and Greek citrus honey samples compared to Egyptian and Spanish citrus honey samples. However, the other nectar honey samples studied had the highest amount (mg/kg) of benzaldehyde. This compound has previously been reported to contribute to the volatile fraction of Greek and Spanish citrus honey [3,4,8].\n\nRegarding furan derivatives, furfural (furan-2-carbaldehyde) and 5-methyl-2-furaldehyde are owed to the thermal pre-treatment of honey during the HS-SPME [15], heat processing or storage, and should not be considered as markers of botanical or geographical origin, as reported by Kadar et al. [4]. Even though significant differences were detected in the composition (mg/kg) of furfural, with respect to geographical origin of citrus honey, we are in line with the report of Kadar et al. [4], and this volatile compound was not considered as a marker of citrus honey geographical origin.\n\nAlpha-4-dimethyl-cyclohexene-1-acetaldehyde is a volatile compound that has been considered to contribute to the aroma of Spanish citrus honey [8]. Indeed, in the present study this volatile compound was identified in all citrus honey samples, and in significantly lower amount (mg/kg) in the other nectar honey samples.\n\nRegarding esters, ethyl octanoate, ethyl nonanoate, and ethyl dodecanoate contribute to the geographical origin discrimination of citrus honey ( ). Methyl anthranilate (MA, 2-aminobenzoic acid methyl ester) was identified in all citrus honey samples in similar amounts (mg/kg), and therefore, could not be used as a potential indicator of geographical origin of citrus honey. MA is commonly used as a flavoring agent for its pleasant fruity odor. Its characteristic aroma can be described as fruity, concord grape, and musty, with a floral powdery nuance. This compound has been proposed as a fingerprint and an index of correct labelling of citrus honey [4,6]. Indeed, Escriche et al. [6] reported that MA was correlated with certain volatile compounds, such as 1-para-menthene-9-al, limonene, dill-ether, and ethyl linalool, and slightly lower with the four lilac aldehyde isomers. In our case, MA was significantly correlated (r = 0.31, p = 0.043 < 0.05) only with lilac aldehyde C during the Pearson’s correlation test, with some other potential correlations with volatile compounds such as lilac aldehyde D, α-4-dimethyl-cyclohexene-1-acetaldehyde dill ether, and ethyl dodecanoate.\n\nCertain hydrocarbons such as heptane, octane, and nonane, have previously been identified in European unifloral honey samples [3,4,5,19,20,21]. Among these volatile compounds, heptane and octane could contribute to the geographical discrimination of citrus honey, since these were identified in diverse amounts (mg/kg) (with respect, of course, to the geographical origin of citrus honey) ( ). It should be noted that the other nectar honey samples studied contained higher amounts (mg/kg) of octane. Escriche et al. [21] reported a higher amount (mg/kg) of octane for Spanish lemon blossom honey compared to orange blossom honey. Several alkanes are common in the cuticle of honeybees, so the presence in honey could be due to an animal origin/activity and not exclusively from plants. Indeed, Patrignani et al. [11] reported that aliphatic fatty acids probably originate from beeswax, and this could explain the presence of these compounds in honey.\n\nDill ether ((3S,3aS,7aR)-3,6-dimethyl-2,3,3a,4,5,7a-hexahydrobenzofuran) has previously been identified in Greek citrus honey [3,5]. Dill ether was determined in a higher amount (mg/kg) in Moroccan citrus honey than in the other types ( ).\n\nAs for ketones, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one and β-damascenone ((E)-1-(2,6,6-Trimethyl-1-cyclohexa-1,3-dienyl)but-2-en-1-one) were identified only in citrus honey from Greece. 6-Methyl-5-hepen-2-one has previously been identified as a volatile component in Spanish lemon and orange honey [21] in conformity with the results of the present study. β-damascenone was also identified in the other nectar honey samples. It is worth mentioning that β-damascenone was not identified in a recent study concerning the volatile profile of Spanish citrus, sunflower, and thyme honey [6], nor in a previous study concerning acacia, sunflower, and tilia honeys from Spain, Romania, and the Czech Republic [22].\n\nPhenolic volatile compounds (benzeneethanol and benzeneacetonitrile) were only identified in studied nectar honey samples from countries other than Greece. Regarding 3,4,5-trimethylphenol, similar amount (mg/kg) was recorded for citrus and other nectar honey samples only from Greece. Escriche et al. [6] reported a similar isomer (2,4,5-trimethylphenol) to contribute to the aroma of Spanish citrus and thyme honey.\n\nSeven terpenes, 2,6,6-trimethyl-bicyclo [3.1.1]hept-2-ene (α-pinene), 1-methyl-4-(1-methyl-ethyl) benzene (para-cymene), dl-limonene ((4R)-1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene), herboxide (isomer II) (5-isopropenyl-2-methyl-2-vinyltetrahydrofuran), hotrienol ((E)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,5,7-trien-3-ol), cis-linalool oxide (2-[(2S,5R)-5-ethenyl-5-methyloxolan-2-yl]propan-2-yl carbamates), and linalool (3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-dien-3-ol), were also identified in diverse amounts (mg/kg) ( ), in conformity with previous studies in the literature concerning Greek and Spanish citrus honey [3,6,7,20]. Terpenoids comprise the major components of essential oils of the flowers and fruits of the Citrus genus [4] and the presence of these volatile compounds in citrus honey is associated with the honeybee feeding on the nectar of these plant materials.\n\nDriving the hypothesis further, the potential of volatile compounds in combination with chemometrics for the geographical and botanical origin discrimination of honey is really very satisfactory. Previous studies in the literature are in accordance with the results and the hypothesis presented in the present study. More specifically, Castro-Vázquez et al. [8] differentiated Spanish citrus, rosemary, lavender, thyme, eucalyptus, and heather honey using inalool derivatives, limonyl alcohol, sinensal isomers, and α,4-dimethyl-3-cyclohexene-1-acetaldehyde, acetoin, 5-hydroxy-2,7-dimethyl-4-octanone, para-cymene derivatives, 3-caren-2-ol, spathulenol, hexanal, nerolidol oxide, coumarin, hexanol, benzene, and phenolic compounds in combination with PCA. The first four components (PC1-PC4) explained 71% of the total variance. Patrignani et al. [11] reported that 3,8-para-menthatriene; cyclopropylidenemethylbenzene; 1,1,6-trimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene; 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene; α-pinene; isopropyl 2-methylbutanoate; cymene; 2,6-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene; 3-methyloctane; 1-(1,4-dimethyl-3-cyclohexen-1-yl)ethanone; terpinolene; ethyl 2-phenylacetate; naphthalene; and seven unknown compounds could be used to classify Argentinean honeys according to their geographical origin with a prediction success of 96% using principal component analysis (PCA), redundancy analysis (RDA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Duru et al. [19] reported that the application of PCA and hierarchical cluster analysis, as a comparative multivariate technique, on the volatile composition of Turkish pine honey showed that nonanal, nonanol, octanol, decanal, phenylacetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, octanal, α-pinene, 4-oxoisophorone, methyl salicylate, isopropyl myristate, limonene, and β-damascenone could be used as marker compounds of these type of honey. The first two components of PCA (PC1 and PC2) explained 41.3% of the total variance. Escriche et al. [6] applied PCA on the volatile composition of Spanish citrus, sunflower, and thyme honey, and reported that methyl anthranilate, 1-para-menthene-9-al, limonene, dill-ether, and ethyl linalool could be used for the differentiation of honeys. The total variance explained by the first two components (PC1 and PC2) was 67%. However, there is a lack in the relevant literature for a conclusive index originating from volatile compound composition to be used for discrimination purposes (geographical or botanical origin determination)."
