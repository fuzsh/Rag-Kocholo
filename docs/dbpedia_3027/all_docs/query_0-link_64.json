Thus, the Court may not exercise jurisdiction with respect to the crime of aggression.\n\nThe Court’s jurisdiction over the crime was made dependent on the Assembly of State Parties (ASP) agreeing on a definition in accordance with the now deleted Article 5(2). In 2002 the ASP decided to establish a Special Working Group on the Crime of Aggression (SWGCA), which was to submit proposed provisions to a future Review Conference [Resolution on Continuity of Work in Respect of the Crime of Aggression, 2002]. The SWGCA draft amendments were the starting point for the discussions at the Kampala Review Conference in 2010, where <link typo3 case-m klamberg-commentary rome-statute>Articles 8 bis, <link typo3 case-m klamberg-commentary rome-statute>15 bis, <link typo3 case-m klamberg-commentary rome-statute>15 ter and <link typo3 case-m klamberg-commentary rome-statute>25 (3) <link typo3 case-m klamberg-commentary rome-statute>bis were adopted. It follows from <link typo3 case-m klamberg-commentary rome-statute>Articles 5 bis (3) and <link typo3 case-m klamberg-commentary rome-statute>15 ter (3) that the Court will first by 2017 have the power to exercise jurisdiction over the crime, provide that 30 States Parties have ratified or accepted the amendments.\n\nDoctrine:\n\nGerhard Werle, Principles of International Criminal Law, TMC Asser Press, The Hague, 2005, pp. 400-401, MN 1184-1185.\n\nHerman von Hebel/Darryl Robinson, \"Crimes Within the Jurisdiction of the Court\", in Roy S.

The legal and the ordinary concept of genocide\n\nA principal difficulty relating to the interpretation of the concept of genocide arises from the widespread use of the term. The 'ordinary' concept, which exists outside its legal parameters, has been stretched to fit a wide variety of scenarios. The word is commonly employed in particular in reference to campaigns involving the killing of a large number of victims. The legal concept, as it appears in identical phrasing in the texts of Article 6 ICC Statute, Article 4(2) ICTY Statute, Article 2(2) ICTR Statute and Article II of the Genocide Convention, differs from that (see below at C.), but there is evidence that the ordinary concept has influenced the views of tribunals and individual judges. In Kayishema and Ruzindana for instance, the ICTR Trial Chamber quoted with approval the opinion that it was 'virtually impossible' for genocide to be committed without State involvement, 'given the magnitude of this crime' (Prosecutor v Clément Kayishema and Obed Ruzindana, (Case No. ICTR-95-1-T), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 21 May 1999, para 94.) For the impact of the ordinary concept of genecide on the ICJ judgment in Croatia v Serbia, see Behrens. The legal concept, at least pursuant to the literal interpretation of the Rome Statute, requires neither magnitude (on the objective side of the crime) nor State involvement nor even the involvement of more than one perpetrator. (But see below at ii. for the contextual element).\n\nii. Contextual element\n\nAn attempt to introduce a contextual element into the legal concept of genocide was made through the 'Elements of Crime' in 2000 (see last element of each of the alternatives of genocide in the Elements of Crime).\n\nA literal reading of the crime as it appears in the ICC Statute does not suggest that organisational structure, pattern, magnitude or other contextual elements have become of the concept of genocide. It is for that reason that the establishment of contextual elements in the Elements of Crime is a problematic feature. Triffterer for one has voiced the view that the requirement of a context is not consistent with the wording of the statute and thus conflicts with Article 9 of the Rome Statute (Triffterer 2001a, 407). In Al-Bashir, however, the majority of the Pre-Trial Chamber found that the application of the Elements of Crime could only be refused if this would lead to an 'irreconcilable contradiction' with the Statute of the court, Prosecutor v Omar Al Bashir, ICC PT. Ch., Decision on the Prosecution's Application for a Warrant of Arrest against Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, ICC-02/05-01/09-3, 4 March 2009, para 128), but concluded that, '[i]n the case at hand', such a contradiction did not exist (ibid., para 132). If a contextual element along these lines were accepted, it would in any event not reflect customary international law that existed before the entry into force of the Elements of Crime (see also Krstic' (Appeals Chamber, para 24).\n\nOn the requirement of a 'manifest pattern of similar conduct', the Pre-Trial Chamber noted that the 'crime of genocide is only completed when the relevant conduct presents a concrete threat to the existence of the targeted group, or a part thereof.' (Pre-Trial Chamber, Al-Bashir, PT. Ch., 4 March 2009, para 124). That threat had to be 'concrete and real, as opposed to just being latent or hypothetical'(ibid.). In her dissenting opinion, Judge Ušacka took exception to the 'result-based' reading to which the majority view would lead, and stated that the requirement of a threat 'would then duplicate the purpose of the second part' of the contextual element (Al-Bashir, ICC PT. Ch., Arrest Warrant Decision, ICC-02/05-01/09-3, 4 March 2009, Dissenting Opinion Judge Ušacka, para 26), ie, 'conduct that could itself effect such destruction'.\n\nWith regard to that element, the majority found that it referred to conduct of 'such a nature as to itself effect […] the total or partial destruction of the targeted group' (Al-Bashir, Pre-Trial Chamber, Arrest Warrant Decision, ICC-02/05-01/09-3, 4 March 2009, para 123).\n\niii. Evidentiary issues\n\nQuestions of evidence cause particular problems in relation to the existence of specific genocidal intent (See below, notes 34 - 38). The ICTR Appeals Chamber has accepted that this element can be proven through circumstantial evidence, but it also emphasised that a finding of intent must still be 'the only reasonable inference from the totality of the evidence', (Prosecutor v Ferdinand Nahimana, Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, Hassan Ngeze, (Case No. ICTR-99-52-T), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 3 December 2003, para 524). That requirement allows for a critical approach towards strands of evidence which were accepted by the Trial Chambers as suitable indications for genocidal intent.\n\nWith regard to incriminating evidence, the ad hoc tribunals have accepted for a long time that genocidal intent can be inferred from the actions of the perpetrator at the time of the commission of the crime (Prosecutor v Jean-Paul Akayesu, (Case No. ICTR-96-4-T), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 2 September 1998, para 523).\n\nBut even actions of this kind may allow for a range of inferences (Behrens 2007, 136). The 'scale of the atrocities' (see Prosecutor v André Ntagerura, Emmanuel Bagambiki, Samuel Imanishimwe, (Case No. ICTR-99-46-T), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 25 February 2004, para 690) and the 'manner of the killing' (see Prosecutor v Ntagerura et al, ICTR T. Ch., 22 Dec. 2008, para. 689) cause particular problems in that regard, as crimes against humanity can be committed in an equally cruel fashion and are, because of their contextual element, likely to result in large scale atrocities.\n\nThe ad hoc tribunals have also given weight to statements which the accused had made at the relevant time (Prosecutor v Kayishema, ICTR T. Ch., 21 May 1999, para 93). In this regard, the fact must be taken into account that a defendant's statements will require interpretation in light of their context (see Prosecutor v Kayishema, ICTR T. Ch., 21 May 1999, para 539, on the phrases 'go to work' or 'get down to work').\n\nPreparatory work\n\nThe introduction of the concept of this crime into international law can be traced to the work of the Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin, who in Axis Rule in Occupied Europe (Washington 1944), used the term ‘genocide’ to refer to the ‘destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group’ (ibid., chapter 9). Before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, ‘genocide’ was mentioned in the text of the indictment, but it did not form an independent charge against the defendants – it was rather seen as conduct which fulfilled the parameters of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nIn 1946, General Assembly Resolution 96(I) recognised genocide as a ‘crime under international law’ and understood it to mean ‘the denial of the right of existence of entire human groups’ (GA Res 96(I)). In that Resolution, the General Assembly also requested the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) to ‘undertake the necessary studies, with a view to drawing up a draft convention on the crime of genocide’ (ibid.).\n\nThe UN Secretariat subsequently issued a first draft of a genocide convention, which was then reviewed by an Ad Hoc Committee convened by ECOSOC, resulting in a second draft. A third draft was issued by the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly in 1948 and submitted to the General Assembly for adoption. The resulting convention – the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide – was adopted on 8 December 1948 and entered into force on 12 January 1951. One of the most important changes which materialised during the codification process, was the shifting emphasis of the crime: where the 1946 General Assembly Resolution still put an objective aspect of genocide at the centre of the concept, the crime as enshrined in the Genocide Convention receives its particular characteristic through its subjective side ('intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such').\n\nFurther insight into the interpretation of the crime is provided through the ILC commentary on Article 17 of the 1996 Draft Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind (YILC 1996, vol 2, part 2, at 44). But the definition of genocide as it appears in Article II of the Genocide Convention has remained textually unchanged in the ICC Statute.\n\nAuthor: Paul Behrens\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 6 - with intent\n\n[34] C. Analysis of Provisions and Sub-Provisions with intent\n\nNext to the group element, it is the existence of destructive intent which gives the crime its particular character (cf Prosecutor v Radoslav Brđanin, (Case No. IT-99-36-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 1 September 2004, para 699).\n\nThe intent element is not merely a counterpart to an already existing factor on the side of the actus reus, but has an existence outside and above the latter. The ICTY Trial Chamber in Prosecutor v Milomir Stakić, (Case No. IT-97-24-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 31 July 2003, thus spoke of a crime distinguished 'by a \"surplus\" of intent' (para 520).\n\nThe precise threshold for genocidal intent has been subject of controversy. A majority of the Chambers of the ad hoc tribunals resorts to terms which imply a volitional standard: the perpetrator 'seeks to achieve' the destruction (eg, Prosecutor v Goran Jelisić, (Case No. IT-95-10-A), ICTY A. Ch., Judgment, 5 July 2001, paras 45-46), or he must have had the 'goal' of destroying the group (Prosecutor v Radislav Krstić, (Case No. IT-98-33-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 2 August 2001, paras 571, 572). The ILC expressed a similar view when it found that 'a general awareness of the probable consequences' of a genocidal act was not sufficient (YILC 1996, vol 2, part 2, 44, Article 17, para. 5).\n\nSupporters of the cognitive opinion focus on the knowledge of the perpetrator: in Jelisi‍for instance, the Prosecution stated that it was sufficient for the mental element that the perpetrator 'knew that his acts were destroying, in whole or in part, the group, as such', and made clear that such knowledge must refer to actual (as opposed to probable) destruction (Prosecutor v Jelisić, ICTY A. Ch., 5 July 2001, para 42). For further references in the literature, see Behrens 2012a, 77, 78).\n\nHowever, the lower cognitive standard has that far not found favour with the international criminal tribunals – with some Trial Chambers stating expressly that knowledge of inevitable or likely destructive consequences was not sufficient for the conviction of the defendant (Prosecutor v Vidoje Blagojevic' and Dragan Jokic', (Case No. IT-02-60-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 17 January 2005, para 656).\n\nAuthor: Paul Behrens\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 6 - to destroy\n\n[35] to destroy\n\nIn the eyes of the ILC, 'destruction' referred only to the 'material destruction of a group either by physical or by biological means'; other forms of destruction were expressly dismissed (YILC 1996 II / 2, 46, para 12). A more inclusive view has been supported by the Constitutional Court of Germany, which in 2000 found that destructive intent extended 'beyond physical and biological extermination' (BVerfG, para. (III)(4)(a) (aa)). In his partially dissenting opinion in Krstić, Judge Shahabuddeen found that the destruction of the group as a 'social 'unit' was embraced by the intention of the perpretrator (Prosecutor v Radislav Krstić, (Case No. IT-98-33-A), ICTY A. Ch., Judgment, 19 April 2004, Partial Dissenting Opinion of Judge Shahabuddeen, para 51).\n\nIn the case law of the ad hoc tribunals, there is however a strong tendency to follow the narrower view: in Prosecutor v Seromba, (Case No. ICTR-2001-66-I), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 13 December 2006, for instance, the Trial Chamber found that the concept of 'destruction of the group' (in the context of genocidal intent) referred to the 'material destruction of a group either by physical or by biological means […]' (para 319. See also Tournaye, 454). It is certainly true that a group can be destroyed in more ways than through the killing of its members or the prevention of births (Prosecutor v Blagojevic', ICTY T. Ch.,17 January 2005, para 666), but the inclusion of all kinds of destruction is also likely to lead to such an extensive understanding of the crime that its threshold disappears. The existence of national group for example, could effectively be terminated through mere changes in the legal personality of the State, including its voluntary merger with another State.\n\nApart from that, the fact cannot be dismissed that the option of including other forms of destruction had existed at drafting stage but was ultimately rejected (see Prosecutor v Radislav Krstić, (Case No. IT-98-33-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 2 August 2001, para 576, fn 1284); a comprehensive view of the codification history therefore does not yield a result which supports the wider view.\n\nAuthor: Paul Behrens\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 6 - in whole or in part\n\n[36] in whole or in part\n\nThe phrase 'in whole or in part' was introduced at the drafting stage through a suggestion by Norway, which the Sixth Committee accepted (UN GAOR, 3rd session, 6th Committee, 73rd meeting, 92, 97); but its interpretation has ever since been subject of much debate in the literature and the international criminal tribunals.\n\nIt does seem well accepted today that the intended destruction must refer at least to a 'substantial part' of the relevant group (see e.g. Prosecutor v Radoslav Brđanin, (Case No. IT-99-36-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 1 September 2004, para 701; YILC 1996 II / 2, 45, para 8 and Prosecutor v Radislav Krstić, (Case No. IT-98-33-A), ICTY A. Ch., Judgment, 19 April 2004, para 11). However, the determination of 'substantiality' has caused interpretive problems to the tribunals and commentators. In international case law, three general methods have been established to evaluate substantiality: the numerical, the functional, and the geographical approach.\n\nThe Trial Chamber in Prosecutor v Kayishema, (Case No. ICTR-95-1-T), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 21 May 1999, for instance promoted the numerical approach, when it found that 'in part' required the 'intention to destroy a considerable number of individuals who are part of the group' (para 97; see also Preparatory Committee, Report of the Preparatory Committee on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court, 14 April 1998, A/CONF.183/2/Add.1 – p. 11, Article 5, footnote 1). Later case law was more cautious: The Krstić Appeals Chamber for instance, saw it as a 'necessary' starting point, but 'not in all cases the ending point of the inquiry' (para 12). In any event, the assessment of the numerical significance of the part is not exhausted by an examination of actual numbers, but also needs to involve an evaluation of the part of the group in relation to the overall group size (ibid.).\n\nUnder the 'functional approach', the perpetrator is not necessarily seen as selecting a numerically significant part, but instead a section which has significance for the group because of particular functions associated with it. Whitaker referred in that regard to 'a significant section of a group such as its leadership' (Whitaker Report, para 29). The precise methods of assessing substantiality under the functional approach vary from situation to situation. In Brđanin, reference was made to the 'prominence' which the targeted part enjoyed within the group (Prosecutor v Radoslav Brđanin, (Case No. IT-99-36-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 1 September 2004, para 702); and the Appeals Chamber in Prosecutor v Radislav Krstić, (Case No. IT-98-33-A), ICTY A. Ch., Judgment, 19 April 2004, expressed the view that the targeted Bosnian Muslims of Srebrenica were 'emblematic of the Bosnian Muslims in general' (at para 37 and see para 16; see also Prosecutor v Zdravko Tolimir (Case No. IT-99-36-T), ICTY A. Ch. Judgment, 8 April 2015, para 261).\n\nA section which features often in the considerations of the tribunals is the leadership of the group (e.g. Brđanin, ICTY T. Ch., 1 September 2004, para 703). Other sections which have been mentioned by tribunals and commentators include men of military age – a consideration which played a particular role in Krstić, where the killing of the Bosnian Muslim men in Srebrenica was concerned (Krstić, ICTY T. Ch., 2 August 2001, para 579) – and law enforcement or security personnel (Commission of Experts, para 94). Like the numerical approach, the assessment of substantiality here also involves an evaluation of the effect that the targeting of this part has on the group as a whole (Prosecutor v Goran Jelisić, (Case No. IT-95-10-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 14 December 1999, para 82).\n\nA particular concern which attaches to the functional approach is the fact that its application might defeat the very purpose of establishing a threshold through substantiality. The problem gained prominence in the Krstić case. According to the Defence, the Trial Chamber had concluded that Krstić had targeted the Bosnian Muslim men of military age of Srebrenica. These formed part of the Bosnian Muslims of Srebrenica, which in turn were part of the actual protected group – the Bosnian Muslims (Krstić, ICTY A. Ch., 19 April 2004, para 18). In the words of the Defence, the Trial Chamber had therefore identified 'part of a part' of a group (Prosecutor v Radislav Krstić, (Case No. IT-98-33-A), ICTY A. Ch., Judgment, 19 April 2004, Partial Dissenting Opinion of Judge Shahabuddeen, para 43). If the Bosnian Muslim men of Srebrenica were just seen as part of the protected group as a whole (the Bosnian Muslims), it would not have been acceptable to consider them as fulfilling the sustantiality requirement (Krstić, ICTY A. Ch., 19 April 2004, para 18).\n\nThe Appeals Chamber did not follow this line of reasoning and concluded that the military-aged men had been considered not as 'part of a part' of a group, but that their killing had formed evidence for the fact that the perpetrator had intent to destroy a (substantial) part of the group, ie, the Bosnian Muslims of Srebrenica (ibid.). At the same time, the Chamber also clarified that the functional approach was 'only one of several' methods to assess the substantiality of the group (ibid., para 22). In Tolimir, the Trial Chamber had referred to the killing of three community leaders as evidence for the existence of genocidal intent (Prosecutor v Zdrakvo Tolimir, (Case No. IT-05-88/2-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 12 December 2012, paras 780 - 782. The Appeals Chamber found that the Trial Chamber had failed to show that the fate of the community leaders had had an impact 'on the survival of the group as such' (Prosecutor v Zdravko Tolimir (Case No. IT-05-88/2-A), ICTY A. Ch., Judgment, 8 April 2015, para 267), but found no legal errr in the general derivation of genocidal intent from the targeting of leading figures of a community (ibid., para 263).\n\nThe 'geographical approach' is based on the understanding of genocide as a crime which is by necessity limited by geographical conditions. In 1982 for instance, the General Assembly referred to localised massacres – the killing of Palestinian civilians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps – as 'genocide' (UNGA Res 37/123D (1982)) and the ILC pointed out that the intended destruction of a protected group 'from every corner of the globe' was not a necessary requirement of the crime (YILC 1996 II / 2, 45, Article 17, para 8).\n\nThe geographical approach has, on the whole, been embraced by the ad hoc tribunals (cf Prosecutor v Brđanin, ICTY T. Ch., 1 September 2004, para 703). Some Trial Chambers went so far as to find that the 'part' of the group might be limited to a single region or community (Prosecutor v Duško Sikirica, Damir Došen, Dragan Kolundžija, (Case No. IT-95-8-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgement on Defence Motion to Acquit, 3 September 2001, para 68). In Prosecutor v Krstić, ICTY T. Ch., 19 April 2004, the Trial Chamber outlined the possibility that genocide might be committed even in a municipality, and made express reference to the General Assembly resolution on Sabra and Shatila (para 589).\n\nOpposition to the geographical method tends not to concern the basic principle that genocidal intent can be limited to a particular area, but rather seeks to introduce certain limitations on the approach. In Prosecutor v Brđanin, ICTY T. Ch., 1 September 2004, the Trial Chamber expressed the view that a limitation of the 'part' of the group to certain municipalities of the Autonomous Region of the Krajina could have a 'distorting effect' (para 966). Similar concerns were voiced by the ICTY Trial Chamber in Prosecutor v Milomir Stakić, (Case No. IT-97-24-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 31 July 2003, which however followed the geographical approach 'with some hesitancy' (para 523).\n\nAdditional problems arise from the fact that the perpetrator will in some cases specifically have limited his intent to a particular region and therefore not have targeted the group 'as such'. Situations of this kind arise when a municipality or other geographic area is selected as the target of a punitive expedition – acts which will usually be covered by crimes against humanity, but might, because of their very limited nature, not fulfil the requirements of genocidal intent.\n\nAuthor: Paul Behrens\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 6 - a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\n\n[37] a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\n\nThe Elements of Crime clarify that the ‘group element’ carries significance both for the objective and the subjective part of the crime. On the objective side, the victim of the perpetrator’s conduct must belong to a ‘particular national, ethnical, racial or religious group’ (Elements of Crime, Article 6, element 2 of each alternative); on the subjective side, the perpetrator must have had the intent ‘to destroy, in whole or in part' a group of this kind (ibid., element 3 of each alternative).\n\nThe ICTR Trial Chamber in Prosecutor v Akayesu, (Case No. ICTR-96-4-T), Judgment, 2 September 1998, defined a ‘national group’ as a group whose members are seen as sharing a ‘legal bond, based on common citizenship, coupled with reciprocity of rights and duties’ (para 512), an ethnic group as a group ‘whose members share a common language or culture’ (para 513). The characteristics of members of a racial group were seen as their ‘hereditary physical traits often identified with a geographical region, irrespective of linguistic, cultural, national or religious factors’ (ibid., para 514) and members of a religious group ‘share the same religion, denomination or mode of worship’ (ibid., para 515).\n\nApart from the controversial nature inherent in the selection of only certain groups for the protection of international criminal law in this regard (see Behrens 2012b, at 240, 241), the group element has also led to difficulties where its application in practice is concerned.\n\nThe attempt to reach a precise distinction between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda for instance – groups which shared the same culture and language and which showed a ‘high rate of mixed marriages’ (Cassese, 101) – posed challenges where the parameters of the four enumerated groups were concerned.\n\nBut the later case law of the ad hoc tribunals has not followed an entirely objective approach. In Kayishema and Ruzinadana, the ICTR would also have included at least under the category of 'ethnic groups' a group which ‘distinguishes itself, as such (self identification); or, a group identified as such by others, including perpetrators of the crimes (identification by others), (Prosecutor v Clément Kayishema and Obed Ruzindana, (Case No. ICTR-95-1-T), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 21 May 1999, para 98).\n\nThe approach which was eventually adopted by the Trial Chambers is best understood as a 'contextual approach' – referred to in the Semanza judgment as a method by which the identification of a group ‘ought to be assessed on a case-by-case basis by reference to the objective particulars of a given social and historical context, and by the subjective perceptions of the perpetrator’ (Prosecutor v Laurent Semanza, (Case No. ICTR-97-20-T), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 15 May 2003, para 317). The Chamber found that group identification was to be made ‘on a case-by-case basis, consulting both objective and subjective criteria’ (ibid.).\n\nA similar difficulty exists where the identification of members of a group is concerned. In this regard, the existing case law appears to favour a subjective approach: membership of the group was to be considered 'from a subjective standpoint, holding that the victim is perceived by the perpetrator of the crime as belonging to the group targeted for destruction.' (Prosecutor v Seromba, ICTR T. Ch., 13 December 2006, para 318).\n\nAuthor: Paul Behrens\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 6 - as such\n\n[38] as such\n\nThe inclusion of the words 'as such' indicates that the boundaries between genocidal intent and motive, if they do exist, are difficult to identify (see Behrens 2012c). During the drafting process, the Ad Hoc Committee had suggested a list of motives that would form the basis for the genocidal acts. This suggestion triggered considerable debate in the Sixth Committee. In the end, an express reference to motives was not included, but the Committee agreed to a proposal by Venezuela which introduced the words 'as such' into the crime. The Venezuelan delegate, speaking to his amendment, stated that he 'felt that his amendment should meet the views of those who wished to retain a statement of motives; indeed, the motives were implicitly included in the words \"as such\"' (Pérez Perozo (Venezuela), UN Doc. A/C.6/SR.76, 124). Subsequently, some Trial Chambers have made use of the language of motives when referring to specific intent: the Akayesu Trial Chamber went so far as to refer to an 'ulterior motive, which is to destroy, in whole or in part, the group' (Prosecutor v Jean-Paul Akayesu, (Case No. ICTR-96-4-T), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 2 September 1998, para 522).\n\nThe phrase 'as such' also emphasises the fact that the (principal) victim of genocide is the group itself (Prosecutor v Radoslav Brđanin, (Case No. IT-99-36-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 1 September 2004, para 698) – a notion which is apparent from the codification history of the crime (Ad Hoc Committee on Genocide, Note by the Secretariat, UN Doc E/AC.25/3/Rev.1, 12 April 1948, 6 and YILC 1996, vol 2, part 2, 45, Article 17, para 6). The group must have been targeted as a 'separate and distinct entity' (Prosecutor v Popović et al., ICTY T. Ch., 10 June 2010, paras 821 and 1177 with further references). The individuals affected by the underlying acts are, by comparison, victims only because of their membership of that particular group (Prosecutor v Radislav Krstić, (Case No. IT-98-33-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 2 August 2001, para 561).\n\nThis prominent role of the group element on the subjective side of the crime raises the question whether genocide is possible if perpetrators attack members of their own group. The issue gained particular prominence in the context of the large scale crimes which the Khmer Rouge committed on the Khmer people in Cambodia. The UN Commission on Human Rights, reflecting on these events, coined the term 'autogenocide' (Commission on Human Rights, 35th session, Summary Record of the First Part (Public) of the 1510th Meeting, UN Doc. E/CN.4/SR.1510 (1979), paras 22, 24). The term lacks legal currency, but has been at the centre of some debate among commentators of the crime.\n\nIn its discussion of genocide, the Group of Experts for Cambodia declined to take a position on the question whether the Khmer Rouge possessed destructive intent with regard to the Khmer people (Report of the Group of Experts for Cambodia established pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 52 / 135, (1999), Annex, para 65). Before the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, Ieng Sary and other Khmer Rouge leaders were in 2010 indicted for genocide committed against the Cham and the Vietnamese, but not against the Khmer people (Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, Office of the Co-Investigating Judges, Closing Order, (Case No 002/I9-09-2007-ECCC-OCIJ), 15 December 2010, paras 1335 – 1349 and 1613.).\n\nIn the literature, some authors have supported the opinion that auto-genocide still qualifies as genocide, as it involves the intended destruction of part of a protected group (Khan / Dixon, 1088, paras 13 – 25, Hannum, 103 et seq, 112). The Trial Chambers on the other hand have emphasised that the individual victims must have been targeted 'specifically because they belonged' to the protected group (Prosecutor v Akayesu, ICTR T. Ch., 2 September 1998, para 521). In the Cambodian case, this lends support to the opposing view, since the Khmer victims were selected for political and other reasons, but not on the basis of their membership of a group protected by the Convention (Vest 1999, 356).\n\nThere is in fact no reason why autogenocide should not be covered by Article 6. But autogenocide, if the concept is to be applied correctly, requires that the perpetrator deliberately made his own group the victim of his actions. There is perhaps a tendency to dismiss too quickly the possibility of self-destructive genocidaires. In the majority of cases however, the perpetrator will probably have an inflated rather than a dismissive perception of his own people, leaving only a slim realm for the reality of 'genuine' autogenocide.\n\nCross-references:\n\n1. Elements Digest\n\n2. Means of Proof Digest\n\nAuthor: Paul Behrens\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 6(a)\n\n[39] (a) Killing members of the group;\n\nThe Elements of Crime provide that '[t]he term “killed” is interchangeable with the term “caused death”' (Article 6(a), note 10). That indicates that the death of the victim is a necessary consequence of the perpetrator's conduct and that a causal link needs to exist between conduct and consequence. To that degree, the elements of 'killing' as one of the alternatives of genocide do not appear to show any significant deviation from the elements identified under 'murder' as a crime against humanity (see Prosecutor v Mitar Vasiljević, (Case No. IT-98-32-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 29 November 2002, para 205, notes 1 and 2.).\n\nHowever, the conclusion (suggested by some Trial Chambers) that all elements of that crime against humanity are equivalent to the elements of 'killing' here (see on this Prosecutor v Vujadin Popović, Ljubisa Beara, Drago Nikolić, Ljubomir Borovčanin, Radivoje Miletić, Milan Gvero, Vinko Pandurević, (Case No. IT-05-88-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 10 June 2010, para 810, referring to paras 787-789), remains a generalisation. On the side of the mens rea, at least, certain differences arise. With regard to murder as a crime against humanity, the intention to cause serious bodily harm which 'the accused should reasonably have known might lead to death', has in the past been accepted as a sufficient subjective element (Popović, ICTY T. Ch., 10 June 2010, para 788). If that were the case where genocide is concerned, actual knowledge would no longer be required – even negligence would fulfil the mens rea of alternative (a).\n\nMost Trial Chambers however appear to call for intent with regard to the consequence of the killing. In this regard, the findings in Akayesu are instructive. When considering both the English and the French version of the Genocide Convention, the Chamber found that the French term (meurtre) was to be preferred to the English term 'killing', as the latter could refer even to unintentional homicides (Prosecutor v Jean-Paul Akayesu, (Case No. ICTR-96-4-T), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 2 September 1998, para 500). It consequently interpreted Article 2(2)(a) of the ICTR Statute as meaning homicide 'committed with the intent to cause death' (ibid., para 501). The Chamber had based its opinion on the principle that the interpretation which is more favourable to the accused, had to be preferred (ibid.).\n\nCross-references:\n\n1. Elements of Crime\n\n2. Elements Digest\n\n3. Means of Proof Digest\n\nAuthor: Paul Behrens\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 6(b)\n\n[40] (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;\n\nThe 'harm' to which this alternative of genocide refers, need not be 'permanent and irremediable' (Prosecutor v Akayesu, ICTR T. Ch., 2 September 1998, para 502), but the Seromba Appeals Chamber found that it must be so serious as to cause a threat of the 'destruction [of a protected group] in whole or in part' (Prosecutor v Athanase Seromba, (Case No. ICTR-2001-66-I), ICTR A. Ch., para 46).\n\nIn Krstić, the Trial Chamber noted that the relevant harm must go 'beyond temporary unhappiness, embarrassment or humiliation' (para 513; see also Prosecutor v Tolimir, ICTR A. Ch., 8 April 2015, paras 203, 212) and that it must result 'in a grave and long-term disadvantage to a person’s ability to lead a normal and constructive life' (ibid.). The Elements of Crime and the case law of the tribunals provide examples which qualify in this category, including torture (Elements of Crime, fn 3 to Article 6(b)), 1st element, Prosecutor v Radislav Krstić, (Case No. IT-98-33-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 2 August 2001, para 513), inhuman and degrading treatment (ibid.), rape (ibid. and Prosecutor v Rutaganda, (Case No ICTR-96-3), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 6 December 1999, para 51) and sexual violence (ibid., and Prosecutor v Akayesu, (Case No. ICTR-96-4-T), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 2 September 1998, para 688); but persecution (Akayesu, ICTR T. Ch., 2 September 1998, para 504) and deportations (Krstić, ICTY T. Ch., 2 August 2001 , para 513) have also been mentioned in this context. Threats of death and 'knowledge of impeding death' have been accepted as examples for serious mental harm (Prosecutor v Zdravko Tolimir, Case No. IT-05-88/2-A, ICTY A Ch., Judgment, 8 April 2015, para 206). Forcible transfer, too, can cause serious bodily and mental harm (ibid, paras 208, 209), but a Trial Chamber would also have to find that long-term consequences result from such transfer and that there had been a link between the forcible transfer and the physical destruction of the group (ibid., para 217).\n\nPursuant to Article 30, intent is required both for conduct and consequence of this alternative of genocide. With regard to the former, this means that the perpetrator must have meant to engage in the relevant act; with regard to the latter – the resulting serious bodily or mental harm – Article 30 provides that the perpetrator must have meant to cause the consequence or must have been 'aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events'. The case law of the ad hoc tribunals confirms that the harm must have been inflicted intentionally (Prosecutor v Popović et al., (Case No. IT-05-88-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 10 June 2010, para 811).\n\nCross-references:\n\n1. Elements of Crime\n\n2. Elements Digest\n\n3. Means of Proof Digest\n\nAuthor: Paul Behrens\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 6(c)\n\n[41] (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;\n\nThe infliction of conditions of this kind does not need to be an imposition of methods which would immediately lead to the deaths of group members (Prosecutor v Kayishema and Ruzindana, (Case No. ICTR-95-1-T), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 21 May 1999, para 116). The Tolimir Appeals Chamber went so far as to state that [direct] 'killings' could not be seen as a method of inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about its destruction under this alternative of crime (Prosecutor v Zdravko Tolimir, Case No. IT-05-88/2-A, ICTY A. Ch., Judgment, 8 April 2015, para 228). The ad hoc tribunals have accepted that so-called 'slow death' measures would fulfil the required element of this alternative (Prosecutor v Kayishema and Ruzindana, ICTR T. Ch., 21 May 1999, para 115). Subjecting members of the group to a subsistence diet, the denial of necessary medical services, but also 'systematic expulsion from homes' fall in this category (Prosecutor v Akayesu, (Case No. ICTR-96-4-T), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 2 September 1998, para 506; Prosecutor v Brđanin, (Case No. IT-99-36-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 1 September 2004, para 691).\n\nOther examples which have been mentioned include the failure to provide proper housing, clothing or hygiene or imposition of 'excessive work or physical exertion' (Brđanin, ICTY T. Ch., 1 September 2004 , para 691; Kayishema, ICTR T. Ch., 21 May 1999 , para 115). The destruction of religious sites as a method of inflicting such conditions of life, has been rejected by the ITCY Appeals Chamber (Prosecutor v Zdravko Tolimir, Case No. IT-05-88/2-A, ICTY A. Ch., 8 April 2015, para 230).\n\nThere is, as the Brđanin Trial Chamber confirmed, no need to prove that the group has been physically destroyed in whole or in part (para 691). On the other hand, it would go too far to conclude from that that 'proof of a result' is not required (but on this, see Prosecutor v Stakić, (Case No. IT-97-24-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 31 July 2003, para 517). Alternative (c) does envisage a consequence, but the consequence lies not in the destruction of the group, but in the fact that the relevant conditions have come into existence (see on this Article 6 (c) of the Elements of Crime, which in its first paragraph clarifies that the conditions must have been inflicted).\n\nAs such, this consequence requires a corresponding element on the side of the mens rea of the crime. The term 'deliberately' is an express reference to that element (Genocide Application Case, 69, para 186) which therefore cannot involve a standard lower than intent. However, that does not mean that a requirement of prior planning needs to be read into the adjective (cf Jessberger, 101).\n\nThe term 'calculated' on the other hand is not a reference to the mens rea of the perpetrator – the conditions may well have been calculated by a third party to have this effect (for instance, in cases in which a military commander orders the perpetrator to impose an insufficient diet on inmates of a detention camp). This aspect, relating to the nature of the conditions, is a circumstantial element; the perpetrator must have had knowledge of it as defined in Article 30(3) of the Rome Statute.\n\nCross-references:\n\n1. Starvation in Articles 7(1)(b), (j)and (k); 7(2)(b); 8(2)(a)(iii); 8(2)(b)(ii), (v), (xiii) and (xxv)\n\n2. Elements of Crime\n\n3. Elements Digest\n\n4. Means of Proof Digest\n\nAuthor: Paul Behrens\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 6(d)\n\n[42] (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;\n\nIn the Akayesu case, the ICTR Trial Chamber clarified that it is sufficient for this alternative if the relevant measures have mental effects on the victims. It referred in this regard to the example of rape in cases in which 'the person raped refuses subsequently to procreate, in the same way that members of a group can be led, through threats or trauma, not to procreate' (Prosecutor v Akayesu, (Case No. ICTR-96-4-T), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 2 September 1998, para 508).\n\nIn cases of rape, the perpetrator may also achieve the prevention of births in the group through a different chain of causation: in that regard, the ICTR referred to a situation in which female members of a group in a society in which membership of the group was dependent on the identity of the father, were raped by men of another group (ibid., para 507). In circumstances of this kind, the criminal act might well have been carried out with the intent to impregnate the woman and to 'have her give birth to a child who will consequently not belong to its mother's group.' (ibid.). Other examples include sexual mutilation, sterilisation, sexual segregation, prohibition of marriage and forced birth control (ibid.).\n\nThe ILC made clear that the term 'imposing' implied an element of coercion: and therefore, this rule could, for instance, not be seen as encompassing 'voluntary birth control programmes sponsored by a State as a matter of social policy.' (YILC 1996 II / 2, p 46, Article 17, Commentary, para 16).\n\nIntent is required where the commission of the act (the implementation of the measures) is concerned (Prosecutor v Popović et al., (Case No. IT-05-88-T), ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 10 June 2010, para 808), and Article 30(2)(a) appears to call for a strong volitional element in that regard ('means to engage'). The measure itself, on the other hand, is a circumstantial element, and the required mental element which attaches to it, is therefore cognitive in nature: the perpetrator must have known about the nature of the measures (Article 30(3)). A different reading cannot be derived from the word 'intended', which this alternative of genocide employs (but see also Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro), ICJ, Judgment, 26 February 2007, para 186): the intent to which the wording of Article 6(d) refers, may well have been that of a third party. The intent of the perpetrator, on the other hand, is required for the consequence of the act (Article 30(2)(b)), ie, for the fact that such measures have now come into existence in the protected group.\n\nCross-references:\n\n1. Elements of Crime\n\n2. Elements Digest\n\n3. Means of Proof Digest\n\nAuthor: Paul Behrens\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 6(e)\n\n[43] (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group\n\nThe Elements of Crime specify that the act under this alternative consists in the transfer of one or more persons from a protected group to another group, when these persons belonged to the protected group and were below the age of 18 years (Elements of Crime, Article 6, elements 1, 2, 4 and 5.). The potential age range of the victims is therefore more extensive than that envisaged in other international crimes (see e.g. Article 8(2)(b)(xxvi) ICCSt and Article 8(2)(e)(vii)).\n\nThe transfer must have been carried out in a 'forcible' manner. In that regard, however, the ad hoc tribunals had already emphasised that it was the aim of the provision not only to protect against 'forcible physical transfer', but also against 'acts of threats or trauma' which would accomplish the coercive transfer (Prosecutor v Jean-Paul Akayesu, (Case No. ICTR-96-4-T), ICTR T. Ch., Judgment, 2 September 1998, para 509). Today, the Elements of Crime provide that the word 'forcibly' is 'not restricted to physical force, but may include threat of force or coercion, such as that caused by fear of violence, duress, detention, psychological oppression or abuse of power, against such person or persons or another person, or by taking advantage of a coercive environment.' (Elements of Crime, Article 6, element 1, note 5).\n\nThe perpetrator must have had intent with regard to the consequence of the crime, ie, the completed transfer from one group to another group. However, the fact that the victim of the transfer was a child, is a circumstantial element. In this regard, the Elements of Crime make clear that a standard lower than knowledge is sufficient for the subjective element: it is enough that the perpetrator 'should have known' that the victim had not yet reached the age of 18 years (Elements of Crime, Article 6(e), 6th element) It is one of the rare cases in which the mens rea for one of the underlying acts of genocide deviates from the standard established by Article 30 of the Rome Statute.\n\nCross-references:\n\n1.

For the purpose of this Statute, \"crime against humanity\" means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack:\n\nGeneral Remarks The general elements in the chapeau of Article 7 elevate an ordinary crime or an inhumane conduct to a crime against humanity. The general elements were extensively dealt with during the drafting of the ICC Statute and are set out in Article 7(1) and (2) of the Statute, as well as in the Elements of Crimes [von Hebel and Robinson, 1999, pp. 91-97; McCormack, 2004, pp. 179-182, 186-189]. In the ICC case law, they were analyzed by the Pre-Trial Chamber in Prosecutor v. Bemba in 2008, and its analysis has been largely followed by other Pre-Trial Chambers and the Trial Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Katanga.\n\nAnalysis\n\ni. Definition\n\nCrimes against humanity pursuant to the ICC Statute are any of the enumerated acts in Article 7 ‘when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack’ (ICC Statute, Article 7(1)). According to Article 7(2)(a), an ‘attack directed against any civilian population’ means ‘a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack’. These words are repeated in the Elements of Crimes.\n\nFor each of the underlying acts, the Elements of Crimes set out that the conduct must have been ‘committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population’. Further, they state that the perpetrator must have known ‘that the conduct was part of or intended the conduct to be part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population’.\n\nBased on the above, the Pre-Trial Chambers have identified five general elements:\n\n‘(i) an attack directed against any civilian population, (ii) a State or organizational policy, (iii) the widespread or systematic nature of the attack, (iv) a nexus between the individual act and the attack, and (v) knowledge of the attack’ [Situation in the Republic of Kenya, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/09-19, Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorization of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of Kenya, 31 March 2010, para. 79; Situation in the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, ICC PT. Ch. III, ICC-02/11-14, Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorisation of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, 3 October 2011, para. 29].\n\nNotably, the general elements do not contain any requirement of a nexus to an armed conflict or any discriminatory element [von Hebel and Robinson, 1999, pp. 92-94; McCormack, 2004, pp. 184-186; Robinson, 1999, pp. 45-47; Schabas, 2010, pp. 144-147, 157].\n\nii. Requirements\n\na. Material elements\n\nWith regard to the requirement of ‘attack’, the Elements of Crimes clarify that ‘[t]he acts need not constitute a military attack’. Although the ICC Statute itself defines ‘attack’ as ‘course of conduct’, the Pre-Trial Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Bemba considered that the term referred to ‘a campaign or operation’, although adding that the ‘appropriate terminology used in [the ICC Statute] being a “course of conduct”’ [Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/05-01/08-424, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 75]. The Pre-Trial Chamber set out that it is the commission of the acts referred to in Article 7(1) that constitute the ‘attack’ and ‘beside the commission of the acts, no additional requirement for the existence of an “attack” should be proven’ [Ibid.]. This does not necessarily mean that the element of ‘attack’ is proven, as soon as the underlying acts allegedly committed by the perpetrator are proven [see Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/05-01/08-424, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 151]. Presumably the Pre-Trial Chamber merely intended to say that an attack must be composed of acts enumerated in Article 7(1) (as opposed to other acts). In this respect, the Pre-Trial Chamber could have found support in the text of Article 7 itself, although it did cite the Akayesu Trial Judgment, which does not support this [see Akayesu, ICTR-96-4, ICTR T. Ch., 2 September 1998, para. 581 (‘The concept of attack maybe (sic) defined as a (sic) unlawful act of the kind enumerated in Article 3(a) to (i) of the Statute […] An attack may also be non violent in nature, like imposing a system of apartheid […] or exerting pressure on the population to act in a particular manner’].\n\nThe same Pre-Trial Chamber stated that the requirement of ‘directed against’ means that ‘the civilian population must be the primary object of the attack and not just an incidental victim of the attack’ [Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/05-01/08-424, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 76, citing ICTY case law, in particular Prosecutor v Kunarac et al., IT-96-23 & 23/2, ICTY A. Ch., 12 June 2002, paras 91-92].\n\nWith regard to the element of ‘population’, the Pre-Trial Chamber implied a low threshold by stating that the Prosecutor must demonstrate ‘that the attack was such that it cannot be characterised as having been directed against only a limited and randomly selected group of individuals’. It added that the entire population of the geographical area where the attack is taking place need not have been targeted [Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/05-01/08-424, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 77]. In this respect, the Pre-Trial Chamber cited ICTY and ICTR case law, in particular the Kunarac Appeal Judgement [Prosecutor v Kunarac et al., IT-96-23 & 23/2, ICTY A. Ch., 12 June 2002, para. 90].\n\nThe Pre-Trial Chamber noted that the term ‘civilian’ is not defined in the Statute but that ‘according to the well-established principle of international humanitarian law, “[t]he civilian population (…) comprises all persons who are civilians as opposed to members of armed forces and other legitimate combatants”’ [Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/05-01/08-424, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 78; also cited by Prosecutor v Katanga, ICC T. Ch. II, ICC-01/04-01/07-3436, Jugement rendu en application de l’Article 74 du Statut, 7 March 2014, para. 1102]. In this respect, the Pre-Trial Chamber cited the Trial Judgement in the Kunarac case [Prosecutor v Kunarac et al., IT-96-23 & 23/2, ICTY Trial Ch., 22 February 2001, para. 425], although any reference to the ICTY Appeals Chamber’s later extensive analysis of this issue is notably absent [see Prosecutor v Martić, IT-95-11, ICTY A. Ch., 8 October 2008, paras 291-314 and Prosecutor v Mrkšić and Šljivančanin, IT-95-13/1, ICTY A. Ch., 5 May 2009, paras 23-34].\n\nThe requirement of ‘widespread or systematic’ is disjunctive [see Situation in the Republic of Kenya, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/09-19, Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorization of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of Kenya, 31 March 2010, para. 94]. The issue of whether this should be a disjunctive or a conjunctive test was extensively debated by the drafters of the ICC Statute [see, inter alia, von Hebel and Robinson, 1999; Robinson, 1999, p. 47].\n\nWith regard to ‘widespread’, the Pre-Trial Chambers in the cases Prosecutor v. Katanga and Ngudjolo and Prosecutor v. Gbagbo stated that it ‘connotes the large-scale nature of the attack and the number of targeted persons’ [Prosecutor v Katanga and Ngudjolo, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/07-717, Decision on the confirmation of charges, 30 September 2008, para. 394; Prosecutor v Gbagbo, ICC PT. Ch. I, Decision on the Confirmation of Charges against Laurent Gbagbo, ICC-02/11-01/11-656-Red, 12 June 2014, para. 222]. The Pre-Trial Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Bemba restricted it further by stating that that it ‘connotes the large-scale nature of the attack, which should be massive, frequent, carried out collectively with considerable seriousness and directed against a multiplicity of victims’ [Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/05-01/08-424, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 83, citing Prosecutor v Akayesu, ICTR-96-4, ICTR T. Ch., 2 September 1998, para. 580].\n\nHowever, the Bemba and Katanga and Ngudjolo Pre-Trial Chambers also concluded that a widespread attack entailed ‘an attack carried out over a large geographical area or an attack in a small geographical area directed against a large number of civilians’. [Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/05-01/08-424, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 83; Prosecutor v Katanga and Ngudjolo, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/07-717, Decision on the Confirmation of Charges, 30 September 2008, para. 395]. Therefore, it appears that the main considerations are the geographical scope of the attack and the number of victims. According to the Katanga Pre-Trial Chamber, even in the context of a systematic attack the requirement of ‘multiple acts’ would ensure that the attack involves a multiplicity of victims [Prosecutor v Katanga and Ngudjolo, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/07-717, Decision on the confirmation of charges, 30 September 2008, para. 398].\n\nAs for ‘systematic’, the Katanga and Ngudjolo and the Gbagbo Pre-Trial Chambers stated that this element refers to ‘the organised nature of the acts of violence and the improbability of their random occurrence’ [Prosecutor v Katanga and Ngudjolo, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/07-717, Decision on the confirmation of charges, 30 September 2008, para. 394, citing Kordić and Čerkez, ICTY A. Ch., 17 December 2004, para. 94, which is citing Prosecutor v Kunarac et al., IT-96-23 & 23/2, ICTY A. Ch., 12 June 2002, para. 94; Prosecutor v Gbagbo, ICC PT. Ch. I, Decision on the Confirmation of Charges against Laurent Gbagbo, ICC-02/11-01/11-656-Red, 12 June 2014, para. 223].\n\nRegarding the element of ‘policy to commit such attack’, the Elements of Crimes set out ‘that the State or organization actively promote or encourage such an attack against a civilian population’. In a footnote, the drafters added that ‘a policy may, in exceptional circumstances, be implemented by a deliberate failure to take action, which is consciously aimed at encouraging such attack’ but that ‘[t]he existence of such a policy cannot be inferred solely from the absence of governmental or organizational action’.\n\nThe Pre-Trial Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Katanga and Ngudjolo correctly linked this element to the elements of widespread or systematic:\n\n‘in the context of a widespread attack, the requirement of an organizational policy […] ensures that the attack, […] must still be thoroughly organised and follow a regular pattern’ [Katanga and Ngudjolo, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/07-717, Decision on the confirmation of charges, 30 September 2008, para. 396].\n\nThe Pre-Trial Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Gbagbo added:\n\n‘the concept of “policy” and that of the “systematic” nature of the attack […] both refer to a certain level of planning of the attack. In this sense, evidence of planning, organisation or direction by a State or organisation may be relevant to prove both the policy and the systematic nature of the attack, although the two concepts should not be conflated as they serve different purposes and imply different thresholds under Article 7(1) and (2)(a) of the Statute’ [Gbagbo, ICC PT. Ch. I, Decision on the Confirmation of Charges against Laurent Gbagbo, ICC-02/11-01/11-656-Red, 12 June 2014, para. 216].\n\nRegardless of this statement by the Gbagbo Pre-Trial Chamber, the definition of ‘attack directed against any civilian population’ in Article 7(2) reduces the significance of the disjunctive, as opposed to a conjunctive test, for the characterization of the attack (‘widespread or systematic’) [see Schabas, 2010, p. 143].\n\nThe Pre-Trial Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Bemba discussed the element of policy, stating that it implied that ‘the attack follows a regular pattern’ but that the policy does not have to be formalised [Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/05-01/08-424, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 81; see also Prosecutor v Katanga and Ngudjolo, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/07-717, Decision on the confirmation of charges, 30 September 2008, para. 396]. A number of Pre-Trial Chambers also pointed to two extremes, which does little to clarify the limits of the term ‘policy’: ‘an attack which is planned, directed or organized – as opposed to spontaneous or isolated acts of violence – will satisfy this criterion’ [Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/05-01/08-424, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 81; Prosecutor v Katanga and Ngudjolo, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/07-717, Decision on the Confirmation of Charges, 30 September 2008, para. 396; Gbagbo, ICC PT. Ch. I, Decision on the Confirmation of Charges against Laurent Gbagbo, ICC-02/11-01/11-656-Red, 12 June 2014, para. 215].\n\nArticle 7(2)(a) clarifies that it needs to be a State or organizational policy. One Pre-Trial Chamber declared that the term ‘State’ was self-explanatory but added that the policy did not have to be conceived ‘at the highest level of the State machinery’ [Situation in the Republic of Kenya, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/09-19, Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorization of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of Kenya, 31 March 2010, para. 89, citing Prosecutor v Blaškić, ICTY T. Ch., Judgment, 3 March 2000, para. 205]. Therefore, also a policy adopted by regional or local organs of the State could satisfy this requirement [Ibid.].\n\nWith regard to ‘organizational’, the Pre-Trial Chambers in the Prosecutor v. Bemba and the Prosecutor v. Katanga and Ngudjolo stated that te organization may be ‘groups of persons who govern a specific territory or […] any organization with the capability to commit a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population’ [Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/05-01/08-424, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 81; Prosecutor v Katanga and Ngudjolo, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/07-717, Decision on the confirmation of charges, 30 September 2008, para. 396]. It is therefore not limited to State-like organizations [Situation in the Republic of Kenya, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/09-19, Decision Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorization of an Investigation into the Situation in the Republic of Kenya, 31 March 2010, paras 90-92; Prosecutor v Muthaura et al., ICC PT.

The Trial Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Katanga followed this approach [Prosecutor v Katanga, ICC T. Ch. II, ICC-01/04-01/07-3436, Jugement rendu en application de l’Article 74 du Statut, 7 March 2014, paras 1117-1122].\n\nThe Bemba Pre-Trial Chamber stated that when determining whether the ‘part of’ requirement was met it would consider ‘the characteristics, the aims, the nature or consequences of the act’ [Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/05-01/08-424, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 84]. It also stated ‘the underlying offences must […] not be isolated’ [Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, ICC-01/05-01/08-424, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 83], although that ought to follow already from the fact they have to be part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population.\n\nAuthor: Jonas Nilsson (The views expressed are those of the author alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of the United Nations or the ICTY.)\n\nUpdated: 30 June 2016\n\nArticle 7(1) - mental element\n\n[45] with knowledge of the attack:\n\nArticle 7(1) sets out the mental element as ‘knowledge of the attack’. The Elements of Crimes clarify that this requirement:\n\n‘should not be interpreted as requiring proof that the perpetrator had knowledge of all characteristics of the attack or the precise details of the plan or policy of the State or organization.’\n\nAs stated above, the Elements of Crimes state that the perpetrator must have known ‘that the conduct was part of or intended the conduct to be part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population’. The intent clause is meant to address the situation of ‘an emerging widespread or systematic attack’, that is a situation when the attack has not yet happened and knowledge of it therefore is impossible [Elements of Crimes, p. 5; see also Robinson, 2001, p. 73].\n\nCross-references:\n\n1.

It was included in Article 7 of the Rome Statute without real controversy [von Hebel and Robinson, p. 98; Hall, 2008, p. 184]. It was also deemed not to require a clarification of the intended meaning in Article 7(2) [McCormack, 2004, p. 189]. Murder as a crime against humanity has been dealt with in one of the judgements before the ICC [Katanga, ICC T. Ch. II, ICC-01/04-01/07-3436, Jugement rendu en application de l’Article 74 du Statut, 7 March 2014, paras 765-782].\n\nAnalysis\n\ni. Definition\n\nMurder as a crime against humanity within the meaning of Article 7(1)(a) is not defined in the Statute. According to the Elements of Crimes, one element of murder is that the perpetrator killed, or caused the death of, one or more persons. Neither Article 7 nor the Elements of Crimes give any clue as to how the mens rea should be understood. Therefore Article 30 applies and the material elements must be committed with intent and knowledge. [Prosecutor v Katanga, ICC T. Ch. II, ICC-01/04-01/07-3436, Jugement rendu en application de l’Article 74 du Statut, 7 March 2014, para. 780].\n\nii. Requirements\n\na. Material elements\n\nAccording to the Pre-Trial Chamber in the case Prosecutor v. Bemba the material elements of murder are that the victim is dead and that the death “result from the act of murder” [Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 132]. The first element of the crime of murder is thus that the victim is dead. As for the second element, the Pre-Trial Chamber was unhelpful by simply stating that the crime of murder requires “the act of murder”. It cited a number of ICTR and ICTY trial judgements [Prosecutor v Akayesu, ICTR T. Ch., 2 September 1998, para. 589; Prosecutor Rutaganda, ICTR T. Ch., 6 December 1999, para. 80; Blaškić, ICTY T. Ch., 3 March 2000, paras 216-217; Prosecutor v Delalić et al., ICTY T. Ch., 16 November 1998, para. 424], which all sets out that the second element is that the death must have been caused by an act of the perpetrator, with the ICTR judgements adding that the death could also be caused by an omission.\n\nThe reliance of the Pre-Trial Chamber on ICTY and ICTR trial judgments in this respect is odd considering that the ICTY Appeals Chamber has set out the elements of murder as a crime against humanity. In the case Prosecutor v. Mirolsav Kvočka et al., the Appeals Chamber set out that the first two elements are that the victim is dead and that the death was the result of an act or omission of the perpetrator [Prosecutor Kvočka et al., ICTY A. Ch., 28 February 2005, para. 261].\n\nThe Bemba Pre-Trial Chamber went on to clarify that the act may be committed by action or omission [Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 132]. In this respect, the Pre-Trial Chamber did not refer to ICTY or ICTR case law but to a decision by the Pre-Trial Chamber in the case Prosecutor v. Katanga and Ngudjolo, discussing the crime of wilful killing as war crime [Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 132, citing Katanga and Ngudjolo, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/07-717, Decision on the confirmation of charges, 30 September 2008, para. 287].\n\nb. Mental elements\n\nAccording to the Pre-Trial Chamber in the case Prosecutor v. Katanga and Ngudjolo, the mental element of the crimes against humanity of murder is that the perpetrator intended to kill one or more persons [Prosecutor v Katanga and Ngudjolo, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/07-717, Decision on the confirmation of charges, 30 September 2008, para. 423]. It specified that this encompasses “first and foremost, cases of dolus directus of the first and second degree” [Ibid.]. The Pre-Trial Chamber in Prosecutor v. Bemba, in its discussion of the mental element, do not use the words “first and foremost” and therefore limits the element to dolus directus in the first and second degree [Prosecutor v Bemba, ICC PT. Ch. II, Decision Pursuant to Article 61(7)(a) and (b) of the Rome Statute on the Charges of the Prosecutor Against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 15 June 2009, para. 135]. The Pre-Trial Chamber elaborated further on these concepts. It set out that Article 30(2) and (3) embraces two degrees of dolus, namely dolus directus in the first degree, or direct intent, and dolus directus in the second degree, also known as oblique intention. However, the provision does not cover dolus eventualis, also referred to as subjective or advertent recklessness [Ibid., paras 352-369]. The author refers to the commentary of Article 30 for further discussion on this.\n\nCross-references:\n\n1. Article 8(2)(a)(i) and 8(2)(c)(i)\n\n2. Elements of Crime\n\n3. Elements Digest\n\n4.

It has been listed in all instruments concerning crimes against humanity since the Second World War [Hall, 2008, p.190].\n\nAnalysis\n\ni. Definition\n\nThe crime against humanity of extermination is listed in Article 7(1)(b) of the Rome Statute. While Article 7(1)(b) does not elaborate on the definition of extermination, Article 7(2)(b) clarifies that it includes the inteal infliction of conditions of life, inter alia the deprivation of access to food and medicine, calculated to bring about the destruction of part of a population. The Elements of Crimes provide further:\n\n1. The perpetrator killed one or more persons, including by inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of part of a population.\n\n2. The conduct constituted, or took place as part of,10 a mass killing of members of a civilian population.\n\n3. The conduct was committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population.\n\n4. The perpetrator knew that the conduct was part of or intended the conduct to be part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population.\n\n5. The conduct could be committed by different methods of killing, either directly or indirectly.\n\n6. The infliction of such conditions could include the deprivation of access to food and medicine.\n\n7. The term “as part of” would include the initial conduct in a mass killing.\n\nii. Distinction between extermination and murder (both as crimes against humanity) and genocide\n\nThe only element that distinguishes murder as a crime against humanity from extermination as a crime against humanity is the requirement for extermination that the killings occur on a mass scale [Prosecutor v Ntakirutimana and Ntakirutimana, ICTR A. Ch., 13 December 2004, para. 542]. Murder as a crime against humanity does not contain a materially distinct element from extermination as a crime against humanity; each involves killing within the context of a widespread or systematic attack against the civilian population. Consequently, a conviction for murder as a crime against humanity and a conviction for extermination as a crime against humanity, based on the same set of facts, are impermissibly cumulative [Prosecutor v Ntakirutimana and Ntakirutimana, ICTR A. Ch., 13 December 2004, para. 542; Prosecutor v Lukić and Lukić, ICTY T. Ch. III, 20 June 2009, para. 1045]. While extermination differs from murder because extermination concerns a large number of victims, extermination differs from genocide because extermination covers situations in which a group of individuals who do not share any common characteristics are killed (whereas genocide requires a demonstration of the specific intent to destroy a defined group sharing common characteristics) [Hall, 2008, p.190].\n\niii. Requirements\n\nIn addition to the contextual elements required for all crimes against humanity set out in elements 3 and 4 of the above-listed Elements of Crimes, the following needs to be proven:\n\na. Material elements\n\nElements 1 and 2 of the above-listed Elements of Crimes constitute the material elements of extermination.\n\n1. The perpetrator killed one or more persons, including by inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of part of a population. The Elements of Crimes indicate that the killing may be carried out either directly or indirectly, which would include the infliction of conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of part of a population as set out above. The only ICC decision to date to address the crime of extermination in any detail is the first arrest warrant decision in the Al Bashir case [Prosecutor v Al Bashir, ICC PT. Ch. I, Decision on the Prosecution's Application for a Warrant of Arrest against Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, ICC-02/05-01/09-3, 4 March 2009]. Pre-Trial Chamber I found that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the crime of extermination was committed through acts such as the killing of over a thousand civilians in connection with an attack on a town [Prosecutor v Al Bashir, ICC PT. Ch. I, Decision on the Prosecution's Application for a Warrant of Arrest against Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, ICC-02/05-01/09-3, 4 March 2009, para. 97]. The Prosecution also alleged that the systematic destruction of the means of survival of civilian populations in Darfur constituted a form of extermination. However, Pre-Trial Chamber I did not explicitly refer to this means of carrying out extermination when finding reasonable grounds to believe that the crime of extermination was committed [Prosecutor v Al Bashir, ICC PT. Ch. I, Decision on the Prosecution's Application for a Warrant of Arrest against Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, ICC-02/05-01/09-3, 4 March 2009, para. 91, 95-97].\n\nIn the second arrest warrant decision in the Al Bashir case, Pre-Trial Chamber I noted in passing that extermination can be committed through the “infliction of certain conditions of life upon one or more persons” where those conditions are “calculated to bring about the physical destruction of that group, in whole or in part” [Prosecutor v Al Bashir, ICC PT. Ch. I, Second Decision on the Prosecution’s Application for a Warrant of Arrest for Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, ICC-02/05-01/09-94, 12 July 2010, para. 33]. Pre-Trial Chamber I concluded (in relation to the genocide charge) that that “one of the reasonable conclusions that can be drawn is that the acts of contamination of water pumps and forcible transfer coupled by resettlement by member of other tribes, were committed in furtherance of the genocidal policy, and that the conditions of life inflicted on the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa groups were calculated to bring about the physical destruction of a part of those ethnic groups”. [Prosecutor v Al Bashir, ICC PT. Ch. I, Second Decision on the Prosecution’s Application for a Warrant of Arrest for Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, ICC-02/05-01/09-94, 12 July 2010, para. 38]. It has been recognised at the ICTY and ICTR that the material elements of extermination includes “subjecting a widespread number of people or systematically subjecting a number of people to conditions of living that would inevitably lead to death” [Prosecutor v Stakić, ICTY A. Ch., 22 March 2006, para.259]; Prosecutor v Ntakirutimana and Ntakirutimana, ICTR A. Ch., 13 December 2004, para. 522].\n\n2. The conduct constituted, or took place as part of, a mass killing of members of a civilian population.\n\nIn the first arrest warrant decision in the Al Bashir case, Pre-Trial Chamber I repeated that the killings had to occur as part of a mass killing of a civilian population and noted that this mirrors the jurisprudence of the ICTY and ICTR on extermination [Prosecutor v Al Bashir, ICC PT. Ch. I, Decision on the Prosecution's Application for a Warrant of Arrest against Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, ICC-02/05-01/09-3, ICC-02/05-01/09-3, 4 March 2009], para. 96). The Elements of Crimes clarify that the term “as part of” would include the initial conduct in a mass killing. Thus already the first killings in a mass killing meet this requirement even though the requirement of a massive killing may not be satisfied until subsequent killings are perpetrated [Schabas, 2010, p.159].\n\nAt the ICTY and ICTR, the jurisprudence concerning the material elements of extermination has focused on the massiveness requirement, which “distinguishes the crime of extermination from the crime of murder”. [Prosecutor v Lukić and Lukić, ICTY A. Ch., 4 December 2012, para 536; Prosecutor v Ntakirutimana and Ntakirutimana, ICTR A. Ch., 13 December 2004, para. 542]. It is well established that the massiveness requirement does not suggest a strict numerical approach with a minimum number of victims [Prosecutor v Lukić and Lukić, ICTY A. Ch., 4 December 2012, para. 537]. While extermination as a crime against humanity has been found in relation to the killing of thousands of victims, it has also been found in relation to fewer killings, including incidents of around 60 victims and less at the ICTY, ICTR, and SCSL [see Prosecutor v Lukić and Lukić, ICTY A. Ch., 4 December 2012, para. 537]. The assessment of the massiveness requirement is made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the circumstances in which the killings occurred. Relevant factors include, inter alia: the time and place of the killings; the selection of the victims and the manner in which they were targeted; and whether the killings were aimed at the collective group rather than victims in their individual capacity [Prosecutor v Lukić and Lukić, ICTY A. Ch., 4 December 2012, para. 538]. Where mass killings are committed on an extremely large scale, far surpassing the threshold for extermination, this can be taken into account as an aggravating factor in sentencing [Prosecutor v Ndindabahizi, ICTR A. Ch., 16 January 2007.para. 135].\n\nIt has been recognised that several killing incidents can be accumulated together to constitute extermination [Prosecutor v Popović et al., ICTY T. Ch. II, 10 June 2010, para. 805 (holding that “in light of the temporal and geographical proximity of the killings, the similarities between them and the organized and coordinated manner in which the Bosnian Serb Forces conducted them, […] they formed part of a single operation.)”; Prosecutor v Tolimir, ICTY A. Ch., 8 April 2015, para. 147)]. Killings that are not part of the same attack on a civilian population, and instead are isolated acts, should not be accumulated together [Prosecutor v Tolimir, ICTY A. Ch., 8 April 2015, para. 150].\n\na. Mental elements\n\nIn the absence of a specific provision defining the mental requirements for extermination, Article 30 of the Rome Statute applies. Accordingly, the material elements must be committed with intent and knowledge, as defined in Article 30.\n\nAt the ICTY and ICTR it has been held that the mental elements of extermination require the intention to kill on a large scale or to systematically subject a large number of people to conditions of living that would lead to their deaths and that this intent reflects the material elements of the crime. The Appeals Chambers of the ICTY and the ICTR have noted that there is no support in customary international law for the requirement of intent to kill a certain threshold number of victims. This is consistent with the fact that there is no numerical threshold established with respect to the material elements of extermination. [Prosecutor v Stakić, ICTY A. Ch., 22 March 2006, para. 260; Prosecutor v Ntakirutimana and Ntakirutimana, ICTR A. Ch., 13 December 2004, paras. 516, 522]. As noted above, in the Al Bashir case, Pre-Trial Chamber I noted in passing that where extermination is committed through the “infliction of certain conditions of life upon one or more persons”, it is necessary to show that those conditions were “calculated to bring about the physical destruction of that group, in whole or in part”. [Prosecutor v Al Bashir, ICC PT. Ch. I, Second Decision on the Prosecution’s Application for a Warrant of Arrest for Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, ICC-02/05-01/09-94, 12 July 2010, para. 33].\n\nCross-references:\n\n1.

There was a general agreement throughout the drafting process that enslavement should be included in Article 7 of the Rome Statute, although there was discussion about to the exact meaning of the term [Hall, 2008, p. 192]. None of the judgments before the ICC have addressed the elements of this crime.\n\nAnalysis\n\ni. Definition\n\nAccording to one author, the crime of enslavement encompasses three components: slavery, servitude, and forced or compulsory labour [Hall, 2008, p. 193]. However, Article 7(2)(b) specifies that “Enslavement” means “the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership over a person”. This reflects the definition of “slavery”, as set out in the Slavery Convention of 1926 [Slavery Convention, Article 1(1)]. This would imply that “enslavement” for the purpose of the Rome Statute is limited to slavery in the traditional sense.\n\nThat said, the Elements of Crimes provides further specification by the words: “such as by purchasing, selling, lending or bartering […] a person or persons or by imposing on them a similar deprivation of liberty”. It adds that “[i]t is understood that such deprivation of liberty may, in some circumstances, include exacting forced labour or otherwise reducing a person to a servile status as defined in the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery of 1956”. Article 7(2)(b) adds that the definition “includes the exercise of [any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership over a person] in the course of trafficking in persons, in particular women and children”, which is also repeated in the Elements of Crimes [Elements of Crimes, p. 6, footnote 11]. The texts in Article 7(2)(b) and the Elements of Crimes appear to broaden the definition of “enslavement” beyond the traditional notion of slavery.\n\nNeither Article 7 nor the Elements of Crimes give any guidance as to how the mens rea should be understood. Therefore Article 30 applies and the material elements must be committed with intent and knowledge.\n\nii. Requirements\n\na. Material elements\n\nAs explained above, the main area of contention is whether “enslavement” includes something additional to the concept of slavery in the traditional sense. One author comments on the relevant provisions in the Rome Statute and the Elements of Crimes: “The enslavement provision is somewhat convoluted and inelegant, involving a broad general test, a restrictive-sounding list, and an expansive footnote. This reflects the contradictory pressures of the intense negotiations on these issues” [Robinson, 2001, p. 86]. As of now, there is no ICC case law addressing this matter.\n\nIn the case Prosecutor v. Dragoljub Kunarac et al., the Trial Chamber defined enslavement as “the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership over a person” and that the actus reus of the crime therefore was “the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership over a person” [Prosecutor v Kunarac et al., ICTY T. Ch., 22 February 2001, paras 539-540]. Having reviewed international instruments and case law, the Trial Chamber added that the definition “may be broader that the traditional and sometimes apparently distinct definitions of either slavery, the slave trade and servitude or forced or compulsory labour found in the areas of international law” [Ibid., paras 518-538, 541]. The Appeals Chamber accepted the Trial Chamber’s “chief thesis […] that the traditional concept of slavery, as defined in the 1926 Slavery Convention and often referred to as ‘chattel slavery’ [footnote omitted], has evolved to encompass various contemporary forms of slavery which are also based on the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership” [Prosecutor v Kunarac et al., ICTY A. Ch., 12 June 2002, para. 117]. It added that “[i]n the case of these various contemporary forms of slavery, the victim is not subject to the exercise of the more extreme rights of ownership associated with ‘chattel slavery’, but in all cases, as a result of the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership, there is some destruction of the juridical personality; [footnote omitted] the destruction is greater in the case of ‘chattel slavery’ but the difference is one of degree” [Ibid.]. Thus, the ICTY Appeals Chamber found that not only enslavement but also slavery, as defined in the Slavery Convention of 1926, had a broader meaning than the traditional notion of slavery.\n\nThe Pre-Trial Chamber in the case Prosecutor v. Katanga and Ngudjolo hinted at a similar broad understanding of enslavement. When discussing “sexual slavery” (Article 7(1)(g)), it concluded that this crime may be regarded as a particular form of enslavement and therefore what is encompassed with “sexual slavery” must also be encompassed with “enslavement” [Katanga and Ngudjolo, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/07-717, Decision on the confirmation of charges, 30 September 2008, para. 430]. The Pre-Trial Chamber then lists a number of institutions and practices referred to the 1956 Supplementary Convention: “debt bondage, serfdom, forced marriage practices and forms of child labour [Ibid.]. It adds that, in its view, sexual slavery (and therefore, presumably enslavement) also encompasses “situations where women and girls are forced into ‘marriage’, domestic servitude or other forced labour involving sexual activity, including rape, by their captors. [Footnote omitted] Forms of sexual slavery can, for example, be ‘practices such as the detention of women in “rape camps” [footnote omitted] or “comfort stations”, forced temporary “marriages” to soldiers and other practices involving the treatment of women as chattel” [Katanga and Ngudjolo, ICC PT. Ch. I, ICC-01/04-01/07-717, Decision on the confirmation of charges, 30 September 2008, para. 431].\n\nb.
