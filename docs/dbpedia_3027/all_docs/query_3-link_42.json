        "text": "Offer represents a multiple of 13.4 times 2005 normalized EBITDA, an attractive valuation compared with recent trading of peer company stocks as well as VNU’s stock\n\nConsortium intends to keep VNU substantially together as an integrated company pursuing existing long-term strategy\n\nConsortium members are affiliated funds of AlpInvest Partners, The Blackstone Group, The Carlyle Group, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Thomas H. Lee Partners\n\nThe Supervisory and Executive Boards unanimously support and unanimously recommend the Intended Offer\n\nHaarlem, the Netherlands – VNU N.V. (ASE: VNU), a leading global information and media company, and Valcon Acquisition B.V. (the “Offeror”), a holding company newly incorporated in the Netherlands, announced today that they have agreed to a public offer for VNU that values the company’s equity at EUR 7.5 billion, or EUR 28.75 per common share.\n\nThe expectation that VNU would reach an agreement on the intended public offer for all of the company’s issued common shares and 7% preferred shares was realized after a meeting of the company’s Supervisory Board in Haarlem yesterday evening. Following the meeting, VNU and the Offeror entered into a merger protocol for the purchase of the company (the “Offer”). The Offeror is controlled by a private-equity group consisting of affiliated funds of AlpInvest Partners N.V., The Blackstone Group L.P., The Carlyle Group, Hellman & Friedman LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P.\n\nThe Supervisory and Executive Boards of VNU, after giving due consideration to the strategic, financial and social aspects of the proposed transaction, unanimously support the Offer and conclude that it is in the best interests of shareholders and all other stakeholders of VNU, and they unanimously recommend that shareholders accept the Offer.\n\n“Based on a long and careful analysis of various alternatives, including remaining a stand-alone company and breaking up the company, we concluded that this transaction best serves the interests of VNU’s shareholders, clients and employees,” said Aad Jacobs, chairman of VNU’s Supervisory Board. “The all-cash offer provides shareholders with an attractive price that fully reflects the independently assessed fair value of the company.”\n\nOffer Highlights\n\nThe Offer will be an all-cash offer for all of the issued and outstanding common shares and all of the issued and outstanding 7% preferred shares of VNU N.V. Based on the Offer price of EUR 28.75 per common share, the value of the offer for the common shares is approximately EUR 7.5 billion. Based on the Offer price of EUR 13.00 per 7% preferred share, the value of the offer for the 7% preferred shares is approximately EUR 2 million.\n\nThe Offer price of EUR 28.75 per common share represents:\n\nA multiple of 13.4 times 2005 normalized EBITDA (adjusted for IMS and IRI settlement costs and book gains), an attractive valuation compared to the recent trading of peer company stocks, as well as to the recent history of trading of VNU’s stock; and\n\nA 23% premium over the closing price on July 8, 2005, the last trading day prior to VNU’s announcement of its planned merger with IMS Health.\n\nThe aggregate value of the transaction is approximately EUR 8.6 billion, or $10.3 billion, including net indebtedness. VNU will not declare or pay any dividends on its common shares.\n\nLaunch of the Offer is subject to completion of preparations and customary conditions. The closing of the transaction is conditioned upon 95% of VNU shareholders in each class, common and preferred, tendering their shares, as well as regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Following the closing, VNU shares will no longer be listed on Eurolist by Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nRob van den Bergh, chief executive officer of VNU, said, “This transaction brings VNU new owners who support our long-term strategy of growth through expanded market coverage; expansion into developing markets; technology and service innovation; and development of integrated business solutions for our clients. It gives the company the added operational flexibility of private ownership. VNU will continue to focus on improving efficiency and integration across our businesses to ensure that we capture the substantial growth opportunities made possible by our business model and strategy.”\n\nPreviously, Van den Bergh had announced that he would step down as chief executive officer. This is now anticipated to happen upon the closing of the transaction.\n\nAlpInvest Partners N.V., The Blackstone Group L.P., The Carlyle Group, Hellman & Friedman LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. said in a statement: “We are investing in the future of a company with an unmatched portfolio of market-leading assets, a highly knowledgeable and dedicated employee base and a sound strategy for the future. We intend to capitalize on these strengths by keeping VNU substantially together as an integrated company and continue to pursue its longterm strategy of improving operational efficiency and investing in product development and innovation. VNU’s businesses bring together a unique combination of market intelligence, analysis, advice and service. We are confident that the company is well positioned to build further on these strengths.”\n\nEach of the six firms in the consortium has a strong track record of successful long-term investments in a wide variety of companies and industries.\n\nVNU has signed a Merger Protocol with the private-equity consortium. The company and the Offeror will make all requisite filings with appropriate competition authorities and the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). VNU also will have all requisite consultations with, among others, the Works Council and trade unions. VNU expects the public offer for its shares to commence in early to mid-April and to hold a shareholders meeting to discuss the offer sometime in mid- to late April. This meeting is expected to coincide with VNU´s annual shareholders meeting, currently scheduled for April 18, 2006. The company would expect the tender period to be completed in early to mid-May, with acceptance and settlement of all tenders by the end of May.\n\nAmong other things, the Offeror has given the company certain undertakings relating to the continuation of employee benefit programs for 12 months following completion of the tender.\n\nBackground of the Offer\n\nOn December 14, 2005, the company disclosed that it had received expressions of interest from various parties regarding a possible acquisition of the company. The company’s Supervisory Board and Executive Board began to evaluate this possibility as well as other alternatives for the company.\n\nThe company retained Credit Suisse and Evercore Partners as its financial advisors. The Supervisory Board and Executive Board engaged NM Rothschild & Sons to provide additional financial advice.\n\nOn January 16, 2006, the company announced that it had received a non-binding proposal to purchase the company for EUR 28.00 to 28.50 per common share from a privateequity consortium consisting of affiliated funds of AlpInvest Partners N.V., The Blackstone Group L.P., The Carlyle Group, Hellman & Friedman LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., Permira Advisors Ltd. and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. Permira later withdrew from the group. VNU said it would proceed with discussions with this private-equity consortium as VNU continued to weigh alternatives and fully and fairly evaluate what course of action will serve the best interests of the company’s stakeholders. During this period, a second private-equity consortium indicated that it was not prepared to further consider at that time a potential acquisition of VNU at a comparable valuation.\n\nOn February 7, 2006, the company announced that it would continue its talks with the private-equity group.\n\nThe Supervisory Board met again on February 28, 2006, to discuss the transaction and alternatives and review reports prepared by the financial advisors. On Tuesday, March 7, 2006, the Supervisory Board met and, after carefully considering all options available to the company, unanimously concluded that this transaction was in the best interests of VNU’s stakeholders. Credit Suisse and NM Rothschild & Sons both delivered opinions to the effect that, based upon and subject to the matters considered, assumptions used and qualifications set forth in these opinions, the consideration offered per ordinary share is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of ordinary shares.\n\nStand-alone Analysis\n\nOver the past six months, VNU has worked on a stand-alone operating plan that includes Project Forward, a three-year program that is targeting annualized cost savings of EUR 125 million incremental to the current operating plans of VNU’s business units. The Executive and Supervisory Boards considered the potential value creation as a standalone public company, and believe that the Offer is more attractive to shareholders, taking into account:\n\nBusiness Opportunities and Challenges: In addition to the operating and cost savings opportunities, VNU’s businesses face challenges such as price compression in its Marketing Information group, and rapid technological change affecting each of its business units.\n\nExecution Risk: Achieving the projections and cost savings is uncertain and may be more difficult to achieve as a public company.\n\nValuation: The Offer represents an attractive multiple on historical and projected cash flows, even assuming Project Forward and the company’s longterm operating plan are fully achieved.\n\nAfter taking into account the opportunities and risks as a stand-alone company, the Supervisory and Executive Boards came to the conclusion that the Offer by the privateequity consortium is in the best interests of shareholders, clients and employees.\n\nBreak-up Analysis\n\nBefore committing to the private-equity offer, the Supervisory and Executive Boards also thoroughly analyzed the risk-reward benefits of breaking up the company. The Boards determined that pursuing a break-up would not be as attractive to shareholders as a sale of VNU in a single transaction, particularly after taking into account the time value of money and substantial valuation and execution risks, including:\n\nUncertain completion: No other offers currently exist for the businesses, and there would be both timing and achievability risks to obtain such offers at reasonable valuations.\n\nLoss of economies of scale: A substantial portion of the Project Forward cost savings opportunities available to VNU may not be obtainable if the company were split apart. In addition, any business units that become standalone companies would incur incremental expenses, including those associated with being a public company.\n\nAdverse tax effects: There would be adverse tax effects on a sale or potential spin-off of VNU’s businesses. Additionally, the company enjoys certain tax advantages as a Dutch company that would not be available to spin-off companies based in the U.S.\n\nNegative client reaction: VNU has been working with major clients to create unique combinations of its marketing, media and consumer information. Clients understand the advantages VNU brings to creating integrated services and they prefer that the company remain together.\n\nDistraction cost: A break-up of the company could take an extended period of time to complete, disrupting management and employees and potentially damaging client relationships.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Supervisory and Executive Boards came to the conclusion that breaking up the company would not be in the best interests of VNU´s shareholders, clients and its employees.\n\nFinancial advisory services have been provided to the Offeror by JPMorgan and ABN AMRO Bank, along with Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and ING. Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan, along with ABN AMRO Bank and ING, will provide financing for the transaction.\n\nSimpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek N.V. provided legal counsel to VNU. Clifford Chance LLP and Latham & Watkins LLP acted as legal advisors to the private-equity consortium.\n\nThis announcement is a public announcement as referred to in section 9b, par. 2(a), of the Dutch Securities Trading Supervision Decree (Besluit Toezicht Effectenverkeer 1995).\n\nForward-looking Statements\n\nThis document contains forward-looking statements.
