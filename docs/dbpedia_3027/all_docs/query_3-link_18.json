        "text": "As we at East Carolina University prepare for our latest civil discourse program Cupola Conversations, Israel - Palestine: Building Bridges, I want to take a moment to celebrate our students. Student leaders in ECU Hillel and the Muslim Student Association have advocated for their communities and acknowledged the civilian deaths on both sides of the conflict. What most impresses me, as well as gives me hope, is these leaders immediate interest in meeting and talking to one another. These efforts, that I have helped facilitate, has led to our campus conversation this Wednesday. Colleges and Universities continue to be criticized for their actions or inactions around local and national issues and incidents but I want suggest that perhaps we are looking in the wrong places. As the campus Deputy Free Speech Officer, as well as a nine year champion of creating civil discourse programming and spaces, I believe we should all be looking at how institutions, such as East Carolina, are working to promote civil discourse among those we are charged with educating - students. I am so proud of the many faculty and staff within the academy that model and educate institutional values as well as promote and articulate the concepts of civil discourse. Over my almost 30 years in higher education there is one absolute - students consistently amaze me. Their ability to move forward, imagine the future, and do great things, many times despite their surroundings, is the real story! On Nov. 1st, East Carolina University students, faculty, staff, and community will come together led by the efforts of both ECU Hillel and the Muslim Student Association. They will not debate or argue but instead will participate in a conversation that explores the emotional toll, the differences, and the struggle that our students experience in relation to this conflict. It will be a difficult but needed discussion that will illustrate the importance and the power of civil discourse.\n\nCongratulations to 18 boys from the Class of 2025 who were inducted into Christ School’s chapter of the National Honor Society on Thursday. Each of these Greenies has displayed outstanding achievement in Scholarship, Leadership, Character, and Service, qualities that are woven into our school culture. They are Brody Ballard ‘25, John Barton ‘25, Pete Boatwright ‘25, Jake Brown ‘25, Henry Chapman ‘25, Grey Edens ‘25, William Hughes ‘25, John Jaber ‘25, Jake Landis ‘25, Collier Lilly ‘25, Judson Meyers ‘25, Xander Ring ‘25, Luka Rose ‘25, Dawson Thompson ‘25, Spencer Vande Weghe ‘25, Jack West '25, Zach Wetzel ‘25, and Yixuan Wu ’25. After introducing each boy in chapel, Dean of Academics Emily Pulsifer P’15, P’17 posthumously recognized a 19th junior. RJ Fox ’25 had applied for the NHS and been unanimously recommended for induction. At Christ School, the selection process for the NHS begins with student applications and faculty consider several key elements in awarding the distinction of membership. According to faculty advisor Dr. Brent Harris, these elements are considered as a cumulative record for students who are rising seniors, and it is understood that students who are selected go above and beyond in these three areas of commitment: 1. Scholastic achievement: Measured as a 3.9 weighted grade-point average for three consecutive semesters with A/B grades. 2. Honorable character: Measured by judiciary and honor history. 3. Dedication to the service of others: Measured in annual service of at least 20 hours.\n\nForming our future. Educating for life. The K-12 education sector is facing a teacher shortage. This shortage will only become more acute over the next decade. Catholic schools of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis are served by over 2,300 women and men who have generously responded to a call in their lives to teach. A diocese is in a natural position to answer for itself: What are the qualities, characteristics, experiences, and preparation necessary to become a good Catholic school teacher? In the face of adverse recruitment conditions and secular preparation programs that are increasingly insufficient for the needs of Catholic schools, we are pivoting in favor of new ways to help candidates discern and prepare for service in a Catholic school classroom of the Archdiocese. Partnerships between dioceses and Catholic universities are core to the renewal of Catholic education. We are grateful for our partnership with the Center for Catholic Studies at the University of Saint Thomas. Candidates in the Mission and Culture Fellowship Program benefit from two worlds becoming one: mentored practical teaching experience in a Catholic school classroom paired with the opportunity to deepen their own formation through a meaningful course of study rooted in the Church’s 2,000-year-old tradition. We have, after all, been in this business for a very long time. We are going to need more creative opportunities like the Mission and Culture Fellowship Program to address expanding demand for well qualified Catholic school teacher candidates.

But have you considered the unique value of Christian higher education? Let me share with you why it's a choice that can truly transform your life: 1. Holistic Development: Christian higher education institutions emphasize the development of the whole person—mind, body, and spirit. It's not just about acquiring knowledge but also about cultivating values, ethics, and a sense of purpose that will guide you throughout your life. 2. Faith Integration: One of the standout features of Christian higher education is the integration of faith into the learning process. It provides a safe and nurturing environment where students can explore their faith, ask meaningful questions, and deepen their spiritual understanding and relationship with Jesus. 3. Service-Oriented Ethos: Christian colleges and universities often prioritize service to others. They encourage students to use their education for the greater good, fostering a sense of social responsibility and a commitment to making the world a better place. 4. Supportive Community: The sense of community in Christian higher education is unparalleled. You'll find professors and peers who genuinely care about your well-being and growth. This supportive network can be a tremendous asset as you navigate the challenges of academia and life. 5. Purpose-Driven Careers: Christian higher education equips graduates with a strong moral compass, making them well-suited for careers that require integrity, compassion, and a commitment to ethical decision-making. So, if you're considering higher education and seek not only knowledge but also personal growth, spiritual enrichment, and a community of like-minded individuals, I encourage you to explore the world of Christian higher education. It's a path that can lead to a life of purpose and impact."
