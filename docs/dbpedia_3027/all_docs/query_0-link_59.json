Non-web traffic may present a different risk or no risk at all. Scamalytics see low levels of traffic from Casema B.V. across our global network, little of which we suspect to be potentially fraudulent. We have no visibility into the web traffic directly from 83.85.169.30, and therefore apply a risk score of 0/100 based on the overall risk from Casema B.V.â€™s IP addresses where we do have visibility.\n\nOperator Hostname 83-85-169-30.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl ASN 33915 ISP Name ZIGGO-CM Organization Name Casema B.V.
