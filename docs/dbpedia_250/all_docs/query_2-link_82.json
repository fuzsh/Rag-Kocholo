All known languages make use of names—most com­ monly, but not exclusively, to identify individual people and places. The study of names, known as onomastics, is central to the work of scholars in various disciplines. It is also of enduring interest to the wider public, many of whom participate enthusiastically in soci­ eties formed to investigate names of different kinds. Indeed, name studies is an area where it is often essential for academics and non-academics to work closely together, with local knowledge making an important contribution to scholarly research. This vol­ ume aims to provide an up-to-date account of the state of the art in different areas of name studies, in a format that is both useful to specialists in related fields and accessible to the general reader. The main focus is on general principles and methodologies, with case studies from a range of languages and cultures. The editors are grateful to the many leading scholars from different parts of the world who have agreed to contribute, and who have made this Handbook what it is. We are also grateful to our colleagues in the subject area of English Language at the University of Glasgow for their support, and to the editorial team at Ox­ ford University Press for their unfailing helpfulness, wise guidance, and good humour. They have been a pleasure to work with.

Part I discusses the role of names in language, a key focus of investigation since Ancient Greece. Part II deals with place-names, with an opening chapter on method­ ology followed by chapters on different types of referents. Part III deals with personal names, with an overview of naming systems in different parts of the world followed by chapters on individual components of those systems. Part IV discusses the study of names in literature, with case studies from different languages and time periods. Part V intro­ duces the field of socio-onomastics, with chapters relating to the names of people, places, and commercial products. Part VI outlines inter-disciplinary aspects of name studies. Fi­ nally, Part VII explores the naming strategies adopted for a selection of animate and inan­ imate referents. Keywords: name studies, place-names, personal names, names in literature, socio-onomastics\n\n1.1 Introduction THE study of names, known as ‘onomastics’, is both an old and a young discipline. Since Ancient Greece, names have been regarded as central to the study of language, throwing light on how humans communicate with each other and organize their world. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and others were keenly interested in the relationship between names and referents, and this has continued to be a major theme of both philosophical and linguistic enquiry throughout the history of Western thought. The investigation of name origins, on the other hand, is more recent, not developing until the twentieth century in some areas, and being still today at a formative stage in others. Here the emphasis is on etymology, systematically tracing the derivation of individual names back through time, and the re­ sulting data have provided a rich evidence base for the investigation of historical and lin­ guistic topics. Relatively new is the study of names in society, which draws on techniques from sociolinguistics and has gradually been gathering momentum over the last few decades. Page 1 of 13\n\nIntroduction Whereas these approaches encompass names of all kinds, others prioritize particular types of names, such as place-names or personal names. A wide range of inter-discipli­ nary research bearing on archaeology, geography, and landscape studies focuses largely on the names of places, while research bearing on anthropology and genealogy focuses largely on the names of people. Fictional as well as real names repay attention, most obvi­ ously in the study of names in literature, but also in relation to areas such as commerce, law, psychology, and religion. Named entities are not limited to people and places, but ex­ tend to other living creatures, man-made objects, and celestial bodies, all reflecting dif­ ferent aspects of the interaction between humans and their surroundings. Much research in the field begins at the level of the individual name, but only reaches full significance when the results are grouped together, allowing patterns to emerge. Com­ parative analysis of large datasets has been facilitated enormously by advances in (p. 2) technology, as some of the contributions to this volume explain. Also important is the sharing of knowledge through national and international collaboration. Many name schol­ ars are closely involved in subject societies, whether focusing on names of a particular type or within a particular geographical area, and the over-arching organization, the In­ ternational Congress of Onomastic Sciences, brings together research into names of all types throughout the world at its triennial conferences. The structure of this volume reflects the emergence of the main branches of name stud­ ies, in roughly chronological order. First, a section on name theory outlines key issues about the role of names in language. Some of these will be revisited in later chapters, of­ ten from different viewpoints. Many aspects of the subject are controversial, and the vol­ ume does not aim to present a party line, but rather to reflect the rich diversity of schol­ arship. Part II deals with toponomastics, the study of place-names, with an opening chap­ ter on methodology followed by chapters on different types of referents. Part III turns to anthroponomastics, the study of personal names, beginning with an overview of naming systems in different parts of the world, followed by chapters on the individual compo­ nents of those systems. Part IV outlines contrasting approaches to the study of names in literature, otherwise known as literary onomastics, with case studies from different lan­ guages and time periods. Part V introduces a range of recent scholarship within the field of socio-onomastics, with chapters relating to the names of people, places, and commer­ cial products. Part VI focuses on the inter-disciplinarity of name studies, outlining some of the ways in which other disciplines both draw on, and contribute to, this field of research. Finally, Part VII presents a selection of animate and inanimate referents, and explores the naming strategies adopted for them. Strikingly, each has distinctive naming patterns, some esoteric, some idiosyncratic, and some developed with great ingenuity according to a complex system.\n\n1.2 Onomastic Theory What are names, and how do they function in language? As Coates (2006e: 7) explains, name theory is ‘arguably the most ancient topic area in the whole of linguistics since it Page 2 of 13\n\nIntroduction was first problematized by Plato in his Cratylus, and it is, notwithstanding its antiquity, one with foundational problems still to be resolved’. In the English-speaking world, names are traditionally regarded as a type of noun or noun phrase, sometimes referred to as ‘proper nouns’. Whether they are atypical or prototypical nouns has been hotly debated, and attempts have also been made to reclassify them as determinatives (Anderson 2003, 2004, 2007). This volume therefore begins with the crucial issue of the definition of names—a definition which, like other key questions addressed in subsequent chapters, must be universally applicable rather than language-specific. To this end, Willy Van Lan­ gendonck and Mark Van de Velde advocate a cognitive approach, focusing on (p. 3) the pragmatic-semantic properties of names as distinct from language-specific grammatical categories. Drawing on data from a range of European and African languages, they argue that names are definite nouns with unique denotation, an inherent basic level sense, no defining sense, and optional connotative meanings. In the following chapter, Staffan Nyström picks up on the issue of meaning, elaborating on the different types of meaning attributed to names by different scholars, and outlining the main arguments relating to this highly controversial area of name theory. Despite the influential view that absence of semantic meaning is a defining characteristic of a name, some theorists argue that names have certain types of semantic meaning, while many— perhaps all—accept that names have non-semantic meaning. This chapter too takes a cog­ nitive approach, focusing particularly on the interface between lexical and proprial mean­ ing, such that lexically transparent components of names may bring to mind their nonproprial meanings. Nyström also provides a cogent exposition of the range of potential presuppositional meanings, including categorical (basic level) meaning, associative (con­ notative) meaning, and emotive (affective) meaning. Like Van Langendonck and Van de Velde, who identify a ‘cline of nameworthiness’ from more to less typical types of names, he argues that ‘names and words should not be seen as completely isolated from each other but instead as two communicating and integrated parts of the total network, the mental lexicon’. Both chapters thus situate names within a language continuum, rather than proposing a cut-off point separating them from other linguistic items. The third and final chapter in this section shifts the perspective from the internal proper­ ties of names to their uses in spoken language. Elwys De Stefani introduces the concept of interactional onomastics, applying techniques from conversation analysis to the study of names in discourse. Again pragmatic analysis is key to the investigation, but whereas traditional approaches to onomastic theory have been dominated by issues relating to the denotative function of names, this chapter raises broader questions about their social and cultural significance. In so doing, de Stefani introduces a number of themes that will be revisited in later sections of the volume, particularly in connection with anthropology and socio-onomastics.\n\nPage 3 of 13\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.3 Toponomastics The study of place-names is known as ‘toponomastics’, the term recommended in the list of key onomastic terms produced by the International Congress of Onomastic Sciences (ICOS 2011). An alternative term ‘toponymy’ is preferred by some scholars but is ambigu­ ous, as it also refers to a corpus of place-names, otherwise known as ‘toponyms’. Much research in toponomastics is organized geographically, surveying the place-names of an area by compiling and analysing sequences of historical spellings in order to establish et­ ymological origins. The opening chapter of Part II offers an introduction to (p. 4) sources and methodologies, focusing on the recently-inaugurated Survey of Scottish Place-Names. Simon Taylor draws on his extensive experience of place-name research to discuss key is­ sues relating to the collection, organization, storage, analysis, and presentation of data, including evidence from both written and oral sources. Although Scotland is a small coun­ try, its toponymy draws on an unusually wide range of languages including both Celtic and Germanic strata, and hence the examples presented here have a much broader rele­ vance. The following chapters deal with the names of different types of geographical entities, in­ cluding both the natural and the built environment. The prototypical place-name is that of a human settlement such as a town, city, or village, and there are many parallels between those found in different parts of the world. Some parallels result from similar naming strategies being applied independently by unrelated groups of speakers; others result from names being transferred directly from one area to another. Carole Hough outlines the main structures of settlement names, grouped broadly into descriptive and non-de­ scriptive names. The former tend to predominate in Indo-European languages, whereas the latter, which include commemorative, transferred, and incident names, are character­ istic not only of some non-Indo-European languages but of the names created by Euro­ pean settlers in the African, American, and Australian continents during the Age of Explo­ ration. The second part of Hough’s chapter discusses some of the evidence preserved in both groups, particularly for settlement patterns, settlement chronologies and historical linguistics. Examples are mostly from the mainland of Britain, but again the underlying principles have a broader relevance. The most ancient toponyms are those of large geographical features. The names of major rivers are among the earliest evidence for language and population movement, with some dating back two millennia or more. Svante Strandberg analyses the linguistic and chrono­ logical strata reflected in different types of formations, as well as the implications of iden­ tical or related river names in areas of Britain and continental Europe. His chapter in­ cludes a discussion of some of the most common roots in European river names, along­ side semantic and morphological factors. A controversial area is the stratigraphy of ‘Old European’ hydronymy, a system of river naming dating back to a period before the emer­ gence of individual branches of Indo-European. This has been a major focus of scholar­ ship throughout the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, and the chapter traces the development of the debate. Page 4 of 13\n\nIntroduction Other large geographical features include hills and mountains, whose names are the sub­ ject of Peter Drummond’s chapter. These tend to be recorded later than the names of set­ tlements and of rivers, a factor attributed to their economic marginality. It is also more common for more than one name to be attached to a single feature, partly due to lack of communication between rural societies on different sides of a single mountain. Some­ thing similar accounts for the fact that the names of ranges tend to be later than those of individual hills, since the concept of a local hill being part of a larger group depends on a degree of mobility. Changes over time are also relatively common in hill (p. 5) names, as are uncertainties regarding the precise referent, which may comprise the whole massif, its main or subsidiary summit, a shoulder, or another prominent part. Alongside such is­ sues, Drummond gives an account of research into the defining elements or ‘generics’ of mountain names in Scotland, Ireland, Switzerland, and France, followed by a discussion of selected types of qualifying elements or ‘specifics’, focusing in particular on the appli­ cation of personal names to summits in the former European colonies, the USA, and Eu­ rope. The naming strategies of the European colonizers are also reflected in many island names, since islands are often among the first places to be settled and named by new groups of incomers. For the same reason, they provide unique evidence for language his­ tory and migration patterns. Peder Gammeltoft explores these and other issues, with par­ ticular attention to the mindsets of the namers. Case studies include island names of Scandinavian origin in the British Isles, and island names from Polynesian motu ‘island’ in the Pacific Ocean. Both illustrate the central role of island names in tracing the spread of people and their languages throughout the world. Julia Kuhn deals with a more disparate set of entities, linked by being ‘uninhabited, delim­ ited objects in rural settings and surroundings’. Her chapter on rural names covers the names of fields, meadows, forests, single trees, and so on, many of which are associated with the agricultural exploitation of land. Changes in farming practices are leading to the loss of such names, so there is a real urgency to the task of documenting and studying them. Their main purpose is orientation and the identification of areas within small and limited units, and they provide fine-grained evidence for local conditions and dialects. Kuhn offers a detailed analysis of semantic and morphological patterns, followed by an outline of methods of collection and interpretation. Many examples are from Romance and Germanic languages, and the chapter demonstrates the value and importance of this often neglected group of toponyms. Whereas rural names serve to organize uninhabited space, street names fulfil the corre­ sponding purpose in towns and cities. There are, however, marked contrasts, not least in that whereas rural names are gradually diminishing in use, street names represent the most productive area of the present-day toponymicon. Bertie Neethling begins by outlin­ ing the characteristic structures of street names, and moves on to examine their func­ tions, both referential and symbolic. His chapter focuses particularly on the renaming of streets, with case studies from South Africa. The high emotive value of commemorative\n\nPage 5 of 13\n\nIntroduction names is strikingly illustrated, reinforcing the key role of such formations in the naming environments treated in previous chapters. The final chapter in this section deals not with a type of referent but with a type of nam­ ing strategy, touched on in previous chapters but here brought centre-stage. Stefan Brink presents an in-depth treatment of place-name transfers, including different ways of adapting existing names, and the importance of analogy and patterning in name forma­ tion. Many examples are from Scandinavia; others from Polynesia and the European colonies.\n\n(p. 6)\n\n1.4 Anthroponomastics\n\nAlso referred to as ‘anthroponymy’, anthroponomastics encompasses the study of names given to individuals or to groups of people. As in toponomastics, etymological investiga­ tion is a major thrust of investigation, but there is in addition a greater emphasis on the historical development of naming patterns and on synchronic research into name choices. This section outlines the development and uses of different kinds of personal names, and concludes by discussing links with related areas of research. Unlike place-names, where there are different naming strategies for different referents, personal names all refer to the same type of referent—people—but the system itself com­ prises different types of names, including given names, family names, nicknames, and so on. The various components of the personal naming system are selected and combined in different ways in different cultures, and the opening chapter in this section presents a comparative analysis of fifteen languages across the world. Edwin D. Lawson assembles a range of specialists to outline the naming practices in their language of expertise, and then correlates the data in order to identify shared features. The results show that nam­ ing practices in the UK have the most overlap with others, followed respectively by those found in Greek, German, Dutch, the USA, French, Portuguese, Hungarian, Polish, Chi­ nese, Maltese, Jewish, Zulu, Māori, and the Bible. The following chapter by Katharina Leibring focuses on given names, otherwise known as first names. After defining and categorizing given names both morphologically and se­ mantically, she presents a diachronic survey of their evolution and selection in a wide range of European naming systems from pre-Christian times to the present day. Despite differences between countries and regions, a number of common features are identified, including a bias towards male, upper class names in the extant records. Changes in nam­ ing practices are linked to historical developments, and the survey concludes with a dis­ cussion of the current trend in many European countries for individualization in given names, through such strategies as unorthodox spellings and the creation of new, innova­ tory names. In many naming systems, one or more given names are followed by a surname, otherwise known as a family name since its function is to identify an individual as a member of a family. Patrick Hanks and Harry Parkin address the origins and typology of hereditary Page 6 of 13\n\nIntroduction surnames in different parts of the UK, drawing both on previous scholarship and on ex­ amples from the ongoing Family Names of Britain and Ireland research project at the Uni­ versity of the West of England. They also discuss the influence of migration on the world’s family-name stocks, such that, for instance, present-day surnames in the UK reflect ori­ gins in languages as diverse as Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Gaelic, Hebrew, Indian, Latin, Persian, Turkish, and Yiddish. The chapter goes on to present an account of schol­ arship in continental Europe, Asia, and the Indian subcontinent, and concludes by draw­ ing attention to the potential of large surname databases to underpin further research in the field. As Hanks and Parkin explain, an intermediate stage before the development of hereditary family names was the use of non-hereditary bynames. These, alongside nick­ names, are the focus of the next chapter by Eva Brylla. She begins by defining the terms, before turning to issues relating to function, syntax, semantics, and morphology. Cover­ age extends to the names both of individuals and of groups such as football clubs, and there is also a brief analysis of internet names, to which the next section will return. Simi­ larly, the concluding discussion of bynames as a mirror of society raises issues that will be (p. 7)\n\naddressed in further detail within Part V. The names of ethnic groups are known as ‘ethnonyms’, and Adrian Koopman discusses the relationship between the names themselves and a range of factors often linked to eth­ nicity, including race, nationality, geographical area, language, and religion. Case studies focus on Scottish and Zulu clan names, and the chapter addresses theoretical issues con­ cerning the linguistic status of ethnonyms. The remaining two chapters in this section deal with areas of research which both draw on and contribute to anthroponomastics. Ellen S. Bramwell outlines the role of names within anthropological frameworks, with examples from different parts of the world. Ex­ amining the close connection between names and the cultural contexts in which they ap­ pear, she argues that despite some existing cross-over between the two disciplines through, for instance, the use of ethnographic fieldwork methods, there is potential for much closer theoretical engagement. Finally, George Redmonds explores the key role of personal naming patterns in tracing ancestry. While the significance of surnames for ge­ nealogy has long been recognized, he argues that the importance of given names in this connection has been undervalued. His chapter presents a compelling analysis of patterns of distribution, showing how they can be used not only to reveal the origins of individual names, but also to trace migration, whether between countries or between counties. The complexities associated with the development of surname variants, abbreviations, and contractions are illustrated by a wealth of examples, and the chapter emphasizes the role of the genealogist as contributor to, as well as beneficiary from, name research.\n\nPage 7 of 13\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.5 Literary Onomastics Despite an exponential growth of publications on literary onomastics in recent decades, the development of methodologies for the study of names in literature is at a much earlier stage than for the study of either toponomastics or anthroponomastics. This section dis­ cusses the theoretical basis of literary onomastics and offers a survey of different kinds of approaches. The opening chapter by Grant W. Smith takes as its starting point the philosophical de­ bate concerning the meaning of names, and provides a magisterial survey of competing theories. Supporting the semiotic approach advocated by C. S. Peirce, he analyses literary uses of names in terms of iconic associations, indexical associations, and (p. 8) symbolic associations. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of systematic analy­ sis. In contrast to this broad theoretical approach, Bertie Neethling presents a comparative analysis of uses of names in two songs from the late twentieth century: Billy Joel’s We Didn’t Start The Fire and Christopher Torr’s Hot Gates. Both are remarkable for the sheer number of names included in the lyrics. Torr uses place-names exclusively, while Joel brings in a variety of place-names, personal names, brand names, and others. Particular significance is attached to connotative meanings, bringing out the ways in which they en­ rich the artistic experience. Some uses of names are genre-specific, so a number of literary onomastic studies ap­ proach names through groups of texts related by genre. Birgit Falck-Kjällquist outlines previous research in connection with a variety of genres, including nineteenth-century novels, twentieth-century detective fiction, sequels, comics, fantasy literature, drama, films, heroic poetry, medieval romance, and parodies. The main focus is on English and German literature. Advances in technology are transforming many branches of name studies, not least in this field. Karina van Dalen-Oskam outlines the development of literary onomastic scholarship from the qualitative analysis of selected names to the quantitative analysis of the entire ‘onymic landscape’, an approach facilitated by the availability of electronic databases. As yet, only relatively small text corpora are available for this kind of study, but the chapter demonstrates the immense potential of a computational approach. Paul Cavill’s chapter on language-based approaches to names in literature traces the his­ tory of literary onomastics from the earliest written traditions to the present day. It re­ lates literary names to contemporary naming practices, showing how and why they some­ times differ. There is a particular focus on Old and Middle English literature, Shake­ speare, and later modern novelists.\n\nPage 8 of 13\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.6 Socio-onomastics The emerging subdiscipline of socio-onomastics offers new approaches to names of all kinds, including both personal names and place-names. As Terhi Ainiala explains, this branch of onomastics examines names in society, focusing particularly on name variation. Names vary according to the social, cultural, and situational fields in which they are used, and socio-onomastics draws on techniques from sociolinguistics in order to trace and to analyse this phenomenon. Ainiala’s chapter offers a state-of-the-art account of the field, and concludes by presenting folk onomastics as a sub-category of socio-onomastics. The role of names is key to the construction of identity and to notions of selfhood, but has only recently begun to be critically examined. Emilia Aldrin gives an overview of theoreti­ cal and methodological tools, and outlines current trends and gaps within the field. Her chapter focuses mainly on contemporary names, primarily those of individuals. Turning from personal names to place-names, Guy Puzey introduces linguistic land­ scape research, an approach that has emerged in recent years to reflect issues relating to the language(s) used on public signs (e.g. roads, railway stations, shops) in areas occu­ (p. 9)\n\npied by different speech communities. These issues are crucial to the field of language planning. Puzey details major theoretical and methodological developments here and in the related fields of geosemiotics and semiotic landscapes. He then turns to the onomas­ tic potential, including opportunities to apply linguistic landscape fieldwork techniques to study observable onomastic practice, to facilitate the collection of names, and to study names in relation to language policy. Recent work on place attachment (comprising place identity and place dependence) has led to a new theory of ‘Toponymic attachment’, with particular relevance to areas of the world with both indigenous and immigrant populations. Toponymic attachment is defined as a positive or negative association made by individuals and groups with real or imag­ ined place-names. It was developed by Laura Kostanski, whose chapter makes compar­ isons between existing geographical-domain-based theories and potential new avenues for exploration, while also investigating and explaining the sub-domains of ‘Toponymic identity’ and ‘Toponymyic dependence’. Most examples are from the Grampians National Park in Australia. The names used to address a person may not be the names used to refer to him or her, and may indeed vary substantially in different situations and social environments. As much if not more than names themselves, forms of address reflect changing cultural val­ ues and attitudes both synchronically and diachronically. As Irma Taavitsainen and An­ dreas H. Jucker explain, address terms are used by speakers to appeal to their hearer(s) and to convey both interpersonal and expressive meanings, with a scale extending from endearment to deference and to terms of abuse. Their chapter outlines alternative seman­ tic classifications, and presents a diachronic overview of changes in both the frequency and the semantic types of address terms. The focus is on English, but there is also some consideration of developments in other languages. Page 9 of 13\n\nIntroduction Unlike personal names and nicknames, which are generally bestowed by other people, and also unlike surnames, which are inherited, pseudonyms are chosen by the individual, and hence offer specific insights into naming and self-presentation. Katarzyna Aleksiejuk introduces pseudonyms as a category of names, and describes practices of use from vari­ ous angles. She goes on to outline the historical development of scholarly approaches to anonymity and pseudonymity, and the functions of pseudonyms in different contexts, in­ cluding literature, entertainment, politics, religion, and selected non-European traditions. Her chapter also discusses the recent phenomenon of internet usernames, and puts for­ ward a proposed typology. Another area of naming that has come to prominence in recent years is commercial nomenclature, often but not always referring to businesses and products. Paula Sjöblom explores the increasing commercialization of the Western way of life and its impact on names. Her chapter casts light on the history of commercial naming and (p. 10) intro­ duces different approaches to linguistic analysis. There is a particular focus on the se­ mantics and functions of names, and Sjöblom explains how English, as the global lan­ guage of business, is pervasive in commercial names throughout the world.\n\n1.7 Onomastics and Other Disciplines Onomastics is essentially inter-disciplinary, and it might be difficult to identify any major subject area to which it is completely unrelated. The chapters in this section explore some of the most prominent connections between name studies and other fields of re­ search, but are by no means exhaustive. Their number could easily have been multiplied, and readers will no doubt be able to think of other topics that could have been included. First, Richard Jones discusses names and archaeology, explaining how place-names and field names can be used to locate sites of archaeological interest, while examination of material culture can contribute to the understanding of when and why places were named. The emergence of cognitive approaches has also led to place-names being used as evidence for the mental world of past communities. Cognitive approaches are also central to Serge Brédart’s chapter on names and cognitive psychology. He begins by summarizing empirical evidence demonstrating that personal names are both more difficult to retrieve than other biographical information about peo­ ple, and more difficult to retrieve than other words. Then he outlines competing hypothe­ ses that attempt to explain these difficulties, respectively on the grounds that personal names lack descriptiveness, that person naming requires the retrieval of one specific la­ bel, that the set size of plausible phonology is larger for personal names, and that the fre­ quency of personal name usage is relatively low. The conclusion is that a combination of factors makes personal names hard to recall. Maggie Scott’s chapter on names and dialectology explores the relationship between the study of language varieties and the study of names, taking account of historical develop­ ments in theory and methodology. The oral corpus of local names is usually more detailed Page 10 of 13\n\nIntroduction than that represented on maps, and such ‘unofficial’ names can provide a range of in­ sights into the sociolinguistic and pragmatic functions of non-standard, slang, and dialec­ tal terminology. Place-names also preserve important evidence for dialect geography, and Scott draws on Nicolaisen’s concept of the onomastic dialect to provide an explanatory framework for instances where onomastic isoglosses do not parallel their lexical counter­ parts. Peder Gammeltoft also focuses largely on place-names for his chapter on names and ge­ ography. A challenge in using place-names in this connection is to establish when a name was established and the significance of the naming focus. In addition, later onomastic de­ velopments may create a mismatch between the current denotation and the original place-name meaning. These and other issues are explored here, alongside a (p. 11) discus­ sion of the role of Geographical Information Systems and geospatial databases in both onomastic research and geography. Turning to names and history, Gillian Fellows-Jensen outlines the various linguistic layers of place-names in England in reverse chronological order. She moves from names of French origin to those from Norse, Anglo-Saxon, and Celtic languages, tracing the princi­ pal areas where each group is found, and also touching on river names of Old European origin. Richard Coates’s chapter on historical linguistics looks at names as evidence for the na­ ture and progress of linguistic change, and for prehistoric languages which have since disappeared. The relationship between names and other vocabulary items is also ad­ dressed, and the chapter concludes with a description and evaluation of the practice of the etymological study of names. As Berit Sandnes explains, place-names are easily borrowed in language contact situa­ tions, probably because sharing a place-name is the easiest way to point out a specific lo­ cation. Loan names are regularly adapted to the sound system of the recipient language, and adaptations occur sporadically on other linguistic levels, including grammar and syn­ tax. Elements may be translated or substituted by similar-sounding words in the new lan­ guage. Sandnes also draws attention to the key role of the speaker in contact onomastics, as processes such as translations, replacement of elements, and syntactic adaptations can only be explained as the result of a speaker’s interpretation and adaptation. Personal names feature prominently in Andreas Teutsch’s chapter on names and law, since they are closely connected with personal rights. Teutsch presents an overview of le­ gal regulations concerning personal names in different countries, but also attempts to de­ fine universal tendencies and to discuss the challenge of legal harmonization on an inter­ national level. Since law regulates social interaction, it can also be a decisive institution for conflicts relating to other types of names, including those of places, streets, undertak­ ings, and commercial products.\n\nPage 11 of 13\n\nIntroduction Alison Grant charts the increasing use of onomastic source material in English lexicogra­ phy, from its marginal consideration in the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary to the much more inclusive policy of the ongoing third edition. In Scotland, the situation is less well advanced, and name evidence is used unsystematically in the major dictionaries of Scots, a language for which reliable onomastic source material is also less readily available. However, toponymic and anthroponymic evidence can provide valuable antedatings and reinterpretations for existing dictionary entries, as well as providing new ad­ ditions to the lexicon. Kay Muhr discusses the interface between names and religion, focusing particularly on place-names in Ireland. Her chapter presents some place-name elements from Ireland il­ lustrating the sacredness of water, hills, and burial and assembly sites. She analyses problematic terms such as findabair, temair, the Otherworld dwelling síd, the pagan grave fert, and the human house tech, as well as ecclesiastical terminology borrowed from Latin: domnach, cell, dísert, aireagal, martar, and reilic.\n\n(p. 12)\n\n1.8 Other Names\n\nNames are given to many animate and inanimate referents, with distinctive patterns even for apparently similar referents such as boats and ships, locomotives and trains, or pets and farm animals. The shorter chapters in this section explore some of these patterns. Again, their number could have been expanded exponentially, but the aim is to provide a representative cross-section, illustrating a variety of naming strategies. Guy Puzey covers aircraft names, presenting an outline history of approaches to naming British military aircraft types. Civil aircraft naming practices are illustrated with the ex­ ample of the Boeing Company’s 700-series of airliners, and the chapter also discusses air­ craft naming in international development projects. Finally, examples are given of names and nicknames for individual machines. Two of the chapters in Part I drew attention to similarities between personal names and pet names, and Katharina Leibring now treats the names of domestic animals in fuller de­ tail both diachronically and synchronically. She focuses on the names of production ani­ mals and companion animals in European countries from the eighteenth century on­ wards, but also includes some coverage of African and Arctic animal names. Changes in the name stock for different species are related to changes in agriculture, and differences between the names of male and female animals are also addressed. Marc Alexander introduces the study of astronomical naming practices, showing how they relate to scientific and general culture. His chapter focuses on constellation names, star names, and planet names, and addresses both the historical background and the complex modern conventions. Adrian Koopman discusses the names of private dwellings, outlining the various semantic categories and levels of meaning. He focuses particularly on the functions and meanings Page 12 of 13\n\nIntroduction of Zulu homestead names, with an emphasis on their use to communicate messages aimed at relieving tension and conflict. The two remaining chapters deal with land and sea transport. Richard Coates describes the history of the names of steam locomotives, showing a progression from attributive to arbitrary names. He also more briefly considers the names of trains. Finally, Malcolm Jones discusses the names given to ships from the earliest records to the present day. Po­ litical and religious motivations for the giving and changing of names are illustrated from the English, French, and Russian Revolutions. Categories of name are illustrated from medieval and early modern English and Spanish fleets, and modern navies, merchant­ men, and cruise-lines.\n\n1.9 Conclusion As well as outlining the current state of name studies in its various branches, the chap­ ters in this volume show the discipline continuing to expand and to develop into new ar­ eas. (p. 13) To mention a few examples from different sections, de Stefani introduces the concept of interactional onomastics, Neethling argues for song lyrics as a legitimate area of investigation for literary onomastics, Sandnes introduces contact onomastics as a branch of contact linguistics, and some of the legal cases cited by Teutsch show changes still in progress through ongoing rulings with a binding effect. Research within name studies is vigorous, vibrant, and innovative, and if this volume had been produced twenty or even ten years ago, many of the chapters would have been radically different or even absent. We can be confident that a similar undertaking in another ten or twenty years would be as different again.\n\n(p. 14)\n\nCarole Hough\n\nCarole Hough is Professor of Onomastics at the University of Glasgow.

We argue that names are definite nouns with unique de­ notation that display an inherent basic level sense. The approach developed in this chap­ ter aims at being universally valid in two ways. First, the pragmatic-semantic concept of names is cross-linguistically applicable. It is distinct from language-specific grammatical categories of Proper Names, for which language-specific grammatical criteria should be adduced. Second, our approach takes into account all types of names. We point out a cline of nameworthiness that is grammatically relevant. Keywords: grammatical criteria, categorical meaning, typology, definiteness, pronouns, proprial lemma, grammar\n\n2.1 Introduction THE study of names and grammar involves establishing the grammar of proper names (henceforth: names) in one or more languages. First, we should have a workable idea of what is to be understood by names and by grammar, because ‘. . . finally onomastics is a branch of linguistics’ (Algeo 2010: 93). Thus, we first have to deal with a long-standing distinction. In recent decades, many scholars have adopted Ronald Langacker’s (1987) distinction between the ‘established linguistic convention’ (formerly langue or compe­ tence) and ‘language use’ (formerly parole or performance), which appear to form a rea­ sonable continuum. As a rule, grammar deals with the morphosyntactic peculiarities of a specific language. In this, we follow Haspelmath (2010: 663), who contends: ‘Descriptive formal categories cannot be equated across languages because the criteria for categoryassignment are different from language to language’. Thus, grammar is language-specific (compare Algeo 1985, 2010). The Chomskyan universal grammar seems to be a remote ideal in approaching language research. By contrast, Haspelmath (2010) introduces the notion of ‘comparative concept’, thus avoiding speaking of ‘universal categories’. In this\n\nPage 1 of 22\n\nNames and Grammar chapter, we advocate a cognitive view, and more specifically, an approach with a con­ structionist flavour. In construction grammar (Croft 2001), it is argued that the semantics of a linguistic ex­ pression determines its (morpho)syntax to a considerable extent. Thus, the semantic sta­ tus of names is mirrored by certain syntactic (called ‘symbolic’) constructions (see also Van Langendonck 2007b: ch. 2). Unfortunately, as Croft (1990: 268, fn. 24) notes, only few data about names are available in the linguistic typological literature because ‘most grammatical descriptions do not include information on proper names’. So far as Bantuist studies go, Van de Velde (2003) speaks of ‘a lack of the study of proper names, at least from a grammatical point of view’. Anderson (2004: 438) complains that ‘little theoretical attention in general linguistics has been paid to the morphosyntax of names’. To make things (p. 18) worse, contemporary ‘pragmatic’ or ‘discourse’ approaches to names show little interest in looking for grammatical criteria to characterize names, if only because their attention is focused on language use, not on established linguistic convention, whose rules are described by grammar. Often, established linguistic convention and grammar are hardly taken into consideration, see, among others Coates (2006a, 2006b, 2009b, 2012c), De Stefani and Pepin (2006: 132, 142, 2010), Brendler (2008), and even Algeo (2010: 95), who writes ‘. . . the individual use of names may form an important part of the theory of onomastics’. Nevertheless, all these scholars refer to (proper) names, common nouns, though seldom pronouns, without defining these nominal categories. It is apparently left to the speaker to determine what a name is in discourse since grammari­ ans are sometimes said to just make a mess of it. We cannot of course share this de­ featism, although the limited data available on names are undoubtedly insufficient to con­ stitute a representative sample of the world’s languages (but see Anderson 2007; Van Langendonck 2007b, 2010). A bias towards Indo-European (Western European, and espe­ cially English) will be unavoidable here. This will not prevent us from taking into account old and new morphosyntactic criteria for name status in some ‘exotic’ as well as more fa­ miliar languages. We will start from a semantic-pragmatic ‘comparative concept’ applying to the essence of ‘properhood’, as Coates (2006a, 2006b) calls it. Thus, we regard a name as a nominal ex­ pression that denotes a unique entity at the level of established linguistic convention to make it psychosocially salient within a given basic level category. The meaning of the name, if any, does not (or not any longer) determine its denotation (Van Langendonck 2007b: 125). Our task here is to find out to what extent the comparative concept of name corresponds to language-specific descriptive (sub-)categories in the languages for which we have data, and to what extent these categories formally mirror the denotative and semantic proper­ ties of names. As far as possible, morphosyntactic criteria will be connected with each of the semantic-pragmatic characteristics, that is, nominal status, unique denotation, cate­ gorical (or: basic level) presupposition, and the lack of defining sense. We will use a wellestablished convention in the typological literature to distinguish the universally applica­ ble semantic-pragmatic comparative concept of name from the language-specific gram­ Page 2 of 22\n\nNames and Grammar matical categories of Name, by using initial capitalization for the latter. Two important distinctions are to be made first: established linguistic onomastic convention vs. the use of language and names, and name vs. name lemma. Section 2.2 will then provide a char­ acterization of proper names. The chapter will conclude with a partial typology of names, organized according to a scale of typicality.\n\n2.1.1 Established Linguistic and Onomastic Convention vs. the Use of Language and Names The view that names have a unique denotation and can refer in discourse is in accor­ dance with Langacker’s (1987) notion of established linguistic convention (formerly langue or competence), forming a continuum with language use (formerly parole or performance). Just as denotation is an abstraction from reference, established lin­ guistic convention is an abstraction from language use. Only in established linguistic con­ (p. 19)\n\nvention does it make sense to speak of grammar or morphosyntax, which most linguists call the heart of the linguistic system. In this way, names can be given a genuine place in grammar as a structural category, like all other word classes. The grammar of names describes their peculiarities in established linguistic and onomas­ tic convention. Langacker’s (1987) concept of established linguistic convention is flexible and useful, also for names. As a part of it, we discern established onomastic convention. Names enter established onomastic convention via bestowal or via gradual onymization. This allows us to make three observations. First, although it is admitted that acts of reference fix the denotation of proper nouns (Coates 2006b: 39, 2012c: 121), it is not clear where this denotation finds its place if names are defined in terms of reference in language use. Clearly, unique denotation per­ tains to established linguistic convention. The rejection of this uniqueness in Coates (2012c) prohibits a distinction between names and pronouns since in this framework, both essentially refer in language use, even if they appear to denote as well, but not uniquely according to Coates (2012c). The lack of the notion of established linguistic con­ vention led philosophers like Bertrand Russell (1919: 179; 1964 [1918]: 201) to claim that genuine names were ‘logically proper names’, that is, referring words like this or that (compare Kripke 1972: 345, fn. 16). Russell called ordinary names ‘shorthand descrip­ tions’. Surely, referring words like this or that refer uniquely in a certain context, but the reference will differ in another context. However, taking Kripke’s term ‘rigid designator’ seriously, names denote uniquely in any context. Second, there is a continuum from established onomastic convention to the use of names in speech and writing. We may use a name just once, and then forget it, so it does not en­ ter established onomastic convention. For instance, referring to an unpopular guest, we could say: Hitler is coming tonight. In this example, Hitler is a new referent in discourse only, not yet a denotatum in established onomastic convention. That is one extreme. The other extreme for names is that many have been functioning in society for centuries, for instance family names, city, country, or river names, and the like. Page 3 of 22\n\nNames and Grammar Third, the notion of established onomastic convention allows us to recognize that there are well established names known and used only in small communities, such as nick­ names in a family, for example, Dutch Ons Pop ‘Our Doll’, called that by her father. This is an established name in this minimal community (Van Langendonck 2007b: 286). The oth­ er extreme is that there exist names known worldwide, such as Africa or Mandela.\n\n2.1.2 Name vs. Name Lemma (Proprial, Appellative, other Lemmas) Another important distinction is between lexical items and the way they are used in dif­ ferent contexts. Thus, names need to be distinguished from name lemmas. The term (p. 20) name lemma indicates a dictionary entry with an onomastic valency. For instance, the lemma Mary has the potential to be used as a name with one or more sublemmas that each underlie a name. Thus, the lemma Mary underlies a large number of names, such as Mary the mother of Jesus, Mary Stuart, and so on. Since the lemma Mary is typically used as a name, it can be called a proprial lemma. Proprial lemmas always allow common noun uses, albeit marginally, as in I was thinking of a different Mary. Proprial lemmas could be further subdivided into personal name lemmas, place-name lemmas, and so on, according to the type of name they are most typically used to denote. Again, this does not exclude a personal name lemma such as Mary from being used to denote the name of a boat, for in­ stance. We have seen that a proprial lemma can be used as a common noun (a different Mary). Conversely, names can be based on all kinds of lemmas. Thus, for instance, an ap­ pellative lemma is assigned to a name like the film name Gladiator, and a phrasal lemma to a novel name such as The Old Man and the Sea. In many languages the etymology of most personal names is transparent, and it is sometimes stated that ‘names have a mean­ ing’ in such languages. A more accurate way to characterize these languages is to say that they have no or few proprial lemmas and that personal names tend to be based on appellative lemmas. Finally, common nouns can be derived from names metaphorically or metonymically, as are Napoleon and Jane in (1)–(2). Such common nouns are called depro­ prial in Van de Velde (2009). (1) (2)\n\n2.2 Characterization of Names In this section we will characterize names as nouns (2.2.1) with unique denotation (2.2.2) that have an inherent basic level sense (2.2.3), no defining sense (2.2.5), but optionally connotative meanings. We will argue that names can be considered to be the most proto­ typical nominal category (2.2.4), and we will compare names with pronouns (2.2.6).\n\nPage 4 of 22\n\nNames and Grammar\n\n2.2.1 Names and Nouns From Antiquity onwards, it has been held that names are nouns (or possibly noun phras­ es). Classical terminology speaks of onoma kyrion (nomen proprium), and onoma proseig­ orikon (nomen appellativum). Therefore both names and appellatives are considered to be nouns (Gary-Prieur 1994: 243). Following Hudson (1990: 170), personal (and other) pro­ nouns can also be regarded as nouns. According to this, we have three kinds of nouns. Few scholars seem to dispute the thesis that names are nouns or at least nominal (p. 21) expressions. For Coates (2006a: 373), names are noun phrases though not typically nouns. Anderson (2004: 436; 2007) contends that names ‘are no more nouns than are pro­ nouns or determiners’. If a pronoun is a kind of noun there is no problem. However, it seems difficult to view a name as a kind of determiner, at least syntactically, even if the determiner is considered to be the head of the ‘noun phrase’ (Anderson 2004: 456; but see Van Langendonck 1994). From a cross-linguistic perspective, trying to determine whether names are nouns may not be the most meaningful goal, since the answer depends on how one chooses to define the comparative concept of noun, especially in languages such as Straits Salish where parts of speech distinctions are not very clear cut. The question can better be answered on the language specific level, where the semantic-pragmatic comparative concept of name provided in the introduction can correspond to zero, one or more than one gram­ matical category of Name. The grammatical characteristics of Names in a given language should be compared to those of Common Nouns in that language. In English, for instance, Names can take (non-restrictive) determiners, just like Nouns but unlike Pronouns, for example that modifying George Bush in (3), and Britain’s modifying Jeremy Irons in (4). See Section 2.2.6 for more discussion of the difference between names and pronouns. (3) (4)\n\nStill in English, Names can be grammatically differentiated from Common Nouns due to their ability to appear as the identifying element in close appositional patterns of the form [(definite article +) noun + (definite article +) noun], for example Fido the dog. (Van Lan­ gendonck 2007b: 4, 131; Idiatov 2007).1 The unit that does not characterize but identifies is a name (noun), that is, Fido. The appellative dog indicates the categorical presupposi­ tion.2 This grammatical criterion for distinguishing Names from Common Nouns seems to be valid for most Indo-European languages (e.g. French la ville de Paris, Dutch de stad Amsterdam, or Polish miasto Kraków ‘(the) city (of) Cracow’). In other languages, such as the Gabonese Bantu language Orungu, this criterion cannot be used to distinguish Names from Common Nouns, but agreement provides a grammatical criterion (see Van de Velde and Ambouroue 2011 for Orungu and Van de Velde 2009 for Kirundi). (p. 22)\n\nPage 5 of 22\n\nNames and Grammar\n\n2.2.2 The Unique Denotation of Names The unique denotation of names entails their definiteness, as well as their incompatibility with restrictive relative clauses and their inability to refer back anaphorically.\n\n2.2.2.1 Names as Definite Noun Phrases Definiteness is well-established both as an inherent feature of names (cf. among others Sørensen 1958; Dalberg 1985: 129; Löbner 1985: 299; Pamp 1985: 113; Wotjak 1985: 7, 13; Abbott 2002; but see Allerton 1987; Lyons 1999; Anderson 2003: 351, 394, 2004), and as of personal pronouns (Löbner 1985: 300). The feature ‘definite’ is often understood as displaying a presupposition of existence in the universe of discourse, at least in its proto­ typical occurrences (Van Langendonck 1979; cf. 1981; Kleiber 1992). It does not come as a surprise that names, which have a fixed denotation, suggesting uniqueness and exis­ tence, are bound to have this grammatical meaning. The syntactic evidence we will ad­ duce for the definiteness of names will pertain only to their denotative use as arguments (see Van Langendonck 1981). Sometimes, languages show an overt distinction between this use and other uses. Greek, for instance, puts a definite article before personal names in argument position, that is, in the denotative use of names, though not in vocatives or name-giving utterances (e.g. I name this child X, Anderson 2004: 441–2, 456). A diagnostic for the definiteness of names in (colloquial) English can be found in the fol­ lowing observation: NPs that occur in right dislocation and are announced by a cataphor­ ic personal pronoun, have to be definite. It turns out then that, like other definite NPs, names can occur in right dislocation in this way, at least in colloquial speech (Quirk, et al. 1985: 632): (5) (6) (7) Announced by a personal pronoun (he, it), the definite NPs of a proprial, pronominal, or appellative nature that brother of yours, your game, John are able to appear in right dislo­ cation. For the indefinite appellative NP a neighbour, this possibility is excluded. Appar­ ently, it is only definite NPs, with their presupposition of existence and uniqueness, that can occur as ‘afterthoughts’, in this case; well-known referents that the speaker wants to recall, just to ensure the hearer will think of the right person or thing. Since names are inherently definite, the addition of an overt definiteness marker is super­ fluous, and definite articles with names are often used to express notions other than defi­ niteness. Certain types of names have a fixed determiner in English (e.g. the Nile), which can be argued to have a classifying function. We shall return to this in Section 2.3.2. We also find an expressive use of the article, such as the augmentative use (p. 23) of the arti­ cle with Flemish forenames in certain dialectal areas, for example de Jan ‘the John’. In German, the article has almost lost its expressivity with first names because of its fre­ Page 6 of 22\n\nNames and Grammar quency in discourse (e.g. der Johann). In other contexts, the addition of a definite article is honorific: La Callas. When a name appears with an indefinite article in English, the latter expresses merely countable singularity (its original function), while the propriality and therefore the defi­ niteness of the name are preserved, as in: (8) (9)\n\nIt is useful at this point to remind ourselves of the distinction between names and the name lemma on which they are based. In the Gabonese Bantu language Orungu, nouns are marked for definiteness by means of their tone pattern. Many personal names are based on an appellative lemma with an indefinite tone pattern, for example ŋgùwà ‘a shield’. Used as names, these nouns are definite, as is the phrasal name of the French movie Un prophète (A prophet).\n\n2.2.2.2 No Restrictive Relative Clauses with Names Restrictive modifiers limit the extension of a given NP. Therefore, names are incompatible with such modifiers (see Sørensen 1958; Seppänen 1971, 1982; Vandelanotte and Willemse 2002). The most conspicuous of restrictive modifiers is the relative clause. As a rule, the English relative pronoun that refers to inanimate appellative antecedents and in­ troduces a restrictive clause. A zero form can be used for any restrictive clause if it is not intended to ‘replace’ the clause’s subject, for example (10) By contrast, proprial antecedents do not allow such restrictive devices because of their unique denotation, for example (11)\n\n(12)\n\nPage 7 of 22\n\nNames and Grammar 2.2.2.3 Anaphoric Relations Since names display a fixed denotation, it is predictable that they cannot refer back in the discourse to any other kind of NP, at least in the standard anaphoric way. Lakoff (p. 24) (1968: 17–19) and Cole (1974: 671) pointed this out, setting up a cline going from the strongest anaphoric elements (clitic pronouns) to the weakest (names) (Van Langendonck 2007b: 153). Examples could be: (13) (14)\n\nWith this criterion, the most marked difference between personal pronouns and names is brought to the fore. Personal pronouns display the least specific denotation whereas names show the most rigid reference because of their fixed extension. At the same time, we can see that in this respect, names differ least from multidenotative NPs like the prime minister in (14).\n\n2.2.3 Names (not Lemmas) Have an Inherent Basic Level Sense A crucial characteristic of names is that they have an inherent categorical presupposed sense (compare Coates 2012c: 125). Philosophers such as Geach (1957: section 16) and Searle (1958) argue that this categorical sense is necessary for every use of a name to preserve the identity of the referent. Likewise, certain psychologists see a categorical, and more precisely a basic level sense in names. La Palme Reyes et al. (1993: 445) estab­ lish (15) which is to be read as ‘Freddy in the category DOG’ is ‘this in the category DOG’. Thus, there is a deictic component in names (this), as in pronouns, but there is also a cat­ egorical appellative sense (dog). Names can therefore be situated between pronouns and common nouns from a semantic viewpoint (see Molino 1982: 19; Valentine et al. 1996; Hollis and Valentine 2001; James 2004; Van Langendonck 2007b: 169–171). The inherent categorical sense of names is presupposed and therefore cannot be negat­ ed. A fortiori, in a sentence like London is on the Thames, the existence of London is pre­ supposed, as is its basic level category city. Obviously, we can say London is not a city. But in this special case, the asserted sense contradicts the presupposition. The basic level categories for which the individual members typically receive a name, are to a certain ex­ tent culture specific. Thus cows typically have a name in Kirundi (Bantu, Burundi), but Page 8 of 22\n\nNames and Grammar not, or much less often, in present-day English. Note that person is usually (p. 25) not the basic level category for personal names, nor is place the one for place-names. In such highly salient categories the basic level tends to be lower on the hierarchy, man and woman for human beings, city, country, village, etc. for places. The rest of this section will adduce neurolinguistic and morphosyntactic evidence for the presupposed inherent categorical meaning of names. Neurolinguistic evidence is report­ ed in Bayer (1991) (see Van Langendonck 2007b: 110–13 for discussion), who worked with a patient (H.J.) suffering from so-called deep dyslexia, which means that she can ob­ serve written texts exclusively via a semantic route and not by means of a transmission from grapheme to phoneme. Such patients cannot read nonsense words, they have diffi­ culties reading abstract words or grammatical morphemes, and reading concrete com­ mon nouns often gives rise to paralexia, for example reading hammer when axe is written. H.J. is unable to read names. However, she always recognizes them as names and for per­ sonal names she could usually specify whether the name bearer is a man or a woman. She could also identify place-names as names for cities, countries, or rivers. Bayer concludes that there must exist a minimal lexical categorical sense belonging to the semantic mem­ ory, specifying the categorical presupposition. Bayer also reports on a different type of re­ sponse that H.J. gave when asked to read names, viz. connotations. Thus, the name Aus­ tralia triggered the basic level sense ‘country’, but also connotations such as ‘far away’ and ‘kangaroos’. We will come back to these non-lexical connotative meanings in Section 2.2.7. Strong morphosyntactic evidence for the categorical sense of names can be found in the Burundese Bantu language Kirundi (Van de Velde 2009). As in the great majority of Bantu languages, nouns trigger noun class agreement in Kirundi. Noun classes are overtly marked by means of a nominal prefix, so that the agreement pattern triggered by a noun is largely predictable from its prefix. This is not the case for Kirundi Names, however, which trigger the same agreement pattern as the common noun that is used to refer to their basic level category. Thus, names for dogs agree according to the noun class of the common noun imbwá ‘dog’ (class 9), and personal names agree according to the class of the common noun umuuntu ‘person’ (class 1). This is illustrated in (16) by means of the name Rukara, based on the lemma that underlies the common noun urukara ‘blackness’ (class 11). Agreement prefixes are marked by means of roman numbers in the glosses.3\n\n(16)\n\nPage 9 of 22\n\nNames and Grammar More grammatical evidence for the basic level sense of names can be found in the choice of an interrogative pro-word in name questions such as What is x’s name (Idiatov 2007: 61–94, 2010). In languages that differentiate between ‘who’ and ‘what’, the choice between both is determined by two independent parameters, viz. entity type and type of reference. Entity type distinguishes between PERSONS and THINGS (i.e. non-persons). Type of reference distinguishes between IDENTIFICATION and CLASSIFICATION or cate­ gorization. ‘Who’ is prototypically used in questions for the identification of a person, whereas ‘what’ is used to ask for a categorization of a thing. The name question What is x’s name is non-canonical in that it asks for the identification of a thing (i.e. a name). In order to deal with this non-canonical situation, many languages avoid the choice between ‘who’ and ‘what’, using other interrogatives such as ‘how’, ‘which’, or ‘where’. In lan­ guages that do not use this avoidance strategy, the choice between ‘who’ and ‘what’ very often depends on the categorical sense of the name that is expected as an answer. If the name of a human being is expected, ‘who’ will be selected. If the basic level category of the name is non-human or inanimate (depending on the language), ‘what’ is selected. This is illustrated in (17) with an example from the Sepik-Ramu language Namia from Papua New Guinea (cited from Idiatov 2007, who obtained the example from Becky Feldpausch, (p. 26)\n\np.c.). Note that English selects ‘what’ in such questions, irrespective of the categorical sense of the expected answer.\n\n(17)\n\nFinally, the presence or absence of a categorical sense distinguishes names from other words with unique reference, such as the internet, the universe, or the sun. These words for singleton categories lack a basic level categorical presupposition: [the x (the) inter­ net] and [the x (the) universe].\n\n2.2.4 Names as the Most Prototypical Nominal Category If we look at the grammatical features that are relevant for names, it is striking that names tend to have the unmarked feature value. Therefore, it could be argued that names are the most prototypical nominal category. This conclusion runs counter to Langacker (1991: ch. 1). We saw in Section 2.2.1 that names are definite. As regards DEFINITENESS, it has been argued in Van Langendonck (1979) that it is the unmarked counterpart of the feature [+/– definite]. Karmiloff-Smith (1979), Mayerthaler (1988), and Croft (1990) have come to the same conclusion on various grounds: early acquisition, experiential and typological evi­ dence. In fact, definiteness is the most natural state of a referring expression, that is, def­ inite and referential go together (Van Langendonck 1994). As regards the feature (p. 27) NUMBER, names are mostly singular (and countable): Kevin, Mary, London, the Rhine, and so on. Sometimes they show a collective plural: the Andes, the Philippines.\n\nPage 10 of 22\n\nNames and Grammar As regards the features DEFINITENESS and NUMBER, there is an essential difference from common nouns: where we have a dichotomy of plus and minus in the features of one and the same common noun, e.g. the city vs. a city; city vs. cities, there is no such opposi­ tion in one and the same name. Pluralia tantum such as the Andes and the Philippines are rare, and are not even ordinary plurals since they are not quantifiable: *(the) many Andes. Even in such plural names we find an element of singularity: the plurality is construed as a unity, a singularity, a fact we have accounted for by calling pluralia tantum collective plurals.\n\n2.2.5 Names have no Defining Sense To get to grips with the notion of ‘sense’, we can put specific questions asked by Stephen Ullmann and other scholars, such as: What does the word ‘table’ mean? Or What do you understand by ‘table’? If these are questions that make sense, then the word has ‘sense’, that is, definitional lexical meaning. Indeed, we can give a definition of the word table, as found in dictionaries. Usually, such words, in this case the common noun table, show poly­ semy, that is, a coherent set of semantic features, of which one is often prototypical. For instance, Webster’s dictionary defines a table as a piece of furniture consisting of a smooth flat slab fixed on legs; this sense is akin to the sense of a tablet or a contents list, and so on. On the basis of these senses, we can find the referents. By contrast, in the case of names, the designation prevails over the meanings. As Ullmann (1969: 33) contends: ‘One cannot possibly say that one understands a name; one can only say that one knows whom it refers to, whose name it is’.4 It does not make sense to ask: What does th"
