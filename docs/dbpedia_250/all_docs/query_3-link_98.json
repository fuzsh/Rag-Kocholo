        "text": "Two runners from Högby IF emerged victorious in Ultravasan 90. Last year's third-place finisher, Olle Meijer, clinched the men's class, while Ida Nilsson secured the win among the women, despite both of them taking wrong turns at the start of the race. Jesper Lundberg and Erica Lech triumphed in Ultravasan 45, while Martin Nilsson and Jenny Björnberg claimed victory in Trailvasan 30. The Vasaloppet Summer Week 2023 attracted over 20,000 registered participants, including 14,000 cyclists and 6,000 runners. Registration for next year's Summer Week is already open.\n\nThe start of Ultravasan 90 at 05:00 on Saturday morning in Berga by, Sälen, saw the field covered in mist with a temperature of 9 degrees Celsius. However, that mist would lift and the sun would emerge, leading to a perfect day for long-distance running.\n\nThis was the first year that the ultrarunners ascended the first uphill slope in Sälen, reaching Vasaloppet's highest point at 528 metres above sea level, just like the skiers in winter. A new route to the first checkpoint in Smågan was also introduced. Unfortunately, this caused the leading group of 14 runners to take a wrong turn.\n\nUltravasan 90 Men\n\nFour runners were first to reach the highest point after 15 minutes of running: last year's third-place finisher Olle Meijer, along with three former winners; Sébastien Spehler from France, Elov Olsson, and Viktor Stenqvist.\n\nApproximately five kilometres after the start, the first 13 male runners and one female runner mistakenly continued straight on a gravel road instead of taking a 90-degree turn onto a trail. They ran for about two kilometres to a turning point before realizing their mistake and retracing their steps.\n\nVasaloppet's Sport Manager Tommy Höglund explains what happened:\n\n\"The wrong turn occurred on the new route for this year, about five kilometres after the start of Ultravasan 90. It was a junction that turned out to be inadequately marked. There were markers, but there was no barrier. We can only apologize for what happened.\"\n\nDue to this detour, \"Mr. Ultravasan\" Jonas Buud (who didn't take the wrong turn) led the way in Smågan, but Edvin Claesson won the first sprint prize in Mångsbodarna, ahead of Buud by 46 seconds. The runners who went off course began to catch up, but the one with most significant progress – last year's winner Viktor Stenqvist – was still six minutes behind the leader in Mångsbodarna.\n\nJonas Buud held the lead in Risberg, followed by Olle Meijer and Sébastien Spehler two minutes behind. Apparently unaffected by the detour and extra distance, Meijer and Spehler overtook Buud. By the halfway point at Evertsberg, Meijer secured the hill prize, two seconds ahead of Spehler. They were about five minutes ahead of Elov Olsson, Mikael Ekvall, and Polish runner Andrzej Piotrowski. The top seven runners in Evertsberg were all ones who had taken the wrong route at the beginning of the race. However, Jonas Buud, who was eighth, had to abort his race in Evertsberg due to injury concerns.\n\nLast year, Olle Meijer ran his first Ultravasan 90 and lost his lead after Evertsberg, finishing third. However, this year he extended his lead. At the Oxberg checkpoint, 64 km into the race, Meijer led by two minutes over Spehler, but then the Frenchman stopped multiple times. Piotrowski was in third place, trailing Meijer by six minutes.\n\nOlle Meijer secured the final sprint prize in Hökberg, with 19 kilometres left to the finish line. Piotrowski was now in second place, and Elov Olsson was in third place as Spehler had withdrawn. Meijer's lead remained unchallenged, and with a winning time of 6 hours, 46 minutes, and 13 seconds, he crossed the finish line 7 minutes and 20 seconds ahead of the second-place finisher.\n\n\"Yeah, it feels really good. It was a long day today, nearly 97 kilometres. I got a bit stressed at the time, but I kept an eye on the field and knew that those of us who were competing for the win were the ones who had taken the wrong turn. I respect Spehler, he's won before, and last year I lost a lot of time after Evertsberg, but it helped my mental strength when I realized that I could keep up with him after he caught up with me,\" said Olle Meijer after crossing the finish line.\n\n\"It was very tough around Oxberg and Hökberg because the sun was beating down, and it's a challenging course there. At the same time, I got good reports that the others were falling behind. It felt reassuring but still incredibly tough to make it to the finish line.\"\n\nThe feeling of coming onto the home stretch?\n\n\"Unbelievably satisfying, but mostly it was a relief to finally stop,\" said Olle Meijer, who was participating in only his second ever ultramarathon.\n\nAndrzej Piotrowski finished second, and Elov Olsson came in third.\n\nUltravasan 90 Women\n\nUp to the highest point, Ida Nilsson only had 13 male runners ahead of her, and her lead in the women's class was one minute ahead of Liselotte Hellsten and Sophia Sundberg.\n\nIn Smågan, there were seven runners within 30 seconds. Ida Nilsson was the only female runner who went off course along with the leading males. She arrived at Smågan in 21st place, over nine minutes behind the leader Sophia Sundberg.\n\nSofia Smedman led in Mångsbodarna. In Risberg, she was accompanied by Sophia Sundberg. Their lead was 1.22 ahead of Anna Hellström, who won in 2022. In fourth place was Caitriona Jennings from Ireland.\n\nSophia Sundberg was then in the lead but fell and hit her hip and knee. After four hours of running, she was the first to reach Evertsberg where she stopped and changed her shoes. Second-placed Sofia Smedman was one and a half minutes behind in Evertsberg.\n\nSophia Sundberg finished fourth in Ultravasan's premiere in 2014 and had not run Ultravasan 90 since then. Now she was experiencing hip pain.\n\nIda Nilsson made the most progress at this stage and was soon in second place, 2.23 behind Sophia Sundberg in Oxberg and 1.08 in Hökberg. A few kilometres later, she took over the lead.\n\nIda Nilsson won Ultravasan 90 in 2017 and was second in 2018, and she now secured her second victory. Despite the detour, her final time was 7.23.52, with a winning margin of just over two minutes. She was very satisfied after crossing the finish line:\n\n\"I am very happy; I never thought it would work out with such a significant detour of four kilometres. That's more than just a little mistake... It's partially on me; you can't just blame the fact that you're following the pack.\"\n\n\"When I realized how far behind I was, I thought 'it's never going to happen.' I was 12 minutes behind, and I knew how strong they were. I didn't believe, but I thought I'd push on and see what happens. The trail was narrow, and it was difficult to pass, but runners ahead were incredibly helpful and let us through. But then I hit a rough patch again when I wasn't catching up. After Evertsberg, it's mostly downhill, which is my strength, so I pushed on and made up quite a bit.\"\n\nThe feeling at the finish line?\n\n\"Massively relieved, but it's a bit frustrating that it became unnecessarily tough,\" said Ida Nilsson, joyful with the winner's garland around her neck.\n\nSecond-placed Sophia Sundberg almost stumbled at the finish line.\n\n\"I'm really pleased but also very tired. I've run with such pain. Ida truly deserves this, especially since she ran extra after the taking the wrong route. I was also close to going off course, but I turned back. Big congratulations to Ida; she's fantastic. I didn't have the strength to keep up when she passed by.\"\n\nMalin Barrulf repeated her third-place finish from 2021.\n\nUltravasan 45 Men\n\nUltravasan 45 started in Oxberg at 09:00. The winner of the past two years, Kristofer Låås, took the lead right from the start, just like last year. However, at the checkpoint in Oxberg after 16 kilometres, Kristofer was in second place, one minute behind Jesper Lundberg.\n\nJesper Lundberg pulled ahead and got the victory, also improving the record time by five minutes to 2.34.29.\n\n\"I experienced some cramping and wasn't sure if I could hold on. I tried to get reports of what was happening behind me. But it still felt quite under control,\" said Jesper Lundberg.\n\nKristofer Låås also broke the previous course record, securing the second position with a time of 2.34, just behind this year's winner. Andreas Lundgård secured the third place.\n\nUltravasan 45 Women\n\nErica Lech won this year's race ahead of Barbro Fjällstedt Oljans, who won last year.\n\n\"At the start line I heard 'Jeppe' say that everyone is in it to win, and I thought that's what you have to do; you need to have that mindset. Barbro is strong in the woods; I couldn't keep up there. But after that, it got easier, and that's when I could push a little more. I wanted to hold back in the first 15 kilometres so I'd have some energy left to pick up the pace. The last five kilometres were tough. It turned out to be a dream race, actually,\" said Erica Lech.\n\nThere was a new record time in the women's Ultravasan 45 as well, 3.02.09. Erica Lech broke the previous record by 38 seconds:\n\n\"I tried to ignore it; towards the end I knew I was at the edge, with so little left that I thought I wouldn't make it. It was magical to run on the home stretch; there isn't much that's better.\"\n\nBarbro Fjällstedt Oljans secured the second place this year, with Malin Gibrand coming in third.\n\nTrailvasan 30 Men\n\nMartin Nilsson surpassed the favourite to win and last year's second-place finisher, David Nilsson, finishing two minutes faster than the 2022 winning time.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it, I thought I would tire out at some point. Completely unbelievable,\" said this year's winner right after crossing the finish line.\n\nDavid Nilsson secured second place, trailing the winner by nine minutes. David Lundström came in third.\n\nTrailvasan 30 Women\n\nJenny Björnberg won Trailvasan 30 and became the first woman to finish the race in under two hours since its premiere last year.\n\n\"I made sure to position myself well at the beginning, not showing any signs of fatigue, and then I took the lead. I've tried to maintain a steady pace throughout the entire race. So, I'm absolutely thrilled,\" said Jenny Björnberg.\n\nThe second place was secured by Petra Kindlund, with Johanna Widarsson Norbeck in third place.\n\nRESULTS\n\nUltravasan 90 Men, 92 km, Sälen–Mora, 2023-08-19\n\n1 Olle Meijer, (SWE) Högby IF 6.46.13\n\n2 Andrzej Piotrowski, (POL) WKS Wawel Krakow 6.53.33\n\n3 Elov Olsson, (SWE) Ockelbo SK, Hoka, Ockelbomaffian 6.58.46\n\n4 Mikael Ekvall, (SWE) Strömstad löparklubb 7.06.20\n\n5 Erik Anfält, (SWE) Örebro AIK 7.08.02\n\n6 Sebastian Sundius, (SWE) IFK Mora 7.13.06\n\n7 Viktor Stenqvist, (SWE) Billingen X-trail SC/Craft Run Team 7.14.04\n\n8 Rasmus Gustafsson, (SWE) Team Minos SC 7.41.59\n\n9 Erik Olofsson, (SWE) IF Mantra Sport 7.44.20\n\n10 Oscar Olsson, (SWE) SK Glädjen 7.47.43\n\nSprint prizes Ultravasan 90 Men 2023\n\nMångsbodarna: Edvin Claesson, 1.54.41\n\nHill prize Evertsberg: Olle Meijer, 3.40.18\n\nHökberg: Olle Meijer, 6.08.00\n\nUltravasan 90 Women, 92 km, Sälen–Mora, 2023-08-19\n\n1 Ida Nilsson, (SWE) Högby IF 7.23.54\n\n2 Sophia Sundberg, (SWE) Keep Up RC 7.25.59\n\n3 Malin Barrulf, (SWE) IFK Mora / Salomon Sverige 7.31.13\n\n4 Anna Hellström, (SWE) Enebybergs IF 7.42.17\n\n5 Sofia Smedman, (SWE) Billingen X-trail SC/Craft run team 7.50.09\n\n6 Cajsa Berg, (SWE) Enhörna IF 7.51.15\n\n7 Maria Saxvall, (SWE) Torsångs IF 8.09.57\n\n8 Frida Södermark, (SWE) Tjalve FIF 8.10.42\n\n9 Ebba Sigfridson, (SWE) Terrible Tuesday Triathlon 8.13.36\n\n10 Petra Klevmar, (SWE) Umara SC 8.27.57\n\nSprint prizes Ultravasan 90 Women 2023\n\nMångsbodarna: Sofia Smedman, 2.05.56\n\nHill prize Evertsberg: Sophia Sundberg, 4.00.23\n\nHökberg: Sophia Sundberg, 5.57.11\n\nUltravasan 45 Men, 45 km, Oxberg–Mora, 2023-08-19\n\n1 Jesper Lundberg, (SWE) Hunflens LS 2.34.29\n\n2 Kristofer Låås, (SWE) Keep Up RC 2.37.03\n\n3 Andreas Lundegård, (SWE) FK Studenterna 2.43.44\n\n4 Isak Augustsson, (SWE) JA Skidservice 2.57.01\n\n5 Björn Martinsson, (SWE) Vänersborgs AIK 3.04.57\n\n6 Marcus Jansson, (SWE) Mölndals AIK/Team Bergspring by Arkitek 3.25.19\n\n7 Jan-Erik Olsson, (SWE) Sellnäs IF 3.26.25\n\n8 Warren Renkel, (GBR) Run Free Fell Runners 3.31.52\n\n9 Thomas Bergman, (SWE) Gagnef IF 3.32.28\n\n10 Erik Melakari, (SWE) Trångsund 3.33.20\n\nUltravasan 45 Women, 45 km, Oxberg–Mora, 2023-08-19\n\n1 Erica Lech, (SWE) Örebro AIK 3.02.09\n\n2 Barbro Fjällstedt Oljans, (SWE) Säter IF FIK 3.08.50\n\n3 Malin Gibrand, (SWE) FK Studenterna 3.15.03\n\n4 Monica Pihl, (SWE) Borås SK 3.39.34\n\n5 Ingvild Aurdal, (NOR) Fetsund 3.40.29\n\n6 Maja Stefansson, (SWE) Oxbergs IF 3.46.14\n\n7 Tove Reymers, (FIN) Wisby Ultralöparförening 3.54.44\n\n8 Elin Fallberg, (SWE) Mora 3.57.53\n\n9 Linea Arlehed, (SWE) Sollerön 3.58.09\n\n10 Knipnäs Malin Blomkvist, (SWE) Venjans AIK 4.00.26\n\nTrailvasan 30 Men, 30 km, Oxberg–Mora, 2023-08-19\n\n1 Martin Nilsson, (SWE) IFK Umeå 1.38.51\n\n2 David Nilsson, (SWE) Högby IF 1.47.51\n\n3 David Lundström, (SWE) Tisdagsklubben Örebro 1.54.02\n\n4 John Lundström, (SWE) Tisdagsklubben Örebro 1.54.10\n\n5 Andreas Mannberg, (SWE) Malungs IF 1.55.05\n\n6 Mattias Argårds, (SWE) IFK Mora FIK 1.55.37\n\n7 Anton Öhman, (SWE) Tisdagsklubben Örebro 1.57.11\n\n8 Christoffer Lundgren Björnqvist, (SWE) Katrineholm SK Friidrott 1.57.40\n\n9 Rikki Frederiksen, (DEN) Frederiksberg IF 1.59.13\n\n10 Matthias Flade, (GER) SC Münchberg/new balance 2.01.20\n\nTrailvasan 30 Women, 30 km, Oxberg–Mora, 2023-08-19\n\n1 Jenny Björnberg, (SWE) Falu IK Friidrott 1.58.52\n\n2 Petra Kindlund, (SWE) Runacademy IF 2.04.28\n\n3 Johanna Widarsson Norbeck, (SWE) Örgryte IS / Team Löplabbet 2.15.17\n\n4 Sigrid Andersson, (SWE) Hunflens Löparsällskap 2.23.04\n\n5 Sofia Norgren, (SWE) Ludvika FFI 2.24.03\n\n6 Jessica Imbert, (FRA) 2.25.50\n\n7 Frida Kristiansson, (SWE) Malungs CK 2.27.50\n\n8 Therese Persson, (SWE) 2.30.32\n\n9 Emma Holfve, (SWE) Brudpiga RK 2.32.05\n\n10 Åsa Synnerholm, (SWE) 2.33.20\n\nAll results\n\nStart lists, live results, results lists and statistics can be found here:\n\nhttps://media.vasaloppet.se/2023/?lang=EN_CAP\n\nusername: vasa\n\npassword: media\n\nKranskulla and Kransmas 2023\n\nThis year's Kranskulla and Kransmas are Alice Larsson (Sälens IF) and Albin Gezelius (IFK Mora).\n\nMedal times\n\nAll participants who finish Ultravasan 90, Ultravasan 45, Trailvasan 30, Trailvasan 10 and Vasastafetten receive a medal.
