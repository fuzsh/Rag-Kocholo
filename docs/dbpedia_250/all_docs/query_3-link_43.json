But what is the point of the race? Well, the purpose of the race is to raise awareness and to demonstrate the need for blood donation and to promote a healthy lifestyle. The proceeds of the race will go back to the youth activities of the organizing associations and to promoting the importance of blood donation.\n\nThis is a purpose that we at Royal Djurgården support one hundred percent.\n\nAbout the race\n\nThe start and finish of Blodomloppet is in the meadows around the Djurgårdsbrunn inn. The first start is at 16:30 but already hours before, participants will arrive at the event area. The event is expected to end around 21:00. Participants will run or walk 5 km (red) or 10 km (yellow) according to the route below.\n\nRoad closures\n\nDuring these two days there will be some limited traffic, so we recommend that you take extra care in planning your trip.\n\nWe will restrict access on the Manilla Road from the junction of Kaknäsvägen/Manilla Road between 4pm and 9pm. There will be a driving ban for participants.\n\nHunduddsvägen will also have a parking ban and restricted access for participants between 6pm and 7.30pm.\n\nBlockhusringen limited access between 16.00 and 19.30\n\nBus line 69 will turn at Kaknästornet between 16.00-21.00 on these days (i.e. will not continue towards Blockhusudden).\n\nWe hope that events will not be too disruptive. But if it does remember that it is for a very good purpose.\n\nWarm greetings\n\nFrom IFK Lidingö Athletics Club and IFK Lidingö Ski & Orienteering Club, organisers of the Stockholm Blood Race.\n\nYou can find more information about the Blodomloppet on their website here.\n\nAstronaut Christer Fuglesang gets behind the wheel as Sweden’s first car gets a new lease of life\n\nIt was at the end of the 19th century that the engineer Gustaf Erikson Vagnsfabriks AB in Södertälje – VABIS was commissioned to develop a Swedish-made automobile with an internal combustion engine. In 1898, a first version was ready for test driving. The experimental car, which never travelled any distance, has been in the Technical Museum’s collection since 1927 and was displayed until recently in the Maskinhallen.\n\nAstronaut Christer Fuglesang gets behind the wheel as Sweden’s first car gets a new lease of life\n\nBut now, on 1 June, the museum hopes to start the car and show it to the public on a number of occasions. But not just anyone behind the wheel, astronaut Christer Fuglesang will have the honour of driving the 1897 car, which has been given a new lease of life after thousands of hours in the workshop.\n\nThe display is part of the Museum of Technology’s Sustainability Days, which showcase both historic means of transport and vehicles of the future.\n\nThe premiere ride will take place on 1 June 2022 outside the entrance of the Technical Museum, where anyone who wants to is welcome to join in and see how many metres ago the 124-year-old Surahammar horse-drawn carriage can roll.\n\nTest drive of Sweden’s first car\n\nTime: 1 June 2022 at 14:00\n\nLocation: Museiparken, Technical Museum, Stockholm\n\nA sustainable future\n\nEarlier this spring, the Museum of Technology opened Zero City, an exhibition that allows visitors to experience and be challenged to help solve the need for sustainable transport. Among the historic vehicles are the Leon Bollée (1897) – the first car to roll on the streets of Stockholm, the Milburn Electric from 1919 and, of course, the T-Ford (1920). Several of them are part of the museum’s so-called “Handling Collection” – objects that can be driven and displayed for experience.\n\nUpcoming events on future sustainable transport can be found below:\n\n2-7 June:\n\nTraffic Smart Week at Royal Djurgården. South Djurgården is closed to private car traffic. At the Museum of Technology, solutions for mobility and transport of the future sustainable city are shown in the exhibition Zero City.\n\n7-12 June:\n\nToyota Smart Mobility Week – vehicles of the future are showcased to the press and visitors, including a hydrogen generator, a hydrogen bus and several other mobility solutions.\n\nWhen Royal Djurgården is at its most exciting, we welcome everyone – except the car.\n\nDuring the 2- 7 June there will be lots of fun events around Stockholm and especially here at Djurgården. This will be evident in the wonderful atmosphere that will permeate the whole island. During these days, all visitors to Djurgården will have the chance to experience fantastic events such as the Swedish National Day at Skansen, concerts at Gröna Lund, the Stockholm Marathon, the Marine celebrating 500 years and much more.\n\nMany people are looking for us and in order for everyone to be able to get around, we need to think traffic-smart. We know that a few cars risk clogging up the entire main street of Djurgården and therefore we have chosen to close the Bridge to Djurgården to car traffic during these days. Because when Djurgården is at its most exciting and eventful, we welcome everyone – except the car. With a car-free Djurgården, we are also testing converting parking spaces into places for art, cycling schools and people. So On 2-7 June, the Djurgården Bridge will be closed to car traffic, for a more accessible and delightful Djurgården.”\n\nIt’s a public festival in the city and everyone is welcome, but bear in mind that to take an extra look at how you plan your trip. As roads and bridges will be closed, we advise all our visitors to reach us by foot, bike or public transport.\n\nWelcome to Djurgården!\n\nTake a walk in The Royal National City Park\n\nThe long-awaited spring has finally arrived, and that means that Stockholmers and visitors from all over the world are flocking to Djurgården as soon as they have a spare moment. Perhaps you are one of them? Then here are some spring tips for you.\n\nFor many people, life in a big city can start to feel a bit hectic and stressful after spending a long time there, no matter how great the city is. That’s what makes Stockholm, and Djurgården in particular, so unique, as it is home to the world’s first National City Park. It gives people a chance to get away from their hectic everyday lives and find their inner peace.\n\nIn our opinion, one of the best times to visit is right now during spring. As the park is home to over 800 different flowering plants and around 100 species of nesting birds, it gives our visitors the perfect opportunity to experience spring in Scandinavia’s largest city.\n\nBut it’s not just us who think the place is unique, Djurgården has been called “Stockholm’s most beautiful island” and is appreciated by many.\n\nHere are some tips from us at Royal Djurgården on what not to miss when you visit our lovely island.\n\nBlockhusudden\n\nOne of the most popular walking routes in Stockholm is along the Djurgårdsbrunn canal. If you follow it all the way out, you will eventually reach Blockhusudden and Thielska Galleriet. There you can quietly enjoy one of Sweden’s foremost art museums, with a unique collection from the turn of the last century featuring works by Edvard Munch and August Strindberg, among others.\n\nWaldemarsudde\n\nAt Waldemarsudde we find the Prins Eugen konstmuseum where you can experience its fantastic art collection, garden and park. Now during this year’s “Spring Flowers in the Park”, our guests will have the opportunity to join the park’s gardener, Marina Rydberg, who will give a tour of the magnificent garden when it is full of spring flowers such as tulips, daffodils and many different kinds of bulbous plants.\n\n5 Cafés you should not miss\n\nRosendals trädgårdskafé\n\nAre you craving for a nice cup of coffee? Then stop by the popular café in Rosendal’s Garden, one of Stockholm’s absolute favourite places to enjoy a good cup of coffee and some homemade bread and pastries in its botanical garden. Because there’s not much that beats a freshly baked cinnamon bun with loved ones in the spring sunshine while listening to the birds chirping in the background.\n\nArthurs Kafé\n\nAt what was until 1938 the central entrance to the open-air museum Skansen, you will now find the newly opened Arturs Kafé. The beautiful Hazelius Gate from 1907 has been carefully renovated and transformed into a Viennese café with a lovely bar and outdoor seating area with an inviting atmosphere that resonates well with the history of the place.\n\nBlå Porten\n\nFor more than a hundred years, tourists and Stockholmers alike have enjoyed classic dishes and pastries in the beautiful surroundings of Blå Porten. A beloved watering hole on Djurgården since 1916 when restaurateur Agnar Meurling opened the summer restaurant with an Italian-inspired garden. Nowadays, Blå Porten is open all year round and invites you to a unique, historic setting where you can enjoy Swedish home cooking and a fantastic coffee table.\n\nCafé Monika Ahlberg\n\nAlong Blockhusudden we find Thielska Gallery’s café, privately run by food creator Monika Ahlberg, who is known for her cookbooks and her previous work at Rosendals Trädgård.\n\nIt serves lunches such as soup with freshly baked bread, sandwiches in several varieties, hot smoked salmon with basil potatoes and rum sauce, country potato dish with cumberland sauce and various salads. There is also always a “Special of the Day” which varies. In addition, many different types of homemade pastries are offered.\n\nIt is also possible to have a glass of wine or beer with your meal. During the summer months, you can take your lunch and snacks out into the sculpture park.\n\nSkroten Café & Skeppshandel\n\nSkroten Café & Skeppshandel is located in a small alley at Nya Djurgårdsvarvet, right next to Beckholmen and Gröna Lund. The café is neighbours with the glittering Baltic Sea, the old workers’ housing and the creaky jetties.\n\nWhat makes the Café so unique is that they offer a wonderfully rustic atmosphere among ship’s lanterns, tamarinds and lifeboats amidst the sweet smell of tar and sea. We highly recommend stopping by for a tasty and well-prepared lunch, a cup of coffee with freshly baked raspberry pie or perhaps a dinner of a hearty fish stew and a glass of wine on their delicious outdoor terrace.\n\nOn April 23, it’s finally time for Stockholm Culture Night 2022.

We’re happy to welcome Vrak – Museum of Wrecks, which will open on the 23 of September. The museum is located at Djurgårdsstrand 17, between the Vasa Museum and Gröna Lund, it lays only a few meters from the water.\n\nVrak is perfect for the curious ones and the history buffs. The museum tells the story of more than 100,000 wrecks that have been found at the bottom of the Baltic Sea. Through immersive film experiences the visitor can move down to the seabed of the Baltic Sea and, among other things, walk along the mythical wreck, “Resande Man”. With the help of digital solutions such as VR dives, archive dives and games the museum manages to bring history to the surface without affecting and disturbing the seabed of the Baltic Sea.\n\nVrak is the Vasa Museum’s new sister museum and is part of the Swedish Maritime and Transport History Museums. Functional architect Paul Hedqvist designed the boat hall for Vrak – the Museum of Wrecks. The building has retained its exterior, but has been given a modern makeover on the inside. Through collaboration with Fahlander architects and construction contractor Serneke, they have carefully rebuilt the boat hall with sustainable materials such as concrete, oak, steel, and glass. They have taken inspiration from the sea, ships, and the seabed to renovate the boat hall into a building where man meet sea. The museum is now nominated for the ROT-award and The Betongpriset for the careful rebuilding.\n\nOn Wednesday 22 September, Vrak will be inaugurated with a visit from the King. If you cannot wait, there is already material on their website, vrak.se. There you can find wreck stories, films about wrecks in the Baltic Sea and much more.\n\nAt Djurgården there are a lot of restaurants offering something very Swedish this time of year, called julbord, or translated into Christmas smorgasbord. It is a kind of collection of what we usually eat in Sweden for Christmas, set up at a table, like a buffet. It is usually very traditional but nowadays it has been more and more popular to switch to a more sustainable julbord with more greens instead of meat for example.\n\nWhat usually is included in the classical julbord is of course the very important Christmas ham. This is the piece of food that the whole table is about! It is usually very big and takes many hours to cook. It lasts for days and is almost always the food you have to keep eating even after Christmas is over just to get rid of it, but you are actually quite tired of the taste by this time.\n\nOther delicious things you can find at a classical julbord at Djurgården is many different kinds of pickled herring with a lot of different tastes and combinations. With that you usually eat boiled potato, boiled and sliced eggs decorated with shrimp, roe and dill. Another very important thing on the table is also the meatballs, the food Sweden is known world wide for, and of course they have to be hand made from scratch!\n\nJanssons Frestelse is also something very important and traditional at the julbord, which is basically like a potato gratin with onion and anchovy. But what do Swedes drink to their beloved Christmas food you might think? Usually special Christmas beer, wine or julmust, which is a type of soda that looks a lot like Coke, but with a specific sweet taste hard to describe, you just need to try it! For dessert it is common to drink some snaps or some kind of avec with the coffee.\n\nThe dessert at the julbord usually consists of a lot of different small sweets and mostly with chocolate or fruits as a base, in many shapes and combinations. Rice pudding is also common in different styles, and typical Christmas flavors for all these sweets are cinnamon, citrus, saffron, ginger and mint, among others.\n\nThe more sustainable and modern julbord has become more popular over the past time and many of our restaurants here at Djurgården are embracing the alternative way of serving delicious, healthier variations of the classical julbord, which is better for the environment.\n\nIf you want to visit Djurgården before Christmas and try out any of the traditional or modern julbord, you have a lot of options to choose from. Try for example the julbord at Gröna Lunds Tyrolen, at Oaxen, The Museum of Spirits or The Viking Museum. You can also find julbord at Hotel Hasselbacken, Villa Godthem, Villa Källhagen, Ulla Winbladh and Rosendals Wärdshus.\n\nDuring the fall season Djurgården is beautiful in so many ways, with the leaves changing color, crisp fresh air and the sharp light on sunny days. Another beautiful thing you can see on the island is all the art we have in our different galleries! We have plenty to discover, and whether you want to spend one or several days you can create your own art tour at Djurgården with a few recommendations from us.\n\nDjurgården offers everything from The future of food and drinks at The Museum of Spirits to a look into the life in the Arctic at the Nordic Museum and everything in between. For those interested in magnificent paintings from the 20th century we recommend the Thiel Gallery and Prince Eugen’s Waldemarsudde. And don’t miss out on all the beautiful monuments at Djurgården!\n\nTake a refreshing walk, or why not explore Djurgården by bike! There are so many things to see along the way. For example several monuments and memorials. Our suggestion for an art tour at Djurgården is that you start at the Thiel Gallery which you’ll find furthest away on the island, and then head back towards the Djurgården Bridge. Along the way you can visit Waldemarsudde, then Liljevalchs, afterwards the Museum of Spirits which is located almost next door, before you finish the tour at the Nordic Museum.\n\n(You can read about the exhibitions and events down here.)\n\nOur best tips for an art tour at Djurgården\n\nThielska Galleriet – The hidden gem at Djurgården\n\nThe Thiel Gallery was built for the magnificent art collection of the businessman Ernest Thiel and was finished in 1907 in a magical building in Art Nouveau-style. Here art lovers are invited to enjoy a unique collection with everything from Eugen Jansson to August Strindberg. At the moment they have an exhibition about Karin Frostenson with works from 1960-2018. The exhibition is a mix of old photographs, satire and references from advertising.\n\nWaldemarsudde – Swedish cultural heritage\n\nAt Prince Eugen’s old home at Waldemarsudde visitors can enjoy his extensive art collection with several of the prince’s own creations which you can experience all year round. You will also find artworks from Carl Larsson and the international star Anders Zorn, among others. The collection consists of about 700 pieces and includes visual arts, sculptures and craftsmanship. Right now there is an ongoing exhibition about Edward Burne-Jones which is the first ever monographic exhibition by him shown in Scandinavia. The presentation includes fascinating paintings, textiles and drawings and reveals his influence of Scandinavian art and design. This is definitely an opportunity for the Swedish public to discover this eminent Pre-Raphaelite artist.\n\nLiljevalchs – Contemporary Art and design in a beautiful setting\n\nLiljevalchs is welcoming everyone regardless of your level of artistic interests. They have four different exhibitions all year around. At the moment they have their major fall exhibition by Helene Billgren – “All clear”, which is a survey of her work and includes the objects and drawings from the 1980s and 1990s to the increasingly color-intense paintings of the 2000s.\n\nMuseum of Spirits – Exhibition consisting of swing-ticket tags\n\nArtist Angus Fairhurst belonged to an influential generation which became a phenomena known as Young British Artists or YBAs. The early 1990s was a period of economic crisis and the YBAs made a sensational splash with an attitude at once countercultural and market-driven. Fairhurst was a central figure during this brash and innovative era, but unlike many in his generation of art graduates from Goldsmiths’ College in London, he avoided the obviously provocative and shocking. The exhibition at the Museum of Spirits is an Absolut Art Collection including Angus Fairhurst from 1994. The pieces consists of a thicket of blue, red and black swing-ticket tags formating the shape of an Absolut Vodka bottle. These tiny straps are used in clothes shops everywhere to attach price tags onto clothes – here, they are the core material of a work of art.\n\nThe Nordic Museum – Take a look inside the Arctic\n\nThe Nordic Museum is Sweden’s greatest museum of cultural history. Here you can experience different parts of the Nordic way of life and culture. They have everything from a 1940s apartment to Nordic lights and traditions, about the celebrations and festivities throughout life. A new and big exhibitions is “Arctic – While the ice is melting” which allows you to meet people from some of the coldest places on earth. Where the living conditions and environment are changing at a rapid pace.\n\nIn late winter 2016/early spring 2017, 101 trout were born at Djurgården at the old aquarium. They have since moved to the Baltic Sea Science Center at Skansen, and now they are moving out with the help of Magnus Carlsson from the indie rock group Weeping Willows.\n\nYou can join in too!\n\nCome and see Skansen’s trouts being released from the protected bay below the Scanian mine on Sunday 8th September at 10:00. One of the people helping out is Magnus Carlsson from Weeping Willows, who is committed to protecting and preserving the Baltic Sea.\n\nBrown trout (Salmo trutta)\n\nThe trouts being released by Skansen were bred artificially. The mature fish were collected and had spawn and milk taken from them before being released back into the water. The eggs were then left in an incubator until they were ready to hatch. A newly-hatched trout has a yellow yolk sac on its stomach, which keeps it nourished so that it can survive without needing to hunt. Once the fish has absorbed the yolk sac, it can start to hunt and eat for itself.\n\nBrown trout migrate into freshwater to spawn, laying their eggs and leaving them to hatch there. Their young then return to the sea when they are young adults. Skansen’s trout were born in winter 2016/spring 2017, so are now just over two and a half years old and able to survive well on their own. Releasing 101 trout in one go is a far cry from the number of fish that are released in Sweden each year, but it is unusual for the general public to be able to get as close to the fish as they will do on Sunday. In carrying out this trout stocking, Skansen wants to inform people about the Baltic Sea and its species; the brown trout is an important species for the food chain and humans. Come to Djurgården on Sunday so that you don’t miss this unique opportunity!\n\nPhoto: S Beskow/Azote Källa: havet.nu\n\nSkansen’s trout stocking encourages further protection and restoration of ecosystems through action and education (14.2)\n\nIf youwant to read moreaboutourworkwithsustainability, visit sustainable.royaldjurgarden.se/en\n\nDjurgården is a place that should be accessible to everyone. The ‘St Julian prize’ (S:t Julianpriset) is awarded by the City of Stockholm and rewards work that helps to include people with disabilities in society. The prize has previously been awarded to the Vasa museum, Gröna Lund and Skansen, and now Tekniska museet has become the latest Royal Djurgården winner, in recognition of the museum’s wonderful work to make the museum accessible to more visitors.\n\nTekniska museet has been investing in accessibility for several years now, and has made improvements in ensuring access for all visitors, including those with physical impairments and intellectual disabilities. As well as installing new ramps and lifts, the museum has made its exhibitions and website more accessible and adjusted its opening hours and capacity.\n\nMegaMind\n\nThe main attraction that attracted attention for the St Julian prize is MegaMind. In the exhibition, visitors learn through testing, touching, moving, experimenting and exploring – accessibility was a key feature of the exhibition right from the word go. Through the MegaMind function, the museum has also been able to offer visiting hours where there are fewer visitors and more educators.\n\nInformation\n\nA key issue on the topic of accessibility is how visitors access information and that there should be a variety of ways of doing so. Tekniska museet has information available for those who want to access information through detailed information, moving objects, visuals and other mediums. MegaMind has a system whereby visitors can choose how they receive information.\n\nThe St Julian prize (S:t Julianpriset)\n\nThe St Julian prize is given out every year and recognises companies, activities and organisations that actively work to make sure that everyone – regardless of their functional ability – can participate equally in society.\n\nTekniska museet won the prize in the ‘Access to information and communication’ category. “The MegaMind exhibition has a fully inclusive approach in its design”, the judges said. “Nobody should be excluded; everybody should be able to participate. The future of technology is the focus for the museum, which includes making information and communication available to everyone. By involving experts, researchers and reference groups, they’ve brought in a wide range of expertise. Their work sets a good example to others”.\n\nThe MegaMind exhibition is a good example of how you can ensure accessibility and inclusion (10.3)\n\nIf youwant to read moreaboutourworkwithsustainability, visit sustainable.royaldjurgarden.se/en/home-en"
