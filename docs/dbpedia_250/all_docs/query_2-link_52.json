        "text": "The label «People’s home» coined by Swedish Social-Democrats expresses the first step towards the 1930s, 40s and early 50s, which would make Sweden a model for war-ravaged Europe. But “people” and “home” attracted planners, architects, co-operatives and politicians well before. The aim is to trace the origins of their social concerns in first initiatives of land policies and mass-housing by discussing spatial experiments with housing districts on Stockholm’s fringe in the 1910s and 20s. The attention here goes to two valuable examples: Röda Bergen (1909- 1929) and Vasastaden (1913-1924) situated in two nearby North-West hilly sites of Stockholm.\n\nThe emergence of the sustainable development concept at the end of the 1980s triggered the intensification of the environmental sustainability discourse in urban design and planning. The vision of sustainable urbanism includes calls for limitations to urban growth, protection of sensitive areas, compact design, clean forms of transportation, low- impact building construction, use of renewable resources, and healthy agreeable living environments. While there is growing agreement on the necessity of making sure that new developments comply with these mandates, there is less to say about how to do so. This thesis explores the planning processes underlying three new neighborhood developments in Sweden and Germany broadly regarded as exemplary green developments. I find that the implementation of the sustainable urbanism vision was possible through a municipality-led process with direct control of the land use, built form, and resource supply through legally binding instruments such as detailed plans and development contracts; the consistent build-up of technical capacity in both the public and private sector; and an openness to learning and adaptation. The findings confirm that local government authority in Sweden and Germany still largely reflects the notion of the benevolent state, and suggest that such a role is important for the endorsement of the value-laden notion of sustainability. Transferability of the lessons in the US context depends on the creativity of solutions that will need to tap on latent potential in the public and private sector and research institutes.\n\nThis study investigates maps and town-views of two port towns, Stockholm and Ottoman Thessaloniki, in the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. These four centuries of early modern era are very important for the history of these ports and the historical changes made in this period affected the cartographic image of both cities. The first major aim of this thesis is to examine the maps and town-views as sources for how these two cities were viewed spatially and schematically in the past. The second aim of the thesis is to explore the evolution of these two cities, using the comparative dimension to highlight both similarities and unique features, and again relying on maps and town-views as the major source. The fact that both cities were ports with important roles in early modern empires (the Swedish Empire and the Ottoman Empire respectively), means they offer much scope for comparison. Defense, religious and financial use of places and buildings and the presence of minorities in streets and neighborhoods will get special attention at several points in this thesis."
