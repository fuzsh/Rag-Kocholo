        "text": "MADISON, Wis. - Forward Madison FC today announced the addition of center forward Jeremiah Streng on a season-long loan deal from Finnish Veikkausliiga side SJK Seinäjoki.\n\n“We are excited to be adding a player of Jeremiah’s caliber to our group,” Forward Madison Head Coach and Technical Director Matt Glaeser said. “He has first-tier experience in Europe and is young and hungry to prove himself and continue his development. He is big, strong and clean in front of goal. We anticipate him having a major impact on our team this season.”\n\nStreng began his international and club career in 2017 when the then 15-year-old was called up to the Finnish U-16 national team and later signed his first professional deal with his hometown Vasa IFK of the Finnish third division.\n\nFrom VIFK, Streng would make the move to the SJK organization, where he made 62 appearances, scored 24 goals and dished out five assists between the first and second team. In 2021, Streng also made brief loan stints with Helsinki IFK and FF Jaro.\n\nDuring Streng’s young career, he has played in 27 Veikkausliiga (Finnish first division) matches, 35 Ykkönen (Finnish second division) matches with 17 goals, and in the Kakkonen (Finnish third division), Streng appeared in 42 games and scored 16 goals.\n\nA current member of the Finland U-20 national team, the 20-year-old forward has made 22 appearances within the Huuhkajat’s youth ranks, from U-16 to U-20, scoring four goals across all competitions."
