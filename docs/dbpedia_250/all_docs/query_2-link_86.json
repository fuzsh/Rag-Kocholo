For other uses, see Skåne (disambiguation) and Scania (disambiguation).\n\nScania ( SKAN-ee-ə), also known by its native name of Skåne[3] (Swedish: [ˈskôːnɛ] ⓘ), is the southernmost of the historical provinces (landskap) of Sweden. Located in the south tip of the geographical region of Götaland, the province is roughly conterminous with Skåne County, created in 1997. Like the other historical provinces of Sweden, Scania still features in colloquial speech and in cultural references, and can therefore not be regarded as an archaic concept. Within Scania there are 33 municipalities that are autonomous within the Skåne Regional Council. Scania's largest city, Malmö, is the third-largest city in Sweden, as well as the fifth-largest in Scandinavia.\n\nQuick Facts Skåne, Country ...\n\nClose\n\nTo the north, Scania borders the former provinces of Halland and Småland, to the northeast Blekinge, to the east and south the Baltic Sea, and to the west Öresund. Since 2000, a road and railway bridge, the Öresund Bridge,[4] bridges the Sound and connects Scania with Denmark. Scania forms part of the transnational Øresund Region.[5]\n\nFrom north to south Scania is around 130 km; it covers less than 3% of Sweden's total area.[6] The population of over 1,418,000.[7] It represents 13% of the country's population. With 121 inhabitants per square kilometre (310/sq mi) Scania is the second-most densely populated province of Sweden."
