Printer’s and publisher’s marks were applied to books by the thou­ sands not only to authenticate their provenance from a particular printer or publisher, but also to say something about the self-image, the beliefs and the cultural affinities of those printers and publishers. The realization that the study of the printer’s mark is still a widely open field is not new, however. Nearly a century ago the eminent German book historian Ludwig Volkmann (1870–1947) in an appendix to his Bilderschriften der Renaissance. Hieroglyphik und Emblematik in ihren Beziehungen und Fortwirkungen (Leipzig 1923), called the maker’s marks that Early Modern printers and publishers used to place in their books a “special area of research [...] about which it had occasionally been noticed correctly – and then usually with regard to specific cases – that they were deeply and frequently influenced by the hieroglyphs and the emblems of the Renaissance, but which, strangely enough, had not yet been dealt with in a coherent manner” (p. 118). In the intervening decades a considerable amount of scholarly work on the Early Modern printer’s mark has indeed been undertaken. But as yet research on the Early Modern printer’s mark has not progressed nearly as much as, for example, that on the Early Modern emblem.1 The principal focus of that research so far has been on cataloguing the immensely varied corpus of the Early Modern printer’s mark along national lines.2 Another line of research involved tracing the provenance, the intended\n\n1 A recent survey of research may be found in “Printers’ Marks in Scholarly Research – Overview and Questions.” In: Researching and Recording Printers’ Devices.

We have also come to know a good deal about the cultural, social and economic backgrounds of that production. Mapping the corpus of printer’s marks bibliographically along national lines, and tracing the history of certain strands of that corpus are undoubtedly important and rewarding ways of dealing with that corpus “in a coherent manner”. But they are not the only ones worth undertaking. There are also questions of genre to be tackled, questions, that is, which focus on the possible affinity of the Early Modern printer’s mark with other word-image genres that were productive during the same period: what exactly were the relations, both generic and historical ones, between the Early Modern printer’s mark and the Renaissance hieroglyph, the device, the emblem, the aenigma, and the reverse of the medal? Can the printer’s mark be added to these as one more species of the genus of the symbolum, to use Early Modern terminology? Where, in other words, is its proper place in the vast field of Early Modern bi-medial art forms? The place of the Early Modern printer’s mark among these word-image genres, both as far as their shared and/or divergent poetics and their mutual influences are concerned, is still waiting to be studied in detail. And while the corpus of Early Modern printer’s marks is successfully being catalogued along national lines, the fact that the national corpora mapped by these catalogu­ ing endeavors often comprise all sorts of variants of printer’s marks so far has not prompted any systematic efforts at defining and classifying those variants as so many sub-genres of the printer’s mark. The principal reasons for lacunae such as these may be traced to the fact that printer’s marks, to the extent that they have been recognized as an art form in its own right, to date have been dealt with as primarily belonging to the domain of Book Studies. Devices, Renaissance hieroglyphs and emblems, by contrast, have been viewed as belonging to the domains of literary and art history, and consequently been studied by scholars active in those fields. The joint references to devices, emblems, hieroglyphs and printer’s marks, which one occasionally encounters in Early Modern texts suggests that the division of labor epitomized by modern scholarly concerns with various Early Modern word-image genres would not have been familiar or ­plausible by the producers and users of those genres. The specially commissioned chapters of this book aim to shed light on the Early Modern printer’s mark from the perspectives of book history, literary history and art\n\n3 E. g.

It is intended as a first attempt at exploring the pos­ sibility of starting a dialogue between those disciplines on their findings about the printer’s mark in relation to the other species of that genus. Despite the impressive results produced to date by research on the Early Modern printer’s mark – we have tried to record them in the research bibliography at the end of the volume, undoubt­ edly without being able to achieve completeness – research on a European level is still in the beginnings. Due to the dominant tendency to approach the printer’s mark along country-specific lines there are notable differences in the state cataloguing has reached in different European countries. Thus the corpora of Central European prin­ ter’s marks are better accounted for bibliographically than those of countries in the periphery, and those of the sixteenth century better than those from later periods. Attempts at taking in several countries at a glance are rare indeed. And only very occasionally have the beginnings of the printer’s mark or its place among the other Early Modern bi-medial arts forms been studied in detail. For the authors of the chap­ ters of this volume that meant that they could only occasionally fall back on previous research. More often they had to undertake explorative sallies into little known terri­ tory, at times staking out new fields of study. Typographorum Emblemata addresses issues such as that of the adoption of printer’s devices in the place of the older printer’s marks reminiscent of medieval maker’s marks as a symptom of the changing self-image of the representatives of the Early Modern printing profession, the influence of the device and the emblem on the development from the early printer’s mark to the “Humanist” printer’s device, social, religious and economic factors involved in the development of the printer’s mark, pictorial topics of the printer’s mark and their provenance. The volume is subdivided thematically into three sections devoted primarily, but not exclusively, to\n\nA. Beginnings and Provenances: The history of artistic forms has often been told along genealogical lines: A led to B, C merged with D etc. With Early Modern printer’s marks such an approach is bound to run into problems since they not only display great diversity of form and function but are also very heterogeneous as far as their roots and origins are concerned. Hence one of the central presuppo­ sitions underlying this volume: there are many variants of printer’s marks, many beginnings, many origins.\n\nB. Regions and Places (Regional Perspectives on a European Phenomenon): The Early Modern printer’s mark was both a regional and a European phenomenon. On the local level its users, printers and publishers, were agents prominently ­operating within the cities in which their businesses were located. Their produc­ tive and commercial activities reflect the local, social and economic situation,\n\nX\n\nPreface\n\nincluding local conflicts and local hierarchies, bound up in some places with the religious conflicts of the sixteenth century. On a regional level above that of the town they reflect the trading relations established at the time, and the ongoing cultural transfers. To recognize such relations and transfers is particularly impor­ tant in the case of printer’s marks in books in Greek and Hebrew, which, due to the very nature of the cultures they belong to, call for wider horizons. In view of the ease with which the Early Modern printer’s mark was able to cross borders one must therefore aim whenever possible for a vantage point that allows both paying attention to local and regional specifics and taking note of local, regional and European aspects of the genre.\n\nC. Concepts, Historical and Systematic: It is hardly an exaggeration if one claims that to date theoretical research carried out on Early Modern artistic genres has by and large bypassed the printer’s mark. The contributions in this section are meant to undertake a few first steps towards changing that situation by paying close attention to individual aspects of the Early Modern printer’s mark, and by suggesting directions which future research might take: its motto, its pictura, the truth claims connected with some kinds of objects depicted in a printer’s mark, the terms and concepts employed in research on the Early Modern printer’s mark.\n\nA forth section is devoted to a first attempt at a comprehensive – but undoubtedly still far from complete – research bibliography (IV. Research Bibliography: The Early Modern Printer’s Mark in Its Cultural Contexts). The production of a handbook on the Early Modern printer’s mark in the classical sense of that term, needless to say, will have to wait until there is a sufficiently large stock of knowledge, and a sufficiently large set of approaches and research strategies shared by or at least familiar to all scholars active in the field. But the scarcity of common ground that characterizes the present, the absence, that is, of a paradigm shared by book historians, literary historians and art historians studying the Early Modern printer’s mark is not without its positive aspects, asking, as it does, for open­ ness to new questions and for willingness to adopt new perspectives. The various chapters of this volume differ in their choice of regional focus, with special atten­ tion given to the “European periphery” so far too little studied, in their attempts at study­ing the emergence and the developments of the art form of the printer’s mark, in the manner in which they place the printer’s mark in the contexts of contemporary culture, and in the manner in which they identify its linguistic, social, economic and/ or geographic contexts. But we hope that the necessarily polyphonic aspects of our projects will not only be viewed as an avoidable consequence of having undertaken an expedition into a terra parum cognita, but also as a stimulus for follow-up research. The volume will be able to derive some of its coherence, we are confident, from the shared overall topic, the Preface and the Afterword, the bibliography and the indices.\n\nPreface\n\nXI\n\nA project like ours requires patience on the part of the authors and the people supporting it in one way or another, and all of these deserve thanks for having had such patience. For their cooperation and patience we would like to thank, first and foremost, to our colleagues who accepted our invitation to venture into a territory that was and still is only partially known. Poets from Classical Antiquity often praise themselves for having been first in entering new fields. As for ourselves we had to learn that the paths through such new fields can be full of thorns, and that we had to accept the challenge of occasionally having to follow rather untrodden paths. Ursula Rautenberg and Ute Schneider have accepted our volume into their series when it was still only a mere plan, and they have helped us through occasional doubts about the feasibility of our project. For this they deserve our warmest thanks. Claudia Heyer, our editor with our publisher, De Gruyter, has always been generous in ­settling issues concerning more pages, more pictures, more time and Monika Pfleghar has guided us safely through the final production process with as much patience and care as we could wish for. Mirjam Haas has translated several chapters from German into English with great care and with much concern for detail. Ulrike Falkenstein, Johannes ­Fleischer, Aurelia Gumz, Isa Gundlach, Thomas Kaebel, Annemarie Mayer, Felix Seibert and Lara Elisabeth Vogel have been of great help in the editing and indexing of the chapters of this book. A number of libraries have assisted us in track­ ing down rare pictorial materials, some of which are here made accessible through reproductions for the first time. As editors we have learned a lot during the nearly five years that have passed between the first formulation of the project and the finished book. We hope that Typographorum Emblemata will be able to serve as a travel guide and as a handbook for all who wish to find out more about the terra parum cognita of the Early Modern printer’s mark.

The Relationship between Printer’s Marks and Emblems during the First Hundred Years Introduction Printer’s marks and emblems began their career about the same time around 1500. Both art forms combine images and (Latin) texts in an often enigmatic way, both are closely connected to early printing, and both draw on devices, Renaissance hiero­ glyphics, courtly pastime, and the figures and techniques of ars memorativa. Conse­ quently, similarities should hardly be surprising and were, indeed, established early on – this is not least made apparent by the fact that both forms were often summa­ rised under the term symbolum in Latin texts. Research, however, has added a further premise and, from quite early on – whether one starts with Friedrich Roth-Scholtz’s Thesaurus symbolorum ac emblematum (1730), or only with the studies of Praz, Heckscher and others in the middle of the twentieth century – has always acknowledged printer’s marks as the late-born children of the mater emblematica, i. e. as a derived and thus apparently less inter­ esting form – if it acknowledged them at all.1 This categorisation lead to them not being considered in the discussion on the early history of emblematics. Even though, the chronology already suggests that the relationship between both arts resembles, if you will, much less a mother-daughter relationship than a sisterly one in which the printer’s marks then takes on the role of the older sister. Whereas the first emblem book, Alciato’s Emblematum liber, was only printed in 1531, printer’s marks, which, as I will show, share strong similarities in form and contents with the later emblems, were already used in humanist printing and distributed in many 1000 copies in the whole of Europe around 1500. This implies that they were present on the European stage several decades earlier than the emblem books following Alciato’s example. Chronology, sign structure and distribution indicate that printer’s marks played a significant role in the development of the first emblem book and the popularisation of emblematics. The chronologically wrong but also structurally inadequate idea of a onesided historical derivation should rather be replaced by other concepts in\n\n1 Mario Praz (Praz 1964) mentioned only the devices as protoemblematic forms. The very influential article of Heckscher and Wirth 1959 did not list the printer’s marks among the protoemblematics (col. 130 sequ.), but as a kind of applied emblematics (col. 214–215), while they recognised the strong rela­ tionship between both arts. Grimm noticed that some marks were much older than the emblems usu­ ally used to help explaining them, but did not draw any conclusions from this fact (Grimm 1965, 339). DOI 10.1515/9783110430271-001\n\n4\n\nAnja Wolkenhauer\n\nwhich the printer’s mark finds its place as a sister of the emblem, giving and taking in the historical process. Thus, the perspective on the medial landscape of the six­ teenth century changes as well. The noticeable differentiation of multiple bi-medial art forms during this period becomes recognisable as a joint process that is mainly rooted in early printing and its possibilities of printing and distribution. The fact that it is possible to take on this perspective today is not least due to the ever-increacreasing accessibility of the source material. The cataloguing, dating, topographic and semantic recording of printer’s marks is still in its infancy, but has advanced so much in Europe in recent years that the contours slowly become clearer.2 To support the new way of looking at Early Modern media history, which I am pro­ posing, I want to look more closely at the relationship of printer’s marks and emblem art at three crucial moments in their common history: during the period of the origin of the first emblem book as a book of epigrams in the 1520s, during the period of the first printed editions of the Emblemata in the 1530s, when the differences between authorised and unauthorised print editions makes the influence of printer’s marks visible, and during the period of the genre crossings of the second half of the the sixteenth century, when not only a strong approximation of both art forms, but also a long-term shift in the media relationship becomes visible. I recorded initial observa­ tions on this subject in a study nearly 15 years ago to which I will refer in summary in the following.3 My current observations differ in many details and some consequen­ ces from this initial draft, but not in the general outline.\n\nPrinter’s Marks as Inspiration for Alciato’s Epigrams and Their Illustration The awareness that epigrams were originally epitaphs has never quite disappeared over the millennia old history of their genre, so that many famous epigrams show an ekphrastic character.4 The epigrammatic ekphraseis of the Anthologia Graeca have been constantly reformulated in various languages – here only the epigrams on\n\n2 The (especially in Italy) far advanced cataloguing, the well-tried connection of database driven and classical, printed catalogues by Hans Brandhorst and others in the Netherlands (e. g. in van Huisstede & Brandhorst 1999), as well as my own primarily methodologically oriented studies (Wolkenhauer 2002) shall be mentioned here as examples. The currently being printed volume Scheibe and Wolken­ hauer 2015 provides an up-to-date overview. 3 Wolkenhauer 2002. 4 Many pictorial epigrams can be found in the ninth book of the Anthologia Graeca, among them also the poems on the cow of Myron attributed to Leonidas of Tarent (AP 9, 713–742). Still fundamental for the understanding of antique pictorial epigrams is Lausberg 1982.\n\nSisters, or Mother and Daughter?\n\n5\n\nMyron’s bronze cow and on the statue of opportunity (Kairos) shall be mentioned.5 A humanist would most likely have characterised them as easily accessible, highly learned as well as rich in imagery. No wonder, then, that the Milanese lawyer Andrea Alciato (1492–1550), apart from many legal texts, also wrote Latin epigrams, which were Latin adaptations of Greek models from the Anthologia Graeca, as well as his own verses following classical examples. He was not the only one to write such adapta­ tions, but rather one of many, as contemporary collections of epigrams clearly prove.6 Erasmus of Rotterdam, too, included such memorable expressions and image concep­ tions in his widely distributed Adagia.7 What is it then that distinguished Alciato’s epigrams so much from many thou­ sands of similar epigrams, and gave them such a far-reaching influence? It cannot be because of the quality of his poems, which, as a look into the Basle epigram collection of 1529 (see below) makes clear, is good, but not extraordinary – so, in my view, the reason for their popularity has to be found in the just emerging market for the printed book. Andrea Alciato began to write epigrams during his studies – as praetextatus, as he calls it –; they belong to humanist everyday culture.8 Thirty of those early epigrams found their way into a collection of Latin translations from the Anthologia Graeca, published in Basle in 1529, which already included the translation of the Kairos ekphrasis and his Harpocrates epigram to both of which I will return later.9 Others circulated in the 1520s – if at all – exclusively in manuscript form, and only with the Augsburg first edition of 1531 did they reach a somewhat wider public. Alciato must have drawn on further inspirations, apart from the Anthologia Graeca, while working on his epigrams. The innovative connection of epigrams and images makes it plausible to look precisely at the printer’s marks of that time for an impor­\n\n5 For the translation history, see Hutten 1935. 6 See, e. g., the Basle print of 1529, which compiles translations of Erasmus, Morus, Poliziano, ­Alciato, Luscinius et al.: Selecta epigrammata Graeca Latine versa, ex septem Epigrammatum Graecorum libris, accesserunt omnibus omnium prioribus editionibus ac versionibus plus quam quingenta Epigrammata recens versa, ab Andrea Alciato, Ottomaro Luscinio, ac Iano Cornario Zviccaviensi, Basle, Bebel, Aug. 1529.

They were familiar to Alciato, because they were deeply embedded in humanist education as well as the “printing scene”. Many publishers of the time used printer’s marks as trademarks for their products and to make a statement on the quality of their production; ownership, legal and advertising signs here all melt into one, without a clear distinction of these different functions always being possible. In the centres of humanist printing in the early six­ teenth century, printer’s marks were in use which, inspired for example by Aldus’ famous Dolphin-and-Anchor-Signet (1502), combined various multilingual texts in multiple ways with images. As they could be imprinted, if the printer preferred it, into every copy of an edition in a prominent place, they were able to reach a higher rate of distribution than all other art forms of the time. As his correspondence shows, Andrea Alciato stood in close contact with many humanist printers of Northern Italy, France and Upper Germany. Accordingly, he was in lively correspondence with the signet-keeping printers Andreas Cratan­ der, Johann Froben and Johann Bebel already before 1530, and had many works that came from their printer’s offices in his library, as Barni has reconstructed in detail.10 So it can hardly be surprising that Alciato just thought of the printer’s marks of Aldus Manutius and Johann Froben as examples for good insignia, when he mentioned his epigram collection in a letter to his friend Francesco Calvo for the first time in 1523, and noted that the epigrams could serve craftsmen as tem­ plates for scuta and insignia.11 Common to both signets is their underlying bi-medi­ ality, the high level of education they presuppose (ex historia, vel ex rebus naturalibus aliquid elegans), and the possibility of personalisation (anchora Aldi), which Alciato here emphasises explicitly. The structure of Aldus’ Anchor and Froben’s Dove differs quite strongly in regard to the respective media combinations, as I have shown elsewhere.12 Aldus (see Figure 3) translates a text into an image in the\n\n10 Barni 1947; Barni 1953. 11 Andrea Alciato to Francesco Calvo, Mailand, 9. 12. 1522 [recte 9. 1. 1523]: His saturnalibus ut illustri Ambrosio Vicecomiti morem gererem, libellum composui epigrammaton, cui titulum feci Emblemata: singulis enim epigrammatibus aliquid describo, quod ex historia, vel ex rebus naturalibus aliquid elegans significet, unde pictores, aurifices, fusores, id genus conficere possint, quae scuta appellamus et petasis figimus, vel pro insignibus gestamus, qualis Anchora Aldi, Columba Frobenii [...].

This difference seems to be negligible here, more impor­ tant is the fact that Aldus’ Anchor and Froben’s Dove belong to the most famous printer’s marks of the time, so that Alciato could outline them briefly to his corre­ spondent with a single term and could take their popularity for granted. Erasmus of Rotterdam had treated both in his Adagia since 1508, with Festina lente as no. 1001, and Cassioticus nodus as no. 1434, and they were, as his own as well as other contemporary comments show, held in high regard as achievements of humanist education.13 It should be noted that humanist printer’s marks were familiar to Andrea Alciato; he clearly stated this when first talking about his epigrams (1523), and named the above-mentioned printer’s marks, which were both renowned among humanist ­ ­thinkers, as models for the proper usage of his epigrams. Their quite different medial structure, on the other hand, apparently is not worth mentioning to him – concision, figurative nature, educational aspects and medial variability are foregrounded.\n\nThe Typographical Design of Alciato’s Emblem Book The first edition of Alciato’s epigrams, which was unauthorised and later criticised by the author, was published in 1531 by Steyner in Augsburg.14 It combined about 100 epigrams under the previously uncommon title Emblemata, provided with titles and simple woodcuts. This pictorial decoration was unprecedented; contemporary Latin\n\n13 Evidence in Wolkenhauer 2002, 174–180 and 206–210. 14 There are many problems with the 1531 edition; Bernhard Scholz has analysed them lucidly (see Scholz 1991). Frankly put, I assume here that Alciato has written many epigrams in the 1520s, which were partly incorporated into the Basle epigram edition (see note 6). I further believe to be able to show that the templates for the images for Steyner’s unauthorised first edition can hardly origin in Alciato’s work, and assume that the manuscript for the Epigrammata was not illustrated and, thus, assign the authorship of the illustrations to Steyner and his visual artist Jörg Breu. (At least for those epigrams which relate to Aldus Manutius and Erasmus’ adagium 1001, we can be sure that there were no images at all: the faults of Steyner – i. e. separating dolphin and anchor and misunderstanding echineis as a kind of mussel – cannot result from any possible misunderstanding of an image given by Alciato, who, probably, would have simply copied the printer’s mark of Aldus, as he did again later.) With the authorised Paris editions (from 1534), however, I assume that the visual artist Mercure Jollat collaborated with Alciato.\n\n8\n\nAnja Wolkenhauer\n\npoetry collections were not illustrated.15 The combination of epigrams and illustrations is thus, in my view, the really extraordinary thing about the small volume. This, however, is often overlooked as we are dealing with a small-formatted, typographically rather simple printing design, altogether more reminiscent of a chapbook than an Aldine. The criticism Alciato formulated repeatedly after the publication of the edition, however, is not concerned with this unusual combination, quite the opposite: in his early letter to Calvo and the later dedication to Peutinger, he continues to declare the production of templates of images for craftsmen to be the most important function he had in mind for his epigrams.16 Hence, Alciato’s epigrams – continuing a genre con­ vention of epigrammatics – were primarily understood as ekphrastic poetry. Conse­ quently, the editions that were authorised by Alciato and published from 1534 onward by Wechel in Paris also included epigrams and images: in this respect, the author apparently did not see the need for correction. The threefold division of the emblem (inscription, picture, epigramma), which had only been evident semantically in Steyner’s edition, was typographically fixed only in the edition of Wechel: every emblem was placed in isolation at the centre of a single page with the individual parts following a fixed arrangement. The single page turned into the typographical norm of the emblem book – a norm that had nothing to do with the printing of epigrams of the time, but rather with the “typographical staging” of pamphlets, Dances of Death, etc. This is especially true for those printer’s marks of the epoch that were arranged at the end of the book in a media-crossing fashion and separate from the rest of the corpus of the book by many humanist printers, before they were finally integrated into the architecture of the title page in the seventeenth century.17 In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, however, humanist signets often claimed the last page of a printed book for themselves as typographical units, which could include images, texts, marginalia and pieces of decoration, and often giving particular importance to the text positioned above the pictura. Two printer’s marks,\n\n15 Apart from the Selecta epigrammata of 1529 (fn. 9) and Alciato’s authorised collected works from 1546 until 1550, the Poematia aliquot insignia (Basle 1544), and the single editions of Gilbert Cousin (Basle 1547), Julius Caesar Scaliger (Geneva 1574), and Théodore de Bèze (icones and epigrammata, 1548 passim) shall be mentioned here, which do not contain any illustrations other than the printer’s mark. 16 Letter of dedication to Konrad Peutinger, see Alciato, Emblemata, Augsburg: Steyner 1531, fol.

An idea of how Alciato contextu­ alised the epigrams in regard to his other literary works, is offered decades later by the authorised col­ lected works of Alciato, which he edited, together with his friend and student Bonifacius ­Amerbach, in the last years of his life. Here, despite of its success story, the Emblemata is republished as nuda, in a s­ imple layout, two-columned, condensed on 11 pages, withholding the dedicatory i­ntroduction, images and emblematic typography and exclusively features the epigrams.

They combine images and texts that are part of humanist ­education and derive from Classical Antiquity.19 Alciato treated the central motives, the wand of Mercury and Fortuna, in his epigrams as well, which can be taken as an indication of his affiliation to the same cultural context – a direct dependency, however, should not be constructed here.20 But it is above all the typographical lay-out that was to serve\n\n18 Alciato mentions Froben’s signet in his letter to Calvo (cf. fn. 11); Cratander’s books were in his possession (see Barni 1947 and 1953). Here, it always has to be taken into account methodo­ logically – and this makes the work with printer’s marks more difficult – that printer’s marks could change drastically over their career of usage. Texts (mottoes) varied or were temporarily omitted, from printing to printing, from year to year, image details were added or disappeared altogether. Thus, the here depicted printer’s marks are all taken from prints that have been on the market between 1515 and 1530, i. e. before the printing of the first emblem book. 19 For individual sources, cf. Wolkenhauer 2002, 165–185 and 199–224. There is no equivalent depic­ tion of the palma Bebeliana (Figures 9 and 10). 20 The poem on Fortuna/ Kairos belongs to the most famous ekphraseis of the Anthologia Graeca; Alciato did not have to look at Cratander’s signet to remember it, even though his committed text-image-combinations could have accompanied Alciato while writing his epigram in Occasionem. There are no cornucopias in Froben’s signet (Erasmus regrets this in his interpretation as well); the common feature the signet shares with the epigram Virtuti fortuna comes, which forms the basis for\n\n10\n\nAnja Wolkenhauer\n\nas an example. In Froben’s work, two texts – imprint and dedication – as well as the borders support the claim of the signet to take the central position on the page. In both marks various kinds of texts are distinguished by means of font, language and position in the lay-out, and in both cases there is special emphasis on the header. This header consists of quotes from the Bible or the Anthologia Graeca, respectively, and attains the character of a comprehensive title. The typographical staging that the humanist prin­ ters with whom Alciato stood in close connection with chose for their signets served as model for the page layout of the first emblem book. But only the authorised edition oriented itself on this typographical model; it evidently did not play a role for Steyner.\n\nPrinter’s Marks as Inspiration for Andrea Alciato Apart from the qualities of printer’s marks (high level of education, possibility of personalisation) mentioned in Alciato’s letters, bi-mediality and page layout emerge as two further aspects deriving directly from printing practice. For single emblems this relationship can even be described more fully: here, a comparison of Steyner’s unauthorised picturae of 1531 and the authorised picturae of Wechel pub­ lished from 1534 onward can prove itself useful.21 The example of the printer’s mark of Aldus Manutius, which had been distributed in Europe from 1502 onward and named as a model by Alciato himself, is especially instructive. Alciato’s epigram princeps ­subditorum reads: Princeps subditorum incolumitatem procurans Titanii quoties conturbant aequora fratres, Tum miseros nautas anchora iacta iuvat: Hanc pius erga homines Delphin complectitur, imis Tutius ut possit figier illa vadis. Quam decet haec memores gestare insignia Reges, Anchora quod nautis, se populo esse suo. [“The ruler who ensures the well-being of his people // Whenever [the winds], Titan brothers, stir up the waters, then an anchor thrown out brings good fortune to the miserable sailors. The dolphin, devoted to mankind, embraces the anchor so that it can fasten it more securely deep down on the bottom of the sea. How fitting that kings bear this insignia mindful that they are for their people what the anchor is to the sailors.”]\n\nAlciato’s own device, lies mostly in the understanding of Caduceus as a sign that can be referred to rhetorically as well as economically. In later editions of the Emblemata a dove appears, sitting side­ ways on the cornucopia, which really only could have been added in the knowledge of Froben’s signet (see Najera 1615, accessible online: www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/alciato/emblem.php?id=A15a117). Froben’s signet was widely distributed in Spain as well, cf. Wolkenhauer 2003, 298–309. 21 For a comparison of the editions, see www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk.\n\nFigure 3: Printer’s mark of Aldus ­ anutius, from 1502 onward.

The most important informa­ tion about the image can be drawn from the epigram: the philanthropical dolphin embraces the anchor, which the sailors have dropped in the storm, and thus helps them to secure the ship more safely. As the bow wave in front of the animal’s mouth shows, he fights with all his might against the current. The anchor rope leading out of the image on the opposite side reminds us of the desperate men who place their hopes in him. For the authorised edition of the Emblemata (Figure 5), however, Aldus’s printer’s mark definitely serves as template (Figure 3). Aldus Manutius had been using it since 1502 in nearly all of his prints. It was known all over Europe and frequently imitated but without its provenance ever being forgotten: the anchor always remained Aldus’ anchor. The pictura of the Paris edition is so similar to the Aldinian signet – i­ ncluding the pointed beak and acanthus-shaped flippers – that a direct copy can safely be assumed. Narrative details as in Steyner’s version – as, e. g., the anchor rope and the bow wave – are, however, missing entirely. Wechel’s edition, on the other hand, insists on a pictura that imitates a famous printer’s mark accurately and thus features all the characteristics belonging to Renaissance hieroglyphics. I am referring here to the graphic isolation of the signs and the sym­ bolic nature of the representation that connects the Aldinian signet with, e. g., the Hypnerotomachia Polifili.22 At the same time, the narrative aspect loses importance so that the figure of the princeps as well as the context of events can no longer be inferred from the image.\n\n22 For the interdependency, see Wolkenhauer 2002, 34–46.\n\n12\n\nAnja Wolkenhauer\n\nAn adaptation of the pictura from a printer’s signet can also be assumed (even though with a little less certainty) in Alciato’s emblem In silentium. The underlying epigram is already included in the Basle epigram collection of 1529, and thus belongs to Alciato’s earlier texts. It reads: In silentium Cum tacet, haud quicquam differt sapientibus amens, Stultitiae est index linguaque voxque suae. Ergo premat labias, digitoque silentia signet, Et sese Pharium vertat in Harpocratem. [“To silence // When he is silent then the one without wit is barely different from the wise men. Indicators of his ignorance are tongue and voice. Therefore may he press the lips together and give with the finger the sign of silence and change himself into an Egyptian Harpocrates.”]\n\nIn all editions of Alciato, the pictura shows a man in the habit of a scholar who puts the index finger to his lips to signal silence (Figures 7 and 8). The first distich of the epigram writes out Boethius’ proverbial dictum Si tacuisses, philosophus mansisses, which had made him the best-known admonisher of silence. In the second distich, however, Alciato introduces a new, unusual figure: the amens shall not imitate Boethius or the students of Pythagoras (as other humanists had formulated it in adaptations of the Greek epigram AP 10, 98) but the Egyptian god Harpocrates. The figure of Harpocrates is new to his contemporaries. It was virtually unknown in the Middle Ages and has only been traceable as a personification of silence from the sixteenth century onward. The earliest records originate in Basle where he reached a special local importance during those years as Holbein’s (now lost) frescoes for the Basle council hall, the signet of the Basle printer Thomas Wolff, but also several men­ tionings in the circle of Erasmus prove.23 At that time, the Egyptian god evidently also turned into a humanist scholar who now bore his distant heritage only symbolically. Wolff’s Signet (Figure 6) is, to my knowledge, the earliest example for the iconographic “incorporation” of the Egyptian god into the humanistic res publica litterarum. It shows a scholar in typical habit who presses the finger to his lips while leaning against a fragment of a wall. This otherwise functionless element takes up half of the pictorial space and is filled up with a multitude of signs on its narrow side that are inexplicable in the context of the iconography of silence. These quasi-hieroglyphical elements thus introduce an additional Egyptian flavor into a mark that, based on Boethius’ classical dictum si tacuisses, was already building a bridge from the Bible all the way to the Roman\n\n23 Evidence in Wolkenhauer 2002, 255–261.\n\nFigure 6: Printer’s mark of Thomas Wolff, from 1521 onward.\n\nSisters, or Mother and Daughter?\n\nFigure 7: Alciato, Emblemata, Steyner 1531.\n\n13\n\nFigure 8: Alciato, Emblemata, Wechel 1534.\n\nsatirist Juvenal24: the gesture of silence turns into an universal request that covers time and space. Alciato’s allusion to the figure of Harpocrates, little known outside of Basle, but particularly its habitus in the authorised pictura of his Emblemata (Figure 8), suggest a familiarity with the Basle printer’s mark: the side view of the figure, the emphasised profile, the square headdress that is pulled up high, the wide, loosely falling sleeves, the long, shirred cloak under which the shoes just show, connect both iconographically with each other.25 It could be argued that the iconography of the scholar is generally of little significance; the tendency towards “Egyptisation”, however, that Wolff and Alciato perform here, still marks an otherwise inexplicable coincidence. The emblem Obdurandum adversus urgentia provides a final example that shows how complex the connections between early printer’s marks and the Emblemata of Alciato were. Alciato’s epigram initially mentions the method of weighing down palm trees in their growth zone to achieve a larger crown, which was already known in Antiquity. In its second part, it requests a student to gather the palm fruits, regardless of the fact that the climbing of the tree is troublesome, because in the end the one who consistently makes an effort (mens constans) will be rewarded.\n\n24 Wolff’s signet was in usage from 1521 until the death of the printer in 1535. In March 1522, shortly after its initial usage, Wolff printed an edition of Boethius. 25 Here, I do not want to omit that Wolff’s signet includes both, the request for right silence as well as the one for right speech – the different hand gestures are also to be understood in this way. Alciato concentrates the gesture exclusively on the fool who kindly should hold his tongue.\n\n14\n\nAnja Wolkenhauer Obdurandum adversus urgentia Nititur in pondus palma, et consurgit in arcum; Quo magis et premitur, hoc mage tollit onus. Fert et odoratas bellaria dulcia glandes, Queis mensas inter primus habetur honos. I puer et reptans ramis has collige: mentis Qui constantis erit, praemia digna feret. [“One has to fight oppression // The palm tree struggles up against the weight and rises in an arc [i. e.: into the air]; the more it is pressed down, the more it lifts up the weight. The palm tree also carries fragrant fruit, a sweet dessert, much valued at table. Go, boy, and gather it, crawling amidst the branches. He who is of resolute spirit will carry home an appropriate reward.”]\n\nThe epigram does not belong to Alciato’s adaptations of the Anthologia Graeca and cannot be dated exactly. It connects two conceptions of images with each other, the one of the palm tree growing up against oppression and the one of the labori­ ously climbing boy. A printer’s mark of which we know that it was well known to Alciato probably served him as an inspiration for the former: it was included among others in the already frequently cited collected edition of the Latin transla­ tions from the Anthologia Graeca, a work Alciato owned. Not only for Alciato but also for Steyner, the first printer of the Emblemata, the printer’s mark of their col­ league Bebel c­ ertainly did represent a visual point of reference as a comparison of the picturae shows. The Basle printer Johann Bebel had been using a (palm) tree as his mark since 1526, the crown of which is burdened with a weight (Figures 9 and 10).26 Steyner and Jörg Breu, who was commissioned by the former, are following this mark in their composition of the image. The fact that the tree (contrary to Alciato’s suggestion in the text) looks not at all like a palm tree, i. e. that it has short, lancet-shaped leaves, supports the idea that their pictura (Figure 11) refers to the printer’s mark, and is not an immediate narrative realisation of Alciato’s epigram. Moreover, the weight has the same physical measurements as the one in Bebel’s signet and is positioned in the same way in the middle of the sheet- and tree-centre, which causes some branches to rise up into the air before and others behind it. Accordingly, Steyner’s pictura could be described as a revisualisation of an ekphrasis whose original inspiration – Bebel’s signet image – was known and thus here determined the conception of the image within the emblem.27\n\n26 During the first years of its usage, the palma Bebeliana is still complemented with a representa­ tion of a human in the tree, which is pushed down by the weight. In the spring of 1531 – a closer dating is unfortunately impossible – the human disappears, only tree and weight remain. The motto “Ver­ druck mich armen nit” [“Don’t crush me, poor thing”] which appears in some works (e. g. in Heitz and Bernoulli 1984, 113; Grimm 1965, 131) seems to me to be a singular handwritten addition; up-to-date, it has not been possible to establish a corresponding print. 27 For the term of revisualisation, see the contribution of A. Bässler in this volume (p. 40 ff.).\n\nSisters, or Mother and Daughter?\n\n15\n\nThe authorised edition of Alciato’s Emblemata took a different path. Even though Alciato knew Bebel’s printer’s mark, he chose to ignore the first ekphrasis, which followed the printer’s mark and chose the second one, formulated in the last distich. Thus, the pictura does not show the weight pressing down on the tree, but a boy who, in his endeavor to climb and harvest the tree, seems to be kicking the air.28 Alcia­ to’s decision can be understood as the attempt to now leave the starting point of his epigram, the printer’s mark, behind him and, starting from the second image of his ekphrastic epigram – as in an ever turning spiral – to reach a new pictura. This proce­ dure could be continued endlessly: starting from the new pictura a new epigram can be obtained, which then again takes up at least one more, new motif and again leads to a new picturae etc. Thus, the emblem as an art form that combines different media and the emblem book with its characteristic typography can be traced back to two different early lineages of the printing of the Emblemata. While the addition of woodcuts to the epigrams is due to Steyner and Breu, Wechel, Alciato and Jollat are responsible for the typographical arrangement, for adjusting the word-image relation in many re­spects, and for bringing Renaissance hieroglyphics into play as an important point of reference. Whereas the addition of woodcuts to the epigrams has to be attributed to the edition of Steyner and Breu, the edition of Wechel, Alciato and Jollat can be held responsible for having established the typographical fixation, having revised the text-image-relationship in many details, and having defined the Renaissance hieroglyphics, following the example of Aldus Manutius, as an important point of ­reference. Both printers were familiar with the printer’s marks of various other col­ leagues, but while we have to assume that Steyner took unauthorised decisions (which still, however, seem to agree with Alciato’s ideas of utilisation), Wechel pub­lished his edition with the consent and support of Alciato and remained in close contact with the author later on. All three signet examples presented here date from the first 30 years of the six­ teenth century; thus, they prepared the ground on which Alciato’s book-style emblem­ atics could develop and be appreciated by a readership that was already ­familiar with the relevant word-image conventions. Our sample analyses, however, do not yield a coherent picture: whereas Aldus’ mark is named by Alciato as a model and explicitly introduced in the authorised version, Wolff’s mark mostly seems to convey the motif of a humanist “neiconografia” (Wittkower). Bebel’s signet was taken up\n\n28 This pictura becomes more incomprehensible with each new edition as the row of examples pro­ vided by the Glasgow edition vividly illustrates (www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/alciato/index.php). Later, it was revised as a purely educational emblem – now already by other emblem authors –, complemented with inscriptiones such as studiorum contentio and ardua quae pulchra as well as tree ­climbers who actually climbed up the tree (e. g. Aneau (1552), no. 95 and Schoonhovius (1618), no. 74; both in Henkel & Schöne 1976, 197–198).\n\n16\n\nAnja Wolkenhauer\n\nFigures 9 and 10: Printer’s mark of Johann Bebel (from ca. 1526 and March 1531 onward, respectively) Illustration taken from: Selecta Epigrammata, Basel 1529, cf. fn. 14.

In view of the wide distribution of Alciato’s little book, and its many ­imitators, that is only what was to be expected. I will therefore refer to this issue briefly. During these decades, it is difficult to determine the giving and the taking side; rather both, emblems as well as signets, seem to swim side by side in an anima­ ted exchange in the broad stream of word-image art forms.30 Both have their origin in Latin-influenced humanist culture, which is only slowly complemented by vernacu­ lar mottoes and emblem translations. Both are driven by the interest in education of the time, but even more by the interest of the printers in appealing as well as cost-ef­ fective illustrations. Exemplary of a critical engagement with Alciato is the signet of the Strasbourg humanist printer Wendelin Rihel, which belongs to the earliest ones avowedly reacting to the Emblemata (Figure 14).31 It was first used in 1537, six years after the first printing of the Emblemata. The printer’s mark refers to the emblem nec verbo nec facto (Figure 13) whose pictura depicts a personification of Nemesis, a goddess supposed to be measure and guiding principle for all decisions – this is also the way in which the epigram in the Anthologia Graeca formulates it, to which both, Alciato as well as Rihel, refer. Alciato’s figure carries a bridle in one hand while she clasps her elbow with the other. Rihel, by contrast, corrects Alciato’s iconography and introduces a different reading of the Greek epigram: departing from Alciato’s reading, who translates πῆχυς/cubitum as “forearm” and thus depicts his Nemesis with a unique position of the arm (which was only corrected decades later in the edition of C. Mignault, Antwerp 1577), Rihel’s Nemesis holds up the measuring instrument, i. e. the cubit, with an explicit pointing gesture and together with the bridle: his pictura represents a humanist correction of Alciato’s. On the other hand, he evidently takes over Alciato’s reduction of the mottoes to a single distich that is\n\n29 See the contribution of A. Bässler in this volume for the term (p. 40 ff.). 30 The influence of Erasmus’ widely distributed Adagia should not to be neglected here, which, even though never illustrated itself, had a great, though often unnoticed, influence on producers and recipients of emblematic art through the high number of image descriptions embedded into the text as well as its wide distribution. 31 More detailed in Wolkenhauer 2002, 62–63 and 358–366 (with ill.).\n\n18\n\nAnja Wolkenhauer\n\nnow positioned on its own and beneath the pictura – an otherwise unconventional mode of representation. No other printer’s mark of this generation is so similar to a “classical” emblem. Other printers copy Alciato’s picturae, as for example Johann von Aich in Cologne (Figure 16), but rearrange the texts. Von Aich resorts to the unauthorised edition of Steyner (Figure 15)32 for the design of his printer’s mark, he took a motif from the epigram (Ganymede on the eagle), copied the corresponding picture, but contextua­ lised it in a new way – whereas the homoerotic relationship between Ganymede and Jupiter is at the centre of attention in Alciato’s epigram and only ‘spiritualised’ in the final distich, Johann von Aich chose a clearly marked quotation from the psalms for the motto. Thus, his Ganymede unambiguously turns into an allegory for the ­Christian anima. The broader the stream of word-image art forms flows in the sixteenth century, the harder it gets to determine exclusive relationships. The printers are aware of the printer’s marks of many colleagues as well as Alciato’s small work. They use different editions of his work side by side, so that the focus of the creative process lies less on the finding than on the recombination of texts and images. Successive shifts emerge in the media combination in the printer’s marks, resulting in the reduction of the wealth of detail of the images, and in the total disappearance of many texts: the prin­ ter’s marks lose their bi-mediality.33 Finally, a phenomenon shall be described here, which was to be expected in regard to the already mentioned broad stream, but still offers the possibility of drawing further conclusions.\n\nThe Infinite Spiral: Printer’s Marks Become Emblems Printer’s marks have not only influenced the emergence of emblematics as an art form among the first generation of emblem writers, only to be influenced in return by emblems, but the interplay between the two was lasting; and so it should not be surprising that an emblem book printed at the end of the sixteenth century did not only adopt other emblems and devices, as had been noticed many times, but most of all also printer’s marks that were epigrammatically complemented and thus became three-part emblems.\n\n32 This has already been noted by Grimm 1965, 339. 33 See also Wolkenhauer 2015.\n\nSisters, or Mother and Daughter?\n\nFigure 13: Alciato, Emblemata, Wechel 1534.\n\nFigure 14: Printer’s mark of Wendelin Rihel, from 1537 onward.\n\nFigure 15: Alciato, Emblemata, Steyner 1531.\n\nFigure 16: Printer’s mark of Johann von Aich, from 1543 onward.\n\n19\n\nIn the years of 1611 and 1613 the Nucleus emblematum was published in Arnhem, Cologne and Utrecht combining altogether 200 emblems in two volumes; even more were planned. Visual and text artists appear side by side on the engraved title page, and both preface the work with a Latin text of their own. The work biography of the visual artist on the one hand, and the dedication of the humanist on the other, suggest that the underlying graphic collection, the concept and the page layout can be attributed to Crispin de Passe the Elder (1564–1637), while Gabriel Rollenhagen the Younger (1583–1619), an outstanding epigrammatist in his own right, wrote the\n\n20\n\nAnja Wolkenhauer\n\nepigrams.34 The Arcus Cupidinis, an emblematic “predecessor”, which can be attribu­ ted exclusively to Crispin de Passe, however, already shows the characteristic revival of the motto within the epigram. Beyond that, the way in which the two men collabo­ rated is difficult to reconstruct.35 While the epigrams have only aroused little interest to date,36 templates for the picturae have been identified repeatedly. Among them are Alciato’s Emblemata as well as later emblem books (Aneau, Sambucus, Junius, Camerarius), works of devices (Paradin, Ruscelli), and hieroglyphic literature (Horapollon).37 Even though they often have to be revised in individual cases, these attributions are surely correct in general. This is certainly true of the printer’s marks, which often served as models but have not yet been taken into consideration in the re­­ search on the nucleus. The most likely explanation of this complete disregard may be that printer’s marks, in contrast to the already mentioned emblem books, have never been collected in compendia like Henkel and Schöne or Tung, and are there­ fore less easily accessible.38 But already on a first review, one has to realise that printer’s marks even surpass the biggest source group named by Veldman and Klein.39 Crispin de Passe has chosen a whole range of printer’s marks as templates for his picturae, which appear occasionally in the first and in rapid succession in the second volume.40\n\n34 Gabriel Rollenhagen, Nucleus emblematum selectissimorum [...], Arnhem and Cologne 1611; Selectorum emblematum centuria secunda, Utrecht 1613. Many emblems from this work have been repro­ duced in Henkel & Schöne 1976; additionally, a reprint commented by Carsten-Peter Warncke exists, whose versions of the epigrams, however, are not always reliable (Warncke 1983). The ÖNB Vienna offers a digital reproduction online: data.onb.ac.at/ABO/%2BZ15511070X. Veldman and Klein 2003, 267–299 offer the best analysis; Peil 1992 looks at the structure of the single emblems as well. 35 Warncke 1983, 426–427 attributes the selection of images to de Passe, while the epigrams, with which the engraver supposedly felt overwhelmed, were left to Rollenhagen. He does not say anything about the motto and the page layout. Veldman and Klein 2003 assume that de Passe had enough knowledge of Latin to write the introduction himself and also do not little appreciate his Arcus Cupidinis (p. 270–272). They point out that many details – the medallion shape, the close interplay of image and text, the brevitas – are already traceable in the works preceding them. It seems to me that de Passe in his introduction and Rollenhagen in his dedicatory letter do not always use the same terminology to the effect that sometimes also the epigrams by themselves are called emblemata. 36 Tung 2014, 361–380, who is, however, primarily interested in language technique and the conse­ quences of the revival of the motto within the epigram, is an exception from this. 37 Warncke 1983; Tung 2014 passim. 38 Henkel & Schöne 1976. 39 Veldman and Klein 2003 name Paradin’s Devices as most important source to which 14 emblems can be traced back; the printer’s marks, however, do already outnumber this figure in my first, still very rough overview (Wolkenhauer 2002, 66–67). 40 I assume that de Passe compiled a collection of pictures first, which resembled his later albums. He then made selections from this album. If this assumption holds true, his copperplate emblems can\n\nSisters, or Mother and Daughter?\n\n21\n\nThe Nucleus emblematum distinguishes itself from other contemporary emblem books by being engraved in copper throughout. This offers not only the possibility of a much more detailed representation than in woodcut, but also knits together the media of text and image more closely than before: all is printed from a single plate. It is this novel typographical design Crispin de Passe refers to when he emphasises the parerga non invenusta.41 It manifests itself particularly in the medallion-like concept of the picturae, in the rendition of the inscriptiones as circumscriptions, and the frequent change of font as well as in the many decorative lines, which partition and structure the emblem. These draw the attention of the reader to the printing process and the page layout, which comes into focus as the third constitutive element next to text and image. Crispin de Passe creates a highly artificial form of the unified, three-parted emblem, filled with various intra-paginal references (i. e. visual, typographical and textual reference structures within the printed page). How can his dealing with prin­ ter’s marks be described in those instances in which they serve as template for him? Roughly, two groups can be distinguished: one in which he adopted pictura and motto/ inscriptio, and a second one in which only the pictura was adopted. This could be based on a purposeful selection that concentrates on the image alone, but it is as least as likely that de Passe often came across signets without text in his search: whether the mottoes had been removed during cutting (as can often be observed in the preserved single-sheet collections) and thus the printer’s marks entered his col­ lection as monomedial images, or whether he came across signets which had in fact possessed mottoes in the early days of their usage, but, at the end of the century, only lived on their “memorised bi-mediality” (i. e. the temporarily continued existence of the motto in the memory of the audience) and appeared as monomedial signs: the share of the mottoes in the printer’s marks has declined successively since the middle of the sixteenth century. The motto clearly gained in importance within the emblem in the case of those printer’s marks from which de Passe took over the pictura as well as the motto, as he isolated it and turned it into the inscriptio. Rollenhagen took up the motto again in his distich with only minor syntactical changes, based on the model of the Arcus Cupidinis, and de Passe for his part made sure that this interplay did remain clearly visible for each recipient in a change of font as well. The double specification of inscriptio\n\nsimultaneously be understood as a reference to the oldest reconstructable signet collection (probably within a larger graphic printing collection). 41 Figuras enim non in lignum, ut illi [indicated are the early authors of emblem books] sed in aes incisas damus, nec nudas, sed parergis non invenustis exornatas. Versus pauci sunt, sed apti, perspicui, rotundi [“We do not give the images/picturae in woodcut as other makers of emblem books do, but in copperplate engraving and we do also not give them nude, but adorned with not quite unhandsome accessories. The verses are few/ brief, but fitting, comprehensive and well-formed.”] P. 21/fol. A4 in the digitalised edition of the ÖNB Vienna (cf. fn. 42). The introduction is not signed; as Rollenhagen is here addressed as a friend, I do believe Crispin de Passe to be its author.\n\n22\n\nAnja Wolkenhauer\n\nand pictura, in connection with the claim to brevitas and perspicuitas, brevity and clarity, does only leave little freedom for epigram poetry. Following the emblematic tradition, Rollenhagen rather aims at a generally formulated, moral statement, while the individual and economical aspects of the printer’s marks cannot expect to raise any interest here. In those cases in which only the pictura was adopted the guiding specifications were fewer and the freedom greater. Two examples may serve to illus­ trate Rollenhagen’s procedure that emblematised the printer’s marks without com­ pletely suppressing their origin. As mentioned in the beginning, Andrea Alciato named the printer’s mark of Johann Froben as a model and an example for the utilisation for his ekphrastic epigrams. The printer’s mark was used over decades in Froben’s printer’s office, and underwent only minimal changes. In the process, the mottoes, as in other printer’s marks, were typeset less often in the course of time. The motto Prudens simplicitas, amorque recti that was taken up by de Passe, a mixed quotation from two verses of Martial, has ­appeared ­occasionally since its initial usage in 1515, and was also referred to explicitly as connect­­ed with Froben by Erasmus in his interpretation of the signet: “Froben, who always held up the staff upright, and had nothing but the general interest in view, who did not deviate from the dove-like simplicity and who expressed the wisdom of the snake rather in his signets than his deeds, he is richer in glory than in money.”42 That the pictura of de Passe represents an exact copy of the printer’s mark (see Figures 17 and 18) is evident; even more so, as the most striking difference between them, the crowning of the snake, does not appear in all of Froben’s printing blocks.43 De Passe’s contribution can be seen mostly in the selection, the aesthetic reduction and the addition of a background action, which suggests a Christian reading of the signet. Rollenhagen, however, must still have had the complete Frobenian signet at his disposal – i. e. the pictura with the motto Prudens simplicitas, amorque recti. Even though the motto is shortened to prudente simplicitate in the inscriptio, Rollenhagen still refers back to the original context of the Frobenian motto. He recognises it as a quote from Martial and starts his own epigram with another verse out of the self-same Martial poem 10, 47: Vitam quae faciant beatiorem: Prudente simplicitate. Vitam quod faciat beatiorem – prudens simplicitas, pie putamus. [“With clever simplicity.// That the clever simplicity may make life more blessed: this we record religiously.”]\n\n42 Frobenius, dum baculum semper erectum gerit, non alio spectans quam ad publicam utilitatem cum a columbina simplicitate non recedit, dum serpentum prudentiam magis exprimit insigniis suis quam factis, fama potius dives est quam re.

De Passe also added the printer’s mark of another Basle printer to his collec­ tion, that of Nicolaus Episcopius the Younger, who was closely connected to Fro­ ben’s printer’s office. It shows the vigilant crane, grus vigilans (Figure 19). The bird is standing on a bishop’s staff that visualises the name of the printer, Episcopius/ bishop, which is inscribed into the picture simultaneously to the left and the right of the staff. De Passe re-engraved the pictura together with the inscription of the name of the printer, but left out his Greek motto (Figure 20). The reason for this may be found in the language but perhaps also in the content of the motto, as Episcopius relates the motif of the vigilant crane specifically to the care and attention the printer needs for his work.44 In his own, new motto, Rollenhagen foregrounds vigilance, vigilantia, as the principal characteristics of rulers: Non dormit qui custodit. Detinet hunc non alta quies similisque sapori [lege: sopori] qui vigili nostras res, ratione, regit. [“Who wakes, sleeps not. // The calm which is deep and similar to heavy sleep does not hold back the one who governs our affairs with a vigilant mind.”]\n\nHere, once again, an antique pre-text adds a certain lightness to the statement: Rol­ lenhagen begins the epigram with a passage from Ovid’s love poetry in which the poet muses on the practical arrangement of the gods, who can always be called on for help in all affairs of love, because they themselves do not need any sleep.45 Rollenhagen compares the ruler with these slightly deranged, omnipresent and ever available gods of love – at least for those readers who can read between the lines and are aware of the pre-text.46 The remains of the name EPIS/COP., which is preserved in the emblem, now do no longer appear as a proper name, but are reinterpreted and generalised as the official title of the prince of the church. The de-individualisation that always takes place with the transition from printer’s mark to emblem here becomes blatantly obvious.\n\n44 For a more detailed interpretation, see Wolkenhauer 2002, 404–409. 45 Ovid, Ars amatoria 1, 639–640: nec secura quies ullos similisque sopori / detinet. 46 I think it more probable that during the cutting of the writing sopori was misread as sapori, becau­ se the counterargument – that Rollhagen had interfered with the Ovid verse to such an extent – must implicate that a literary gain would be connected to this action; this, however, is not the case. ­Warncke 1983 has evidently registered the difficulty with sapori in his edition, but was unable to resolve it and thus simply omitted the term resulting in a flawed transfer.\n\nSisters, or Mother and Daughter?\n\n25\n\nConclusion The relationship between printer’s marks and emblems is difficult to pin down. Research on Alciato and the early history of emblematics can no longer ignore the market-generating and genre-shaping power of printer’s marks: not only did they precede Alciato’s Emblemata chronologically, but they also influenced them in every phase of their development from ekphrastic epigram up to the compe­ ting editions of the 1530s. Later on, many emblems turn into printer’s marks, many printer’s marks become emblems. Much is gained in taking note of the interdepen­ dency of the art forms, even their joint integration into the broad stream of bi-me­ dial arts and in understanding devices, emblems and printer’s marks as closely related and interacting art forms of the Early Modern Age. What allowed all of these bi-medial genres to become productive was not only the Humanists’ craving for education and recognition, but also, and to a similar extent, the existing social networks, the new technical possibilities, and the typographical experiments of the early printers. The ­disproportionately ­inadequate mapping of European prin­ ter’s marks if compared to emblems and devices, is an impediment to research into the history of Early Modern media. It makes it difficult to realise the creative force of printing in its whole depth and to understand the bi-medial art forms from a common perspective.\n\nList of Illustrations Figure 1: Printer’s mark of Johann Froben, from 1515 onward.

During the Second Sophistic, ekphrasis detach­ es itself from its existence as a dependent part within a bigger context of speech and establishes an independent genre, which even generates collections of descriptions of art. Many forms of the usage of ekphraseis do emerge in humanism, especially in epical and lyrical contexts,3 but they prove to be of particular importance for the present context in the field of the reception of classical antiquity in the humanist antiquitates of the fifteenth and sixteenth century. A new humanist descriptio-literature establishes itself, imitating the already existing classical ekphraseis, in the antiquitates from the fifteenth century onwards, which claims to be “scientific”, i. e. methodologically motivated.4 Here humanist periegesis founded by Ciriaco d’Ancona in the wake of Pausanias is of importance, which is reflected in descriptions of travels in Eastern Greece.5 For the autopsy of clas­ sical artefacts that were uncollectable, humanists turned to recording such artefacts in drawings, in the transcription and compilation of inscriptions, and, finally, in verbal descriptions of the seen. The act of describing classical arte­ facts was ­relevant to such an extent that it was utilised for the titling of complete works. The same holds true for the travel literature of Rome, but also, as in the case of the works of Flavio Biondo and Andrea Fulvio, for the descriptive liter­ ature of entire countries from the fifteenth century onwards. But in this case, too, there are a number of antiquarian works that already point towards the\n\n1 Boehm and Pfotenhauer 1995; Wagner 1996; Scholz 2007. 2 Translated from Halsall 1992, 1495: “die kunstvolle sprachliche Darstellung äußerlich sichtbarer Elemente eines Gesamtbildes (Mensch, Gegenstand, Ort, Szene usw.) durch Porträtieren erkennbarer Züge, vollständiges Aufzählen aller Details oder pointiertes Herausstellen wesentlicher Merkmale.” 3 Arnulf 2004, 491–568. 4 Landfester 2014, 24–28. 5 Neuhausen 1996.\n\nDOI 10.1515/9783110430271-002\n\n30\n\nAndreas Bässler\n\nunderlying mode of the descriptio in their titles such as Leon Battista Alberti’s Descriptio urbis Romae and Leandro Alberti’s Descrittione di tutta Italia (written ca. 1530–1534, first printed in 1550).\n\nRevisualisation of Ekphraseis The losses that occurred during the handing down through time constitute a problem that did, however, come up in connection with the antiquitates. This problem does not only apply to classical artefacts but also to texts. Supplements and reconstructions provide a methodological answer.6 Humanist philology reacts to lacunae in ­classical texts and develops the methodology of the supplementing; gaps are “bridged” by the connoisseurs of an author – no matter how speculatively – via supplements. When frag­ mented statues such as the one of Laocoön, which lacks part of the limbs, are discov­ ered, they are reconstructed plastically. Inscriptions that are incomplete are partly added on to the stone artefact itself.7 The nearly non-existent preservation of c­ lassical panel painting is a special case. Nothing is left of some classical works of art but a description; they survive as verbal “remains”. Due to a lack of alternatives, e­ kphraseis thus provide the basis for attempts at reconstruction. The term “revisualisation” refers to an image-producing process on the basis of a media transformation from the text describing an image to an image itself. The feasibility of such a media t­ ransformation is founded on the intermedial idea of the ekphrasis itself. As a time-honored ­rhetorical device it legitimises a media change that “originally” went from the object to its verbal description. Any doubts that such a media change could lead to “losses” in clarity etc. apparently did not exist. The verbal “copy” could “replace” its original. It does only become clear before this background that the once implemented media change from the pictorial and plastic artefact to the word could potentially always also be ­understood as reversible. The central assumption is the possibility and the feasibility of a reciprocal transformability. This kind of reconstruction of classical works of art is, of course, a lot more speculative, precisely because more than just some lost parts need to be reconstructed. Additionally, the revisualisations of the Renaissance seldom consider the problem whether the ekphraseis in question are of real or of imaginary objects, a problem that, in the case of some descriptions, cannot be settled completely to this day. We have to distinguish between a revisualisation that actually tries to reconstruct the original shape within the same medial form: if, e. g., the description of a ­classical painting such as the Calumny of Apelles is re-transformed into a painting by Botti­ celli. Other revisualisations, however, do not show such consideration for medial\n\n6 Howard 1990. 7 Barkan 1999.\n\nEkphrasis and Printer’s Signets\n\n31\n\n­differences: in this case, the description of statues is not again remodelled as a piece of sculpture, but “only” in two-dimensional drawings, woodcuts or paintings. Here a medial gap remains between the “medium of the original” and the revisualisation. But during the Renaissance revisualisations often take licence to deviate; these devi­ ations can be of a medial, sometimes also of a motivic nature. Depending on their subject matter these artefacts could arouse both an historical and an aesthetic interest. For at issue was not only a concern for an historically correct reconstruction of an object from the past but also a concern for their creative and artistic potentials, which those objects possessed because as artefacts and as works of art, they belonged to traditions of intermediality, and served as carriers of aesthetic meaning. Nor should it be overlooked that it was artists dealing with images, rather than humanist philologists who were carrying out the transfer of those strategies into the pictorial medium, and who, in doing so, allowed their own aesthetic ideas to enter into their activities. Revisualisations are thus embedded into a broader context of strategies for visualising extant artefacts of classical antiquity. Comprehensive antiquarian works that sought to systematically identify both visually and descriptively the cat­ egories of engraved gems, coins, vases, vedutas, statues, hermai, reliefs and the topography of Rome, have been in existence since the sixteenth century,8 and have thus created collections of antiquities in paper form. The visualisation of preserved artefacts has, of course, the advantage of being based on existing plastic models. For the most part, however, the fact that this already involves a media transforma­ tion is overlooked, i. e. the “transfer” from the classical artefact to word and image on paper, which has not without good reason been referred to as “paper archaeol­ ogy”.9 Though art history has recognised images of classical antiques of every kind as an artistic and archaeological source,10 it has underestimated the importance of the description of artefacts of classical antiquity or is even highly sceptical of such philologically oriented revisualisation processes, which are based on literary sources: “Vicenzo Cartari [...] attempted in his work Le imagini con la spositione de i dei de gli antichi, Venice 1556, to reconstruct images of gods solely on the foun­ dation of classical text sources, for this reason the work is not considered in the context of this book”.11 In the area of painting the Eikones of both of the Philostrati and the Descriptiones of Callistratus, as it were galleries in verbo, but also the rhetorically ­influenced\n\n8 Heenes 2003. 9 McGrath 1962. 10 Daly Davis 1994; Schade 2007; Rombach and Seiler 2012. 11 Translated from Heenes 2003, 131: “Vicenzo Cartari [...] versuchte in seinem Werk Le imagini con la spositione de i dei de gli antichi, Venedig 1556, Abbildungen von Göttern allein auf der Grundlage von antiken Textquellen zu rekonstruieren, aus diesem Grund wird das Werk im Rahmen dieser Arbeit nicht berücksichtigt.”\n\n32\n\nAndreas Bässler\n\npieces of Lucian and the Tabula Cebetis were especially suited for revisualisation by Renaissance humanism. The epigrams of the Anthologia Graeca, Pausanias’ Periegesis Hellados (Description of Greece) as well as Pliny the Elder’s “history of art” in the Naturalis Historia are more strongly, albeit not exclusively, orientated toward statues and are even mixed with descriptions of architecture and images. Revisualisations of classical ekphraseis began in the second half of the fifteenth century and reached a first climax around 150012: better known ones among them are the Tabula Cebetis,13 the Calumny of Apelles14 and the Hercules Gallicus.15\n\nRevisualisation of Icons Renaissance hieroglyphics is a special form of revisualisation that should not be neglected. The idea that we are dealing with a pure image tradition of classical antiquity,16 as seems plausible at first, is misguided in its basic assumption. The manuscript of the Hieroglyphica of Horapollon, which was discovered on Andros in 1419 and then moved to Florence, is indeed based on an Egyptian pictography of late antiquity. The textual tradition of the manuscript, however, shows not a single Egyptian icon but only a Greek text. The first print editions, as the Greek one of 1505, published by Aldus Manutius, and the Latin translation by Fasanini (1517), prove that we are dealing with a plain text, in which icons are described merely ekphrasti­ cally, and annotated interpretively.17 Occasional hieroglyphical records of classical authors such as Plutarch, Pliny, Plotinus etc. have to be added to this. But here, too, we are dealing with an exclusively written tradition. Original hieroglyphic icons, excepting the ones on archaeological artefacts such as the obelisks in Rome, are not to be found in the written sources at all. For the hieroglyphs of Horapollon the same holds true as for other ekphraseis: they first had to be revisualised as pictures, before they could develop an independent iconography in the Renaissance. Here painters such as Leonardo, Mantegna and Giovanni Bellini are the ones who revisualised hieroglypical signs toward the end of the fifteenth century.18 Eventually, Dürer adds his drawings to a Latin translation of the Hieroglyphica by Pirckheimer in 1512. Only with the translations and editions that appeared from the middle of the sixteenth century onwards, the German one by Herold (1554) and Valerianos’s monumental encyclopaedia (1556), did a continuous ­revisualisation of the ­hieroglyphs through\n\n12 Förster 1922; Marek 1985; Rosand 1990. 13 Schleier 1973; Hirsch 2005. 14 Förster 1887; Cast 1981; Massing 1990. 15 Till 1994; Bulst 2003. 16 Heckscher and Wirth 1967, 97. 17 Drysdall 1983, 146–147. 18 Praz 1964, 24–25.\n\nEkphrasis and Printer’s Signets\n\n33\n\nadded picturae become the norm. The Pythagorean symbola,19 20–30 short apho­ risms, which were originally dietetic maxims but were allegorised later on, form part of the immediate context of the Hieroglyphica. Pythagoras, who probably spent some time in Egypt, was assumed in the Renaissance to have verbalized the knowledge of the mysteries, originally laid down in the form of hieroglyphs, which he had ac­­ quired while he was there, “as a verb"
