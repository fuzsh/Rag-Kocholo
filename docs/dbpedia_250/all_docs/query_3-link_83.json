        "text": "Artikeln publiceras i samarbete med News Now Finland.\n\nLatest coronavirus numbers\n\nThe Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare says there have been 3,161 confirmed cases of coronavirus - up 97 from the day before. There have also been 64 deaths.\n\nAlthough the worst-hit region in terms of actual cases and number of fatalities is the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District, across the country there are currently 232 coronavirus patients in hospital - 75 of them in intensive care.\n\nTesting has increased recently with 4,000 tests being carried out every day at public healthcare facilities. However, testing is still done on a priority bases with those who show sever symptoms of coronavirus; staff and patients in nursing homes; and those over 70 who might also have an underlying medical condition.\n\nMask scandal due to \"negligence\"\n\nThe Minister of Employment Tuula Haatainen (SDP) has said that the problems with an order of medical-grade masks from China last week was due to negligence at the National Emergency Supply Agency NESA.\n\nResponding to a question in Parliament on Tuesday afternoon, Haatainen said that care must be taken to ensure that all state-owned institutions comply with the rules and guidelines for procurement.\n\nThe head of NESA Tomi Lounema resigned on Friday after several days of bad press over a multi-million euro deal to bring medical supplies from China to Finland. NESA contracted the work through two middlemen including a woman who runs a plastic surgery business in Estonia and a man with a payday loan company.\n\nPreviously, the reason for Lounema's departure had been put down to a lack of trust in him to do the job running NESA, but Haatainen for the first time attributed it to negligence.\n\nConcerns over numbers of Somalis with coronavirus\n\nHealthcare officials in the Finnish capital have expressed their concerns about the rise in numbers of Somali-speaking residents testing positive for coronavirus.\n\nSo far nearly 200 cases have been confirmed, which the City of Helsinki says translates to 1.8% of the Somali community in the capital, compared to 0.2% average among all of Helsinki’s residents.\n\n“I find the recent spread of infection among minority-language communities very worrying\" says Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori (NCP) in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile Left Alliance Councillor Suldaan Said Ahmed, who is himself recovering at home after testing positive for coronavirus, says there are many reasons why immigrant communities are vulnerable to the disease, like multi-generational living and more crowded housing which doesn't allow for proper self-isolation.\n\n“There is also a class issue involved, because many Somali immigrants work in low paid jobs like cleaners and bus drivers, so they don’t have the option to work remotely” he says.

According to local media the indications are that Prime Minister Sanna Marin (SDP) will let the travel restrictions expire on 19th April as originally planned.\n\nThe measures were put in place to limit the spread of coronavirus from the capital, where there were significantly more confirmed cases at the time, to other parts of the country. However it's thought that strategy will not be so effective any more as Covid-19 cases have been increasing in other parts of the country now too.\n\nMeanwhile police say there was an increase in traffic at the Uusimaa border over the Easter weekend, with 13,743 vehicles trying to get in or out of the region on Monday alone. Police turned by 196 vehicles and fined 22 people for violating the Emergency Act."
