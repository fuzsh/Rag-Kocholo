The goblin (and werehouse) GAHZEEBO is well-known to city bureaucrats as a shady contractor who performs sub-par work that is not up to code. Gathering up a number of unlicensed subcontractors whom Gahzeebo has infected with lycanthropy, the werehouse has gone to a formerly sealed level: Undermountain, the Musical! There he plans to complete the final stage of his dastardly plan: to build a dangerously sub-quality theater, gather the nobles of Waterdeep with free tickets, and infect them while they are distracted by the spectacle of Flumphapolusa. The werehouse needs only capture enough gassy flumphs and the nobles of Waterdeep will fall to his evil plan.

The BISCUIT HERALD, as the owner would come to be known, was charged by Lliira to wander the Realms in search of parties and other joyous events at which to share their gift. But as it usually happens, someone had to ruin the fun. At some point, the last Herald (whose name is lost to time) was slain by bandits while traveling some lonesome, dusty road, and the bag was lost. The bag has had several owners since then, the most recent being a man named HON ARVID. An adventurer, he and his fellows are in dire need of help. Help that comes—though not necessarily in the form that he expected…Nine Hells\n\n18\n\n011b\n\nDDAL00-11 Pipyap’s Guide to All of the Nine Hells: Dis: When the Debt Comes Due\n\n1-432\n\nClaire Hoffman,Greg Marks\n\nDIS is a maze of canyons that separate sheer mountains rich in iron ore. Roads made of iron wander through the land, watched over from iron fortresses scattered about. All roads led to the City of Dis, where its lord, DISPATER, rules from his crimson throne. The largest metropolis in the Nine Hells is a place of commerce where planar travelers close deals with devils and the other creatures that chose to reside there, such as night hags. Of course, Dispater is enriched by each of those deals. One such deal is about to become due. The imp PIPYAP owes a debt to the night hag TAL’KANDELAGRAG. He owes the hag eleven EVIL SOULS. Through Pipyap’s own efforts and deals made with adventurers, he has collected eleven SOUL GEMS from the soul bags of hags without personally killing the hags that originally owned them. Now he just needs a group of nondevils to deliver them as he does not want to take the chance of using any devils to transport the chest with the gems. For reasons of his own he also does not want CASSYT, a cleric of Kelemvor, to transport them, though he has her help round up suitable adventurers.Nine Hells\n\n19\n\n011c\n\nDDAL00-11 Pipyap’s Guide to All of the Nine Hells: Phlegethos: I’ve Seen Fire and I’ve Seen Pain\n\n5-1083\n\nAmy Lynn Dzura\n\nFor untold years, PIPYAP has been in possession of a magic COOKIE BAG, which supplies him with his favorite treats on demand. Unfortunately, Pipyap seems to have misplaced his cookie bag, so Pipyap has tasked a group of adventurers to travel to the Nine Hells -- specifically the fourth layer of the Hells, PHLEGETHOS -- to retrieve a bottle of his favorite wine (that pairs particularly well with his favorite cookies) to soothe his frazzled nerves. Of course, this is not an easy task. The adventurers must navigate ABRIYMOCH, the capital city overrun with molten lava, to find the sommelier, SHIRVASA, while evading the numerous devils on guard patrol who question the appearance of mortals in their fiery city. Above all, they should not attract the attention of rulers, LADY FIERNA and BELIAL, who preside over Phlegethos from their crystalline palace.Nine Hells\n\n20\n\n011d\n\nDDAL00-11 Pipyap’s Guide to All of the Nine Hells: Malbolge: The Love Triangle Contract\n\n5-1082-4Greg MarksPreviously, the imp PIPYAP discovered an artifact dedicated to LLIIRA, the goddess of joy, which for the imp, adopted the form of what he most desired: a bag of cookies. Unfortunately, Pipyap lost the bag, again. Since losing the COOKIE BAG, Pipyap was contacted by the disgraced archdevil MOLOCH, former Lord of the Sixth. Moloch claims that he has the cookie bag and can trade it for a favor. Since Moloch was (in Pipyap’s mind) a rival for the affections of the now deceased MALAGARD THE HAG COUNTESS, he’s not sure he can trust Moloch. So, Pipyap has arranged a meeting on the sixth layer of Hell MALBOLGE, where Moloch is cursed by ASMODEUS to assume the form of a lowly imp. Moloch has heard of the cookie bag and actually hopes to find it, so he can use it to get his heart’s desire: a return to his full power in the Nine Hells. He doesn’t actually have it, but he has an idea how to get it. One of his greatest trackers MOGDRIN THE VENATOR, an orthon devil, has been imprisoned in Malbolge ever since Moloch’s fall. He believes that Mogdrin could track down the artifact for Moloch, as well as many of the scattered forces he hasn’t been able to find since his fall during the RECKONING OF HELL and the later destruction of his former consort Malagard. He has no intention of honoring the deal, however, and has taken steps to ensure loopholes. The whispers of the cookie bag found their way to Moloch via NARIAH, an erinyes minion of GLASYA, the daughter of Asmodeus and current Lord of the Sixth. She knows that Moloch is weaker while on Malbolge and is using the rumor of the cookie bag to lure him back. She wishes to capture Moloch in order to end his threat to Glasya’s rule.Nine Hells\n\n21\n\n011e\n\nDDAL00-11 Pipyap’s Guide to All of the Nine Hells: Cania: A Fire Grows in Cania\n\n11-16134-6\n\nLysa Penrose,Greg Marks\n\nThere’s a fire growing in CANIA… and that’s the problem. As the archduke of this icy wasteland, MEPHISTOPHELES’ obsession with developing powerful, magical flame—called HELLFIRE—has chased his former minions, the ice devils, to the fringes of this artic domain. Many ice devils grumble and mope at their falling out of the archduke’s favor, but one ice devil, LANCHE, has begun to plot. Hearing rumbles of an imp amassing a powerful army, Lanche is inspired to take action and correct her master’s foolish behavior… with the adventurers’ help. At Lanche’s behest, the party dupes, defeats, or creeps through a Cult of Mephistopheles base to enter Cania’s ACADEMIA ACANIA, where they are instructed to run amok. It’s time to destroy the school of hellfire! Well, Dean QUAGREM might have something to say about that.Nine Hells\n\n22\n\n011f\n\nDDAL00-11 Pipyap’s Guide to All of the Nine Hells: Nessus: Twice as Nice for Half the Price\n\n17-20184-6Alan PatrickThe imp, PIPYAP, has long desired a promotion from his current role into something more suitable for his goals, and he’s found tools to help him get there. The biggest problem is that his special goodie bag has once again gone missing. Through much coercing, cajoling, and cashing in of favors, he’s learned that the bag is currently held by a devil named XAK’THAR. Unfortunately, Xak’thar is deep within the hellscape of NESSUS and is considered by most to be an all-around sour individual. Getting to Nessus isn’t as easy as it used to be now that the lower Hells have been sealed off. Pipyap is currently unable to enter the Hells but has discovered that the merchant FAI CHEN holds a few select secrets, including the knowledge of how to travel through secret passages and lost labyrinths. Pipyap knows that this is a significant gamble, sending mortals to the Hells on a quest to retrieve his trinket. Once they return, he has only a small window of opportunity to enact his final plan…Nine Hells\n\n23\n\n012a\n\nDDAL00-12 Infernal Encounters: Bad Seed\n\n1-431Gregory Marks2/20/2020NEIDHARD, the son of Waterdavian brewers MARQ and ERYN sought to escape a boring future crafting beer and so made a deal with a minion of the archdevil DISPATER. In exchange for the souls of his parents, he was granted magical power. Unfortunately, the boy didn’t read the fine print in his contract too well and he is serving the armies of Dis as their brewer for eternity. Now he works tirelessly under the gaze of the spined devil CHEZRURC who holds the contract and forces the teen to brew!Nine Hells\n\n24\n\n012b\n\nDDAL00-12 Infernal Encounters: A Helpful Distraction\n\n5-1081Gregory Marks2/20/2020ZAHN (aasimar assassin) and VARKNOC (copper dragonborn master thief) have come to the Nine Hells at the behest of Bahumat's court. The pair has spent most of their time watching and waiting for the right opportunity. The time has come. A courier has transferred a scroll tube to a waystation. The tube contains TIAMAT’S latest plans to wrest control of AVERNUS from the archdevil ZARIEL, and is due to be sent off to some of the Dragon Queen’s more powerful lieutenants. Unfortunately, the waystation, called the TOWER OF SCALES, is virtually impregnable. It is magically sealed to have no entrance or exit, and no magic gets inside. But the pair have an idea. If someone antagonizes the abishai inside enough to open the tower and come out, the pair could sneak inside. This means they just need the right diversion.Nine Hells\n\n25\n\n012c\n\nDDAL00-12 Infernal Encounters: The Soft Touch\n\n11-16131Gregory Marks2/20/2020The night hag, IXPANIALTHEA, has been outsmarted by her rival BAHJNAHUVNA, a rakshasa with no shortage of enemies. Following a scam, Bahjnahuvna made off with the hag’s soul bag. While Isxpanialthea could craft another bag, the soul she had just captured in the bag was particularly valuable and she wants it back. Unfortunately, with so many foes looking for him, Bahjnahuvna has fled to the city of GRENPOLI in Maladomini, the sanctuary of the Nine Hells where no violence is possible. Hiding out in the city, he is protected after a fashion. Isxpanialthea needs someone crafty, annoying, or desperate enough to go after the rakshasa and recover her soul bag.Nine Hells\n\n26\n\n012d\n\nDDAL00-12 Infernal Encounters: The Devil’s Song\n\n17-20181Gregory Marks2/20/2020The beauty of PHALAERAPHE’S song was such that the Lord of the Nine himself promoted her from an erinyes to unique devil, and gifted her with a domain of her own close to him. Unfortunately for Phalaeraphe, Asmodeus’ daughter GLASYA sees the opportunity to eliminate a rival. She dispatches one of her erinyes minions, EREREL, to direct a band of heroes.Nine Hells\n\n27\n\n11DDEX01-01 Defiance in Phlan1-211 hour (five 1-hour adventures)Shawn Merwin8/18/2014The Cult of the Dragon has come to Phlan, a lawless refuge on the Moonsea.
