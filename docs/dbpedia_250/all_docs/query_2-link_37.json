        "text": "At a European level, on several occasions, the EU Police Cooperation Working Party (PCWP) identified the need for continuous evaluation and review of measures taken by Member States to counter football-related violence. At the April 26, 2005 meeting the Dutch delegation proposed to the PCWP internationally composed police peer review evaluation teams to contribute towards successful public order management in the context of international football matches. The idea of a peer review evaluation team is to involve experienced police officers from several countries in the evaluation of large-scale police operations, not to investigate afterwards, but to observe police operations in real time. Creating no blame, but to exchange and to learn, creating a win-win situation in which both requesting police forces and participating reviewers gain something and more general lessons can be drawn as well. Based on this view, the EU Police Cooperation Working Party agreed to start a 3-year pilot with internationally composed peer review evaluation teams to conduct, on a voluntary basis, intercollegiate reviews of public order management in the context of international football matches. The pilot lasted from september 2005 to september 2008. The Euro 2008 football championships held in Austria and Switzerland fell in this period and in the course of 2007, five of the eight cities hosting matches during Euro 2008 requested a review. On February 19 2008, a meeting was organised in Switzerland with commanders from the four Swiss host cities to discuss the results of the peer reviews held in Switzerland, with specific emphasis on any point of attention relevant for Euro 2008. The need was felt to communicate the peer review experiences more widely and to document them so that they could be used in education and training. This book attempts to do just that and is the reflection of the peer review experiences during the three years that the pilot lasted. It begins by presenting the rationale behind the peer reviews. It next details the peer review methodology that was used during the pilot. Following that, nine reports are included in full: three related to Champions League matches, three to matches between different national teams and three to increased risk local derby matches. In the next chapter, an overview of the outcome of the peer reviews in the form of good practices and points of attention identified by the review teams is given. In the final chapter, a summary of relevant issues in theory, practice and education for public order management is given.\n\nThis paper presents a case study of the riots in the Dutch neighbourhood of Ondiep (Utrecht) that took place after a police officer shot a local resident with fatal consequences on 11 March 2007. It is based on a study carried out by the Police Academy of The Netherlands and the Tilburg School of Politics and Public Administration (University of Tilburg) and its resulting publication: ‘Riots in Ondiep: the onset and engagement of large-scale public disturbances in a disadvantaged neighbourhood of Utrecht’. The research group aimed to establish a reconstruction of the events and circumstances of those riots as experienced by the different parties to the events. This paper gives a brief overview of the events as they occurred with a particular focus on the actions of the Utrecht police department and their safety partners. It is argued that a combination of repressive measures and an emphasis on police–community relations prevented the riots from spreading to the general population of Ondiep, by looking at some of the short and long-term actions, tactics and strategies of the Utrecht police.\n\nThe paper presents data on street trials held with pepper spray in four police forces in The Netherlands and compares these with other research findings, specifically with regard to the safety and effectiveness of pepper spray and the position of pepper spray in the use-of-force continuum. There is little doubt that the use of Oleoresin Capsicum can be a real bonus in situations where suspects have some sort of impact weapon or are violent. However, designating pepper spray as the preferred option in situations where suspects are verbally resistive seems unreasonable and could even be seen as a form of abuse. The solution to safe and responsible police interventions in potentially dangerous situations should not be sought one-sidedly in technology, but also in improving tactical and technical skills of police officers.\n\nFollowing disturbances during the EU summit in Gothenburg in 2001, the Swedish police adopted a new concept, called special police tactics, for the policing of public order. In 2006, the Swedish National Police Board decided to start a 3-year project to develop a long term strategy for knowledge development with regard to these tactics, integrating research, training, and practice. This article reports on the set up and results of this reform project. Changes in the planning, carrying out and evaluation of police operations at major events were observed. The project provided a theoretical foundation for the special police tactics and a practical evaluation method for continuous knowledge development. The project methodology contributed to a developmental climate in the special police tactics organization. The project work also reinforced the basis for public order policing of crowds, to contribute to upholding consitutional rights of assembly and freedom of speech."
