On June 6, 1523, he was elected King of Sweden – as Gustav Vasa. The first Vasaloppet took place in 1922. This year will see the 99th Vasaloppet, which is also the 27th with a special competition class for women (started in 1997). Three races were canceled: 1932, 1934, and 1990. Since 1948 the race had always run on the first Sunday of March, except in 2015 when the race ran on the second Sunday because of the World Ski Championships in Falun.\n\nThe first live TV broadcast of Vasaloppet took place in 1966. This will be the 46th time that Vasaloppet (in part or in its entirety) is transmitted live, and it’s the 41st time that the Vasaloppet start is broadcast live on television. 1973 was the first year with a live broadcast in color. Since 1992 Vasaloppet has been shown live every year.\n\nSince 1922 a total of 612,472 Vasaloppet skiers have completed the 90-kilometer Vasaloppet; if we put together all 98 races, participants have skied a distance equal to 1,375 round the world trips or 71 journeys to the moon and back. (Combining winter and summer races, there had been 1,735,888 finishes before this year’s Winter Week.)\n\nThe average finishing time for the 612,472 participants can be counted as 7.58.17 (average) or 7.54.00 (median).\n\nThe Average Skier 2023\n\nIn Vasaloppet 2023, the average age is 42.2 and the average participant has skied Vasaloppet 3.5 times before.\n\nOf the registered Vasaloppet skiers in 2023, 57 percent have skied Vasaloppet before. So 43 percent are skiing Vasaloppet for the first time. 18.6 percent of the registered participants in the track on Sunday are women.\n\nNames Of Interest 2023\n\nMen\n\nAndreas Nygaard, last year’s winner.\n\nEmil Persson leads Ski Classics this year and has won eight out of nine individual races. Second place in Vasaloppet 2022.\n\nMax Novak has been in the top 3 three times, and this season he’s currently third in Ski Classics.\n\nTord Asle Gjerdalen, won 2021. If he were to win this year, too, he’d be the oldest Vasaloppet winner.\n\nPetter Northug came tenth in Marcialonga 2012 and was supposed to ski Vasaloppet that year but could not start. This year he came fifth in Grönklitt Criterium, his best placement in Ski Classics.\n\nAlvar Myhlback, born March 22, 2006, has received a special dispensation from the Swedish Ski Association and will be Vasaloppet’s youngest participant ever. (To participate in Vasaloppet 2023, you must ordinarily be born in 2004 or earlier, in other words, you have to turn 19 this calendar year.)\n\nWomen\n\nAstrid Øyre Slind, last year’s winner, will be skiing the 30km at the World Championships in Planica the day before Vasaloppet.\n\nMagni Smedås is leading Ski Classics this year. Won both Marcialonga and Jizerská and can take home a Grand Slam. Has never skied Vasaloppet.\n\nIda Dahl has won most races among the women this year, putting her second in Ski Classics. Her best Vasaloppet placement was third in 2021.\n\nEmilie Fleten, second place in Vasaloppet 2022. She has been in the top 3 in 16 Ski Classics races but has yet to win.\n\nStart List\n\nhttps://results.vasaloppet.se/2023/?lang=EN_CAP&pid=startlist\n\n(The elite start group is VL0, after which there are ten additional start groups.)\n\nWinners\n\nThe last ten Vasaloppet winners, men\n\n2013 Jørgen Aukland, Norway\n\n2014 John Kristian Dahl, Norway\n\n2015 Petter Eliassen, Norway\n\n2016 John Kristian Dahl, Norway\n\n2017 John Kristian Dahl, Norway\n\n2018 Andreas Nygaard, Norway\n\n2019 Tore Bjørset Berdal, Norway\n\n2020 Petter Eliassen, Norway\n\n2021 Tord Asle Gjerdalen, Norway\n\n2022 Andreas Nygaard, Norway\n\nThe last ten Vasaloppet winners, women\n\n2013 Laila Kveli, Norway\n\n2014 Laila Kveli, Norway\n\n2015 Justyna Kowalczyk, Poland\n\n2016 Katerina Smutná, Austria\n\n2017 Britta Johansson Norgren, Sweden\n\n2018 Lina Korsgren, Sweden\n\n2019 Britta Johansson Norgren, Sweden\n\n2020 Lina Korsgren, Sweden\n\n2021 Lina Korsgren, Sweden\n\n2022 Astrid Øyre Slind, Norway\n\nLast Year’s Results\n\nAll top ten men from 2022 are still active, while six of the top ten women in Vasaloppet 2022 have now retired.

Awards to the top 15 men and top 15 women. The prize sum is the same in the men’s and women’s classes.\n\nThe first prize (for both men and women) is a gold medal, a garland, a big red Dalecarlian horse and a cheque of 99,000 SEK, (for both the winning man and woman) as this is the 99th race. In addition, the victors receive the sponsors’ honorary award, a brass cast ship’s bell, awarded this year by Volvo. The men’s class winner will also get the Kranskulla honorary award, an embroidered pillow. (The Kransmas honorary award was given at Tjejvasan.)\n\nThere are seven sprint prizes for both men and women: 10,000 SEK in Evertsberg (The Hill Prize) and 5,000 SEK at the six other checkpoints; Smågan, Mångsbodarna, Risberg, Oxberg, Hökberg, and Eldris.\n\nThe total prize sum for Vasaloppet 2023 is 618,000 SEK. If a participant sets a new record time in the men’s or women’s class of Vasaloppet, they will also be awarded a 50,000 SEK record bonus.\n\nPlacement medals – gold, silver, and bronze – are awarded to those who come first, second, and third. Participants who finish within the winning time plus 50 percent are awarded the Vasaloppet achievement medal. Everyone who completes Vasaloppet gets a diploma and a participation medal.\n\nThe first man and woman to reach Mångsbodarna in 2023 will get the first number bibs for the 100th Vasaloppet 2024, with the number 100.\n\nSki Classics has a “climb prize” at the course’s highest point, 528 meters above sea level, three kilometers after the start. The first seven men and women to reach this height get points in the Climb Trophy cup. Ski Classics also has sprint prizes for Mångsbodarna and Evertsberg. The first seven men and women to reach those checkpoints get points in the Sprint Trophy cup.\n\nGrand Slam\n\nFor the 2020/21 season, Ski Classics launched the “Grand Classics,” which includes the four big races Marcialonga in Italy, Jizerská50 in the Czech Republic, Vasaloppet in Sweden, and Birkebeinerrennet in Norway. If a skier wins all four in the same season, they make a Grand Slam.\n\nSo far in history, no skier has managed to win all four races during the same season, not since Ski Classics started nor before. The four races are also valued higher in Ski Classics: Winners of these four races get 300 points in the overall cup, compared to 200 points for other races.\n\nKranskulla and Kransmas\n\nThis year’s Kranskulla is Alice Larsson from Sälens IF (Kranskulla number 99), and Kransmas is Albin Gezelius from IFK Mora (Kranskulla number 35).\n\nCounties\n\nThe participant numbers from different Swedish counties in Vasaloppet 2023 were, as of February 21: Stockholm (2,571), Västra Götaland (1,988), Dalarna (659), Skåne (654), Uppsala (557), Västerbotten (484), Jönköping (463), Östergötland (432), Halland (390), Norrbotten (383), Jämtland (363), Gävleborg (359), Västernorrland (317), Värmland (314), Örebro (298), Västmanland (258), Kronoberg (232), Södermanland (222), Kalmar (180), Blekinge (110), Gotland (48).

In Vasaloppet, veterans start in their row in start group 5 (closest to the wall).\n\nRead more about Vasaloppet veterans:\n\nhttps://www.vasaloppet.se/om-oss/veteraner\n\nNumber 103 Pays Tribute to Margit Nordin\n\n100 years ago, on March 4, 1923, Margit Nordin was the first woman to ski Vasaloppet. After that, women were not allowed to participate until Öppet Spår launched in 1979, and they weren’t allowed in Vasaloppet until 1981. The Facebook group “VasanFörMargit” (Vasa for Margit) started as a private initiative to get more women to ski Vasaloppet and the group has, among other things, printed cloth badges with Margit Nordin’s start number 103, to be worn – regardless of your gender – as a tribute to the first woman in Vasaloppet. Around 300 badges have been distributed and many people have produced their own variants which will be seen on participants on the track this Sunday.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, Vasaloppet started “More women on the track,” a project focused on actively attracting more women to participate in the various races during Vasaloppet’s Winter Week and Summer Week.\n\nCelebrities in Vasaloppet 2023\n\nLars Berger, Norwegian former elite biathlete, world champion in both cross-country skiing and biathlon\n\nPer-Anders Gråberg, Swedish champion jockey\n\nJonas Stentäpp, hard rocker, “Hjalle & Heavy”, Mimikry\n\nMelker Andersson, chef, restaurateur\n\nJohan Jureskog, chef, restaurateur\n\nRobin Bryntesson, former elite skier (will be skiing backwards!)\n\nPeter Göransson, Vasaloppet winner 1998\n\nHanna “Hannalicious” Friberg, blogger\n\nNinni Schulman, crime author\n\nDag Bredberg, former elite hockey player; Swedish champion 1983 with Djurgården\n\nEric Ågren, former elite bandy player\n\nLasse Beischer, actor\n\nJan Friis-Mikkelsen, Danish TV chef\n\nBirger Fält, Vasaloppet expert, former member of the national race walking team\n\nHans Gerremo, former CEO of SLAO\n\nStephan Wilson, TV host\n\nMichael Storåkers, business leader, prolific advertiser\n\nØystein Löseth, Norwegian business leader, former CEO of Vattenfall\n\nTime penalty\n\nIf a participant is found to have littered in or along the Vasaloppet course (which is a nature reserve), then they will receive a time penalty of 15 minutes. This rule was introduced in 2017. Disposing of litter is permitted in three different ways: In the bins at the Vasaloppet checkpoints; In the marked littering zones between each Vasaloppet checkpoint; Where you, as a participant, know that a team leader or associate will pick up what you throw. For elite skiers, Vasaloppet holds special dialogue, requiring that each team takes responsibility for and picks up any of their waste that is thrown along the track.\n\nWeather\n\nThe coldest temperature at a Vasaloppet start in Sälen was -30 degrees Celsius, measured in 1935 and 1987. The warmest starting temperature, +4.5 degrees Celsius, was in 2015. Over the 98 years that Vasaloppet has run, it’s been below zero at the start 85 times.\n\nVasaloppet’s Summer Week 2023\n\nVasaloppet doesn’t just have a Winter Week. Since 2009 there’s also a Vasaloppet Summer Week with twelve mountain bike and running races, such as Cykelvasan 90 and Ultravasan 90.
