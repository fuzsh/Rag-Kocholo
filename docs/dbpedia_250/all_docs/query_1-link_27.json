        "text": "After Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) secured a convincing 106-run win over Delhi Capitals (DC) in the Indian Premier League (IPL),per Shreyas Iyer expressed his delight at achieving three consecutive victories, singling out this latest win as the most special of them all.\n\nVisita bet365.com per maggiori dettagli sulle ultime offerte\n\nGet bonus\n\nKolkata Knight Riders (KKR) put on a stellar display across all aspects of the game in their IPL 2024 clash against Delhi Capitals at the ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Visakhapatnam on Wednesday.\n\nTaking to the social media platform ‘X’, Iyer shared his joy, stating, “Three on trot with the most special of them all. Couldn’t be more proud of this super, super team.”\n\nIn his three IPL outings so far, the skipper has amassed 57 runs at an average of 28.50, with his top score being 39 against Royal Challengers Bangalore.\n\nIn the recent match, explosive performances from Sunil Narine (85 runs off 39 balls, including seven fours and seven sixes), Angkrish Raghuvanshi (54 runs off 27 balls, with five fours and three sixes), as well as contributions from Andre Russell (41 runs off 19 balls, with four boundaries and three sixes) and Rinku Singh (26 runs off eight balls, with one four and three sixes) propelled the two-time champions to a commanding total of 272/7 in 20 overs.\n\nWhile Anrich Nortje (3/59) stood out for DC with the ball, Ishant Sharma (2/43) also put in a solid performance. Khaleel Ahmed and Mitchell Marsh chipped in with a wicket each.\n\nIn response, DC found themselves struggling at 33/4. A resilient 93-run partnership between skipper Rishabh Pant (55 runs off 25 balls, including four boundaries and five sixes) and Tristan Stubbs (54 runs off 32 balls, with four boundaries and four sixes) provided some entertainment for the fans, but DC eventually succumbed to 166 all out in 17.2 overs.\n\nVaibhav Arora (3/27) and Varun Chakravarthy (3/33) starred with the ball for KKR, while Mitchell Starc grabbed 2/25 in three overs. Andre Russell and Sunil Narine also chipped in with a wicket each.\n\nNarine’s impressive fifty earned him the ‘Player of the Match’ award. With three wins out of three games, KKR currently leads the IPL table with six points, while DC sits in ninth place with two points from one win and three losses."
