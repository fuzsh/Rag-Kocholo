        "text": "MADISON, Wis. - Following a disappointing ninth-place finish to the 2021 season, Forward Madison FC has made wholesale changes to its roster both on the pitch and off. Newly appointed Head Coach and Technical Director Matt Glaeser brings USL Championship and MLS coaching experience to Madison while new Assistant Coach John Pascarella joins the Flamingos after previously leading USL Championship side OKC Energy FC.\n\nDespite the sale of 2021 All-League selection Aaron Molloy to the USL Championship’s Memphis 901 FC during the offseason, FMFC has brought in a number of playmakers including former Sporting Kansas City II goalscorer Rojay Smith, Corinthians youth product Matheus Cassini and Trinidad and Tobago international Alvin Jones. Madison also added Finnish youth international Jeremiah Streng to its attack on a season-long loan deal.\n\nWith the departure of Forward Madison icon Connor Tobin in the offseason, Madison has also reloaded in its defensive line with the re-signing of defender Eric Leonard and the signing of former USL Championship defender Mitch Osmond, who follows former head coach John Pascarella to Madison. A season ago, the Australian defender played in every minute of OKC’s season.\n\nPlayers to watch\n\nMitch Osmond - DEF: USL Championship veteran Mitch Osmond is one of several new arrivals to Forward Madison FC’s flamboyance ahead of 2022. The Australian defender last suited up for OKC Energy FC a season ago, playing in every minute of the Energy’s 32-match campaign. Osmond recorded a team-leading 1,610 passes and 120 clearances in addition to leading OKC in interceptions with 80. Prior to arriving in Oklahoma City, Osmond made a combined 24 appearances for Indy Eleven between the 2019 and 2020 seasons, having initially been drafted by Minnesota United FC in the 2019 MLS SuperDraft."
