BCC typically lacks immunoreactivity with cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 1 protein (PHLDA1). A series of BFH and infundibulocystic BCC were investigated to determine the pattern of CK20 and PHLDA1 labeling in these lesions. Thirty-six samples of BFH (n = 14) and infundibulocystic BCC (n = 22) were collected. CK20 and PHLDA1 staining was performed and evaluated. All the lesions were small (average of 3 mm), well circumscribed, and composed of basaloid to squamoid cells arranged in islands resembling ramifying rootlets with interspersed horn cysts. CK20-positive cells were present in all 36 cases (average, 22/mm(2)), throughout the tumor, including deeper portions, irrespective of original diagnosis. Six of thirty cases (20%; 5 infundibulocystic BCC, 1 BFH) were focally PHLDA1 positive. Findings on hematoxylin and eosin staining and those of CK20 staining in BFH and infundibulocystic BCC were similar, and in most cases were indistinguishable. The CK20 labeling was similar to that of trichoepithelioma. The findings add a degree of support to the argument that BFH and infundibulocystic BCC represent the same lesion and, further, a benign one. Â© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Basaloid follicular hamartomas (BFHs) constitute rare neoplasms that can be detected in sporadic and familial settings as in the Basaloid Follicular Hamartoma Syndrome (BFHS). Although BFHS shares clinical, histopathological and genetic overlapping with the NBCCS, they are still considered two distinctive entities. The aim of our single-institution study was the analysis of a cohort of PTCH1-mutated patients in order to define clinical and biomolecular relationship between NBCCS and BFHs. In our study we evaluated PTCH1 gene-carrier probands affected by NBCCS to detect the incidence of BFHs and their correlation with this rare syndrome. Among probands we recognized 4 patients with BFHs. We found 15 germline PTCH1 mutations, uniformly distributed across the PTCH1 gene. Six of them had familial history of NBCCS, two of them were novel and have not been described previously. NBCCS and BFHS may be the same genetic entity and not two distinctive syndromes. The inclusion of BFH in the NBCCS cutaneous tumor spectrum might be useful for the recognition of misdiagnosed NBCCS cases that could benefit from tailored surveillance strategies.

Aparece en las mujeres en la edad media de la vida y se presenta clÃ­nicamente como un nÃ³dulo bien definido e indoloro. El diagnÃ³stico imagenolÃ³gico es el que hace pensar en Ã©ste, ya que es un tumor poco frecuente. HistolÃ³gicamente cumple los requisitos generales de un hamartoma: mezcla desordenada de tejidos maduros y especializados. En la mama se puede apreciar estructura ductal y lobulillar con estroma fibroso, tejido adiposo y en ocasiones, tejido muscular liso. En este trabajo se presenta un caso de una paciente de 40 aÃ±os con un hamartoma de la mama derecha que histolÃ³gicamente mostraba ademÃ¡s, tejido Ã³seo y cartilaginosoBreast hamartoma or breast fibroadenolipoma is a nodular lesion that may resemble a fibroadenoma or phyllodes tumor. It appears in middle-aged women and it clinically presents as a well defined and painless nodule. The imaging diagnosis makes to think about it, since it is an uncommon tumor. From the histological point of view, it fulfills the general requirements of a hamartoma: disarranged combination of mature and specialized tissues. Ductal and lobular structure with fibrous stroma, fat tissue and, on occasions, smooth muscular tissue, may be observed in the breast. A case of a 40-year-old female patient with a hamartoma of the right mamma that histologically showed osteal and cartilaginous tissue is reported\n\nHistologic Mimics of Basal Cell Carcinoma.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStanoszek, Lauren M; Wang, Grace Y; Harms, Paul W\n\n2017-11-01\n\n- Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common human malignant neoplasm and is a frequently encountered diagnosis in dermatopathology. Although BCC may be locally destructive, it rarely metastasizes. Many diagnostic entities display morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap with BCC, including nonneoplastic processes, such as follicular induction over dermatofibroma; benign follicular tumors, such as trichoblastoma, trichoepithelioma, or basaloid follicular hamartoma; and malignant tumors, such as sebaceous carcinoma or Merkel cell carcinoma. Thus, misdiagnosis has significant potential to result in overtreatment or undertreatment. - To review key features distinguishing BCC from histologic mimics, including current evidence regarding immunohistochemical markers useful for that distinction. - Review of pertinent literature on BCC immunohistochemistry and differential diagnosis. - In most cases, BCC can be reliably diagnosed by histopathologic features. Immunohistochemistry may provide useful ancillary data in certain cases. Awareness of potential mimics is critical to avoid misdiagnosis and resulting inappropriate management.\n\nSurgical Treatment for Pulmonary Hamartomas\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFunda IÂncekara\n\n2015-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Aim: In this study, we evaluated the patients operated for hamartoma and treated endobronchially and the diagnostic value of this approach has been examined. Material and Method: 59 patients (24 females, 35 males; mean age 53 years, range 28-78 years which were operated and endobronchial treated for hamartoma in our clinic between January 2003 - January 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. Patient age, sex, symptoms, histopathological, surgical procedures and treatment outcomes were evaluated. Results: The most common complaint was shortness of breath, while 25 patients were asymptomatic. Thoracotomy and mass enucleation in 29 patients (%49,15, thoracotomy and wedge resection in 18 patients (%30.5, VATS and wedge resection in 4 patients (%6.77, thoracotomy and upper lobectomy in 4 patients (%6.77, thoracotomy and lower lobectomy in 2 patients (%3.38 and left upper lobe segmentectomy in 1 patient (%1.69 and right upper bronchial sleeve resection in 1 patient were performed. The postoperative pathology of lesions examined and diagnosis were chondroid hamartoma in 28 , pulmonary hamartoma in 20 , hamartoma chondrolypomatous in 11 and the bronchial hamartoma in 2 . No mortality was observed intraoperatively. Discussion: Although hamartomas are benign , diagnosis should be made because it can be confused with lung cancer. Definitive diagnosis and treatment can be performed successfully through VATS in primarily appropriate cases with minimal morbidity or thoracotomy or endobronchial treatment.\n\nEccrine Angiomatous Hamartoma in an Adolescent\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPimpa Tantanasrigul\n\n2015-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Eccrine angiomatous hamartoma is a rare hamartoma that usually affects childhood and adolescence.

Hypothalamic hamartoma is a rate tumor. The onset of symptoms is in infancy and early childhood. Clinical symptoms are composed of convulsive seizures, laughing spells and precocious puberty. CT finding of hypothalamic hamartoma is a mass in the suprasellar and interpeduncular cisterns which has the same density as the surrounding normal brain. The mass is not enhanced by injection of the contrast material and is easily differentiated from other masses in the suprasellar region.

There is a rare association between splenic hamartomas and hematological abnormalities with, to our knowledge, only 24 reported cases in the English literature. Patients and methods. We report a case of a splenic hamartoma in a 14-year-old boy associated with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, multiple lobular capillary hemangiomas of the skin, hypertension, and anemia. Following imaging with ultrasonography, MRI, and nuclear scans, a hamartoma was suspected, but malignancy could not be excluded. The lesion was removed by partial splenectomy, and pathological examination confirmed the presence of a red pulp splenic hamartoma. Results. The renal, hematological, and dermatological abnormalities resolved following removal of the splenic hamartoma. This is the first reported case of a splenic hamartoma associated with renal, cutaneous, and hematological abnormalities and only the second reported case of a symptomatic splenic hamartoma treated by partial splenectomy.

Considering the high incidence rates of penile cancer in some countries, a large international study was designed to evaluate the presence of HPV, its genotype distribution, and its association with histologic types of penile cancer. In this international review of >900 cases, we found a group of highly distinct papillary neoplasms composed of basophilic cells resembling urothelial tumors but frequently associated with HPV. Macroscopically, tumors were exophytic or exoendophytic. Microscopically, there was a papillomatous pattern of growth with a central fibrovascular core and small basophilic cells lining the papillae. Positivity for HPV was present in 11 of 12 tumors (92%). Single genotypes found were HPV-16 in 9 tumors and HPV-51 in 1 tumor. Multiple genotypes (HPV-16 and HPV-45) were present in another case. Overexpression of p16 was observed in all cases. Uroplakin-III was negative in all cases. The differential diagnosis was with basaloid, warty-basaloid, warty, and papillary squamous cell carcinoma and with urothelial carcinomas. Local excision (4 cases), circumcision (3 cases), or partial penectomy (5 cases) were preferred treatment choices. Tumor thickness ranged from 1 to 15 mm (average, 7 mm). Two patients with tumors invading 11 and 15 mm into the corpus spongiosum developed inguinal nodal metastasis. Of 11 patients followed up (median 48 mo), 7 were alive with no evidence of metastatic disease, 3 died from causes other than penile cancer, and another died postoperatively. This morphologically distinct tumor probably represents a papillary variant of basaloid carcinomas (papillary-basaloid carcinomas). Unlike typical basaloid carcinomas, the overall prognosis was excellent. However, deeply invasive tumors were associated with regional nodal metastasis indicating a potential for tumor\n\nMR appearance of hypothalamic hamartoma\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHahn, F.J.; Leibrock, L.G.; Huseman, C.A.; Makos, M.M.\n\n1988-02-01\n\nHypothalamic hamartoma is the most common detectable cerebral lesion causing precocious puberty. Two histologically confirmed cases were studied by computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. T2 weighted, sagittal MR images were superior to CT in delineating the tumor from surrounding grey matter. The lesion was isointense to grey matter on T1 weighted images allowing exclusion of other hypothalamic tumors. MR will undoubtedly become the imaging modality of choice in the detection of hypothalamic hamartoma.\n\nRadiological features of a symptomatic splenic hamartoma\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nThompson, S.E.; Walsh, E.A.; Cramer, B.C.; Pushpanathan, C.C.; Hollett, P.; Ingram, L.; Price, D.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nSymptomatic splenic hamartomas are rare in the pediatric age group, with only four previous reports in the literature.

We report a case of a large symptomatic splenic hamartoma in a 14-year-old girl who presented with splenomegaly, pancytopenia and growth retardation. A solid mass with multiple punctate foci resembling calcifications was seen on US. The mass was heterogeneous and better demarcated on enhanced CT. Radiocolloid scintigraphy demonstrated uptake within the lesion, but less than that of normal spleen. The mass was isointense relative to normal splenic tissue on T1-weighted MRI (0.5 T) and of increased intensity with T2 weighting. At splenectomy, a red pulp hamartoma was identified, which contained nodules of hyalinization and necrosis thought to account for the punctate foci seen on US. (orig.).

To assess the MR imaging characteristics, presenting symptoms, age and nerve distribution of fibrolipomatous hamartoma. Design. A computer search was performed of the term fibrolipomatous hamartoma through the musculoskeletal section MR imaging results at our institution from June 7, 1996 to January 21, 1998 followed by a search of the terms lipomatous hamartoma, median nerve, surrounding fat, increased fatty signal, coaxial, and neuroma. MR images and medical files were retrospectively reviewed by two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists for imaging characteristics, nerve and age distribution as well as for history of trauma. In addition three consultation cases from outside institutions were added for determination of image characteristics. Results. Ten fibrolipomatous hamartomas were identified: eight in the median nerve, one in the ulnar nerve and one in the sciatic nerve. Mean age was 32.3 years (range 4-75 years, SD 21 years). Imaging characteristics were serpiginous low-intensity structures representing thickened nerve fascicles, surrounded by evenly distributed fat, high signal intensity on T1-weighted sequences and low signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. The amount of fat varied; however, distribution in eight cases (80%) was predominantly between nerve fibers rather than surrounding them peripherally. All had a coaxial-cable-like appearance on axial planes and a spaghetti-like appearance on coronal planes that was not seen in any other type of median nerve abnormality imaged during the study period. Conclusion. The MR imaging characteristics of fibrolipomatous hamartoma are pathognomonic, obviating the need for biopsy for diagnosis.

They can be differentiated from squamous cell carcinomas by their distinct clinical and histopathological features. Methods: 45 year old female patient presented with extra oral exophytic mass and intra-oral ulcerative lesion on right buccal mucosa and vestibule. The patient was referred for routine blood examination and radiography followed by incisional biopsy. The biopsy specimen was fixed, processed and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin for further microscopic examination. Results: On microscopic examination basaloid cells were seen proliferating along with dysplastic squamous cells in the connective tissue stroma. Conclusion: Based on the histopathological findings a diagnosis of â²Basaloid squamous cell carcinomaâ² was made. The patient was referred to department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery for excision of the lesion followed by radiotherapy.\n\nHamartoma cÃ­stico retrorretal\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCleverson Winston de Liz Medeiros\n\nFull Text Available A 32-year-old woman was referred to our institution for a pelvic mass. She was asymptomatic and was found to have a mass on rectal examination. Magnetic resonance showed a large solid-cystic mass and the patient underwent complete surgical excision with pathologic findings suggesting retrorectal cyst-hamartoma. Tailgut cysts (or retrorectal cystic hamartomas are rare congenital lesions settled in the retrorectal (presacral space. They are made up of cysts lined by multiple types of epithelium, often predominantly mucin-secreting. The lesion requires complete surgical excision to prevent complications of recurrence, infection or carcinomatous degeneration.\n\nHypothalamic hamartoma associated with precocious puberty: Case report\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBae, Won Kyong; Kim, Pyo Nuyn; Kim, Il Young; Lee, Byoung Ho; Lee, Kyeong Seok; Bae, Hack Gun; Yun, Il Gyu\n\n1989-01-01\n\nHamartoma of the hypothalamic area is a well recognized cause of central precocious puberty.

The pathogenesis is still poorly understood and breast hamartoma is not a well-known disorder, so its diagnosis is underestimated by clinicians and pathologists. This study was designed to present our experience with breast hamartoma, along with a literature review. METHOD: We reviewed the demographic data, pathologic analyses and imaging and results of patients diagnosed with breast hamartoma between December 2003 and September 2013. RESULTS: In total, 27 cases of breast hamartoma operated in the Ankara University Medicine Faculty's Department of General Surgery were included in the study. All patients were female and the mean age was 41.8Â±10.8 years. The mean tumor size was 3.9Â±2.7 cm. Breast ultrasound was performed on all patients before surgery. The most common additional lesion was epithelial hyperplasia (22.2%. Furthermore, lobular carcinoma in situ was identified in one case and invasive ductal carcinoma was observed in another case. Immunohistochemical staining revealed myoid hamartoma in one case (3.7%. CONCLUSION: Breast hamartomas are rare benign lesions that may be underdiagnosed because of the categorization of hamartomas as fibroadenomas by pathologists. Pathologic examinations can show variability from one case to another. Thus, the true incidence may be higher than the literature indicates.\n\nA Rare Case of Recurrent Myoid Hamartoma Mimicking Malignancy: Imaging Appearances\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKo, Myung Su; Jung, Won Sang; Choi, Hyun Joo; Cha, Eun Suk\n\n2010-01-01\n\nMyoid hamartoma is an uncommon type of breast hamartoma and its recurrence is very rare. We report the imaging appearance of an unusual case of recurrent myoid hamartoma of the breast mimicking malignancy in a 43-year-old woman. Although the mammographic and ultrasonographic findings have long been described in the literature, MR finding with a dynamic study has not, to the best of our knowledge, been reported previously\n\nBreast hamartomas â Differential consideration in slow developing breast asymmetry\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSarah Cazorla\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Breast hamartoma is a relatively rare entity with an incidence of approximately 0.7% of benign breast masses. Hamartomas may become large and cause breast asymmetry. Hamartomas, although benign, have the potential for malignant transformation and should be treated or monitored closely when encountered especially if microcalcifications or speculated lesions are seen within the mass. The following cases demonstrate two of the largest documented harmartomas since they were recognized as distinct entities in the early 1970's. Proper referral to the appropriate specialists can result in earlier detection and resolution of symptoms.\n\nHamartoma fibroso infantil: lesÃ£o volumosa com envolvimento de plexo braquil Children's fibrous hamartoma: extensive injury involving brachial plexus\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLisieux Eyer de Jesus\n\n2006-01-01\n\nFull Text Available OBJETIVO: Apresentar um caso de hamartoma fibroso da infÃ¢ncia em lactente ressecado tardiamente e se apresentando como lesÃ£o extensa, com envolvimento de elementos vasculares e neurais do plexo braquial.

METHODS: Clinical case study and pertinent literature review. RESULTS: Male child, with right axillary irregular tumoral mass, of which onset occurred at 2 months of age and related to BCG vaccine application, being treated with anti-tuberculosis agents, not responding to therapy. Upon biopsy, the injury was diagnosed as childrenâs fibrous hamartoma, and, after a fast growing period, was submitted to total surgical exeresis. CONCLUSION: The juvenile fibrous hamartoma is a rare benign tumor, typically occurring within the first year of life in boys, most commonly located at axillary gap.

The lesion presents as a slowly growing mass that is largely composed of fat and fibrous tissue with epineural and perineural proliferation. Although such tumors are rare, it is important for physicians to be aware of this disorder and recognize its signs because patients may present with what appears to be a benign skin tumor. If left untreated, the lesion may result in nerve compression and eventually lead to the development of peripheral neuropathy. Here, we present two cases of lipofibromatous hamartomas that presented over the ankle and dorsal foot, respectively, that appeared as simple and benign tumors upon initial inspection. Patients were without symptoms or neurological deficits, and diagnosis was not made until histopathological examination of the biopsied specimens. We also discuss the clinical manifestations, histopathological findings, and the management of lipofibromatous hamartomas.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging of hypothalamic hamartoma\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKanazawa, Junichi; Uozumi, Tohru; Sakoda, Katsuaki; Yamanaka, Masami; Kihara, Mikio; Nishi, Yoshikazu; Kagawa, Yoshihiro; Kajima, Toshio.\n\n1988-05-01\n\nMagnetic resonance (MR) findings of two patients with a hypothalamic hamartoma are discussed. The two girls showed clinical symptoms and endocrinological signs of precocious puberty. MR imaging was of diagnostic value superior to that of CT in the demonstration of the characteristic location of this tumor and relationships to the neighboring structures because of its multi-dimensional utility. Although it has been reported that CT showed this lesion as isodense to the grey matter with and without injection of contrast medium, MR imaging depicted the lesion as a high signal intensity area on T2-weighted images in both patients. MR imaging is a useful method for the evaluation of the hypothalamic hamartoma.\n\nCongenital fibrous hamartoma of the knee\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nArioni, Cesare; Bellini, Carlo; Risso, Francesco Maria; Scopesi, Fabio; Serra, Giovanni; Oddone, Mauro; Toma, Paolo; Nozza, Paolo\n\n2006-01-01\n\nA full-term male infant presented at birth with a hard swelling of the left knee.

This is not a malignant tumor, and it grows at the same rate as the surrounding tissues. We report a case of a 27-year-old male patient who presented with mild dysphagia and foreign body sensation in the throat of 1-year duration. On examination, there was a mucosal fold on the medial wall of pyriform sinus lateral to aryepiglottic fold that was acting like a sump where food particles used to get collected. Patient underwent microlaryngeal excision of the mucosal fold, and histopathological examination revealed features of hamartoma.\n\nSolid solitary hamartoma of the spleen\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGrubor Nikica\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Introduction. Hamartoma of the spleen is a rare, sometimes asymptomatic similar to hemangioma benign tumor of the spleen, which, owing to the new diagnostic imaging methods, is discovered with increasing frequency. It appears as solitary or multiple tumorous lesions. Case Outline. We present a 48-year-old woman in whom, during the investigation for Helicobacter pylori gastric infection and rectal bleeding, with ultrasonography, a mass 6.5Ã6.5 cm in diameter was discovered by chance within the spleen. Splenectomy was performed due to suspected lymphoma of the spleen. On histology, tumor showed to be of mixed cellular structure, with areas without white pulp, at places with marked dilatation of sinusoids and capillaries to the formation of âblood lakesâ between which broad hypercellular Billrothâs zones were present. Extramedullary hematopoiesis was found focally. The cells that covered vascular spaces were CD34+ and CD31+ and CD8- and CD21-. Conclusion. Hamartoma has to be taken into consideration always when well circumscribed hypervascular tumor within the spleen is found, particularly in children. Although the diagnosis of hamartoma may be suspected preoperatively, the exact diagnosis is established based on histological and immunohystochemistry examinations. Treatment is most often splenectomy and rarely a partial splenectomy is possible, which is recommended particularly in children.\n\nLarge mammary hamartoma with focal invasive ductal carcinoma\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPervatikar Suneet\n\n2009-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Mammary hamartomas are uncommon benign lesions rarely associated with malignancy. We report a case of a 25-year-old female patient presenting with a lump in the left breast. Fine needle aspiration cytology showed features of invasive ductal carcinoma along with normal benign glands that were mistaken for normal breast tissue. However, the mastectomy specimen revealed the malignant mass within a larger hamartomatous mass. Mammary hamartomas are benign lesions but, on exceedingly rare occasions, they may be involved by incidental, coexisting carcinoma, as illustrated in this case report.\n\nNOVEL PRERETINAL HAIR PIN-LIKE VESSEL IN RETINAL ASTROCYTIC HAMARTOMA WITH VITREOUS HEMORRHAGE.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSoeta, Megumi; Arai, Yusuke; Takahashi, Hidenori; Fujino, Yujiro; Tanabe, Tatsuro; Inoue, Yuji; Kawashima, Hidetoshi\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTo report a case of retinal astrocytic hamartoma with vitreous hemorrhage and a hair pin-like vessel adhering to a posterior vitreous membrane. A 33-year-old man with a retinal astrocytic hamartoma presented with vitreous hemorrhage 5 times. Multimodal imaging, including fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and B-mode ultrasonography. Multimodal imaging demonstrated a novel hair pin-like vessel that adhered to the posterior vitreous membrane.

Hamartomas are extrapleural soft tissue lesions that cause rib expansion and destruction and appear on imaging as cystic areas with fluid levels and calcification. They can cause scoliosis, pressure on the neighboring lung parenchyma and mediastinal displacement. While conservative treatment is recommended in asymptomatic cases, growing lesions require surgical excision. Case Report In this report, we present the imaging findings in a 3-month-old infant that presented with a firm swelling in the chest wall and was histopathologically confirmed to have a bilateral multifocal hamartoma. Conclusions Radiological imaging methods are important for accurate diagnosis of this very rare condition that can be confused with a malignancy.

We report three patients with presumed congenital simple RPE hamartoma, and describe the enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT and fundus autofluorescence (FAF findings. Methods: Two patients were asymptomatic; one had an intraocular foreign body in addition to the hamartoma. All had a similar jet black, elevated lesion in the macula, sparing the fovea. EDI-OCT showed a characteristic hyperreflective layer with complete optical shadowing of the deeper layers; FAF showed pronounced hypoautofluorescence of the lesion. Conclusion: Multimodal imaging with FAF and EDI-OCT can help to differentiate simple RPE hamartoma from similar RPE lesions, and may serve as a useful adjunct to clinical diagnosis of this rare tumor. We present the second largest series of presumed congenital simple RPE hamartoma, and â to the best of our knowledge â the first report of FAF findings of this tumor.\n\nExpression of E-cadherin and Î²-catenin in basaloid and conventional squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity: are potential prognostic markers?\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHanemann, JoÃ£o Adolfo Costa; Oliveira, Denise Tostes; Nonogaki, Suely; Nishimoto, InÃªs Nobuko; Carli, Marina Lara de; Landman, Gilles; Kowalski, Luiz Paulo\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBasaloid squamous cell carcinoma presents with a preference for the head and neck region, and shows a distinct aggressive behavior, with frequent local recurrences, regional and distant metastasis.

Methods: The mammogram of 10 cases of mammary hamartoma proved by pathology were retrospectively analyzed. The patients aged from 25 to 56 years with an average age of (40.1 Â± 5.4 years ). Results: According to the fat/parenchyma ratio, the mammgraphic manifestations of mammary hamartoma were divided into three types. 2 highly radiolucent lesions were classified as fat type, 2 lesions with high density were classified as dense type and the rest 6 lesions were the mixed type composed of adipose and glandular tissue. The mixed type was the most distinctive, while the dense or rat type was easy to be misdiagnosed. Accurate diagnosis was made in 6 cases out of, and the overall diagnostic accuracy was 60%. Conclusion: Mammography is the choice of diagnosis, and an accurate diagnosis will help surgical planning.

Approximately 85% of affected children present before the age of 3 years and less than 5% present after the age of 5 years. Although spontaneous regression has been reported in this benign tumor, most mesenchymal hamartomas gradually increase in size and can reach enormous proportions. We present an atypical case of mesenchymal hamartoma in a 12-year-old boy. The boy's age and presence of calcifications on CT demonstrate a unique presentation of this rare entity.

Malignant transformation can rarely arise within neurocristic hamartomas. Up to date, there has been only 1 series of 7 cases of malignant neurocristic hamartomas (MNHs), with 3 cases that developed metastases. We present the histology and clinical course of 3 additional cases of MNH, 2 of which were metastatic. CD117 was strongly positive in all cases with available archival materials--the tumors and background neurocristic hamartoma of 3 cases, and 1 lymph node metastasis; however, KIT sequencing for exons 11, 13, 17, and 18 was negative. Mutational analyses of recurrent mutations of 17 cancer genes, including BRAF and KIT, were also negative. Although our series is small, KIT overexpression in MNH does not seem to correlate with gene mutation. The lack of BRAF, NRAS, GNAQ, and KIT mutations seems to support the notion that MNH may be distinct from conventional melanoma and from other dermal melanomas, such as malignant blue nevi and melanoma arising in congenital nevi.\n\nGelastic seizures associated with hypothalamic hamartomas.

Tellez-Zenteno1, Cesar Serrano-Almeida2, Farzad Moien-Afshari11Division of Neurology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada; 2Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, CanadaAbstract: Gelastic seizures are epileptic events characterized by bouts of laughter. Laughter-like vocalization is usually combined with facial contraction in the form of a smile. Autonomic features such as flushing, tachycardia, and altered respiration are widely recognized. Conscious state may not be impaired, although this is often difficult to asses particularly in young children. Gelastic seizures have been associated classically to hypothalamic hamartomas, although different extrahypothalamic localizations have been described. Hypothalamic hamartomas are rare congenital lesions presenting with the classic triad of gelastic epilepsy, precocious puberty and developmental delay. The clinical course of patients with gelastic seizures associated with hypothalamic hamartomas is progressive, commencing with gelastic seizures in infancy, deteriorating into more complex seizure disorder resulting in intractable epilepsy. Electrophysiological, radiological, and pathophysiological studies have confirmed the intrinsic epileptogenicity of the hypothalamic hamartoma. Currently the most effective surgical approach is the trancallosal anterior interforniceal approach, however newer approaches including the endoscopic and other treatment such as radiosurgery and gamma knife have been used with success. This review focuses on the syndrome of gelastic seizures associated with hypothalamic hamartomas, but it also reviews other concepts such as status gelasticus and some aspects of gelastic seizures in other locations.Keywords: epilepsy, gelastic seizures, epilepsy surgery, hypothalamic hamartoma, intractable epilepsy\n\nA case of fibrolipomatous hamartoma of the median nerve with macrodactyly\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSathish Arakeri\n\n2012-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Fibrolipomatous hamartoma of nerve is a tumor-like lipomatous process principally involving affecting young persons.

Leiomyomatous hamartomas (LHs) are rare in the oral cavity and commonly seen in the Japanese and less than 40 cases have been reported in the Japanese and English literature. The clinical differential diagnoses are irritational (traumatic) fibroma and congenital epulis. It has to be differentiated histopathologically from its neoplastic counterparts and mesenchymomas. Hence, we report such a case of LHs, which presented as a sessile gingival growth occurring in the midline in a 15-year-old girl. The final diagnosis was based on the histopathological appearance which was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of various markers.

They are very uncommon, and most are found incidentally during upper gastrointestinal series or esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The lesions tend to be asymptomatic, but patients may present with symptoms of duodenal obstruction or hemorrhage secondary to ulceration. Histologically, a Brunner's gland hamartoma consists of the components of Brunner's gland cells, as well as glandular, adipose and muscle cells. In this study, we report the case of a 30-year-old man who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and obstructive symptoms due to a giant Brunner's gland hamartoma in the duodenal bulb. The hamartoma was successfully removed by endoscopic resection. No significant complications were observed. Microscopically, the lesion was found to be entirely composed of variable Brunner's glands and adipocytes.\n\nHamartomas of the tuber cinereum\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDiebler, C; Ponsot, G\n\n1983-05-01\n\nThe hamartoma of the tuber cinereum, a midline dysraphic syndrome, corresponds to a mass of normal neuronal tissue implanted in the area of the mamillary bodies.

The aim of the present study was to compare the color fundus photography, infrared imaging (IFG), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the detection rate of retinal hamartoma in patients with TSC. This study included 11 patients (22 eyes) with TSC, who underwent color fundus photography, IFG, and spectral-domain OCT to detect retinal hamartomas. TSC1 and TSC2RESULTS: The mean age of the 11 patients was 8.0 Â± 2.1 years. The mean spherical equivalent was -0.55 Â± 1.42 D by autorefraction with cycloplegia. In 11 patients (22 eyes), OCT, infrared fundus photography, and color fundus photography revealed 26, 18, and 9 hamartomas, respectively. The predominant hamartoma was type I (55.6%). All the hamartomas that detected by color fundus photography or IFG can be detected by OCT. Among the methods of color fundus photography, IFG, and OCT, the OCT has higher detection rate for retinal hamartoma in TSC patients; therefore, OCT might be promising for the clinical diagnosis of TSC.\n\nHamartoma of the urinary bladder: case report and review of the literature\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBrancatelli, G.; Midiri, M.; Sparacia, G.; Martino, R.; Lagalla, R.; Rizzo, G.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nBladder hamartoma is a rare benign entity with only eight cases reported in the literature thus far, and whose general imaging features have not, to our knowledge, been previously discussed. The purpose of this report is to review the literature and to discuss the imaging findings in one case of bladder hamartoma where US features were those of an inhomogeneous solid mass with an unechogenic center, which was in accordance with the CT findings of a soft tissue mass with central inhomogeneous enhancement due to central necrosis.

The face, neck, and scalp are the most frequently affected sites, although lesions may occur on any site of the body. Histologically, the disorder is characterized by mucin deposition in the follicular epithelium. The condition is frequently divided into primary and secondary forms, with the latter form frequently associated with mycosis fungoides. In this case report, we describe a child with follicular mucinosis of the back and trunk and discuss the clinical variants, histopathological pattern, and treatment options.\n\nBasaloid carcinoma of the pancreas--clinicopathological presentation and oncogenetic snapshot of a rare entity.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSzasz, A Marcell; Szirtes, Ildiko; Tihanyi, Balazs; Barkaszi, Bernadett; Baranyai, Zsolt; Tihanyi, Tibor; Harsanyi, Laszlo; Timar, Jozsef; Kulka, Janina\n\n2015-02-01\n\nWe report a case of basaloid pancreatic carcinoma with clinical, pathological, and genomic data. The 73-year-old male patient had jaundice, acholic stool, diarrhea, weight loss, and a large, painless gall bladder. His GGT was highly elevated. The pancreatic head contained a tumor, which was resected by partial pancreatoduodenectomy with pancreato-gastric anastomosis, cholecystectomy, and lymphadenectomy. On gross examination, a 3.8-cm white firm nodule was found, which microscopically was composed of basaloid cell nests with a less than usual desmoplastic stromal background and focally PANIN. Immunohistochemical profile displayed strong CK5/6, CK19, p63, EGFR, vimentin, and evident CK14 expression and absence of expression of CK7, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and BRCA1. A high Ki-67 index and p53 expression were noted. Sequencing of the most frequent 46 oncogenes with ionTorrent (AmpliSeq PCR) method identified PIK3CA, KRAS, and TP53 genes as drivers and variants of the FGFR3, PDGFRA, KIT, KDR, EGFR, RET, and ATM genes. The tumor we report displays histopathological appearances similar to the previously described case and a genomic landscape fitting to the general population of pancreatic carcinomas. We hypothesize that this tumor may belong to the group of DNA damage repair-deficient pancreatic carcinoma subgroup.\n\nBasal cell carcinoma vs basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the skin: an immunohistochemical reappraisal.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWebb, David V; Mentrikoski, Mark J; Verduin, Lindsey; Brill, Louis B; Wick, Mark R\n\n2015-04-01\n\nTypical cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are morphologically dissimilar. It is well known, however, that poorly differentiated SCC may assume a basaloid phenotype, complicating the histologic distinction between these 2 neoplasms. Selected immunohistochemical stains have been used in the past to aid in that differential diagnosis. In the current study, additional markers were evaluated to determine whether they would be helpful in that regard. Twenty-nine cases of metatypical (squamoid) BCC (MBCC) and 25 examples of basaloid SCC (BSCC) were studied using the antibodies Ber-EP4 and MOC-31 as well as a plant lectin preparation from Ulex europaeus I (UEA-1). The resulting immunostains were interpreted independently by 3 pathologists, and the results showed that MBCCs demonstrated strong and diffuse staining for Ber-EP4 (25/29) and MOC-31 (29/29). In contrast, BSCCs tended to be only sporadically reactive for both markers (4/25 and 1/25 cases, respectively). Labeling for UEA-1 was observed in almost all BSCCs (24/25), but only 6 of 29 cases of MBCC showed limited, focal staining with that lectin. These data suggest that MOC-31 is a useful marker in the specified differential diagnosis, especially when used together with UEA-1. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

There are few documented cases in the literature of retinal hamartomas (astrocytomas) with aggressive progression in the context of this disease. A report is presented on a case of a 31 year-old male with unknown history of ophthalmic or systemic conditions, who referred to a history of 6 months of blurred vision in his right eye. This was caused by a unilateral retinal hamartoma due to an undiagnosed tuberous sclerosis. Multidisciplinary management, with the cooperation of Internal Medicine and the Oncology Department, is needed in these cases, as well as genetic counselling for affected patients. Complications are directly related to increased tumour size. Treatment does not seem to have any influence on the natural history of the disease.

Case Report: A 60-year-old man was presented to the Otolaryngology Department with progressive dyspnoea and dysphagia to solids for over a period of 1 week. Direct laryngoscopy revealed a tumour at the laryngeal aspect of the epiglottis, which prolapsed into the laryngeal inlet each time the patient inspired. This resulted in an inspiratory stridor despite adequate glottic opening and normal mobility of the vocal cords. Â Conclusion:Â Therefore, in cases where a ball-valve lesion causes intermittent life-threatening airway obstruction, BSCC of the larynx, though rare, must be considered as a differential diagnosis.\n\nBile Duct Hamartomas: US, CT and MR Findings in Eight Patients, Focusing on the US Findings\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAhn, Jae Hong; Kim, Min Jeong; Kim, Pyo Nyun; Ha, Hyun Kwon; Lee, Moon Gyu; Han, Heon; Kim, Sam Soo; Jang, Kyung Mi\n\n2005-01-01\n\nTo describe the US, CT and MR findings in eight patients with bile duct hamartomas. Bile duct hamartomas were diagnosed in eight patients (5 men and 3 women; age range, 41-69 years; mean age, 56 years) by liver biopsy. The US, CT and MR findings were retrospectively reviewed. Ultrasonographic ally, the bile duct hamartomas presented diffuse inhomogeneous and coarse echo texture with focal lesions, including bright spotty echoes or small hyperechoic nodules (n=7), hypoechoic nodules (n=7) and comet-tail echo (n=3) in seven patients. 16 of the 39 definable hypoechoic nodules that ranged in size from 5 mm to 16mm showed posterior enhancement. CT revealed innumerable hypodense nodules measuring 2-5 mm (n=3), 2-13 mm (n=1), 2-15 mm (n=2) and 2-18 mm (n=1) in seven patients. They were usually irregular in shape and showed no enhancement, but became more apparent after the administration of intravenous contrast medium. The innumerable hypodense nodules on enhanced CT scans were uniformly (n=5) or non uniformly (n=2) distributed throughout the liver. In four patients, MR images showed multiple small cyst-like lesions 2-13 mm in diameter. These small cyst like lesions were much more apparent on T2-weighted images or MR cholangiography. The diagnosis was made by either core-needle or wedge biopsy. In one patient, a small single lesion on the liver surface was not visible on the imaging studies. Pathologic examination revealed multiple bile duct hamartomas of varying size or microhamartomas. Although the bile duct hamartomas on CT and MR presented as numerous intrahepatic, small cyst-like lesions, they on US showed variable findings consisting of inhomogeneous and coarse echo texture with focal lesions, including bright spotty echoes or small hyperechoic nodules, hypoechoic nodules, and comet-tail echoes\n\nFollicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHayashi, D.; Lee, J.C.; Devenney-Cakir, B.; Zaim, S.; Ounadjela, S.; Solal-Celigny, P.; Juweid, M.; Guermazi, A.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFollicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is a unique subtype of NHL, which is indolent, incurable with a high prevalence of residual mass after treatment, and may transform to more aggressive NHL. The aim of this review is to (1) describe the histological and flow cytometry characteristics of follicular NHL; (2) introduce the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index 2 (FLIPI-2), which allows better treatment selection and patient stratification for clinical trials; (3) illustrate the classic and atypical ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron-emission tomography (PET)/CT appearance of follicular NHL; and (4) characterize the appearance of nodal and extranodal follicular NHL with pathological correlation. Imaging is essential in every step of the management of patients with follicular lymphoma. Overall survival is improved with better predictive tools and new targeted biological therapies. Radiologists should be aware of possible active residual mass, indolent recurrence, transformation, and association with other primary cancers in patients treated for follicular lymphoma.\n\nFollicular contact dermatitis revisited: A review emphasizing neomycin-associated follicular contact dermatitis\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCohen, Philip R\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFollicular contact dermatitis clinically presents as individual papules that include a central hair follicle. Pathologic features involve the follicle and the surrounding dermis: spongiosis and vesicle formation of the follicular epithelium associated with perifollicular and perivascular lymphocytic inflammation. Using the PubMed database, an extensive literature search was performed on follicular contact dermatitis and neomycin. Relevant papers were reviewed and the clinical and pathologic features, the associated chemicals (including a more detailed description of neomycin), the hypothesized pathogenesis, and the management of follicular contact dermatitis were described. Several agents-either as allergens or irritants-have been reported to elicit follicular contact dermatitis. Several hypotheses have been suggested for the selective involvement of the follicles in follicular contact dermatitis: patient allergenicity, characteristics of the agent, vehicle containing the agent, application of the agent, and external factors. The differential diagnosis of follicular contact dermatitis includes not only recurrent infundibulofolliculitis, but also drug eruption, mite infestation, viral infection, and dermatoses that affect hair follicles. The primary therapeutic intervention for follicular contact dermatitis is withdrawal of the causative agent; treatment with a topical corticosteroid preparation may also promote resolution of the dermatitis. In conclusion, follicular contact dermatitis may be secondary to allergens or irritants; topical antibiotics, including neomycin, may cause this condition. Several factors may account for the selective involvement of the hair follicle in this condition. Treatment of the dermatitis requires withdrawal of the associated topical agent; in addition, topical corticosteroids may be helpful to promote resolution of lesions.

Lipofibromatous hamartoma is associated with pain and sensory and/or motor deficits in the area of innervation of the affected nerve. This report describes a rare case of LFH of the plantar nerve. A 48-year-old woman presented to our outpatient orthopedic clinic with pain and a burning sensation on her left foot. The patient had a history of Morton's neuroma and had undergone a tarsal tunnel operation 2 years earlier at another center. None of her symptoms was alleviated by two previous operations. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast revealed tenosynovitis of the flexor hallucis longus tendon and signal changes at deep tissue planes of the foot at the levels of the second and third toes, on the dorsal site and subcutaneous soft-tissue planes, suggesting edema and Morton's neuroma. The lesion was excised under spinal anesthesia, and histopathologic examination of the specimen revealed a diagnosis of LFH. The patient was discharged without any symptoms and her foot was normal at 8-month outpatient follow-up, with no indications of postoperative complications and/or recurrence.\n\nBasaloid large cell lung carcinoma presenting as cutaneous metastasis at the colostomy site after abdominoperineal resection for rectal carcinoma.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSabater-Marco, Vicente; GarcÃ­a-GarcÃ­a, JosÃ© Angel; Roig-Vila, JosÃ© Vicente\n\n2013-08-01\n\nThe occurrence of a tumor at the colostomy site after abdominoperineal resection for rectal carcinoma is rare and it may be related to a previously resected carcinoma or another primary tumor. We report a 61-year-old man who developed an ulcerated skin nodule at her colostomy site 6 years after resection of a rectal adenocarcinoma. Histopathologically, the skin nodule was composed of atypical large and pleomorphic cells with high mitotic rate and they were arranged in nests and within lymphatic channels in the dermis. The neoplastic cells were immunoreactive for cytokeratin (CK) AE1/3, CK7, CK34ÃE12, epithelial membrane antigen and vimentin while detection of human papillomavirus and Epstein-Barr virus DNA was negative. A diagnosis of basaloid large cell carcinoma of pulmonary origin was suggested and it was confirmed by computed tomography-guided fine needle aspiration of a right subpleural mass. A metastatic tumor at the colostomy site is an exceptional finding and may be the first manifestation of lung cancer, especially if it consist of pleomorphic large cells with high mitotic rate and basaloid immunophenotype.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue treatment was started at 6 years of age and his pubertal signs were suppressed. At 9 years of age, the patient was emotionally unstable, aggressive, and antisocial. He had severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behavior and conduct disorder. No seizure activity was observed. GnRH analogue treatment was discontinued for 8 months from 9 years and 4 months of age due to his mother's illness. During this period sexual urges were observed. Treatment with daily methylphenidate markedly improved his behavioral problems. However, his sexual urges were not suppressed until 3 months after the GnRH analogue treatment was restarted. The present case is unique because the patient's behavioral problems were observed despite the parahypothalamic type of HH and absence of seizures. This case is also rare because behavioral problems were observed without seizures, and no ADHD cases with hamartoma have been reported previously. Recently, clinical studies have described an association between psychiatric morbidity, including ADHD, and hyperandrogenism disorders. Our patient's ADHD-like symptoms might be due to hyperandrogenism. In such cases, GnRH analogue with methylphenidate could be effective for improving ADHD-like symptoms. Copyright Â© 2015.

Miller\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Introduction: Hamartomas involving the floor of the fourth ventricle and cerebellum are rare, but can be associated with medically recalcitrant hemifacial spasm. These lesions present early in the neonatal or infantile period and respond well to surgical excision. Case Report: A 3-month-old white male presented with recurrent left hemifacial spasm, left eye deviation, and absent movement of the extremities. The patient was found to have a left eccentric lesion in the floor of the fourth ventricle and cerebellum. The patient showed no improvement with medical therapy by 6 months of age. He was taken to the operating room for suboccipital craniotomy and removal of the posterior arch of C1 followed by intralesional recording of epileptogenic activity and gross total resection of the lesion. After histologic analysis, the lesion was determined to be ectopic cerebral tissue consistent with a hamartoma. Postoperative MRI showed complete removal of the lesion, and the patient exhibited complete remission of his hemifacial spasm and associated symptoms. Conclusions: Hamartomas involving the floor of the fourth ventricle can present with hemifacial spasm and respond well to surgical excision.

In culture, the treatment of FDC-B cell clusters (resembling to âex vivoâ germinal centers with Gap27 peptide, mimicking the 2nd extracellular loop of Cx43 protein, significantly impaired FDC-B cell cluster formation and cell survival. In untreated cultures of intact clusters, cell proliferation showed a moderate reduction. In tissues, Cx43 protein levels run parallel with the density of FDC both in reactive germinal centers and in malformed follicles of follicular lymphomas and showed strong upregulation in newly generated and/or degrading bi-/multinuclear FDC of rudimentary processes. However, the inverse correlation between Cx43 expression and B cell proliferation seen in reactive germinal centers was not detected in follicular lymphomas. Furthermore, Cx43 levels were not associated with either lymphoma grade or bone marrow involvement. Our results suggest that Cx43 channels are critical in FDC and âex vivoâ germinal center development and in the persistence of FDC in follicular lymphomas but do not affect tumor progression.\n\nDynamic computed tomography findings of atypical pulmonary hamartoma and it's pathologic correlations: A case report\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHong, Seung Baek; Jeong Yeon Joo Lee, Gee Won; Kim, Yeong Dae; Ahn, Hyo Yeong; Lee, Chang Hoon; Kim, Ah Rong; Lee, Ji Won [Medical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan (Korea, Republic of)\n\n2016-04-15\n\nWe present the dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) findings of atypical pulmonary hamartoma with a rare histologic pattern in a 20-year-old male. CT showed a 3.4 cm lobulated mass with a 'tip of the iceberg' appearance in the medium bronchus of the right lower lobe. Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated a heterogeneously and persistently enhancing mass. The CT Hounsfield unit (HU) measurements were: 17 HU pre-contrast, 32 HU at 1 minute, 44 HU at 2 minutes, 51 HU at 4 minutes, and 64 HU at 15 minutes. Pathologic examination after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery disclosed a pulmonary hamartoma with a predominant fibroblastic component.\n\nDisabling amnestic syndrome following stereotactic laser ablation of a hypothalamic hamartoma in a patient with a prior temporal lobectomy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSarah Zubkov\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available A 19-year-old man with cortical dysplasia and intractable focal seizures underwent a right temporal lobectomy. A hypothalamic hamartoma was subsequently recognized, and he then underwent MRI-guided stereotactic laser ablation. Unfortunately, he sustained damage to the bilateral medial mammillary bodies and suffered significant memory loss. We review laser ablation therapy for hypothalamic hamartomas and the anatomy of the memory network. We postulate that his persistent memory disorder resulted from a combination of the right temporal lobectomy and injury to the bilateral medial mammillary bodies.\n\nAdrenal hormones in human follicular fluid.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJimena, P; Castilla, J A; Peran, F; Ramirez, J P; Vergara, F; Molina, R; Vergara, F; Herruzo, A\n\n1992-11-01\n\nConsiderable evidence indicates that adrenal hormones may affect gonadal function. To assess the role of some adrenal hormones in human follicular fluid and their relationship with the ability of the oocyte to be fertilized and then to cleave in vitro, cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were measured in follicular fluid obtained at the time of oocyte recovery for in vitro fertilization from cycles stimulated by clomiphene citrate, human menopausal gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin. Thirty-six follicular fluid containing mature oocyte-corona-cumulus complexes and free of visible blood contamination were included in this study. There was no significant difference in follicular fluid dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentration between follicles with oocytes which did or did not fertilize (5.1 +/- 1.1 vs 5.8 +/- 2.0 mumol/l). However, follicular fluid from follicles whose oocytes were not fertilized had levels of cortisol significantly higher than those in follicular fluid from follicles containing successfully fertilized oocytes (406.0 +/- 75.9 vs 339.2 +/- 37.0 nmol/l; p < 0.005). No significant correlations were found between rates of embryo cleavage and cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone levels in follicular fluid. We conclude that cortisol levels in follicular fluid may provide an index of fertilization outcome, at least in stimulated cycles by clomiphene citrate, human menopausal gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin.\n\nHamartomas of the tuber cinereum\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGalanski, M.; Braemswig, J.H.; Korinthenberg, R.\n\n1986-03-01\n\nHamartomas of the tuber cinereum are tumour-like collections of normal tissue in abnormal location. They are benign lesions with slow or absent growth and without any tendency to neoplastic evolution. Due to their neurosecreting properties they usually cause precocious puberty. Further neuroendocrine disturbances, seizures, or psychoneurological symptoms may be associated in some cases. Cisternography and CT are the most conclusive radiologic procedures in almost all cases. The typical feature is a well circumscribed round-shaped isodense soft tissue mass without contrast enhancement. Usually the tumour is small, rarely exceeding 2 cm, in diameter. If CT diagnosis is not conclusive, examination in the coronal plane or CT cisternograph"
