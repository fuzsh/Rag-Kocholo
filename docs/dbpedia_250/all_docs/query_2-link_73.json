        "text": "This is my current statement of my very long-term research project. It will be a book exploring the history of the philosophical ideas that influenced the earliest development of text and image printing in Europe c. 1370-1440. This dynamo of change, including typography and engraving, which is collectively called \"printing\"-sometimes called the first industrial complex-is conventionally said to have arisen rather abruptly around 1445 and then rapidly spread down the Rhine and through Europe, with little constraint and with no evident conceptual framework from the previous phase of European culture. Early printing has long been studied from the points of view of history of technology, socio-cultural history, and economic history. But an approach through the history of ideas and intellectual history has not been attempted, with a couple of thin exceptions, and so will be almost completely new in the field. Yet we know that ideas, including abstract concepts, are highly dynamic, readily spreading great influence. My researches apply this principle to the period before the deployment of print through the historiographic methods of the history of ideas and intellectual history applied to very late Medieval and very early Renaissance concepts of nature and humankind. Impressum is not a history of the book or printing history or history of technology project; rather, it is an unconventional study of a fresh area in intellectual history and the history of philosophy that can extend and deepen book history, art history, Western cultural history, and the history of communication. The intellectual history questions about the inception of typography include: what conceptions contributed to make the attraction of replicative techniques so powerful in this period as to motivate the invention of new media? What ideas allowed for the experiments in craft technique that initiated the massive infusion of texts and images in Western culture beginning c. 1450? To address these questions, I examine the changes in several central philosophical ideas in this period prior to the first printed texts and how these ideas might have been taken up by the new technology. It is unlikely that many new fragments of early printing or pieces of printing equipment will be discovered, but philosophy and theology in the period is so massively documented that it can be a rich field for study of the invention of printing. Therefore I suggest that we approach this question of \"pre-print\" by observing the successive and branching ideas in late scholasticism that constellated in the invention and deployment of replicative technologies. Printing involved impress of the original of text, image, and data into copies by a cluster of technologies that ultimately created a system of storage, diffusion, and retrieval. Putting part of the origin of the age of printed communication into the context of philosophical ideas will show that at its start it involved, on the part of the person or persons who invented the craft and on the part of those who developed and used it, general moral and philosophical concepts.\n\nThis thesis introduces and discusses a new method for analysing printed type and applies it to 15th-century Venetian romans. It aims to review and improve the tra- ditional methods of type analysis employed in bibliographical research. It is based on photographic enlargements of printed type, on image editing and on detailed analysis of the letterforms. Comparisons of printers’ letterforms are made by means of overlaying images – a practice that clearly highlights differences and similarities among the letters. Drawing on printed matter held in Italian and British libraries, this new method is applied to four important samples of early Venetian type design, including Nicolas Jenson’s roman, which can safely be considered the prototype of all roman types up to the present. The historical extent of the research covers the last three decades of the 15th century and focuses on printing presses active in Venice and in the Venetian ter- ritories. Presses in the rest of Italy and throughout Europe that employed the Venetian types discussed in the thesis, both before and after 1500, are also taken into account. The thesis documents the trade of type material (cast type and matrices) and the extensive dissemination of certain types – areas which historians have generally ignored for this early period. It also documents the punchcutters’ ability to imitate existing types so closely that it can be very hard to distinguish them from their origi- nal models – a practice that has not been previously studied. This research is supported by an extensive apparatus of images of letterforms shown at different sizes of enlargement. It intends to provide new insights into the early development of roman types and aid bibliographical research by providing increasingly thorough information on the types in use. It also provides a method of type analysis that can be successfully applied to the productions of other printers and to other time periods. This new method allows the researcher to gain information from printed books that was not possible previously."
