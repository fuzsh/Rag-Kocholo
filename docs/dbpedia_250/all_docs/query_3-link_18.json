I am incredibly privileged to join a team that is led by two phenomenal coaches, Tracy Hamm and Val Henderson. I am excited to come into a program that is up and coming and is passionate about development as well as winning. I cannot go without expressing my immense gratitude to my family for always believing in me on and off the field. I would also like to thank Ron Benjamin and the rest of the Placer United coaches and players for being an instrumental piece in my development, for inspiring me, and for pushing me to be the greatest version of myself I could possibly be. I cannot wait to experience the next four years as a member of a tremendous soccer program.

I honestly don’t think anybody knows the actual amount of time and effort she puts into our club while also holding down an outside job.

I would also like to thank my coaches along this journey who have helped me grow in the game of soccer; Coach Jeff Landers and Coach Eric Ramirez from my Texas days, and Coach Ron Benjamin, and Coach Todd DeCarlo have been great to me since moving back to California. I appreciate your investment in my life and I look forward to this final year under your leadership. I am so grateful to all my teammates through the years who have pushed me athletically. The friendships that I have acquired mean more to me than words can say. You have become like family and mean a lot to me personally. Finally, I want to thank my family for their support, especially all the sacrifices you have made for me over the years. Especially my dad for yelling at the refs! I know I can always count on you to be there.\n\nI thank God for all His blessings in my life and am excited for the future He has for me! Go Wolfpack!” —Kathryn Yarbrough\n\n“I am very proud to announce that I have committed to play at William Jessup University. I’ve always dreamed of playing at the collegiate level, and because of the endless amount of support I have received from my family, coaches and teammates, I was able to achieve that goal. I would like to thank my family for their support and putting up with the dreadful car rides home after a loss. Without the support of my family, on and off the field, I wouldn’t be the person or the player that I am today and for that I am truly grateful. I would also like to thank all of the Placer United coaches I’ve had over the past four years: Chris Alcala, John Bustos, Todd De Carlo, and Katie Burton. To my teammates, thank you for being by my side since day one. I’ve realized that you guys are more than teammates, you are family to me, and I wouldn’t be where I am today without you guys. I would like to thank my high school coaches: Bill Fraser, Shonna Fraser, and my dad. Coach Bill and Coach Shonna have been nothing but supportive throughout my journey, and have always pushed me to be the best person and player I can be. I would like to thank my dad who has coached me in YMCA, recreation, competitive and now high school soccer. I thank him for always putting in so much of his time and effort to train me and always treating me as if I was just like any other player. Lastly, I would like to thank Coach Rachel and the William Jessup Warrior family for giving me this opportunity to play at the collegiate level. I am truly grateful for all of my teammates, family members, and coaches who have been able to take part in this wild adventure that has encouraged me to play at the collegiate level. I can’t wait to start this new chapter in my life, and be able to play at William Jessup University.

I am so thankful for everything that the Placer United organization has done for me over the years. Words cannot express how proud I feel to have been a member of this club, and I have a countless number of memories from my years at Placer. I want to thank my fellow teammates who have become like family members to me, and I feel so honored to have had the opportunity to play with such a talented group. I also want to thank the coaches that I have had during my Placer career, especially Matt McDougall, who has become one of the most influential figures in my life. I would not be where I am today, both as a soccer player and as a person, without his unwavering support. Thank you to everyone else in the organization who has helped me on my journey. Most importantly, I would like to thank my family, especially my mom, Maura, and my dad, John. I cannot possibly express how thankful I am for them and all they have done for me. There is no way that I would be where I am today without their constant and unconditional support. Over the past several years, my connection with Placer has become one of the most integral pieces of my character, and I cannot imagine where I would be without being a part of such a fantastic organization. Once again, thank you to everyone who has helped me on my journey. I am extremely excited to begin my next chapter.
