        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nVaasa was an important place of governance when Finland was part of Sweden. It started in the 14th century when Korsholm castle was built near the village of Korsholm (Finnish: Mustasaari). In 1606 the village was granted city status and five years later it was renamed Wasa in honor of the Swedish royal lineage. The old names live on in the municipality that surrounds Vaasa.\n\nThe old town of Vaasa burned to the ground in 1852, and when it was rebuilt it was relocated closer to the sea some six kilometers northwest from its original location. In the same process the town was renamed Nikolainkaupunki (Sw: Nikolaistad) in honor of Russian Czar Nikolai I, as Finland at that time was a Grand Duchy under Russian rule (1809–1917). In its new location the town became an important sea-faring city and a local businessman named Carl Gustaf Wolff (1800–1868) was at one point the biggest shipowner in the Nordic countries. When Finland proclaimed its independence in 1917 the name of the town was again reverted to Vaasa. The town was made capital of the white side (conservative, bourgeois) during the civil war (1918), when Helsinki was occupied by the red side (socialist, communist). It has since then been known as The White City; the support for the whites was very strong in the area.\n\nAround 25% of Vaasa's population is Swedish-speaking and even more are bilingual in Finnish and Swedish. In the area surrounding Vaasa the majority of people are Swedish-speaking; Korsholm has a 70% Swedish majority. The ties to Sweden are strong among the Swedish-speaking of the region, including those in Vaasa itself. The city is shielded from the open sea by the many islands in the archipelago. The nature of this area is nearly unique in the world as it continuously rises from the sea as the sea level due to post-glacial rebound. The Kvarken Archipelago, which is a UNESCO world nature heritage site, is lies off Vaasa.\n\nVaasa and Korsholm Municipal Government websites\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nHighway 3 (also E12) from Helsinki through Tampere to Vaasa (419 km). The coastal main road 8 (E8) goes from Turku through Rauma and Pori to Vaasa (332 km) and continues through Kokkola to Oulu (318 km).\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nAll trains from Helsinki to Oulu and Rovaniemi via Tampere stop at Seinäjoki. From there you can take connection trains, which head to Vaasa. There are also trains that go straight to Vaasa via Seinäjoki. Three of these trains also go from Vaasa to Jyväskylä via Seinäjoki. Check timetables at VR's web site.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are west coast bus connections from Oulu to Turku, which go through Vaasa. Buses connect Vaasa also to Helsinki, Tampere, Pori, Kokkola and Hämeenlinna. Coming via Tallinn, there may be coach connections with arranged transfer from the port, mostly via Kamppi. Coming via Stockholm, there may be direct coaches from Turku harbour. Check Matkahuolto and Onnibus for timetables and such.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nA ferry line called Wasaline crosses daily between Vaasa and Umeå, Sweden (with the port in Holmsund at the mouth of the river). One way tickets are 350–390/270–300/150 kr (children 6–17). Normal cars add an extra 550–570 kr to the price, a booked seat 70–120 kr, a cabin 330–480 kr. You can also do a day cruise (six days a week from Vaasa and once weekly from Umeå) which is 410–440 kr return. There are also campaign prices, at least off season. There is a transfer bus from Holmsund to Umeå (15 km; 70/30 kr, children 7–19). Vaasa also has its own transfer bus between the ferry terminal and the city centre.\n\nPeople arriving with their own motor- or sailboat can make use of Wasa Segelförening (one of Finland's oldest yacht clubs) on the island of Vaskiluoto (Swedish: Vasklot). They run the official guest harbour of Vaasa and offer good services for the occasional boat crew. There's a good view over town from the harbour and it's a two-kilometre walk into the centre.\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal bus lines 4, 10 and 40 operated by Vaasan paikallisliikenne go to the city centre; a one-way ticket on these buses costs €2.50. Local buses from the airport operate only during weekdays of the school-year, not on weekends or in the summer holidays.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is quite compact and most things to see are within walking distance. The commercial centre and nightlife are concentrated in the area around the market square. The distance to much of Korsholm, on the other hand, is some 12 km. Replot is 20 km away, Björköby 35 and Panike 45, the latter north and north-west of Replot.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nInformation about local buses can be found from Wasa Citybus[dead link] . You can use the Digitransit route planner to seek local bus routes between given locations and addresses. Waltti mobile app can be used for ticket purchase. You can also use NFC payment with Visa, Mastercard or Eurocard (Diners Club and American Express do not work) or a mobile device with Apple Pay, Pivo or Google Pay: the payment card or mobile device is displayed to the reader device, which then says \"Lähimaksu hyväksytty\" (\"Proximity payment accepted\").\n\nThe local bus traffic to other parts of the city and the surrounding municipalities leaves mainly from the southern end of the market square or from the western side of the Rewell Center shopping mall. Bus lines typically have intervals of one hour or half an hour per line. The office for the city buses, Vaasan Paikallisliikenne, is situated on the second floor of the Rewell Center.\n\nLocal transport to surrounding localities around Vaasa is provided by Wiik & Ström.\n\nBy electric kick scooter\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Finland#By motorised scooter\n\nGerman Tier rents electric kick scooters for use in the centre.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nSmartphone apps: Valopilkku, 02 Taksi\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the archipelago, you might want a boat cruise or a kayak. See Kvarken Archipelago for some options."
