        "text": "May 2, 2023\n\nGreat read! (almost threw up from crying so hard)\n\nI don’t care that this is a children’s book and only 34 pages. I read it and it’s going on my reading challenge.\n\nRead\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\nهذا الكتاب جعلني أبكي. لم أكن مستعدة أبدًا لمحتواه، فما كنت أتوقعه عن الكتاب لم يكن بالتأكيد طفل يحاول أن يفهم ويتقبل ويتعايش مع موت والدته. أسلوب نقي، بريء، صريح، ومباشر، ولذلك هو لاذع وموجع للغاية.\n\nSeptember 24, 2012\n\nThis is an excellent bibliotherapy book for young children who’ve lost a parent, I’d say ages 3-8.\n\nHopefully they’ll have as good adults as the child in this book, but even if they don’t this book might be helpful for dealing with the grief and confusion of losing a parent.\n\nI appreciate how this child feels, and expresses, anger, and a whole range of emotions. I appreciate all the thought processes the child goes through. Nothing feels inauthentic; it seems as though a child could react in just this way.\n\nI love the illustrations. They have a simplicity to them but they’re so expressive. I like the liberal use of red, with some yellow. My imagination would have included quite a bit of blue, but somehow the red & yellow work wonderfully.\n\nWhile this story shows this child and his father, and his grandmother too, coping with the loss of a mother, wife, daughter, it’s not a happily ever after type story. The loss of the young child’s mother remains a sad thing. And that’s good, and realistic.\n\nOne caveat is that this story and its pictures might actually set off some sad and angry feelings in children going through a grieving process. That’s not necessarily a bad thing at all, but it’s good to be prepared for that possibility.\n\n4 ½ stars\n\nMay 1, 2023\n\njust read this on tiktok, it’s 12 am and im bawling my eyes out. great read if you are in for a good cry\n\nMay 3, 2023\n\nsomeone posted it on tiktok and I CRIED it's so sad but beautiful\n\nDecember 16, 2011\n\nThis one came out of nowhere and hit hard.\n\nI grabbed this book off the 'New Picture Books' shelf at the local library looking only at the cover thinking it was a story of a boy who fell on the playground and hurt his leg. I was not prepared for the first page of the story.\n\n\"Mom died this morning.\n\nIt wasn't really this morning.\n\nDad said she died during the night,\n\nbut I was sleeping during the night.\n\nFor me, she died this morning.\"\n\nWhoa. I think there was an audible gasp as I sat unmoving for several seconds looking at the page and rereading the words.\n\nThis is a raw, powerful, moving, and honest story. A book with great potential for bibliotherapy, The Scar is not a picture book for very young children without parental or adult support.\n\nI would pair this picture book with the middle grade novel Milo: Sticky Notes and Brain Freeze by Alan Silberberg.\n\nJanuary 2, 2013\n\nI had a strong, tearful reaction to this book. Not typical for me, and certainly not for a children's book. I do work in a hospital, and work with children of gravely ill parents. Many books exist for children to help them face grief, but are often written with a \"helper\" voice. This book is not like that. The young boy narrates this story, and I was struck by the quality of tone and style. Thet includes the artwork. A great stand-alone book for children and adults, regardless if the reader is facing grief or not.\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\nPhenomenal bibliotherapy for children and adults alike. Need an argument that books are powerful? Use this one.\n\nOctober 3, 2023\n\nثمة كلمات يقولها الأطفال بشكلٍ عفوي يتناسب مع عقولهم البريئة تجعلني أُفكر كثيرًا غارقةٌ في المعنى، أُحاول استخلاص الحكمة من فم طفلٍ لم يتعد الثامنة بعد.\n\nدائمًا ما تلفت انتباهي «سجدة»، أُختي الصغيرة، حبّة الكرز في منزلنا، إلى صفاتٍ كان يجب أن أتحلى بها، تُعلمني الصبر، إظهار المشاعر والسعادة حتى وأن كُنت لا أقوى على رسم ابتسامةٍ باهتة لكيلا أزرع الشك في قلب أحدهم، أُظهر الفرحة والاستمتاع بما ترسم وتكتب وتُشاهد حتى لا أترك ندبةً بقلبها،\n\nالتسامح ونسيان المُشاحنات العابرة، وفي الوقت ذاته أُعرب عن قلقي بصراحةٍ من إيذاء شخصٍ ما.\n\nولعل أكثر درسٍ عاطفي تعلمته منها، أنها إن أرادت شيئًا أتت لتُعانقني وتضحك،\n\nحينها أدركت، أن العناق فعل إنساني مصبوغٌ بلونٍ سحري.\n\nلطالما سحرتني فكرة أن الألم ركن أساسي في تجربتنا الحياتية، ولكُلٍ حُزنه ورؤيته الخاصة، وهل يوجد أكثر إيلامًا من أن ترى الموت وفقدان الحبيب.. بعيون طفل؟\n\nتروي القصة المُصورة عن صبي لم يعد جسد والدته قادرًا على تحمل أعباء المرض، مما أجبرها بقسوة على الخُضوع له قبل أن تسمو بطفلها إلى مراحلٍ أعلى في الحياة،\n\nهكذا سار الأمر ببساطة تفطر القلب:\n\nاستيقظ في الصباح، لكنه لم يكن كأي صباح، حيث وجد والدته قد صعدت إلى السماء.\n\nلم يفجعه موتها -ربما لأنه كان مُستعدًا- قدر ما أفجعه تسرب والدته من مسام ذكرياته،\n\nفزعته فكرة أن يستيقظ ذات صباح، ليجد أن صوتها، كلماتها، رائحتها، إحساسه بحضنها على جسده الصغير قد دُفنوا في التراب مع جسدها، حينها لم يكن الأمر ليسير بنفس البساطة.\n\nولأجل ذاك الخاطر الذي آلمه، بذل أقصى جُهده للاحتفاظ بها في قلبه وأُذنه وجسده.\n\nأنهيت الكتاب بصعوبةٍ رغم قِصر صفحاته، لأني ما خشيت قدر الموت، أن أفقد أحد أفراد عائلتي فجأة، ولمس جرحي الغائر: أن أنسى أحبابي، ويسقطوا من ذاكرتي كما يسقط الورق من أشجار الخريف.\n\nيا إلهي!\n\nلقد علمني هذا الصبي أن الذكريات ليست مُجرد لمحاتٍ نتذكرها ونضحك، أو تُذكرنا بألمٍ ونبكي،\n\nإنها صورة حية تحفظ الحياة التى مضت في أذهاننا،\n\nمما جعلني أتحسر على الأيام التي قضيتها في الاكتئاب مُنعزلة عن أحبابي،\n\nوفي نهاية الكتاب، هطلت دموعي، وقلبي يأن آملًا أن لا أختبر الفقد، وأن أرسم الكثير والكثير من الذكريات.\n\nMarch 5, 2012\n\nThe Scar by Charlotte Moundlic tells the story of a young boy trying to grieve, adapt, and accept the death of his mother. Told with such straight forward, simple gestures and emotion from anger to tears, this book will make your heart ache.\n\n“I’m trying not to forget what Mom smells like, but it’s fading, so I close all the windows so that it won’t get out.”\n\nAn important, powerful, and emotional book for any family’s book collection to spur discussion and perhaps hope and healing.\n\n3/4/12\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\nمامان امروز صبح مُرد. بابا می‌گه نصف شب این اتفاق افتاده، اما من تمام شب رو خواب بودم. پس برای من مامان همین امروز صبح مُرده.\n\nغم و اندوه و خشم و ترس، پسرک کوچک داستان «جای زخم» را فرا می‌گیرد، وقتی یک صبح معمولی بیدار شده، بالای پله‌ها ایستاده و متوجه می‌شود، نه خبری از صدای رادیوست، نه عطر قهوه‌. پدر از آن پایین، با صدایی لرزان می‌پرسد: «تویی عزیزم؟» و او با لودگی جواب می‌دهد: «نه من نیستم!» و با خودش می‌گوید: «وقتی فقط یک خانواده سه‌نفره در این خانه‌ زندگی می‌کند و مامان هم مرده، پس کی‌ می‌تونه باشه؟»\n\nمادر دیروز در بستر بیماری با صدایی لرزان به پسر خردسالش گفته بود، در تمام زندگی عاشق پسرکش بوده اما دیگر خسته‌است و وقتش رسیده که برود. رفتار پسرک همزمان با درک این مصیبت سهمگین چه می‌تواند باشد؟ برآشفتن، برافروختن و اضطراب: «چرا وقتی هنوز پسر کوچیکت بزرگ نشده و قراره اینقدر زود بری، اصلا اونو به دنیا آوردی؟»\n\nصبح، پدر به او خبر می‌دهد: «مامان رفت.» و او جواب می‌دهد: «رفتنی در کار نیست. مامان مرده و قراره بگذارنش توی یک جعبه و بره زیر خاک. دیگه هم برنمی‌گرده.»\n\nاو خشمگین است: «چرا مامان به بابا یاد نداده، چطور روی نان برشته صبحانه‌ام عسل رو زیگزاگی بریزه؟ چرا حالا من باید پدر رو سروسامون بدم؟ چرا باید به تنهایی مراقب باشم که آثار مامان از خونه حذف نشه؟» پنجره‌ها را می‌بنند تا رایحه مادر را در خانه حبس کند، چشم‌ها و دهان و گوش‌هایش را با دست می‌گیرد تا هر چه خاطره، مزه، عطر یا یادی از مادر دارد در درونش باقی بماند. زخم زانو را خش می‌اندازد تا خون بیرون بزند و صدای مهربان مادر در گوشش بپیچد که می‌گوید: «چیزی نیست. زود خوب می‌شه.»\n\nمادربزرگ، مادر مادرش با چشم‌‌های غمگین، بزرگسال دیگری است که از راه می‌رسد و پسرک وظیفه خود می‌داند، مثل بابا، او را هم رتق و فتق کند. مادربزرگ پنجره‌ها را باز می‌کند و او اعتراض: «سعی می‌کنم فراموش نکنم مامان چه بویی داشته. اما بوش در حال محو شدنه.» اما مادربزرگ در آرامش و بدون هیچ وعده���ای، به او چیزی می‌گوید که زندگی کودکانه‌اش را تغییر می‌دهد. دست‌هایش را روی سینه کوچک پسرک می‌گذارد: «مامان درون توست. اینجا، توی قلبت. مامان اون بیرون نیست که بوش محو بشه. این تو ��میشه با توست.»\n\nو راه‌حل پسرک برای نگه‌داشتن مادر درون خود چه می‌تواند باشد؟ دویدن و دویدن تا قلبش آنقدر محکم به سینه بکوبد تا بتواند مادر را درونش حس کند، بدنش گرم شود و تمام وجودش از مادر لبریز. قلبش به شماره بیفتد و چشم‌هایش را ببندد و مادر را ببیند.\n\nیک نفر جایی زیر کتاب «زخم» نوشته بود، موقع خواندن آن تمام مدت اشک می‌ریخته: «من در بیمارستان کار می‌کنم. با کودکانی که والدین‌شان به شدت بیمارند. کتاب‌های زیادی برای کمک به کودکان برای مواجهه با غم و اندوه و سوگ وجود دارد، اما تقریبا تمام آنها یک‌جور پیام «ندای یاری و کمک‌کننده» دارند. اما راوی این کتاب، خردسالی است که با لحن شگفت‌انگیزی قصد دارد یاد مادر از دست‌رفته‌اش را زنده نگه‌دارد. به نظرم این کتاب یک اثر هنری است و مرهم بزرگی بر درد و رنج فراق هم برای بزرگسالان و هم کودکان.»\n\nکتاب «جای زخم»، نوشته «شارلوت موندلیک» و تصویرسازی «اولیویه تالک» (برای کودکان ۵ تا ۹ سال)، ممکن است برای همه کودکان مناسب نباشد، اما گفته شده اگر کودک اندوهگینی با مفهوم فقدان و مرگ یکی از والدین دست‌وپنجه نرم می‌کند، می‌تواند کمک خوبی برای او باشد.\n\nMay 3, 2023\n\n[IN UNISON] CHILDRENS MEDIA IS THE SADDEST MEDIA\n\nDecember 20, 2011\n\nThe first sentence of this book is \"Mom died this morning.\" This book is so warm, so touching, so real without giving dippy rationalizations like \"Mom's in heaven\" or things about life cycles. It has depth as it explores not only the boy's feelings, but his dad's and his grandmother's. It explores a range of emotions and acting out and irrational fears (don't open the windows--mom's gonna disappear for good). I think this is a great little book.\n\nThe only problem with it is the title and the cover. I thought this was going to be a story about a boy who cuts his knee. It was a startling shocker to read the first page. Pity the poor kid or parent who checks this out at the library and doesn't really look at it until they sit down to read it. They'll get a great book, but might have to deal with emotions and a story for which the timing isn't right.\n\nMay 1, 2023\n\nwhen a children’s book from a tiktok makes you want to bawl your eyes out\n\nOctober 27, 2015\n\nExtremely well written. Concepts are pretty advanced for picture-book aged kids but I think they would relate to the feelings. I think this is a good book for adults to understand how kids feel upon the death of a parent.\n\nJanuary 22, 2020\n\nA young boy grapples with the loss of his mother in this poignant picture-book exploration of the grieving process, originally published in France as La croûte. Reacting first with anger, when he learns that she has died in the night, and thereby abandoned him, and then with concern for his father, who has likewise been abandoned, the boy moves on to a desperate campaign to retain what he can of his mother. Closing all the windows, despite the stifling summer heat, in an effort to trap his mother's scent; picking a scab, in order to feel the pain, and recall his mother's comforting voice whenever he would hurt himself, the boy does everything he can to hold onto his memories. It takes a visit from his Grandma, and her wise words about where his mother is still alive - in his own heart - to begin the healing process.\n\nThis moving story about the loss of a mother reminded me of Roddy Doyle's recent picture-book exploration of the same theme, Her Mother's Face . Both books address a child's fear of forgetting a lost mother, although the Doyle story occurs some time after the death, while Charlotte Moundlic's story deals with the immediate aftermath. The text here is direct, sugar-coating nothing - I knew that she wasn't gone - she was dead and I would never see her again. They were going to put her in a box and then in the ground, where she would turn into dust - but it also contains quite a bit of sly humor, as when the boy wonders about taking care of sad grownups. The artwork, done by the talented Olivier Tallec, whose projects range from the minimalist cartoon-like illustrations in the Rita and Whatsit series, to the more lush and colorful (not to mention surreal) paintings in the Big Wolf & Little Wolf books, is simple and powerful. Using mostly black, white and red, he captures the stark reality of the boy's loss, and the pathos of his grief. Highly recommended, particularly to children who have recently lost a loved one, or two adults looking for children's stories with the theme of grief.\n\nMay 7, 2023\n\nSo beautiful and such a good depiction of experiencing grief as a child <3\n\nMay 12, 2023\n\nSobbed profusely (call me delulu for thinking this is a children’s book)\n\nMay 1, 2023\n\nhey somebody on tiktok posted this whole book and it made me so weepy. so beautiful i love it.\n\nMay 1, 2023\n\nI think picture books count — do they not\n\nMay 9, 2023\n\nmy friend and i found this children's book online. the book is an honest depiction of a young child grieving a parent. it is so realist and i saw a lot of these same things in my younger brother when our dad passed away three years ago. it is also very healing watching the young boy start to understand that he is going to be okay and he will keep his mother with him always.\n\nsobbing.. thank you.\n\nApril 23, 2012\n\nThis may be the best picture book I have ever seen that deals with the subject of death, as viewed through the eyes of a child. Usually when the topic is tackled in a picture book it's a grandparent or a pet that's died. Our young narrator has just lost his mother, and he knows death is permanent: I knew that she wasn't gone--she was dead and I would never see her again. They were going to put her in a box and then in the ground, where she would turn into dust. I know very well that dying means that you're never going to come back.\n\nHe also feels the burden of caring for his father: And I cried a little because I didn't really know how to take care of a dad who's been abandoned like this. I could tell that he'd been crying, too--he looked like a washcloth, all crumpled and wet.\n\nUpon learning she has died in the night, the boy yells out, Good riddance! because she promised she would always be with him and now she's left them. He tries desperately to not forget what his mother looks like, sounds like, smells like. He remembers his mother's comforting words whenever he would get hurt, so he scratches open a scab on his knee and imagines he can hear her soothing him again.\n\nThis is beautifully, heart-breakingly written, and anyone who has lost a parent--at any age--will identify with our little man. Elementary school counselors will absolutely want a copy of this on their office shelves.\n\nMay 1, 2023\n\nhow is this a book for children, i’m 19 and i’ve been sobbing for the past 15 minutes like I genuinely cannot stop crying\n\nJune 12, 2015\n\nOh, goodness...This is the sort of book one must read sparingly. The emotions are simply too volatile, too enormous, too crushing, too powerful. Read books like The Scar often, and you'll find yourself on the verge of tears all the time. Yet the story's message is profound, and needs to be relayed and received. We all need a book like this to act as our North Star and show us where in the world to go next when we suffer a loss as emotionally catastrophic as that of one's mother. What can we do without the most important person in our life, on those days we just aren't strong enough to face the remainder of our existence? The Scar offers no absolute answer, no well-defined set of steps to follow from grief's epicenter down a trail that never truly ends, continuing only slightly faded for the rest of one's life. The story does, however, relate the authentic experience of one boy whose mother's human frame could no longer withstand the devastating punishment of disease, cruelly forcing her to bow out on him before even guiding him into the transitive phases of adolescence. It's heartrending in the most intense of ways, an agony of uncontrollable colliding emotions that blow up in the face of the reader, but there is a reason for it. The boy's pain must feel completely real to us if we are to relate to it and understand through his story how we might one day escape on the other side of the tragedy that is losing a loved one.\n\nThe boy had to know it was coming. His mother no longer retained the strength even to get out of bed for him, weakened drastically by the sickness about to snuff out her life. She called him into her bedroom the previous night for a restrained yet tearful goodbye, letting him know there was nothing left she could do to prolong the inevitable. Her struggle was coming to an end, and that meant leaving her son behind to make his own way in the world, without his mother. The boy refused to acknowledge her goodbye, but he instinctively knew she was gone the next morning, even before his father uttered the words that could never be rescinded. Now father and son are trapped in individual coffins of grief, isolated even from one another by the pain tearing their hearts to pieces. There are so many reminders in each other of what has been taken away. But what if the boy starts to forget about his mother? The way her voice sounded, her distinctive scent, the feel of her hugs against his little body? No, he can't let himself forget any of that, or he truly will have lost her forever. When a loved one exists only in one's heart and mind, how much more important is it never to forget them?\n\nBut the boy's father, and his grandmother, are there to remind him that his mother may be physically missing, but she isn't gone in every way that matters. He won't forget her, really he won't, even if it feels like the sharpness of the memories he has of her are beginning to soften around the edges. Love doesn't die as readily as the frail human body. It exists on multiple planes and in various forms, visible and invisible. It seeps into the cracks and can't be gotten rid of so easily, no matter how we fear its dissipation. A bond like the one between mother and son is impossible to destroy, no matter what happens to it. A connection that powerful outlasts death and time and all else known to mankind, and will remain with us through our darkest days, when we feel that survival without the one we love is impossible. The tragedy will leave behind its scars; of that, there can be little doubt. But scars pale and and transform into smooth skin, and there are still days ahead to live even after our heart has seemingly been pulled from our chest. As the boy's grandmother tells him, \"She's there...In your heart, and she's not going anywhere.\" And someday, somehow, as absurd as it seems, as disloyal as it feels at first to think it could ever be the case, that will almost be enough.\n\nMy gosh, what does one do with a book like The Scar? Did it traumatize me? Yeah, it kind of did. Break my heart into a thousand pieces? Leave me sobbing uncontrollably? Open up emotional scars of my own, old and new? Yes, this book did all that. Yet I know that as hard an experience as reading it was, I needed to go through it. It's easy to become so afraid of feeling super-intense emotions that one backs away from it, preferring the shelter of comedy or warm sentiment to the agony of putting oneself through the pain of feeling a loss as profound as that suffered by the boy in this story. But while it wouldn't be healthy to only read books as emotionally taxing as The Scar, we miss out on a crucial part of the human experience if we don't let extreme emotions be part of our literature palette. We need to feel everything in its turn, if we're to make the most of what reading has to offer us. The Scar happens to be one of the more difficult parts of that experience, but I can say without reservation that it is not to be missed. I needed it, and I think you do, too, whoever you are, wherever you are in life. As you read Charlotte Moundlic's masterfully told story, you're sure to reflect on your own deepest scars and remember those individuals you have loved, both ones that are gone now and those who remain to be part of your life. May The Scar remind you to better appreciate both categories of loved ones. May it do the same for us all.\n\nMay 1, 2023\n\nIt broke my heart. To some, this may seem just like a sob and sad story, but to many others it is what they feel and have went through. I love reading about how people view and experience grief so I do not have to feel too alone. Although this is a children’s book, it truly describes everything to perfection. How it feels to lose someone you truly love, how whatever someone does it’s never as good as how your loved one used to do it, and how you begin to cherish their scent , voice , smile and everything about them and try to keep it in because you worry that’ll they’d have left for too long and you’d eventually forget. It’s beautifully written and made me sob. I love it.\n\nMay 1, 2023\n\nSlay. M’n eerste review op Goodreads en het is een kinderboek van 32 pagina’s, maar hij is wel fire. Wil je even goed janken? Lees dit. Dit korte leesboekje legt op een onwijs mooie manier uit hoe rouwen is voor een kind, maar eigenlijk is het ook herkenbaar als volwassene..10/10 would read & bawl my eyes out again"
