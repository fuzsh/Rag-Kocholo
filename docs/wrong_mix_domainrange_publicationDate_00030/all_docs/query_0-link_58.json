        "text": "From my list on books for designing alien worlds.\n\nBy C.S. Friedman Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nFor as far back as I can remember I’ve been creating fantastic stories. My high school notebooks were filled with maps of warring interstellar empires, and my graduate school notes were interspersed with short tales set in distant universes. My first science fiction novel, In Conquest Born, was published in 1985, and since then, I’ve written 14 novels for DAW Books, both in fantasy and science fiction. I love the challenge of creating alien worlds so real that my readers feel immersed in them and using them to explore the darkest recesses of the human psyche.\n\nC.S.'s book list on books for designing alien worlds\n\nWhy did C.S. love this book?\n\nNeed to design an alien species? If so, you won’t find a better resource than this one.\n\nKershenbaum does nothing less than attempt to identify universal principles governing all biological organisms and does a damned impressive job of it. Beginning with the question of whether the human concept of “evolution” would even exist on an alien world, he works his way up to detailed and insightful analyses of what types of life forms would likely evolve in different environments and how they might communicate and socialize.\n\nThis is pure brain food for any lover of science or science fiction, an intellectual exploration you won’t be able to put down. It’s in my top 10 list for books of any kind.\n\nBy Arik Kershenbaum,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Zoologist's Guide to the Galaxy as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n* Paperback edition is published on 1 July 2021 *\n\nA Times/Sunday Times Book of the Year\n\nDISCOVER HOW LIFE REALLY WORKS - ON EARTH AND IN SPACE\n\n'I love The Zoologist's Guide to the Galaxy. Although it sets out to be (and is) about alien life, what emerges is a wonderfully insightful sidelong look at Earthly biology' Richard Dawkins, via Twitter\n\n'Crawls with curious facts' The Sunday Times\n\nWe are unprepared for the greatest discovery of modern science. Scientists are confident that there is alien life across the universe yet we have not moved beyond our perception of 'aliens'…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on for fellow science dorks.\n\nBy Rebecca Hefner Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI volunteered at my local library in small-town North Carolina from a very young age. One day I picked up Carl Sagan’s Cosmos, cementing my love of science. Sagan’s explanation that we’re all just a speck on the pale blue dot called Earth spoke to me and made me curious to know more. I begged my parents to let me go to Space Camp in Alabama and I went to North Carolina Governor’s School for Physics. I didn’t pursue a scientific career but I always retained my love of science. When I finally became an author in my 40s, I knew I would someday write a sci-fi time travel romance—eventually, A Paradox of Fates was born.\n\nRebecca's book list on for fellow science dorks\n\nWhy did Rebecca love this book?\n\nTyson has done a wonderful job taking over as the layman’s communicator about science after his mentor, Carl Sagan, returned to the stars. This book in particular explains a plethora of scientific questions while showcasing Tyson’s humor and overall science acumen. I enjoy anything he writes and always find his books informative and witty.\n\nBy Neil Degrasse Tyson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Death by Black Hole as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nReaders of his essays in Natural History magazine recognise Neil deGrasse Tyson's talent for guiding them through the mysteries of the cosmos with clarity and enthusiasm. Here, Tyson compiles his favourite essays across a myriad of topics. The title essay introduces readers to the physics of black holes by explaining the gory details of what would happen to your body if you fell into one. \"Holy Wars\" examines the needless friction between science and religion in the context of historical conflicts. And \"Hollywood Nights\" assails the movie industry's feeble efforts to get its night skies right.\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on geology that tell great stories.\n\nBy Keith Heyer Meldahl Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhen I first crossed the American West nearly 4 decades ago in my ’67 Chevy, it changed my life. I had never imagined mountains built of contorted rock shoved miles into the sky, faults slashing like fresh scars across the landscape, and starkly beautiful deserts where people seemed an afterthought. After many happy years of researching and exploring the West with my geology students, I knew I wanted to tell the story to a larger audience. The result has been three books: Hard Road West, Rough-Hewn Land, and Surf, Sand, and Stone.\n\nKeith's book list on geology that tell great stories\n\nWhy did Keith love this book?\n\nWritten with the clarity and zest of Bryson and McPhee, but with the added benefit that Hazen is a professional geologist. I like this book because of how Hazen takes the reader into the process of how a geologist works and thinks. Hazen’s specialty is mineralogy, and his main thesis—that living organisms and minerals evolved together with each shaping the other’s future—makes for a unique and thought-provoking take on the history of our planet.\n\nBy Robert M. Hazen,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Story of Earth as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nHailed by The New York Times for writing \"with wonderful clarity about science . . . that effortlessly teaches as it zips along,\" nationally bestselling author Robert M. Hazen offers a radical new approach to Earth history in this intertwined tale of the planet's living and nonliving spheres. With an astrobiologist's imagination, a historian's perspective, and a naturalist's eye, Hazen calls upon twenty-first-century discoveries that have revolutionized geology and enabled scientists to envision Earth's many iterations in vivid detail-from the mile-high lava tides of its infancy to the early organisms responsible for more than two-thirds of the mineral varieties beneath…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on fantasy and science fiction for Pagans.\n\nBy Rebecca Buchanan Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI grew up with a serious passion for mythology and fairy tales. By the time I reached college, I knew that would be my path in life: honoring the Old Deities, honoring the earth, and writing new myths and fairy tales. To that end, I have published numerous short stories, novellas, and poems (the majority with a Pagan focus), serve on the board of directors of a Pagan publisher and a Pagan non-profit organization, and edit a Pagan literary ezine.\n\nRebecca's book list on fantasy and science fiction for Pagans\n\nWhy did Rebecca love this book?\n\nThis is hands down one of my favorite science fiction books ever, and it is very atypical for science fiction. No big space battles, no hungry aliens. Just three people trying to figure out their lives and how they work together, all while humanity prepares to launch our first expeditions beyond the solar system.Of Kindred and Stardust features a diverse cast (in terms of ethnicity and gender), a polyamorous romance, and a polytheistic protagonist who keeps an altar for the Goddess and ancestors in his room and who looks forward to attending his family’s solstice celebration. This is what the future might actually look like, with polytheism (and polyamory) fully accepted into society.\n\nBy Archer Kay Leah,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Of Kindred and Stardust as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAfter four years in the Alpha Centauri solar system, astrobiologist Dath Bellin is relieved to be back at ECHO-Crosspoint Space Station. His next mission: return to Earth and take a vacation. There's family to see, R&R to catch up on, and Imbolc to celebrate with his Druid grove—everything he could hope for from a Canadian winter. Unfortunately, everything goes wrong before he can even leave the station. There's also the matter of his exes, whom he can't have back no matter how much he wants them, not after his horrible mistake.\n\nFor the past four years, Mack Ainsley Tsallis and…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Brian love this book?\n\nKasting, a geoscientist, is one of the world’s leading theorists on planet habitability, who for many years has collaborated with NASA in the search for habitable extrasolar planets. He is more optimistic than Ward and Brownlee, arguing that we still don’t know enough about the exoplanet population to conclude that Earth is so very rare. How to Find a Habitable Planet begins by looking at why the Earth is habitable, then goes on to discuss limits to planetary habitability, the failed cases of Mars and Venus, habitable zones around stars, detection of extrasolar planets, and techniques that could be used to surmise the presence of life on those planets. What I love about this book is how it digs into the nitty-gritty details of the science, how it trusts the reader to be willing to think hard, and think deeper.\n\nBy James Kasting,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked How to Find a Habitable Planet as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nEver since Carl Sagan first predicted that extraterrestrial civilizations must number in the millions, the search for life on other planets has gripped our imagination. Is Earth so rare that advanced life forms like us--or even the simplest biological organisms--are unique to the universe? How to Find a Habitable Planet describes how scientists are testing Sagan's prediction, and demonstrates why Earth may not be so rare after all. James Kasting has worked closely with NASA in its mission to detect habitable worlds outside our solar system, and in this book he introduces readers to the advanced methodologies being used in…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Laura love this book?\n\nImagine for a moment that we found life on Mars.\n\nThat discovery would shake our world, change our outlook on the universe, and answer the question of whether we’re alone.\n\nSarah Stewart Johnson, a planetary scientist, has spent her life thinking about this possibility and delves into both her and our obsession with the Red Planet in this beautifully written book. Part memoir, part historical account, and part scientific exploration, this book made me want to ditch a career in journalism and take up astrobiology. You’ll never look at Mars the same way again.\n\nBy Sarah Stewart Johnson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked The Sirens of Mars as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAs a new wave of interplanetary exploration unfolds, a talented young planetary scientist charts our centuries-old obsession with Mars.\n\n'Beautifully written, emotive - a love letter to a planet' DERMOT O'LEARY, BBC Radio 2\n\nMars - bewilderingly empty, coated in red dust - is an unlikely place to pin our hopes of finding life elsewhere. And yet, right now multiple spacecraft are circling, sweeping over Terra Sabaea, Syrtis Major, the dunes of Elysium and Mare Sirenum - on the brink, perhaps, of a discovery that would inspire humankind as much as any in our history.\n\nWith poetic precision and grace,…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on the history of the universe and the life in it.\n\nBy Edward P.J. van den Heuvel Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI have loved astronomy since high school when I built my first telescope. I subsequently have been lucky enough to become a professional astronomer. I studied physics and astronomy at Utrecht University. After obtaining my PhD, I was postdoc at Lick Observatory in California, and after that became professor of astronomy, first in Brussels and later in Amsterdam. I have always loved teaching as well as my research on the physics and formation and evolution of neutron stars and black holes in binary systems, on which I, together with my Danish colleague Thomas Tauris, published the first textbook, which came out in 2023 in the USA.\n\nEdward's book list on the history of the universe and the life in it\n\nWhy did Edward love this book?\n\nWhile in the 1960s Carl Sagan and Frank Drake, based on a simple equation (“Drake’s equation”) concluded that intelligent life is abundant in the Galaxy, with as many as a million such civilizations with which we might be able to communicate, the thesis of this book is that intelligent life is exceedingly rare in the Universe.\n\nThe authors do not argue that life itself is rare. Their thesis is that simple life, such as single-celled organisms like bacteria, may have developed on billions of planets in the Galaxy. But that, on the other hand, animal life on land (multicellular creatures, able to move around) is exceedingly rare. And that these animals developing intelligence is still very much rarer.\n\nThe arguments which the authors put forward are based on what we know from the history of life on Earth in connection with the very special position of Earth in our planetary…\n\nBy Peter D. Ward, Donald Brownlee,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Rare Earth as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWhat determines whether complex life will arise on a planet, or even any life at all? Questions such as these are investigated in this groundbreaking book. In doing so, the authors synthesize information from astronomy, biology, and paleontology, and apply it to what we know about the rise of life on Earth and to what could possibly happen elsewhere in the universe. Everyone who has been thrilled by the recent discoveries of extrasolar planets and the indications of life on Mars and the Jovian moon Europa will be fascinated by Rare Earth, and its implications for those who look to…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on for people who can’t read five books on the same topic.\n\nBy Mike X Cohen Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am an associate professor of neuroscience at the Donders Institute in the Netherlands. My research lab focuses on discovering how the brain uses electrical signaling to compute information, and transfer information across different regions of the brain. I also have a few decades of experience teaching scientific coding, data analysis, statistics, and related topics, and have authored several online courses and textbooks. I have a suspiciously dry sense of humor and insufficient patience to read five books on the same topic.\n\nMike's book list on for people who can’t read five books on the same topic\n\nWhy did Mike love this book?\n\n“Are we alone?” An age-old question that we may never answer. Andrew May walks us through the scientific study of whether there might be life elsewhere in the universe, and how we might identify it. And by “scientific study,” I mean actual scientific investigations, not wishy-washy sci-fi fluff. The book is both inspiring and terrifying, because the immense distances in space and time make you realize that intelligent life is both incredibly insignificant and incredibly precious.\n\nBy Andrew May,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Astrobiology as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nExtraterrestrial life is a common theme in\n\nscience fiction, but is it a serious prospect in the real world? Astrobiology\n\nis the emerging field of science that seeks to answer this question.\n\nThe possibility of life elsewhere in the cosmos\n\nis one of the most profound subjects that human beings can ponder. Astrophysicist\n\nAndrew May gives an expert overview of our current state of knowledge, looking\n\nat how life started on Earth, the tell-tale 'signatures' it produces, and how\n\nsuch signatures might be detected elsewhere in the Solar System or on the many 'exoplanets'\n\nnow being discovered by the Kepler…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Bonnie love this book?\n\nThe search for life outside the Earth is NASA’s greatest quest, and this book will bring you up to speed on it. Just a few decades ago, scientists thought life arose on the Earth in shallow seas, warmed by the early sun and zapped by energy-producing lightning. The best place to look for alien life was on Mars, where bacterial life may have formed in the shallow pools that covered the young Mars, and then hunkered down in subsurface spots of Martian water and ice as these pools evaporated. Scientists now suspect life arose in warm vents deep in the Earth’s ocean. Subsurface oceans in the moons of the outer Solar System may contain similar vents that serve as breeding grounds for primitive life. Kevin Hand describes NASA’s current missions and instruments to find this life in alien oceans.\n\nBy Kevin Hand,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Alien Oceans as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nInside the epic quest to find life on the water-rich moons at the outer reaches of the solar system\n\nWhere is the best place to find life beyond Earth? We often look to Mars as the most promising site in our solar system, but recent scientific missions have revealed that some of the most habitable real estate may actually lie farther away. Beneath the frozen crusts of several of the small, ice-covered moons of Jupiter and Saturn lurk vast oceans that may have existed for as long as Earth, and together may contain more than fifty times its total volume…\n\nPreview"
