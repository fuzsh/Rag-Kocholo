        "text": "Carl Sagan, the cosmic sage, was a man of many talents — an astrophysicist, an astronomer, and an unparalleled science communicator. But above all, he was a storyteller who invited us all to become part of the grand cosmic narrative. His books, teeming with wonder and wisdom, continue to inspire new generations to look up at the sky and question. Here are three of Sagan’s most seminal works that every terrestrial being should read.\n\n“Cosmos”\n\nThe first in our celestial trifecta is “Cosmos.” Part science book, part philosophical treatise, and entirely enchanting, “Cosmos” is a grand tour of the universe. With Sagan as your guide, you traverse galaxies, dive into black holes, and journey back to the birth of the cosmos — the Big Bang."
