        "text": "Charles Hoy Fort (1874-1932) was as fascinating a man as one could hope to find. Author of The Book of the Damned, New Lands, Lo!, and Wild Talents, Fort was a master cataloguer of the weird, the unexplained and the bizarre which the scientific establishment of his day chose to ignore and ridicule. The Fortean Research Center was founded in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1982 to honor and continue Fort’s work. During the two decades of it’s existence, this volunteer group of researchers and investigators delved deep in the waters of the ignored, the ridiculed, and the unexplained. Exploring events in Nebraska, and far beyond that included ghosts, UFOs, Bigfoot encounters, animal mutilations, government cover-ups, alleged alien abductions, psychic phenomena, cult activity, and even a sighting of a blob-like mystery creature (although somewhat less intimidating than the one depicted on the cover of this book) the Fortean Research Center became recognized among members of the Fortean, paranormal, and UFO research community around the world, as a reliable and trusted source of information. This volume contains the entire collection of the Journal of the Fortean Research Center. 23 issues in all. They have been reproduced as a facsimile edition, meaning spelling errors, pre-computer production and typographic problems, and primitive printing methods are all evident. Hopefully, this will prove more nostalgic than off-putting. These publications are a reflection of their time, and demonstrate in many cases the beginning steps into subjects familiar to the public today: alleged UFO crashes and landings at government installations, alien abductions, cryptozoology and more. The world seems to grow stranger by the day, so take a look back and see just how strange it was a generation ago. Enjoy, and stay curious!\n\nI wrote this paper for a class in anthropological methods in 2004. It was more of a learning experiment in writing and research than a serious look at the phenomenon of UFO culture, which had a temporary bloom around that time on the Internet. In reading it today, I'm sure it would be a very much different paper today had I been assigned the topic (I chose the topic in 2004). Still, I remember the process of writing and researching it and I had fun. This, I think, is key to doing academic work: enjoy the process. This paper was never published, but did get some use by students who were subjected to it by a professor I never met when I had it hosted on an old Earthlink account. I only hope they weren't completely bored by it all!\n\nThis dissertation explores the formation, interaction, and identity of paranormal research teams in Western society. Also known as ghost hunting groups, these teams use both scientific and metaphysical tools to investigate various types of reportedly haunted locations. Paranormal investigators represent a widespread shift in Western religious and scientific ideologies as they explore questions of spirituality, debate theories of the afterlife, and attempt to document the existence of supernatural phenomena. At haunted sites, paranormal investigators seek extraordinary experiences that shape their worldviews and their relationships with others. This ethnographic research examines these groups’ simultaneous success and subversion in a larger social context through methods of cultural anthropology including participant observation, surveys, and interviews with ghost hunting groups in Florida. It assesses the cultural domain of the paranormal, the epistemological struggles of defining belief and defending sanity, and the ways in which paranormal teams negotiate their place in society. To conclude, this study demonstrates that the underlying relation between the paranormal groups’ motivations and practices is the pursuit of self and social validation. By validating their beliefs, experiences, and social significance, paranormal research teams deflect social rejection and reach a sense of belonging in both the spiritual realm and modern society."
