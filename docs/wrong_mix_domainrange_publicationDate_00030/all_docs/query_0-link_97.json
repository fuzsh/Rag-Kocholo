        "text": "If you’ve been with me for awhile–or at least long enough to know me for book reviews–you may have noticed that I rarely cover new or very recent books. There’s a good reason for that: I rarely read new or very recent books. It’s not that I have anything against them; it’s just that I’m so far behind on great books of the past that I’ll never catch up!\n\nBut I’m not alone in this, nor in my love for–especially–classic science fiction. To that end, I recently discovered the existence of the Cordwainer Smith Rediscovery Award. This award, founded in 2001, exists to recognize and promote some of the great science-fiction authors of the past, who may have fallen out of print and out of common knowledge. Unlike most literary awards, it’s not an award for a particular book; it’s for the author, and so various works by each author may fall under this umbrella. Naturally, I was hooked at once! And so, I assembled a list of authors and books, using the article I linked above, and set out to dip my toes in this particular forgotten pool of science-fiction.\n\nI will say up front that I’m not planning to make a series of posts about this. I already have The Great Reddit Reading List to work through; and frankly, it’s going to take me a very long time to do that. I don’t need another series (especially considering that I have multiple Doctor Who review series running over at the Time Lord Archives as well). However, I do like to cover interesting things as I cover them; and so occasionally entries from the list of award winners may show up here. No pressure!\n\nThere’s nothing like starting at the top; and so I started with the first name listed in the article, Olaf Stapledon (05/10/1886-09/06/1950). The book I picked up was his Star Maker (link is to Amazon; you can get the Kindle edition for $0.99–note he’s listed as “William Olaf Stapledon”). The book was published in 1937 in the UK.\n\nStar Maker (link to Wikipedia this time) is the story of an unnamed protagonist who, unexpectedly, finds his consciousness adrift in the universe. He quickly learns he is drifting through both time and space; and soon he learns to control his course. He discovers a species of beings similar to humans, with similar lives and problems, and is able to attach himself to one of them. Soon both of them learn to leave their bodies and travel together, eventually meeting up with a large group of like-minded individuals, who travel together backward and forward in time, seeking more like themselves. They eventually begin to trace the course of civilization, in anticipation of a great unity of minds that will reveal the being–the Star Maker, as he calls it–that created the universe. (He’s very careful to draw a distinction between the Star Maker and God as commonly depicted, because he makes the point that all of the cultures they meet have various gods, all of whom in some way reflect the Star Maker, but incompletely so.) In the end, he does so, and is both dismayed and wonderstruck by what he finds.\n\nThe book is a bit didactic, reading more like a series of lectures, or perhaps a travelogue–but that’s not unusual, given its era. It certainly doesn’t cover the usual conventions of a modern novel, and that may put some people off. However, it will be attractive to anyone who’s ever been enchanted by, say, Gulliver’s Travels. On the other hand, if you’re looking for action and adventure, this is not the book for you. Nevertheless, it’s been praised in the past; notably, Arthur C. Clarke considered it “one of the finest works of science fiction ever written” (Wikipedia, again).\n\nThere are some ideas here which become much more common in later science fiction–especially, the idea that humanity (and other forms of life) is progressing toward a sort of group mind, a global (or even galactic or universal) consciousness that will represent a utopia of sorts. I haven’t had the time to properly research the idea yet; but I wonder if this book is the ur-text, the prototype for that idea in fiction. (Thanks to Ken Jennings and John Roderick of the Omnibus! podcast for that wonderful term, “ur-text”, which I will most definitely use as often as I can.) Certainly I don’t recall seeing it in any older texts. We’ll see it come up again and again, though; perhaps the most famous example I can give you is the planet Gaia (and possibly later Galaxia) in the latter novels of Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, which exists as a single united mind. The book also wrestles with the concepts of life and death, of individual worth and contribution to a whole, of the meaning of history, and of man’s relation to God (or, if you prefer, creation to creator). With regard to that last: Stapledon appears to be a proponent of theistic evolution, the idea that God started creation, but then allowed it to evolve on its own; but Stapledon seems to suggest that some form of guidance was involved, as similar patterns arise repeatedly on many worlds.\n\nOddly enough, in my opinion, Stapledon’s narrator doesn’t seem to be particularly affected in the end by what he experiences. Oh, he’s certainly wonderstruck; but there are no great life lessons, no great changes. He barely passes judgment on the things he’s seen. I think there’s a theme in that, although I don’t think it’s what Stapledon intended: I think it illustrates the idea that no matter what happens to us, we still have to keep going, keep living. We may be exalted by the events of our lives, but underneath it all, we’re still human, and that’s an essential part of us. The narrator returns to his own life, and carries on. (Must…resist…temptation to make a point about politicians…)\n\nAnyway. It’s an interesting read, but I found it a bit of a slog; I’m certainly familiar with this style of writing, but it’s not my preference. Still, I’m glad I read it. I was surprised to learn that the book’s influence has been quite extensive; in addition to influencing a number of famous authors, it is responsible to some degree for the sci-fi “Big Dumb Object” concept known as a Dyson Sphere (creator Freeman Dyson even suggested they would be better known as “Stapledon Spheres”). I love digging into obscure-but-influential material such as this, and learning the sources of things that I as a reader (or sometimes viewer) have taken for granted. It’s not the easiest read; but if this type of material is your cup of tea, you’ll find it enjoyable and fascinating.\n\nHappy reading!\n\nIt’s a new year, and a new reading challenge! What are you reading this year? Having unfortunately not met my goal last year, I’ve scaled back a bit, to thirty books in 2019; so far I’ve completed two. You can join me on Goodreads, and post your own challenge!\n\nBack in September, I posted a reading challenge, which you can find here. It gave categories of books, one for each week over a year, but it didn’t recommend specific titles; it leaves that up to the reader. Today, I want to look at the other side of the equation, and also launch a new occasional feature: The Great Reddit Reading List!\n\nA few years ago, shortly after I joined Reddit, I was browsing the /r/books community when I came upon a post that mentioned the “Reddit’s Favorite Books” top 200 list. A little research took me to the original list, posted in 2010. (See below for links!) This list was compiled from several poll posts, and constitutes a checklist of sorts of the most popular books in the /r/books community. I’ve since expanded it with input from a few more recent lists, bringing the total up to 265 entries. (I’ll add it to the end of this post, and also make it a page on the site with a link in the sidebar.)\n\nI had read about fifty of the original two hundred entries when I discovered the list. Since then, I’ve added approximately another forty. I say “entries” and not “books”, because some of the entries listed will be a series of books rather than an individual volume within the series. That’s an artifact of the standard the original compiler used to create the list; in some cases, both an individual book and the series in which it consists would get high numbers of votes, because there was not much regulation of the entries submitted. No one was trying to enforce any rule that it must be a single volume; therefore series often made the list. With that said, I’ve actually read well over a hundred, if we count all the volumes in a series; but I’m going to count each named series as only one entry.\n\nSo, what’s on the list? It’s a surprisingly eclectic mix. There are a number of classics, many of which originated in other languages. There are a large number of newer, popular books, as well, as one might expect given that Reddit’s population skews toward the young adult age group. Fiction is certainly the larger division of the list, but non-fiction is well represented, and even a few textbooks made the list. Science and philosophy are well represented. Books since 2010 are not as well represented, because that is the year in which the original list was compiled; however you will find some newer books in the list post-200, as those books were added to the list in 2016.\n\nCertain authors appear repeatedly (and that’s aside from cases where a series is present). Neil Gaiman is far and away the author with the most entries present; about half of his novels are represented, and at least one of his graphic novels. Stephen King has a number of entries, as do William Faulkner and Neal Stephenson. Ursula K. Le Guin appears a few times. Fyodor Dostoyevsky tops the classical authors, with three entries. Kurt Vonnegut is popular. Male authors far outnumber female, but I think that is less a reflection on the list and more on the state of reading and writing in the world in general—many people, most far more qualified than me, have discussed that at length in other sources, and continue to do so.\n\nSo, then: A new feature here! I’ve been slowly working my way through this list for a few years. I want to pick up my pace and my efforts, and in the process, post my thoughts about these books as I work through them. I confess that I haven’t been reading these in order; I made an attempt to do so, but it didn’t take long for my attention to wander. Therefore, the entries may not be in order, though we should be good for the first thirty or so. In cases where I’ve previously read the books, I’ll work from memory and research as much as possible; some cases may need a full re-read, though. I expect to get about one post per week from this feature. This post today is already going to be long enough, as the list will be attached; therefore we’ll begin with the next post. (I’ve also included links to the original Reddit posts: Here (original list), here (discussion post), and here (2016 additions)\n\nAnd so, without further ado, I present the Great Reddit Reading List! How many have you read? What are your favorites? Thanks again, and happy reading!\n\nTitle Author The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy Douglas Adams 1984 George Orwell Dune Frank Herbert Slaughterhouse 5 Kurt Vonnegut Ender’s Game Orson Scott Card Brave New World Aldous Huxley The Catcher in the Rye J.D.

That’s all?” Words I never want to hear myself say…but it happens.\n\nAfter seeing it recommended many, many times, I recently picked up Neal Stephenson’s cyberpunk novel, Snow Crash. Let me get the suspense out of the way right now and recommend the book; if you’re into that genre at all, it’s a classic. Despite being published in 1992, Mr. Stephenson foresaw some amazing things: the ubiquity of the internet (the “Metaverse”, in his terminology); the rise of smartphones; augmented reality; and even Google Earth, though of course by a different name. The book is also a scathing criticism of the ambition found in capitalism and the shortsightedness of government.\n\nThe story was fine by me. The thing that I found troublesome, though—the thing that broke the immersion for me—was the ending, or rather, the lack of one. Oh, don’t get me wrong; Mr. Stephenson finished all of his plot threads…but then he chopped them off as sharply as if he had borrowed the hero’s trademark katana. (Side note: “A katana in a cyberpunk story?” you may say. To which I say, when your hero’s name is Hiro Protagonist—no joke—you’re already well beyond the boundaries of convention, so do what you like!) There’s no wrapping up, no scene where the characters get together and hash out what’s taken place. There’s no denouement, no decline after the action is complete. The story simply cuts itself off. The final scene doesn’t even include the protagonist; it centers around the secondary protagonist, the female business partner of the protagonist. I liked her character, but I wasn’t expecting that ending.\n\nIt’s not the first time I’ve seen this happen in an otherwise good book. Dean Koontz’s The Door to December comes to mind, for one. Even classic literature is not immune; Voltaire’s most famous work, Candide, concludes with a sudden switch in the attitudes and circumstances of the main characters, and then simply stops. It’s as though the pilot of a plane reaches the destination, but can’t figure out how to land the bird.\n\nIt’s unfortunate when it happens, because it always seems to be a book that I’ve thoroughly enjoyed. The weak ending, though…it breaks the immersion, there at the end where I want it to be most satisfying. I realize this is my preference only, but I want the denouement, the falling action, the wrap-up. I don’t want it to last too long—I want to land the bird—but I do want it to be there. I want to know that my characters will live, if not happily ever after, at least their version of it.\n\nI followed that pattern in my novel, The Last Shot. I included a short epilogue, in which the protagonists awaken in the hospital after a very violent night. I won’t spoil the ending, but I can say that I wanted to make it clear that the right people survived, and the right people didn’t, and that there would be a future for these characters in whom I had just invested a hundred thousand words. When the story ended, it was well and truly ended. (And a five-year-old had pizza. Can’t forget the pizza!)\n\nSo, what do you think? Let’s hear your opinions. How do you like your endings? Short and to the point—maybe a little too much to the point—or explanatory and deliberate? And have you had any experiences with endings that let you down? Let me know what you think!\n\nHappy Reading! (And to Neal Stephenson, should you ever see this post: I have nothing but respect for you, and your book was a learning experience for me. Regardless of my comments about the ending, great book!)"
