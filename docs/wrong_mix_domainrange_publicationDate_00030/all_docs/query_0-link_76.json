        "text": "🥇🏆 MOVIE REVIEW: Chandu Champion and Maidaan 🥇🏆 Recently, I watched two riveting sports biopics: Chandu Champion and Maidaan. Both films, rooted in the realm of sports, echoed the themes of grit, courage, and an unwavering spirit, making them highly relatable to anyone who values determination and perseverance. 💪 Maidaan takes us back to the golden era of Indian football in the 1960s, spotlighting the legendary coach Syed Abdul Rahim. Ajay Devgan delivers a seasoned and mature performance as Rahim, capturing his relentless drive to uplift Indian football amid numerous challenges. ⚽ Ajay's portrayal is powerful, and the direction by Amit Sharma ensures that the film thrives on a compelling narrative and an outstanding overall execution. 🎬 On the other hand, Chandu Champion, directed by Kabir Khan, tells the lesser-known story of Murlikant Petkar, a war hero who overcomes incredible odds to become a Paralympic champion. Kartik Aaryan, stepping away from his typical 'chocolate boy' roles, delivers a power-packed performance, marking a significant leap in his career. 🥊🏊♂️ The film, while following the familiar tropes of an underdog sports narrative, is elevated by Aaryan’s dedication and Khan's sincere storytelling. 📽️ Both films effectively showcase the determination of their protagonists, who, despite the odds, achieve greatness. The emotional high points, especially the climactic victories, left me teary-eyed and deeply inspired. 😢✨ However, an interesting and poignant facet of both stories is the impact of the wars India was involved in during the 1960s. The conflicts significantly affected the sports budget, making it even tougher for athletes. 🕊️ This aspect of the films is a stark reminder of how external factors like politics and war can hinder the progress of sports and athletes. It’s a call to detach sports from such impacts to allow talent to flourish without unnecessary obstacles. 🌏⚖️ So, the stellar direction by Amit Sharma and Kabir Khan, combined with remarkable performances by Ajay Devgan and Kartik Aaryan, makes these films a must-watch. 🎥 They are not just inspiring stories but also highlight the broader socio-political challenges faced by athletes. These films reaffirm the belief that true champions are those who refuse to give up, regardless of the hurdles. 🥇🏆 #ChanduChampion #Maidaan #SportsBiopics #Inspiration #GritAndGlory #AjayDevgan #KartikAaryan #KabirKhan #IndianFootball #Paralympics #AgainstAllOdds #MustWatchMovies\n\nVARSHA Monsoon RUN -35 K My running friends have often heard me saying 'I do not do 'timepass' runs anymore - if it is not a significant event, I would not do it. This was especially true for many local events in Gurgaon, earlier and then in Coimbatore. But of course, every rule has an exception. And when I make an exception, then there is no reason that the decision to run has to be logical. I will find ways to justify it. The organisers of Varsha Monsoon Run ( I refuse to call it marathon as I did not run 42.2kms), publicise it as fun run in fog (or rain). When I was awakened by the cab at 2:20am, I realised I had overslept and had just 10 mins to get ready. More worry was the sound of heavy rain outside, I had my own doubts if the run would actually happen. But when calls to organisers went unanswered, I had no choice. Somehow, left at 2:45 and reached bang on time at 3:30 fot the start. It was not just raining it was raining cats and dogs. There was not an inch or space in the start area that was not flooded and there was no roof or cover. Started the run in rain, it was POURING all through with frequent phases of very strong head winds added to the drama. Ended in rain, medal, refreshments, post run dance, all happened in heavy rain. Zero respite! Non runners consider me crazy for the amount of run I do. But going for this run I CONSIDER I was crazy.🤣 🤣 🤣. But never did something being termed crazy, disallows the activity to be done anyways!!. It was total fun eventually, relegated to the fate, we chose to enjoy the breathtaking beauty of hills of Lonavala in the rain, waterfalls thundering water, streams created out of nowhere and overtaking roads, frogs providing music in otherwise pristine nature and finally commendable volunteers and support was available all through, despite the downpour. #monsoonrun #running #runners #lonavalainrains\n\nTriumph Against All Odds: A Review of \"Chandu Champion\" and \"Maidaan\" 🥇🏆 Recently, I watched two riveting sports biopics: Chandu Champion and Maidaan.

While there’s a lot to discuss about the series, one particular scene struck me deeply. In the second last episode, there is a funeral scene at the church. ⛪ During the service, family members are called upon to share their thoughts about the deceased. Instead of the usual somber eulogies, they shared funny anecdotes, making the audience laugh. 😂 The daughter of the bereaved was not amused and wondered, \"Why are people making fun of Dad?\" As an Indian, this was unusual for me. 🇮🇳 Funeral or prayer ceremonies in India are generally sad, somber, and quiet. Forget about laughter, people even speak in hushed voices, not wanting to draw attention. 🤫 This reminded me of a scene in the series \"Fauda,\" where colleagues of the deceased gather to reminisce their loss in a casual, light setting with alcohol. 🍻 It’s fascinating how the loss of someone dear can be 'celebrated' in different ways across cultures. When I lost my dad in 2020, the message that resonated with me the most was, \"Your father lived a great life; his death needs to be celebrated. 🎉 We do not have to necessarily just sit and grieve over the loss. He lived a good life and deserves a fond farewell.\" 👏 Death is a universal experience, yet our ways of dealing with it are so diverse. 🌏 Celebrating a life well-lived can be as meaningful as mourning a loss. ❤️ #CulturalDifferences #YoungSheldon #Fauda #LaughterAtAFuneral #LifeAndDeath #CelebrateLife #CulturalReflections #GriefAndCelebration #FondFarewell"
