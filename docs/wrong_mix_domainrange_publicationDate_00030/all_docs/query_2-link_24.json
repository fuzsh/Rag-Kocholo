        "text": "The author responsible for my descent into words blew my teenage mind. His book transformed my view of what non-fiction writing could be, exploded my horizons and suddenly made \"Bonnie Dundee\" seem very, very small. This is what Carl Sagan's Cosmos did to me.\n\nDespite being a life scientist, I'd always been fascinated by the depths of space, an almost petulantly silent domain – forbidding, mysterious and dark. The only other astronomy book I'd read was a dusty old book my father won at school. A pleasant reminder of his academic golden years, it was efficient at imparting \"facts\", but, like the void of space, it lacked warmth.\n\nIt is not from space that I must seek my dignity, but from the government of my thought. I shall have no more if I possess worlds. By space the universe encompasses and swallows me up like an atom; by thought I comprehend the world.\"\n\nBlaise Pascal, Pensées\n\nThe ambition of Cosmos makes its mark right from page one, with no fewer than four quotes ranging from philosophy to the Book of Job. It's as if Sagan were throwing down the gauntlet, making it clear that the journey you're about to take can't be confined by the rigours of science alone. The scale of the cosmos is such that you must allow your own thinking to expand accordingly to fully appreciate where we're about to go. I'd never read anything like it.\n\nEven the list of contents are evocative, making the book sound more like a series of epic poems than a journey through space: \"The Backbone of Night\", \"The Persistence of Memory\" … Not once does this poetic tone waver. Throughout the book, Sagan continues to describe our place in space and time using language heavy with affection; he loves what he is describing.\n\n\"There was a time before television, before motion pictures, before radio, before books. The greatest part of human existence was spent in such a time. Over the dying embers of the campfire, on a moonless night, we watched the stars.\"\n\nThere are also frequent personal touches, providing insights into Sagan's private life and mind. These recollections pull us back to Earth, providing a hero for this epic tale, enabling readers to share Sagan's limitless wonder and curiosity. There's a stark beauty to this style of writing; we're never just being told a series of facts, we feel like we're discovering them with the author as he reaches out to the planets, stars and beyond.\n\nEven with an early bedtime, in winter you could sometimes see the stars. I would look at them, twinkling and remote, and wonder what they were. I would ask older children and adults, who would only reply, 'They're lights in the sky, kid.' I could see they were lights in the sky. But what were they?\"\n\nAnd, amid the quotations and anecdotes is the most compelling story of how humanity managed to unravel the science of the universe. Sagan masterfully weaves in the \"hard science\" throughout, expertly managing the lure of knowledge with a faster-than-light touch.\n\nLearn from the best, be passionate about your subject, be personal, liberate your insights and feelings. In doing so, you might just change someone's life. At a time when I was just beginning to wonder what lay beyond the heather-carpeted hills in the distance, Sagan showed me the universe.\n\nBarry J. Gibb is a science multimedia producer at the Wellcome Trust. A pdf of Cosmos can be found here"
