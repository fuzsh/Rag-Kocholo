        "text": "Hi friends and readers,\n\nIt‚Äôs been a few years since I posted anything here, and this will be the last. At the recommendation of my agent, I‚Äôm starting a substack‚Äìhttps://jenjulian.substack.com/‚Äìas a way to publish updates on my upcoming novels and share other thoughts about the writing process, pedagogy, publishing, houseplants, my silly himbo ginger cat, and so on. I‚Äôll start out aiming to publish every other month and then see where things go from there.\n\nUPCOMING NOVELS!!\n\nYes! My most exciting news is that Orbit/Redhook, a division of Hachette, acquired my debut novel, Red Rabbit Ghost. Its planned release is Summer 2025! I‚Äôve been working on this project since about 2017, and I am so excited and lucky and overwhelmed with gratitude to have found an agent and editor who both see something special in it.\n\nThe second novel (unrelated to Red Rabbit Ghost) is still in progress. But‚ÄìI almost have a complete draft already! Turns out getting a publishing deal is hugely affirmative and a major boost to your confidence. So working on this next project has been a much faster process. I‚Äôll reveal more at a later date‚Ä¶on Substack. üôÇ\n\nThat‚Äôs all for now! Many thanks to all of you!\n\nJ\n\nHi friends and readers,\n\nLike pretty much everyone on this earth right now, I have been processing these recent events of great upheaval and trauma: the global pandemic and the recent BLM protests following the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. I am not qualified to speak thoughtfully about the pandemic as it‚Äôs happening, nor about the specific anguish felt by Black communities. Instead, here is a list of Black writers I‚Äôve enjoyed reading in the past few years, with the intent to amplify their talent and voices. I wish this list were longer and welcome recommendations.\n\nLauren Alleyne ‚Äì Honeyfish (2018, poetry); Difficult Fruit (2014, poetry)\n\nChimamanda Adichie ‚Äì The Thing Around Your Neck (2010, short stories)\n\nSamuel Delany ‚Äì The Jewel Hinged Jaw: Notes on the Language of Science Fiction (2011 new edition, essays) (If you‚Äôre a fan of 60s SF New Wave, I also recommend Delany‚Äôs novels)\n\nPercival Everett ‚Äì I Am Not Sydney Poitier (2009, novel)\n\nYaa Gyasi ‚Äì Homegoing (2016, novel)\n\nMonica Hand ‚Äì Me and Nina (2012, poetry); DaVida (2018, poetry, LGBT lit)\n\nTerrence Hayes ‚Äì American Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin (2018, poetry); (Here are some excerpted poems.)\n\nNalo Hopkinson ‚Äì Midnight Robber (2000, novel, SF)\n\nMarlon James ‚Äì Black Leopard, Red Wolf (2019, novel, fantasy) (First of the Dark Star Trilogy)\n\nN. K. Jemisin ‚Äì The Fifth Season (2015, novel, fantasy) (First of the Broken Earth Trilogy)\n\nVictor LaValle ‚Äì The Ballad of Black Tom (2016, novella, horror) The Changeling (2018, novel, horror)\n\nKamilah Aisha Moon ‚Äì She Has a Name (2013, poetry) (This one is especially touching to me as it‚Äôs about Moon‚Äôs sister, who has autism.)\n\nNate Marshall ‚Äì The Wild Hundreds (2015, poetry)\n\nNnedi Okorafor ‚Äì Akata Witch (2011, fiction, fantasy, YA)\n\nChinelo Okparanta ‚Äì Under the Udala Trees (2017, novel, LGBT lit)\n\nZ. Z. Packer ‚Äì Drinking Coffee Elsewhere (2004, short stories)\n\nSuzan-Lori Parks ‚Äì Topdog/Underdog(2001, drama)\n\nAnand Prahlad ‚Äì The Secret Life of a Black Aspie (2017, nonfiction, memoir)\n\nJennifer Maritza McCauley ‚Äì Scar On / Scar Off (2017, poetry)\n\nShane McCrae ‚Äì The Animal Too Big to Kill (2015, poetry)\n\nZadie Smith ‚Äì Feel Free (2018, nonfiction, essays)\n\nSheree Renee Thomas ‚Äì Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction from the African Diaspora (2000, SF anthology), Shotgun Lullabies: Short Stories & Poems (2011)\n\nColson Whitehead ‚Äì Zone One (2012, fiction, SF), The Underground Railroad (2016, fiction)\n\nNote: there may be alternative purchasing venues for many of these if you have moral qualms about Amazon; it was just easier to link to the big A in most cases. Also, I have limited this list to work published in the 21st century (w/ the exception of Delany‚Äôs essay collection), but I also recommend anything by James Baldwin, Octavia Butler, Charles Johnson, Edward P. Jones, Adrienne Kennedy, Reginald McKnight, Toni Morrison, and Alice Walker. I have a blind spot when it comes to 20th century Black authors and only in the past couple years picked up Morrison. It was a joy to experience the beauty of her writing for the first time.\n\nHere, lastly, is a New York Magazine article with a list of links to donate to victims of police violence and to the efforts of BLM protesters, both locally and nationally.\n\nStay safe out there, friends.\n\nJ\n\nDear friends and readers,\n\nI didn‚Äôt realize how long I‚Äôd gone without updating this blog. Since April! When so much has happened!!\n\nThe biggest change is that I accepted a tenure track position teaching creative writing at Young Harris College in North Georgia. So I‚Äôm tenure-track faculty and I live in the mountains now, looking to invest in a wardrobe that is entirely plaid and tweed, plus some Twin Peaksian taxidermy for my new place. This also means I‚Äôve moved three times in the past three years. Same old. I drugged my poor sweet cat and ferried him and all my belongings four states south to a lake town in the Appalachians. My wonderful parents helped, of course. The following text from my dad sums it up pretty well:\n\n(**tears**) I love them so much.\n\nEven after the fall semester, I‚Äôm still adjusting. I miss my Allegheny folks (and the laxer schedule I had there), but I‚Äôve gotten to know some seriously earnest and talented students at Young Harris, as well as some fun, nerdy, open-hearted colleagues. I don‚Äôt know what the next few years will look like for me, but this is a beautiful place to be, and it‚Äôs filled with good people. I‚Äôm driving distance from family and I don‚Äôt have to worry about whether or not I‚Äôll lose my job year to year, and it frankly just FITS better, being back in the South.\n\nI mean, I‚Äôm a lot happier when I‚Äôm not digging my car out of a snow drift every other day. Big improvement in my mood.\n\nAlso! This past October, (thank you, Julie Wernersbach for bringing me aboard!) I was on a sci-fi panel at the Texas Book Festival in Austin this year with the incredible Nicky Drayden and Christopher Brown. Please check out their work; they are brilliant sf writers. And‚Äìfor being a panelist I got to see my humble short story collection sitting under the big tent among bestsellers. How cute it is there! That little stack! üòÄ\n\nI stayed with my dear poet friend and Austinian (Austinite?) Leanna Petronella, whose own gorgeous book debut came out this past year. Please buy it! Read it! She‚Äôs a searingly amazing poet and her cat is the best. Five stars for her book and her cat.\n\nALSO! This past November, I was able to make my triumphant return to the University of Missouri to read as a Visiting Writer! Returned to Ragtag, saw good friends and mentors, ate crab and drank craft beer and had the BEST EFFIN‚Äô time. Reminded me how far I‚Äôve come and how lucky I am, that I didn‚Äôt do all this on my own.\n\nWriting-wise this year, I fully dedicated myself to a novel I kept telling people I was doing ‚Äúfor fun,‚Äù alongside the Totally Serious Novel I felt I was supposed to be writing. My attentions are not longer split and I‚Äôm happier for it, and from the friends I dared to show drafts to (I was so scared to show this beast to anyone) I‚Äôve received the best feedback and encouragement. So this is my project. I‚Äôm sticking to it. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs fun. One time, I was in a class where a writing professor told us we were ‚Äúdoing it wrong‚Äù if we were enjoying ourselves while we were writing, and I think that really screwed me up. That‚Äôs actually terrible advice, kids. Don‚Äôt listen to that.\n\nIn between novel drafting, I‚Äôve been revising some old stories and experimenting with flash fiction. Struggling to submit finished work on anything other than a completely haphazard schedule. A few successes. üôÇ In case you missed it, this year I published pieces in Liminality Magazine, JuxtaProse, Jellyfish Review, and SmokeLongQuarterly. ‚ÄúFlyover,‚Äù the Smokelong piece, was just nominated for Best Small Fictions 2020. Keep your fingers crossed for me!\n\nThere‚Äôs probably more I could say, but I‚Äôll leave off here with the highlights. The spring semester has already started like a hurricane, and I‚Äôm looking forward to AWP 2020 in San Antonio this coming March. Not on a panel or anything. Will just be there to walk around and eat Tex-Mex and see friends and spend money at the book fair. Hope I come across some of your lovely faces!\n\nStay strange, my friends!\n\nJ\n\nHi friends and readers,\n\nLately, I‚Äôve been thinking about how to describe the books I love. Mostly because of a recent chat I had at AWP, but also because it seems like an important thing to be able to do. The kind of books I like to read are pretty broad in terms of style and genre (and their impact on what I write is very roundabout and wonky), so it‚Äôs taken me a while to figure this out. What NEEDS to be there in order for me to really enjoy a book?\n\nThere‚Äôs been a lot of talk on the twitter and such about what books people shouldn‚Äôt enjoy and what it says about them if they do enjoy them, or even if they enjoy decent books for the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù reasons (e.g., liking Lolita b/c Humbert Humbert is an ‚Äúantihero,‚Äù liking Holden Caulfield b/c he‚Äôs ‚Äúrelatable‚Äù). It‚Äôs starting to rub me the wrong way to talk about books like that, not because I‚Äôm concerned about the reputation of the guy for whom Chuck Palanhiuk is still super edgy (b/c really, f that guy), but because it develops a habit of defining the positive via the negative. This is a broader trend in the fiction workshop as well. My class typically spends more time talking about how a student‚Äôs story fails as opposed to how it succeeds ‚Äî which is legit, first drafts need work. But when students are talking about why they liked a story, they tend to fall back on personal taste: ‚ÄúI happen to like stories about [x]‚Äù; ‚ÄúI have occasionally thought what [x] character has thought‚Äù; ‚ÄúI like descriptive writing / fast-paced plots / female protagonists‚Äù; etc. In the end, everyone seems to develop an extensive objective vocabulary to talk about all the ways they don‚Äôt like a story and maintain a limited and subjective vocabulary to talk about what they do like.\n\nAnd maybe this is because what someone likes or enjoys reading is perceived as so subjective. I frequently assign students stories and novels I love and it takes them no time at all to come up with reasons why they didn‚Äôt like them / were bored by them, and how this or that literary giant failed to produce characters that they, personally, could connect or empathize with. I have been there. I have failed to connect with great writing, have pigeonholed what I love to read into superficial categories, have failed to realize that some of the stuff I thought I was indifferent to did in fact contain the essence of what I love to read, just in a form I didn‚Äôt expect and couldn‚Äôt see.\n\nFor me, what I look for is strangeness. That‚Äôs what I really want in what I read, the pleasure and tension in feeling like I‚Äôm on unsteady ground, that the world I‚Äôm seeing on the page is only a piece of it, that just off the page, hidden from view, is something frightening or sublime or uncanny or revolutionary. There are endless ways writers can do this. In my literature class, we‚Äôve been reading Ishiguro‚Äôs Never Let Me Go, which is about the interior lives of clones. Clones don‚Äôt die; they ‚Äúcomplete,‚Äù and the enjoyment there is in the chill of that word‚Ä¶a seemingly small but precise neologism that carries with it a massive psychological shift. I love that.\n\nThis might explain why I enjoy non-realist narratives so much, though it‚Äôs more than a genre thing. I see strangeness as any profound shift in perception, the gap between a character‚Äôs consciousness and their reality, the capability of language and the acknowledgement of its failures, the unsaid thing. It‚Äôs in the chilly prose of Alice Munro, the surreality of Toni Morrison, the unsettling, co-dependent character dynamics of Katherine Mansfield and Ford Maddox Ford, and all the other authors I enjoy reading, some of whom I learned to enjoy only once I identified the strangeness in their stories. I learned to enjoy poetry by identifying its strangeness, and it‚Äôs why poetry that makes any move at all toward platitudes (which are fundamentally un-strange things) loses my interest almost instantly.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs why I go looking for strangeness now. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm tempted to critique students stories by saying, ‚ÄúI wish you‚Äôd just go back in and make all of this weirder.‚Äù I‚Äôm at the point where I feel that a story doesn‚Äôt work unless it has this quality, or is working toward it in some way. I‚Äôm starting to think you can‚Äôt reach toward profundity without also reaching toward strangeness.\n\nI‚Äôll leave y‚Äôall with a list of some of my favorites. This doesn‚Äôt include books that I love for nostalgic reasons (the Harry Potter series, Madeleine L‚ÄôEngle‚Äôs A Wrinkle in Time, Pratchett and Gaiman‚Äôs Good Omens) because I think that‚Äôs a different category to be talked about at a later date. There‚Äôs also no poetry on here because I‚Äôm still looking to expand my poetry repertoire and develop my tastes there. Message me if you have suggestions.\n\nMargaret Atwood, Oryx and Crake | Ted Chiang, Stories of Your Life and Others | Lydia Davis, Varieties of Disturbance | Ford Maddox Ford, The Good Soldier | Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were Watching God | Kazuo Ishiguro, Remains of the Day, Pale View of Hills | Shirley Jackson, We Have Always Lived in the Castle |Franz Kafka, The Metamorphosis | Victor LaValle, The Ballad of Black Tom | Ursula Le Guin, The Lathe of Heaven, The Left Hand of Darkness | Kelly Link, Magic for Beginners | Katherine Mansfield, Stories | Lydia Millet, O Pure and Radiant Heart | David Mitchell, The Bone Clocks (currently reading Cloud Atlas, which I‚Äôm also loving) | Tony Morrison, Beloved | Alice Munro, Open Secrets, Runaway | Maggie Nelson, The Art of Cruelty, Jane: A Murder | Alissa Nutting, Unclean Jobs for Women and Girls | Flannery O‚ÄôConnor, The Complete Stories | Ruth Ozeki, A Tale for the Time Being | Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot, Contact | Colson Whitehead, Zone One | Virgina Woolf, Orlando\n\nStay weird, you weirdos,\n\nJ\n\nHi friends and readers,\n\nSo I‚Äôm two weeks in to the spring semester following a long and restful break in North Carolina. The weather on the NC coast was lovely. The weather here in Pennsylvania has been less so, with a snow dump on the first weekend of the semester and a freakish 40 degree spike to follow. In between writing, lesson planning, and KonMari-ing all my dresser drawers, I‚Äôm learning to become less startled by the sudden roar of a large sheet of snow rolling off the roof. The first time I heard it, I thought the house was tearing apart.\n\nFortunately, the house has not torn apart. In fact, everything has gone smoothly this month, with classes off the ground and running. An open schedule in February will give me some time to plan for March, which will be hectic and wonderful and, let‚Äôs face it, exhausting. But this is where I‚Äôll be, if you‚Äôre curious:\n\nMarch 7: Charleston, South Carolina. Thrilled to take part in the Crazyhorse Reading Series at the College of Charleston. Thank you, Original Mentor Tony Varallo for helping set this up for me. I can‚Äôt wait return to my undergrad campus as an author, and to see all the students who were exactly where I was eleven years ago.\n\nMar 22-24: Winston Salem, North Carolina. I‚Äôll be teaching a seminar at Press 53‚Äôs High Road Festival of Poetry and Short Fiction. My seminar focuses on point of view, one of my all time favorite things to talk about, specifically how to write first-person narrators.\n\nMar 27-30: Portland, Oregon. The AWP Conference. I will be there this year, rooming with my genius-mentor Joanna Eleftheriou and taking needed breaks from the chaos in the Emily Dickinson Quiet Reading room (yes, they have that). I‚Äôm not a fan of these massive conferences ‚Äî but! Good things abound. Moderator Michael Pritchard brought me on last minute to participate in a panel on historical fiction (I‚Äôll be stepping in for Allison Amend, whose books look fascinating; check her out immediately). I‚Äôll also be selling books there, and plans for a couple other events are in the works, times and locations unconfirmed.\n\nIf you‚Äôre going to be around for any of these events, I‚Äôll be happy to see your face.\n\nIn the meantime, stay strange (and warm)!\n\nJJ\n\nDear friends and readers,\n\nAt Allegheny, we are fast approaching that post-semester crunch time, that point where you are tired, and your students are tired, and at the beginning of class you just kind of look around the room at each other with thousand-mile stares. Do we want to talk about point of view again? Anybody?\n\nFortunately, I‚Äôve got a lighter week coming up ‚Äî lighter compared to the underground grind it‚Äôs been over the past couple months with class prep, and the collection coming out, and rewriting materials for the job market, and screaming inwardly about the job market, and sorting out the details of a new novel project, and rebooting an old novel project, and tending to basic self care, like sleep and showers and socializing with other humans, etc.\n\n‚Ä¶Actual image of the infinite hellish yaw of work you will never get done‚Ä¶\n\nSo in this temporary space of calm, for those who might be approaching a similar period of stress, I want to share some ambient sounds. Ambient has become a weirdly significant part of my working and creative life, and which, in overwhelming moments, either helped me to be productive or chill the f out.\n\nNo, not kidding. According to Science‚Ñ¢, it can actually lower your blood pressure. And who am I to argue with Forbes?\n\nAnd I say ‚Äúambient sounds‚Äù because some would say it really isn‚Äôt music. It‚Äôs an ambient, and an ambient is not a song. I do like songs ‚Äî they‚Äôre great ‚Äî I just can‚Äôt really work to them because I want to sing to them, and I can‚Äôt write my own words while singing someone else‚Äôs. There is no urge to sing along to an ambient, as you will see:\n\nNautilus by Loscil\n\nAlbum: Submers (2002)\n\nThis one has a ‚Äúbeat.‚Äù That‚Äôs unusual for Loscil, whose tracks otherwise give the impression of swimming in a gray sea, which is also haunted. Seriously though, Loscil is some of the best writing ambient I‚Äôve ever come across. There‚Äôs just enough sound variation to keep the tracks interesting, and enough tension to keep the ambient from sounding cheesy, or, as one of my friends once put it, ‚Äútoo satisfied with itself.‚Äù\n\nMicroscopic by Gas\n\nAlbum: 0095 (1995)\n\nAlso a good writing ambient. I don‚Äôt know why, but I work very productively to anything that sounds like it was made for those science safety videos I watched back in the early aughts in high school. My favorite Gas track is actually ‚ÄúVapournaut,‚Äù which is featured on this album, and nowhere else in the world. It is not even on iTunes, so it may as well not exist.\n\nJupiter by The KLF\n\nAlbum: Space (1990)\n\nOk, another obscure thing from the 1990s. The KLF is probably best ‚Äúknown‚Äù(?) as a British hip hop/techno/trance duo. This whole album though, each track is a planet (Mercury, Venus, etc.) and it is utterly committed to its subject matter. I especially like the part at the end of this track, where you get a rendition of ‚ÄúTwinkle Twinkle Little Star‚Äù that sounds like it‚Äôs being sung by the inter-dimensional space mice from Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy.\n\nProcedural by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross\n\nAlbum: Gone Girl Soundtrack (2014)\n\nFun fact: Trent Reznor attended Allegheny College, which is where I currently teach. This was the only question I could answer at a trivia night consisting entirely of questions about Meadville, PA. (Our team still lost.) But yes, I get excited about a good ambient film soundtrack. Gone Girl and The Social Network are both in my library.\n\nShinsen by Susumu Yokota\n\nAlbum: Sakura (1999)\n\nA good chill ambient. I like this whole album, though it‚Äôs quite varied, and this is the only track that features that creeping, mesmerizing harp. Yokota is probably a better ‚Äúknown‚Äù (again ??) ambient artist. Of course, Brian Eno is the big daddy, the visionary who was manually stitching together the choral harmonies in Music for Airports back in the 70s, long before everybody with a Casio was able to call themselves an ambient artist.\n\nLast Place by Broken Social Scene\n\nAlbum: Feel Good Lost (2001)\n\nThis almost entirely instrumental album was the lesser-known debut of Canadian indie darling Broken Social Scene. It‚Äôs steady and hypnotic, like the pulsing underwater tones of Loscil, but there‚Äôs actually something warm about it. Makes me feel like I‚Äôm riding a train with a group of quirky friends. All of us riding far and away from the academic job market.\n\nRadhe Shyam by Alice Coletrane\n\nAlbum: Transcendence (1977)\n\nTechnically jazz, and not an ambient, but I had to plug Alice Coltrane, wife of John Coltrane, and a talented musician in her own right. Some of Alice Coltrane gets a little too high-octane to work or relax to ‚Äî there‚Äôs one track on Astral Meditations that sounds like a ritual exaltation to a fulminous Sun God. It gets pretty intense.\n\nI‚Äôm sure there are many for whom ambients are not helpful. Some writers I know prefer to work in silence, or with the conversations and noise around them in coffee shops. But I‚Äôve also heard some folks I know say they wish they had better music to work to. So this is what I work to, and which has genuinely helped me when I‚Äôm stressed. When it‚Äôs hard to untangle words from brain to page.\n\nWhich ‚Äî that‚Äôs the hard part of writing, isn‚Äôt it. The writing bit.\n\nI‚Äôll end this post by thanking everyone for their support in recent months in regard to the book release, to my editor, publisher, and amazing blurb writers (Emily Cataneo, Bryan Hurt, and Trudy Lewis). And thanks to everyone who bought a copy of Earthly Delights or voiced their enthusiasm ‚Äî it truly meant a lot. I hope you enjoy the stories. (And for anyone who still wants to buy it, you can do so here or here!)\n\nStay strange, my friends\n\nJ\n\nSo this. This has been quite a year. üôÇ\n\nI have a book contract with Press 53, a publisher in my home state, and a first collection of short stories that will be coming out this October. I have now taught two semesters of fiction at Allegheny, getting to know some of the most earnest, dedicated, and talented students I‚Äôve ever had the privilege of meeting. For the first time, I‚Äôll be attending a commencement ceremony as an educator in full regalia, fancy tam and everything. I‚Äôll get to see students, some of them my students, cross a stage and achieve a milestone, just as I did at my own graduation ten years ago.\n\nI‚Äôve also been doing some looping, some slipping-out-of-the-present, as I typically do when big things are happening. My graduation year was actually kind of rough. I had just had an exceptionally painful falling out with a high school friend, what had been the most intense relationship of my adolescence (not romantic, but still intense). A lot of old teenage comforts had become stifling, and though I‚Äôd done my part to discard them, in some cases even abuse them, it was still an experience that, at the time, felt like an exile. That fall, I entered my MFA at UNC Greensboro, anxious and adrift, not really knowing what kind of person I was and carrying around the nagging insecurity that I should‚Äôve figured that out already.\n\nThat hasn‚Äôt exactly changed. Not really. If you‚Äôre like me, you live, sometimes excruciatingly, with a need to make sense of things. It‚Äôs most definitely why I‚Äôm a writer. Everything in the world is loops and links and metaphors and symbols. Every small thing is connected precariously to every huge thing. This is useful when you‚Äôre an educator. But sometimes it‚Äôs exhausting.\n\nSo tomorrow at commencement, I want to try to turn that introverted energy outward. Out to the students and their families and their future lives. I want to wish them great things, that they should have all the love and support and lucky breaks that I‚Äôve had, that they should know themselves and make themselves while avoiding the paralysis of self-doubt. Cheers, students! Cheers, Allegheny seniors! I know it‚Äôs cliche, but this is just the beginning.\n\nHappy dreaming,\n\nJJ\n\nKindest friends and dear readers,\n\nMy first semester at Allegheny College has been an absolute blast so far. These students are so eager and talented, and in between teaching fiction workshops, I‚Äôve been able to work on a new project of my own, a dystopian novel that I feel pretty excited about. Meadville is a tiny town, filled with mossy old cemeteries and dusty antique shops ‚Äî the kind of place that really leans into the fall season. I am not, however, looking forward to the apocalyptic snow dump that we‚Äôre supposedly in for this year. For a Southerner like myself, the novelty of snow wears off pretty fast.\n\nMore news: for the upcoming holidays, I‚Äôm selling some witchy new art through my Etsy store, and have placed a new larger order for the Steam Tarot Cards, in case anyone is on the hunt for gifts. I‚Äôm also interested in commissions and art exchanges, so please feel free to DM me if you are too. Here is a link, and if that doesn‚Äôt work for whatever reason (interntetting is hard), my shop name is jenjiwarrior.\n\n(Deliver yourself some love! <3)\n\nLastly, in case you missed it, check out my newest published story, ‚ÄúOne for Sorrow, Two for Joy,‚Äù in Beecher‚Äôs Magazine Issue 7. It‚Äôs all about magic portals and magpies and such, and was selected by Carmen Machado as Beecher‚Äôs 2017 Fiction Prize WINNER! Since I have been embarking on the uncertain process of re-kindling and re-embracing my teenage love for the occult and the folkloric, this was some nice validation. Onward!!\n\nMore to come. Stay strange, my friends.\n\nJ"
