        "text": "Oh boy.\n\nWritten in 1985, this is famed astronomer Carl Sagan’s first fiction novel. He’s most known for the television show and book Cosmos and is one of America’s most well-known star-thinkers. (My term.)\n\nContact is an interesting read. The science is fascinating and I assume correct. (I can’t even begin to guess at that.) And he writes it in an understandable way.\n\nBut the book is more of a thought experiment on what contact with an alien species would mean to the human race.\n\nWhat would it mean for religions? For countries? For borders?\n\n“Anything you don’t understand, you attribute to God. God for you is where you sweep away all the mysteries of the world, all the challenges to our intelligence. You simply turn your mind off and say God did it.”\n\nThere is a story, full of characters, settings and a plot but it’s more of a backdrop to the discussions he wants to have about alien life.\n\nOur main character is a rather bland character whose interactions always turn into deep discussions and thoughts. There are multiple scenes where she ends up talking with someone random, like a priest, and it is more of a setup for Sagan to have a debate than an actual story point."
