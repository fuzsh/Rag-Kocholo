        "text": "Contact, science-fiction novel by Carl Sagan, published in 1985.\n\n(Read Carl Sagan’s Britannica entry on extraterrestrial life.)\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Novels, Last Lines Quiz\n\nSagan, an astronomer at Cornell University who was inextricably tied to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (the SETI program), was one of the most famous popular scientists of the last century, as respected by his fellow professionals as he was by the public. A major proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life, Sagan designed a special plaque for the exterior of NASA spacecraft. It bore a universal message for spacecraft bound outside the solar system, which could be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find it. He was also one of the first scientists, along with Frank Drake, to use a radio telescope to search for deliberate signals from nearby galaxies, estimating that our galaxy was home to more than a million civilizations.\n\nThe highly successful novel Contact, which was adapted for screen a year after Sagan died in 1996, was Sagan’s best-known foray into the world of fiction, bringing scientific principles to mainstream entertainment. Perhaps ironically, Sagan envisioned the novel as a film first, completing numerous drafts of a script treatment before turning to novel form. It proved a wise decision financially, for, before he began to work on the book, publisher Simon & Schuster offered him a $2 million advance (about $7.9 million in 2024 dollars). Simon & Schuster’s investment in turn proved to be well founded, for Contact sold 1.75 million copies in the first two years after its release as a hardcover in 1985."
