        "text": "I first opened the cover of Obama’s long awaited memoir many months ago. I put it down and picked it back up many times, never able to maintain the motivation to continue reading for more than a few weeks at a time. Thankfully, the last few months have provided ample time on my daily commute to return to reading regularly, and I was able to push through to the end. As may be gathered from my recounting of this process, the book doesn’t drive a narrative that is particularly engaging, but I still think it is a worthwhile read because it delivers a much needed grounding perspective for a man who’s legacy, in hindsight, seems more abstract and ethereal than ever.\n\nNothing makes a political text more tangible than living and working in Washington. I can read about a specific interaction, then be walking past that literary scene a few days later, giving the text a closeness that wasn’t appreciable while I was living in San Diego. I see the jaded staffers, the confused but excited tourists, the protestors, the agitators, and the people just trying to make a living by selling cheap merchandise across the street from the white house, featuring whatever slogan happens to be driving emotion in those who visit. It makes the whole dance of politics seem more like a one-dimensional production, but also makes the concept of political careers seem ever so slightly less egregious, if only due to the unbearable droll and repetition of deriving progress from the ever-swinging pendulum.\n\nPertaining to Obama’s purpose with this book and the impending second volume, It shines as a revealing retelling of the challenges and pivotal moments of a truly historical presidency, but sometimes loses itself as a means to have the last word in petty interactions that have long been forgotten by those not immediately involved. Barry is human after all, revealing the bruises and scars of two presidential terms reminds the reader that his decision making was not always perfect, though his ideals and motivations were respectable and more appreciated now than ever. Obama’s recounting informs our current understanding of those that are still carrying the fire in Washington, making Biden’s actions as president traceable to his work in the Obama administration an interesting derivative.\n\nOverall I would say that I personally enjoyed the book, although it wasn’t fascinating or particularly engaging, it provides some context into who Barack Obama is and was, as a person, rather than as an idealogue or abstract force of societal change that he is sometimes reduced to. I think that people who respect and appreciate Obama will enjoy the book in nostalgic terms, recounting a presidency that was well intended, purposeful, but perhaps not as effective as once hoped. People who dislike Obama may find some humanizing aspects in the text, but I fear that those people will never make it through the long read, which often requires some personal interest to carry the reader through drawn out anecdotes that are scattered throughout the book.\n\nI picked up Kiyosaki’s opus on the philosophy of personal finance at the suggestion of a friend who was getting into investing as a career. It seemed like my personal approach to financial management and investing was well aligned with Kiyosaki’s approach, so I was interested to see the details written out and formed into a cohesive program. I wanted to see the big picture of where the progressive, risk-tolerant, ever-optimistic investor paradigm was placed in the hierarchy of financial ideals. I expected the book to bring some meat to the table, backing up the aforementioned approach with some kind of statistical or analytical framework to justify the aversion to traditional investment strategies in favor of inventive dealing done outside the box. I did not find an analytical foundation, nor did I find anything meaningful outside of some common sense advice and a sales pitch for Kiyosaki’s line of financial education courses. I was conned, as is the goal with Kiyosaki and the type of investor he inspires and admires.\n\nIt took me a long time to make my way through this text. Each time I picked it up, fresh with promise, I ended up putting it down an hour later with a bad taste in my mouth and a sense of unconscious discomfort at knowing the point of view being pushed by Kiyosaki likely passes as wise, or at least not harmful, in many circles. The book is aimed at a specific selection of readers who are looking for something to validate their desire to gain wealth at all costs, often at the expense of others. Kiyosaki provides this validation by fulfilling every stereotype of a self-absorbed, morally-bankrupt, narrowly-focused ‘investor’. He takes a Trumpian view of wealth, something that could have been considered a positive approach previously, but is newly considered as the approach of a man that is all image and no substance. A con man who moves from one mark to the next, only a few steps ahead of the legal and moral backlash that typically follows this type of behavior, able to avoid repercussions due to a complete lack of self awareness or conscience keeping him moving forward.\n\nAmong the sage advice offered by Kiyosaki is the recommendation of joining a multi-level-marketing company, engaging in insider trading, taking advantage of anyone and everyone at every opportunity, underpaying your employees, setting up shell companies to avoid taxes, and every other kind of devious scheme that would be considered morally reprehensible if it is done by someone who isn’t seemingly wealthy and successful. Of course, there are a few good points as well. Investing in IPOs, defining assets as only the things that can generate income, teaching yourself about finance and the legal framework of taxation, having a diverse mix of investments, are all good points of advice and earn this text the single star it received. The balance of good to bad advice is almost comical however, Kiyosaki just throws out random thoughts, many of them self-contradicting (do it yourself, but hire only the best experts, don’t pay them, but pay them well). I think that ultimately the reader can pick and choose what advice they want to get out of the book. The focus on optimism and positivity is also a good thing, within reason.\n\nOverall I felt this book wasn’t worth the time it took to read it. If anything, it has shown me that Kiyosaki sees financial education as just another revenue stream. He constantly recommends his games, books, and courses. He gives just enough meaningful advice that the novice investor might be tempted to dig a bit deeper and buy the next book. Kiyosaki does a great job of being controversial enough to draw attention (your house is not an asset) then capitalizing on that attention by taking advantage of people who want to learn a meaningful financial strategy. He pulls the con off smoothly, without a hint of self awareness, like he has done this a million times before.\n\nFrank Herbert’s second entry in the Dune series takes a fundamentally different view of the central protagonist of the first book and provides much needed depth to the characters and world of the Dune universe. Herbert's talent for creating technical fiction are apparent in Dune Messiah, but in attempting to strike a different path with the overall tone of the narrative, Herbert does not produce the kind of intriguing character development that set his first Dune book apart from other contemporary science fiction. Where Dune is a flawed masterpiece, Dune Messiah is the necessary foundation for further extrapolation (or exploitation?) of the Dune narrative, and thus presents less intrinsic value when independently appraised.\n\nThat isn’t to say that the novel is devoid of intrigue or joy. There are many facets here to gaze into and get lost in Herbert’s expertly crafted world. The political overtones, dense character motivations, and less-vague-than-previous religious commentary provides a variety of full bodied routes through the narrative. Herbert does tend to get lost in his own story weaving, at times almost actively avoiding the action-adventure elements that so well suited the first entry in the series. He does seem to improve his empty gender roles from the last book, actually creating some agency in his female characters this time around.\n\nI was initially worried that pushing past the masterpiece that is Dune, into the belly of a series that has a reputation for being an entirely downhill endeavor, would only serve to spoil the collective ordeal. By probing the scenery surrounding the main stage of this production, I’ve found the illusion to be thin and now inescapably apparent. I would not recommend Dune Messiah for anyone who still has the intact illusion of Dune’s complex and massive universe. The sequel is decent, but the cost to something better left to stand alone is just too high.\n\nAfter finishing Our Revolution I was compelled to pick up Sanders most recent book, Where We Go from Here, to see what he had to say about the new administration and his desire to run for president again in 2020. As I was reading this book, Sander’s campaign was slowly conceding that the chances for his selection as the Democratic candidate were extremely slim. I wanted to hear Sander’s case for the presidency and give his campaign one last moment of attention before we inevitably move on. Overall, the book was interesting to read, but was more or less what I had expected in that it doesn’t necessarily cover any new philosophical ground and is essentially a collection of public addresses given from 2016 to his presidential campaign announcement in 2018.\n\nIt should be no surprise that not much has changed since the 2016 election, Sanders is nothing if not consistent in his message and motivations. I half-expected to read a furious rebuttal to the Trump administration, as the progressive narrative generally and vigorously opposes most recent conservative policies. Sanders avoids this pitfall and manages to abstain from overly focusing his most recent work on Trump and his policies, instead he reinforces his support for the various policy platforms that he described in 2016 and delivers a chronological review of his recent campaign efforts. The positive integration approach is refreshing, effective, and demonstrates Sanders central values of political civility.\n\nSanders latest book is not significantly different in tone or content than what he presented in Our Revolution. The book serves a different purpose, this time utilizing a recounting of campaign events to drive the central narrative rather than his personal history. I don't find the difference in narrative approach to be compelling for the average reader and I feel the book still suffers the same flaws as his previous text. Fans of Sanders will find the book engaging, but those who aren't motivated to investigate his recent activity will struggle to find motivation for pushing through the material. The book is capable, but the dry, methodical narrative approach does detract from the overall effectiveness of the literature as a tool for his campaign. I would recommend the book to anybody with political interests and progressive leanings. As the Democratic primary draws to a close, it helps to connect the dots of Sanders political trajectory and illustrates the tragedy of missed opportunity if Sanders is not ultimately chosen as the Democratic candidate.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg lays out his background and describes his journey through life as a student, soldier, son, husband, and public servant in his first text; Shortest Way Home. The personal stories are varied and integrated with small descriptions of his political philosophy, making that narrative flow naturally as he steps through each stage of his life and arrives at his present position as a candidate for the American presidency. The book was emotional, reasoned, and as down-to-earth as a candidate can be when setting their public record as they see fit. I’d recommend the book to anyone who is interested in Pete Buttigieg as a candidate and wants to know more about his background. His story is authentic and creates enough personal interest to stand on it’s own as an inspection of American culture from the prospective of a young politician at the launch of his national career.\n\nThe most refreshing characteristic to see in a modern presidential candidate is some kind of personal modesty regarding their arrival at such an illustrious position. The ability to admit that not all answers are immediately clear, but that the path to a solution is a rational result of transparent consideration of the challenges and options available is something that I appreciated at a time when political ideals are so emotionally charged. Mayor Pete describes his approach to solving problems more than he discusses specific policy solutions. This can perhaps be considered a weakness of his exposition, as a candidate is typically expected to bare his arms and armor regarding policy objectives in his candidate biography. Pete takes a different approach by establishing his identity as a primary objective, adding policy only as needed. I would agree that I was looking for clear policy actions and found myself wondering how valuable character development is to his candidacy, as there is so much of that material to be found. Much like other politicians in the past, Pete Buttigieg aims to set his history to public record with this text, rather than cement his positions on policy. I think the material is thin as it stands, but if he releases future material which is more precise in describing his plans, he could easily fill that void. As it stands, I think this text will be viewed as the character development for Pete and will serve as a part of a wider body of material meant to sway voters and establish his political aims.\n\nI felt the book was interesting but not enough of a declaration of principle to build confidence in Mayor Pete as a candidate. I finished the text with a deep emotional connection to Pete, but without the confidence I need as a voter to be sure that he will drive the change I believe we need to see in our government. I think his candidacy is a statement with respect to American political culture, but he needs more steel in his foundation before he can really build anything more significant. A good start, hopefully Mayor Pete follows this book up with more material that will demonstrate his intentions beyond a simple explanation of his personal character. Although that wouldn’t be bad, it isn’t what I feel we need in a post-Trump candidate.\n\nWhat can be said about Henry David Thoreau’s classic reflection about the nature of man that hasn’t already been said countless times before, by far more experienced readers than myself? Walden is a spark that ignites a sense of the ancient, independent spirit in every human being, or should be, if the reader is ready to embrace it.\n\nThoreau’s prose is so precise yet adorned with the most fantastic description of the natural world surrounding him. It makes reading the text both entertaining and acutely painful as a modern member of society who embraces many of the material things Thoreau disassembles. Thoreau has such a talent for distilling his argument for the simplicity of a good life and makes the pursuit of anything more derived seem absurd in comparison. He introduces supporting characters as needed to provide tangible examples to the reader and manages to cover a huge variety of humanity’s many excuses for self-inflected misery. Walden was a joy to read and has had a remarkable effect on my understanding of, and motivation for, a life well lived. The decadent bits of profound philosophical arguments are well anchored and softened by a glorious reflection on the beauty of the Northeastern landscape.\n\nI would recommend this book to any American, or human being, who feels that life is too complicated or feels overwhelmed with the race that we have made for ourselves. Take a few deep breaths and walk the line of a cynic, as it is well justified from Thoreau’s vantage point. You won’t be able to do anything but appreciate his wisdom and sympathize with his justifications while you wade through his gorgeous description of the nature surrounding him and the nature which lies within all of us.\n\nBen Franklin is perhaps one of the greatest American literary figures that has ever lived. His knack for conversational language combined with his keen intellect and vast base of knowledge means that his writings are both approachable and entertaining while also being ingenious in many ways. He strikes me as someone who would have been a great companion for an evening of contemplation. Accounts of his life demonstrate that his value as a clear-headed partner in conversation was recognized and sought after. By Mr. Franklin's account, he succeeded simply by striving for constant improvement throughout his life and having an interest in the world and people around him. This open-mindedness served him well in that he never stopped being curious and welcoming new and challenging ideas throughout his lengthy career as a businessman and a statesman.\n\nIn is autobiography, Mr. Franklin recounts a number of personal maxims that he resolved to guide his life. The value of these lessons is apparent in that they have a timeless quality and still apply to modern life; they apply to the human condition as well as to his specific human experience. His ideas regarding the proper way to go about getting the most out of life are inspiring and practical, if not downright profound. Ben Franklin is perhaps the only person who could write such an inspiring and entertaining account of a life so well lived, and his autobiography is one of the best books I've had the pleasure to read. I would recommend this text to any American who has even the slightest interest in Mr. Franklin or his strategies for living a good, rewarding, and meaningful life. An excellent book and an excellent account of a true hero of American history."
