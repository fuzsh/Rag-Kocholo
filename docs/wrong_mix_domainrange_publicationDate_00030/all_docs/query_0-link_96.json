        "text": "Earthlings can now see screened objects on the Martian surface. This essay develops a practice it calls extraordinary ordinary philosophy, emergent from latent thought lines in the writings of Thomas Kuhn and Stanley Cavell, to think the consequences of speaking about the Martian world viewed using everyday terrestrial words. Exposing how our planet haunts our ordinary language and entangles itself in the claims of what we normally call reason, it presents a fragment of a critique of planetary reason. It sounds out, via a focused encounter with alien objects, and against the background of the scientific exploration of the red planet and its history, how and in which contexts our terrestrial words can be confidently projected beyond the Earth with something resembling the confident universality of the language of natural science. But it also pushes for the acknowledgement of the planetary limits that inhere within our ordinary uses of many everyday words. In so doing, the essay illustrates that acknowledging what Cavell calls the truth of skepticism is critical for developing an awareness of the degree to which we, our words, and what we are inclined to call reason, are planetary: earthly. Attending to the proximity and distance of Mars viewed, extraordinary ordinary philosophy brings out the stakes of speaking in situations in which we acknowledge that we are not sure that we want to mean what we say, and so offers orientation in our planetary age.\n\nThe cosmic sublime, as the most spectacular manifestation of the natural sublime, offers rich stimuli for the literary imagination, as well as for various interactions between science, culture and art. In her book of poetry Life on Mars (2011), Tracy K. Smith uses tropes of cosmic perspective, scientific gaze and interplanetary travel to problematize the relationship between human finitude and the boundless unknown of the universe. Written after the death of her father, who was one of the engineers of the Hubble telescope, the volume links personal elegy and the work of mourning with philosophical questions about the relationship between the self and scientifically framed visions of the cosmos. The primary intention of my study is to examine the strategies and implications of the poetâ€™s revisionary engagement with the aesthetics, rhetoric, popular mythology and mysticism of the spatial infinite. Smith employs the cosmic sublime not only as a spatial mode of perception but also as a ..."
