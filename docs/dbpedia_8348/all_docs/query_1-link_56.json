        "text": "In Berthe Morisot’s painting, she uses colors ranging from blue to green to yellow to orange. She uses paint thinly but in big brush stroke but her color was dull. Her brush strokes are in a cross hatching manner. This method of cross hatching creates depth and shadows on the foreground. Intermixed, in her piece are signs of dry brush strokes. Morisot’s figure is enticing to the viewer by staring back at the onlooker. Morisot’s painting looks very freeing as that is what she longs for. She has a sketch like quality about her painting.\n\nIn this paper, I choose to discuss three pieces of art from the 19th century Impressionist period and three from the Post-Impressionist period and how these six pieces of art compare to each style. Then I will draft a memo to the CEO of my company to describe the appearance, so that they will have an idea of what the art looks like and where it should be placed throughout the corporate offices. Next, we are going to explain the historical significance for each piece of artwork that I choose. Finally, I will descried to the CEO of my company how each piece of art matches the company’s overall image.\n\nThe Paintings A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte and The scream have several similarities and difference between them, but one difference that can be easily seen is the painting techniques. A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte is made of oil paint on canvas and its dimensions are of 6’91/2’’ by 10’11/4’’. The artist of A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte uses the technique of “Divisionism” or “Pointillism”. The artist uses small multidirectional strokes of colors in his painting\n\nVisual opulence, creativity, inimitable vision, and a style that is highly influential are the many characteristics of an admired movement in art history, that being of the Post-Impressionism movement (1875-1892). This movement, which was a by-product of the Impressionism movement, is the bridging gap between the two movements known as Realism and Expressionism. Post-Impressionism takes on some of the stylistic characteristics of these movements; however, it does not contain the all too glossy visuals of Realism or the heavily fantastic visuals of Expressionism, rather it is the intermediary of these two poles. My paper will discuss why this link was absolutely essential to the history of art movements, and I will be specifically using the\n\nThe colors that are used in Falguiere’s oil painting help to create a mood using an intense earthy color palette with various analogous colors. The analogous colors that are used in the work of art vary between yellow and red, they are more natural to represent colors skin tone and dark clothing and a more idealistic space. The colors have a great intensity with the red being very deep and even the yellows and browns of the flesh are very bright. The bright colors bring focus to the foreground and the darker more muted colors are in the background. This is done by the artist to add focus to the composition. The pattern with color is that the foreground is lighter and brighter so lighter colors are used, with the audience they are more muted\n\nRembrandt used a triadic color scheme, meaning he used one color with two other colors that are on the opposite side of the color wheel. For example, a majority of the painting is blue while in some parts are yellow and orange/brown. This color scheme also goes into the majority and minority aspect of the painting. A majority of the painting is dark and blue, while the minority of the painting bright and yellow. The majority and minority helps make the painting more interesting and it creates strong contrast with the dark sky and sea.\n\nAs I walked through the museum examining the paintings and sculptures from one of the world’s most famous artists, This particular painting of a sleeping Gypsy caught my attention in the museum. This stunning piece of artwork is a fantastic and deeply mysterious work which gave me the feeling of love at first sight. It has a mixture of combined strange imagination with a way of seeing and it depicts as magical. According to the American Artist and Writer, Mordicai Gerstein, “This is an analytical art which is achieved by the artist through the structure color and nature of the painting.Henri Rousseau's painting \"The Sleeping Gypsy\" has a mysterious charm all its own”. It is a disciplined and also a complex art at the same time due to the multitude of textures and colors. The brushstroke creates a smooth and texture look as you zoom in to the top part where the moon is painted. The Gypsy’s brightly colored striped robe enhances the beauty of the scene due to the rich colors, rhyming shapes and forms. This art can be best\n\nVincent took the already brilliant colors known for this movement and intensified them. He used complementary colors to add contrast; you can see the blue of the street in the distance enhances this in the “sulphur yellow” of the terrace. Another aspect of the painting that was popular for the post-impressionist movement is the impasto or thickly applied paint on the canvas. An artist similar to Van Gogh was Paul Gauguin, one of Van Gogh’s many inspirations and dear\n\nThe well-known Impressionist painter Edward Hoppers is famous for the way he uses light in his paintings. Although, in order to understand Edward Hopper’s paintings we must first understand a little about him and his past. Edward Hopper was born to an art loving middle class family in New York in 1882. Edward’s family fostered his love of art and his desire to pur-sue it as a career. He came to love fine art, over the illustrations he had seen as a child, while he studied at the New York school of art, for six years. Upon completing his schooling, he made several trips to Europe. The majority of these trips found him in France, more specifically Paris, where he discovered and fell in love with Impressionism. Surprisingly, his career and sales were mostly un-effected, until the end, by the incoming style at the time being Cubism. He was in-spired by and greatly admired several Impressionists including Paul Cezanne, Claude Monet, and Edouard Manet. His wife greatly encouraged him in his work and exploring different styles of art in his works. No matter which style he explored in his art work at heart he would always\n\nWhite Light has numerous colors and one can estimate that there are seven colors seen with the naked eye red, yellow, blue, green, grey, white, and black, although tint and shade vary, some of the colors are darker or lighter in value due to the fact that they have been blended into one another. Determining the colors requires a person to look not only on the surface but analyze each layer to arrive at a conclusion of color usage. Pollock dripped paint onto the canvas straight from the tubes which the originated from. Those tubes were also used to create soft peaks and layers to make the artists’ work texturally as intriguing as the color choices. He also used a stick instead of a paintbrush to cast the mediums onto the canvas. Another interesting fact is that Pollock painted with his canvas on the floor to feel a direct connection with his art.\n\nIn this painting, Bierstadt often used greens, yellows, oranges, and blues to add a balance to the overall scene and to create a very well composed final product that is pleasing to the eye. For example, Bierstadt used cooler colors such as luscious, green vegetation, ice-blue water, and pale, atmospheric blue-green mountains to compliment the warmer colors such as the pale-yellow hues in the sky backdrop. Bierstadt also used the triadic color harmony to create depth within this painting by using cooler color such as dark forest green and blue-green to push elements farther into the background. And using warmer colors such as pale-yellow and red violet to bring highlighted elements forward into the foreground. Bierstadt also carefully used colors and shadows to create a sense of light and tranquility, for example the sun breaking through the clouds casting majestic rays upon the life and rocks below seems almost holy or other\n\nLooking at his work Madame Matisse, it feels as though he is painting her face with different colors for a reason. Even both sides of the background were different colors. It’s almost as if he split the painting in half to represent different sides of Madame Matisse. In Notes of a Painter, published in 1908 he described colors and shapes as the equivalents of feelings rather than the counterparts"
