        "text": "The Danish painter Anna Ancher applied unmixed color with loose brushstrokes in Sunlight in the Blue Room to depict sunshine streaming in a brilliantly hued parlor. Plants rest on the window sill, while their enlarged silhouettes, framed in the reflected light on the wall, connect the small room to the outdoors. The Danish avant-garde pulled not only from France, but also interacted with Scandinavian, Russian, German, Italian, and British sources. Centered in the Skagen art colony at the northern tip of the Jutland peninsula, Ancher’s network interwove ideas from a vital international web and, by 1890, directly chafed at imitation of French models. By 1890, reviewers employed gendered terminology to describe Ancher’s work, comparable to descriptions of paintings by Berthe Morisot, an internationally recognized French painter. Ancher surely understood certain goals of impressionism based on her contacts in Skagen and the contemporary press."
