        "meta_description": "Considered to be one of the greatest Danish artists, Anna Ancher was a figurative painter. Born in the village of Skagen in 1859, she grew up in a close-knit community and enjoyed painting people and interiors. Ancher worked in a soft, realist style which was influenced by Impressionism.\n\nShe studied in Copenhagen for three years. It was here that she developed her personal style and skills. She enjoyed painting from observation, carefully capturing the relationship between natural light and colour.\n\nIn 1880, she met fellow painter Michael Anker and the two married, settling in the Skagen artist colony. She continued to paint during motherhood and into her later years.",
