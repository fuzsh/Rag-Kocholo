She was the only one of the Skagen Painters who was actually born and grew up in Skagen where her father owned the Brøndums Hotel. The artistic talent of Anna Ancher became obvious at an early age and she grew acquainted with pictorial art via the many artists who settled to paint in Skagen, in north of Jutland.\n\n​Anna Ancher was married to the Skagen-painter Michael Ancher in 1880. They had a daughter Helga in 1883 and lived together in Skagen for the rest of their lives. In 1884 they resided in the house in Skagen which since 1967 is established as a museum \"Michael and Anna Anchers house\".\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nDanish 1000 Kroner note issued in 1998 featuring Anna & Michael Ancher​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMichael Peter Ancher (1849-1927): Pigen med solsikkerne, 1893\n\n​\n\nMichael Peter Ancher was a Danish impressionist artist. Born: June 9, 1849, Bornholm. Died: September 19, 1927, Skagen. He is most associated with his paintings of fishermen and other scenes from the Danish port of Skagen. His paintings are classics and he is probably one of Denmark’s most popular artists. Michael Peter Ancher was born on the island of Bornholm.
