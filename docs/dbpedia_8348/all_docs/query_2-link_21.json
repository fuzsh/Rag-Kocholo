        "text": "Sponsored by Chelsea Classical Studio\n\nAnna Brøndum Ancher (1859-1935) was a Danish painter who is considered one of Denmark’s most original and important painters, beloved for her tranquil depictions of daily life. She was involved with the Skagen painters, the group of artists who settled in the fishing village of Skagen in Northern Denmark in the late 1800s. She held the distinction of being the only artist in the group who was a native of Skagen, which perhaps is one reason that she focused on interior scenes rather than the outdoor light which preoccupied most of the painters who flocked to Skagen’s shores.She studied drawing for three years (1875-78) at Vilhelm Kyhn College of Painting in Copenhagen (women were not yet granted full access to the national drawing academy at that time). She married fellow Skagen artist Michael Ancher at the age of 21 and the two settled in Skagen to paint. In 1889, at the age of thirty, she went to study in Paris at the atelier of Puvis de Chavannes; there is a clear change in her style after this and one can see the influence of the French impressionistic sensibility in her work, although she retains her interest in the same subjects of quiet interior scenes and the activities of daily life in Skagen. Before her trip to Paris, her work, though thoughtfully observed, feels somewhat conventional, but after her return she quickly developed her distinctive style, which combines the vibrant colors and broken brushwork of impressionism with her unique palette and simplified but solidly present shapes.\n\nAnna Ancher, Sewing Fisherman’s Wife, 1890\n\nBoth Anna and her husband Michael focused their subjects on their local life and landscape, using family and neighbors as models. Anna painted her family home many times, and her mother Ana often posed for her; below are some wonderful examples of her mother in their home. Anna is noted for her use of figures that are either turned away from the viewer or avoiding eye contact, creating works that demand engagement at a remove and enforce a feeling of quiet on viewer. She is also distinctive for her palette of of blues, greens, and corals that create a feeling of vibrancy and motion even in a still interior. Though interior scenes predominate her work, she also handles landscapes – though always with figures – with confidence and the same masterful use of color. Today she is a deeply respected part of the Danish painting tradition, thanks to her modern style that remained rooted in a strong respect for her environment and personal influences.\n\nAnna Ancher, Michael Ancher on his way to his studio accompanied by the organist Helene Christiansen, oil on canvas, 1888\n\nAnna Ancher, Sunlight in the Blue Room, 1891\n\nAnna Ancher, A Funeral, 1891\n\nAnna Ancher, Grief, 1902\n\nAnna Ancher, Evening sun in the artist’s studio at Markvej, after 1913\n\nAnna Ancher, At Noon, 1914\n\nAnna Ancher, A woman from Skagen with a floral red scarf and a red dress, oil on panel\n\nAnna Ancher, The artist’s mother, Ane Brøndum, reading in the red room, oil on canvas, 1910\n\nAnna Ancher, Mrs Ane Brøndum in the blue room, 1913"
