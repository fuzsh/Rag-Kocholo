        "text": "Characterized by bright colors and thick brushstrokes, and using light, shadow, and color to depict fleeting moments in time, Impressionism is one of art history’s most groundbreaking art movements, precipitating modern art. The art world has been largely male-dominated throughout art history, and many women Impressionists were undervalued or not mentioned in the art historical canon. Below, we list 10 now-famous women Impressionists and some of their notable works.\n\nAn Introduction to the Female Impressionists\n\nFrench women were largely unable to receive formal art education during the 19th century. Women experienced a variety of social constraints. Their lives largely revolved around keeping a household and spending time in the company of other women, and they were not allowed to leave their homes unattended if they were not married, which hindered female artists from looking for scenes to paint outside.\n\nHowever, women Impressionists found a way to use these limitations, creating works that delved into their internal world and reflected their revolutionary feelings that men often were unfamiliar with.\n\nFamous Women Impressionists and Their Important Artworks\n\nBelow is a list of 10 influential female Impressionists and some of their works, capturing moments of color and light depicted in their individual styles that contributed to the Impressionist movement in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nMarie Bracquemond (1840 – 1916)\n\nArtistMarie BracquemondWhen the Artist Lived1840 – 1916Nationality of the ArtistFrenchWhere the Artist LivedFranceAssociated Art MovementsImpressionism\n\nMarie Bracquemond was a French painter who did not have the financial support for her creative aspirations and was thus mainly self-taught. The art education that she did receive was from the artist, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres.\n\nHowever, Bracquemond left his studio as he did not have a lot of faith in female painters, assigning them only painting projects of portraits, fruits, flowers, still lifes, and genre paintings.\n\nShe painted outdoors in Paris, a practice known as en plein air, and her works earned the attention of Impressionist painters who invited her to show with them. She exhibited three times, but her husband, the artist Félix Bracquemond, put pressure on her and she left her career as an artist.\n\nMarie Bracquemond, c. 1880; Unknown author Unknown author, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nOn the Terrace at Sèvres (Sur la terrasse à Sèvres) (1880) by Marie Bracquemond\n\nDate Completed1880Dimensions (cm)87.9 x 114.3MediumOil on canvasWhere It Is Currently HousedPetit Palais, Paris\n\nOn the Terrace at Sèvres (Sur la terrasse à Sèvres) is a fine example of the Impressionist style, depicting the shifting light using short, expressive brushstrokes, especially in the trees and buildings in the background. Three figures are shown sitting together outside on a beautiful sunny day, gazing in different directions. One of the women is looking directly at the viewer, while the other is turned to the side in contemplation.\n\nThe scene appears to be staged, as if the figures are sitting for the artist.\n\nSome of Bracquemond’s other famous works include:\n\nSelf-Portrait (1870)\n\nTrois femmes aux ombrelles (1880)\n\nThe Artist’s Son and Sister in the Garden at Sevres (1890)\n\nOn the Terrace at Sèvres (Sur la terrasse à Sèvres) (1880) by Marie Bracquemond; Marie Bracquemond, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nBerthe Morisot (1841 – 1895)\n\nArtistBerthe MorisotWhen the Artist Lived1841 – 1895Nationality of the ArtistFrenchWhere the Artist LivedFranceAssociated Art MovementsRealism, Modern Art\n\nBerthe Morisot was a French artist who was a member of the Impressionists, invited by her brother-in-law, Manet. She is known for her innovative depictions of intimate moments of modern Parisian women. Using light expressive brushstrokes, she portrayed them with much psychological depth. All her subjects have an ambiguity to them that leaves you wondering what they are thinking.\n\nMorisot exhibited regularly at the Salon in Paris and achieved great recognition as an Impressionist, but male critics referred to her work as “charming” and feminine rather than give her the same recognition as her male contemporaries.\n\nBerthe Morisot in 1875, photograph by Charles Reutlinger; Charles Reutlinger, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Cradle (1872) by Berthe Morisot\n\nDate Completed1872Dimensions (cm)56 x 46MediumOil on canvasWhere It Is Currently HousedMusée d’Orsay, Paris\n\nThe Cradle is one of Morisot’s most famous paintings, depicting her sister, Edma watching over her daughter as she sleeps in a cradle. Her left arm is bent, her face resting in her palm as she gazes contemplatively at her daughter whose arm is also bent in the same way.\n\nThere is a sense of intimacy portrayed in the painting, accentuated by the mother holding the net over the cradle, forming a translucent barrier between the viewer and the child.\n\nSome of Morisot’s other famous works include:\n\nSummer’s Day (1879)\n\nWoman at Her Toilette (1880)\n\nEugène Manet and His Daughter in the Garden (1883)\n\nThe Cradle (1872) by Berthe Morisot; Berthe Morisot, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nMary Cassatt (1844 – 1926)\n\nArtistMary CassattWhen the Artist Lived1844 – 1926Nationality of the ArtistAmericanWhere the Artist LivedAmerica, FranceAssociated Art MovementsModern art, American Impressionism\n\nMary Cassatt was an American artist who came from a wealthy family that supported her formal art education. She first studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and then traveled to Europe, where she learned under artists such as Édouard Frère and Jean-Léon Gérôme, eventually settling in France where she exhibited her portraits in the Salon. Degas invited her to show with the Impressionists in 1877 and took part in four exhibitions, becoming a successful portrait artist and printmaker.\n\nAlthough Cassatt declared herself unfit for marriage and motherhood, many of her paintings depict the relationship between women and their children.\n\nMary Cassatt in 1914; Unknown author Unknown author, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Boating Party (1893 – 1894) by Mary Cassatt\n\nDate Completed1893 – 1894Dimensions (cm)90 x 117.3MediumOil on canvasWhere It Is Currently HousedNational Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Boating Party by Mary Cassatt depicts two adult figures as well as a baby sitting in a sailboat on the water. The man’s face is partially hidden, placing emphasis on the woman and child. Most of our view is taken up by the boat and figures. The man’s dark back faces the viewer, flattening the picture, and the shoreline is placed at the top of the composition, squishing the horizon and sense of distance.\n\nThe style of the picture reflects a Japanese influence with its simple color palette and flat patterned surfaces.\n\nSome of Cassatt’s other famous works include:\n\nLittle Girl in a Blue Armchair (1878)\n\nFive o’Clock Tea (1880)\n\nWoman Sitting with a Child in Her Arms (1890)\n\nThe Boating Party (1893-1894) by Mary Cassatt; Mary Cassatt, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nLilla Cabot Perry (1848 – 1933)\n\nArtistLilla Cabot PerryWhen the Artist Lived1848 – 1933Nationality of the ArtistAmericanWhere the Artist LivedAmerica, France, JapanAssociated Art MovementsAmerican Impressionism\n\nLilla Cabot Perry was an American artist who learned to paint after the birth of her three daughters when she was 36 years old. Her affluent background afforded her the opportunity to study in Paris.\n\nThere, she was greatly influenced by the Impressionists, collecting works by Claude Monet and spreading news about the group when she returned home to America.\n\nSelf-portrait (c. 1889-1896) by Lilla Cabot Perry; Lilla Cabot Perry, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nLady With a Bowl of Violets (1910) by Lilla Cabot Perry\n\nDate Completed1910Dimensions (cm)102.23 x 76.2MediumOil on canvasWhere It Is Currently HousedNational Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C.\n\nLady with a Bowl of Violets demonstrates Perry’s love for light and bold brushwork. She painted it after her family’s return from Tokyo, and a Japanese woodblock print can be seen behind the subject’s head. Perry was also inspired by Japanese art and incorporated elements of the style in her later work.\n\nBy using broad brushstrokes of paint, Perry conveys the texture of the woman’s skin and white lace trim on her gown, which reflects warm orange light from the hearth on the left of the composition.\n\nSome of Perry’s other famous works include:\n\nOpen Air Concert (1890)\n\nLittle Girl on a Lane, Giverny (1907)\n\nA Peach Tree (1925)\n\nLady With a Bowl of Violets (1910) by Lilla Cabot Perry; Lilla Cabot Perry, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nEva Gonzalès (1849 – 1883)\n\nArtistEva GonzalèsWhen the Artist Lived1849 – 1883Nationality of the ArtistFrenchWhere the Artist LivedFranceAssociated Art MovementsImpressionism\n\nEva Gonzalès was a French artist who painted in the Impressionist style but never exhibited with the group. Like many French women, Gonzalès was banned from the École des Beaux-Arts, however, she was able to have private art lessons due to her privileged upbringing, becoming the only official student of Édouard Manet.\n\nGonzalès painted still lifes, portraits, landscapes, and domestic scenes, and became very skillful in the use of pastels.\n\nShe eventually reached her goal of exhibiting with the Salon in Paris and passed away in 1883. The Salon de la Vie Moderne then held a retrospective of 90 of Eva Gonzalès’ artworks in 1885.\n\nEva Gonzalès, c. 1870; Unknown Unknown . Upload and stitch by Tatesic, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nA Loge at the Théâtre des Italiens (1874) by Eva Gonzalès\n\nDate Completed1874Dimensions (cm)98 x 130MediumOil on canvasWhere It Is Currently HousedMusée d’Orsay\n\nA Loge at the Théâtre des Italiens was initially rejected by the Salon. Gonzalès reworked the painting and resubmitted it, and it was accepted in 1879. The work was considered quite a provocative painting for the time. It depicts her sister, Jeanne Gonzalès, and her sister’s later husband, the artist Henri Guérard in an auditorium box. Jeanne is leaning forward and looks to the right, engrossed in the performance, while Guérard’s body faces her, but his gaze seems to pass over her head.\n\nIt may have been this disinterested and yet unphased attitude of the figures toward each other that caused a stir at the time it was painted.\n\nSome of Gonzalès’s other famous works include:\n\nNanny and Child (1877-1878)\n\nAwakening Woman (1877-1778)\n\nReading in the Forest (1880)\n\nA Loge at the Théâtre des Italiens (1874) by Eva Gonzalès; Eva Gonzalès, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nCecilia Beaux (1855 – 1942)\n\nArtistCecilia BeauxWhen the Artist Lived1855 – 1942Nationality of the ArtistAmericanWhere the Artist LivedAmericaAssociated Art MovementsImpressionism\n\nCecilia Beaux was an American portrait painter; her work was characterized by an academic style combined with an experimental quality that made her in demand by figures such as Georges Clemenceau and Theodore Roosevelt. Her portraits had a seriousness about them, while still capturing the subject’s personality.\n\nShe traveled to Paris to study at the Académie Julian at the peak of the Impressionist movement. There, she learned to use looser brushstrokes and paint en plein air.\n\nCecilia Beaux, c. 1888; Unknown author Unknown author, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nTwilight Confidences (1888) by Cecilia Beaux\n\nDate Completed1888Dimensions (cm)59.7 x 71.1MediumOil on canvasWhere It Is Currently HousedGeorgia Museum of Art, Athens, Georgia\n\nTwilight Confidences depicts two women from the seaside village of Concarneau in Brittany wearing wing-like caps and white collars that were commonly worn by women there. Beaux captures these crisp headdresses while rendering the soft glowing light from the sun on their skin.\n\nThe background seascape is not as detailed as the figures, lending it a kind of softness.\n\nSome of Beaux’s other famous works include:\n\nLes Derniers jours d’enfance (1883-1885)\n\nDorothea in the Woods (1897)\n\nSelf-Portrait (1894)\n\nTwilight Confidences (1888) by Cecilia Beaux; Cecilia Beaux, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nLouise Catherine Breslau (1856 – 1927)\n\nArtistLouise Catherine BreslauWhen the Artist Lived1856 – 1927Nationality of the ArtistGerman-SwissWhere the Artist LivedSwitzerland, Germany, FranceAssociated Art MovementsImpressionism\n\nLouise Catherine Breslau was a German-born artist who spent her childhood in Switzerland. She took up drawing as a child to stave off boredom while recovering from asthma and it soon became her passion, continuing her artistic studies in Paris when she was old enough. She succeeded in showing a self-portrait at the Salon and thereafter regularly had her work exhibited there.\n\nBreslau often painted en plein air and her style was sketch-like, using deft brushstrokes. Her portrait commissions were very popular and she opened her own studio.\n\nLouise Catherine Breslau in her studio in 1912; Agence Rol, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nLa Toilette (1898) by Louise Catherine Breslau\n\nDate Completed1898Dimensions (cm)62.9 x 65.4MediumOil on canvasWhere It Is Currently HousedPrivate Estate\n\nLa Toilette shows Breslau’s talent for depicting feelings expressed in a person’s face and displays her striated painting style. The subject’s back faces the viewer, while she gazes at someone on her left through the mirror’s reflection.

However, their forward thinking did not prevent the art establishment from ignoring female artists who had made a significant contribution, and even today we are still trying to revise art history. There are many paintings worth exploring by famous women Impressionists, and if you have felt inspired by this article, we encourage you to continue your exploration of their work.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Is Impressionism?\n\nThe 19th- and early 20th-century art movement of Impressionism mainly developed in France and is characterized by using bright colors and bold brushstrokes, depicting what they saw in front of them in terms of momentary effects of color and light. The picture created was therefore an impression, a moment captured in time by the artist. Impressionists painted scenes from everyday life, such as moments of landscapes, people talking, dancing, and sitting in the garden. Rather than using black lines, they used color instead to create definition and shadow.\n\nWhat Subject Matter Did Female Impressionists Paint?"
