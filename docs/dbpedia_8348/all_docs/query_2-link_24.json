        "text": "Along with Theodor Philipsen (1840-1920), Anna Ancher is regarded as the most important Impressionistic painter on the Danish art scene. But whereas the French Impressionists were intimately linked with modern life, Anna Ancher painted her paintings on the outskirts of the modern: from Skagen, the remotest part of Denmark, more opposed to than in tune with the hectic and the ephemeral.\n\nIn the present painting, the low-ceilinged room is filled with light, allowing Anna Ancher an opportunity to demonstrate her mastery of colour in the meeting between the blue, pink, and green hues."
