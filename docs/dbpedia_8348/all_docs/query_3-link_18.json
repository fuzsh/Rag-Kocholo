        "text": "Anna Ancher, a Danish artist working in the late 19th and early 20th century, is rightly revered\n\nin her native country as an extraordinary painter, but far less well-known on these\n\nshores. It’s a rare privilege to get to see so much of her work in a wide-ranging\n\nand thoughtful exhibition at the National Museum of Women in the Arts. “A World Apart:\n\nAnna Ancher and the Skagen Art Colony,” on display through May 12, features more than\n\n40 paintings by Ancher and other members of the Skagen Painters, a group working in\n\na remote fishing village in northern Denmark. It’s a thorough introduction to the\n\nmovement, showcasing exceptional works by\n\nPeder Severin Krøyer,\n\nViggo Johansen, Ancher’s husband\n\nMichael, and many more, but the focus of the show is mostly on Anna herself and how she thrived\n\nas an artist despite being relatively confined in terms of training and subject matter.\n\nAncher studied drawing at the Vilhelm Kyhn College of Painting in Copenhagen—women\n\nat the time weren’t allowed to attend the Royal Danish Academy of Art where her husband\n\nand most of the other Skagen Painters were formally trained. While their paintings\n\ndepict large-scale, dramatic scenes of fishermen and rowdy lunch parties, Ancher’s\n\neye is more humble, focusing on family members sewing and knitting, women in church,\n\nand quiet, serene interior scenes.\n\nNevertheless, Ancher’s paintings reveal a profound eye for detail and an infatuation\n\nwith light that makes her work seem luminous up close. One of her most famous works,\n\n“Sunlight in the blue room,” glows with a photo-realistic haze despite brush strokes\n\nthat look rough, almost haphazard, if you focus on them. It’s a painting that reveals\n\nthe influence of Impressionism while also paying tribute to the extraordinary quality\n\nof the light that far north in Jutland. The ray of sunlight that darts through the\n\nblue room’s window doesn’t look like an impression of light—it looks for all the world\n\nlike the painting itself is being viewed next to a window. You barely notice the small\n\ngirl seated in the chair, quietly knitting, and it’s telling that the title of the\n\npainting refers to its most compelling subject.\n\nSo many women in Ancher’s paintings are turned away from the painter, passive and\n\nalmost disinterested in their roles as subjects. In “The maid in the kitchen,” we\n\nsee only the back view of a girl in a red skirt standing by a window; in “blue room,”\n\nthe child sits with her back to the painter. “Interior with red poppies” features\n\nan elegant looking women with her head resting on her elbow, reading; in “Two little\n\ngirls learning how to sew” the face of a woman is clearly visible, rendered more so\n\nby light, but her eyes are closed. Women feature prominently in Ancher’s paintings\n\nbut their limited roles make them as placid as furniture or the bright pots of geraniums\n\nsitting on a windowsill.\n\nBy contrast, the men depicted by Krøyer and Michael Ancher embody energy and vigor,\n\nwhether straining to pull fishing nets in from the ocean or fastening lifebelts in\n\nthe wake of a storm. When Michael Ancher paints his wife and other family members\n\nin “Christmas Day 1900,” their eyes and features are clearly defined, although they\n\nseem to gaze slightly off into the distance. When Ancher uses her husband as a subject,\n\nhe may be at home but the focus is on his masculine exploits. In “The new hunting\n\nboots” he stares across the room at a tall, brown pair, shoes off, while in “Breakfast\n\nbefore the hunt” he eats, a dog and a workbag patiently at his side.\n\nThe enormously different scales of Ancher and her husband’s scope of vision as painters\n\nis revealed quite dramatically in “The entrance to our garden,” one of the few paintings\n\nby Ancher that can be likened to a landscape (women were typically restricted to interior\n\nsubjects). Ancher’s focus is so limited that she paints only the front gate as it\n\napproaches her house, cutting herself off from capturing the top of the front door\n\nor more than one third of the tree that grows in the yard. It’s a timid work, but\n\nthe way the path leads quietly forward seems to suggest a determined sense of purpose.\n\nAncher’s remarkable talent, although restrained by social mores, comes through with\n\nthe same subtle fortitude, and her unparalleled ability to capture the tiny details\n\nof light bouncing off different surfaces has helped her work rightly endow her as\n\none of the greatest Danish painters of her age.\n\n“A World Apart: Anna Ancher and the Skagen Art Colony” is at the National Museum of\n\nWomen in the Arts through May 12.
