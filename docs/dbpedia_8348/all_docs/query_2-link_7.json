        "text": "Anna and Michael Ancher are one of the most famous artists couples in Scandinavian art history. Both of them were leading figures in the group of Skagen Painters.\n\nMichael Ancher was born in Rutsker on the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. After meeting the Danish artist Theodor Philipsen, he enrolled at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. Here, he was encouraged to travel to Skagen, the most northern town in Denmark. In the heroic local fishermen of Skagen, Ancher found a motif that would become a recurring subject of his painting and make his name as a leading realist painter.\n\nAnna Ancher (neé Brøndum) was the only artist in the group of Skagen Painters who was born in Skagen. Her parents were the proprietors of the local inn, and here she met the visiting artists, who inspired her to pursue an artistic career.\n\nAnna and Michael were married in August 1880 on her 21st birthday. Earlier the same year, she had made her debut at the annual Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition, where he had enjoyed considerable success with his painting 'Will he round the point?'. Thus began a lifelong partnership between the two as spouses, colleagues, and later, as parents.\n\nAnna and Michael Ancher's only child, Helga Ancher, became a painter like her parents. Upon Anna Ancher’s death in 1935 she inherited the house but did not take up residence and left it unaltered. In her will, Helga Ancher bequeathed Anchers Hus, its interiors and the art collection to a foundation with her name. In 1967, three years after her death, Anchers was opened to the public as a museum."
