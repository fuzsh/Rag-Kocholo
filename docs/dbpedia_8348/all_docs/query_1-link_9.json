        "text": "Illuminated Interiors\n\nThe golden hour in art extends beyond landscapes to include portraits and interiors. Danish artist Anna Ancher (1859-1935) followed the trail of the sun around domestic spaces. Ancher was part of the Skagen Painters artist colony in northern Denmark from the late 1870s onward. Her work is linked to Impressionism, Realism, and Symbolism. She explored the way light occupies space and radiates the warmth of the sun. Although she primarily painted women, her subjects also included men, children, and landscapes. Ancher had a successful career as an artist and is considered one of Denmark’s most remarkable painters.\n\nBasking in the Glow\n\nAside from the exquisite light, the golden hour also changes the mood of the atmosphere. Polish artist Leon Wyczółkowski (1852-1936) managed to achieve just that in his paintings. He was a graphic artist, painter, and sculptor. He was also one of the leading artists in the Young Poland Movement and experimented with a variety of printmaking techniques. Wyczółkowski was deeply inspired by the rustic countryside of the Ukraine and the rural lifestyle. Evidence of the golden hour sweep through his emotionally charged works rife with a glowing intensity.\n\nBlazing Hues\n\nBritish-American landscape painter Thomas Moran (1837-1926) is best known for his atmospheric landscapes and seascapes. He was greatly influenced by the enigmatic landscapes of the American West, especially those of Yellowstone National Park, Utah, and the Grand Canyon. Deeply inspired by the paintings of J.M.W. Turner, Moran’s admiration is evident in his wild seascapes. The intensity of light and colors in Moran’s paintings generate the dynamic energy of the golden hour.\n\nMaster of Light\n\nFrench Impressionist painter Claude Monet (1840-1926) was clearly inspired by the dramatic light of the golden hour. He created some of his greatest works during this time of day. Monet was the ultimate plein-air painter, working on site with large canvases to soak up the glow of the golden hour. The artist painted several series based around the sun at different times of the day. Depicting both country and cityscapes, he seemed on an endless quest to investigate the essence of light. Some of Monet’s most notable series are Les Meules (haystacks) and Poplars.\n\nThe fleeting and ephemeral enchantment of the golden hour swells with an almost mystical reverence. Artists will undoubtedly continue to be inspired by the luminous magic of sunlight and strive to echo the effects of light in landscape and portraiture, expressing the greatness and magnificence of nature."
