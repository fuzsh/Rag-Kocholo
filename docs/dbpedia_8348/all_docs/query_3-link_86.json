        "text": "As promised in my last blog featuring the Skagen husband and wife painters, Michael and Anna Ancher, My Daily Art Display today features another married couple who resided in Skagen, Denmark and were leading lights of the Skagen artist commune. Their names were Marie and Peder Severin Krøyer.\n\nMarie Martha Mathilde Triepcke was one of three children born to German parents in the Danish capital of Copenhagen in June 1867. She developed an early love for art and following normal schooling she decided that her future lay as an artist. For a female to train to become an artist in Denmark in those days was very difficult as women were not allowed to enrol on art courses at the Danish Royal Academy of Art and so she had to study drawing and painting at private schools. One of these art schools was the Kunstnernes Frie Studieskoler, a Copenhagen art school which had opened in 1882 as a protest against the policies and rigid dictates of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and by so doing offered an alternative to the Academy’s rigid educational program. The artist who looked after the new students was the Danish painter, Kristian Zartman. Another teacher at the art school when Maria attended was the young artist Peter Severin Krøyer. During her time at these private art establishments she received tuition in model drawing as well as some landscape, still life and portraiture. She and other artists, both male and female, were encouraged to spend time in the countryside and paint en plein air. In 1887, when she was twenty years of age she made her first trip to Skagen which had by this time become home to a flourishing artist colony.\n\nTwo years later in December 1888 at the age of twenty-one she left Denmark and travelled alone to Paris to live and further her artistic education. She studied at a number of studios including those of the French painters, Gustave Courtois and Alfred Roll. One of the studios she worked in was run by the French painter, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and it was whilst working in his atelier she became great friends with a fellow co-worker Anna Ancher, who along with her husband Michael, featured in my last blog. Marie soon became one of the Parisian “Scandinavian artistic-set” and one of these fellow artists was Peter Severin Krøyer whom she had met before in Copenhagen. Who knows why, but suddenly the relationship between Peter and Marie intensified and they fell in love. It was a whirlwind romance because in July 1889, within six months of their Paris meeting they were married.\n\nPeter Severin Krøyer was sixteen years older than Maria. Although he is often looked upon as a Danish painter, in fact he was born in the Norwegian town of Stavanger in July 1851. His entry into the world was not without trauma as when he was just a young baby; he was taken from his mother, Ellen, as she was considered unfit to look after her son due to being mentally ill. Peter went to live in Copenhagen where he was brought up by his maternal aunt and her husband. At the age of nine, because of his love of drawing, they arranged for him to attend art classes at a private school. A year later, he was enrolled at the Copenhagen Technical Institute. From there he attended the Royal Danish Academy of Art and in 1870, at the age of nineteen, he completed his formal studies. He, like many aspiring artists, began exhibiting his work at the Charlottenborg Palace in Copenhagen and his big breakthrough came in 1874 when the tobacco magnate Heinrich Hirschsprung bought one of his works. Hirschsprung would become one of Peter Krøyer’s patrons and funded his early European travels. This connection with Hirschsprung also had a connection with his wife-to-be Marie, as her childhood school friend was Ida Hirschsprung whose uncle was Heinrich and it was through Ida that Marie came into social contact with the Hirschsprungs and their circle of friends including Peter Krøyen.\n\nMarie Triepcke actually sat for Krøyen for his 1877 painting entitled The Duet. She is the woman in red at the left of the painting.\n\nFor the next five years Krøyer travelled extensively visiting Spain and Italy as well as spending summer months in Brittany, all the time honing his artistic skills. During the late 1870’s he would also come across the “new kids on the block” – the young French impressionists such as Monet, Sisley, Degas and Renoir. However Krøyer was more attuned to the academic painters of the time. After roaming for those five years he finally returned “home” to Denmark and in late 1881 and in the summer of 1882 he went to Skagen. He was so enamoured by this area that he bought himself a home there and it was here that he spent his summers before returning to his Copenhagen apartment in the winter months to work in his studio. Between 1882 and 1904 Krøyer was a leading figure at the newly founded Kunstnernes Frei Studieskoler where he oversaw the life drawing classes which allowed students to draw and paint images of live nudes, an art form which, at the time, was not allowed at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts.\n\nMarie Krøyer returned to Skagen with her husband Peter in 1891 and became part of the Skagen artists’ commune. Once married, her artistic output lessened for she was concentrating on interior design and floral still-life painting which could be incorporated into interior design. Another reason could have been her feeling artistically inferior in comparison to her husband, or maybe she was just overwhelmed by the burden of motherhood and looking after the house and her husband. She was quite disheartened for she was quoted as once saying:\n\n“…I sometimes think that the whole effort is in vain, we have far too much to overcome … what significance does it really have if I paint, I shall never, never achieve anything really great … I want to believe in our cause, even if at times it may be terribly difficult…”\n\nIn 1895 she gave birth to a daughter, Vibeke and the family moved to a cottage in Skagen Vesterby where she spent time designing the interior of their home. Her life with her husband became very challenging due to a decline in his mental health and his frequent incarceration in mental homes. Her husband’s eyesight also began to gradually fail in 1900. In 1902 during a journey to Italy Marie met the Swedish composer and violinist Hugo Alfvén. She and Alfvén became lovers but Krøyer refused to give his wife a divorce. This changed in 1905 when he found out that his wife was pregnant with Alfvén’s child. Once divorced, Marie moved from Denmark and went to live with her husband and their baby daughter Margita in Tällberg, Sweden.\n\nThe couple had a new home built there, which became known as Alfvénsgården, and Maria created the interior design and furnishings of the building. The couple lived together unmarried for seven years before finally marrying in 1912 and their life together lasted twenty-four years until in 1936 they divorced. Marie retained her beloved Alfvénsgården and remained there until she died in Stockholm in May 1940, a few weeks before her 73rd birthday. On her death the house reverted to her daughter Margita and when Margita died the house went to Vibeke, Marie’s daughter from her marriage to Peter Krøyer.\n\nPeter Severin Krøyer died in November 1909, aged 58, at which time his sight had completely failed and he was blind.\n\nOne of Krøyer’s best known works entitled Hip Hip Hurrah: An Artist’s Party on Skagen came about from his love of photography and his newly bought camera which he purchased in 1885. It was during a garden party at the house of Michael and Anna Ancher that he took the photograph which captured the celebrating guests. Delighted with the photograph, Krøyer decided to convert it into a large scale painting and wanted to bring in his models to Ancher’s garden so as to do some preliminary sketches. Michael Ancher would not go along with the plan and would not countenance the intrusion of the artist and his models into his private garden so Krøyer had the table moved to his garden and set about the work. It took him three years to complete the “stage-managed” work which in some ways resembles Renoir’s 1881 Luncheon of the Boating Party (see My Daily Art Display Aug 2nd 2011). The garden party guests are seen celebrating and raising their glasses in a toast. In the painting we have many of the leading members of the Skagen artist colony. With her back to us is Martha Johansen who was along with Maria Triepcke and Anna Ancher one of the triumvirate of great female Skagen painter. Standing on the far side of the table are the Skagen painters Viggo Johansen, the Norwegian Christian Krogh and dressed in brown Krøyer himself. The man in the white suit is Degn Brøndum, Michale Ancher’s brother in law. Next to him is Michael Ancher. On this side of the table we have the Swedish painter Oscar Björck, and the Danish painter Thorvald Niss. The lady leaning back is Helene Christensen, the local schoolteacher and wife of painter Karl Madsen and closest to us, dressed in white is Anna Ancher and her four year old daughter Helga. As in many of the Skagen paintings the feature of this work is not the people but the Skagen sunlight which streams through the trees casting shadows on the white tablecloth and shimmers on the bottles and glasses.\n\nIn contrast to Peter Krøyer’s depictions of his beautiful wife Marie, often seen strolling along the Skagen beaches, Marie’s 1889 Self Portrait is much more sombre and severe. Half her face is in shadow in this work and it could reflect her state of mind at the time she painted the work.\n\nIn contrast to this dark portrait we have Peter Krøyer’s painting entitled Summer Evening on Skagen’s Southern Beach which he completed in 1893. The idea for this work came to Krøyer during one of the many dinner parties he attended after which the diners would take twilight stroll along the shoreline. It is an idyllic setting and we see Peter’s wife Marie. Once again like paintings I featured by Michael Ancher and his wife the colour blue featured a lot in Krøyer’s painting during his stay in Skagen. This twilight period when day starts to lose out to night was often referred to the “blue hour” which was how they say saw the sky and sea merge into one shade of blue.\n\nI finish this blog with a photograph of my four Skagen artists, which I have featured in my last two blogs, sitting around a dining table at the Brondum hotel once owned by Anna Ancher’s parents\n\nOften in my blogs I have talked about artists’ colonies, places where artists congregated, visited and sometimes lived. In England, I looked at some artists who lived and painted in Newlyn and St Ives. In France there was the commune of Barbizon, close to the Fontainebleau Forest, just a short train ride from the French capital, which was home to the leaders of the Barbizon School, the painters Théodore Rousseau and Jean-François Millet. There was also the artist colony in Brittany at Pont-Aven, where great artists such as Gaugin and Émile Bernard plied their trade. In fact, in most countries, there were areas favoured by artists, usually because of the beautiful landscape and the special light which could be savoured by the en plein air painters during the long summer days. Today and in my next blog, I am focusing on another artist commune and two husband and wife couples who were considered the leading figures of the artistic group. Let me introduce you to four painters who formed part of the Skagen commune of artists. They were Michael Peter Ancher and his wife Anna and Peder Severin Krøyer and his wife Marie.\n\nSkagen, which is part of Jutland, is at the most northerly tip of Denmark. It is a finger of land, which juts out into the sea and is looked upon as the divider between the great waterways of the Skagerrak and Kattergat straits, the former connecting with the North Sea and the latter which leads in to the Baltic Sea. It was at this place that the artists discovered an exclusive and exceptional quality of light. The Norwegian naturalist painter and illustrator, Christian Krohg, best summed up the allure of Skagen for painters when he described the area:\n\n“…This country is mild, smiling, fantastic, mighty, wild, wonderful and awe-inspiring…it is Skagen – there is no other place on the face of this earth like it…”\n\nThis unspoilt area was a magnet to artists who flocked to this picturesque destination in the late 19th century in an attempt to escape city life. For them it was a bolt-hole and an opportunity to artistically catalogue a beautiful untouched area, which they believed one day would vanish.\n\nMy blog today focuses on Michael and Anna Ancher a talented couple of Skagen School painters.\n\nMichael Peter Ancher was born in June 1849 at Rutsker, a small Danish village on the island of Bornholm. Once he had completed his classical education he set his sights on becoming an artist and in 1871, aged twenty-two, he enrolled on a four-year art course at the Royal Danish Academy of Art. It was whilst on this course that he developed a liking for genre painting, paintings which depicted everyday life. One of his fellow students at the Academy, who befriended him, was Karl Madsen and it was he who persuaded Ancher to accompany him to Skagen in 1874. Ancher’s journey to Skagen with his friend was to influence both his future life as well as his art. Ancher fell in love with Skagen and he decided to make it his home. Skagen was not just a home to artists but was also one for many writers who loved the tranquility of the area and found it conducive in their quest to write a good book or poetry. Hans Christian Andersen often visited Skagen but another writer who was to play a part in Michale Ancher’s paintings was the poet and dramatist, Holger Henrik Herholdt Drachmann who had come to Skagen to write and learn to paint. Drachmann was in awe of the bravery shown by the local fishermen and sailors and often wrote about them in prose and verse.\n\nIn 1879, five years after settling down in Skagen Michael Ancher painted one of his most famous works, a painting which featured the hazardous life of the local fishermen. It was entitled Vil han klare pynten (Will he Round the Point?). This work was to be Ancher’s great artistic breakthrough. It was such a popular work that no fewer than two buyers were about to acquire the work before a third one stepped in and took the painting. So who were the proposed buyers? Initially the Copenhagen Art Association were going to buy the painting but agreed to relinquish their grip on the work when the Danish National Gallery stated that they wanted to purchase Ancher’s painting. However they too had to step aside when the king, Christian IX, expressed a “wish” that he should own the work! In the painting we see a dozen men, on Skagen’s southern shore, as the waves lap around their feet. They are all dressed in fisherman’s garb and they are all staring worriedly out to sea worrying about the safe return of one of their comrade’s boats.\n\nAs with many small fishing communities the fishermen also acted as lifeboatmen who put their lives on the line for those in peril on the high seas. Ancher depicted such an occasion in his 1883 work entitled Redningsbåden køres gennem klitterne (The Lifeboat is Taken through the Dunes) in which we see the fishermen arduously hauling their horse-drawn lifeboat cart over the snow-covered sand dunes so that it can be launched into the dark and threatening sea. It is mid-winter and the skies are dark and menacing and in the right background we catch glimpse of the stricken ship. Two men at the tail of the line of fisherman shout to persons unknown, who are outside the picture, and this gesture adds to the sense of urgency and tension of the moment.\n\nThe final work by Michael Ancher featuring the heroism of the Skagen fishermen was completed in 1896 and entitled The Drowned Fisherman. The painting is inspired by the death in 1894 of the Skagen fisherman and lifeboatman, Lars Kruse. Kruse was famous throughout Denmark because of a book written by Holger Drachmann which told of Kruse’s heroism as a rescuer. Michael Ancher had already painted a number of portraits of Kruse but this final painting of the Kruse will be the best remembered. Kruse had become the chairman of the Skagen lifeboat and had, through the time as a rescuer, received many awards for the bravery he had shown during his rescue work. An engraving on one of his awards summed up his courage stating:\n\n“…Humble in word, proud of his deed, Christian in deed, Man in his boat…”\n\nLars Kruse was killed in 1894 whilst trying to land his boat on Skagen’s North Shore in a winter storm. Through Drachmann’s book and Ancher’s painting the name of Lars Kruse lives on in the memory of the Danish people. After over almost twenty years of depictions of Skagen fishermen carrying out their perilous job, this painting of Kruse’s death was the last one by Michael Ancher to feature the local fishermen.\n\nShortly after Michael Ancher first visited Skagen in 1874, he met fifteen year old Anna Kristine Brondum, a native of Skagen and one of six children of Erik Andersen Brøndum and his wife Ane Hedvig Møller, who ran a local grocery business and the Brondums Guesthouse. He had been invited to Anna’s confirmation and from that first meeting friendship blossomed. Anna, although still young, and Michael had one shared passion – art. In 1875, at the age of sixteen, Anna began a three year drawing and painting course at the Vilhelm Kyhn College of Painting in Copenhagen. This college, known as Tegneskolen for Kvinder (Painting School for Women) was started in 1865 by the Danish landscape painter, Vilhelm Khyn, at a time when women were not allowed to enrol on art courses at the Danish Academy of Art. On returning to her family home in Skagen her friendship with Michael Ancher developed rapidly. They were engaged in 1878 and in 1880 the couple were married. Three years later, in 1883, their daughter Helga was born. Anna was determined to buck the trend which seemed to decree that after the birth of a child the mother should give up all her dreams and solely concentrate her life on the upbringing of her children and the task of looking after her husband and house. Anna refused to give up her art. The following year Michael, Anna and their baby daughter, Helga went to live in a house in Markvej. The family lived there for 30 years. In 1913 they had the house extended to make more space for Michael and Anna’s art.\n\nIn 1891 Anna Ancher completed a beautiful painting which featured her eight year old daughter Helga. It was entitled Sunlight in a Blue Room. In the painting we see Helga sitting in the blue room of the Brøndum’s Hotel which was once run by Anna’s parents. She actually completed a number of portraits of her mother, Ane, in this very room. We see Helga sitting quietly drawing on a pad. She too, like her mother and father before her, would study art in the Danish capital. However, the beauty of this painting is the way in which Anna has captured the light which streams through the window. It is a painting of the interior and only the shadows on the wall give us a hint about the exterior.\n\nOne of the most moving paintings I came across by Anna Ancher was one she completed in 1902 simply entitled Grief. It was based on a dream she once had – or maybe it was a nightmare. The old woman kneeling on the right is Anna’s mother, Ane Brøndum and it could be that the woman on the left is a self portrait. Anna had been brought up in a very religious household although once away from the family environment and studying at art college, she questioned her religious beliefs especially as she had become surrounded by radical and often atheistic artists who formed the Skagen artistic commune. In some ways this questioning of her early religious family background may have caused her to feel ill at ease and out of this could have come this dream which compares her with her mother. One is old, one is young, one is fully clothed whist the other is naked. The contrast is plain to see as the two people gather around a cross. Is the younger girl praying for forgiveness for her loss of faith or just simply praying that she should be understood? Is the old lady literally praying for the soul of her grow-up child? Is that how Anna envisaged her relationship with her mother?\n\nIn 1913 Anna painted two portraits of her mother who was then 87 years old. They are very intimate depictions of her elderly mother, and completed just three years before she died.\n\nMichael Ancher died in 1927, aged 78 and Anna Ancher died eight years later in 1935, and the house the lay empty. However their daughter Helga Ancher, who died in 1964, stipulated in her will that any money that she left should be used to create a fund to be known as The Helga Ancher Foundation. The money in the Fund was to be used to renovate her parents’ house and it should house all the paintings by her mother and father that she owned. In 1967, three years after Helga’s death her wish was fulfilled and the museum was opened.\n\nIn my next blog I will look at the works of two other Skagen painters, Peder Severin Krøyer and his wife Marie, who were also great friends of the Anchers."
