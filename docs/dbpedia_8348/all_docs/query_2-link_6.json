        "text": "Towards the end of the 19th century, an artists' colony developed in the far north of Denmark. In Skagen, Jutland, the days of summer were long and filled with a unique light. Almost magnetically, the almost untouched land attracted Danish painters from the big city. Michael Anker was one of the first to fill the small fishing village with artistic life. The local inn was run by the Brøndum family at the time. The innkeepers welcomed the incoming artists with open arms. The couple's daughter was Anna Kristine Brøndum. Anna was taken with the artistic environment and through regular contact, the then 15-year-old Dane's desire to become a painter grew. With the support of Michael Ancher and other painters, the parents allowed the training. Anna spent the winter months from then on at the private school of Vilhelm Kyns in Copenhagen. The summers Anna spent in the circle of Skagen painters, who taught her to paint in the open air.\n\nDanish painters were given a gift with the sky over North Jutland and the sea, which was envied by impressionist painters. Nevertheless, none succeeded in transposing the light-flooded lightness of the French painters. Kroyer and Michael Anker were too bound to the realistic depictions and naturalism. Anna Brøndum initially followed their ideas and found her models in the Old Masters of the Netherlands. Unlike her male colleagues, Anna preferred to paint interiors. The artist's favorite motifs were interior views depicting the everyday life of women. Simple kitchens, living rooms and work areas with everyday situations. What was special about Anna's works was the play with light. Incident sunshine and light reflections in the room give the scenes the expression of a fleeting moment.\n\nAnna married artist Michael Ancher and took his name. The artist couple became the center of the artist colony. Anna continued to work as a painter after the birth of their daughter Helga. A drastic experience occurred during the visit of the Norwegian painter Christian Krohg. The artist stopped in Skagen after a visit to Paris. Here he told of the works of Manet and the fantastic works of the Impressionists. Anna Ancher was the only one to take up and implement the innovative color scheme. The artist developed into one of Europe's leading colorists and is considered a pioneer of the Impressionist movement in Scandinavia. The Dane developed an independent coloring and used it for her strong content. One of the most famous examples of this is the work Sunshine in the Blue Parlor. High windows light up the interior, which is designed in the Scandinavian fashion. It is the blue parlor of her parents' house, intensely illuminated by the light of the sun. Anna's daughter Helga is sitting in front of the window and the gold of her hair is reflected in the curtains, creating a unique harmony.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, an artists' colony developed in the far north of Denmark.
