        "text": "Biography\n\nDanish painter, part of a family painters. Michael Peter Ancher and his wife Anna Ancher, who were married in 1880, were at the centre of the artists' colony that emerged at Skagen in Jutland during the 1870s and 1880s. Their daughter Helga Ancher (1881-1964) was also active as a painter. In 1967 the family home in Skagen was opened as a museum.\n\nAnna Ancher studied drawing at Vilhelm Kyhn's drawing school, Copenhagen (1875-78), and painting under Puvis de Chavannes in Paris (1889). Her genre paintings and portraits are more intimate than those of her husband. Many of her everyday interiors contain a characteristic image of the shadow of window bars on a sunlit wall, displaying her natural skill as a colourist. An exquisite example is the Blind Woman in her Room (1883; Copenhagen, Hirschsprungske Samling), in which the dark, bent figure of an old woman with worn hands is silhouetted against a golden sunlit wall. Women at work, particularly sewing or plucking poultry, are among her favourite subjects, as in the Girl in the Kitchen (1883-86; Copenhagen, Hirschsprungske Samling). The girl stands by the window, turning her back to the viewer and immersed in her daily duties. Her red skirt and black jacket stand out brilliantly against a yellow and orange curtain, enlivened by the sunlight shining on the floor through a half-open door."
