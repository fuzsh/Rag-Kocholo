        "text": "\"Money has taken wildly different forms throughout history — shells, gold coins, digital data. How did this happen? Why do we trust these ever-changing forms, when their worth can rise and fall (and even rise again)?\" ― Information Tab\n\nThe Price of Trust is a limited time event which mainly focuses on Money. Like the Tech Tree of Life, this one features generators that produce currency per second. Unlike other events in Season 1, this event is the first one that features multiple different currencies.\n\nStory[]\n\nOpening[]\n\n\"Humans spend their lives accumulating things, fragments of metal, pieces of paper, bits of data. Why are these objects so treasured?\"\n\nEnding[]\n\n\"It appears that Money can be anything, a shell, a knotted rope, a plastic card, though these objects are worth nothing, our collective trust makes them precious.\"\n\nObjectives & Rewards[]\n\nExplore Money (10 Requirements)\n\nCollect Metallurgy → Logit Console2\n\nCollect Cowrie Shells → Trust in Community Badge\n\nCollect 1.00 T Shells → Logit Console 3\n\nCollect Negotiable Instruments →: Logit Console5\n\nCollect 100 Coins → Logit Console7\n\nCollect Fiat Money →Trust in Institutions Badge\n\nCollect Payment Cards → Logit Console8\n\nCollect 30 Electronic Money, Blockchain → Logit Console10\n\nCollect 20 Future Money → Logit Console15\n\nCollect One world, One currency?, Decentralized Utopia?, Post-scarcity Society? → Trust in Technology Badge\n\nBadges[]\n\nThis exploration holds some rewards already mentioned above. The main ones being these three badges: Bronze: Trust in Community, Silver: Trust in Institutions and Gold: Trust in Technology which have an effect on all other evolutionary branches, speeding up every simulation by 1%, and also speeding up production in future The Price of Trust simulations by 5, 10 and 15% respectively.\n\nTrust in Community[]\n\n\"Sharing is caring -- at a foundational level, we must be able to trust our community to deal with us fairly. If we can't trust out neighbors, how can we trust strangers?\"\n\nTrust in Institutions[]\n\n\"As populations grow beyond a size that allows for one-to-one trust, governments and banks regulate money. Now we can trade with strangers hundreds of miles away and trust that the money is worth the same.\"\n\nTrust in Technology[]\n\n\"Technology's advancement has empowered more people to participate directly in economic exchanges. As financial instruments become more accessible, we no longer need to rely on intermediaries to control our money, so long as we can trust in the technology itself.\"\n\nGenerators & In-Game Descriptions[]\n\nThe Price of Trust event features five generators, each of which produce their own unique currency (except Future).\n\nGenerators[]\n\nIcon Name Currency Description First Cost Cost Growth Base Production Requirements Commodity Currency Shells Specialised societies required a \"medium of exchange,\" trusted and accepted across society as payment for goods and services. While the oldest currencies used cattle, cloth, tools and other common, useful objects, over time, these evolved into symbolic forms and pure accounting units. 25 7% 1 Shell/sec Specializing Coins Coins With the sixth and seventh centuries BCE, rulers began minting coins. Standardized and produced at volume, coins were a uniform currency, accepted as legal tender throughout their domains. 1.00B Shells 9% 1 Coin/sec Metallurgy Paper Money Notes Lighter and more easily transportable than metal-based coinage, paper money has become the default currency of the modern world. 1.00B Coins 11% 1 Note/sec Negotiable Instruments Electronic Money Credits As the world went electronic, financial systems followed. Aided by rudimentary computer networks, Wall Street brokers could execute trades over the phone, no face-to-face interaction required, while banks could treat money as numbers linked to an account more than physical coins or bills. 1.00B Notes 13% 1 Card/sec Fiat Money Future Money Cryptocurrency In the twenty-first century, computer networks are getting faster and more interconnected. With the internet, laymen can access markets as never before, even as specialists employ artifical intelligence to make financial decisions. In a digital world, money is increasingly rendered in ones and zeros. 1.00 Credits 15% 100,000 Cards/sec TBA\n\nUpgrades & In-Game Descriptions[]\n\nNo Effect[]\n\nName Efficiency Description Cost Requirements Hunting and Gathering N/A For hundreds of thousands of years, humans lived in roving bands, hunting and foraging for food. 0.0004 Cowrie Shells N/A Gifting Tap gains +0.00004 per tap In hunter-gatherer communities, gifts were used as a way to strengthen social ties. The oldest known economic system, the gift economy, is particularly viable in small and close-knit groups. 0.0005 Cowrie Shells Hunting and Gathering Settling Tap gains +0.00995 per tap The discovery of farming created denser, more sedentary societies. Eventually, as populations continued to grow, the earliest towns began to emerge. 0.006 Cowrie Shells Gifting Specializing Tap gains +0.99 per tap As populations grew, economic roles became specialized.

To combat counterfeiters, societies devised methods to test for fake coins, while governments imposed strict penalties, including execution. 5.00T Coins Iconography Credit 1000% When money has been borrowed or payment deferred, lenders must be able to trust that the debt will be repaid.

Decentralized Utopia? 200% Throughout all of history, the powerful have controlled society, but technology may provide an answer. As cryptocurrencies become accepted, banks will lose their grips on the levers of financial power, as monetary power is diffused across the blockchain. Instead of financial institutions and government regulation determining the worth and value of our money, it will be the people in control. 40.00T Cryptocurrency What's next? Darwinium Cube 200% Darwinium cubes are the most valuable resource in the known universe. Darwinium 1 Virtual Currencies\n\nDuration(s)[]\n\nNovember 23rd, 2022 ,12:00 PM - November 29th, 2022, 12:00 PM\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThere is a minigame in the garden tab that rewards you 10 Darwinium.\n\nIn order to get them, you have to tap on the:\n\nCommodity Currency, Coins and Paper Money generators' targets, which launches cowrie shells, coins, and banknotes to the box underneath. This fills the first tree bars on the Darwinium reward box.\n\nATM (Electronic Money generator), which slowly fills a balance bar in the ATM screen. Doing this thrice fills the fourth bar.\n\ntransaction node (Future Money generator), which increases in nodes until you hit 100 of them, which fills the circle in the top right and allows you to transfer. Doing this thrice fills the final bar. There are always 411 connections in the nodes.\n\nDoing this minigame after the reward is given gives you bonus currency (30 seconds of the chosen generator's output per 100 taps of \"deposit\"), but no more Darwinium.\n\nThis is the first event that has an upgrade (Darwinium Cube) that costs Darwinium. It costs only one and makes the Future Money generator more efficient.\n\nThere are five currencies in this event, the most out of any.\n\nThe Credits currency turns to the Cryptocurrency currency after unlocking Future Money, presumably due to the fact it can't fit any more.\n\nYour production/sec can be accessed by clicking the tab. It turns back if you click it again. This is because of the space problem this event faces.\n\nThe Decentralised Utopia? has the longest description (I currently know of so this can be subject to change) of any upgrades in the game, reaching a staggering 11 lines with 60 words."
