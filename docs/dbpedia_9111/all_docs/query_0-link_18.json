While the West is obsessed with gold, Chinese seem to have always been preoccupied with silver. Throughout Chinese history, from ancient times to the present, the love of silver seems to have deepened over time, and the arduous process of silver becoming China’s base currency conceals the secret threads of China’s momentous historical “\n\n1\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\nchanges. Silver haunts China’s remote antiquity. From an archaeological perspective, the Shang (Yin) dynasty (c. 1600–1000 b.c.e.) used silver, cowries, and other such materials: “The roads for trade with farmers and artisans were open, and tortoiseshell, cowries, gold, coins, knives and cloth were widely used as currency. These date as far back as the rule of Gaoxin Shi, before the Shang,1 but no records survive. . . . The currency under Yu of Xia2 included three metals, yellow, white and red, as well as coins, cloth, knives, tortoiseshell and cowrie.”3 Here “white” refers to silver. During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods,4 silver already possessed some of the functions of currency, and various silver cowries and other currency from that time have been unearthed. Even so, prior to the Five Dynasties (907–960),5 silver was mostly used for ornamentation and reward, and it did not serve as a major medium of exchange from the Qin to the Han dynasties: “Under Qin rule there were two grades of currency: gold as the higher currency, and bronze cash, of the same material as the Zhou currency, called the Banliang. Pearls, jade, tortoiseshell, cowrie, silver and tin were classified as instruments, decoration and treasure, not as currency.”6 Silver’s course from “not currency” to monetization as legal tender has not been without complications. During China’s Warring States, Qin, and Han periods, gold and bronze cash were most widely used. The Six Dynasties (222–589) and Sui and Tang dynasties used both bronze coins and silk. During the Song, Jin, Yuan, and early Ming dynasties, paper currency called cash notes (qianchao) circulated. Only from the Five Dynasties onward did silver gradually become a medium of payment. From the Northern and Southern Song dynasties onward, silver came into common use along with bronze cash, and it was officially monetized in China in the midand late Ming dynasty. Over the next 500 years, up until the 1830s, China retained silver as its currency through wars large and small and countless catastrophes, with both tael silver and silver dollars in common use. Compared with the monetary history of the West, China’s monetary system displayed different characteristics from the outset. In ancient times, the West had a multitude of small kingdoms and international trade flourished. Although a king could designate a currency and its worth within his country, these stipulations could not be applied in the domains of other countries. From earliest times, coins minted from precious metal\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nwere locked in as acceptable materials of commerce in the international market. As early as the seventh century b.c.e., the kingdom of Lydia in Asia Minor began minting coins from an alloy of gold and silver (electrum) with set weights and denominated value (China did not begin minting silver coins until the last years of the Qing dynasty). This paved the way for the predominance of precious metal coins in the monetary history of the West. In comparison, for most of the time before the mid-Ming dynasty, various base-metal coins (bronze, iron) constituted the main forms of Chinese currency, interspersed with some precocious legends of monetary history such as China’s ultimately failed experiment with paper currency, which lasted more than 400 years, from the Northern Song to the early Ming dynasties. Looking back at China’s monetary history, the overlap of inflation and deflation frequently lured the government into large-scale plunder of private wealth by issuing large-denomination currencies with no reserve value, or by minting inferior coins. Defying draconian laws and harsh bans, ordinary citizens fought back by boycotting bad money and privately minting currency. At the end of the day, even if the emperor was willing and needed to accept market testing, the fate of China’s various currencies—from the bronze half-ouncer (banliang) and five-grainer (wuzhu) coins to the Kaiyuan coins and on to the Song dynasty’s bronze and iron coins and paper currency—was basically inseparable from the rise and fall of dynasties. Even after silver was monetized from the mid-Ming onward, silver was used as a metage (weighted) currency in China, and not in the minted form that had long been customary in the West. Before the Sui and Tang dynasties, tael (liang) silver in the form of ingots (yinting or yinding), silver cakes (yinbing), or tablets (yinhu) can be traced back to the Han dynasty. Ancient ingots (ting) were interchangeable with sycee (ding), and beginning with the Song dynasty they were typically called silver ingots or silver sycee, while sycee began being called yuanbao in the Yuan dynasty. It is said that in the third year of the Yuan dynasty (1266), the term yuanbao, meaning “Yuan dynasty treasure,”7 was applied to silver cast into fifty-tael sycee at balancing standard (assay) bureaus (pingzhunku). At the outset, “yuanbao” appeared on bronze coins as well as on silver sycee, but eventually it became a generic term for silver sycee. Generally speaking, from the\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\nHan to the Ming dynasty, silver sycee gradually developed from a round cake form into an elongated form, and then contracted in the middle for the yuanbao form.8 In numismatic terms, this development made the currency more attractive, but in practical use it was an inconvenient and a retrograde step. As for the silver dollar, before China minted its own silver dollars (yuan), silver dollars predominantly came from overseas and were called foreign (waiyang) dollars. Silver as a metage currency required not only inspection of its purity and quality, but also a multitude of exchange methods in different places, making it inconvenient to use. It was not until the Republican era that the silver dollar officially replaced the silver tael, and silver was able to circulate as China’s standard currency. Furthermore, although China’s monetary history has included a number of financial organs such as pawnshops, silver shops, and local private banks, it took a long time for China to develop a modern banking system. This was a major impediment to the expansion of China’s credit system, and even to its transformation into a modern state. A detailed study of China’s monetary history shows that its shifting forms and systemic development are inseparable from specific historical changes, and that changes in currency correspond to the advance and retreat of dynasties. Silver is a continuous but concealed thread in history’s dense fabric. Gaining a fresh understanding of China’s monetary history and grasping the critical progress of silver in China’s monetization require integrated study of economic history, political history, financial history, military history, and other disciplines, and a reexamination of Chinese history from a broader perspective. In other words, understanding currency additionally requires new clarity regarding the main arteries and veins of Chinese history. For traditional Central Plains dynasties, defending imperial rule meant responding to challenges from within and outside of the country. External challenges are typically overlooked in traditional narratives, but in fact, ethnic minorities were not a transient presence in Chinese history. Over the centuries, nomadic peoples from the northern steppes were likely to cast covetous gazes southward at any juncture, and up to a million soldiers maintained combat readiness on either side of the Great Wall. Peace, whether won or temporary, put heavy demands on\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nthe military capacity and access to resources of the Central Plains dynasties. Even more crucially, the military forces that required such enormous material support tended to be more loyal to the generals who led them than to the remote imperial court, and emperors often had difficulty deciding between the loyalty and the combat readiness of their armies. This constituted a thorny domestic challenge. Power is addictive, but how is it to be preserved? The empire’s internal power struggles implied an impetus for systemic change. The Western Zhou dynasty (1045–771 b.c.e.) put faith in the power of bloodlines and clans and ruled the country under feudalism, but ended up united with the Qin and Han through annex warfare. From the Qin and Han through the Tang dynasties, imperial courts experimented with various ways of using military power to maintain control over the intransigent resistance of the local nobility and latent forces of rebellion among separatist warlords, their lamentable failure reaching a climax in the rebellion of An Lushan and Shi Siming.9 Correspondingly, the military system oscillated between a conscription system (such as the local militia [fubing] system) and a mercenary system. The conscription method was simple and amazingly effective but hard to sustain without relying on the innate valor of the grasslands peoples, while the mercenary system entailed enormous expenditure and posed challenges in terms of maintaining the loyalty of the troops. Under attack from without and within, the ability of dynasties to draw on resources was constantly tested. When a dynasty first came to power, the large amounts of unclaimed territory allowed smooth implementation of various kinds of land equalization systems, as well as various finance and taxation methods, mainly tax paid in kind. With the passage of time, however, the annexation of land and special privileges enjoyed by influential clans made it difficult for the imperial court to maintain its financial resources, necessitating various kinds of monetizing tax revenue reform plans. Reforms by Yang Yan, Wang Anshi, Zhang Juzheng, and Emperor Yongzheng emerged over the course of nearly 1,000 years. Their essence was the desire to sustain the imperial government through tax revenues. Entering modern times, the erosive power of the global influx and outflow of silver had a profound effect on China’s economy, and even its\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\ndomestic affairs, from the fall of the Ming dynasty to the Opium Wars, as well as the numerous political battles, unrest, and economic crises that followed. Ironically, after the beleaguered Republic of China bade farewell to silver and entered the era of paper currency, it immediately fell into hyperinflation, replicating the paper currency episodes of the Southern Song centuries before and nearly wiping out a millennium of progress in Chinese currency in one fell stroke. In the process of silverization, the Celestial Empire also experienced fading imperial glory, not only losing its leading ranking in GDP to the West, but even lagging behind its Asian neighbor, Japan. Back when silver was monetized in the late Ming and early Qing, many enlightened thinkers forcefully condemned silver’s baneful influence. Huang Zongxi said, “Today silver alone is permitted to be used in paying taxes and in market transactions, and it has become the greatest evil in the land.”10 Wang Fuzhi likewise stated, “Hunger with nothing to eat, cold with nothing to wear, leading the nation to death, that is silver!” Blaming silver for regime change and the empire’s sagging stature was not limited to the Ming; in the late Qing, Kang Youwei11 also held, “Is it not ludicrous that an ancient nation with 5,000 years of civilization and 400 million people could perish merely because of silver declining and gold rising?” This interpretation remains part of the great debate over how China fell into backwardness. Do silver and backwardness have an accidental and coincidental or a causal relationship? Was silver a root cause of China’s backwardness? Sorting through the centuries-long history of silver, we see that the fate of silver accompanies an ancient empire’s struggles and entanglements, and that behind silver’s metamorphosis is not only dynastic change but the rise and fall of civilizations. Fastening our gaze on silver gives us a glimpse of China’s path to modernization. This book is divided into three parts. In the remainder of this Introduction, I will lay out the book’s arguments and its observational framework. The five chapters that make up the main body of the book will focus on historical fact. Chapter 1 summarizes the divergent fate of silver in Asia and the West, Chapter 2 details the paper currency experiments of the Song and Yuan dynasties, Chapter 3 analyzes the Ming dynasty’s silver standard and its interaction with globalization, Chapter 4\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nexplores how the nominal silver standard devolved into chaos and collapse in the late Qing, and the final chapter is a monetary history of the Republic of China, beginning with silver and ending with its fiat currency (fabi). The final part of the book consists of an Afterword, a Chronology of monetary and financial events in the East and West, and other such material. Before extensively using silver, Chinese largely used paper currency, an innovation that transcended the times. Ancient Greek philosophy had a theory of “gold, silver, bronze, and iron”: All human beings were born of earth and were meant to be brothers and sisters, but the gods mixed certain metals into their souls to create three types. The first type of human had gold mixed in, and therefore was the most precious and capable of ruling; the second had silver mixed in and comprised the auxiliaries or soldiers; and the last was bronze or iron, for farmers and other craftsmen.12 Myths are metaphors for reality. Corresponding to the gold, silver, and bronze ages in Western mythology, ancient China also had a formulation of gold, silver, and bronze (as well as using cloth, knives, tortoise shell, and cowries). The monetary history of the East and the West developed in different stages. In the West the stages can be roughly divided into the commodity standard, gold–silver bimetallism to the gold standard, and then the paper currency standard (perhaps we should add a new stage, the digital age that we are now welcoming in). The evolving forms of currency were meant to adapt to the economy’s constant monetization. At the dawn of civilization, currency probably originated as gifts, then entered the commodity era, during which items from seashells to pepper served as currency, with gold and silver occupying an important position among them. East and West both experienced eras in which gold and silver were used along with various kinds of metal coins. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Europe gradually transitioned from gold–silver bimetallism to the gold standard, and with the development of the modern banking system and the flourishing of the bond market, the West ultimately transitioned to a paper currency standard in the twentieth century. Paper currency can be considered the highest stage in humanity’s development of currency and is not on the same plane as metal currency.\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\nSuccessful paper currency, especially legal tender, relies on a credit agreement between the market and the state. In contrast, China’s large-scale experiments with paper currency back in the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, and the failures at that stage, constitute a crucial link in silver’s ultimate triumph in China. Before the Five Dynasties, silver was used in China mainly in the decorative arts and was seldom seen once gold became used as a medium of payment after the Han dynasty; the Tang dynasty monetary system used a combination of bronze coins and silk. By the Song dynasty, the use of silver migrated from upper-class society to the general populace and gradually took on the status of a medium of payment. References to silver became much more numerous in various literary sketches and commodity price records. Even more noteworthy is that China produced the world’s first paper currency at that time. While gold–silver bimetallism was still in use during the Middle Ages in the West, China’s experiment with paper currency began on a significant scale in the Northern Song.13 The Northern Song’s jiaozi (exchange note) was issued as far back as the early eleventh century, during the first year of the Northern Song’s Tiansheng era (1023), and circulated for nearly eighty years, emerging 600 or 700 years earlier than the first paper currency in Western countries. In retrospect, the Song dynasty can be considered truly distinctive. The emergence of paper currency in the Northern Song reflected the flourishing Song economy, arguably the historical zenith of the Chinese economy, during which it surpassed that of the West. On the other hand, the expense and financial pressure of that empire’s expeditionary wars created the historical conditions for widespread use of paper currency. The first Song emperor, Zhao Kuangyin (917–975), rose to power amid the chaos of war in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (902– 979) and established a civilian-controlled mercenary army of as many as 1.2 million soldiers at the outset of the dynasty. Frontier disturbances were constant during the Song, and the Liao and Jin kingdoms and Mongolia all had powerful armies that the Song confronted for hundreds of years. In order to sustain its enormous military expenses, the Song broke with common practice and vigorously developed a commodity economy, not only making it the leading economic power among\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nChina’s premodern dynasties, but also causing rapid advancement in the economy’s monetization; currency in various forms made up 80 percent of its fiscal revenue (compared with no more than 20 percent during the most flourishing period of the Tang dynasty). Weighed down by its immense military outlay, however, the Song remained under tremendous financial pressure, and this also created the historical opportunity for paper currency. Unfortunately, because the paper currency first and foremost served the needs of the imperial court’s wartime finance, as the military situation became critical, the currency collapsed under excessive issue. At that time, it wasn’t only the Song dynasty’s jiaozi, huizi (account note), and other financial innovations that anticipated the world trend. The paper currency of the Song’s longtime nemesis, the Jin dynasty, also achieved considerable success until Mongolia’s armored cavalry emerged from the desert and swept across the land. Yet the story of paper currency doesn’t end here. The subsequent Yuan and Ming dynasties followed in the Song’s footsteps and magnified its abuses by issuing all kinds of paper money. This paper money gradually moved toward nonconvertibility, and some had the quality of fiat currency. As in the Song dynasty, excess issuance of this currency inevitably produced bad results. With the rise of paper currency, silver initially had no legitimate status; at one point the Yuan dynasty restricted the use of silver, and the early Ming dynasty banned it. The ban failed to stem its use in private transactions, and as silver gradually became monetized, the Ming had no alternative but to lift the silver ban in its middle and late periods. In the first year of the Longqing era (1567) it stipulated, “For the purchase of goods valued at one silver coin or above, either silver or bronze coins can be used; for under one silver coin, only bronze coins can be used.” Silver attained legal authorization as a currency, and during the Jiajing era, the government formally stipulated the exchange ratio between silver and bronze coins. The status of silver reached its height from then on and held it until the early 1930s. When paper currency suffered defeat, silver was able to shine as a currency during the Ming dynasty. With the passage of time, the harshness of the early Ming Hongwu regime finally succumbed to the vitality\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\nof economic development, just as major geographical discoveries brought massive quantities of New World silver flowing into China and turned the Ming dynasty economy from stagnant ripples into a mighty torrent. The classical Chinese novel The Golden Lotus vividly describes the flourishing late Ming commodity economy, for which the inflow of foreign silver and its monetization were the most critical driving force. The failed experiment with paper currency over three dynasties wrought silver’s ultimate victory in China. For premodern empires, metal currency was hard to control, while bank notes were the most convenient form of currency; furthermore, the inadequate supply of precious metals in ancient times made economic problems a common occurrence. If paper currency had been issued in appropriate amounts, this would have benefited the government’s finances and brought enormous dividends in boosting the economy. In other words, paper currency in itself can be considered an “upgrade” from metal currency to fiduciary currency, and if utilized properly can greatly benefit an economy, the typical case being the British pound sterling’s decisive role in England’s rise. Under the dominance of China’s war logic and imperial mindset, however, the innovation of paper currency didn’t bring prosperity but rather excessive issue. During the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, China attempted to skip the silver standard and proceed straight to the paper currency standard, but lack of restraint defeated the premature advent of paper currency. In competing with paper currency in the private sector, silver was better for preserving value against inflation and for hoarding, and most crucially, silver was a currency immune from being rashly plundered by those in power, since the imperial court had no way of “printing” silver. For this reason, silver became the market’s natural choice. Under the latent but formidable power of market selection, the paper currency experiment, from the tragedy of the huizi in the Song dynasty to the failure of the baochao (treasure note) in the Great Ming, inevitably ended in failure. China’s paper currency was another cultural flower of ancient empire fated to bloom prematurely, all of the intelligence and shrewdness behind it self-destructing under lack of restraint and boundaries. Looking back at the 1,000-year story of silver, its competition had an enormous effect on paper currency, beginning with the jiaozi, which can be consid-\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nered the prelude to the monetization of silver, and ending with the fabi, which marked the end result of silver’s monetization. How could a country with little silver production maintain a silver standard for 500 years? The answer lay in foreign silver. China was a silver-deficient country. A glimpse of the amount of silver it produced can be gained from records of silver revenues (that is, silver tax) in the Ming Shilu (official history of the Ming dynasty). In terms of average annual silver revenues, the period from the twentythird to the twenty-sixth year of the Hongwu period produced the least, an average of 25,070 taels per year, or a total of 75,070 taels for all three years. After that it leaped to more than 200,000 taels, but then dropped again. In terms of total revenue, in the 130 years from the twenty-third year of the Hongwu period to the fifteenth year of the Zhengde period, the total was more than 1.13 million taels.14 This means that silver tax revenues during the Ming dynasty averaged 100,000 taels per year. The silver tax rates on silver production in the Ming dynasty were higher than in the Song and Yuan dynasties, and also higher than in Spain at that time (it is generally believed that Spain’s gold tax was 1/20, and its silver tax was 1/10). The Ming dynasty silver tax is generally believed to have been around 30 percent of the silver production quota.15 Calculated in this way, Ming dynasty silver production was not very high, averaging a little more than 300,000 taels per year (see Table 0-1). This meager silver production was naturally unequal to the historic task of the Ming dynasty’s economic monetization. In fact, this burden was mainly borne by the large-scale influx of foreign silver. Foreign silver mainly came from two sources. Traditionally it was Japanese silver; silver frequently appears among articles of tribute to the imperial court during the Tang dynasty, and it was also common for various kinds of coins to be among the items taken back to Japan. Even more significant was silver from the American continents, which entered China through various trade channels. The process of China’s transition to a silver economy was inextricably tied to the first globalization initiated by major geographical discoveries. The sixteenth century was a watershed. After Christopher Columbus drew European attention to the New World in 1492, an American\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\nTable 0-1.

This silver mountain, called Cerro Rico (Hill of Riches) by the delighted Spaniards, became a symbolic event in the exploration of the Americas. With the discovery of the mercury needed to refine silver in Peru in 1563, New World silver mining burgeoned. Financial historian Charles Kindleberger calculated that at its peak, production of silver in all of the Americas reached 300 tons a year.16 New World silver mines satisfied the European mania for precious metals. Europeans had initially gone to the New World in search of gold; in Engels’s words, “Gold was the magic word that drove the Spanish across the Atlantic Ocean to America; gold was the first thing the white man asked about when he set foot on newly discovered soil.”17 With the discovery of the Potosi silver mine in Peru, silver became an object of even greater interest than gold in the West from 1560 onward. In Asia, this coincided with the Ming dynasty’s desperate thirst for silver, as a result of which American silver poured into China and took on a new role in the histories of Asia and the West.\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nArbitrage between the gold–silver exchange ratios in China and Europe was a major impetus in the great transcontinental flow of silver. China’s gold–silver exchange ratio was always higher than Europe’s; in the early years it was 1:3 or even lower, and in the early Ming it was around 1:6 to 1:5, and then 1:8 to 1:7; right up until the Qing dynasty it was still higher than in Europe. In the Middle Ages in Europe the ratio was generally 1:14 to 1:10 or even higher (according to the figures of American economic historian Earl Hamilton in 1934, from 1643 to 1650 the gold–silver exchange ratio was 1:15.45).18 American gold and silver mines were a major driver of change in worldwide precious metal prices. The sixteenth-century discoveries caused European gold and silver prices to plunge to nearly one-third of their original levels, and the relative value of silver to gold dropped even further.19 Adam Smith, living in the eighteenth century, observed that prior to the discovery of American gold and silver mines, European mints stipulated an exchange ratio between pure gold and pure silver of 1:12 to 1:10, but then in the seventeenth century it became 1:15 to 1:14. The reason was that although gold and silver mines were discovered in the Americas at almost the same time, the silver mines were even richer than the gold mines. In comparison, the ratio in China was 1:10 or 1:12, and in Japan it was 1:8. The large-scale production of silver in the Americas led to an even greater discrepancy between the gold–silver exchange ratios in Asia and the West, while also inevitably creating immense room for international arbitrage in precious metals. The major geographical discoveries ignited a surge of globalization. The Philippine archipelago became a transfer station for American silver to enter Asia, and what linked everything together was trade. In the words of Chinese economic historian Yan Zhongping, “Silk flowed into the Philippines and silver flowed into China.”20 Apart from silk, other Chinese textiles were also very popular; Chinese cotton had already elbowed out Spanish cotton in the Mexican market by the end of the sixteenth century. Scholar Quan Hansheng calculates that between 1565 and 1765, silver with a total value of 200 million pesos was shipped from the Americas to the Philippines. (The peso was a monetary unit widely used in the former Spanish colonies, generally believed to have converted into Chinese treasury [kuping] silver at a rate of 0.72 treasury\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\nounces [taels].) According to scholar De Comyn’s calculation,21 between 1571 and 1821, silver with a total value of 400,000 pesos was shipped from the Americas to Manila, of which one-fourth to one-half flowed into China. Quan Hansheng, however, holds that the exchange ratio was higher than 1:2, and, adding in the 400 million dollars brought to Guangzhou by trade with European countries, he estimates that about 600 million dollars’ worth of American silver was imported to China between 1700 and 1830, converting to approximately 430 million taels.22 The German-born economist Andre Gunder Frank’s research on silver has attracted considerable notice in the public sphere. His theoretical system couples Asia’s status at that time with its ability to absorb silver. His estimates of silver inflow, higher than those of Quan Hansheng and other experts, are quite controversial. He holds that from 1493 to 1800, 85 percent of the world’s silver and 70 percent of its gold came from the Americas.23 More than 80 percent of the silver was shipped to Europe, and Europe shipped 40 percent of that amount to Asia; 20 percent of the silver remaining in the Americas was also shipped to Asia.24 The conclusion is that worldwide silver production totaled 120,000 tons starting in 1600 (or 137,000 tons starting in 1545), and half of that production went to Asia. During this time a total of 60,000 tons was imported to China, or approximately 1.920 billion taels.25 This figure is quite possibly too high, but it indicates the enormous intake of silver in the Ming dynasty. Even if the amount of silver stock from China’s previous dynasties is added in, the amount of imported foreign silver is still much greater than the domestic stock during the same period. Scholar Liu Guanglin believes that the Song dynasty’s silver stock did not exceed 150 million taels, and under the influence of the Yuan dynasty’s ban on the circulation of silver, as well as loss to Central Asian countries, hoarding, burial with the dead, and other factors, the amount of silver left behind from previous dynasties during the Ming dynasty was no more than 30 million taels. Adding in the Ming dynasty’s silver production of 20 million taels, the total amount of silver stock in the early sixteenth-century Ming dynasty was 50–60 million taels, while from the mid-sixteenth century onward, the amount of imported foreign silver was around 200 million taels. There are fairly large discrepancies among these various calculations. The\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nAmerican scholar Richard von Glahn estimates 192–197 million taels; Chinese scholar Wu Chengming estimates 86–111 million taels; while Kamiki Tetsuo, Yamamura Kozo, and others estimate 232–289 million taels, around four times the amount of local silver stores.26 In spite of inconsistencies among the figures calculated by various scholars, the indisputable consensus is that China became the world’s “hoarder” of silver from the Ming and Qing dynasties onward. Here I should emphasize that there has been a great deal of research on silver in the Ming and Qing dynasties, and the objective of many scholars is to provide benchmarks that can be passed down as a frame of reference in this sphere. My ambitions are focused elsewhere, however; I simply hope to provide different perspectives for readers’ reference, but also, through the sorting and analysis of fragmentary historical facts, to present a more coherent logic of money. Apart from similarities and differences in silver data, we should look at larger patterns, that is, the logical derivatives and historical contexts beyond the figures. Economic calculations from antiquity are not easy; even the GDP calculations of a heavyweight economist such as Angus Maddison, although considered the most authoritative, are still very controversial. Chinese silver in particular involves not only various units of measurement but also scattered and singular source material. For this reason, readers should be skeptical of the various data on silver imports and exports and focus more on changing trends. As Harvard historian and economist David S. Landes has said, in speculative calculations, “the numbers deserve credence only if they accord with their historical context,” and “the leverage of even a small mistake extended over two hundred years is enormous.”27 I’ve always maintained that economics should ideally be a combination of data, logic, and history, and that economic historical research should, under the premise of understanding the context of the data, always allow for doubt. The inflow of silver not only nullified the energetic efforts of dynasties from the Yuan onward to ban silver, but also caused the Chinese economy to more rapidly monetize and inadvertently join in the mix of globalization. The difference is that Europe’s Age of Discovery increased the impetus for Europe to embark on its Industrial Revolution, and from then on its main economic entities adopted the gold standard and even\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\nbegan using paper currency. The Asian empires, however, quietly held fast to silver and became entangled in outflows or inadequate inflows of silver. After the Ming dynasty, as China entered the Qing dynasty, the inflow of silver continued as before. The Qing dynasty monetary system basically continued the Ming’s system of “using silver for large sums and copper cash for small sums.” Lessons from the paper currency of the previous dynasty led the Qing to avoid similar experiments. Silver linked China’s economy to the world even more during the Ming and Qing dynasties. As foreign silver became ingrained in the Chinese economy, the Chinese government was no longer able to control its flow rate, and this had a significant impact right into the Republican era. In the 1930s, someone asserted, “The price of silver was the core issue of China’s modern financial economy.”28 In the most classic example, before the Opium Wars broke out, the “silver leakage” caused by opium became the main topic of memorials submitted to the Daoguang Emperor by his top ministers. In this book I’ve especially featured the research of Taiwanese scholar Lin Man-houng, which shows that the outflow of silver did not reach its peak during the Opium Wars, as most people think. From the altitude of history we can see that the essential focal point of the Opium Wars was not a silver war, but a trade war against the backdrop of unavoidable conflict and collision between two civilizations. Apart from politics, the Chinese economy was also disrupted by foreign silver. When silver inflow increased, the monetization of China’s economy gained traction, as evidenced in the novel The Golden Lotus, in which everyone is engaged in commerce, as well as in the rich landscape of southern China in the Qing dynasty. Exports increased, people lived and worked in peace and contentment, silver was increasingly traded in the marketplace, and the economy flourished. When the inflow of silver decreased, China suffered severe deflation, exports decreased, people became conservative, silver began to be withdrawn from circulation, silver hoarding increased, the fiscal administration became increasingly atrophied, and ultimately even war and rebellion resulted. This transpired in both the late Ming and the late Qing. During flourishing times, silver was the icing on the cake, but in times of decline, silver became the last straw.\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nAs currency and financial expert Frederic S. Mishkin has said, the financial system is the brain of the economy.29 The endless flow of silver was the white blood of China’s economy, and changes to its dynamics affected the nerve center of the Chinese economy, creating overstimulation, convulsions, and even disorders. Even when in possession of substantial amounts of silver, empires still declined. In other words, silver was very important, but possessing silver was not the same as prosperity, and in fact the inflow of silver could be seen as the result rather than the cause of the monetization of China’s economy. The inflow and outflow of silver drove periodic convulsions in the Chinese economy, but the core factor that determined the success or failure of an empire was, as always, the intrinsic flaws of the imperial system. Did the inflow of silver decide the fate of empires, or did the direction of the empire influence the flow of silver? Actual history is the result of countless individual interactions, including that between the fate of silver and the rise and fall of empires. The Opium Wars hastened China’s modernization, but the latearriving modern financial intermediaries had difficulty advancing amid competition with overseas rivals. Although silver emerged triumphant in the market’s spontaneous choice, China’s monetary system was in fact always in a passive state; for many years, the empire’s most critical fiscal and taxation power fell to customs, and an effective monetary system was not established even in the Republican era. When overseas study in Japan was a popular trend in the early twentieth century, a twenty-six-year-old Chinese student completed his studies in economics in Kyoto and went to say goodbye to his teachers before leaving. One of the Japanese teachers told him: “The name China can only be considered a geographical name, not a country. The Beijing government’s decrees do not apply beyond the capital, and the provinces and regions are fighting among each other, each doing things their own way and each issuing bank notes and minting bronze coins. Which region are you planning to go to now? I think that if you go back, you may have no way out.” Standing at the same point in time, the two people’s experience and perspectives were different, so their views toward China were naturally\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\ndifferent. This student was offended by his teacher’s remark, and he later recalled losing his temper. He returned to China without hesitation and subsequently became a leading authority in the Chinese banking world. This man was Zi Yaohua, who personally witnessed silver’s gradual withdrawal from the Republic’s currency system. His Japanese teacher can also not be written off; he was the prominent sinologist Naitō Torojiro (a.k.a. Naitō Konan), the first person to propose the “theory of TangSong transition.”30 Naitō Konan’s observations at that time were in fact quite accurate; the monetary chaos explained the torpor of China’s political economy, a situation that could be traced back to the Ming and Qing eras, or even earlier. After the Ming and Qing dynasties, China had a nominal silver standard, but it was highly problematic. Silver had never been coined, and in practice, uncoined silver, silver fragments, and silver dollars were used simultaneously. Added to that, given differences in weight and purity standards, conversion rates included not only “physical silver taels” of varying weights and purity, but also “virtual silver taels” that differed in value according to region and use—more than 100 types in all. The varied measurement units for silver created unprecedented chaos in China’s monetary system, and the chaotic monetary system in turn resulted in an atrophied and backward economy and financial system. Coupled with a frail and divided nation, the use of silver became a symbol of backwardness and was even considered a kind of “white curse.” Even now, many observers still emphasize that China’s use of silver and loss of sovereignty over its currency are what led to its lagging behind in the Great Divergence between East and West during the Ming and Qing dynasties. If we accept, according to this viewpoint, that the fall of the Great Ming Empire was caused in part by the rebellion of Li Zicheng, and that this was related to the reduced inflow of foreign silver, and also that changes in the inflow of silver triggered economic crises and even war in the late Qing and Republican eras, rather than pursuing the question of whether or not silver should have been used, we should focus on why China used silver. Why did the system behind silver never change? Why did the European continent, which also used silver for a long time, not replicate China’s disastrous policies, but instead gradually nurture a modern paper currency and banking system?\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nSilver continued to circulate in China as late as the Republican era. The Beiyang government was weak and grossly incompetent apart from Yuan Shikai’s small contribution to unifying the currency system, and even then there were many instances of excessive issue of currency, as during the “Beijing bank note panic.” During the Beiyang era, central authority declined, but the power of the private sector burgeoned. China’s new-style banks began to rise, and a modern financial system materialized out of nowhere. After the Republic of China’s government was established, centralized power increased, and China was finally able to eliminate the tael and convert to the dollar. The Kuomintang (Nationalist) government originally planned a transition from the silver standard to the gold standard, but because of the worldwide economic crisis and the United States’ Silver Purchase Act, China once again “upgraded” by skipping over the gold standard and going directly into the legal tender (fabi) stage. Legal tender notes were meant to be an upgrade to China’s currency system and an achievement in unifying the currency, but under conditions of domestic turmoil and foreign invasion, finance was once again reduced to an appendage of politics, with undesirable results. The excessive issuance of fabi could not be contained, and the excessive issue of the jinyuanquan (gold dollar certificates) that replaced the legal tender notes was absolutely unprecedented. Consequently, paper currency was responsible for the worst case of runaway inflation in modern Chinese history, the severity of which exceeded all expectations. As in the past, this experiment with paper currency led to the fall of a government. And after paper currency was abandoned, silver was quietly resurrected in private circulation. The chess game between silver and paper currency was in fact a trial of strength between conservatism and greed. This chess game can have different results if played with checks and balances on power, and in this sense, paper currency was a systemic bonus that eluded China’s grasp. The British pound sterling was issued only after the Bank of England was established in 1694, a good 600 to 700 years after China’s jiaozi. The pound was originally a bank note of the Bank of England, which was only a private bank when it was first established. Even so, after the pound came into being, it maintained a stable value for more than 200 years. The British pound’s strength established a powerful foundation for England\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\nto vault from being a country on the frontier of Europe to an empire on which the sun never set. In my book The Money Printers, I explore the success of the British pound, and at the same time ponder China’s failure with the fabi and jinyuanjuan. Comparing the currency systems of the two countries can be seen as a comparison of positive and negative feedback. China’s paper currency cycle was often the prelude to the dynastic cycle. Increasing military spending resulted in financial deficit, and financial deficit led to the immoderate printing of currency. Under hyperinflation, good money continued to exist, while bad money collapsed, and the Republic even reverted to metal money and a barter economy. During the legal-tender reforms of the 1930s, the government ordered silver withdrawn from circulation, but with the failure of the fabi and routing of the jinyuanjuan, silver in fact never really left the Republic’s economic life. In theory, the central bank should be the crucial and ultimate defense against inflation. In ancient times there was no independent central bank or restraints on the government, so experiments with paper currency were doomed to fail. Although a central bank emerged in the Republican era, it did not in fact meet the qualifications of a central bank in the modern sense, but was only a countinghouse cashier controlled by the government. Not surprisingly, the Chinese economic historian Du Xuncheng refers to it as “a freak of nature.” The great flaw of Chinese politics is in the malpractice of personal rule in which China has been tangled for millennia. The JapaneseAmerican political scientist Francis Fukuyama in recent years constructed a theory that orderly societies require a combination of three factors: the state, the rule of law, and accountable government, in a stable balance.31 This apparently simple “political sandwich” is not easy to attain, however, and the Republican government, facing division within and the circling of antagonistic powers without, was ultimately unable to extricate itself from printing currency. To sum up Fukuyama’s theory, China has always had to face the problem of bad emperors. This implies that China’s top-down power structure is in fact very hard to effectively restrain, in the financial sphere as well. The financial system typically developed because of the financial needs of the state, which determined the short stave of the financial\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nsystem. This was even more the case with currency; experiments with paper currency were a chess game between the government and the market. Finance is essentially trust, and precisely because of that, metal currency has incomparable advantages for the general populace in an autocratic era, while experiments with paper currency can only succeed in political systems that can constrain government greed. This method continues to arise in modern times but remains imperfect. In the 1,000-year struggle between silver and paper currency, from the time that paper currency was invented in the eleventh century until the end of the jinyuanjuan reforms that took over from physical gold and silver in the twentieth century, silver’s victory was the government’s defeat, and silver’s defeat was also the government’s defeat—it was human greed, and even more a major systemic failure. Finance and taxation occupy an intermediate zone between currency and imperial power. From ancient times to the present, taxation has been a crucial force in historical change. The strong have the power to collect taxes from the weak, and the weak use their payment of taxes as a counter in their chess game with the powerful. In other words, tax revenue is the main gaming platform for political power and economic power, and attitudes toward and engagement with taxation constitute the principal content of relations between the state and the market; finance is the offspring of this interaction. In tandem with China’s economic development and monetization, China’s tax system evolved from payment in kind to payment in currency. The use of silver to pay the equivalent value of grain tax emerged in the Tang dynasty and became mainstream practice from the mid-Ming onward, at around the same time that paper currency was receding from use. In the Song, Jin, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, it was financial predicaments that led empires to repeatedly resort to the excessive issuance of paper currency. Finance and taxation form the basis of an empire’s operations, and the income of Chinese empires always relied primarily on agriculture. Under these circumstances, the attitude toward commerce was basically one of constraint, as the government was unable to depart from traditional patterns of fiscal administration. Per capita income also sank into a low-level equilibrium, and, adding in the inefficiency of the\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\ntaxation system, this further consolidated the empire’s organizational ossification. By way of contrast, European royal courts traditionally drew their revenue from land leases, judicial fees and fines, and so on, and as the countries of Western Europe increasingly moved toward mercantilism during the Age of Discovery, customs duty and other taxes and levies became increasingly important, constituting more than half of the royal family’s income in England. While relying on merchants to obtain financial revenue, regents transferred their governing power, and ultimately constitutional government and fiscal administration brought about systemic leaps. The crux of the straitened circumstances of Chinese imperial taxation was the limited ability to collect taxes. After the Tang dynasty, the prime minister’s power shrank, and the office of prime minister didn’t even exist after the Ming dynasty. The tradition of the emperor needing to consult with the prime minister no longer existed, which meant that monarchical power was concentrated to an unprecedented degree, accompanied by a decline in managerial efficiency. Centralized imperial authority meant that the emperor had to decide on all matters, great and small, and while the public finance system looked solid, it was actually very inefficient.32 The public finance sphere lacked a professional organizational agent; the minister of works was ostensibly in charge of fiscal administration but in reality functioned only as an accountant, and it was hard for him to do anything without the emperor’s support. Under most circumstances, therefore, from the Yuan, Ming, and Qing, and even into the Republican era, the government’s financial resources were only at sustenance levels, and deficit spending occurred with every natural disaster or war. Government decline routinely led to the excessive issue of currency, which would ultimately collapse, while silver continued to circulate among the general populace, and the more the government issued currency, the more the currency declined, until it finally died out; this can be considered the Chinese-style currency printing cycle. Taking the watershed era of the Ming and Qing Empires as an example, the two empires can generally be seen as a single unit in terms of the nature of their systems. During the Ming and Qing, China was severely tested by nomadic peoples; the empire began moving toward introversion, and the power structure became even more despotic, revolving\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\naround the emperor. With the elimination of the position of prime minister, the relationship between sovereign and subjects became even more hierarchical, and the civil official clique united in resistance against the rise of imperial authority. The Qing Empire, although ruled by an external ethnic group, relied on the Ming dynasty’s system sustained by generations of capable emperors, with the result that the Qing Empire resembled a fortified version of the Ming. Yet, as Chinese-American historian Ray Huang has said, compared with the volatile character of the Second Empire, composed of the Sui, Tang, and Song, the Third Empire, composed of the Ming and Qing, was immobile.33 The empire’s systemic involution led to organizational ossification that prevented it from changing along with world trends. When the West embarked on the Industrial Revolution, the Ming and Qing Empires contented themselves with the continued inflow of American silver and did not make any substantial amendments to the imperial system. Ming and Qing taxation was not as harsh as might be imagined, maintaining a rate of around 10 percent. The Chinese government is thought of as a traditional “night watchman” government; apart from the traditional thinking of not seeking gain at the people’s expense, an even more important reason is the fettering of the empire’s capacities. China’s traditional government can be considered “small government,” epitomized by the late Qing, when the population swelled, but this kind of “small government” actually originates from weak fiscal administration. On the one hand, financial and taxation capacity is limited, and on the other hand, the government is also limited in the amount of public services it can shoulder. Limited public services coupled with the monopolization of power make improvement of the finance and taxation system even more difficult. The resulting excessively cumbersome system has the sole objective of sustaining dictatorship. Feeble fiscal administration made the government redundant and inefficient, its administrative proficiency lower than that of its foreign counterparts. Consequently, in an era of competition between nations, China naturally came in last. It is worth mentioning that the Ming and Qing taxation system was unique in that its formal tax revenue was set to maintain the total budget of the fiscal administration at the outset of each reign. This led to\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\nfiscal arrangements that typically combined formal taxes with hidden fees. On the one hand, the imperial government’s tax-levying capacity was low, and the abundance of silver resulted in a decrease in silver’s purchasing power, which in turn caused steady shrinkage of the purchasing power of nominal tax revenue; on the other hand, China’s centralized system was never able to overcome the problem of much of the population being beyond the reach of the government. Since local fiscal administration was weak, when the government’s formal revenue quotas could not satisfy demand, all kinds of levies would emerge. The strength or weakness of fiscal administration affected the imperial political system, and invisible taxation became a shadow of nominal finance. As the sundry levies added to nominal taxes continued to grow, the empire’s corruption steadily worsened, creating a new cycle. To confront this model, the central government attempted to use a “Single Whip tax system”—supplementary salaries and other methods to channel various covert finances into the formal fiscal system—but new taxation items cropped up again and again, and the empire was never able to escape the “Huang Zongxi rule.”34 It is because of this that the Japanese scholar Iwai Shigeki describes the Ming and Qing fiscal mechanism as “original-amount fiscalism,” that is, repeatedly enlarging the scope of assessed finance but without eradicating or even reducing covert finance, ultimately forcing the empire into financial crisis and eventual decline.35 The root causes of the cycle of disorderly fiscal administration leading to political chaos were, first, the lack of effective bottom-up supervision, and second, the failure to get to the bottom of corruption—or, using the language of economics, incentive incompatibility. This shows that the emperor or the empirical system proxy was ostensibly battling corrupt officials, but in fact it was a quixotic struggle, that is, resistance against powerful systemic inertia. Comparatively speaking, various European countries had different routes to success or failure in modern finance and taxation. Modern England got a relatively late start and was unable to obtain American silver, but by selling off its rights and interests, Great Britain gained the support of merchants, which led to England’s taxation rates being higher than the Ming dynasty’s over the long term, and also higher than those of continental European countries at that time. One previous viewpoint\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nheld that the West developed by plundering other countries, but in fact colonial empires also had different pedigrees: Spain’s immense colonies gave it access to gold and silver, but while Great Britain, France, and Holland obtained very few precious metal resources from their colonies, their subsequent development was better than Spain’s. These countries initially also hoped to discover gold and silver in their colonies, and explorers promised to pay one-fifth of any gold and silver to the monarch in exchange for permission for their voyages. Adam Smith early on noticed that the North American colonies were developing better than other places, and he also observed, “The colony of a civilised nation which takes possession either of a waste country, or of one so thinly inhabited that the natives easily give place to the new settlers, advances more rapidly to wealth and greatness than any other human society.” The colonizers bring with them “the habit of subordination, some notion of the regular government which takes place in their own country, of the system of laws which support it, and of a regular administration of justice.”36 The conclusion of these historical observations has more recently been verified by granular economic research. Research by economists Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson finds that as the British government began expanding its scope from 1688 onward, its outlay rapidly reached around 10 percent of national revenue. This expansion originated from the support of tax revenue.37 This phase was also the era when England’s power increased, and the reason was the establishment of Parliament, which controlled the king’s power to levy taxes; once Parliament was able to control the government, the king repeatedly delegated power, and this made the British government great and powerful. The British government was able to take on more services, giving England an advantage in competition, and establishing a foundation for its overseas voyages and world domination.38 As for the Spanish government, although it possessed enormous amounts of silver, its inability to establish a state system like England’s doomed it to economic stagnation and government bankruptcy. Finance’s influence on history is enormous, far-reaching, and profound, yet finance alone is not enough, and currency is merely one kind of power; what matters is how other powers, such as imperial power and\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\ngovernment power, are demarcated, managed, and tamed. Historian Niall Ferguson has concluded that England’s success is inseparable from finance, and this success is founded on systemic checks and balances, that is, a “square of power” consisting of a tax-gathering bureaucracy, a central bank, a national debt market, and a parliamentary institution.39 In my book The Money Printers, I borrow the research framework of Ferguson, Douglass North, and others to expound in detail on the relationship of mutual promotion and constraint between England’s rise and the financial system of the Bank of England.40 A superficial observation comparing the Chinese and Western financial systems easily identifies one missing link from China’s financial history: The Chinese government didn’t have the ability to take on debt, so there was no way for a bond market to emerge and for its corresponding system to be constructed. But this viewpoint is not without its limitations; from the late Qing onward, China in fact attempted various forms of domestic and foreign debt. The Qing dynasty’s fiscal administration is generally acknowledged to have had absolutely no problem sustaining a balanced budget before the Xianfeng period (1851–1861), but once the Taiping Rebellion and other wars broke out, financial pressures increased exponentially, and the government was compelled to draw support from its duty on provincial transit. As hostilities increased, foreign powers came swarming in, bringing with them a new financial tool—government bonds. As early as 1867, under the rationale of “urgent military payroll demands,” the westward march of the Chinese army under the late Qing statesman Zuo Zongtang (General Tso) was financed by taking on external debt, using customs duty receipts as collateral. The Hangzhou merchant Hu Xueyan acted as intermediary to borrow 1.2 million taels of silver from foreign merchants in Shanghai, establishing a precedent for Zuo Zongtang himself to take on foreign debt six times. This is considered one of the original instances of the Chinese government taking on foreign debt (another version states that foreign debt originated in the fourth year of the Tongzhi period [1866]). From 1894 onward, foreign debt increasingly became the main blood transfusion machine for the financially hard-pressed Great Qing Empire, and quite a lot of funding for the Westernization Movement41 also came from foreign debt.\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nFrom 1900 onward, the amount of money to be repaid every year also redoubled to upwards of 40 million taels. This burgeoning debt relationship was rooted in dual fiscal and military failure, which reduced China’s financial resources, and even its territory, to collateral without bringing any fundamental change to China’s financial system. In terms of financial institutions, those with the most plentiful and stable profits were mainly distributed among the foreign banks; the foreign bank buildings that rose one after another in Hong Kong and along the Shanghai Bund are crystallizations of this segment of history. The sphere of influence of foreign banks in China was often decided by their sovereign states, the classic case being the British-owned Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC). According to Yang Duanliu’s Historical Sketch of Qing Dynasty Currency and Finance, the Qing government borrowed money nine times from foreign governments from 1895 to 1911; HSBC alone shouldered these loans three times, on two occasions cooperating with the DeutschAsiatische Bank, and the other loans were also carried out with the cooperation of multinational banks. As to China’s domestic commercial institutions, they were basically unable to compete with their foreign counterparts in terms of funding power or entry thresholds, and when domestic banks finally had the opportunity to take part in issuing bonds, they still faced the possibility of the government reneging on its debt without having the power to indirectly control or even directly extort repayment. All of this can be glimpsed in Hu Xueyan’s ultimate bankruptcy and the collapse of the Republic’s government bonds, not to mention how the Bank of China was subsequently forced to increase its government-owned shareholdings. Essentially, national debt is a derivative financial product under capitalist logic (Marx said that public debt is one of the most powerful levers of primitive accumulation).42 As Engels said, in order to maintain public power, the state needs citizens to pay tax: “With advancing civilization, even taxes are not sufficient; the state draws drafts on the future, contracts loans, state debts.”43 Under commercial civilization, the parties involved in both borrowing and lending need to have corresponding restraints. Compared with British historian Niall Ferguson’s “square of\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\npower,” China did not in fact lack the motivation or even the ability to take on debt, but it always lacked a parliament to restrain the emperor— that was the case even after it launched a modern financial market. The kind of mechanism that emerged in Great Britain has its unique, or at least very rare, qualities. This kind of mechanism soon spread throughout the world, and Britain’s political system spread with it. The Chinese Empire had neither a competent tax-collecting system nor a powerful parliament restraining imperial authority; what it had was an unwieldy government and a cowed populace. As a result, many exploratory government bonds were reduced to disguised distribution. This shows that technological change did occur in China, whether in the form of the Northern Song paper currency or the financed government bonds from the late Qing onward; their ultimate failure makes it clear that under the old power rules before the social system completed its transition to modernity, it was difficult to fundamentally change the fate of finance in service to politics, and self-defeat was ultimately also hard to avoid. Any innovation that is beneficial to society intrinsically depends on a benign overall systemic structure, but the financial innovations that occurred in Chinese history, the so-called late Ming sprouts of capitalism, were breakthroughs prioritized only in some regions or departments, and there was no way to smash what French historian Fernand Braudel calls “history’s bell jar.”44 This inertia in government and business remained just as formidable in the Republican era, and continued even today: The abilities of capital and entrepreneurs were limited to a very small area, the benefits of systemic rent-seeking exceeding the benefits of technical innovation, and private capital, ever at a disadvantage vis-à-vis the state, could never be marshaled into a powerful epochal current. Comparing the routes of historical development in China and the West, it is the lack of fetters on centralized power that made wellintentioned systemic designs become counterproductive. In terms of the Chinese and Western fiscal systems, many scholars emphasize that China’s traditional early finance and taxation differentiated between the imperial court’s fiscal administration (internal) and the state’s fiscal administration (external). This was once regarded as China’s advantage, but in practice it was probably not optimal.\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nThe difference between internal fiscal administration in the East and West is no less than the difference between the Chinese and Western feudal systems. China’s pre-Qin era originally also had feudal lords, but after the Qin and Han, feudal lords lost their ruling power, and China gradually moved from a feudalism with nobility, property, and heredity to a feudalism lacking fiefdom and heredity; land was gradually separated from its associated powers, and fiscal power also gradually became concentrated under the management of the central government. This also required clarifying the sources and uses of the fiscal system. In Chinese history, the eras during which internal and external fiscal administration were clearly distinguished were the Qin and Han, especially the Han. During this time the minister of revenue managed the state’s fiscal administration,45 and the main income came from land tax, corvee, and so on; while the minister steward (shaofu) managed the imperial family’s finances, of which the main income came from mining royalties, tribute, and so on. This differentiation gradually blurred after the Han dynasty, and became obscure by the Tang and Song dynasties. But there were also situations when the imperial treasury supplemented the state treasury; the first Song emperor once stated that the imperial treasury was for emergencies and not for personal enjoyment: “It is necessary to prepare for military actions and famines and not react on the spur of the moment. Therefore this treasury is in place.” The second Song emperor, Taizong, installed a state treasury to store the tribute and taxes from the prefectures. He told his ministers that he was concerned that the officials in charge of these assets might not handle them properly, and that they might be wasted, which would put pressure on the people. For this reason, the emperor did not treat the tribute and taxes from the people as personal property to use as he pleased.46 While the Song dynasty imperial treasury had a tradition of replenishing the state treasury, its existence was an implicit allocation to the state coffers, and even increased the centralization of the Song dynasty’s fiscal administration. The Song dynasty’s imperial treasury gradually became dominated by the imperial court, and the three ministers originally empowered with keeping track of the palace treasury gradually lost their power to be informed, while the emperor became more directly involved in allocating and encroaching on property rights. The\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\ndifference between internal and external was even more pro forma by the Ming dynasty; the Board of Revenue had no power to intervene, and quite a few emperors even drew from the state coffers to replenish the imperial household’s storehouse. The relationship between the internal treasury and the Board of Revenue became even more blended during the Qing dynasty, and the expansion of imperial power caused the internal treasury to grow exponentially. Those below imitated those above, creating collective chaos in the bureaucracy and the burgeoning of “surplus fees” and other such covert taxation imposed by various grades of officials in addition to statutory taxes. Therefore, while systems such as the internal treasury and original-amount fiscalism ostensibly benefited the state’s financial management, the lack of systemic restraints ultimately caused them to deviate from the original intentions and even led to contrary results, becoming a link in the major failure of empires. In comparison, kings in the West were feudal lords in the true sense, and fiscal revenues came largely from the monarch’s personal land income or seigniorage income, so that monarchs generally lived by their own means. Taxes were for the most part levied to meet the costs of war, resulting in the emergence of public finance. This is the historical reason for the British Parliament directing fiscal administration.47 Due to the lack of overall systemic change, the Chinese Empire’s fiscal administration, in spite of undergoing quite a few reforms under capable high-level officials, was never able to break through its limitations, and this trapped the empire in a continuous cycle of inefficiency from the Ming and Qing dynasties onward. Even with the arrival of the modern Nationalist regime, Thomas Rawski estimates that its 1931 financial expenditures were lower than under Japan’s Meiji government in 1880.48 A corresponding organized mobilization was also never able to deeply penetrate the Chinese interior, especially the rural regions, and this enormous vacuum allowed the Communist base areas to separate and encircle the cities. Ultimately the cities lost their economic and military superiority; the Nationalist government can be seen as doomed from the start by its fragile fiscal administration system. A genuine market economy implies the expansion of human cooperation and order. The reason that Chinese antiquity was unable to\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nderive extensive cooperation and order from its vast territory, abundant resources, and industrious people was that the shift from a closed-off economic situation to an open economic situation requires systemic guarantees of property rights and other rights. As Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto notes, the main effects of property rights include features such as fixing the economic potential of assets, integrating dispersed information into one system, making people accountable, making assets fungible, networking people, and protecting transactions.49 “Big government” or “small government” is not the measure of whether a government is good or bad; only governments with formidable financial resources can succeed in a competitive age. Simplified libertarianism advocates “small government,” but in fact, a government’s accountability is more important than its scale. Historical cases are too numerous to mention, but comparing Spain and England, Spain possessed silver while England possessed a system and ultimately won. Under a “small government” administration, the property rights system is absent, and it is difficult for a market economy to take shape. The fate of the Ming dynasty’s Shen Wansan and the Qing dynasty’s bankrupt salt merchants proves that while imperial power can endow commercial privileges for a time, it can also strip away those privileges in an instant. That’s why even though China early on produced private local banks (qianzhuang), money-exchange shops, and other such organizations that in their technical details were not unlike Western banks, ultimate protection of property rights was always difficult to obtain, expanding the scale of property rights was impossible, and a monetary system and financial system in the modern sense were unable to take shape. The monetary system also makes it possible to compare China’s and Japan’s different historical paths. Quite a few Japanese economic historians point out that Japan didn’t begin trying to mint coins until the seventh century, and these had limited circulation, with a return to bartering in the eleventh century; it was not until Japan began trading with China in the twelfth century that it drew in large amounts of coins from the Song dynasty. Song dynasty bronze coins had an enormous effect on Japan, and Song dynasty exports of bronze coins could bring a tenfold profit.50 By the Ming dynasty, Japan was still dependent on Chinese bronze coins while at the same time exporting silver to China. With the inflow\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\nof American silver into China, Japanese silver began to be used domestically instead, and during the Shogunate Period gold, silver, and bronze existed concurrently. Mining commenced at the Iwami Ginzan silver mine in 1526, and the adoption of the Korean soot-blowing smelting method led to a significant increase in silver production. The Edo shogunate took more direct jurisdiction over silver mining and began paying attention to the outflow of precious metals. Producing its own silver made Japan more independent in terms of its monetary policy, but even though it enjoyed monetary sovereignty based on its own silver, Shogunate-era Japan remained more backward than China. It wasn’t until the seventeenth century that Japan began minting its own currency, and it took an entire century for these coins to gradually replace the Chinese coins that had been flowing into Japan since the Middle Ages. In 1853 the American naval commodore Matthew Perry commanded his fleet to enter Edo Bay, forcing the shogunate government to sign the Kanagawa Treaty (in Japanese, the “Japan and U.S. Treaty of Peace and Amity”) the next year. Perry’s expedition not only changed Japanese history, but also indirectly changed the narrative of China and the world. Disadvantaged by the arrival of the Americans, Japan chose to engage in reform and spared no effort in revamping its financial system during the Meiji Restoration. This greatly facilitated Japan’s ability to stand out in modernized competition. After defeating China in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895, Japan used Qing reparations to adopt the gold standard and became a rising imperial power, a narrative that provides much food for thought. We should note that it was systemic reform, and not merely precious metal or even monetary sovereignty, that led to Japan’s rise. As the first country to use coins, China has a monetary history that spans thousands of years; there were metal specie during the Warring States period, and Song China invented the world’s first paper currency. Regrettably, the traditional financial system’s inability to produce a banking system meant that paper currency was not properly utilized after its invention. China was compelled to revert to the silver standard, and for a long time silver was a weighed currency, slowing the advancement of the finance system for hundreds of years.\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nFinance and banking are of major significance to the industrialization of developing countries. Japan and Germany are prime examples of how only a powerful fiscal system can sustain a budget oriented toward economic development and then generate the positive feedback of economic development needed to sustain the government. In other words, without fiscal strength, it is impossible to support the modernization of a governmental system. China was never able to create this positive cycle from the Ming and Qing onward; even the Republican government was unable to accomplish the modernization of its finance and taxation, and the government never gained adequate support from tax revenue. The financial predicaments of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties and the Republic are not foreign to today’s context. On the institutional economics level, tax is essentially an institutional rent; through tax relations we can examine institutional relations, with currency as a link between the two. As economist Mancur Olson says, roving bandits become stationary bandits because the income of stationary bandits is higher and more stable than that of roving bandits, and when stationary bandits evolve into a government adept at collecting taxes from the general populace, it is more effective than a government that only knows how to pillage and plunder.51 The American economic historian Bradford DeLong once said that the history of the twentieth century was overwhelmingly economic history.52 In fact, the history of all eras is economic history, with the flesh and blood of economics concealed under a political and military epidermis, and finance as a blood vessel that never stops pulsing. Yet, financial history, especially monetary history, is often relegated to the ignominy of willful exaggeration and distortion in popular literature, and to being more or less ignored by mainstream scholars; even the question of whether money matters is still argued endlessly in macroeconomics. Kindleberger points out that economic history often lacks focus. He cites a fellow economist affirming the importance of finance and money in history: “The nations with which economic historians are chiefly concerned organize their economic activities under the form of making and spending money . . . Cannot economic history be organized most effectively around the evolution of pecuniary institutions?”53\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\nWhy did the East fall behind the West in modern times? This question has evoked countless responses as a variant of the famous Needham Question,54 the Holy Grail of economic history. Historians tangle with momentous events such as the Industrial Revolution, while economists grope around for the details of the handicraft industry. It is worth noting that the dimension of monetary finance is seldom mentioned. In fact, Europe had a financial revolution before its Industrial Revolution, and this financial revolution was the reason why capitalism was able to take off. So Chinese history’s insoluble enigma is not necessarily attributable to (the use of) silver, but the fate of silver can provide possible explanations and answers. Let’s shift the scene back to 1262, when the two poles of world civilization, Venice in the West and the Southern Song in the East, both faced the specter of war, and funding for these wars hung by a thread. Almost simultaneously, the authorities of both places came up with plans to deal with their emergencies, both involving the most advanced financial innovations of that time. The Southern Song’s Jia Sidao raised military funding by using the steadily devaluing huizi to buy up public land and strip the populace of wealth. Venice took a different road: Its parliament authorized the government to mortgage its tax revenue, and when a fiscal deficit developed, the administration issued government bonds paying interest of 5 percent. In retrospect, Venice’s financial innovation summoned the magic power of public debt as capital and effectively led Europe into an era of financial revolution. As for China, the excessively issued huizi did not regain the favor of the market; rather, public discontent and unrest threw open the door for invasion by the Mongolians. The collapse of its currency ultimately led China onto the road of a silver economy, and the financial watershed of the thirteenth century virtually decided the different fates of the East and West. Even if history has no hypotheticals, it is tempting to consider what Jia Sidao might have done if the huizi hadn’t been devalued. If the Public Land Law had succeeded, the Southern Song wouldn’t have crumbled. When the young Marco Polo arrived in Hangzhou at the end of the thirteenth century, he probably would still have considered it the most beautiful and noble city in the world, but he might not have,\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nin accordance with Yuan dynasty convention, referred to the genteel Jiangnan region as a barbarous province. Returning to history in progress, we witness China taking the lead on finance and currency, but in the wrong direction. China at a very early stage had “flying money” (feiqian) for remitting funds, as well as pawnshops, silver shops, and other such establishments for credit transfer; the Song dynasty’s paper currency originated in private institutions; and private local banks (qianzhuang) and money-exchange shops (piaohao) experienced extraordinary growth in the Ming and Qing dynasties. So why didn’t China produce a modern banking industry? The crux of the problem was China’s failure to develop a banking system. This created a closed loop in which the lack of banks prevented the development of a modern state, and the lack of a modern state made it difficult to develop a banking system in the genuine sense. In a long-range review, this can be seen as the great economic divergence between East and West. Scholars typically believe that China didn’t fall behind the West until the sixteenth century, or even the eighteenth century, but I believe that before this great economic divergence, there was already a great financial divergence, and although hidden, this divergence is the secret key that opens the bell jar of economic development. Many economic historians have revealed that the frontrunners after the seventeenth century, from Holland to England to the United States, first carried out financial reforms; even Japan, Russia, and other countries that only began Westernizing at the end of the nineteenth century all experienced varying degrees of financial revolution as their countries modernized, and newly emergent financial intermediaries played a critical role in financing industrial takeoff. In contrast, China retreated after the Song dynasty’s failed radical advance, and its monetary and financial institutions remained premodern. Whether using paper currency or silver, one of the cruxes of China’s premodern monetary system was its failure to achieve “bankification.” The unbankability of China’s currency led to the failure of China’s paper currency system and forced it to take the silver route. Without banks, and without the coinage of silver, progressing from bank notes to paper currency was out of the question. Currency could only exist in the form of confusing and outmoded metage currency. Without banks,\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\nChina’s savings couldn’t be capitalized, because only sectors such as credit institutions make it possible to remove constraints on capital and create more complex credit transactions. Without banks, China’s commercial institutions were unable to become companies, or to expand or emerge from the confines of interpersonal relationships. And without banks, the issuance of currency could not be centralized, and nothing like a central bank could emerge. The lack of banks became the crucial factor that prevented China’s economy from breaking through its closed loop. In contrast, banking institutions were a major boon to industry during Japan’s decades of reforms in the nineteenth century. Japanese banks steadily advanced through trial and error, initially referencing the American model and then the British and German models, with the result that in the Meiji era, Japan’s banks emerged in three main forms: First were the superbanks that circulated funds for tycoons; next were the policy banks established by the government; and then came more than 1,000 small banks that serviced local markets. This mutual alliance among industrialists, bankers, and the government hurled Japan into modernization with typhoon force. The difficulty of banks taking root in China and silver’s corresponding struggle constitute the hidden financial thread in China’s economic history, and also conceal the constant chess game between state power and market forces. The Ming and Qing eras coincided with immense change in the outside world. Was silver the reason for China’s falling behind? In a sense, silver was a symbol of China’s financial backwardness. If China, like Western Europe, had established new-style banking institutions, silver would gradually have been withdrawn from circulation and become reserves. But China’s traditional financial institutions were unable to support the vigorous growth of industry and commerce or even social progress, so silver was always the mainstream choice. In a certain sense, any country infiltrated by a precious metal like silver bears a kind of “resource curse”; not only China was that way, but even the Spanish crown, which possessed a steady stream of New World silver but declared bankruptcy more than ten times in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.55 Going a step further, what constrained China’s traditional financial system? The financial industry is an appendage of commerce—it can be\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nconsidered the superstructure of the superstructure—while historically commerce in China has always existed as an appendage to politics, which makes the financial industry an appendage to an appendage. This meant that even though China’s financial industry on the technical level had jiaozi, private banks, money-exchange shops, and other piecemeal innovations, it was a low achiever on the institutional and systemic level. While China’s Ming dynasty was still experimenting with royal treasury notes, Europe’s most successful banking family, the Medici, had already emerged. Regarded as riffraff in the early fourteenth century, this family controlled Florence for three centuries and produced three popes, two French royal consorts, and multiple princes and dukes, as well as bankrolling brilliant artists such as Raphael, Da Vinci, and Michelangelo. Their biggest clients were monarchs and popes, expanding their influence into the political sphere in a way that Chinese merchants could not easily replicate. At a time when, without protection of property rights or personal safety to speak of, direct plundering of wealth by those in power was the most convenient method, why bother with the more circuitous banking model? The Spring and Autumn Period still had the merchant king-maker Lü Buwei, but the Ming only had Shen Wansan, whose family was exterminated and his property confiscated. By the late Qing, having witnessed the power of Europe and America and even Japan, officials advocating Westernization finally recognized the power of finance, apart from gunboats and cannons. Zheng Guanying said during the Guangxu period (1875–1908): “Self-strengthening requires commerce, and commerce has its basis in banks. Western countries all establish banks to support commerce and serve as a resource hub for all the trades, as well as a source of funds to maintain the general situation.” Zheng Guanying had a clear understanding of the benefits of banks, listing ten main advantages: This is a summary of how they benefit the people and the country: In the rise and fall of banks are hidden the fundamental principles of administering the country, requiring communication from above and below, near and far. The first benefit is gathering the country’s wealth and profit and\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\npreparing it for use when needed; the second is planning major national economic projects such as railways and shipbuilding; the third is providing short-term credit in war or natural disaster; the fourth is relieving the financial burdens on government caused by raising loans from foreign banks with heavy interest; the fifth is more flexibly accepting securities as collateral rather than the strict requirements of foreign banks; the sixth is that if the country’s thriving silver shops and local private banks run short of cash, the bank can transfer funds so that the market is not undermined and business can be strengthened; the seventh is treating it like a treasury that pays annual interest, rather than subjecting it to the dark calculations of those who grasp for profit; the eighth is making no distinction between deposits by the government and by the private sector; the ninth is reducing reliance on foreign banks for foreign exchange; and the tenth is circulating bills of exchange in case of cash shortfalls on the market.56 In contrast to Zheng Guanying’s knowledge, the first student to study overseas in the Republican era, Yung Wing,57 put practical effort into establishing a national bank. Yung Wing was already talking about a national bank when he went to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in 1860 to see his friend Hong Renxuan,58 and in 1896 he submitted a memorial to the Qing government requesting the establishment of such an institution. His “Request to Establish Banking Regulations,” “Draft Bank Articles Continued,” and other documents focused on setting up banks, launching paper currency, strengthening industrial entities, and monitoring mortgaged assets, and he emphasized that the business model of banks must be Westernized: “Banks should imitate Western countries such as Britain and France; with repeated reform they improve with each change, American banks most of all. Japanese banks are also of great interest. This draft references American banking regulations, first establishing a headquarters in the capital, and then establishing banks in each provincial capital and trading port. Total banking capital should be 10 million yuan, under unified allocation by the Board of Revenue.”59\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\nDuring the self-strengthening movement following the SinoJapanese War of 1894–1895, the idea of a national bank enjoyed considerable support for a time, and the minister of works, Weng Tong, commended Yung Wing’s long residence in the United States as “essential for discussing banking.” This proposal had already gotten the nod, but it offended quite a few vested interests, and tycoon Sheng Xuanhuai’s suspicion, jealousy, and obstruction prevented it from being carried out. The frustration that Yung Wing experienced was the common fate of Western-educated intellectuals in China, and it reflects the difficulty of China’s financial launch. Ultimately the delays prevented China’s banking industry from transforming itself amid domestic unrest and foreign harassment, even while sparing no effort to catch up during the Republican era. In comparison, money-exchange shops flourished for a time during the late Qing, but they faced business challenges in the early twentieth century. At one point they attempted to transform into new-style banks, but their scale was too small; even their combined capital was less than that of the newly established Board of Revenue (Hubu) Bank (see Table 0-2). Significant differences in terms of management, services, and\n\nTable 0-2.

Regarding the financial practices of premodern China, including jiaozi currency, local private banks, silver shops (yinpu), and moneyexchange shops, even when similar to their overseas counterparts in their technical details, they never developed into complete and powerful financial institutions, and their scale was never large enough; the essential reason was that credit never extended far beyond interpersonal relationships. Taking it a step further, finance in premodern times typically assisted the government’s fiscal administration, the backwardness of which hampered the industry’s development. That is why China’s flourishing commerce could give rise to a traditional money trade, but could not foster a banking system in the modern sense. Finance is essentially credit, and social credit in turn decides the capabilities and scope of the financial system. At the same time, this credit must rely on the joint protection and sustenance of state and market forces. The development of finance also implies intertemporal and transindividual transfer of credit, and this trading relationship depends on safeguarding the rights of the individual. The triumph of silver was the market’s choice, and the emperor was obliged to reluctantly accept it. On the other hand, although it was the market’s choice, silver’s victory was ultimately Pyrrhic, constituting a “lose-lose” situation for both the government and the people—China was never able to shake off the fetters of systemic inertia, and the silver system was never able to evolve into a banking system. This prevented currency and finance from bringing greater room for growth and becoming the primary driving force for the economy. The intermediate forces between politics and capital and between rule of man and rule of law were always disadvantaged and even deficient. Capital was either unable to obtain political protection and was annihilated, or anxiously sought political protection and smothered itself. Commercial failure and success are usually bound by common cause to politics, and this is especially the case with finance. Silver was admired and desired and also cursed and criticized, and rapid changes in the inflow of silver changed the fates of Chinese dynasties. Even now, some commentators grumble that China’s use of silver\n\ni n t rodu c t ion\n\n\n\ncaused a loss of monetary sovereignty, but viewed another way, silver’s failure in China was in fact just one aspect of empire’s great failure. Finance could hardly experience substantive breakthrough before systemic transformation. It was the trend of empire’s political economy that determined the features of China’s financial history, as well as silver’s persistent influence and even its enormous demand. China wallowed in silver, was content with silver and deluded by silver; the constraints of power made the sense of security that silver provided irresistible. As a result, time and time again China was out of sync with world trends, and capitalists and entrepreneurs were mentally incapable of escaping Braudel’s “bell jar.” History is endless recollection, and finance is endless innovation; the interaction between the two constitutes a dynamic process of creative destruction.60 Finance is not a blank piece of paper, and the history of finance is not only about the secret of money, but is a unique perspective and indistinct main thread of rise and fall, beginning and end. Looking back at the history of silver, apart from seeing abruptness and inevitability in the fate of silver, we see the rise and fall of empire. The only way out for a route-locked civilization is to escape historical inertia and systemic suppression. Regret is not enough; we need to compare yesterday’s successes and failures with the present.\n\nO•N•E\n\nThe Divergent Fate of Silver in the East and the West\n\nWith that the goddess swept into the cavern’s shadowed vault, searching for hiding-places far inside its depth while Odysseus hauled his treasures closer up, the gold, durable bronze and finespun robes, the Phaeacians’ parting gifts.
