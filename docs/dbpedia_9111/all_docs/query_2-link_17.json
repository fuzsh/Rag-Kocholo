        "text": "Podcast here: https://soundcloud.com/user-280580802/71-chinese-socialism-in-the-xin-and-song-dynasty\n\nWhen we think of Chinese socialism, the first association is with Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, which won the Civil War and declared the People’s Republic of China in 1949, which exists to this date. However, there are deeper historical antecedents to socialism in the Chinese system. The main premise behind socialism is that the state would provide for the basic welfare of its citizens and reduce the ability of private entrepreneurs to take profits. Because state power has been consolidated since the Qin dynasty, we can go back to that period to analyze the major socialist actors in Chinese history. I will first examine Wang Mang (王莽), who reigned from 9 to 23 AD in his short Xin dynasty, followed by the New Policies under Chancellor Wang Anshi (王安石) from 1070 to 1076. The major conclusion is that Wang Anshi’s socialist policies worked better than Wang Mang’s.\n\nThe Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty, which was preceded by the Qin dynasty. Qin Shi Huang was the first emperor, who unified China. After Qin’s death, the Qin empire quickly disintegrated into 18 kingdoms. Two former rebel leaders Xiang Yu of Chu and Liu Bang of Han engaged in a war to determine supremacy, and Liu defeated Xiang in the Battle of Gaixia in 202BC. Chang’an became the new capital and Liu became the new emperor of what came to be known as Western Han, which ran until 9 AD. The new empire quickly became embroiled in an external war with the Xiongnu, a nomadic tribe to the north of China. Extensive military campaigns forced Emperor Wu and the Modernist faction to nationalize private industries. He created central government monopolies in salt, iron, liquor and bronze-coin minting. By controlling commodities that people needed, the emperor could extract labor and money from the citizens, which would be paid to soldiers, who fought the wars. The Modernist faction was opposed by the Reformists, who advocated for a cautious, non-expansionary foreign policy, frugal government budgeting and low taxes on private entrepreneurs.\n\nWang Zhengjun (71BC-13AD) was an important empress, then empress dowager (husband dies, son becomes king), and then grand empress dowager (son dies, grandson becomes king). When her grandson died, her nephew (younger brother’s son), Wang Mang, was appointed regent under Emperor Ping. He killed Ping in 6 AD and the child Liu Ying was chosen as successor again with Wang Mang as regent. Wang promised to surrender control once Liu became an adult, but after he got rid of his internal opponents he declared himself the king. But let’s step back for a moment and look more closely at Wang Mang’s biography.\n\nWang Mang’s father was Wang Man. His other was Qu. Wang Man was the younger brother of Empress Wang Zhengjun. As such Wang Mang was closely connected to power, but he did not live the lavish lifestyle that is common in the royal family. He was quite frugal, considerate and studious. He was close to some of his uncles, which made him a Marquess of Xindu. Importantly, Wang did not use his promotion to spend it on his personal habits but to support scholars and give gifts to colleagues to gain a positive reputation. An important promotion was to become commander of the armed forces. Wang Gen was the youngest surviving uncle as commander and he died in 8BC. Who was going to follow him? It could have been Zhang Chunyu, the dowager’s nephew via her younger sister. Wang Mang ensured that Zhang would not be appointed by framing his cousin for receiving bribes from the deposed Empress Xu to help her return to power. Zhang was executed and Wang Mang was appointed commander, which is the highest position in the imperial government.\n\nIn 7BC, His cousin, Emperor Cheng died from an overdose of aphrodisiacs given to him by his favorite consort Zhao Hede. Cheng was followed by his nephew (brother’s son) Liu Xin to become Emperor Ai. Wang temporarily remained in his post but because of a feud with Emperor Ai’s grandmother, Princess Dowager Fu of Dingtao (concubine of Grand Empress Dowager Wang’s husband Emperor Yuan), he was demoted and moved to Xindu (Nanyang, Henan). But because his governing ability was missed, Emperor Ai called him back to assist Grand Empress Dowager Wang in governance.\n\nEmperor Ai died in 1 BC without heir. Grand Empress Dowager Wang immediately called Wang Mang back to power by appointing him commander of the armed forces. Prince Jizi, the last surviving son of Emperor Yuan, was called to ascend the throne as Emperor Ping with Wang Mang appointed regent. Wang used his power to demote Grand empress Dowager Fu posthumously (as she died two years prior) and her family. Wang consolidated his power by building up a personality cult. He encouraged people to submit false prophesies that mention him as the second coming of the Duke of Zhou, a great mythical personality. One of Wang Mang’s opponent was his own son Wang Yu, who disliked his father’s dictatorial regime. Yu formed a conspiracy with his teacher Wu Zhang, his brother-in-law Lu Kuan to remove his father from power. They were trying to provoke a “supernatural incident” to scare Wang Mang into surrendering his power. They wanted to spray blood onto Wang Mang’s mansion door, but Lu Kuan was discovered by Wang Mang’s guard and the conspiracy was revealed. Wang Mang ordered his son Yu to commit suicide, and also executed his wife Lu Yan. Wang Mang used the conspiracy to purge all his potential opponents, including other family members.\n\nEmperor Ping became upset about many of his uncles being killed and resented Wang Mang. Wang realized the threat to his position and resolved to murder the emperor by adding poison to his wine. Wang convinced the mayor of South Chang’an to submit a rock with the writing “Wang Mang should be emperor” and he convinced the Grand empress Dowager to appoint him acting emperor until a new emperor could be found. The new emperor faced resistance from Liu Chong, Marquess of Anzhong, and Zhai Yi, governor of the Commander of Dong, who were both crushed by Wang’s armies. Wang then issued the decree to create his Xin dynasty, which lasted only from 9 to 23AD. So let’s turn to his policies.\n\nIn 9AD, Wang Mang instituted a revolutionary land redistribution system, which transferred all the land from private property to the empire. Land transactions were banned. Use rights remained with the private owners, but if the family had less than eight members and more than 0.6 km2 of land, it had to deliver that excess in land to fellow clan members, neighbors and villagers. He also abolished slavery, but heavy resistance against these policies made him revoke these policies 3 years later in 12 AD. Wang set up a state economic adjustment agency, which buys up excess of food and textiles and then sell the when the price increased. He instituted a sloth tax, where landowners refusing to cultivate land, city dwellers leaving their house without trees or citizens refusing to work had to pay a textile tribute. Those unable to pay it were required to work for the state. He introduced an income tax of 10%, the first of its kind, as head/ property tax were previously the main form of taxation. He created a state monopoly on liquor and weapons. These were expanded a few years later by salt, coinage, forestry and fishing. Because of rampant corruption, the imperial treasury did not receive much benefit while the people faced a high cost burden.\n\nA problematic reform was to issue 28 types of coins, made of gold, silver, tortoise shells, sea shells and copper. The problem was that it became impossible for residents to distinguish genuine from counterfeit and so people returned to the old Han coins in the underground trade economy. The Qing dynasty historian Zhao Yi made the following remarks to summarize the problems of economic policy under Xin,\n\nThe first of Wang Mang’s failures was to seize all private land under the wangtian system and prohibiting land transactions. If a person’s land exceeded 0.6 square kilometers, then he must distribute them to neighbors or relatives. Those who dared to oppose it were exiled to the wild borderland. He also prohibited people from saving and using the Han coins that the people considered reliable, and he also exiled those who violated this policy. Therefore, farmers and tradesmen lost their livelihood. Further, those who were severely punished for trading land or trading Han coins were innumerable. He then created the six monopolies, ordering local governments to monopolize liquor, salt, and iron, and he created taxes on the goods coming out of mountains, forests, and lakes. These are all policies that angered the Chinese.\n\nSource: Wikipedia, “Wang Mang”\n\nOne of the major reasons that the Xin government was ineffective was that they spent too much time researching legends about the Zhou dynasty’s government structure and they left government affairs undecided. Many local offices remained vacant and remaining local officials, who lacked supervision, became corrupt and oppressive of the populace. Wang Mang was highly suspicious of his subordinates and refused to delegate government decisions, which left him fatigued and many problems remained untackled. He only trusted the eunuchs to screen reports from local governments to him, but these eunuchs were not necessarily reliable conveyors of information. Lastly, Wang Mang insisted on reforming the salary of officials, but dragged his feet on it, which meant that many officials remained unpaid, which made them even more corrupt and oppressive on the populace.\n\nNatural disasters compounded political instability. In 11 AD the Yellow River overflowed the riverbanks. Beginning in 17, the combined pressure of natural disaster, the high cost of wars (especially with the neighboring Xiongnu kingdom), famines and corruption resulted in peasant rebellions, which Wang Mang brutally crushed. But by that point he lost the proverbial Mandate of Heaven, which is the moral right of the emperor to rule. The rebellions grew in size and was led by the brothers Liu Yan and Liu Xiu, a descendant of a distant branch in the Han imperial clan, who regrouped Han forces to defeat the Xin government forces led by Wang Yi and Wang Xun in the Battle of Kunyang in 23. The Xin forces had many more troops than the Han, but the Xin commanders made the mistake of splitting their forces by sending 10,000 men to attack Liu Xiu’s forces. As the Xin losses were mounting, the remaining Xin troops who were hiding in the rear refused to come out for battle. They were hit in a second wave of attacks, which led to the collapse of the Xin forces. The soldiers deserted and went home. The Han forces converged on the capital in Luoyang, where they killed Wang Mang. His body was cut into pieces and his head was hung on the city wall of Wancheng. The Han dynasty was restored.\n\nThe second example is Wang Anshi’s New Policies in the 1070s during the Song dynasty (960-1279). The Song period is divided between the Northern Song (960-1127) and the Southern Song (1127-1279). The Southern Song had to surrender the vast northern territory to Mongol invaders, who formed the Yuan dynasty. The Mongols ultimately crushed the Song with a full conquest in 1279. The Northern Song were established in 960, when Emperor Taizu of Song spent 16 years conquering the rest of China and uniting five dynasties and ten kingdoms. In Kaifeng, he set up a strong central government that promotes state bureaucrats via the civil service examination.\n\nBy the 11th century, political rivalries began to divide the court as ministers had different views on how to regulate society and economy. The Song state suffered from weak state capacity, as the large landowners evaded the land taxes, which shifted the burden of taxes on the peasantry. The low state revenues and the high expense of maintaining the court and the wars resulted in rising budget deficits and inflation, which created the reform pressure to stabilize state finances.\n\nThe reformist chancellor Fan Zhongyan instituted the Qingli reforms in the 1040s, which increased the salaries of minor officials to reduce corruption and reformed the recruitment of officials based on merit, intellect and character. Fan was opposed by conservative officials, who feared that drastic civil service reforms could inhibit their own careers and they successfully appealed to the emperor to rescind the reforms in 1045. The reformists were silenced until Wang Anshi became chancellor in 1070. Wang came from a family of imperial scholars and scored high on the imperial exam. He was promoted through the ranks until he became chancellor. Wang continued the civil service reforms by increasing the supervision of civil servants to reduce corruption. He also changed the examination system to ask more practical matters including law, military, medicine and mathematics, as the civil service exam tends to be focused on knowing the literary classics by heart.\n\nBut in addition to the civil service, Wang Anshi was much more radical than Fan. He argued that the state had the responsibility to provide its people the essential goods for a decent standard of living, which means that the state has to take over commerce, industry and agriculture. Wang was skeptical of private property, which would only benefit the rich while exploiting the working masses. However, he never got rid of private property. The state should demand tax payments in government-issued currency rather than corvee labor, increase the supply of copper coins, direct government loans to farmers during planting season which is repaid at harvest, who no longer would have to rely on greedy private moneylenders. During the good times, relieved farmers could use the government loans to increase harvests and pay more taxes. On the other hand, these loans imposed a heavy burden on farmers during periods of drought, where local officials insisted on collecting the loans even though the farmers could not repay, forcing the farmers to leave their land and fall into destitution. The drought fiasco resulted in Wang’s resignation in 1074.\n\nSpeculation and private monopolies were curbed with price controls. He introduced state monopolies. He introduced regulated wages and set up pensions for the aged and unemployed. The state introduced public orphanages, hospitals, dispensaries, hospices, cemeteries and reserve granaries. Wang also introduced the baojia system of collective responsibility, where villages kept a household register to determine tax payment and service of soldiers in the military. Wang introduced a balanced-delivery law, which gave the state the power to purchase commodities at a low price (via government-issued currency), and deliver them for the needs of the central state (e.g. sustaining the state bureaucracy) or sell it at a higher price. The state treasury further benefited from a new land survey, which applied taxes to hitherto unregistered fields. The state also imposed taxes on mining products. Thus, Wang Anshi’s work raised state capacity and central power, even as it came at the expense of merchants and officials who profited from a less efficient status quo (less taxes, easier promotion/ corruption).\n\nWang Anshi was opposed by the conservative faction, which was led by the later Chancellor Sima Guang. The conservative faction was in a weaker position as long as Wang Anshi and his allies (like Shen Kuo) were in power. The conservative statesman Su Shi was jailed and exiled for criticizing Wang’s reforms. Wang was supported by emperor Shenzong (1067-1085). After his resignation as chancellor in 1074, a year later Shenzong recalled Wang Anshi, but he was now vulnerable to open critique by the conservatives who were vindicated by the drought-loan problem. During that time, Wang’s son died. In 1076, exhausted from the political struggles Wang returned to Nanjing where he continued to write and engage in scholarship through his death in 1086, but New Policies remained in place as his allies remained in power.\n\nAfter Shenzong’s death, his son Emperor Zhezong took over, but he was still a kid. His grandmother Grand Empress Dowager Gao was holding the reins of power and she appointed the conservative Sima Guang as chancellor, thus reversing the New Policies by Wang Anshi from 1085 to 1086, when Sima died. Wang Anshi died in the same year. Emperor Zhezong was a supporter of Wang’s New Policies but could not influence policy as long as his grandmother Dowager Gao was still alive. When she died in 1093, Zhezong restored the New Policies, though they were pursued less rigorously without a strong leader. Zhezong died in 1100 and was succeeded by his half-brother, who became Emperor Huizong, and he continued the reform policy, but had to abdicate in 1126, when the Northern Song were routed by the Mongol invaders from the Jin dynasty.\n\nSo is there a central lesson of past versions of Chinese socialism? Both Wang Mang and Wang Anshi were concerned about the power of the wealthy and wanted to improve the situation for the peasant masses. But Wang Mang’s ambition to confiscate and redistribute land were made with substantial local resistance, as landowners opposed brash transfer of land and had to be reversed. A big mistake was the currency reform, which flooded the market with too much currency which traders and consumers distrusted. The biggest problem with Wang Mang was that he was a narrow-minded authoritarian, who distrusted all his subordinates and refused to delegate any tasks to him. Official positions were unfilled and unsupervised local officials could oppress people with high taxes and corrupt waste. Wang Mang only liked to listen to sycophants, who wanted to give him the good news even as his empire was imploding with peasant rebellions.\n\nWang Anshi had redistributionist preferences as well but refrained from nationalizing the means of production. Instead the private sector had to become more honest actors, which would strengthen state capacity in the form of higher tax payments and serve social purposes as their trade monopolies were smashed up and prices were restrained for consumers. Rising tax revenues were also invested into better public services like hospitals. Wang Anshi also understood that his reforms could only work if the masses had confidence in the state government, so he made sure that low-level officials would be paid higher so they would be less susceptible to corruption and squeezing out the population. Furthermore, he reformed civil service recruitment by asking test-takers practical governance skills (how to ensure good harvest, how to set up irrigation systems, how to clamp down on corruption etc.) rather than make them recite poems and arcane texts. Creating functioning and reliable state officials is what Wang Mang had neglected, and was probably the decisive difference in why “socialism with Chinese characteristics” was less acceptable in the Xin than the Song dynasty.\n\nDoes that have any implications for the current CCP rulers? Surely, Mao could draw on a deeper communitarian spirit in Chinese society and history which has favored the communist system to prevail. China can boast a 6,000 year uninterrupted civilization with over 2,000 years of a strong central government, which is the crucial institution with which socialist redistribution policies are possible. Much has changed since Deng Xiaoping’s opening reforms in the late-1970s. China has joined the global capitalist economy and emphasizes more individual accomplishment, even as it never surrendered party control over the economic process, e.g. the presence of state-owned enterprises and CCP officials in private company boards. Never having developed much of a liberal society, the CCP is also quite effective in clamping down on dissidents and civil society critics. The authoritarian structures have been a blessing and a curse simultaneously during the pandemics, as censorship and punishment of doctors reporting on Covid-19 were responsible for the early spread of the disease, but authoritarian surveillance ensured a swift lockdown of Wuhan and a limiting in the number of cases and fatality, which most other liberty-loving countries around the world are struggling to fully implement, hence the higher caseload and fatality incidence outside of China.\n\nSimilar to Wang Anshi, the Xi Jinping administration has tried to improve the quality of its civil service by clamping down on corruption, but these efforts are always hampered by Xi’s unwillingness to introduce genuine rule of law, fearing rightfully that the CCP would lose supremacy and with that popular legitimacy. Hence, one cannot expect too much out of high profile targeting of corrupt officials, who also happen to be in the anti-Xi camp.\n\nThe merging of capitalism with Chinese socialism is proclaimed as the most natural thing by the CCP, and the claim draws on the high rates of economic growth and the huge poverty reduction over the last 40 years. But not all is well. Capitalism is a box of pandora and requires conditions to be just right to be sustained. One of these conditions is globalization. Globalization means that western countries have incorporated Chinese workers into the global production chains, but we are witnessing a threat to globalization coming from Trumpist nationalism precisely because of the globalization-induced sharply rising inequality and the devastating consequences on the western working class, who have been bypassed by globalization.\n\nChina’s belt-and-road initiative is the evident attempt to stamp out dependence on US markets by shifting emphasis to Europe and the other countries along the way, including the Middle East and Africa. These external markets remain important as the rate of return on domestic infrastructure projects are declining. But it isn’t evident that the Chinese growth model remains sustainable. In addition to the depressing effects of the pandemic, the demographic component of economic growth spoke favorably to China from the 1980s to the early-2010s. Since then, we are witnessing a rapid shrinkage in the working age population and a rapid aging of society. Another threat to growth is that China already has the world’s best technology (much of it stolen from the US), and will find it difficult to come up with its own technology strategy. Combined with a turn away from globalization, the Chinese social contract is once again in turmoil and the rulers better come up with redistributionist measures to attain their goal for a “harmonious” society or risk surrendering the Mandate of Heaven once more.\n\nFurther readings:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xin_dynasty\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Mang\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Anshi\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Policies_(Song_dynasty)\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Wang-Anshi\n\nhttp://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Terms/wanganshireforms.html\n\nhttps://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Wang_Anshi"
