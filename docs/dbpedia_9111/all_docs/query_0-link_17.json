From the dawn of antiquity onward, early Chinese traders used money in one form or another. It was not long after the Chinese invention of paper that the first paper money came into existence, making it the oldest paper money to be found in the world.\n\nPart I discusses the evolution of the copper cash coin – the mainstay of the Chinese people for two thousand years – the invention of paper, the discovery of the use of paper money in China by Marco Polo and the various cash notes issued by the Tang, Liao, Sung, Hsia, Chin and Yuan dynasties.\n\nAncient Chinese Cash Notes – the World’s First Paper Money – Part II\n\nPart II describes Ming dynasty paper money issues and identifies the coins depicted on the 1 kwan bank note of emperor Hung Wu (1378 A.D.)\n\nMoney of the Kingdom of Heavenly Peace\n\nFew people, if asked today, could identify the Kingdom of Heavenly Peace, tell you where it was located, or how or why it came into existence. The Kingdom of Heavenly Peace, founded in 1850, started as a noble experiment with great promise, which soon turned into outright rebellion against the Chinese Empire. The movement went terribly wrong, ultimately claiming the lives of 25 million Chinese before government troops, aided by Western forces, restored order.\n\nDuring their fifteen year civil war the T’ai P’ing rebels, as they were called, formed a government which included an army, a civilian civil service bureaucracy, treasury and even a postal system of their own. This article studies the money of the T’ai P’ing rebels including both coins and bank notes. Few specimens of either survive today. The coin issues are varied and interesting. The bank notes, although referenced in various old numismatic books, are completely unknown to Westerners, have never been cataloged, and to my knowledge appear here for the first time..\n\nANCIENT CHINESE CASH COIN AND NOTES ’S\n\nFIRST PAPER MONEY\n\nPART I\n\nINTRODUCTIONS\n\nChina has had a long and diversified numismatic history. From the dawn of antiquity onward, early Chinese traders used money in one form or another.look the picture of\n\nChinese trader at Bantam Indonesia in 14th century and\n\nin Tibet and\n\nphillipine\n\nAncient Chinese paper money\n\nhas always held a fascination for me partly because, without question, it is the world’s oldest.\n\nNot only is the ornamental format of these ancient notes aesthetically pleasing , more importantly they represent an esoteric subject area into which few collectors have ventured.\n\nWe know of them not only through rare surviving specimens, but also through ancient Chinese works on numismatics.\n\nThese e-books occasionally illustrated the specimens under discussion, and in this way their history has been preserved down through the ages to the benefit of modern scholars.\n\nIn recent years\n\nChinese archeologists\n\nhave had great success\n\nin documenting archeological sites\n\nin which ancient relics including\n\ncoins and paper money have been found.\n\nThe history of ancient Chinese paper money is, unfortunately, not a happy one.\n\nInitially the notes were accepted as a great convenience, partially because they were backed by cash reserves. Over time the authorities greatly abused and misused the right of note issue, sometimes for personal gain, until the notes became so inflated the people would not accept them.\n\nPaper notes were viewed by the peasantry as a form of\n\nsupplemental taxation, as the government ultimately refused to acknowledge responsibility for cashing them.\n\nBy the mid-15th century\n\na popular uprising was in the making.\n\nTo avoid rebellion,\n\nthe Ming emperor Jen Tsung\n\nforbid further circulation of paper, thereby reverting to a specie economy. China did not have a paper currency again\n\nuntil 1853, when\n\nthe Ch’ing emperor Hsien-feng re-authorized the issue of paper money to meet the escalating cost of suppressing\n\nthe T’ai-ping Rebellion.\n\nThe Evolution of Copper Cash\n\nCowrie shells\n\nwere the first items to be used in Chinese commerce.\n\nArcheological excavation of ancient tombs has revealed their wide use as early as\n\nthe 16th century B.C.\n\nThese items, due to their small size and portability, proved more\n\npopular than animal hides, jade and silk, bartered. These shells, originating in far off seas, were not native to China; hence they acquired a certain value of their own.\n\nThe ancient china cowries coins\n\nused in trade eventually evolved\n\nInto Bone\n\n,\n\nClay heaven currency\n\nand\n\nbronze replicas.\n\nIt wasn’t until the end of the Chou dynasty (1000-400BC) that\n\nthe first metal currency was developed.\n\nRead more info\n\nCHINA, cowrie imitations and derivatives, including the bronze “ant-nose” coins\n\nLet’s call the stone and shell imitations, Shang-Zhou, c. 1400-900 BC in round numbers, and why not attribute the much more common bone imitations to early-middle Zhou, c. 1100-500 BC? Of course if we knew what grave they were, uh, taken from, then we’d know, but we don’t. The bronze “realistics” are probably contemporary with the bones or later. The various “ant-nose” coins are c. 400-300 BC.\n\nCCSL1) CHINA, cowrie & imitation lot: 6 pieces of cypraea moneta shells with filed backs, 6 imitations in white alabaster 12x17mm with 2 holes, & a teardrop shaped shell bead with a face carved on it & hole at pointy end, from unknown location in south-central China, 10 pcs total, $185.00\n\n.\n\nCCS9) CHINA, white sandstone cowrie imitation, 26x17mm, $24.00\n\nCCS10) CHINA, white sandstone cowrie imitation, bit of original red paint, $27.00 sold 7/18/2011\n\n.\n\nCCS8) CHINA, translucent alabaster cowrie imitation, 35x22mm, cleft, hole, nice $35.00 sold\n\n.\n\nCCS16) CHINA, alabaster cowrie imitation, 30x19mm, crude $31.00 sold 4/13/2010\n\nCCS7) CHINA, stone cowrie imitations\n\na) coarse white sandstone, 31x26mm, $24.00 sold 7/18/2011\n\nb) another, 29x24mm, $22.00 sold 4/13/2010\n\nc) fine off-white sandstone, 19x15mm, $19.00 sold\n\nd) another sandstone piece, $19.00 sold\n\ne) translucent alabaster, 15x15mm, $33.00 sold\n\n.\n\nCCS13) CHINA, marble cowrie imitation, 24x18mm, carved cleft & center hole, $35.00 sold 4/13/2010\n\n.\n\nCCS14) CHINA, marble cowrie imitation, 28x22mm, $38.00 sold 7/18/2011\n\nClick picture for enlargement.\n\nCCS11) CHINA, cowrie imitation in fine white sandstone, 29x22mm, $24.00 sold 4/13/2010\n\nClick picture for enlargement.\n\nCCS12) CHINA, cowrie imitation in fine white sandstone, 31x21mm, 12mm thick, light chipping on back, $14.00 sold\n\nClick picture for enlargement.\n\nCCJ4) CHINA, jade cowries, ~32x18mm, nice, any of these at $85.00 each b is sold, I have several more unpictured.

About 4000 years ago, Chinese coins were cast and widely circulated in the Zhou Dynasty . Ever since then, the cast coins became the most common form of ancient Chinese currency. After Qin’s unification of the country in 221 BC, the round coin with a central square hole superseded all previous types of cast metal coins. They circulated continuously till the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368-1911), though the style varied with time. By the Song Dynasty (960-1279) paper notes had appeared and were used in the Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties (1279-1911). Silver coins appeared in the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, and minted silver and copper coins circulated in the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty (1875-1908). The development of monetary system in ancient China has a close connection with the history of Chinese economy and politics.\n\nDifferent ancient Chinese coins\n\nCowry shells\n\nCowry shells were used as the medium of exchange in the late Xia Dynasty (21st century BC). Those from the Shang Dynasty (16th century BC to 11th century BC) usually had teeth on one side and a hole for stringing on the flat polished other side. As natural cowries were limited in quantity, copies made of stone, other seashells, bone and bronze were also in circulation. Bronze replicas of cowries became the first Chinese cast coins.\n\nWeighted metals\n\nSmelted metal pieces without any denomination were used as money in commodity exchanges. They were valued according to the weight and material quality. Gold plates were used in the Chu State during the Warring States period (475- 221 BC).\n\nSpade-shaped coins\n\nCast coins in the shape of a spade were developed in the early days of metal coin usage, and were still used sporadically until the early part of the Han Dynasty. In the beginning they had a hollow handle, but during the Warring States period (475-221 BC), the handle was solid.\n\nSword-shaped coins\n\nSword-shaped coins were a cast coin in a sword shape with a ring at the end of the handle.\n\nRound coins\n\nThere are two types of cast round coins in ancient China: one with a round hole in the center like a ring, the other with a square hole in the center.\n\nMinted coins\n\nDuring the Guangxu reign period (1875-1908) of the Qing Dynasty, western coin minting technology was introduced into China. Zhang Zhidong, the governor-general of Guangdong and Guangxi regions, set up a mint in Guangzhou with some machines brought from Britain and made the first Chinese minted coins-silver and copper dollars-in the fifteenth year of Guangxu’s reign (1889).\n\nCowry-shaped bronze coins\n\nCowry-shaped bronze coins were cast in the Chu State during the Warring States period (475-221 BC). They usually had inscriptions of strange characters. One character, often seen, looks like an ant, another one like a monster’s face.\n\nGold coins\n\nThe Chu State was the first in ancient China to cast gold coins. Both have the stamped inscription “Ying Cheng.” Ying was the capital of the Chu State, and “Cheng” was read as “Yuan,” a metric unit of weight and was also used as the name of the money. So it was called “Yuan Jin” meaning gold coins. They were valued by their weight in circulation.\n\nSpade-shaped coin\n\nAmong the spade-shaped coins, there is a rare type that has three round holes. It carries over 20 kinds of inscriptions on its face and a denomination of “Liang” (teal) or “Shi Er Zhu” (12 Zhu) on the back. It is the earliest Chinese coin with a determined denomination.\n\n“Ban Liang” (half teal) coin\n\nThe Qin Ban Liang (half teal) coin, is round with a central square hole. It became the national legal currency after the first emperor united the country (221 BC). The denomination Ban Liang, refers to its weight, which equals 7.5 gram.\n\nWu Zhu coins\n\nWu Zhu (five Zhu) coins, weighing about 3 gram each, were cast in the Wudi reign period (140-135 BC) of the Han Dynasty. They were continuously used till the Sui Dynasty (581-618).\n\nXin Mang coins\n\nAs a result of four reformations of the monetary system by the Xin Mang government (9-23), the Wu Zhu coin system was abolished and a great variety of currency appeared in the country. The newly issued coins were odd-shaped ingots of silver, gold or bronze. The bronze coin inscriptions were especially fine.\n\nKai Yuan Tong Bao coins\n\nIn 621, the 4th year of Tang Emperor, Wude, Kai Yuan Tong Bao coins were formally issued and the former Wu Zhu coin system was abolished. As the major currency of the Tang Dynasty each Kai Yuan Tong Bao coin weighed one-tenth Liang. Tong Bao and Yuan Bao were other coins minted during this period.\n\nJiao Zi paper notes\n\nIn the early Song Dynasty iron coins were popularly used in Sichuan province. Because they were small in value and heavy to carry, merchants issued a paper note called Jiao Zi, the earliest paper note in the world.\n\nSilver ingots\n\nSince the Tang and Song dynasties (618-1279), silver had been used as money. It was cast in various forms, with ingots being the most common one.\n\nCHINA, “Hell” money\n\nPerhaps you are familiar with the modern imitation paper money burned in Chinese funerals. At some of these functions miniature papier mache models of cars, TV sets, etc. are also burned as part of the proceedings. These modern versions are survivals of practices that began thousands of years ago with the interment of real objects, animals, and even people at the funeral.\n\nThese things are “Hell” money. Seems reasonable to assume that the cowries are late Zhou, perhaps 300 BC, when they were using cowries and cowrie imitations for money. The others were described to me as “Han dynasty or later.”\n\nCHINA, clay cowries, 3 different styles, VG-F @ $6.50 each sold 10/14/2009\n\nCHINA, ZHOU Dynasty, 1122-255 BC, ant-nose series, “Jun,” H1.12, FD-5, clay, aVF $9.50 sold 6/7/2008\n\nCHINA, HAN Dynasty, c. 200 BC – 200 AD, clay funeral offerings.

Clay cowries, clay food, probably most of the lead versions of cast coins, etc. are funerary. Since paper money began about 1500 years ago imitation banknotes have been offered, usually, in latter centuries they are burned. If you go to any oriental store anywhere in the world you will find packets of “joss paper” for sale. There are thousands of different types made today.\n\n229-49.

These “coins” resembled actual tools in everyday use, such as\n\nspades,\n\nhoes\n\nand\n\nknives.\n\nCompare with ancient knife below\n\nThe prominent role agriculture played in the lives of\n\nthe ancient Chinese is reflected in the choice of the spade to represent civilization’s first metallic currency.\n\nBronze spades evolved from hollow-handled ones, which were\n\nminiature replicas of the real thing, followed by\n\nthe smaller bronze “pu”\n\nconsisting of round-shouldered and square foot spades.\n\nEveryone, whether or not they could read or write, instantly recognized the inherent value of a spade. Reducing the spade to a\n\nminiature pu representing the actual tool, not only made them convenient to carry, but greatly facilitated trade.\n\nIt was now possible to place a value on commodities: for example, ‘ten spades or two hoes for a sheep’ using coins to purchase necessities. In time, pu spades were supplanted by knife money. (Although some would argue that the knife came first.)\n\nThis form of coin was introduced by the kingdom of Ch’i, a\n\npractically independent state under Chou. The earliest Ch’i knives were approximately seven inches long. The knife blade often carried inscriptions indicating its origin and trade value.\n\nLater on, smaller knives, known as Ming knives made their appearance.\n\nThe term “Ming” when used in association with knife money is not to be confused with the Ming dynasty (1368-1644AD); rather these knives received their name from the town where they were made.\n\nEventually knife money evolved into round coins with center holes known as “pan-liangs” which were to become the prototype of all coins to follow.\n\nThe Chinese coinage system\n\nThe Western, Greek, coinage system\n\nwas based on precious metal coins\n\nstruck between two dies.\n\nIn contrast, Chinese coins\n\nwere made from copper-alloy,\n\nand\n\nwere cast in moulds.\n\nThe Chinese tradition flourished until the early twentieth century, when it was replaced by the European system.\n\nBefore 1000 BC,\n\ncowrie shells were used for payments, gifts and displays of wealth.\n\nLater these were replaced by substitutes made out of\n\nbone, bronze or jade. By the seventh century BC cloth and bronze tools such as hoes and knives were also being used as money. The first Chinese coins were produced when these objects were transformed into models representing their standardised value. ‘Spades’ and ‘knives’ were the standard currency in China until the second century BC.\n\nRead more info\n\nThis is a reference guide to\n\nthe cast coins of China from the Zhou Dynasty, including knife and spade coins, a listing of examples we currently have available can be viewed.\n\nImages represent the types and may be larger or smaller than the actual coins.\n\nRead more info\n\nChinese Charms with Coin Inscriptions\n\nThe mythical power of the written Chinese language along with the authority of the Chinese empire have traditionally combined to make Chinese coins into something more than just a form of currency.\n\nFor this reason, people believed that by utilizing the inscriptions (legends) of certain Chinese coins, the power of charms would be further enhanced.\n\nSome coin inscriptions are used on charms because they have an inherent auspicious meaning. For example, the inscription on the Liao Dynasty (916-1125 AD) qian qiu wan sui (千秋万岁) coin at the left expresses the hope for longevity with the meaning of “a thousand autumns and ten thousand years”. This Liao Dynasty coin is described in more detail below.\n\nAnother example would be the zheng de (正德) reign title of Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD) Emperor Wu Zong. Zheng de (正德) means “correct virtue”. The inscription zheng de tong bao (正德通宝), meaning “currency of correct virtue”, became a very popular inscription on Chinese charms even though no actual coins with this inscription were ever cast by the government! Please see the examples below.\n\nOther Chinese coin inscriptions seem to have been used on charms because the coins were issued during a time of disunity and unrest which the Chinese people, unfortunately, have faced many times throughout their history. Charms using the coin inscriptions of Wang Mang (7-23 AD), whose monetary reforms brought unprecedented disorder, belong to this category. Several examples are illustrated in the section below.\n\nStill other Chinese coin legends were used because of a perceived force in the metal used in the casting of the coins of that era, such as the Later Zhou Dynasty (951-960 AD) zhou yuan tong bao (周元通宝) charms.\n\nExamples of these and other charms with coin inscriptions are discussed in more detail in the sections below.\n\nWang Mang\n\n(7-23 AD)\n\nWang Mang usurped the throne in the year 7 AD and proceeded to institute a number of monetary reforms which became extremely unpopular.\n\nOne of the first coins Wang Mang introduced had the inscription da quan wu shi (大泉五十) and the coin with the colorful and heavy patina at the left is an example. The character above the square hole is da (大) meaning “big”. The character below the hole is quan (泉) which translates as “coin“. The character on the right is wu (五) which means “five” (5). The character on the left is shi (十) meaning “ten” (10). The value is therefore 5 x 10 = 50. The inscription thus means “large coin fifty”. The coin was declared to be the equivalent of 50 of the Han Dynasty wu zhu (五铢) coins which were the prevailing currency up to this time.\n\nThe reverse side of this coin is blank.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 31 mm and a weight of 9.3 grams.\n\nThe “coin” to the left is not to scale.\n\nIt is actually a charm that has the same inscription (da quan wu shi 大泉五十) and resembles the coin above.\n\nIt is very small and is certainly old, although it probably does not date to the time of Wang Mang.\n\nBecause of wear, the symbols on the reverse side are a little difficult to discern. To the right of the square hole is a snake with its head at the top and cocked back. To the left is a sword with its hilt at the top. Above the hole is a tortoise with its head facing to the right, and below the hole are the seven stars of the Big Dipper constellation all connected together by a line.\n\nThe tortoise has a long life-span and the snake is one of the five poisons. These two animals would eventually become entwined to become Xuanwu (玄武), also known as the Black Warrior.\n\nThe sword is a weapon able to cut through ignorance and slay evil spirits.\n\n“Longevity” is the overall implied meaning of these symbols. (Please see Hidden Meaning of Chinese Charms for more detailed information.)\n\nThis charm has a diameter of only 19 mm weighs just 1.5 grams.\n\nThis is a very interesting da quan wu shi (大泉五十) coin. If you look carefully at the Chinese character shi (十), meaning “ten” (10) to the left of the square hole, you will notice that it has not one but three horizontal lines. The Chinese character shi (十) for “ten” only has one horizontal line. The additional horizontal lines seems to mean that the coin is not worth 5 x 10 = 50 coins, but rather 5 x 30 = 150 coins!\n\nAnother characteristic of this coin is that the inscription is repeated on the reverse side thus making it a “double obverse” coin.\n\nThere seems to be some disagreement as to whether this specimen is actually a coin or a charm but I am treating it here as a charm.\n\nThe charm has a diameter of 25 mm and a weight of 8.2 grams.\n\nNorthern Zhou Dynasty\n\n(557-581 AD)\n\nAt the left is a Northern Zhou Dynasty coin cast in the year 574 AD during the reign of Emperor Wu.\n\nThe inscription is wu xing da bu (五行大布) which translates as “large coin of the five elements”.\n\nThe five elements consist of metal, wood, water, fire and water.\n\nFor a discussion of the five elements please see Charm Symbols: Star, Moon, Cloud and Dragon.\n\nThe reverse side of the coin is blank.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 26 mm and weight of 3.7 grams.\n\nThis is a charm written in the same seal script and with the same inscription or legend (wu xing da bu 五行大布) as the coin above.\n\nThe reverse side displays the same four symbols, namely the snake, tortoise, sword and the Big Dipper constellation, as on the Wang Mang da quan wu shi (大泉五十) charm discussed above.\n\nOn this charm, however, the sword is on the right and the seven star Big Dipper constellation is on the left.\n\nAbove the square hole is the snake which is coiled with its head facing to the left.\n\nThe tortoise is below the square hole with its head also facing to the left.\n\nThe charm has a diameter of 24.5 mm and a weight of 3.7 grams.\n\nThis obverse side of this large charm is based on the same Northern Zhou Dynasty coin and uses the same seal script calligraphy.\n\nIf you observe closely, though, the character at the bottom is written differently. Most experts still consider this character to be the same character 行 (xing) as on the Northern Zhou coin displayed above.\n\nOthers, however, believe that the character is actually 两 (liang) which was a unit of weight. The liang was the same unit of weight used, for example, on the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BC) and Western Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) banliang (半两) or “half tael” coins.\n\nThe reverse side has the same four symbols in the same location as the smaller charm above. The difference is that the snake is coiled differently and its head at the top facing right.\n\nAlso, the tortoise with its head on the right is now looking back towards the left.\n\nThe diameter of this charm is 32.5 mm and the weight is 7.3 grams.\n\nLater Zhou Dynasty\n\n(951 – 960)\n\nFollowing the fall of the great Tang Dynasty in 907, China experienced another period of turmoil and disunity known as the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms which lasted 907 – 960 AD.\n\nEmperor Shi Zong of the Later Zhou issued his coinage patterned on that of the kai yuan tong bao (开元通宝) which had become the standard coin of the Tang Dynasty.\n\nEmperor Shi Zong’s coin is displayed to the left. The inscription reads zhou yuan tong bao (周元通宝) which translates as the “Zhou First Currency” and was cast during the years 951-960 AD.\n\nThe zhou yuan tong bao very quickly became a popular inscription used on Chinese charms.\n\nThe reason is because, beginning in the year 956, Emperor Shi Zong ordered that the bronze Buddha statues in the Buddhist temples, as well as the bronze items owned by the people, be turned in to the government so that they could be melted down and used to cast coins. As a result, coins with this inscription are considered especially auspicious because they contain metal from Buddhist statues.\n\nThis belief has carried over to the charms and amulets cast during the following centuries which display the same inscription.\n\nThe reverse side of the coin shows a “moon” between the square hole an the rim at the seven o’clock position. For a discussion of the “moon” symbol please visit Charm Symbols: Star, Moon, Cloud and Dragon.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 24 mm and a weight of 3.5 grams.\n\nThe obverse side of this charm closely resembles that of the coin above and the inscription, zhou yuan tong bao (周元通宝), is the same.\n\nAlthough this charm is from a later period, charms with this Chinese coin inscription are very popular.\n\nBecause the actual coins with this inscription were cast using bronze from Buddhist statues, the Chinese believed that this was also true for charms and amulets with the same inscription even though they may have been cast in the following centuries.\n\nThe reverse side of this old charm has a dragon on the left and a phoenix on the right.\n\nThe two are facing each other with their heads at the bottom of the charm.\n\nCharms with a dragon and phoenix are considered auspicious marriage charms.\n\nFor additional information on this theme, please visit Chinese Marriage Charms.\n\nThe diameter of the charm is 22.5 mm and the weight is 5.6 grams.\n\nLike the charm above, the obverse side of this charm has the auspicious Chinese coin inscription zhou yuan tong bao (周元通宝).\n\nThis is the reverse side of the charm revealing that it is another phoenix and dragon marriage charm.\n\nIn this example, however, the phoenix is on the left and the dragon is on the right. The two are facing each other with their heads at the top of the charm.\n\nIt is a little difficult to see but the wings of the phoenix are just to the left of the square hole. The head is at the eleven o’clock position and the tail feathers are at the seven o’clock position.\n\nThe dragon is on the right with the tip of its mouth at the twelve o’clock position and a dot representing its left eye at the one o’clock position. Its left front claw is just above the square hole. The dragon’s body curves down the right side of the charm and its left rear claw is just below the central hole. Its tail is almost touching the upper tail feather of the phoenix.\n\nThe charm has a diameter of 25 mm and a weight of 6.6 grams.\n\nThis is the obverse side of another ancient charm based on the zhou yuan tong bao (周元通宝) coin of the Later Zhou Dynasty.\n\nSimilar to the example above, the dragon is on the right and the phoenix is on the left.\n\nThe two mythical animals are sculpted in high relief and are facing each other with their heads at the top of the charm.\n\nThis charm has a diameter of 23.5 mm and a weight of 6.8 grams.\n\nSong Dynasty\n\n(960-1279)\n\nThe coin displayed at the left is an example of coins with the inscription tai ping tong bao (太平通宝) cast during the years 976-989 of the reign of Emperor Tai Zong (976-997) of the Northern Song Dynasty.\n\nThis was the first Song Dynasty coin inscribed with an imperial or reign title.\n\nThe reign title tai ping (太平) means “peace”.\n\nThis same inscription, tai ping tong bao (太平通宝), was also used on coins cast during the years 1854-1855 by the Shanghai Small Sword Society (xiao dao hui 小刀会) during the Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864).\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 24.8 mm and weighs 4 grams.\n\nThis is a charm based on the tai ping tong bao (太平通宝) coin of the Song Dynasty.\n\nTai ping, meaning “peace” or “great peace”, has always been a strong desire of a people and it is, therefore, an appropriate inscription for a charm.\n\nThis is an unusually well-made charm as evidenced by the fine crosshatch pattern seen in the character field.\n\nThe charm appears to be made of tin with, possibly, a silver wash.\n\nThe reverse side of the charm displays a number of auspicious symbols, some of which are difficult to identify.\n\nAt the top is a pair of interlocking diamond-shaped lozenges known as fang sheng (方胜). The origin of this symbol is still unclear but it may represent the form of an ancient musical instrument. Or, it may have been a head ornament worn in ancient times which symbolized victory. There is also a legend that the Queen Mother of the West wore such as object to exorcise evil spirits.\n\nMoving clockwise, the next symbol appears to be books tied with a ribbon or fillet possibly expressing the wish for sons to be successful in the imperial exams and obtaining an official government position.\n\nThe next symbol is a gourd also tied with a ribbon. The gourd is popular symbol to ward off evil spirits and disease because its first character (hulu 葫芦) has the same pronunciation as to “protect” or “guard” (hu 护), and also for “blessing” (hu 祜). (Please see Gourd Charms.)\n\nUnfortunately, corrosion obscures the symbols at the bottom and left of the square hole and these symbols remain unidentified.\n\nJust to the left of the lozenges is a flaming pearl which represents riches and wealth.\n\nThis charm has a diameter of 26 mm and a weight of 3.3 grams.\n\nLiao Dynasty\n\n(916-1125)\n\nAt the left is a fairly rare coin charm from the Liao Dynasty.\n\nAccording to historical records, Emperor Tai Zong (太宗) in the year 938 established the capital at Shang Jing (上京) and honored the event by casting commemorative coins with the auspicious inscription qian qiu wan sui (千秋万岁), which literally translates as a “thousand autumns and ten thousand years”, expressing the hope that the emperor and the dynasty would endure forever.\n\nMost of these commemorative coins were presented as gifts or awards. Some of the coins have also been found in the foundations of Liao Dynasty pagodas where they were presented as offerings by religious believers during the dedication of the religious buildings.\n\nThe reverse side displays an interesting set of three figures.\n\nAt the very top is a figure of a person kneeling with his right and left arms stretched out.\n\nTo the left of the square hole, and below the above figure’s right arm, is a person, perhaps a newborn child, bent forward and standing.\n\nTo the right of the hole, and below the top figure’s left arm, is a dragon.\n\nThis Liao Dynasty coin has a diameter of slightly greater than 25 mm and a weight of 6.8 grams.\n\nJin Dynasty\n\n(1115-1234)\n\nDuring the late Northern Song Dynasty, the Nuzhen (Jurchen, Jurched) (女真) nationality conquered most of north China and established their rule as the Jin Dynasty.\n\nAt first, they used coins of the Song and Liao dynasties but began to cast their own coinage in 1157.\n\nThe coin at the left, with the beautiful seal script calligraphy, has the inscription tai he zhong bao (泰和重宝).\n\nThe coin was cast during the years 1204-1209 of the reign of Emperor Zhang Zong (1190-1209) of the Jin Dynasty.\n\nThe diameter of the coin is 44.5 mm and the weight is 12.6 grams.\n\nThis is actually a charm based on the Jin Dynasty tai he zhong bao coin shown above.\n\nBecause tai he (泰和) can be variously translated as “peace and harmony” or “prosperity and harmony”, the coin became popular as a theme upon which to base charms and amulets.\n\nTai (泰) can also refer to tai shan (泰山), or Mt. T’ai, which is a famous and sacred mountain worshipped as a god.\n\nThe reverse side of the charm depicts two magpies with their long tail feathers. The magpie above the square hole is actually upside down. Its head is looking down and back to the right.\n\nThe magpie at the bottom has its head at the four o’clock position and is looking up and to left.\n\nThe two magpies are therefore looking directly at each other.\n\nThe magpie (xi que 喜鹊) symbolizes “happiness” because the first character xi is the same as the word “happy” (xi 喜). Two magpies facing each other therefore represents “double happiness” (shuang xi 喜喜) and is a symbol of a happy marriage.\n\nThe reference to a happy marriage is based on the legend of two heavenly lovers, the Cowherd (Oxherd) and the Weaver Girl (Maiden), who are permitted to meet each other only once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month (known as qixi 七夕, the Double Seven, or Sisters Festival) by crossing a celestial river (the Milky Way) on a bridge made of magpies.\n\nAlso, a magpie shown upside down, as is the case here, means that happiness has “arrived” because the Chinese words for “upside down” (倒) and “arrived” (到) are both pronounced dao.\n\nLocated between the two magpies are plum branches. In Chinese, one can say “there is a happy bird (magpie) on the tip of the plum branch” as xi shang mei shao (喜上梅稍). This sounds exactly the same as saying xi shang mei shao (喜上眉稍), meaning “happiness up to one’s eyebrows”, which is a Chinese expression for “very happy”.\n\nThis charm has a diameter of 41 mm and a weight of 18.8 grams.\n\nThis is the obverse side of another charm based on the famous tai he zhong bao (泰和重宝) coin of the Jin Dynasty.\n\nThe reverse side of the charm has four lines radiating outward from the corners of the square hole and extending to the rim.\n\nThe Chinese refer to this characteristic as si chu (四出). Si (四) means “four” and chu (出) means “going out”.\n\nThe implied meaning is that peace, prosperity and harmony should radiate in all directions.\n\nThe charm has a diameter of 41 mm and a weight of 22.3 grams.\n\nMing Dynasty\n\n(1368-1644)\n\nThis coin was cast during the reign of the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty.\n\nThe inscription is hong wu tong bao (洪武通宝) and was cast during the Hong Wu reign of Emperor Tai Zu (1368-1398).\n\nYou will notice that the hole is not in the usual shape of a four-sided square. This particular specimen has an auspicious eight-sided hole known as a “flower” or “rosette” hole.\n\n“Flower hole” coins were fairly common during the Northern Song and early Southern Song Dynasties but became very rare by the time of the Ming Dynasty.\n\nA detailed discussion of these types of coins including many examples can be seen at Chinese Coins with Flower Holes.\n\nThis is a Chinese charm, modeled after the above Ming Dynasty coin, with the same inscription hong wu tong bao (洪武通宝).\n\nThe reverse side of the charm shows a boy riding an ox or water buffalo.\n\nIn this case, the “boy” is actually Emperor Tai Zu.\n\nEmperor Tai Zu had a very humble early life and for a time was a shepherd boy.\n\nYou will notice that the boy is playing a flute which has the connotation of a care free life.\n\nThe flute is an old Daoist (Taoist) symbol which is associated with the Daoist Immortal Lan Caihe (蓝采和).\n\nThe flute is also an ancient Buddhist symbol used in meditation and is displayed on this charm to allude to the time when Emperor Tai Zu lived in a Buddhist monastery.\n\nThis type of charm became popular with the Chinese people because it represented the hope that a person could become successful despite being born into a peasant family.\n\nAnother hong wu tong bao charm which displays a number of symbols referring to Emperor Tai Zu’s life is discussed in detail at Buddhist Charms.\n\nThis charm has a diameter of 43 mm and a weight of 29.2 grams.\n\nThe inscription (legend) on this charm is zheng de tong bao (正德通宝).\n\nZheng De was the reign title (1505 – 1521 AD) of the Ming Dynasty Emperor Wu Zong. While some claim that the government did cast a very small number of coins with this inscription, it is generally believed that no coins meant for circulation were ever cast by the government using the reign title zheng de.\n\nEven though no legal tender coins were cast during this period, a fairly large number of charms with this inscription exist. The reason is that zheng de has the auspicious meaning in Chinese of “correct virtue”, so the inscription translates as “currency of correct virtue”.\n\nMany Chinese of the time also believed that Emperor Wu Zong was the reincarnation of a real dragon.\n\nAncient Chinese folklore says that zheng de was a “swimming” dragon. The belief is that wearing a zheng de charm when you cross a river or sea will protect you from the danger of large waves.\n\nThe Chinese also love to gamble and there is an old Chinese superstition that says carrying a zheng de charm will bring you good luck at gambling.\n\nIt was believed that if a pregnant woman carried a zheng de charm in her hand both she and her child would be protected.\n\nZheng de charms were also given to children as a form of good luck money (yasuiqian 压岁钱) during the lunar New Year.\n\nThe zheng de charms were considered so lucky that there was this popular saying:\n\n家有正德钱富贵万万年\n\n(jia you zheng de qian fu gui wan wan nian)\n\n“If a family has a zheng de coin, there will be riches and honor for ten thousand years”\n\nIt is a common theme with zheng de charms to have a dragon and phoenix.\n\nThe reverse side of this charm shows a wide-eyed dragon on the right with its head at the five o’clock position. A lovely phoenix is on the left of the square hole with its head at the six o’clock position.\n\nThe dragon and phoenix paired together represent the ultimate union of a man and a woman. Additional information on this subject can be found at Chinese Marriage Charms.\n\nThe charm has a diameter of 45 mm and weighs 14.5 grams.\n\nThis is another example of a very well-made zheng de tong bao (正德通宝) that would typically have been used as a marriage charm.\n\nThe reverse side of the charm displays a very ornate and finely detailed dragon on the right with its head at the two o’clock position.\n\nAn equally detailed phoenix is at the left of the center hole with its head at the eight o’clock position.\n\nThis is a large and heavy charm.\n\nThe diameter is 54 mm and the weight is 42.3 grams.\n\nThis is another example of a charm with the Chinese coin inscription zheng de tong bao (正德通宝).\n\nThe very broad outer rim displays a dragon on the left and a phoenix on the right.\n\nThe circular objects at the 12 o’clock and 6 o’clock positions are pearls.\n\nThe reverse side also has a very broad outer rim with the single Chinese character wen (文) above the square hole.\n\nWen (文) is the measure word used for counting Chinese cash coins.\n\nIt is interesting that this same character wen (文) can also mean the obverse side of a coin even though here it is displayed on the reverse side.\n\nThe diameter of this charm is 31.3 mm and the weight is 8.3 grams.\n\nCoins were cast with the reign title Wan Li (万历) of Emperor Shen Zong during the years 1573-1620 of the Ming Dynasty.\n\nAt the left is a coin with the inscription wan li tong bao (万历通宝).\n\nWhat is unusual about this coin is that there are four dots, with one dot between each of the Chinese characters.\n\nExperts seem to be divided as to whether this is an official coin or a charm.\n\nThe character wan (万) means “ten thousand” and the character li (历) means “era” or “calendar”. The four dots are generally believed to represent stars (xing 星) or suns (ri 日). The implied meaning is, therefore, light and brightness forever.\n\nThe reverse side of this coin or charm is blank although it has the same broad outer rim as that on the obverse.\n\nThe coin has a diameter of 24 mm and a weight of 3.4 grams.\n\nQing (Ch’ing) Dynasty\n\n(1644-1911)\n\nThis coin is a qian long tong bao (乾隆通宝) presumably cast during the 60 year reign (1736-1795) of Qing (Ch’ing) Dynasty Emperor Gao Zong.\n\nThe coin is very large and heavy. In fact, it is much larger and heavier than any other qian long tong bao variety of coin with which I am familiar.\n\nAlso, the characters, such as the bottom portion of the bao (宝) and the radical portion of the tong (通), are written in a slightly different style from that of the other coins of this emperor.\n\nThe coin, however, is clearly old.\n\nBecause of its size, calligraphy and age, I have concluded that this “coin” is most probably a “charm”.\n\nThe reverse side reveals another interesting feature.\n\nThe Manchu characters indicate that the piece was cast at the Board of Revenue in Peking (Beijing).\n\nHowever, the characters are rotated 90 degrees clockwise and the characters themselves are very large.\n\nThe intention may have been political but the meaning remains unclear.\n\nThe charm has a diameter of almost 56 mm and a thickness of just over 3 mm.\n\nIn 1861, a few specimen coins for the reign title Qixiang were cast with the inscription qi xiang zhong bao (祺祥重宝).\n\nThe coin at the left is either one of these authentic pieces or an excellent copy. If it is indeed a copy, then it is clearly a very old one.\n\nBesides its rarity, coins or charms with the inscription qi xiang are considered auspicious because qi xiang (祺祥) means “lucky” or “of good omen”.\n\nThe top and bottom characters on the reverse side of this coin/charm are dang shi (当十) which translates as “Value Ten” and means that this coin was worth the equivalent of 10 cash coins.\n\nThe Manchu characters to the right and left of the square hole indicate that the coin was cast at the Board of Works in Peking (Beijing).\n\nThis coin/charm has a diameter of 35 mm and weight of 13.6 grams.\n\nThe charm to the left is quite small and shows considerable wear.\n\nThe inscription is guang xu tong bao (光绪通宝) and the obverse side looks exactly like a typical Qing (Ch’ing) Dynasty coin of Emperor De Zong (1875 – 1908 AD).\n\nThe reverse side reveals that it is actually a charm with the inscription read top to bottom and right to left as ding cai gui shou (丁财贵寿).\n\nThe translation is “May you acquire wealth, honor (high rank) and longevity”.\n\nThe charm is only 19.5 mm in diameter and weighs 4.7 grams.\n\nThe coinage of early China is not well understood, although things have improved signficantly in recent years. This e-book puts forward our observations and ideas that have evolved over time from many different sources, combining them with ideas put forward by other numismatists. Some of our theories will almost certainly eventually be proven wrong and will have to be revised (some already have been), and it is our hope to keep moving forward towards a genuine understanding of this complex series. We will be happy to hear from anyone who wishes to express their opinions on this subject, or can provide us with information that we are not aware of.\n\nWHAT QUALIFIES AS A TRUE COIN\n\nA true coin, as compared to a primitive money, must meet three criteria. First, it must bear the mark of the issuing authority. Secondly, it must contain an intrinsic value bearing some relationship to the circulating value, and while that intrinsic value can be less than the circulating value if it falls too far below the item becomes a token rather than a coin. The third it must have an understood denomination so that it need not be weighed at every transaction, otherwise it is only a bullion item.\n\nANCIENT RECORDS\n\nOfficial ancient records are of little help in this series, as few survived\n\nthe Ch’in Dynasty’s attempt (ca. 221 BC)\n\nto erase earlier history which included earlier writings.\n\nSome records have survived are inscriptions on\n\nbronze ritual vessels\n\nindicating how they were paid for thus giving glimpses into the monetary system of the time, but in most cases the readings are subject to several interpretations with their true meanings uncertain.\n\nMany books and articles about ancient Chinese coins have been published, but there is little agreement between them. It is likely no one researcher has the full truth, but reading them is still useful. Until recently\n\nEARLY CHINESE COINAGE by WANG YU-CH’UAN (ANS Numismatic notes & Monographs #122, 1951, republished by Durst in 1980) was probably the most useful, but\n\nCAST CHINESE COINS by David Hartill (Trafford Publishing, 2005) was far surpassed it and we highly recommend it to anyone that wants far more detail on this series than we intend to provide on this e-book\n\nMODERN ARCHEOLOGY\n\nModern archeology is in its infancy in China, but rapidly improving. It provides significant new information on where the coins are found, and thus presumed to have been minted. But as yet there have not been enough documented excavations containing these types of coins, which can be accurately dated so as to help define the dates of the coins (usually the coins date the excavation). This is is changing and one day we will be able to define the dates of the various types more closely.\n\nRead more\n\nGreat Leap Forward era backyard iron furnaces have been unearthed [via] and there is discussion about whether to preserve them as historical evidence, even a cultural heritage. The site is described thus\n\nThe backyard furnaces are located on the south slope of a hillside within\n\nthe borders of Heiyaodong Village in Baiyin Mongolian Township,\n\nSunan Yugur Autonomous County.\n\nThey are situated in an east-west line and number 159 furnaces in total, most of which have crumbled. About fifty are still largely intact. The largest is 8 meters high and 14 meters in circumference; the smallest is 2.5 meters high and 2.7 meters around. Most are pagoda-shaped, with one or more chimneys. Their insides are lined with clay bricks. Some of the larger furnaces are dug into the hillside and have one or more arched entrances for feeding raw material, lighting the fire, or cleaning out slag, and multiple air vents are set into the floor. Some are made up of ten individual furnaces joined together. The whole group extends for a more than two kilometer s, making for an impressive sight.\n\nThe furnaces were built in 1958 during the Great Leap Forward and ceased operating in 1960. Some of them were never put to use.\n\nThat last line captures what is, for me anyway, the essence of the GLF: an immense waste of effort, resources, lives. Wu Zuolai of the journal Theory and Criticism of Art and Literature writes:\n\nPeople who experienced that time recall that whole forests were cut down to make charcoal to burn, bringing immense disaster to the environment. And because some areas were unable to produce acceptable steel, the people had to break apart their cooking pots and melt them down in the furnaces, and as a result, unusable lumps of iron were all that was produced. One unforeseen consequence was that real cultural heritage was plundered during the steel production campaign. The two-storey tower at\n\nthe famous Hangu Pass* was torn down,\n\nand inscriptions accumulated over the course of two thousand years were destroyed.\n\nWuwei County,* Gansu, was an important\n\nnorthwestern garrison in the Tang Dynasty, and its city wall, built of large bricks, towered for a thousand years. But those thousand-year-old bricks became part of the furnaces.\n\n…\n\nThe past has become a memory and a historical lesson. But has the mentality of the Great Leap Forward been entirely eradicated? Faced with this massive cluster of iron smelters, we have much to reflect upon. Public, scientific, and democratic decision making must not be merely empty words but must be put into practice in every project.\n\nWu goes on to suggest a “small museum” on the site, and an oral history and records collecting project. Given that this is one of the landmark events of modern Chinese history, I would hope for that much, or more. But given that this is one of the landmark events in the failure of Maoist policy and rapid modernization, I have my doubts.\n\nCALLIGRAPHY\n\nCalligraphy forms evolved rapidly during the Zhou period, but many coins bear archaic calligraphy forms long out of fashion by the time the coins were cast. The same character can appear on two related issues in almost unrelated (to western eyes) forms, and in many cases these archaic characters cannot be translated with absolute certainty. Calligraphy style should be viewed as somewhat unreliable as a technique for dating the coins, and not used to override other evidence.\n\nRead more\n\nHistory of Chinese Calligraphy\n\nSince the creation of Chinese words in ancient times, Chinese calligraphy has existed in a rich myriad of scripts, many of which are still being practised today. The following is a brief introduction to the evolution of the different types of scripts through the history of the Chinese civilisation.\n\nBefore the invention of paper, Chinese characters were recorded as engravings on different types of surfaces.\n\nThe earliest recognized form of Chinese characters, known as Jiaguwen (甲骨文) or the Oracle Bone script, dated to\n\nthe Xia-Shang Dynasties era (1700 B.C.).\n\nThe characters were found engraved on tortoise plastrons and animal bones (typically ox spatulas) which were mostly used for divination purposes in the imperial courts, hence its name.\n\nXia Dynasty (2200-1700 B.C.) and the Legendary Yellow Emperor of China\n\nEmperor Shun The Xia (Hsia) dynasty began when Shun abdicated in favor of Emperor Yu,the legendary Yellow Emperor of China, from whom all other Chinese are believed to have descended. Venerated as the first emperor of China, Yu had thousands of concubines because he believed the more sex partners he had the longer he would live. He reputedly became immortal after he made love to a thousand young virgins. Yao, another mythical emperor who followed Yu, was famous for his benevolent rule and lifestyle of a simple farmer.\n\nThe oldest bronze vessels date back to the Xia dynasty. According to legend bronze was first cast 5,000 years ago by the Yellow Emperor, who cast nine bronze tripods to symbolize the nine provinces in his empire. Bronze metallurgy in China dates back to 2000 B.C., significantly later than in southeastern Europe, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, where it developed around 3600 B.C. to 3000 B.C.\n\nChinese astronomers in the Xia era were among the first to chart constellations and record supernovas. In 2296 B.C., Chinese astronomers observed a comet. They also developed a system of observation based on the equator and the poles that was not adopted by Europe until 4000 years later.\n\nFor a long time it was thought the Xia dynasty was legendary but in the last couple of decades evidence has surfaced that it really existed. A site near Erlitou in Henan Province dated to 2200 to 1700 B.C. is believed to have been a Xia capital. Archaeologists working there have found tombs filled with pottery, ornamental jade, clay irrigation pipes, and the world’s oldest ritual bronze vessels.\n\nXia Dynasty Archaeological Sites\n\nDescribed by some as a Xia dynasty Tomb but actually from a A.D. 10th century Xia dynasty The Erlitou site near Yanshi city in Henan Province is thought by some historians and archeologists to have been the capital of the Xia dynasty. Excavations there have revealed palace building and tombs containing musical instruments and bronzes.\n\nOne of the most important finds from Erlitou is the Bronze Ornamental Plaque , a cast bronze and turquoise inlay that was unearthed in a tomb dated to 17th or 16th century B.C. Now housed in the Luoyang Museum, it features a foxlike animals that is thought to be a representation of a deity. Some speculate may have been worn as a breast plate and a symbol of divine authority.\n\nImportant Xia, Shang and Zhou archaeological sites include the newly-discovered Shang city ruins at Yanshi and Huanbei; the excavations of the Erlitou, Yinxu and Fenghao sites; new breakthrough discoveries at the cemeteries at the Liulihe site in Beijing, Qianzhangda in Tengzhou and Dadianzi in Inner Mongolia. Excavations at Shang and Zhou imperial cities such as the Yinxu ruins in Anyang, the Changan and Fenghao ruins in modern-day Xian, and the Eastern Zhou capital Wangcheng in Luoyang, which have helped archaeologists establish a chronology for the Xia, Shang and Zhou Dynasties.\n\nCredit: http://baike.soso.com/v31430.htm\n\nWith the advent of the Bronze Age in the Zhou Dynasty (ca. 1046–256 B.C.), a more refined form of engraved script evolved from Jiaguwen. Known as Jinwen (金文) or the Bronzeware script, this type of script was found on cast bronze vessels. The Jinwen script boasted rounder strokes, unlike that of Jiaguwen which were long and narrow in form, and had sharp edges. The stylistic difference between the two scripts was attributed to the finer and smoother bronzeware surface (as compared to animal bones). Furthermore, given that the bronze vessels from this period were largely used for ceremonial and ritual purposes, more efforts were also put into embellishing the Chinese characters.\n\nCredit: http://blog1.poco.cn/myBlogDetail-htx-id-4964841-userid-55616776-pri–n-0.xhtml\n\nDuring this same period,\n\nanother form of script, Dazhuan (大篆) or the Greater Seal script, coexisted with Jinwen. In fact, both Jinwen and Dazhuan are often regarded as sub-branches of each other since the two forms of characters overlapped.\n\nIn the early stages of Chinese civilization up till the Warring States period, different states and kingdoms had their own forms of Chinese characters. It was not until\n\nthe Qin Dynasty (221 – 206 B.C.) when the Chinese empire was unified by\n\nEmperor Qin Shihuangdi t\n\nhat Chinese characters were standardized. Pursuant to this development, a more elegant script, known as\n\nXiaozhuan (小篆) or the Lesser Seal script, was derived. This script is recognized as the origin of the modern, unsimplified Chinese script which we see in use today in places such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia. Compared to the earlier scripts, Xiaozhuan characters are more stylized and less “pictographic”. In fact, it is from Xiaozhuan script that Chinese characters start exhibiting the systematic and extensive use of radicals.\n\nCredit: http://www.cc5000.com/zhishi/shufa/keshi.htm\n\nHowever, the Xiaozhuan script was considered complex and cumbersome. As a result,\n\nLishu (隶书) or the Scribe script, was created.\n\nAs the name suggests,\n\nthis script was used by the court mandarins. Its origin could be traced to the period of\n\nlate Qin and\n\nearly Han Dynasties (206 B.C. – 220 A.D.) when court officials needed a fast and efficient script to record and process state matters.\n\nThe marked difference between this script and Xiaozhuan is that Lishu characters have less strokes and boast a more flowing style, and are therefore easily adaptable to calligraphy brushes. In addition, Chinese characters were further standardized under the Lishu script to remove regional variations, and these characters are for the most part the same ones written today. Hence, it is widely acknowledged that the Lishu script laid the foundation for present-day Chinese writing.\n\nAfter the Lishu script, the evolution of Chinese calligraphy took on a cursive trend.\n\nCaoshu (草书) or the Cursive script first appeared in the latter part of the Han era when calligraphers began to inject artistic styles into their writing. Typically, the shape of the Chinese characters in the cursive script do not resemble the corresponding standard Lishu character as some strokes are either being merged or simply omitted.\n\nCredit: http://chinese.qilu18.com/XDHY/03/12.htm\n\nKaishu (楷书) or the Formal script emerged at around the same time as Caoshu. While very similar to Lishu, Kaishu contains serif-like (hook- or anchor-like) elements at the turn and end of each stroke. This form of writing was being continually refined and standardized until the mid-Tang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.) when a uniform script was agreed upon.\n\nCredit: http://www.szlnzx.com/edu/2010/4/20090602165457340.shtml\n\nMeanwhile, also at the latter part of the Han Dynasty, a more cursive variant of Kaishu, known as Xingshu (行书) or the Running script, also took shape. Again, several strokes, especially sequential dots, are being merged, or two perpendicular strokes deliberately curved up. Given its relatively simple and fast execution, Xingshu easily became the most popular script in use during its time.\n\nCredit: http://www.wenhuacn.com/shufa/article.asp?classid=36&articleid=6886\n\nPicking up Chinese Calligraphy\n\nAll newcomers to Chinese calligraphy are initiated through the basic brushstrokes in the formal and neat style of Kaishu. The beginner learns by imitation through a template of strokes called tie, usually a reproduction of a manuscript by a renowned ancient calligrapher. As the learner tries to reproduce each line and dot that forms each character, he is forced to examine and appreciate the proper way of writing and placing each stroke in the character.\n\nCredit: http://www.997788.com/22304/search/155/6379641/\n\nNotably, there is no fixed way of writing any character as the style and form would depend on the period of origin of the template. For instance, if the learner picks up a Kaishu tie from the Tang Dynasty, the style which he learns will be more regimented than say, that from the Song Dynasty. As one progresses in the mastery of Chinese calligraphy, one may choose to branch into practicing the other more demanding or stylistic scripts such Xingshu or Caoshu. And with confidence and practice, the learner can also try to inject personal styles into the writing.\n\nAppreciating Chinese Calligraphy\n\nWhile there is no fixed set of rules or standards by which to judge or define beauty in Chinese calligraphy, enthusiasts usually refer to the following general points in their appreciation of calligraphy masterpieces. A good calligraphy work would display a sublime balance of strength and gentleness behind the different strokes and the appropriate amount of ink used for each character. Furthermore, the placement and alignment of each character across the piece of paper, thus making up the visual composition of the artwork, is just as important a factor in defining a masterpiece.\n\nJiaguwen\n\nCLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS\n\nUnderstanding coinage of this period is almost impossible using the traditional classification systems with knife, spade, cowry imitation, and early round coins under the single heading of the Zhou Dynasty and thus giving the impression of a single complex currency system. Zhou was just the most powerful of several large states that existed side by side, each of which was responsible for a different type of coinage. Since we began building this website in 1997, more information about this has come to light and we are in the process of adding that information and restructuring the site to better show how the system worked.\n\nWEIGHT STANDARDS\n\nAncient Chinese coins appear to have been issued at weights based on multiples of the shu. Dr. Woo has recently brought to our attention a group of Zhou Dynasty bronze weights on which the official weight of a shu was 0.65 grams, with 24 shu to a Liang of 15.6 grams. However, these are trade weights used to weight out goods to those standards, and when it comes to coins they do not translate directly to the expected weights of coins cast to related denominations.\n\nMany Zhou period coins have characters indicating denominations Liangs, but when we weigh the coins they seen to average about 0.5 grams per shu (see Wang, Early Chinese Coins, pages 138-139) which is only about 77% of the official weight of a shu. This shows a seniorage system similar that to used in medieval Europe, where coins are made to a weight below their circulating value, with the profit made from the difference used to off-set the cost of minting, and sometimes show a small profit to the minting authority. So with respect to coins, a shu is roughly 0.5 grams and a Liang 12 grams.\n\nThe casting techniques used to mint Chinese coins did not allow exact weight control of individual coins, so the ancient mint masters were concerned with average weight of a large numbers of coins rather than the exact weight of each individual coin. To determine the intended weight standard of a particular series of coins one must average the weights a large numbers of specimens. We have noted certain trends within the standards of various types of coins, and at this point we believe the system can be summarized as follows :\n\nSpades Coins are denominated in multiples of 6 shu with issues 72 shu or 3 Liang (36 grams), 48 shu or 2 Liang (24 grams), 24 shu or 1 Liang (12 grams) and 12 shu or 1/2 Liang (6 grams). Not all types were issued in all denominations but the denominations for each type will be discussed further down).\n\nKnife Coins are denominated in a system based on multiples of 10 shu although the main denomination for thin knifes as 30 shu (about 15 grams). We have not yet examined enough of the Heavy Knifes of the State of Chi to work out there intended denominations, but will work on that later.\n\nEarly round coins With round holes seem to follow the knife money system based on multiples of 10 shu with most issued at 20 shu (10 grams).\n\nCowry imitation coins do not appear to have any typical weight standard, as the weights on them can very considerably. They were probably denominated as equivalent in value of an actual cowry shell, regardless of weight, but this is by no means certain.\n\nDENOMINATION NAMES\n\nSpade money had a variety of denominations, often multiple denominations circulated side by side, so we see some types with denominations names on them. While the weight standard is based on the Shu and the Liang, on the coins we see two names for this unit. Some do say “Liang” on them, but others have the character for “Jin” on them. It is important to understand that a JIN” is equivalent to a “LIANG”, and the only difference is in which term was used on what types.\n\nAs yet we have not determined a name for the intended denomination of Knife money, as none of them seem to have denomination marks on them. As there is appears to be only one denomination for them, there was no need to indicated it on them.\n\nRound coins are much more complicated, because it depends on where they are from. Some were issued in spade issuing areas and are denominated in “Liang” or “Jin” just as the spades were. Others were issued in Knife issuing areas and like the knifes do not have a denomination indicated, although some have the character “HUA” which I believe simply means “money”. This is something that needs a lot more research.\n\nMONETARY UNITS vs. WEIGHTS\n\nThe earlier coins were cast to weight standards in a direct relationship with the denominations, so if you weighted a coin at 12 grams it was almost certain a 1 Liang (or 1 Jin) denomination. During the Chin Dynasty, sometime around 250 BC, this changed and be begin to see coins issued with denomination marks that bare no relationship to the actual weight of the coin. This is best seen on the Ban liang (1/2 Liang) coins of the State of Chin which can vary in weight considerably but the earliest large diameter issues weigh at least 6 grams (and often significantly more), but the size and weight gradually declined and by the time they were last issued in the Han Dynasty are often seen at 3 grams or even less, but still with the Ban Liang denomination on them.\n\nIf the reader has not already done so, we recommend reading our comments above in order to understand a little about how this series of coins function as monetary units, before proceeding with this section.\n\n“Zhou Dynasty” is the usual name for this period during which the early Chinese coins were made. It is technically accurate but does not best describe the political situation in China at the time, as China was composed a of independent feudal states which was also each it’s own Dynasty, which were loosely affiliated with the State of Zhou acting as a central hub of government. When the Zhou conquered Shang in about 1122 BC, they were very powerful and did ruled over the other states, but by 7th and 6th centuries BC Zhou had lost most of it’s real power and it’s position as the central hub of government was more as a figure head, with no genuine power over the others. Real power was split between the other feudal states, who were often at war with each other which is why this later Zhou period is also known as the period of the Warring States. This the period during which Chinese coinage first developed.\n\nSome of these Warring States appear to have retained minting authority in their central governments, while others appear to have relegated it to the local level of cities or even clans. To some extend we can now sort to many of the major coin types as to which state issued it, although many issues remain uncertain. We are now in the process of re-organizing this page to better reflect this organization of the coins, and will continue to work on that as more information comes available. As this re-organization is not yet complete, some of what follows will seem more confusing than it will when we are finished.\n\nThe currency of the Zhou Dynasty can be divided into three basic periods.\n\nThe first, which will not be discussed in any significant detail on this list, is the pre-coinage period when various types of primitive money were used before coins were invented. Primitive money simply means objects used as mediums of exchange, which are not true coins. These can include things like farm tools (knifes, spades, etc), shells (cowry shells were popular for this) and things like bolts of cloth. Since use of coins begins in different parts of China at different times, there is no clear date as to when this ends, and to complicate things there is good evidence that coins did not totally displace primitive moneys as a medium of exchange until at least into the Han Dynasty period. In his work on early Chinese coinage, Wang Yu-Ch’uan discusses evidence of cowry shells as a form of currency as early as the late Shang Dynasty, and the exchange tables of Wang Mang in the early 1st century AD including many types of primitive money’s including things like tortoise shells.\n\nThe second period is a period of independent coinage, where each of the major states that made coins had a fairly unique form to them. Wang (per his map on page 254 of Early Chinese Coinage) maintains originated in different parts of China with spade money in the Shantung Peninsula and south of the Yellow River Valley, Knife money in the Yellow River Valley, and Cowry imitation money just north of the Yangtze river. His evidence for this appears to be generally sound, although his dating probably in-accurate, and things were more complex than that as the Spades and Knife money areas can be further subdivided into specific shapes of knifes and spades issued by specific states, which will be discussed in more detail below. This period probably starts in the 6th or 7th century BC, but not in all places at once. It was a gradual process to begin with, but ended much more abruptly some time in the 4th century BC.\n\nThe third is one of coinage unification, which appears to have happened some time around the middle of the 4th century BC. During this period, most of the spade making regions gave up their distinctive spade forms, and adopted minor variations of the thing 1/2 and 1 Jin flat foot spades. The knife making regions adopted minor variations on the “ming” knife forms. This is also the period during which the first round coins appear. These changes probably allowed for wider circulation of coinage, with coins from different states and cities being able to move freely through other regions where similar coins were being made and used. This period only ends when the Zhou dynast comes to an end around 255 BC.\n\nTHE PERIOD OF INDEPENDANT COINAGE.\n\nCOWRY AND COWRY IMITATION COINS OF THE STATE OF CHU.\n\nBy the Shang Dynasty and continuing into the Zhou Dynasty, actual cowry shells were used as a form of money but they fall more into the catagory of “primative money” than true coins. Their use far pre-dates the first true coins as shown by Wang on pages 64 and 65 of his book “Early Chinese Coinage” where he describes a bronze Tsun vessel bearing the inscription :\n\n“LORD OF CHU, YUAN, HAD THIS PRECIOUS VESSEL MADE. HE USED FOURTEEN P’ENG OF COWRIES”. While this tells us cowry shells could be grouped together in a denomination known as a P’ENG and used to pay for things, the number or weight of cowries in a p’eng is not known. Further evidence indicating cowry shells were still a form of money in the first century AD can be seen where Wang Mang (AD 7-22) included cowry shells on his list of exchange rates between various currency objects.\n\nAt some uncertain date, but probably early in the Zhou Dynasty period, carving imitations of cowry shells appear in various materials including bone, shell, and stone. There are also molding imitations of clay and bronze. It is likely cowry imitations arose from a shortage of actual shells, and may have been made and used over a long period of time. At this point, it does not appear to be possible to date them exactly.\n\nBone cowry imitations are commonly found stained green from burial with bronze, but I have not found any records of such excavated cowries that would tell us if this results from burial along side bronze coins, or possibly inside of bronze vessels, but I suspect burial in bronze vessels is the more likely explanation.\n\nIn the region between the Yellow and Yangtze rivers in the territory of the State of Chu, cowry imitations became even more stylized being cast in bronze with inscriptions that probably indicate an issuing authority. At that point they transform from a form of primitive money to a true coins.\n\nThese coins are commonly called “Ant-nose money” which derives from looking at these two common types together where the JIN (or BEI) appears to be a face with a prominent “NOSE”, and the bottom of the “Ge Liu Zhu” resembles an ant.\n\nThere are at least seven distinct types of these inscribed cowry imitation coins, but only the two above are common. Two others are scarce, and the remaining three rare to extremely rare. We will provide illustrations of other types should they become available. The dating of this series is as yet uncertain, but it is possible one of the types in this series were the first true coins of early China.\n\nThe State of Chu did not issue any larger bronze coins during this period, but did issue some very unusual gold coins in the form of square or round inscriptions stamped into 3 to 5 mm thick sheets of gold, which name various cities in the state of Chu. I have not yet owned one of these to image for this site, and there is very little actually known about when they were issued and how they were used.\n\nHOLLOW HANDLED SPADES OF THE STATE OF ZHOU\n\nThe hollow handled spades of the Royal State of Zhou were probably the first true coins issued in China, at a time when Zhou was still the most powerful of the Warring states and formed the central government that controlled the other states during the Spring and Autumn period in the 6th and possibly 7th century BC. They are very close in form to the true spades used as primitive money slightly earlier, with a very shallow arch at the bottom and thus short pointed feet.\n\nThe date at which these first appear is very much in dispute. Wang mentions bronze vessels dating much earlier than 600 BC (possibly as early as 1000 BC) with dedications referring them having been paid for with “PU”, so he believed the first spade coins came for that very early date. The problem is “PU” is also the name for bolts of cloth which were probably and early form of primitive money in China, those dedications probably describe those vessels having been paid with bolts of cloth. The use of “PU” for the spades probably means the early large spades represented a value equal to a bolt of cloth, although this is by no means certain. “PU” later came to be a generic name for spade money.\n\nSpades similar to the above, with many variations in character or characters on them, were probably issued for the origins of spade money under Zhou in the 6th or 7th century BC, down to the 5th century BC, with the inscriptions becoming more complex inscriptions as you move up in time.\n\nThe Shanghai Encyclopedia lists about 500 variations of hollow handles spades (including both the States of Zhou and Zhao issues). While some of the inscriptions appear to be mint names, 500 is many times the number of potential minting authorities, and most are probably series marks within a limited number of mints. A few seem to be denomination marks, but most were probably codes to indicate indicated mints, mint masters, dates, or a combination of such things. The key to their meaning is probably lost forever. For a much more in depth discussion of these inscriptions in English, it would be best to refer to the book “Cast Coins of China” by David Hartill.\n\nWhile the state of Zhou was powerful early on and issued a wide variety of these hollow handled spades (most of which are individually very rare types), they lost most of their power during this period, and it appears they may have stopped issuing coins in any sigificant numbers by the middle of the Warring States period, just as some of the other Warring state began to issue coins in large numbers and a wide variety of types.\n\nPOINTED FOOT SPADES OF STATE OF JIN AND ZHAO\n\nThe central but most northerly part of the Yellow River region was controlled by the State of Jin which later become the State of Zhao. We do not yet know the date at which this change occurred, and while it is certain the later coins of this region were issued by the State of Zhao, the earliest issues may have been under the state of Jin.\n\nThe earliest coins of this region were hollow handle spades somewhat similar to those of the State of Zhou, but with much longer, more pointed feet. These are probably contemporary with with the hollow handled spades the State of Zhou, most likely dating to either the middle or later part of that period. I suspect they are ca. 450 to 400 BC, and while this is by no means certain, an earlier date would require a large time gap between these and the later flat pointed foot spades, and that seems un-likely. Most examples of this type have no marks indicating an issuing authority, suggesting more a form a primitive money than a true coin, but a large hoard found in 1995 (see Hartill page 17) contained many examples with marks and those are true coins.\n\nThe very long pointed feet, combined with the weakness at the attachment of the handle, make these very fragile. Their large size also would have made them somewhat impractical to carry around and use in general circulation. Most likely they were used for very specific purposes or large transactions, with general commerce still via the barter system. Probably by the end of the 5th century BC, and certainly by the mid-fourth century BC the State of Zhao redesigned it’s coins to the more practical flat pointed foot spades listed below.\n\nThere are two denominations commonly seen for the flat pointed foot spades, with the 1/2 Jin (ca. 6 grams) being far more common than the 1 Jin (ca. 12 grams) examples. The 1 jin examples are also far larger than the 1/2 jin, making the denominations easy to tell a part.\n\nThere is a wide variety of these, and they are fairly common showing they were issued in fairly large numbers over a significant period of time. This is probably the time during which coins came into much more common use as a medium of exchange in general commerce, although it is very likely the barter system was still in wide spread use as well.\n\nHartill dates these to ca. 350 to 250 BC, which is contemporary with the thin square foot spades that we list further below under the heading of “THE PERIOD OF UNIFIED COINAGE”. A problem I see with this, is that these coin are very specific to the State of Zhao (earlier called the State of Jin) and do not seem to belong under that heading. Since Zhao issued many types of thin square foot spades in that period, I believe these flat pointed foot spades probably begin when Zhao stops issueing hollow handled spades some time around 400 BC, and end ever Zhao begain to issue square foot spades some time after 350 BC (they are sometimes found with square foot spades, but that does not mean they were not minted at an earlier period and just still circulating). Perhaps one day these dates can be narrowed down a little closer.\n\nHEAVY FLAT SPADES OF THE STATE OF LIANG (Wei)\n\nAround 400 BC flat spades revolutionized the spade currency. Unlike the hollow-handled spades which required a complex multi-piece mold with a casting core in the handle, the flat spades required only a simple two-piece mold, allowing for larger mintages in shorter periods of time. They were sturdy, easier to store and were cast in the three denominations of 1/2, 1 and 2 “jin”, making them very suitable for use in everyday transactions. Most of the the early issues name the city of Anyi which was the State of Liang capital early in this period. The later issues usually name the city of Liang to which the capital of the stater of Liang was moved later in the period. There are some very scarce types which name other cities. The denomination can be expressed either directly in jin, or as fractions of the LI with 100 to the LI equal a Jin. This is probably the period when coins came into common use over a wide area of China. Early flat foot spades were called “CH’IEN, which later became a generic term for all types of money.\n\nThere are a variety of other heavy flat arched foot spades that seem to be from the State of Liang which name cities other than Anyi or Liang. Some have simple inscriptions that just name the city but not the denomination, which others also include marks of denomination. At this point these are not well understood and it is possibly some of them are from other states (some might be from the state of Han), or exactly how they fit into the chronology of this series.\n\nThe evolution of spade forms is complex with many types and many lines of development to follow. This part of this site will take a long time to develop and for now only the most common types are included.\n\nTHE PERIOD OF UNIFIED COINAGE.\n\nTHIN SQUARE FOOT SPADES\n\nIt appears that around 350 BC, and continuing down to the end of the Zhou period in 255 BC, the currency of China begins to unify in form, and we see thinner square foot spades appearing in an extensive series bearing a variety of mint names, showing very similar coins were made accross a number of the Warring States, with only minor variations in form. At this point we are making no attempt to sort them out into their particular states of issue, although we might attempt to do so at some future date.\n\nMost spades in this series weight between 5 and 7 grams, with some double unites in the 10 to 12 gram range, but the average is in the 6 gram range for the smaller examples and around 12 grams for the larger ones, showing they were issued with the intended denominations of 1/2 and 1 Jin. some large examples with sharp corners can weight as much as 14 gram, but it is not yet clear if they were intended to be 30 shu or if they are just heavier than average but intended at 24 shu (1 Jin).\n\nThese thin square foot spades with “ears” clearly belong to the same series as the coin below, but their exact relationship to the more common shape without “ears” is not yet certain. There are a few other types known with this configuration but different characters on them.\n\nThese thin square foot spades appear to come from a number of different mints, but very little variation in form and weight, which suggests a single central authority with the intent they could circulate freely between the different cities. We have noted that hoards often turn up with mixed types, which seems to support this theory.\n\nThe most likely central authority to have that much control would be the state of Ch’in, but only after they were well into the process of unifying China in the 3rd century BC. According to Schjoth, the Historical Records of Ssu-ma Chien state the city of An-yang received that name in the 50th year of Prince Chao Hsiang of Ch’in, which is 257 BC. An-yang spades are by far the most common type in this series, and if there were minted in that same An-yang (which is likely but not 100% certain) they have to be Ch’in period coins, possible providing us with a general time frame for the entire thin square foot spade series.\n\nWang (page 20) disputes this dating, indicating two cities named An-yang that pre-date 257 BC, suggesting these coins belong to one of those cities. Our current research has turned up only two other coins with the An-yang mint mark. The first is a round-shouldered round foot spade with three holes which Wang lists as a very late issue, and the second is a very rare heavy knife which Wang lists as a very early issue, but which we believe is actually a very late issue (note our discussion of heavy knifes below). If no further evidence for earlier coins of An-yang comes to light, and only coins of after 257 BC are known, we feel Schjoth’s interpretation is the more reasonable one.\n\nS-28-29, “CHAI-YANG”\n\nF $55.00 VF $75.00\n\nS-36-37, “HSIANG-YUAN”\n\nF $55.00 VF $75.00\n\nThe “KUAN” character also occurs on a pointed rounded-back knife (reference Shanghai Encyclopedia #2793 and 2794) indicating a possible connection between the two series.\n\nSMALL SQUARE FOOT SPADES\n\nLONG SQUARE FOOT SPADES\n\nThese spade coins appear to be of fairly late date, probably during the very last years of the Zhou warring states period, into the Chin and possibly into the early Han period. They are found mostly in the area controlled by the State of Chu, but a few have been found in the area of the State of Han although those might have gotten there by trade. A few have been found buried with Ant Nose coins. They appear to the proto-type of the later Wang Mang Spades.\n\nKNIFE COINS\n\nThe knife money of the Shantung Peninsula is far less complex than the spade money, but is still poorly understood.
