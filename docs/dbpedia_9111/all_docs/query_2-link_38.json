        "text": "We have reviewed the published chemical analyses of the bronze coinage produced in pre-Qin China (before 221 BCE), with the aim of understanding the alloying practices which took place before these coins were cast. Conventionally it has been assumed that they were made to a 'target composition', by separately adding lead and tin to copper. However, by characterizing the composition of the different coin classes by trend lines rather than by calculating the average composition, we show that the majority of coins approximately fit a mixing line between two starting components-one containing copper, lead and tin (similar to the composition of bronze used to cast contemporary ritual vessels), and one containing only copper and lead. There is some archaeological evidence to support the existence of the latter as a raw material, in the form of fragments of Cu/Pb alloy broken from larger cakes, previously interpreted as primitive coinage. This proposal might have implications for how we consider the perceptions and practice of alloying processes for bronze objects in pre-Qin China.\n\nThis paper surveys of the chemical composition of the copper alloy coinage in China from the Qin Dynasty to the end of the Yuan Dynasty (221 BCE-1368 CE). It shows a dramatic change in the alloying practice used to cast these coins from the Qin unification (after 221 BCE), compared to that practiced in the pre-Qin. There are a number of shifts in the quality of the coinage from dynasty to dynasty, such as the obvious debasement of the Southern Song coinage (1127-1279 CE) when compared to that of the previous Northern Song dynasty (960-1127 CE). Particular attention is paid to the low levels of zinc in the coinage over the period. Although not as obvious as the switch to brass coinage in the Ming, certain periods do show occasional values of zinc up to 2-4%, which we suggest could reflect the sporadic input of recycled brass (Cu-Zn alloy) into the raw material melt. There were several major suppressions of Buddhism during this period, when Buddhist brass statuary was recycled into the coinage, providing a plausible mechanism for the injection of small quantities of zinc into the coinage alloy. A diachronic study of the amounts of iron in the metal, taken to indicate changes to the manufacturing process of copper, also show changes over time. The median levels of iron jump from the Qin (221-206 BCE) to the Western Han (206 BCE-9 CE), possibly reflecting the adoption of slagging processes in the production of the copper, followed by a gradual decline to the Northern Song (960-1127 CE), and a rapid increase during the Southern Song (1127-1279 CE). Finally, a study of changes in the content of silver over time reveals differences in the sources of lead, or changes in lead and silver extraction technologies, over the period.\n\nThe National Museum of Pakistan possesses a good collection of copper coins of the Kushan period. This collection contams ninety one coins of Kanishka I. Moreover, there are three gold coins of Kanishka in the same collection which are already published by the author along with other gold coins (Khan 2009). The copper coins of Kanishka are comparatively common and found in every public museum and private collection in Pakistan. These coins are usually known by their uniform design having standing fi gu re of king on the obverse and fi gu re of deity on the reverse. The early coins are inscribed with Greek legend and later with Bactrian. The legend is found on both sides; depicting name and title of the king on the obverse and name of deity on the reverse. The copper coins are known to have struck in three denominations i.e. large (tetradrachm, medium (didrachm) and small (drachm) units. These coins unanimously bear four-pronged tamga, modified version of Wima Kadphises tamga, on the reverse and on some examples it appears on the obverse too. The obverse of small coins also exhibit Kharo�\\hi letter in the left field. Some pieces of small denominations bearing Kharo�\\hi letters on obverse also show figure of king seated on a throne. Previous Classification of Kanishka Copper Coins The coins of this ruler, identified as Kanerki or Kanerkou, were first properly arranged in the form of a catalogue by Wilson. He placed them after the coins of Wima Kadphises (Wilson 1841: 357-373). In this arrangement the gold coins were organized first, followed by the copper, and the copper were classified as: 1. The good looking middle size coins depicting Greek legend BACIAEYC BACIAEWN KANHl>KOY (Basileos Basileon Kanishkou) on the obverse with two reverse varieties i.e. (a) Helios and (b) Nanaia. 2. Small coins with two reverse varieties (a) Nana and (b) Mao. 3. Large, medium and small coins depicting legend (Bactrian) I>AO KANHI>KI (shao Kanishki) on the obverse with seven reverse varieties i.e. (a) Nana, (b) Mao, (c) Miiro, (d) Athro (Athsho), (e) Okro (Oesho), (f) Oado and (g) Okama oao (Sakamao Boddou). Percy Gardner, in his catalogue of coins in the British Museum, generally followed the above scheme of classification but arranged Kanishka's coins in more elaborate sequence (Gardner 1886: 129-35, pis. XXVI­ VII). Accordingly the gold and copper coins are organized in four major groups and the deities are placed by their names in alphabetical order. The first two groups (gold and copper) are based on Greek legend and the later two (gold and copper) on Bactrian legend such as: Group 1. Gold coins: the obverse depicting standing figure of king and is inscribed with Greek legend BAOAEYC BAOAEWN KANHl>KOY and with a single reverse variety, (a) Salene. Group 2. Copper coins: as group 1, but with two reverse varieties, (a) Helios and (b) Nanaia. Group 3. Gold coins: the obverse is inscribed with Bactrian legend I>AONANO I>AO KANHl>KI KOI>ANO and it has eleven reverse varieties with standing figure of the king on the obverse and two reverse varieties with bust portrait of king on the obverse.\n\nThe Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) was a prosperous period for China's maritime trade and also an era when coins flowed abroad. Song coins were not only used as currency in neighboring countries in East and Southeast Asia at the time, but also appear to have been used as metalwork. However, many details of both maritime history and numismatics have yet to be elucidated, and even comprehensive scholarly information on indigenous Chinese currency is incomplete. In this insufficient research situation, EDXRF, metallography, MC-ICP-MS and ICP-AES were employed to investigate the alloy composition, microstructure, lead isotope and trace element characteristics of 14 Song Dynasty coins from Nanhai No. I shipwreck in this study. The XRF results show that all the samples are Cu-Sn-Pb ternary alloy. The metallography results show three types of as-cast microstructures. According to the lead isotope ratios, the diverse provenances of the lead material of the Nanhai No. I coins are clearly different from the Japanese ancient coins. In addition, the trace element data suggest that the copper raw materials for the coins came from several mines. These preliminary results may provide background data to facilitate questions related to the maritime history of East and Southeast Asia."
