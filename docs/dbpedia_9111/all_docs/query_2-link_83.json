        "text": "There are a number of festivals, holidays and other events celebrated in Hanoi each year. The main ones are listed below.\n\nJANUARY 1: NEW YEAR'S EVE (NATIONAL)\n\nJANUARY OR FEBRUARY: LUNAR NEW YEAR – TET FESTIVAL (TÊT NGUYÊN DáN) (NATIONAL HOLIDAY)\n\nTet, or the lunar calendar New Year's (Chinese), is a major event in Vietnam. The festivities begin every year on the first day of the first lunar month and last one week. During the Tet holiday, shops close, people return to their hometown to visit their parents and pay homage to their ancestors. Families and friends gather to eat traditional meals, and houses are decorated with yellow flowers.\n\n10 DAYS IN JANUARY OR FEBRUARY: CO LOA FESTIVAL (LOCAL)\n\nThe spiral-shaped citadel of Co Loa, a jewel of military architecture, celebrates the reign of its founder, An Duong Vuong (214-208 BC) every year from the 6th to 16th day of the first lunar month. Located 16 kilometres north of Hanoi, the citadel is the scene of spectacular processions and religious rites. The event is also lively, with traditional performances by night and popular games by day: chess with human pawns, cockfights, rice-cooking contests, ritual dances, and more.\n\nAPRIL 6: ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF THE FIRST HUNG EMPEROR (GIỗ Tổ HùNG VươNG) (NATIONAL HOLIDAY)\n\nThe death of the first known king of Vietnam is celebrated on the tenth day of the third month of the lunar calendar. Festive commemorations take place, especially in front of the temple of the Emperor, in Hanoi.\n\nAPRIL 30: ANNIVERSARY OF REUNIFICATION (Kỷ NIệM NGàY đấT NướC THốNG NHấT) (NATIONAL HOLIDAY)\n\nThis date marks the end of the two wars in Vietnam, against France and the United States. On this occasion, military parades and sporting contests are held.\n\nMAY 1: INTERNATIONAL LABOUR DAY (NGàY QUốC Tế LAO độNG) (NATIONAL HOLIDAY)\n\nThis is actually a very busy day in Vietnam! Numerous tourists, notably from China, enjoy visiting the country from early May. Shops, restaurants, and tourist sites are all buzzing!\n\nSEPTEMBER 2: NATIONAL DAY OF VIETNAM (NGàY QUốC KHáNH) (NATIONAL HOLIDAY)\n\nThis holiday commemorates the Declaration of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by Hô Chi Minh. Official speeches are given and military parades take place. Big cities are adorned with the colours of the country and pay tribute to the founder of the current Vietnamese Communist Party and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (became Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1976).\n\nSEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER: MID-AUTUMN FESTIVAL, OR MOON FESTIVAL (TÊT TRUNG THU) (NATIONAL HOLIDAY)\n\nOn the occasion of the moon festival, held on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month, the Vietnamese eat crescent moon-shaped cakes, made ​​of glutinous rice flour and stuffed with lotus seeds. In the evening, the children walk with lanterns in the shape of dragons, unicorns, and carp to the sound of drums and cymbals in the city streets. Dance performances and traditional music are also held outdoors during the day.\n\n31 DECEMBER: NEW YEAR'S EVE\n\nEuropean New Year is mainly popular with the younger generations. In Hanoi and other major Vietnamese cities, young people meet for drinks in the city centre. Around midnight, the streets fill up, with everyone attending the countdown and traditional firework display.\n\nBus and taxi are the perfect ways to explore the city and its surroundings.\n\nCar\n\nLack of signage in certain neighbourhoods, overloaded traffic in peak hours and parking problems: traffic in Hanoi can be hellish so it’s better to avoid using a car during your stay. Furthermore, although an international driving licence has been valid since 2015, it must be accompanied by a Vietnamese translation certified by the local police.\n\nBus\n\nHanoi and the surrounding districts are crisscrossed by some 60 bus lines. The most important lines run generally from 5:30 am to 1:00 a.m. every 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nThe best lines for sightseeing are line 14, which takes you near Hoan Kiem Lake and the Old Town, lines 2, 9 and 33, which serve Le Hong Phong Street and Dien Bien Phu Street, where the Ho Chi Minh mausoleum is located, and the neighbourhood of the great boulevards. Line 47, from Long Bien terminal, will take you to Bat Trang pottery village near Hanoi.\n\nThe price of a ticket varies according to your journey:\n\nVND 7,000 within Hanoi\n\nVND 15,000 to VND 20,000 to neighbouring towns.\n\nPurchase tickets directly from the bus driver. At peak times (6:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.), it is recommended to have the exact fare. It is best not to travel by bus (lines 7, 17 and 86 to the airport) with too much luggage.\n\nTaxis\n\nTaxis are a great way to get around Hanoi, if you take into account the potential difficulties related to traffic. The price of a trip is negotiable. On average, expect an initial charge of VND 11,000 and then VND 12,000 per extra kilometre. Warning: there are over a hundred taxi companies in Hanoi. Stay away from unofficial taxis cabs: make sure the one you get into has a meter and that the driver has a photo ID, with his name and license number.\n\nMotorcycle taxis\n\nMotorcycle taxis are a quick and inexpensive way to travel around Hanoi. The motorcycle taxis parked on the sidewalks of the city are identifiable by the second helmet that the driver is holding. To ensure that it is a motorcycle taxi, ask the driver 'Xe Ôm?' (pronounced 'Shay om?' and meaning 'motorcycle taxi?'). Allow around VND 15,000 for trips around central Hanoi. This means of transport is reliable. It is preferable to agree on the price and settle the race before leaving.\n\nIn order to travel in the best conditions and for your health and safety, we invite you to check all information regarding preventive measures and best practices to be respected, available on the official website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs: www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files.\n\nYour comfort, well-being and health are at the heart of Air France's concerns, and we want to help you prepare for your trip in the best way possible. Find out more about the measures taken to ensure safe travelling on our website: wwws.airfrance.fr/en/information/covid-19.\n\nSee your doctor before you travel. It is recommended to take out health insurance covering medical expenses abroad and the costs of repatriation before a trip to Vietnam. Hanoi counts several hospitals and medical institutions, as well as quality medical practitioners and health specialists.\n\nVACCINATIONS\n\nThere are no vaccine requirements for entering Vietnam (this information is subject to change without notice), but the following vaccines are recommended before departure:\n\nDiphtheria-tetanus-polio booster.\n\nOther vaccines, such as hepatitis A and B, and typhoid may also be recommended.\n\nFor long stays, it is recommended to get a rabies vaccination.\n\nFor more information, contact Paris République ELSAN international vaccination centre:\n\nAddress: 38, quai de Jemmapes, 75010 Paris, France\n\nWebsite: https://www.elsan.care/fr/centre-de-vaccination-internationale-paris-republique\n\nTelephone: +33 (0)1 43 17 22 00\n\nTo make a vaccination appointment:\n\nonline (click here)\n\ncall the centre at +33 (0)1 43 17 22 00\n\nFOOD SAFETY\n\nIt is recommended to avoid eating raw food (meat, seashells, milk and milk-based products).\n\nWATER\n\nIt is recommended to drink bottled water."
