        "text": "Mar 14, 2019 Â© Ulrich Theobald\n\nThe system of regional states\n\nThe Shang å (17th-11th cent. BCE) had controlled a vast network of polities during the Erligang äºéå²¡ (1600-1400 BCE) and the early Anyang å®é½ (1250â1050 BCE) periods, but depended on the goodwill of their allies during the late Anyang phase. The Zhou å¨ (11th cent.-221 BCE) had learnt from this weakness and established a novel system of control with a handful of residences in the west (Khayutina 2008) and a military garrison in the east, and regional states governed by kinsmen and close supporters.\n\nHistorians combine several socio-political concepts to describe the system of the Zhou dynasty. Marxist historians identified the socio-economic system of the Shang and Zhou as that of a 'slaveholder society' (nuli shehui å¥´é¸ç¤¾æ) because of the existence of slaves or people without rights who worked for a class of exploiters (land owners), and could, moreover, be transferred or sold to others like objects (see Zhou society). In their view, the Spring and Autumn period marked the transition to a hierarchical 'feudal society' (fengjian shehui å°å»ºç¤¾æ) with a separation between proto-capitalist guilds in the cities and the realm of landowners who possessed all rights over the land and extensive rights over peasant serfs. Western historians used to interpret the political system of the Zhou as a 'feudal' one because the king conferred the rights over land to the nobility who in turn had the duty to serve the king, mainly during war.\n\nYet there were great differences between the European feudal system in its various forms and the Zhou-period system which was called fengjian å°å»º \"bestowment of an official duty in combination with land\" (Feng 2003). The word feng å° means \"to allot a certain tract of land to someone\". In the case of Zhou-period China, this land was used to nourish a functionary and was thus a form of salary. Moreover, functions and land were bestowed on close relatives to the Zhou kings, and not to politically independent leaders ('dukes') of communities or tribes. The highest functionaries, operating in the central government, were gong å ¬ (conventionally translated as \"dukes\"). The regional level of functionariesâthe regional rulersâwas called hou ä¾¯ (\"marquesses\"), which is actually a modern form of hou å \"lord\" (si å¸ \"supervisor, commander\" turned around, compare the name Hou Ji åç¨·). Functionaries of smaller entities were given the titles bo ä¼¯ (\"earls\"), zi å­ (\"viscounts\"), nan ç· (\"barons\"; see titles of nobility), and others, depending on whether their lands were located in the royal domain or in the east.\n\nTraditional historiography (Shiji å²è¨, 4 Zhou benji å¨æ¬ç´) holds that the first round of appointments was granted to descendants of the ancient mythological emperors: The land of Jiao ç¦ was given to descendants of Shen Nong ç¥è¾², Zhu ç¥ to those of the Yellow Emperor (Huang Di é»å¸), Ji è to the descendants of Emperor Yao å ¯, Chen é³ to those of Emperor Shun è, and Qi æ to the descendants of the Xia dynasty å¤ (21th-17th cent. BCE). During the reign of King Wen å¨æç, the rulers of Yu è, Dongguo æ±è¢, Xiguo è¥¿è¢, and San æ£ were invested.\n\nThe next group of appointments went to a prince of the Shang. Lufu ç¥¿ç¶, called Prince Wu Geng æ­¦åº, was made regent over Bei é¶. He was advised and controlled by two brothers of the dynastic founder King Wu å¨æ­¦ç to whom was given land nearby: Guan Shu Xian ç®¡åé®® in Yong é, and Cai Shu Du è¡ååº¦ in Wei è¡ (together called the three \"supervised\" territories, San Jian ä¸ç£). King Wu thereafter entrusted Shi, the Duke of Shao å¬å ¬å¥­ with Beiyan åç and the military commander Shang Fu å°ç¶ (i.e. LÃ¼ Shang åå°) with Qi é½.\n\nAfter the rebellion of Wu Geng, who was supported by the two lords of Guan and Cai, a further round of appointments was carried out. The Classic Zuozhuan å·¦å³ (Xigong åå ¬ 2) enumerates the regional states created at that time: Guan ç®¡, Cai è¡, Cheng é (Cheng Shu Wu æåæ­¦), Huo é (Huo Shu Chu éåè), Lu é­¯, Wei è¡, Mao æ¯ (Mao Shu Ran æ¯åè), Ran è, Gao é, Yong é, Cao æ¹, Teng æ», Bi ç¢, Yuan å, Feng é , and Xun é were governed by sons of late King Wen, i.e. brothers or half-brothers of King Wu. Yu é, Jin æ (Tang Shu Yu ååè), Ying æ, and Han é were governed by sons of King Wu. Fan å¡, Jiang è£, Xing é¢, Mao è , Zuo è, and Ji ç¥­ were governed by sons of Dan, the Duke of Zhou å¨å ¬æ¦, i.e. nephews of King Wu.\n\nThese statelets with their garrisons served as a \"shield\" (fanping èå±) for the Zhou dynasty towards the east. The last prince of the Shang, Weizi å¾®å­, was entrusted with the governance over Song å®. Another paragraph in the Zuozhuan (Zhaogong æ­å ¬ 9) explains that the Zhou saw the statelets of Wei é­, Yi é§, Rui è®, Qi å², and Bi ç¢ as the western, and original area of the Zhou, while after the conquest of the Shang, Pugu è²å§ and Yan å¥ in the east came into the orbit of the Zhou, as well as Ba å·´, Pu æ¿®, Chu æ¥, and Deng é§ in the south, and Sushen è æ , Yan ç, and Bo äº³ in the north.\n\nIt is important to note that of the 71 regional states that the Zhou created after the conquest period, 53 were governed by members of the house of Zhou (figures according to Xunzi èå­, ch. Ruxiao åæ). The Zhou empire was thus an 'enterprise' of the family Ji å§¬. For this reason, the lineage rules (zongfa å®æ³) of the house of Zhou were of great significance for the appointment of regional rulers. Regional rule was otherwise given into the hands of loyal supporters of King Wu, forming a kind of meritocracy (baofeng è¤å°; Gu 2002), or into those of families related by marriage, like the family Jiang å§. King Wu destroyed the Shang-period structure of tribal power by allegiance and alliance and replaced it by a multi-layered (duochongxing å¤éæ§) system of rule by kinship in which independent states like the barbarian polity of Xu å¾ in the Huai River æ·®æ²³ region found no proper place.\n\nThe head of state\n\nOne of the forefathers of the Zhou, Gu Gong Danfu å¤å ¬äº¶ç¶, selected his third son Ji Li å­£æ­· to be his successor, and not the older ones Tai Bo å¤ªä¼¯ (who became, according to legend, the ruler of Wu å³ in the far southeast) and Yu Zhong èä»² (who became ruler of Yu è). Yet with the foundation of the dynasty by King Wen and his son King Wu, the role of successor to the throne fell to the first son of the primary consort. The Zhou were the creators of primogeniture. King Wu's order of succession of only the oldest son of a primary consort prevented struggles for the throne, but made necessary an arrangement of rulership.\n\nThese novel rules of ancestry (zongfa å®æ³, see Zhou religion) gave all rights into the hands of the oldest son of the principal consort (di zi å«¡å­). He and his descendants were the main lineage (dazong å¤§å®) of the ruling house, while the sons of a secondary consort (shu zi åº¶å­, bie zi å¥å­) and their descendants (yet only those by primary consorts) constituted lesser lineages (xiaozong å°å®, jibie ç¹¼å¥, jimi ç¹¼ç¦°). These \"lesser lineages\" venerated other forefathers than the main lineage. For this reason, the regional lords were not allowed to found a royal ancestral temple (wangmiao çå») in their territory, and their grand masters (dafu å¤§å¤«), local administrators and usually descendants of the regional rulers, were not allowed to venerate the ancestors of the regional rulers in their temples.\n\nThe Zuozhuan (Huangong æ¡å ¬ 2) therefore compares the Zhou empire with a family: each regional ruler had his own house (jia å®¶), each regional minister (qing å¿) a \"wing\" (ceshi å´å®¤, i.e. lodge of younger brothers), each grand master's younger or half-brothers had secondary altars (erzong è²³å®), and each serviceman (shi å£«, also offspring of regional houses or those of grand masters) and commoner was treated in a similar way.\n\nWith the appointment of rulers over the regions of his empire which were tied to him by a strict system of kinship, the king of Zhou was not any more primus inter pares, but the master of the regional rulers, as the philosopher and historian Wang Guowei çåç¶­ (1877-1927) asserted (Yang 1994: 77). The regional rulers were not independent and free to decide over whether supporting the king of Zhou or not: they were functionaries, not more. This system of dependency was cascaded down to the lowest level of local administration.\n\nThe position of the king of Zhou was reinforced by the metaphysical concept of the Mandate of Heaven (tianming å¤©å½, see Zhou religion) given into the hands of the house of Zhou. Heaven, as the master of the world, had appointed Ji Fa å§¬ç¼ (King Wu) king of the empire, as a kind of functionary himself. Even the role of the king was embedded into a kinship network, by alleging that he was the \"Son of Heaven\" (tianzi å¤©å­), as the Classic Shangshu å°æ¸ says (ch. Shaogao å¬èª¥): Huangtian Shangdi, gai jue yuanzi çå¤©ä¸å¸ï¼æ¹å¥å å­ \"August Heaven, the High Ancestor, changed his primary son (King Wu of Zhou instead of King Zhou ç´ of the Shang).\" This ideology bolstered the position of the Zhou king fundamentally. According to the theorem of the Mandate of Heaven, the king had obtained power on the grounds of the \"virtue\" (de å¾·) of the dynastic founders King Wen and Wu, who again were granted the right to rule by Heaven. The ancestral cult of the Zhou ensured the continuance of the founding king's lives (by way of commemoration), which means that the later kings King Cheng å¨æç, Kang å¨åº·ç, and so on, were just agents on behalf of King Wen and Wu (Li 2008: 295).\n\nFigure 1. The pyramid of appointment\n\nRight in the beginning of the Western Zhou period, a circumstance emerged that became paradigmatic for the question of rulership and regency. When King Wu died, his son, King Cheng, was allegedly too young to rule, and political matters were therefore taken over by his uncle, the Duke of Zhou. The Duke received the regional rulers and military commanders in the Bright Hall (mingtang æå ), bearing an axe as the symbol of royal power, just as the Son of Heaven did. The Duke of Shao likewise supported his nephew. When King Cheng was facing death, he followed this paradigm and entrusted the dukes of Shao and Bi with the regency of the empire. Whether the Duke of Zhou was only acting as a regent whether he was ruling as a king, is still under debate, and it might be that the Duke was by other ministers, mainly Duke Shi of Shao, forced to retire (Shaugnessy 1997).\n\nThe king of Zhou was the supreme military commander, but he could also lay supreme command into the hands of trusted and experienced functionaries. All appointments (ceming åå½), be they temporary or permanent, were made in the framework of ceremonies carried out at the ancestral altar (see Zhou religion). The ritual classic Zhouli å¨ç¦® (part Chunguan æ¥å®, ch. Dazongbo å¤§å®ä¼¯) enumerates the nine types of etiquette (jiu yi ä¹å) according to which functionaries were appointed and ranked, namely nominal offices (zhi è·), robes (fu æ), positions [at the royal court] (wei ä½), ritual vessels (qi å¨), concessions for regulations (ze å), appointing own functionaries (guan å®), concession for a regional state (guo å), establishment of pastures [for breeding war horses] (mu ç§), and the concession of \"first-class\" regional lord (bo ä¼¯).\n\nEven when high dignitaries executed official appointments at certain occasions, the king presided them as the one who bestowed favour on the candidates. It seems that the Zhou king regularly toured the settlements (xunshou å·¡ç©) in his domain and at such occasions carried out appointments in the local royal temple or pronounced edicts. In this way, the Zhou king actively engaged in the administration process, which was in fact carried out by local dignitaries and officials (Li 2008: 142).\n\nAppointment ceremonies were accompanied or initiated with religious ceremonies, as can be seen, for instance, in the ritual Classic Liji ç¦®è¨ (ch. Jitong ç¥­çµ±). Royal visits appear to have been frequent, particularly in the first quarter of the year. During such visits, the king did not only appoint fresh officials (even if the decision over the personnel might not have been in his hands but followed rules of the 'bureaucratic autonomy' of the local nobility), but likewise confirmed the position holders of offices. The creation of a bureaucratic apparatus liberated the Zhou kings (particularly the weaker ones among them) from deciding over each single case in routine appointments.\n\nPolicy making in the Western Zhou\n\nEven if the king of Zhou was an absolute monarch, it was common that high dignitaries gave him advice. King Wu trusted the military advice of LÃ¼ Shang, Grand Duke of Qi (Qi Taibo é½å¤ªä¼¯ or Qi Taigong é½å¤ªå ¬), and the military and civilian support of the dukes of Zhou, Shao, and Bi ç¢. King Cheng relied on the support of the Duke of Zhou as \"Grand Commander\" (taishi å¤ªå¸«, usually translated as \"Grand Preceptor\"), and the Duke of Shao as Grand Guardian or Grand Protector (taibao å¤ªä¿). In the first seven years of the reign of King Cheng, the Duke of Zhou was regent, and made all political decisionsânot without debates with the Duke of Shao. The attack on the Shang prince Wu Geng and his supporters, the destruction of the Huaiyi æ·®å¤· tribes in the east, the relocation of the Shang people, and the construction of an eastern capital seat, were all decisions of the Duke of Zhou. The highest advisors of the king of Zhou were called the \"Three Dukes\" (sangong ä¸å ¬).\n\nYet the kings also relied on the hints of oracles (see Zhou religion) to make political decisions easier. Before attacking King Zhou of the Shang, Ji Fa made a divination. The Duke of Zhou made a divination when selecting an ideal place for the eastern stronghold Chengzhou æå¨, the eventual Luoyang æ´é½, Henan.\n\nYet suggestions for policy making might come from all levels of the nobility and even from commoners, as the Shiji (4 Zhou benji) alleges. Such from the ranks of functionaries were common. Ji Gong Moufu ç¥­å ¬è¬ç¶ (a posthumous honorific name actually meaning \"counsellor-father\"), for instance, voted against King Mu's å¨ç©ç war against the Quanrong ç¬æ tribes. Rui Liangfu è®è¯ç¶ and the Duke of Shao criticized the military plans of King Li å¨å²ç (r. 878-841 BCE).\n\nDecisions of the court were made public by proclamations (gao èª¥) to the nobility.\n\nThe central government of the Zhou\n\nEven if the Zhou kings regularly toured their empire, they had fix residences in their homeland in the west. King Wen once destroyed the Shang outpost of Chong å´ and thereupon transferred his seat from Qishan å²å±± (close to present-day Baoji å¯¶é, Shaanxi) to Feng è± (é ) farther east (just west of Xi'an è¥¿å®). His son, King Wu, created a new seat not far away, in Hao é¬. The Feng-Hao region was called Zongzhou å®å¨ \"Ancestral Zhou\". King Mu å¨ç©ç created a new residence in Zheng é­, Xizheng è¥¿é­, or Huaili æ§é (also called Yulin æ£«æ, Quanqiu ç¬ä¸ or Junqiu è»ä¸), close to present-day Xingping èå¹³, Shaanxi. After the victory over the Shang, the Duke of Zhou decided to establish a secondary capital in the east, mostly for military reasons, to be ready if rebellions should break out. This capital was called Chengzhou (today's Luoyang, Henan). Throughout the Western Zhou period, the Zhou kings thus used a network of residences, part of which was connected with memory in the ancestors, while others served as garrisons, like Chengzhou (Khayutina 2008).\n\nThe core of the central government was a kind of royal council consisting of \"dukes\" (gong). The dukes were related to the royal house by kinship. In a similar way, the government on each level consisted of a nobleman and his relatives as advisors: \"ministers\" (qing) gave advice to the regional rulers, younger brothers (ceshi) to the \"ministers\", second-born scions (erzong) to the grand masters (dafu), \"friends\" (pengyou æå) to the servicemen (shi), and all state employees had relatives \"which assisted them\" (according to a commentary by Du Yu æé , 222-284, on Zuozhuan).\n\nThe semi-classic Da Dai Liji å¤§æ´ç¦®è¨ (ch. Baofu ä¿å ) explains that there were Three Dukes (sangong), namely the Duke of Shao (lord of Yan) as Grand Guardian (taibao), the Duke of Zhou (lord of Lu) as Grand Mentor or Preceptor (taifu å¤ªå ), and the Grand Duke of Qi as Grand Commander (taishi). The Duke of Bi might have been Grand Astrologer (taishi å¤ªå²), who was also the chief archivist of the royal house (Wang & Yang 1996: 333). He also occasionally played a role in central government decisions.\n\nRecent research based on bronze inscriptions shows that the Zhou empire was practically divided into two zones, one covering the 'colonized east' governed by regional states (waifu å¤æ \"exterior services\"), and the other the western region and Luoyang (i.e. the royal domain) directly under the control of the royal house (neifu å §æ \"interior services\"). Regional rulers of the east were called hou ä¾¯ (in rare circumstances, like the state of Xu è¨±, nan ç·äºº, or dian ç¸), those of the west were called bo ä¼¯ (rarely zhong ä»², shu å, and ji å­£âactually terms expressing family relationships), and on lower levels bang é¦, cai é, or wei è¡ (dignitaries who had authority over certain areas of land). The word bang é¦ referred to polities in the west, but not to particular regional states in the east. These two zones were founded, organized, and governed in different ways (Li 2008: 47-48).\n\nThe daily business of the central government was run by two sections of officials, namely the Ministerial Department (qingshiliao å¿äºå¯®), and the Department of the Grand Astrologer (taishiliao å¤ªå²å¯®). Both terms are not mentioned in transmitted Classics, but are reconstructed on the base of bronze inscriptions, and neglected sources. The structure of the Zhou government as described in the ritual classic Zhouli, with six ministers (liu qing å ­å¿) as heads of six departments or \"ministries\" related to the seasons (see Six Ministries) does not fit with other sources like bronze inscriptions, the Shangshu, or later writings.\n\nThe concept of the central government as composed of two departments was first described by Yang Kuan (1984). It was criticized by Zhang Zhikang (1988), who said that Yang relied too much on bronze inscriptions and totally ignored written sources, particularly the Zhouli. Zhang points at the multiple functions that the highest dignitaries of the central government took over. This makes it nearly impossible to speak of a regular structure of administration.\n\nTable 1. The central government of the Western Zhou (neifu å §æ) Grand Commander (taishi å¤ªå¸«)\n\nGrand Guardian (taibao å¤ªä¿)\n\nGrand Mentor (taifu å¤ªå ) Ministerial Department (qingshiliao å¿äºå¯®) Department of the Grand Astrologer or Grand Secretariat (taishiliao å¤ªå²å¯®) 1.

Balancer of Justice (zhunren æºäºº)\n\nOverseer of Bandits (sikou å¸å¯)\n\nOverseer of Functionaries (sishi å¸å£«)\n\n3. Administrator of the Royal Domain (changbo å¸¸ä¼¯)\n\nRoyal Guard (huben èè³) Grand Astrologer (taishi å¤ªå²)\n\nAstrologer-Recorder (shi å²)\n\nCensor (xingshi çå²)\n\nGrand Supplicator (zhu å¤§ç¥)\n\nOverseer of Divination (sibu å¸å) Royal Household Administration Grand Steward or Superintendent (zai å®°)\n\nJunior Steward (neizai å §å®°)\n\nFood Steward (shanfu è³å¤«)\n\nPalace Steward (shougong å®å®®)\n\nSteward of Coaches (yuzheng å¾¡æ­£), Chief Interior Scribe (neishiyin å §å²å°¹), Chief Book Maker (zuoceyin ä½åå°¹)\n\nThe Ministerial Department administered the \"three affairs\" (sanshi ä¸äº, san you si ä¸æå¸) and the four regions (sifang åæ¹). The \"three affairs\" were managed by the functionaries called Administrator of State Affairs (changren å¸¸ä»»), Balancer of Justice (zhunren æºäºº), and Administrator of the Royal Domain (changbo å¸¸ä¼¯). All these offices are not mentioned in the Zhouli, but appear in bronze inscriptions (e.g. Mao Gong ding æ¯å ¬é¼, Ling yi ä»¤å½) as well as in the Classic Shangshu (ch. Lizheng ç«æ¿).\n\nThe Administrator of State Affairs (changbo), was superior of three functionaries, which are occasionally called \"three dukes\" (sangong ä¸å ¬) or the Three Supervisors (sanyousi ä¸æå¸, also written ð¤²), namely the Overseer or Supervisor of the Masses (situ å¸å¾, in the early Western Zhou called Overseer of Land (situ å¸å), the Overseer of Works (sikong å¸ç©º, or Supervisor of Constructions, sigong å¸å·¥), and the Overseer of Mounts (sima å¸é¦¬). They were assisted by the \"many officials\" (zhuyin è«¸å°¹), document makers (zuoce ä½å), and scribes (shi å²).\n\nThe Overseer of the Masses (situ å¸å¾, da situ å¤§å¸å¾, also called situ å¸å, zhong situ å¢å¸å; according to the Zhouli head of the \"Terrestrial Offices\"), was responsible for registering land (ji tian èç°) and census. Apart from these civilian duties, he was also commander of infantry of the divisions of Chengzhou (see Zhou military) and assisted the king during appointment ceremonies.\n\nThe Overseer of Works (sikong å¸ç©º, also written sigong å¸å·¥; according to the logic of the Zhouli head of the \"Hibernal Offices\") controlled the construction of military roads, canals, and of buildings used by the king. Occasionally, the Overseer of Works might take over jurisdictional matters as Overseer of Bandits (sikou å¸å¯; according to the Zhouli head of the \"Autumnal Offices\").\n\nThe third person was the Commander of Mounts (sima å¸é¦¬; according to the Zhouli head of the \"Aestival Offices\") who took over command during military campaigns â but quite interestingly, no source has been found yet proving that the sima took really part in battles (Wang & Yang 1996: 336-337).\n\nThe royal guard (huben, huchen èè£) also belonged to the jurisdiction of the Administrator of the Royal Domain. It consisted usually of 800 men (Wang & Yang 1996: 337), and protected the king in daily life and during his tours and ceremonies, but might also take over attacks during military campaigns. During the conquest of the Shang, the guard was allegedly 3,000-strong. In a wider sense, the Six and Eight Armies (see Zhou military), commanded by marshals (shi å¸«), were likewise subordinated to the central government.\n\nThe department of justice (sifaguan å¸æ³å®), headed by the Balancer of Justice (zhunren), consisted of the sections of the Overseer of Bandits (sikou å¸å¯), a kind of Minister of Justice, and the Overseer of Functionaries (sishi å¸å£«). The first Minister of Justice was the Duke of Su èå ¬ (Su Fensheng èå¿¿ç), his successor the \"Uncle\" Duke of Kang åº·å. The Overseer of Functionaries was responsible for discipline among the \"hundred offices\" (bailiao ç¾å¯®) and thus a kind of judiciary official. This post might correspond to the office of \"Master of the Elite\" (shishi å£«å¸«) in the Zhouli.\n\nThe civil department (minshiguan æ°äºå®) of the Administrator of the Royal Domain (changbo) was supervising local administration, scattered tribes, and important passes.\n\nThe Department of the Grand Astrologer (taishiliao) was responsible for appointments (ceming), salaries (zhilu å¶ç¥¿), records and maps, sacrifices, divination, rituals, astronomy and astrology, and the observation of agriculture, i.e. a kind of secretarial and cultural branch of government. It might correspond to the \"Spring Offices\" in the Zhouli. Head of the Department was the Grand Astrologer (taishi å¤ªå², gong taishi å ¬å¤ªå²). His rank was only second to that of Grand Commander (taishi) or Grand Guardian (taibao). The first Grand Astrologer of the Zhou was the Duke of Bi ç¢. All affairs handled by the Grand Astrologer were minutely recorded, and he thus also served as the chief secretary of the royal government, a kind of 'Grand Secretary'.\n\nDuring sacrifices or other ceremonies, the Astrologer-Recorder (shi å²) read aloud the king's proclamations. He was also responsible for documenting all events and sacrifices and for archiving them. The function of \"heralding\" the royal proclamations was during sacrifices also taken over by the Supplicator or Invocator (zhu ç¥). The function of the Censor (xingshi çå²) was to control and perhaps punish officials. Concerning the status and rank of the supplicators, sources are contradictory. While the Classic Liji (ch. Quli æ²ç¦® B) and bronze inscriptions rank this office quite high, the Zhouli sees it as a rather subaltern office. The Overseer of Divination (sibu å¸å) corresponds to the Grand Diviner (dabu å¤§å) in the Zhouli. Divination was an important aspect of policy making (Wang & Yang 1996: 343).\n\nIn the very beginning of the Zhou period, both capitals, Zongzhou (Feng-Hao) the west and Chengzhou (Luoyang) in the east had a full staff of the two Departments. The eastern one was supervised by the Duke of Zhou, and the western one by the Duke of Shao. This parallel structure was one reason why many dignitaries bore the suspicion that the Duke of Zhou planned to create a kind of counter-government. When King Cheng took over full regency, he abolished the civilian character of Chengzhou and reduced it to a military garrison (Wang & Yang 1996: 340).\n\nThe needs of the royal household were managed by the Grand Steward (zai å®°), an office which already existed under the Shang, and gradually emerged as a political one with great responsibility, the Counsellor-in-chief. The Duke of Zhou is occasionally called zai, which means that he controlled both the affairs of the royal household and grand politics, as regent for King Cheng. The Grand Steward supervised all the King's officials (zhenzhishi æå·äº).\n\nBronze inscriptions give a hint at the existence of a Grand Steward and a Junior Steward (neizai å §å®°, gongzai å®®å®°), as in the Zhouli (xiaozai å°å®°). The latter was also called yanyin å¥å°¹ \"Manager of the Interior\". It might have been that the Junior Steward was responsible for the royal household internally, and the Grand Steward for external affairs, like proclamations or else. The Food Steward or Provisioner (shanfu åå¤«, in the Zhouli written è³å¤«) cared for provisions, royal banquets, and the reception of guests. He was also entitled to transmit orders by the king, even such to the eight divisions. The Palace Steward (shougong å®å®®, in the Zhouli called gongzheng å®®æ­£) cared for security in the palace. The head of the royal coaches was called yuzheng å¾¡æ­£. King Mu's chief coacher was Zao Fu é ç¶. The Grand Steward gained more importance as assistant (youzhe å³[=ä½]è ) to the king in court ceremonies during the later part of the Western Zhou period. In his place, the Food Steward became the head of the Royal Household (Li 2008: 94-95).\n\nZuoce neishi ä½åå §å² or zuoming neishi ä½å½å §å², or simply neishi å §å² or neishi yin å §å²å°¹ were recorders, scribes, archivists, keepers of records, and took part in cadastral records and recorded the daily activities of the king. Apart from these duties of clerical work, the chief recorder was entitled to receive tributes and presents for the queen, supervised the casting of ritual bronze vessels, made proclamations in the ancestral temple, inquired regional rulers, took care for the royal banners and insignia (Wang & Yang 1996: 347).\n\nThe Shangshu (ch. Lizheng) adds to these keepers of the robes (zhuiyi ç¶´è¡£), equerries (quma è¶£é¦¬), heads of palatial departments (xiaoyin å°å°¹), personal attendants (zuoyou xipu å·¦å³æå), and treasurers (shufu åº¶åº).\n\nLi (2008) elucidates the development of the central administration of the Western Zhou, which began as a mixed military-civilian administration, in which the Ministerial Department, the office of the Astrologer-Scribe, the Royal Household, and the religious institution with the Grand Invocator were progressively expanded horizontally (number of offices and personnel) and vertically (central and local). Thus, local branches of these offices were set up in all parts of the royal domain as well as in the regional states.\n\nDuring the mid-Western Zhou period, the royal household (wangjia çå®¶) gained more prominence, and the offices of the Overseer of the Masses and the Overseer of Bandits emerged. In the garrison places where the Eight and Six Royal Divisions were found, a civilian bureaucracy came up. Military personnel perhaps carried out civilian functions (Li 2008: 81). The organization in six armies moreover corresponded, quite probably, to the civilian organization in six districts (liu xiang å ­é).\n\nThe traditional distinction between civilian (wen æ) and military (wu æ­¦) was apparently not known in the early Western Zhou period, but the martial atmosphere of the first century of the period was perhaps one reason why by and by a civilian apparatus emerged in the central government as a counterpart to the military realm, first among the interior secretarial body, and then in the official body of the 'Grand Secretariat' (Li 2008: 94).\n\nThe administration of the royal domain\n\nThe royal domain in the west of the early Zhou empire consisted of landed property owned by the royal house (wangji çç¿ \"royal fields\"), land owned by the aristocratic lineages, and estates managed by the state. 'Royal property' were various palaces, temples (Taimiao å¤ªå», Kanggong åº·å®®, Zhaogong æ­å®®) and other architecture like the royal school (xuegong å­¸å®®) located in the major settlements as well as gardens, parks, pastures, lakes (as Lake Biyong ç§é) and estates scattered in the suburbs (jiao é) of the royal residences, including the quarters of people serving in and working for the royal household (e.g. workshops). They were managed by \"my [the king's] officials\" (zhenzhishi æå·äº) (Li 2008:151-154).\n\nThe estates of the aristocratic lineages like Jing äº, Rong æ¦®, Liangqi æ¢å ¶, Qiu è£, Guo è¢, or San æ£, were located in the countryside, but some had also possessions and residences in the capitals.\n\nState-administrated land (yi é \"settlement surrounded by land\", tian ç° \"specific land\") farther away from the royal residences constituted the main source of revenues for the royal house. The land was managed by local officials appointed by the king. When the king awarded land to dignitaries, it came from this royal property. The five 'cities' of the Zhou (wuyi äºé), namely Qi å², Cheng ç¨, Feng, Hao, Zheng é­, Huaili, and also Ban (?) and Bi ç¢,were not only ceremonial settlements with temples and palaces, but included residences of the aristocracy, garrisons, workshops producing objects for the royal household or the royal army, government headquarters, and also dwellings of commoners, mainly peasants who worked on the fields of the royal estates in the vicinity.\n\nThe 'cities' were administrated by officials appointed by the king, each of them having a defined jurisdiction, like horses, workshops, dykes, religious ceremonies, or the supervision of farmers (Li 2008: 167). The cities of the Zhou domain were focuses of the political and administrative power of the royal state. Yet there was no city government. Administration was subject to royal control. Apart from officials responsible for one single city, there was probably a staff of officials responsible for all \"five cities\". Although each city accommodated multiple social and economic functions, it did not constitute an independent political entity. Despite the centralized control of the cities, there was an administrative body existing in each of them, like supervisor of land, of multitudes, of construction.\n\nIn the countryside there were settlements of the royal domain, lineage settlements (zuyi æé, their residential place), and affiliated settlements (shuyi å±¬é, belonging to the lineage). Such settlements were managed by a variety of petty officials like the supervisor of marshes and forests (yu è) or the little doorkeeper (xiaomen å°é) (Li 2008: 187). Rural settlements were administered by lijun éå \"village administrators\" or bangjun é¦å \"regional administrators\" (Li 2008: 182-183). The concept of 'district' (xiang é) as an administrative unit of the Western zhou domain is doubtful because it only appeared as late as the Spring and Autumn period. The distinction between guoren åäºº \"people living close to the royal residence\" and yeren éäºº \"people living in the countryside\" likewise dates from the Eastern Zhou period.\n\nPresentations like in the Zhouli chapters Da situ å¤§å¸å¾ and Suiren éäºº are therefore to be taken with caution. The figures would result in 168,750 households controlled by the royal house.\n\nTable 2.

Da situ å¤§å¸å¾ and Suiren éäºº. Translations, as far as possible, according to Hucker (1985).\n\nSales of land was possible, as can be seen in the inscription of the San shi pan æ£æ°ç¤ plate. From the mid-Western Zhou period on the kings bestowed ever smaller pieces of land to the aristocracy, often found in different locations. This practice, and the selling of land, led to a mosaic pattern of landownership in the royal domain in late Western Zhou period. (Li 2008: 157).\n\nThe regional states during the Western Zhou period\n\nThe region outside the royal domain (waifu å¤æ) was governed by regional rulers (fangbo æ¹ä¼¯, later usually called zhuhou è«¸ä¾¯), functionaries or governors entrusted with the control of a certain territory on behalf of the king. The functionaries would take care of the defence and economy (\"the people\") of the territory and would be allowed to live of the soil. The bestowment of the territory was called feng å°, a character showing a hand å¯¸ and a surveying tool å­ or boundary markers. Depending on the size of the territory, the regional lords might be given ranks like hou ä¾¯, dian ç¸, nan ç· (or ren ä»»), and wei è¡ (according to Shangshu, ch. Jiugao é èª¥), or hou, tian ç° (=dian), and nan (inscription of Ling yi ä»¤å½), or hou, dian, nan, cai é, and wei (Shangshu, ch. Kanggao åº·èª¥).\n\nThe Western Zhou states (both the royal domain and the regional states) were not territorial ones. Between the settlements controlled by the Zhou state, there were spaces left inhabited by population beyond the control of the Zhou.\n\nRegional states were neither city-states nor territorial states, feudal states, or segmentary states, butâaccording to the state of the artâ\"settlement states\" (yÅ«sei kokka éå¶å½å®¶, a term created by Matsumoto Mitsuo æ¾æ¬å é). These were hierarchically subject to the royal capital and bound together by (real or fictional) kinship relation. Li Feng (2003) therefore calls the Western Zhou system \"delegatory kin-ordered settlement state\". The regional rulers were bound to the royal house not just by kinship (at least the greater part of them), but also by a sworn alliance (meng ç), \"not to hurt each other\" (wu xiang hai ç¡ç¸å®³). Some of the regional states were given special duties. Lu, for instance, the state of the Duke of Zhou, was allowed to deliver sacrifices to King Wu, and to praise the virtue of the late Duke. The state of Wei è¡ was granted the right to venerate Kang Shu. The state of Qi had the special duty to take over military campaigns in the east, and over time produced quite a few \"military strategists\".\n\nThe king's control over the regional states was realized in a ceremonial, and in a practical way. The ceremonial way consisted in the duty to keep to the rules of kinship, and to regularly repeat the oath of allegiance towards the king. During those ceremonies, the king might present the regional lord a bronze vessel inscribed with a text narrating the background and reiterating the text of the investiture, and give him precious objects as a gift, like chariots, horse covers, bells or other furnishings for chariots, or cowry shellsâa kind of proto-currency.\n\nThe practical control consisted of the king's right to appoint the highest ministers of the regional states. All three ministers in the larger states were appointed by the king, while he was content to appoint two of the three ministers of the states of secondary rank. The regional rulers were obliged to deliver tributes to the royal court, which was actually an early form of taxes collected locally and then partially delivered to the central government treasury.\n\nMost important in administrative matters is that the regional rulers possessed not just administrative authority, but also military and legal authority. Nonetheless, the regional rulers were responsible to guarantee the political and social stability of their state as part of the whole Zhou empire. A regional ruler failing to do so could be punished by the King of Zhou.\n\nThe duties of the regional rulers might include service in the central government. The most famous examples are the dukes of Zhou and Shao, which were nominally entrusted with the governance of the regional states of Lu and Yan, respectively, but held the post of Grand Commander, and Grand Guardian. Transmitted sources explain that after the final destruction of the rebellious Shang prince Wu Geng and his Zhou supporters, the Duke of Zhou ordered the regional rulers to assemble at the royal court in Zongzhou (Feng-Hao). At that occasion he created the state offices and fixed the rules for ceremonies and ritual music (according to Shiji, 4 Zhou Benji). From then on, the regional rulers payed the royal court a small visit (xiaopin å°è) every second year, a great visit (dapin å¤§è) every third year, and convened to a grand audience (chao æ) in the Bright Hall (mingtang) every five years (Liji, ch. Wangzhi çå¶).\n\nTribes not incorporated into the world of regional states also delivered tributes. The Sushen è æ  in the northeast, for instance, delivered arrows and sound stones, the state of Chu in the middle Yangtze region bows and arrows, the polity of Shu è in Sichuan precious stones, and the Huaiyi tribes various clothes (Wang & Yang 1996: 354). Even if the tributes were not worth a lot, they were part of a ceremonial system, and the refusal to deliver tributes might result in a punitive campaign.\n\nThe control over the empire was held up by regular hunting tours which combined military prowess by regular visits to the regional states. The king thus \"toured\" (xun å·¡) the empire by merging hunting (shou /ÉÄ­Éu/ ç©) with defence (shou /ÉÄ­Éu/ å®). The regional rulers for their side were obliged to regularly attend court audiences which combined various other ceremonies. The spring audience was called chao æ, the summer audience zong å®, the autumn audience jin è¦², and the winter audience yu é. The king had the right to punish regional rulers or even attack them militarily for not appearing for an audience.\n\nFigure 2. The Duke of Shao as a representative of the King of Zhou\n\nThe longest jade ge dagger-axe (Tai bao yu ge å¤ªä¿çæ) ever found (today held by the Freer Gallery of Art), with a length of 67.1cm and a width of 10.2cm, bears a short inscription reporting of an inspection tour of the Duke of Shao to the south, on behalf of King Cheng (?) of Zhou. The inscription, encarved in minuscule characters, says: å ­æä¸å¯ ï¼çæ(=å¨)è±ï¼ä»¤å¤ªä¿ç(=ç)åæ(=å)ï¼å¸¥(=ç)æ¼¢ï¼{ãâ }(=åº){å®æ®·}(=æ®·)åï¼ä»¤æ¿®(ð¨½?å²?)ä¾¯è¾ï¼ç¨é¼(=é ¬,=é¨¶?)ï¼èµ°ç¾äººãâIn the sixth month, the day with the cyclical signs bingyin, the King was residing in Feng; he ordered the Grand Guardian to inspect the southern regions. [The Duke of Shao] followed the course of River Han [downwards], assembled [the lords] of the south, and invested [in the King's name] the Marquis of Pu, and presented him with one hundred guardsmen.\" There are several possible interpretations of the characters, and hence, varying translations. From Chen (2019), see also Wang (2019).\n\nControl over the regional states was also carried out by the Ministerial Department (qingshiliao). This central government institution transmitted the orders of the king and punished regional lords refusing to obey the royal orders.\n\nLast but not least, the regional lords had the duty to protect the king. This became most evident in the very late Western Zhou period, when the lords of Shen ç³ and Zeng ç¹ cooperated with the Xianyun çç tribes to punish King You å¨å¹½ç (r. 781-771) for his misdoings. When his heir, King Ping å¨å¹³ç (r. 770-720 BCE), fled to the east, he was supported by the lords of Qin ç§¦, Jin, and Zheng é­. This situation proved that the royal house had not any more the power to control the regional rulers, but depended from their support.\n\nOver time, the one or other regional state became stronger and more independent. The founder of the state of Qi, for instance, reported annually to the Duke of Zhou, while the latter's successor, Bo Qin ä¼¯ç¦½, reported only every three years to the throne. Moreover, the home state of the Duke of Zhou, Lu, was not able to exert the same mode of power as Qi, and became a 'subject' of Qi. The state of Jin was from the time of King Kang allowed to settle regional disputes by its own, without inquiring the royal court. The dukes of Jin thus became more independent from the royal house.\n\nThe decisive events destroying the Western Zhou balance between centre and region were King Xuan's å¨å®£ç (r. 827-782 BC) meddling into the succession crisis in the state of Lu in 796, and King Yi's å¨å¤·ç unjust murder of the lord of Qi, Duke Ai é½åå ¬.\n\nThe system of regional statesâoriginally built as a shield of defenceâwas also unable to protect the house of Zhou from the south and from the west, and the kings of Zhou repeatedly suffered defeat by tribal units standing outside the system of regional states.\n\nBronze inscriptions show that regional states were managed by civil administrators like situ or sigong and their secretaries or other 'officials' (li å, zhengli æ­£å), and the household of the regional rulers by Grand Superintendents ( å¤ªå®°) and provisioners (shanfu). A really unique office not found in the central government was that of inspector (jian ç£). The existence of inspectors in many regional states must have been an institutional royal attempt at tight control over the regional states (Li 2008: 251). The regional states were equipped with all functions of a 'state', but it seems that the process of bureaucratization as it can be observed in the Western Zhou central government was not unfolded in the regional states.\n\nThe ranks of ministers and grand masters in each state was clearly defined, as can be seen in Zuozhuan, Chenggong æå ¬ 3. The highest minister (shangqing ä¸å¿) in a mid-size state had thus a lower rank than that in a greater, and a higher rank than that in a small state. The same practice was known for grand masters, as Mengzi å­å­ (ch. Wan Zhang è¬ç« B) confirms.\n\nInformation about the administration of the regional states in the east is totally lacking until the beginning of the Spring and Autumn period (Li 2008: 149). The regional states of the Western Zhou were not independent kingdoms, as they would be during the Warring States period, but they were 'branches' of the Zhou central government. The government of each regional state was thus more or less a copy of the central administration (Wang & Yang 1996: 349). It is also quite probable that the local administration was divided into great settlements ([da]yi), lineage settlements (zuyi), and affiliated settlements (shuyi). An early form of local administration were the domains of grand masters (caiyi éé) that can be interpreted as 'proto-districts' administered by 'proto-magistrates'.\n\nRegional states were inhabited by \"ranked population\", the highest layer of which consisted of the Zhou elite (the regional ruler and his officials) and \"their people\", i.e. immigrants having come from the west (Zhou and allied non-Zhou tribes, or Shang people), while the native population stood at the base of this social pyramid. It is difficult to discern such local ethnicities and cultures in the Western Zhou, but it seems that Zhou \"immigrants\" and locals maintained different cultures for a long time (Li 2008: 243).\n\nThe differences in local conditions between the regional states made local policy necessary. The state of Qi, for instance, had a large population of Shang people, subjects of the former enemy, and the state of Lu was inhabited by many \"uncivilized\" Yi tribes å¤·. The lords of Qi and Lu therefore adapted their policy to these people and thus deviated somewhat from the main line of the Zhou regulations. The state of Wei è¡, new homeland of many Shang people, preserved much of their customs and habits (Wang & Yang 1996: 329; Gu 2002).\n\nRegional rulers regularly visited the Zhou capital in the west, an occasion at which usually bronze vessels were cast commemorating the ceremonies carried out during the visit, for instance, a new appointment or the confirmation of a past one or of the transition of rulership to the son of a deceased regional ruler. The king of Zhou visited the eastern states only on rare occasions (Li 2008: 260). The frequency of visits by regional rulers to the Zhou courts in Chengzhou or Zongzhou declined in the mid- and late Western Zhou period.\n\nThe state system of the Spring and Autumn period\n\nAfter the escape of the house of Zhou to the east, their domain was not larger than 600 square li é (150km2), moreover, in the course of the 7th century, the kings of Zhou presented parts of their domain to neighbouring lords, mainly Guo and Zheng, in order to reward them for their support. In the end, the domain of the Eastern Zhou encompassed no more than 1-200 square li (25-50km2) (Wang & Yang 1996: 368), and the Zhou impoverished, seen in their impotence of financing burials or state coaches.\n\nSimilar fates had many of the smaller regional states, while others like Qi, Jin, and Qin gradually won power and enlarged their territories, and thus went over from a network of domains and garrisons to territorial states. The landscape of 147 regional states and 34 non-Zhou polities (Rong and Di ç tribes) diminished to a dozen of strong states, namely Qi, Jin, Qin, Zheng, Lu, Song, Wei, Chen, Cai, Cao, and Yan, and the southern state of Chu, which had until then not been part of the Zhou empire. In the far southeast, the non-Zhou states of Wu and Yue emerged as important players.\n\nThe house of Zhou was also beset by numerous internal conflicts about the throne succession, like in 693, when Heijian é»è©, the then-Duke of Zhou å¨å ¬, killed King Zhuang å¨èç (r. 697-682); in 675, when Prince Tui ç©¨ asked Yan and Wei è¡ for support to expel King Hui å¨æ ç (r. 677-652); in 649, when Prince Dai å¸¶, supported by the Di tribes, chased King Xiang å¨è¥ç (r. 652-619) from the throne; or in 520, when Prince Gai å (or ä¸; future King Jing å¨æ¬ç, r. 520-476) asked Jin for support in order to outplay the righteous heir, Prince Chao æ.\n\nConflicts between dignitaries at the Zhou court also occurred frequently, like in 613 between Yue, Duke of Zhou å¨å ¬é±, and Prince Gongsun Su å ¬å­«è; in 603 between Prince Su and the Dukes of Shao and Mao; or in 580 between Chu, the Duke of Zhou å¨å ¬æ¥, and Minister Bo Yu ä¼¯è¼¿.\n\nIn 706, the sovereign of the southern semi-barbarian state of Chu, Xiong Tong çé, asked King Huan of Zhou å¨æ¡ç (r. 720-697) to be invested as a regional ruler, but the King ignored his request. Xiong Tong thereupon assumed the title of King of Chu (i.e. King Wu æ¥æ­¦ç, r. 741-690). A hundred years later, King Ling æ¥éç (r. 541-529) of Chu even marched towards the capital and demanded to be shown (and implicitly, handed over) the nine tripods (jiuding ä¹é¼), symbolic objects of the royal power of the Zhou. Royal Grandson Prince Man çå­«æ»¿ was finally able to order the sovereign of Chu to withdraw. His argument was that if Chu would appropriate the Nine Tripods, none of the other states would accept her suzerainty. In the same timeframe, the regional state of Zheng, just located east of the Zhou domain, challenged the royal power. Duke Zhuang of Zheng é­èå ¬ (r. 743-701) even attacked the royal army. Similar pretensions to question the royal prerogative came from the side of Duke Wen of Jin ææå ¬ (r. 636-628) by ordering King Xiang to participate in the alliance of the regional rulers concluded at Jiantu è¸å (Yuanyang åé½, Henan) in 632.\n\nIn spite of such violent clashes with the royal house, none of the regional states dared to wipe away the house of Zhou. The regional rulers were still bound by the rules of etiquette and the knowledge that the Zhou empire was an enterprise of kinship in which all ruling houses were related to each other. In the same framework of rituals and etiquette, the kings of Zhou ordered the regional rulers to punish those among them who had disobeyed the royal command, not treated their partners with respect, or refused to deliver tributes.\n\nYet it was increasingly difficult for the kings of Zhou to enforce their ordinances. Duke Huan of Qi é½æ¡å ¬ (r. 685-643) therefore decided to take over the role of a protector over the royal order and thus created a novel system of power in the Zhou empire. Lord-protectors (ba é¸, usually translated as \"hegemons\"), cared for law and order, arranged for defence alliances and punitive expeditions, repelled non-Zhou tribes, but also organized inter-state meetings during which general alliances were created and refreshed. Some of these meetings had the intention to end military conflicts by \"relaxing the arms\" (mibing å¼­å µ). In 651, at the meeting of Kui èµ, the lords of Lu, Qi, Song, Wei è¡, Zheng, Xu, and Cao, met with the Duke of Zhou. In 632, during the meeting of Jiantu, the lords of Lu, Jin, Qi, Song, Cai, Zheng, Wey and Ying convened.\n\nAfter Duke Huan, the unofficial position of lord-protector was more or less institutionalized, and its duties were taken over by Duke Wen of Jin, Duke Xiang of Song å®è¥å ¬ (r. 650-637), and Duke Mu of Qin ç§¦ç©å ¬ (r. 659-621). The function of lord-protector was in most cases only achieved after military struggles, and in the later phase of the Spring and Autumn period, several sovereigns contended for the title, some of them pretenders from the non-Zhou area, like King Zhuang of Chu æ¥èç (r. 613-591), King HelÃ¼ of Wu å³çéé­ (r. 514-496), and King Goujian of Yue è¶çå¥è¸ (r. 495-465)\n\nAs many conventional rites were ignored during the Spring and Autumn period, irregular customs found their way into daily procedures, as for instance, the succession of younger sons or that of a secondary wife, instead of the oldest son (e.g. Duke Xian of Jin æç»å ¬, r. 677-651, desired to be succeeded by Prince Xiqi å¥é½, son of a concubine); the enthronement of a prince with the support of the dignitaries of a state (e.g. Luan Shu æ¬æ¸ and Xun Yin èå¯ brought Duke Dao ææ¼å ¬, r. 573-558, to the throne); the enthronement of a sovereign with foreign support (e.g. Duke Wen of Jin, who came to the throne with the support of Qin); usurpations (e.g. King Mu of Chu æ¥ç©ç, r. 626-614, who killed his father); or abdications (e.g. Duke Xuan of Song å®å®£å ¬, r. 747-729, who resigned in favour of his brother, Duke Mu å®ç©å ¬, r. 728-720).\n\nThe primary consorts (di å«¡) of regional rulers were all daughters of other regional rulers, and in many instances, noble houses exchanged brides on regular terms, like Qi and Lu. Apart from the primary consort, the secondary consorts (zhi å§ª, di å¨£) of a regional ruler were \"supplementary brides\" (ying åªµ) from different states. The oldest son of the primary consort was usually the heir apparent (taizi å¤ªå­). He had a high position and lived in his own palace, had guard of its own, and was instructed by preceptors.\n\nA thoroughly new system was the invention of the posthumous honorific titles (yi è¬) for deceased rulers. At the same time, the taboo system (hui è«±) emerged with did not allow to mention a direct ancestor's personal name.\n\nPolitical changes in the Warring States period\n\nEven if there is no exact date to tell the beginning of the Warring States period, there were two political events marking decisive changes in the traditional structure. First, Tian Chang ç°å¸¸, scion of a noble house from Chen, usurped in 481 the throne of Qi and pushed away one of the most eminent dynasties, the Jiang å§, once invested by King Wu of Zhou. Second, three of the Six Ministers-Commander (liuqing å ­å¿), noble houses in the state of Jin, wiped away the three others and made an end of the old state of Jin, kin of the house of Zhou (family Ji å§¬), by dividing it into three new states, namely Zhao è¶, Wei é­, and Han é. In 403, the king of Zhou invested the heads of the three houses as regional rulers in their own rights. From then on, the king of Zhou was no more than a puppet, and regional states became factional states.\n\nIn 344, the lord of Wei é­ appropriated the title of king. Even if the non-Zhou states of Chu, Wu, and Yue had used the title of king since a long time, it had been a prerogative of the house of Zhou to bear this title. In 334, King Xian of Zhou å¨é¡¯ç (r. 369-320) met with the duke of Qi in Xuzhou å¾å· (Tengxian è¤ç¸£, Shandong), and both decided to entitle each other to bear the title of king. In 325, the sovereign of Qin followed suit, in 323 the lords of Han and Yan, in 323 the sovereign of Zhongshan ä¸­å±±, and in 318 the duke of Song. In 288, the kings of Qin and Qi decided to adopt the titles of Emperor of the West (Xidi è¥¿å¸, i.e. Qin), and Emperor of the East (Dongdi æ±å¸, i.e. Qi), but Su Dai èä»£ advised King Min of Qi é½æ¹£ç (r. 324-284) to give up the title to put the blame of usurpation and blasphemy on Qin, whereupon Qin also discarded the title. Yet none of the Warring States dared using the title of \"Son of Heaven\".\n\nThe dozen of states shrank to a number of seven (qixiong ä¸é), namely the new ones Zhao, Wei é­, Han, as well as Qi in the east, Yan in the northeast, Qin in the west, and Chu in the south. Chu swallowed the non-Zhou state of Yue in 306. Some of the weaker states of the Central Plain were devoured by their neighbours, namely Zheng, Song, and Luâthe small state of Wei è¡ survived until 206 but nominally. For only a short period of time, a new state emerged, namely Zhongshan, founded by the leader of a Di tribe. The house of Zhou itself split apart in an eastern branch (Dongzhou æ±å¨, residing in Gong é) and a western branch, thus limiting the ancient royal power once more.\n\nPractically all states carried out reforms in the administrative, financial, and judicial apparatus, most of them initiated by legalist reformers (usually known as fajia æ³å®¶), like Li Kui ææ in Wei, Shen Buhai ç³ä¸å®³ in Han, Wu Qi å³èµ· in Chu, Gongzhong Lian å ¬ä»²é£ in Zhao, Zou Ji éå¿ in Qi, or Shang Yang åé in Qin. They had in mind the strengthening of the central government, the raising of administrative efficiency, and the increasing of tax revenues.\n\nFormal, ceremonially founded alliances (meng ç) had been during the Spring and Autumn period a common instrument of castigating a state having trespassed the limits of commonly acknowledged law and order. Some alliances were led by lord-protectors, others not. When wars continued over many years, there was occasionally the attempt to convoke the sovereigns and their representatives to peace conferences. During the Warring States period, the aim of war was not just punishment, but the annihilation of foreign states and the appropriation of their territory. Yet from time to time, states created alliances with others to offer more resistance to offensive enemies. There were two types of alliances, namely such of several weak states against one stronger state (hezong åç¸±, \"vertical\"), and the alliance of two stronger states to attack several weaker ones (lianheng é£æ©«). In 322, for instance, six states attacked Qin, and in 318 and 287, five states. A typical lianhe (\"horizontal\") alliance was that between Qi and Qin against Chu in 301.\n\nIn order to prevent the rise of internal challenges by the nobility, the rulers of the Warring States increased the power of the sovereign and diminished that of the nobility. The status of the oldest son of the primary consort was elevated, and his rights as heir apparent bolstered in order to prevent succession struggles as during the Spring and Autumn period. The heir apparent was from the beginning regarded as the future ruler, and received according education in civilian and military matters. The teachers of the heir apparent had also the potential to be nominated regents for him in case he came to the throne in early years. The king's orders and the status of the heir apparent were critical when the worst came to the worst, as in the case of King Huai of Chu æ¥æ·ç (r. 329-299), who was a prisoner of the king of Qin, and whose heir apparent was a hostage in Qi. Minister Zhao Sui æ­ç¢ refused to enthrone another son of King Huai until Prince Heng æ©« (King Qingxiang æ¥é è¥ç, r. 299-263) was back from Qi.\n\nYet deviations from this rule were possible. King Wuling of Zhao è¶æ­¦éç (r. 326-299, d. 295 BCE) nominated his son He ä½ heir apparent, born by his beloved secondary wife. His oldest son, Gongzi Zhang å ¬å­ç« , therefore rose in rebellion. The heir apparent was from the beginning regarded as the future ruler, and received according education in civilian and military matters. The teachers of the heir apparent had also the potential to be nominated regents for him in case he came to the throne in early years.\n\nWith the growing importance of the heir apparent, the status of his mother increased, and a regular system of royal consorts emerged, with one primary consort (wanghou çå), several secondary consorts (qie å¦¾, furen å¤«äºº), and various consorts of lower levels (meiren ç¾äºº, liangren è¯äºº, bazi å «å­, qizi ä¸å­, zhangshi é·ä½¿, and shaoshi å°ä½¿). These consorts held official ranks and had at their disposal an income measured in grain, just like state officials (see female officials).\n\nWhen a king died and was succeeded by his heir apparent, the latter's mother (and the primary consort of the late king as well?) was given the title queen dowager or \"queen mother\" (taihou å¤ªå). In the late Warring States period, a Queen Mother Xuan å®£å¤ªå reigned for her under-age son King Zhuangxiang ç§¦èè¥ç (r. 250-247), while her brother, Marquis Rang ç©°ä¾¯, acted as regent or Counsellor-in-chief. This was the first attested case of a female regent. A similar situation was found in the state of Zhao, where the Queen Dowager reigned for King Xiaocheng è¶å­æç (r. 266-245). King Zheng æ¿ of Qin (the future First Emperor ç§¦å§çå¸, r. 246-210 BCE) came to the throne as a boy, but the name of his reigning mother is not known. Her Counsellor-in-chief was LÃ¼ Buwei åä¸é.\n\nWith the increasing number of regular consorts, the matters of the Private Palace (hougong å¾å®®) came into the hands of eunuchs (yanren å¥äºº, gongren å®®äºº; in Chu called sigong å¸å®®; in Zhao called huanzhe ling å®¦è ä»¤).\n\nPolicy making in the Eastern Zhou\n\nThe sovereign of a regional state had the last decision in all policy matters. High dignitaries were allowed to make suggestions and bolster them with arguments. Only when the sovereign approved a plan, it was promulgated as an edict, and carried out by the administrative apparatus. In some instances, figures of the personal service of a sovereign, like a palace attendant (dayin å¤§å°¹), prevented direct contact between a lord and his officials, or the forwarding of petitions and memorials.\n\nThe king of Zhou and the regional rulers as well had the jurisdiction over appointment, dismissal, reward, and punishment of functionaries, even if many offices were hereditary (shiguan ä¸å®) and held in the hands of individual families for several generations. The sovereigns owned the highest military command, and could allow or prohibit the use of 'private' military forces by the nobility. Finally, regional rulers could determine the way of succession, even if their wishes contradicted to the ancestral lineage system (zongfa) of the Zhou. In Qi, Duke Huan's advisor Guan Zhong ç®¡ä»² briefly summarized the \"six handles\" (liubing å ­æ)ãof the ruler as \"life and death; rich and poor; high and low\" (sha sheng, gui jian, pin fu æ®ºçãè²´è³¤ãè²§å¯; Guanzi ç®¡å­, ch. Xiaokuang å°å¡).\n\nYet the power of regional rulers was also restricted, partially by legal means, and partially by circumstances. In some states, noble houses (called guoren åäºº or min æ°ânot referring to the common folks!) dominated the succession and political decisions, like the Three Huan ä¸æ¡ families in Lu (Jisun å­£å­«, Shusun åå­«, and Mengsun å­å­«), the Seven Mu ä¸ç© families in Zheng (Si é§, Han ç½, Guo å, Liang è¯, Yin å°, You æ¸¸, and Feng è±), the Six Families in Song (Hua è¯, Yue æ¨, Huang ç, Zhong ä»², Ling é, and Yu é­), and the Six Ministers-Commander (liuqing) in Jin (Zhao è¶, Han é, Wei é­, Zhi æº, Fan è, and Zhonghang ä¸­è¡). In such a situation, the one or other ruler indulged in pleasures and was indifferent to politics. Should a ruler dominated by the nobility attempt to gain back his sovereignty, this was in most cases not possible without bloodshed. Duke Zhao of Lu é­¯èå ¬ (r. 694-662) resorted to the help of Earl Zhao of Hou éæ­ä¼¯ in order to get rid of the regent Ji Pingzi å­£å¹³å­. Yet the latter was supported by the houses Mengsun and Shusun, for fear that they might be the next, and forced Duke Zhao into exile.\n\nIn many political decisions, mainly military matters, regional rulers were dependent on the support of the nobility. If the major part of them resisted the wish of a regional ruler, he had no chance to realize it, first because the opinion of the dignitaries was ritually to be accepted, and second, because the nobility presented the majority of armed forces.\n\nThe capital seat of regional rulers consisted of a palace and a city, both surrounded by walls. The book Zhouli (part Chunguan, ch. Dianming å ¸å½) fixes the size of a ducal city as 9 li in length (c. 4.5km), and the palace at 900 paces of length (1,242m). One side of the city wall of a marquis or earl was 7-li long, and the palace 700 paces; and the residence of a 'viscount' (zi) or 'baron' (nan) was a palace of 500 paces length and a city with a length of 5 li. In the early Spring and Autumn period, transgression of these rules was still punished, as in the case of Gong Shu Duan å ±åæ®µ, whose residence was larger than that of the duke of Zheng. An archaeological survey of reality shows that the city of Linzi è¨æ·, capital of the dukes of Qi, had a length of 4.5Ã4km, and the palace a size of 1,400Ã2,200m. This fits more or less with the rules fixed in the Zhouli (Wang & Yang 1996: 411).\n\nA palace consisted of public buildings (gongshi å®®å®¤) and private quarters (qindian å¯¢æ®¿). The most outstanding example of an early Eastern-Zhou period palace is that of the dukes of Qin in Yong é found in Majiazhuang é¦¬å®¶è in Fengxiang é³³ç¿, Shaanxi. The building complex is 326m-long consists of five compartments with courts in a sequence connected by gates. In front of the whole complex is a solitary, 25-m wide wall (waiping å¤å±) to ward off evil spirits. The \"far gate\" (gaomen çé) opens to the first court, the \"magazine gate\" (kumen åº«é) to the second court which included some storerooms or arsenals (ku åº«) and stables (jiu å»). The \"pheasant gate\" (zhimen éé) opened to the third court, which included the building of the outer court (waichao å¤æ). The Pheasant Gate was also a place for public announcements (Wang & Yang 1996: 413). The outer court was the place for general political decisions, the dispense of justice, or proclamations.\n\nThe \"Responsive Gate\" (yingmen æé), also called \"main gate\" (zhengmen æ­£é) or \"gate to the court\" (chaomen æé) gave way to the fourth court, where the duke held audiences (neichao å §æ, zhichao æ²»æ). This part of the inner court was the place where a regional ruler conferred with his ministers and advisors each day. The meeting was usually held in the early morning.\n\nThe last gate, the \"Gate of the Way\" (lumen è·¯é), \"Purple Gate\" (zimen ç´«é), or \"Tiger Gate\" (humen èé), was the entrance to the private quarters of a regional ruler. This space was also called \"banquet court\" (yanchao çæ), as it was the usual venue for banquets in which only close relative of the sovereign participated.\n\nThe system of five gates is described in a commentary by Zheng Xuan é­ç (127-200) on the chapter Mingtang æå  in the ritual Classic Liji. Yet this description is valid for the palace of the Son of Heaven. This means that in the Spring and Autumn period, regional rulers appropriated the privileges of the king of Zhou.\n\nPolitical decisions were this made in a legalized framework. Yet rulers might be influenced by two other factors, namely diviners, and intimate persons (usually called zuoyou å·¦å³ \"those [constantly] being to the left and right\"), like the spouse, minions, or eunuchs. Duke Xian of Jin æç»å ¬ (r. 678-651), for instance, was influenced by his consort Li Ji é©ªå§¬, Duke Ding of Wei è¡å®å ¬ (r. 589-577) by his wife Ms Jiang å§æ°, and Duke Jing's é½æ¯å ¬ (r. 548-490) decisions in Qi were directed by his minion Liangqiu Ju æ¢ä¸æ. In 597, an oracle compelled Duke Xiang of Zheng é­è¥å ¬ (r. 605-587) not to make peace with Chu, but the outcome was that he had to accept a humiliating surrender.\n\nThe kings of the Warring States were holders of political, military, and judicial power and controlled the officialdom. In order to achieve such a powerful position, reforms were necessary, and in many cases, the nobility resisted, as in the case of King Dao of Chu æ¥æ¼ç (r. 402-381), whose reforms, carried out by Wu Qi, were abolished after the king's passing away. Shang Yang initiated reforms in Qin with the support of Duke Xiao ç§¦å­å ¬ (r. 362-338), but when the latter died, the reforms wereâat least to a certain extentâreversed. It can be seen that changes in the political structure depended from the will of a sovereign.\n\nSuccess and failure likewise depended from the will of a ruler. The Warring States period was the age of political advisors or \"diplomatists\" (zonghengjia ç¸±æ©«å®¶) who travelled around and counselled sovereigns (you shuo zhi shi éèªªä¹å£«) how to overcome difficult situations, and proposed \"stratagems\" (ce ç­) or \"intrigues\" to triumph over an enemy. Sometimes rulers neglected (bu ting ä¸è½ \"the king did not listen\") the warnings of advisors, like King Huai of Chu, who travelled to Qin, was arrested, and died there. The most famous travelling advisor was Su Qin èç§¦, who hailed from Luoyang, and gave advice to the rulers of Qin, Zhao, and Yan. Zhang Yi å¼µå hailed from Wei and served the kings of Chu and Qin. The influence of travelling advisors was so huge that King Zheng of Qin decided to \"expel\" all foreign advisors (zhu ke éå®¢). Counsellor Li Si ææ¯ submitted a remonstrance writing to the King, urging not to do this because it would deprive him of his most competent advisors. An example for the influence of a courtier and a consort is the imprisonment of Zhang Yi in Chu. Zhang had contact to Jin Shang é³å°, who influenced Zheng Xiu é­è¢, a concubine of King Huai of Chu. She put in a good word for Zhang Yi, who was set free and thereupon trapped King Huai into a disastrous coalition.\n\nThe supreme power of the king can be seen in the many death penalties applied to high ministers, like Shang Yang and Marquis Wei in Qin. Private preferences determined careers. General Yue Yi æ¨æ¯ in the state of Yan was treated with great respect by King Zhao çæ­ç (r. 312-279), but the latter's successor King Hui çæ ç (r. 279-272) dismissed the general. Most outstanding is the case of general Li Mu æç§, who was a victim of a machination by the general of Qin, who manipulated Guo Kai é­é, a minion of King Youmiu of Zhao è¶å¹½ç¹ç (r. 236-228). The king dismissed all competent generals and in their place appointed newcomers who had no chance to hold the capital of Zhao against the army of Qin.\n\nThe kings of the Warring States period used several mechanisms to gain supreme control. First, they clearly separated military from civilian matters, and appointed civilian counsellors and supreme commanders with separate jurisdictions. Rarely did high ministers take over the command over armies in the mid- and late Warring States period. The control over armed forces was lying in the hands of the king. He sent orders marked with his seal (guoxi åç½), and generals were given tallies as a proof of their dependence from the king. The tallies were of bronze, had the shape of a tiger (thus called hufu èç¬¦) and consisted of two parts. One part was remaining in the hands of the king, while with the other, a general could verify that he was a commander on a legitimate mission.\n\nThe oldest known case of the use of seals was in 544 in the state of Lu (Guoyu åèª, Luyu é­¯èª). In the civilian administration, seals were very common during the Warring States period. Yet even if seals are mentioned in transmitted texts, no Zhou-period seal was found to date.\n\nEven if the kings of the Warring States wielded great power, their decisions were not autocratic. Each day, a morning audience was carried out during which the king discussed political issues with his ministers, and made a decision. In 306, for instance, Shang Yang advocated reform, and fiercely disputed with Gan Long çé¾ and Du Zhi ææ¯ the advantages of administrative changes. In 303, King Huai of Chu listened to the vivid debates of his ministers about an alliance with Qi against Qin. Apart from regular audiences, the kings might convoke extraordinary meetings to discuss urgent matters, like in 318, when counsellor Zou Ji debated with the generals Tian Ji ç°å¿ and Sun Bin å­«è at the court of Qi about relief troops for Han. In other cases, the sovereign conferred with individual persons before bringing the matter to the court or deciding directly, like King Wuling of Zhou, who first heard counsellor Fei Yi's è¥ç¾© opinion about the adoption of \"barbarian\" clothes for the cavalry of Zhao, and then with counsellor Lou Huan æ¨ç·©.\n\nThe decisions of a king were proclaimed as case-related edicts (ling ä»¤, ming å½, or gao å), or as general laws (lÃ¼ å¾).\n\nCentral governments and local administration in the Eastern Zhou\n\nThe executive part of the government in each regional state was led by a counsellor-in-chief, who was variously called taizai å¤ªå®° (at the royal court), xiang ç¸ (in Qi), yuanshuai å å¸¥ (actually \"supreme commander\", in Jin), dangguo ç¶å (in Zheng), lingyin ä»¤å°¹ (Prime Minister, in Chu), or zhizheng å·æ¿ \"regent\". The Counsellor-in-chief was either appointed directly by the sovereign, or the office was taken over by a functionary in the military field, like in Jin, or in turn by several high dignitaries (who were concurrently ministers of the one or other 'ressort'), like in Lu. Confucius, for instance, was concurrently counsellor, and Minister of Justice, sikou; Hua Yuan è¯å  in Song was Chief Counsellor and Commander to the Right (youshi å³å¸«), and Zihan å­ç½ concurrently Minister of Works (sicheng å¸å, a title only used in Song). In some instances, counsellors in office recommended a successor to the sovereign, as is the case with Guan Zhong, who was recommended by Bao Shu Ya é®åç. Yet in some states, the office of counsellor was inheritable, as in Wei è¡, where the family Ning å¯§ held the post for seven generations. In Lu and Jin, the office rotated between just a few noble families.\n\nCounsellors-in-chief were entrusted with civilian, ceremonial, fiscal, judicial, and military matters and had therefore to master fields with different challenges. Their subordinated collaborators were the \"Minister of the Masses\" (situ), who was responsible for military and labour conscription with the help of household registers; the Minister of War (sima; in Chu being vice counsellor) was responsible for military organization, and in some states also received military command; the Minister of Works (sikong, in inscriptions called sigong å¸å·¥) was responsible for construction work (buildings, roads, city wallsâin Song therefore called sicheng) and cadastral matters. The Minister of Justice (sikou; in Jin called li ç, in Chu called sibai å¸æ, at the royal court called weishi å°æ°) was responsible for justice and public security. The Messenger (xingren è¡äºº, or daxing å¤§è¡, senior messenger) was responsible for receiving guests and managing diplomatic matters.\n\nWith the development of written law codes during the Spring and Autumn period, the position of the Minister of Justice rose (Li 2008: 253-254).\n\nIn the royal household, the offices of the Three Dukes (Grand Commander, Grand Guardian, Grand Preceptor) were still important, as was the office of provisioner (shanfu). Yet in the regional states, the titles taifu, taishi and taibao were purely honorific, and did not entail power. The office of Minister of Rites (zongbo å®ä¼¯), who was responsible for the ancestral sacrifices, had only high importance in the state of Lu. The other states appointed *ancestral supplicators (zhuzong ç¥å®) or ancestral intendants (zongren å®äºº). While the royal household retained grand scribes (taishi) and interior scribes (neishi), the regional rulers had only grand scribes to record and archive documents, apart from Chu, whose king had a left scribe (zuoshi å·¦å², and perhaps also a right one).\n\nThe scribe was important for the moral uprightness of historiographical accounts. When Cui Zhu å´æ¼ killed Duke Zhuang of Qi é½èå ¬ (r. 553-548), the Grand Scribe recorded this fact correctly, and was killed by the regicide for his sincerity. In another case, Grand Scribe Dong Gu è£ç erroneously noted down that Zhao Dun è¶ç¾ (and not Zhao Chuan è¶ç©¿) had killed the duke of Jin, with the consequence that Dun had to flee.\n\nThe superintendents of the ducal households were often entrusted with diplomatic missions to other states or the Zhou court in Chengzhou (Luoyang). In the state of Song, there was also a minor superintendent, and in Wei è¡, responsibility was divided between left and right supervisors.\n\nThe regional rulers also relied on diviners (buren åäºº, bushi åå£«, in Chu called buyin åå°¹). The masters of the households were called pu dafu åå¤§å¤« (in Chu called sigong å¸å®®, and a eunuch). As music was an important ritual and ceremonial feature at the courts of the king and the regional rulers, the sovereigns were served by music masters (dashi å¤§å¸«) and dance masters (wushi èå¸«).\n\nThe domains in the regional states were administered in the same way as during the Western Zhou period, with a difference between dependencies of the lord's seat (guo å, like \"ducal domain\", or \"marquisate's domain\"), and 'public land' beyond the royal domain, and belonging to the state (ye é or bi é). In the state of Qi, counsellor Guan Zhong carried out a more systematic approach and created four levels of administration in the inner domains and five in the outer domains and determined administrators. This arrangement was combined with the possibility to draft males for labour and military service. Five townships obeyed a commander (shuai å¸¥).\n\nTable 3.

Rare transmitted sources (Yizhoushu é¸å¨æ¸, ch. Zuo Luo ä½é; Zuozhuan, Aigong åå ¬ 2) refer to three levels of administration, namely district (xian), sub-district (jun é¡; later known as 'commandery'), and community (bi é). Districts were directly managed by the central government, which appointed grand masters (in Chu called gong å ¬ or yin å°¹) to supervise them.\n\nMembers of the noble houses inside regional states had their own household management, headed by managers (yizai éå®°), who were assisted by horse supervisors (mazheng é¦¬æ­£), construction supervisors (gongshi å·¥å¸«) and house officials (jiachen å®¶è£). Confucius' disciple Zilu å­è·¯, for instance, was household manager (zai) of the family Jisun.\n\nNot all polities of the Warring States followed the same pattern of change in the course of the centralization of politics, and therefore, terms and procedures differed from each other.\n\nThe most important functionary of the central governments of the Warring States was the Counsellor-in-chief, in Chu called lingyin (Prime Minister), and in the other states variously xiang, xiangbang ç¸é¦ (in Han-period sources called xiangguo ç¸å, in order to avoid the private name of the dynastic founder, Liu Bang åé¦), chengxiang ä¸ç¸, zaixiang å®°ç¸, zhongzai å¢å®°, and similarly. The person of the Counsellor-in-chief was, since the Spring and Autumn period, so important that he was close to be a regent (zhizheng) for the king.\n\nThe state of Qin created in 309 the office of chengxiang, and this became the common term in the early imperial period. The office was first divided into two positions, namely the Counsellor to the Left (zuo chengxiang ä½ä¸ç¸) Chuli Ji æ¨éç¾ (Chulizi æ¨éå­), and the Counsellor to the Right (you chengxiang å³ä¸ç¸) Gan Mao çè.\n\nThe Counsellor was an advisor to the sovereign and head of the \"hundred state officials\" (baiguan ç¾å®, liebaiguan åç¾å®). He had the right to choose and evaluate the head of each department, to determine the jurisdiction of duties of each position, recommend individuals for reward and promotion, or for applying discipline. The only field the Counsellor was not relevant was the military. In the state of Qin, for instance, Marquis Rang was given the supreme command as General-in-chief (shang jiangjun ä¸å°è», or the antiquated term da sima å¤§å¸é¦¬). In the states of Chu and Zhao, the General-in-chief was also called \"pillar of state\" (guozhu åæ±), a term otherwise reserved for the Counsellor-in-chief. Yet in some cases, the positions were mixed. Lin Xiangru èºç¸å¦, for instance, was Counsellor and general.\n\nFinancial affairs were regulated by the Chamberlain (neishi å §å², the former \"grand scribe\"), like Xu Yue å¾è¶ in Zhao. The term neishi is also used in the QinlÃ¼ ç§¦å¾ code. The neishi was responsible for collecting the revenues of the current and calculating those of the coming year (Wang & Yang 1996: 594), the breeding of horses and other domestic animals in the districts, reports on construction work, and the official belongings and finance of local administration units. The neishi in Qin was supported by subordinated officials like the chamberlain for the treasury (danei å¤§å §; responsible for metal objects), *chamberlain for currencies (shaonei å°å §; responsible for monetary policy), the chamberlain for the granaries (taicang å¤ªå; responsible for grain and cattle), and others. In Zhao, taxes were managed by the master of the field department (tianbuli ç°é¨å).\n\nOfficial construction work and state manufactures were supervised by the Minister of Works (sikong or sigong; in Chu called dagongyin å¤§å·¥å°¹). In the state of Yan, there were a Left and Right Minister of Works, responsible for the casting of bronze weapons (in Chu called tongguan é å®), left and right arsenal masters (kugongshi åº«å·¥å¸«), left and right pottery masters (taoyin é¶å°¹; in Qi called taozheng é¶æ­£). In Qin, there was an office of iron master (tieguan éµå®).\n\nJudicial matters, mainly penal law, was managed by the Minister of Justice (sikou, in Qi called shishi å£«å¸« or zhifa å·æ³; in Qin called tingwei å»·å°; sometimes called dali å¤§ç).\n\nDiplomatic relations with other states were managed by messengers (xingren; in Qi called zhuke ä¸»å®¢), but in case of need, diplomats or 'ambassadors' (shizhe ä½¿è ) were sent which were appointed according to the circumstances. Guests in the royal palaces were received and entertained by a special official called receptionist (yezhe è¬è ).\n\nIn the local administration, the order of xian and jun was turned around, with jun (then called \"commandery\") becoming the larger unit of administration. Wei é­ was the first state who created the unit of jun as the highest in the local administration, perhaps in the late 4th century. The reversal of the denomination might be derived from the position of the old (smaller) jun units in peripheral regions located in the direction of other states. Administrative units in border regions were usually larger. The growth of the population in these regions made perhaps necessary the creation of sub-units in these jun, for which the traditional term xian was used (Wang & Yang 1996: 541). Newly conquered territory, be it that from other states, or territory outside the 'Zhou empire' like the Sichuan Basin, was usually administered in commanderies. The English term reflects the military status of this type of administrative unit. The only state not using the term jun was Qi, a state divided into five regions (du é½).\n\nWhile practically all states transformed the largest part of their territories into bureaucratically administered commanderies, districts (xian) were made the lowest bureaucratic unit on the local level, in Qin side by side with dao é, units inhabited by non-Zhou population. The number of districts per commandery ranged from 15 to more than 30. The authorities discerned between small, mid-size, and large districts. Below the district level, there were various units in the individual states like townships (xiang é), settlement clusters (ju è), villages (li é), hamlets (zhou å·), settlements (yi é), or areas (du é½).\n\nThe administrators of commanderies were called governors (shou å® or taishou å¤ªå®), while in Qi, the unit of du was governed by a region grand master (du dafu é½å¤§å¤«). Districts were administered by magistrates (ling ä»¤ or xianling ç¸£ä»¤; in the Qin code called sefu åå¤«), assisted by vice magistrates (cheng ä¸), military commanders (wei å°), cavalry commanders (sima å¸é¦¬), and construction officers (sikong å¸ç©º). On the township (xiang) level, there were petty officials called township heads (xiangzhu éä¸»), on the village (li) level village elders (lidian éå ¸), and else.\n\nThe existence of these administrative units does not mean that the whole territory was owned by the state. There were still the royal domain and that of the princes and the nobility, as well as the \"salary fields\" of the various officials. Moreover, a new title of nobility was introduced in the Warring States period, namely jun å, usually translated as \"lord\". The most famous bearers of this title were Wei Yang è¡é (Lord of Shang åå, therefore called Shang Yang åé ), Zhang Yi (Lord of Wuxin æ­¦ä¿¡å), Wei Ran é­å (Lord of Rang, better known as Marquis Rang ç©°ä¾¯), Huang Xie é»æ­ (Lord of Chunshen æ¥ç³å), Zhao Sheng è¶å (Lord of Pingyuan å¹³åå), Tian Wen ç°æ (Lord of Mengchang å­åå), or general Yue Yi (Lord of Chang æåå). The lords were bestowed territory to live of, but had no jurisdictional or military rights over their territories, and had limited rights of inheritance (three generations at the longest).\n\nRecruitment, ranking, and payment of state officials\n\nIn the first century or so of the Western Zhou period, offices were handed down on the base of heritage. Yet from the mid-Western Zhou period on the king appointed more officials from non-hereditary sources than before. Even hereditary officials could have no guarantee that they could serve in their father's office. The appointment practice of the Western Zhou government was established on the idea that all social elites could somehow participate in the administration of the empire. Promotion was a practice to reward those performing good, for instance, by first giving an assistant post to learn practice, and later promoting them to senior posts. Personal merit (mieli èæ­·) was thus an important factor apart from affiliation (Li 2008: 230).\n\nOfficials could also be promoted horizontally across administrative divisions, and in both the civilian and military realm. Late Western Zhou officials thus constituted a body of professional bureaucrats (Li 2008: 233). The title shi å¸« for instance, usually seen as \"marshal\", was perhaps a title born by ex-officers serving in civilian positions.\n\nThe states of the Spring and Autumn period relied on three means to recruit their personnel, first, on a hereditary basis (shizhi ä¸è·), second, recommendation, and third, schooling.\n\nOffices handed down on a hereditary base were, for instance, the diviner (guanshi è§æ°) and musician (zhongshi éæ°) in Chu, or the recorders (jishi ç±æ°) in Jin. The salary (lu ç¥¿) of officials consisted of land (caiguo éå, caiyi éé), yet while the land was bequeathed to offspring, it was not always the case that the office was passed on to a son. In the case of \"hereditary offices\" (shiguan ä¸å®), the office was passed on, in the case of \"hereditary position\" (shizhi ä¸è·) it was not.\n\nThe result of this practice was that the highest state offices remained in the hands of just a few families, like Guo å, Gao é«, Chen é³, and Bao é® in the state of Qi; Hua è¯, and Yue æ¨ in the state of Song; Sun å­« and Ning ç¯ in the state of Wei; the six families monopolizing the offices of ministers-commander (Liuqing å ­å¿) in the state of Jin; the seven families descending from Duke Mu é­ç©å ¬ (Qimu ä¸ç©) in the state of Zheng; and the three families descending from Duke Huan é­¯æ¡å ¬ (Sanhuan ä¸æ¡) in the state of Lu. These families had not just great political influence, but had also great wealth. In many instances, they supported each other against common enemies, like the Three Huan in Lu, or fought against each other, like the Six Qing in Jin that were in the end reduced to three families (Sanjin ä¸æ), which finally divided the state of Jin among them.\n\nThe oldest commonly known example of recommendation is Bao Shu Ya's suggestion to Duke Huan of Qi to make Guan Zhong his counsellor. In Chu, Ziwen å­æ recommended Ziyu å­ç as counsellor, and in Qin, Baili Xi ç¾éå¥ suggested to Duke Mu to choose Jian Shu è¹å his counsellor. Qi Xi ç¥å¥ in the state of Jin recommended first his own adversary Jie Hu è§£ç for the post of commander in the Central Army (zhongjun wei ä¸­è»å°), but when Jie died, Qi Xi recommended his own son Qi Wu ç¥å. The state of Qi introduced a system of threefold selection (sanxuan ä¸é¸) consisting of a selection on the district level (xiangxuan éé¸), by the head of the office the candidate might be eligible to (guanxuan å®é¸), and finally the selection by the sovereign himself (junxuan åé¸) (Guoyu, ch. Qiyu é½èª; Guanzi, ch. Xiaokuang å°å¡).\n\nSovereigns occasionally appointed foreign consultants to high offices, just after having considered the usefulness of their plans, like Shang Yang in Qin, or Wu Qi in Chu.\n\nAll sons of the nobility from all levels, down to the servicemen, were educated in schools where they were trained in civil and military matters, namely rites, music, writing, calculating, archery, and steering a chariot (see liuyi å ­è \"the six skills\"). Confucius had perhaps founded the first private school to train the scions of noble houses (Wang & Yang 1996: 485).\n\nMengzi (ch. Wan Zhang B) speaks of five ranks (jue çµ) of the nobility, namely the Son of Heaven, duke (gong å ¬), marquesses (hou ä¾¯), earls (bo ä¼¯), as well asâon the same rank levelâviscount (zi å­) and baron (nan ç·); and of six ranks of offices, namely the sovereign (jun å), ministers (qing å¿), grand masters (dafu å¤§å¤«), superior servicemen (shangshi ä¸å£«), average servicemen (zhongshi ä¸­å£«), and inferior servicemen (xiashi ä¸å£«). The state of Chu knew ten ranks of nobility (Zuozhuan, Zhaogong 7), namely the king (wang ç), dukes (gong å ¬), grand masters (dafu å¤§å¤«), servicemen (shi å£«), *menials (zao ç), charioteers (yu è¼¿), *servants (li é¸), *attendants (liao å), *footmen (pu å), *servitors (tai å°), cavalry commanders (yu å), and overseers of cattle herds (mu ç§).\n\nThe state of Qin introduced a ladder of 20 ranks bestowed for military honours (see ershideng jue äºåç­çµ). The designations of the ranks are derived from the old Western Zhou terms (like dafu), the military field (like shuzhang åº¶é· \"chief of a host\" or yougeng å³æ´ \"right member of the watch\"), and also from the ducal workshops (like shangzao ä¸é \"producer for the ruler\"). The four highest ranks were All-Penetrating Marquis (chehou å¾¹ä¾¯), Marquis within the Passes (guanneihou éå §ä¾¯), Great Chief of a Host (da shuzhang å¤§åº¶é·), and Senior Producer for the Ruler (da shangzao å¤§ä¸é ).\n\nThe appointment of high officials was made by pronouncing ordinances (ming å½). The higher the office, the 'heavier' the ordinance, for instance \"the duke ordered XY with a threefold ordinance Commander of the Central Army\" (gong yi san ming ming XY jiang zhongjun å ¬ä»¥ä¸å½å½æå°ä¸­è»). The 'number' of ordinances was also expressed in the size of the residence, the type of carts, banners, robes and hats of an official, as well as in the number of music instruments (bells and drums) and of ritual vessels a dignitary was allowed to make use of. The rank of office was also seen in the salary, i.e. the size of fields. A minister (qing) had salary fields with a size of 50,000 mu (Wang & Yang 1996: 488), able to nourish 500 persons, and a superior grand master (shang dafu) salary fields of 10,000 mu. A grand master might live from a district (xian), a serviceman from a sub-district (jun é¡). The salary field of a grand master included one or several settlements, so-called salary settlements (luyi ç¥¿é) of office settlements (guanyi å®é; see also salary fields). In the late Warring States period, salary in kind (fengsu å¥ç², zhisu è´ç²) was introduced in some states, for instance, Lu, and Wei é­.\n\nThe Zhouli (part Diguan å°å®, ch. Xiang dafu éå¤§å¤«) prescribed that at the end of each year, district grand masters (xiang dafu) in the royal domain submit a report of their work. It was evaluated every three years in a \"great matching\" (dabi å¤§æ¯). \"Worthies\" (xianzhe è³¢è ) and \"competent persons\" (nengzhe è½è ) were promoted, while evildoers were punished or even executed (part Diguan, ch. Da situ, Xiao situ å°å¸å¾). The variables evaluated were civilian instruction of the people (ping jiaozhi å¹³ææ²»), performance in administrative matters (zheng zhengshi æ­£æ¿äº), the size of the population and the number of houses (kao fuwu èå¤«å±), as well as the condition of the six types of domestic animals and of weapons. Similar procedures of evaluation are described in the book Guanzi (ch. Xiaokuang), concerning the state of Qi.\n\nThe age of retirement (zhishi è´ä», zhishi è´äº, qinglao è«è) was seventy sui (Liji, ch. Quli). Retired officials were called \"elders of the state\" (guolao åè).\n\nLegal system\n\nTransmitted sources speak of a legal code of nine chapters (xingshu jiupian åæ¸ä¹ç¯) or \"nine punishments\" (jiu xing ä¹å) of the early Zhou. While the cipher 9 might stand for a number of chapters, it might also refer to nine types of punishments, as Zheng Xuan's é­ç (127-200) commentary on the Shangshu (ch. LÃ¼xing åå) holds: tattooing (mo å¢¨), cutting off the nose (yi å), cutting off the knee caps or feet (yue å), castration (gong å®®), and the death penalty (dapi å¤§è¾, see Five Punishments), as well as banishment (liu æµ), monetary redemption (shu è´), lashes with the whip (bian é­), and beating with the stick (pu æ²).\n\nThese \"regular punishments\" (zhengxing æ­£å) are to be contrasted with eight \"consultative punishments\" (yixing è­°å, bayi å «è­°, babi å «è¾) which allowed the exemption from or reduction of punishment for certain persons, namely relatives of the king (qin è¦ª), friends of the king (gu æ ), \"worthies\" (xian è³¢), competent persons (neng è½), persons of merit (gong å), high nobles (gui è²´), diligent persons (qin å¤), and honoured guests (bin è³, or descendants of any of the former group).\n\nApart from such regular cases of exemption from common punishment, there might have been cases when the penal statutes were not appropriate to determine a correct punishment. In such cases, the delinquent was \"rectified\" by the five penalties (wu xing bu jian, zheng yu wu fa äºåä¸ç°¡ï¼æ­£æ¼äºç½°), which consisted of monetary payment, namely 100 huan é° (a monetary unit, see Zhou money) instead of tattooing, 200 for cutting off the nose, somewhat less (bei cha åå·®) for cutting off a foot, 600 for castration, and 1,000 for the death penalty. A further reduction of penalty was to reckon the charge among the \"five cases of error\" (wu guo äºé, i.e. misdoings in office). Yet in such a case the judges were guard against the influence of power, private grudge, female solicitation, bribes, or applications\n\nPunishments followed the \"principles of ritual\" (li ze ç¦®å), and were thus subject to strict procedures, among others, interviews of the claimant and the accused. The Shangshu chapter Kanggao explains that when both parties were present, with their documents and witnesses all complete, the judges listened to the fivefold statements (wuci äºè¾­, namely words, colour, respiration, ears, and eyes; Zhouli, part Qiuguan ç§å®, ch. Xiaosikou å°å¸å¯) that may be made. When they had examined and fully made up their minds on those, they adjusted the case.\n\nDuring the reign of King Mu, the penal code LÃ¼xing was created which listed allegedly 1,000 crimes to be punished with tattooing, 1,000 crimes for which the delinquent's nose was cut off, 500 crimes punished by cutting out the knee-cap or off the foot, 300 crimes punished by castration, and 200 crimes for which the death penalty was due. The code was created by the Marquis of LÃ¼ åä¾¯ (also called LÃ¼ Fu åç«). Its creation is described in the Shangshu chapter of the same name.\n\nApart from laws already existing (like the [putative] Xia code Shuxing è´å), new ones were promulgated by the Zhou kings, including the pre-dynastic ruler King Wen. Such promulgations are quoted in the Shangshu chapters Kanggao, Jiugao or Duoshi å¤å£«.\n\nThe chapter on the Minister of Justice (sikou) in the Zhouli explains that the rulers of regional states were punished according to three principles (sandian ä¸å ¸), namely lightly for young states, with a middle strictness for average states, and severely for states in disorder or rebellion. For each realm of function in the state, there were different criteria of assessment and five objectives which the Zhou hoped to fulfil with the help of punishments.\n\nQuotation 1. Control of the empire by punishment according to the Zhouli ä»¥äºåç³¾è¬æ°ï¼ä¸æ°éåï¼ä¸åç³¾åã [The government] controls the population by the five types of punishment. First, the punishment of the countryside for which the efforts [of the cultivators] are the criterion and by which physical forces are rectified. äºæ°è»åï¼ä¸å½ç³¾å®ã Second, the punishment of the army for which the [execution of] orders is the criterion and by which defence is rectified. ä¸æ°éåï¼ä¸å¾·ç³¾å­ã Third, the punishment of the districts for which moral conduct is the criterion and by which filial piety is rectified. åæ°å®åï¼ä¸è½ç³¾è·ã Fourth, the punishment of functionaries for which competence is the criterion and by which duties are rectified. äºæ°ååï¼ä¸æ¿ç³¾æ´ã Fifth, the punishment of the royal domain for which attention is the criterion and by which violence is checked.\n\nTranslation according to Biot, Vol. 2, 309.\n\nWith the help of punishments, the functionaries of the state were caused to serve the government at its best. Yet labourers were also tested for their performance. Peasants cultivating state-owned land or building roads, dykes, and temples, were strictly supervised by the government. The other people could be controlled by the instrument of appealing to \"virtuous\" or \"filial conduct\".\n\nThe most severe punishment was the extirpation of several generations, as was the case with the rebels Wu Geng, Guan Shu and Cai Shu. As \"virtue\" played an important role in the philosophical legitimacy of the Zhou dynasty (see Zhou philosophy), violation of principles as filiality were severely punished. Regional rulers might be decreased in their rank, or their territory reduced.\n\nThe same chapter of the Zhouli described the methods by which the Minister of Justice interviewed delinquents to find out more about the case (Wang & Yang 1996: 373). Delinquents were usually put into jail (huantu åå).\n\nGenerally seen, the penal law of the Zhou seemed to have been somewhat softer than that of the Shang which made use of cruel punishments as burning alive or cutting out the bowels (see Shang law). The Zhou kings therefore admonished their functionaries to use corporal punishments with caution and after deliberate consideration. All crimes, even lesser ones, were to be punished, but according to reasonable standards. The king warned his functionaries, \"deal reverently and intelligently in your infl"
