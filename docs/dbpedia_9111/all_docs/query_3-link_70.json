        "text": "1.1. Background\n\nHumanistic health is crucial to the physical living environment. One of the important issues in humanistic health is residents' pursuit of equity, including the equity of family property inheritance. Family culture is at the core of Chinese traditional culture, and the inheritance of family property is an important way of maintaining family continuity. Chinese family culture advocates the large family model of “many generations living together” (1–3). To avoid family friction and conflict caused by the existence of multiple interest centers in large families, most of them choose to divide up the family property after experiencing the development from small to large. In this way, family property is divided up equally according to the number of small families, which means that property ownership is redefined. Family division realizes the succession of new and old families through the transfer of property, power, and responsibility to ensure the reproduction of families and the continuity of Chinese families. As the concept of the house is male-oriented, the first condition for the existence of a house is that the ancestor must have several sons, and the daughters have no right of inheritance. The property is divided according to the number of sons (4). The formal division of family property is an important sign of family division, after which each son's family forms its own independent branches, inheriting the blood and property of the father equally and promoting the continuous development of the family.\n\nThe property inheritance system under Chinese family culture is characterized by primogeniture and “equal share for all sons”. In the major civilizations of the world, the main form of family continuity is primogeniture. Parents pass on their property to the eldest son, and the other children make a living in their own way and the family maintains an overall continuity. Therefore, the system is not “family division”. Primogeniture also existed in certain periods in Chinese society. During the Shang and Zhou dynasties, under the feudal system, primogeniture was the main form of inheritance, and the ruling power, the state, the people, and property were all included in the scope of inheritance. Therefore, primogeniture is more about the noble titles and the succession to the throne of the emperor (5). With the decline of the enfeoffment system and the hereditary system, the scope of inheritance of the legitimate eldest son in ancient China became narrower, and the common people generally gave an equal share to all the sons (6). Since the Qin and Han Dynasties, the important feature of the property inheritance system of the ancient Chinese family is that all the descendants inherit equally, no matter how much land and family property they owned (7). Due to the long-term implementation of the property inheritance system of an “equal share for all sons” and the stability of the farming environment, population growth in traditional Chinese society was rapid (8). The “equal share for all sons” system reverses the balance of the land concentration trend, playing a regulatory role in the excessive concentration of land (9). This situation shows that the way of household division represented by the “equal share for all sons” is a production and operation mode that is compatible with the level of social and economic development in the feudal era, and its emergence and popularization was a historical necessity (10). The equity of the “equal share for all sons” system can be illustrated by an interesting story. According to The Sequel to the Biography of Yan Lun of Wu,1 written by Wu Jun in Liang State of the Southern Dynasty, in the Han Dynasty, three brothers, Tian Zhen, Tian Qing, and Tian Guang, divided the family property and even divided the bauhinia tree in the courtyard. They cut the tree into three sections and gave one section to each family to show equity (11). This shows that, in traditional Chinese society, people were meticulous about the equity of family division and that equity was an important cornerstone of humanistic health and social stability.\n\nThe distribution of real estate property rights under the “equal share for all sons” system is not purely egalitarian. The overall balance should also be considered. This includes the equal distribution principles of “reducing more to replenish less”2 and “intersection and interpenetration”.3 Lao Tzu4 pointed out from the perspective of “Way of Heaven”5 that “reducing more to replenish less” (see text footnote 2) is the embodiment of social equity thought (12). In the distribution of real estate property, it refers to reducing the amount of real estate property to those who already have sufficient property and giving more to those who do not already own much real estate, thereby achieving balance and equity. Meanwhile, to maintain the stability of family settlements, a distribution strategy of “intersection and interpenetration” would be adopted in the distribution of the real estate to family members to promote interaction among the various household branches6 and make them look out for one another while ensuring that the number of rooms and the related factors are fairly distributed, thereby ensuring equity within the family. In practice, after family division, small families become independent production and consumption units. However, in daily production and life, each house branch still maintains close contact with the others in a state of “coexistence in separation”7 (2, 13). Therefore, it is very common for them to have a shared entity after the family property division. This is manifested in the form of the mutual intersection and interconnection of land ownership (14). In summary, this “intersection and interpenetration” (see text footnote 3) and the Taoist idea of “reducing more to replenish less” together constitute the equity of inheritance and the division of real estate property. It ensures the principle of equality, fairness, and justice in the process of family property division, and it constitutes a means of resource allocation under the system of an equal share for all sons, thereby forming China's traditional and unique family culture.\n\n“Family” space is an important carrier of family culture inheritance. It solidifies and embodies certain social norms and cultural customs (15). Space syntax provides a new method for exploring the deep cultural meaning of home space. Space syntax is a theory and method of studying the relationship between space organization and human society by quantifying the structure of human settlements, including buildings, settlements, cities, and even landscapes (16). The social and cultural logics carried by home space reflect the spatial and temporal attributes of home space, and the concentrated embodiment of the relationship between people and society. The application of space syntax to the family is called “space archaeology.” It defines rules in its spatial fabric from a large number of cross-cultural architectural plan studies and then analyzes whether these rules are systematically related to a specific cultural logic. On this basis, it infers various supports of home space for family life and organization methods and reveals the underlying social and cultural logic (17). Finding idiosyncratic genotypes has always been the focus of space syntax research on home spaces (18). In the early days of the establishment of space syntax, Hillier et al. analyzed the fabric characteristics of home space in rural areas of southern France using spatial connectivity, the RRA value, and the difference value. They summarized the genotypes of home space in southern France from the perspectives of social culture, behavior mode, and daily family activities (19). Orhun found that there are two different spatial models in Turkey: kitchen integration and living room integration. The difference in the syntactic dimensions of different models reflects the difference in the genotypes of houses. The existence and distribution of these genotypes of houses are closely related to the migration and integration of nomadic people in Turkey (20). Tao Wei and Ding Chuanbiao discussed whether the fabric and characteristics laws of different spaces correspond to certain cultural concepts and lifestyles. Their innovative research method could help reveal the deep cultural genotypes of home space (17). Ke et al. conducted a case study on the spatial form of traditional residential space in southern Sichuan by using spatial syntax to demonstrate that the unique environment of traditional residential space in southern Sichuan has created a complex and varied spatial form and a diversified mixture of human residence culture (21). In other words, in the home space, the occupation and use of the internal family spaces are closely related to the social culture of specific regions and nations.\n\nHome space has been deconstructed and reconstructed in different social periods. The exploration of the temporal attributes of space forms in cultural logic involves tracing the history of the space syntax of the home space and the transfer of culture (22). Bendik Ma-num selected 150 sample apartments constructed at different times after 1930 in Oslo, the capital of Norway, and compared the differences in the use of family internal space under different areas and spatial fabrics. The internal family space still has a very clear functional partition, and the integration of each functional space was significantly different. The research revealed that the diverse needs of people's lifestyles and family activities have not been satisfied in contemporary housing space design (23). Mustafa et al. applied the theory of spatial grammar in testing the spatial form of two types of housing layouts (traditional and modern) in Erbil city and detected the privacy level in their configuration through analysis and comparison (24). Yi et al. adopted space syntax to make an in-depth analysis of the process and logic of the practice of housing space at different stages of tourism development and found that the meaning of housing space is closely related to village community space and to even wider space. Housing space has completely exceeded the basic material category as a house, and its meaning generation depends on ethnic groups or villages in which individuals are closely connected. The construction of housing space meaning is multi-scale (25). Al-Mohannadi et al. used space syntax to conduct a comparative study of the space forms of traditional and contemporary Qatari houses, thereby promoting the development of traditional buildings based on social sustainability and urban renewal of the architectural environment (26). The above research shows that analyzing the evolution of spatial form and fabric in the process of housing evolution and exploring the evolution of the concept of family in the process of housing transformation is conducive to observing changes in society at the micro-scale. In summary, the application of space syntax to home spaces provides a new perspective for exploring the relationship between people and their living spaces.\n\nThe construction of a family space has a high degree of harmony with the natural environment, correspondingly generating many adaptive design methods and construction experiences aimed at adjusting the living environment. All buildings go through a process of continuous change and development. A successful building should promote this development through adaptability (27). Adaptive design is an active design method (28). Most buildings are still designed and built for specific purposes, with little consideration given to changing climate conditions or the future needs of residents (29). One of the challenges facing architectural development is the possibility of reconfiguring new space according to environmental changes and users' needs (30). Among many environmental factors, the light environment is one of the climatic conditions that can directly affect the building layout. El Zafarany et al. believed that the important factors affecting the lighting of a building include the internal and external light environment of the building, as well as the characteristics of the building itself (31), among which the external light environment is the basis for lighting analysis. In 1942, Moon took the lead in proposing a full overcast sky brightness distribution model based on a trigonometric function relationship (32). Subsequently, the International Commission on Illumination determined 15 sky-type models of relative brightness distribution based on the brightness data that were collected by scanning several places. Zhijia et al. studied the indoor light environment of a typical traditional residential building in Huizhou, China, from the comfort perspective, over a one-year on-site test and continuous monitoring of multiple indoor environmental parameters of a typical traditional residential building (33). Natural ventilation has always played an important role in residential buildings. The basic influencing factors of building ventilation include building orientation, natural wind, and building structure (34), among which natural wind includes seasonal wind and natural ventilation (35–37). Kleiven believed that natural ventilation mainly affects the layout and organization of external walls, roofs, and internal spaces (38). Gado selected the new Al-Minya urban buildings in Egypt as a case study to analyze the effectiveness of a natural ventilation mode in actual buildings. Aydin et al. applied Turkish architectural elements to improve the ventilation of residential buildings, studying the function and applicability of different architectural elements (39). Spentzou et al. found an effective way to solve the problem of energy-saving renovation of residential buildings in Greece by implementing renovation strategies with computational fluid dynamics simulation (40). Regarding local traditional Chinese buildings, Jihong conducted research on the energy-saving technology of traditional residential buildings in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and demonstrated that the building layout and structural form can reasonably organize air flow, which plays an important role in improving the indoor thermal environment (41). Hua investigated the ventilation status of traditional and modern residential buildings south of the Yangtze River and proposed a ventilation design strategy for residential buildings through numerical simulation (42). These studies have laid a foundation for the study of building ventilation and lighting analysis.\n\nAs mentioned above, home space contains the relationship between spatial form and social and cultural logic. It is also compatible with the natural environment. It is a microcosm of the human-land relationship. As a form of multi-scale and open home space (43), Chinese traditional residential buildings have a unique form of equity culture under the system of an equal share for all sons. They also represent the concept of the construction of residential buildings suitable for the natural environment, a valuable aspect of the heritage of Chinese traditional architectural culture.\n\n2.3. Framework\n\nThis study examined aspects of traditional Chinese culture, applying quantitative research to explore the equity of the distribution of traditional residential housing property rights. shows the main structure of the study. According to the arrangement of rooms, the structure is divided into two aspects. The first focuses on the natural unit indicator: the number of rooms in each area and the number of rooms with excellent lighting and ventilation quality. The second aspect is based on spatial topology and focuses on the overall spatial indicator and analyzes the characteristics of privacy, cultural centrality, and convenience of living in the overall location of the rooms.\n\nThe two indicators and six evaluation indices are described in this section. In terms of the natural unit indicator, this study found that there are as many as 316 rooms in Renhe Village. The number of rooms is important in the process of the property distribution of traditional residential buildings. The number of rooms and the quality of housing distribution determine the spatial form of the survival and reproduction of future generations. The physical attributes of lighting and ventilation are also important factors that determine the quality of rooms. In terms of the statistics of room locations, based on the quantity and location of rooms on each floor, this article studied the housing distribution strategy under traditional family culture, thereby analyzing the equity of the number of rooms in each household branch. This study also demonstrated the physical quality of room lighting and ventilation to determine the corresponding high-quality rooms. Finally, the equity of the natural unit indicator was proved through three evaluation indices: quantity, lighting, and ventilation.\n\nIn terms of the overall spatial indicator, the internal transportation of Renhe Village is complex. The internal living mode is combined with the lifestyle in the village, and the location of each room corresponds to different privacy, cultural centrality, and living convenience. Residential privacy (hereinafter referred to as “privacy”) is the basic demand of human beings in the life of each family unit. It is also a factor in the humanistic care of architecture for residents (50). The research on privacy is based on the average open horizon distance of the average housing unit of each household branch. This is taken as the privacy measurement standard. Cultural centrality (hereinafter referred to as “centrality”), meaning the ritual space at the core of architectural space, is selected as the midpoint. Traditional China is a ritualistic society. Therefore, there is a requirement for a cultural center for ritual activities in the residential space, a core ritual space for public affairs such as sacrifices, marriages, funerals, family meetings, and ceremonies. The main hall at Zheng Zuo10 is the geometric center of the plan pattern of the building complex and is the largest and highest-level building of all the single buildings (51). Therefore, the space distance between each room and the geometric center of the building is selected as the criterion of centrality. The main function of Renhe Village is living, and the convenience of transportation in the living process (hereinafter referred to as “convenience”) is one of the focuses of traditional residential housing distribution. The building entrance is an important node in the internal and external transportation link and the carrier of the transformation process between the internal and external spaces (52, 53). The stairs are not only a means of communication between the upper and lower floors but also form an entrance to the residential buildings (54). Therefore, in terms of convenience, the entrance is taken as the endpoint, and the average walking distance between each room and the entrance is counted as the criterion measuring convenience. It is worth noting that Renhe Village is a multi-story building. The distance residents go to reach the primary and secondary entrances is calculated as the evaluation criterion for the space on the first floor of the village. For the space above the first floor, the stairs are used as the entrance and exit to calculate the distance. Then, the distance from the position corresponding to the stairs on the first floor to the nearest entrance and exit is added. Therefore, the convenience of residents' internal and external transportation can be comprehensively analyzed. Finally, the three evaluation indices of privacy, cultural centrality, and convenience of living are taken as the influencing factors of the overall room indicator.\n\n4.1. Discussion\n\n4.1.1. Natural unit indicator\n\nFirst, according to the allocated number of rooms for each household branch, the equality idea of “reducing more to replenish less” is verified. The power order of traditional residential buildings has a linear correlation with the spatial layout, and the spatial layout hierarchical order decreases from the middle to both sides, from the inside to the outside, from the north to the south, and from the east to the west (57). Renhe Village is the central part of the traditional residential buildings and enjoys the highest status. Area 1 follows the hierarchical order of “Zheng Zuo > Zhong Zuo > Shang Zuo > Wei Zuo,” and Area 2 follows the hierarchical order of “East > West > Kuang Door” and “Interior Firewall > External Firewall.” Based on the number of levels, shows the statistics on the number of room areas by subdividing Area 1 and Area 2. Since the number of rooms in each household branch is different, the proportion of corresponding rooms in the total number of rooms of the household branch was selected as the criterion to judge the proportion of the number of rooms in the total number of individuals. The comparison of the total number of rooms at the first level shows that the proportion of the number of rooms in Ren Rooms at the first level to the total number of rooms is 47.62%, greater than that of the other two brothers' rooms. The proportion of the Yong Rooms at Level 1.5 is 7.84%, ranking first, and the proportion of the Zhi Rooms at Level 2 ranks first. Therefore, each of the three brothers occupies an advantage at one of the levels, meaning that the proportions are relatively balanced. In Area 1 on the second level, on the first and second floors, the number of rooms in Zhi Rooms and Ren Rooms in Zheng Zuo is 20, but Ren Rooms has the highest proportion of rooms among the three. The data in Zhong Zuo show that the number of rooms in the first and second levels of Zhi Rooms is 14.02%, the highest among the three. The data on Shang Zuo and Wei Zuo indicate that the total number and proportion of rooms in Yong Rooms is the highest among the three. In Zheng Zuo and Zhong Zuo, at higher levels, Zhi Rooms and Ren Rooms each occupy one, while Shang Zuo and Wei Zuo are spaces with lower levels, and Yong Rooms are compensated in quantity, thereby achieving a balance among the three. The data on Area 2 at the third level show that, in the whole building, the optimal number of rooms in the three household branches accounts for six areas, respectively. For example, there are 12 rooms in the east of Zheng Zuo on the first and second levels, one in Kuang Door, and eight in the east of Zhong Zuo. These six areas all have the largest number of rooms in the corresponding areas of the corresponding levels. There are 12 rooms in the west of Zheng Zuo at the first and second levels of Ren Rooms, 11 rooms in the west of Zhong Zuo, and six rooms in the east of Wei Zuo. These three areas have the largest number of rooms in the corresponding six areas of the corresponding levels. The three areas at the first level of Yong Rooms, namely Zhong Zuo, Shang Zuo, and Wei Zuo, correspond to Kuang Door, External Firewall, and the West. Yong Rooms has the largest number of areas in the Interior Firewall at Level 1.5 in Shang Zuo, which also has the largest number of rooms in Kuang Door at Zhong Zuo and West at Wei Zuo on the second level. Yong Rooms has the largest number of the six areas in total. The result shows that, in the process of room distribution, the number of rooms in one part of the area is large, and the number of rooms in the other part is correspondingly small, and vice versa, ultimately reflecting the fair distribution method of “reducing more to replenish less”.\n\nSecond, the allocation of rooms among the household branches fully demonstrates the principle of “intersection and interpenetration”. As the room distribution plan ( ) and the number of areas ( ) show, in terms of the number of rooms Zheng Zuo, Zhong Zuo, Shang Zuo, and Wei Zuo, the three branches account for part of each, and no single space is dominated by one branch. In addition, the proportion of rooms is relatively equal, and the rooms in each area are fairly distributed. For example, there are 12 rooms in the east of Zheng Zuo for Zhi Rooms on the first level, eight for Ren Rooms, and 10 for Yong Rooms. The average number of rooms in this area is 10. In the west, there are seven for Zhi Rooms, 12 for Ren Rooms, and nine for Yong Rooms, an average of eight in this area. Near Kuang Door, there is one room for Zhi Rooms, zero for Ren Rooms, and zero for Yong Rooms. In the final statistics, there are 20 rooms for Zhi Rooms and Ren Rooms, and 19 for Yong Rooms. On the whole, the number of rooms for each is practically the same. The same is true for other areas. Irrespective of the number of single-area spaces or the overall areas in Zheng Zuo, the quantity of rooms is relatively equal without a significant difference. Each area penetrates into the other, and each household branch has rooms in each area of the building, thereby ensuring the overall equity of the physical attributes of lighting and ventilation in the rooms of each household branch.\n\nIn short, in terms of the natural unit indicator, the equity of housing property distribution in Renhe Village takes into account not only the number of rooms but also the number of rooms with reasonable physical attributes of lighting and ventilation. The results of the Renhe Village room distribution ( ) showed that the number of rooms for Zhi Rooms is 107, the number of rooms with good lighting quality in Ren Rooms is 39, and the total number of rooms with good ventilation quality in Yong Rooms is 42, all of which are the optimal values of the corresponding attributes. Hence, each of the three household branches has the best proportion in the corresponding overall number of rooms, and the number of rooms with good lighting and ventilation, thereby achieving balance in the equity of the natural unit indicator among the three household branches.\n\n4.1.2. Overall spatial indicator\n\nData simulation analysis revealed that equity is shown in the distribution of housing property rights in Renhe Village in the overall spatial indicator (privacy, centrality, and convenience). As shows, the privacy value refers to the average distance of the visible area of each room. A smaller privacy value means that the room can be viewed in a small range, indicating a higher degree of privacy. The privacy value of Zhi Rooms is 224.728 m, the lowest among the three rooms; therefore, it has the highest degree of privacy. The centrality value of Ren Rooms is 25.101 m, meaning that the average distance from Ren Rooms to the center is the shortest and the centrality is the strongest. The convenience value of Yong Rooms is 27.389 m, smaller than the 30.163 m of Zhi Rooms and the 28.194 m of Ren Rooms, indicating that the distance to the entrance and exit is the shortest, making it most convenient for Yong Rooms. In short, when allocating the rooms, each of the three household branches occupies an optimal value for the three evaluation indices of the overall spatial indicator, and the allocation is very balanced. Therefore, it can be inferred that, in terms of the overall spatial indicator, the distribution of property rights in Renhe Village is equitable.\n\n4.1.3. Equity evaluation model\n\nThe model equation for evaluating the equity of housing property distribution was based on the above discussion of the results for equity. The study established a computational model for quantifying fairness by branching qualitative overall existence and local fairness. The calculation method used the specific values of different branch attributes of each house faction to establish the matrix equation. The joint cubic equation to find the proportion of each coefficient can be obtained from one set of coefficient solutions. The model was based on the natural unit indicator and the overall spatial indicator, and the final balance coefficient was obtained according to the research data.\n\n(1) Natural unit indicator (Par): The unit indicator value of equity that represents the number of rooms in an individual building space, the number of rooms with good lighting quality, and the number of rooms with good ventilation. The model can be expressed as Formula (1):\n\nPar=β1Qua+β2Day+β3Win,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Qua represents the number of rooms, Day represents the number of rooms with good lighting quality, and Win represents the number of rooms with good ventilation. Their units are constant n. Renhe Village is taken as representative, and β1:β2:β3≅ 0:1:2.\n\nDuring the construction and distribution of traditional Chinese residential buildings, attention was paid to the quality of room ventilation. However, the structural trend is characterized by a scarcity of ventilation and lighting resources. During the division of property, one room with good ventilation is equivalent to two rooms with good lighting. Renhe Village is a building with a patio. The 1:2 distribution ratio is defined based on the ventilation and lighting characteristics of the architectural structure of Renhe Village and can be applied to architectural spaces of the same type. Therefore, it can be further understood that the ancients did not require a high degree of lighting but regarded ventilated rooms as a more scarce and comfortable space.\n\n(2) Overall spatial indicator (Int): Based on the average spatial distance of the room in each household branch, the relationship between the privacy, centrality, and convenience of the rooms and the overall building was studied. The model can be expressed as Formula (2):\n\nInt=α1Pri+α2Cen+α3Con,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Pri is privacy, Cen represents centrality value, Con represents convenience value, and their units are distance in meters. Renhe Village is taken as representative, and α1:α2:α3 ≅ 2.62:1:4.23.\n\nThe ancients placed the most value on room centrality, followed by privacy and convenience. They also paid more attention to the traditional ritual hierarchy than anything else. Renhe Village is a space where a large family lived together; therefore, the privacy aspect was a minor consideration. Moreover, diligence and simplicity are typical characteristics of traditional Chinese farmers. Therefore, their requirements for convenience were low.\n\nEquity is judged according to the direct comparison among brothers. Par1 and Par2 are used for the natural unit indicator. The overall spatial indicator of two brothers is represented by Int1and Int2. The more the final absolute value of equity approaches 1, the more equitable the distribution is between the two brothers. Its model can be expressed as Formula (3):\n\n|Par1||Par2|→1|Int1||Int2|→1\n\n(3)\n\nWith the increase in the number of participants in the family property division, the equity of the natural unit indicator becomes Par1, Par2, Par3, Par4, Par5, Par6, etc., accordingly, and the demonstration parameters of the equity of the overall spatial indicator can be increased to Int1, Int2, Int3, Int4, Int5, Int6 etc. Therefore, regardless of the number of research objects, the formula can provide a certain test standard of equity for building allocation.\n\n|Int1||Int2|→|Int2||Int3|......|Intn||Intn+1|→1|Par1||Par2|→|Par2||Par3|......|Parn||Parn+1|→1\n\n(4)\n\nTaking Renhe Village as an example, under the guidance of formulas, when the houses are redistributed with functional property rights, the newly divided property rights should meet the establishment of Formula (4), and the equitable distribution of the house property can be reasonably calibrated. The equity formula in the Renhe Village model can also be used as a reference for modern housing distribution."
