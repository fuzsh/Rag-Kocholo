        "text": "a. The Japanese converts to Christianity staged a successful revolt that overthrew the Tokugawa Shogunate. b. With only a few exceptions, this policy isolated Japan, closed its borders to foreigners, and kept the Japanese people from leaving the islands. c. The Ming Dynasty sided with the Christian missionaries and engaged the Shogunate in a war. d. The successor of Iemistu, Nobunaga, converted to Christianity and made it the official religion of the Shogunate. a. The Zhou court lost much of its military power, and states in the Zhou confederation began to go to war with one another. b. The aristocracy took on a smaller role in the government of states. c. Tensions arose between the inner court (a ruler’s family and servants) and the outer court (the place where the business of the state was conducted). d. All of the above. a. The dynasty believed in a monotheistic religion that worshipped the Sun. b. The dynasty began with a virtuous and heroic leader and ended with a tyrannical leader being overthrown by the people. c. The dynasty witnessed the sharing of power between the Manchus and the Hans. d. Mongols invaded the region and set up their own dynasty, subjecting the Chinese to their rule. a. He must maintain the harmony and link in the cosmic order between heaven and the human sphere. b. He is a responsible and just ruler. c. He looks out for the welfare of the people under his domain. d. All of the above. a. While originally centered in the Yellow River region, these three societies migrated to the coast, where they utilized bronze tools and relied on fishing for sustenance. b. Based on the agricultural surplus allowed by the annual floods of the Indus River, these three societies prospered by planting rice and wheat, and through the use of iron tools. c. By terracing the mountainous slopes north of the Yellow River, these societies survived by hunting game supplemented with limited cultivation of millet using stone and wooden tools. d. These societies developed on the banks of the Yellow River, primarily cultivated millet, utilized stone and bone tools, and created various types of painted and unpainted pottery. a. He excels in his speech, is modest in his actions, and is often insincere. b. He wants to see clearly, hear distinctly, practice righteousness, and be a virtuous man above all else. c.

A young man who carefully maps out his goals and ambitions and establishes a practical plan of achieving them. b. A rich man who lives spontaneously, spending large amounts of money on goods and services that make him happy. c.

A woman who strives to live in moderation, without planning or materialistic desires. a. Both schools laid out a clear and delineated plan for the establishment of a new governing dynasty. b. These philosophies gave people different methods by which to contemplate their lives and navigate the universe amidst the chaos of the time period. c. Daoism and Confucianism both situated the universe as a duality of good and evil, and encouraged followers to seek one extreme or the other in their actions. d. Both philosophies emphasized a deep belief in a benevolent god who could save the Chinese people from the destructive forces of war. a. The Qin standardized coinage, and weights and measures, and divided up their territory into forty-two administrative districts that have remained roughly the same in modern China. b. The Qin legal code, which included harsh punishments such as dismemberment for minor offenses, was adopted by the Han and other successive dynasties due to its great popularity with the Chinese people. c. The Qin view of history as something that could be harmful and should not be relied upon by present students led the Han and other dynasties to abandon their emphasis on the Zhou Dynasty texts and instead focus students on learning from current events. d. All of the above. a. His economic policies were so successful that his brief dynasty attracted the attention of the Mongols, who invaded the capital and killed Mang, but were eventually driven out by Mang’s supporters, who called themselves the Red Eyebrows. b. Mang conquered much of the Xiongnu territory and successfully redistributed the captured land to the gentry class, angering the poor. c. His failed military campaigns against the Xiongnu and his poorly executed attempts at redistributing land and instituting social welfare programs angered the aristocrats, and later the majority of the population. d. He attempted to revert back to the Legalist policies of the Qin and banned all practice of Confucian teachings. a. Society is evenly split between people who are inherently good and evil. The Qin preferred nonaction, rather than punishment or reward, as a means of motivating their subjects. b. All people are inherently good and should not be punished in any way, as it will be to the detriment of society. The Qin benevolently treated their subjects. c. All people are inherently evil and will only contribute to society as a whole if it means that their own self-interests will be served. The Qin ruthlessly used punishment as a means of correcting the behavior of their people. d. The Qin relied on a group of scholar-kings known as the junzi to run the day-to-day bureaucratic affairs of the state. a. Despite its persuasive ideals, Buddhism failed to win over the Tang court. It was not until the Song Dynasty that Buddhism gained in popularity and became the official Chinese religion. b. The Tang court forced all Chinese to convert to Buddhism and permanently eradicated Confucian teaching until the rise of the Qing Dynasty. c. While the Tang court encouraged the spread of Buddhism, Confucianism experienced a rise in popularity when the Song took power. Although later dynasties relied on Confucian principles, Buddhism did not disappear entirely. d. Tang intellectuals synthesized Confucian and Buddhist principles into a new religion known as Legalism, which would go on to dominate Chinese thought for the next millennium. a. The Daodejing and other Daoist texts and lessons offered by Lao-Tzu. b. The wisdom offered by classical Chinese texts, most notably the Book of Songs, the Book of Rites, and other Zhou Dynasty texts. c. The Legalist philosophies of Han Feizi and his followers. d. You would not need to study anything. Song bureaucrats were appointed through family and aristocratic connections, so there was no way to prove your worthiness to the court. a. Advancements in agricultural technologies helped Song farmers to become commercial, rather than self-sufficient, farmers. b. A dramatic boost in trade and specialization by urban merchants increased the monetary supply and necessitated the use of paper money during the Song Dynasty. c. Used in a myriad of objects from armor, to tools, to statues, iron production grew sixfold during the period, fueling the Song economy in multiple ways. d. All of the above. a. A Nestorian Christian missionary engaged in discussion with a Buddhist monk outside an elaborate Daoist temple. b. Explosives, and cannons and other firearms, used by soldiers for military purposes. c. A market in the western part of the city full of Asian fruits and vegetables, as well as Indian spices and traders from abroad. d.

Its dominance persisted until the Mongol invasions in the twelfth century CE finally ended the Sui reign. b.

The Yuan failed to protect the trade routes, and hordes of roving bandits took a heavy toll on merchant caravans, inciting the merchant and artisan classes to rebel against the Mongols. c. The new summer capital of Shangdu utilized large amounts of conscript labor.

Gunpowder was first described in Europe in 1423 CE in Germany, and may have come via traders in Persia and Egypt. b.

Spices were transported via ships, while goods such as porcelain and silk continued to be sent exclusively by land routes because they were considered delicate cargo. b. Caravans along the Silk Road traveled long distances in often-hostile territory, therefore limiting traders to carrying only small quantities of luxury goods. With the advent of sea trading, larger quantities and assortments of goods could be exchanged. c. The demand for gunpowder rose immensely, as it could be safely shipped by sea, while the demand for goods such as paper and lacquer dwindled due to their possible spoilage from an ocean voyage. d.

The Chinese desired steel-tipped plows to break the rough terrain of Manchuria and increase its agricultural production in order to feed its rapidly growing population. c. The printing method perfected by Johannes Guttenberg. The Chinese bureaucracy needed the innovation of movable type and printing presses to tackle the volume of administrative documents produced by the state. d.
