        "text": "Authors/Editors: Roderick Whitfield and Wang Tao. Commissioning editor and general editor: Sajid Rizvi. ISBN-13 9781872843209, ISBN-10 1872843204. Published by Saffron Books, London. Students of Chinese art and archaeology in the West face two major hurdles: the lack of a general overview of current developments in Chinese archaeology, and the daunting amount of material published only in Chinese. This book will provide a useful means of overcoming both problems. Contributions by leading scholars in the field from China, Japan, Europe and the United States have been carefully chosen, edited and arranged into a coherent body. The essays cover the principal themes of current archaeological debate and practice in China, such as the question of the origins of Chinese civilisation, new trends in theory, and the history and methodology of studying Chinese archaeology and art in the West. Many of the important archaeological discoveries of the last decade, including all fifty of the sites officially designated to be of national importance, are introduced and discussed in this book. Please follow links for table of contents and other information. Additional materials will also be uploaded here, please revisit or Follow.\n\nIn her book An Archaeology of Materials, Chantel Conneller pushes archaeologists to bridge the gap between technical and iconographic studies of materials by thinking about processes of making and material transformations. The present study draws upon Conneller's ideas to look at the widespread practice of mass reproducing elaborate funerary bronze vessels in ceramic form during the first millennium BCE in central China. In order to unpack the layered meanings of this process, I will also be engaging with the Peircean semiotic concept of indexicality in order to argue that the material qualities of clay made possible the emergence of early Chinese empire through the negotiation of cultural and political power between powerful elites and local communities.\n\nThis is a pre-press sample article brochure for the readers to get a glance of the journal. Interest in Chinese antiquities is growing globally. A key resource on the fascinating history of Chinese archaeological artifacts and art is now available in English. Chinese Cultural Relics is the official English translation of the prestigious award-winning Chinese archaeology journal Wenwu (Cultural Relics). Published since the 1950s, Wenwu is well known in China and abroad for its quality articles and in-depth reporting of Chinese archaeological surveys and fieldwork. Until the publication of Chinese Cultural Relics, the information presented in this key resource has only been accessible to those who can read Chinese. Each issue of Chinese Cultural Relics contains content from three recent issues of Wenwu; the premier issue of Chinese Cultural Relics includes articles from issues No. 10, No. 11 and No. 12, 2013. In addition to high-quality translation, each article includes the same high-quality, detailed photographs and beautiful hand-drawn illustrations as in the Chinese publication. Subjects covered in Chinese Cultural Relics include: new archaeological findings research and exploration bamboo slips and documents bronze wares inscriptions and epitaphs ancient towns and villages archaeological preservation the archaeology of science and technology museum exhibitions...and more As interest in China's history continues to grow, your students and research community will no doubt appreciate having this rich information on Chinese archaeology and cultural relics available to them in English.
