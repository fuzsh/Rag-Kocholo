Time  The story of Ancient China is told in traditional historical records that refer as far back to the Five Emperors and Three Sovereigns about 5,000 years ago this is enforced by archaeological records dating to the 16th century BC.  China is one of the world's oldest continuous civilizations.  221 BC is the commonly accepted year when China became unified under a large kingdom or empire.  China was first united by Qin Shi Huang in 221 BC.\n\n3.  The Three Sovereigns, were said to be god-kings or demigods who initiated very important aspects of the ancient Chinese civilization and culture these being: agriculture, fishing, herbal medicine, writing, and the drinking of tea, and in some cases created men and animals. http://history.cultural-china.com/en/46History5031.html  The Five Emperors were legends that were morally perfect sage-kings.\n\n4. Geography The geography of ancient China can be conveniently divided up into three regions: 1) The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers 2) The Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts 3) The Himalayas In ancient China, the importance of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers is hard to overstate. People mostly settled along these rivers, and different settlements were ruled by different kings\n\n5. THE HIMALAYAS YELLOW RIVER YANGTZE RIVER TAKLA MAKAN DESERT GOBI DESERT\n\n6.
