Remembering vividly how houses were burned to ash and treasures became trash in ditches, the author mourns over those perished innocents and curses the “cannibalistic” “Japanese” pirates. Noting that some loyal men from his lineage sacrificed their lives for “imperial favor” (guo’en 國恩), he feels obliged to record the history and illuminate the deceased heroes’ ideal for later generations of his lineage.342 By stressing that his intended audience is his fellow lineage members, Cai Jiude converges the trauma of his fellow townspeople with the suffering of his family clan.

Nguyễn Du traveled to China as an envoy in the eighteenth year of the Jiaqing 嘉慶 reign (1813), around 150 years after The Romance was published.451 He adapted the prose fiction, written in classical Chinese, into a poem written in the vernacular and in “six-eight” verse, a prevalent meter of folk poetry. Nguyễn Du’s The Tale of Kieu struck a chord among Vietnamese people, who found great solace in the novel. As the translator points out, one reason for this popularity was a word that recurs throughout the poem: oan (wronged)."
