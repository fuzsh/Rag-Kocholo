        "text": "In Germany’s far east lies Saxony. A free state shrouded in history, the area has played a role in some of Europe’s most decisive events, including the dismantling of communist regimes in the 1980s. A fascinating mix of charming Baroque towns and exceptional landscapes delight visitors year-round. Once situated east of the Iron Curtain, the atmosphere in Saxony now attracts many young creatives, history buffs, and outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nNew and old fuse in Dresden, a city rebuilt from ruin, the vibrant art scene that Berlin once hosted now hatching in Leipzig, and a dreamy town unscathed by the destruction of World War II – all these call Saxony home. From winter hideaways in the mountains to bizarre rock formations towering toward the clouds, there’s no shortage of things to do in Saxony.\n\nWhat are the best things to do in Saxony?\n\n1.Uncover Leipzig, Berlin’s cool younger sibling\n\nExplore the city’s musical history, trendy galleries, and commanding landmarks\n\nLeipzig, dubbed the coolest city in Saxony, has become the playground of a new generation of young creatives uprooted by the gentrification of Berlin. More than just the latest city to have a new-age revival, it’s steeped in a rich and diverse history, especially where music is concerned, having produced the likes of Bach and Wagner.\n\nWith an up-and-coming art scene, time spent exploring the galleries and museums of Leipzig will be well rewarded. It’s hard to miss Museum der bildenden Künste’s enormous glass building which contains an extensive collection of works from the 15th century to now, including pieces from Monet and Munch. But if it’s architecture that holds your attention, spend time at St. Thomas Church where Bach played his compositions. If you prefer to mix your history with a little bit of wine, enjoy a glass in the city’s 2nd-oldest restaurant, Auerbach’s Cellar. With a history dating back to 1438, it’s well known for once being a favourite haunt of Germany’s answer to Shakespeare, Goethe.\n\n2. Hit the hiking trails in Saxon Switzerland National Park\n\nGaze upon fascinating landscapes in Germany’s far east\n\nRugged terrain with deep valleys, unusual columns, and dense forest form Germany’s only rock national park – Saxon Switzerland National Park. Here, you’ll uncover peaceful villages set among the rising rock columns that are the most iconic feature of this bold landscape. A favourite with rock climbers, there are more than 700 summits to ascend. If you prefer keeping your feet firmly planted on the ground, over 400 km of hiking trails will keep you busy for a few hours.\n\nFor a different kind of experience, jump aboard one of the paddle steamers or steamboats to encounter the park from the waterways, or take the Kirnitzsch Valley tram which connects to many of the key interest points. No trip to Saxon Switzerland National Park is complete without journeying to Bastei Bridge, the most iconic of the park’s imposing rock formations.\n\nOne of Europe’s largest garrisons, Königstein Fortress had a former life as a medieval castle and monastery before its conversion into a fortress in the late 16th century. From then until the 1920s, it stood as the most feared prison in the state of Saxony. Throughout its history, it held several well-known inmates including Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and the co-inventor of European porcelain, Johann Friedrich Böttger.\n\nSituated high on the plateau of a table mountain, the fortress welcomes visitors to explore its expansive grounds. Here you can admire the incredible views overlooking the Elbe River, easily accessed by a lift and panoramic elevator. After you’ve meandered around the fortress grounds, head inside to enjoy the exhibitions.\n\n4. Delve into Dresden’s treasure trove of Baroque architecture\n\nThis city is home to one of Europe’s most handsome skylines\n\nDresden attracts visitors with its impressive city skyline, despite being almost entirely obliterated during the Allied bombings in 1945. Palace domes and towers, church spires, and stately buildings all contribute to the appeal of this striking Baroque city.\n\nYou can find excellent buildings throughout Dresden, many of which were rebuilt or repaired after the divide between East and West Germany was dissolved.\n\nFrauenkirche is one of the most beautiful churches in the world, with a spectacular interior dressed with Baroque flourishes and tiers of rising gallery walls. Other excellent examples of the fine architecture in Dresden include The Zwinger (a brilliant 18th-century palace), Theaterplatz and the Semper Opera (one of Germany’s first public squares and opera houses), and Brühl’s Terrace.\n\n5. Make your way to Moritzburg Castle\n\nYou’ll need to journey across the water to visit this palace on an island\n\n6. Discover the art of European porcelain making in Meissen\n\nLearn about more than just ‘white gold’, with cathedrals and castles to explore\n\nThe origins of European porcelain manufacturing lie in Meissen, a city identifiable by its imposing 15th-century hilltop castle in the Old Town. Since the early 18th century, Meissen has been at the heart of European porcelain heritage and famed for August the Stronghold’s ‘white gold’. The Museum of the Meissen Porcelain Foundation is the ideal place to familiarise yourself with the craft of porcelain making and gain an understanding of how these delicate creations are painstakingly hand-painted.\n\nMore than the heart of porcelain though, this region of Saxony is well-known for its small wine district. Schloss Proschwitz is the most notable winery and also one of the oldest as it has been attracting wine connoisseurs since the 12th century. Bask in glorious views of the castle and the Elbe River below while sipping a delightful drop of the local product.\n\n7. Don’t miss a stop at Dresdner Molkerei Gebrüder Pfund\n\nMarvel at the Guinness World Record’s most beautiful dairy shop\n\nStepping inside Dresdner Molkerei Gebrüder Pfund, it’s not hard to see why this dairy shop took the title of ‘Most Beautiful Dairy in the World’ in the Guinness Book of Records. It’s a mesmerising work of art, with ornately decorated ceilings and walls covered in handpainted faience work dating back to the late 19th century.\n\nThe highly embellished interior features neo-Renaissance motifs painted on tile, creating what must be one of the most visually impressive shop interiors in existence. Nationalised in the 1970s, the Pfund brothers later closed their doors in 1990. Dresdner Molkerei Gebrüder Pfund has since been restored and reopened, with visitors able to purchase a variety of cheeses from the dairy shop."
