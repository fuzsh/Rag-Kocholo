        "text": "Hanne M. Hoffmann, PhD, Assistant Professor, Michigan State University\n\nWebsite: https://www.canr.msu.edu/hoffmann/\n\nBiography\n\nDr. Hanne Hoffmann has a lifelong interest in how seasonal changes in the environment controls biology. Thanks to her combined training in neuroscience, 24 hour circadian rhythms, and reproduction, she is today uncovering the basic mechanisms finetuning reproductive function to the day-night period and how disruption of this alignment impacts reproductive outcomes and mental health. Dr. Hoffmann’s research program is funded through the NIH and March of Dimes and focuses primarily on deciphering the molecular pathways that regulate cellular circadian timekeeping within the reproductive axis. Combining novel transgenic mouse models, recordings from live cells and tissues, with the use of human samples and datasets, her goal is to identify novel drug targets for the treatment of arrhythmia, infertility, preterm labor, and other pregnancy complications. In addition, Dr. Hoffmann applies her basic research studies towards identification of biomarkers of pregnancy complications to improve reproductive health and pregnancy outcome.\n\nDr. Hoffmann is a dedicated advocate for reproductive and child health, and she's actively involved in outreach events and working with legislators on these topics. These efforts include Dr. Hoffmann’s work advocating for healthy school start time. A too early high school start time negatively impacts student wellbeing, mental health, academic success, accidents, as well as lifetime earnings. Aligning school start time with the body’s natural changes in circadian time keeping during puberty allows to increase student wellbeing and success.\n\nEducation\n\nBS Animal Physiology, Montpellier University 2, France (2005)\n\nMS Biology and Health, Montpellier University 2, France (2007)\n\nPhDs Neuroscience, Montpellier University 2, France, Cum Laude (2010)\n\nPhD Biochemistry, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain, European Mention (2010)\n\nHonors and recognition\n\nBiology of Reproduction Most Popular Research Article Award (2021)\n\nMarch of Dimes Basil O'Connor Starter Scholar Research Award (2019)\n\nNew Investigator Award from the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology (2017)\n\nEarly Investigators Award supported by Merck & Co., Inc. from the Endocrine Society (2016)\n\nNeena Schwartz Young Investigator Award in Basic Science from Women in Endocrinology (2016)\n\nSelected publications\n\nZhou G, Tikhonova RN, Holzman C, Chen B, Chang C, Kasten EP, Hoffmann HM.
