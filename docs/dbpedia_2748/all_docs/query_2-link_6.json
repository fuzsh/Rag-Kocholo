        "text": "Saxony is one of the 16 German federal states, bordering Poland and the Czech Republic as well as the German states of Bavaria, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg. With 18,400 square kilometers (7,100 square miles), Saxony is one of the smaller German states. The region's largest cities are Leipzig (580,000 inhabitants), followed by Dresden, the capital (550,000), and Chemnitz (245,000). There are 166 further towns. All major places are well connected within the German motorway and railway systems. Leipzig and Dresden also have international airports.\n\nWhile the northern parts are flatlands, the middle section is hilly and the southern parts are mountainous, with the Fichtelberg Mountain (1,215 meters / 755 miles above sea level) in the Ore Mountains being the highest point. Oberwiesenthal at its foot is the highest town of Germany. The biggest river is the Elbe which hails from the Czech Republic and crosses into Saxony at the Saxon Switzerland National Park. Along the river, not only the current capital, Dresden, can be found, but also the former capitals of Meissen and Torgau. The Neisse River has formed the border to Poland since the end of World War II. Lakelands have come into existence in the Northeast and Northwest due to extensive strip mining.\n\nThe climate in Saxony is as varied as the landscape. With the arrival of spring in many towns, you might as well still be able to participate in winter sports in the Ore Mountains and Vogtland region.\n\nIn scientific terms, Saxony is at the transition between a moderate Atlantic and a continental climate. Temperature, hours of sunligt and rainfall are influenced by seasonal variations as well as by frequently changing weather. Saxony is a typical all-year-round destination. The best travel time is between April and October."
