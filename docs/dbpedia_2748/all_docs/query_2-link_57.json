        "text": "Traditional Niedersachsen dishes are as varied as the Niedersachsen landscape itself. However, one thing is common to all: they have all shaped the Niedersachsen food and drink culture, contribute to the identity of the region and often have an importance that goes beyond the borders of the state. Some areas have even developed regional brands to identify their produce. One example of this is the “Typisch Harz” label, which denotes the unique quality of produce genuinely produced in the Harz mountains region.\n\nWhether Lüneburger Heide potatoes, asparagus, apples and cherries from the Altes Land region, East Frisian tea, Brunswick Mumme beer, Heidschnucke mutton or game - the taste of Niedersachsen produce is guaranteed to win you over. Other traditional products include Wendland “Wedding” soup and Altland apple brandy. The East Frisian man’s tea is the native Emslander’s schnapps. Fruit schnapps and corn schnapps are as traditional in Niedersachsen as genuine East Frisian tea with Kluntje (sugar) and Wölkje (milk). The Lüneburg Heath region is also known for its unmistakeable potato schnapps.\n\nAnd not forgetting fresh North Sea fish, and naturally also North Sea crab. What else do Niedersachsen’s regions have to offer? Buckwheat, for example, a traditional grain that grew very well in the past on the barren moor and heathland. Delicious buckwheat pancakes and buckwheat cake are two products that have their roots in the Niedersachsen region."
