        "text": "New Saxon is a Republic Government located in present day Germany, Netherlands, and England. The majority of the language spoken there is German and Dutch.\n\nHistory - 2035-2043:[]\n\nThis Nation is owned by PA mapping.\n\nThe German Breakdown of 2036:\n\nSince the economic crisis of 2035 Germany's economy has been rapidly deteriorating.By Jan. 2036 Germany had to make a decision: Expand the military to enforce the different regions of Germany, Which were getting Independent thought's, or give independence to some countries in Germany. The government decided to put the\n\nlast amount of money into preserving the country. Riots broke out, and eventually, Bavaria and Saar-land declared independence. Saxon took advantage of this and took lower Saxony in Germany. The fighting only lasted\n\na couple of weeks because Germany had declared peace and changed its name to Western Republic of Prussia. The president Randy Brevshard was changed to Perry Telly. Bavaria, Saar-land, Rhineland, Hamburg, and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania gained its independence along with Saxon.\n\nSaxon Rebuild and English Expansion of 2037:\n\nSaxon ( or Republic of New Saxon - RNS -) instantly started to rebuild its economy and was extremely successful. RUS began elections after they reshaped the economy. They took 3 months before they named a president (The longest of all other new German countries) because the Congress of Saxony had done a great job starting the country. George Brand won the election by a landslide. George Brand boosted the Defense Fund and Military Budget. In June, multiple regions in England wanted to join Saxon because they considered themselves ethnically Saxon and believed they should be part of RNS. RNS let the English Saxons join RNS, which angered England. England declared war on RNS to take back the English Saxon territory. RNS instantly mobilized and sent troops to defend their borders. George Brand started working with multiple other Presidents from Rhineland, Saar-land, Hamburg, and Bavaria to create a German Union. Meanwhile, RNS had deflected each attack from England. It proved that RNS' defenses would be very hard to penetrate. RNS set siege to London in late August. At mid September England signs an Armistice that gives Saxon parts of English Saxon and a small part of London.\n\nRevolts in Lower Saxony:\n\nIn December, 2038 Communist movements started gaining popularity. The leader of the Communist party of RNS was Henry Hoffmann and he did not like the leak of Western Culture into the government. (George Brand was born in the USA but moved to Germany) Hoffmann attempted a Coup d'etat but it was poorly executed and Hoffmann was caught. After that Communist movements slowed and eventually stopped. George Brand's popularity skyrocketed.\n\nSecond Election (2040):\n\nIn 2040 the second election of Saxon was opened up. At this time the Government piggyback an Electoral College election process just like the one in the US. The recent Census saw RNS at 62.8 million with 4 States/Territories. George Brand was the leading candidate, however, Henry Keen rose in popularity. 57% of the votes went to George Brand for a second year while 33% of the vote went to Henry Keen and 8% went to Jacob Hofman and 2% to Randall Narsly.\n\nBenelux Civil War part 1:\n\nThe following years of 2041-2043 kickstarted a civil war in Belgium and the Netherlands. The Benelux Federation, Belgium, Netherlands, Dutch Liberation Army, or DLA, and the People's Republic of Benelux were all contributors to the war. Eventually RNS decided to help Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg (Benelux Republic Organization - BRO -) against the Benelux Federation and the People's Republic of Benelux. (Benelux Co-Prosperity Union - BCPO) Saxon would set up an offensive against the P.R.Benelux and take a majority of North-East Netherlands in the first month of the war.\n\nRecent History - 2043-2050[]\n\nBenelux Civil War part 2:\n\nFollowing the Invasion of NorthEast Netherlands, the P.R. Benelux was pushed back into Friesland. There they continued to suffer losses from the RNS and the Netherlands. The Benelux Federation kept pushing into Luxembourg and Lux. captivated. The Civil war would grow into a standstill for a while. Losses were heavy in Northern Holland due to the P.R's Guerrilla warfare, mostly in the city of Heerenveen. The DLA goes into an offensive state and attacks and occupies all of Limburg. However, The invasion costs them their entire military and they are forced to retreat. Belgium invades the last part of the DLA. The Benelux Federation fails to organize their troops at their border with Belgium and are pushed back. The Benelux Federation deters them from using Guerrilla warfare but it backfires on them and they retreat to Luxembourg and surrender. The war in the Northern Netherlands would continue up until December of 2046, and conflicts would continue until 2047.\n\n​\n\nBenelux Civil War[]\n\nCasualties:[]\n\nBelgium-145k Netherlands-211k Lux.-17k RNS-133k DLA-87k P.R.B-234k BF-202k\n\nStrength:[]\n\nFielded Manpower: Belgium-350k Netherlands-330k Lux.-50k RNS-400k DLA-100k P.R.B-350k BF-300k\n\nTimeline of the War:[]\n\nLocation:[]\n\nBenelux Region- Main fighting at Friesland, Limburg,Namur, Limburg.\n\n[]\n\nConflicts from 2040-2047\n\n​\n\nSaxon-EU agreement:"
