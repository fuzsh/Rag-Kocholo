        "text": "About Saxony\n\nSaxony has many pictures which tell many tales and create lots of history: The heart of \"Silicon Saxony,\" Europe’s largest microelectronics/ICT cluster, beats in Dresden. Between Leipzig and Dresden, researchers and entrepreneurs are working hand in hand in the life sciences and environmental technology sectors. The Chemnitz-Zwickau region is the traditional powerhouse of Saxony’s economy: whether it be mechanical engineering or more than 100 years of Autoland Saxony – strong and highly efficient industries have evolved from smart ideas and intelligent solutions. Saxony’s innovative spirit focuses on such topics as lightweight construction, energy storage technologies, automation technology and the mobility of the future.\n\nSuccess story\n\nJune 2017 – The sensation is perfect: the technology group Bosch is building a new mega fab to produce MEMS for applications in mobility and IoT. And the plant isn’t under construction somewhere in Asia; it’ll actually be completed in Europe by 2021 – right in the heart of \"Silicon Saxony\" in Dresden! At 1,000 million euros, it’s the largest single investment in Bosch’s company history. \"Saxony provides ideal prerequisites. The region is renowned for its microelectronics cluster, which is unique in Europe, and it also excels with a superb infrastructure – the transport connections are excellent,\" says Otto Graf, head of the future Dresden factory, as he sums up the reasons that prompted the group to choose Saxony.\n\nContact\n\nThe pros behind Saxony are the staff members of the Saxony Economic Development Corporation (Wirtschaftsförderung Sachsen GmbH). We promote the business and research location Saxony with conviction. But we rather let our work speak for itself: we assist new business set-ups and company expansions, help develop new markets at home and abroad, initiate networks between business and research, launch transregional cooperations and much more.\n\nYou see, we give our very best for Saxony – and also for your project. We’d love to hear from you!"
