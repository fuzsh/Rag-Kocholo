        "text": "Dan has peacefully moved on to share his humor with the angels. Early Thanksgiving morning, Thursday, November 23, 2023, he took his final nap at the age of 92.\n\nA true master of storytelling, Dan could make even the most mundane situations turn into laughter. His humor was a gift he generously shared with friends, family, and unsuspecting grocery store cashiers. The world is now a little less funny without him, but we're certain he's up there cracking jokes with the best of them.\n\nDan was born and raised in the Milwaukee area, the middle of five kids. He has also lived in Brussels, Green Bay, Wisconsin Rapids, and Largo, Florida. He grew up on a farm in Greenfield, where he became the family fix-it man at a very young age, repairing farm equipment before he was twelve years old. After serving in the Air Force during the Korean War, he worked as a mechanic. Later, he traded in his coveralls for a suit and became a fleet maintenance supervisor.\n\nDan was lucky to have had two loves of his life. He was married to Gloria for 44 years and Jan for 21 years.\n\nA proud father and grandfather, Dan's family was the heart of his world. He leaves behind four kids and their families: Lee Hoffmann, his wife Gwen, daughter Sheena (spouse, E.K.), daughter, Billie Joe (husband, Adam) and children Eric, Kellie, Addie, and Kinley, son Lee (wife, Heather) and child Quinton; Bob Hoffmann, his wife Amy Lee, and son Sean; Tom Hoffmann, his wife Pam, son Jamie (wife, Maura) and children Makenzie and Evan, and daughter Amanda (husband, Kyle); Cindy Johnson, her husband Kevin and children Kaylin and Desmond.\n\nHe also leaves behind his brother Bob (Lois) Hoffmann; several nieces and nephews; his stepchildren, and their families: Tom, Bob, Harold, Annie Van Sistine, and Lynn Leuquin.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents, Henry and Katherine, brothers Henry and Carl; sister Katherine; stepson, Jack Van Sistine; wife Gloria; and wife Janice (Jan).\n\nDuring his final months at Caretta Senior Living, Dan found comfort and care among compassionate individuals who embraced his humor, nurtured his spirit, and provided him with cookies. The family extends heartfelt gratitude to these wonderful caregivers, those who provided care for him in Florida, and the wonderful people at Heartland Hospice. Their dedication, compassion, and support helped make his final days comfortable.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, Dan's family kindly requests that you raise a glass, preferably a vodka martini—straight up extra dry, with olives— and tell a joke in his honor.\n\nThe family will host a celebration of life on April 26, 2024."
