        "text": "Jan Rowley\n\nFebruary 10, 1953 – April 15, 2024\n\nJan Rowley died peacefully in Methodist Hospital after a brief illness on April 15, 2024, surrounded by her husband of 33 years, Rob Williamson; Fr. Darrel Proffitt; Steph Hartig; Gayle Smith and Elizabeth Watkins. She was a beloved English teacher at Ralston High School from 1976-2016, a talented singer/actress in many local productions, and devoted member of All Saints Episcopal Church in Omaha, NE.\n\nJan was born in Chariton, IA, February 10, 1953, to Charles and Eleanor Rowley. As part Charles’ duties as a school administrator and Eleanor’s as a teacher, the family lived in numerous cities in Iowa. Charles earned a Ph.D. at Columbia University in New York City. Charles’ love of baseball and the aura of the nearby New York Yankees cemented Jan’s life-long love for the Bronx Bombers. She always said, and truly meant, that she was a fan of the game itself. However, the Yankees past and present are what instilled joy in her heart as she watched many a game on TV. She was elated when the opportunities arose to attend games in person at Yankee Stadium. She was a classy fan, cheering for her team but also able to applaud the success of opposing teams and players.\n\nAfter graduating from Drake University with an Education Degree, Jan taught one year at Dowling High School in Des Moines, IA. She then moved to Omaha, NE to accept the job of English teacher at Ralston High School in 1976. For 40 years she was a tireless and enthusiastic teacher, mentor and highly involved member of Ralston High school and the Ralston community. Many days Jan would put in 12 hours teaching, grading essays in a timely manner, and listening to students looking for advice. She enjoyed teaching higher level students, but her passion was to teach those students who needed extra help to stay on track. She frequently said she liked molding freshmen by giving them the organizational skills and know-how to be successful in high school. Jan also taught several years in Ralston’s alternative school, helping troubled students make up work and return to the traditional classroom. It was not uncommon for students to write thank you notes to Jan, telling her how much they appreciated her wise counsel and being the only adult who would really listen to them. She inspired numerous students to work through their problems and reach their true potential. Jan loved sports, working in the press box at football games and announcing wrestling matches.\n\nJan always loved theatre. When fellow teacher and director John Morrissey invited her to try out for his melodrama she accepted. She was cast as the heroine and Rob Williamson was cast as the hero. As they say, “the rest was history”. Jan and Rob dated for seven years and were married for 33. Jan starred in or was part of numerous local theater productions. She appeared on the stages of The Upstairs Dinner Theater, Chanticleer, Bellevue Little Theater, Dundee Dinner Theater, The Diner Theater, Snap Productions, The Madrigal Christmas Feaste, special events, and Ralston Community Theater. She received many accolades for her beautiful alto voice, which when needed could rise to mezzo-soprano.\n\nJan and Rob were married at All Saints Episcopal church on December 22, 1990. She sang in the church choir, frequently being requested for soloist work at special events, weddings and funerals. She was a Sunday School teacher and mission trip sponsor. Her drive and determination, with the help of Terry Glover, resulted in the rebirth of the All Saints library. She loved participating in the Book Club, sometimes helping choose book selections for the year.\n\nJan enjoyed being a part of Vacation Bible School. She was a tireless member of the Altar Guild, leading them for one term with her usual exceptional organizational skills. Please don’t let the memory of Jan fade into the past as time goes by. She was a shining example of how to live a kind and selfless life. She inspired more students than you can imagine to navigate the sometimes troubled waters of high school. She was a champion for those of any age who needed a helping hand. She was fair, funny, and totally unselfish with her time to those requesting it. Jan Rowley will be deeply missed but not forgotten.\n\nCELEBRATION OF LIFE: Saturday, June 1, 10:30 a.m. at All Saints Episcopal Church, 9302 Blondo St., Omaha, followed by a lunch and video tribute. To honor all Jan has done, in lieu of flowers send tax-deductible donations to: Ralston Schools Foundation, 8545 Park Drive, Ralston, NE, 68127 (mention “Jan Rowley Memorial Scholarship”)."
