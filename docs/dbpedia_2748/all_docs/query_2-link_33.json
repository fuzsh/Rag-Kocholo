        "text": "The Moritzburg Castle\n\nKnown from the fairy tale movie “Three Wishes for Cinderella”, Moritzburg Castle reminds of a real fairy tale castle in reality as well. It is a popular excursion destination to Dresden, as it is located only 30 minutes outside the city center. Moritzburg Castle served the former Elector of Saxony, August the Strong, in the 18th century as a hunting and pleasure palace, where extensive celebrations were celebrated. The castle and the surrounding forest park are therefore particularly spacious and lush!\n\nThe sunsets at the lake, with the reflection of the castle are particularly dreamlike, so a visit in the late afternoon is worthwhile. Keep your eyes open for “Cinderella’s shoe”, which is located on the steps next to the castle.\n\nThe inside of the castle is also worth exploring! Admission costs â¬12 per adult and provides a glimpse into the magnificent halls and private chambers of Augustus the Strong. The park, on the other hand, can be visited for free at any time.\n\nPlan extra time to explore the castle’s surroundings, such as the small pheasant castle, the Moritzburg game reserve or relax in one of the many cafes & restaurants.\n\nThe Pillnitz Castle in Dresden\n\nPillnitz Palace is my favorite palace in Dresden and can best and most beautifully be reached from the old town by an Elbe river steamer across the Elbe.\n\nIt served as a pleasure palace and summer residence of the king in the 17th century until the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe architectural style is clearly different from that of other castles. Pliinitz Castle has some Asian features and is decorated with tropical, oriental & Asian details. The king wanted to have “something different” here to enjoy the sunny days.\n\nAlready during his reign, there were lots of potted plants from all over the world in the gardens, which were brought back from the colonies and during trips to Germany at that time. It is unbelievable to think that many plants today still date from that time – such as the giant camellia, which can be circled on stairs when in bloom.\n\nA tour of the interior of the castle is also highly recommended, as you are transported back to a pompous time long gone."
