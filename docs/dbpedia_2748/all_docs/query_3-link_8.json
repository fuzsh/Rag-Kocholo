        "text": "Introduction\n\nSaxony-Anhalt was the most industrialised region of the German Democratic Republic. The reunification of Germany caused the closing of many factories, which reduced pollution, but swelled the unemployment figures dramatically. Economic plight has prompted half a million people to leave the state since 1990.\n\nNevertheless, Saxony-Anhalt is full of good surprises for visitors. The beautiful Harz mountains, with its half-timbered towns and its majestic castles, is one of Germany's most touristic region. The numerous palaces and English styles parks and gardens around Dessau are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, as are Dessau's Bauhaus buildings. The Saale-Unstrut valley, in the southeast part of the state, produces most of Germany's sparkling wine.\n\nSaxony-Anhalt covers an area of 20,447 kmÂ² (7,895 sq mi), approximately the same size as Slovenia or Israel, and has a population of 2.34 million (a bit more than Slovenia).\n\nFamous people from Saxony-Anhalt include (chronologically): Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, the religious reformer Martin Luther, the composer Georg Friedrich HÃ¤ndel, the philosopher Novalis, the founder of modern geography Carl Ritter, the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, the Nobel Prize physicist Polykarp Kusch, and the Nobel Prize biologist Christiane NÃ¼sslein-Volhard.\n\nThe present British and Belgian royal families descend in patrilineal line from the House of Wettin, which originated in the village of the same name along the Saale River.\n\nAttractions\n\nAttractions are listed geographically, from west to east (left to right) and north to south (top to bottom).\n\nTravel Community"
