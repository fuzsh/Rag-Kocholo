        "text": "Saxony-Anhalt is not only rich in Romanesque cathedrals, but also in charming half-timbered buildings. It's also the region of Magdeburg and Quedlinburg, two of the oldest towns in Germany. More than 1,000 years ago, both were the seats of power of the first Roman-German emperor, Otto the Great. Last but not least, Saxony-Anhalt was the home of the reformer Martin Luther.\n\nWittenberg and Luther\n\nMore than 500 years ago, legend has it that Martin Luther nailed his theses against the selling of indulgences to the castle church door in Wittenberg. Many original sites of his Protestant Reformation still exist today. The Luther House, for example, once a monastery and his residence, is now a museum filled with his personal objects and paintings. Check-in presenter Nicole Frölich visited Wittenberg during its 500th anniversary year in 2017.\n\nLuther in Eisleben\n\nIf a worldwide survey were to ask who the most famous Germans were, Martin Luther would likely be among them. He was baptized in the Church of St. Peter and Paul in Eisleben on November 11th, 1483.\n\nPacked with history: Quedlinburg\n\nWhen visiting the city of Quedlinburg, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, visitors may feel they've taken trip back in time to early Middle Ages. Founded more than 1,000 years ago, today, almost half a million visitors a year are attracted by the charm of the narrow cobbled streets lined with half-timbered houses.\n\n100 years of Bauhaus\n\nAnother city, another millennium: In 2019, the Bauhaus school celebrated its 100th anniversary. Many original buildings designed by the famous school of art, architecture and design still stand in the city of Dessau. The legendary school building and the adjacent houses, which have been part of the UNESCO World Heritage since 1996, were built in 1925/26. Visitors can even stay overnight in this World Heritage Site.\n\nGarden Kingdom Dessau-Wörlitz\n\nThe third World Heritage Site in Saxony-Anhalt is the Garden Kingdom of Dessau-Wörlitz, a work of landscape art from the 18th century. Numerous canals run through the English-style garden. Visitors can take a boat out onto the water past the temple of Venus, the palace and works of art. A highlight of the complex is Europe's first artificial volcano.\n\nTuscany of the north\n\nThe Middle Ages have truly left their mark along the Saale and Unstrut rivers in the many castles, monasteries, churches and vineyards seen along the way. Check-in host Lukas Stege gets into a canoe and explores the wine country along the two streams, while searching for the most beautiful woman of the medieval period, said to be in Naumburg Cathedral.\n\nNaumburg Cathedral\n\nNaumburg Cathedral is one of the most important cultural monuments of the High Middle Ages in Germany. Since 2018, the cathedral is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, meaning Saxony-Anhalt has five such sites in total. This density of World Heritage sites in one state is considered unique in Germany.\n\nAdrenaline in the Harz Mountains\n\nSaxony-Anhalt not only attracts culture lovers, but also an increasing number of sporty holidaymakers who are attracted to natural havens like the Harz Mountains, northern Germany's highest mountain range. The 458 meter-long (1,502 feet) steel suspension bridge at the Rappboden-Talsperre and the chance to take a speedy ride with the Mega Zipline are definitely part of the unique experiences one can have in this area. Check-in presenter Nicole Frölich experienced them during her visit to the Harz Mountains before the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Witches' dance floor\" in Thale\n\nHigh above the village of Thale in the Harz Mountains lies the Hexentanzplatz, or \"Witches' dance floor.\" When it's not Walpurgis Night, the night from April 30 to May 1 that sees more than 10,000 witch- and magic fans meet for a wild party, the mountain plateau is quite idyllic.\n\nYour trip to Germany\n\nAre you looking for recommendations for your visit to Germany? We've got them: Tips for Germany — state by state."
