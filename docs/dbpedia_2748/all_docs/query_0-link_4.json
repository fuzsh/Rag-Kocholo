        "text": "Gert Hofmann (born Jan. 29, 1931, Limbach, Saxony, Ger.—died July 1, 1993, near Munich) was a German novelist who examined morality and the resonances of Nazism in postwar Germany.\n\nHofmann studied at the Universities of Leipzig and Freiburg and taught in Austria, England, and the United States. For years he wrote theatre and radio plays in which he introduced his moral and social concerns; the skill he acquired at writing dialogue was essential to his fiction, for which he is best known. His first novel, Die Denunziation (1979), presents two brothers’ memories of their participation in war crimes. Die Fistelstimme (1980; “The Falsetto”) consists of a monologue by a professor who is gradually disintegrating in a perverse society. Honoré de Balzac and Casanova are among the historical figures represented in the four stories of Hofmann’s Gespräch über Balzacs Pferd (1981; Balzac’s Horse and Other Stories)."
