Fill your list, move or drag and drop items between them.\n\nAs a premium member, you will have private and public lists, as well as default core lists (favorites, bookmarks, already been there, bucket list).\n\nShare your current itinerary:\n\nWith friends and family via email, to Twitter, to Facebook or pin it on Pinterest.\n\nDecide, if the active itinerary is public or private.\n\nOnce the historic Kingdom of Hanover, Lower Saxony, Neidersachsen in German, is the only German state that has both mountainous and maritime areas. From the North Sea, an area known as East Frisia, to the Central Uplands and the Harz Mountains in the south. The state’s four UNESCO World Heritage Sites reflect the diversity of this region. From the Romanesque churches in Hildesheim to the early 20th century Fagus Factory in Alfeld. From the intertidal mudflats of the Wadden Sea to the historic mining towns and water management systems in the Harz mountains. As with many other areas in Germany, and Europe, Lower Saxony has its fair share of forts and castles. But it is particularly known for quaint towns and villages with half-timbered houses. Many towns are included on the ‘German Half-Timbered House Route’. And for the culinary minded traveller, Lower Saxony even has an ‘Asparagus Route’.\n\nThis page, part of our Germany Travel Guide, provides details of the art, archaeology and history sites, museums and related attractions to visit in the state of Lower Saxony.
