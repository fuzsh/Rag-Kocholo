        "text": "IMF Executive Board Concludes 2024 Article IV Consultation with Iraq\n\nDomestic stability has improved since the new government took office in October 2022, facilitating the passage of Iraq’s first three-year budget, which entailed a large fiscal expansion starting in 2023. This supported the strong recovery in Iraq’s non-oil economy after a contraction in 2022, while Iraq was largely unaffected by the ongoing conflict in the region. Domestic inflation declined to 4 percent by end-2023, reflecting lower international food prices, the currency revaluation as of February 2023, and the normalization in trade finance. However, imbalances have worsened due to the large fiscal expansion and lower oil prices.\n\nResident Representative Visit to Baghdad\n\nIMF Resident Representative Gazi Shbaikat concludes a visit to Baghdad where he held several high-level and technical meetings on key economic developments and enhance cooperation with the authorities including the Prime Minister, Governor of the Central Bank, and Minister of Finance among other key ministries and departments. Gazi Shbaikat also met with UN agencies, the World Bank, and IECG ambassadors, where he delivered an economic debrief and stressed the need for enhancing coordination among partners in key support and technical assistance areas.\n\nInflation and Conflict in Iraq: The Economics of Shortages Revisited\n\nContaining inflation has turned out to be one of the most challenging aspects of economic management in Iraq. This paper posits that conventional as well as unconventional factors explain inflation dynamics in the recent past.\n\nResident Representative Visit to Baghdad\n\nIMF Resident Representative Gazi Shbaikat concludes a visit to Baghdad where he held several high-level and technical meetings on key economic developments and enhance cooperation with the authorities including the Prime Minister, Governor of the Central Bank, and Minister of Finance among other key ministries and departments.
