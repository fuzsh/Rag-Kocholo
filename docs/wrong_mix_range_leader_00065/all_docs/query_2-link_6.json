cabinet.\n\nThe Constitution of Myanmar stipulates that Union Ministers must be a Burmese citizen who has been living in the country for at least ten consecutive years:[2]\n\npersons who have attained the age of 40 years;\n\npersons who have qualifications, with the exception of the age limit, prescribed in Section 120 for Pyithu Hluttaw representatives;\n\npersons whose qualification does not breach the provisions under Section 121 which disqualify a person from standing for election as Pyithu Hluttaw representatives;\n\npersons loyal to the Union and its citizens\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief appoints the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs and Border Affairs, selecting candidates from within the Defence Services (Tatmadaw), while the President appoints the remainder.[2]\n\nThe President also appoints the Deputy Ministers of the respective ministries, following the same qualifications as those of Union Ministers, with the exception of age (35 years, instead of 40).\n\nMain article:

Under the constitution, three ministers – of Border Affairs, Defence and Home Affairs – are appointed by the National Defence and Security Council. The remaining 15 ministers were appointed by Htin Kyaw and included a majority from the NLD, but also two members of the former ruling party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) and a number of independents.[18] The cabinet head, Htin Kyaw, resigned on 21 March 2018 and Win Myint became the new president.\n\nOffice Name Party Term State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi NLD 6 April 2016 – 30 March 2018 Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation Aung Thu NLD 30 March 2016 – 30 March 2018 Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation Tun Win, Dr. NLD 3 May – 15 December 2016 Hla Kyaw USDP 15 December 2016 – 30 March 2018 Minister of Border Affairs Ye Aung, Lt.

He is the first Minister dismissed openly. He was succeeded by Soe Win, Deputy Minister for Religious Affairs and former Deputy Minister for Ministry of Information.[22] Minister for Information Aung Kyi and Minister for Health Pe Thet Khin were allowed to resign on 29 July 2014.[23] They are succeeded by Ye Htut and Than Aung, Deputy Ministers.[24]\n\nOn 4 September 2012, Pyidaungsu Hluttaw approved the government's reshuffle of ministries, increasing the number to 36, including six ministers located in the President's Office. The President approved the resignation of Zaw Min, Union Minister for Electric Power-1, and Khin Maung Myint, Union Minister for Construction. The President also approved the resignation of Union Auditor-General Lun Maung on 28 August. Thein Hteik, Union Minister for Mines, was appointed as Union Auditor-General, and Lt-Gen Wai Lwin of the Office of Commander-in-Chief (Army) as Union Defence Minister. Wai Lwin was replaced Lt-Gen Hla Min, who was reassigned to the military.[25] During the government's major cabinet reshuffle, nine ministers have been reassigned, mainly with four transferred to the President's Office and one, Aung Kyi, named as the new Minister for Information, replacing Kyaw Hsan, who was transferred to the Ministry of Cooperatives as minister. In the present reformation of the cabinet, Ministries of Electric Power No. 1 and 2 were combined into one as the Ministry of Electric Power, while the Ministry of Industrial Development was abolished.[26][27]\n\nOn 16 January 2013, Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Thein Tun and Minister for Religious Affairs, Thura Myint Maung abruptly resigned. Thein Tun was the first government minister known to have been investigated for corruption under the new government. San Sint, Speaker of Ayeyarwady Region Hluttaw succeeded Thura Myint Maung later. On 13 February 2013, former Commander-in-Chief of air force, General Myat Hein become minister for Communications and Information Technology.[21]\n\nThis appointments serve as a reminder that most ministers in the government are former officers who played a role in the previous military junta. Since taking office in 2011, the reformist president, who is himself a former general, has selected former senior military officers into government as it simply continues the flawed practices of past military rule, and given only a handful of posts to people without a military background.[28]\n\nOffice Name Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation Myint Hlaing Minister of Border Affairs Thet Naing Win, Lt.
