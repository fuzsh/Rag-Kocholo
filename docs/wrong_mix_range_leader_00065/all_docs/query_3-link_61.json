Impact data comes from solid evaluation processes and, in contrast with reach data, provides a better understanding about CARE's contributions to fighting poverty and inequality. CARE's ability to measure impact and to explain how it contributes to lasting change comes from its global evidencing system.\n\nThe core of this system is a common set of guiding indicators - related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - applicable to CARE projects and initiatives worldwide, allowing for the collection and consolidation of impact data and stories presented in this site. The figures presented, globally, by region or country, represent the cumulative numbers of people for whom CARE has evidence of positive change, based on those guiding indicators."
