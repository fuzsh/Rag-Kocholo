        "text": "The door was open to the Burmese military junta. If they had released the pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and some of the 2,100 other political prisoners, they could have begun to end the international isolation in which they have plunged the country for the past four decades. But they slammed that door shut yesterday. By making sure that Ms Suu Kyi will spend the next year and a half under house arrest, the generals have ensured that she cannot participate in next year's election. She is already banned from holding high office, under one article in the constitution specifically written for her, which says that no one who has been married to a foreign citizen can be president. And neither can she be elected to parliament, under another article banning past offenders from office. But such is the power of her political genie, and the fear of what would happen if it were let out of the bottle, that the cork is triple-fastened.\n\nGeneral Than Shwe, Burma's ruler, is at least consistent in his repression. If a cyclone which killed more than 140,000 of his people could not deflect him from holding a referendum on a pet project to put a civilian facade on military rule, then the uproar yesterday over Ms Suu Kyi's sentence would be unlikely to deflect him from his purpose. The United Nations, the EU, and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, all demanded Ms Suu Kyi's unconditional release, and Gordon Brown's statement showed signs of personal outrage. He said her prosecution was monstrous and that the will of the UN security council had been flouted, and called for an arms embargo.\n\nBut little of this matters to Burma's rulers. They care not one jot for their people, to whose poverty and suffering they are impervious. They have mansions, Mercedes, and unlimited supplies of cash from oil, gas and teak timber revenues. They bank much of it in Singapore, if the US treasury department is to be believed, and as long as their borders are secure, and their neighbours in China, India and Thailand remain loyal, they have about 90% of what they need from life. And it was of their neighbours and the Association of South East Asian Nations that Than Shwe was thinking when he reduced the sentence of his most important political prisoner from three years' hard labour to 18 months of house arrest, by saying he was acting out of reverence for her father, a hero of Burma's independence from the British. Than Shwe was not thinking of anyone else. The leitmotif of Barack Obama's presidency – that engagement with the international community could provide an incentive to change – is, sadly, profoundly misplaced in Burma's case. It shows no signs of going down the path Vietnam once trod.\n\nRealising that the options with Burma's brutal leaders are limited does not mean throwing our hands up in despair. The international aid effort in the Irrawaddy delta has worked better than anyone had expected in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, in terms of both access and freedom of movement. Access is maintained at the cost of staying silent over human rights abuses, but it is nonetheless clear that efforts to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of the Burmese people should be stepped up. So, too, should diplomatic pressure from the United Nations be maintained."
