        "text": "Only rarely is a national capital relocated, but it can happen. And it has happened in Burma (Myanmar), where every decision is wrapped in secrecy. The change stunned the region. On 6 November 2005 hundreds of trucks hauled desks, chairs, benches and equipment, as well as disillusioned civil servants, some 350km north from the old capital of Rangoon to Pyinmana, on the railway line to Mandalay.\n\nA new political and administrative capital, Naypyidaw (“royal city”), is being built in the jungle-covered, malarial hills just outside Pyinmana. The military zone is in the eastern sector around the war office; government ministries and what will be the civil servants’ residential district are to the west of the new railway station. Barely a quarter of the vast project has been built. The electricity supply is inadequate and there is little drinkable water. However the airport, vital to the generals of the Burmese junta, is open; and the enormous blockhouses destined to host the headquarters of the armed forces have apparently been sunk into the hills.\n\nThe idea of moving the capital originally came from General Than Shwe, leader of the military junta that has held power since 1988. It was inspired by three concerns: to return to royal tradition, since the city of Rangoon was the creation of the British colonial regime (1); to prevent Burma being paralysed by another popular rising like that of 1988; and to shelter the regime from possible United States aggression (2). The US invasion of Iraq in 2003 turned the strategic imperative to relocate the capital from the coast to the interior into an obsession. And Than Shwe’s astrologers persuaded him to accelerate the move.\n\nBurma’s traditionally isolationist military leaders, convinced they would be less vulnerable in their new refuge, spent years examining the options. It was a bone of contention between Than Shwe, General Maung Aye, and their main rival, General Khin Nyunt, the head of the intelligence services. Shortly after Khin Nyunt’s removal in October 2004, Than Shwe entrusted a loyal supporter, General Thura Shwe Mann, number three in the regime, with the task of supervising and accelerating the building work outside Pyinmana. At this stage all that was envisaged was the transfer of the war ministry.\n\nSuspect money\n\nAmong the many construction companies in the vast project, three of the most important have ties with the regime and are involved in illegal activities. The Htoo Trading Company is owned by the magnate and arms dealer Tay Za, a close associate of Than Shwe. The Asia World Company, founded by the former opium magnate Lo Hsing Han, and U Aik Htun’s Olympic Construction Company are suspected of laundering drug money, especially after Maung Aye ordered the closure of the Asia Wealth Bank, part of the Olympic conglomerate, following US accusations of money-laundering.\n\nMoving the capital allows Than Shwe to strengthen his hold on power. To guarantee the new capital’s security, a new Naypyidaw regional command has been added to the 12 existing military commands. It is supervised by a fifth Special Operations Bureau, outranking the Rangoon command, whose former head Myint Swe, Than Shwe’s nephew and faithful supporter, has been promoted to the rank of lieutenant general at the head of the bureau.\n\nThis promotion confirms Myint Swe’s position as number four in the regime and reinforces Than Shwe’s hold over the entire state peace and development council (SPDC), the nation’s ruling body. The junta has never been so powerful, which makes the exorbitant cost of moving the capital even more outrageous, given Burma’s economic situation and the terible living conditions endured by the population. Civil servants, forced into this surreal relocation, must either obey or flee secretly to Thailand. The population is too preoccupied with the daily struggle for survival to dream of rebelling, especially against such a relatively mild manifestation of the regime’s capricious exercise of power.\n\nBesides the clan struggles that continue to divide the dictatorship, Than Shwe and Maung Aye are personal rivals who disagree profoundly on major national policy issues. They take almost directly opposed positions on relations with the opposition, ethnic minorities and Burma’s main neighbours.\n\nCross-border tensions\n\nThe main source of tension is Thailand, although the Burmese regime tended to look favourably upon its prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, until his recent overthrow. President George Bush’s decision to list Thailand as one of the US’s best friends outside Nato did nothing to settle the rivalries. The Thai population have never forgiven the Burmese for sacking their capital, Ayuthaya, in 1767.\n\nThe most serious tensions date from 2001 and have been exacerbated by the traffic in amphetamines. Hundreds of millions of tablets were exported to Thailand from Burma’s Shan state by former rebel groups that had signed ceasefire agreements and therefore become allied with the Burmese army. Burma, humiliated by the inability of its air force to oppose the intervention of Thai F-16 fighters, responded by buying MiG-29s from Russia.\n\nBurma routinely accuses Thailand of supporting rebels from the Karen, Karenni and Shan ethnic minorities, who are still engaged in armed struggle, and the exiled All Burma Student Democratic Front. However, in November 2005 the two countries did sign a draft agreement for the construction of dams on the Salween river.\n\nEven so, the Burmese military command recently regarded a CIA-sponsored Thai invasion as a possibility, which was another reason to move the capital to Pyinmana. The suspicion also served to justify the close surveillance of leaders of political parties, especially the National League for Democracy (NLD) led by the charismatic Aung San Suu Kyi, so that they could be quickly eliminated to prevent them serving as a fifth column for invading forces.\n\nThe NLD, with almost all opposition parties, has been neutralised. Its offices, apart from the headquarters in Rangoon, have closed their doors. Aung San Suu Kyi and her vice-president, Tin Oo, are isolated under house arrest. The remainder of the ageing NLD leadership will soon have no party to lead. Its internal communications have been cut and there is almost nobody to take over. A few offices cautiously re-opened at the beginning of 2006, but it will take a colossal effort to get the party running again.\n\nMuch the same is happening to the NLD’s ally, the second party, the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy, whose main leaders were rounded up and imprisoned. Like the NLD’s leaders, they had rejected the masquerade of the National Convention, which in March 2005 was given responsibility for writing a new constitution “approved by all the country’s representatives”, but actually intended to perpetuate and legitimise the army’s hold on power.\n\nEthnic minorities fall into two groups: those who have given in to the junta and signed ceasefires with it, or allied themselves to the SPDC; and the remaining armed groups, driven back to the borders. General Maung Aye has offered them a choice of surrender or death (3).\n\nRepresentatives of many ethnic minorities, reluctantly recognising their weakness and inability to establish any dialogue, let alone recognition of their views, with the SPDC, have set aside their rivalries and formed an ethnic minorities council. They have realised that the separate ceasefires they had signed had served only their own short-term interests and had allowed the generals to exploit their individual interests and divisions. The reality is that the SPDC has no intention either of talking to anyone or of surrendering or sharing any power.\n\nWa autonomy\n\nThat leaves the Wa nationalists, the United Wa State Army (UWSA). As the main minority group within the forces of the Burma Communist party (BCP), the Wa were the sworn enemies of the central government in Rangoon. When the BCP fragmented in 1989, they signed a ceasefire in return for freedom to traffick in drugs and turned into a powerful narco-organisation, allied to the SPDC, despite conflictual relations with it.\n\nThe Wa demand an autonomous region entirely under their control where they can use the Chinese yuan rather than Burma’s legal tender, the kyat, and where the only languages taught and spoken will be Wa and Chinese. They are contemptuous of the acrobatics of Burmese politics and, with Chinese support, are only interested in business both legal and illegal.\n\nThe Wa control two vast areas: Special Region 2, along the Chinese border in the north; and clearly defined territories in the south, granted to them in return for helping the Burmese army campaign against the opium warlord Khun Sa and the Sang.\n\nThe area of influence that the UWSA seeks to expand is controlled by Wei Shao Kang, a Chinese who took over the drug networks that former Kuomintang members set up in northern Thailand when Mao Zedong drove them out of China. He became the partner and principal financial backer of Pao Yo Chang, the UWSA leader.\n\nWei Shao Kang was involved in narco-trafficking and in all the Wa business activities. His empire included private banks and a domestic airline, as well as the enormous Hong Pang conglomerate which deals in foodstuffs, construction, public works, industrial manufacturing and even pirating DVDs, all activities that facilitate money laundering.\n\nIn January 2005 a US grand jury indicted in absentia eight senior leaders of the UWSA, including Pao Yo Chang and Wei Shao Kang, for drug trafficking. This followed accusations of money laundering against the Wa-controlled Asia Wealth Bank and Myanmar Mayflower Bank. General Maung Aye, keen to destroy the dominance of the Wa-Chinese alliance, exploited these external attacks to secure the closure of the accused banks in April 2005.\n\nAlthough this was a serious blow to the Wa financial system, they were not the sole shareholders in the banks: several groups of Burmese generals also had interests. In May there were attacks in Rangoon which left dozens dead and hundreds wounded; responsibility for these was never claimed, but they were a warning to Maung Aye, whose daughter had a major financial stake in all the attack targets.\n\nMoving fields of poppies\n\nDuring a regional operation in September 2005, 490kg of heroin were found on Wa-owned vehicles. The Hong Pang conglomerate was officially dissolved, only to reform immediately under the name Xinghong. But the Burmese regime seems to have learned a lesson from the May attacks and has granted concessions and contracts, without restriction, to companies belonging to or associated with the UWSA leadership. When oil reserves were discovered near Kengtung, in the east of Shan state, the concession went to the Thai company Lampoon Dam, regarded as the main Wa money-laundering operation in Thailand. Despite the US indictment, the Wa leaders still remain free to move around Burma and China.\n\nThe Chinese, worried about the dramatic penetration of drugs into China and the associated spread of Aids, have been more successful than international institutions in persuading Pao Yo Chang to curtail Wa trafficking. Poppy fields have mostly disappeared from the area along the Chinese border. But Pao Ho Chang has been less zealous than he claims in applying a policy that directly damages Wa farmers. Much of the poppy growing has been moved west, into the Burmese zone; and there are still many smaller, better-camouflaged fields in Special Region 2.\n\nAs well as leaning on UWSA protégés, the Chinese government has also resorted to extreme retaliation. Special Region 4 is controlled by Sai Lin (4), who developed and funded it with money from drugs and casinos. Most of these were in a former Shan farming village high in the mountains, Mong La, that was turned into a miniature Las Vegas, bright with neon, in just a few years.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Chinese flocked to lose money in its ultra-modern casinos, which were open 24 hours a day. Then Chinese government officials, party managers and even police officers started losing money and were forced to hand over their official cars as guarantees that they would pay their debts.\n\nChina could no longer close its eyes. In 2004 it imposed border restrictions to halt the flow of Chinese gamblers and ordered Mong La’s Chinese residents home. In July 2005 it sent in a military police unit with trucks to surround the town in broad daylight and recover the official vehicles that had been seized as security. The failure of the Burmese government to react to this violation of its sovereignty is an indication of China’s influence.\n\nThe financial consequences of this operation, the closure of the border and the shutdown of his casinos severely weakened Sai Lin, to the benefit of the SPDC. It is probable that Burma persuaded China to drop him in return for the award of a colossal offshore gas contract to the Chinese company PetroChina in December 2005.\n\nThe main beneficiary of this double game is China, upon whose military and financial support Burma depends. Chinese participation in infrastructure construction has increased the penetration of Chinese products: the construction of major roads from Loije to Bhamo, and from Tengchong to Myitkyina, will improve access to the Irrawaddy river, which will soon be a major waterway for China. This could influence leases in the port of Rangoon. An opposition news agency even suggested that Burma could become China’s 24th province."
