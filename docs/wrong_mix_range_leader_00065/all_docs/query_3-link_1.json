        "text": "Head of state of the Republic of Iraq\n\nPresident of the Republic of Iraq\n\nرئيس جمهورية العراق‎ (Arabic)\n\nسەرۆککۆماری عێراق‎‎ (Kurdish)\n\nIncumbent\n\nAbdul Latif Rashid\n\nsince 17 October 2022\n\nExecutive branch of the\n\nFederal Government of the Republic of IraqStyleHis ExcellencyTypeHead of stateResidenceRadwaniyah Palace, BaghdadAppointerParliamentary voteTerm lengthFour years, renewable oncePrecursorKing of IraqFormation14 July 1958First holderMuhammad Najib ar-Ruba'iDeputyVice PresidentSalaryUS$809,700 annually[1]WebsiteOfficial website\n\nThe president of the Republic of Iraq (Arabic: رئيس جمهورية العراق, romanized: Ra'īs Jumhūriyat al-Irāq; Kurdish: سەرۆککۆماری عێراق / Serokkomarê Îraqê) is the head of state of Iraq and \"safeguards the commitment to the Constitution and the preservation of Iraq's independence, sovereignty, unity, the security of its territories in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution\".[2] The president is elected by the Council of Representatives by a two-thirds majority,[3] and is limited to two four-year terms.[4] The president is responsible for ratifying treaties and laws passed by the Council of Representatives, issues pardons on the recommendation of the prime minister, and performs the \"duty of the Higher Command of the armed forces for ceremonial and honorary purposes\".[5] Since the mid-2000s, the presidency is primarily a symbolic office, as the position does not possess significant power within the country according to the October 2005-adopted constitution. By convention, though not by any official legal requirement, the office is expected to be held by a Kurd (all were from the PUK party).[6]\n\nOn the 2022 Iraqi presidential election held on 13 October 2022, the Iraqi parliament voted Abdul Latif Rashid as the new president of Iraq, replacing Barham Salih.[7]\n\nAccording to Article 73 of the Iraqi Constitution, the powers of the President are:\n\nIssuing a special pardon on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, with the exception of what is related to the private right, and those convicted of international crimes, terrorism, and financial and administrative corruption.\n\nRatification of international treaties and agreements, after the approval of the House of Representatives, and they are considered ratified after fifteen days from the date of their receipt.\n\nRatifiying and issuing laws enacted by the Council of Representatives, considered ratified after fifteen days from the date of their receipt.\n\nCalling the elected Council of Representatives to convene within a period not exceeding fifteen days from the date of ratification of the election results, and in other cases stipulated in the constitution.\n\nTo award medals and medals upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister, in accordance with the law.\n\nAcceptance of ambassadors.\n\nIssuing republican decrees.\n\nTo ratify death sentences issued by the competent courts.\n\nPerforming the mission of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces for honorary and ceremonial purposes.\n\nExercising any other presidential powers stipulated in this constitution.\n\nThe Iraqi constitution, in Article 68, specifies a number of conditions that a candidate for the presidential office must:\n\nBe an Iraqi by birth and of Iraqi parents.\n\nBe fully qualified and have attained forty years of age.\n\nHave a good reputation, political experience, and is known for his integrity, uprightness, justice, and devotion to the homeland.\n\nHave not been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.\n\nIn the early days of the Iraqi Republic in 1958, neither the head of the Sovereign Council, Muhammad Najib al-Rubaie, nor the Prime Minister, Abdul Karim Qassem, took any palace to be an official republican palace for the state. Al-Rubaie stayed in his personal home before 14 July 1958. Qassem also remained in his home before the revolution, while his office at the Ministry of Defense was taken as his official office in his capacity as prime minister. Sometimes he slept there.\n\nWith Abd al-Salam's accession to power in 1963, he focused his attention on the palace that was being built during the reign of King Faisal II and in which he was to marry later. Abd al-Salam took care of the palace and completed it in 1965, the first republican palace of Iraq.\n\nAnd it continued as a republican palace until 2003, at the beginning of the American occupation of Iraq.\n\nThe American forces used it as a headquarters in the first days of the occupation, then made it into an American embassy until 1 January 2009, when the Iraqi government took over it, restored it and changed its name to the Government Palace. In 2012, the Arab summit postponed from the previous year was held in this palace.\n\nThe current presidential palace in which the Iraqi president resides is the Peace Palace, which was built during the era of Saddam Hussein. Another complex used as a presidential palace during Saddam Hussein's rule was the Radwaniyah presidential palace complex. In addition, there are a scattered number of presidential palaces in Baghdad and the rest of the provinces, such as the Sujood Palace and Al-Faw Palace in Baghdad, and the presidential palaces in Mosul, Basra, Tikrit and Babylon.\n\nAfter the revolution of 14 July 1958, elections were scheduled to be held to choose a President of the Republic, but they never took place. Therefore, the position of the president remained suspended, while Najib al-Rubaie was assigned to head the Sovereignty Council, which was considered as the president of the republic. Thus, Abd al-Salam Aref became the first to bear the title of President of the Iraqi Republic.\n\nMain article: Presidency Council of Iraq\n\nThe presidency council was an entity that operated under the auspices of the \"transitional provisions\" of the Constitution. According to the Constitution, the Presidency Council functioned in the role of the president until one successive term after the Constitution was ratified[8] and a government was seated.[9] The presidency council had the additional power to send legislation back to the Council of Representatives for revision."
