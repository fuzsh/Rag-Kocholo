        "text": "On 9 January, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhang Qiyue held a regular press conference. She first announced a piece of news.\n\nAt the invitation of Minister Anil Kumarsingh Gayan of Foreign Affairs and Regional Cooperation of the Republic of Mauritius, Foreign Minister Mompati Merafhe of the Republic of Botswana, Minister Rodolphe Adada of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation and French Affairs of the Republic of Congo, Minister Leonard She okitundu of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Foreign Minister Franco Frattini of the Republic of Italy, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan of the People’s Republic of China will pay a visit to the above countries from January 16 to 25, 2003.\n\nIn addition, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan answered the phone and had a conversation with US Secretary of State Colin Powell this morning. The two sides exchanged views mainly on the nuclear question of the DPRK and Sino-US bilateral relations.\n\nIn the talk, Powell said that US harbors no hostility towards the DPRK and hopes to seek solution to the nuclear question of the DPRK through constructive dialogue so as to realize the denuclearization of the Korea Peninsular.\n\nOn Powell’s statement, Tang Jiaxuan said that China appreciates US’s position of being willing to solve the nuclear question of the DPRK through dialogue and hopes that the US side conducts dialogue with the DPRK in a flexible manner. Tang stressed that only dialogue can relax the tension triggered by the nuclear question of the DPRK, maintain peace and stability and the denuclearization of the Korea Peninsular. It is conducive to peace, stability and development of North East Asia and conforms to interests of the various parties, US included.\n\nOn bilateral relations, both sides agreed that good momentum has been maintained in developing bilateral relations and hoped to see new improvement and development in the bilateral relations in the new year.\n\nQ: Please introduce the significance of Foreign Minister Tang’s visit to Africa this time and the Sino-African relations at this stage. Does China have any plan of economic assistance to these countries?\n\nA: I have announced just now that Minister Tang will soon visit the four countries in Africa, which is his seventh visit to the region. The main goal is to strengthen consultation on bilateral relations and issues of common interest and to promote Sino-African relations. A de facto tradition has formed over the years that the Chinese foreign minister chooses African countries as the destination of his first foreign visit in the beginning of each year. It fully shows that it is the corner stone of China’s foreign policy to develop the friendly relations and cooperation with the vast number of developing countries including African countries. China’s new collective leaders will continue to attach great importance to the solidarity and cooperation with African countries.\n\nAt present, the friendly relations and cooperation between China and majority of African countries have been steadily developed, with increasing level and expanding field of cooperation. Sino-African Cooperation Forum in particular, the collective dialog mechanism between China and African countries, has gradually improved, with follow-up actions promoted steadily. It fully reflects the strong aspiration of both sides to go with the historical trend, seek expanded cooperation and achieve common development. The 2nd Ministerial Conference of the Forum will be held in Addis Ababa towards the end of the year and both sides will hold collective consultation on how to deepen Sino-African cooperation in an all-around way within the overall Forum framework. The Chinese side has always attached great importance to the economic and trade cooperation with the African countries and will continue to provide economic assistance to them within its capacity so as to make its own contributions to their economic and social development.\n\nQ: Three questions. First, does China urge the DPRK to respond to the recent US suggestion to resume dialog, in another word, impose diplomatic pressure upon the DPRK? Secondly, does China agree if the UN Security Council decides in the end to impose economic sanction against the DPRK? Thirdly, how does China’s diplomatic position fit in to the suggestion put forward by the ROK to promote the signing of a non-aggression agreement between the DPRK and the US? Does China hope to see the ROK to take the lead and then follow up? Or does China have any unilateral plan?\n\nA: On your first question, I have introduced China’s position here many times. China and the DPRK are friendly and close neighbors and keep normal exchange and frequent contact.\n\nOn your second question, we hope to maintain peace and stability and achieve denuclearization on the Korean peninsula. And we are always of the view that that the current crisis should be solved through dialog between the parties concerned. Proceeding from this principled stand, we hope that the parties concerned will relax the current crisis through dialog and avoid any move that will escalate the current tension.\n\nOn your third question, relevant parties are all making positive efforts to handle the DPRK nuclear question, work hard to break the stalemate between the US and the DPRK, resume dialog and seek ways to solve the current crisis. The Chinese side encourages and supports the efforts and concrete actions made by the parties concerned.\n\nQ: The Chinese side always calls for the settlement of the Iraqi question through political and diplomatic means to avoid war between the US and Iraq. Does the Chinese side call for mediation to solve the Iraqi question like its practice on the DPRK nuclear question?\n\nA: We have always maintained that the Iraqi question should be solved through political and diplomatic means within the UN framework. At present relevant parties should observe the UN Resolution 1441 in real earnest. After the adoption of the Resolution, Iraq has put forward the report according to requirement and the UN weapon inspectors are now inspecting in Iraq. Later this month, the UN Security Council will have overall review of the question in accordance with the report handed in by the inspectors. We hope that the question can be solved properly.\n\nQ: Did the French Foreign Minister hold any substantive talks with the Chinese leaders during his visit here?\n\nA: French Foreign Minister de Villepin starts his formal visit in China today. In the morning Foreign Minister Tang held talks with him which lasted three hours and a half. The talks were in-depth, extensive and fruitful. This is de Villepin’s first visit to China since he assumed office as foreign minister. France takes the rotating chair of this month’s Security Council and it is very important for both sides to exchange views on international issues of common concern. In the talks today, both sides exchanged views mainly on the DPRK nuclear question and the Iraqi question apart from bilateral relations.\n\nOn the DPRK nuclear question, Foreign Minister Tang said that efforts should be made at present to prevent the escalation of the situation and the key is to break the stalemate between the US and DPRK. Fortunately, the US, the DPRK and all the other parties concerned are of the view to solve the question peacefully through dialog. He reaffirmed the consistent position of China on the question.\n\nOn the Iraqi question, Tang said that the adoption of Resolution 1441fully showed the aspiration of the international community to solve the Iraqi question politically. Against the current backdrop, three points should be adhered. First, stick to inspection to make clear the question; secondly, support the work of the UN Movic and IAEA; and thirdly, major questions should be decided by the UN Security Council after listening to the opinions of all sides.\n\nSino-French relations have been developed smoothly recently and both sides expressed their satisfaction towards it. China has always attached importance to the role of France in the international affairs and hopes to develop further its comprehensive partnership with France of long-term stability. We maintain that to develop such relations with France will not only be good for both countries but also for world peace, stability and development.\n\nPresident Jiang and Vice Premier Wen will meet with de Villepin respectively this afternoon. He will also go to Shanghai after concluding his visit in Beijing and Mayor Chen Liangyu will meet with him.\n\nQ: You mentioned just now that Minister Tang expressed in this talks with his French counterpart that the key to prevent the DPRK nuclear question from further deteriorating is to break the stalemate between the US and the DPRK. Will China play a role in this regard and what specific role can it play?\n\nA: On the question of the DPRK nuclear question, the position of the Chinese side is very clear. It hopes to see peace and stability on the peninsular and the current crisis solved through dialog between parties concerned. In this regard, China has maintained close contact and consultation with all sides concerned and played a constructive role.\n\nQ: China Daily published a strong-worded article today criticizing the US military build-up in the Golf region. Is this a sign of hardened position on the Iraqi question? How does China evaluate Iraq’s cooperation with the UN after nearly two months’ inspection?\n\nA: On your first question, you’d better refer it to the editor-in-chief of China Daily. I am not responsible for explaining its article or editorial.\n\nOn your second question, we maintain that after the adoption of Resolution 1441, Iraq has put forward the report of its weapons of mass destruction in accordance with the provisions of the resolution and given full cooperation to the UN weapon inspectors in their work.\n\nQ: What agreements will the Chinese side sign with the French side during the visit of the French foreign minister? According to the report of New York Times, President Bush have a plan concerning Iraq, mainly on the arrangements after Saddam leaves Iraq, including controlling Iraq’s oil field and stationing troops there. What is your comment?\n\nA: On your first question, I have introduced the main activities of the French foreign minister in China and the main content of his talks with Foreign Minister Tang in the morning. According to what I know, there is no plan of signing any agreement between China and France. In the talks this morning, the two sides held an in-depth exchange of view on bilateral relations and exchange and cooperation between the two countries in some fields.\n\nYou’d better refer your second question to the US side.\n\nQ: Has the Chinese side finished the analyses and study of the report submitted by Iraq on its weapons of mass destruction? In addition, China announced recently that it would provide 200 million yuan of assistance to Myanmar. What is it used for? Including military cooperation?\n\nA: The Chinese side is still making serious and in-depth study into the Iraqi report. Though we have had some preliminary impression, we think that many content in the report need to be evaluated and judged through the on-site weapon inspection by the UN inspectors. Only with on-site inspection can we clarify relevant questions and make objective and fair evaluation of the Iraqi question.\n\nOn the relations between China and Myanmar and the visit to China by Senior General Than Shwe to China, the Chinese media have fully reported it. During the visit, he signed three important agreements with the Chinese leaders. One of it touches upon the economic and technological cooperation between the two countries which will further enhance their exchange and cooperation in the economic and social fields. According to what I know, the sides have not touched upon the military aspects.\n\nQ: You mentioned on many occasions that China hopes to maintain peace on the Korean peninsula. Can you specify how it will achieve it?\n\nA: I have stressed it on many occasions that we hope that various parties can resume dialog. Only through dialog can we solve the DPRK nuclear question, break the current stalemate, achieve denuclearization and promote the early realization of peace and stability on the peninsula. We are willing to do our part in this regard.\n\nQ: We are all clear what China stands on the DPRK nuclear question but we are not clear what China have done on pressuring the DPRK? Can you give us some information on such as whether the Chinese and DPRK sides hold frequent contact recently? In Beijing or in Pyongyang? On which level?\n\nA: China has maintained frequent contact and consultation with the parties concerned including the DPRK. Diplomatic activities are multi-faceted and some may be “quiet”."
