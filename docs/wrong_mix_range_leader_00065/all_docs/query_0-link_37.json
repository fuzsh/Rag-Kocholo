        "text": "The founder and chair of the private military contractor Blackwater USA appeared before Congress Tuesday to defend his company. Erik Prince was called before the House Xommittee on Oversight and Government Reform amid a public firestorm over the role of private military firms in Iraq and a string of probes into Blackwater’s conduct.\n\nErik Prince: “We strive for perfection. We try to drive towards the highest standards. But the fog of war and accidents and the bad guys just have to get lucky once.”\n\nBlackwater has come under heavy scrutiny since last month’s shooting in Baghdad in which up to 28 Iraqis were killed.\n\nCongressmember Dennis Kucinich: “So Blackwater’s shoot-first-and-don’t-ask-questions-later approach undermines the United States’ position and jeopardizes the safety of our soldiers. How much more do we need to know to conclude that the war against Iraq has been a disaster for the Iraqi people and for the people of this country, as well?”\n\nIn Burma, the military junta has intensified its crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising. Foreign diplomats say soldiers are pulling people from their homes in the middle of the night. Military vehicles are patrolling the streets vowing to arrest pro-democracy activists. Government employees are being forced to sign declarations of support to the junta. U.S. envoy Shari Villarosa says embassy staffers have found monasteries virtually empty or barricaded by the military. Estimates of those detained in the crackdown have entered the thousands. Agence France-Presse is reporting at least 1,700 people are being held at a college campus in Rangoon. The death toll remains unknown.\n\nBuddhist monk U Chee Hrape: “The SPDC (State Peace and Development Council) is out of their mind to solve the problem with violence and by killing a number of people, which is against their religion as a Buddhist country. Buddhists are not doing this killing.”\n\nMeanwhile, U.N. envoy Ibrahim Gambari wrapped up his four-day visit Tuesday after meeting with the junta chief Than Shwe and the detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won elections in 1990 but has been prevented from taking office.\n\nIn other Iraq news, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has announced plans to begin withdrawing British troops from the southern province of Basra.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Gordon Brown: “I believe that by the end of the year, the British forces, which have been 5,500, can be reduced to 4,500, and that by the end of the year, indeed by Christmas, a thousand of our troops can be brought back to the United Kingdom and to other purposes.”\n\nBrown made the comments in a surprise visit to Iraq. Basra residents welcomed the news.\n\nBasra resident: “We feel happy to hear the news, and God willing, they will all leave. We do not want any one of them to them to stay, so that welfare and security prevail in this country and from this nice city.”\n\nIn other news from Washington, President Bush is expected to issue the fourth veto of his presidency today on a bill expanding health insurance to millions of low-income children. Congress sent the bill to the White House on Tuesday. It calls for a $35 billion spending increase to the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as S-CHIP. The increase would be financed through a tax increase on cigarettes. Bush has promised a veto because he says the measure would encourage government-backed healthcare.\n\nAt the United Nations, Venezuela has renewed calls for the extradition of the CIA operative Luis Posada Carriles, wanted for the 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner that killed 73 people. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolás Maduro made the call at a speech before the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nVenezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolás Maduro: “We ask from here we want to ratify to the government of the United States the legal petition so that the terrorist Luis Posada Carriles be extradited according to international laws and be tried for the crimes committed in Latin America and the Caribbean against our people.”\n\nAnd in campaign news, a new poll shows Senator Hillary Clinton has opened a wide lead in the Democratic presidential race. The Washington Post says Clinton now has 53 percent support among Democrats. Her closest rival, Senator Barack Obama, is at 20 percent. The news comes as Clinton’s campaign announced leading Obama in the third-quarter fundraising race. Clinton pulled in $22 million over Obama’s $19 million. The Clinton campaign released the numbers as Obama gave an address to mark the five years since he gave his well-known speech against the invasion of Iraq. In a reference to Clinton, Obama said: “We need to ask those who voted for the war: How can you give the president a blank check and then act surprised when he cashes it?”"
