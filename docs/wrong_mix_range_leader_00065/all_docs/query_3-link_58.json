        "text": "The BMZ has been cooperating with Iraq since 2014. The country is one of the so-called nexus and peace partners of German development cooperation. For many years, German activities in Iraq were focused on supporting Syrian refugees, internally displaced Iraqis and the communities in northern and central Iraq that were hosting especially large numbers of displaced persons and refugees. Now that the IS has been pushed back, the focus of cooperation has shifted to rebuilding the country and promoting long-term reform processes.\n\nGermany has made about three billion euros available to Iraq since 2014 and is thus the second-largest donor after the US. About two billion euros of this total amount is from the budget of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).\n\nIn 2023, the BMZ will probably make around 130 million euros available to Iraq, of which just under 90 million euros is for crisis management, reconstruction and infrastructure (transitional development assistance (External link)) and for projects under the Special Initiative “Displaced Persons and Host Countries” (External link).\n\nThe BMZ wants to contribute to the political, social and economic stability in Iraq and help create the foundations for peaceful and inclusive coexistence. Germany is engaged in a wide variety of activities. It ranges from short-term refugee support to the reconstruction of liberated areas and all the way to support for long-term political reforms. Important aspects are social reconciliation, inclusive governance and economic development.\n\nThe main focus of German-Iraqi development cooperation is currently on the following core areas: “Peaceful and inclusive societies” and “Sustainable economic development, training and employment”. As Iraq is one of the five countries suffering most from the impacts of climate change and at the same time it is one of the world’s biggest producers of oil and as such contributing massively to the causes of climate change, the BMZ will in future focus its activities increasingly on climate issues and the environment and on economic transformation.\n\nUp to the end of 2022, German development cooperation activities were contributing towards improving the drinking water supply for about 3.5 million people and the sanitation and wastewater systems for more than 940,000 people. These activities included rebuilding and extending the drinking water systems in Mosul and Faida.\n\nThanks to the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and the training of about 2,400 healthcare staff, so far 3.9 million people have been given access to basic medical services. More than 300,000 people have benefited from psychosocial support and trauma counselling.\n\nFurthermore, more than 830 schools have been built or rebuilt and more than 2,700 teachers have been trained. More than 800,000 pupils have thus been given the chance to attend lessons in school.\n\nIn order to open up possibilities for people to find work and earn an income, the BMZ has been financing cash-for-work measures and has supported the establishment of business hubs and open access workshops (maker spaces) in Basra, Baghdad and Erbil. Thanks to these activities, just under 116,000 short- or long-term jobs have been created so far. More than 2,000 business start-ups have been supported, including around 100 start-ups in the IT and communications sector.\n\nIn Mosul and the region of Nineveh, German support has helped to rebuild more than 6,500 homes. Playgrounds and cultural and community centres have also been established or renovated. So far, more than 40,000 people have been able to find permanent homes. More than 227,000 people have participated in social activities that promote social cohesion."
