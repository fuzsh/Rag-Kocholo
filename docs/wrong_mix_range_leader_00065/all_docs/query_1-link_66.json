The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:30 p.m., in room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Jim Webb (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Senator Webb. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JIM WEBB, U.S. SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA Senator Webb. The subcommittee will come to order. This afternoon the East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee will examine American policy toward Burma, with particular reference to that country's strategic importance; the economic impacts of sanctions and other policies; and the potential effectiveness of the administration's recent decision to adjust policies toward the Burmese Government. As members of this committee are well aware, Burma sits at a crucial crossroads in Asia, sandwiched between India and China, with a long border next to Thailand and more than 1,000 miles of coastline along the Indian Ocean. This geostrategic position has greatly influenced Burma's history, and will continue to affect its long-term role in international politics. It has also given Burma more than 100 different ethnic groups, and numerous geographic divisions within its borders, all of which have combined to bring a great deal of turbulence inside the country, including now more than six decades of constant civil war. Burma's internal tensions, and the effects of its geographic position between the giant states of India and China, were exacerbated even further by more than 100 years of British Colonial conquest, which ended in 1948 in the aftermath of World War II. Then, as the newly independent country transitioned toward a democratic government, sectional and ethnic conflict and the assassination of national leader General Aung San instigated widespread instability, leading to a military coup against an elected parliamentary government in 1962. Since that time, Burma has been ruled by a military government, now called the State Peace and Development Council. Despite enduring conflict, the Burmese people, including officially its present military government, still seek a transition to civilian government and democracy. The student- led protests of 1988 demonstrated this desire to the world. In 1990, Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, won the majority of seats in an open election, but these results were annulled by the military government. In response to these events and to the military government's refusal to acknowledge the results of the 1990 election, the United States embarked upon a policy to isolate the regime and to impose economic sanctions. Over the past 20 years, these sanctions have steadily tightened, until now they have terminated nearly all commercial relations between our two countries. Our diplomatic relations have likewise been restricted. We have not had an ambassador in Rangoon since 1992. These tensions are a far cry from the deep historical relationship that our country has shared with the Burmese people, evidenced by our cooperation during World War II to defend the Burma Road and to keep supply lines open to Allied forces, and our later cooperation to retrieve the remains of those Americans who had died and whose bodies have never been recovered. And yet, the promise of Burma's democracy remains unfulfilled. It is within this historical and political context that I embarked last month on the first congressional visit to Burma in 10 years. This trip was part of a five-nation tour to assess American interests in the region overall and to advance the United States diplomatic, commercial, and cultural ties in that crucial part of the world. I first visited Burma as a private citizen in 2001, and even then was able to see firsthand the impact of our sanctions policy on the Burmese people. Last month, I became the first American official to meet with Senior General Than Shwe. I also had the opportunity to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi, who, unfortunately, remains under house arrest. Since my return, I and my staff have held numerous meetings with groups representing the entire spectrum of views regarding our policy toward Burma. From these meetings and from years of personal thought and action, I believe it can fairly be said that almost everyone in the West and inside Burma share the objective of a democratic, stable, prosperous Burma. The question for us is, How do we make progress toward that goal? Our isolation of Burma has resulted in a lack of attention to the region's strategic dynamics. Burma remains flanked by India and China, and is widely seen as being increasingly under China's sphere of influence. I believe that the political motivations behind our isolation of Burma were honorable, based on a desire to see democratic governance and a respect for human rights inside that country. At the same time, the situation we face with Burma is an example of what can happen when we seek to isolate a country from the rest of the world, but the rest of the world does not follow. Through the limits of our diplomatic and commercial ties, we have also limited our connections with the people of Burma and prevented them from seeing the best that a free society can offer. We limit aid for their development and intellectual exploration. Moreover, we limit opportunities to push for positive change, because we do not talk directly to the government in charge. So, the question, quite frankly, is whether this approach has brought Burma closer to democracy than when sanctions were first imposed. In February of this year, Secretary of State Clinton recognized this impasse and ordered a review of administration policy toward Burma. This review has been concluded. The preliminary results were announced last week at the Friends of Myanmar meeting in New York. Secretary Clinton announced that the United States would end its isolation of Burma, would directly engage the military government. I believe that this redirection is timely. Her representative, Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, is here to present these results in more detail, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss them with him. We are holding this hearing at a critical time. As I said to Burma's top leaders when I met with them in August, the world views the regime in terms of how it treats Aung San Suu Kyi. In order for the elections that are planned for 2010 to be perceived by the international community as credible, she and her party should be offered the opportunity to participate fully and openly in the process. Obviously, this could only be done if Aung San Suu Kyi is released from house arrest. If the military government's announced intentions to hold elections in 2010 do indeed go forward, this could be a major and decisive step in the future of that country. I believe the United States should watch for signs of progress, that we should reserve hasty judgment, that we should do all in our power to encourage this election process to be free, fair, and transparent. We and the international community must also be prepared to offer advice, counsel, and hopefully support in the interest of meaningful and stable long-term change. To discuss these and other issues before the subcommittee we have two panels of distinguished witnesses today. First, as I mentioned, I'd like to welcome Assistant Secretary Campbell, who will speak on the first panel. On the second panel, I welcome Thant Myint-U, who has come today from Bangkok; Dr. David Steinberg; and Professor David C. Williams, all three of whom I will introduce in greater detail before the panel begins. I believe that their combined years of experience will help us capture the complexity of the situation that we face, as well as offer us guidance for the way forward in United States-Burma policy. I thank our witnesses for being here with us today, and I look forward to their insights. And again, I would urge my colleagues and others to seek a more effective approach toward our Burma policy, to listen today with open ears, and to encourage, with a spirit of goodwill, a new dialogue here in the Senate and a dialogue that would examine our objectives and take a fresh look at the efficacy of our policy toward Burma. At this point, Senator Inhofe would be giving an opening statement. He is in another hearing at the moment, so I would ask that his opening statement be included in the record. [The prepared statement of Senator Inhofe follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. James M. Inhofe, U.S. Senator From Oklahoma Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing today on U.S. policy toward Burma. I understand that the Obama administration has apparently reexamined past approaches to our relations with Burma, and has decided upon a new policy of engagement. What that policy is and how it was arrived at I assume we will learn of today because up to this point there has been rather limited consultation with the Congress about it. I find it curious that there is in fact a new engagement policy in light of the violent crackdown on widespread demonstrations in Burma in September 2007; the announcement of fraudulent results of a national constitutional referendum held in the wake of Cyclone Nargis in May 2008; ongoing allegations of nuclear proliferation cooperation between Burma and North Korea, and the arrest, detention, trial and sentencing of opposition leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in the spring and summer of 2009. As you know, since 1988, the United States has imposed a wide range of sanctions against Burma. By 2004, these restrictions had terminated nearly all economic relations with Burma. The main sanctions currently are: a suspension of aid, including antinarcotics aid; opposition to new loans to Burma by the international financial institutions, a prohibition on U.S. companies from making new investments in Burma since 1997; a ban on imports from Burma affecting mainly imports of Burmese textiles but also precious stones and raw materials; a ban on travel to the United States by Burmese connected to the junta; and a ban on U.S. financial transactions with individuals and entities connected to the Burmese Government. In response to the suppression of the prodemocracy uprising in Burma in September 2007, the Bush administration also issued a number of Executive orders imposing financial and travel sanctions on named Burmese officials, Burmese companies, and Burmese businessmen. The United States has not had an ambassador to Burma since 1992 when this committee refused to confirm the nomination of an ambassador because of human rights abuses. Burma is also on the U.S. list of uncooperative drug-producing or transit countries. In 2006, the Bush administration succeeded in securing U.N. Security Council consideration of a U.S.-drafted resolution on Burma. The resolution called for the lifting of restrictions on civil and political liberties, the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners, negotiations between the ruling junta and opposition groups for a democratic transition, and a cessation of attacks and human rights abuses against ethnic minorities. However, China and Russia vetoed the U.N. resolution in January 2007. Currently--or at least until yesterday when I understand Assistant Secretary Campbell met with the Burmese Attorney General and Science Minister up in New York--the United States strongly criticized the ruling military junta at international conferences attended by Burma, and we by and large refuse to meet bilaterally with Burmese counterparts. Keeping in mind this diplomatic history and congressional involvement in imposing and enforcing multiple U.S. sanctions regimes on Burma, any new policy seeking engagement will be viewed with great suspicion from inside and outside of the legislative branch. And simply basing a new policy on the fact that an existing policy has not achieved the desired results is no basis for a new strategy. Mr. Chairman, you have recently traveled to Burma and the region, and I have read that you have your own ideas regarding engagement. So in addition to listening to the administration's reasons for adopting a policy of engagement, I look forward to exploring your ideas today and in the months to come on this subcommittee. Thank you. Senator Webb. And then I would like to go ahead and welcome Secretary Campbell. Prior to his confirmation in June 2009, Secretary Campbell was a CEO and cofounder of the Center for a New American Security and concurrently served as a director on the Aspen Strategy Group. He has served in several capacities in government, including as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asia and the Pacific; as a director on the National Security Council staff; as deputy special counselor to the President for NAFTA in the White House; and as a White House fellow in the Department of the Treasury. Secretary Campbell has been asked today to testify about the administration's new policy and how to chart a new course for American and Burma relations. I appreciate you being here today, Secretary Campbell, and the floor is yours. STATEMENT OF HON. KURT CAMPBELL, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC AFFAIRS, DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, DC Mr. Campbell. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate this opportunity to appear before this committee. Thank you for your service in this capacity, and in many others to our Nation over a very distinguished career. I'd like to formally submit my prepared testimony for the record, and, if I may, just summarize a few key points to give us an opportunity for some give and take, if that's OK. Senator Webb. Your full statement will be entered in the record at this point. Mr. Campbell. Thank you very much, Senator. Mr. Chairman, thank you for inviting me here today to testify about United States policy toward Burma, and a possible new direction for United States-Burma relations in this critical period. Let me take this opportunity to brief you on the overarching assessments that helped shape our review. The administration launched a review of our Burma policy 7 months ago, after Secretary Clinton's comments, recognizing that political and humanitarian conditions in Burma were deplorable. Neither sanctions nor engagement, when implemented alone, have succeeded in improving those conditions and moving Burma forward on a path to democratic reform. In addition to taking a hard look at the concerns regarding Burma's relationship internally, we've also looked at some issues associated with North Korea, particularly in light of the passage of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874, and we can talk about that more in our subsequent discussion. In the process of putting this review together, we've consulted widely throughout the review process with Congress; with other governments in the region, particularly in Southeast Asia, but also with China and India; key stakeholders such as nongovernment organizations, business leaders, academics; and representatives of international organizations. It's also important to underscore, we have consulted with the National League for Democracy and other democratic activists inside and out of Burma, and also representatives from various ethnic groups. I think it's important to say, here, just a word about those consultations. Over the course of the last several days, as we've entered a critical period, and during the period where Secretary Clinton rolled out some of our early findings at the Friends of Burma last week, I think we heard quite clearly, from both staff and members, that the administration did not do a good enough job, particularly for the last phase, on consultation. I think that's absolutely right. And one of the things that's clear is that this policy, and the overall approach of the United States to Burma and to the region, has been very firmly grounded, not just in executive policy decisions, but also in the will and the engagement and the passion of the legislative branches. And so, we need, going forward, to do a better job. And I want to personally suggest that I need to do a better job, going forward on this. And I commit to the people in the room, here, who work so hard on these issues, to do my best to attain a high goal of consultations, going forward. The conclusions of our policy review, just announced this week, reaffirmed many of our fundamental interests in Burma. We, as you know, support a unified, peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Burma. While our goals in Burma remain the same as before, the policy review confirmed that we need additional tools to augment those that we had been using in pursuit of our objectives. A policy of pragmatic engagement with the Burmese authorities holds the best hope for advancing our goals. A central element of this approach is a direct senior-level dialogue with representatives of the Burmese leadership. Through a direct dialogue we will be able to test the intentions of the Burmese leadership and the sincerity of their expressed interest in a more positive relationship with the United States. The way forward will be clearly tied to concrete actions, on the ground and in the surrounding region, on the part of the Burmese leadership addressing our core concerns, particularly in the areas of democracy and human rights. In that respect, Senator, I'd like to associate myself with the statement that you have just made. We will work to ensure that the Burmese leaders have an absolutely clear understanding of our goals for this dialogue and the core issues in our agenda. An improved United States-Burma relationship will require real progress on democracy and human rights. We will continue to press for the unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners, an end to conflicts with ethnic minority groups, accountability of those responsible for human rights violations, and the initiation of a genuine dialogue among the Burmese Government, the democratic opposition, and the ethnic minorities on a shared vision for the way forward in Burma. This last issue is critical, since only the Burmese people themselves can determine the future of their country. Our intent is to use our dialogue with the Burmese authorities to facilitate that process. Only if the Government of Burma makes progress toward these goals will it be possible to improve our bilateral relationship in a step-by-step process. Now, it's important to understand what recent steps have been taken. We held our first meeting with Burmese authorities in New York yesterday. I led the U.S. delegation along with Scot Marciel, my excellent deputy, and our team. And my counterpart on the Burmese side was U Thaung, the Burmese Minister for Science and Technology, and, as many of you know, the former Ambassador to the United Nations. The Burmese permanent representative to the United Nations also participated in the discussion, as well as a few other individuals who came in specially from the capital for these sessions. These were substantive talks over several hours that lasted into the evening. We laid out very clearly our views, and I stressed to U Thaung that this is an opportunity for Burma, if it is ready to move forward. This was an introductory meeting, I want to underscore that. It will take more than a single conversation to resolve our differences, and we have not yet scheduled a second session, and no decisions have been made about venue or level for the next set of talks. And we will keep you informed as this process moves ahead. Already, after about 16 hours since the conclusion of these discussions, I've had many people ask me the question, ``Now, what are you going to do when these talks fail?'' I would simply say, we're at the very early stages of this. Let's give this at least a little bit of a chance, going forward. In parallel to the dialogue on our core democracy, human rights, and nonproliferation concerns, we hope to identify some initial positive steps the Burmese could take in other areas that would help build momentum in the talks and could potentially allow the United States to respond in an appropriate manner. There are a number of areas in which we've had a tentative discussion. We might be able to improve cooperation to our mutual benefit, such as in the area of counternarcotics, health issues, environmental protection, the recovery of World War II Missing-in-Action remains, and the potential provision of humanitarian assistance. Our dialogue with Burma will supplement, rather than replace, the sanctions regime that has been at the center of our Burma policy for many years. Lifting or easing sanctions at the outset of a dialogue, without meaningful progress on our concerns, would be a mistake, and would send the wrong message. We will maintain our existing sanctions until we see concrete progress, and continue to work with the international community to ensure that those sanctions are effectively coordinated. We believe any easing of sanctions now would send the wrong signal to those who have been striving for so many years for democracy and progress in Burma, to our partners in the region and elsewhere, and to the Burmese leadership itself. Through our dialogue we also will make clear to the Burmese leadership that relations with the United States can only be improved in a step-by-step process if the Burmese Government takes meaningful actions that address our core concerns. Moreover, we will reserve the option of tightening sanctions on the regime and its supporters to respond to events in Burma. I also want to underscore a point that you have made, Senator, on several occasions. We need to step up our dialogue, not only with our partners in Southeast Asia, but other countries who are deeply involved, both economically and politically, inside the country. We've already begun that process with Japan, and I think you will see, over the course of the next several months, a deeper dialogue with both China and India, to get a greater sense of what their goals and aspirations are in Burma, going forward. Senator, these are the essentials of our approach. We are at the very earliest stages, and I look forward to answering any questions. And again, I want to commit to you and the staffs that are here that we will work as hard as possible to consult at every level before an engagement, during, and after. And thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. [The prepared statement of Mr. Campbell follows:] Prepared Statement of Kurt Campbell, Assistant Secretary of State, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC Mr. Chairman, Senator Inhofe, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here today to testify about U.S. policy toward Burma and a possible new direction for United States-Burma relations. Let me take this opportunity to brief you on the overarching assessments that helped shape our review. The administration launched a review of our Burma policy 7 months ago, recognizing that political and humanitarian conditions in Burma were deplorable. Neither sanctions nor engagement, implemented alone, have succeeded in improving those conditions and moving Burma forward on a path to democratic reform. Moreover, it was clear to us that the problems Burma presents, not only to its people, but to its neighbors, the wider region and the world at large, demand that we review and reconsider our approach. In addition to taking a hard look at the current situation inside Burma, we also focused on emerging questions and concerns regarding Burma's relationship with North Korea, particularly in light of the passage of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874, which prohibits Member States from engaging in trade with North Korea in virtually all conventional weapons as well as in sensitive technologies, including those related to ballistic missiles and nuclear and other WMD programs. Our policy review also was informed by the fact that, for the first time in recent memory, the Burmese leadership has shown an active interest in engaging with the United States. But, let me be clear: We have decided to engage with Burma because we believe it is in our interest to do so. We have consulted widely throughout the review process with Congress, other governments, and key stakeholders such as nongovernmental organizations, business leaders, academics, and representatives of international organizations. We also have consulted with the National League for Democracy and other democratic activists inside Burma. The conclusions of our policy review, just announced this week, reaffirmed our fundamental interests in Burma: We support a unified, peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Burma. While our goals in Burma remain the same as before, the policy review confirmed that we need additional tools to augment those that we have been using in pursuit of our objectives. A policy of pragmatic engagement with the Burmese authorities holds the best hope for advancing our goals. A central element of this approach is a direct, senior-level dialogue with representatives of the Burmese leadership. As the Secretary previewed in her remarks to the Friends of Burma last week, we hope a dialogue with the Burmese regime will lay out a path forward toward change in Burma and a better, more productive bilateral relationship. Through a direct dialogue, we will be able to test the intentions of the Burmese leadership and the sincerity of their expressed interest in a more positive relationship with the United States. The way forward will be clearly tied to concrete actions on the part of the Burmese leadership addressing our core concerns, particularly in the areas of democracy and human rights. We will also discuss our proliferation concerns and Burma's close military relationship with North Korea. Burma has said it is committed to comply fully with U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874. Nevertheless, we remain concerned about the nature and extent of Burma's ties with North Korea. Full and transparent implementation of these resolutions is critical to global peace and security, and we will be looking to the Burmese authorities to deliver on their commitments. We expect engagement with Burma to be a long, slow, and step-by- step process. We will not judge the success of our efforts at pragmatic engagement by the results of a handful of meetings. Engagement for its own sake is obviously not a goal for U.S. policy, but we recognize that achieving meaningful change in Burma will take time. We will work to ensure that the Burmese leaders have an absolutely clear understanding of our goals for this dialogue and the core issues on our agenda. A fundamentally different United States-Burma relationship will require real progress on democracy and human rights. We will continue to press for the unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners; an end to conflicts with ethnic minority groups; accountability of those responsible for human rights violations; and the initiation of a genuine dialogue among the Burmese Government, the democratic opposition, and the ethnic minorities on a shared vision for the way forward in Burma. This last issue is critical, since only the Burmese people themselves can determine the future of their country. Our intent is to use our dialogue with the Burmese authorities to facilitate that process. Only if the Government of Burma makes progress toward these goals will it be possible to improve our bilateral relationship in a step-by-step process. In parallel to the dialogue on our core democracy, human rights, and nonproliferation concerns, we hope to identity some initial positive steps the Burmese could take in other areas that would help build momentum in the talks and could potentially allow the United States to respond in an appropriate manner. There are a number of areas in which we might be able improve cooperation to our mutual benefit, such as counternarcotics, health, environmental protection, and the recovery of World War II-era Missing-in-Action remains. Our dialogue with Burma will supplement rather than replace the sanctions regime that has been at the center of our Burma policy for many years. Lifting or easing sanctions at the outset of a dialogue without meaningful progress on our concerns would be a mistake. We will maintain our existing sanctions until we see concrete progress, and continue to work with the international community to ensure that those sanctions are effectively coordinated. We believe any easing of sanctions now would send the wrong signal to those who have been striving for so many years for democracy in Burma, to our partners in the region and elsewhere, and to the Burmese leadership itself. Through our dialogue, we also will make clear to the Burmese leadership that relations with the United States can only be improved in a step-by-step process if the Burmese Government takes meaningful actions that address our core concerns. Moreover, we will reserve the option of tightening sanctions on the regime and its supporters to respond to events in Burma. Some argue that sanctions should be lifted immediately because they hurt the people of Burma without effectively pressuring the regime. U.S. sanctions, implemented after the crackdown that began in September 2007, have been ``targeted''--aimed not at the people of Burma but at the military leadership, its networks and state-owned companies, and the wealthy cronies that support the government often through illicit activities. It is also important to keep in mind the nature of the country's economic system. Decades of economic mismanagement by Burma's military leadership have resulted in high inflation, endemic corruption, and poor regulation, which have stifled broad-based economic growth. Burma had an unfriendly business environment well before the imposition of sanctions by the United States, the European Union, Canada, and others. The country will continue to be an inhospitable place to invest unless the government introduces serious reforms, rule of law, and good governance. We believe that opening up Burma to the outside world can benefit the forces of change working for a better future for the people of this troubled country. Our commitment to the Burmese people is unwavering. We will continue to address the urgent humanitarian needs of the population by expanding our assistance efforts in a manner designed to help those most in need without bolstering the regime. We know it can be done. In the wake of Cyclone Nargis, the U.S. Government provided nearly $75 million in aid to the victims of the cyclone through responsible and effective international NGO partners. We also have broadly licensed financial support of not-for-profit humanitarian activities in Burma, and continue to take care to ensure that U.S. sanctions do not impede humanitarian activities by NGOs. Regarding the elections that the Burmese regime plans to hold in 2010, we need to assess the conditions under which the elections will be held and determine whether opposition and ethnic groups will be able to participate fully. We do not yet know the date of the elections; the authorities also have not published the election laws. Given the way in which the Burmese Government conducted its referendum on a new Constitution in the immediate aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, we are skeptical that the elections will be either free or fair. We will continue to stress to the Burmese authorities the baseline conditions that we consider necessary for any credible electoral process. They include the release of political prisoners, the ability of all stakeholders to stand for election, eliminating restrictions on media, and ensuring a free and open campaign. We will emphasize, and ask that others do the same, that the 2010 elections will only bring legitimacy and stability to the country to the extent that they are broad-based and include all key stakeholders. This is why it is crucial for the regime to begin an internal dialogue now with democratic opposition leaders and representatives of the ethnic minorities. It is only through dialogue that the conditions can be established for all of Burma's political forces to participate. We also intend to remain engaged with the democratic opposition to ensure that our engagement with the regime is not at cross purposes with their own objectives. We recognize that we alone cannot promote change in Burma. We will need to work with friends and partners to achieve our goals, including stepped up dialogue and interactions with countries such as China and India that have traditionally close relationships with Burma's military leaders. We will continue to coordinate closely as well with ASEAN, the EU, Australia, Canada, Japan, and other actors such as the U.N. to reinforce our fundamental message on reform to the Burmese regime. We will work with our partners to encourage Burma to be more open and to promote new thinking and new ideas. Although we hope to initiate these efforts immediately, we are realistic about our expectations. We must be prepared to sustain our efforts beyond the planned 2010 elections. Some day a new generation of leaders in Burma will come to power. If the country is more open to the outside world we can hope to influence that transition and encourage Burma's leaders to take a more positive, constructive, and inclusive path. The process of dialogue itself should give us greater insight into the thinking of Burma's political leadership and offer opportunities to influence the way in which they look at the world. Pressing for greater openness and exposure to new ideas and new thinking, particularly among members of the up-and-coming generation of leaders is likely, in the long run, to be the most effective means of encouraging change in Burma. Thank you for extending this opportunity to me to testify today on this pressing and vitally important issue. I welcome any questions you may have. Senator Webb. Thank you very much for that summary of your testimony, Secretary Campbell. Before I go into questions, let me first say that there are a number of other Senators who have indicated an interest in submitting statements for the record. The record will be open for 24 hours following the closing of this hearing for any other member who wishes to submit a statement. And I also should say that we've had an extraordinary amount of interest outside of the Congress in this hearing, and in this issue, and there are, at the moment, eight additional statements from the record from individuals and groups who had communicated with us and asked that their statements be part of this hearing record: Mr. Min Zaw Oo; the International Crisis Group; a long open letter from a number of nongovernmental organizations; Mr. Thet Win, U.S. Collection Humanitarian Corps; Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Center for Public Health and Human Rights at Johns Hopkins; USA Engage; the National Bureau of Asia Research; and U.S.-ASEAN Business Council; Thihan Myo Nyun, who submitted a very lengthy Law Review article on the impact of sanctions. All of these statements will be included in the record. [Editor's note.--The Law Review article, which was too voluminous to include in the printed hearing, will be maintained in the permanent record of the committee. The remaining articles also mentioned above can be found in the ``Additional Material Submitted for the Record'' section starting on page 52.] Senator Webb. And, as a courtesy to others who are here today, if there are statements that other groups or individuals wish to have included in the record, we'll have a 24-hour period where you can also submit statements through the committee and through our staff. Secretary Campbell, I'm going to read an excerpt from a letter--and I'm going to read it also to our panel, when they come--that was sent to me by Mr. Kent Wiedemann, who was the chief of the American Embassy in Rangoon in the late 1990s, was also at one point our Ambassador to Cambodia, and also Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs. He sent me this letter upon my return from my Southeast Asian visit. And I'm going to read a couple of sentences out of this letter, and I'd like to get your thoughts, or the thoughts of the administration, on this. He said, ``I frequently met with Aung San Suu Kyi during my service from 1996 to 1999. Her aim was to form a transitional coalition government with the military as a first step toward eventual democracy. At her request, I conveyed that message to the SPDC senior leaders. I also relayed Suu Kyi's pledge to eschew any punitive legal action against them if agreements were reached on a political transition. Suu Kyi saw the United States and other international sanctions as tactical tools to draw the SPDC into a dialogue. U.S.-based human rights activists did not accept Suu Kyi's vision for political compromise. Instead they saw sanctions as weapons to force regime change. I believe that our escalation of pressure on the regime did much harm and little good.'' Do you have a reaction to his observation? Mr. Campbell. Well, there are many sentiments reflected in Kent's letter. In addition to the service that you indicated, he also served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, and I had the honor to succeed him in that job at the Pentagon. He's a very fine officer. I don't know, Senator, if I'd like to comment directly about what his particular views are at that juncture, but I think I can say a little bit about what we would expect, going forward. In our deliberations and our discussions with interlocutors, we've been very clear that we'd like to see an enhanced dialogue on a range of issues. On the 2010 elections, as you know Aung San Suu Kyi has, in a recent letter, indicated a desire to begin dialogue on sanctions. We'd like to see her have the opportunity to interact more freely with visitors, both outside of the country, like yourself, but also members of her own party and other groups inside Burma, and more dialogue between the government and herself. And we think that this is an appropriate next step, in terms of domestic developments inside the country. And we've communicated that very clearly to our interlocutors. The issues of sanctions is more complicated. I don't pretend to know what Aung San Suu Kyi really believes about sanctions in the current situation, because there's been so little discussion in dialogue with her. I am struck, however, that she has indicated that she's prepared to have a dialogue about sanctions, going forward. I would simply say that the point that you have made, and that Secretary Clinton has made in recent months, is that the sanctions effort, while providing an inconvenience in many respects to the regime--and there are areas that they can be very effective--in the overall context, has been unsuccessful in accomplishing the goals that, really, all of us have, vis-a- vis Burma. We've seen a substantial increase in investment from China, from India, from other countries in Southeast Asia, from Europe, and from Japan. And so, the fact remains that the American sanctions, the U.S. sanctions, are an important tool at this juncture, but I think we fully recognize the limitations of that overall approach. I must also say that from a variety of, I think, respected sources, including the IMF studies, some of the observations of key players in our own Embassy, and other economic observers who've traveled and spent a lot of time inside the country, I think there is a view that some of the problems--in fact, a substantial component of the problems that Burma faces economically--are a result of, really, tragic mismanagement of the economy by the regime, and that any process that's forward- looking over a period of years will involve not only political reform, but economic reform. And that kind of process will indeed involve a more intense engagement of the international community, moving forward. Senator Webb. Thank you for that. And I would also add, in terms of being careful about characterizing the comments of Aung San Suu Kyi, I fully agree with you. It was a situation that I faced---- Mr. Campbell. Yes. Senator Webb [continuing]. After my meeting with her, when I was asked, in the media, to give her assessments on a number of areas, including sanctions; and out of respect for her inability to openly answer, I declined to do that. However, in the past week or so she has issued a statement, apparently written with the cooperation of one of her advisers, that in some form apparently supports the administration's new approach, and also has indicated a willingness to discuss cooperation with this regime, in terms of ways to address the sanctions issue. Do you have any, or does the administration have any, specific knowledge of what her statement---- Mr. Campbell. Yes. And---- Senator Webb [continuing]. Implies? Mr. Campbell. That's what I was referring to, Senator. We have seen at least purported copies of this that have been discussed. I think they do suggest, as you indicated, that this is a critical time, there are a lot of pieces that are now in motion that have not been in motion for some time. There is-- from our discussions yesterday--I wouldn't want to characterize them--certainly no breakthroughs, but a very clear determination that dialogue was possible on the side of Burma. I think the United States--we prepared intensively, we laid out what our goals were and how we would want to go about a dialogue. We've seen your trip, we've seen some other interactions with the United Nations, we've seen some steps at the Friends of Burma meeting last week at the United Nations, and we've seen Aung San Suu Kyi write this letter that, I think, does indicate a desire to move forward, to work in a constructive dialogue, not only with the international community, but with the government and other elements inside her country. And I must say, I think the point that she has made, that we think we understand, is that she welcomes the U.S. approach, but she believes that there should be a parallel dialogue with the opposition. And we support that. And indeed, if and when a team or a group goes, at some point in the future, from the executive branch, we would expect to have access and the opportunity to have a dialogue along the lines that she has set forward. Senator Webb. What is the view of the administration with respect to the elections process, the constitution, and the potential timing of implementing legislation, and the timing of the elections following the implementing legislation? Mr. Campbell. Yes. I think, as you've seen, Senator--you've closely scrutinized our statements, and watched carefully-- we've tried to indicate that we're really taking a measured approach at this juncture. We think there needs to be much greater clarity on behalf of the government about what their expectations are. They've been very unclear about certain aspects and manifestations of the 2010 elections. There is a clear desire for a greater dialogue inside the country. One of the things that we heard during the process of consultations is that there obviously is great distrust from some of the opposition groups and ethnic groups about this coming election--they viewed the referendum as being illegitimate--and that concerns were that, unless some significant changes were made in the constitution, that this would follow on in a similar path. I think right now what's important for the United States-- although we have our reservations, and we've stated those very clearly--but, in the current environment, we think much more dialogue and discussion inside the country is an essential first step. And even then it's not clear where we will end up. We communicated yesterday in our interactions that that was our view, that such a dialogue was of critical importance, and that, if it were implemented like the referendum, that, in fact, it would get virtually no international support or recognition. Senator Webb. What is the administration's view, in terms of the role of China in this process? And what would be the incentive for China to encourage a more open and democratic society in Burma? Mr. Campbell. Senator, that's a great question. And again, you're a person who focuses closely on Asian developments. It's hard, in the current environment, to put yourself in the leader's shoes in Beijing, but I would simply say that, looking into the future, you have several countries on China's periphery, on its direct borders, that face very worrisome futures. I mean, you pointed out the tortured history of Burma; ethnic divisions accentuated by British Colonial rule, lots of challenges there in recent decades; a nuclear-inspired North Korea; questions about long-term leadership issues; problems in Pakistan. And so, you've got many countries directly on their border that confront the prospect of profound internal instability. And we think that, at some level, China has an interest in a process inside the country that leads to greater stability, some greater openness, and greater transparency. We are not naive. There are limits to that. But, clearly on the current path, there are very real concerns about Burma's future. At the same time, I think a dialogue can be important in many respects. A dialogue can be important because it can remind a country that another country has a strong interest in a region. And I think the truth is that the United States has to step up its game, generally, in Asia, and particularly in Southeast Asia. And so, a dialogue with both China and India, I think, can yield greater information about the goals, assessments, and general plans of both governments. I am struck, Senator, just over the course of the last several months being deeply involved in this, because of the lack of dialogue, because in many respects of the lack of engagement in certain areas, our level of knowledge and dialogue is quite limited. And I think one of the goals of this process, going forward, is to get a much more granular sense of developments, both inside Burma, but in the surrounding region. I myself am one that believes that, in many respects, the Indian Ocean region is going to be of dynamic importance in the future, and knowing more is going to be a critical component of what we need to do in the future. Senator Webb. It's also going to be a critical component of what China does in the future. Mr. Campbell. I agree with that. Senator Webb. Would you see any particular incentive on the part of China, in terms of the economic advantage that it now has in Burma, if the situation were to change? Mr. Campbell. You know, it's probably too early to tell. We've really not had--our discussions to date at the highest level, Senator, with China, on regional issues, have focused more on North Korea, Iran, and Pakistan and Afghanistan. I think we're at the very early stages of a higher level dialogue, and one of the things that I would commit to the staff is that, as this process develops--I plan to go to China in the next 2 weeks to begin that process--I will report on what I hear back and what I think. If you look at the statements that have come out of the Foreign Ministry in the last couple of days, I think they'd be--about this process of engagement--I would say that they are measured. I think that there's a cautious welcoming of a dialogue. And a statement on the part of Chinese officials that their own view that sanctions are unhelpful will test some of those propositions in a direct dialogue with them over the course of the coming months. Senator Webb. I'll look forward to continuing that dialogue here on the subcommittee, as well. Do you know how much assistance the United States currently provides directly to Burma? Mr. Campbell. I know that we provided, during--in the immediate aftermath of the cyclone, about $75 million. We provide substantial assistance to the border areas. In fact, that, in many respects, is a part of a very strong congressional commitment, in Thailand in particular, to refugees, to civil resettlement issues, and to some humanitarian assistance. Senator, I would have to get back to you directly with the total amount of assistance that is given beyond what has been provided in the aftermath of cyclone. Senator Webb. One of the statements that was given to us to be made a part of the record is from an individual, who is a Burmese exile, who has written in great detail about possible movements in the future. And, in essence, one of the comments that was made is that the United States should reconsider funding priorities out of the economic support fund, his comment, ``a significant portion of which is usually channeled to assist exile groups conducting covert operations inside the country.'' Do we have any knowledge of that? Mr. Campbell. We do provide--and I think, again, Congress has really played a leadership role--we have provided substantial support for displaced groups, individuals, and ethnic communities along the Thai border, and that has gone on for decades. And on the subsequent question that you asked, I think probably another forum would be better to address that particular issue. Senator Webb. All right. We'll pursue that in another forum, you and I. Does the administration have any position on the activities of other entities inside the country that are conducting military or quasi-military operations against the existing government right now? Mr. Campbell. I think we've stated very clearly our goals for Burma: A peaceful, democratic, stable government. And in our direct dialogue, we've made very clear that the United States has no military ambitions or objectives of any kind inside the country. I think sometimes, as you know, we hear, from their senior leadership, a sense that they are encircled, that the United States is planning offensive operations against them, and I think part of this dialogue would be to make very clear that there's no such thinking inside the U.S. Government. Senator Webb. Well, I appreciate your saying that for the record. I think that's something we do need to make sure that's being said as we pursue this process. My question was really relating to the different ethnic groups inside the country, and the level of opposition that might still exist to the current government. Mr. Campbell. Well, our longstanding policy, and statements generally, make clear our strong criticism of military actions against ethnic groups inside Burma. There are many, as you have underscored, Senator. Many of them are extraordinarily well armed and have had almost, in some respects, a semiautonomous existence for decades. We think that the best approach, going forward, is a process of internal dialogue. We recognize that such a process is fraught--extraordinarily difficult, and we believe that some initial steps are going to be necessary in order to bring that about. Senator Webb. You also made a point on Monday, and then again today, regarding the concern that Burma comply with its international nonproliferation obligations, particularly in regard to North Korea. Do we have any indication that Burma is noncompliant with these obligations? Mr. Campbell. Let me answer in two parts to that question, Senator. The first part--the first part is, in greater detail, we can talk about this in another venue, like the previous question. However, I can say this. I think, as we've talked about privately, Senator Clinton underscored in her comments at the ASEAN regional forum that we have seen some steps between North Korea and Burma that concern us, both in the provision of small arms and other military equipment, and there are some signs that that cooperation has extended into areas that would be prohibited by U.N. Resolution 1874. And one of the inspirations, and one of the goals, of this dialogue between the United States and Burma is to make very clear what our expectations are in this respect. It is also the case that one of the ships that we think was bound for Burma in the July timeframe was turned back to North Korea, and we think that the government played a role in that. And that's the kind of action that we would like to see replicated in many other areas. This is one of those areas, Senator, where I don't think there is conclusive evidence, but there is concern. And we will want to be following up on that closely. In our discussions with most of our regional partners, particularly Thailand, this is clearly an area that they would like greater transparency on from their next-door neighbors. Senator Webb. Does our State Department have indications that the NLD and other opposition groups are prepared to support the elections process? Mr. Campbell. I think that probably is--that goes too far, Senator. I think what we have are indications that they are prepared to sit down immediately in a dialogue about the elections, which, frankly, we think is an important first step, and an absolutely essential first step. And that would be something that we would seek to facilitate. Senator Webb. Along those lines, if the government itself were to request technical and other assistance with respect to the elections, is the State Department prepared to provide that? Mr. Campbell. I think it's premature at this juncture; but, under the right circumstances, we would consider it. Senator Webb. Secretary Campbell, thank you very much for your testimony today, I---- Mr. Campbell. Thank you, Senator. Senator Webb [continuing]. Think it's been very valuable, and we'll look forward to---- Mr. Campbell. Yes. Senator Webb [continuing]. Discussing a couple of these other---- Mr. Campbell. Yes. Senator Webb [continuing]. Matters, and we'll continue to be very interested in hearing them. Mr. Campbell. And I stand ready to do that, and I do want to commit again that we will work as closely as humanly possible with you, other members of the community, and the staff, as we proceed ahead. Senator Webb. And I want to emphasize something that I know you are aware of, and that's my great concern about the impact of China in this country, and how it directly relates to the national interest of the United States. And I would be very interested in hearing your views once you return from your trip to China. Thank you very much for testifying today. Mr. Campbell. Thank you. Thank you very much, it's good to see you again. Thank you. Senator Webb. We'll now hear from our second panel. And before I introduce them, I'd like to point out that Senator Boxer has asked that a statement be entered into the record, and it will be entered into the record at this point. [The prepared statement of Senator Boxer follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Barbara Boxer, U.S. Senator From California Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this important hearing today. I am very pleased that the Obama administration has concluded a comprehensive review of its policy toward Burma. According to statements from administration officials, the new U.S. policy toward Burma will leave in place existing sanctions until the Burmese Government makes significant progress on democratic reforms. But it will also focus on engagement with the Burmese authorities. I support engagement with the Burmese Government, because I agree with Secretary Clinton that sanctions alone ``have not produced the results that had been hoped for on behalf of the people of Burma.'' But what I do not support--and I say this is in the strongest possible terms--is a single dollar going to enrich the Burmese junta. General Than Shwe and the junta have done nothing but brutalize, silence, and repress the people of Burma in the nearly two decades since Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy Party were democratically elected to lead the country in 1990. The junta went so far as to significantly delay the delivery of humanitarian assistance in the wake of Cyclone Nargis. I, like many others, have watched in dismay as the Burmese Government has targeted Buddhist monks and nuns, labor leaders, democracy activists, journalists, artists, and many others for simply speaking their minds and voicing their opinions. Just 2 weeks ago, Human Rights Watch released a report entitled ``Burma's Forgotten Prisoners,'' which highlights the nearly 2,100 political prisoners languishing in Burma's jails for committing such ``crimes'' as peacefully expressing political views, associating with others, and forming independent organizations. Many were sentenced to decades in prison, and a few were even given sentences of more than 100 years. And just last month, Aung San Suu Kyi was sentenced to 18 additional months of house arrest--despite already serving 14 out of the past 20 years in confinement. This is simply unacceptable. Recently, the Burmese Government has indicated a desire to engage with the West, and that it will hold multiparty elections next year. But simply holding elections does not constitute a democracy. In a recent meeting with the Burmese Prime Minister, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon made clear that elections must be ``credible and inclusive.'' He also made it clear that this can only occur with the release of Burma's political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. I could not agree more. We must be vigilant in our efforts to ensure that any elections are free, fair, and fully representative of the Burmese people. I hope that the administration's new policy of engagement is successful. I hope we are closer to the day when the Burmese people can be free. And I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on this most important issue. Thank you. Senator Webb. And with that being said, I'm very pleased to welcome Dr. Thant Myint-U, Dr. David Steinberg, and Professor David Williams to this hearing. Dr. Myint-U is a historian, a former United Nations official. Following the 1988 prodemocracy uprising in Burma, he assisted Burmese refugees and asylum-seekers along the Thai- Burma border. He then spent 2 years in Washington, in part working on Burma issues for Human Rights Watch and the U.S. Committee for Refugees. Dr. Myint-U has served in three United Nations peacekeeping operations, in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moreover, in 2000 he joined the U.N. Secretariat in New York, first with the Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and then with the United Nations Department of Political Affairs, in 2004 becoming head of the policy planning unit in that department. He has received a number of research fellowships, is currently a visiting fellow at the Institute for Southeast Asia Studies in Singapore. He's the author of the best-selling, critically acclaimed, ``The River of Lost Footsteps,'' a personal history of Burma. And Dr. Myint-U has been kind enough to travel from Bangkok to participate in this hearing. We're very pleased to have you, Doctor. Dr. David Steinberg is a specialist on Burma, North Korea, and South Korea, Southeast Asia, and American policy in Asia. He's distinguished professor of Asian Studies at Georgetown University. From 1958 to 1962, Dr. Steinberg lived in Burma and worked for the Asia Foundation. He's also served as a member of the Senior Foreign Service; he was a director for technical assistance in Asia and the Middle East; director for the Philippines, Thailand, and Burma Affairs in USAID. He's the author of 13 books and monographs, including ``Turmoil in Burma: Contested Legitimacies in Myanmar,'' and ``Burma: The State of Myanmar.'' Dr. Steinberg, a great pleasure to have you with us today. Prof. David Williams is the John S. Hastings Professor of Law at Indiana University. He has written widely on constitutional design, Native American law, the constitutional treatment of difference, and the relationship between constitutionalism and political violence. He's also the coeditor and primary author of ``Designing Federalism in Burma,'' which was published in 2005, and is widely read in the Burma democracy movement. He's executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at Indiana University. Professor Williams consults with a number of reform movements abroad; he advises many elements of the Burma democracy movement on the constitutional future of that country. And we thank all of you for joining us today. Your full statements will be entered into the record. And we'll start with Dr. Myint-U. STATEMENT OF DR. THANT MYINT-U, HISTORIAN, SENIOR FELLOW, INSTITUTION FOR SOUTHEAST ASIAN STUDIES, BANGKOK, THAILAND Dr. Myint-U. Thank you very much, Senator, for inviting me here to participate in the panel. I believe very strongly that the policies of the United States and other Western governments over the past 20 years toward Burma have not worked. They have not been helpful in moving the country toward meaningful democratic change, and at the same time they have largely neglected the country's multiple ethnic and armed conflicts, as well as its pressing humanitarian challenges. As we move toward a very welcome review and adjustment of American policy, I think it's important to reflect on the history behind today's challenges, appreciate the critical and complex watershed that Burma today faces, and try to identify pragmatic ways forward. Senator, there's a myth that Burma emerged from British rule in 1948 as a peaceful democracy with all the attribute necessary for later success, only to fall mysteriously into dictatorship and extreme poverty. But, Burma in 1948 was actually already at civil war, its economy in ruins. And this civil war has continued until today. It is the longest running set of armed conflicts anywhere in the world, setting the Burmese Army against an amazing array of battlefield opponents, from the mujahideen along the former East Pakistan/Bangladesh border to Beijing-backed Communist rebels. State-building in Burma since then has gone hand in hand with warmaking, and the military regime today remains, at its core, a counterinsurgency operation. It was designed and built up to identify enemies, contain them, and crush them when possible. The men in charge may be motivated by desires for personal profit and power, but they also believe themselves to be patriots holding the country together. And after two generations of fighting foreign-backed rebellions, they are primed to see foreign conspiracies behind all opposition. In 1962, the army overthrew the last elected government, in part to pursue its counterinsurgency operations unhindered by civilian oversight. It established what it called the Burmese Way to Socialism, which nationalized all major businesses, expelled the country's Indian merchant class, and sought to isolate Burma from the world, banning nearly all international aid, trade, and investment. The military state that we knew today grew up and consolidated its rule in this self-created isolation. It is its default condition. These twin legacies--ethnic conflict and international isolation--have been instrumental for the consolidation and continuation of military rule. Progress toward peace, interethnic reconciliation, and the reintegration of Burma into the global community are essential if we are going to see any sustainable transition to civilian government. Yet, not only has there been little focus on these issues, but key opportunities in recent years, I believe, have been missed. Senator, the early and mid-1990s provided a unique chance to move Burma in the right direction. General Ne Win, who was the dictator of Burma since 1962, was then old and ailing, and a new generation of generals had come to the fore. The Chinese- backed Communist insurgency had collapsed, and cease-fires were agreed between the Burmese Army and more than two dozen different insurgent armies. While rejecting democratic reform, many in the new leadership wanted to end decades of self- imposed isolation and move toward a more free-market economy. Trade and investment laws were liberalized, and tourism encouraged for the first time in decades. Satellite television soon brought the world into millions of Burmese households, and travel in and out of the country became routine. The government sought development assistance from the U.N. and the IFIs, but U.S. and international policy should then have been to lock in these tentative steps, especially the cease-fires and market reforms, rather than ignore them, impose sanctions, cut off assistance, and insist on an immediate democratic transition. I am convinced that had we embraced these changes and used them then as opportunities to move toward a just peace, while also reconnecting Burma with the world, the democracy movement would today be in a far stronger position. Senator, I believe that sanctions have not only been ineffective in promoting democratic reform, but they have been hugely counterproductive in reducing Western influence, reinforcing isolationist tendencies, constraining moves toward market reforms, and decimating the position of the Burmese professional, managerial, and entrepreneurial classes. The last generation of U.S. and U.K.-educated technocrats has now retired, or is close to retirement, and very few in the bureaucracy or universities today have any foreign training. The country is in many ways far less prepared for a sustainable democratic transition today than it was in the early 1990s. We have to remember this: Politics in Burma, like everything, else operates on a landscape cultivated by over 60 years of war and 50 years of military dictatorship. Little will change without first transforming that landscape. Focusing on regime change at the top will simply not work. Sanctions and related divestment campaigns, and campaigns to minimize tourism, have drastically reduced chances for the emergence of new and outward-looking economic forces. The political economy, which has emerged under sanctions, based now on a few extractive industries and trade ties with a handful of regional countries, has proven particularly easy for the incumbent regime to control. Aid restrictions, restrictions on high-level contact and travel by senior Burmese officials, and embargoes on trade and investment all have had the direct if unintended consequence of reinforcing the status quo. Senator, I believe that Burma now faces a historic watershed, and, whatever happens, I am certain that the next 12 to 18 months will be the most important time in Burmese politics since the failed 1988 uprising. The current watershed, I believe, has at least three principal components. First is the civil war. Burma's civil war may either be nearing an end or entering a new and more violent chapter. There still exist more than two dozen distinct ethnic- based insurgent forces, fielding well over 40,000 troops in total. Vast areas of the country, in particular in the north and the east, are ruled by a mix of Burmese Army battalions, insurgent armies, and local militia. Though the cease-fire arrangements between the Burmese Army and nearly all insurgent forces remain, many are increasingly tenuous. In recent weeks we have seen the oldest of the cease- fires, the 20-year agreement between the Burmese Army and the Kokang militia, break down. The coming months may well see successful efforts by the Burmese Army to pressure or persuade the various armed groups to accept the new constitutional order, but a return to full-scale hostilities, though unlikely, is also far from impossible. Second is a generational transition within the armed forces. Most, if not all, the present army leadership will retire in the coming months, to be replaced by officers in their late forties and early fifties. This new generation will be the first to have risen to senior command without any significant combat experience, the first without training in the United States, and the first for whom the West, rather than China, has been portrayed as their main strategic threat. Third is the political transition under the new constitution. Entirely new political structures, including 14 state and regional governments, will be established in 2010, under the new constitution. Central power will at least nominally be bifurcated between a new and powerful President and a new armed forces commander in chief. General elections may or may not create an opening for more independent political voices, but the transition to a new constitutional setup will present, at the very least, a massive shakeup of existing systems of power and patronage. We do not know if the leadership will be able to manage the transition as they wish; 2010 may well throw up unexpected dynamics, especially as they come at the same time as major changes in the army's top ranks. Burma's relationship with her neighbors, in particular China, are also changing fast. The migration of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of ethnic Chinese into the country, the rapid expansion of Chinese business interests, and the construction of huge new infrastructure projects linking Burma to southwest China, including a massive Chinese oil pipeline designed to transport Middle Eastern and African oil across Burma to China's Yunnan province, will have an enormous impact on the Burmese economy and society, especially as they take place during a period of Western economic withdrawal. I have visited Burma often in recent years, at least 10 times since the beginning of 2007. This is a country where political opposition is violently repressed, and where there is an obvious desire for greater freedom and government accountability. But, it is also a country where there exists an increasingly vibrant civil society, a heavily censored but largely owned private media, widespread access to satellite television, an energetic contemporary music scene, extensive religious freedom, and a weak but resilient private sector. There are literally hundreds of genuinely independent local nongovernmental organizations in Burma today, as well as thousands of community-based organizations. I say all this not to deemphasize the political repression that takes place. This is a country where there is very little political freedom and an estimated 2,000 political prisoners of conscience. But, outrage itself, I believe, changes very little, and to move toward a more results-oriented approach, we need to see Burma in all its complexity. Senator, I support very much the administration's new support for increased humanitarian assistance, and scaling up of aid, I believe, should be a top priority. Burma has the 13th lowest GDP per capita in the world, and its child mortality rate is the second highest rate outside Africa, after Afghanistan. The average family spends, today, an estimated 75 percent of its small income on food. Burma has the highest HIV rate in Southeast Asia, and malaria is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Yet assistance to the Burmese people in 2007 was less than 4 U.S. dollars per capita internationally. Though this has increased in response to the cyclone last year, aid remains the lowest per capita among the 55 poorest countries in the world. By comparison, Zimbabwe received 41 U.S. dollars per capita, and Sudan 55. Tens of thousands of people a year literally die from treatable diseases. The United Nations, international and national NGOs and organizations are all able to deliver aid directly to needy people, but funding has fallen far short of what is necessary. Cyclone Nargis opened up the Irrawaddy Delta to unprecedented and almost unlimited access by international organizations and INGOs and local NGOs. Almost 4,000 aid workers operate there today in over 2,000 villages. Their work is significantly strengthening local civil society, yet funding for recovery efforts has been only a fraction of what is needed. A unique opportunity to help the Burmese people directly and support local civil society may be wasted without more financial support. Senator, though positive change in all areas will have to come from the inside, I believe the outside world can make a difference in enabling that change and making it sustainable. I would suggest, first, that we need to maximize elite exposure. Every scenario for political change in Burma depends on at least a degree of support from within the military establishment. Yet virtually nothing has been done to try to influence the mindset of the up-and-coming officer corps, or show them that other paths to stability and development exist. The isolation of the country's leadership from the rest of the world is a key pillar of the status quo, and its removal is critical for any lasting political change. Dialogue and cooperation on issues of mutual concern, such as disaster risk reduction, should be used toward this end. Second is to engage in dialogue on economic reform. Supporters of sanctions are correct when they say that poverty in Burma is not due primarily to sanctions, but to the chronic mismanagement of the economy. I favor lifting all economic sanctions, but I also favor more robust efforts to press for economic and related governance reforms, separate from any political agenda. I believe this should start with the removal of all restrictions on the U.N. system and the international financial institutions, especially the World Bank, in engaging the government, including at the highest levels. Third, we need not to forget the private sector. Humanitarian assistance and all other aid is needed now, but Burma is a country rich in natural resources, and situated between Asia's emerging economic giants, and should make sure it avoids becoming an aid-dependent country. Scaling up international assistance makes no sense if at the same time we are holding back--we are holding back, through broad economic sanctions, the possibilities for private-sector growth. We need to shift the debate away from sanctions and toward a practical discussion of the kind of trade and investment that would actually benefit ordinary people in Burma. U.S. sanctions crippled the emerging textile industry and threw 70,000 or more people out of work. Removing the ban on imports of garments from Burma would be a step, I believe, in the right direction. And if there are specific Burmese Government obstacles that stand in the way of direct economic engagement with the Burmese private sector, beyond a few top cronies, then I believe the removal of these obstacles should be at the center of dialogue with the Burmese authority. Fourth, I think we need to build capacity. No sustainable shift from military-to-civilian rule will be possible without radically increasing civilian administrative capacity, and capacity in society more generally. We cannot underestimate the impact that decades of self-imposed isolation and external sanctions have had on education standards and technocratic skills. Efforts to build capacity through training and scholarship should be actively promoted, including through international organizations. Finally, Senator, nothing I have said should suggest that any changes should be made in the long-term aims that we all share: a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Burma. In a country as ethnically and culturally diverse as Burma, only genuinely liberal democracy with strong local government institutions can, I believe, guarantee lasting stability. But-- we should not underestimate the real and practical challenges that exist between those aims and the situation today, but there can be no grand strategy from the outside, only efforts to use and build on opportunities as they come along. And seeing those opportunities will depend on being much more present on the ground, in direct contact with the Burmese people. And that is what I believe a new engagement-oriented approach should be all about. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Myint-U follows:] Prepared Statement of Dr. Thant Myint-U, Historian, Senior Fellow, Institution for Southeast Asian Studies, Bangkok, Thailand The policies of the United States and other Western governments over the past 20 years toward Burma have failed. They have not been helpful in moving the country toward meaningful democratic change and at the same time have largely neglected the country's multiple ethnic and armed conflicts as well as its pressing humanitarian challenges. As we move toward a very welcome review and adjustment of American policy, I think it's important to reflect on the history behind today's challenges, appreciate the critical and complex watershed Burma now faces, and try to identify pragmatic ways forward. war and state-building There is a myth that Burma emerged from British rule in 1948 as a peaceful democracy with all the attributes necessary for later success, only to fall mysteriously into dictatorship and extreme poverty. Burma in 1948 was actually already at civil war, its economy in ruins. And this civil war has continued until today. It is the longest running set of armed conflicts anywhere in the world, setting the Burmese army against an amazing array of battlefield opponents--from the mujahedeen along the former East Pakistan/Bangladesh border, to remnants of Chiang Kai-Shek's Nationalist Army, to drug-lords, to Beijing-backed Communist rebels, to Christian-led ethnic Karen insurgents in the jungles near Thailand. The Burmese army has been in the field uninterrupted for more than six decades. For the army, the history of these six decades has been the history of their fighting back, to hold the country together, from a time when they barely controlled the then-capital Rangoon, to today, when they believe they are within reach of a final victory. State-building in Burma has gone hand in hand with warmaking. And the military regime remains at its core a counterinsurgency operation. It was designed and built up to identify enemies, contain them, and crush them when possible. The men in charge may be motivated by desires for personal power and profit, but they also believe themselves to be patriots. And after two generations of fighting foreign-backed rebellions, they are primed to see foreign conspiracies behind all opposition. In 1962, the army overthrew the last elected government, in part to pursue its counterinsurgency operations unhindered by civilian oversight. It established what it called The Burmese Way to Socialism, which nationalized all major businesses, expelled the country's Indian merchant class, and sought to isolate Burma from the world, banning nearly all international aid, trade, and investment. The military state grew up and consolidated its rule in this self-created isolation. It is its default condition. These twin legacies--ethnic conflict and international isolation-- have been instrumental for the consolidation and continuation of military rule. Progress toward peace, interethnic reconciliation, and the reintegration of Burma into the global community are essential if we are going to see any sustainable transition to civilian government. Yet not only has there been little focus on these issues, but key opportunities in recent years have been missed. the end of burmese socialism and missed opportunities The early and mid-1990s provided a unique chance to move Burma in the right direction. General Ne Win, dictator of Burma since 1962 was old and ailing and a new generation of generals had come to the fore. The Chinese-backed Communist insurgency had collapsed and cease-fires were agreed between the Burmese army and more than two dozen different insurgent forces. While rejecting democratic reform, many in the new leadership wanted to end decades of self-imposed isolation and move toward a more free-market economy. Trade and investment laws were liberalized and tourism encouraged for the first time in decades. Satellite television soon brought the world into millions of Burmese households and travel in and out of the country, both legally and illegally became routine. The government sought development assistance from the U.N. and the International Financial Institutions. U.S. and international policy should have been to lock in these tentative steps, especially the cease-fires and market reforms, rather than ignore them, impose economic sanctions, cut off assistance, and insist on an immediate democratic transition. U.S. policy's near singular focus since 1988 on support for the democracy movement led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is understandable, especially given ongoing repression and her party's decisive win in the 1990 elections. In the early 1990s I was a staunch supporter of the toughest approach possible toward the regime and argued for comprehensive sanctions. I believe I was wrong and I had changed my mind by 1993 when I saw that sanctions were unlikely to ever really pressure the regime and were instead impeding the positive momentum that was there. There was political repression in Burma, but that's been the constant since 1962. What was different in the 1990s was the end of fighting across the north and northeast and the opening up of the economy. I am convinced that had we embraced these changes and used them as opportunities to move toward a just peace while also reconnecting Burma with the world, the democracy movement would be in a far stronger position today. the problem with sanctions Sanctions have not only been ineffective in promoting democratic reform, they have also been hugely counterproductive in reducing Western influence, reinforcing isolationist tendencies, constraining moves toward market reforms, and decimating the position of the Burmese professional, managerial and entrepreneurial classes. The last generation of U.S. and U.K. educated technocrats has now retired or is close to retirement, and very few in the bureaucracy or universities today have had any foreign training. The country is far less prepared for a sustainable democratic transition today than it was in the early 1990s. We have to remember this: Politics in Burma like everything else operates on a landscape cultivated by over 60 years of war and nearly 50 years of military dictatorship. Little will change without first transforming that landscape. Focusing on regime-change at the top will simply not work. Sanctions and related divestment campaigns and campaigns to minimize tourism have drastically reduced chances for the emergence of new and outward looking economic forces. The political economy which has emerged under sanctions, based now on a few extractive industries and trade ties with a handful of regional countries, has proven particularly easy for the incumbent regime to control. Aid restrictions, restrictions on high-level contacts and travel by senior Burmese officials, and embargos on trade and investment all have had the direct if unintended consequence of reinforcing the status quo. And to say that the government's own policies are also to blame do not absolve the role that U.S. and other Western sanctions have played in entrenching poverty and engendering a political economy that is the antithesis of one that could have thrown up positive social change. We need also to differentiate between punishment and pressure for change. Sanctions may be seen as a form of punishment, in the sense that the regime doesn't like them. But sanctions do not constitute pressure for change, quite the opposite, they strengthen the hand of those who are uninterested in further engagement with the outside world and in particular the West. Real pressure comes with increasing the regime's international exposure, creating new desires, and placing tough options on the table. Having to choose between Western sanctions and a handover of power is simple. But with greater international exposure, a choice between real policy change and improved governance on the one hand or a future as an impoverished dependency of China on the other won't be as easy. the present watershed Burma now faces a historic watershed, and whatever happens, I am certain that the next 12-18 months will be the most important time in Burmese politics since the failed 1988 uprising. The current watershed has at least three principal components: (1) First is the civil war. Burma's civil war may either be nearing an end or entering a new and violent chapter. There still exist more than two dozen distinct ethnic-based insurgent forces, fielding well over 40,000 troops in total. Vast areas of the country, in particular in the north and east are ruled by a mix of Burmese army battalions, insurgent armies and local militia. Though the cease-fire arrangements between the Burmese army and nearly all insurgent forces remain, many are increasingly tenuous. In recent weeks we have seen the oldest of the cease-fires, the 20-year agreement between the Burmese army and the Kokang militia break down. The coming months may well see successful efforts by the Burmese army to pressure or persuade the various armed groups to transform themselves into quasi-autonomous militia and accept the new constitutional order. But a return to full-scale hostilities, though unlikely, is also far from impossible. (2) Second is the generational transition within the armed forces. Most if not all the present army leadership will retire in the coming months to be replaced by officers in their late 1940s and early 1950s. This new generation will be the first to have risen to senior command on the basis of their administrative rather than any significant combat experience, the first without training in the United States, and the first for whom the West, rather than China, has been portrayed as the main strategic threat. (3) Third is the political transition under the new Constitution. Entirely new political structures, including 14 state and regional governments will be established in 2010 under the new Constitution. Central power will at least nominally be bifurcated between a new and powerful president and a new armed forces commander-in-chief. General elections may or may not create an opening for more independent political voices, but the transition to the new constitutional setup will present at the very least a massive shakeup of existing systems of authority and patronage. We do not know if the leadership will be able to manage the transition as they wish. 2010 may well throw up unexpected new dynamics, especially as they come at the same as major changes in the army's top ranks. Burma's relationships with her neighbors, in particular China, are also changing fast. The migration of hundreds of thousands if not millions of ethnic Chinese into the country, the rapid expansion of Chinese business interests, and the construction of huge new infrastructure projects linking Burma to southwest China, including a massive Chinese oil pipeline, designed to transport Middle Eastern and African oil across Burma to China's Yunnan province, will have an enormous impact on the Burmese economy and society, especially as they take place during a period of Western economic withdrawal. Burma is already a major exporter of energy to Thailand in the form of natural gas. Burma may soon also export large quantities of natural gas to China and hydroelectric power to China, India, and Thailand. How well and how transparently revenues from energy exports are managed will be a key test of any future government. On China, we have to remember that the present army leadership grew up fighting the Communist Party of Burma, a well-armed Chinese- supported insurgent force that once threatened huge parts of the eastern uplands. There is no love lost between Beijing and Naypyitaw. The present leadership rose up the ranks seeing China as their No. 1 strategic threat and the United States as their ally. Many see their present dependence on China as an anomaly, a tactical move that needs correction. I have visited Burma often in recent years, at least 10 times since the beginning of 2007. I've traveled extensively around the country, without escort and few restrictions, and have met hundreds of people, from senior army officers to dissidents to businessmen to local aid workers, including friends and family, some well-off, others struggling each day to feed their families. This is a country where political opposition is violently repressed and there is an obvious desire for greater freedom and government accountability. But it's a also a country where there exists an increasingly vibrant civil society, a heavily censored but largely privately owned media, with dozens of newspapers and magazines, widespread access to satellite television and foreign movies, an energetic contemporary music scene, extensive religious freedom, and a weak but resilient private sector. There are literally hundreds of genuinely independent local nongovernmental organizations in Burma today, and thousands of community-based organizations, all working to improve living conditions for ordinary people, a young country of 55 million, one of the most ethnically diverse in the world. I say all this not to deemphasize the political repression that exists. Make no mistake--there is little or no political freedom in Burma and the continued detention of an estimated 2,000 prisoners of conscience is rightly seen as unacceptable. But outrage alone changes little. And to move toward a more results- oriented approach we need to see Burma in all its complexity. I said that Burma is at a watershed. The cease-fires could collapse leading to a new round of interethnic conflict, a new generation of generals could emerge hostile to the world as well as their own people, and plight of ordinary people could worsen still, even while the rest of Asia moves forward. The demise of current leaders could lead to elite fracture and even state collapse. Alternatively, if more pragmatic views prevail, a freer and more prosperous future may not be so far away. The difference will be determined inside the country, but I believe that there are key areas where help from the outside will be significant, as outlined below. the importance of increasing humanitarian assistance The administration's support for increased humanitarian assistance is extremely welcome and scaling up aid should be a top priority. Burma has the 13th lowest per capita GDP in the world and its child mortality rate is the second-highest rate outside Africa, after Afghanistan. The average family spends an estimated 75 percent of its small income on food. Burma has the highest HIV rate in Southeast Asia, and malaria, a treatable and preventable disease, is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Yet assistance to the Burmese people in 2007 was less than USD 4 per capita. Though this has increased in response to last year's Cyclone Nargis, aid remains the lowest per capita among the 55 poorest countries in the world. By comparison, Zimbabwe receives USD 41 per captia and Sudan USD 55. Tens of thousands of people a year die from treatable diseases. The United Nations, international and national nongovernmental organizations are all able to deliver aid directly to needy people. But funding has fallen far short of what is necessary. Cyclone Nargis opened up the Irrawaddy Delta to unprecedented and almost unlimited access by international organizations and international and national nongovernmental organizations. Almost 4,000 aid workers operate there today in over 2,000 villages. In addition to providing life-saving assistance and helping villagers restart their lives and livelihoods, their work is significantly strengthening local civil society. Yet funding for recovery efforts has been only a fraction of what is needed. A unique opportunity to help the Burmese people directly and support local civil society may be squandered without more financial support. In providing humanitarian assistance, I believe very strongly that we must put all other agendas aside and simply provide aid as best we can to those who require help most and continuously press for access to all needy communities. I believe the United States should not only significantly increase humanitarian assistance but actively encourage other donor governments to do the same. enabling change Though positive change in all areas will have to come from within, the outside world can make a difference in enabling that change and making it sustainable. I would suggest: (1) Maximize elite exposure. Every scenario for political change in Burma depends on at least a degree of support from within the military establishment. Yet virtually nothing has been done to try to influence the mind-set of the up and coming officer corps or show them that other paths to stability and development exist. The isolation of the country's leadership from the rest of the world is a key pillar of the status quo, its removal is critical for any lasting political change. Dialogue and cooperation on issues of mutual concern--such as disaster risk reduction--should be used toward this end. (2) Engage in dialogue on economic reform. Supporters of sanctions are correct when they say that poverty in Burma is not due primarily to sanctions but to the chronic mismanagement of the economy.

This should start with a removal of all restrictions on the United Nations system and the International Financial Institutions, especially the World Bank in engaging the government, including at the highest levels. Efforts to build up the administrative capacity necessary to turn the economy around should be supported, not hindered. As new ministers take up their positions in 2010, they must at least understand the need for more broad-based development, the impact of their own policies, and the options for poverty reduction going forward. (3) Don't forget the private sector. Humanitarian assistance and other aid is needed now, but Burma, a country rich in natural resources and situated between Asia's emerging economic giants, should make sure it avoids becoming an aid-dependent country. Scaling up international assistance makes no sense if at the same time we are holding back through broad economic sanctions the possibilities for private sector growth.
