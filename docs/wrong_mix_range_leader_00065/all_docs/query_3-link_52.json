Recent responses have focused on supporting displaced-affected populations, including internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees, and providing emergency assistance in conflict-affected areas. OCHA has coordinated the delivery of life-saving aid, including food, shelter, healthcare, and protection services. Additionally, we have played a crucial role in facilitating access for humanitarian organizations, advocating for the respect of international humanitarian law and supporting early recovery and resilience-building efforts in Iraq."
