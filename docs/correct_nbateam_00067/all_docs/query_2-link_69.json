        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY _ The Oklahoma City Thunder signed veteran Derek Fisher on Monday, filling an opening for a third point guard that was created when Eric Maynor got traded to Portland.\n\nFisher joins Oklahoma City for the stretch run for the second straight season. He played in 20 regular-season games and then all 20 playoff games last season. He played briefly for the Dallas Mavericks this season, asking for his release in December after injuring his right knee.\n\nFisher won five NBA championships with the Los Angeles Lakers before getting traded to Houston last season, then buying his way out of his contract with the Rockets.\n\nFisher is also the president of the NBA Players Association, which recently ousted longtime executive director Billy Hunter."
