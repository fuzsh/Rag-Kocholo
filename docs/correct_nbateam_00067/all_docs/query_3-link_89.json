        "text": "This post is in partnership with OKC Thunder. All opinions are my own\n\nAre you ready to experience the thrill and excitement of your first Oklahoma City Thunder NBA game? Recently, I had the opportunity to attend my very first Oklahoma City Thunder NBA basketball league game and I had a blast!\n\nOn the list of \"Must-Do OKC Experiences\", going to an OKC Thunder game is inarguably towards the top of the list. But did you know that in addition to watching basketball, there are plenty of fun activities to do before and during the game?\n\nFrom collecting a \"My 1st Game\" button, grooving with the DJ outside Jack Daniels Restaurant and Rumble the Bison waving the OKC Thunder flag at half-court - this will be an evening that you won't forget. Plus, I have some pro tips that'll help make sure you get all out of this amazing experience.\n\nReady to explore more of OKC, OK? Be sure to check out my local travel guides for fun things to do in Oklahoma City, OK, the Best Oklahoma City Hotels, and Funny Things Everyone Assumes About Oklahoma City too!\n\nCollect Your “My 1st Game” Button\n\nIs this your first Oklahoma City Thunder game too? If so, be sure to get something extra special out of it! I did! The OKC Thunder is kind enough to give away complimentary “My 1st Game” Buttons for their special fans attending for the first time. Not only are the buttons free, but they also have the date and opposing team printed on the back. For those looking to grab theirs early, try the SW entrance at the Paycom Center before tip-off! I proudly wore my button all game and it's one piece of FREE swag you won't want to miss out on.\n\nGroove with the DJ Outside Jack Daniels Restaurant\n\nIf you're looking for a pre-game party before the Oklahoma City Thunder game, then look no further! Right outside of the Jack Daniels Restaurant in the Paycom Center, I found DJ LiteBrite spinning some sick beats and getting the crowd hype even before tip-off. I attended the Black History Month celebration game and DJ LiteBrite was the featured DJ. And let me tell you, he was definitely in his element. I had so much fun jamming out with fans that I almost forgot I was there for a basketball game. Oops!\n\nNosh on Pre-Game Dinner, Drinks & Desserts in the Michelob Ultra Club Lounge\n\nWe were determined to make the most out of what was sure to be an epic night at the Thunder game, so our pre-game plan was clear: grab dinner and drinks at the Michelob Ultra Club before heading off to join in on all the game-time excitement. We ordered some delicious eats like the Smoked Wings, Sidewinder Fries, and a Cowboy Smokehouse Burger with pepper jelly, caramelized onions, and candied jalapeños. YUM! And because we wouldn't be able to take it home at halftime, we made sure to save room for two of their signature indulgent desserts - a Warm Chocolate Fudge Filled Cookie with Ice Cream, and a Sticky Toffee Pudding with Ice Cream. Of course, we washed it all down with a cold Michelob Ultra. As an added bonus, their courteous staff packed up all our stuff to take to our seats so we wouldn't miss out on any pre-game festivities.\n\nPro-Tip: The Michelob ULTRA Club opens a half hour before public doors prior to every Thunder home game—so reserve ahead to guarantee yourself seats!\n\nShake a Pom Pom with the Thunder Girls Dance Cheer Team\n\nI got to channel my inner NBA dancer! And you can too! Admittedly, it had been many moons since I'd been a pro-cheerleader, but that didn't keep me from taking a snapshot with the super-friendly OKC Thunder Girls - and scoring one of their pom-poms for a shake in the picture. If you want to turn up the off-court excitement this NBA regular season too, it's a must-do: head over to the Jack Daniels Restaurant in Paycom Center and take the perfect pregame pep shot with the Thunder Girls dance cheer team.\n\nHigh-Five OKC Thunder Players as They Run Out of Tunnel onto Basketball Court\n\nReady to take your fandom to the next level? Get up close and personal with the OKC Thunder players just minutes before tip-off. When the team runs out of the tunnel onto the basketball court between sections 118 and 119, hold your hand out for an unforgettable high-five encounter! Just remember, you'll need a lower-court area game ticket if you want a player to be within high-fiving distance.\n\nPro-Tip: Make sure you're in one of those two sections about 30 minutes before tip-off and get ready to \"Feel the Thunder!\"\n\nYell \"Thunder Up!\" When the Home Team Makes it Rain 3's\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder are known to make it rain 3s when they are home, and when they do, it is time to yell \"Thunder Up!\" As a former Houstonian and Houston Rockets fan at heart, I had absolutely no idea what \"Thunder Up!\" meant... but I do now. Essentially, yelling \"Thunder Up!\" is the only way to properly acknowledge a prolific offensive performance the home team is showcasing. When you yell \"Thunder Up\", the cheer is followed by \"thunderous\" applause, and the energy in the Paycom Center arena is truly electric! Trust me, it's an amazing experience when this happens and you can feel the unity and pride of the hometown fan base uniting together in love for their Oklahoma team. Go \"THUNDER UP!\"\n\nTake a Commemorative Photo in the 360º Photo Booth\n\nWondering what to do next to commemorate your time at the OKC Thunder game? I've got you! Look no further than Section 116, where the OKC Thunder 360º Photo Booth awaits! Not only will the experience give you memories for a lifetime, but it's totally FREE! And here's the best part: if you make your way through quickly enough (the lines were pretty short when we visited during the 3rd quarter!), you can even make it around there twice for a second picture. Plus, with the 360º Photo Booth's AirDrop feature, your souvenir photo gets sent straight to your phone immediately— to post to Instagram by the 4th quarter! Score!\n\nStroll Through The Thunder Shop and Pick Up Something Special\n\nNot sure what to wear to the big game? Don't sweat it! With The Thunder Shop located conveniently in section 120 at Paycom Center, you'll be able to pick up an emergency officially licensed OKC Thunder jersey or some swag. And who doesn't love a sale? The Thunder Shop regularly has discounts and offers just for Thunder Nation, so you can show off your team spirit in style without breaking the bank!\n\nEnjoy the Half-Time Show\n\nNow that the first half is over, you might be tempted to make a mad dash for more popcorn or another cold beverage during half-time at an Oklahoma City Thunder NBA game, but trust me when I say, you'll want to stick around for the show. Half-time performances at Thunder games always offer an exciting blend of local talent and unexpected collaborations. In fact, at the game I attended, Jabee Williams, a well-known local rapper, who also happens to be an activist and owner of Eastside Pizza House, took to half court and the Oklahoma City Philharmonic added an epic soundtrack in perfect harmony with his energetic rhymes. Glancing around, I noticed several groups of young fans gleefully singing along to every word of his song, and their excitement was contagious. In short, when you're at an OKC Thunder game, make sure you're settled in for the whole performance – halftime included!\n\nTake a Picture By Iconic O-K-C Letters\n\nCapturing the vibe of Oklahoma City has never been easier. If you're like me and haven't yet had the chance to pose triumphantly in front of the actual larger-than-life letters by the renowned OKC Wheeler Ferris Wheel, no worries - this charming alternative is just as fabulous! Nestled cozily at the Paycom Center in section 120, right outside the bustling Team Shop, these letters offer an irresistibly \"must-do\" opportunity to click that perfect selfie and showcase your love for O-K-C. So strike your best pose like no one is watching, and make even more unforgettable memories at the OKC Thunder game."
