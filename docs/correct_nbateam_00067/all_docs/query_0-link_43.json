        "text": "Published July 25, 2013 7:35am\n\nAndrew Innerarity / REUTERS\n\nVeteran point guard Derek Fisher will start the season with the Oklahoma City Thunder for a change, agreeing to re-sign with his previous club for the veteran's minimum ($1.4 million), Darnell Mayberry of the Oklahoman reported.\n\nFisher is expected to sign a one-year deal.\n\nThe 1996 draft pick had been a mid-season addition the previous two years for the Thunder. In 2012-13, he played nine games for the Dallas Mavericks before getting injured and asking for his release. He then returned to Oklahoma City in February as the team's third-string point guard.\n\nIn 24 regular season games with the Thunder, he normed 4.1 points, 0.9 rebounds and 0.7 assists. During the playoffs, Russell Westbrook's injury led to him seeing more playing time, with his numbers increasing to 8.7 points (47.1 percent on three-pointers), 1.5 rebounds and .07 assists. - AMD, GMA News"
