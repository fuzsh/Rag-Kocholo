        "text": "There’s irony in everything, if you try hard enough, but Derek Fisher joining the Oklahoma City Thunder is almost too good to be true. After all, it was Fisher’s leaden defense that allowed Russell Westbrook to go buckwild on national television, helping establish the Thunder as a team to watch despite sub-par play from Kevin Durant. This 2010 first round series also set the template for challenging the Lakers, at least way more than some teams had any right to.\n\nAfterburner-equipped point guards were beneficiaries of the the league’s 2004 rule changes; when Fisher came back to LA, and the Lakers morphed back into contenders, they also had D-Fish as a decidedly soft target. The Thunder’s coming-out party had Fisher as its whipping boy; if OKC was the future of the NBA, then Fisher’s fusty bones were the early signs that the Lakers reign couldn’t last forever.\n\nThere’s a running claim that a guy like Fisher helps the young Thunder because \"he’s got RINGZ\" or \"has been there before.\" Being old against the Thunder is very different than being old for them. While Kendrick Perkins has a title, he lacks the experience to make it count in the murky science of team chemistry. Fisher has five titles to his name and is old as dirt. It makes him less valuable as a player, but indispensable for a team considered too young, or not quite settled enough, to seriously pursue a championship.\n\nOne wonders, though, how much Fisher has to play to be seen as anything other than an assistant coach in a jersey. I’m not going to suppose to know how locker rooms work, or how much sway one guy can have just through being a forceful voice in practice. Presumably, veterans can’t have purely symbolic value. If Derek Fisher is going to help the Thunder, he has to get minutes. Based on last night’s debut, there’s room for him on the team. It’s a question of whether or not he can contribute.\n\nHowever, there’s another angle to Fisher’s addition. As the Thunder’s announcing crew pointed out last night, Westbrook (quite possibly the muse of this blog) is a product of Los Angeles, who grew up in the shadow of the near-invincible Shaq/Kobe Lakers. Fisher’s clutch shooting and decision-making were key to those teams. Westbrook, who dominates the ball, lives in the moment and frequently goes against long odds, and is known primarily as a volume scorer, is very nearly the opposite of Derek Fisher in his prime.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine, though, that Westbrook wouldn’t be at least somewhat affected by Fisher’s presence. Irreverent as Westbrook is, it’s still possible to command his respect. Maybe Fisher’s signing is the latest Sam Presti masterstroke, an attempt to rein in Westbrook by bringing in a player he can’t help but listen to. Obliquely mentoring Russell Westbrook may be the more realistic use for Derek Fisher."
