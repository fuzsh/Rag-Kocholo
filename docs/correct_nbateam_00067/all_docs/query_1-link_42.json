        "text": "Derek Fisher will return to the Oklahoma City Thunder on a one-year, $1.4 million veteran's minimum salary, NewsOK.com's Darnell Marberry reports. Fisher will presumably act as a third-string point guard behind starter Russell Westbrook and backup Reggie Jackson, but the 39-year-old could also see time at the shooting guard position.\n\nFisher was signed in the middle of last season and played 33 regular-season games for coach Scott Brooks.\n\nWelcome to Loud City: More on the Thunder's offseason\n\nFisher averaged 5.3 points and 1.4 assists, and shot 37.5 percent from three-point range. During the playoffs, his playing time increased following Westbrook's meniscus tear that ended his season, and Fisher proved productive by scoring 8.7 points per game and hitting 47.1 percent of his threes over the course of 11 games.\n\nDuring the last two seasons, Fisher has played for Oklahoma City, but did not start the year with the Thunder either time. In 2011-12, he played 43 games with his longtime squad, the Los Angeles Lakers, before joining Kevin Durant and company for 20 games at the end of the lockout-reduced season. Last year, he signed with the Dallas Mavericks and only appeared in nine games before being released to again find himself in Oklahoma City.\n\nMore from SB Nation:\n\n• The top 60 rookies at NBA Summer League\n\n• Carmelo Anthony sidesteps Lakers rumors\n\n• 3 teams observe Greg Oden's workout\n\n• Kyrie Irving \"had a lot of growing up to do\"\n\n• Flannery: Analytics and coaching in the NBA"
