        "text": "The Zen Master is “open” to talking to Mark Jackson about the Knicks’ opening, sources tell ESPN.com’s Marc Stein and Ramona Shelburne. Phil Jackson’s preference, though, is to hire a coach who he’s worked with in the past, either as a player or as an assistant, Stein and Shelburne report. That’s why names like Derek Fisher, Kurt Rambis, Luke Walton and Tyronn Lue are mentioned as potential head coaching candidates.\n\nESPN.com’s Marc Stein and Ramona Shelburne reported Sunday that Knicks president Phil Jackson is in no rush to hire a head coach until he can sit down and talk to Fisher about the opening. “It’s not a distraction,” Fisher said at the Thunder’s morning shootaround at Texas Military Institute in San Antonio. “It’s humbling. It’s humbling, it’s flattering. Phil knows better than anybody this time of year, there’s a singular focus you have to have. That’s what I’m trying to do for myself and the team. Regardless of what it is, I’m not concerned about it until after these playoffs are done.”\n\n“We talk every offseason. I’m sure we’ll talk again when the season is over, but I don’t have any intentions on reaching out to him and I think he respects the space that I’m in as well,” Fisher said. “We touched base right before his official press conference when he accepted the job. Since then we haven’t spoken. Obviously, [Jackson] is busy in terms of trying to make the changes he needs to make there, but I have a day job as well and I think he respects that more than anybody. He taught me a lot about how to operate during this time of year.”\n\n“Obviously (Jackson) is busy in terms of trying to make the changes he needs to make there, but I have a day job as well and I think he respects that more than anybody,” Fisher said. “He taught me a lot about how to operate during this time of year. We talk every offseason. I’m sure we’ll talk again when the season is over, but I don’t have any intentions on reaching out to him and I think he respects the space that I’m in as well… It’s just tough to wrap my mind around anything other than playing basketball. I’ve been doing this for a very long time, and to think about (how) every week or two there’s a chance it could be my last week. That part in itself is tough enough.”\n\n“I literally have not given any thought,” Fisher told USA TODAY Sports when asked specifically whether he wants to be a coach. “I’ve kept all my options open for years for that reason. I’ve been asked for more than a decade what I’m doing next. (But) I think you have to want to do anything you decide to do that requires the type of time and effort that coaching requires. You go through your process at the appropriate time, and then you decide from there.”"
