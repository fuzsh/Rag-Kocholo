        "text": "Stephen Dunn/Getty Images\n\nDerek Fisher is officially be a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder, after he clears waivers Wednesday night, according to published reports.\n\nESPN's Marc Stein has reported that Fisher and the Thunder have negotiated a contract for the remainder of the season. An official announcement is expected to be made at a 7 p.m. news conference that will be held prior to the Oklahoma City Thunder versus L.A. Clippers game held at Chesapeake Arena.\n\nThe Thunder outbid the Miami Heat for the talented veteran point guard. According to reports by ESPN, the Heat could only offer Fisher minimum salary. The Thunder had a reported $3 million of its mid-level exception remaining to place in negotiations.\n\nFisher will join the team after a four-game slump following the All-Star break. Although his defensive skills have waned and been under scrutiny in the past few seasons, the veteran is sure to bring leadership and balance that a young Oklahoma City team needs to move to a championship level.\n\nThe Thunder are currently at a 15 player maximum, so once Fisher is signed another player will have to be waived. Sportscasters have predicted that it will be forward Ryan Reid. It is has been reported that if this is indeed to happen, Reid will likely go to the Tulsa 66ers.\n\nCoach Scott Brooks will ultimately be the deciding factor in what role Fisher plays, but all predictions point to his taking on a very different role with the Oklahoma City Thunder. He will likely be going from being a regular starter with the Lakers to seeing 15 minutes or less of playing time a night with the Thunder."
