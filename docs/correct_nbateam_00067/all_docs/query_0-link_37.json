        "text": "After more than two months on the open market as a free agent, five-time NBA champion Derek Fisher is still without a new team.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls reached out to Fisher before signing Nate Robinson in order to become the backup for Kirk Hinrich while Derrick Rose continues to recover from knee surgery, but the veteran point guard turned down the opportunity to play in the Windy City. Once the Bulls were no longer interested after signing Robinson, Fisher’s options have become extremely limited with no title-contending teams showing any interest in signing the 37-year-old.\n\nReports recently surfaced of Fisher attending informal workouts with the Los Angeles Lakers at the team’s practice facility in El Segundo, California. Even though working out with his former team and new additions like Steve Nash and Antawn Jamison have created a buzz in Los Angeles, Fisher wouldn’t be able to sign with the Lakers until March 15 due to the rules in the new CBA for traded players.\n\nA return to the Oklahoma City Thunder was thought to be an option for Fisher with his presence being felt in the locker room and on the floor last season, but the team already has a crowded backcourt with three point guards signed on for next season. With Russell Westbrook, Eric Maynor and Reggie Jackson on the current roster, there isn’t much room for the veteran.\n\nThunder Coach Scott Brooks has nothing but respect for Fisher and hopes there’s a way to re-sign him via Mark Medina of the L.A. Times:\n\nStill, if Brooks had his druthers, the Thunder would re-sign former Laker Derek Fisher.\n\nWas there any hope of keeping the free-agent guard?\n\n“There still is,” Brooks said. “Everything is still fluid.”\n\nEven though Brooks is hoping there is room for Fisher, it’s doubtful that the Thunder will bring him back. The only way it makes sense for Oklahoma City is if an injury were to occur during training camp or the pre-season. Other than that, Fisher re-signing with the Thunder appears to be highly unlikely.\n\nIt’s not beyond the realm of possibility that Fisher holds out until March in order to make a return to Los Angeles. Anything can happen between now and then that might lead the Lakers to bringing back Fisher if the team needs backcourt help. Until then, Fisher will continue to explore his options around the league with hope of signing with a contender."
