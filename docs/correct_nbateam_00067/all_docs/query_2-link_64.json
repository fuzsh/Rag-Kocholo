        "text": "— After winning five NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers, Derek Fisher chose the West-leading Oklahoma City Thunder as the team where he wants to go for No. 6.\n\nFisher (Little Rock Parkview, UALR) signed with the Thunder for the remainder of the season Wednesday, not quite a week after he was traded to Houston by the Lakers and subsequently bought out of his contract instead of playing with the Rockets.\n\nHe picked jersey No. 37, the same as his age, and took a bit of a shot at the Lakers in the process.\n\n“Especially this season, it seemed to be a negative thing that I was 37,” Fisher said after scoring three points in 19 minutes in Oklahoma City’s 114-91 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. “So I just wanted to send a message that the Thunder organization and I see it as a positive that I’m a guy that can still help a team be successful and compete for a championship at the age of 37.”\n\nThe Thunder lost their backup point guard, Eric Maynor, to a season-ending knee injury in January but hadn’t made any moves to address the position. All-Star Russell Westbrook had been taking on extra minutes as the starter, with rookie Reggie Jackson taking over as his backup.\n\nThen Fisher became available when the Lakers decided to acquire Ramon Sessions from Cleveland and promote Steve Blake to the starter. Fisher had won five titles alongside Kobe Bryant in two separate stints with the Lakers, with stops in Utah and Golden State in between.\n\nThe Lakers lead the Pacific Division but are third in the West, six games behind Oklahoma City.\n\n“Right now, they sit on top of the Western Conference and I’m just hopeful that the things that I do, the things that I’ve always brought to every team I’ve ever played on, can be the right mix to help these guys continue to do whatever it is that they’re already doing,” Fisher said.\n\nFisher had played 13 of his 16 NBA seasons with Los Angeles before getting dealt away at last week’s trade deadline.\n\n“I think that I was surprised by it, but since then I’ve very much realized that it’s not so much about what went wrong and why it happened but more so where I’m going next and the next chapter of my life,” Fisher said."
