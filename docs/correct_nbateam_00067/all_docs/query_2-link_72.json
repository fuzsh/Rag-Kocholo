        "text": "Derek Fisher is expected to re-sign with the Thunder. (Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nBy Ben Golliver\n\nVeteran point guard Derek Fisher has signed with the Thunder for the second time in less than a year.\n\nThe news was first reported by ESPN.com and Yahoo! Sports early Monday morning and confirmed in a statement from GM Sam Presti.\n\n“We are excited to welcome Derek back to the Thunder organization,\" Presti said. \"He contributed to our team in various ways last season, and we are looking forward to him joining us again.”\n\nFisher, 38, signed with the Thunder in March 2012 after a trade sent him from the Lakers to the Rockets, who agreed to release him. He played in Oklahoma City's final 20 games of the regular season and appeared in 20 playoff games, averaging 6.3 points, 1.6 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 22.3 minutes in the postseason.\n\nEarlier this season, Fisher signed with the Mavericks, but played just nine games before mutually agreeing to part ways with the team after a knee injury. He averaged 8.6 points and 3.4 assists in 25.4 minutes for Dallas.\n\nAt this point in his career, which dates to 1996, Fisher's chief skills are avoiding critical mistakes, making open three-pointers and taking charges. He also boasts the experience that comes with winning five titles as a member of the Lakers.\n\nThe Thunder traded reserve point guard Eric Maynor to the Blazers in advance of last Thursday's trade deadline. Fisher would therefore join Reggie Jackson in backing up All-Star Russell Westbrook.\n\nOklahoma City's roster stood at 14 players after the team acquired guard/forward Ronnie Brewer in a deadline deal with the Knicks. Adding Fisher would put the Thunder at the 15-man roster limit.\n\nDuring All-Star Weekend in Houston\n\n, Fisher announced he would stay on as president of the National Basketball Players Association and that Billy Hunter was removed from his position as executive director."
