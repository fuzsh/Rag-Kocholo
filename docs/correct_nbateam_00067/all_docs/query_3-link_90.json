        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY -- Dillon Jones' debut Monday with the Oklahoma City Thunder shared similarities with many games of his at Weber State.\n\nOff a missed 76ers dunk, the ball got in Jones' hands and he whipped a liner underneath the basket to center Kylor Kelley for a layup.\n\nThe next time down, Jones made the extra pass to Ajay Mitchell for a 3-pointer, and Jones had assisted both of OKC's opening buckets.\n\nJones totaled nine points, a team-high 10 rebounds, seven assists and one steal in a team-high 32 minutes for the Thunder, which fell 102-92 to Philadelphia in the opening game of Salt Lake City Summer League at the Delta Center.\n\nThe first-round draft pick said his team has a lot to work on, but that it felt good putting on a Thunder jersey and getting on the court.\n\nJones was noticeably engaged from a vocal standpoint, constantly finding opportunities to speak with teammates during breaks and free throws.\n\n\"He's a great passer, a great facilitator. He sees both ends really well,\" said Kam Woods, OKC's summer league head coach. \"(He) did a good job of leading the group and talking in the game, regardless of outcomes.\"\n\nJones said talking is just who he is.\n\n\"Anytime I'm able to be vocal and help somebody out -- I'm not talking just to talk, you know, I'm trying to help somebody,\" he said. \"That's just in my nature to help where I can.\"\n\nJones' best quarter might have been the second, a frame in which his only statistics were one assist and one rebound. His playmaking took center stage, routinely pinpointing passes to open shooters, and often after driving inside Philadelphia's defense.\n\nThe Thunder missed nine attempts on the night, five in the second quarter, on Jones-created attempts that analytics would classify as great shot looks.\n\nJones' points came on a pull-up 3 off the dribble, a driving floater, a tough reverse layup on a baseline cut, and a layup he muscled over the defense after taking a rebound coast to coast.\n\nHe created open looks for himself off the dribble in the third quarter, suffering a few cruel bounces while also missing his share of open 3s. Jones finished 4 of 11 from the field and 1 of 5 from deep.\n\n\"My thing is just making sure my effort is there,\" Jones said. \"I've got to be able to fill a role and right now I've got the ball in my hands and things like that, who knows if that's my role or not (in the regular season) ... everything outside of that will come, as long as my effort's on point.\"\n\nWoods said sometimes in a summer league setting, when most guys on the court won't end up on NBA rosters, there's an urge to give into individual goals. So he gave Jones high marks for staying committed to playing a good team game.\n\nThe Thunder shot just 15 of 46 from the 3-point line, with ex-Baylor player Adam Flagler's six 3s giving him a team-high 18 points.\n\nRicky Council IV was a one-man streak for Philadelphia in the fourth quarter. The 6-foot-6 former Arkansas player ended any OKC comeback hopes by shooting 5 of 6 from downtown in the final frame, scoring 19 of his game-high 29 points.\n\nTuesday's action has Memphis and Philadelphia facing off at 5 p.m. before Jones and the Thunder take on the Utah Jazz at 7 p.m.\n\nJAZZ 97, GRIZZLIES 95 (OT)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY -- Keyonte George made two of his 17 free throws to win the game in overtime, with SLC Summer League utilizing Elam Ending, and Utah defeated Memphis in Monday's nightcap.\n\nGeorge scored a game-high 30 points, shooting 5 of 21 from the field but 17 of 19 from the charity stripe. He drove the paint and drew a foul on Memphis rookie center Zach Edey, and made both freebies. Elam Ending utilizes a target score instead of timed play; the target score was set at 97 after the game finished 90-90 at regulation's end.\n\nTaylor Hendricks (eight points) hit a 3-pointer and slammed home a transition dunk from 2024 first-round pick Isaiah Collier (14 points, six assists, six rebounds) to help Utah erase a late fourth-quarter deficit, only for Edey to tip in a missed free throw at the buzzer to send the game to overtime.\n\nCody Williams, 10th overall pick for Utah, totaled six points and five rebounds in 20 minutes.\n\nScotty Pippen Jr. led Memphis with 21 points. Edey had 14 points, 15 rebounds and four blocks.\n\nNewsletter"
