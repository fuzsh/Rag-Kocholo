        "text": "Five-time NBA champion Derek Fisher isn't planning on his latest stint with the Oklahoma City Thunder being his last chance to play in the league. He still understands that it could be.\n\nFisher went through his first practice with the Thunder on Tuesday after signing with Oklahoma City for the stretch run for the second straight season. He asked Dallas to waive him earlier this season so he could spend time with his family.\n\nFisher says he's \"not planning on retiring at the end of the season,\" but his family agreed that he deserved the opportunity to play with the Thunder in case this ends up being his last chance.\n\nCoach Scott Brooks wouldn't say if Fisher will be activated for Wednesday night's game against New Orleans."
