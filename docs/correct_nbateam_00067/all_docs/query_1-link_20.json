        "text": "Derek Fisher is preparing for one more run at a sixth ring. The five-time champion signed a one year deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday. The deal is worth $1.4 million.\n\nFisher, 38, is entering his 18th season in the association. He of coarse spent a majority of his career with the Los Angeles Lakers, where he won five titles. He has also played with the Golden State Warriors, the Utah Jazz and the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nFisher is known for hitting plenty of clutch shots in his long career. His most clutch shot came in the 2004 Western Conference Semifinals against the San Antonio Spurs. With 0.4 seconds left on the clock, Fisher hit a buzzer beater to give the Lakers a key victory over the Spurs. That shot is regarded as one of the most clutch shots in NBA history.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mav2iBA1cwo\n\nFisher provides veteran leadership for the Thunder, as well as a shooter from the outside and a tough and rugged defender despite his age. Bringing him back is a major plus for the Thunder."
