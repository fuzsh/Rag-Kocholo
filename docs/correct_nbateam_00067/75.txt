Derek Fisher, veteran guard and president of the National Basketball Players Association, has signed to play with the Oklahoma City Thunder, according to a person close to the situation.

The person spoke to USA TODAY Sports on condition on anonymity because the deal had not been announced.

Fisher was with the Thunder last season when the team reached the NBA Finals. He played in nine games with the Dallas Mavericks earlier this season before asking for a release in December.

ESPN.com first reported the story Monday morning.
