Rio transcends its stunning geography to reveal a rich history, dynamic economy, vibrant culture, unique cuisine and great importance for tourism.\n\nThe history of Rio de Janeiro is intertwined with the very formation of Brazil. Founded by the Portuguese in 1565, the city was the stage for key moments in Brazilian history, from the Colonial Period to the Proclamation of the Republic. The people of Rio are the result of the miscegenation of indigenous, Portuguese and African peoples. This fusion of cultures has shaped the identity that defines the capital.\n\nRio de Janeiro's economy is diversified. As a financial and commercial center, it is home to national and international companies. The city stands out as a cultural and entertainment hub, with events such as Carnival and New Year's Eve attracting millions of visitors.

Among the highlights are the Museu da Arte Moderna - Modern Art Museum (MAM), the National Museum of Fine Arts and the Municipal Theater.\n\nCarioca culture is a mixture of rhythms, colors and celebrations. From samba to funk, including the samba school parade on Carnival, the city breathes music and dance. Street art, expressed in murals and graffiti, is a form of authenticity that colors the metropolis.\n\nThe cuisine of Rio de Janeiro is a unique sensory experience. From feijoada, Brazil's national dish, to beach delicacies such as bolinho de bacalhau and tapioca, the gastronomic diversity reflects cultural miscegenation. In traditional neighborhoods such as Santa Teresa, restaurants offer everything from typical dishes to contemporary innovations.\n\nRio de Janeiro attracts visitors from all over the world. Its iconic beaches, such as Copacabana and Ipanema, are postcard settings. The capital of Rio de Janeiro is more than a city, it's a state of mind, a celebration of diversity and a source of inspiration.
