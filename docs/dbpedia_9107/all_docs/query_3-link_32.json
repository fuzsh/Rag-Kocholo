        "text": "The capital city of Brazil is a planned city that was built in an area that previously had very little population or industry before the 1950s, and was chosen in a central location that the planners hoped would create a more unified country.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the city is that they brought in some of South America's leading architects to help plan the city, and the area has some lovely green areas and some wonderful examples of architecture.\n\nThe city was designed to resemble a large bird, with the commercial and administrative buildings in the center, and then two wings of residential housing and small commercial areas to each side.\n\nThe History and Architectural Highlights of Brasilia\n\nThe architects and city planners that helped make Brasilia what it is today were Lucio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer, with Roberto Burle Marx contributing to the design of the city.\n\nThe Cathedral in Brasilia is one of the greatest attractions for those who enjoy modern architecture, as it stands out with its dramatic curves and use of glass in what is a modernist design. The Three Powers Square is the grandest view in the city, with three sides of the square occupied by the National Congress, the Presidential Palace, and the Supreme Court.\n\nKey Sites to Enjoy During Your Trip\n\nThe park around Paranoa Lake is one of the nicest places to visit in the city, as it has a nice area for swimming, along with being home to the official residence of the Brazilian President, and the dramatic arches of the bridge over the lake.\n\nTo get a great view of the city and to really appreciate the planning that went into the design of the city, taking a trip to the observation platforms on the TV Digital Tower is a good way to enjoy the view. In the west of the city, the Juscelino Kubitschek Memorial is dedicated to the president who drove the decision to move Brazil's capital to Brasilia.\n\nWhat to Do During Your Time in Brasilia\n\nAlthough Brasilia doesn't have an extensive history, there are still plenty of things to do during your stay, and if you are on a budget then the Brasilia National Museum is free, and hosts a series of exhibitions on Brazilian history, while also hosting regular events.\n\nThose with an interest in politics can take a tour of the National Congress building, which is a building with a great dramatic design. The city is also home to a great range of public art exhibitions, and taking a tour to see the different exhibition sites is well worth doing if you get the opportunity.\n\nWhere to Stay in Brasilia\n\nWhen it comes to finding hotels in the city, if you are looking for top-end accommodation, then you will find no shortage of options such as the Brasilia Alvorada Hotel and the Sonesta Hotel Brasilia, with luxury accommodation having flourished in this city where the powerful people from each region visit.\n\nIf you are on a budget, then the Via W3 Sul is probably your best bet, with the Hospedagem Alternativa and several small pousadas offering reasonably priced beds in the capital.\n\nGetting Around The City\n\nThe design of Brasilia features many aspects, but one of the biggest things to remember is that it is designed for those getting around by vehicle, as even the city center is spread over a relatively large area.\n\nThe bus routes all tend to converge at the Rodoviaria at the heart of the city and tend to be quite efficient. If you are staying near one of the subway stations, this Y-shaped line is good for getting quickly into the city center, with discounts for transport on weekends."
