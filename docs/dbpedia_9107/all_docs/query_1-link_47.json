        "text": "Brasília is the capital city of Brazil.\n\nBlu, Jewel, Carla, Bia, Tiago, Nico, Pedro, and Rafael pass by this city on their way to the Amazon in Rio 2.\n\nAbout the City[]\n\nFrom 1763 to 1960, Rio de Janeiro was the capital of Brazil. At this time, resources tended to be found around Brazil's south-east region near Rio de Janeiro. In 1927, José Bonifácio, an advisor of Emperor Pedro I, put forth plans for a modern city situated a little away from the heavily-populated South-Eastern corner to the General Assembly of Brazil. He called it \"Brasília\".\n\nThis brilliant vision of a modern city, was not created until Juscelino Kubitschek, President of Brazil 1956-1961, ordered for the construction of Brasília to begin. After 41 months, from 1956 to 1960, the city was officially inaugurated.\n\nIt was said, according to legend, that Italian Saint Don Bosco had a prophetic dream in 1833 about a futuristic city that roughly fitted Brasília's location. Nowadays, one of the city's main cathedrals bears his name.\n\nIt became the world's first capital city to be conceived by modern standards of urban planning. It was the only city of the 20th Century to be declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Brasília contains many world-famous architectural structures too. Just a few to mention include the Juscelino Kubitschek Bridge, the Cathedral of Brasília, the Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha Stadium and the Itamaraty Palace. This city would change history forever.\n\nIn the Movie[]\n\nWhen Blu accompanied by his family and friends leave Rio de Janeiro for the Amazon, they encounter many cities in their long journey. The first being Ouro Preto, the second city they pass is Brasília. They first fly over the Juscelino Kubitschek Bridge. Blu is busy looking at his GPS and is distracted while he flies low near the traffic on the bridge. He looks up and manages to avoid colliding with a truck just in time.\n\nLater in Brasília, Blu, placing a coin in the slot of a can vending machine, looks up in surprise to see his son Tiago inside. Being hit in the head by the drinking can, he and the can topple out. Tiago drinks out of the can quickly, drink splashing everywhere, and then he rudely burps. Blu, Tiago, Bia and Carla turn around to see Jewel glaring at them crossly.\n\nIn a nearby canyon,\n\nBlu looks at his GPS and points in the \"correct\" direction to go. Jewel attempts to call him back, before becoming very frustrated. As seen on the picture on the right (on Blu's GPS screen), the flight route to Salvador, Blu decided to choose was very confusing and complex.\n\nDuring their journey to the Amazon, the soundtrack played is \"Ô Vida\"."
