        "text": "The text, compiled by the outstanding professionals of Cuban television Ovidio Cabrera and Irma Cáceres, includes 25 anecdotes and over 100 photographs of intimate and public moments of the commander in chief of the Cuban Revolution.\n\nEntitled ¨Privileged of Time¨, the work contains memories of Cuban journalists and radio and television technicians, as well as experiences with Fidel Castro, recounted by the renowned meteorologist of the Caribbean country, José Rubiera.\n\nThe testimonies highlighted the humanism of the man of solidarity who is present in the most difficult and glorious moments of Cuba in the last century and part of the present.\n\nThus, each witness of his political work from 1959 until before his death on November 25, 2016, reveals him in the book as a human being “a conversationalist, interested in the problems of people, one who brings his people together and leads them,” said journalist Pedro Martínez Pirez.\n\nRubiera describes his dealings with people as “as if you were talking to a brother or a friend who, in addition, has an immense thirst for knowledge, from meteorological matters to the study of the planets and their atmosphere,” he said.\n\nIt was precisely he who gave the shortest and most rigorous speech ever given by any statesman, said the expert from the Cuban Institute of Meteorology, when he warned of the dangers looming over the human species, at the summit of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992.\n\nThe text, with a prologue by the honorary president of the Union of Cuban Journalists, Tubal Páez, will be presented in other capital venues, especially at the Fidel Castro Center, in the context of the 98th birthday of the Latin American and world leader.\n\nef/lam/lld"
