        "meta_description": "Rio de Janeiro was its capital for ages. But the city was crowded, government buildings were far apart and traffic was heavy. So the government decided to create a new city specifically developed to be the capital. Brasilia was born on April 21, 1960, four years after the toil of architects, engineers and city planners. The new capital, about 1,100 km from the previous one, is divided into numbered blocks for easier navigation — hotel sector, embassy sector, for example. Brasilia was also constructed in the country’s interior, to spur development there. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognised for its modernist architecture. Brazil: Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia",
