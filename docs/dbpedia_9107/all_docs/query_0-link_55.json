The city is the first Brazilian and Portuguese-speaking city to receive the title of World Book Capital, an honor granted by UNESCO in recognition of its excellent book and reading promotion programs. The city will assume this prestigious role in 2025, charged with fostering literature and coordinating events throughout the year.\n\nRio's Carnival is one of the most vibrant and world-famous festivities. The Carnival of Rio de Janeiro is a spectacle of colors, music, and joy. Known for its extravagant parades of samba schools, the event attracts millions of visitors from around the globe. The Carnival is a vibrant expression of Brazilian culture, where music, dance, and creativity unite in a memorable celebration.\n\nRio de Janeiro has a notable historical past as the capital of empires. The city was the capital of the Portuguese Empire, when the Portuguese royal family moved to Brazil in 1808, and acted as the capital of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves in 1815. Later, it became the capital of the Brazilian Empire following Brazil's independence in 1822. Subsequently, Rio de Janeiro served as the capital of Brazil until 1960 when Brasília was inaugurated as the new capital. This significant era in Rio's history contributed greatly to its cultural and architectural richness.\n\nRio de Janeiro boasts one of the largest networks of cultural facilities in Latin America. Acting as Brazil’s Capital of Culture, Rio is a hub for artistic and cultural activities, hosting a multitude of museums, art galleries, theaters, and cultural spaces that reflect the diversity and richness of Brazilian and Latin American culture.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nBOOK FESTIVALS\n\n​\n\nThe Rio de Janeiro Book Biennial is the largest literature, culture, and entertainment festival in Brazil, recognized as part of Rio de Janeiro's Intangible Cultural Heritage.
