        "text": "Colonial Rio\n\nThe initial governance of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was undertaken by Portuguese rulers who arrived at Guanabara Bay on January 1, 1502. Guanabara Bay, resembling the mouth of a river, inspired the city's name, 'Rio de Janeiro,' translating to 'River of January.' In 1555, French colonists occupied Guanabara Bay, known today as Villegagnon Island, seeking to exploit Rio's strategic position in the Brazilian region. However, after two years of intense warfare, the French were expelled from the city in 1567, unable to establish a lasting foothold.\n\nDuring the late 17th century, Rio de Janeiro emerged as a vital port for exporting gold, diamonds, and precious stones, driven by discoveries in nearby Minas Gerais. The colonial administration relocated from Salvador to Rio in 1763, establishing it as the capital until 1808.\n\nIn the 19th century, Rio faced economic challenges with diminishing gold and diamond reserves, prompting a shift to coffee exports. The Portuguese royal family's relocation to Rio spurred economic growth, modern infrastructure, and urban expansion. Historically central to the slave trade, Rio's port was the largest in the Americas. Even after Brazil declared independence in 1822, Rio remained the capital, flourishing through sugar cane and coffee cultivation.\n\nRio as capital of Brazil\n\nAs the capital of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro underwent significant changes in infrastructure and finances. The Central Zone was demolished to make way for the expansion of the city, including the construction of the Central Business District. Land reclamation efforts involved levelling hills to fill marsh areas. The city was reorganized into three zones, with the North Zone transforming into an industrial area and housing the working sector, while the South Zone became predominantly inhabited by the affluent.\n\nPost-World War II, Rio transitioned from an agricultural to an industrial economy. Infrastructure improvements included the construction of bridges between important cities, the erection of skyscrapers, and the development of freeways. The city's population soared, creating challenges as labour exceeded industry demands, resulting in a rise in the number of poor and unskilled individuals. This demographic pressure persists today, making Rio one of the most densely populated cities globally.\n\nRio in present\n\nIn the 1960s, Brazil's capital shifted from Rio to Brasilia and later to Sao Paulo, alleviating economic and financial pressures on Rio by relocating political power to the country's interior. Today, Rio remains a significant player in the industrial, service, and tourism sectors, with major multinational companies headquartered in the city, exerting influence on the broader Brazilian economy.\n\nIn 1992, Rio hosted the Earth Summit, a UN conference addressing environmental degradation. Additionally, the city hosted the 2007 Pan American Games, the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final, the 2016 Olympic Games, and the 2016 Paralympic Games, solidifying its role on the global stage.\n\nSince the beginning of the 2010s, Rio de Janeiro has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its contributions to arts, urban culture, and well-designed landscapes situated within a natural environment."
