        "text": "Internationally recognized for its natural beauty, Rio combines one of the most extensive urban forests in the world with a breath-taking coastline of paradisiacal shore, and world-famous landmarks, such as the statue of Christ the Redeemer, the Sugar Loaf Mountain, and the well-known beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema. The city dwellers, known as Cariocas, have a reputation for being easy-going, authentic, and spontaneous, always finding time for a chat or celebrating life.\n\nFounded in the 16th Century, Rio was the capital of Brazil from 1808 to 1960 and is today the second largest city in the country, with more than 11 million inhabitants, including the Metropolitan Area. The birthplace of Samba, Bossa Nova, and the Carioca Funk, Rio is a very diverse city with a vibrant cultural life, hosting some of the best museums and galleries in the country. Rio is a city full of contrasts within its four main areas – Central, South, North, and West Zones. The city boasts a varied architectural heritage, ranging from the colonial style to modern and contemporary buildings, and is also home for many favelas on the city’s hills.\n\nAlthough thermometers can reach 40ºC in the tropical summer, the temperatures are much milder in July, during the southern hemisphere winter. With temperatures ranging from 22-32ºC, the weather is enjoyable at this time of the year, with less rain and lower humidity compared to the other seasons. As in the rest of Brazil, Portuguese is the country’s official language, and the currency is the Brazilian Real.\n\nAfter recently hosting an array of international events and having revitalized its once decadent Harbor Area, Rio is currently trying to reinvent itself as an international innovation hub, attracting tech startups and educational institutions to the heart of the city, in order to exchange knowledge and services, creating a fertile environment for entrepreneurship and economic growth."
