        "text": "Rio de Janeiro, whose full name is Cidade de São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro, is a city and pier located on the Atlantic Ocean, in the southeast section of the tropical zone of South America, a city famous for being one of the most beautiful and interesting urban cities in the world. Even though the city is still the most notable icon of Brazil in the eyes of many, its architecture, people and way of life make it unique among other Brazilian cities. Rio de Janeiro got its name thanks to Portuguese sailors who, on 1st January 1502 wrongly interpreted their maps, thinking that there was an entrance to a river at the spot. This is why the city was named Rio de Janeiro (with Rio meaning river in Portuguese, and Janeiro being used to remember the day when the aforementioned sailors reached it).\n\nWhen the foundations of the future city were set in 1565, the city was named Cidade de São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro (“The city of Saint Sebastian from Rio de Janeiro“). São Sebastião is a Portuguese saint and former Portuguese King. Rio de Janeiro was an important Prtuguese colonial city, and the capital of Brazil between 1822 and 1960, when Brasilia took its place.\n\nRio is famous for its beaches and mountain tops, all of which are partly covered in tropic forests. The city is an entertainment center for both natives and foreign tourists, and you will be able to see people in swimming suits casually walking along the streets of the city, along its beaches or in public transport.\n\nEveryone has heard of the famous Rio Carneval, a time when the city is beautifully decorated, and the festive mood can be felt all around the city – music flows through the whole of Rio, and parties, games and parades with dancers in bright costumes dancing the samba can be seen wherever you may find yourself.\n\nRio is also an important economic center of the country, a developed industrial city, as well as a center of cultural heritage and, in addition to this, an educational center of Brazil.\n\nThe primary agricultural product of Rio de Janeiro is the sugar beet, which is exported in large quantities. The economic and social importance of Rio became apparent during the 18th century, after the city became an important trade center, and when its gold and diamond reserves became known. However, the attention caused by this economic upturn was short-lived. As the city entered the 19th century, sugar beet production in Brazil suffered due to competition from other South American countries, and the reserves of gold and diamonds began to dwindle. This all brought Brazil to a growing economic crisis. To prevent the situation from becoming out of control, Brazil began exporting coffee, and the Portuguese royal family moved to Rio de Janeiro.\n\nRio de Janeiro is a national capital and the home of the royal family, which significantly affected the continuous growth of the city, and, further, brought it the status of a world city. While São Paulo became the economic center of Brazil, and Brasilia strengthened its position as a political capital, the citizens of Rio are proud to be living in a cultural capital, and the most famous symbol in Brazil. It isn't for nothing that foreigners, when they think of Brazil, first remember Rio de Janeiro.\n\nWhen the Portuguese left the city, Rio proclaimed its independence. When Brazil became independent in 1889, Rio was named the capital of the country. As years passed, Rio changed significantly. The city center was demolished in order for the city to expand. Surrounding hills were demolished and used to fill in swamp lands. The city was divided into three zones, with the north zone becoming an industrial area, as well as a place where workers lived, and the south zone was reserved for the more affluent.\n\nAfter the end of World War Two, Rio experienced a shift from an agricultural to an industrial country. Bridges were constructed to connect big city centers, skyscrapers were built and roads were renovated. Population numbers grew exponentially. Today, Rio is one of the most populated cities in the world.\n\nRio is truly a beautiful city that looks like no other. The city's inhabitants are very hospitable, and they will make you feel at home."
