        "text": "Brasília is the capital of the South American country of Brazil. It is famous for the design of its buildings.\n\nTwo Brazilian architects designed much of Brasília. Lúcio Costa created the plan of the central city. From the air, the central city looks like a drawing of a bird or airplane. At the head of this “airplane,” near Lake Paranoá, are Brazil’s main government buildings. These were designed by Oscar Niemeyer.\n\nFacing each other across the wide Square of Three Powers are the Congressional Palace, the Palace of the Supreme Court, and the glass-sided Planalto Palace, where the president works. Nearby, on a triangle of land at the edge of the lake, is the president’s house, called the Palace of the Dawn. The Cathedral of Brasília has 16 white, curving supports and walls of colored glass. It is one of Oscar Niemeyer’s most famous creations. The National Theater, in a building shaped like a pyramid, features plays, symphonies, and operas. The Museum of Brasília teaches people about the history of the city.\n\nMany large companies have offices in Brasília. The government of Brazil employs many people in the city. Many others work in banking, law, or other service industries.\n\nBrasília was built in just a few years, starting in the late 1950s. Rio de Janeiro was the capital of Brazil until 1960. In that year the government offices began moving to Brasília. For many Brazilians, the city stood as a symbol of the way the country would grow in the future. However, many people were critical of the city’s great cost and its unusual architecture. Many also worried about environmental damage resulting from the new roads leading to the Amazon rainforest to the north. After a military government took control of Brazil in 1964, some of the plans for the city were changed, but Brasília continued to grow quickly.\n\nBy the 1990s, Brasília began to have problems that were common in other places, including crime and crowded conditions in poor areas. Lake Paranoá had become more and more polluted, but after a treatment program it is popular again for fishing and water sports. Population (2022 census), city, 2,923,369; urban area, 3,717,728."
