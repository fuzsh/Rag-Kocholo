        "text": "Flight: Most major airlines fly to Rio de Janeiro and the international airport is Antonio Carlos Jobin, more commonly known as Galeao Airport. It is located, 20 km (12 miles) from downtown. The second airport of Rio is Santos Dumont airport located downtown, surrounded by the Baia de Guanabara. Once at the airports, the best way to get to the downtown area will be with a private transfer.\n\nBus: All long-distance buses arrive at the Novo Rio Rodoviaria bus terminal, Av. Francisco Bicalho 1, Santo Cristo. It is close to downtown near the old port. It’s best to use a private transfer or taxi traveling to or from the station. It’s not the best part of town, particularly with all your bags. We recommend that you buy your ticket in advance, especially for travel on weekends or in high season.\n\nThe best time to visit Rio is between December and March, when the weather is warm and sunny enough to hit the beaches. The city’s seductive samba beat and incredible panoramic views last year-round, but arrive in February to experience Carnival.\n\nThe weather in Rio de Janeiro is a typical tropical climate with high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year, this is due to its location in the tropical South Atlantic. The average annual temperature ranges from 23ºC (74ºF) and 30ºC (86ºF). However, during some summer days (January-March) can reach up to 38ºC (100ºF) or even 40ºC (104ºf). During winter (June to August), temperatures in the area suffer a decline, but never gets cold (average temperature is usually not less than 18ºC / 64.4ºF), during this time the weather is cool and dry. Areas close to the mountains tend to be colder than areas near the coast, but also these areas enjoy pleasant weather and warm temperatures. The rainy season runs from November to March. Rains are usually heavy and short. It is unusual for falling water for a whole day.\n\nExchanging foreign money into Brazil currency in Rio de Janeiro is easy and is most commonly done at Bank ATMs, Cambios (stores that specialize in currency exchange), and at travel agencies. Currency exchange rates are posted in the window of most banks and at these agencies.\n\nAvoid exchanging money at the airport upon arrival, as lines are long and the exchange rate is poor. There has been a lot of card cloning fraud reported when using the ATMs at GIG International Airport. Hotels will often offer money exchange and convert it at the front desk. Hotel currency exchange rates are less competitive than the Banks and Cambios, but are usually better than rates at the airport.\n\nMany Cambios are located on the main avenues of Rua Visconde de Piraja in Ipanema and in Copacabana along the Avenida NS Copacabana. They will have “Cambio” signs in the windows and over the store. Cambios may be located inside travel agencies and will often give better Brazil currency exchange rates than the banks.\n\nATM cash withdrawal using a credit or debit card is the most convenient method to get Reais. Before leaving home, confirm with your bank or credit card company the procedures and fees charged for international ATM withdrawals. A service fee may also be charged by the Brazilian bank. Use ATMs that are located inside the bank lobbies. Never use one on the street or late in the evening (ATMs usually turn off at 11pm). Cover your PIN# with your hand and avoid withdrawing large sums at one time. An ATM that allow credit card withdrawal will have small credit card emblems on it. The current daily maximum withdrawal is R $1000. (R $300 maximum withdrawal after 10pm).\n\nExchanging money before you arrive can be easily completed using an on-line exchange service. The company will offer rates that are about 10% less than the official exchange rate and will charge $15 to send you the Brazilian Reais by overnight delivery. The minimum exchange is usually US $ 200 to a maximum of $250. A Visa or Mastercard must be used to exchange currency, and this is treated as a “cash advance” which your credit card company may treat differently than merchandise charges.\n\nUsing Credit Cards for currency exchange. Although restaurant and store merchants won’t advance you cash from your credit or debit card, paying for food and other services in Reais will usually result in a good exchange rate by your card company.
