        "text": "Rio de Janeiro is a travel destination beyond comparison, which attracts countless tourists with its unique geographical position, the lively rhythm of the samba and the world-famous beach of the Copacabana. With good reason, many locals call Rio \"Cidade Maravilhosa\", the \"wonderful city\".\n\nGeography - Brazil's second biggest city\n\nRio de Janeiro is Brazil's second biggest city after São Paulo with 11.9 million inhabitants and the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro. The metropolis lies at the Atlantic Ocean, on Guanabara Bay and at the foothills of the Serra do Mar, a mountain range in the south-east of the country with a length of 1,500 kilometres. The geography of Brazil's former capital is characterised by lush vegetation, wonderful bays, the world-famous beaches in the districts of Ipanema and Copacabana and the impressive granite hills of the adjacent mountain range. Two of them are Sugarloaf Mountain (394 m) and the Corcovado (704 m) with the statue of Christ the Redeemer. Both are world-famous landmarks of the city. Rio de Janeiro's highest point is the Pico da Tíjuca with a height of 1,022 metres in the national park of the same name. Due to the geographical position, there is tropical climate with stuffy, hot summers and warm winters in the metropolis.\n\nCulture - Two granite rocks and the statue of Christ the Redeemer\n\nExperience - Carnival, samba shows and Brazilian cuisine\n\nRio de Janeiro is most of all known for its carnival. The colourful spectacle is one of the world's greatest street festivals. The magnificent and shiny parade of the samba schools (Escolas de Samba) with artistic costumes, loud music and festive floats takea place in the parade area of the Sambadrome. It was built for the carnival parade in 1984 and can hold almost 9,000 spectators. In addition to the competition of the samba schools, samba events take place in many hotels, discos and clubs during the carnival. Travellers do not have to go without Brazil's national dance at other times either. Several samba shows take place in various locations throughout the year and you can visit a samba school to experience the atmosphere of the passionate dance. As in other parts of the country, Rio de Janeiro's cuisine is strongly influenced by European and African immigrants. This means that you do not only get international food but also local dishes such as the national dish feijoada, a rice and bean stew with meat. The so-called churrascarias, grill restaurants from Southern Brazil, are particularly popular. They do not only offer grilled meat (churrasco) but also organise traditional rodízio, a kind of all-you-can-eat buffet for grilled food.\n\nActivities - Surfing near Ipanema and hiking on the Corcovado\n\nA visit to the beaches in Ipanema and Copacabana is a must on a trip to Rio de Janeiro. The latter is without doubt one of the world's best-known beaches. Besides bathing, you can do a number of water sports here. Surfing, diving, snorkelling and rowing are only a few examples. Ipanema Beach is a paradise for surfers because due to the floodlight, you can even go surfing at night. If you want to avoid the vibrant activity at these beaches, you can relax at the more remote beaches in the vicinity. Hikers get their money's worth on the city's hills and in the Parque Nacional da Tijuca. The granite rocks are not only an excellent climbing location but they are also equipped with several hiking trails, which invite holidaymakers to long hikes with breathtaking views.\n\nInformation\n\nThe best time for a holiday in Rio de Janeiro is the winter (May to October). During these months, it is between 25 and 28 °C and there is little rain. Travellers best arrive at the Aeroporto Internacional do Rio de Janeiro/Galeão-Antonio Carlos Jobim (GIG), which is about 20 kilometres away from the city centre. You should adhere to certain rules on a tour through the metropolis. Slums and less busy streets should be avoided because they are often the scene of muggings. Holidaymakers should be careful at the beaches too. If you become the victim of a mugging, you should not argue and give the thieves your belongings. That is why it is better to only carry a certain amount of money with you and store important documents in the hotel safe. Unobtrusive clothing and a less expensive camera make it less likely for you to be mugged."
