        "text": "Answer: The capital of Brazil is Brasília which is located in the central-western region of the country.\n\nBrasília was officially inaugurated as the capital on April 21, 1960. The decision to move the capital from Rio de Janeiro to Brasília was made to promote the development of the interior and reduce the concentration of political and economic power on the coast. It was designed by the renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and urban planner Lúcio Costa. Brasília is celebrated for its modernist and innovative urban planning. The city’s layout resembles the shape of an airplane with different sectors designated for specific functions, such as government, residential, and commercial areas. The monumental architecture of Brasília which includes the National Congress, the Cathedral of Brasília, and the Palácio da Alvorada (the official residence of the President), reflects a distinct architectural style. Brasília plays a crucial role in the political and administrative affairs of Brazil, hosting key government institutions like the National Congress and the Presidential Palace. The city’s unique design and architectural significance have led to its recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it stands as a symbol of Brazil’s commitment to progress and modernity."
