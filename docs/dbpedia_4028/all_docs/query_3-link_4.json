The area has been inhabited since ancient times and has a rich and fascinating history.\n\nThe history of Old Cairo dates back to ancient times when it was known as Babylon in Egypt. The city was founded by Pharaoh Ramses II around 1250 BC and served as an important trading center for centuries. It was also home to temples dedicated to various gods and goddesses during this time.\n\nIn 641 AD, Old Cairo became part of the Islamic Empire when Amr ibn al-As conquered it for Islam. He built the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As which still stands today as one of the oldest mosques in Africa. This mosque served as a central place for Muslims to gather and worship during this period.\n\nDuring the Fatimid period (969-1171 AD), Old Cairo flourished under their rule and became an important center for learning and culture. This period saw the construction of many religious sites, including Al Azhar University, which is still one of the oldest universities in the world today.

During this period, he built several fortifications around Old Cairo, including Bab al-Futuh (the Gate of Conquest), which still stands today as one of its most famous landmarks.
