Thank you for your support.\n\nAfter visiting Cairo, Egypt more than ten times (and counting), I think I can officially claim that I’ve become somewhat of an expert on the best things to do in Cairo. Cairo is a city that’s enchanting and infuriating, requiring seemingly endless patience but rewarding you with timeless history, spectacular architecture, and tantalizing food. Cairo’s beauty may be hard to see at first glance, but if you spend more than a cursory two days for the Pyramids and Sphinx, you might be surprised to learn that there are endless places to visit in Cairo, a cosmopolitan and historical city in the country nicknamed “Mother of the World” (Um el Donya).\n\nThis comprehensive Cairo travel guide includes pretty much all of Cairo’s tourist attractions as well as plenty of hidden places that most tourists (and plenty of locals) don’t know about. I’ll continue to update this list as I return to Cairo and find even more cool places to visit, but in the meantime, here’s my list of the top things to do in Cairo, Egypt.\n\nThe Best Things to Do in Cairo, Egypt\n\nThere are plenty of amazing things to do in this city, and it might feel overwhelming to decide exactly what to see in Cairo. How long to spend in Cairo entirely depends on your interests (and your vacation time). I recommend a minimum of three days, but you could easily spend a week in Cairo without running out of things to do. My recommendations for the top things to do in Cairo (the absolute Cairo must-sees) are the Pyramids of Giza, The Egyptian Antiquities Museum, Khan-el-Khalili Market, Al-Muizz Street, and The Citadel. But like I said, there’s a lot to do and see in this grand city, so the more time you have, the better.\n\nBest Things to Do Around Giza\n\nThe Pyramids of Giza and The Sphinx\n\nThe Great Pyramids of Giza don’t need an introduction. More likely than not, they’re the primary reason you’re planning a visit to Egypt in the first place. This is the number one must-see place in Cairo and because of that, it attracts hordes of tourists and incessantly annoying touts. However, it is possible to have a pleasant experience at the Pyramids. Read my guide to visiting the Pyramids to find out how.\n\nThe Other Pyramids and Sphinx: Saqqara, Dahshur, and Memphis\n\nDid you know that there are other pyramids in Egypt besides the famous Pyramids of Giza? They’re not as large, but they’re spectacular in their own right. Want to know the best news about them? They’re virtually devoid of tourists (probably because many don’t know about them).\n\nSaqqara is known as the step pyramid and was built for King Djoser. It’s part of a huge complex that includes some seriously impressive tombs. The Dahshur Pyramids are known as the Bent and Red Pyramids and are some of the oldest pyramids in the country. And lastly, Memphis is the ancient capital of Egypt, where you can see the alabaster Sphinx as well as a colossal statue of Ramses II.\n\nI consider these to be must-visit places in Cairo, so it blows my mind that many skip over them. The three sites are a bit challenging to do independently without a car because they’re in somewhat secluded areas that are far from Downtown Cairo. I highly recommend a tour not just for transportation purposes, but for historical context as well. Book a tour here. Note: I don’t recommend combining these three sites with a visit to the Pyramids of Giza. This would make for a very long and somewhat rushed day.\n\nBest Things to Do in Islamic Cairo\n\nIslamic Cairo stretches far across the city, from the edges of the Citadel to the Museum of Islamic Arts, if we’re being technical. However, there’s a distinct cluster of old Islamic buildings in the area known as El-Gamaleya, stretching from Bab el Futuh to Bab Zuweila. This area is easily reachable by Uber. However, once inside it’s all too easy to get lost and stumble upon a historic door or building or to suddenly find yourself in the Khan-el-Khalili marketplace. That’s part of the fun!\n\nYou’ll likely want a guide if you want to explore this area in depth. Otherwise, the larger landmarks are somewhat easy to find on your own. Note: This is not a complete guide to Islamic Cairo, but includes the main highlights. If you’d prefer a guided tour of this area (recommended), check out this tour here.\n\nNote: Please ensure you wear appropriate attire when visiting mosques: covered hair, arms, and legs for the ladies and covered shoulders and knees for the men.\n\nAl-Muizz Street\n\nIf you choose to wander through this area on fyour own, the best route to take is the path down Al-Muizz Street, which basically takes you from one end of Old Islamic Cairo to the other. Named after the first Fatimad Caliph in Egypt, Al-Muizz Street has the highest density of Islamic monuments in Cairo, making it the best place to get a healthy dose of Islamic history in the city. It’s worth visiting both during the day and in the evening, as the vibe changes completely. Save the monuments and mosque visits for the morning and come back in the evening for the chaotic (albeit fun) ambiance of Old Cairo. Note: If you’re interested in doing a DIY walking tour of this street and the surrounding area, check out this Islamic Cairo Walking Tour map for guidance.\n\nThe Khan El Khalili Bazaar\n\nBuilt in the 14th century, Khan el Khalili was initially built as a mausoleum, later becoming a caravanserai and finally, a bazaar. This bazaar is an attraction to locals and tourists alike, selling everything from kitschy souvenirs to valuable gold jewelry to fragrant incense. This open-air market is a sensory overload, but definitely worth the visit. There’s really no place like it in the country and tourists have strong opinions about how much they love or hate it. Nonetheless, it’s a prime example of Egyptian culture so come armed with your bargaining skills and soak up the chaos. Read reviews so you can know what to expect here.\n\nMosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan\n\nBuilt in the 1300s in dedication to the sultan who took the throne at age 13, this mosque is well known for its striking architecture, particularly the four vaulted halls (called iwans). The iwans represent the four main schools of Sunnism in Islam: Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi’I, and Hanbali; this explains the inclusion of “madrassa” in the name, which means “school” in Arabic. Considered one of the finest examples of Mamluk architecture in Cairo, this building is not to be missed! The entrance fee is 120 EGP (January 2024). Read reviews here.\n\nAl-Hakim Mosque\n\nThis mosque is over a thousand years old but was used for a variety of purposes throughout history, including a school, prison, psychiatric ward, and more. It’s quite large, albeit plain, especially compared to many mosques in the area. However, its main standouts are its two minarets, which are part of the city walls, and its tranquility; it’s virtually empty compared to Al-Azhar Mosque nearby. Read reviews here.\n\nAl-Azhar Mosque\n\nTo date, Al-Azhar University is the most prestigious place to study Sunni Islam and is highly regarded as the highest religious authority in Egypt. Not only is the Al-Azhar Mosque one of the oldest mosques in Cairo but it’s also associated with the second-oldest educational institution in the world. The white alabaster interior of this mosque is particularly distinct, but every aspect of the architecture, both inside and out, is intricate. If you only choose to visit one mosque in this area, make it this one. Read reviews here.\n\nWhirling Dervishes at Wekalet el GhouriI\n\nI’ve seen my fair share of whirling dervishes but the performance at Wekalet el Ghouri is easily the best I’ve ever seen. Consisting of chants, music, and singing, this Sufi ritual is mesmerizing on its own; the fact that this particular show is performed in a thousand-year-old building only adds to that effect. The entrance fee is 90 EGP (January 2024) and performances are on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays at 7 pm or 8 pm, depending on the season. Plan to arrive by 6:30 pm to buy your tickets at the door. Read reviews here.\n\nNote: If you’d prefer to book through a company that includes a hotel transfer as well as the show, check out tickets here.\n\nMosque of Ibn Tulun\n\nAs the oldest mosque in Cairo to exist in its original form, the Mosque of Ibn Tulun is the largest by size, spanning an impressive six acres of land. Unfortunately, there are no formal tours of the grounds, but visitors should be sure not to miss the minaret with an external staircase, the painted prayer areas, and the carved columns. Read reviews here.\n\nBab Zuweila\n\nBab Zuweila is the only remaining southern gate to Old Islamic Cairo, and unlike its northern counterparts, the only one you can enter. On the ground floor is a helpful exhibit written in both Arabic and English that explains the historical significance of the gate. Climb the stairs (and up the two minarets if you’d like) and you’ll get spectacular panoramic views of Old Islamic Cairo and beyond. The entrance fee is 50 EGP (January 2024). Read reviews here.\n\nBest Things to Do in Abdeen and Around Old Cairo\n\nThis area is essentially an extension of Old Islamic Cairo, but for planning purposes, you’ll need a separate day to explore the area around Al-Muizz Street and another to visit the places listed below.\n\nAl Azhar Park\n\nConfession: I’m obsessed with city parks worldwide and always make a point to visit them when I travel. Al-Azhar Park is no exception to this rule and I enthusiastically recommend it to visitors who also enjoy visiting greenery to break up an urban city visit. Once a large dump, it’s now highlighted by beautiful fountains, intricate walkways, and lush gardens. It also has a restaurant and several cafes. I recommend visiting in the late afternoon and staying for sunset. Not only will you see some of the best views in the city, but you’ll also simultaneously hear the melodic call to prayer from several nearby mosques. For dinner, head to the park’s restaurant or pack a picnic lunch and enjoy it on the grass. There’s a small entrance fee (25 EGP as of January 2024) that helps keep the park in good shape. Read reviews here.\n\nMuseum of Islamic Arts\n\nThis museum was restored and re-opened in 2017 and is easily one of the most beautiful museums I’ve visited in Cairo. It holds thousands of artifacts, ranging from intricately carved doors to ancient manuscripts. It’s well set up, split into sections by time period, with explanations on the walls in both English and Arabic. This museum is a combination of both art and history, with religion taking a back seat. If you’re at all interested in learning about Islamic art, I highly recommend this overlooked gem. Note: the entrance to the museum is on the main road across from the military building and the entrance fee is 120 EGP (January 2024). Read reviews here.\n\nAbdeen Palace Museum\n\nThe lavish Abdeen Palace was the seat of the government until the early 50s. It’s currently one of the presidential residences although now it’s primarily used to host foreign dignitaries. The museums on the ground floor are the only parts of Abdeen Palace that are open to the public and contain the Presidential Gifts Museum, the Historical Documents Museum, the Silver Museum, the Royal Family Museum, and the Arms Museum. The Arms Museum is the most impressive of the collection, but if you aren’t particularly interested in weapons, then Abdeen Palace is by no means a must-do. The entrance fee is 100 EGP (January 2024). Read reviews here.\n\nThe Citadel and Mohammad Ali Mosque\n\nThe Cairo Citadel, also known as the Citadel of Saladin, was built in the late 1100s to protect Egypt against The Crusaders. Nowadays, the complex has a few palaces, several small museums (including the National Military Museum), and three distinct mosques (one of which is the Mohammad Ali Mosque). The Mohammad Ali Mosque is perhaps the most notable of the three, built in a similar architectural style to the Blue Mosque in Istanbul. That being said, the Al-Nasser Mohammed Mosque also holds its own in terms of architectural style. Due to The Citadel’s elevated location (it is a former fortress after all), you can get amazing views of Cairo, encompassing the Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan and even the Pyramids of Giza on a clear day! The entrance fee is 300 EGP (January 2024). Read reviews here.\n\nBest Things to Do in Downtown Cairo and Zamalek\n\nSunset Sailing on the Nile\n\nPicture this: it’s early evening, the weather is cooling down, and you’re eager to watch the sunset over the Nile. Why simply watch the sunset from the Qasr-el-Nile Bridge when you can see it while sailing on a boat? Hire a felucca (a traditional Egyptian sailboat), complete with music and a captain, and enjoy a beautiful sunset sail. Bring your own food and make a picnic out of it. Or, if you’re more of a party boat kind of person, opt for a Nile cruise: you get flashing lights, Egyptian dance music, and a motorized boat instead. No matter which you choose, you’re in for an enjoyable evening.\n\nTahrir Square\n\nTahrir Square was the central gathering point for Egyptians during the 2011 Arab Spring that overthrew former President Mubarak. It’s not a tourist attraction by any means, but rather a historic symbol for Egyptians. It’s located in the middle of the roundabout of the largest street in Downtown Cairo, across the street from the Egyptian Museum. You will likely see it if you visit the Egyptian Museum or stay downtown, so there’s no reason to make a special visit just to see Tahrir Square on its own. Read reviews here.\n\nCairo Tower\n\nStanding at 614 feet, Cairo Tower is the go-to place for impressive cityscape views, especially on a clear day. An elevator takes you to the observation deck, where you can enjoy 360 views of various parts of the city, including Giza, Zamalek, and Downtown. There’s also a cafe for those interested in dining with a view. I wouldn’t necessarily say Cairo Tower is a must-do activity as there are several places throughout the city where you can get panoramic views of Cairo. At the time of updating, tickets cost 250 EGP. Read reviews here.\n\nBest Things to Do in Coptic Cairo\n\nEven though Egypt is primarily Muslim, there’s a strong Coptic community in Cairo, primarily located in the area known as Coptic Cairo. Here, you’ll find an impressive collection of churches in various architectural styles, as well as the Coptic Museum and the Ben Ezra Synagogue. This area is easily reachable by metro (the stop is Mar Girgis) or Uber. You could easily wander through Coptic Cairo without a guide, provided you map the different parts out. If you’d prefer a guided tour instead (which always helps with context), check out this one here.\n\nCoptic Museum\n\nHome to some seriously impressive Coptic art and artifacts, this museum highlights the fascinating history and current culture of Coptic Christianity in Egypt. Nearly all the pieces have explanations both in English and Arabic and the museum is virtually empty. It was a pleasant surprise and it’s a shame there aren’t more visitors. The entrance fee is 100 EGP. Read reviews here.\n\nThe Hanging Church\n\nAlso known as the Church of the Virgin Mary, the Hanging Church gets its name because it’s built atop the walls of the Roman Fortress of Babylon. You can actually see the remains of the wall inside the church, where parts of the floor are made of glass. The church has an elegant and intricate design inside and out, with twin bell towers and a small inner courtyard. Read reviews here.\n\nMonastery and Church of St George\n\nThis Greek Orthodox Church and Monastery is a beautiful complex and one of the newer churches in Coptic Cairo (it was rebuilt in 1904 after the original building was destroyed by a fire). It’s Egypt’s main (and still operating) Greek Orthodox church and has a colorful interior, complete with bright ceiling murals. The round dome roof makes it particularly unique, and it’s worth visiting while in Coptic Cairo. Read reviews here.\n\nChurch of Saints Sergius and Bacchus\n\nThis church is small and was packed when I went but with good reason – it’s easily the most unique church I visited and has a fascinating history. Not only is it the oldest church inside Coptic Cairo, but it’s also built over a cave, which you can reach by descending steps. The guides said that this is where Jesus, Mary, and Joseph stayed when they were in Egypt – that certainly explained the crowds! Either way, it’s a fascinating place to visit. Read reviews here.\n\nChurch of St. Barbara\n\nThis small church is dedicated to a Christian martyr by the name of Barbara. It isn’t particularly notable in terms of style compared to the other churches, but just beyond the church is the unique Coptic cemetery. Read reviews here.\n\nBen Ezra Synagogue\n\nAccording to local legend, this synagogue is where the shores delivered baby Moses to the pharaoh’s daughter. I was initially surprised to find a synagogue amongst so many Christian buildings but later learned that the synagogue was purchased and converted from a church in the 9th century. You aren’t allowed to take photos in here, unfortunately, although there are plenty gracing the internet for some reason. Read reviews here.\n\nFun Things to Do in Other Neighborhoods\n\nNational Museum of Egyptian Civilization\n\nTo make things a bit confusing, there are several museums in Egypt housing the antiquities found in various tombs and temples across Egypt. Everything was once housed in the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Tahrir Square, but is now being split between the National Museum of Egyptian Antiquities (NMEC) near Fustat and the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza (slated to open in the summer of 2024).\n\nI’m updating this post in January 2024 to reflect my most recent visit a couple of months ago. If you, like most visitors, are interested in seeing the mummies, then you should visit NMEC, where they’re all housed in a special temperature-controlled mummies room. Photos are not allowed in the room (the above was taken when they were still housed at the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities), but it’s still fascinating to see the well-preserved remnants of ancient royalty we’ve all read about in history class (tufts of hair included!). And of course, there are plenty of other antiquities to enjoy as well.\n\nI’ll be sure to update this post on my next visit to reflect visits to the other two museums since I’m not sure what artifacts are moving to GEM and which are staying in MEA, but for NMEC, the entrance fee is 240 EGP. Read reviews here.\n\nCatch the views from Mokattam City\n\nFor spectacular views of the city from a distance, head up to Mokattam around sunset and enjoy a coffee or tea while gazing out at the city below. Both Cairo Tower and The Citadel offer great views of Cairo, but Mokattam is nice in that it’s a somewhat peaceful getaway from the city center. Note that it is the same mountain where the Cave Church (below) is located, so it might make sense to schedule both activities on the same day. Read reviews here.\n\nManial Palace / Palace of Mohamed Ali\n\nBuilt in the early 1900s by Prince Mohamed Ali, the Manial Palace Museum is incredibly impressive and seriously underrated. It has an extensive collection of well-preserved artifacts that showcase what life was like a century ago. The architecture is also beautiful, reflecting a variety of architectural styles. The best part is that the palace is nearly empty since many tourists don’t know about it. I saw maybe five other people during my entire visit. The entrance fee is 100 EGP. Read reviews here.\n\nHidden Gems in Cairo: Unique and Non-Touristy Things to Do in Cairo\n\nIf you’re spending a long time in the city or simply looking to get off the beaten path in Cairo, this section includes some unique places you can visit. The Cave Church is probably the only place where you might encounter some tourists, but you’ll never find the rest of these suggestions on any top 10 list of things to see in Cairo. Adventure awaits!\n\nEl Mastaba Center for Egyptian Folk Music\n\nThis community initiative was founded to provide a platform to both preserve and increase appreciation for performing arts and music. It was closed for several years but has recently reopened to the public. They primarily host musical performances from Nubian and Bedouin bands and it’s by no means a touristy thing to do. I only found out about it through a local friend. However, if you’re interested in enjoying a night of traditional music, check out their events on Facebook.\n\nPharaonic Village\n\nThe Pharaonic Village is a theme park meets museum dedicated to sharing the history and customs of ancient Egypt. I went as a teenager and while I found it to be cheesy AF, it’s still a fun activity to do if you take it for face value (and you have time to kill in Cairo). The most memorable part was the boat ride through the various time periods. Read reviews here.\n\nNilometer\n\nBefore the construction of the Aswan Dam, Egyptians used a device called the Nilometer to measure the level of the Nile River and predict its behavior. There were several nilometers around the country. The Cairo Nilometer is located on Rawda (or Rhoda) Island inside a modern building and is accessible to visitors. It’s really easy to get to by Uber if you type in Nilometer. The entrance fee is 20 EGP. Read reviews here.\n\nUmm Kalthoum Museum\n\nEven though this museum is dedicated to one of Egypt’s most famous artists, many people don’t know it exists. It’s small but includes a fairly extensive collection of her belongings, as well as an audiovisual library. This museum is best combined with a visit to the Nilometer, since they’re in the same area. The entrance fee is 20 EGP (January 2024). Read reviews here.\n\nThe Cave Church and Garbage City\n\nDeep in the heart of Garbage City, so named because it’s where the majority of the garbage collectors (Zabaleen) live, is The Monastery of Saint Simon, also known as the Cave Church. The Cave Church is a large Orthodox church built into a cave in the mountain – easily one of the most unique churches out there!\n\nYou do have to pass through the impoverished Garbage City to arrive at the church, so prepare to be a little shocked by the sights and smells en route. Garbage City itself is really fascinating, taking recycling to a whole new level. However, it’s not recommended to go wandering through on your own. Book a tour for some cultural context. Read reviews here and book a tour here.\n\nThe City of the Dead\n\nDid you know that in Cairo approximately half a million people live amongst mausoleums? Out of all the countries I’ve visited, this is a phenomenon I’ve only ever encountered in Cairo. Unlike many of the other Cairo attractions, this is a place you cannot visit on your own.\n\nAs part of a tour, you’ll get a knowledgeable guide who will share the fascinating history of the mausoleums as well as how people came to live there. I was personally surprised to see an entire thriving city within the walls of the cemetery. Note: you will be touring an impoverished area that many people call their home. Please be respectful and don’t snap photos of people without permission. Read reviews here and can book a tour here.\n\nBirqash Camel Market\n\nIf you really want to get off the beaten path in Cairo, look no further than the Birqash Camel Market, located around 20 miles outside of the city. A camel auction is one of the most adventurous things you can do in Cairo. Most of my local friends have never been, but all of them thought I was crazy for wanting to go at all. Note: This is not a tourist attraction, but rather a real-life camel market. If you’re easily overwhelmed then I don’t recommend this activity.\n\nIf you’d like to visit, there are a few things you should know. Keep an eye out for rogue camels – you don’t want to get trampled! Both men and women should dress conservatively out of respect (a note to women: this is a male-dominated market). Also, keep an eye out for pickpockets in busier parts of the market. Lastly, there are no bathrooms, so keep that in mind when, ahem, hydrating.\n\nThe market is open daily from 7 am – 11 am, but Friday is the best day to visit. If you’d like to go independently, an Uber will take you (I recommend asking them to wait). The entrance fee is 50 EGP. Read reviews here and if you’d like to book a tour, click here.\n\nZoom through the desert on a dune buggy\n\nSometimes, when I’m debating whether or not I should get travel insurance, I remember the time I decided to off-road in a dune buggy and ended up with a stitch in my head. Lesson: always get travel insurance. That being said, I have ridden dune buggies since (more cautiously) and can confirm that riding them through the desert is mad fun and you should totally do it, no matter how cheesy or touristy you think it is. You can actually explore the Pyramids on a dune buggy with this tour. Alternatively, if you find yourself at a beach resort, you’ll likely be able to ride one there as well.\n\nWhere to Eat in Cairo: The Best Restaurants in Cairo\n\nThere is so much good Egyptian food out there, that I wrote an entire guide to the best Egyptian food. I also included some of my favorite Cairo spots in there, for your eating pleasure. You’re welcome.

In general, I recommend staying in Downtown Cairo, Garden City, or Zamalek for the majority of your stay, since they’re central neighborhoods and easily accessible to the rest of the city. However, if you’d like a particularly memorable day at the Pyramids, staying at a hotel in Giza for the night before your visit is a pretty magical experience. I’ve included all the best Cairo hotel recommendations here. Note: The value of the dollar stretches far in Egypt. If you’ve always wanted to splurge on a luxury hotel, this is the country to do it!\n\nDowntown Cairo\n\nBackpack: If you’re all about that backpacker life, Meramees Hostel is the best budget hostel in Downtown Cairo. It’s centrally located, less than ten minutes walking from Tahrir Square, and offers both dorms and private rooms. The staff is friendly, the ambiance is chill and the beds are clean. Did I mention it’s really affordable too? Check it out here!\n\nMid-range: If you’re definitely way over backpacker life (or maybe you just never warmed up to the idea of sharing your room), Tahrir Plaza Suites is your spot for affordable accommodation without the frills. It’s a short walk from Tahrir Square and it’s more like a cozy bed and breakfast (breakfast is only $3 and very hearty). It’s spotlessly clean with excellent service and a small number of rooms. I stayed there on my last visit and would stay there again. It’s a tad noisy since it’s in the heart of downtown, but otherwise, no complaints. Check it out here!\n\nSplurge: Earlier I mentioned that Egypt is the best place to splurge on a hotel. I just looked up January prices for the Kempinski Nile Hotel, and they start at just $200 per night. SUCH a steal for a luxury hotel. Honestly, if this isn’t the best place to stay in Cairo, it’s definitely one of the top five. Nile views, a spectacular swimming pool, luxury rooms, and plenty of restaurant options are just a few of the fabulous amenities here. It’s a 15-minute walk from Tahrir, but feels like a world away from the chaos of Cairo. Check it out here!\n\nGiza (The Pyramids)\n\nIf you have time, I highly recommend staying at a hotel near the Pyramids for one night so you can get the true Pyramids experience. It’s magical to be able to see the sun rise and set over the Pyramids and it means you won’t have to wake up quite as early as you would if you were staying in Cairo. If you choose to stay in Giza for a night, I recommend visiting the Pyramids either at the beginning or end of your stay in Cairo so you don’t have to check in and out of hotels multiple times. There are tons of hotels in the area, so I’ve helped you narrow down your options with my recommendations below.\n\nMid-range: Great Pyramid Inn is only a 5-minute walk from the main entrance to The Pyramids and has seriously spectacular views. You can watch the evening Sound and Light Show from the comfort of the hotel (for free, heyyy). Plus they have a restaurant on-site, complimentary breakfast, and excellent customer service. Check it out here!\n\nIf the Great Pyramid Inn is fully booked and you’re looking for options at a similar price point with good views and service, check out Pyramids View Inn, Royal Pyramids Inn, or Hayat Pyramids View Hotel.\n\nSplurge: Alternatively, Marriot Mena House is the only 5-star hotel with views of the Pyramids. It’s about half a mile away from the Giza complex itself, but a nice luxury option that’s worth the splurge.\n\nThe Best Overnight Trips and Day Trips from Cairo\n\nAlthough all of these trips can be done in one very long day, I highly recommend staying overnight so as to not feel rushed. Both El Fayoum and The White Desert need 4×4 cars and permits, so they would be nearly impossible to do independently. The other recommendations can be done without guided tours.\n\nEl Fayoum and Wadi-el-Hitan\n\nJust an hour and a half outside of Cairo lies El Fayoum, a small city known for having the largest oasis in Egypt. A day trip to El Fayoum doesn’t just include a visit to the oasis though. The itinerary usually covers the beautiful Lake Qaroun, Wadi el-Rayan (a protected area where two lakes meet a waterfall), and Fayoum Oasis. If you only have a day to spare, check out this day trip.\n\nThe best way to truly experience this area is with an overnight trip, as you’ll be able to camp in the desert as well as visit the famous Wadi-el-Hitan (Whale’s Valley in English). This valley used to be a lake thousands of years ago, and you can visit the on-site museum and see a variety of fish fossils in the valley itself. It’s such a cool experience; I’m not sure why it took me so many visits to Cairo until I finally went. This company offers an overnight tour that includes both El Fayoum and Wadi-el-Hitan. Book it here.\n\nAlexandria\n\nAs Egypt’s second-largest city, Alexandria also deserves two days, although you can see the highlights in one. I know this from firsthand experience, having done both one-day and two-day visits. Many visitors are surprised to learn that the majority of the ruins here are Roman, not Pharaonic like in other parts of the country. Some of the highlights of Alexandria include the Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa, the Citadel of Qaitbay, and the Alexandria Library.\n\nVisitors can easily explore Alexandria independently, although it would be quite difficult to see everything in one day. If you do decide to visit Alexandria on your own, I recommend taking the express train from Cairo (2.5 hours), staying overnight, and exploring at your own pace. Alternatively, check out this comprehensive one-day tour or this overnight tour if you have a little more time.\n\nThe Black and White Deserts\n\nThere are landscapes that are beautiful and then there are landscapes that are truly out of this world. That’s the only way to describe hundreds of limestone rock formations shaped by centuries of wind and sand against a desert backdrop. The White and Black Deserts are seriously otherworldly, and truly a must-visit when in Egypt (check out my post about my overnight camping experience there). You can technically visit The White Desert in one day but it will be one really long day (I’m talking 12+ hours). However, if you have the time, an overnight trip is the way to go. Check out the day tour option or overnight option.\n\nThe Red Sea or The Mediterranean Sea\n\nEager for a getaway to the beach? Luckily you have a multitude of options! If a day trip is what you’re after, head to Egypt’s North Coast (specifically, El Alamein) for crystal clear waters and pristine beaches. A private car will get you there in less than three hours, but if you’re taking the train, it’ll take around 5.\n\nIf you have at least a few days to spare, check out the relaxed vibes at Dahab, the it spot for diving. I recommend flying rather than taking the 12+ hour bus. Other great spots for several days at the beach include Sharm-el-Sheikh, El Gouna, Marsa Matrouh, and Hurghada (Pssst: check some of the cool things to do in Hurghada). Most beaches can be reached with Go Bus or Super Jet if you’d rather not fly.\n\nWhat to Pack for Cairo and What to Wear in Egypt\n\nWhat you’ll pack and wear in Cairo (and Egypt as a whole) depends entirely on the season and which areas you’re traveling in. In general, Egypt is a conservative country. Women don’t have to cover their hair, but as a rule of thumb, shoulders and knees (to mid-calf, really) should be covered at all times, except at beach resorts. The same goes for men, especially if you want to somewhat blend in. Nobody will ever call tourists out for not adhering to this dress code, but I’m a firm believer in respecting local customs.\n\nAt beach resorts, you can more or less wear what you want at the beach and pool (although women shouldn’t go topless). However, wearing a cover-up or shirt at hotel restaurants, etc is a good idea.\n\nIf you’re visiting Cairo in the winter, it gets mildly cold (50s – 70s Fahrenheit). Leave your winter coat at home, but bring some sweaters, jackets, and pants. Alexandria is usually colder than Cairo, whereas Upper Egypt is warm, even during the winter. In the summer, it’s blazing hot everywhere.\n\nThere are quite a few specialty items you’ll need to pack for Egypt which is why I wrote the ultimate Egypt packing list.\n\nAlso don’t forget:\n\nTravel Insurance (because things can always go wrong!)\n\nA VPN for web security and to access many sites that are blocked in Egypt\n\nGet an eSIM for the road. It’s much easier than buying a local SIM, and it means you don’t have to worry about bad WiFi.\n\nPractical Tips for Egypt Travel\n\nVisas in Egypt\n\nAmericans need to get a visa for Egypt, which can be done either on or before arrival. If you choose to do it online, which I recommend, this is the application. If you prefer a visa on arrival, it costs $25 in cash. Bring exact change.\n\nHow to Get to Downtown Cairo from the Airport\n\nIf you won’t have data on your phone to call an Uber, I recommend booking an airport transfer ahead of time if you aren’t staying in a hotel that provides a shuttle. Taxis are a bit of a free-for-all all (especially at the airport) and the last thing you want to do is to start your trip feeling like you got ripped off.\n\nThe Best Time to Visit Egypt\n\nThere’s really no bad time to visit Egypt, as the weather is generally pleasant year-round, except for deathly hot summers.\n\nNovember – March: This is the best time to visit for cooler weather and generally empty sites (except December – early January because of school holidays). Winter is mild in Egypt but Alexandria (and sometimes Cairo) does see quite a bit of rain during this period.\n\nApril – May / September – October: These are the best months to visit Egypt, especially if you’re interested in traveling both in the North and the South. The weather is warmer but not scorching, so it’s pleasant enough to both hike and hit the beaches.\n\nJune – August: If you don’t mind the heat, summer in Egypt is perfect for all-day beach and pool lounging. This is peak tourism season at the Red Sea. Cairo, Luxor, and Aswan have fewer tourists due to temperatures that reach over 100 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIs Cairo Safe? Travel Safety in Cairo and Egypt in 2024\n\nI am no geopolitical expert, but I have traveled to Egypt enough times (at least ten at this point) in my life to vouch for my experiences. I have never felt unsafe in Egypt. Many family members and friends have visited countless times over the last few years and have said the same. Plus, the Egyptian government has gone above and beyond in improving security, especially at tourist sites and high-traffic areas. The train station even assigns guards to keep a special eye on tourist groups and travelers! My advice is to be as cautious as you’d be traveling anywhere in the world, but don’t let the media scare you away from Egypt.Note: my most recent visit was during the height of Israel’s war on Gaza. Cairo is far from the border and was unaffected.\n\nI’ve traveled in Egypt solo, with friends, with family, and on guided tours. I do recommend booking tour guides for certain activities (or ideally for your whole trip) just so you don’t have to deal with the frustrating aspects of traveling in Egypt, since it can be hard even for seasoned travelers. Alternatively, if group trips are more your style, the Intrepid Travel Egypt Adventure Tour was one of my favorite trips to Egypt. You can read my review of my Intrepid tour and decide for yourself!\n\nCurrency in Egypt\n\nEgypt uses the Egyptian Pound, and at the time of updating this post (January 2024), the rate was about USD $1 to 31 EGP. Credit cards are accepted at hotels, most tourist sites, and nicer restaurants, but it’s always good to have cash. There are plenty of ATM machines and currency exchanges all over the city.\n\nTransportation in Egypt\n\nThere’s plenty of public transportation in Egypt, but it can be confusing for visitors. I have yet to understand the bus and microbus system after several visits. The metro is safe, easy to understand, and inexpensive. There’s even a separate car for women and children, which is kind of nice. The metro doesn’t go everywhere, but I’ve used it a few times. To be honest, most travelers and locals rely heavily on Uber or Careem (the Arab version of Uber). It’s inexpensive, always available, safe, and hassle-free. I don’t recommend taxis unless you’re confident enough to haggle about the price.\n\nIf you’re traveling outside of Cairo to other major cities, you can either fly or take a train or bus. Ramses station in Downtown Cairo is the main train station (there’s a large station in Giza as well) and has routes to many popular destinations such as Alexandria, Luxor, and Aswan. If you’re headed to the Red Sea or Sinai, check out Go Bus and Super Jet for routes. Side note: the busses and trains are always freezing so plan accordingly.\n\nOther Things to Know\n\nCheck out my Egypt travel tips for first-time visitors for common misconceptions and other things you’ll want to know!\n\nWith this comprehensive Cairo travel guide, you’ve got all the tools to explore the city with confidence. Despite the culture shock that you’re certain to experience, you’re guaranteed to leave with life-long memories.\n\nMore Egypt Resources\n\nPlanning a trip to Egypt soon?
