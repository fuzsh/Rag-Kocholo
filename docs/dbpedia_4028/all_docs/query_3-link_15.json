        "text": "Cairo was my first introduction to Africa and to say that it took my breath away was an understatement. The capital city of Egypt has so much to offer visitors that it’s breathtakingly overwhelming. Most people jump right to seeing the pyramids over in Giza and then head down the Nile instead of enjoying the city. To be honest, I thought that’s what I should do as well, but my tour included two days in the city, which was a little short.\n\nThe ancient city is usually the welcome stop on a trip through Egypt (and can be a layover spot for many places in Africa). While most of the items below are located in Cairo, some are located nearby (such as the Pyramids of Giza). I include them since you can easily visit them while staying in Cairo.\n\nThis post contains affiliate links.

This helps me keep the site running and free.\n\nIf you like this post, be sure to sign up for my e-mail list for travel inspiration (and get your FREE budget printable), or connect with me on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or Pinterest.\n\nHow Much Time Do You Need in Cairo?\n\nI’m a big fan of a little time somewhere is better than no time at all! Depending on your schedule, interests, and budget, you can choose to spend one, two, or three days in Cairo and still get a taste of what it has to offer. Here are the basics if you’ve only got a short time!\n\nIf you only have one day in Cairo, you should focus on visiting the must-see sights. A great place to start is the Giza Pyramids, where you can marvel at the ancient wonders of the world and take in the amazing views of the nearby Sphinx. From there, head to the Egyptian Museum to see an impressive collection of artifacts and treasures from ancient times. For lunch, try some of the local delicacies at a restaurant in Old Cairo, where you can also visit mosques and the citadel. Finally, end your day at the bustling Khan el-Khalili bazaar to bargain with street vendors and pick up some souvenirs.\n\nWith two days in Cairo, you can expand on your itinerary and explore more of the city’s attractions. Start your second day by visiting the churches of Coptic Cairo, including the impressive Hanging Church and the Church of St. George. Afterward, head to the ancient city of Memphis and the nearby Saqqara, where you can see more pyramids as well as the famous Step Pyramid of Djoser. You can also take a relaxing boat ride on the Nile River or explore the bustling streets of Downtown Cairo.\n\nIf you have three days, you can truly dive deeper into Cairo’s treasures and explore at a slower pace. In addition to the sights mentioned above, you can also visit the Al-Azhar Mosque, the Saladin Citadel, and the impressive Cairo Tower, which offers stunning panoramic views over the city. You can also take a day trip to the nearby Abu Simbel or the Nile Delta, which will give you a better understanding of Egypt’s rich culture and history.\n\nWhen is the best time to visit Cairo?\n\nWhen it comes to the best time to visit Cairo, the peak tourist season is from November to February when the weather is cooler and more pleasant. However, if you don’t mind the hot weather, you can visit during the summer months of June to August. To deal with the hot weather, make sure to dress appropriately in lightweight and breathable clothing, stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, and plan your activities for the cooler parts of the day. I visited in May, and although it was hot, the temperatures were tolerable and enjoyable.\n\nNo matter how much time you have in Cairo, you’ll find that this city offers a unique blend of ancient history, bustling bazaars, and friendly locals that will leave you with unforgettable memories and experiences.\n\nBest Things to Do in Cairo\n\nThe sprawling capital of Egypt is steeped in ancient history and culture. With a vibrant energy that’s unlike anywhere else in the world, there’s no shortage of things to see and do here. So, whether you’re an avid history buff, a nature lover, or a shopping enthusiast, Cairo has something for everyone. In this article, we’ll be discussing some of the best things to do in Cairo to help you plan your trip and make the most of your time in this fascinating city.\n\nPyramids of Giza\n\nAre you ready to be awed by one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World? Look no further than the Pyramids of Giza in Cairo, Egypt.\n\nThe Pyramids of Giza are a trio of ancient wonders that draw in visitors from around the world. It’s easily the #1 thing on your to-do list in Cairo and it’s the biggest tourist attraction in Egypt. The largest of the three is the Pyramid of Khufu, also known as the Great Pyramid. This massive structure stands around 147 meters tall and was constructed using more than 2 million stone blocks. Can you even imagine how much manpower went into building it?\n\nAlthough the Pyramid of Khufu is the main attraction, the two smaller pyramids are also well worth a visit. The Pyramid of Khafre, Khufu’s son, stands at 136 meters and is home to several burial chambers. The Pyramid of Menkaure, Khufu’s grandson, is the smallest of the three and stands at a mere 66 meters tall.\n\nBut that’s not all! The Sphinx, a mythical creature with the body of a lion and the head of a human, also calls the Pyramids of Giza home. Carved out of limestone, this impressive statue stands at 73.5 meters and is believed to have guarded the pyramids for over 4,500 years.\n\nI highly recommend taking a tour guide with you to explore these ancient wonders. They’ll not only provide you with the interesting historical background behind the pyramids and Sphinx, but they’ll also help you navigate the crowds and keep you safe. Plus, they can give you insider tips on the best views and angles for photos.\n\nRecommended Tours that include the Pyramids:\n\n8 Hour Private tour of Pyramids, Egyptian Museum & Bazaar from Cairo\n\nHalf Day Tour Giza Pyramids & Sphinx with Private Tour Guide\n\nFrom Cairo: Pyramids of Giza, Sphinx, Saqqara & Memphis Tour\n\nFemale-Guided Pyramids, Bazaar and Museum Tour\n\nSee the Sphinx of Giza\n\nThe Sphinx stands serenely guarding the pyramids, and it’s an impressive statue with the body of a lion and the head of a human. I’m not sure why I didn’t realize HOW close the Sphinx is to the Pyramids, but it is. This monument is believed to have been built during the reign of the pharaoh Khafre, who was also responsible for constructing the Pyramid of Khafre.\n\nThe Sphinx of Giza is also noteworthy for its likeness to other depictions of the pharaoh, which suggests that he may have intended it to be his image. The Sphinx is made of limestone and stands at 73.5 meters, making it a grand sight to see against the backdrop of the pyramids.\n\nVisitors to the Pyramids of Giza are strongly encouraged to include a trip to the Sphinx in their itinerary. Attending the light and sound show is an excellent way to learn more about ancient Egyptian history while being entertained by a beautiful display of music and light.\n\nCitadel of Cairo (Salah El Din Citadel)\n\nThe Citadel of Cairo is a massive compound that served as the seat of government for nearly 700 years! It’s an icon of Cairo and a stunning piece of architecture.\n\nBuilt during the 12th century, the Citadel is the largest medieval fortress in the world and played a vital role in the city’s defense against invading armies. Today, it’s a popular tourist destination filled with important landmarks and fascinating museums.\n\nOne of the most impressive features of the Citadel is the Mosque of Muhammad Ali, a stunning example of Ottoman architecture that dominates the skyline of Cairo. Visitors can also explore the four main mosques within the compound, each with its own unique design and historical significance.\n\nTo get the most out of your visit, we recommend taking a guided tour led by a local historian. They’ll be able to provide in-depth information about the history of the Citadel and its significance in the region.\n\nTravel Tip: Be sure to dress conservatively for a visit to the Citadel. Cover your shoulders and knees. If you don’t, they provide covers and you’ll be expected to wear them.\n\nClimb the Minaret at Bab Zuweila\n\nBab Zuweila is one of three remaining gates in Old Cairo. It’s an impressive feat, and you can climb up it for awesome views of the city.\n\nBefore ascending, make sure to bring a flashlight to navigate the dark, narrow spiral staircase that leads to the top of the minaret. Once you climb the metal staircase, step out onto the ledge and climb over a waist-high wall to get the best view of historic Cairo and al-Muizz Street. Get ready to be amazed by the breathtaking view that awaits you!\n\nIt’s important to note that climbing the minaret requires a fee of 40 EGP for adults and 20 EGP for students with valid ID. But, if you want an alternative view, consider climbing to the rooftop of the mosque right next to the Bab Zuweila Minaret instead, which costs only 25 EGP per person.\n\nEgyptian Museum\n\nIf you’re visiting Cairo, there’s one attraction that should be on the top of your list: The Egyptian Museum. Located in the heart of the city, this museum is a treasure trove of Egyptian antiquities that will leave you in awe. I think this is where I truly fell in love with Egypt.\n\nThe museum is home to the world’s largest collection of Egyptian artifacts. Don’t miss the golden sarcophagi of Tutankhamun! There is a solid gold mask there as well that is very beautiful and intricate.\n\nIf you’re fascinated by the lives of Egyptian royalty, you’ll love seeing their mummified remains. These eerily preserved bodies allow us to see what these people looked like thousands of years ago. You’ll also be able to marvel at the gold-embellished treasures that were buried with them.\n\nNote: The Grand Egyptian Museum is expected to open in 2023. Once open, this museum will replace the current Egyptian Museum. The Grand Museum is located next to the Giza Plateau instead of in the heart of Cairo, and it’s expected to be quite large!\n\nAl-Muizz li-Din Allah al-Fatima Street\n\nTake a step back in time and explore the historic street of Al-Muizz li-Din Allah al-Fatima, one of the oldest and most notable streets in Cairo. This vibrant street runs north-south through Islamic Cairo and is filled with countless landmarks, including madrassas, mosques, markets, hammams, and more. The 1 km route is overwhelming with its congestion and noise, but it’s an absolute must-visit spot for travelers looking to immerse themselves in the local culture and heritage.\n\nAs you walk down this iconic street, you will come across many interesting sights that are both unique and inspiring. One of the top attractions is the Tent Makers Market, where you’ll find an array of colorful handmade textiles and fabrics. The produce market is another must-see, with its vibrant displays of fresh fruits and vegetables that tantalize the senses.\n\nFor those who love browsing through small shops, Al-Muizz li-Din Allah al-Fatima Street will not disappoint. From beautiful ceramics and jewelry to intricate woodwork and delicious street food, the diverse range of small shops on this historic street are sure to catch your eye and spark your interest.\n\nKhan el-Khalili\n\nOne of the best things to do in Cairo is visit the Khan el-Khalili market, one of the oldest and most vibrant marketplaces in the city. This market has been a bustling hub of activity for centuries, and it remains a popular destination for both locals and tourists.\n\nAs soon as you enter the market, you’ll be struck by the buzzing atmosphere and the colorful stalls and shops, selling everything from antiques and lamps to clothes and perfumes. It’s a great place to wander around and soak up the sights, sounds, and smells of Cairo.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that the Khan el-Khalili market can get quite touristy, and visitors should prepare to bargain hard or pay inflated prices. This is no place to be shy, so brush up on your bargaining skills before entering the market.\n\nThat being said, the Khan el-Khalili market is a must-see and not to be missed on your trip to Cairo. To make the most of your visit, try to tour the market as the sun sets when the shop lights twinkle as the night falls. This is a magical experience and will give you a unique view of the market. The market is usually open until midnight!\n\nRecommended Tour that includes Khan Khalili Bazaar\n\nCairo Private Day Tour to Egyptian Museum Citadel and Khan Khalili Bazaar\n\nCairo Tower\n\nIf you want to see Cairo from above and enjoy a delightful meal while you’re at it, the Cairo Tower is the perfect destination for you. As one of the most distinctive landmarks in the city’s skyline, the Cairo Tower offers breathtaking panoramic views that you can’t miss.\n\nThe tower is located in the heart of Cairo and can easily be accessed by taking a taxi or walking from the Opera subway station. Once you’re there, you can choose between two dining options: a casual dining experience at the Sky Window Café or a fine dining experience at the 360 Revolving Restaurant.\n\nThe café has no minimum spending requirement, making it an excellent choice if you’re on a budget. On the other hand, the revolving restaurant requires a minimum purchase of 250 EGP per person, but it does offer a 360-degree view of the city as it rotates slowly on top of the tower.\n\nBefore heading up to the tower, visitors should note that they are required to leave their food and snacks at the guardhouse located at the base of the tower. This is a safety requirement, but don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of options once you’re up there.\n\nThe Cairo Tower is open from 9 am to midnight, and the restaurant and viewing deck remain open until 1 am every day. So whether you want to see the city during the day or at night, you can’t miss this opportunity.\n\nRecommended Tour that includes Cairo Tower:\n\nEl-Moez Street Tour & Cairo Tower Revolving Dinner\n\nIslamic Cairo\n\nIf you’re eager to dive deep into Egypt’s rich history, Islamic Cairo should be at the top of your list. This sprawling neighborhood is home to an array of historical landmarks, including mosques, mausoleums, markets, fountains, and palaces.\n\nIslamic Cairo has great significance in Egypt’s history, and it’s a must-visit for anyone looking to learn more about the country’s cultural heritage. A tour that covers both Islamic Cairo and Coptic Cairo will give you an extensive understanding of the city’s history.\n\nVisitors to Islamic Cairo should stop at the Qalawun Complex and Al-Hakim Mosque, two notable landmarks that have stood the test of time. The Qalawun Complex was built by the Mamluk sultan and is a marvel of Islamic architecture.

It’s said that the mosque was constructed by Sultan Hassan himself and demonstrates the pinnacle of Mamluk architecture. The sheer size of the building is awe-inspiring, and visitors can’t help but feel a sense of wonder at the intricate details and grandeur of the structure.\n\nNext door to the Sultan Hassan is Al-Rifa’i Mosque, which has a fascinating history of its own. Initially built in the twelfth century, the mosque was expanded and replaced by Lady Khushiar Hanim in the nineteenth century. It’s interesting to note that Al-Rifa’i Mosque served as the temporary resting place for Reza Shah of Iran back in the day. Today, the mosque is occupied by the son of Reza Shah and is a popular tourist destination.\n\nBoth mosques have unique features that set them apart from one another. The Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan’s enormous size is one of its main draws, as it’s one of the largest Islamic structures in the world. Meanwhile, Al-Rifa’i Mosque has its own unique design features, including the distinctive minarets that tower over the surrounding buildings.\n\nMosque of Ibn Tulun\n\nIf you haven’t gotten your fills of mosques yet, don’t worry – there’s still a few left on the list! The stunning Mosque of Ibn Tulun should be on your list of must-visit places in Cairo. With its incredible historical significance and unique architectural features, the mosque is truly a sight to behold.\n\nLocated in the heart of Cairo’s historic district, the Ibn Tulun Mosque dates back to the ninth century and is one of the oldest and most well-preserved mosques in Egypt. It’s named after the governor of Egypt at the time, Ahmad ibn Tulun, who commissioned its construction.\n\nOne of the most impressive features of the mosque is the intricate frieze work that adorns the exterior walls, which includes intricate geometric patterns and plant motifs. Inside, you’ll be struck by the ornate decoration of the main prayer hall, which is truly a masterpiece of Islamic art and design.\n\nOne of the most iconic parts of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun is its spiral minaret, which has become a signature feature of the city’s skyline. Visitors can climb up to the top platform for superb views of the surrounding area.\n\nIf you’re planning to visit the mosque, it’s important to note that appropriate dress is required, particularly for women. To show respect, it’s best to wear a scarf to cover your head and shoulders. It’s a small gesture that goes a long way in demonstrating cultural understanding and appreciation. This scarf is lightweight so you won’t get too hot in the Egyptian sun.\n\nAl-Rifa’i Mosque\n\nAl-Rifa’i is located in the Citadel Square, next to the Cairo Citadel. This striking landmark functions as a royal mausoleum and boasts a storied history that dates back centuries.\n\nBuilt during the late 1800s, the Al-Rifa’i Mosque is a prime example of Islamic architecture and design. Its most distinctive features include the incorporation of Ancient Egyptian columns and an enclosed design that sets it apart from nearby structures, such as the Sultan Hassan Mosque.\n\nAside from its aesthetic appeal, this mosque holds significant cultural and historical importance for the people of Cairo. It serves as the final resting place for a number of Egypt’s most notable figures, including members of the royal family and esteemed religious scholars. It is the royal mausoleum of Muhammad Ali’s family.\n\nIf you do visit, please remember to be respectful to those also there. Don’t take pictures of people trying to pay their respects.\n\nAl-Azhar Park\n\nOne of the best things to do in Cairo, especially if you need a break from the hustle of the city, is to visit Al-Azhar Park. This oasis of greenery is the perfect place to breathe in the fresh air and take a leisurely stroll through its serene gardens, fountains, and lake.\n\nSpanning across 30 hectares, Al-Azhar Park is a park like no other. The park opened in 2005, and it boasts a rich history and beautiful architecture that blends the old with the new. One of its prime features is an elevated area that provides a clear view of the surrounding city, making it an ideal spot for nature lovers and photographers.\n\nThe park’s walking paths are well-manicured and provide a serene escape from the busy streets of Cairo. The park is also an excellent spot for cultural events and festivities, with concerts, performances, and exhibits held all year round. This is an ideal place for locals and travelers alike to immerse themselves in Egyptian culture and traditions.\n\nAnother noteworthy feature is that Al-Azhar Park is built on top of a 14th-century rubble dump, which was cleared out and transformed into a beautiful park, complete with gardens, fountains, and walkways. It’s an excellent example of how urban spaces can be repurposed and transformed into something beautiful and beneficial.\n\nCoptic Cairo\n\nAs one of the oldest districts in Cairo, Coptic Cairo is a must-visit destination for all history buffs and culture seekers.

The district is home to several iconic landmarks, including the Fortress of Babylon, Abu Serga, and the Coptic Museum.

The museum’s architecture itself is noteworthy, blending elements of Islamic and Coptic styles, reflecting the cultural and historical influences of the region.\n\nInside the museum, visitors are greeted with a fascinating array of exhibits spanning several centuries. The collection encompasses a diverse range of objects, including intricately carved wooden furniture, beautifully illuminated manuscripts, delicate textiles, and exquisite icons depicting religious scenes. These artifacts offer a glimpse into the artistic and religious traditions of the Coptic community throughout the ages.\n\nOne of the highlights of the Coptic Museum is the collection of ancient Coptic textiles, considered among the finest in the world. These textiles display remarkable craftsmanship, featuring vibrant colors, intricate patterns, and meticulous embroidery.\n\nThe Hanging Church\n\nNext door to the Coptic Museum, you’ll find the Hanging Church. As the name suggests, this incredible church is unique in that it hangs suspended over a Roman fortress, giving it a one-of-a-kind position and breathtaking views. It has been standing for over a thousand years, making it one of the oldest and most famous in all of Egypt.\n\nOnce you step inside this historic building, you’ll be blown away by the stunning architecture and design elements that have remained remarkably well-preserved throughout the centuries.

It has served as an important gathering place for the Coptic Orthodox community for hundreds of years, and has experienced some of the most pivotal moments in Egypt’s ancient and modern history.\n\nBen Ezra Synagogue\n\nThis building has seen incredible transformations over the past 1000 years and is a testament to the rich cultural and religious diversity found in Egypt’s history.\n\nOriginally built as a church in the 5th century, the Ben Ezra Synagogue (sometimes referred to as the El-Geniza Synagogue) was transformed into a Jewish place of worship in the 11th century. This conversion came about after a group of Jewish merchants bought the building from the local Christian community. It’s said that this was an effort to create a new synagogue for the previously scattered Jewish community in Cairo.\n\nSince then, the building has been remodeled and restored several times, with the most recent restoration taking place in the 1980s. Thanks to these renovations, the Ben Ezra Synagogue still stands tall and proud today, ready for history lovers to explore.\n\nThe Ben Ezra Synagogue is an important part of the once-prominent Jewish community in Cairo. It has served as a hub for the community, hosting everything from religious services to weddings and even funerals. Today, the synagogue remains an essential symbol of Egypt’s diverse cultural and religious heritage and serves as an important place of worship for the few remaining Jewish people in Cairo.\n\nIf you’re interested in exploring the rich history and significance of the Ben Ezra Synagogue, I highly recommend going on a guided tour. An expert guide will be able to give you more context about the building’s fascinating history and its role in the Jewish community.\n\nChurch of St. Sergius and Bacchus\n\nBelieved to be the refuge of the Holy Family at the end of their journey to Egypt, the Church of St. Sergius and Bacchus is an early Christian church that still stands today. Its beautiful interior is adorned with intricate woodworking and tilework, making it a must-see for any history or architecture enthusiast.\n\nOne of the church’s most notable features is the hanging nave above the passageway, which adds to the grandeur of the building.

The Abu Serga church, believed to have been built on the grounds of the Palace of Hormisdas, is also a popular attraction among tourists and locals alike.\n\nIf you’re interested in exploring the Coptic Christian community in Cairo, it’s best to join a tour that includes the Church of St. Sergius and Bacchus and other important sites as well.
