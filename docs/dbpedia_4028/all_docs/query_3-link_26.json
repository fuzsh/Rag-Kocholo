It is a part of Old Cairo and encompasses many Coptic churches and other historical sites, including the Babylon Fortress, the Coptic Museum, the Greek Church of St. George, and the Hanging Church. The area is believed to have been settled as early as the 6th century BC, when Persian invaders built a fort on the Nile north of Memphis. According to Christian tradition, Coptic Cairo served as a stop for the Holy Family and is home to the site of Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church (Abu Serga), where they were believed to have stayed during their journey through Egypt.\n\nCoptic Cairo was a significant stronghold for Christianity in Egypt before and during the Islamic era. Many of its churches were built after the Muslim conquest of Egypt in the 7th century. It is a predominantly Christian area to this day and hosts many historically important churches, including Saint Mary Church (Haret Elroum), Saint Mercurius Church, The Church of the Holy Virgin (Babylon El-Darag), Saint Barbara Church, and The Church of Saint Menas. The Hanging Church, also known as the Church of the Virgin Mary, is one of the most famous churches in the area due to its location above the gatehouse of the ancient Roman fortress.\n\nCoptic Cairo is a popular tourist attraction, attracting visitors from all over the world to view the spectacular Coptic art and architecture that has survived over the centuries. Visitors can also take virtual tours through the churches and Old Cairo, enjoy interactive audio-instruction for the pronunciation of the Coptic alphabet, and learn about Egyptâ€™s indigenous Christian community."
