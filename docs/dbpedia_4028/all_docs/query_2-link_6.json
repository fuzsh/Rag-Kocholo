        "text": "The Church of Saint George is a Greek Orthodox and former Anglican church inside the Old Fortress of Corfu in Corfu Town.\n\nThe church was built in 1840 during the English Protection of the Ionian Islands (1814-1864) to meet the religious needs of English soldiers on Corfu. Materials from demolished houses in the surrounding area were used to build the Anglican church. After the Union of the Ionian Islands with Greece in 1865, the church became Orthodox and was inaugurated by Athanasios Politis, the Metropolitan of Corfu, on 21 March of the same year. From that moment the church became dedicated to Saint George (Agios Georgios), protector of the Infantry Corps. The Voulgaris family donated the old iconostasis from the Saint Spyridon Church, a work of the Cretan hagiographer Emmanuel Janne.\n\nThe Church of Saint George is built in a Georgian-style, three-aisled basilica with a gallery made up of six Doric columns supporting a pediment at the front entrance. During World War II the church got severely damaged by the German bombings of 1943, after which a major restoration took place."
