Unless you really have research or love this thing, it feels like ordinary people will not choose to come for the second time. There is no difference in following up the village, the smell of shit is heavy, the quality of the locals is not high, go in to ride a horse and camel, in addition to the money that should be given, there are tips, anyway, it is a common phenomenon in places with poor living standards, so no matter what you do, keep an eye on it.Syed Hussen : The Citadel of Cairo or Citadel of Saladin (Arabic: قلعة صلاح الدين, romanized: Qalaʿat Salāḥ ad-Dīn) is a medieval Islamic-era fortification in Cairo, Egypt, built by Salah ad-Din (Saladin) and further developed by subsequent Egyptian rulers. It was the seat of government in Egypt and the residence of its rulers for nearly 700 years from the 13th to the 19th centuries. Its location on a promontory of the Mokattam hills near the center of Cairo commands a strategic position overlooking the city and dominating its skyline. When it was constructed it was among the most impressive and ambitious military fortification projects of its time. It is now a preserved historic site, including mosques and museums."
