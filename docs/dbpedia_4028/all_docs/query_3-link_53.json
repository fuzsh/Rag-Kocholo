        "text": "The capital of Egypt for thousands of years, little remains of this once great city to attest to its glory. Memphis was founded by the I Dynasty pharaoh Menes around 3100 BCE and destroyed after the Arab conquest in the 6th Century CE. Most of its treasures were looted or reused in other monuments and the sparse remains hardly warrant a special excursion. Worth seeing, however, is the colossal statue of Ramses II, alabaster sphinx of King Thutmose III and embalming slabs where the holy Apis bulls were mummified. Most of the artifacts have been gathered for display in a garden. A nominal admission fee is charged.\n\nAn everlasting symbol of human endeavor and exemplary ancient architecture, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest and only remaining intact member of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World. Every year when the great Nile flooded the golden soils of Egypt, Pharaoh Khufu hired several unemployed civilians to contribute to the construction of this mystical structure, a persevering effort that lasted nearly two decades. Appearing to worship the mighty skies, this colossal pyramid rises from the ground to meet its apex at 147 meters (481 feet), and is deemed to be the tallest structure in the world to be built by human hands. While the pyramid is composed of three known chambers, it was originally intended to serve as a tomb for the reigning emperor. The Great Pyramid continues to shine mysteriously under the gaze of the unforgiving sun, a glorious form built of three million limestone blocks, and years of plentiful toil.\n\nThis beautiful mosque is affiliated with Al-Azhar University, one of the oldest Islamic universities in the world and a prestigious center of learning since 970 CE. Centuries ago, lectures were held in the mosque itself. Today, they are held in the university's annex buildings, which are located all over Cairo and attract Islamic scholars and students from around the world. Al-Azhar Mosque is one of the most picturesque buildings in Cairo. Its slender minarets pierce the sky and look absolutely stunning when lit up at night. The architecture is an amalgam of styles built over the ages, all coming together to create one harmonious house of worship.\n\nThe mighty Pyramid of Djoser is one of Egypt’s most iconic attractions and dates all the way back to the Third Dynasty, or roughly 27th Century BCE. This massive structure located in the Saqqara necropolis represents a turning point in Egyptian burial practices. Up until Imhotep designed this pyramid, which is comprised of six stacked mastabas of decreasing size, pharaohs were entombed in singular mastabas, which were flat-roofed rectangular brick structures. This step pyramid served as the predecessor for such smooth-sided structures as the Great Pyramids of Giza. As the name implies, the pyramid houses the remains of the pharaoh Djoser, though many of the wonders he was buried with were stolen by grave robbers over the ensuing centuries. With special permission, guests can explore the funerary complex surrounding the pyramid, including the hypostyle hall and Great South Court, parts of which have been restored.\n\nOf all Egypt's monuments, none is as majestic and haunting as the Great Sphinx. It was named as such by the Greeks, because of its physical similarity to a mythical creature with a lion's body and woman's head who devoured passers-by unable to answer her riddle. Arabs know it as Abu el-Hol (Father of Terror). Carved out of a limestone outcropping in front of the Giza Pyramids, the Sphinx is 50 x 20 meters (165 x 65 feet) high. Conventional archaeologists attribute its construction to the Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Khafre (who built one of the three pyramids behind it), but others suggest it may be much older. The nose and beard were later believed to be shot off by Mameluke troops who used the Sphinx for target practice. Visitors cannot climb on the monument, but there is a viewing platform accessible through the granite mortuary temple to one side.\n\nDahshur is home to some of Egypt’s largest and oldest pyramids. The Red Pyramid is the first smooth-sided pyramid in the world. The Bent Pyramid is aptly named, with a sharp change in its incline around the middle which gives it a more rounded look. And then there is the Pyramid of Amenemhet III, which hasn’t held up as well over time and doesn’t really look like a pyramid at all anymore, but if you think about it, it’s amazing that we can see anything that was built that long ago at all.\n\nThe Giza Necropolis is an archaeological landmark on the Giza Plateau. Located a short distance from Cairo city center, on the Nile, this site features the Great Pyramids, the Great Sphinx as well as several cemeteries and iconic structures. The Great Pyramids comprises of three complexes called Khufu's, Khafre's and Menkaure's. The Sphinx is symbolic of Egypt, built in limestone, this statue is of a mythical creature with the body of a lion and a head of a human, said to be of Pharaoh Khafra. This ancient necropolis is one of the oldest, well-preserved wonders of the world and features on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nInhabited by one civilization or the other since the 6th century, Coptic Cairo is an amalgamation of various ancient cultures and is a symbol of Cairo's Christian heritage. Noteworthy structures are the Babylon Fortress, the Hanging Church, the Greek Church of St. George and Coptic Museum, each extremely diverse in its architecture. While only parts of the fortress stand, the two prominent churches remain intact. The complex also has several other Coptic structures and you can learn all about this region's cultural and historical importance at the museum.\n\nThe 50 rooms of this palace are ornately decorated with artistic ceilings, paintings, and antiques. Originally built in 1897, this breathtaking structure was the creation of Habib Sakakini Pasha. He envisioned a European palace and had Italian architects design it with a building in Italy serving as the inspiration. Across the exterior's five stories, you'll see steeples, statues, cupolas, and domes, as well as beautifully carved exterior facades.\n\nEl Hussein Mosque is one of the most significant Islamic landmarks in all of Egypt. This revered structure was originally constructed in 1154 CE and was dedicated to the grandson of Prophet Mohammed, Hussain ibn Ali. Some believe that Hussain’s head is buried within the shrine’s original mausoleum, which was constructed at the same time as the mosque and has remained relatively untouched. The original building has undergone many renovations over time. The beautiful mosque that visitors can admire today was built in the Gothic Revival style back in the 1800s. In addition to its ancient mausoleum, the mosque is also home to the oldest complete copy of the Quran. Situated near Cairo’s Khan El-Khalili bazaar, entry into the mosque is restricted to those who follow the Islamic faith, though non-Muslims can view this stunning structure from the outside.\n\nBuilt in 1087 CE to protect the city's northern perimeter, Bab al-Futuh was for a century the arrival point of pilgrim caravans returning from Mecca. The hulking gate is actually much larger than it seems, with its base sitting 5 meters (16 feet) below ground level. The gate can be visited at any time, but a day trip is recommended if one wishes to ascend the two conical towers. The gate is adorned with intricate motifs.\n\nCommemorating Egypt’s victorious offensive against Israel in the 1973 October War, this pavilion located in Heliopolis, Cairo, features 360-degree war films of Egyptian soldiers storming the Bar-Lev Line on the Suez Canal. The building itself is a famous example of Islamic architecture and is shaped into a stunning cylindrical fortress. Visitors to the museum can wander around the outdoor area, which displays tanks, aircraft and other military vehicles that were used in the war, before heading into the two indoor halls, both of which showcase movies. Visitors to the second hall should take note that the 360-degree shows are presented in Arabic and sometimes in English, and give those viewing it a chance to feel like they were a part of the action."
