        "text": "Two blasts targeting Coptic Christians in Egypt on Palm Sunday have killed at least 44 people, officials say.\n\nAn explosion at St George's Coptic church in Tanta killed 27 people. Hours later, a blast outside St Mark's Coptic church in Alexandria left 17 dead.\n\nSo-called Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the explosions, the latest in a series of attacks targeting the Christian minority in the country.\n\nPresident Abdul Fattah al-Sisi ordered military deployments across Egypt.\n\nIn a statement, he said the army would be sent to protect \"vital and important infrastructure\". The government announced three days of mourning.\n\nIn Alexandria, Pope Tawadros II, head of the Coptic Church, had been attending Mass inside the church targeted but was not hurt, state media reported.\n\nSeveral police officers, including one policewoman, were among those killed, the interior ministry said. The suicide bomber blew himself up after they stopped him from entering the church.\n\nThe first explosion in Tanta, 95km (60 miles) north of Cairo, took place near the altar of the church. It remains unclear if it was also caused by a suicide bomber.\n\n\"I saw pieces of body parts and broken seats. There was so much blood everywhere, some people had half of their bodies missing. The first three rows [inside the church] were destroyed,\" Nabil Nader, an eyewitness, said.\n\nThe explosions injured at least 71 people in Tanta and 35 others in Alexandria, the health ministry said.\n\nThe Copts are one of the most ancient Christian communities and the largest still left in the Middle East. But they have long felt vulnerable and marginalised. This sense of precariousness has only increased in recent years, with the rise of violent jihadism in parts of Egypt.\n\nThe country's political and Muslim religious leaders have tried to provide reassurance that they stand united with the Copts - and have portrayed the recent upsurge in attacks as an attempt by extremists to sow division.\n\nBut in recent months, Coptic families have been fleeing the northern Sinai after a series of murders and assaults.\n\nTheir trust in the state's ability and willingness to protect them will now be even more deeply shaken - as bombs desecrate Palm Sunday, fulfilling a rash of recent threats by the Islamic State group to intensify their violence against Christians in Egypt.\n\nThe Coptic Orthodox Church is the main Christian Church in Egypt. While most Copts live in Egypt, the Church has about a million members outside the country.\n\nCopts believe that their Church dates back to around 50 AD, when the Apostle Mark is said to have visited Egypt. Mark is regarded as the first Pope of Alexandria - the head of their church.\n\nThis makes it one of the earliest Christian groups outside the Holy Land.\n\nThe Church separated from other Christian denominations at the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD) in a dispute over the human and divine nature of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe early Church suffered persecution under the Roman Empire, and there were intermittent persecutions after Egypt became a Muslim country. Many believe that continues to this day.\n\nMore about the Coptic Orthodox Church"
