        "text": "If you’re not visiting with a group and need to get from the airport to the city, as usual in Egypt, a taxi or Uber will your best option. There aren’t set rates and the price will depend on where you go and your bargain skills, but it shouldn’t cost you more than 150 Egyptian pounds (approx. €8).\n\nIf you prefer to use public transport, there are CTA city buses that depart from Terminal 1 and will leave you in downtown Cairo. They cost only 5 Egyptian pounds (approx. €0.25) and the journey takes 75 minutes.\n\nThere are also shuttles that run every 30 minutes and include stops in the Giza area. They cost 35 Egyptian pounds (approx. €2) and the journey takes 45m.\n\nThe city of Cairo originated over 4,000 years ago, 24km southwest of the city in a settlement then called Memphis, when the ruler at the time united Upper and Lower Egypt.\n\nWhat we know today as Cairo was established in the 10th century by the Fatimids, who started constructing many of the landmarks of the city. Cairo became a key part of the east-west spice route, with Khan el-Khalili becoming one of the main centres of trade.\n\nIt was in the 12th century that Saladin, the first Sultan of Egypt, ordered the construction of multiple important buildings, including the Citadel of Saladin. When the Mamaluks took over the city in the 13th century, Cairo became one of the main centres of Islamic learning.\n\nThe city started its decline in the 16th century when it was occupied by the Ottomans, who set Constantinople was their new capital. It wasn’t until the 19th century that Muhammad Ali Pasha founded the modern Egyptian state, building multiple boulevards and plazas inspired by the constructions of Paris.\n\nThe British occupied Egypt from 1882 until its independence in 1922 but kept dominating the country until the Egyptian revolution of 1952. During this time, Cairo became a modern metropolis and the largest city of the Islamic world.\n\nThe country gained worldwide attention in 2011 during the Arab Spring, when millions of protesters gathered in Tahrir Square forcing the dictator Hosni Mubarak to resign. The political situation is still unstable nowadays after a military coup in 2013, but Egypt is slowly recovering and tourists are visiting this fascinating country once again.\n\nI had arrived in Egypt a few hours before my tour officially started, so I had already had some time to enjoy the city of Cairo during my first day Egypt. Unfortunately, my experience wasn’t the best, as my phone stopped working and I couldn’t visit most of the places that I had in mind. However, my Essential Egypt tour included a full day visiting the Egyptian capital, so I still had another chance to see all the highlights that this chaotic place had to offer.\n\nAfter a week visiting different temples and learning about Egyptian history, our first stop was the home of one of the most extensive collections of ancient Egyptian antiquities: the Egyptian Museum of Cairo.\n\nThe current building was built in 1901 by an Italian construction company and has an impressive collection of over 120,000 items. The museum has an entrance fee of 60 Egyptian pounds (approx. €3), and there is an additional ticket of 100 Egyptian pounds (approx. €5) if you want to visit the mummies rooms.\n\nAfter buying our tickets and getting a set of headphones to hear better our guide in the busy interior, we started our journey across thousands of years of Egyptian history.\n\nThe first room in the museum belongs to the Old Kingdom which goes approximately from 2650 to 2100 BC. Known as “the Age of the Pyramids”, the Old Kingdom spanned Dynasties 3 through 8. The capital remained in the Memphis area, where it had been founded during the Early Dynastic Period, and the administration based there became increasingly more centralised. The cult centre of the sun god, Ra, who was extremely important during this era, was located east of Memphis and Heliopolis.\n\nSome of the most important pieces of this exhibition include a Statue of Zoser, found inside the temple to the north of his step Pyramid, as well as the statue of Menkaure, Hathor and a goddess, one of the four triads that were found on the Valley Temple of Menkaure, at Giza. The Diorite statue of King Chephren, builder of the second Pyramid, is also one of the pieces with the best state of preservation.\n\nOne of the highlights of the museum is the statue of Rahotep and his wife Nofret. Rahotep was the High Priest of Heliopolis and the kign’s son, while Nofret was an acquaintance of the king. The vivid feeling conveyed by the two figures, as well as the remarkable preservation of the painted surfaces, make these two statues among the best examples of art that reached perfection and expresses itself with minimum details.\n\nIn that same room, you can find the statue of a scribe sitting crossed-legged, holding an open papyrus-roll soon his knees, as well as a statuette of King Cheops, found in Abydos in 1903.\n\nWe then continued discovering the First Intermediate Period and Middle Kingdom, which expanded from approximately 2100 to 1650 BC. The highlights include the limestone statues portraying King Senosert I.\n\nIn the late Old Kingdom, the authority of the central government began to break down and provincial governments gained in independence. The Memphite rulers remained the normal kings of a united Egypt through Dynasties 7 and 9, but the social order was collapsing. The 1st Intermediate Period was an era of war and turmoil, with local rulers jockeying for power. Without the patronage of a royal centre, art became provincial and the idealised forms of the Old Kingdom were modified by innovative new styles.\n\nThe 11th Dynasty was based at Thebes, current day Luxor, and for several generations shared power with rulers from the north. In 2030 B.C., the Theban ruler Mentuhotep II united the country and inaugurated the Middle Kingdom. Moving the administrative capital back north, these kings tried to recreate and even surpass the glories of the past, and even buried themselves beneath pyramids.\n\nBut the largest and most surprising exhibitions are kept for the New Kingdom, that went from 1650 to 1070 BC. Toward the end of the Middle Kingdom, Western Asiatic people began to settle in the Delta. As the power of the 13th Dynasty waned, more of these foreigners took over Lower Egypt.\n\nThe New Kingdom pharaohs secured Egypt’s borders by reconquering Nubia, which had gained its independence at the end of the Middle Kingdom, and expanding Egypt’s control northward, turning much of Syria-Palestine into vassal states. This immense empire served both to protect the borders of Egypt and to secure its trade routes. The Pharaohs embarked ono extensive building programmes for the glory of the god and king, constructing temples and erecting statues throughout the Nile Valley, and even into upper Nubia.\n\nIn this section, you can visit many of the treasures found in the tomb of Tutankhamun, including his famous mask, impressive wooden coffins where his mummy was placed, as well as an extensive collection of jewellery and artefacts made in gold. The exhibition is truly fascinating, but unfortunately, photography is strictly forbidden inside.\n\nThe Egyptian Museum in Cairo also houses different types of statues of Queen Hatshepsut, including sphinxes and kneeling statues which show the pharaoh presenting offerings to the gods.\n\nHatshepsut is famous for being the first woman to become pharaoh in Egypt. She married her half-brother Thutmose II, heir to the throne. However, he was still very young when his father died, and Hatshepsut crowned herself as king. In art, she is typically represented as a man, wearing full royal regalia.\n\nThe Egyptian Museum includes a room that contains a number of mummies of kings and royal family members of the New Kingdom. It has an additional ticket of 150 Egyptian pounds (approx. €8), which is almost double the price to access the museum itself.\n\nIf you have at least some interest in Egyptian history, I’d say that the room is a must. Going all the way to Egypt and missing the mummies of some of the most important pharaohs in their history would be an absolute pity. Photography is forbidden in this exhibition.\n\nThat said, there are plenty of mummies to see in the museum that are included in the general entrance. In fact, the second floor of the museum is pretty much filled with mummies from different periods of time. There is also a big collection of animal mummies. The Ancient Egyptians mummified animals as well as humans, and there are four different types ono animal mummies: first, pets buried with their owners, second, victual or food mummies that would provide sustenance for the owner through eternity, third, sacred animals, and fourth, votive offerings.\n\nThe most impressive area of the Museum, both for the beautiful architecture and the immense statues located there, is the main hall. Right in the middle, you can find the colossal statue of Amenhotep III and Tiye, a monolith statue of the 18th dynasty. It is the biggest dyad ever built.\n\nI was quite surprised that many of the statues in the main hall were covered in plastic as if the museum was going under renovation, which wasn’t really the case. Overall, I found that many of the items in the museum were kept in very poor conditions, such a pity for such invaluable items! Hopefully, this will change with the construction of the new Egyptian Museum next to the pyramids.\n\nWe spent a good two hours inside the Egyptian Museum before we headed to our next destination, the Coptic neighbourhood of Cairo.\n\nOn the way, we could sight the Cairo Tower. At 187m high, this free-standing concrete tower is the tallest building in the country and one of the most recognisable symbols of the city of Cairo. The tower was designed to remind of a pharaonic lotus plant, the symbol of Ancient Egypt. At the top, you can find an observation deck as well as a rotating restaurant with amazing views of the city.\n\nWe reached Coptic Cairo after about 20 minutes. This name is given to a part of old Cairo known for its Christian tradition, as it was a big stronghold for Christianity in the country until the Islamic expansion. It still houses multiple churches and a big Christian minority. All the main monuments of the neighbourhood are free of charge.\n\nThe first place of interest in Coptic Cairo is the ruins of the Fortress of Babylon, an ancient fortress in the Nile Delta.\n\nBabylon was a settlement in what today is Old Cairo that dates back to the 664 BC. The name was given, according to the Greek geographer Strabo, by some Babylonians who had taken refuge there from ancient Mesopotamia. The settlement occupied a position of great strategic importance at the head of the Nile Valley, as well as at a natural crossing point of the Nile via de island of Roda and the conflux of a number of important east-west trade routes.\n\nIn 112 AD, the Roman emperor Trajan shifted the head of the Red Sea canal to Babylon and built a massive stone harbour around the entrance to the canal. Almost 200 years later, Emperor Diocletian secured this important strategic location by constructing the massive fortress of Babylon. After the Arab Conquest of Egypt in 641, the new capital was founded around the nucleus of this former fortress.\n\nAnother beautiful example of Christian architecture is the Monastery and Church of St. George. This Greek Orthodox church was originally built in the 10th century but the current building belongs to the 20th century, when it was rebuilt after a fire.\n\nContrary to many of the many religious buildings in Coptic Cairo, the Church of St. George still serves as an active church and is currently used as the official seat of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria.\n\nJust next to the fortress you will find the Hanging Church. Founded in the 3rd century, it is one of the oldest churches in Egypt, belonging to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. It has been renovated multiple times, with its façade being constructed in the 13th century.\n\nThe name comes from the fact that it is located right above a gatehouse of Babylon Fortress, with its nave suspended over a passage. Today the hanging effect cannot be appreciated as much as before since the ground level has risen over 9 meters during the centuries due too the accumulation of trash and dust. However, originally the church stood out above its surroundings above the walls of the fortress.\n\nThe church is richly decorated and constitutes one of the most beautiful buildings of Coptic Cairo. The interior, covered in bone and ivory designs, represent the geometric and organic forms that can be found in Islamic art. During my visit, I couldn’t but stare open-mouthed at the detailed design!\n\nLocated 15 minutes away from Coptic Cairo on the Mokattam Hills, the highest area of Cairo, stands the imposing Citadel of Saladin. It has an entrance fee of 50 Egyptian pounds (approx. €2.5)\n\nThe Citadel is the largest fortification the Middle East and North Africa. Constructed in 1176 by the Ottoman leader Saladin, it was used as a defence against the Crusaders. The walls that we can appreciate today are the original construction. In addition to beautiful mosques, the citadel hosts several museums, including the Military and Police Museums, the Islamic Museum and the History of Egypt Museum.\n\nThe most important building in the complex is the Great Mosque of Muhammad Ali Pasha.\n\nWith a dome raising 52 high and two twin minarets of 84 meters, the mosque is one of the most important symbols of Cairo and can be seen from almost anywhere in the city. The inside and outside of the building are decorated with beautiful alabaster, which is why it is also called the Alabaster Mosque.\n\nThe mosque was commissioned in 1830 by Muhammad Ali Pasha, an Ottoman commander that is today considered the founder of modern Egypt. The building only took 14 years to get constructed, but Muhammed Ali did not live to see it completed. His remains were buried on a tomb right next to the entrance of the mosque.\n\nThe Citadel offers incredible panoramic views of Cairo, although they are a bit overshadowed by the huge levels of pollution.\n\nWe next headed to Khan el-Khalili bazaar, one of the main shopping areas of Cairo. I had already visited the bazaar during my first day in Cairo (read my post for more information about the bazaar and surrounding area), but it was a public holiday that day and the area was pretty dead.\n\nMy second visit was completely different; this time all shops were open, with and hundreds of tourist and locals blocking the narrow streets.\n\nIf you’re not interested in shopping, the entire Islamic neighbourhood that surrounds the bazaar has some amazing monuments that are worth a visit. These include the Sultan Qalawun Complex, the Mosque of al-Hakim, Al-Hussein Mosque or Al-Azhar Mosque.\n\nWith the day coming to its end and after spending enough time in Khan el-Khalili bazaar to do some shopping, visiting the area and enjoying a traditional tea, we headed back to the Oasis Pyramid Hotel.\n\nBefore putting an end to our Essential Egypt tour, we were offered an optional visit to see the Light and Sound show at the pyramids. It had a cost of €20, and I decided to go for it.\n\nWe arrived at the end of the day, so I was lucky enough to enjoy an incredible sunset with the Sphinx and the three pyramids on the background.\n\nThe show itself show takes place right in front of the Sphinx, in an open area where they have set up hundreds of chairs. The show is quite touristy and not as impressive as it sounds, it consists of projections over the Sphinx and the pyramids that tell the story of the three pharaohs buried there. The show actually got a bit tedious towards the end, and to be honest, the best part was seeing the sunset.\n\nIf you have some extra time to spend and want to enjoy the beautiful views at sunset, you might enjoy the experience. I don’t regret doing it, but I wouldn’t go again.\n\nUnfortunately, my Essential Egypt tour with Travel Talk had ended. After going back to the hotel and having a few drinks near the swimming pool to say goodbye to each other, as most of the group would be leaving very early the next day. My experience with Travel Talk Tours was beyond fantastic, and if you’re looking for a reputable company to visit Egypt, they are definitely your best choice.\n\nFor me, my time in Egypt hadn’t ended quite yet. I still had a full day before going back home and decided to book a day trip to Alexandria from Cairo with Egypt Day Tours. After having visited so many ancient sites, this modern Mediterranean city was a refreshing change!"
