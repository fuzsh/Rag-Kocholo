The Greek Church of Saint George is a large round church located in the Babylon Fortress of Cairo. It is the seat of the Greek Patriarch of Alexandria.

The Greek Church of Saint George was built in 684 by a wealthy scribe called Athanasius. The present structure was built in 1904. It is connected to the nearby monastery of Saint George. It is believed that Saint George was imprisoned and martyred near the church. It was a Coptic church until the 15th century when it became a Greek orthodox church.

A flight of steps takes visitors to The Greek Church of Saint George. The fa√ßade has a relief of Saint George dressed as a Roman soldier astride an Arabian horse and slaying a dragon carved into the brick wall. The 20th century church still retains the stained glass windows of previous churches and the Qaa el-Arsan wedding chamber that dates back to the 4th century. It has beautifully carved interiors and the dome has a beautiful green ceiling with the image of Christ in the middle. Most of the images depict Saint George fighting for the preservation of Christianity. The nearby monastery is the venue of the largest Coptic Mulid or religious festival celebrated annually on the 23rd of April.
