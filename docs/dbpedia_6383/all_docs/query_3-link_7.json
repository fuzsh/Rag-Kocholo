        "text": "The annual list is based on the Web of Science™ citation index and compiled by the Institute for Scientific Information™ at Clarivate. It identifies researchers from across the globe who demonstrated significant influence in their chosen field or fields through the publication of multiple highly cited papers during the last decade.\n\nThe Sainsbury Laboratory researchers who make the list for 2023 are Professor Jonathan Jones FRS, Professor Sophien Kamoun FRS, and Professor Cyril Zipfel.\n\nProfessor Nick Talbot FRS, Executive Director of The Sainsbury Laboratory, said: “I am very proud to see the research at TSL recognized in the highly cited researcher list. TSL group leaders have been part of this list since its creation, demonstrating the influence and impact of the research that we carry out. This recognition is due to the efforts of our TSL family of postdocs, students, and staff across the institute. I am grateful to all of them for their contributions to this recognition.”\n\nProfessor Jonathan Jones studies how plants resist disease, and how pathogens evade or suppress the detection and resistance mechanisms of their plant hosts.\n\nProfessor Sophien Kamoun studies the interactions between plants and filamentous pathogens, notably the Irish potato famine organism Phytophthora infestans and the rice and wheat blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.\n\nProfessor Cyril Zipfel studies the molecular basis of plant innate immunity and aims to decipher signalling events linking the perception of pathogen-associated molecules to the establishment of immunity.\n\nAnalysts at the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI)™ have recognized 6,849 Highly Cited Researchers in 2023, from more than 1,300 institutions in 67 nations and regions.\n\nThe UK is ranked third overall with 574 highly cited researchers behind the US (2,669) and China (1,275). This is a particularly high number of researchers at the very top of their fields in terms of citation impact, given that the United Kingdom has a population 1/5 the size of the United States and 1/20 the size of Mainland China.\n\nAbout The Sainsbury Laboratory\n\nThe Sainsbury Laboratory (tsl.ac.uk) is an independent research institute that focuses on plant health for a sustainable future. It makes fundamental scientific discoveries in molecular plant-microbe interactions and applies these to reduce crop losses caused by plant diseases, particularly in low-income countries. Around one hundred and twenty staff and students work and study at the Laboratory which is located on the Norwich Research Park, United Kingdom. The Laboratory is generously supported by the Gatsby Charitable Foundation and by the University of East Anglia, wins competitive grants from the BBSRC, ERC and other research grant funding bodies and, for some research programmes, is funded by commercial companies. Established in 1987, highlights of The Sainsbury Laboratory include: discovery of RNA interference in plants by Prof. Sir David Baulcombe FRS as recognised by the Lasker Award and the Wolf Prize in Agriculture, discovery of the first immune receptor in plants by Prof. Jonathan Jones FRS, three current Group Leaders are Fellows of the Royal Society, and five researchers who have been on the Highly Cited Researchers list of top 1% scientists in the world since 2018."
