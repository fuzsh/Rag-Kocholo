        "text": "Previous winners of the Karen Harvey Prize\n\nDana Longcope, 2003\n\nThe 2003 Harvey Prize is awarded to Dana Longcope (Montana State University) for his significant contributions to the study of the Sun's magnetism in the areas of separator reconnection and flux tube physics.\n\nDana Longcope's Harvey Prize lecture (PDF format) delivered at the 2003 SPD meeting.\n\nHarry Warren, 2004\n\nThe 2004 Karen L. Harvey prize is awarded to Harry Warren for his major contributions toward characterizing and understanding the morphology of coronal plasmas, the evolution of solar flares, and the variability of the Sun's extreme ultraviolet irradiance.\n\nHarry Warren's Harvey Prize lecture, delivered at the 2004 SPD meeting, in either:\n\nPowerPoint plus Quick Time and MPEG movie format (tar gzipped, 52 Mbytes), or\n\nQuickTime movie (640 x 480 pixels) format (141 Mbytes).\n\nSarah Gibson, 2005\n\nThe 2005 Karen Harvey Prize is awarded to Sarah Gibson for her research on the role of helical magnetic fields in the structure and dynamics of the solar corona.\n\nSarah Gibson's Harvey Prize lecture, delivered at the 2005 SPD meeting, is available as a PDF file (23 Mbytes), or as PowerPoint files customized for the Mac or the PC (these links take you to directories where the PowerPoint and separate movie files can be downloaded).\n\nSteven R. Cranmer, 2006\n\nThe 2006 Karen Harvey Prize is awarded to Steven R. Cranmer for his major theoretical and observational contributions toward understanding the roles of waves and turbulence in heating and accelerating solar wind plasma.\n\nSteven Cranmer's Harvey Prize lecture, delivered at the 2006 SPD meeting, is available as a Powerpoint file with links to separate movie files.\n\nJiong Qiu, 2007\n\nThe 2007 Karen Harvey Prize is awarded to Dr. Jiong Qiu for her significant contributions to the study of the Sun and its effects on the Earth's climate.\n\nMark G. Linton, 2008\n\nThe 2008 Karen Harvey Prize is awarded to Mark G. Linton for his major contributions to studies of kink-instabilities in delta spots, the interactions of magnetic flux tubes, and patchy reconnection in solar flares.\n\nLaurent Gizon, 2009\n\nThe 2009 Karen Harvey Prize is awarded to Laurent Gizon for his significant contributions and leadership in the development of local helioseismology techniques for the study of the Sun's internal dynamics.\n\nLaurent Gizon's Harvey Prize lecture, delivered at the 2009 SPD meeting, is available as a Powerpoint file and associated movies, and as a tarball of the above.\n\nBrian Welsch, 2010\n\nThe 2010 Karen Harvey Prize is awarded to Brian T. Welsch for his role in the development of correlation techniques to measure velocities at the solar surface.\n\nBrian Welsch's Harvey Prize lecture, delivered at the 2010 SPD meeting, is available as a Powerpoint file and associated movies, and as a tarball of the above.\n\nMattias Rempel, 2011\n\nThe 2011 Karen Harvey Prize is awarded to Mattias Rempel for his groundbreaking work on the structure of sunspots and on flows and magnetic fields in the solar convection zone. His work has brought state-of-the-art numerical methods to bear on these problems.\n\nMattias Rempel's Harvey Prize lecture, delivered at the 2011 SPD meeting, is available as a Powerpoint file and associated movies.\n\nDibyendu Nandy, 2012\n\nThe 2012 Harvey Prize is awarded to Dibyendu Nandi of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata for his advances in the use of kinematic dynamo models to elucidate the typical and atypical solar cycle, and for his outstanding leadership within the solar physics and space climate communities.\n\nDibyendu Nandy's Harvey Prize lecture, delivered at the 2012 SPD meeting, is available as both a Powerpoint and a PDF file.\n\nTibor Torok, 2013\n\nThe 2013 Karen Harvey Prize is awarded to Tibor Torok, for his innovative numerical studies and theoretical analyses of the role of MHD instabilities in the initiation and driving of coronal mass ejections.\n\nTibor Torok's Harvey Prize lecture, delivered at the 2013 SPD meeting, is available as a Keynote file, a PDF file, and a ZIP archive.\n\nAlexis Rouillard, 2014\n\nThe 2014 Karen Harvey Prize is awarded to Alexis Rouillard, for his contributions to heliospheric imaging analysis and, through the combination of modeling and multi-spacecraft remote imaging and in situ observations, his contributions to the understanding of the sources and heliospheric evolution of corotating interaction regions, small scale transients, coronal mass ejections, and solar energetic particle events.\n\nAlexis Rouillard's Harvey Prize lecture, delivered at the 2014 SPD meeting, is available as a PDF file, and several movie files.\n\nJonathan Cirtain, 2015\n\nThe 2015 Karen Harvey Prize is awarded to Jonathan Cirtain for his major contributions to the development of the next generation of solar instrumentation and his studies of the role of magnetic reconnection in the heating of the solar corona.\n\nKatharine Reeves, 2016\n\nThe 2016 SPD Karen Harvey Prize for a significant contribution to the study of the Sun early in a person's professional career is awarded to Katharine K. Reeves (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) for her work elucidating the energetics of solar flares and coronal mass ejections, for her leadership within the multinational Hinode/X-Ray Telescope project, and for her strong role in scientific education and public outreach.\n\nKathy Reeves's Harvey Prize lecture, delivered at the 2016 SPD meeting, is available as a PDF file, and a tar archive of a Keynote presentation that includes several movie files."
