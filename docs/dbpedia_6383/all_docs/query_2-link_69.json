        "text": "Kapnick Prize\n\nThe Kapnick Prize is awarded each year to the most outstanding students graduating with a minor in Business Institutions. To be eligible for the award, you must have done well academically. The selection will also be based on other activities such as extracurricular, research projects or papers relating to Business Institutions.\n\nEarly spring quarter, a selection committee will conduct reviews to identify a set of candidates who meet the requirements. Any student selected for a Kapnick Prize will receive a cash award and a plaque to commemorate the honor.\n\nThe prize is named for Chicago businessman Harvey Kapnick."
