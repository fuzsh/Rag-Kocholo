        "text": "The six 2023 inductees to the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame have been revealed.\n\nThe creators being honored are:\n\nChris Claremont (Uncanny X-Men, New Mutants)\n\nWalt Simonson (Thor, X-Factor)\n\nLouise Simonson (New Mutants, Superman: The Man of Steel)\n\nMarv Wolfman (Tomb of Dracula, Crisis on Infinite Earths)\n\nGeorge Pérez (Crisis on Infinite Earths, The New Teen Titans)(Posthumous award)\n\nBill Griffith (Zippy the Pinhead, Three Rocks)\n\nThe Harvey Awards began in 1988 and were named after Harvey Kurtzman, the cartoonist who created and founded MAD magazine.\n\nChris Claremont said, “I started writing comics for the fun of it. Stayed in comics for the love of it. Still can’t wait to see what an artist will do with my words. I am honored to be inducted into the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame, especially as the reason I went to work for Stan Lee at Marvel as an intern many years ago is because Al Jaffee wouldn’t put me up for an internship at MAD Magazine as he felt it was no place for an innocent like me—MAD, the magazine the spectacular Harvey Kurtzman founded.”\n\n“I was mindblown when I was told I was being inducted into the 2023 Harvey Awards Hall of Fame,” said Marv Wolfman. “Having been a huge fan of Harvey, to get an award in his name is a true honor.”\n\nBill Griffith said, “It’s a great honor to receive an award named for the man who unknowingly set me on the path to cartooning in the mid-1950s when MAD Magazine was my life raft out of suburban Long Island. Not only that, but it looks like him! I had the great pleasure of knowing Harvey, if only slightly. So this feels personal. This year marks the ‘trifecta’ for me, having earlier been inducted into the Eisner Hall of Fame and receiving this year’s coveted Reuben Award. Yow! I am having fun yet!”\n\nThe Harvey Awards Hall of Fame inductees will be recognized at the 35th annual awards ceremony on Friday, October 13, 2023, during New York Comic Con."
