        "text": "Featuring Mary Williams and Michelle Facette\n\nWhen: Tuesday, January 17, 2023, at\n\n08:00 AM PST | 11:00 AM EST | 4:00 PM GMT | 12:00 AM Beijing\n\nAbout this Webinar\n\nIn this one-hour workshop, Dr. Mary Williams and Dr. Michelle Facette will discuss how to effectively and efficiently read a scientific paper. This workshop will cover the structure and components of scientific articles, interpretation of statistical analyses, and a case study using a selected article as an example.\n\nThis webinar is hosted by the 2023 Plantae Fellows Cohorts.\n\nSPEAKERS\n\nMary Williams\n\nMary Williams is Features Editor for The Plant Cell and Plant Physiology, and Principal Investigator of the NSF-funded LEAPS: RCN: ROOT & SHOOT (Rooting Out Oppression Together and SHaring Our Outcomes Transparently). She spent the first half of her professional career as a professor at a small liberal arts college (Harvey Mudd College) during which time she was chair of the ASPB Education Committee. In 2009 she joined the staff at ASPB. She’s active on Twitter and Mastodon as @PlantTeaching, and her greatest joy comes from seeing the spark of recognition when she helps someone understand a difficult concept, whether about photosynthesis or the effects of systemic racism.\n\nMichelle Facette\n\nMichelle Facette is an assistant professor at the Department of Biology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst. The Facette lab studies the cellular mechanisms of asymmetric cell division and stomatal function, primarily using maize as a model, and using a combination of microscopy, protein biochemistry and genetics approaches. Before joining the faculty of U Mass in 2018, she was an assistant professor at University of New Mexico for two years. Previously, she did her PhD work at Stanford University studying plant cell walls, and her postdoc work at UCSD focused on asymmetric cell division. She is active on Twitter as @facette_lab.\n\nMODERATOR\n\nXiaohui Li"
