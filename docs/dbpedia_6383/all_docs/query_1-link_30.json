        "text": "“I am humbled by this recognition,” said Birchler, who is a Curators’ Professor of Biological Sciences in the College of Arts and Science. “It is especially humbling to be associated with Dr. McClintock’s name because I have studied her work for all of my career, and I am still learning from it.”\n\nBirchler is recognized for his studies of gene expression at the gene and chromosome levels in both corn and fruit flies. His research has been at the forefront of understanding how dosage, or copies, of genes work together and sometimes fail. A common example of a change in gene dosage in humans is Down syndrome. Together with Reiner Veitia (University of Paris), Birchler proposed the Gene Balance Hypothesis, which posits selection on proteins involved in regulation in response to changes in dosage. In other work, his lab developed the first synthetic chromosomes in plants as well as a method for microscopically visualizing plant chromosomes, two inventions that have had broad scientific and industrial applications. Of particular relevance to this award, his research has provided novel insights into several of Dr. McClintock’s discoveries, including the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, a phenomenon that can occur during cell division that leads to chromosomal instability."
