        "text": "The American Astronomical Society's Solar Physics Division (AAS/SPD) announces prizewinners\n\nSpringer Nature's journal Solar Physics has traditionally granted personal free access for five years to the winner of the Karen Harvey Prize of the American Astronomical Society Solar Physics Division (AAS/SPD).\n\nDr. Kazunari Shibata of Kyoto University, Japan, is awarded the George Ellery Hale Prize for his outstanding work on the properties and behavior of magnetized solar and astrophysical plasmas.\n\nDr. Shibata’s prodigious work over his distinguished career includes the discovery of jets in the solar atmosphere; the development of original theories and numerical simulations of solar jets, spicules, and mass ejections; and the discovery of super-flares on distant stars. Dr. Shibata’s research embodies more than solar physics and has included studies of stellar magnetic activity and its impact on exoplanets. Dr. Shibata has played a significant role in the Japanese Yohkoh and Hinode solar observing satellites. He currently serves as the Director of the Kwasan and Hida observatories.\n\nThe Hale prize is awarded for outstanding contributions to solar astronomy over an extended period of time and is presented in memory of George Ellery Hale (1868-1938).\n\nDr. Hui Tian of Peking University, China, is awarded the Karen Harvey Prize for his ultraviolet and extreme-ultraviolet observations of the Sun and what they reveal about the dynamics of the solar atmosphere.\n\nDr. Tian’s significant work on small-scale prevalent jets and short-lived ultraviolet bursts has motivated new theories of coronal heating and the solar wind. In addition, his work on sunspot dynamics has significantly improved our understanding of magnetic reconnection inside sunspots. Beyond his research, Dr. Tian has also established a new solar physics group at Peking University. He currently leads his research group there and mentors students ranging from undergraduates to postdoctoral researchers.\n\nThe Harvey Prize recognizes a significant contribution to the study of the Sun early in a person's professional career and honors the memory of Karen L. Harvey (1942-2002)."
