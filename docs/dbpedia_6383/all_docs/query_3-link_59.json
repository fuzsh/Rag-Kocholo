        "text": "Biography\n\nRebecca Mosher is an Associate Professor in the School of Plant Sciences at the University of Arizona. After completing a BS at the University of Arizona, she performed doctoral work in the Program in Genetics and Genomics at Duke University, where she studied transcriptional control of plant immune responses. During graduate work Dr. Mosher discovered the emerging field of epigenetics and decided to pursue postdoctoral work with Sir David Baulcombe, first at the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich, UK and later at the University of Cambridge. During her postdoc, Dr. Mosher investigated the production of small RNAs by RNA Polymerase IV and demonstrated that these tiny transcriptional regulators are highly abundant during seed development. In 2010 Dr. Mosher returned to the University of Arizona, where she started a research group focused on small RNA directed DNA Methylation. Dr. Mosher has been the recipient of several fellowships and awards, including the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, the Marshall-Sherfield Fellowship, the NSF International Research Fellowship, and the Bart Cardon Early Career Teaching Award.\n\nDegrees\n\nPh.D. Genetics and Genomics\n\nDuke University, Durham, North Carolina, United States\n\nB.S. Biochemistry and Molecular and Cellular Biology\n\nThe University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, United States\n\nAwards"
