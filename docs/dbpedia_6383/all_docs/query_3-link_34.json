        "text": "She's received the Ruth Allen Award\n\nProfessor Wenbo Ma at The Sainsbury Laboratory receives esteemed Ruth Allen Award\n\nThe American Phytopathological Society honoured Professor Wenbo Ma, a senior group leader at The Sainsbury Laboratory, with the Ruth Allen Award for her innovative research and outstanding contributions to the field of plant pathology. For this award, they select researchers who have changed, or have the potential to change, the direction of research in the field of plant pathology.\n\nRuth Florence Allen (1879-1963) was the first woman at the University of Wisconsin to earn a PhD in botany and she greatly advanced our knowledge of the plant pathogens, rust fungi. Her surviving heirs created the Ruth Allen Memorial Fund which has been awarding one outstanding researcher every year since 1966.\n\nIt came as no surprise to Wenbo's colleagues at The Sainsbury Laboratory that she was chosen for this prestigious award. Her international reputation in effector biology research preceded her arrival to the Laboratory last year as a senior group leader. She is also one of the pioneers in determining the role of small RNAs in plant immunity against non-viral pathogens. Research in her group offers exciting prospects to enhance disease resistance in crops and help secure more food for our future populations.\n\nProfessor Ma is the second person at The Sainsbury Laboratory to receive this prestigious award, following Professor David Baulcombe who received the Ruth Allen Award while working at the Laboratory in 2002.\n\nWenbo's contributions to the scientific community extend well beyond her outstanding research. During her 15 years as a professor, her laboratory has trained dozens of postdoc fellows, postgraduate students, and undergraduate students.\n\nWenbo feels strongly about mentoring early career scientists:\n\n\"I consider supporting next-generation researchers as my duty and, at the same time, I have thoroughly enjoyed the interactions with these talented young minds and learned a lot from them.\"\n\nWenbo's colleagues at The Sainsbury Laboratory are delighted to celebrate this success with her and look forward to her making many more fundamental discoveries with them in plant health science.\n\nProfessor Wenbo Ma said:\n\n\"I am thrilled and humbled to receive this award. This recognition belongs to all the lab members who I have had the honour to work with. Many thanks to my wonderful colleagues, friends, and collaborators. This award is a motivation for us to make more exciting discoveries at TSL.\"\n\nProfessor Nick Talbot, Executive Director of The Sainsbury Laboratory, said:\n\n\"We are delighted that our senior group leader, Prof Wenbo Ma, received the Ruth Allen Award for her outstanding contributions to plant pathology research. It is fantastic to see Wenbo's innovative research on effector biology, small RNAs in plant immunity, and so many contributions to plant-microbe interactions recognized in this way.\"\n\nHear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour, every hour, on Greatest Hits Radio on DAB, at greatesthitsradio.co.uk, and on the Greatest Hits Radio app."
