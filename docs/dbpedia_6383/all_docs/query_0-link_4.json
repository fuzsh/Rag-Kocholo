        "text": "The awards are for work carried out during the 1990s by Professor Sir David Baulcombe, Professor of Botany at the University of Cambridge who was then in the Sainsbury Laboratory, Norwich. Professor Baulcombe and his group discovered that fragments of genetic material known as RNA play a crucial role in regulating genes.\n\n“For organisms to work properly their genes need to be switched on and off at the right time. We found that short RNA molecules play a key part in this process,” he says.\n\nAs well as providing new opportunities for disease resistance in plants and drug development, gene silencing also offers scientists an elegant tool for studying the functions of genes.\n\nOver the past 15 years the genome has been sequenced in dozens of plants, animals and other organisms; the challenge now is referred to as functional genomics – finding out the function of each of the genes in these genomes.\n\nAccording to Professor Baulcombe: “If we need to know a gene’s function, a good way of studying it is to silence that gene. Being able to switch off genes at will is the key to functional genomics.”\n\nHis research group is now interested in small RNA and epigenetics – changes in gene function that occur without a change in DNA sequence but that can nonetheless be passed from one generation to the next.\n\nAccording to Professor Baulcombe: “DNA sequencing only takes us part of the way - epigenetics and RNA form another layer of information that we need to work on. Our big challenge is to turn this sophisticated molecular biology into real biology, linking molecular understanding to real biological understanding.”\n\nDNA methylation – the introduction of a methyl group to DNA – plays a crucial part in epigenetics, and Professor Baulcombe’s group is seeking to understand how it is affected by RNA.\n\n“RNA can target the introduction of a methyl group to DNA, often leading to gene silencing. The methyl group can be inherited – persisting from one generation to the next – so we’re investigating the way nurture influences nature.\n\n“Plants are good for this kind of work. You can cross a plant with its grandmother without running into ethical issues,” Professor Baulcombe explains.\n\nProfessor Baulcombe was designated Regius Professor of Botany by Her Majesty The Queen on the occasion of Her visit to the University to mark its 800th Anniversary on the 19th November 2009.\n\nProfessor Baulcombe is the first to hold the new position. The new post brings the total number of Regius Professorships at Cambridge to seven. The first Regius Professorships: Civil Law, Divinity, Greek, Hebrew, and Physic were created in 1540 by Henry VIII, and the Professorship of Modern History was created by George I in 1724."
