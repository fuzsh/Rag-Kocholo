Her PhD was in experimental physics at the Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives in Saclay Nuclear Research Centre. As a post-doctoral fellow, she was in Gothenburg, Sweden, and Los Angeles, California, United States. From 1986 to 1995, she was employed at the Saclay Nuclear Research Centre. In 1995 she moved to Lund University, Sweden, becoming professor in 1997. L'Huillier has been a member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences since 2004.\n\nFerenc Krausz, born 17 May 1962, is a Hungarian-Austrian physicist, whose research team has generated and measured the first attosecond light pulse and used it for capturing electrons’ motion inside atoms, marking the birth of attophysics.\n\nKrausz studied theoretical physics at Eötvös Loránd University and electrical engineering at the Technical University of Budapest in Hungary. After his habilitation at the Technical University of Vienna, in Austria, he became professor at the same institute. In 2003 he was appointed director at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching and in 2004 became chair of experimental physics at the Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich. In 2006 he co-founded the Munich-Centre of Advanced Photonics (MAP) and began serving as one of its directors. In 2018, he initiated the Center for Molecular Fingerprinting in Budapest, Hungary, for pursuing the validation of a novel at to second-metrology-based platform for health monitoring.\n\nGiorgio Parisi, born 4 August 1948, is an Italian theoretical physicist, whose research has focused on quantum field theory, statistical mechanics and complex systems.\n\nParisi received his degree from the University of Rome La Sapienza in 1970 under the supervision of Nicola Cabibbo. He was a researcher at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (1971–1981) and a visiting scientist at the Columbia University (1973–1974), Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (1976–1977), and École Normale Supérieure (1977–1978).

From 2018 until 2021 he was the president of the Accademia dei Lincei.\n\nCaroline Dean, born 2 April 1957, is a British plant scientist working at the John Innes Centre. She is focused on understanding the molecular controls used by plants to seasonally judge when to flower. She is specifically interested in vernalisation — the acceleration of flowering in plants by exposure to periods of prolonged cold. This has taken her into conserved mechanisms of co-transcriptional gene regulation and epigenetic switches.\n\nDean was educated at the University of York, where she was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology in 1978 and a PhD. in Biology in 1982. She was elected a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (1999), Fellow of the Royal Society (2004), German Leopoldina Academy (2008), Foreign Member US National Academy of Sciences (2008), Dame Commander of the British Empire (2016).\n\nIn 2015 she was awarded the FEBS/EMBO Women in Science Award, in 2018 the L’Oreal/UNESCO Women in Science European Laureate, and in 2020 she won the Wolf Prize in Agriculture “for pioneering discoveries in flowering time control and epigenetic basis of vernalization.” She has also been on the Life Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize from 2018.\n\nSimon Kirwan Donaldson, born 20 August 1957, is an English mathematician known for his work on the topology of smooth (differentiable) four-dimensional manifolds, Donaldson–Thomas theory, and his contributions to Kähler geometry.\n\nAfter gaining his DPhil degree from Oxford University in 1983, Donaldson was appointed a Junior Research Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. He spent the academic year 1983–84 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and returned to Oxford as Wallis Professor of Mathematics in 1985. After spending one year visiting Stanford University, he moved to Imperial College London in 1998 as Professor of Pure Mathematics. In 2014, he joined the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics at Stony Brook University in New York, United States. From 2014 to 2023, he was a permanent member of the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics at Stony Brook University in New York. He is currently a Professor in Pure Mathematics at Imperial College, London.\n\nJean-François Le Gall, born 15 November 1959, is a French mathematician working in areas of probability theory such as Brownian motion, Lévy processes, superprocesses and their connections with partial differential equations, the Brownian snake, random trees, branching processes, stochastic coalescence and random planar maps.\n\nHe received his Ph.D. in 1982 from Pierre and Marie Curie University (Paris VI) under the supervision of Marc Yor. He is currently professor at the University of Paris-Saclay in Orsay and has been a senior member of the Institut universitaire de France. He was elected to French academy of sciences, December 2013.\n\nLeif Andersson, born 1954, is a Swedish animal geneticist and professor of functional genomics at Uppsala University. Andersson was inducted into the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 2002 and is a foreign member of the National Academy of Sciences (USA). He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2017.\n\nAfter completing his undergraduate degree, Andersson completed his PhD at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. He moved to Uppsala University in 2003. Andersson has pioneered the use of domestic animals as a resource to advance knowledge on genotype-phenotype relationships using genomics. Andersson has explored the domestication of pigs, chicken, rabbits and horses.
