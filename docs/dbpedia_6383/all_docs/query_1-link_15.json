Genes are switched on and off during development and in response to the environment so that biology at molecular, organismal and population levels would be informed by knowledge about gene regulation. It has been the underlying theme throughout my research career. I work on plants but the general concepts and many of the mechanisms are common to all parts of the tree of life and my work has had impact in diverse areas including agriculture and biomedicine.\n\nTo begin with I focused on individual genes but advanced technology and computing now allows analysis of complex gene networks. This embracing of complexity means that molecular biology has moved beyond the phase of ‘stamp collecting’: the naming of parts in a cell. We can now begin to address the question of emergent properties in which cells and organisms are more than the simple sum of their parts so that molecular biology is truly ‘biology’. My group has become interested in epigenetics – the science of how nurture influences nature - and how environmental effects can be transmitted from one generation to the next.\n\nOutside the laboratory I promote the use of plant biotechnology for crop improvement. I raised funds to endow a Professor of Crop Science and to support a new Crop Science Research Laboratory for the University of Cambridge. I am particularly interested in addressing developing country problems and in reducing the environmental impact of crops everywhere. A particular challenge is to ensure equitable use of new technology as part of holistic innovation of agriculture and food production systems.\n\nMain publications\n\nShivaprasad, P.V., Dunn, R., Santos, B.A.C.M., Bassett, A. & Baulcombe, D.C.
