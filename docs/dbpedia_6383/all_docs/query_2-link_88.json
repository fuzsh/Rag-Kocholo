        "text": "The Harvey Awards, which celebrates comic books, will be adding six members to its hall of fame. They will be inducted at New York Comic Con on Oct. 13.\n\nFive of the six inductees are well regarded for their superhero work. They are Marv Wolfman and George Pérez (who is being inducted posthumously), who transformed some of DC’s sidekicks into the fan favorite New Teen Titans; Chris Claremont, who turned the mutant X-Men into a popular franchise; Walt Simonson, who is known for his work on Marvel’s Thor; and Louise Simonson, who co-created the preteen heroes Power Pack.\n\nJohn Lind, a chairman of the Harvey Awards steering committee, noted that these creators have shaped some of the most revered story lines of the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s. Their works “have become the cornerstones of the comic book industry and remain a virtual master class for modern-day creators on how to craft compelling and innovative superhero narratives,” he wrote in an email.\n\nWalt Simonson, reflecting on his time in the industry, said in an interview that his work on Manhunter from 1973-74, with Archie Goodwin, was a sentimental favorite. It was near the beginning of his career and was critically lauded. “When that strip ended, all the editors knew who I was and all the other freelancers knew who I was, and I really never had to go look for work again,” he said."
