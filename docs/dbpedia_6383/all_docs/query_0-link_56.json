RA was a British Conservative politician and statesman known for his leadership of the United Kingdom during the Second World War. Widely regarded as one of the greatest wartime leaders of the century, he served as Prime Minister twice (1940–45 and 1951–55). A noted statesman and orator, Churchill was also an officer in the British Army, a historian, a writer, and an artist. He is the only British prime minister to have received the Nobel Prize in Literature, and was the first person to be made an Honorary Citizen of the United States. The support of Churchill and his family for the Technion has been unwavering. Named the Greatest Briton of all time in a 2002 poll, Churchill is widely regarded as being among the most influential persons in British history. 102 THE CHURCHILL AUDITORIUM STANDS Looking to the future from a vantage point of 1957. Gen. Moshe Dayan, Chief-of-Staff of the Israeli Army, surveys the site of the Technion City to be. In the background, one of the first buildings on the new campus: the Churchill Auditorium. As a new state is born with increased needs for housing, agriculture and jobs, the demand for Technion engineers and skills greatly increased. In 1950, Technion President Shlomo Kaplansky died and was succeeded by General Yaacov Dori, former head of the Hagannah. By this time, the Technion was offering degrees in architecture, civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering and the basic sciences began to flourish as separate departments. They included mathematics, chemistry, physics and mechanics. Agricultural engineering was quickly added to the list. 103 STUDENTS AT EINSTEIN MEMORIAL CEREMONY The entire Technion student body turns out for the Albert Einstein Memorial Exercises held in the courtyard of the Technion (April 19th, 1955) 104 105 SUEZ195“Widening the scope of the Technion’s research activities is an inestimable benefit to the current and future technological development of Israel.” - David Ben-Gurion.

The Department of Chemical Engineering was broadened to include food technology. By 1951, Technion undergraduate Carmel. In the 1950s, the following Studies (1958) later renamed enrollment had grown to 966 students. Faculties were founded: Department Department of Humanities and Arts; As the original campus in central Haifa of Aeronautical Engineering (1953), Faculty of Industrial Engineering and had become too small, Prime Minister later renamed Faculty of Aerospace Management (1958). David Ben-Gurion selected a 300- Engineering; the Faculty of Agricultural acre site on Mount Carmel for a new Engineering (1953); the Faculty of campus.

THE MAIN COURTYARD WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A BUSTLING MIDDLE EASTERN MARKETPLACE, COMPLETE WITH EXOTIC SHOPS, CROWS AND ANIMALS. To many, the 1960s can be summed up as the Vietnam War, hippies, drugs, protests, and rock and roll. Yet it was also the decade in which Jerusalem was finally united, while in Europe, the Berlin Wall separating East from West was erected. As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. made his “I Have a Dream” speech, many at Technion were already mastering the art of making dreams a reality through repeated investments in skills, ingenuity and education. 111 Student choir, under direction of Dalia Atlas, sings for the Board of Governors meeting, 1967. 1965. The new electronic computer is specifically designed for research purposes. The computer has an operating speed of up to 70 microseconds per operation and can store up to 24,000 items in its “memory.” This memory can be augmented by auxiliary memory units, each of which can hold up to three million items.

Einstein encouraged Rosen to fulfill his wish of joining the physics faculty of the Technion. In 1953, after permanently moving to Israel, he joined the Technion, where he became advisor to world- class physicist Prof. Asher Peres, through whom generations of scientific grandchildren of Albert Einstein proliferate at Technion and across the world to this day. 117 HWWAAODTREEKRRSA Prof. Menachem Rebhun, former THE WALL head of the Sherman Environmental 118 Engineering Center, at his water The Kotel or Western Wall of the renovation pilot plant.

There were other tragic events this decade as well, including the deadliest earthquake of the century, the Jonestown massacre, the Munich Olympics massacre, and the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island. Culturally, disco became extremely popular and Star Wars hit theaters. Outreach to thousands of high-school students annually is central to Technion’s drive to bring the brightest and best of Israel’s talent to the Institute to pursue studies in science and technology. 125 HARVEATHLTERUIST LEO HARVEY 1879-1955 Born in Lithuania in 1887, Leo Harvey was the son of a small factory owner in the Vilna ghetto. Threatened with imprisonment because of his political activism, Harvey fled Czarist Russia in 1905, and arrived in Berlin, where he got a job as a toolmaker in a large company. Two years later Harvey immigrated to the US. Possessed of unusual talent and ambition, Leo Harvey initiated the Harvey Machine Company which grew into the global enterprise known as the Harvey Aluminium Company. The Harvey family has shaped world history through its unflinching and applied dedication to the Technion vision. 126 197THE HARVEY PRIZE ON TO THE NOBEL Given without regard to nationality, race or religion, the Yigal Alon.

During the Six Day War of 1967, the Israeli authorities asked the Technion to design a new gas mask for children, and after 50 hours of continuous work, Zawistowski came up with the required solution. Zawistowski said that he had three objectives in mind when he started work: (a) the mask should be simple so that mothers could put it on their children, even in the dark, and without any training, (b) the mask should be made of locally available materials, and (c) that it could be produced immediately in large quantities and without special tools. The new mask is made of a plastic bucket to which a plastic bag is attached. The bucket is placed on the child’s head, while the plastic bag covers the upper part of the body, and is closed at the lower end with a string. To enable the child to look out, a window has been fitted to the bucket. Air is supplied by a simple rubber hang pump which can be operated either by the mother or the child. The air passes through a filter which is built into two empty coffee cans, which enable easy changing of the filters by even untrained parents. The air leaves the mask through a simple rubber one-way valve. Henry Zawistowski watches his 7-year old daughter Ywa place the mask over the head of her 3 year old sister Maya. 139 SMTHCEHEDOICOALL 140 Prime Minister Menachem Begin extends greetings at the dedication of the Rappaport Family Medical Sciences Building in 1979.

It is not a single algorithm, but a whole family of algorithms, stemming from the two algorithms proposed by Jacob Ziv and Abraham Lempel in their landmark papers in 1977 and 1978. Lempel Ziv algorithms are widely used in compression utilities such as gzip, GIF image compression and the V.42 modem standard.

There were also some disasters this decade, including the eruption of Mt.
