        "text": "Prof. Mriganka Sur is Director of the Simons Center for the Social Brain at MIT, which he founded after 15 years as head of MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. He is a pioneer in studying the organization, plasticity and dynamics of the brain’s cerebral cortex using experimental and theoretical approaches. Prof. Sur has discovered fundamental principles by which networks of the cerebral cortex are wired during development and change dynamically during learning. His laboratory has identified gene networks underlying cortical plasticity, and invented high resolution imaging methods for studying cells, synapses and circuits of the intact brain. Sur’s group has demonstrated novel mechanisms underlying disorders of brain development and proposed innovative strategies for treating them.\n\nProf. Sur received a B. Tech. from IIT Kanpur, and a Ph.D. from Vanderbilt University, Nashville. He was named the Distinguished Alumnus Award of IIT-Kanpur also named among its top 50 alumni. Mriganka Sur is an elected Fellow of the Royal Society (UK), the US National Academy of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the World Academy of Sciences, and the Indian National Science Academy.\n\nProf. Anjana Rao is a cellular and molecular biologist. She uses immune cells as well as other types of cells to understand intracellular signaling and gene expression. Prof. Rao's areas of research include signal transduction and gene transcription in immune and other cell types; mechanisms of store-operated calcium entry; mechanisms of action of immunosuppressive drugs; transcriptional mechanisms underlying immune tolerance; chromatin-based mechanisms of gene regulation and cell lineage specification.\n\nAnjana Rao obtained her M.Sc. in Physics from Osmania University in India and went on to obtain a Ph.D. in Biophysics from Harvard University. Following a postdoc at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Prof. Rao joined Harvard Medical School as a Professor of Pathology, a post she held until 2010, when she moved to La Jolla Institute of Immunology. She is also Adjunct Professor of Pharmacology at UC San Diego.Along with her collaborator, Patrick Hogan at La Jolla, Rao founded the company Calcimedica.\n\nProf. Anjana Rao was a member of the Jane Coffin Childs Board of Scientific Advisors, a foundation that supports cancer, for eight years.

She worked at the University of Chicago as a post-doctoral fellow, and then joined the Tata Institute in Mumbai, India as a faculty member in 1999, where she currently serves as the Dean of Graduate Studies. Her research uses genetic ‘knockout’ mice and human embryonic stem cell organoids to explore questions such as: how progenitor cells in the brain know what kind of daughter cell to produce- neuron non-neuronal support cells? How do neurons form the correct connectivity so that we may perceive the world?\n\nTole is committed to public outreach, education, and mentorship and has written several blogs aimed at students and young scientists for www.indiabioscience.org.\n\nFor her “significant contributions to our understanding of how the brain's structure and circuitry are formed in the embryo”, Tole was awarded the Infosys Prize for Life Sciences in 2014.

Haupt Chair in Medical Oncology. His major interests are the identification and study of the key molecular events and growth signaling pathways responsible for the development of human cancers, and the use of this information for the development of mechanism-based therapeutic strategies. Dr. Rosen has played a leading role in the development of inhibitors of tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling and has pioneered the concept that feedback reactivation of parallel signaling pathways is a common cause of adaptive resistance to selective pathway inhibitors.\n\nRecent work from the Rosen laboratory included the elucidation of the mechanism whereby RAF inhibitors are selectively effective in mutant BRAF tumors. These mechanistic studies predicted several of the cellular mechanisms whereby tumors develop resistance to vemurafenib and other selective RAF inhibitors. This work, in addition to other recent studies by the Rosen laboratory on the consequences of relief of negative feedback by oncoprotein inhibitors, has also led to multiple clinical trials of combination therapies at Memorial Sloan-Kettering and other cancer centers in the United States and internationally that have shown promising early results.\n\nDr. Rosen received his undergraduate degree in chemistry from Columbia College and an MD/PhD in Molecular Biology from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

She found that the spontaneous activity of neurons in utero is critical for the formation of precise and orderly neural connections in the central nervous system. Her recent work shows that waves of spontaneous activity in the retina can alter gene expression and the strength of synaptic connections. The Shatz lab discovered that genes of the major histocompatibility (MHC) Class I family are regulated by neural activity, a surprising finding because these genes—HLA genes in humans—are involved in cellular immunity and were previously not thought to be expressed by neurons in the healthy brain. Shatz is exploring a role for these molecules in synaptic plasticity, learning, memory, and neurological disorders. Her research has relevance not only for understanding brain wiring and developmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, but also for understanding how the nervous and immune systems interact.\n\nShatz has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine and the American Philosophical Society.
