        "text": "The American Astronomical Society’s Solar Physics Division (AAS SPD) is proud to announce Prof. Kristopher Klein of the University of Arizona as the esteemed recipient of the 2024 Karen Harvey Prize. Established in May 2002, this prestigious award honors the memory of the late Karen Harvey by recognizing significant contributions in solar physics research made early in a professional career.\n\nProf. Klein, a distinguished member of the Department of Planetary Sciences and the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona, has been selected for his outstanding contributions to our understanding of space plasma turbulence. His innovative work, which includes in situ observations of the solar wind, novel data analysis methods, theoretical frameworks, and simulations, has provided groundbreaking insights into the kinetics of solar wind evolution and the nature of plasma turbulence dissipation.\n\nThe Harvey Prize acknowledges Prof. Klein’s exceptional achievements, which are not limited to research alone. His leadership in the scientific community is exemplified by his recent appointment as Project Scientist for the Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) instrument aboard NASA’s Parker Solar Probe. Additionally, his role as Deputy Principal Investigator of the upcoming NASA HelioSwarm mission highlights his influential presence in the field of solar physics.\n\nThe AAS SPD community is excited to honor Prof. Kristopher Klein for his significant and influential work. His contributions not only advance our understanding of solar phenomena but also inspire the next generation of solar physicists."
