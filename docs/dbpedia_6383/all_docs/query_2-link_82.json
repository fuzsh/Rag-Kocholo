        "text": "Professor Hugh Griffiths of University College London (UCL) was chosen from a number of high calibre candidates from across the world to win the £300k A F Harvey Engineering Research Prize.\n\nHe was chosen due to his outstanding contributions to radar research and his continuing work to make major improvements in bistatic radar and its applications. Professor Griffiths said: “I’m absolutely thrilled. It is an enormous honour to be recognised by one’s peers in this way.Bistatic radar is where the transmitter and receiver are located separately, rather than using a single antenna. This introduces some complications, but also offers some significant advantages, for all sorts of radars. The aim of [my research] is to better understand the behaviour of targets and clutter in bistatic radar, by making experimental measurements and analysing the results. It should help us design better radars – for applications such as air traffic control, geophysical remote sensing and for defence and security.”\n\nProfessor Hugh Griffiths will present at the 2013 A F Harvey Prize Lecture which will be held on 23 May 2013 at IET London: Savoy Place. Find out more about the lecture .\n\nThe ERA Foundation is pleased to be contributing to the sponsorship for this prestigious event."
