Sarah Hreha\n\nThe Gruber Foundation\n\n+1 (203) 432-6231\n\ninfo@gruber.yale.eduOnline Newsroom: www.gruber.yale.edu/news-mediaFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nMolecular Biologists Michael Grunstein and C. David Allis Share $500,000 Gruber Genetics Prize for Their Pioneering Work on Histones and Gene Regulation\n\nMichael Grunstein C. David Allis\n\nMay 11, 2016, New Haven, CT – The 2016 Gruber Genetics Prize will be awarded this year to molecular biologists Michael Grunstein, PhD, of the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), and C. David Allis, PhD, of The Rockefeller University. These two renowned scientists are receiving this prestigious award for their groundbreaking work in identifying the critical role of histones and histone modifications in regulating gene activity. Their discoveries transformed the field of molecular biology and were instrumental in launching the modern study of histones in epigenetics, with broad implications for human health and disease.\n\nThe award will be presented to Grunstein and Allis in Vancouver, Canada, on October 21 at the annual meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics.\n\n“These two remarkable scientists showed us that genetic coding is not determined solely by our inherited DNA, but also by a direct interaction between that DNA and histones, the proteins in cell nuclei around which DNA is tightly bound,” says Huda Zoghbi, Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Baylor College of Medicine and chair of the Selection Advisory Board to the Gruber Genetics Prize. “Not only has this work profoundly changed our understanding of gene regulation, but it has also greatly advanced our knowledge of medical conditions as varied as birth defects, heart disease and cancer.”\n\nFor many years, histones were long considered nothing more than the material that “packages” DNA into structures called nucleosomes, which are the building blocks of the chromatin complex that form chromosomes within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. In the late 1980s, Grunstein demonstrated—for the first time—that histones perform highly specific roles in regulating gene transcription in living cells and that histones themselves are the direct targets of certain transcriptional regulatory proteins. A few years later, Allis and Grunstein identified specific enzymes that add or remove an acetyl chemical group to or from the tail of a histone molecule. These studies highlighted a role for histone acetylation in gene activity. The results of these and other breakthrough discoveries by the two molecular biologists revolutionized the field of molecular genetics, for they demonstrated unequivocally that changes to the histones alter gene activity without affecting the DNA sequence.\n\n“Drs. Grunstein and Allis were scientific pioneers,” says Helen Hobbs, Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute at UT Southwestern and member of the Selection Advisory Board to the Prize. “They have elucidated how biochemical modifications of both histones and DNA impact on expression of genes. It is a great honor to be awarding them the Gruber Genetics Prize.”\n\nAdditional Information\n\nIn addition to the cash award, each recipient will receive a gold laureate pin and a citation that reads:\n\nThe Gruber Foundation proudly presents the 2016 Genetics Prize to Michael Grunstein and David Allis for the discovery of the role of histone proteins and their covalent modification in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression.\n\n* * *\n\nLaureates of the Gruber Genetics Prize:\n\n2015: Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna, for establishing a framework for universal genome editing\n\n2014: Victor Ambros, David Baulcombe, and Gary Ruvkun, for pioneering the study of small non-coding RNA’s, molecules that are recognized as playing a critical role in regulating gene expression\n\n2013: Svante Pääbo, for pioneering the analysis of ancient DNA\n\n2012: Douglas C.
