        "text": "One of the newest members of the University of Massachusetts Medical School faculty has won a prestigious award for the discovery of tiny RNA molecules that control genes, bringing further luster to the school’s reputation for stellar RNA research.\n\nVictor R. Ambros, 54, along with longtime colleague Gary B. Ruvkun, 56, of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and David C. Baulcombe, 56, of the University of Cambridge, England, share the 2008 Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research, an honor called the American equivalent of the Nobel Prize. They will receive the award, to be formally announced today, at a ceremony Sept. 26 in New York.\n\n“The announcement of the Lasker Award is great news for Dr. Ambros, for the University of Massachusetts and for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,” said Gov. Deval L. Patrick. “This very prestigious award illustrates that the University of Massachusetts Medical School has become a global leader in an area of scientific inquiry that has transformed the research landscape and offers so much promise for mankind.”\n\nThe scientists’ seminal work, which stems back to 1993 when Dr. Ambros was at Harvard, is an independent finding, but it is also related to the 1998 revelations about the gene-silencing mechanism called RNA interference. The discovery of that phenomenon earned UMass Medical’s Craig C. Mello and Stanford University School of Medicine’s Andrew Z. Fire the 2006 Nobel Prize in Medicine.\n\nInterest has exploded in RNA, once considered only the messenger for DNA in the cell’s protein-making processes. Dr. Mello and Dr. Fire found out that certain RNAs can switch genes on and off, making the technique invaluable as a research tool alone and promising as a potential weapon against disease. Drs. Ambros, Ruvkun and Baulcombe discovered that short stretches of RNA, later dubbed microRNAs, behave more subtly, fine-tuning genes and proteins, modulating what they do in such critical processes as the development of a growing organism as well as everyday functions of life.\n\nNow biologists, pondering questions from how brain cells work to how cancer grows, wonder if these small RNAs are involved.\n\n“We were lucky enough to be working in an area that ended up revealing a new kind of biology,” said Dr. Ambros, who earned a doctorate in biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. “I tend not to think of the award as an award to a person, but as an award recognizing an enterprise — science — that involves people following their curiosity, working together, also competing and exercising the best and the most powerful aspects of human nature and finding out new things.”\n\nJust as the burgeoning fields of microRNA and RNA interference research overlap, so do the people who have worked on unraveling their mysteries. Dr. Mello recruited Dr. Ambros to come to UMass from Dartmouth Medical School, but Dr. Ambros had been Dr. Mello’s adviser at Harvard when he was a Ph.D. student in cellular and developmental biology. Dr. Ruvkun was on the committee that reviewed Dr. Mello’s thesis. Drs. Ambros and Ruvkun were postdoctoral fellows in the same lab at MIT.\n\n“One of the defining themes of my career has been that I’ve been really fortunate to work with extraordinary mentors and terrific colleagues and co-workers,” Dr. Ambros said. “From time to time, we single out people, or in this case three people, whose work converged and brought about something new.”\n\n“This is kind of a celebration of collaboration,” Dr. Ruvkun said about the Lasker Award.\n\nWhen Drs. Ambros and Ruvkun began exploring animal genetics and development at MIT, they noticed defects in developmental timing. Watching cells divide in worms, they saw that some cells would skip stages of development while others would get stuck at one stage, repeating it over and over. They ultimately identified two genes involved in developmental timing and cloned them, back in the days when cloning was no easy task. It took more than a year to clone the first of these genes, and later when Dr. Ambros started his own lab at Harvard University in 1985, it took more than four years to clone the second one, a feat achieved by Rosalind C. Lee, Dr. Ambros’ wife, co-worker and co-author of scientific papers, and post-doctoral fellow Dr. Rhonda Feinbaum.\n\nThe two genes work together. One was active in early development and the other made that gene fade away when its job was done. If the first one is missing, the animal skips to later stages of development, but if the second one is absent, it gets stuck repeating early stages of development. Although the genes regulate development, they don’t do so by encoding a protein to do the job. Instead they use a tiny stretch of RNA as a regulator. That overturns the canon of genes wielding power only through the proteins they make, based on instructions conveyed by their messenger, RNA.\n\n“It was surprising enough to come across a gene that encoded regulatory RNA, and not protein, and then to find that the RNA was so tiny was astonishing,” Dr. Ambros said.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Ruvkun was working on the other gene in his lab across the Charles River at Harvard Medical School. He had identified all the sequences on the gene that it was repressing, or telling to fade away, so development could progress normally. He and Dr. Ambros agreed to look more closely to see if the sequences of the two genes matched up.\n\n“We both saw it on the same day and called each other up,” Dr. Ambros said. “It was quite thrilling because by reading off the sequences to each other, we could be sure that each one of us was right.”\n\nThey each published groundbreaking papers in the leading journal Cell, telling the whole story in 1993. But their work didn’t garner much attention, likely because they had found the unusual phenomenon only in worms.\n\nShortly after this discovery, Dr. Ambros was denied tenure at Harvard. With characteristic generosity, he doesn’t want people to think too harshly of Harvard. But a Nobel Prize-winner whom Dr. Ambros calls a mentor said Harvard let a great scientist go.\n\n“They lost a potential Nobel laureate because they simply didn’t see in him the potential that he had,” Dr. David Baltimore of the California Institute of Technology said last week. “It’s the nature of a seminal discovery that it’s seminal in retrospect. You can’t know ahead of time.”\n\nAfter leaving Harvard, Dr. Ambros moved his lab to Dartmouth Medical School. By 2000, after Drs. Mello and Fire’s revolutionary paper on RNA interference, Dr. Ruvkun made a dramatic discovery. He found another small RNA that occurred not only in worms but also in vertebrates in exactly the same genetic sequence, meaning a common ancestor of the lowly worm and humans must have had it. Soon, other researchers were turning up examples of the small RNAs, whose name had become microRNAs, including mammals.\n\nLasker Award co-winner Dr. Baulcombe was studying RNA interference in plants. His contribution in 1999 was to explain how microRNAs are related to RNA interference as part of the same phenomenon.\n\nBy that time interest in the field had erupted, Dr. Ruvkun said. Scientific meetings swarm with interest now, Dr. Ruvkun said, where his colleague is a generous leader.\n\n“There are two general types of people who lead. One model is the controlling, hypercritical type, and Victor’s not that at all,” Dr. Ruvkun said. “The other type is the expansive, welcoming exuberant kind. Victor is that.”\n\nDr. Mello, who lured Dr. Ambros to UMass, said he’s fun to work with on the collaborations they’ve started.\n\n“He’s a spark plug,” he said. “He had opportunities in lots of places. We’re very thrilled to get him.”\n\nBefore Dr. Mello asked Dr. Ambros to consider coming to UMass, he had already singled out his work for praise on the morning he and Dr. Fire heard they had won the 2006 Nobel Prize.\n\n“I remember thinking the Nobel committee wasn’t done in the RNA field,” Dr. Mello said. RNA interference and microRNAs “are very connected and yet also independent fields.”\n\nDr. Baltimore, who has been studying microRNAs for five years, wouldn’t make any predictions, but also thinks the work is equally important.\n\n“I certainly think it would be appropriate for the Nobel committee to recognize microRNAs in a separate award,” he said. “I think microRNA is deserving. The Lasker committee has shown that.”\n\nDr. Ambros deflects attention away from himself, preferring to promote science and the collaborative spirit.\n\n“Victor is incredibly humble about his contributions,” Dr. Baltimore said. “He’s just amazed to find himself in this position. He never thought of himself as a world-class scientist. It’s sort of beautiful to watch.”\n\nDr. Baltimore and others are watching UMass Medical School assemble a critical mass of preeminent scientists.\n\n“Particularly with the focus on RNA, you have some of the very best people in the world,” Dr. Baltimore said. “Victor really adds to that.”\n\nContact Elizabeth Cooney by e-mail at ecooney@telegram.com."
