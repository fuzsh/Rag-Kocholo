Dr. Ruvkun’s laboratory identified the first microRNA that is conserved across animal phylogeny, including humans. Thousands of microRNAs have subsequently been discovered. Dr. Ruvkun has also explored how bacterial attacks on animals are surveilled and countermeasures are deployed. Using comparative genomics, his laboratory has been exploring the few hundred genes that are universal to all known life on Earth, inherited from a common ancestor over the\n\npast 3 to 4 billion years. Meteoritic exchange between Earth and Mars may have innoculated both planets with related ancestral organisms, allowing the sophisticated DNA technology of genomics to be marshalled to the detection of life on Mars. To this end, Dr. Ruvkun is collaborating with Chris Carr and Maria Zuber at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on a NASA MATISSE project to engineer a DNA-sequencing instrument that will be deployed to other planets to search for life that is ancestrally related to life on Earth. Dr. Ruvkun is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the NAM, and his honors and awards include the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research (with Victor Ambros and David Baulcombe), the Dan David Prize for Aging Research (with Cynthia Kenyon), the Wolf Prize (with Victor Ambros), the Gruber Prize (with Victor Ambros and David Baulcombe), and the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences. Dr. Ruvkun has a Ph.D. in biophysics from Harvard University. He has served on the National Academies’ Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life and the Committee on Astrobiology and Planetary Science and is currently serving on the planning committee for Searching for Life Across Space and Time: A Workshop.\n\nMARK P.

He has participated in the rewriting of NASA’s policy on program/project management; advised and supported the agency’s independent program/project review process; and has supported the review of various programs and projects. At NASA Headquarters, he served as director of the independent program assessment office, where he was responsible for enabling the independent review of the agency’s programs and projects at life-cycle milestones to ensure the highest probability of mission success. At LaRC, he was initially the deputy director and then the director of the Space Access and Exploration Program Office and had the responsibility for planning, directing, and coordinating the center’s research, technology, and flight programs for advanced aerospace transportation and human/robotic exploration systems. Prior to this, he was the manager of Exploration Programs and led all LaRC space exploration research and development activities supporting the agency’s Aerospace Technology, Human Exploration and Development of Space, and Space Science Enterprises. At the Office of Space Science, he served as program manager for the Discovery Program, and at the Space Station Freedom Program operations, he served as special assistant to the deputy director.
