        "text": "Dr. Adam Kowalski, who is joint faculty at University Colorado Boulder’s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics and National Science Foundation’s National Solar Observatory in Boulder, CO, is awarded the Karen Harvey Prize for his innovative research into stellar flares towards resolving long-standing problems relating to flares on both the Sun and other stars.\n\nDr. Adam Kowalski has made substantial contributions to understanding the response of lower stellar atmospheres to stellar flares using a combination of computer modeling, ground- and space-based observations, and theory. Dr. Kowalski’s research bridges the solar and stellar communities; this cross-cutting approach continues to yield important innovations on long-standing problems relating to flares on both the Sun and other stars. His early career research has advanced the understanding of continuum emission from flares, the interpretation of spectroscopic observations, and the timely subject of exoplanetary habitability."
