        "text": "Background\n\nMuch of my current research follows from the discovery in my Norwich laboratory of a novel type of regulatory RNA – siRNA. Current projects in the laboratory focus on the mechanisms of siRNA-mediated regulation and their influence on natural variation. I am also interested in the influence of siRNA on heritable effects that do not involve changes to the sequence of the genome. Understanding these ‘epigenetic’ effects is central to any discussion about nurture and nature."
