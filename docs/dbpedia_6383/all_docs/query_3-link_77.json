        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe Nobel Prizes awarded in two appropriate science categories (chemistry as well as physiology or medicine) and the peace category since 1901 were studied to evaluate the plant science related research that had received recognition. We also checked the Nobel prize nomination database for the two appropriate science categories to verify the number of scientists (with research reputation on plant-based studies) who were nominated, but were unlucky in the eventual selection process. The focus of this review is research on plant materials in a wider sense (including that of photosynthetic bacteria), that received Nobel prize recognition. Until 2017, Nobel Prizes for research in plant sciences have been awarded 17 times to 20 scientists. Pioneering work on five major research themes, namely, (1) chlorophyll and photosynthesis, (2) elucidation of the structure of vitamins (carotene, thiamin, ascorbic acid and vitamin K), (3) use of radioisotopes for metabolism studies, (4) plant natural product chemistry and (5) plant genetics had received Nobel award recognition so far. For future recognition, Nobel laureates such as Melvin Calvin and Barbara McClintock had opined the worth of interdisciplinary teams with expertise in botany for trend-setting new discoveries in plant science research. We predict that pioneering studies along the line of plants that can grow in a dessert or sea, plants which can be an enriched source of fuel and hydrocarbon-like materials may have potential to be considered for a Nobel Prize for plant science research."
