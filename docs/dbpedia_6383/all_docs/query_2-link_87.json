        "text": "Fanbase Press is thrilled to announce that its Graphic Medicine series, Ripple Effects, has received a 2023 Harvey Award nomination in the Digital Book of the Year category.\n\nRipple Effects is a five-issue comic book series which explores life as a superhero with an invisible illness, specifically type 1 diabetes. The series was inspired by creator/writer/colorist Jordan Hart’s lived experience with an invisible and incurable blood-clotting disease called thrombophilia.\n\nThe series was created, written, and colored by Jordan Hart (Terminarch, Doppelgänger, Emergence), illustrated by Bruno Chiroleu (El Borde, Mara and Samu), flatted by Shane Kadlecik, lettered by Oceano Ransford (Eisner Award-nominated Rikki, The Sequels, Haphaven), and featuring cover art by Justin C. Harder (CLAUS Studios). In addition, the collected trade paperback features a foreword by Matthew Noe (Librarian, Harvard Medical School).\n\nWhat sets this series apart is a positive, person-first representation about life with an invisible illness . . . which just so happens to also include superhuman abilities. But, Ripple Effects isn’t just a story about a character with an incurable disease. It’s also a thrilling and relevant superhero tale that touches on the difficulty of finding a work/life balance, the class struggles and economic inequality experienced by many in our nation, and the desire to help others during trying times.\n\nIn an effort to help readers better empathize with and understand the difficulties of navigating invisible illnesses, every issue of the series features an “Unseen Ripples” essay series written by individuals with invisible disabilities who relate Ripple Effects‘ events to their own lived experience, ranging in topic from paranoid schizophrenia to thrombophilia.\n\nEarlier this year, Ripple Effects was nominated for a 2023 Eisner Award (Best Digital Comic) and the 2023 Excellence in Graphic Literature Awards. The series was included in the American Library Association’s (Graphic Novels and Comics Round Table) 2022 Best Graphic Novels for Adults Reading List and was named the winner for the 25th annual Foreword INDIES Book of the Year Awards in the Graphic Novels & Comics category.\n\nThe series was collected into a printed trade paperback which is available for sale through Fanbase Press and Amazon. The collected digital edition is also available through Hoopla, Comics Plus, and Kindle.\n\nFor more information on Ripple Effects, please visit www.RippleEffectsComic.com or www.fanbasepress.com. Ripple Effects may also be found on Facebook and Twitter, @RippleFXComic.\n\nVOTING FOR THE HARVEY AWARDS\n\nThe 2023 Harvey Awards will be presented on Friday, August 13, 2023, during New York Comic Con. A full list of the 2023 nominees may be found here.\n\nThe Harvey Awards welcome professionals from across the comic book industry to vote on this year’s awards.
