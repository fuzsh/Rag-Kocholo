A Cambridge scientist has won two prestigious Israeli awards for his research in botany.

Sir David Baulcombe is professor of botany at the University of Cambridge and a Royal Society research professor.

He is known as an advocate for genetically-modified food, claiming in December in a article for The Guardian, that GM foods were still a vital part of global food security.

Sir David has received the $100,000 Wolf Prize for agriculture for his research into how plants defend themselves from viral attacks using “gene silencing”.

He is the only Briton out of the seven recipients of the prestigious 2010 Prize, the rest of whom come from Europe and the US.

The award will be presented by Israeli President Shimon Peres in May during a special session of the Knesset.

Sir David also received the $75,000 Harvey Prize for advancements in science and technology.

He will receive the award from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, on the university's campus in Haifa on February 17.

Thirteen of the past winners of the Harvey Prize have gone on to win Nobel Prizes for science.
