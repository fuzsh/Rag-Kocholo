        "text": "(born 1954). While many child stars find their Hollywood careers over as they grow older, American actor Ron Howard proved that one could remain active in the entertainment industry. He used the experience he gained from years of appearing on television and in movies to build a successful career as a director of motion pictures. In 2001 Howard received Academy Awards for his work directing and producing the movie A Beautiful Mind (2001).\n\nRonald William Howard was born on March 1, 1954, in Duncan, Oklahoma. His parents were both involved in show business. His father, Rance, was an actor and director of plays, and his mother, Jean, was an actress. Ronny, as Howard was known at the time, was cast in minor parts on stage, screen, and television as a toddler. At age 6 he became known to audiences as Sheriff Andy Taylor’s son, Opie, on the television series The Andy Griffith Show (1960–68). During the show’s off-seasons he appeared in films such as The Music Man (1962) and The Courtship of Eddie’s Father (1963).\n\nHoward knew from an early age that he wanted to be a director. Following high school graduation in 1972, he enrolled in the film program at the University of Southern California. He also continued to act, notably in the film American Graffiti (1973). From 1974 to 1980, Howard starred on the highly successful sitcom Happy Days as Richie Cunningham—a likable, all-American boy living in a middle-class family in the 1950s.\n\nHoward began making his move to the other side of the camera in 1977 with the release of Grand Theft Auto, which he directed and coauthored. He directed various television projects for NBC in the early 1980s before directing a string of successful films, including Night Shift (1982), Splash (1984), Cocoon (1985), and Parenthood (1989). In 1986 he formed a film and television production company, Imagine Entertainment, with business partner Brian Grazer.\n\nHoward continued to make a name for himself in the 1990s, most notably for directing Apollo 13 (1995)—a film about the near-disastrous moon mission of April 1970. The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards, and Howard was honored by the Directors Guild of America. Other feature films he directed during the decade include Backdraft (1991), Ransom (1996), and Edtv (1999). He wrote, directed, and produced the Tom Cruise film Far and Away (1992). As coproducer, Howard earned an Emmy when From the Earth to the Moon (1998) was chosen as that year’s outstanding television miniseries.\n\nHow the Grinch Stole Christmas, an adaptation of the Dr. Seuss story that Howard produced and directed, was the top-grossing film of 2000. Howard earned an Academy Award for directing A Beautiful Mind, a movie about Nobel-prizewinning mathematician John F. Nash and his battle with a mental illness. As coproducers, Howard and Grazer also received Oscars when the film was chosen as the year’s best picture. The two also were the inaugural recipients of the Awareness award from the National Mental Health Awareness Campaign."
