        "text": "Ron Howard turns 68 today. The prolific Oscar-winner’s films have earned him widespread acclaim as one of Hollywood’s most productive and beloved filmmakers.\n\nHoward’s next film “Thirteen Lives,” based on the 2018 Tham Luang cave rescue, opens in theaters later this year.\n\nTo wish the Oklahoma-born actor/director a happy birthday, we’ll share our 10 favorite films of his as a filmmaker, with all due respect to acting work in “American Graffiti,” “The Andy Griffith Show” and “Happy Days.”\n\nMore Top 10 Lists: Denzel Washington’s 10 best movies ranked\n\nKevin Costner’s 10 best movies ranked\n\nTom Hanks’ 10 best movies ranked\n\nRead our picks and honorable mentions below:\n\n10) Rush (2013)\n\nThe most recent release on this list saw Howard evolving with fast-paced filmmaking, in part because of the subject matter and his new leading man in Chris Hemsworth. The film depicts heated1970s rivalry between Formula One rivals James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl). Featuring top-notch performancs and thrilling racing sequences, it only further confirmed Howard as one of the industry’s go-to studio hands.\n\n9) Willow (1988)\n\nA young farmer is chosen to undertake a perilous journey in order to protect a special baby from an evil queen in this enjoyable fantasy (co-written by George Lucas!) featuring outstanding makeup, visual effects and action, paving the way for similar films like the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy.\n\n8) Splash (1984)\n\nIn the film that helped make Tom Hanks a household name for the rest of his life, he plays a young man reunited with a mermaid (Daryl Hannah) who saved him from drowning as a boy, predictably falling in love with her without fully understanding who or what she is. Breezy blend of fantasy and rom-com sees Hanks in his natural state, with hilarious comedic turns from John Candy and Eugene Levy.\n\n7) Far and Away (1992)\n\nThen a real-life couple, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman starred as a young Irish couple who flee to the U.S. before struggling to obtain land and prosper freely. Underrated historical epic features superb period detail in sets and costumes and dependable chemistry from the leads. A wobbly Irish accent from Cruise doesn’t distract from Howard’s handle on the material, down to the thrilling land rush sequence.\n\nRELATED: Tom Cruise’s 10 best movies\n\n6) Cocoon (1985)\n\nA group of trespassing seniors swim in a pool containing alien cocoons and soon find themselves energized with youthful vigor in this wily fantasy starring Don Ameche, Wilford Brimley and Hume Cronyn. Winner of two Oscar including best supporting actor (Ameche) and visual effects. Somewhat of a punchline now to some, particularly in reference to Brimley’s age during filming compared to today’s stars matching it, but a wistful adventure that keeps you young at heart.\n\n5) Backdraft (1991)\n\nChicago firefighter brothers who don’t get along must work together to stop a dangerous arsonist on the loose in this explosive thriller featuring a superb ensemble cast and truly amazing visual effects. Kurt Russell delivers a dynamite performances surrounded by William Baldwin, Robert De Niro, Scott Glenn, Donald Sutherland, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Rebecca De Mornay. The firefighting sequences are worth the watch alone.\n\n4) Ransom (1996)\n\nMel Gibson stars as a distressed millionaire whose son is kidnapped, turning the ransom money into a bounty when he senses the perpetrators won’t comply. An unsettling but effective drama propelled by Gibson and his co-stars Rene Russo, Gary Sinise and Delroy Lindo, plus James Horner’s musical score.\n\n3) Parenthood (1989)\n\nA Midwestern family deals estranged relatives, raising children, pressures of the job and learning to be a good parent and spouse in Howard’s underrated dramedy starring Steve Martin, Tom Hulce, Rick Moranis, Martha Plimpton, Keanu Reeves, Jason Robards, Mary Steenburgen and Dianne Wiest. More serious than you might expect given the comedic leads, but they prove up to the task of exploring adult themes thoughtfully albeit with some needed levity.\n\n2) Cinderella Man (2005)\n\nOne of Howard’s best movies (and one of the best boxing movies to date), this Depression Era tale tells the true story of heavyweight boxing champion James J. Braddock, here played by Russell Crowe. A winning sports drama thanks to the amazing real-life story, beautifully photographed boxing action and terrific lead performance from Crowe.\n\n1) Apollo 13 (1995)\n\nHoward’s reverent historical drama about NASA’s effort to devise a strategy to return Apollo 13 to Earth safely after the spacecraft undergoes massive internal damage putting the lives of the three astronauts on board in jeopardy. A terrific ensemble cast led by Tom Hanks carries this idealistic look at the space program’s contribution to scientific advancement as well as its commitment to putting saving American lives ahead of making history. Remarkable filmmaking in every sense."
