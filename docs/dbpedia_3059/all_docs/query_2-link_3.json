        "text": "Ron Howard (born March 1, 1954, Duncan, Oklahoma, U.S.) is an American filmmaker who first achieved fame as a child actor and later became a respected director.\n\nHoward’s parents were in show business, and he made his first screen appearance, in Frontier Woman (1955), when he was 18 months old. His first onstage appearance came at age two in a summer-stock production of The Seven Year Itch, and, as Ronny Howard, he soon was appearing on various television series, including Playhouse 90, General Electric Theatre, The Danny Thomas Show, The Fugitive, and Dr. Kildare, as well as in the film The Journey (1959).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nIn 1960 Howard began portraying one of his best-known characters, Opie Taylor, on The Andy Griffith Show, which ran for eight years. He was also featured in such films as The Music Man (1962), The Courtship of Eddie’s Father (1963), and The Wild Country (1971) and made numerous appearances in television series episodes. In 1973 Howard experienced his first big film hit, American Graffiti, and the following year saw the beginning of another of his best-known characters, Richie Cunningham, on the series Happy Days, which ran until 1980.\n\nHoward had already developed an interest in directing, however, and after high school he spent two years in the University of Southern California’s film program. In 1977 he made his directorial debut with Grand Theft Auto, and its financial success led to further opportunities. Among his early hits were a series of comedies that included Night Shift (1982), which centered on two morgue employees (played by Henry Winkler and Michael Keaton) who turn their workplace into an escort service; Splash (1984), an unconventional romance between a man (played by Tom Hanks) and a mermaid (Daryl Hannah); and Parenthood (1989). In Apollo 13 (1995) Howard re-created the spacecraft’s 1970 flight that nearly ended in disaster. The film was both a critical and a commercial success.\n\nAfter the film adaptation of Dr. Seuss’s How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000), Howard directed A Beautiful Mind (2001), a biopic about Nobel Prize-winning mathematical genius John Nash (Russell Crowe) and his struggle with schizophrenia. The critically acclaimed film earned Howard an Academy Award for best director and was named best picture. Howard’s subsequent films included Cinderella Man (2005), which was based on the Depression-era boxer James Braddock (Russell Crowe), and The Da Vinci Code (2006), a film adaptation of Dan Brown’s best-selling thriller featuring symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks); Howard later directed other installments in the Langdon series: Angels & Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016).\n\nIn 2008 Howard directed Frost/Nixon, about the interviews between British television personality David Frost and U.S. Pres. Richard M. Nixon after the latter resigned from office. His efforts earned him an Academy Award nomination for best director. In 2011 Howard returned to comedy with The Dilemma, about a man who discovers that his best friend’s wife has been unfaithful. The Formula One race-car drama Rush (2013) centers on the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Howard then dramatized the 1820 whaling disaster on which Herman Melville’s 1851 novel Moby Dick was based in In the Heart of the Sea (2015). He next directed Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), an installment in the popular sci-fi series. Hillbilly Elegy, an adaption of J.D. Vance’s best-selling memoir, was released on Netflix in 2020. The drama Thirteen Lives (2022) is a retelling of the real-life rescue of a youth football (soccer) team from an underground cave.\n\nHoward directed several documentaries focusing on various aspects of the music industry, including Made in America (2013), which documents a music festival organized by rapper Jay-Z and beer producer Budweiser. The Beatles: Eight Days a Week—The Touring Years (2016) recounts the band’s 250 concerts, while Pavarotti (2019) chronicles the life and career of the prolific opera singer. In 2020 Howard helmed the documentary Rebuilding Paradise, about a California town’s efforts to rebuild after a wildfire caused massive damage. We Feed People (2022) centers on Spanish chef José Andrés and his efforts to provide healthy food to those impacted by natural disasters."
