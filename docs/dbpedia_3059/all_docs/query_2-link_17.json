        "text": "Ron Howard (born March 1, 1954)[1] is an American film and television director, producer, writer, and actor. In 2017, after the firing of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller,[2] Howard was tapped to be the new director of Solo: A Star Wars Story.[3]\n\nHoward first gained fame as Opie Taylor, son of Sheriff Andy Taylor, on The Andy Griffith Show. He later starred on Happy Days. He became a filmmaker and has directed such hit films as Apollo 13, The Da Vinci Code, and Rush. He also directed A Beautiful Mind, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Director.\n\nHe has had a long association with Lucasfilm, beginning with his starring role in George Lucas's second film, American Graffiti (1973). He reprised the role in More American Graffiti (1979) and was later chosen by Lucas to direct the fantasy film Willow (1988).\n\nBiography[]\n\nHoward was approached by Lucas to direct Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, but turned it down as he deemed the offer too daunting.[4]\n\nIn 2005, he wrote the foreword for The Cinema of George Lucas.[5]\n\nHoward has also contributed to StarWars.com by reprising his role as narrator on Arrested Development with a parody video modeled on the TV show.[6]\n\nSources[]\n\nThe Star Wars Album\n\nStar Wars Insider 1\n\nStar Wars Insider 2\n\nStar Wars Insider 3\n\n\"Warwick Davis: An Unlikely Hero\" — The Lucasfilm Fan Club Magazine 4\n\n\"Inside ILM: Creating the Magic of Willow\" — The Lucasfilm Fan Club Magazine 4\n\n\"Warwick Davis: An Unlikely Hero, Part Two\" — The Lucasfilm Fan Club Magazine 5\n\n\"George Lucas: The Force Behind Lucasfilm\" — The Lucasfilm Fan Club Magazine 6\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide\n\n\"Launchpad\" — Star Wars Insider 199\n\n\"Star Wars: The Mandalorian Season One Companion\" — Star Wars Insider 201\n\n\"Launchpad\" — Star Wars Insider 213\n\nNotes and references[]\n\n[]\n\nRon Howard on Wikipedia"
