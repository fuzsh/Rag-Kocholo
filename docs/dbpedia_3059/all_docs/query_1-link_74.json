        "text": "Grand Theft Auto (April 27/11)\n\nRon Howard's directorial debut, Grand Theft Auto follows young lovers Sam (Howard) and Paula (Nancy Morgan) as they decide to elope after her parents demand that she marry a wealthy scion (Paul Linke's Collins Hedgeworth) - with the couple's decision to steal her father's Rolls Royce triggering a cross-country chase as they're subsequently pursued by dozens of oddball characters (including Rance Howard's Ned and Clint Howard's Ace). It's a thin premise that's employed to watchable yet far-from-engrossing effect by Howard, as the first-time filmmaker's ongoing emphasis on pursuit sequences inevitably lends the proceedings a decidedly monotonous quality - with the novelty of the over-the-top chases wearing off in as demonstrable and firm a manner as one might've feared. There's little doubt that Grand Theft Auto's affable atmosphere is, as a result, due primarily to the efforts of the film's stars, with Howard's effortlessly charismatic performance ensuring that the viewer can't help but root for Sam and Paula's success. (The palpable chemistry between Howard and Morgan certainly plays an instrumental role in perpetuating this feel.) By the time the frenetic and excessive demolition derby finale rolls around, however, Grand Theft Auto has cemented its place as a passable debut that runs out of steam long before it reaches its crowd-pleasing conclusion.\n\nout of\n\nCotton Candy\n\nRon Howard's Skyward (October 24/16)\n\nAn early, made-for-television effort from Ron Howard, Ron Howard's Skyward follows wheelchair-bound high-schooler Julie Ward (Suzy Gilstrap) as she discovers a passion for flying after a surreptitious trip to a nearby airfield. It's subsequently not long before Julie is receiving airborne lessons from a local flight instructor named Billie Dupree (Bette Davis), with the narrative also detailing Julie's growing friendship with an affable fellow student (Ben Marley's Scott Billings) and said airfield's affable mechanic (Howard Hesseman's Koup Trenton). The early part of Ron Howard's Skyward, though, details the various indignities experienced by Gilstrap's character, as Julie is, for example, embarrassed by her new teacher and unable to use the non-accessible girl's bathroom. It's fairly tedious stuff that's compounded by a lack of narrative momentum and an almost aggressively deliberate pace, with, in terms of the latter, the movie's slowness ultimately preventing the viewer from working up any interest in (or enthusiasm for) the protagonist's feel-good antics. The eye-rolling predictability of Nancy Sackett's screenplay exacerbates the movie's less-than-watchable atmosphere, as there's virtually nothing that occurs within Ron Howard's Skyward that one doesn't see coming from miles away (eg Julie's parents forbid her from flying, Julie fights with Scott, etc, etc) - which ultimately prevents the finale from packing the uplifting, emotional punch that Howard is obviously striving for.\n\nout of\n\nThrough the Magic Pyramid\n\nNight Shift (October 27/16)\n\nRon Howard's first bona fide hit, Night Shift follows morgue attendant Chuck Lumley (Henry Winkler) as he's convinced to start operating a brothel out of his workplace by flashy new coworker Bill Blazejowski (Michael Keaton) - with complications ensue as the mild-mannered Chuck finds himself falling for one of his prostitutes (Shelley Long's Belinda Keaton). It's a unique premise that's employed to affable (if entirely forgettable) effect by director Howard, as the filmmaker, working from a script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, does an effective job of initially establishing the movie's seedy, New York City-landscape and assortment of oddball characters. It's clear early on that Night Shift benefits heavily from Keaton's star-making turn as the excitable, impetuous Blazejowski, and it's ultimately impossible to deny that the movie suffers during stretches when Keaton's character is offscreen (which occurs more and more as the movie approaches its inevitable conclusion). There is, as such, little doubt that the film takes a serious dive in its increasingly underwhelming third act, with Ganz and Mandel's script emphasizing elements that couldn't possibly be less interesting - including Chuck's decision to break away from both Long and Keaton's respective characters (ie it's a twist on the dreaded fake break-up cliche). Night Shift's obvious overlength ultimately prevents it from becoming the briskly-paced, easygoing comedy that Howard is clearly striving for, which is a shame, really, given that the movie is actually quite engaging and entertaining in its breezy first half - with the three stars, Keaton especially, heightening the decidedly affable atmosphere with impressive ease.\n\nout of\n\nSplash (March 21/04)\n\nout of\n\nCocoon\n\nGung Ho\n\nWillow (January 3/18)\n\nBased on a story by George Lucas, Willow follows Warwick Davis' title character as he reluctantly agrees to help protect a baby from an evil ruler (Jean Marsh's Queen Bavmorda) - with Willow eventually receiving assistance in the form of a charming scoundrel named Madmartigan (Val Kilmer). Director Ron Howard delivers an admittedly appealing opening stretch that effectively establishes Willow's fantastical world and raft of quirky characters, with, in terms of the latter, the movie certainly benefiting from Davis and Kilmer's thoroughly charming and affable work as the disparate protagonists (and it doesn't hurt, either, that the chemistry between the two couldn't be more solid). The episodic bent of Bob Dolman's screenplay does pave the way for a somewhat hit-and-miss midsection, however, although the inclusion of several impressively exciting sequences generally compensates for the erratic vibe. (There is, for example, a thoroughly thrilling horse-and-buggy chase that feels as though it's been pulled directly from the Indiana Jones series.) It's disappointing to note, then, that Willow, which runs a palpably overlong 126 minutes, suffers from a frenetic climax that's more exhausting than anything else, and the film, as a result, palpably peters out long before it reaches its predictably upbeat conclusion - which finally does confirm Willow's place as a decent fantasy epic that never quite lives up to the promise of its engaging first act.\n\nout of\n\nParenthood\n\nBackdraft (November 21/16)\n\nBackdraft follows newly-minted firefighter Brian McCaffrey as he attempts to prove himself to his older brother (and experienced fireman) Stephen (Kurt Russell), with the movie eventually detailing the protagonists' efforts at identifying and stopping a deadly arsonist with an apparent grudge against the city. It's ultimately clear that Backdraft, which runs a hopelessly overlong 137 minutes, comes off as a top-notch thriller trapped within a poorly-paced and needlessly bloated piece of work, which is a shame, certainly, given that director Ron Howard has packed the proceedings with a number of above-average elements - including impressively staged-and-conceived fire sequences and a raft of better-than-average supporting performances. (The movie, in terms of the latter, boasts strong work by, among others, Robert De Niro, Scott Glenn, and Donald Sutherland, with the latter especially riveting as an aging pyromaniac.) The episodic bent of the film's first half - much of the narrative seems to follow the central characters as they fight one fire after another - does test the viewer's patience to a fairly demonstrable degree, and it's clear that Backdraft, by and large, works best when focused on the rivalry and relationship between the central figures (and how it ultimately affects their respective work). By the time the somewhat protracted climax rolls around, Backdraft has firmly confirmed its place as a mild disappointment from an otherwise consistent filmmaker.\n\nout of\n\nFar and Away\n\nThe Paper (December 9/13)\n\nDirected by Ron Howard, The Paper follows tabloid editor Henry Hackett (Michael Keaton) as he's faced with a variety of personal and professional problems over the course of one very long, very eventful day. It's clear right away that The Paper benefits substantially from Keaton's typically stellar turn as the central character, with the actor's charismatic performance perpetuating (and heightening) the film's compulsively watchable atmosphere on a continuing basis. (There's little doubt, too, that the stellar supporting cast, which includes Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Randy Quaid, plays a pivotal role in confirming the film's success.) Filmmaker Howard employs a brisk pace that's certainly an ideal match for David and Stephen Koepp's lightning-quick screenplay, and it's worth noting, as well, that the scripters have infused the narrative with an authenticity that generally proves impossible to resist. (The film's staff-meeting sequences are an especially apt example of this, as such moments boast a lived-in, fly-on-the-wall feel that's nothing short of mesmerizing.) The Paper remains completely engrossing right up until its final half hour, with the climax perhaps just a little too frenetic and overblown for its own good (ie there's just too much happening here) - which ultimately cements the movie's place as a very entertaining, unapologetically ludicrous, and somewhat overlong effort from filmmaker Howard.\n\nout of\n\nApollo 13\n\nRansom (November 19/17)\n\nA seriously stellar thriller, Ransom follows Mel Gibson's Tom Mullen as he and his wife (Rene Russo's Kate) attempt to negotiate the return of their son (Brawley Nolte's Sean) after he's kidnapped - with the story also detailing the exploits of the abductors and the dedicated cop (Delroy Lindo's Lonnie Hawkins) working the case. Filmmaker Ron Howard delivers a deliberately-paced yet often engrossing narrative that's rife with electrifying sequences (eg the now-iconic \"give me back my son!\" scene, etc), and there's little doubt that the movie benefits substantially from its roster of above-average performances - with Gibson's ferocious and emotional turn mirrored by a strong supporting cast that includes Gary Sinise, Donnie Wahlberg, and Lili Taylor. Howard, working from a script by Richard Price and Alexander Ignon, does a superb job of slowly-but-surely tightening the screws as the storyline unfolds, with the inherent intensity of the premise paving the way for a midsection that's as gripping as one might've hoped. It's clear, too, that a strong twist at around the halfway mark effectively upends expectations and provides a palpable jolt of energy, and although the movie does begin to partially drag in its second half (ie this is not a story that needs to be told in 121 minutes), Ransom rebounds for an impressively captivating (and action-packed) finale that ensures it ends on as positive a note as one could envision - which certainly does confirm the film's place as one of Ron Howard's very best efforts (if not the best, really).\n\nout of\n\nEd tv (November 4/14)\n\nEd tv casts Matthew McConaughey as Ed Pekurny, an affable everyman whose life changes dramatically after he's cast as the star of a 24 hour television program documenting his every move - with Ed's newfound notoriety increasing substantially after he begins dating his brother's girlfriend (Jenna Elfman's Shari). It's a fine premise that's utilized to progressively underwhelming effect by filmmaker Ron Howard, as the movie, scripted by Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz, grows more and more hackneyed and predictable as it progresses - with the emphasis shifting from Ed's experiences on the title television show to a series of almost eye-rollingly heavy-handed incidents (eg an evil executive attempts to blackmail Ed into fulfilling his contract). Before it gets to that point, however, Ed tv comes off as a fairly affable comedy that benefits substantially from McConaughey's charismatic turn as the central character - with the actor's strong work heightened by an impressive roster of supporting players (including Woody Harrelson, Martin Landau, and Dennis Hopper). The movie also boasts an appealing romance between McConaughey and Elfman's respective characters, although even this aspect of the proceedings ultimately wears out its welcome (ie the pair's relationship has been saddled with all the anticipated romcom beats and developments). It's finally impossible to label Ed tv as anything more than a sporadically effective yet predominantly misguided satire, with the movie, for the most part, paling in comparison to the similarly-themed Truman Show.\n\nout of\n\nout of\n\nAngels & Demons (May 13/09)\n\nThough undoubtedly a minor improvement over its underwhelming predecessor, 2006's The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons is nevertheless unable to replicate the propulsive, downright enthralling sensibilities of Dan Brown's first Robert Langdon adventure. And while it'd be easy to pin the blame for the movie's ineffectiveness on the almost unreasonable amount of changes made to Brown's novel, it's ultimately clear that Ron Howard's egregiously solemn directorial choices remain the most obvious deficiency within this ongoing series - as the filmmaker is either unable or unwilling to infuse the proceedings with the fun, fast-paced atmosphere demanded by the source material. The movie follows Tom Hanks' intrepid symbologist as he races to prevent the fabled Illuminati from executing four Cardinals and blowing up the Vatican, with his efforts aided by a fiery physicist (Ayelet Zurer's Vittoria Vetra) and a helpful papal official (Ewan McGregor's Patrick McKenna). It's an unapologetically over-the-top premise that, although employed to exceedingly entertaining effect within the book, inevitably results in a middling cinematic endeavor, as Howard - working from a script by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman - emphasizes a consistent tone of reverence that proves an incongruous match with the comparatively light-hearted nature of Brown's eponymous bestseller. The relentless stream of exposition that dominates Angels & Demons' opening half hour certainly contributes heavily to the stagnant vibe, with the baffling absence of several of the novel's most exciting sequences - ie Langdon's battle with an unnamed assassin within Rome's famed Fountain of the Four Rivers, Langdon's perilous efforts at rescuing Vittoria from the clutches of said assassin, etc, etc - undoubtedly exacerbating the pacing problems that persist virtually from start to finish. And although supporting players Zurer and McGregor ably step into their respective roles, Hanks' atypically charmless work as the central character remains an emblematic example of everything that's wrong with this series (ie the movie's resemblance to an Oscar-time prestige picture goes against the intent of Brown's books). The exhilarating third act does ensure that Angels & Demons ends on a positive note, admittedly, yet it remains abundantly clear that the film simply isn't as pervasively engrossing as one might've hoped.\n\nout of\n\nThe Dilemma (May 1/11)\n\nTrue to its title, The Dilemma follows Ronny Valentine (Vince Vaughn) as he struggles to tell his best friend Nick (Kevin James) that his wife (Winona Ryder's Geneva) is cheating on him - with problems ensuing as Ronny's increasingly convoluted web of lies begins to threaten his relationship with Jennifer Connelly's Beth. There's little doubt that The Dilemma fares best in its opening half hour, as filmmaker Ron Howard, working from Allan Loeb's screenplay, does a nice job of initially establishing the various characters and their relationships with one another - which effectively ensures that the movie's leisurely pace is, at the outset, not as problematic as one might've feared. It's only as the film progresses into its increasingly uneven midsection that one's interest begins to wane, with the almost excessive familiarity of the storyline resulting in plot twists of a decidedly predictable variety (eg Connelly's character begins to suspect that gambling addict Ronny is up to his old tricks). Howard's curiously deliberate sensibilities inevitably wreak havoc on The Dilemma's momentum, as the director's difficulties in sustaining a consistent tone ultimately ensure that the movie works neither as a comedy nor as a drama (eg it's not funny enough for the former or emotional enough for the latter). The inclusion of a few admittedly energetic interludes - eg Ronny confronts Geneva's tattooed, high-on-oxycontin boyfriend (Channing Tatum's Zip) - goes a long way towards sustaining the film's watchable atmosphere, yet it's hard to deny that the whole thing is, in the final analysis, far too sedate and uneven to make a wholeheartedly positive impact on the viewer.\n\nout of\n\nRush (November 6/13)\n\nInspired by true events, Rush details the rivalry between '70s Formula One drivers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) - with the film exploring the characters' exploits in both their professional and personal lives. Though the movie doesn't exactly open with a lot of promise - Hemsworth's character is, for example, first glimpsed seducing a nurse à la James Bond - Rush eventually settles to become a consistently engrossing drama that boasts a handful of genuinely exciting racing sequences (although, by that same token, it's hard not to wish that filmmaker Ron Howard had spent a little more time on the individual races). It's worth noting, too, that Rush fares quite well in its smaller, more low-key moments, with the movie's transformation from merely passable to thoroughly watchable triggered by an early interlude in which Lauda first encounters his future wife (Alexandra Maria Lara's Marlene). There's similarly little doubt that the film benefits substantially from the above-average efforts of its various stars, with Hemsworth and Brühl's stand-out work complemented by a supporting cast that includes, among others, Stephen Mangan, Christian McKay, and Olivia Wilde. And although the movie suffers from a rather anticlimactic final stretch - the narrative peaks with a fantastic crash sequence that leaves one of the protagonists badly injured - Rush ultimately stands as a satisfying biopic that gets the job done efficiently and without much fanfare (ie Howard clearly isn't looking to reinvent the wheel here, so to speak).\n\nout of\n\nMade in America\n\nIn the Heart of the Sea\n\nThe Beatles: Eight Days a Week\n\nInferno (October 4/16)\n\nRon Howard's third (and weakest) stab at a Dan Brown adaptation, Inferno follows Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon as he and an emergency-room doctor (Felicity Jones' Sienna Brooks) team up to prevent a catastrophic global plot designed to wipe out more than half of the world's population. It's instantly clear that Howard, along with returning screenwriter David Koepp, has learned nothing from the relative failure of both The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, as Inferno, for the most part, chugs along at a lackadaisical pace that's compounded by an overlong running time and surfeit of underwhelming subplots. (There is, in terms of the latter, a terminally tedious storyline involving Omar Sy's tenacious pursuing cop, Christoph.) The spinning-its-wheels atmosphere persists for much of Inferno's midsection, which seems to consist entirely of sequences wherein Hanks and Jones' respective characters attempt to figure out a clue and run from bad guys. It's a formula that's repeated over and over and grows increasingly tiresome as time slowly progresses, with the movie's less-than-engrossing vibe compounded by a lack of compelling action sequences. (The only real exception to this comes near the beginning, as Howard offers up an exciting hospital escape/street pursuit that ultimately stands as a high point.) Hanks' solid yet stiff performance is, in the end, emblematic of everything that's wrong with Inferno, as the film's overly serious feel is completely at odds with the fun, fast-paced tone of Brown's page-turner - with, especially, the dull third act ensuring that the movie ends on as anti-climactic a note as one could envision.\n\nout of\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story (May 29/18)\n\nSet years before the events of A New Hope, Solo: A Star Wars Story follows a young Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) as he embarks upon a potentially lucrative quest alongside, among others, Woody Harrelson's Beckett and Emilia Clarke's Qi'ra - with the narrative also detailing Solo's initial encounters with future compatriots Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover). Filmmaker Ron Howard delivers a narrative that doesn't, at the outset, hold a lot of promise, as Solo: A Star Wars Story kicks off with about as uninvolving and unexciting an opening as one could possibly imagine - with Howard, working from a script by Jonathan and Lawrence Kasdan, drops the viewer into a disastrously underwhelming action sequence that's compounded by Bradford Young's dimly-lit, often incoherent cinematography. And while the movie subsequently never quite becomes the engrossing blockbuster one might've expected, Solo: A Star Wars Story, at least, eventually manages to morph into a decent, mostly watchable adventure flick that's elevated by a series of strong supporting performances - with, especially, Glover's ridiculously charismatic turn as the original trilogy's fan-favorite figure standing as a highlight. (Ehrenreich is fine here, though he's never entirely convincing as a younger version of Harrison Ford's iconic title character.) The ongoing inclusion of admittedly engaging set-pieces (eg Han and his cohorts pull off an elaborate heist) ensures that one's interest never entirely flags, and although the film never entirely adds up to anything terribly memorable or distinctive, Solo: A Star Wars Story is nevertheless a decent origin narrative that answers a handful of legitimate questions from George Lucas' saga (and even firmly ends the did-Han-or-Greedo-shoot-first debate)."
