Night Shyamalan’s “The Village” in 2004, the actress said her parents had strict rules against working as a child actor.\n\n“My parents were very firm on that boundary, that they were not going to support anyone who wanted to be a child actor,” she told People.\n\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\nHer father, who as a kid played Opie Taylor on “The Andy Griffith Show” from 1960 to 1966 and later starred in “Happy Days,” explained their thinking.\n\n“It’s possible for child performers to really find a lot that is positive within it, but it’s fraught with landmines,” he said. “On top of everything else, because the characters that I played as a child were so well-known as to almost be iconic, I also thought, ‘Hey, if one of our kids tries to act as a child, boy or girl, they’re going to be unfairly compared.’”\n\nBryce Howard said she is happy with their decision.\n\nTop entertainment headlines, all in one place\n\n“I’m really glad that they did that because when I did start acting, it took a while to make a living. To be able to be like, ‘Oh, okay. I can actually support myself with this,’” she said."
