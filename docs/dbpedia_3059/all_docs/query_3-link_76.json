        "text": "The eponymous Madame Bovary isn’t an easy character to crack, and she’s one that has long inspired dislike and outright disdain in her viewers and readers. Barthes and Wasikowska, however, were eager to subvert that reading, instead opting to find the many shades of gray in Emma.\n\n“I think she is complex. She can be monstrous but she is also vulnerable. She refuses the mediocrity and pettiness of her surroundings. The complexity of her character is that you can never fully understand her,” Barthes said.\n\n“Mia is a very intuitive actress. She understood the subtlety of the character. I think Emma will remain an enigma.”\n\nEarlier this year, Wasikowska shared a similar sentiment with Indiewire, telling us, “Emma Bovary is such a great anti-hero.”\n\n“[Sophie Barthes and I] talked about not vilifying her, even though some of her actions are not particularly heroic. We just wanted to bring a level of understanding. We both found that we empathize with why she did the things she did.”\n\nThe complex elements of Emma’s personality — and of her myriad desires — are never overtly judged in the film, and Barthes herself continues to question her main character’s motivations: “Is she just permanently dissatisfied or is she just too sensitive for her century? She is guided by her desires and appetites to self destruction, but she also wants something more than the mediocre life she is assigned by a highly male dominated society.”\n\nThe rest of Barthes’ cast isn’t too shabby either, including her one-time “Cold Souls” star Paul Giamatti, Ezra Miller, Logan Marshall-Green, Henry Lloyd-Hughes and Rhys Ifans, all starring as the various men in her life — husbands and lovers, pharmacists and dry goods dealers, everyone it seems, is out for Emma — who contribute to Emma’s downfall during the course of the film.\n\nFocusing more tightly on Emma’s story was a large part of the appeal for Barthes and, alongside screenwriter Felipe Marino, Barthes surgically sliced down whole swathes of Flaubert’s original novel. Most notably, the pair did away with an introductory section in Flaubert’s novel that first introduces readers to Emma’s husband, Charles.\n\n“It’s very difficult when you tackle a 500 page novel. Some choices have to be made,” Barthes said. “I collaborated with screenwriter Felipe Marino, who had already made some bold choice in his approach to the adaptation. I liked his approach, and we worked to try to make it contemporary thematically, but retain the authenticity of the period and the location.”\n\nPart of the appeal of Barthes’ film is the attention she pays to the more seductive and sensual elements of Emma’s complicated romantic life, one that is often ruled by her physical desires. “Not everyone connected with that aspect of the film. I tried to put myself in Emma’s subjectivity and approach it from a female perspective,” Barthes said.\n\n“What Emma is looking for, mainly, is to be seen by men, but they don’t really see her, she is objectified.”\n\nBarthes, however, did see Emma, and the result is one of the finest takes on Flaubert’s master work, enigmatic or not."
