        "text": "American film director, producer, and actorTemplate:SHORTDESC:American film director, producer, and actor\n\nThis article might be using a American English for its pagename. (March 2019)\n\nThis article is about the American actor. For other people named Ronald Howard, see Ronald Howard (disambiguation).\n\nRonald William Howard (born March 1, 1954) is an American filmmaker and actor. Howard is best known for playing two high-profile roles in television sitcoms in his youth and directing a number of successful feature films later in his career.\n\nHoward first came to prominence playing young Opie Taylor, the son of Sheriff Andy Taylor (played by Andy Griffith), in the sitcom The Andy Griffith Show from 1960 through 1968. During this time, he also appeared in the musical film The Music Man (1962) and the comedy film The Courtship of Eddie's Father (1963). He also appeared in an episode of Land of the Giants 1968. In 1973, he played Steve Bolander in the classic coming-of-age film American Graffiti (1973). In 1974, Howard became a household name playing teenager Richie Cunningham in the sitcom Happy Days, continuing in the role for seven years.[1] Howard continued making films during this time, appearing in the western film The Shootist (1976) and the comedy film Grand Theft Auto (1977), which he also directed.\n\nIn 1980, Howard left Happy Days to focus on directing. His films include the science-fiction/fantasy film Cocoon (1985), the high fantasy film Willow (1988), the historical docudrama Apollo 13 (1995) (earning him the Directors Guild of America award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures), the biographical drama A Beautiful Mind (2001) (earning him the Academy Award for Best Director and Academy Award for Best Picture), the thriller The Da Vinci Code (2006), the historical drama Frost/Nixon (2008) (nominated for Best Director and Best Picture Academy Awards) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018).\n\nSince 2003, Howard has narrated the Fox (later Netflix) comedy series Arrested Development, on which he also served as an executive producer and played a semi-fictionalized version of himself.\n\nIn 2003, Howard was awarded the National Medal of Arts.[2] Asteroid 12561 Howard is named after him. He was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 2013.[3] Howard has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions in the television and motion pictures industries.[4]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nHoward was born in Duncan, Oklahoma, in 1954, the elder son of Jean Speegle Howard (1927–2000), an actress, and Rance Howard (1928–2017), a director, writer, and actor.[5] He has German, English, Scottish, Irish, and Dutch ancestry.Template:Sfn[6][7][8][9] His father was born with the surname \"Beckenholdt\" and had taken the stage name \"Howard\" by 1948, for his acting career.[10][11] Rance Howard was serving three years in the United States Air Force at the time of Ron's birth.Template:Sfn[12] The family moved to Hollywood in 1958, the year before the birth of his younger brother, Clint Howard. They rented a house on the block south of the Desilu Studios, where The Andy Griffith Show was later filmed. They lived in Hollywood for at least three years, before moving to Burbank.\n\nHoward was tutored at Desilu Studios in his younger years but continued his schooling at Robert Louis Stevenson Elementary and David Star Jordan Junior High when not working in television, eventually graduating from John Burroughs High School. He later attended the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts but did not graduate.[13][14]\n\nHoward has said he knew from a young age he might want to go into directing, thanks to his early experience as an actor.[15][16]\n\nCareer[]\n\nEarly acting roles and The Andy Griffith Show[]\n\nIn 1959, Howard had his first credited film role, in The Journey. He appeared in June Allyson's CBS anthology series The DuPont Show with June Allyson in the episode \"Child Lost\"; in The Twilight Zone episode \"Walking Distance\"; a few episodes of the first season of the sitcom Dennis the Menace, as Stewart, one of Dennis's friends; and several first- and second-season episodes of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis. Howard played \"Timmy\" (uncredited) in \"Counterfeit Gun\", Season 4, Episode 2 (1960) of the TV series, \"The Cheyenne Show.\"\n\nIn 1960, Howard was cast as Opie Taylor in The Andy Griffith Show. Credited as \"Ronny Howard\", he portrayed the son of the title character (played by Andy Griffith) for all eight seasons of the show. Recalling his experiences as a child actor on set, he commented\n\nI was five years old. And I was preoccupied with the prop that was in my hand, because it was a toy turtle. But I had to pretend it was a real turtle that the audience just wasn't seeing, and it was dead, so I was supposed to be crying and very emotional, and I remember him looking at that little turtle and talking to me about how it was kind of funny to have to pretend that was dead. So I recall just a very relaxed first impression.[17]\n\nIn the 1962 film version of The Music Man, Howard played Winthrop Paroo, the child with the lisp; the film starred Robert Preston and Shirley Jones. He also starred in the 1963 film The Courtship of Eddie's Father, with Glenn Ford.\n\nHe appeared as Barry Stewart on The Eleventh Hour, in the episode \"Is Mr. Martian Coming Back?\" in 1965; on I Spy, in the episode \"Little Boy Lost\", in 1966; as Henry Fonda's son in an ABC series, The Smith Family, in 1968; as Jodah, in \"Land of the Giants\", in 1969; as a boy whose father was shot, on the TV show \"Daniel Boone\", in 1971–72; and as an underage Marine on M*A*S*H in the episode \"Sometimes You Hear the Bullet\", in 1973. In the 1970s, he appeared in at least one episode of The Bold Ones, as a teenage tennis player with an illness.\n\nHoward appeared on the 1969 Disneyland Records album The Story and Song from the Haunted Mansion. It featured the story of two teenagers, Mike (Howard) and Karen (Robie Lester), who get trapped inside the Haunted Mansion. Thurl Ravenscroft plays the Narrator, Pete Reneday plays the Ghost Host, and Eleanor Audley plays Madame Leota. Some of the effects and ideas that were planned but never permanently made it to the attraction are mentioned here: the Raven speaks in the Stretching Room, and the Hatbox Ghost is mentioned during the Attic scene. It was reissued in 1998 as a cassette tape titled A Spooky Night in Disney's Haunted Mansion and on CD in 2009.\n\nIn 1974, Howard guest starred as Seth Turner, the best friend of Jason Walton (Jon Walmsley), in The Waltons, \"The Gift\". In the episode, Seth wants to learn to play an instrument in his father's band, but it looks as if he will not have the time; he has been diagnosed with leukemia. The concept of death — and the unfairness of it all — is an extremely difficult one for Jason to accept, and it is up to Grandpa to help the boy through this crisis. Featured in the cast as Dr. McIvers is Ron Howard's father Rance Howard.[18]\n\nFilm roles and Happy Days[]\n\nHoward played Steve Bolander in George Lucas's coming-of-age film American Graffiti in 1973.[1] A role in an installment of series Love, American Style, titled \"Love and the Television Set\",[19] led to his being cast as Richie Cunningham in the TV series Happy Days (for syndication, the segment was re-titled \"Love and the Happy Days\"). Beginning in 1974, he played the likeable \"buttoned-down\" boy, in contrast to Henry Winkler's \"greaser\" Arthur \"Fonzie\"/\"The Fonz\" Fonzarelli. On the Happy Days set, he developed an on- and off-screen chemistry with series leads Winkler and Tom Bosley. The three remained friends until Bosley's death in October 2010.\n\nIn 1976, Howard played Gillom Rogers in the movie The Shootist, with John Wayne. Howard's last significant on-screen role was a reprise of his famous role as Opie Taylor in the 1986 TV movie Return to Mayberry, an Andy Griffith Show reunion reuniting him with Griffith, Don Knotts, and most of the cast. He also appeared in two Happy Days TV reunions: 1992's The Happy Days Reunion Special, a retrospective hosted by Winkler that aired on ABC; and 2005's The Happy Days 30th Anniversary Reunion, where he was reunited with most of the surviving cast.\n\nDirecting[]\n\nBefore leaving Happy Days in 1980, Howard made his directing debut with the 1977 low-budget comedy/action film Grand Theft Auto.[1] This came after cutting a deal with Roger Corman, wherein Corman let Howard direct a film in exchange for Howard starring in Eat My Dust!, with Christopher Norris.[1] Howard went on to direct several TV movies.[1] His big theatrical break came in 1982, with Night Shift, featuring Michael Keaton, Shelley Long, and Henry Winkler.[1]\n\nHe has since directed a number of high-visibility films, including Splash, Cocoon, Willow, Parenthood, Backdraft, Apollo 13, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, A Beautiful Mind (for which he won the Academy Award for Best Director), Cinderella Man, The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons, Rush, In the Heart of the Sea and Inferno.\n\nHoward showcased the world premiere of his film Frost/Nixon at the 2008 London Film Festival in October 2008.[20]\n\nHoward was the recipient of the Austin Film Festival's 2009 Extraordinary Contribution to Filmmaking Award. Michael Keaton presented him with the Award.\n\nHoward took over directing duties on Solo: A Star Wars Story, a film featuring Star Wars character Han Solo in his younger years. The film was released on May 23, 2018. Howard officially replaced directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller on June 22, 2017; they were let go from their position two days earlier, reportedly due to their refusal to compromise with Lucasfilm over the direction of the film; reportedly the directors encouraged significant improvisations by the actors, which was believed by some at Lucasfilm to be \"shifting the story off-course\".[21] At the time, the film was nearly completed, with three and a half weeks left to film and another five weeks of reshoots scheduled.[21] Howard posted on Twitter, \"I'm beyond grateful to add my voice to the Star Wars Universe after being a fan since 5/25/77. I hope to honor the great work already done & help deliver on the promise of a Han Solo film.\"[22]\n\nIn November 2017, Howard announced that he would be teaching his first directing class.[23]\n\nImagine Entertainment[]\n\nHoward is the co-chairman, with Brian Grazer, of Imagine Entertainment, a film and television production company. Imagine has produced several films including Friday Night Lights, 8 Mile, and Inside Deep Throat, as well as the television series 24, Felicity, and Arrested Development which Howard also narrated.\n\nIn July 2012, it was announced that Imagine had put into development Conquest for Showtime, a period drama based on the 16th century conquest of the Aztecs by Spanish Conquistadors. To be directed by Howard, the series was originally planned as a feature film before it was decided that the project was more suited to television.[24]\n\nAs part of Imagine Entertainment, he appeared in a 1997 print ad for Milk – Where's your mustache?, in which he wore a cap for Imagine Entertainment and sported a milk mustache. Earlier versions show a younger Ronny Howard on the other side.\n\nIn 2009, he appeared in the Jamie Foxx music video \"Blame It\".\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nHoward married writer Cheryl Alley (b. 1953) on June 7, 1975.[25][26]Template:Sfn They have four children: daughters Bryce Dallas Howard (b. 1981) (who has earned her own acting status in films), twins Jocelyn Carlyle and Paige Howard (b. 1985) (like her father and older sister, Bryce, Paige is also an actor), and son Reed Cross (b. 1987).\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm[]\n\nYear Title Credited as Notes Director Producer Writer 1977 Grand Theft Auto Yes No Yes Directorial debut 1982 Night Shift Yes No No 1984 Splash Yes No No 1985 Cocoon Yes No No 1986 Gung Ho Yes Yes No Australian title: Working Class Man 1988 Willow Yes No No 1989 Parenthood Yes No Story 1991 Backdraft Yes No No 1992 Far and Away Yes Yes Story 1994 The Paper Yes No No 1995 Apollo 13 Yes No No 1996 Ransom Yes No No 1997 I Will Some Wishing Yes Yes No 1999 EDtv Yes Yes No 2000 How the Grinch Stole Christmas Yes Yes No 2001 A Beautiful Mind Yes Yes No 2003 The Missing Yes Yes No 2005 Cinderella Man Yes Yes No 2006 The Da Vinci Code Yes Yes No 2008 Frost/Nixon Yes Yes No 2009 Angels & Demons Yes Yes No 2011 The Dilemma Yes Yes No 2013 Rush Yes Yes No 2015 In the Heart of the Sea Yes Yes No 2016 Inferno Yes Yes No 2018 Solo: A Star Wars Story Yes No No Replaced directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller TBA Hillbilly Elegy Yes Yes No Filming\n\nProducer only[]\n\nYear Title Notes 1980 Leo and Loree Executive producer 1987 No Man's Land 1988 Clean and Sober Vibes Executive producer 1989 The 'Burbs 1991 The Doors Executive producer (Uncredited) Closet Land Executive producer 1996 The Chamber 1997 Inventing the Abbotts 2004 The Alamo 2006 Curious George 2010 Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey!
