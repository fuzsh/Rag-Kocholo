Ron Howard uses his family members in all most of his movies. You can usually spot his father Rance Howard and brother Clint very easily. Spotting his wife, Cheryl, is a little harder but she is there too.\n\n3. Talk about bad timing…..on the morning the Oscar® nominations came out for the 1995 movies….Apollo 13 received 9 nominations but no nomination for Howard as Best Director.

Imagine also produced the television shows…..24, Felicity, Arrested Development and my daughter’s favorite show…Curious George.\n\n6. Ron Howard has been married one time in his life. In 1975 he wed his high-school sweetheart, Cheryl Alley. They have four children, oldest daughter Bryce, twin daughters Jocelyn and Paige and son Reed. His daughter’s middle names indicate where they were conceived. Bryce was conceived in Dallas, Texas so her full name is Bryce Dallas Howard. While the twins were conceived at the Carlyle Hotel…so they are Jocelyn Carlyle Howard and Paige Carlyle Howard.\n\n7. Ron Howard attended high school with actress Rene Russo. They later would make the movie Ransom together.\n\n8. Ron Howard and Tom Hanks have been working together for almost 30 years.
