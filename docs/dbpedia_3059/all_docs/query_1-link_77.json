        "text": "Rance Howard (November 17, 1928 – November 25, 2017) was an American actor who starred in film and on television who appeared as the The Theater Security Guard in Season 3's Mork meets Robin Williams.\n\nBiography[]\n\nHoward was born Harold Engel Beckenholdt in Newkirk, Kay County, Oklahoma, the son of Ethel Cleo (née Tomlin) and Engel Beckenholdt, a farmer. He changed his name to \"Rance Howard\" when he became an actor. Howard studied at the University of Oklahoma.\n\nHoward married actress Jean Speegle Howard in Burbank, California, in 1949. They remained married until her death, in September 2000. Their sons are actor and filmmaker Ron Howard and actor Clint Howard. Ron being born while he served three years in the United States Air Force. He was also the grandfather of actresses Bryce Dallas Howard and Paige Howard.\n\nRance was best friends with his son Ron's acting mentor, Andy Griffith, for over 50 years, until Griffith's death on July 3, 2012.\n\nIn 2001, Howard married Judy Howard, a year after his first wife's death. Judy Howard died in January 2017 in Burbank, 10 months before Rance's death.\n\nHoward died on the morning of November 25, 2017, in Los Angeles, California, eight days after his 89th birthday, from heart failure spurred on by a West Nile virus infection.[1]\n\nCareer[]\n\nHis professional acting career began in 1948 in New York City, when he landed a job in a children's touring company. The role that got him noticed nationally for television and film came in 1950, when he took on the part of Lindstrom in the touring company of the massively successful Mister Roberts with Henry Fonda in 1950, portraying the character for about a year-and-a-half in major cities across the U.S.[2]\n\nAfter his stint in the USAF was done, Rance and Jean moved the family to L.A. where he pursued TV and film as a career. Both Rance and elder son Ron, who was two at the time, made their feature-film debuts together in the 1956 Western Frontier Woman. Rance made his TV bow in the Kraft Theatre anthology series, appearing three times from 1956–57.\n\nWhen Ron began to play Opie in The Andy Griffith Show in 1960, Rance had guest parts in five episodes over the course of the 8 year run of the show. He also appeared in 3 episodes of Ron's other best known show, Happy Days in the 70s , with a part in Laverne & Shirley giving him the hat-trick of extant Garry Marshall shows alongside his Mork & Mindy appearance.\n\nHoward was possibly known best for his role as Henry Boomhauer, a backwoodsman in 32 episodes of the 1960s TV series Gentle Ben starring his younger son, Clint. He also made 5 appearances as Dr. McIvers in The Waltons, one of which also featured son, Ron. He had a prominent recurring role on Babylon 5, in the 90's, as David Sheridan, the father of station captain John Sheridan, and starred in in the short-lived 2000 TV series Driving Me Crazy. Other television guest appearances over 7 decades include Gunsmoke, Bonanza, Kung Fu, Dynasty, Dallas, CBS Schoolbreak Special 1986 episode \"The Drug Knot\", Quantum Leap, Seinfeld, Angel (where he got to play the titular hero when his character swaps bodies with him), 7th Heaven, Cold Case, Bones, That's So Raven, and The X-Files.\n\nHoward appeared in over 100 films, including the 1967 movie Cool Hand Luke, The Music Man (in an uncredited bit part playing \"Oscar Jackson\"), and many other notable films such as Chinatown (1974), Ed Wood (1994), Apollo 13 (1995), Independence Day (1996), Cinderella Man (2005), Nebraska (2013), and Max Rose (2016). He also appeared as Dottie and Kit's father in A League of Their Own. He appeared in fifteen films directed by his son Ron Grand Theft Auto (1977), Splash (1984), Cocoon (1985), Gung Ho (1986), Parenthood (1989), Far and Away (1992), The Paper (1994), Apollo 13 (1995), How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000), A Beautiful Mind (2001), The Missing (2003), Cinderella Man (2005), Frost/Nixon (2008), Angels & Demons (2009) and The Dilemma (2011). He received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program for co-producing the television film The Time Crystal (1981),\n\nHis final film role, completed in September 2017, is also the largest in his career. He plays the role of Carl Robbins in the Michael Worth road-trip drama, Apple Seed, playing on film for the first time the father of his real-life son Clint.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilms[]\n\nYear Title Role 1956 Frontier Woman Prewitt 1962 The Music Man Oscar Jackson 1963 The Courtship of Eddie's Father Camp Counselor 1965 Village of the Giants Deputy 1965 The Desert Raven Reggie 1966 An Eye for an Eye Harry 1967 Gentle Giant Tater Coughlin Cool Hand Luke Sheriff 1969 Old Paint Cowboy 1970 The Wild Country Cleve 1972 Bloody Trail Jake 1973 Salty 1974 Where the Lilies Bloom Roy Luther Chinatown Irate Farmer 1976 Eat My Dust!

With Mindy under strict orders to interview the visiting star, or risk losing her job, and Mork constantly mistaken for him (which he doesn't see), the two of them as a last resort go to the Stage Door with Mork incognito, in the hope of getting her a short interview with him. When Mork takes his disguise off, he's mobbed by the other fans hoping to see him, with the Theater Security Guard emerging at the commotion. Also thinking Mork is Williams he lets them in and brings them to his dressing room, not overly impressed by the jokes Mork tells, wondering if he seriously gets paid for that. Later, after the real Williams has arrived and consented to give Mindy an interview, the guard returns to tell him that he's due on stage only to be bewildered by seeing both Mork and Williams in the room."
