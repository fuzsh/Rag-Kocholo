        "text": "Ron Howard could’ve coasted for the rest of his life on his beloved work as an actor on The Andy Griffith Show and Happy Days, not to mention films like The Shootist and American Graffiti. But by the time he was in his teens, he’d already sensed that his true destiny was behind the camera rather than in front of it. Dozens of films and a few Oscars later, Howard is now finally turning back to television—as the director on the first episode of Genius, the National Geographic Channel’s event series about the life of Albert Einstein that premieres Tuesday. It’s the first time Howard has directed a TV movie since 1981’s The Time Crystal, a.k.a. Through the Magic Pyramid. (Check it out, kids!)\n\nHoward spoke with Vanity Fair about his fascination with Einstein and his return to the small screen, as well as The Dark Tower, the next season of Arrested Development, his possible return to This Is Us, and how a mediocre sitcom led him to a life as a director.\n\nVanity Fair: You’ve said that you’ve been fascinated with Albert Einstein since you were a kid.\n\nRon Howard: I’ve always been fascinated by the possibility of an Einstein movie, but I never felt that there was the narrative shape there to support a movie. It was always frustrating. It was always hurried or rushed, or it was too narrow a scope. So I’d never gotten involved with any of [those projects]. But I read this one with a lot of curiosity.\n\nIt turns out that this had been developed for, gosh, probably six or seven years—based on Walter Isaacson’s book [Einstein: His Life and Universe]—as a feature, and they had shaped it instead into a 10-hour series proposal with a screenplay by Noah Pink for the first hour. And I was really taken by it. I realized how little I actually knew about Einstein, how much drama there was in his life, how many twists and turns there were, how much pressure there was on him.\n\nI’d been looking for an opportunity to direct something for TV for our company at Imagine; like everyone else, I see how wonderful and ambitious the work is on television these days, and I’ve been wanting to be a part of it. And this was a rare opportunity and—interestingly—one where the network itself actually informs the project. For National Geographic to deal with the subject of Albert Einstein, it creates kind of an understanding as to what its ambitions are going to be and what the demands are on the creative team.\n\nHaving seen the first two episodes, I can testify that it’s very visually appealing.\n\nSo is National Geographic! [Laughs.] If you look at the magazine, it’s immersive, it’s entertaining, it’s obviously informative, and it’s incredibly visual. So the production team and the creative team and the cinematographer and I, we all looked at each other, and we said, “Hey, this is National Geographic! This may be a television budget, but we’ve got to live up to that standard!”\n\nYou directed the first episode of Genius. After doing so, did you find yourself wishing that your schedule had been open enough for you to direct more?\n\nUh, yes. [Laughs.] It was a fantastic cast, the scripts are strong. Ken Biller, who came in on the series as the showrunner, put together a terrific writers’ room in addition to Noah Pink, and they did their own research.\n\nOn the production side of Imagine, how is The Dark Tower coming along?\n\nIt’s coming along really well. They’ve moved up the release date. The acting’s great; Idris Elba is cool and makes a great Gunslinger; Matthew McConaughey is really fascinating and powerful as the Man in Black; and I think Nikolaj Arcel, who directed, has done a great job.\n\nPeople no doubt ask you all the time what you learned from working on The Andy Griffith Show and Happy Days‑but what did you learn from doing The Smith Family with Henry Fonda, a show that lasted for 39 episodes on ABC, from January 1971 to June 1972?\n\nHenry Fonda knew my father, Rance, because my father had toured in Mister Roberts with him. And Fonda . . . that was a money job. [Laughs.] He was tightly scheduled, and he was a consummate professional, but he wasn’t very chatty. But with me, he was willing to talk because, well, he just liked Rance! And that opened up a fantastic relationship and kind of an early mentorship. He was the one who saw my Super 8 movies and read a couple of short stories and a little script I wrote and said, “You know, if you love movies, you should become a director. Because it’s a director’s medium. And I can see that you can do it.” And he gave me film- theory books. He said, “If you truly love acting, you need to go to the theater, because that’s the medium for the playwright and the actor. But if you love movies, then you s, that meant so much.\n\nThe Smith Family was also a real lesson in what mediocrity looked like. It was not a good show. I’d been on The Andy Griffith Show, and as easy-going as it looked to viewers, there was a tremendous work ethic behind that show, led by Andy. There was also a clear-cut vision defined by the writers and defined by Andy that was adhered to. The difference was noticeable to me then: The Smith Family was being manufactured, The Andy Griffith Show was being lovingly handmade every week. That was an important object lesson to me. I don’t believe in manufacturing.\n\nYou turned up as yourself on the season finale of NBC’s This Is Us. Are you going to be in a position to pop up in Season 2?\n\nYou know, I don’t know. When [series creator] Dan Fogelman asked me to do this—I’ve known him for quite awhile, and I love the show—he said nothing about what’s going to happen with this movie project. So I haven’t heard.\n\nActually, it was funny when I was doing that, because I actually took the director aside and said to her, “You know, I play myself sometimes on The Simpsons or Arrested Development or in a Funny or Die sketch. And I know I’m still playing myself, but this needs to actually be kind of real. This needs to look like it’s an actual conversation. So please keep an eye on me.” [Laughs.] So we did a couple of takes.\n\nAre appearances like that enough to keep at bay any acting bug you may still have?\n\nWell, I don’t count playing myself in a “Funny or Die” sketch as acting. [Laughs.] But it’s fun! One of these days, though, I’d love to do a little acting again. It’s just that I’m so involved in what’s going on at Imagine Entertainment, and there’s so much going on. Now we’ve even entered the world of documentaries in a more consistent way. I had a fantastic experience working on the Beatles documentary [The Beatles: Eight Days A Week], and I hope to do more of that as well."
