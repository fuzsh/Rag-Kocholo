        "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 09: (L-R) Bryce Dallas Howard and Ron Howard attend the 2020 Vanity Fair Oscar Party hosted by Radhika Jones at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts on February 09, 2020 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)\n\nIt's Ron Howard's 70th birthday, and nobody is celebrating as much as his daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard.\n\nThe Argylle star took to Instagram on Friday, March 1, to hype up her twin—er, we mean, father—with a throwback photo of the two looking nearly identical.\n\nThe Polaroid-style snapshot found a 1-year-old Bryce perched on her father's shoulders, smiling sweetly with her hands held up in joy. Ron secured her by her feet, leaning toward the camera with a giant smile of his own—a pic that one commenter described as \"rad.\"\n\nThe two wore matching gray t-shirts that said \"BRYCE\" and \"DAD\" on them in red lettering.\n\n\"Happy 70th birthday Daddio!\" she wrote. \"I love you SOOOOOOO MUCH!!!⁣⁣\"\n\nThe actress clearly favors the sweet little moniker for her father, using it on his 69th birthday, too, when she wrote, \"Daddio, you are my best friend — always have been, always will be,\" alongside a series of heartfelt memories.\n\nBryce's 43rd birthday falls on March 2, 2024, so we expect that, much like the previous year, Ron will follow suit with a touching message of his own for his daughter.\n\nIn the meantime, the filmmaker is enjoying a lovely day with his wife, Cheryl, with the two taking a long \"birthday walk\" earlier this morning.\n\nRon took a moment to thank his fans for their birthday wishes, joking that they'd beat his wife to the punch.\n\n\"And as I contemplate my life here on my 70th birthday I'm also reminded of how much support you've given me, my work. It's been a lifetime, and I've loved it. I still love it,\" he said. \"You've watched the shows old and new, the movies I've made — I hope you'll watch the movies I'm continuing to make and planning to make and the work coming out of Imagine Entertainment — it's really a joy to be able to live this life and do this work and thank you for supporting it over these years.\""
