        "text": "If you haven’t felt uncomfortable watching them, you may have felt that way hearing about the bathtub scene, the grave scene and other moments in the movie “Saltburn.”\n\nGiven the film’s hype, you wouldn’t have experienced that feeling alone.\n\nBut why would moviegoers be compelled to be repelled? Aren’t they somewhat polar reactions?\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nNortheastern University film and media experts say that films and other artwork that provoke extreme discomfort — some might say that make you cringe — can be a way to safely experience and assert control over such feelings.\n\n“I think it has to do a lot with testing the limits of our own familiars — wanting to be OK with things and doing it through this other lens (of art) is how you can do it,” says Julia Hechtman, associate chair and teaching professor in the department of art and design at Northeastern and an expert on horror films. “It’s like a desensitization.”\n\nSocial media’s repurposing of “cringeworthy” material, meanwhile, amplifies this desire to assert and demonstrate control over such feelings.\n\n“Through the reaction video, someone performs cringe and creates cringe for their followers by recontextualizing a piece of media content,” explains Moira Weigel, assistant professor in the Department of Communication Studies at Northeastern and a member of the university’s Executive Committee of Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies.\n\n“By doing this, they stake out a kind of distinctive identity for themselves: they’re not the naïve consumer, they have a take on this piece of media or culture that is different from what the director/filmmaker seemed directly to expect or intend, and they’re making a bid to establish a kind of community around that feeling — a community where they have status.”\n\n“Saltburn” opened in theaters in November and debuted on Amazon Prime in December.\n\nIt’s gotten people talking.\n\nThe movie has garnered one lead actor a “Saturday Night Live” hosting gig and another a Hasty Pudding Award; inspired Brooklyn clubbers; and furthered the “reaction videos” genre on YouTube and TikTok … with entries such as “Saltburn was sick & twisted … but we’re OBSESSED” and “First Time Watching “Saltburn” And im TRAUMATISED (sic).” It’s also responsible for resurrecting the 2001 earworm “Murder on the Dancefloor” to ubiquity.\n\nHechtman says she has not seen “Saltburn” (her film students did not recommend it) and stresses that she is neither a psychologist nor a psychiatrist.\n\nBut Hechtman has focused on evoking simultaneous feelings of repulsion and curiosity through art projects focused on people’s relationship with dying and death and its rituals. And art — particularly movies — can provide a safe environment in which to experience discomfort.\n\n“When you watch a horror movie, it’s just a movie; It’s not the real thing — nobody wants something calamitous to happen to themselves,” Hechtman explains. “But to see it unfold, and to be, ‘Wow, that wasn’t as bad as it could have been,’ because I’m protected by this space. And this disconnect, I think that’s why things are easier to consume in movies.”\n\n“It’s familiar enough when it’s successful that you can ‘insert yourself here,’” Hechtman continues. “But foreign enough where you’re like, ‘That isn’t me.’”"
