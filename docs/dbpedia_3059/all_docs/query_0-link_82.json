        "meta_description": "Tom Hanks is well known for being one of the nicest guys in Hollywood, but the Oscar-winner once had a major falling out with a fellow acting legend that led to their immediate dismissal. Director Ron Howard remembered them both being 'compelled' in trying to talk to him about it and said how 'disappointing' it all was.",

        "text": "At first, Winkler jokingly put his hand to his ear saying: “What did you say?”\n\nHe then said: “I was directing that movie for 13 days, and then I was called into [former Walt Disney Studios chairman] Jeff Katzenberg‘s office and he said 'Do you have everything with you? Go home.' I got along great, great… with that dog. That dog… love that dog.”\n\nIn the end, Winker was replaced by Roger Spottiswoode, who was best known for directing Shoot to Kill and writing 48 Hours.\n\nIt turns out that the Fonz star and Hanks had big disagreements on how to proceed with the movie, as recalled by their mutual friend director Ron Howard."
