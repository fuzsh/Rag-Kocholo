        "text": "Tributes from all parts of Hollywood poured in for “MASH,” “Klute” and “The Hunger Games” star Donald Sutherland, who died at age 88 on Thursday. The honorary Oscar recipient died in Miami after a long illness.\n\nSutherland garnered over 200 film and TV credits over 60 years starring in films like “Ordinary People” and “Don’t Look Now.”\n\nMore from Variety\n\nRemembering Donald Sutherland: From Cool in 'MASH' to Sexy in 'Don't Look Now' to Tragic in 'Ordinary People,' He Was a Chameleon, and the Most Human of Movie Stars\n\nKiefer Sutherland Pays Tribute to Late Father Donald: 'One of the Most Important Actors in the History of Film'\n\nDonald Sutherland, Star of 'MASH,' 'Klute' and 'Hunger Games,' Dies at 88\n\nBorn in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada on July 17, 1935, Sutherland landed his first big role in 1967’s “The Dirty Dozen,” which later earned him a spot as surgeon Capt. “Hawkeye” Pierce in “MASH.”\n\nHis son Kiefer Sutherland called him “one of the most important actors in the history of film.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden took to X to honor Sutherland, who he described as “a beloved husband, father, grandfather, and one-of-a-kind actor who inspired and entertained the world for decades.”\n\nHelen Mirren, who starred with him in “The Leisure Seeker,” said in a statement, “Donald Sutherland was one of the smartest actors I ever worked with. He had a wonderful enquiring brain, and a great knowledge on a wide variety of subjects. He combined this great intelligence with a deep sensitivity, and with a seriousness about his profession as an actor. This all made him into the legend of film that he became. He was my colleague and became my friend. I will miss his presence in this world.”\n\nIn thriller “Klute,” Sutherland starred as romantic lead and titular character John Klute across Jane Fonda’s Bree Daniels. Fonda called Sutherland a “brilliant actor and a complex man” in her tribute on Instagram, saying the pair loved working together on the film.\n\nFilmmaker, actor and 2017’s “Baby Driver” director Edgar Wright posted his tribute to X, praising Sutherland’s legacy in film and TV.\n\n“RIP the great Donald Sutherland, a favourite actor and always fascinating screen presence. He starred in two of my very favourite and most influential films – ‘Don’t Look Now’ and the 1978 ‘Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers,'” Wright tweeted. “But that is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of his legendary filmography; a funny, laconic, but also intense and dramatic presence in so many memorable movies, starting with his break-through in ‘The Dirty Dozen’, and then on an incredible run in the 70’s, 80’s and beyond with ‘M*A*S*H’, ‘Kelly’s Heroes’, ‘Little Murders’, ‘Klute’, ‘Don’t Look Now’, ‘The Day Of The Locust’, ‘Ordinary People’ and ‘JFK’, among many others. I even adore his very early appearances in ‘Dr Terror’s House Of Horrors’ and ‘The World Ten Times Over’, as well as his very silly cameo in ‘Kentucky Fried Movie’.”\n\n“I know many of you following me will feel the same way about this great screen legend’s passing, so please list your favourite Donald Sutherland films,” he continued. “So sorry to see you go Donald, but what a legacy you leave behind.”\n\nDirector Ron Howard wrote on X, “I was blessed to direct him in #Backdraft. One of the most intelligent, interesting & engrossing film actors of all time. Incredible range, creative courage & dedication to serving the story & the audience with supreme excellence.”\n\nSee more reactions below:\n\nActor Rob Lowe remembered Sutherland writing on X, “Today we lost one of our greatest actors, Donald Sutherland. It was my honor to work with him many years ago, and I will never forget his charisma and ability. If you want a master class in acting, watch him in “Ordinary People”. My condolences to Kiefer.”\n\n2022’s “The Batman” Director Matt Reeves called Sutherland “one of the all-time greats” in his tribute on X.\n\nAuthor Margaret Atwood remembered a fellow Canadian, writing on X that like her, he attended Victoria University, “Oh no! He went to Vic in Toronto..he was a great actor even then.”\n\n“Happy Days” star Henry Winkler responded to Kiefer Sutherland’s tweet, writing, “Stacey and I send you our deepest sympathies .. Your dad was indeed singular . Warmly , Henry”\n\nFilmmaker Mark Cousins wrote, “Lucky to have known great movie actors. But #DonaldSutherland‘s death hits hard. Intellectually brilliant, full of doubt about his own beauty, searching. He loved talking abt books, sex, Fellini, Jane Fonda, politics. Dazzling.”\n\nThe Black List Founder and film and TV producer Franklin Leonard shared a tribute via X, saying “A legend has passed.”\n\nBest of Variety\n\nEmmy Predictions: Guest Acting - 'The Bear,' 'Hacks,' 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith,' 'SNL' and More Deliver 277 Contenders Across 4 Categories\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in June 2024"
