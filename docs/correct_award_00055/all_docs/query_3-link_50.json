This LibGuide, while not all-encompassing, brings together a wealth of book awards, both national and international. Visit the tabs at the top of the page to find specific genres, including romance, horror, mystery, LGBTQ+, and many more. If you are aware of a literature award that you would like to see included, please email me at jchilleshiem@viterbo.edu. *Please note: poetry, short story, and children's lit awards are not included in this guide*."
