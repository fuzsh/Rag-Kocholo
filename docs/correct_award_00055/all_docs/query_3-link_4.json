        "text": "Wole Soyinka received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986. During the week or so when the 2018 Prizes are being announced, he will visit the City Library and tell about his writings, which include many works rooted in Nigeria and in the Yoruba culture. Soyinka is strongly engaged in social issues and is an outspoken critic of dictatorship, which has resulted in both imprisonment and exile.\n\nIntolerance has become the ruling ideology of today”\n\nDr Soyinkaâs talk will be held in English, and admission will be free of charge."
