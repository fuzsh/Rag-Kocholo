I fell in love with the work of Wole Soyinka when in secondary school a visiting drama teacher tried to get us to learn The Trials of Brother Jero. I then spent most of my summer holidays at the library devouring as much of his work as I could lay my hands on. Through the years, his work remains one of the few artists I often revisit. I am especially fond of the play Death and the King's Horseman (\"Elesin Oba!!!\"), the autobiographical series Ake, Ibadan and Isara, and the poignant prison notes The Man Died. His translation of D.O. Fagunwa's Forest of a Thousand Daemons is probably the most exciting literature I have ever read. As exciting and insightful as his work is, that's actually not what elevates him to hero status for me. No, not even the Nobel prize. It's his human rights advocacy, his dogged pursuit of justice, his ingenious and brave principled stands against oppression that I find most remarkable. Given his numerous escapades, I wonder how he's even still alive! The man hijacked a radio station to denounce corrupt election results. He smuggled himself into the basement of the British Museum to retrieve a piece of stolen treasure precious to his tribe. He survived pronouncements of death sentences by escaping Nigeria on motorbike. He crossed war zones to attempt to broker peace deals with Biafra and Nigeria. And there is so much more! Having the opportunity to honour Prof Soyinka in his 90th birthday season will be a career highlight for me. I am grateful to the Wole Soyinka International Cultural Exchange ( WSICE) under the leadership of Dr Teju Kareem for the gift of partnership. I hope you can join us for some of the events. And if you or your company would like to be a sponsor of the programme or any of the events, please let me know. #WoleSoyinka #NobelPrize #TheAfricaCentre #Africa #literature #HumanRights #SocialJustice"
