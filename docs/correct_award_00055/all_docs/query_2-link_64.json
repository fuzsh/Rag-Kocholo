His involvement over the previous quarter of a century had alerted his compatriots to the shortcomings of those in power and with responsibilities. For some younger Nigerians and for those outside the educational system, he had become particularly well known because of his efforts to reduce the number of accidents on the nation’s roads. Many people were, of course, aware of his varied and impressive achievements as a writer: he had many enthusiastic and discriminating admirers, and he exerted a major influence on younger generations of creative Nigerians. He also had his critics. Some of those on the Left considered him irresponsible and ideologically suspect, and some nationalists and “decolonizers” condemned him for allowing Western models to influence his writing. Soyinka insisted that his receiving the Nobel Prize should be seen as an award to the continent of Africa as a whole, but some regarded that as an indication, or as a further indication, of Soyinka’s appeal to a European audience.\n\nSoyinka’s distinction as a writer, particularly as a playwright and poet, had also become apparent to many Africans outside Nigeria who had encountered his work on the stage or in the classroom. His writings had been featured extensively on course syllabi—evidence of endeavors to come to terms with African experiences—and African academics had examined his work from a variety of angles. Beyond the educational system, some had become aware of his interest in Pan-Africanist issues, his firmly held conviction that African intellectuals should be concerned about developments in the continent, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nHis being awarded various honors and his plays being favorably received in Europe and the United States reflect Soyinka’s standing among academics and theater people on other continents. His work embodies a profound knowledge of the European intellectual tradition as well as a deep awareness of Yoruba attitudes and aesthetics. The Swedish Academy described him as “a writer who in a wide cultural perspective and with poetic overtones fashions the drama of existence.” More than any other single award, the Nobel Prize elevated Soyinka to a position of international prominence from which he could make his voice heard on social and political issues, and it provided him with opportunities to realize new creative projects. The award came after a period of five years during which Soyinka had produced some intense political dramas and a book of childhood memories, Aké (1981), which had made an impact on many who might never have read his poetry or seen his plays. Aké brought him wide recognition but also, from those who take a different stand on social and political issues, criticism.\n\nAkinwande Oluwole Soyinka was born in Abeokuta, in Western Nigeria, on 13 July 1934; he was the second child and eldest son of Samuel Ayodele (Ayo) and Grace Eniola Soyinka. His father, dubbed “Essay” in Aké, was principal of St. Peter’s Primary School, and his mother, nicknamed “Wild Christian” in Aké, was a teacher and became involved in agitation against the Alake, the local officeholder through whom the British ruled. Ayo Soyinka’s hometown, an ancestral base with which he maintained links throughout his life, was Isara, in the Ijebu part of Yoruba-speaking Western Nigeria. Wole Soyinka spent holidays there during his childhood and thus came in contact with a relatively isolated community, one that had managed to keep British colonial influences at arm’s length. Abeokuta, by contrast, was a refugee settlement, founded during the 1830s by a variety of mostly Egba groups fleeing southward before aggressors from the north. The town retained considerable political independence for decades; only after World War I did it become part of the British colony of Nigeria. But it was open to religious and economic influences. Beginning in the 1840s Christian missions established churches and schools there, and it gradually became an important trading center for the region. Abeokuta, particularly in its religious and commercial life, provided an example of creative syncretism that deeply impressed the young Soyinka. His mother was a member of one of the most distinguished families in the town. She was closely related to I. O. Ransome-Kuti, pioneering headmaster of Abeokuta Grammar School, whose wife, Funmilayo, played a decisive role in local and national politics. For the young Soyinka, the Ransome-Kuti family exemplified creative endeavor and political action.\n\nAt age eleven Soyinka left Abeokuta for Ibadan, where he completed his secondary education at the well-equipped Government College. After a brief period working as a clerk in Lagos, he returned to Ibadan, this time to the recently established University College to begin undergraduate courses. In 1954, at the end of his second year, he was awarded a scholarship to study English literature in the United Kingdom and took a place at the University of Leeds. He was awarded a B.A. in 1957 and started work on an M.A. He then moved to London, where he was encouraged by the directors at the Royal Court Theatre and gained valuable practical experience. He has since continued to move between universities and theaters, using the relative security of academia to work on creative challenges, always remaining his own man, resisting temptations to compromise and resolutely refusing to remain silent in the face of tyranny.\n\nOn 1 January 1960 Soyinka returned to Ibadan to accept a research post at University College and to contribute to the development of West African drama. Two years later he was made a lecturer at the newly founded University College of Ife, and then, after a break, he was promoted to a senior lectureship at the University of Lagos. In 1967 he was appointed director of the School of Drama at the University of Ibadan but was soon arrested and imprisoned for his political activity during the Nigerian civil war. After his release in 1969 he spent some time at Ibadan before leaving the country for visiting professorships, at Churchill College, Cambridge (1972–1973); at the University of Sheffield (1973–1974); and then at the Institute of African Studies, part of the University of Ghana. He returned to Nigeria, to a professorship at the University of Ife, in 1976 and remained there, with numerous absences to attend conferences, deliver papers, and direct plays, until 1985. During the mid and late 1980s he held visiting professorships at some American universities, including Yale and Cornell, and continued to find and make time to write, direct, and contribute to conferences and workshops in Nigeria and elsewhere.\n\nHis pattern of employment shows Soyinka moving between the classroom and the theater, his position and attitude often affected by the tumultuous political developments in Nigeria and black Africa during the last thirty years. These developments have included the nationalist movements’ agitation for independence; the tensions in the Western Region of Nigeria during the early 1960s, which resulted in the imposition of a state of emergency; the corruption and rigging that characterized the Nigerian elections of 1964; the rise and fall of Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana; the January 1966 coup in Nigeria and the counter coup that followed; the massacres of Igbos in the Northern Region and the drift toward the secession of Biafra and civil war; Idi Amin’s and Macias Nguema’s reigns of terror in Uganda and Equatorial Guinea; the scandals of the Second Nigerian Republic; the repressive tone of the Buhari regime, which followed the coup of December 1983; and the restrictive elements that, in the late 1980s, crept into the Babangida regime.\n\nSoyinka has returned again and again to particular themes and areas of interest in his work. These have included the responsibilities of the individual, the vigorous influence of the past on contemporary events, and the value of making a willing sacrifice. He has also campaigned against individuals and groups who have betrayed the trust placed in them and abused the privileges of office.\n\nAs a schoolboy, clerk, and student in Nigeria, Soyinka wrote poetry, short stories, and brief plays. He prepared sketches for production in school and pioneered Nigerian radio drama. At Leeds he deepened and broadened his awareness of Western literary and theatrical traditions and responded to the challenges of teachers such as George Wilson Knight and Arnold Kettle. He wrote witty, subversive short stories that attacked British insensitivity and ignorance about Africa; he campaigned against the South African policy of apartheid; and he gained valuable experience working as a reporter, interviewer, and presenter for the BBC during the late 1950s.\n\nToward the end of his time at Leeds, probably in 1957 and 1958, he wrote The Swamp Dwellers (in Three Plays, 1963), a drama triggered by reports of the extent of Nigeria’s reserves of oil. The play was produced in London (1958) and Ibadan (1959) and stimulated debates, which still continue, about Soyinka’s intentions as a playwright: Should he be regarded primarily as a poetic or a political dramatist? Is he most interested in conveying mood, in exploring the effectiveness of ritual sacrifice, or in motivating the masses to improve their conditions? Is he writing for intimate “art” theaters or for his fellow countrymen? The Swamp Dwellers works through contrasts and juxtapositions but shows an uncertainty that marks it as an apprentice work, an interesting failure that carries too clearly the marks of Soyinka’s reading in his “World Drama” class at Leeds.\n\nThe Lion and the Jewel, from the same period (produced in 1959, published in 1963), is part of a dialogue with the European tradition of comedy and with Eurocentric views of Africa—specifically with Joyce Cary’s novel Mister Johnson (1939). Set in a village called Ilujinle, the play presents the clash between the seventy-two-year-old Bale Baroka and the young schoolmaster, Lakunle, for the village belle, Sidi. Intrigue and fine— and merely bombastic—speeches are combined with elaborate passages of mime and dance. The wily Baroka completely outmaneuvers his opponent, and by so doing he challenges preconceptions, not least preconceptions about elderly people. Although demanding numerous skills from the performers, the play has been successfully produced in schools and colleges in Africa, Europe, and America, and it is among Soyinka’s best-known works. The 1966–1967 production at the Royal Court Theatre in London was a landmark in the recognition of Soyinka as a significant English-language dramatist. Some of those who have responded to the productions and those who have written about the text have been confused by the openness that is a feature of much of Soyinka’s stagecraft, and they have been uncertain how to interpret this relatively straightforward play. Many have jumped to the conclusion that Baroka represents tradition and that Soyinka is being reactionary in allowing him to win Sidi. Closer examination within the context of Soyinka’s ideas indicates that Baroka is a discriminating syncretist taking what he considers useful from outsiders and combining it with the virtues and privileges in the indigenous culture. Lakunle, the challenger, has considerable vitality and some creativity, but he is, by contrast, undiscriminating and infatuated with foreign novelties. While in some respects a challenge to European ideas about Africa and about the role played by Europeans in Africa—there is a revealing episode in which a venal white surveyor appears—the play is a contribution to the debate that preoccupied many Nigerians in the years preceding independence, about how imported and indigenous elements were to be “married” in the new, independent nation. An important element in Soyinka’s creative and intellectual makeup derives from the debates among African intellectuals during the 1950s; his writing frequently reflects an awareness of tradition and a flair for incorporating foreign ideas. There remains something of Baroka in Soyinka, and he continues to find inspiration in controversy.\n\nIn London during 1958 and 1959 Soyinka made contact with the BBC and wrote scripts for both the domestic and overseas services. He also did some part-time teaching in London day schools. An evening of political, semi-improvised drama in the tradition of the Living Newspaper, presented at the Royal Court’s Theatre Upstairs during 1959, provided Soyinka with an opportunity to sing songs he had composed. One, with the refrain “Long Time, Bwana,” articulated, in an easily accessible folk idiom, the resentment of an exploited African worker. Soyinka’s considerable musical talents include composition, guitar playing, and singing, and the interweaving of musical with dramatic elements is a distinctive feature of his work. He has explored the capacity of music and song to make an impact on popular audiences and has found his songwriting abilities particularly valuable in attempting to communicate political opinions to mass audiences.\n\nIn November 1959 Soyinka directed an evening of his own work at the Theatre Upstairs. The first half of the program consisted of poetry and extracts from “A Dance of the African Forest” (unpublished); the second was an antiracist play, The Invention (also unpublished). By the time he mounted the production, Soyinka had already started publishing poems in Nigerian publications, and his range as a poet went far beyond the dramatic monologue: he was experimenting with a variety of poetic styles. The program contained some poems that are now familiar, including “Telephone Conversation” (in A Book of African Verse, 1964) and “Alagemo,” which appears as a prefatory poem to the published version of The Road (1965). The program also included a few Yoruba folk songs and Negro spirituals, which helped to define the parameters within which Soyinka was seeking his voice as a poet. Some of Soyinka’s poetry is densely textured, highly allusive, convoluted, even verbose, but to argue—as some do—as if all his poetry is in this style is to miss the variety of his output. Of the poems recited or sung at the Royal Court in 1959, only “Deserted Markets” and “Abiku” are in his first published collection of verse, Idanre & Other Poems (1967)—a succinct comment on the scope of the collection and a warning to those tempted to generalize on the basis of the thin volumes of poetry Soyinka has published in London and New York.\n\nThe Invention, a heavy-handed attack on racist notions, is set in South Africa after a nuclear explosion has turned everyone a pasty gray color. South African scientists have been commissioned to produce a means of finding out who had been “Bantu,” “Coloured,” and “White” before the mutation. The thin story line, which appears to owe certain elements to Hans Christian Andersen’s 1837 fairy tale “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” does not adequately sustain the satire, which includes American, British, and South African bigots among its targets, and Soyinka has not included the play in any collections. He takes his role as a writer seriously and tries to fulfill many functions in this play and others. From time to time he uses his pen to attack specific targets, usually by exposing them to ridicule, in the hope that he will sway the wavering and stiffen the resolve of the committed. He has long felt passionately about South Africa and is acutely aware of the problems faced by the outsider who wants to write about conditions in that country.\n\nToward the end of his stay in England, Soyinka submitted a research proposal to the Rockefeller Foundation. He drew attention to what he considered the major issues confronting the African dramatist who endeavored to combine the “strong aesthetic awareness of traditional art” with dramatic conventions developed elsewhere. He anticipated the fusion of “the idiom beneath traditional drama” with other idioms, and he referred in passing to Japanese No theater and commended Bertolt Brecht as “the truly modern dramatist who has perpetuated the morality/parable as a dramatic form.” There is evidence in Soyinka’s interviews, critical writing, and plays that he has consciously endeavored to combine African, particularly Yoruba, forms with the European tradition of dialogue drama. He has published critical and theoretical writing, some of it clear and direct, some obscure, which provides a theoretical justification for his own experiments, has expressed an admiration for elements in Brecht’s work on several occasions, and has drawn on his poems and plays for ideas and conventions. In Opera Wonyosi (performed, 1977; published, 1981) Soyinka used The Threepenny Opera (1929; translated, 1964) as the basis for an attack on the vices of his country and his continent.\n\nHis proposal was accepted by the foundation, and Soyinka returned, with his research grant, to Nigeria in 1960, the year in which the country became independent. He immediately threw himself into the creative activities of the country, particularly those in Lagos and Ibadan and those associated with University College and the Nigerian Broadcasting Service. He gave radio talks, acted in a production of Brecht’s Good Woman of Setiuan (1943; translated, 1948), published poetry, performed at concerts organized by the American Society for African Culture (AMSAC), and became secretary of the Committee of Writers for Individual Liberty. He also wrote plays for radio, television, and the stage. As was expected of him by his Rockefeller sponsors and University College, Ibadan, he undertook research into West African drama, but writing it up was not given priority.\n\nThe Trials of Brother Jero (performed, 1960; published in Three Plays), his best-known work of this period, was written, or rewritten, at short notice, in response to a request for a play that could be performed in a converted dining hall in Ibadan. Drawing on his observation of the separatist Christian churches of Nigeria, on Ijebu folk narratives, and on theatrical conventions exploited by Brecht, Soyinka put together a vital and vigorous comedy, which contains a stark warning to a country on the eve of independence and a more general message about gullibility and false leaders. The negative reactions of those critics who regarded the play as an attack on Christianity have not endured. Indeed, because separatist sects are familiar throughout the continent and because the theatrical idioms employed are acceptable and exciting, the play has become a favorite with school, college, and community-center audiences throughout anglophone Africa. Productions in London and New York, sometimes with additional, topical references, have shown that the appeal of the play extends far beyond the continent of its birth. Aware of the vitality of the central character, and of the advantages of using a popular figure in order to make a series of social and political comments, Soyinka has written at least one other play in which Jero is featured, Jero’s Metamorphosis (published in The Jero Plays, 1973; performed, 1974).\n\nThe approach of independence made Nigerians particularly self-conscious, keenly aware of the possibilities for growth and change offered by the change of status. Soyinka presented two other plays to his countrymen in 1960; a radio play titled Camwood on the Leaves (published in 1973); and a national drama, A Dance of the Forests (performed, 1960; published in 1963), partly a reworking of “A Dance of the African Forest.”\n\nSoyinka has described Camwood on the Leaves as an attempt to use “the idiom of the masquerade in auditory terms.” Set in a community like that in which Soyinka grew up, in which conflicts between Christian groups and followers of Egungun (native-religion) processions could divide families, the play explores the relationship between the Reverend Erinjobi and his son Isola. The drama unfolds with masterly control and important local details, accompanied by the effective use of the singing of the dirge “Agbe.” In the closing moments Isola kills, or “sacrifices,” his father, and the dirge wells up. The play can be seen as a rite of passage, with implications for a nation at a time of transition. It can also be regarded as an essay in tragedy: a dramatic statement of particular importance to those, mostly European, observers who had denied the existence of an African sense of tragedy. Camwood on the Leaves contains several of the ingredients found in German playwright Frank Wedekind’s Awakening of Spring (1891; translated, 1909), notably the repercussions of a youthful pregnancy, but the perspective of the community presented in Soyinka’s play is distinctively and challengingly different. After being broadcast during September 1960, Camwood on the Leaves lay neglected for many years. Often disregarded by those writing on Soyinka, it deserves consideration particularly for the way it uses sound, for its evocation of a divided community, and for the manner in which it establishes a dialogue between two traditions. Soyinka’s own interest in the play led to its publication in 1973 and his decision to stage it at the National Theatre in Lagos in March 1982.\n\nAs the similarities between the titles suggest, A Dance of the Forests is closely linked with “A Dance of the African Forest,” extracts from which formed part of Soyinka’s Royal Court evening. But whereas the London production was directed at the racist regime in South Africa, the latter play is directed at Nigeria; indeed, it draws on encounters with the politicians who were about to inherit power from the British. This “independence” play shows an awareness of the capacity of leaders to exploit those they lead, and it warns that euphoria at a change in national status “should,” in the playwright’s words, “be tempered by the reality of the eternal history of oppression.” A major theme in the play concerns the difficulties involved in making “new beginnings,” but there is much more. The cast list includes human beings and supernatural entities; the action incorporates rites, masques, a flashback, and a series of dances; there are also references to a variety of European dramas. Not surprisingly, Soyinka encountered numerous difficulties in mounting the production. Some of these were the result of extraneous factors (some members of the cast lived in Lagos, some in Ibadan; official support was reduced when the local implications of the play became apparent); others grew out of the text and the demands it made on the cast. As a result certain elements in the original text had to be abandoned—as the existence of alternative endings in various versions makes clear. A Dance of the Forests remains extraordinarily ambitious, a young man’s endeavor, full of themes that were to be more effectively worked out in his later writing.\n\nReviews of the premiere indicate that members of the first audiences were bewildered. Soyinka has claimed that it was the culturally alienated—the sort of people who wrote reviews—who found the play difficult, and he has maintained that “ordinary” members of the audience, the cooks and cleaners who allowed themselves to respond to the unfolding of the stage images without intellectualizing, returned to watch the production night after night. Since publication of the play, critical debate has continued about its meaning and significance. The play can be seen as an attempt to combine Yoruba traditions of festival drama with European traditions of dialogue drama, and the themes of expiation and purification are, with Soyinka’s grim warning about the “recurrent cycle of stupidities,” central. In a world in which envy and wickedness are often dominant, the possibility of establishing harmony may, Soyinka suggests, come from a recognition of past failures, from suffering, and from a willingness to assert oneself in a responsible manner on behalf of the community.\n\nA Dance of the Forests reveals Soyinka’s ambition and the range of dramatic sources, both African and European, which he can draw on in his creative endeavors. The history of the first production shows the limitations, both human and political, which sometimes have restrained him. The critical response indicates the haste with which some critics reject him and the seriousness with which others take him. There has been speculative comment about the Nigerian reception of Soyinka’s plays in performance. Text-based criticism has often failed to appreciate the delight Nigerian audiences take in watching Soyinka’s plays, and this situation suggests that weight should be given to Soyinka’s observation about “ordinary” members of the audience.\n\nTwelve years after his independence-year production of A Dance of the Forests, Soyinka directed extracts from the play in Paris, and reports suggest that he brought to the production a strong hand, establishing a firm sense of ritual and carefully controlled, stylized effects. Since he is an accomplished and experienced director, there is a sense in which his plays exist most authoritatively when he directs them.\n\nConfronting the challenges posed by directing A Dance of the Forests in 1960 did not sap Soyinka’s creative energies, and the early 1960s continued to be a time of exceptional productivity. He wrote for television and radio and undertook research into West African drama. Two of his television plays reveal the tremendous range of his writing: My Father’s Burden (August 1960) is a naturalistic drama in which issues of ethnic differences, corruption, and, once again, the possibility of breaking with the past provide central interests in a play set among the bourgeoisie of Lagos. Night of the Hunted, the first part of a projected trilogy titled “The House of Banigeji,” was telecast during November 1961. An extract from the trilogy had appeared in the 1959 Royal Court performance, and portions of the second part, titled The Exiles, were published in the anthology Reflections (1962). The play shows how the curse of a dying mother is fulfilled despite flight from Nigeria to London to evade it. Written in a variety of styles, “The House of Banigeji” was on Soyinka’s desk for a long time and, perhaps, never reached a form that satisfied him. Furthermore, the conditions under which he worked at the Nigerian Television studio at Ibadan were frustrating: for instance, the transmission of My Father’s Burden was delayed by an hour because of a power cut, and as a result some members of the potential audience missed it. The importance of the plays for television is that they show a young dramatist anxious to exploit every available means of communicating with his fellow countrymen. “The House of Banigeji” is, in fact, a potentially important text that should be rescued from near oblivion.\n\nDuring 1961 Soyinka was committed to writing scripts for a weekly radio comedy series, Broke-Time Bar, which ran for many months and was a cross between a situation comedy and a soap opera. Eventually, Soyinka’s desire to introduce what he called “astringent political comment” into the series brought him into conflict with administrators and politicians; he then stopped working on the program, which came to an end. The scripts indicate Soyinka’s skill at putting together popular comedies and at creating variations on mistaken identities and farcical confusions. Broke-Time Bar provided Soyinka with a means of communication and with additional income; it also enabled him to bring together and keep together a group of young people who wanted to become professional actors. A Dance of the Forest had been put on by “The 1960 Masks,” largely made up from the professional classes. Soyinka wanted to go further and to encourage younger people who could give more time to acting. To this end he formed the Orisun Theatre company, a major effort in the campaign to sustain a reliable group of actors and an effort that was encouraged by Broke-Time Bar.\n\nDuring 1960 and 1961, as a Rockefeller research fellow, Soyinka was in a rather unusual position within the structure of University College, Ibadan; he was a postgraduate student at a time when University College was made up almost entirely of undergraduates or staff members. The grant provided him with considerable freedom, and he was entitled to a Land Rover and a mileage allowance. During his time as a researcher Soyinka observed rituals and performances in Nigeria, Ghana, and the Ivory Coast, and he attended conferences in Europe and the United States. He also spent some time in libraries reading old issues of Nigeria Magazine and Nigerian Field, he kept abreast of the work Ulli Beier was publishing on Yoruba festivals, and he thought about the essential ingredients of African, and more precisely Yoruba, theater.\n\nWithin Soyinka there has always been a tension between the academic and the man of the theater, the critic and the creator, the analyst and the writer. Despite excursions into academic, critical, and analytical writing, he is basically and most importantly a creative writer, and his conduct as a research student indicates his own recognition of his aptitudes. It was expected that he would write a book based on his research, but the book does not seem to have been completed. He did, however, gather material for a paper and for subsequent writing. The paper, titled “The African Approach to Drama,” was delivered at a UNESCO-sponsored conference on African culture held at Ibadan during December 1960 and was an artist’s manifesto, which, in some lights, sounded like a research paper. He dispensed with the formalities of academic papers but drew on reading and observation, and on an essentially comparative approach. Soyinka is constantly seeking and finding parallels, both within and outside the field of African drama; he feels similarities and is sensitive to affinities with other traditions of drama. He was, in the paper, more concerned to state a position than to argue a case. “Dramaturgically,” Soyinka asserted, “the African is an instinctively metaphorical artist, eschewing the plain historical restatement for a symbolic ritual.” Much of the paper was personal, idiosyncratic, and impressionistic; it ultimately said more about his approach to drama than about “the African approach to drama.”\n\nIn his plays, among other concerns, he is particularly interested in symbolic ritual. The play that appears to owe most to Soyinka’s period as a research student, one that is worth more than any monograph on West African drama that he might have written, is The Strong Breed (published in Three Plays; performed, 1966). It contrasts two purification rituals, one highly stylized, the other comparatively unsophisticated. Soyinka seems to borrow structural features from Eugene O’Neill’s Emperor Jones (1920) in order to explore the conduct of Eman, a member of “the strong breed,” one of those who bear the burdens of the community. The chronological sequence of events is scrambled and can be confusing, but the dramatic contrasts, the oppressive mood, and the challenge to Eman’s will that Soyinka establishes help to make this a compelling drama. Though short, The Strong Breed stands near the center of his achievement as a dramatist, clarifying ideas about sacrifice that had been obscure in A Dance of the Forest, employing ritual for dramatic effect, exploring the position of the individual, and continuing a dialogue with Christianity and with the Western theatrical tradition.\n\nDuring the early 1960s Soyinka prepared an abbreviated version of The Strong Breed, and that version formed part of the movie Culture in Transition (1964). The play has since been produced professionally in New York (1967) and London (1968), has been translated into French, has been produced by Nigerian students, and has attracted amateur groups in several anglophone African countries. Its appeal is not nearly as immediate as The Trials of Brother Jero, but it remains an invaluable introduction to serious themes in Soyinka’s work.\n\nSoyinka combined his writing with his other contributions to the vigorous development of Nigerian cultural life that characterized the early 1960s. He shared in enterprises with other Nigerian literary figures of his generation, such as Chinua Achebe, J. P. Clark, and Christopher Okigbo, and with some of them he attended the Writers’ Conference held at Makerere, Uganda, during June 1962. There he criticized negritude (though not for the first time), advocating that African writers accept their African background and feel free to respond to experiences originating outside the continent. He expressed this attitude by reportedly saying, “The tiger does not proclaim his tigritude, he pounces.” Some critics have demanded that African writers should strive to eliminate non-African images and influences from their work and have taken Soyinka to task for this attitude. His debate with nationalists, chauvinists, and “decolonizers”—whom Soyinka sometimes calls “Neo-Tarzanists” or “throwback activists”—continues.\n\nIn 1962 Soyinka began his career as a university lecturer at University College, Ife. But the following year he resigned, disgusted at the weakness shown by the authorities of the college in the face of political pressure. He has never been averse to making the most of a potentially dramatic situation—some regard him as impetuous—and has always been prepared to put his principles above his well-being. The struggle for power between Nigerian political parties and their leaders during the early 1960s led to the erosion of academic freedom and provided a test of his commitment to human rights. Temporarily cut off from any base at a university, Soyinka worked with amateur and professional theater groups to bring together a season of plays in English and Yoruba. He began producing plays he thought were particularly relevant to his contemporaries, and he cultivated links with the vigorous Yoruba traveling theater companies. He had been interested in these companies for some years, supported their efforts in various ways, and drew inspiration from the skills and styles they cultivated.\n\nThe political and human tensions Soyinka had drawn attention to in his plays of 1960—such as the gullibility of the people, the hypocrisy of leaders, and the difficulties involved in making a new beginning-became increasingly apparent. Eventually, the federal government found an excuse to declare a state of emergency in the Western Region. To Soyinka and other Nigerian intellectuals, the country appeared to be following the trend set elsewhere in Africa toward repression, a one-party state, and dictatorship.\n\nDuring 1965 Soyinka took a post as senior lecturer in English at the University of Lagos. His being hired was probably based on recognition of his creative rather than his scholarly achievements. In Lagos he watched the challenges to democratic institutions grow stronger, and, because of censorship, he experienced difficulties in communicating his ideas. With the 1960 Masks, Orisun Theatre, and Yemi Lijadu he gave his genius for satire full rein in working on a series of revues: The Republican (1963), The (New) Republican (1964), and Before the Blackout (1965; published circa 1972). Through them he attacked a variety of targets, including opportunist politicians, corrupt timeservers, and cynical manipulators, exposing clearly identifiable individuals to ridicule and providing a commentary on the state of the nation since independence. Some of the more literary sketches from the revues were subsequently published under the title Before the Blackout (probably in 1965, though the book is not dated). They reveal Soyinka’s skills as a songwriter and satirist as well as his confidence that the writer can sway the audience. His strategy in the revues was to identify and pillory individuals who in his opinion had behaved irresponsibly. Critics from the Left have sometimes challenged this approach, regarding it as focusing on symptoms and neglecting causes, but Soyinka has changed little over the years. Given the vigor of the Marxist school of criticism in Nigeria and the wide distribution of other Marxists, it seems probable that this debate, like that over negritude, will continue.\n\nThe year 1965 was also marked by the publication of Soyinka’s first novel, The Interpreters; the first public reading by him of his long major poem Idanre; the premiere of The Road at the Theatre Royal Stratford East in London; and the opening of Kongi’s Harvest at Independence Hall in Lagos. Soyinka has described The Interpreters, on which he must have worked for an extended period during the early 1960s, as “an attempt to capture a particular moment in the lives of a generation which was trying to find its feet after Independence.” The novel has a complex structure and dense passages of descriptive prose, which have alienated some readers and some critics. The structure may indeed be disconcerting, but it is also intriguing, especially when one understands that narrative in Soyinka’s creative world is only one way in which a piece of work can be held together. He has always maintained his right to communicate with different groups at different times, to write adaptations of Yoruba folk songs in Yoruba, and to arrange a pattern of interrelated events for those, perhaps a far-flung elite, who respond to a challenging work of literature. The Interpreters marked an authoritative move into a genre new to Soyinka; and it quickly established itself as a classic of African writing. The momentum of the novel is sustained by the detailed portrayal of life in Lagos and Ibadan, particularly among the academic community, and by the vigorous satire at the expense of Nigerian newspapers.\n\nComposed, apparently, within a period of twenty-four hours, Idanre is a mythological poem on a scale and on themes for which little in Soyinka’s previous output had prepared readers. During the early 1960s he had continued his experiments with verse, and his works, often concerning gyres or cycles of history, had become increasingly assured. He carried over from Yoruba usage a delight in the manipulation of word, image, and idiom that sometimes pleases but other times becomes bombastic and anarchic. He is a mythopoet for whom Yoruba and other myths provide a means of coming to terms with and communicating experiences. In Idanre he works particularly on stories associated with the Yoruba mythological figures Ogun, Atunda, Sango, and Oya, and the Idanre Hills, within a tradition that, he argues, is resilient and syncretistic, a tradition in which new experiences are easily incorporated within an old framework. To illustrate the context in which he writes, Soyinka says in his notes to the volume that a statue of Sango, god of lightning, stands outside the offices of the Nigerian electricity supply company, and Ogun, the daring pioneer who made a road through a swamp that had divided gods from men, is regarded as “the primal motor mechanic.” Ogun, compounded of opposites, powerful, Promethean, daring, and dangerous to know, is Soyinka’s patron deity.\n\nSoyinka read Idanre at the Royal Court Theatre during the Commonwealth Arts Festival, in September 1965. The Road, though not an official Nigerian entry in the festival, was given a professional production that same month at the Theatre Royal Stratford East to coincide with the festival. Actors from a variety of backgrounds took part, and Soyinka contributed advice. The critics were divided in their response: several were taken aback by the mixture of the satirical and the spiritual, by the buried story line, and by the use of Yoruba rituals; but there was a widespread feeling that the production was stimulating and theatrically diverting. A few critics were of the opinion that Soyinka had made a major contribution to English-language theater. Literary critics, including Eldred D. Jones and Gerald Moore, have subsequently written of the published text (1965), and some have become embroiled in trying to explain the meaning of particular passages. Soyinka himself has drawn attention to the origin of the play in his interest in investigations into the transition from life to death, the groping to define the essence of death. He has also said that the play was originally conceived as a movie.\n\nThe Road is profoundly influenced by a Yoruba sense of the continuity between life and death and of the limits on human knowledge of the universe. Songs and rituals constantly break through the surface of the drama and draw attention to this Yoruba dimension. But in other respects The Road is the product of Nigerian experiences during the middle of the twentieth century, and it reflects the roles played by drugs, criminals, corrupt policemen, and unscrupulous politicians. Some of Soyinka’s critics have commented on the obscurity and complexity of this play, but others—notably some on the Left, including Biodun Jeyifo—have responded favorably to his treatment of economic and social issues.\n\nWhile in London to take part in the Commonwealth Arts Festival, Soyinka played Konu in a BBC radio play he had been commissioned to write, The Detainee (unpublished). Set in a prison in a recently independent African country, it reflects the profound concern with which African intellectuals viewed the developments that had followed independence in many African countries. The imaginary state in which The Detainee is set bears resemblances to Ghana, which Soyinka knew firsthand and which, under the leadership of Nkrumah, had carried many of the hopes of the continent. The introduction of repressive, antidemocratic measures had marked the end of Nkrumah’s honeymoon with African intellectuals, and in The Detainee Soyinka set out to show that the reality of independence had fallen short of the dream. The playwright’s prognostications had been proved right: the hopes that accompanied independence had been proved false. Independence was not a horn of plenty but a Pandora’s box full of political monsters and diseases.\n\nKongi’s Harvest (performed, 1965; published, 1967), also draws on contemporary political developments; it combines particular and topical allusions with comments applicable to various countries. The play was apparently inspired by Hastings Banda, president of Malawi, saying that he wanted a particular opponent brought to him dead or alive. Other African leaders alluded to include Nigerian politicians and, more controversially, Nkrumah. But perennial Soyinkan concerns, such as his interests in the possibility of change and in the conflict between the forces of life and the forces of death, lie at the heart of the play. The 1965 production in Lagos seems to have emphasized certain links between the megalomaniac Kongi, autocratic ruler of Ismaland, and Nkrumah. The play is built, in a manner characteristic of Soyinka, around an interrupted ritual, in this case the ritual associated with the harvest of yams, and casts Kongi as a barren, hate-filled tyrant determined to usurp the right of traditional ruler Oba Danlola to receive “the first fruit” of the new crop. Danlola resists the political pressure from the new head of state and supports the vital challenge to Kongi launched by the characters Daodu and Segi. Daodu, an educated farmer and Danlola’s heir, and Segi, the mysterious female owner of a nightclub and the organizer of a women’s group, arrange for Kongi to be shot during the New Yam Festival, but their plan goes awry when the assassin is killed. Segi then improvises a ceremonial dance in which Kongi is presented with the assassin’s head, a gesture showing that Kongi is a harvester of death. Part 2 ends this way in the printed version of the play, but in his productions Soyinka has experimented with a variety of stage actions at this point. And he has on occasion omitted the final section of the published version, “Hangover,” in which three of the characters respond to the public humiliation of the despot.\n\nSome critics have condemned the play for what they regard as its disrespectful portrait of Nkrumah, others for Soyinka’s failure to clarify the narrative line. (What exactly are Daodu and Segi planning?) Soyinka has also been accused of other crimes with an ideological dimension, of mystification, of selecting an elitist hero (Daodu) rather than a man of the people, and of adding yet another seductive “superwoman” (Segi) to his list of female stereotypes.\n\nShortly after returning to Nigeria from the Commonwealth Arts Festival, Soyinka was tried for holding up a radio station and stealing tapes. The trial grew out of an incident in which an intruder, angry at the way regional elections had been conducted and the way S. L. Akintola had been declared the winner, entered the radio station at Ibadan and, at gunpoint, forced the acting head of programs to remove Akintola’s taped victory address and substitute a tape the intruder had brought with him. According to an observer sent to cover the trial for Amnesty International, the intruder’s tape began, “This is the Voice of Free Nigeria,” and went on to advise Akintola and his followers to “quit the country.” The opening sentences of the intruder’s tape had been broadcast before a vigilant employee of the broadcasting service interrupted transmission. The Nigerian police declared Soyinka a wanted man, and in due course he gave himself up, was denied bail, and, with legal help, defended himself against the charges. The courtroom exchanges and other events—Soyinka went on hunger strike at one point—guaranteed extensive newspaper coverage and placed the playwright at the center of the national stage. Eventually, on the grounds that there were material contradictions in the evidence against him, he was acquitted in December 1965 and carried shoulder-high from the court.\n\nSoyinka is a political activist as well as a writer: he regards it as his duty to take a part in influencing the direction taken by Nigeria. He articulated his commitment to political action in his seminal address to the First African-Scandinavian Writers’ Conference, held at Stockholm during 1967. Toward the end of his paper (“The Writer in a Modern African State”) he declared, “The artist has always functioned in African society as the record of the mores and experience of his society and as the voice of vision in his own time.” Over the years Soyinka has taken various roles in national life, and, in statements, papers, and essays, he has contributed to the debate about the role of the writer. The full story of the radio-station holdup has not yet been told, and Soyinka has been reluctant to comment on the judge’s verdict.\n\nThe months between Soyinka’s acquittal on the charge of holding up the radio station and his rearrest during August 1967, in connection with, among other things, an open letter he wrote about the Nigerian civil war, were momentous ones for Nigeria. There was a coup by radical and progressive officers who had the support of many Nigerian intellectuals, but the coup was subsequently presented to the nation as having been masterminded by a particular ethnic faction. It was followed by a countercoup launched by conservative forces, which brought Yakubu Gowon to power.\n\nDuring 1966 Soyinka revised his production of Kongi’s Harvest and went with it to Dakar, Senegal, for the Festival of Negro Arts. There he was awarded a prize for The Road, gave a paper on Nigerian theater titled “A Study in Tyranny and Individual Survival,” and sat on a panel concerned with African film. But his doubts about the philosophy that provided theoretical justification for the festival—negritude—remained. Subsequently, over a period of several years, he explored differences and common ground in conversations with Léopold Sédar Senghor.\n\nDuring this period he directed plays by local and foreign playwrights and channeled a considerable amount of creative energy into poetry. In 1966 he celebrated the “First Rite of the Harmattan Solstice” with a small, mimeographed (unpublished) collection of his verse, some of which may have been composed some years before. The titles suggest that some of these were written in Yoruba and in the form of Yoruba oriki (poems of praise). During the latter part of 1966 Soyinka’s poetry became more directly focused on events in Nigeria. In Idanre & Other Poems he subtitled one section “October ’66” and included in it poems that embody responses to scenes of violence and reports of massacres, which he places in a wider context. For example, in “Harvest of Hate,” meditating on the way the current situation had arisen, he writes:\n\nNow pay we forfeit on old abdications\n\nThe child dares flames his fathers lit\n\nAnd in the briefness of too bright flares\n\nShrivels a heritage of blighted futures\n\nThe relatively private response to events represented by the majority of the poems in the collection was complemented by outspoken contributions by Soyinka to the press. Public controversy was nothing new to him; he had reveled in the brisk exchanges of student politics and taken part in debates during his undergraduate days. Starting shortly after his return to his native land, he had written to the press on a variety of issues, including the quality of the first festival organized by AMSAC, the hazards encountered on Nigerian roads, the state of emergency, the need to adapt African dances for the stage, Ahmadu Bello’s My Life (1962) and the way Soyinka’s review of it (Daily Express, Lagos, 17 November 1962) was edited, preventive detention, and the sentencing of five northern women to one year in prison and eighty strokes of the lash for “insulting behavior.” His poem “For Segun Awolowo,” in memory of the son of a leading Western Region politician, also appeared in the press; though complex and metaphysical, it was widely appreciated and later collected as “In Memory of Segun Awolowo” in Idanre & Other Poems.\n\nDuring November 1966, following the massacres of Igbos and the announcements that a group of obas (Yoruba traditional rulers) was about to set out on a nationwide peace mission, Soyinka wrote “An Open Letter to the Western Obas” (Daily Times, Lagos). He made it clear that he regarded the peace mission as a purposeless charade, a confusionist tactic that would try to cover with words the wounds that only actions could heal. He coupled his criticism of the Obas with an attack on members of the Yoruba community in Zaria for the “un-Yoruba” manner in which they had expressed their thanks for being protected during disturbances. One of the obas responded in the same newspaper by saying that “Soyinka is a carbon-copy of Shakespeare. He is rather the modern Shakespeare of our time and he is entitled to his opinion.” Another said venomously and with the confidence that comes with age in some communities, “Soyinka is not seriously wishing to help the country. Being a small boy he could be childish in ideas.” In the correspondence columns of the newspaper during the days that followed the publication of the open letter, there were more critics than supporters of Soyinka’s position.\n\nUndaunted by the reaction to his first open letter, Soyinka wrote again during August 1967. At this stage the times were even tenser, and his style was appropriately more acerbic. By 4 August, when the letter appeared, Biafra had seceded from Nigeria; there were “Igbos Must Go” demonstrations in Lagos; rumors were circulating that Igbos were planning to blow up the city; and the Sunday Sketch newspaper had reported the capture of the city of Nsukka. Official accounts, however, were still talking of the conflict as a “police action.” Soyinka’s 4 August 1967 article, “Let’s Think of the Aftermath of This War,” was an appeal for a truce and a demand for plain speaking. It was also an attack on those he regarded as exploiting the confusion and chaos: “the now familiar brigade of professional congratulators, opportunists, patriots and other sordid racketeers who are riding high into positions of influence on the wave of hysteria and tribal hatred.” Soyinka was detained shortly after the letter was published and just after he had made a visit to Biafra and spoken to leaders there. Accusations were made against him. Although he spent twenty-seven months in prison, he was never charged, and, it seems, he was victimized because he raised his voice in the interests of peace and diplomacy.\n\nSoyinka has described his experience of detention in his prison notes, The Man Died (1972). This book should not be regarded as a comprehensive, factual account of the entire period Soyinka spent in prison but as a celebration of a creative response to detention. It contains thoughts about the nature of tragedy; poems; tributes to the resilience of fellow prisoners; and grotesque, amusing, poignant descriptions of people and events. There are also some word sketches of the artist as a political prisoner.\n\nWhile Soyinka was in prison, Idanre & Other Poems and The Forest of a Thousand Daemons: A Hunter’s Saga, his 1968 translation of D. O. Fagunwa’s Ogboju Ode Kinu Igbo Irunmale (1950), were published. Work on the translation had been in progress for several years and indicated Soyinka’s anxiety to make a distinguished Yoruba novel accessible to a wider readership. As a translator Soyinka is concerned with communicating the spirit of the original rather than with producing a faithfully literal version, and the book provides a focus for his ideas about language and the issues raised by translation.\n\nShortly before his arrest Soyinka had dispatched the essay “The Fourth Stage: Through the Mysteries of Ogun to the Origin of Yoruba Tragedy” to D. W.Jefferson, who was editing a festschrift in honor of Knight (The Morality of Art, 1969). It is not clear when this essay was composed or whether it was written with Jefferson’s collection in mind. Although sometimes tending toward an affectionate parody of Knight’s style, it provides considerable insight into the principles on which Soyinka has constructed his tragedies, principles that exploit the common ground between African and European experience. Central to Soyinka’s thinking about tragedy is the ritual root of the form and a selection of myths associated with Ogun, particularly the stories of how he built a road to link men and gods, and how, confused and drunk, he killed many of his friends and supporters. Soyinka maintains that Ogun worshipers reenact the deity’s crossing of the “transitional gulf.” In this essay, as elsewhere, Soyinka can be seen establishing his ideas in the course of a dialogue or a debate and finding, within the traditions of the Yoruba people, elements that echo his deeply held feelings. He recognizes, for example, that creative and destructive impulses are closely allied and are found together in the truly creative.\n\nAfter his release from detention Soyinka returned to the University of Ibadan as director of the School of Drama and took over a production of Kongi’s Harvest, which was in rehearsal. He gave the production an anti-military slant, and those who had previously recognized Nkrumah in Kongi now saw a portrait of the head of the Nigerian military junta, Gowon. In a program note Soyinka emphasized that the play was about a condition, “Kongism,” rather than about an individual. He maintained that “there are a thousand and more forms of Kongism—from the crude and blasphemous to the subtle and sanctimonious.”\n\nDuring the early months of 1970 Soyinka worked on and completed a film version of the play. He “opened out” the text, reshaped the plot, and provided opportunities for spectacular shots of Abeokuta and of Olumo Rock, which rises above the town. He played the role of Kongi himself, communicating an acute sense of spiritual exhaustion and occasionally calling to mind President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. Soyinka had long been interested in film as an art form and as a means of communication, but he was unhappy with the version of the movie that was released. He went so far as to dissociate himself from it, describing his performance as Kongi as “the extent of [his] participation.” The movie never made as deep an impact as the American and Nigerian backers, Calpenny-Omega, hoped it would, but, despite dismissive comments to the contrary, it is technically acceptable. Thematically, it is generally faithful to Soyinka’s scenario: the final image (of Segi’s father becoming a dictator) is not quite what Soyinka seems to have had in mind, but the implication that Kongism has not been dethroned and will not easily be overthrown comes across.\n\nBy July 1970 the shooting of the movie had finished, and Soyinka had obtained support from the University of Ibadan for proposals to establish a performing company attached to the university and to upgrade the School of Drama to a Department of Theatre Arts. Along with some of those who were to become deeply involved in the company and the department, he responded to an invitation from the Eugene O’Neill Memorial Theatre Center at Water-ford, Connecticut, to stay at the center and work on a bitter, sardonic play he had thought about and perhaps partly scripted while in prison, Madmen and Specialists (performed, 1970; published, 1971). In the excellent working conditions provided at the center, Soyinka wrote with a freedom that had rarely if ever been possible in Nigeria: passages were rewritten overnight; roles were expanded or reduced; sections were cut; and new material was added. Soyinka seems to have used the play as a means of “exorcising” his civil-war experiences, and it has been described by Abiola Irele as embodying “a passionate and consuming obsession with the problem of evil.” However, the play is not entirely bleak. Humor breaks through from time to time, although it is often grim or “sick”: smiles tend to come through clenched teeth. After putting on the play at the center and in some predominantly black neighborhoods in the United States, the group returned to Nigeria, where a revised version was staged during March 1971.\n\nThe invitation from America provided evidence of the growth of Soyinka’s international reputation, not only as a writer but increasingly as a director. Over the years Soyinka has built up a company of reliable, versatile performers who are in tune with the kind of theater he wants to create, and he was able to draw them together at Waterford, to alter his scripts in rehearsal to accommodate particular talents, and to cope with cast changes. The character Si Bero, for example, was originally a mother figure, not a sister figure, in Madmen, the alteration being necessitated by a change of actress.\n\nAfter the Nigerian production of Madmen and on the eve of the release of the movie of Kongi’s Harvest, Soyinka left Nigeria for what he intended to be a “brief exile” in Europe. He was away, in fact, for five years, during which time he resigned from his post at Ibadan and wrote, published, or prepared for publication an impressive list of books: A Shuttle in the Crypt, The Man Died, his adaptation The Bacchae of Euripides (1973), The Jero Plays (1973), Season of Anomy (1973), Poems of BlackAfrica (edited by Soyinka, 1975), Death and the King’s Horseman (1975), and Myth, Literature and the African World (1976). He also acted in Joan Littlewood’s May 1971 Paris production of Conor Cruise O’Brien’s Murderous Angels (published in 1969). The latter part of Soyinka’s exile was spent in Ghana, where he edited the journal Transition and was a prime mover in the formation of the Union of Writers of the African Peoples (UWAP).\n\nThe energy that went into this extraordinary creativity was released by the experiences of the Nigerian civil war, by the circumstances of his exile, and by his continued, but distanced, contact with Nigeria. A Shuttle in the Crypt, a volume of poetry, is a “map of the course trodden by the [poet’s] mind” during his imprisonment. One of the most controversial features of the collection is the extent to which he draws on Western modes and archetypes, particularly in the section that includes the creative interaction of the prisoner with such figures as Hamlet, Joseph, Ulysses, and Gulliver. Some critics have argued that the tribulations of incarceration drove Soyinka back to his foreign sources of inspiration, others that the imprisonment represented an abyss into which the poet, like Ogun, descended and in which, again like Ogun, he triumphed by asserting himself.\n\nThe Man Died carried Soyinka’s fame and opinions far beyond the literary circles that reacted to A Shuttle in the Crypt: it was read as a contribution to Nigerian studies, widely reviewed, and much discussed. Apparently, it was conceived as two books and can be seen as an unusual combination of a hard-hitting political expose and a prison memoir, with poetry and literary thoughts. Soyinka wrote part of the book to straighten the record regarding the background to his imprisonment, but other elements in it reveal the range of his interests and the variety of his concerns. Central to the political aspect of the book is the reference to the so-called Third Force, which Soyinka, apparently, supported. The significance of this group has not yet been adequately indicated. Indeed, historians and political scientists who have written about the civil war have generally found little or no space for discussion of the group, its political philosophy, its modus operandi, or its impact. Soyinka boldly—or rashly—“named names” in the book, and Rex Collings, a London publisher and friend, took some risk in publishing it. Sales in Nigeria were not as high as had been hoped, partly because of the distribution problems of the book trade in that country, partly because booksellers were discouraged from stocking it. Some years later another effort to keep the book from the Nigerian reading public was successful when Femi Okunnu, one of those named, sued the African publisher, the University of Lagos Press, resulting in an order to withdraw all copies from the shops. By that time, however, The Man Died had become an established part of the literature on the Nigerian civil war. (The court case was eventually settled many years later, and Soyinka was ordered to pay a small amount in damages.) Soyinka’s book is provocative and couched in characteristically strong, sometimes hyperbolic, terms. Though these words are not out of place in the hectic badinage that is the current coin of much Nigerian public debate, they seem self-indulgent when encountered beyond the nation’s boundaries. The title, incidentally, is taken from a telegram concerning the fate of an innocent man at the hands of the agents of the new rulers of Nigeria. It also calls to mind Soyinka’s conviction that “the man dies” in all who keep silent in the face of tyranny.\n\nSeason of Anomy, Soyinka’s second novel, takes central concerns from The Interpreters and selects a new moment at which to consider the choices confronting those working for change. Fast moving, readable, and mythological—links are established with the myths of Orpheus and Euridice—the novel presents claims of a harmonious community (Aiyero), the appeal of a cold-blooded assassin (Isola Demakin), and the responses of the artist-media man (Ofeyi). Some critics have objected to what they consider the chauvinistic presentation of the major female character, to the use of a Greek mythological source, and to the lushness of some of the writing. Others have tended to downplay the forceful evocation of the brutality of civil war and the intellectual debate about the responsibility of the individual.\n\nSoyinka spent most of 1972 in Europe, and during the academic year 1973–1974 he held a fellowship at Churchill College, Cambridge. While there, he delivered a series of lectures subsequently published under the title Myth, Literature and the African World. They combine lucid criticism of specific texts with discussions that reveal the scope of Soyinka’s acquaintance with literary and theatrical traditions and his search for an idiosyncratic perspective. The lectures were given in the anthropology department, a fact that provides an insight into the authorities’ attitudes toward African studies and reveals that the struggle to have African creativity recognized had yet to be won in certain contexts. The existence of these contexts explains the polemical nature of some of Soyinka’s arguments in his lectures and his attempts to articulate ideas about existence, drama, and morality.\n\nWhile at Cambridge, Soyinka returned to an episode suggested to him in about 1960 as suitable material for a drama: the interrupted ritual suicide of the king’s horseman at Oyo during the mid 1940s. Soyinka was able to write the play quickly, and it was given a group reading at Cambridge. Initially titled “Death and the D. O.,” it was published as Death and the King’s Horseman, and in 1976, after Soyinka had returned to Nigeria, it was given its premiere. Three years later, in 1979, Soyinka directed a production at the Goodman Theater in Chicago, and the play was subsequently staged at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. American interest in the play has remained high, and during 1986 Soyinka directed a production in one of the theaters at the Lincoln Center in New York.\n\nResponse to the first Nigerian production and to the published version tended in Nigeria to be dominated by the feeling that the concern with the “feudal” values of the court at Oyo is irrelevant and that tensions between the classes should have been presented. In America the reaction has been more encouraging. Despite difficulties in drawing the performances he required from his American casts, Soyinka has found that his presentation of an African society and of the issues confronting it was widely acceptable. The decision to transfer the first American production to Washington, D.C, for example, indicated the feeling of influential individuals that the play deserved a wider and more cosmopolitan audience than it had in Chicago. In his “Author’s Note” to the book, Soyinka writes about the importance of the “threnodic essence” of the play and the need to avoid the “reductionist tendency” to analyze it in terms of a “clash of cultures.” Despite this note, the play does confront issues raised by the interaction of the Yoruba worldview with the prejudices cultivated at the outposts of the British Empire. The movement of the horseman, Elesin, toward death and his failure to commit suicide at the appropriate time provide considerable dramatic interest and a sharper dramatic focus than the metaphysical dimension.\n\nDeath and the King’s Horseman combines powerful dramatic verse and some impressive characterization with a structure that incorporates contrast and juxtaposition. It explores the complexities of situations, ambiguities, and uncertainties in human relations and refuses to opt for the easy rhetoric of the anticolonial struggle. Some have praised the play as a penetrating examination of responsibilities and as a worthwhile examination of the notion of honor. Others have drawn attention to the way in which Soyinka “re-creates” Olunde, Elesin’s son, who kills himself to salvage his family’s reputation. Unlike the figure in the original sources, Olunde is presented as a medical student who is foreign educated: yet another of Soyinka’s elitist heroes, a recruit to the ranks of the lonely saviors. This line of criticism frequently fails to take into account the almost inevitable concentration on individual characters in those dramas that are aimed at affecting the emotions of the audience.\n\nWhile in exile, Soyinka fulfilled a commission from the National Theatre in London to prepare an adaptation of The Bacchae by Euripides. He had first worked on an adaptation of this play, which he regarded as a flawed masterpiece, while an undergraduate at Ibadan; and his mature work drew on his long acquaintance with the text, as well as on his thinking about the nature of Ogun. He also incorporated ideas from his reading—some of it Marxist analysis—about the social and economic conditions that provided a background to the play. In Soyinka’s version Pentheus emerges as a “colonial” figure obsessed with “order”; and Dionysus, “the god of the people,” as an Ogun figure. Those familiar with his earlier plays recognized Soyinka’s characteristic emphasis on cultural coincidences, on the need for a willing sacrifice, and on the renewal that comes through ritual death, while those who knew Idanre and “The Fourth Stage” drew attention to the extent to which the new version repeated Soyinka’s earlier ideas about Ogun.\n\nThe British National Theatre entrusted the production of Soyinka’s The Bacchae of Euripides to a young director, Roland Joffe, who has since made a reputation as a movie director. A distinguished cast was assembled, and the 1973 premiere production was widely, though not always favorably, reviewed. It was suggested in some quarters—and this seems to have been Soyinka’s opinion—that Joffe’s production was out of sympathy with basic elements in the adaptation and that the performers were ill equipped to cope with the demands made on them. The Bacchae of Euripides presented by the National Theatre did not mark, as some had hoped it would, the arrival of Soyinka in a major London theater. But the text provides an opportunity to observe the points of convergence and separation between the Greek original and the Nigerian adaptation, and a comparison brings out important aspects of Soyinka’s abilities and sensibilities.\n\nWhile in Europe, Soyinka remained in touch with events in Nigeria, with the result that some of his work from this period is a contribution to the debate about Nigerian issues. In the middle of 1972 a member of the Gowon junta was given the task of clearing the prophets and leaders of separatist sects from Bar Beach, the fictional home of Soyinka’s Brother Jero, near Lagos. Soyinka seems to have already entertained thoughts of bringing Jero back onto the stage—a play titled “The Exodus of Brother Jero” had been announced at one point but not completed. The junta’s clearance scheme, together with the spate of public executions carried out in a panic response to an increase in armed robberies in the country, provided a situation around which Soyinka could work a play. He called the new drama Jero’s Metamorphosis (produced in 1974 and published in The JeroPlays). It combines broad comedy, at the expense of recognizable types, with a clever, subversive attack on the Nigerian military regime. In the course of the play Jero, alert, subtle, and manipulative, uses blackmail and his wits to bargain his way into a powerful position. He becomes the leader of the Church of the Apostolic Salvation Army and obtains a “spiritual monopoly” in the National Execution Amphitheatre, which is to be built on Bar Beach once the prophets have been removed. Soyinka sent copies of the play to people he thought might direct it and clearly hoped for a Nigerian production, but apparently there was not one until the middle of 1981, by which time the soldiers were safely, if temporarily, back in their barracks. One of the reviews of that production was headlined “Corruption Glorified in Jero’s Metamorphosis”—a perverse response, which shows that even the straightforward Jero plays can be misunderstood.\n\nWhile following Nigerian affairs with great intensity and responding to specific episodes, Soyinka in exile was also able to cultivate his sense of the experiences that unite the African continent. He edited a volume of poems from black Africa for Seeker and Warburg, a volume that runs to 378 pages and includes his introduction and about 240 poems, 9 of them by Soyinka. The collection differs from earlier anthologies of African verse and makes a Pan-Africanist point by arranging the poems according to theme rather than by the nationality of the poet. One intriguing feature is to be found in the biographical notes at the end of the volume: Soyinka has indicated the towns in which most of the contributors were born, but he writes discreetly, or perhaps secretively, that he himself was born simply “in Nigeria.”\n\nThis major collection, the result of wide reading and careful selection, shows the points at which black African experiences in different parts of the continent touch, and it brings together traditional verse with the work of several generations of writers. In the introduction Soyinka confronts the issue of outside influences on African poets and argues that in poetry, as in fields of major technological development, there has obviously been outside influence, which is not necessarily bad. He makes the point in relation to freedom fighters: “To recommend, on the one hand, that the embattled general or the liberation fighter seek the most sophisticated weaponry from Europe, America or China, while, on the other, that the poet must totally expunge from his consciousness all knowledge of a foreign tradition in his own craft, is an absurdity.” In these lines it is possible to hear, once again, distant echoes of Soyinka’s exchanges over negritude and his debates with those who demand “the decolonization of African literature.” Much of his writing over the years has been given an edge, and made more difficult to follow, by being part of a debate or a contribution to a series of debates.\n\nAfter leaving Cambridge, Soyinka took the post of editor of Transition, a magazine devoted to “Culture and the African Creative Scene,” which had been founded in 1961 and had been edited in Kampala, Uganda, by Rajat Neogy. But with the rise and tyranny of Amin, Uganda could no longer provide a base for either Neogy or a publication devoted to freedom. Soyinka was guest editor for volume forty-six (1974), and in an editorial he struck a distinctive note, carrying over concerns apparent in Death and the King’s Horseman:\n\nPeoples who have experienced the humiliation of imperial attitudes on their own soil must recognise that any pretence towards decolonisation is a gesture of betrayal as long as vestiges of such attitudes remain on the liberated soil. Attitudes are directly related to values. The African people, minus such national leaders as are hopelessly seduced by their own image of the black colonial governor, must know that the values of the outgoing imperial powers must be replaced by an ethnically appropriate system of values and social structure, if the work of true liberation is to be completed.\n\nSoyinka’s policy pushed forward the cause of liberation by focusing on the positive achievements in Guinea-Bissau and of Amilcar Cabral and then by boldly exposing tyranny and failure in Ethiopia and Uganda. Volume forty-six of Transition also featured an article on the 1973 famine in Ethiopia, and a subsequent issue documented the extent of the bloodshed caused by Amin. On the literary side Soyinka published an article by some of his severest critics—Chinweizu, Onwuchewka Jemie, and Ihechukwu Madubuike—and he replied to them in a typically spirited article titled “Neo-Tarzanism: The Poetics of Pseudo-Traditionalism” (in Art, Dialogue and Outrage, 1988).\n\nWith volume fifty Soyinka sought to reflect the new direction in which he was taking Transition by changing the name of Ch’Indaba, an invocation composed of “’Indaba’—the Great Assembly, Council, Colloque (Matabele) and ‘Cha’—to dawn (Swahili).” But his efforts were to no avail: stories linking the American Central Intelligence Agency with associations and congresses for cultural freedom began to appear in other publications, and financial support for Transition was seen to have come from a partisan American source. Attempts were made to find alternative funding, but these were unsuccessful; Transition/Ch’Indaba died. One of the last issues printed a preliminary “Declaration of African Writers.” Dated March 1975, it looked forward to the inaugural meeting of UWAP, scheduled to take place during 1975. Soyinka had been an active member of a campaigning writers’ group in Nigeria during the early 1960s and had carried on his interest in creating a writers’ organization that would fight for human rights and promote the development of literature. He took a leading role in the formation of UWAP and was elected secretary-general at the inaugural meeting. The extent of the union’s activities have not been fully documented, but Soyinka wrote, spoke, and organized functions in the name of the union during the years that followed. For instance, he wrote an open letter (Daily Times, Lagos, 9 December 1978) to Senghor objecting to the banning of the movie Ceddo, and he wrote to Daniel Arap Moi demanding the release of the imprisoned Ngugi wa Thiong’o. Soyinka organized a press conference at the time of the Second Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture (FESTAC), and he spoke at a public meeting called to celebrate the removal of Amin. UWAP came into existence because of Soyinka’s vision, passion, enthusiasm, and energy.\n\nIn December 1975 Soyinka, speaking on behalf of the Cabralist Movement for African Alternatives, welcomed the stand taken on Angola by Murtala Mohammed, who had overthrown Gowon during the previous July. The new junta provided a leadership under which Soyinka, for all his dislike of military rule, felt he could live and work. He returned to Nigeria and in January 1976 took a professorship at the University of Ife. In certain respects he began to work within the establishment. Soyinka enjoyed a few days of Mohammed’s brief but, for many, golden reign: in February the leader was shot dead during an attempted putsch. He was succeeded by the uncharismatic Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nWhen, on 3 March, Samora Machel put Mozambique on a war footing against Rhodesia, Soyinka celebrated by writing a major poem, Ogun Abibimañ (1976), which runs to twenty-two pages and is dedicated to the dead and maimed of Soweto. The poem, which brings together the gods Ogun and Shaka, ends with Ogun in the ascendant. However, the fact that Machel subsequently signed the Nkomati Accord, a nonaggression pact with South Africa, was viewed by Soyinka as a betrayal.\n\nDuring December 1976 Soyinka produced Death and the King’s Horseman at the University of Ife, but the play seems to have been out of tune with the times. The Nigeria to which Soyinka had returned was a country in which the rich had become richer and the poor poorer than before, in which the economy had been distorted by the oil-boom years, and in which the voice of the Left was louder and more articulate than ever before. The arts festival FESTAC, which took place early in 1977, provided Soyinka with many insights into the extent to which corruption and inefficiency had come to characterize his native land. Hoping that something could be salvaged from the occasion, he became involved in the organization of the festival, but he eventually resigned, frustrated and angry. It had become clear that the “cultural jamboree” was being run for the benefit of contractors and businesspeople, rather than for artists or performers; the festival was not for those interested in the contribution the arts could make to the nation or the continent. Although he resigned from his official festival post, Soyinka did not boycott the celebrations entirely: he delivered a paper at the Colloquium on Black Civilization and Education, which constituted one of the less spectacular, less extravagant, and more productive aspects of the festival. In “The Scholar in African Society,” Soyinka injected notes of controversy and idealism into his speech, alluding to diplomatic dramas and stressing the social obligations of the academic community. He defined the black scholar as “a historicized machine for chewing up the carcase of knowledge to regurgitate mortar for social reconstruction,” and he addressed himself to the vexed question of a language for the continent. After reviewing the debate up to 1977, he asked the assembly whether it joined him “in calling upon [African] governments to commence the teaching of Kiswahili in all the schools on this continent.” No answer is recorded. It seems that plans to adopt Kiswahili as the continental language remain pious resolutions.\n\nDuring 1976 Soyinka used Brecht’s Threepenny Opera as a basis for Opera Wonyosi, literally “The Fool Buys Wonyosi”—wonyosi being a particularly expensive lace very popular with wealthy Nigerians. In some respects the work can be seen as a response to those who had condemned Death and the King’s Horseman as well as a reaction to the brutalized society to which Soyinka had returned. The Nigerian version of the story follows Brecht, and therefore to some extent John Gay’s Beggar’s Opera (1728), but Soyinka added new characters and sequences and gave the work a distinctively African and Nigerian flavor. Soyinka’s script contains allusions to continental and local scandals—for example, the outrageous extravagance of Jean-Bedel Bokassa’s coronation and the mysterious deaths associated with the marble deposits at Igbetti. Some of these atrocities are attacked in effective musical sequences or in memorable songs. The play might seem to be the kind of production the Left would have welcomed, and to some extent they did: it was vigorous and accessible theater. But, in the words of Biodun Jeyifo (in a review collected in The Truthful Lie, 1985), it fell short of what was desired because it lacked “a solid class perspective.” This absence was to be expected in view of the indebtedness to an early Brecht script and in view of Soyinka’s rejection of a perspective based on class as providing the answer to all questions about human behavior. His response to Jeyifo’s criticism, an important document in Soyinka’s encounters with the Left, is found at the beginning of the Collings edition of the play. But his most recent creative work, particularly his agitprop theater, his popular, satirical music, and his ventures into filmmaking, must also be taken into account when describing his response to such criticism.\n\nIt was planned that Opera Wonyosi would move on from Ife, where it premiered, to the National Theatre in Lagos, but the production was deemed unsuitable, and the invitation was withdrawn. The scale of the piece meant that it could not easily be accommodated in other venues. Determined to avoid similar frustrations and in order to communicate with the general public, Soyinka created his next productions in an agitprop style. He wrote Home to Roost and Big Game Safari, known collectively as Before the Blow-Out (performed in 1978; unpublished), which provide a commentary on current affairs, particularly on the preparations being made for a return to civilian rule. These sketches, which are suitable for performance in almost any open space and require few props, follow the careers of some of the characters introduced in Opera Wonyosi as they return to Nigeria to fight for their place at the “table of delights” that would be laid for the politicians successful in the forthcoming elections. The opportunists were getting ready for “the blow-out.” The sketches, performed by a new group, the Guerrilla Theatre Unit of the University of Ife, reveal that Soyinka still had something to learn about using performance arts to make an impact on his countrymen. They are written in English, and although many of the effects created are easily appreciated, some of the humor assumes a fairly advanced knowledge of the language. Their importance resides in what they reveal of Soyinka’s moving toward popular, political theater.\n\nDuring 1978, while working with the Guerrilla Theatre Unit, Soyinka also directed The Biko Inquest, a version of the eponymous proceedings in a South African court that had been edited by Jon Blair and Norman Fenton, and a major indictment of the South African police state. Soyinka designed an effective set for the production and stepped in at an advanced stage in the rehearsals to avert possible disaster by taking over a major role. The production was subsequently televised and taken to New York for a festival in 1980— evidence of Soyinka’s desire to use the media to take his theater to a large audience and to broaden the experience of those working with him.\n\nSoyinka’s concern about his country and his continent did not only find expression in theatrical activities. He had long been distressed by the number of people killed on Nigerian roads and by the appalling risks taken by those who travel by road. In a 1 January 1979 newspaper article he asked that 1979 be designated “The Year of the Road,” and he became an active campaigner for road safety, putting forward proposals and accepting certain responsibilities. This activity might seem meekly virtuous and thoroughly uncontroversial, but, in the context of the cross between a racetrack and a battleground that Nigerian roads sometimes resemble, it was no easy undertaking. Unroadworthy vehicles; unlicensed drivers; reckless nihilists behind steering wheels; irresponsible, inept, ill-equipped, and inefficient road-maintenance engineers; and profit margins that depend on high speeds, low maintenance costs, and overloaded trucks make Nigerian roads a formidable challenge. Soyinka has put vast resources of energy into patrolling roads, writing about roads, and framing proposals to make the roads of Nigeria safer. He has composed leaflets and, at one point, was said to be working on a road-safety movie, applying his talents and skills in an effective manner. In handling officers and the press, Soyinka’s conduct has been high-handed on occasion and has attracted criticism from inside and outside the Road Safety Corps.\n\nIn the period immediately before the October 1979 Nigerian elections, Soyinka was in Chicago working on the production of Death and the King’s Horseman for the Goodman Theatre, but he returned home from time to time and followed what was happening closely. As a result of the elections, or rather as a result of a particular reading of the provisions of the constitution, Shehu Shagari became president of the Second Republic of Nigeria. It was a new beginning, ending thirteen years of military rule in a nation that had not yet been independent for twenty years. But the very announcement of Shagari’s victory provided serious grounds for concern. In Oyo State, within which both Ibadan and Ife are situated, Bola Ige, a member of the Unity Party of Nigeria and an old friend of Soyinka, was elected governor. Soyinka accepted from him the chairmanship of the Oyo State Road Safety Corps and threw himself into its crusade. He also worked closely with Tunji Aboyade, the vice-chancellor of the University of Ife and another companion of long standing.\n\nIn December 1980 Soyinka delivered his inaugural lecture, a professorial obligation. Like much that he had written before, his lecture is stimulating and exciting but shows more of the creative writer than of the academic.
