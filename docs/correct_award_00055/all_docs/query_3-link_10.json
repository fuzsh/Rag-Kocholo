        "text": "Back in 1986, at the pinnacle of his triumph as the first black man to be conferred the Nobel Prize for Literature, the Nigerian playwright, novelist, poet, and essayist Wole Soyinka typically found the words to paint the most insightful picture of how our worlds collide.\n\n\"It was inevitable that the Nordic world and the African, especially that part of it which constitutes the Yoruba world, should meet at the crossroads of Sweden. That I am the agent of such a symbolic encounter is due very simply to the fact that my creative muse is Ogun, the god of creativity and destruction, of the lyric and metallurgy,\" Soyinka said in that famous acceptance speech.\n\n\"This deity anticipated your scientist Alfred Nobel at the very beginning of time by clearing a path through primordial chaos, dynamiting his way through the core of Earth to open a route for his fellow deities who sought to be reunited with us, mortals.\"\n\nAs is his wont, Soyinka effortlessly intertwined mythology, creativity, and Alfred Nobel's legacy, emphasising the transformative power of literature and its role in breaking barriers of culture, thought, and geography.\n\nSoyinka turned 90 on July 13, making it a celebration of not just the master and his oeuvre but also a moment to recapture everything he stands for as an African and world treasure.\n\nThe activities planned in Africa and elsewhere over the weekend include special screenings of films on the life and works of the literary giant, book exhibitions, and cultural performances.\n\nBorn Akinwande Oluwole Soyinka in 1934 in Abeokuta, southwestern Nigeria, Soyinka's works and activism have often resonated with people not only in his native Nigeria but also throughout Africa.\n\nAfter attending St Peter's Primary School in Abeokuta, Soyinka attended the Government College and University College Ibadan, which was then affiliated to the University of London, and studied in Leeds in the UK for a master's degree.\n\nHis career blossomed while he was in the UK, with some of his early plays immediately making a mark.\n\nSome of the more famous works of his glorious career include The Swamp Dwellers, The Lion and the Jewel, Kongi's Harvest, Trials of Bothers Jero, Death and The Kings Horseman, Season of Anomy, The Interpreters, Ake: The Years of Childhood, The Man Died, and his memoir Ibadan: The Penkelemesi Years.\n\nStrong convictions\n\nWhen he became the first African to win the literature Nobel 38 years ago, Soyinka attended the presentation ceremony in traditional Nigerian attire. It was a statement that went beyond representing his country.\n\nHis speech referred to the evil of colonialism and how blacks in South Africa's apartheid era were blatantly and repeatedly discriminated against for decades.\n\nSoyinka's involvement in politics wasn't mere rhetoric; it would often get him into trouble.\n\nIn 1965, Soyinka had been arrested and charged with forcing a radio announcer to play a recorded tape containing accusations of electoral malpractice in place of a speech by the then premier of Nigeria's western region.\n\nSoyinka wriggled out of the charges on technical grounds, but that was just the beginning of his brush with the authorities.\n\nHe would fall foul of them again about two years later when he secretly met the governor of the Nigerian eastern region in Enugu to avert the country's civil war.\n\nThis time around, he was detained for 22 months and denied access to books and writing materials throughout the period.\n\nHe wrote The Man Died as a memoir detailing his imprisonment.\n\n\"In retrospect, The Man Died illuminates what has distinguished all Soyinkaâ€™s plays and poems: a passionate belief in justice and moral concern nothing can subvert,\" states an article by Peter Thomas in the journal Books Abroad, the earlier avatar of World Literature Today, in 1974.\n\n\"Long after his persecutors have found their proper place as footnotes in the history books, this man's works will stand as witness to the unconquerable spirit that outfaces all their kind...In his own words, he has become an 'anjonu' (spirit) returned from the grave.\""
