        "text": "Wole Soyinka\n\nPodcast\n\nNobel Prize Conversations\n\n”In a number of my works, I am just narrating a tale for whoever is interested”\n\nIn this podcast episode with literature laureate Wole Soyinka, conducted in November 2021, he talks about his photographic memory, his creative process and the question of who he writes literature for. His home of Nigeria figures prominently in his writing, and he looks ahead to the future of his country. Wole Soyinka also tells us about his passion for space and space travel, or as he puts it, ”I am a space nut!”\n\nThe host of this podcast is nobelprize.org’s Adam Smith.\n\nNobel Prize Conversations was produced in cooperation with ZEIT-Stiftung."
