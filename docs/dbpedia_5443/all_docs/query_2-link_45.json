        "text": "//\n\n//\n\nBattlefield 3 will be released this autumn. The game is published by Electronic Arts and developed by Digital Illusions CE (DICE).\n\nPrepare for full-scale war with Battlefield 3, the third major evolution of the long-running online battle franchise. Using the power of Frostbite 2 game engine technology, Battlefield 3 delivers superior visual quality, a grand sense of scale, massive destruction, dynamic audio and incredibly lifelike character animations. As bullets whiz by, walls crumble, and explosions throw you to the ground, the battlefield feels more alive and interactive than ever before.\n\n//\n\n//\n\nIn Battlefield 3, players step into the role of the elite U.S. Marines where they will experience heart-pounding single player missions and competitive multiplayer actions ranging across diverse locations from around the globe including Europe, Middle-East and North America.\n\n//\n\n//\n\n45.747937 21.225176\n\n//\n\n//\n\nSaints Row: The Third is a sandbox-style action-adventure video game being developed by Volition, Inc. and published by THQ. It is to be released on November 15th in America and November 18th in Europe, 2011 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360[1] and OnLive[3]. It is the third title in the Saints Row series, after the release of Saints Row 2 in 2008. As in Saints Row 2, the player controls the leader of the Third Street Saints. The game world is the fictional city of Steelport, and the story focuses on the gang war between the Saints and The Syndicate, a rival criminal group.[4]\n\n//\n\n//\n\n//\n\n//\n\n45.747937 21.225176\n\nA few years back the company Interplay which was behind the Fallout 1 and 2 titles licensed Fallout from its current owner Bethesda Softworks to create an MMO on the series. Speaking to Edge Magazine, Interplay president Eric Caen said, “We have 90 people working on it. Even in January 2009, you were already able to move across the world.” The game is scheduled to begin beta testing in 2012.\n\n45.747937 21.225176\n\nThis month a MMORPG version of Dreamlords Resurrection will be published by Paradox Interactive. The game is developed by Lockpick Entertainment.\n\nNow you have the opportunity to play Dreamlords Resurrection online with your friends. As a semi-divine Dreamlord, it falls to you to inspire and lead a band of struggling followers to found a strong and thriving city. Then, conquer new lands, defend against the Nightmares that roam the wilderness, and forge alliances with other newly-awakened Dreamlords.\n\nIn your struggles against monsters and other players, you will research new troop types and technologies, gather resources, and acquire and craft equipment for yourself and your army. And if you wish, you may pay Tribute to the gods, that you might receive their divine gifts and blessings, and that their wrath may rain down upon your enemies.\n\n//\n\n//\n\n45.747937 21.225176"
