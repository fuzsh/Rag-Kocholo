        "text": "Articles about\n\nThe Doctor Canon • Lego Dimensions • Zagreus\n\n“ Okay. One more. Just one. Is this world protected? Because you're not the first lot to come here. Oh, there have been so many. And what you've got to ask is, what happened to them? Hello. I'm the Doctor. Basically, run. „\n\nSummary\n\nThe Doctor is the titular main protagonist of the British television series Doctor Who.\n\nA renegade Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, the Doctor has gone on various adventures throughout time and space with his companions, saving countless lives and preventing the destruction of the universe and beyond multiple times.\n\nPowers and Stats\n\nTier: 9-A, at least 7-B with Sonic Screwdriver and alien gun. 4-B, likely far higher during regenerations | High 1-C with Preparation | Low 1-C | High 1-C | High 1-B\n\nKey: Normally | With Preparation Time and Equipment | After Absorbing the Time Vortex | After Absorbing Lux Aeterna | With the Power of The Glory\n\nName: Unknown, goes by \"The Doctor\", also known as Doctor Who, Theta Sigma (ΘΣ), John Smith, ∂³∑x² (one source stated that \"∂³∑x²\" is their real name, but it is vague and never been confirmed in any Doctor Who narrative), \"The Oncoming Storm\", \"The Last Child of Gallifrey\", \"Time Lord Victorious\", \"Valeyard\", and many others\n\nOrigin: Doctor Who\n\nGender: Male (1st to 13th incarnations), Female (14th Incarnation)\n\nAge: Unknown biologically (The Doctor often forgets, and sometimes, lies about his age), over four billion years old mentally due to the events of \"Heaven Sent\"\n\nClassification: Time Lord, Time Traveler, Timeless Child and Ex-Lord President of the Earth and Gallifrey\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n\nAttack Potency: Small Building level (Fought The Master, who can harm him, on various occasions, even outmatching the latter in combat. Punched down a steel door, continuously struck a twenty-foot thick Azbantium wall, a mineral 400 times harder than diamond, to the point where it eventually shattered, even after breaking his hand in the attempt), at least City level with Sonic Screwdriver (The War Doctor, Tenth Doctor and Eleventh Doctor's three sonic screwdrivers destroyed a Dalek) and Time War Gun (Destroyed a Skaro Degredation, which have reinforced armor capable of withstanding their own attacks. Threatened to atomize Alice Obiefune), was going to kill the Dalek in Van Statten's Museum. Solar System level, likely far higher during regenerations (The Eleventh Doctor's regeneration destroyed a Dalek Saucer) | High Complex Multiverse level with Preparation (Acquired The Moment, the Time Lord's most powerful creation, and would have obliterated Gallifrey and the Daleks. The Key to Time grants its wielder the full power of The Six-Fold God), can bypass durability with various equipment (The 2Dis is capable of expanding or contracting the spatial dimensions of an object, rendering it 2nd or 3rd dimensional, the De-Mat Gun rewrites a target's history, erasing their physical form from existence) | Low Complex Multiverse level (Absorbed and even controlled the Time Vortex, which has been proven to be 5-D) | High Complex Multiverse level (Absorbed the power of Lux Aeterna and fought with the Quantum Archangel, causing her serious harm in the process, although he was eventually overpowered) | High Hyperverse level (Gained the power of the Glory. Fought against The Master who's comparable to him)\n\nSpeed: Subsonic (Consistently stated to move with more speed and grace than a normal human, being able to disappear from the sight of others or avoid well-trained people), with FTL+ Reaction Speed | Immeasurable with The Moment and Key to Time | Omnipresent | Immeasurable | Immeasurable\n\nLifting Strength: Class 5 (Pulled the head and arm of an Auton, as well as pulling the arm off a Repeated Meme) | Inapplicable | Immeasurable | Immeasurable\n\nStriking Strength: Small Building level | Inapplicable | High Complex Multiverse level | High Hyperverse level\n\nDurability: Small Building level (Easily withstood direct contact with a Sycorax whip, which can disintegrate humans. Survived a fall from several hundred feet through a glass ceiling, was only briefly knocked out by a gun that could be fatal to humans), Higher after Regeneration (Comparable to River Song, who tanked large amounts of gunfire) | At least High Complex Multiverse level with the Mirror Amulet (Reflected the Gods of Ragnarok's power back at them, destroying their Psychic Circus and severing their link to the universe) | Low Complex Multiverse level | High Complex Multiverse level (Survived attacks from the Quantum Archangel, though he was on the verge of being killed after an extended fight) | High Hyperverse level (Survived attacks from the master, although he was eventually overpowered)\n\nStamina: Superhuman (Even on the verge of death, a Time Lords' bodies will keep trying to regenerate, sometimes taking days to succumb to their injuries. Was able to crawl up a staircase for 1.5 days in critical condition and with highly minimal rest after punching a wall 400 times harder than diamond, which shattered his bones. Withstood 500,000 rads from a nuclear bolt after being heavily damaged) | Likely Infinite | Likely Infinite\n\nRange: Standard Melee Range, Unknown with Sonic Screwdriver, High Complex Multiversal with some equipment (Can effect elder gods like Fenric who are larger than the multiverse) | Low Complex Multiversal | High Complex Multiversal (Should be comparable to the Quantum Archangel) | High Hyperversal\n\nStandard Equipment:\n\nIntelligence: Supergenius. Knows incredible amounts of things about the universe (Claims to be able to speak every language in the universe, and is capable of easily deducing equipment to its point of origin). Can know the details of objects just by tasting/smelling them, and can tell where he is in the universe by looking at the alignment of stars. He has created various equipment/weapons out of nothing but junk on several occasions. Has a very in-depth knowledge on Earth history (Because of traveling their lots) and has picked up many skills from various historic people in his travels. On several occasions various incarnations has fought, defeated, and outsmarted beings such as the Eternals and Guardians of Time\n\nStandard Tactics: Generally avoids using the sonic screwdriver or guns in combat unless absolutely necessary. Usually relies on non-lethal incapacitation methods, such as taking away his opponents powers, trapping them inside mirrors, trapping them in a time loop, etc.\n\nWeaknesses: Is unwilling to change fixed points in history (Although sometimes he has ignored this). Generally hates using guns. Burning out both his hearts will stop him from regenerating, as well as killing him before he can finish regenerating (He also has a finite, albeit unknown and likely very large, limit to his number of regenerations). The Sonic Screwdriver doesn’t work on wood or anything with a deadlock seal. The poison in the Judas Tree prevents him from regenerating and can kill him in at least 32 minutes. | The Glory refuses to give its wielder \"immortality\"\n\nFeats:\n\nToggle\n\nGallery\n\nNotable Matchups\n\nVictories:\n\nLosses:\n\nInconclusive:\n\nReferences\n\nDiscussions"
