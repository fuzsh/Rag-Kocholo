        "text": "I called Grace in the morning of September 19th to talk about where she was on the 17th at the AsiaPOP Comicon (APCC) held at the World Trade Centre (WTC), since I couldn’t find her after 15 minutes upon entering the WTC. Edith (Alstaire’s wife) told me then that Grace was with the Japanese investor of the Top Peg – Anime School. I really wanted to take a picture of her and the Japanese as it has been a few times in a month that the said investor kept on visiting her school at Las Piñas. That Thursday afternoon, I tried to contact her with a cellphone but there was no answer and I looked for her at the WTC, but I couldn’t find her. So I left the WTC that afternoon without saying goodbye to her.\n\nAfter a few explanations on Saturday over the phone, Grace told me she was going to an animation event, which I thought she was going back to the APCC, but she clarified that she’ll be at the SMX Convention Centre at around 2pm, as there was an event called the Best of Anime 2015, where the Top Peg – Anime School had a booth. She said the Japanese investor might be there, so I asked her if she could just take some pictures and write about the event for this blog. But after lunch, I changed my mind and I texted Grace where exactly is the event at the SMX Convention Centre and who is the contact person; so I went there to take pictures of the event, the booth and interview the contact person.\n\nThe Best of Anime 2015 is held at the 3rd Floor of the SMX Convention Centre from September 19 to 20 from 9:00 am to 7:00 pm. The event is on its 6th year and it has thousands of attendees to see and join the contests on cosplays, quickdraw, bands, Karaoke and other activities. In the last 3 years, professional Japanese cosplayers, singers and other artists were also invited to judge and perform in the event. Last year there were about 20,000 visitors to the event. I was already taking some pictures even before buying the entrance ticket. Grace was just a few minutes ahead of me before 2:00 pm where we met at the long line before the registration centre and paid the P300 entrance fee; I left about 3:30 pm. I was primarily at the event to interview about the school and it just so happens that the event was also very interesting.\n\nUpon entering the venue, we separated as Grace went to look for the Top Peg – Anime booth and I took some pictures of the crowd, events and booths. After a few minutes, I was already at the booth where Grace followed a few minutes later. The contact person was Cynthia Z. Javier – she is the chief operating officer of the school and Mr. Tamiyo Hayasaki; they were not yet at the booth as they were still looking around the area. After a short while, they both arrived at the booth and we introduced ourselves. Since Mr. Hayasaki could not speak English, so I just asked Cynthia if it was alright if I just interview her. She agreed and we both went out of the area as the noise inside was very loud.\n\nCynthia Z. Javier (in Blue), Mr. Tamiyo Hayasaki (in Red), Grace (in Black)\n\nInquirers about the Anime School\n\nGrace and Cynthia knew each other way back in 1988; they were both animators at Fil-Cartoons. Since then they went on their separate ways but found each other again in early 2011 as there was a plan to open an Anime School back then. Grace was the one who introduced Cynthia to Mr. Hayasaki, as Grace knew that Cynthia is a big fan of anime. Mr. Hayasaki asked Cynthia in 2011 if there was a market for an anime school; Cynthia narrated that there are many local anime websites and Facebook sites with anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 members or viewers. Many anime groups are also located in the provincial urban areas in the Visayas and Mindanao area. Cynthia observed the growing interest of young Filipinos in anime. Even if the anime is not known, they will make it known. What attracts the young ones is the story, as it it not predictable; the personality of the character as it is closer to their own personality and the interesting design and costume of the anime. There is also a lot of variation of the of the story and design concept.\n\nThe school was to be located at somewhere in Buendia Avenue in Makati City and there were already floor plans for the school. Mr. Hayasaki and two other Japanese investors were the backers of the school but for some reason, the two other investors changed their minds and went on to other businesses. Mr. Hayasaki kept on the dream, as he believed in the potential of the Filipino and many are interested in anime. In 2014 there was another delay as there was a need by the investors to see a huge population in the country who are interested in anime. They call it the net business, which is about 10% of the estimated gross population in the country who are interested in anime. A sample computation is if there are 10 million fans of anime, 1 million are the hard core fans or net business.\n\nIn 2015, many of Mr. Hayasaki’s associates still support his vision, but they need a goal of millions of anime followers. In order to start the school, Mr. Hayasaki just used his own money to get the ball rolling. Through an interpreter, Mr. Hayasaki said that he is from Tokyo, and has a travel business and he set up the school as he wants to introduce Japanese culture and manners. He is also a member of a Japan manga association.\n\nErika Padua (Interpreter), Mr. Hayasaki\n\nThe Top Peg – Anime School is just an affiliate or more like a franchise of Top Peg Animation Institute, since the name of Top Peg is already quite known. The school is the 1st Japanese anime school in the country with manga and Nihongo courses. The basic school course will start on November 3, 2015 and end on February 26, 2016. The school will accept applicants from 17 years old to 40 years old. All applicants will be assessed with a short drawing exam. The school will accept applicants on October 1, 2015. The following basic courses are:\n\nBasic Drawing for Beginners – No drawing background needed – P35,000 tuition\n\nBasic Manga – Some drawing skills needed but Manga experience not necessary – P30,000 tuition\n\nBasic Anime – Some drawing skills needed but anime experience not necessary – P30,000 tuition\n\nAll drawing and animation courses is packaged with basic Nihongo – read and write Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji\n\nNihongo Classes Only – P13,000\n\nTop Peg -Anime School will offer Saturday classes only if there are solid enrollees for this day. Email: animetoppegschool@gmail.com with full name and contact details to be included in this class.\n\nThe target of the school is 100 students for the 3 basic courses. There are currently about 10 staff of the school. Cynthia Z. Javier is the former chairperson if iAcademy handling the BS Animation Program. The Manga instructor has done projects from Japan, the language instructor is an N2 level passer with experience of 7 years living in Japan and the animator instructor has worked with Toei Philippines for more than 15 years.\n\nOne of the goals of the school is to open animation job opportunities for Filipinos in Japan. It is very hard to get jobs in Japan, if one does not have any Japanese language skill. Mr. Hayasaki is also negotiating with other Japanese companies to outsource more Japanese projects as there is only one Japanese animation outsourcing company in the country – Toei Philippines. The school will also open up an exchange student program in the future. The internships, job opportunities and the exchange program will depend on the deals of Mr. Hayasaki.\n\nNext year, the school plans to open a 1 year program to be registered with TESDA. The program will be divided into 3 modules, the basic, the intermediate and the advance classes. In the experience of animation instructors, a student with average skill improves in 1 year, those with innate skills it is about 6 months, those with no experience it is about 2 years. In Japan, animation courses are about 3 years. If the enrolment in Taguig City is going strong, the school plans to set up branches in the provincial areas also.\n\nTop Peg – Anime School is located at the 19th floor Jecoprime Building, 20th Drive McKinley Business Park, Bonifacio Global City Taguig, Metro Manila. Just look up the school’s Facebook site for the contact numbers, email and other details of the animation program.\n\nMs. Cynthia Z. Javier was not exaggerating when she said that anime is very popular in the country. Since another organizer will have a cosplay contest with events and foreign artists like in the Best of Anime 2015. The said event is called Cosplay Mania 2015 which will also be held at the SMX Convention Center on October 3 and 4. The Top Peg-Anime School will also have a booth on the said event, so any interested students can just drop by the school’s booth.\n\nI asked Grace to take some pictures during her stay at the Top Peg Anime booth last October 4, 2015. Since it was Sunday, the place was packed with Cosplayers and visitors. The school had about 6,000 flyers for October 3 and 4, but it ran out around 5 pm on October 4, and the venue closed about 9 pm. The situation was the same last September 20 and 21, they also had 6,000 flyers but it ran out before the festivities ended, so they had to just give out their calling cards.\n\nAccording to their brochure or web description – AsiaPOP Comicon (APCC) is an international pop culture convention themed around comics, film, toys and collectibles, animation, games, cosplay, superheroes and everything pop culture. The event will attract several internationally renowned artists, celebrities and pop icons to various pockets of Asia, starting with Manila (to be followed in Abu Dhabi, Korea and USA) and draw the attention of ardent fans. APCC will feature exhibitors from genres of pop culture and top studios from across the globe, to bring popular brands and exclusive content for the show. Focusing on delivering the ultimate fan experience, APCC aspires to bring geek culture mainstream and stand tall as a perfect launch pad to unveil new products and first look of movies for the Asia Pacific region providing a galore of potential opportunities for SMEs (small to medium size enterprises) in the entertainment business to reach out to big brands and the vibrant creative talent pool from APAC. While the event will serve as a mega licensing avenue for studios to establish direct access to potential clients through B2B networking, the larger purpose of the event will remain the outreach and communication for celebrities and brands with their fans and engage with them on a one-on-one basis.\n\nThe APCC is handled by Universal Events & Entertainment (UEE), a subsidiary of Al Ahli Holding Group is a premier and dynamic international events management company, headquartered in Singapore committed to be the forefront of pop culture/ comic con events globally. The passionate and dedicated team combined has over 4 decades of events management experience in the area of pop culture.\n\nWhen I called Grace for other matters 2 days ago, she told me about the APCC. Although I heard about it early this year and was aware that it would be held this September, I was not aware that it would be held this week. So Grace emailed me the website of the event. The event would be held from September 17 to the 20th, but the 17th is only open to industry professionals for free. On the 18th to the 20th it will be open to the public with various ticket prices (child, one, two or three day passes). Since the event is for free on the 17th from 12 pm to 6 pm, I decided to take a look at it as it can open some connections and broaden my outlook for the pop culture industry. Grace, Alstaire and some other people from Top Peg Animation will also go on the 17th.\n\nI arrived at the World Trade Centre Manila along Gil Puyat Avenue, extension corner Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard before 12:40 pm. There were not many people at the place as there were no celebrities, shows, contests, raffles and other activities for this day. There were some comic artists doing some sketches but other booths or exhibits were still empty and some were still fixing their displays. I can easily imagine the large area to be full of people in the succeeding 3 days, especially on weekends. This is the first time that an international comic convention is held in the country and lots of fans, collectors, enthusiasts, hobbyists and cosplayers will be there to be in this event. There was not much to do except take photos of the many exhibits and did some small talk to some exhibitors. I was also not able to interview the organiser of the event, as the public relations officials were not present. Grace and company arrived much later around 3:50 pm as the TESDA assessment personnel arrived late at Top Peg. I waited for them since I need to get some papers and see the the progress of the mobile game programming and after that I took a few photos of them also. I left around 4:30 pm as I need to take the taxi and MRT to avoid the heavy traffic after office hours.\n\nNone of the Top Peg people nor I will be present in the succeeding days, as we expect the event to be full of people. Alstaire’s brother will be present on Saturday, so I will just ask for some of his pictures for this blog.\n\nSeptember 17, 2015\n\nWhilce Portacio – International Comic Artist & Writer\n\nWhilce Portacio Inside the 4 Meter Tall Hulkbuster\n\nThe following are some pictures and a short essay from Alstaire last September 17, 2015 at AsiaPOP Comicon.\n\nI saw Whilce Portacio talking with some people. Luis and I are comic collectors and I collected his title ‘Wetworks’ way back in college, so we really wanted to get his autograph. We went to one of the booths where they were selling Whilce’s old titles…Luis bought ‘X-factor’ comic while I bought ‘Stone’ number 1 comic for P200. We went back and waited for Whilce to finish talking to a guy who was marketing bags. Another guy (a 3D artist) cut in between us and he asked Whilce if was interested in having his characters sculpted in 3D. Whilce told him that he was interested in turning his characters into toys, and if he can add articulation to the 3D designs, then he should leave his number to his assistant. This gave me the idea to talk to him first before having his autograph.\n\nWhen my turn came, I told him that we were animators and if he was interested in having his works turn into animation. I also told him of the animated trailer we did for a graphic novel. He said he was interested but he wanted to know the capabilities of the Filipino animators. He asked if we could do a Hayao Miyasaki like backgrounds for animation. He said he has a partnership that they would announce next day, and this partnership is with Erik Matti, a Filipino director whose specialty were horror films. Because Whilce has stories about Philippine monsters that he wanted to do in film and that it may translate well also into animation. He really wants to promote Filipino talent but he first wants to see what we are capable of. I told him I can show what projects we have already done and I also said we are into games too. He was really interested but he said he didn’t have the time to visit our studio because he was leaving on the 2th but he might drop by when he comes back in November. After our talk, I asked him for his autograph and I said we will be looking forward to his visit.\n\nAlstaire with Whilce Portacio\n\nSeptember 19,2015\n\nThe following are some pictures of celebrities and some events on September 19 by the brother of Alstaire – Alvin Sarthou. He was there from 9 am to 8 pm as he waited to take pictures of some of the celebrities. I’m very grateful that Alvin allowed his pictures to be used in this blog.\n\nSeptember 19, 9 am – Waiting Outside the World Trade Center\n\nAlvin Algernon Sarthou of Toon City\n\nWith Prop and Costume Maker – Bill Doran\n\nColton Hayes of Arrow TV Series\n\nPaul Bettany\n\nNathalie Emmanuels – Fast & Furious 7 & Game of Thrones\n\nInternational Cosplayer – Vampybitme\n\nActress, Model – Lee Anna Vamp and Cosplayer – Monika Lee\n\nPhilippine International Cosplayer – Alodia Gosengfiao\n\nInternational Cosplayers\n\nDei Sarthou with Actress/Model Allison Harvard\n\nInternational Cosplayers Panel\n\nComic Artist Panel\n\nMagnetic Levitating Figure\n\nCar With Artist Doodles\n\nLast September 7, 2015, Dennis was invited by Grace to give a talk at Top Peg Animation Studios for the staff and students about his experience as an independent 3D animator and producer. The talk was from 9:30 am to 12:00 pm and its about the story behind his creation Kaleh & Mbaki, the 3D Animation Pipeline.\n\nDennis is a 3D animator and a professor at the College of St. Benilde. He is an architectural graduate and a practising architect before he became a 3D animator. He says he didn’t stay long being an architect because his creative juices weren’t fully utilized in the firm. These days the architectural firms with large projects are the ones credited unlike before the individual architect was also recognized.\n\nAfter his brief stint being an architect, he applied at ImaginAsia in the year 2000 at Mandaluyong City. He remembers at that time they were using very expensive equipments that were also used in Hollywood films such as Jurassic Park. Back then they would work on commercials and other video presentations but he was still searching for projects that he could be proud of. After sometime, the studio closed and he worked on the 3D movie Hoodwinked, which was voiced by Anne Hathaway and other celebrities. This was a great opportunity for him to learn and be part of a full length animated film. Despite his work, he still wanted to create his own project and this was when he began his work on Kaleh & Mbaki.\n\nDennis had a fiancé of 3 years, and they had a dream of migrating to the US one day. Their plan was if either of them flies there first, he or she would help the other one to follow. When an opportunity came for his fiancé to go to the US, he stayed behind. While still working here, he decided to start on his short film. He needed time to work on the project, but his work didn’t allow him any. So he quit his job, but he needed money to survive and finance his project. So he tried to work but quit again in other firms. Then in the middle of his project, his fiancé broke up with him. Heart broken but not deterred, he now thought he had more time for his project, which showed him where his passion really was.\n\nHe showed us the short about a shaman – Mbaki and his hornbill friend – Kaleh. The story starts with Mbaki carving a drawing in stone. When Kaleh goes to him asking for fruits, Mbaki gestures him to wait as he was still busy. As Kaleh walks away he then threw a stone towards Mbaki, which angered him. Kaleh acted as if he didn’t do anything. As soon as Mbaki finished his work and was to say something to Kaleh; Kaleh threw a spider at Mbaki which scared Mbaki and made him grab his jungle bolo. Seething with anger, Mbaki pointed his bolo at Kaleh. Kaleh thought he was going to be killed by Mbaki and he lost consciousness. Kaleh woke up beside a basket of fruits that Mbaki prepared for him. Kaleh approached Mbaki and shared him some of the fruits and Mbaki thanked him. When Mbaki was about to grab another fruit, Kaleh quickly got the basket and turned away. But Mbaki had a basket of fruits bigger than what he gave Kaleh which made him smile.\n\nAfter the show, Dennis gave tips on how to start your own story. He says the story comes first. Originally, Kaleh was a dog and his story was much more elaborate which had another character – a quail. He created a storyboard which he posted on his wall. He showed a picture of the storyboard panels covering the wall behind his computer. He broke every scene down to the number of scenes and the duration of each scene, the number of characters, props and effects of the shots. He then started to do all the assets. After the story, do some research. For me (Alstaire), I didn’t notice the film looked Filipino, but when Dennis told us his research, it became clear. The shaman – Mbaki looked like a native statue, his texture and anatomy were wood like in character. He said the design was based on the Ifugao’s wood carvings. He then searched for an animal, other than a dog that was endemic in the Philippines. He wanted a Toucan bird, but these birds are only found in South America. He then found a similar local bird but of a different species called the hornbill. He had to change the design by incorporating 2 kinds of hornbill species to come up with a colorful design. He said the formula was FU – which he teaches his classes at St. Benilde. The F stands for familiarity and U for uniqueness. You should make your film familiar to draw audiences but at the same time make it unique.\n\nIt took him almost 4 years to finish the 5 minute short. He wasn’t happy with it though, as he originally wanted a longer story that had more drama, but because of lack of budget and time he had to change the story. He said in the original script, there was suppose to be a sacrifice, close to the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac. Even though he wasn’t happy with the output, he entered it to different festivals and contests, where it got 8 recognitions here and abroad. He quoted Pixar director – Ronnie del Carmen who emphasize that you create then get feedback, then repeat. Although he was not satisfied with the story, at least he finished it and got some feedback and recognition for it. Rather than going back and correcting the animation to its original story, Dennis would rather make a new one. He is now creating a new project about the local tribe Aetas, but he now he has a small team to work on it.\n\nDennis recalled his days at ImaginAsia as he was starting in 3D animation. The computer that he was using at that time was a Silicon Graphics work station which cost about 1.2 million pesos. This was the same computer used at Pixar at that time. He then compared that machine to today’s laptop with the same power but more capability that only cost 35,000 pesos. So what is stopping us from creating our own Toy Story.\n\nArticle by Alstaire A.
