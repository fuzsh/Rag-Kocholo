        "text": "And I am completely disagree to blame NVIDIA for poor working game(s). I know so little about game profiles/game optimizations implemented in drivers, but to me (as a professional developer since 1992) namely game developer must provide game working good. OFC, there is such thing as PC platform curse (when there is no guarantee that all parts assembled in your rig will work properly), but when NVIDIA/ATI decided to offer such thing as game profile they didn`t know that game developers will decide to pass the responsibility for their result work to NVIDIA/ATI.\n\nI mean that whole practice of releasing \"game ready\" drivers feels wrong to me. Game should work from day 0 on current drivers and not on some special future ones.\n\nThey put their best engineers to work extra time on dx12 drivers for Pascal and Volta, and left dx11 to the rookies.\n\nEveryone with the problem must try that... and deleting apex.dll from game folder or setting physx to cpu in control panel. Also some osd layer software can fix remaining jerkiness, bandicam did it for me on this game and all the other titles with the new driver introduced stuttering caused by ssaa (Like pinballFX).\n\nI see only a handful of people here that have improvements from IMEI apps. If it was widespread, i'm sure IMEI bundled apps would become a part of core windows installations.\n\nOn my system, the changes between 347 and 355 drivers are non existent in all games that predate both drivers, with games newer than 347 sets performing better, and any issue i've had that happens with both drivers, was not affected by IMEI or the apps in any way.\n\nMost games (and by most I mean 99,9% of them really) work on current drivers just fine. \"Game ready\" drivers are usually about several percent more performance and a SLI profile. And SLI/CF is a whole other story.\n\nI don't think people fiddle around here.\n\nThe intel tech drivers delivers a substantial performance upgrade to games and applications but why was it kept away for so long.\n\nAnyway i've been playing some bioshock 1 and got no audio after the intro, After a few minutes i figured out the issue. If anyone wants to dip back into rapture on windows 10, visit this link to fix the issue.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/7670/discussions/0/487870763300254177/\n\nIntel/AMD Chipset Drivers - Not installed\n\nIntel Management Engine - Only driver 166 no software\n\nIntel Rapid Storage - 12.9.4.1000 because higher has issue with my Samsung HD103SJ with APM\n\nNvidia Drivers - 355.98\n\nOS - Windows 10 x64\n\nAnything Extra - HPET Disabled on bios and windows , not special registry tweak enabled like DisablePaging . GPU is non MSI mode.\n\nAdaptive Vsync enabled + PreRender 3 ( Default )\n\nDirectx 9 Redist June 2010 Installed\n\nGPU Tweak 2 1.1.1.1 using to overclock and limit FPS to 65\n\nI am noticing that limiting to 58,59,60,61,62 has weird unexplained stuttering every 6 sec or the guys who knows how to calculate if 60 Fps is 16.7ms then it looks like the fps just goes to 58,59,60,61 and back to 62. Limiting the FPS to any of the numbers always takes +2 , if limiting to 60 it will limit to 62, so is 65 to 67. Limiting it to 65 doesn't have this drops at all, it stays 67 all the times. I saw heavy stuttering on Trine 3, so you guys can test the game and see what number fix it for you. Last time I tried to play BladeStorm nightmare on windows 7 it ran like crap even with 1.02 patch. now with windows 10 and all the settings it runs like a dream, so is NFS Rivals.\n\nI did test it on my Laptop Asus 751JT 970m and GTA V works way better for me and my friend with Asus 950m laptop, we both saw a difference."
