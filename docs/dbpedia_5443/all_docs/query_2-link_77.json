        "text": "This week I share RPG crowdfunding projects that end between April 11th and the 23rd. This article is a sampling of the projects that are out there, though it is a 5e heavy week. There are a lot of fun 5e projects, but also some interesting original systems as well as a big Praxis System offering.\n\nTome of Adventure Design from Mythmere Games\n\nEND DATE: Tue, April 19 2022 11:27 AM EDT.\n\nSYSTEM(S): Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition\n\nPROJECT TYPE: Sourcebook\n\nMOST POPULAR PLEDGE: $50 + S/H for the PDF and print version of the book\n\nWHY SPOTLIGHT THIS CAMPAIGN? The original Tome of Adventure Design by Matt Finch was published in 2009. Returning to print with new advice and articles, this new edition clocks in at over 500 pages. Boasting over 400 random charts and the Apophenia Engine, this isn’t a gaming system, but a series of micro prompts to help the GM create unexpected ideas. Along the margins of each page are one to five word prompts that the GM can feed into the story to help differentiate the bad guys, the scene, or the whole adventure. Something as simple as “works differently while inside out” can suggest a completely different take on a magical garment. If you’re in the neighborhood for well-reviewed GMing advice, check out the campaign page for a free PDF sample of the book.\n\nKamon: Japanese Fantasy Setting for 5e from Fabio Attoli\n\nEND DATE: Wed, April 20 2022 10:58 AM EDT.\n\nSYSTEM(S): Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition\n\nPROJECT TYPE: Sourcebook\n\nMOST POPULAR PLEDGE: €24 for the PDFs of the books\n\nWHY SPOTLIGHT THIS CAMPAIGN? This is an interesting idea: an alternative history of Japan. In 1281, the storms that decimated the Mongol invasion of Japan were the beginning of endless storms, leaving Japan isolated with only connections to the supernatural world. This campaign offers a 5e sourcebook and an adventure in Italian or English to let you experience a magically isolated Japan. The campaign page does not mention any cultural readers, but the free 86-page preview lists several that helped with this project, so it benefits from first hand knowledge. If this project interests you, I suggest checking out the free preview PDF available on the campaign page.\n\nThe Heart of Chentoufi: Adventure in Luke Gygax's Okkorim from Gaxx Worx\n\nEND DATE: Sun, April 17 2022 12:00 AM EDT.\n\nSYSTEM(S): Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition\n\nPROJECT TYPE: Adventure module\n\nMOST POPULAR PLEDGE: $45 + S/H for the PDF and print of both books plus additional PDFs\n\nWHY SPOTLIGHT THIS CAMPAIGN?

Expanding on Luke’s Gary Con scenarios, this adventure gets you into the empire’s last important city. If you’re a fan of Luke’s work, this is an easy project to back.\n\nThe Biggest Praxis Kickstarter from Post World Games\n\nEND DATE: Wed, April 13 2022 1:58 PM EDT.\n\nSYSTEM(S): Praxis System\n\nPROJECT TYPE: Core rulebooks\n\nMOST POPULAR PLEDGE: $49 for all of the PDFs\n\nWHY SPOTLIGHT THIS CAMPAIGN? That wily Jim Pinto is back with the biggest Praxis Kickstarter ever. How big is it? Four complete games and a forest of expansions! You get post-apocalyptic fun like The Carcass: Broken Sky, a sci-fi tale of rescue gone wrong in Odin's Eye II: Gate of Light, an experimental prison fails to reform its inmates in Devil's Maze, and an RPG in which you are the undead and you suffer called Harpy Fields. In addition to those game, there’s Dirty Cops, a Praxis tale of bad cops being investigated, Geneva’s Children, the story of modern-day Robin Hoods, Dying Memoryes: Vertigo, you slowly pull out of a long cryogenic sleep as your ship is being torn apart, yet your memories are mixed and you need those memories to save your now, and, lastly, The Witch in which you escort an accused witch to her fate, what does your character’s participation in this charade say about them? If you are looking for a variety of new, original games, this project offers a range and depth well worth considering.\n\nDark Nation: A tabletop role-playing game from Martin Lloyd - Amazing Tales\n\nEND DATE: Mon, April 11 2022 10:19 AM EDT.\n\nSYSTEM(S): Cthulhu Dark\n\nPROJECT TYPE: Core rulebook\n\nMOST POPULAR PLEDGE: €10 for the PDF of the game\n\nWHY SPOTLIGHT THIS CAMPAIGN? This game comes runs on a simple concept: Something terrible happened and you have to investigate. Inspired by Handmaid's Tale, The Man in the High Castle, 1984, and Edge of Darkness, this RPG is not about monsters, but about the darkness within humanity. Offered as a 40ish page RPG, you’ll use the Cthulhu Dark system, but nothing supernatural. Instead, the monsters are mankind and the horrors are taken from real life.\n\nLEGENDS: The Superhero Roleplaying Game from MatchPlay Games\n\nEND DATE: Sat, April 23 2022 2:59 AM EDT.\n\nSYSTEM(S): An original d20 system\n\nPROJECT TYPE: Core rulebook\n\nMOST POPULAR PLEDGE: CA$75 + CA$20 for the PDF and print version of the book\n\nWHY SPOTLIGHT THIS CAMPAIGN? Superheroes using an original d20 system. No classes, LEGENDS uses 100 different powers and 650 abilities to differentiate characters. Set in a superhero founded city, you live among a 20% to 25% population of superpowered individuals.

At over 300 pages, you get a new d20 option, superpowers, and a city that isn’t like most of the superhero dwellings. If that interests you, check out the campaign page for more details.\n\nEPIGONI: a Mythpop RPG from NessunDove and Dreamlord Games\n\nEND DATE: Thu, April 21 2022 5:00 AM EDT.\n\nSYSTEM(S): An original system\n\nPROJECT TYPE: Core rulebook\n\nMOST POPULAR PLEDGE: €150 + S/H for the PDF and print versions of both books as well as additional PDFs\n\nWHY SPOTLIGHT THIS CAMPAIGN?

I’m sharing my comic book Kickstarter at the end on the justification that you can use the campaign to pick up my Powered by the Apocalypse RPG, POWERED by the DREAMR (PbtD). Other than my involvement, what does In Our Dreams Awake (IODA) have to do with PbtD? Both touch on my fascination with dreams and what goes on when we close our eyes. IODA tells the tale of Jason Byron. Is he a painter in a fantasy world or a cyberpunk drug dealer? More importantly, who does he love? Which world is the truth and which one is the dream? This is a four-color tale for fans of cyberpunk, fantasy, and dreampunk. Plus, you can check out my RPG while you’re there.\n\nEgg Embry participates in the OneBookShelf Affiliate Program, Noble Knight Games’ Affiliate Program, and is an Amazon Associate.
