        "text": "the secret to online play (LAN is basically the same) - is not a matter of sending maps and entire fields but rather to send the information concerning locations and rotations of players. Bullets don’t have to be calculated - that would be nice but it’s not neccessary - just say wether or not the player is firing - then your computer can calculate the trajectory. I did a mock up of such a design by figuring the information to be sent:\n\nPlayer ID\n\nPlayer Name\n\nPlayer Shield Value\n\nPlayer Loc X,Y,Z\n\nPlayer Rot X,Y,Z\n\nPlayer Weapon ID\n\nPlayer Firing (0=no, 1=normal, 2=secondary)\n\nPlayer Position (0=standing, 1=crouching)\n\nPlayer Message (text, if NULL then display no message)\n\nOn player death send one last packet with the players location and then a message saying Player Name killed by Player Name2 with Player Name2 Weapon then respawn player with new unique ID at respawn point.\n\nThe max number of people you could have playing are about 6 which is fine - it’s enough to have a team but not too many to get crowded…\n\nThe most efficient method of sending this information is to use an external network engine and just have blender write to a text file all of the information via python - then have it read from another file…\n\nmaybe that’ll help you some - it’s really not about ping time it’s about how much information you are sending - that’s what creates the video lag! Just an old half life expert talkin’ …\n\nYou mentioned that the player maximum would be six. Why?\n\nthat’s the estimated peak performance maximum based on the amount of information at a good rate of 30fps at 800x600 with standard video hardware and a relatively fast highspeed internet connection - if you figure it out you are sending 6x1kbx30fps=180kb/s - now it’s actually more like 180kb/s/4 = 45kbs/s which is still rather large - so that’s why i said 6 players max - normal hl server was 6 anyway - only custom servers run at 32 or more players - and believe me - they lag - even on a T1!\n\nIs it about the “weight” of Blender and/or Python or are the sent pacages just so “heavy” even if they only have the information you listed? Or is the Blender Engine just so slow to read those pacages? Or is it because the network engine is external? What about if I make internal network engine for the game? Would the transfer be easier (read: faster) for internal network than it’s for external network?\n\npretty much all of it - blender and python are fast enough to get out 30fps with good hardward and a fast pc and that is a lot of information in each packet - you could go even lower with fewer weapons, no messages, no positions, and no shield values - it would be pretty stripped down and at that you could probably manage 12 players (2kb*30fps=60kbs/second).\n\nThe difference between internal and external engine for the network is that external makes it less intense on blender and python so that you can get more graphic power out of blender - which means less lag - it also requires less python - their are alot of network engines out there you’ll just have to find a cheap and easy to use one that allows you to specify a particular file to send and receive and save to and then how to parse all of the documents together to get the right information for all players. Internal would work even more efficiently but would create a bad video experience - not very good! I rather lag due to graphic intensity then to lag due to networking…\n\nFaster blender would be ideal but really you don’t need a faster blender - just a simpler game - no one really needs all of the eye-candy in FarCry or any other game but it enhances it so people like it and programmers due it - then again they get payed to develop these things so blender fans have to due it in their off time - make your game simple and then worry about making it pretty after it works…\n\nbtw, your file just got bigger, you also need to have one more packet just for the map that tells which objects have been destroyed and into what position they should be - and to tell you which map you’re playing! This should come from the master node and so the guy on the master node selects the game and controls the content - he’s the one who needs the t1 and an Athlon 64 4000+ Nvidia PCI-X graphics card (2GB of RAM wouldnt hurt)!\n\nright NOR.J (dreamlord - he’s the expert) - i completely forgot to mention sectors - hl used sectors for their online games which would allow for players to be in the same map but in a different seperation - the best way to make a sector is not to divide the map up into preset grids but into boundries - for instance you have a square map with four building - every building (and every floor in a building) is a sector and everything out in the open is another sector - it requires more invisible polies but that wouldn’t be too bad - their is one problem and that is when you have 32 players and they are all in your 10x10 room (highly unlikely) is that your server would crash. The only other possibility is that you wouldn’t see a guy through a window in another sector - and he’s shooting at you - of course he wouldn’t be able to see you either so he’s not shooting at you - and your engine isn’t calculating his bullets because you don’t have his stats! It brings the realism down alot but it increases the less likeliness that you’d get snipers and spawners! The only way to fix this problem is do something like this:\n\nPacket 1-9 = Sector information only\n\nPacket 10 = Global information\n\nPacket 11-19 = Sector information only\n\nPacket 20 - Global information\n\nPacket 21-29 = Sector information only\n\nPacket 30 = Global information\n\nThat would mean that your server would have a noticeable lag three times a second but because it is so short and you shouldn’t have more than 12 players in a map anyway (it get’s too crowded for an fps! - anyone will tell you that!) it probably wouldn’t matter and your server could cope. I’d say go with sectors only when you need to have alot of players - have the master node be in charge of what map and how many players can join and if it is more than a preset number (say 12) then sectors are enabled.\n\nMultiplayer games across the web are highly ambitious just because there are hundreds of variables to account for - it’s just about impossible to get a truly perfect multiplayer - there are always lagging players and juttering graphics - with Blender it’s even more crazy BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE! If I was you I would get a couple friends together on laptops and test it out as a lan game - less lag as you can get up to about 1MB/sec but you’ll still have graphic problems and probably won’t be able to keep 30fps unless you all have some 256mb gpus!"
