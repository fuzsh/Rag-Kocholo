        "text": "Dreamlords is a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) that combines the accessibility of a web game with RPG character development, RTS battles and long term tactical strategy.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a mystical Dreamlord, a powerful being who is spawned from the dreams of the Dreamer. The Dreamer is the centre core of the universe, fueling all things with the power of life, the gnosis, the focused attention of the Dreamer. Although Dreamlords may empower forceful methods on its subjects their presence are always welcome as they have the power to provide goals and guidance for a fragmented piece of the tired old world. These pieces of lands, home to hardened populations of survivors controlled by a Dreamlord are known as Patrias, the fatherland. The success of each patria is totally depending on the capability of its Dreamlord. The war is on, the war for existence.\n\nDreamlords provides both turn-based long term empire building and real-time 3D RTS action in a massively multiplayer world. It features several gameplay modes that are interconnected to create the dreamlords gameplay. These modes include:* Empire management/city management\n\nLong term planning\n\nResource management\n\nTrading on the authentic stock market\n\nRTS missions and quests\n\nRTS player versus player\n\n3rd-person spirit quests\n\nCrafting\n\nThe empire building is done in the web interface, while fighting happends through the game client. The game world is inhabited by three races: Covenant (balanced race), Nihilim (focused on management) and Th√ªl (focused on combat). All players exist in the same universe and progress is relative to the success of allies and enemies. At the beginning of the game, players are automatically assigned to a Convergence (guild) to work together for common interests, but it is still possible to switch while playing.\n\nA start package needs to be bought and there is a monthly fee to keep playing."
