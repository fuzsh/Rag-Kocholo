        "text": "Release notes for Xfire 1.154 February 20th, 2013\n\nGame launch fixes for Battleground.\n\nMinor changes.\n\nRelease notes for Xfire 1.153 January 25th, 2013\n\nFixed a bug which broke video encoding and broadcasting.\n\nMinor changes.\n\nRelease notes for Xfire 1.152 January 22nd, 2013\n\nAdded Battleground support (Xfire's new competitive gaming platform).\n\nMinor changes.\n\nRelease notes for Xfire 1.151 December 7th, 2012\n\nAdded full Xfire In-Game support for DirectX 9 Extended games (World of Tanks, Source games, and hundreds more).\n\nWhen broadcasting, your streams will now be sent to a server nearer to you (Used to be USA only).\n\nRelease notes for Xfire 1.150 October 23rd, 2012\n\nFixed a bug where, when viewing certain broadcasts, the video stream would appear choppy.\n\nFixed a bug where game detection at start-up would be extremely slow when World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria is installed.\n\nAdded support for Chinese and Japanese IME.\n\nAdded support for third party Google Pinyin / Sogou Pinyin / QQ Pinyin IMEs.\n\nUpdated Xfire toolbar.\n\nUpdated Chinese translations.\n\nOther changes and fixes.\n\nRelease notes for Xfire 1.149 May 3rd, 2012\n\nFixed an issue where video uploads would fail with the \"413 Request Entity Too Large\" error.\n\nFixed some, if not all, HTTP request errors.\n\nFixed a connection bug with 'Games For Windows Live' games.\n\nFixed a bug where Battlefield 3 would crash when Xfire In-Game is enabled on DirectX 10 graphics cards.\n\nImproved frame rate on broadcasts for viewers.\n\nFixed minor bugs with game definition parsing.\n\nUpdated IME system and added IME support for XIG Web Browser.\n\nChanged spelling of \"Minimize to notification bar\" to \"Minimize to notification area\" in Options.\n\nRelease notes for 1.148 February 29th, 2012\n\nAdded ability to broadcast on Twitch.TV (replacing LiveStream).\n\nAdjusted Options menu tabs accordingly for Twitch.TV implementation.\n\nFixed crashing when navigating to Tools -> Options if using XSplit, ManyCam, or other webcam software.\n\nFixed some IME and XInput issues.\n\nFixed more bleed-through issues.\n\nMinor changes.\n\nRelease notes for 1.147 February 22nd, 2012\n\nAdded ability for the client to be minimized to the taskbar.\n\nAdded an option in Tools -> Options -> General to \"Minimize to notification bar\".\n\nMoved the webcam settings from the Xfire In-Game to Broadcast tab.\n\nAdded a webcam preview section to the Broadcast tab.\n\nFixed a bug where two webcams with the same name would not let you use the second webcam in a broadcast.\n\nFixed a bug where the 'Broadcast Microphone' checkbox was missing from the Xfire In-Game overlay.\n\nMinor changes.\n\nRelease notes for 1.146 February 3rd, 2012\n\nAdded support for Korean IME in Xfire In-Game.\n\nUpdated Xfire In-Game hooking code (NEW_INPUT_SYSTEM flag). This should fix various different issues in a lot of games.\n\nFixed bleed-through issues in some games. More to come soon.\n\nXfire now shows in your taskbar when activated.\n\nMinor fixes.\n\nRelease notes for 1.143 December 14th, 2011\n\nAdded an option to upload videos taken in Xfire to your YouTube channel.\n\nAdded Facebook Chat to Tools -> Social Network Manager.\n\nFixed crashing for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and a bunch of other games.\n\nFixed Xfire In-Game for a lot more DirectX 10 & 11 games.\n\nReleased a new default Xfire skin (Phoenix), which is only available on the latest Xfire client download.\n\nNote: On Facebook Chat, use your Facebook Username to login. If you have not set-up a Username on Facebook, or do not remember it, go to this page and see the 'Username' field.\n\nRelease notes for 1.141 December 1st, 2011\n\nRemoved a bunch of old and unused DX9 clean-up code that stopped the correct unhooking of functions in DX10/DX11. This resolved some crashes that occurred in WoW and other games on exit when resources were not correctly cleaned up.\n\nAdded some new failsafe hooking checks and debug logging to ensure that hooks do not get attempted until they have passed another layer of sanity checks.\n\nChanged the hooks used for DX10 & DX11 to use ResizeBuffers instead of ClearState. A large range of games called ClearState many times per frame, which would result in a huge fps drop because it would clear all devices and bitmaps and they would need to be recreated every frame. Also ResizeBuffers is the new way in DX10/DX11 to know when the screen size changes. Without this hook, newer DX11 games were crashing on re-size or switching to Fullscreen mode.\n\nAdded another layer of protection in the get screen size function to stop crashes that occurred when resizing certain games.\n\nFixed a memory leak where the DX10 sprite proxy was never being cleaned up when exiting.\n\nFixed an issue in DX10 where screenshots and video were not displaying the XIG interface because the sprites were not correctly getting flushed to the GPU.\n\nFixed an issue where DX10 & DX11 games that used multi-sampled (anti-aliasing) back buffer would always result in black screenshots and video capture.\n\nAdded full support for R10G10B10A2 back buffer format which fixed black screenshots and video capturing for any games that use that buffer format.\n\nOptimized the loop logic that grabs the pixels in the back buffer for all buffer formats. This was needed because some games were dropping to 15 fps (or less) when video capturing occurred.\n\nChanged the core DX11 render logic to use our own render target view instead of depending on the the render target view the game left us. This fixed a lot of games (Deus Ex, Dirt 3, Civ 5, etc) where the XIG windows would not render at all because the render target views were either cleared or left in an unusable state.\n\nTweaked rendering support for: World of Warcraft, Bioshock 1 & 2, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Civilization 5, DiRT 3, Homefront, Dragon Age II, Red Fraction: Guerrilla, Dungeons & Dragons Online\n\nEnabled auto-login by default\n\nEnabled Broadcasting by default\n\nRelease notes for 1.140 October 12th, 2011\n\nImproved client support for both DirectX 10 and 11\n\nWe are happy to share the latest release of the client 1.140 with you.\n\nThe focus of this release is to make in-game support improvements for DX10/11 games.\n\nWhile we continue to test DX10/11 games, we are only supporting the renderer in the following games for this release: World of Warcraft, The Lord of the Rings Online, and Dragon Age II. We will be releasing weekly game support updates to add DirectX capabilities with a larger number of games.\n\nAs always, thank you for your continued support!\n\nThe Xfire Game Masters send out game updates every week. You can keep up with these weekly game releases over at our new blog!\n\nRelease notes for 1.138 August 25th, 2011\n\nImproved Localization Native Language support with non ASCII characters\n\nDue to a change with Twitterï¿½s API, we have temporarily disabled it in the social network manager\n\nAuthenticode Update\n\nHolding down the enter key in a chat room will no longer spam the user with spam warnings\n\nFixed an issue where users were unable to register using the Xfire client.
