        "text": "GAME INFO\n\nGraywalkers: Purgatory is a stylish strategic turn-based tactics Role-Playing game set in a supernatural post-apocalyptic setting where Heaven and Hell merged with Earth during an event called the Rupture. You play prophesied leader of the Graywalkers, 36 righteous souls destined to protect mankind. Your job is to search, recruit and eventually lead these heroes in reclaiming the world for humanity from itâs supernatural invaders.\n\nThe game was inspired by a combination of features from XCom, Fallout and Jagged Aliiance. It was funded on Kickstarter in late 2014 and has been in full development since then and is set to do itâs Early Access release on December, 2018. It was built on Unity and on our own proprietary development platform and content/map editor called the Dream Engine. It also utilized a new soon to be released original and unique table-top RPG game called the Wyldekarde System"
