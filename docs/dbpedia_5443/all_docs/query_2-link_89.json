Did you see Fury Road? This is that.\n\nMonsterhearts (Buried Without Ceremony, retail $10): The messy lives of teenage monsters. (Previously presented in our April 2013 Bundle of Holding +2.)\n\nMonsterhearts: Blood of Misty Harbour (Buried Without Ceremony, retail $5): A complete three-episode mini-series for Monsterhearts.\n\nBootleggers: Smuggling Run (One Seven Designs, retail $7): Crooks smuggling alcohol in 1930s Seattle. By John Harper, designer of Blades in the Dark and Lady Blackbird.\n\nCartel (Magpie Games, retail $5): “Ashcan edition” of Mark Diaz Truman’s game of Mexican narcofiction in the Sinaloa crime ring.\n\nCustomers who paid more than the threshold price gained +1 forward and also got our entire Bonus Collection of five more titles (retail value $49.50):"
