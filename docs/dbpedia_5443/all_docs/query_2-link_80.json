        "text": "I tend to agree, though I think it is the notion of fixture in the starting line up that we'll have to do without. Art has too much\n\nIn terms of calm, stability and pulling the strings from the back to discard, Aaron's been fantastic and will likely continue to push up, and if Jack returns in decent\n\nform, it's hard to see how he doesn't get games. Add the possibility of Santi slotting in AM, even before fellailing there are many people looking to play.\n\nFellini isnt average, thats just silly.. and i dont really agree that Arteta is passed it which seems a popular thought round here, he was our best cm last year.. might of tailed off a bit towards the end but he just needs to be rotated a bit which is were Ramsey comes in.. I love the progress the Aaron made in the last couple of months and think he can be a regular in the future if he sticks to that position which I had been calling for some time but we wont bring in Fellini to sit on the bench & Arteta is still one of the first names on the team sheet for me.. In reality injuries, rotation & the fact that we probably wont sign Fellini means Ramsey will get plenty of games which he deserves.\n\nFellaini + Arteta looks like a great combo against slower, larger midfields.\n\nWhat Ramsey has done so well is cover the ground that Arteta can't. Against quicker, more dynamic midfields Ramsey has the engine/stamina to make up ground in a way that neither Arteta or Fellaini could.\n\nyou didn't have to. They played together at one point.\n\nedit: don't got nothing against both players btw, would welcome fellaini.\n\nYou don't need your central midfield to be very imaginative or 'entertaining'. You have them forming a solid wall in front of the back 4, good at laying the ball off to the key guys further forward with long and short mostly accurate passes, chipping in with the killer ball and goal here and there.\n\nI see two players presently at the club who can do that in Ramsey and Arteta. Fellaini would be a third.\n\n-- Ramsey----Fellaini (Hope he comes)--\n\nwith Cazorla/Wilshere ahead of them is a very solid balanced midfield. There is no need for a dedicated DM if you can form a good base with 2 B2B CM's.\n\nRamsey had his brainfart moments, but his tenacity and mobility is actually quite essential for us. Arteta can be used a bit sparingly, but would not be too averse with the idea of Fellaini/Some other CM actually starting from the bench and dislodging Arteta in the long run.\n\nRamsey is quite essential in our midfield set up going forward I think."
