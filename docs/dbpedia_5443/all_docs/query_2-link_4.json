        "text": "The Th多l are a tribal society that tends to live in grouped villages, with each cluster encircling its leader. Although not great in numbers, their armies are nonetheless imposing since individual members of the race can tower as high as 10 meters. Also gifted with tremendous natural strength and endurance, they are, not surprisingly, renowned for their prowess in close combat, where they are fully capable of standing against and defeating enemy forces that are far larger numerically. Always at the center of the action, Steeltusks are battle-hardened fighters. Clad in heavy armor, they rely on sheer brawn and brute force. Blackhides are more agile and stealthy, qualities that make them highly effective using hit and run tactics. The Shaman is certainly capable in melee situations, and also possesses a bond with the land and spirits that enables devastating magic.\n\nIn Dreamlords, a massively multiplayer endeavor in development at Lockpick Entertainment, the Th多l are one of the races you'll be able to play. Combining real-time strategy with RPG elements, the game casts you in the titular role, controlling a patria, a landmass floating in a reverie. Using its population and natural resources, you'll construct buildings and assemble an army, with more choices becoming available as your domain grows. You'll also need to develop a higher-level plan. In this respect, you'll be able to focus upon military might, cunning, mutually beneficial alliances and more in order to deal with threats such as monsters menacing your populace, demonic summonings and the mysterious Reasonists as well as other players. We recently had occasion to learn more from Game Designer Marcus Andrews, Lead Game Designer Jon Selin, and CEO and Executive Producer David Ros多n.\n\nIncludes two exclusive 1280x1024 screenshots\n\nJonric: Aside from combat, what are the major activities in Dreamlords, and how extensive and important are they?\n\nMarcus Andrews: Besides fighting, you can manage your long-term strategy, sell a variety of things you have enabled, engage in local politics, engage in local trade and production, craft items, armors or buffs, try to make a bargain on the global market, or chat with fellow Dreamlords. The non-combat gameplay constitutes roughly between 30 to 70 percent depending on play style.\n\nThis is where a lot of the teamwork in Dreamlords appears; one can be a very skilled RTS player, but that only gets you half the way; the rest is about having a competent and devoted convergence watching your back.\n\nJonric: Since you brought up the crafting element, how does it work? Is it possible to create rare or unique items?\n\nMarcus Andrews: Players can become crafters by researching specifically for this. Crafting enables them to create items or armors within their skill range, given that they have the formula. Formulas determine what ingredients make which item. Since crafting takes a fair commitment, crafters often collaborate with resource gatherers that specialize in extracting rare resources.\n\nIngredients, formulas and the actual item can be rare or unique as in only acquirable from killing a boss or in PvP. Sometimes, the formula can be common, but one ingredient is unique or vice versa. The items themselves are a vital part in keeping units usable. A seemingly weak unit can become very usable if equipped correctly.\n\nJonric: How do missions, events and quests factor into the play of your game, and what factors differentiate them?\n\nMarcus Andrews: Our approach to missions is that they will be relevant since they are real. They are generated due to circumstances on your land, and therefore, they have relevance, they are caused by something and resolving them has a consequence.\n\nWe separate events and quests since events are generated due to the overall condition of your land while quests are enabled through a chain of technologies, buildings or other quests. Resolving a quest will take you further in the progression, while resolving an event will give you some loot and rid you of a de-buff.\n\nAlongside the negative events that can create de-buffs, there are also special events that don't, but rather provide a special resource or item if the mission is completed.\n\nJonric: What happens when you're defeated? What kinds of penalties apply, and can units be destroyed permanently?\n\nMarcus Andrews: We employ an event system that tracks what you do in a battle; depending on these events and the difference in rating between you and your opponent, you are awarded loot and resources regardless of whether you win or lose. The winner does get a significant bonus to all events.\n\nJon Selin: We want to encourage our players to play as much as possible, which is why there isn't much of a detrimental effect if you lose a fight. However, your units can be killed permanently if there is a particularly tough battle and you haven't put enough effort into your medical score. It's not that serious though; it is more of a road bump than \"Oh my god, now I'm screwed.\" However, excitement definitely increases as the stakes go up, so this is something that we are still tweaking and debating. Time will tell.\n\nJonric: What kind of system have you designed for alliances among groups of players? And how viable is it to play as an individual?\n\nMarcus Andrews: Players are always put in a Convergence that consists of roughly 15 players. You can think of these allies as your neighbors. The convergence is the local political arena where the players vote for a chancellor, decide upon trade roles, etc. There is no way to form alliances between convergences.\n\nJon Selin: The convergence is central to the Dreamlords experience; the possibility for collaboration within one is vast. Members that are part of convergences that work as well oiled machines are quite a lot more powerful than those where the players try to play as lone wolves. This is where a lot of the teamwork in Dreamlords appears; one can be a very skilled RTS player, but that only gets you half the way; the rest is about having a competent and devoted convergence watching your back.\n\nJonric: What engine and other technology are you using? What kind of user interface, camera control and system requirements can we anticipate?\n\nDavid Ros多n: We are building Dreamlords on the Torque Game Engine, Torque Shader Engine and Garage Games' RTS package. The player has full control over the camera within mission boundaries, but has restricted view based on fog of war. We are not ready to disclose system requirements, but since we are going to distribute it by digital distribution, our future players can test it out themselves first.\n\nif you play a lot, you will of course have an advantage, but playing 10 times as much as someone won't make your Dreamlord or Patria 10 times as powerful. The main advantage that hardcore players have is skill and experience\n\nMarcus Andrews: One important thing is that the RTS GUI that can bee seen on screenshots from Dreamlords today is not the final product.\n\nJonric: What about on the server side? How does your technology differ from those of other persistent state games?\n\nDavid Ros多n: This will all come down to demand. Our plan is to have a very scalable solution where we easily can set up a new range of servers if needed. As we don't have a large world where players run around like in a standard MMORPG, we do not suffer the same problems as they do. We just need web servers and database servers for the web part, and game servers for the RTS lobby and matches.\n\nJonric: What are your primary objectives in the critical area of community development, and how will you promote its growth, both in the game and outside?\n\nMarcus Andrews: Our ambition is that players will stick with their convergence and make new friends through it. We are looking into ways to invite entire guilds into Dreamlords, but currently, 15 players together is the largest group of allies allowed. Since players are forced to work together in the convergences in order to advance, we hope this will create friendships in and out of the game.\n\nJon Selin: One could claim that Dreamlords is its community, even more so than most MMOs, since teamwork is so vital, and it isn't really possible to play completely alone. Needless to say, streamlining and expanding the means of communication is a something we will never stop doing.\n\nJonric: Since online worlds evolve over time, what are the key directions we can expect Dreamlords to follow in the future?\n\nJon Selin: One of the things we are looking at is expanding multiplayer challenges in different directions, new types of challenges involving many players. Another thing is the ability to declare Convergence Wars that stretch over a significant amount of time. Then there are the usual content updates in terms of quests, special abilities, new events, new technologies, art, etc. It is a bit early to promise anything about the post-launch development, since we are in alpha testing at the moment.\n\nJonric: What will the revenue model for Dreamlords be, and what considerations led to the selection of this model?\n\nDavid Ros多n: We will have the client available for digital distribution, and everyone can create a free trial account that will be valid for a certain period of time. After this period has expired, the player can choose to quit or pay a subscription fee. The trial account might be restricted to some extent to prevent abuse, etc., and we are confident that enough players will love this \"New Online Experience\" (as we call it) and stick with the game for quite some time.\n\nThe choice of revenue model is partly based on the fact that we want this gaming experience to evolve together with the Dreamlords community. We plan to use the revenue to invest in the game and make it more enjoyable as time passes, with expansions and new features on a regular basis. After all, we make the game for our players, not for ourselves, and this model is the best way to ensure Dreamlords gets to be the best it can be.\n\nJonric: What kinds of gamers will be attracted to Dreamlords, and how viable will it be for players who don't wish or aren't able to play large numbers of hours?\n\nJon Selin: Dreamlords is a unique concept with nothing like it on the market today. It will appeal to RTS gamers who feel that they want a more significant reward for each match, to strategy gamers who want to pit their minds against others, to competitive gamers who want to be seen standing on the top of the hill, and to very casual gamers who just want to log in and fiddle with things every now and then and talk to their friends.\n\nDreamlords is somewhat self-balancing since when you play PvP matches, you face someone with a rating close to your own. This means that if you are a casual player, you will still have exciting matches against other players that are roughly on the same level. There are also some diminishing return functions in effect, which means that sure, if you play a lot, you will of course have an advantage, but playing 10 times as much as someone won't make your Dreamlord or Patria 10 times as powerful. The main advantage that hardcore players have is skill and experience, not absurdly powerful avatars.\n\nA major advantage that we're very happy to have here at RPG Vault is the willingness of many developers to spend the time necessary to answer our interview questions in a substantial and thus highly edifying manner. Accordingly, as we look forward to seeing Dreamlords in person later this week at E3, we thank the Lockpick Entertainment trio of Marcus Andrews, Jon Selin and David Ros多n for giving us plenty of good reasons to track their title even more closely."
