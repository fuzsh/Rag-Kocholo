As I was drafting this post, I noticed how full this year truly was and how much I had done, and honestly it was quite special to say the least. So, in no particular order: - Ran the third successful edition of Khaddit Beirut's Gaming Academy with over 650 participants and 23 sessions on design, development, art, music, storytelling, and business, all for free - Was chosen as part of the Game Awards’ Future Class as one of fifty game developers that (hopefully) represent the bright, bold, and inclusive future of the games industry - Released another game with Falafel Games called مصباح - Spoke at the International Game Developers Association (IGDA®) PathfindinGS Conference about the importance of representing your own culture in your games - Spoke at devcom about the Gaming Academy and the state of gamedev in the MENA (and made some amazing friends there!) - Won second place in the Pocket Gamer Connects' Big Indie Mobile Pitch with Nifty Craft at Helsinki - Designed and developed the award winning Eco Builder game with the Environment and Sustainable Development Unit (ESDU) at the American University of Beirut - Was chosen as the IGDA Incubation SIG’s Middle Eastern representative - Created and ran the Towards a Free Palestine Game Jam - Created a game prototype about olive trees and life after war - Ran the 2023 The Global Game Jam event at The ARK Networks and totaled 3 game jams held that year - Was chosen again as part of the Theme Committee for the Global Game Jam 2024 edition (loved working with Ville Heiskanen again!) - Successfully went from ideation to prototyping with Talal and Madiha Zein AUB Innovation Park, creating GIGS (Gamedev Initiative for the Global South) and currently working on super exciting stuff with Rafif Kalantan رفيف كلنتن Met some of my heroes of the games industry like Rami Ismail and Fawzi Mesmar - Taught two semesters at AUB, giving a course on Narrative Design and helping students create a total of around 30 narrative based games - Gave a VR workshop at the Lebanese American University at the invitation of my wonderful friend Dahlia Khodur - Gave an intro to Unity workshop to the LAU CS Club I didn’t realize how much could actually be completed in 12 months, and honestly it explains why I’ve been feeling burnt out recently. Hopefully I’ll learn to pace myself better in 2024. Onwards and upwards!"
