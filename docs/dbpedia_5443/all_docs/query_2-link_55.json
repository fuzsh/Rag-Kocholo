        "text": "He had one good game against United since coming back, but generally looks overwhelmed and struggles to impact the game like Jack.\n\nyoud think he'd hit the ground running with a stable preseason behind him. is it too early to give him this much responsibiity?\n\nDon't feel the problem is with Ramsey. He didn't have a great game today but van Persie and Rosicky were easily worse, and they're supposed to be the experienced ones. Put him next to Wilshere and Walcott next time and he'll play much better. At least he didn't shun responsibility out there today.\n\nI do think it's a season too early for him to start if we want to win anything, but the game against Newcastle tells us nothing.\n\nGot to give him a few games. He's still bedding in and with Rosicky playing deep the midfield was a mess in general today.\n\nWe definitely need to sing a midfielder to at the very least rotate with Rambo though.\n\nNeeds to learn how to control himself (fitness-wise i mean). Like i said in the match thread, he looked dead at a few points during the game. He even did the famous Denilson-jog-back when we were under pressure at one point.\n\nWe definitely need someone else to come in at CM if only just for rotation purposes.\n\nJack van Gercott wrote:\n\nhe was neat but ultimately had little impact on the game qs\n\nEven if that was the case, isn't that just as per when it comes to Rosicky?\n\nScary to think that he is on course to get 30 plus Premier League games barring any injuries this season (I know, I know) without doing absolutely anything to merit it.\n\notfgoon wrote:\n\nSeemed like Aaron was playing deeper today and think you're taking away a couple of his best attributes (runs into the box and goalscoring ability) by doing that.\n\nWe quite clearly don´t play the same roles at CM when Cesc isn´t playing. They are a trio where Song has the main defensive responsibility. Anyway you look at it - Ramsey was very disappointing for the 2nd straight game.\n\nI agree with Klaus that I always felt this to be a season too soon for Ramsey and that we needed Cesc to stay at least one more year. Wenger is clearly right now trying to fast track him as he did with Wilshere. If he does - we will pay for his education with dropped points. Like today."
