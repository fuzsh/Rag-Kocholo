        "text": "The Game[]\n\nDeveloped in Skovde, Sweden, the original Dreamlords incarnation launched in February 2007 and ran until October 2007 when the team decided to revamp the game design which is today known as Dreamlords: The Reawakening. The development team at Lockpick Entertainment borrows much of its talent from the University of Skovde, and operations are overseen by CEO, David Ros√©n. The game itself is built around the Torque Game Engine developed by Garage Games. The game constantly evolved taking into consideration much of the feedback offered by the gaming community. Aeria Games acquired the license to distribute Dreamlords: The Reawakening in June 2008 and they were excited to blend their first-class gaming community support to such a captivating game. Aeria launched their offering in August 2008."
