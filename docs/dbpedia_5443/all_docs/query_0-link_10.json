Dreamlords is online only, and is free to play with an option to pay for additional benefit. It includes in-game currency called Tribute that is used to buy items like spells to aid the players.\n\nThe game uses both a browser game and a downloadable real-time strategy client. Dreamlords also includes elements of role-playing games.\n\nDreamlords was acquired for North American release in July 2008 by Aeria Games and Entertainment. A German version of the game was published by gamigo in July 2007. The game was re-launched in July 2008 with new features and the new sub-title \"The Re-Awakening\".\n\nThe Aeria Games site and the Gamigo site have since closed.[citation needed]\n\nGameplay[ | ]\n\nIn the web-based game, players are given a section of land under their control. Tasks such as founding cities, researching technologies, building structures, and engaging in trade are accomplished through the web interface.\n\nWith a downloaded client, the Dreamlords client functions similar to a real-time strategy game. The client is used primarily to fight battles and do quests.\n\nReferences[ | ]\n\n[ | ]\n\nOfficial website\n\nDreamlords preview at Eurogamer\n\nDreamlords article at IGN\n\nDreamlords Interview at IGN\n\nTemplate:Torque Game Engine games"
