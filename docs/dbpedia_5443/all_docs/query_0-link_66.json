The game is one of an extreme minority to implement Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to breed new superior computer generated players who additionally can learn from the strategies of their human adversaries.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can make the behavior of the computer agent more interesting, varied and believable as it has learned behaviors rather than rules being pre-programmed to determine behavior. Genetic algorithms use techniques inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and survival of the fittest via natural selection: a population of individuals undergo selection in a system where variation inducing operators such as crossover of genes and ongoing mutations are present. The evolution starts from a population of individuals and happens in generations.\n\nIn each generation the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated and based on this multiple individuals are randomly selected and modified (recombined and possibly mutated) to form a new population. The new population is then used in the next iteration of the algorithm. A fitness function is used to evaluate individuals, and reproductive success varies with fitness. The results are the average fitness being increased with each generation.\n\nGA evolved computer agents/drivers are being introduced in Darkwind for specific track/car combinations in the racing environment. Effective racing lines for these combinations are being evolved through the use of waypoints. Computer drivers use these waypoints during the game to influence their behavior as they navigate static and moving obstacles on the racetrack. This provides an evolved understanding of the overall shape of the track. The GAs have yielded an improvement of up to 30% in computer driver behavior, but more importantly the use of GAs can make the behavior of the driver more human like.\n\nDarkwind players are varied, and while some prefer Player-V-Player conflicts, others prefer to team up against computer adversaries. The introduction of GA evolved computer agents benefits all players and increases the challenge for the most effective players.\n\nAI is also being deployed in the wilderness area of the game for efficient path finding, obstacle avoidance and terrain navigation. The routes taken by human players over thousands of journeys per week as they navigate the wilderness are used as a form of route planning consensus by the computer agents in a similar manner to that of how ants use pheromones to mark their trail and guide following ants. If the trail is successful and more cars use it, the guidance becomes more intense and denser, whereas other trails fade out. This is much more effective than doing a cost-surface analysis where the computer agent makes a computational evaluation of the landscape around them as they traverse it, and therefore once again leads to more human like decisions and challenging opponents.\n\nNew Browser Based Games Added\n\n07-31-2010\n\nThe Latest Games added to GameOgre.com's Directory include Sanctioned Renegades, Castle of Heroes, MineCraft Classic, and Stellar Dawn.
