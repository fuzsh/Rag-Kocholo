        "text": "http://www.dreamlords.com\n\nthis is using the torque shader engine advanced\n\nsign up and help test and mold this new RTS game\n\nEDIT: forgot to explain what torque is for all the n00bs who dont know, its the engine that was behind the tribes games, just newer and better!!!!\n\ntorque netcode can allow a 28.8 modem user to play online along side cable/dsl users without being hammered by horrible crippling lagg, infact its the most efficent netcode your gonna find next to that used in ultima online.(uo can be played on 14.4!!!)\n\nfor moar info on torque, use google\n\nhttp://www.garagegames.com/products/torque/tgea/\n\na full fetured game engine for a very reasonable price!!!\n\noh and torque handles MASSIVE maps far better then any other engine to date, you can litterly creat a whole planet in 1 map without having to have load zones!!!!\n\n3 classes/races, best to read them on the site, i get the feeling there will be more later, this is an alpha/beta class project so you know its still being molded\n\ndamn man! I have to wait till 2ish my time! why man, why?\n\nhospital has a tight security on web, because they use it for bed side service. meaning, tablet pcs allow dr's, nurse to order anything for the patient, and they were trying to add a pc to every room for internet access. so the only reason I can acess this forum is that the head of I.S. uses it to look up different problems himself. I have connections\n\nomg, eather its a rich person hospitile or you have had some VERY nasty food and anything looks good in compairson.......or ur mouths wattering because ur trying not to gag\n\nall jokes aside, the only thing i have ever had at hosp that wasnt nasty has been poboy samiches and lime jello, the container for the jello taisted better then the chicken they served!!!!!(thats pretty bad since the jello came in a plastic cup )"
