http://games.activision.com/games/wolfenstein/\n\nA very good free FPS. Originally an expansion pack for Return To Castle Wolfenstein. Enemy Territory became a fully free downloadable game.\n\nThis game encourages you to work as a team, but unfortunately not many people do and just want the XP for special weapons and features. This is multiplayer only, I played this for a while, then I lost interest.\n\n9/10\n\nWarRock International\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.warrock.net/\n\nThe English version of the popular WarRock, the much anticipated pre-release beta has begun and has recieved mixed views. A selection of new maps and vehicles have been included now and the community is growing.\n\n7.8/10\n\nAmericas Army: Special Forces\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.americasarmy.com/\n\nA game created by the Army, it's a tactical team-based shooter. So there is no run 'n' gunning here! You also need a fairly good PC to run it. The gameplay is different to any other FPS I have encountered, if you don't take it slow and work with your team, you will get shot.\n\n8/10\n\nPlanetside: Reserves\n\nOfficial Site: http://planetside.station.sony.com/reserves/\n\nThe free version of the popular Planetside, one of the few actual MMOFPS's.\n\nAvailable for one year, the game allows players to play the full game Planetside for the duration of the service, but cannot upgrade their character after a certain level.\n\nA lengthy 1.8GB download prevents me from trying the game at the moment, so I can't provide much feedback.\n\n?/10\n\nTrue Combat Elite\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.truecombat.com/intro.php\n\nA modification for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, meaning you will have to have that game to install and play this.\n\nA much slower paced game than Enemy Territory, realistically modeled weapons and environments bring Enemy Territory into urban territory.\n\n8/10.\n\nTremulous\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.tremulous.net/\n\nTremulous is a free, open source game that blends a team based FPS with elements of an RTS. Players can choose from 2 unique races, aliens and humans. Players on both teams are able to build working structures in-game like an RTS. These structures provide many functions, the most important being spawning. The designated builders must ensure there are spawn structures or other players will not be able to rejoin the game after death. Other structures provide automated base defense (to some degree), healing functions and much more...\n\n?/10\n\nFlamewar!\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.moondoggieent.com/games/flamewar.html\n\nFlamewar! is an amusing freeware game, based on popular first-person shooter gameplay, created to poke fun at certain aspects of internet culture. Your goal in each level is to defeat all the other forum-goers, but to do that you must avoid being flamed yourself. Play to beat levels and see all of the forums represented in the game, or just enjoy the unique art style of the graphics.\n\n?/10\n\nBZFlag\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.bzflag.org/\n\nBZFlag is a free multiplayer multiplatform 3D tank battle game. The name stands for Battle Zone capture Flag. It runs on Irix, Linux, *BSD, Windows, Mac OS X and other platforms. It's one of the most popular games ever on Silicon Graphics machines.\n\n?/10\n\nGunz: The Duel\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.gunzonline.com/\n\nA fast and frantic third-person online shooter. With rusty swords and and powerful weapons. Alot of people like this game, I didn't like it very much though. It gets very repetitive, the servers are usually full and it can get very laggy at times.\n\nIt's not exactly newbie-friendly either.\n\n7/10\n\nStarSiege Tribes\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.sierra.com/product.do?gamePlatformId=286\n\nDownload: http://www.fileplanet.com/140246/140...ibes-Full-Game\n\nI used to love this game when I had my old PII. It was very addicting and had great gameplay. The graphics may look dated but it is perfect for the lower end computer user, includes several ground and aircraft vehicles for varied gameplay, also includes quite alot of weapons.\n\n7/10\n\nPhosphor\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.rasterwerks.com/game/phosphor/beta1.asp\n\nAn early beta of a full FPS in Shockwave.\n\nRuns in your browser, quite addicting and is suprising to see how good the visuals are in such a small game.\n\n6/10\n\nDispatch Of Army\n\nOfficial Site: http://doa.cube-asia.com/\n\nA farely average FPS. I didn't like it... If their objective was realism then they have failed on all fronts, it's fun for a while. But soon gets boring. If you like Counter-Strike, then the graphics and gameplay is very similar, just based in a different Vietnam setting.\n\n4/10\n\nHeadshot: Online\n\nOfficial Site: http://headshot.kr.games.yahoo.com/\n\nA Korean FPS, as I don't speak or understand Korean I can not register, therefor I cannot play. Reminds me of Counter-Strike though...?\n\n?/10\n\nWarsow\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.warsow.net/\n\nHaven't had a chance to play this. It's based on the Quake 2 engine. Doesn't have any appealing features though, it has fast-paced gameplay focused on trix (trick jumps) and art of movement.\n\n?/10\n\nCodeRED: Alien Arena\n\nOfficial Site: http://happypenguin.org/images/team1.jpg\n\nA good FPS, graphics are not too shabby and there are some weird characters to play. Can get pretty boring after a while as there is virtually nothing original or special in the game.\n\n6/10\n\nNexuiz\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.nexuiz.com\n\nA good FPS, it's supposedely not as good as CodeRED but I haven't played it. Well worth a try though, it is a 3d deathmatch game project, created online by a team of developers called Alientrap.\n\n?/10\n\nPurge Jihad\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.purgejihad.com/\n\nPurge Jihad is an online-only PC computer game. It is a hybrid First-Person-Shooter / Role-Playing-Game set in the near future accounting a war between the diametrically opposed forces of science-fiction (the Order) and fantasy (the Chosen). Technology versus magic. Science versus religion. It is a great divine war, where followers pray for intervention from the extraterrestrial deity Evod or the supernatural deity Mabus.\n\n?/10\n\nJakSparo:\n\nDont waste your time downloading Pure Jihad, maybe it was just me (though im obligated to doubt it), but there is practically NO ONE, infact, since I uninstalled it this morning, there is now NO ONE on the game. last night, just me and some assassin dude goin kill for kill for like 20 minutes.\n\nWolfenstein Enemy Territory: Fortress\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.etfgame.com/\n\nAnother MOD for Enemy Territory. Has different classes and weapons, fun for a while. Not many people online though, it's basically Quake 3. The medic class is pretty useless, nice varied weapons make it rather enjoyable though.\n\n6/10\n\nKuma/War\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.kumawar.com/\n\nThis game is also available to buy instore, it's an army based strategic shooter that relives important events in the War In Iraq and such. Like the capture of Saddam Huissien. I like this game, it's very laggy online and the maps take a while to download, you also need to download each mission seperatly, which also takes a long time.\n\n6/10\n\nHidden And Dangerous\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.globalstarsoftware.com/ga...rousdeluxe/pc/\n\nAn ex-commercial game that has become F2P. It's not a very good game but not a very bad one. Quite challenging too. Worth a try, several different vehicles to roam around in, jeeps, tanks, boats, planes, etc. It has rather poor AI and sluggish controls don't help, it's hard to locate the enemy and the chances are that \"if you can see them, they can see you\".\n\n5/10\n\nControl Monger\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.controlmonger.com/\n\nHaven't played this, currently in Beta I think. Looks quite good, heard that there is a lack of players though, different robot classes make for a more varied gameplay expierence.\n\n?/10\n\nCube\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.cubeengine.com\n\nAnother game I haven't played, Quake-like. Looks like a fun frag-fest when you have nothing better to do.\n\n?/10\n\nagent00x's review:\n\nFast paced action with a large variety of weapons and lots of servers to play on, but limited maps make the game slightly repetitive. It's very good fun though to play casually and it's small in size.\n\n7/10\n\nDigital Paint: Paintball 2.0\n\nOfficial Site: http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~digitalpaint/news.php\n\nA paintball game? Various game modes to keep you entertained, was orginally a Quake 2 mod. Now a fully downloadable game.\n\n6/10\n\nKkrieger\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.theprodukkt.com/kkrieger.html\n\nA game in 96kb! Currently in Beta it has alot of bugs and compatibility issues, very simplistic and can get very boring. Nice lighting effects though.\n\n2/10\n\nKingsborn\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.megagames.com/news/html/f...ingsborn.shtml\n\nA free FPS with online modes and single player frag matches, haven't played though.\n\n?/10\n\nInside The Beast\n\nDownload: http://www.otssoftware.com/Freeware/InsideTheBeast.exe\n\nInside The Beast is a 3D First Person Shooter (FPS) game. You must go Inside The Beast and fight through his minions before he can unleash his evil on the world. You must succeed where your two best friends failed. When they failed, the Beast buried their hearts in concrete markers. Destroy their markers and retrieve their hearts to give yourself more lives. That will be your only assistance while you fight ghosts, skeletons, zombies, mad axmen, mutants, and more. Don't become the Beast's next victim!\n\nSystem Specs are perfect for the lower end users, quite fun actually!\n\n6/10\n\nGolden Warriors\n\nDownload: http://www.otssoftware.com/Freeware/GoldenWarriors.exe\n\nAnother game for lower end users, abit like Indiana Jones.. Infact, it's probably based on Indiana Jones, collect the gold. But in this game, the gold fights back. Ooo scary!\n\n4/10\n\nSpace Fighter X11\n\nDownload: http://www.otssoftware.com/Freeware/SpaceFighterX11.exe\n\nA space game, yes.. A third person space game, just destroy ships to get energy for your ship. Wow\n\n3/10\n\nDoom\n\nDownload: http://compactiongames.about.com/lib...oom95_free.htm\n\nThe game that started it all! DOOM! Very dated now but certainly a classic.\n\n8.5/10\n\nSkulltag\n\nA free online server browser for Doom 1/2\n\nhttp://www.skulltag.com/[/b]\n\nVital Sign\n\nOfficial Site: http://vitalsign.igamesasia.com.sg/g...ife_system.asp\n\nPlayed it, seems like a very good game! The community is small and it is hard to get onto a server with players without it being full, already in a game, or the host is behind a firewall. But nice graphics, and gameplay that is fun yet addictive, you should really try it!\n\n8.5/10\n\nWarRock\n\nOfficial Site: http://warrock.nexon.com/warrock/page/gnx.aspx\n\nDownload: http://warrock.nexon.com/warrock/pag...pport/download\n\nRegistration: http://www.nexon.com/KR/Login/SetupActivex_sp2.html\n\nKSSN Needed\n\nAn Asian first person shooter, no idea how to register and I think you may need a KSSN to sign up to Nexon, not sure. Looks very fun though!\n\n?/10\n\nAcid Arena Turbo\n\nDownload: http://plnehry.idnes.cz/obrazek/acidarena1_th.jpg\n\nAcid Arena is a death-match orientated game, you will have to blast your carnival-like, freaky opponents into oblivion whilst avoiding similar tactics from their side.\n\nHaven't played.\n\n?/10\n\nNavy Training Exercises: Strike & Retrieve\n\nDownload: http://www.fileplanet.com/155134/150...etrieve-Client\n\nThe first of a series of NTE games, this title was built by the Navy as an elite testing simulator, players are able to measure their abilities to handle the intense pressure situations and technical demands of being a real Navy recruit. Try it out for yourself and see!\n\n?/10\n\nAlien Trilogy\n\nDownload: http://www.fileplanet.com/10549/1000.../Alien-Trilogy\n\nAlien Trilogy features all the gut-churning fear of the complete Alien saga in one black-death, white- knuckle nightmare. Welcome to the first-person, 3-D blitzkrieg of overwhelming horror that no one can resist!\n\nExcept me!\n\n5/10\n\nSpace Cowboy\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.spacecowboy.net/\n\nI haven't played Space Cowboy yet, looks quite good. Try it.\n\n?/10\n\nWulfram\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.wulfram.com/images/shots/pic51.jpg\n\nI personally haven't played this, it's supposed to have \"excellent gameplay\" so it's worth a try. It allows up to 64 players per server. the players in your team can help build new bases, help place strategic elements that allow spaceships to maneuver, help your frontline tanks by going in with a medic unit and repairing their damage on the battlefield.\n\n?/10\n\nOutpost\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.outpost.com.my/\n\nThe site/servers are down due to e-games reviewing the feedback the game has been given.\n\n2/10\n\nRay Crash\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.raycrash.net.sg/\n\nLooks extremely fun to play, I had problems launching the game though...\n\n?/10\n\nAces High II\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.hitechcreations.com/frindex.html\n\nA two week free trial is available, but I think certain rooms are free forever?\n\n6/10\n\nIronWar\n\nOfficial Site: http://ironwar.e-games.com.my/\n\nAnother Mech game, not many players and e-games servers are hardly reliable.\n\n5/10\n\nRealm Wars\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.realmwarsgame.com/\n\nA fantasy themed first person style action game that emphasises massive team combat on an epic scale. Players can choose a race, customize your abilities and your appearance with an impressive array of weapons, armor and items -- then prepare for battle!\n\nI haven't played Realm Wars, but I really should.\n\n?/10\n\nLegends\n\nDownload: http://games.softpedia.com/get/Freew.../Legends.shtml\n\nLegends is a fast-paced first-person-perspective online multiplayer game. The game is designed to take advantage of the beautiful environments available from the Torque engine it is based on, while still offering the breakneck pacing and variety of styles available from such classics as Quake and Tribes.\n\n?/10\n\nX Operations\n\nDownload: http://www.megagames.com/news/html/f...erations.shtml\n\nX Operations is the game a member mistaked for \"Gay Online\" in a rather pointless thread a few months ago. X Operations is a 3D game played in the first person perspective, in which you are a special operstive and have to carry out numerous missions. Some missions require you to face terrorists and evildoers on your own while in others you are part of an elite squad.\n\nX Operations offers an impressive total of 33 missions and 16 weapon types including pistols, sub-machine guns etc.\n\nThis is another impressive freeware title which although lacking the polished and refined graphics of its commercial counterparts does offer the player countless hours of fun.\n\n2/10\n\nDeath Illustrated\n\nDownload: http://www.fileplanet.com/118293/110...llustrated-0.6\n\nDeath Illustrated is another unbelievable freeware game. Think of Quake 2, but free! Built on the CUBE engine it has not-too-shabby 3D graphics and the theme for the game is \"Deathmatching inside a three dimensional Comic Book\".\n\n?/10\n\nAction Quake II\n\nDownload And Installation Guide: http://action.telefragged.com/\n\nAxion Quake is an action oriented first person shooter. It is based on action movies, where the premise is to kill stylishly. Axion Quake was a standalone game from this Quake II mod, but has ceased to exist.\n\n6/10\n\nCotropitorii\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.2baddesign.ro/cotropitorii/index.html\n\nCotropitorii is a 3rd person (1st person too, if you press a key) 3D action shooter game with a fast paced story that will make you rethink everything you know about history, or not. I haven't played this as I am waiting for the first public release.\n\n?/10"
