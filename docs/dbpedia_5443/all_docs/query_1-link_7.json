        "text": "The Thul are a tribal society that tends to live in grouped villages, with each cluster encircling its leader. Although not great in numbers, their armies are nonetheless imposing since individual members of the race can tower as high as 10 meters. Also gifted with tremendous natural strength and endurance, they are, not surprisingly, renowned for their prowess in close combat, where they are fully capable of standing against and defeating enemy forces that are far larger numerically. Always at the center of the action, Steeltusks are battle-hardened fighters. Clad in heavy armor, they rely on sheer brawn and brute force. Blackhides are more agile and stealthy, qualities that make them highly effective using hit and run tactics. The Shaman is certainly capable in melee situations, and also possesses a bond with the land and spirits that enables devastating magic.\n\nIn Dreamlords, a massively multiplayer endeavor developed by Lockpick Entertainment, the Thul were one of the races we could choose to play. The game combined real-time strategy with RPG elements, casting us in the titular role, in control of a patria, a landmass floating in a reverie. Using the population and natural resources, we could construct buildings and assemble an army, with more choices available as our domains grew. We also had to create higher-level plans. In this respect, we could focus upon military might, cunning, mutually beneficial alliances and more in order to deal with threats such as monsters menacing our citizens, demonic summonings and the mysterious Reasonists as well as other players. With a second iteration, The Reawakening, now in beta, CEO and Executive Producer David Rosen recently looked back at the original, which launched early last year.\n\nThe Project\n\nDreamlords had the subtitle A New Online Experience, and that was in essence very true. It was a mix of different genres into something new, something different. We took a bowl, threw in some RTS, added persistency, a good core of strategy and a touch of RPG, then gave it all a swirl and served it hot and fresh from the kitchen, which was in the small Swedish city of Skovde where I and the rest of the team founded Lockpick Entertainment and embarked on this journey.\n\nIt was not an easy decision to postpone the release with our financing rapidly running low, but looking back, it was definitely something I don't regret doing.\n\nThe actual start of the journey was a mixing in itself. We were 10 hungry developers who quickly became 13. Unlucky 13? No, not for us. ;)\n\nWe had a few weeks of discussions and debates until we singled out the project we wanted to do, and how we wanted to do it. Several people's ideas and influences served as the foundation ground for what Dreamlords turned out to be. Jon Selin, our former Lead Designer, had his influences, and I had mine. As an old fan of Utopia and of the Warcraft series, I missed a deep challenging strategy game that also held some good RTS action. I wanted to see a merging of the two into something new. Jon, being more of a hardcore player and MMO fan, added that to the blend as well.\n\nAfter two and a half years of hard work, sweat, laughter and sometimes panic, we managed to launch the game on our own in February 2007 - not bad for a team that consisted of me and a group of students. For us, this was a huge success. We received good reviews, and our player base was really appreciative of our work. We managed 99 percent uptime the first week, and ran 24/7 support with great response time. We also signed a deal with the German company Gamigo, which launched a localized version of the game.\n\nHowever, we matured, and so did the game. We felt that some things didn't quite work the way we wanted, and we also lost a few team members to larger companies in the Nordic region. Under our new Lead Designer, Iona Rosin we decided that we needed to make changes to the game. These would take a lot of work, and we felt the chances of doing this while maintaining good support and service to our players were slim to none. In October 2007, we made the decision to take the game offline for a short while, and to embark on a new journey: Dreamlords - The Reawakening. We invited all our players to test the new version, and the first early alpha saw the light late last year.\n\nThe Team\n\nThe original team was me as the Executive Producer plus two game designers, five artists, four programmers and one composer. When we started, all the others were students; all but the composer were at the University of Skovde, which happens to have an excellent program for computer game development. Over the years, we brought several more students into our team during certain periods so the overall size changed, although the core remained the same until after launch. We are currently about 10 to 12 developers and a few extras... once again, extremely talented students.\n\nTechnology\n\nBeing the new kids on the block, we didn't have a huge budget or the time and means to build an engine of our own. As a result, we did it the indie way; we went for the Torque Game Engine Advanced by Garage Games, together with some Microsoft products for the programmers. We couldn't hold back on the artist side though as we needed Maya... and man, those babies are expensive!\n\nDevelopment Timeline\n\nWhen we started out, we had to set up goals depending on our own reality, not the experience of others. Being a small development team, the planning was crucial as we had to make sure that our resources were being used in the most effective way.\n\nWhen we approached the original release date, we realized that the game simply wasn't good enough... it wasn't what we wanted. It was not an easy decision to postpone the release with our financing rapidly running low, but looking back, it was definitely something I don't regret doing.\n\nChanges and Enhancements\n\nThe game evolved a lot from the first drawings throught to launch. Originally, it was just to be a PvP game with no single-player content at all. Lots of things were added, and quite a few removed or at least postponed. As Dreamlords is an online game that we constantly upgrade and improve, there is no telling what the future holds. ;)\n\nBefore this, we couldn't even begin to imagine what it would be like to make a game. I think I speak for the entire team when I say that we wouldn't hesitate one second if given the choice of doing it all over again.\n\nWhat we launched was a good solid core of what we wanted to achieve. One of the reviews or previews called it \"good, solid and rather addictive fun\", which, in my eyes, pretty much sums it up.\n\nMajor Challenges\n\nThere are several big challenges being an independent developer. Our team wasn't all that big, the marketing resources we had were limited, and since this was our first project, we didn't have any experience to draw from. In reality, all this meant we all had to be good not only at developing the game, but also at communicating with each other and finding creative solutions to our different challenges.\n\nAlso, along the way, we made sure to bring in the necessary expertise in the areas where we lacked it. We really did build a great network around our game, which has helped immensely now when we're working on The Reawakening.\n\nKey Strengths\n\nDreamlords was a completely new kind of game with a *very* competitive and challenging style of gameplay.\n\nWhen we released Dreamlords, there were no other games offering the same experience. Lately, I've noticed that a couple of competitors seem to be doing what we did a year ago, and well... they say that imitation is the highest form of flattery, so I guess I'm happy about it - but we all know that an original always is better than a copy!\n\nDreamlords was all about winning; it was highly competitive and definitely challenging for players. It took time to get into but was very rewarding once you mastered it.\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\nThere are details that you simply cannot know without actually experiencing them, and as with everything else in life, over time, we discovered areas where we realized Dreamlords could improve. Player feedback was crucial in this process, and one element we noticed was progression in the game and how it could be done in alternate ways. Also, we wanted to decrease the need for grinding and the requirement to alt-tab. Another insight, perhaps the most important one, was how both the game and the players would benefit in so many ways from moving away from the subscription-based model to free to play.\n\nAll of these happen to be among the new features and improvements you'll find in our new game, Dreamlords - The Reawakening.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nProbably the most important lesson we've learned during the process is that complexity can be your best friend... and your worst enemy. We wanted to make a deep and involving game, and I think we did a really good job in the end. The road though, was a bit bumpy at times since complexity tends to work both ways... it is a complex process to create complex content.\n\nAnother valuable lesson was that however thoroughly you plan, everything inevitably takes more time. Always.\n\nAudience Response\n\nWe are still taken back by all the positive attention we got, both during development and after release. Like we said, Dreamlords was not an easy or quick game, which was something that easily could have worked to our disadvantage when it came to reviews. All the reviewers (with one notable exception I still think is more hilarious than annoying) took time to learn and understand the game, played it and gave it really good reviews.\n\nI think we managed our efforts to reach out to the specialist game sites well enough, but maybe didn't do as well with the more mainstream ones. Dreamlords was never intended as a mainstream game, and I think it was viewed as being too hardcore.\n\nAs for the players, we had and still have a very strong community. Right from the start, we set out to develop close, friendly communication. Apart from common courtesy and business sense, this was an area where we really couldn't afford to fail. When you are as small as we, every player is important.\n\nDepending on how we define players, the reception was mostly good from all the people who learned and played the game. We're very happy with all the different reactions and feedback we've had, both positive and constructive. In the end, it will help us make Reawakening an even better game.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe original Dreamlords will moves into the next stage with the release of The Reawakening. This new installation is the result of the feedback we've had from players plus our own wishes. We've added many new features that didn't make into the original, we've updated other features, and we've made some major changes to make the new release a truly fun and challenging online gaming experience, while at the same time keeping all the good stuff. Same / same, but different! ;-)\n\nPersonal Thoughts\n\nTo develop a game is no easy task, and just like we stated in the original Dreamlords advertising, \"Not for the weak\". Before this, we couldn't even begin to imagine what it would be like to make a game. I think I speak for the entire team when I say that we wouldn't hesitate one second if given the choice of doing it all over again. It has given each one of us so much invaluable experience and good times, as well as challenges. In the end though, this is the best job in world, and I would never trade it.\n\nAs I write this, beta testing for The Reawakening is about to launch, so keep your eyes open. We'd like to see you there. Tell them I sent you...\n\nDavid Rosen\n\nExecutive Producer, Dreamlords\n\nCEO, Lockpick Entertainment\n\nWrap Reports are intended to complement reviews by providing a post-release viewpoint we seldom see, that of the developer and/or publisher.
