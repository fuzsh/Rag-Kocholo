The New South Wales (NSW) government has given the green light for the construction to start for the Sydney Western Harbour Tunnel in Australia.

Planning approval was granted on the AUS$14bn (£7.8bn) project, which also includes Warringah Freeway upgrade, last week.

The 6.5km Western Harbour Tunnel will stretch from the Warringah Freeway at Cammeray, across Sydney Harbour, to the WestConnex interchange at Rozelle.

It is expected that construction on the 4km Warringah Freeway upgrades will begin later this year.

Last month, the shortlist for the procurement and delivery of the scheme was announced. It was made up of Bechtel Infrastructure Australia; Harbour West Partners – a consortium comprising Macquarie Capital, Jacobs and RPS; and Laing O'Rourke Australia

It is understood that the formal request for tender will be released to the shortlisted applicants shortly, with the announcement of a potential development partner expected to be made later this year.

NSW transport minister Andrew Constance said: “The Western Harbour Tunnel will take pressure off the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour Tunnel, Anzac Bridge and Western Distributor corridors to revolutionise transport capacity in and around our city.”
