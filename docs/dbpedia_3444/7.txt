Construction on a new Sydney Harbour tunnel has been approved to start next year. The Western Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway upgrade is expected to be completed in 2026. Major construction on the Warringah Freeway upgrades will begin in late 2021, while some work will begin as early as March.

The government is taking every precaution in the development of these tunnels and a dedicated team of environmental specialists have been assigned to the project. Among concessions made to the project in order for its approval are a new pedestrian and cycle path through the Cammeray Golf Club as well as offsets to the marine environment. There is also a promise to replace every tree removed during construction with two new ones.

Transport Minister Andrew Constance said, “This city-shaping piece of infrastructure will deliver a vital boost to the NSW economy, with the tunnel and freeway upgrade, along with Beaches Link, expected to support around 15,000 full-time equivalent jobs”.
