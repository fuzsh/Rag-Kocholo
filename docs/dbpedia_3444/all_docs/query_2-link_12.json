        "text": "Construction of a second road tunnel under Sydney Harbour should be a national priority because it will ease chronic congestion along the city’s busiest road corridor, the country’s infrastructure adviser says.\n\nIn backing the state’s case for the project, Infrastructure Australia warned that travel times and congestion on existing cross-harbour routes will worsen without the 6.5-kilometre Western Harbour Tunnel and an upgrade to the Warringah Freeway at North Sydney.\n\nThe independent infrastructure adviser said it was confident the benefits of the multibillion-dollar road project would exceed the costs, citing gains of up to $1.30 for every dollar spent building the tunnel and upgrading the freeway.\n\nThe NSW government has yet to reveal the estimated cost of the project, which will also act as a western bypass of the Sydney CBD by connecting the tolled tunnel to the $16.8 billion WestConnex motorway at Rozelle.\n\nLeaked government documents in 2017 estimated the combined cost of building the Western Harbour Tunnel and a connecting road tunnel to the northern beaches at $14 billion. The Beaches Link will be built separately, and was not part of Infrastructure Australia’s latest analysis.\n\nNSW Transport and Roads Minister Andrew Constance seized on the infrastructure adviser’s analysis to highlight the need for the federal government to inject funding into the road project.\n\n“Given their own infrastructure body is telling them how important this is, it would be really appropriate if we started seeing some really significant dollars going into the Western Harbour Tunnel from the Commonwealth,” he said.\n\nMr Constance said it was well known that the Sydney Harbour Bridge was a “choke point” and the second harbour road tunnel would have “major benefits for the entire network”.\n\nConstruction of the tunnel will start next year, and is expected to be completed in 2026. Work on the Warringah Freeway upgrade is due to begin late this year.\n\nLoading\n\nNorth Sydney mayor Jilly Gibson said a priority should be given to reducing the project’s impact on the North Sydney CBD from increased traffic flows onto Berry Street. “North Sydney Council and residents also need to be reassured that there will not be any net loss of open public space due to the infrastructure project,” she said.\n\nConcerns were also raised last year about the oversight of the dredging of contaminated sludge during the construction of the motorway project. Large prefabricated concrete tubes will be lowered from barges into a trench on the harbour floor to build the road tunnels.\n\nWeekday traffic on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Harbour Tunnel is forecast to rise to 300,000 vehicles a day by 2030, up from 250,000 at present."
