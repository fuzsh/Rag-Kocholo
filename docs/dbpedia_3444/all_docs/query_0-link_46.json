        "text": "The $1.18 billion design and construction contract has been awarded to CPB Contractors and Downer EDI Works in a joint venture for the Warringah Freeway upgrade.\n\nMinister for Transport and Roads Andrew Constance said the upgrade will reduce congestion and simplify the complex road corridor, which is used by up to 250,000 vehicles each day.\n\n“This crucial upgrade will make the Warringah Freeway more efficient and reliable for the drivers who use it every day, and will pave the way for the future Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link,” Mr Constance said.\n\n“More than 15,000 jobs will be created during construction of the entire Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link program, with about 600 direct jobs created for the Warringah Freeway upgrade.”\n\nEarly works are already underway with the main work to start early next year. Construction is expected to take approximately five years to complete, subject to the detailed design and construction program.\n\nMember for North Shore Felicity Wilson said: “The Warringah Freeway upgrade is part of the NSW Government’s commitment to reduce traffic on our local roads, and it will help create better connections for our community to the future Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link.”\n\nMember for Manly James Griffin said: “Community feedback has helped shape the Warringah Freeway upgrade, and the community will continue to be updated and involved as the entire Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link program progresses.”\n\nThe Warringah Freeway upgrade includes:\n\nUpgrade four-kilometres of the Warringah Freeway, between High Street at North Sydney and Willoughby Road at Naremburn, to reduce the amount of merging required, and improve safety and traffic flow.\n\nImprove interchanges with Falcon Street at Cammeray and High Street at North Sydney, including a new northbound on ramp at High Street which will ease pressure on the existing ramp at Berry Street.\n\nConnections to the future Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link.\n\nImproved public transport links, with a continuous southbound bus lane from Miller Street to the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nAround 2.5 kilometres of new and upgraded cycleways and pedestrian paths, integrated with public transport networks, including the future Victoria Cross metro station at North Sydney"
