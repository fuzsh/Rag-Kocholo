These projects are going ahead despite the Beaches Link cancellation and in light of a yet to be approved modification which further concentrates impacts on our residential school zones and key business districts.\n\nBay Precinct (Cammeray) and Naremburn Progress Association Committees have resolved to campaign together for better outcomes for our communities.You can be part of the campaign by completing the following actions. Please share this with your friends and neighbours. In under a week over 100 people have already sent more than 1000 emails to key decision makers using this letter campaign!\n\nCommunity Actions (Click the buttons below)\n\nBackground:\n\nOn the 21st November Bay Precinct, North Sydney held an urgent community meeting in light of progress on the project without amendment or review. The meeting rallied support for writing to key decision makers in light of many ongoing and new threats and emerging costs.\n\nThe Meeting was presented with 4 focus areas which need to be urgently reviewed by State Government Decision Makers:\n\nSpace\n\nStreets\n\nSMOG\n\nSense\n\nBay Precinct Presentation by Co-conveynor, Paul Walter- Space and Streets\n\nNaremburn Progress Association Presentation by President; Larissa Penn – SMOG and Sense\n\nCommunity Impact Statements Presented (pending additional statements from makers)\n\nWhy is Action Needed Urgently?\n\nA major Modification which moves even greater short and long term impacts into Cammeray and North Sydney\n\nAnnounced Commencement of the tunnelling project in Cammeray without the modification being approved\n\nCost blow outs of the project and significantly eroded cost/benefits\n\nThe fact that Millions in Beaches Link Infrastructure is still included in the design despite it being cancelled\n\nGrowing concern about pollution impacts in light of WHO pollution criteria being lowered based on health research\n\nNo clear plan to return the 7+ha of cleared vegetated space to the community – with more trees planned for removal now moving into Naremburn\n\nGrowing evidence that there is a very significant traffic impact on North Sydney and Willoughby – we have all seen the chaos caused by the Rozelle Interchange – a similar fate awaits us unless we see major changes\n\nLost opportunities to transform the corridor into sustainable transport rather than a zone growing in car dependency\n\nEvidence that the Rozelle Interchange has had extremely detrimental impacts on the Inner West and traffic modelling was insufficient\n\nRecommendations:\n\nWrite to Decision Makers to request urgent reassessment and mitigation (the government has changed since previous letters were written)\n\nConsider completing a petition to cancel the tunnel project (Stop the Tunnels)\n\nIndividual community members should write to the WHTBL Team, Local State Government Member and cc Council regarding any construction or property impacts as they occur\n\nReporting Construction Stage Impacts:\n\nWe recognise that there are many people in the area who are suffering greatly due to the construction impacts of this project – Bay Precinct and Naremburn Progress Association (and local organisations) are always happy to hear from you however it’s important that the right people are told about these impacts. Our focus currently is trying to get the government to re-assess the reason we are baring the brunt of this poorly justified program of works.\n\nEmail\n\nWestern Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link Team: whtbl@transport.nsw.gov.au.

Please keep your local council informed so that they can continue to advocate for impacted communities. By joining your local Progress Association or Precinct you can escalate unresolved issues and find support from others facing the same issues.\n\nContact Bay Precinct at: bayprecinct@gmail.com\n\nContact Naremburn Progress Association at: secretary@naremburnprogress.org.au\n\nFurther Information\n\nProject Documents\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel Portal (see notices and documents for up to date information)\n\nWarringah Freeway Portal (see notices and documents for up to date information)\n\nApproval Related Documents\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel Modification Application\n\nWestern Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway Project Assessment\n\nBeaches Link Project Assessment\n\nInfrastructure NSW Business Case Summary 2020"
