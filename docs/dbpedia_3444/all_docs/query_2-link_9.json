        "text": "The Western Harbour Tunnel (WHT) is part of the NSW Government’s biggest infrastructure program in history, changing the way people move as our motorways expand to better serve our growing city.\n\nBy creating a western bypass of the Sydney CBD, the Western Harbour Tunnel will take pressure off the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour Tunnel, Anzac Bridge and Western Distributor corridors to improve transport capacity in and around Sydney Harbour.\n\nIt connects to WestConnex at the Rozelle Interchange, crosses underneath Sydney Harbour between Birchgrove and Waverton, and connects with the Warringah Freeway near North Sydney via a 6.5 kilometre tunnel with three lanes in each direction.\n\nAs Sydney continues to grow, faster and more reliable trips are essential to reduce congestion. By creating a western bypass of the Sydney CBD, the Western Harbour Tunnel will take pressure off the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour Tunnel and Anzac Bridge.\n\nThis project is an important part of creating an integrated road and public transport network, which balances the needs of motorists and local communities and provide new levels of access to jobs, recreation, and services such as schools and hospitals.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel will provide improved transport connections with quicker access to public transport interchanges. It will enable future opportunities for new direct bus routes between the Inner West and North Sydney.\n\nThe Western Harbour tunnel is being delivered in two stages:\n\nStage 1 is being delivered by John Holland and CPB Contractors and includes construction of the 1.7km southern section of the tunnel connecting Emily Street in Rozelle to Cove Street in Birchgrove. Stage 1 works commenced in June 2022.\n\nKeep up to date with tunnelling progress on our Tunnelling Notifications Map.\n\nStage 2 is being delivered by ACCIONA and includes construction of the northern end of the tunnel, connections to the Warringah Freeway near North Sydney, tunnelling under Sydney Harbour and the complete tunnel fit-out. The contract for Stage 2 was awarded in late 2022 and early works commenced in May 2023. The project reached a major milestone in November 2023 with the start of roadheader tunnel excavation on the north side of the Harbour at Cammeray.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel will provide a new crossing of Sydney Harbour involving twin motorway tunnels connecting the M4-M5 Link at Rozelle and the Warringah Freeway at North Sydney.\n\nWith three lanes in each direction, it will take pressure off the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour Tunnel, Anzac Bridge and Western Distributor corridors enhancing transport capacity in and around Sydney.\n\nTogether with the Warringah Freeway Upgrade, there will be improved public transport connections, with quicker access to interchanges and a new, direct connection to North Sydney.\n\nThere will also be opportunities for new direct bus routes between the Inner West and North Sydney using the Western Harbour Tunnel.\n\nConstruction of the Western Harbour Tunnel will help drive the NSW economy by creating around 6,900 full time direct jobs.\n\nTransport and the contractor for Stage 2, ACCIONA are committed to creating opportunity for local businesses and suppliers on this major project. In collaboration with industry, the delivery of Western Harbour Tunnel will include the development and implementation of a business capability program to increase the capability and capacity of ANZ Small and Medium Enterprises and social enterprises.\n\nThe $4.24 billion contract to deliver Stage 2 of the Western Harbour Tunnel project was awarded to ACCIONA in December 2022 following a successful competitive tender process. The second and final stage of the project includes construction of the northern end of the tunnel, connections to the Warringah Freeway near North Sydney, tunnelling under Sydney Harbour and the complete tunnel fit-out.\n\nHow do you know this is the best outcome for the taxpayer?\n\nThe procurement process involved inviting tenderers to submit proposals to deliver Stage 2 of the Western Harbour Tunnel, and an extensive period of rigorous investigation and negotiation to determine the preferred tenderer. Click here to read more about the contract award and tender process.\n\nWhat is a procurement process?\n\nThe procurement process involved inviting tenderers to submit proposals to deliver Stage 2 of the Western Harbour Tunnel, and an extensive period of rigorous investigation and negotiation to determine the preferred tenderer.\n\nWhat are the mechanisms in place to ensure the project is carried out in line with the project’s planning approval?\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel will be delivered and operated in line with all relevant guidelines and the projects’ panning approvals. As is standard for a major project reporting and auditing mechanisms are in place within Transport for NSW, and externally with Department for Planning, Housing and Infrastructure (DPHI) and other overseeing authorities.\n\nWill there be an independent certifier for the project?\n\nTransport for NSW has engaged The APP Group as the Independent Certifier for the Western Harbour Tunnel project. The Independent Certifier will ensure that the project is delivered in accordance with the agreed design document and planning approvals. Transport looks forward to working with The APP Group to ensure that Western Harbour Tunnel is delivered successfully.\n\nConsistent with NSW Government policy, a summary of the Business Case for the Western Harbour Tunnel was released by Infrastructure NSW in May 2020 and is available for download on the Infrastructure NSW website. Further information is available at www.infrastructure.nsw.gov.au.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway Upgrade was approved by the Minister for Planning and Public Spaces in January 2021 following the exhibition of the project’s Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and release of the Submissions Report.\n\nStage 1 - Rozelle to Birchgrove\n\nEarly work for Stage 1 started in February 2022 with geotechnical investigations and ground water monitoring being carried out to help inform the detailed design for the tunnel alignment.\n\nConstruction of Stage 1, the southern section of the tunnel, began on 29 June 2022 in Emily Street in Rozelle, and is expected to be completed in 2025.\n\nStage 2 - Birchgrove to Cammeray\n\nEarly work for Stage 2 commenced in May 2023.\n\nThe project reached a major milestone with the start of roadheader tunnel excavation on the north side of the Harbour from November 2023 at Cammeray. Works will continue for approximately 5 years.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway Upgrade was approved by the Minister for Planning and Public Spaces in January 2021 following the exhibition of the project’s Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and release of the Submissions Report.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway Upgrade EIS was exhibited for 61 days from 29 January 2020 to 30 March 2020. We received 1,459 submissions. Of these submissions, 18 were received from NSW Government agencies and local councils, and 1,441 from other organisations and members of the public. Further information regarding project history, including the full EIS and Submissions Report can be found here.\n\nFrom 19 July to 15 August 2023, we invited the community to have their say on proposed changes to the way we build the Western Harbour Tunnel under Sydney Harbour, outlining a modification to the approved Western Harbour Tunnel project to change the construction methodology for crossing under Sydney Harbour between Birchgrove and Waverton from the approved Immersed Tube Tunnel (IMT) method to Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs). During this submission period we held four information sessions and an online information session to support the community in understanding our proposed changes and to encourage submissions to be provided to the Department for Planning, Housing and Infrastructure (DPHI) for consideration.\n\nIn December 2022, Transport awarded the second and final stage of the Western Harbour Tunnel project to ACCIONA, who will be using Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM) to construct the section of tunnels under Sydney Harbour. This brings significant benefits for the local community.\n\nThe use of this methodology means that the temporary construction site at Berrys Bay is no longer required for the project, however the NSW Government is committed to returning the space to the community by allowing the delivery of a new foreshore park much earlier than planned for the benefit of the local community.\n\nTransport for NSW has prepared the final landscape master plan to transform the former industrial land of Berrys Bay into beautiful foreshore parklands and open space.\n\nThe Berrys Bay master plan has been shaped by the community and provides a vision to transform the former industrial land of Berrys Bay into usable public open space. It will complete the missing link in foreshore access on the Peninsula and reconnect the community and visitors to the Bay’s histories, foreshore lands, and waters.\n\nClick here to view the final master plan, including a summary of changes from the draft master plan.\n\nStage 1 of the Western Harbour Tunnel is being excavated in two phases, primarily with a roadheader, an excavation machine that cuts rock in a circular motion suitable for creating the arched shape cavern required for road tunnels.\n\nSix roadheaders in total will be used to excavate Stage 1.\n\nThe first phase involves excavation of the tunnel roof using a roadheader. The crew excavate between 1-5 metres at a time (depending on the design), before installing ground support into the tunnel walls, including rock bolts (metal rods) and shotcrete (sprayed concrete). We generally excavate around 20-25 metres of rock per week.\n\nThe second phase of tunnel excavation involves removal of the tunnel floor using a roadheader or rock hammer.\n\nWhen using a roadheader, this work progresses much quicker than the first phase, at approximately 15-25 metres per day. On some occasions, we will need to use a rock hammer to excavate the floor. This work will be restricted based on vibration levels in compliance with project approvals.\n\nTunnel support activities include drilling, adding extra rock bolts, profiling, installing drainage and laying a new road pavement.\n\nThe project has approval to carry out tunnelling activities (including support activities) 24 hours per day, seven days a week. The first stage of tunnel excavation involves cutting of the roof using a roadheader. The crew cut forward between 1 and 5 metres at a time (depending on the design) before installing ground support which includes rock bolts (metal rods) and shotcrete (sprayed concrete). We generally progress this work at approximately 20-25 metres per week. The second stage involves the removal of the tunnel floor using a roadheader or rock hammer. When using a roadheader, the removal of the tunnel floor progresses at a much quicker rate of approximately 15-25 metres per day.\n\nA letter will be dropped to all properties within a 50m radius of the tunnel alignment when we are approaching your area, about 2 - 6 weeks prior to when we expect to start tunnelling.\n\nThe project also sends an email to all subscribed residents every Friday with the latest tunnelling progress. This is the best way to keep track of the excavation under or near your property.\n\nYou can subscribe to these updates on the Contact Us page.\n\nThe tunnels will be dug by a machine called a roadheader. A roadheader is an electrically powered excavation machine that has a rotating, rock-cutting head on the front, mounted to a boom. Roadheaders have been chosen because they are best suited to digging road tunnels as their arm can create the arched roof shape and a flat base, suitable for road construction to support the completed excavation, a rockbolting machine is used to install rockbolts into the tunnel roof. When the underground rock is cut using a roadheader, a loading device typically transfers the rock onto a conveyor belt which runs the spoil onto haulage trucks.\n\nRockbolts range in length depending on the ground conditions and excavation size. Rockbolts are drilled, tensioned and injected with grout to increase the strength of the tunnel roof Shotcrete is then applied to keep the tunnel roof and sides in place. The amount of shotcrete applied depends on the ground conditions and the excavation size Moxie’s are specialized dump trucks used to transport spoil inside the tunnels to the acoustic shed. The spoil is then loaded onto large trucks with trailers and taken off site to approved spoil tip sites. Receiver sites for spoil for the Western Harbour Tunnel Stage 1 are located mainly out west and include future developments.\n\nWhat is the benefit of using road headers?\n\nThe roadheader tunnelling method has been the preferred construction technique for almost all major motorway tunnels in Sydney. This method will be used to tunnel the majority of the Western Harbour Tunnel, except for the section beneath the Sydney Harbour seabed, as planned.\n\nUsing roadheaders to tunnel north and south of the Harbour is the preferred method largely because of the suitable ground conditions and flexibility these machines provide in excavating different tunnel shapes.\n\nThe size of the tunnel will determine the length of time and number of times the roadheader will need to pass under a property. People may notice when the first phase of tunnelling excavation occurs, which is the excavation of the roof. This can take between 2-4 weeks.\n\nThe second phase may be noticeable for one week. If we’re excavating a wider section of tunnel, we could be in the area for up to three months.\n\nThe project has approval to carry out tunnelling activities 24 hours per day, seven days a week. This schedule is provided for two reasons, it:\n\n· significantly reduce the overall timeframe taken to excavate the tunnels and reduce the impact to residents\n\n· allows ground support to be immediately applied following excavation (safety requirement).\n\nTunnelling for Stage 1 will mostly take place between 6am Monday and 6pm Saturday (24 hours a day), giving residents a 2-night respite on weekends. As needed, tunnelling activities may take place inside the tunnels from 6pm Saturday to 6am Monday but we will notify before this occurs.\n\nTypically for complex major infrastructure projects, the design and construction approach presented in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is at planning stage and is indicative only. The design presented in the EIS is subject to refinement once the Contractor delivering the project has been appointed and is able to carry out further investigations, engineering analysis and construction planning.\n\nIn February 2022, we carried out geotechnical and groundwater monitoring in the Rozelle, Balmain and Birchgrove area. Information gathered during this stage was used to help finalise the detailed design of the tunnel alignment and location of supporting structures for the project.\n\nThe final tunnel alignment shifted from what was presented in the EIS, following this detailed design process, in some locations, by up to 70 metres. This was to take advantage of better ground conditions for tunnelling and to provide a straighter route, making it easier and safer to drive. While the location and depth of some of these tunnels has changed, the overarching impacts assessed under the EIS, are expected to be the same. The location of the final detailed design compared to the EIS reference design is captured in this map.\n\nOur standard construction hours are from 7am to 6pm Monday to Friday, and 8am to 6pm Saturday. High noise activities will be completed before 1pm on Saturdays.\n\nSome activities may need to be undertaken outside of standard construction hours, including oversized equipment and material deliveries. Additional out of hours work may be required to work OFFICIAL across intersections, but the preference is always to do this during the day where possible. We will notify you before any out of hours work.\n\nThe traffic changes will depend on where we are working on the alignment and differ street by street.\n\nFor some streets we will be able to maintain one-way through traffic, however in narrower streets we will need to temporarily close them.\n\nWe will have detours and traffic control in place for each traffic change to manage vehicles and bike riders. This will occur progressively along sections of road while work is being carried out. The duration of traffic changes will be confirmed once the work program has been finalised.\n\nPlease keep to the signposted speed limits and follow the direction of traffic controllers and road signs. We will notify you of any traffic changes ahead of time and you can check Live Traffic for updates.\n\nWe will speak to residents in the streets where work is planned well ahead of any work starting. Notifications will also be distributed to people in the surrounding area before work starts.\n\nWe encourage members of the community to contact us with any questions or concerns about our work. We are also asking residents to complete our parking and access survey so individual needs are considered as part of the planning.\n\nTo register for these updates, please visit our website nswroads.work/whtportal.\n\nA Place Design and Landscape Plan (PDLP) is an important stage of a project illustrating, in more detail than the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), what a project will look like, how it contributes to places, what the buildings, bridges, and tunnels look like, what the landscape is like, where the paths and cycleways are, and how it all comes together with the road infrastructure. It is the opportunity for the community to have a final look at the design before it is built.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel (WHT) Place, Design and Landscape Plan (PDLP) outlines the design and landscape objectives of Western Harbour Tunnel and sets the framework to deliver great places for the community.\n\nThe WHT PDLP continues the design story that started on the Warringah Freeway Upgrade project PDLP, published last year, and approved in July 2024. Once built, WHT will provide a seamless connection from the Warringah Freeway at North Sydney to WestConnex (Rozelle Interchange), helping drivers bypass the CBD and making it easier, faster, and safer to get around Sydney.\n\nThe WHT PDLP presents a quality design of motorway infrastructure in Sydney, offering a unique, positive, and meaningful harbour crossing experience for future road users by weaving in the natural and cultural essence of the land into the final design.\n\nThe WHT PDLP will be presented in three parts, with each part including its own consultation period and key objectives.\n\nTWHT PDLP (part 1)\n\nThe draft WHT PDLP is open for feedback now and consists of critical surface and in-tunnel infrastructure required to deliver the project.\n\nThe key areas for feedback are:\n\n· ventilation facilities\n\n· tunnel portals (entry and exits)\n\n· landscape design\n\n· tunnel interiors.\n\nWHT Berrys Bay (part 2)\n\nDue to the change in construction methodology for tunnelling under the harbour, the project no longer requires the use of Berrys Bay as a construction support site which means we can deliver a new foreshore parkland for the community ahead of the tunnel being completed.\n\nTransport is committed to reconnecting people to the bay’s history, foreshore lands, and waters through the delivery of this new foreshore parkland.\n\nTransport has been progressing the design for the parklands at Berrys Bay and will be seeking further community feedback. The next steps include finalising the detailed design and developing the next part of the PDLP for stakeholder and community engagement from late 2024.\n\nConstruction is expected to start at Berrys Bay in early 2025.\n\nWHT Cammeray Park (part 3)\n\nIn 2025, Transport will be engaging with key stakeholders and the community on a new public park between the freeway and Cammeray Golf Course. This land is required for the construction of Warringah Freeway Upgrade (WFU) and WHT and we are excited to give this land back to the community.\n\nLand needed for construction of Beaches Link is no longer required and will be returned to the community earlier as part of the open space to be delivered in Cammeray.\n\nThe draft PDLP for WHT is on public display for the local community to comment on a range of elements including Cammeray facilities, visual amenity, tunnel interiors, tunnel portals, landscaping, and Connecting with Country features.\n\nSome of the design aspects of the project were consulted on and approved as part of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) engagement. We welcome your feedback on aspects related to:\n\n· landscape design and flora species selection, materials and finishes of the buildings and portals\n\n· tunnel lining design.\n\nSome examples of aspects of the project we are not seeking feedback on include the location and structural design of:\n\n· ventilation facilities\n\n· noise walls, portals, and other structures.\n\nWe understand the character and visual amenity of your local area is important, which is why community feedback has underpinned the design journey from the very start.\n\nIn early 2020 the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) went on public display. High level urban design concepts were proposed for feedback and over 1454 submissions were received.\n\nIn January 2021, the Minister’s Condition of Approval was granted, and the project was approved to proceed.\n\nThe Warringah Freeway Upgrade project sought community feedback on its draft Place, Design and Landscape Plan in June-July 2023. This plan included visual amenity elements, such as urban and landscape design, freeway bridges, noise and retaining walls, and three active transport bridges across the freeway which emphasise Connection to Country.\n\nThe Warringah Freeway Upgrade PDLP was approved by the Department of Planning, Housing, and Infrastructure in July 2024.\n\nThe WHT PDLP has been developed using an integrated urban design approach, involving close collaboration with a broad, multidisciplinary project team. This included subject matter experts, key external stakeholders, North Sydney Council, and the State Design Review Panel (SDRP).\n\nIn March 2023, the SDRP was engaged, in accordance with the Minister’s Conditions of Approval for the project, to advise on the development of the PDLP. The SDRP comprises qualified, experienced, and independent professionals in fields including:\n\n· Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal cultural heritage\n\n· architecture\n\n· landscape design\n\n· urban design.\n\nThe SDRP was consulted on placemaking, artistic elements, architecture, heritage, urban and landscaping aspects of the design, and were engaged for both Warringah Freeway Upgrade and Western Harbour Tunnel projects’ PDLPs.\n\nAs the project progressed, the elements were further refined based on detailed engineering assessments and construction optimisations. Further design modifications may also be necessary as an outcome of the community and stakeholder consultation via the PDLP process.\n\nUnder the advice of Cultural Capital, cultural facilitator Kyra Kum-Sing was engaged and endorsed by key stakeholder, the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council. Kyra identified a group of three Indigenous representatives. These Knowledge Holders consulted closely with the appointed artist who produced artwork for the tunnel. The artist and Knowledge Holders were part of a consultative co-design process with project architects.\n\nA Design with Country objective has been incorporated into the project to ensure it responds to and supports the health and wellbeing of Country. This is reflected by tapping into the traditional reading of landscape features through the song-lines. These tell us of the creation time of the land through materials that mimic sandstone found on site - exposing the natural colours of Country and textures that draw on the natural environment and its history.\n\nThe Warringah Freeway Upgrade (WFU) project is responsible for building the structure and safety screens required for the Ernest Street bridge, however, the WHT PDLP will determine the landscaping. The landscape design on the bridge incorporates the finishes and structure of the WFU project to ensure consistency.\n\nAs part of the WFU project, Transport is also assessing the design of the western connection of the widened Ernest Street bridge to improve access for pedestrians and cyclists. Should an amended design proceed, the urban design and vegetation planting in the area will be carried out in accordance with the themes in the approved WFU PDLP.\n\nYes, The PDLP supports Transport’s Tree Replacement Strategy.\n\nTransport has developed a Tree Replacement Strategy in consultation with North Sydney Council, which outlines the principles for tree replacement including but not limited to potential planting locations and timing.\n\nWHT PDLP is the next step in that process and details the landscape design plans for the project in association with the infrastructure, but not the work proposed in Berrys Bay or around Cammeray, which will form the next part of the WHT PDLP. This includes the location of existing vegetation, areas of vegetation to be retained and proposed planting and seeding details.\n\nOur approach to replacing trees in North Sydney is in line with the planning conditions where replacement trees must be located on public land and prioritised within 500 metres of both the WHT and WFU project boundary. As outlined in the Tree Replacement Strategy, there are limitations on the number of replacement trees that can be planted within 500 metres of the project boundary.\n\nAs a result of this limitation, North Sydney Council and Transport discussed the potential to identify alternative locations in the North Sydney LGA where replacement trees could be planted, outside the 500 metre requirement. Should locations outside the 500 metre requirement be identified and agreed with Council, Transport would seek approval from the Planning Secretary. Transport continues to work in partnership with Council to identify possible tree planting locations that align with our tree replacement principles.\n\nYou can find out more about the tree replacement strategy here.\n\nConstruction of one WHT ventilation outlet was included in the scope for the Rozelle Interchange project. This ventilation outlet is one of three cylinder structures located at the Rozelle Parklands, with the remaining two ventilation outlets now in operation to service the WestConnex M4 and M8 tunnels at the Rozelle Interchange.\n\nUrban design and landscape elements relevant to the southern part of the WHT project were consulted on during public display of the Rozelle Interchange's Urban Design and Landscape Plan (UDLP) in August 2020.\n\nThe second ventilation outlet for WHT will be located within the Warringah Freeway corridor, to the north of Ernest Street in Cammeray and is yet to be built.\n\nTunnel ventilation systems generally work most efficiently and effectively when the ventilation outlet is positioned near the exit ramp. This is why the ventilation outlets for modern tunnels are located near the tunnel exit ramps.\n\nThe location, size and height of the ventilation tunnels were determined as part of the air quality assessment carried out for the project’s EIS. We build the ventilation outlets in accordance with the air quality assessment and therefore the location, size and height of the outlet is not subject to the PDLP consultation. However, the way the ventilation outlet looks is subject to the PDLP and community feedback is welcome.\n\nIn NSW we have an Advisory Committee on Tunnel Air Quality, chaired by the NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer, which consists of a range of experts in fields related to road tunnels, air quality and human health. This includes the NSW Chief Health Officer and an independent, international air quality expert.\n\nThe Committee has released a report in relation to road tunnel air quality which found emissions from well-designed road tunnels cause a negligible change to surrounding air quality, and as such, there is no discernible health benefit for surrounding communities in installing filtration and air treatment systems in the tunnels.\n\nTo find out more about Air Quality Control, visit our website here. [link here to website NSW Tunnel Air Quality | Air Quality | Transport for NSW (caportal.com.au).\n\nDuring the tender process for Stage 2 of the project, different designs and methodology were considered to ensure the best design and outcomes are considered for the project, community and environment. Acciona submitted an alternative methodology of using a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) to tunnel beneath the Sydney Harbour seabed. This design was assessed and selected as it provides the best overall value for the people of NSW and minimises impacts on the local community and environment.\n\nThe specialised TBMs will each tunnel for about 1.5km from Birchgrove to Waverton including under the Sydney Harbour seabed, connecting the northern and southern ends of the project. Using TBM methodology means we no longer require temporary construction sites at Yurulbin Point or Berrys Bay, and cofferdams are no longer required at Yurulbin Point or Balls Head. This also means that no dredging will be required and there will be no impacts to Birchgrove Wharf.\n\nTransport has determined the TBM methodology to be the best overall solution to deliver Stage 2 tunnelling beneath Sydney Harbour.\n\nA design using a TBM was originally considered as part of the EIS. At the time, an Immersed Tube Tunnel approach was assessed as being the most suitable option due to the nature of the project as well as the local ground conditions beneath Sydney’s Harbour.\n\nSince the development of the concept design in 2017 and the proposed reference design in 2018 for the project, technology and the market have evolved. Other projects have recently proven the efficiency and success of using a TBM to tunnel beneath Sydney’s Harbour.\n\nAs this methodology was not fully assessed and approved during the EIS, the project sought approval to use the TBM methodology through a modification, which the community was consulted on in 2023. This is a standard process when making changes to an approved major project.\n\nThe Department for Planning, Housing and Infrastructure (DPHI) approved the Modification to the Western Harbour Tunnel project in January 2024.\n\nTBMs are used worldwide and in NSW as a tunnelling solution. Using a TBM significantly reduces our surface impacts. By launching the TBM completely underground, it removes the need for construction sites and cofferdams at Birchgrove and Waverton. It also removes the need for dredging in Sydney Harbour.\n\nTBM will be used for a 1.5km section of the tunnel beneath Sydney Harbour and will lead to improved environmental and community outcomes including:\n\n• reduced number of temporary construction sites (Berrys Bay, Yurulbin Point, Sydney Harbour sites no longer required)\n\n• with no tunnelling works from Berrys Bay, the Berrys Bay master plan will be delivered earlier\n\n• no dredging of Sydney Harbour\n\n• no removal of Sydney Harbour sediment near Balls Head\n\n• no impact to existing harbour operations (HMAS Waterhen, VIVA Energy, ferries, recreational watercraft)\n\n• Birchgrove Ferry Wharf no longer impacted\n\n• no cofferdams at Yurulbin Point or Balls Head\n\n• no temporary relocation of MV Cape Don\n\n• temporary relocation of moorings at Berrys Bay no longer required\n\n• upgrade and utilisation of moorings at Snails Bay no longer required\n\nConsistent with complex major infrastructure projects progressing through an environmental planning and assessment process, the design and construction approach presented in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was at planning stage and indicative only. Further refinement as part of detailed design is now underway and we are working to develop the design and construction methodologies. This includes tunnel alignment, depth and supporting infrastructure.\n\nAs the TBM methodology was not fully assessed and approved during the EIS, the project sought further approval from the NSW Minister for Planning through a modification. We consulted communities across the lower north shore, inner west and Emu Plains about the Modification in July and August 2023, and we will continue to engage with these communities as we work to deliver the Western Harbour Tunnel.\n\nThe Department for Planning, Housing and Infrastructure (DPHI) approved the Modification to the Western Harbour Tunnel project in January 2024.\n\nAbout the Modification\n\nThe Modification Report was submitted in July 2023, proposing to amend the Western Harbour Tunnel project granted planning approval in January 2021.\n\nThe approved Modification means that we are changing the construction methodology for tunnelling under the Sydney Harbour between Birchgrove and Waverton from an Immersed Tube Tunnel to using Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs). This change will reduce construction impacts on the community and environment by:\n\nnot dredging in Sydney Harbour\n\nreducing the overall number of construction support sites by removing the need for construction support sites at Yurulbin Point, Berrys Bay, White Bay North and Victoria Road\n\nremoving the need for cofferdams in Sydney Harbour at Birchgrove and Balls Head\n\nremoving impacts to Birchgrove Ferry Wharf and ferry services\n\nreducing impacts to ferries and boats on Sydney Harbour.\n\nApproval of the Modification also means there will be a new construction support site at Emu Plains and changes to our existing support sites at the City West Link Portal, Glebe Island and Ridge Street, North Sydney.\n\nAll other construction activities and elements of the approved project not included in the Modification Report will continue to proceed as planned.\n\nAs with any major infrastructure project of this scale, the approved changes are subject to the Minister’s Conditions of Approval. You can learn more about these conditions and view the full Modification Report here on the Department of Planning and Environment’s Major Projects portal.\n\nClick here to view the project’s original Environmental Impact Statement and Minister’s Conditions of Approval.\n\nOur specialised TBM machines will tunnel for about 1.5km under from Birchgrove to Waverton including under the Sydney Harbour seabed, connecting the northern and southern ends of the project. The TBM methodology has been adopted as an alternative to using the originally planned Immersed Tube Tunnel construction method. With the expected geology under Sydney Harbour, the TBM method is efficient and has a reduced impact on the environment and community.\n\nThe majority of the Western Harbour Tunnel will be excavated using electrically powered machines known as roadheaders, as planned. Roadheaders were found to be less suited to tunnelling beneath the harbour, as opposed to under land.\n\nTBM machines can only move in one direction. Once we have completed tunnelling the TBM section of the project, the TBMs will be driven into a ‘receiving chamber’. We will salvage as much of the machine as possible, removing it in pieces back through the entrance to the tunnel at Rozelle.\n\nThe cutterhead and shield of the TBMs cannot be safely salvaged and will be buried underground and encapsulated in the receiving chamber. This is a normal process when tunnelling using the TBM methodology, and all safety and environmental measures will be carried out to ensure it is safely buried. Burying the cutterhead and shield of the TBMs mean we do not need to create an above-ground construction site to remove them, which would have significant impacts on the local community.\n\nConsistent with complex major infrastructure projects progressing through an environmental planning and assessment process, the design and construction approach presented in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was at planning stage and indicative only.\n\nFurther refinement as part of detailed design is now underway and we are working to develop the design and construction methodologies. The detailed design phase will take approximately 12 to 18 months to complete and will be progressively incorporated into the planning and delivery of construction work.\n\nAs the TBM methodology was not fully assessed and approved during the EIS, we sought further approval from the NSW Minister for Planning to modify the Conditions of Approval (CoA), in accordance with the requirements of Division 5.2 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979.\n\nFrom 19 July to 15 August 2023, we invited the community to have their say on proposed changes to the way we build the Western Harbour Tunnel under Sydney Harbour.\n\nWe displayed the Modification Report which outlined a modification to the approved Western Harbour Tunnel project to change the construction methodology for crossing under Sydney Harbour between Birchgrove and Waverton from the approved Immersed Tube Tunnel (IMT) method to Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs).\n\nThe Department for Planning, Housing and Infrastructure (DPHI) approved the Modification to the Western Harbour Tunnel project in January 2024.\n\nAbout the Modification\n\nThe Modification Report was submitted in July 2023, proposing to amend the Western Harbour Tunnel project granted planning approval in January 2021.\n\nThe approved Modification means that we are changing the construction methodology for tunnelling under the Sydney Harbour between Birchgrove and Waverton from an Immersed Tube Tunnel to using Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs). This change will reduce construction impacts on the community and environment by:\n\nnot dredging in Sydney Harbour\n\nreducing the overall number of construction support sites by removing the need for construction support sites at Yurulbin Point, Berrys Bay, White Bay North and Victoria Road\n\nremoving the need for cofferdams in Sydney Harbour at Birchgrove and Balls Head\n\nremoving impacts to Birchgrove Ferry Wharf and ferry services\n\nreducing impacts to ferries and boats on Sydney Harbour.\n\nApproval of the Modification also means there will be a new construction support site at Emu Plains and changes to our existing support sites at the City West Link Portal, Glebe Island and Ridge Street, North Sydney.\n\nAll other construction activities and elements of the approved project not included in the Modification Report will continue to proceed as planned.\n\nAs with any major infrastructure project of this scale, the approved changes are subject to the Minister’s Conditions of Approval. You can learn more about these conditions and view the full Modification Report here on the Department for Planning, Housing and Infrastructure (DPHI)’s Major Projects portal.\n\nClick here to view the project’s original Environmental Impact Statement and Minister’s Conditions of Approval.\n\nThere will be future opportunities to provide input to the Western Harbour Tunnel project. We will work with councils, communities and stakeholders to ensure the best possible use of this space once we have finished our work and will be seeking your valuable input to help design these legacy projects.\n\nThere will be a Place, Design and Landscape Plan (PDLP) carried out as part of main work activities. As per E178 in the Conditions of Approval (CoA), the PDLP must be prepared by a suitably qualified and experienced team, in consultation with relevant councils, the community and affected landowners and businesses.\n\nOur objective is to ensure there are no buildings at risk of damage from vibration and settlement impacts while we are carrying out our work.\n\nThe new TBM method does not pose additional risk to properties from vibration.\n\nAs is the standard process for tunnelling, we will offer eligible properties in close proximity to the tunnel alignment and any settlement or vibration-intensive works a free property condition survey. While we are building, we will monitor noise and vibration to make sure it meets the appropriate guidelines.\n\nEarly work for Stage 2 commenced on 22 May 2023 and includes further geotechnical investigations, archaeological investigations and more. For more information, view the notifications for work both north and south of the Harbour here.\n\nThe project reached a major milestone with the start of roadheader tunnel excavation on the north side of the Harbour from late November 2023 at Cammeray. Read our Start of Tunnelling notification for more information. To learn more about our construction activities and how we manage any potential impacts from our tunnelling activities, please refer to our Stage 2 fact sheets.\n\nWe will contact residents before any work starts in their area. Community information sessions will be scheduled before tunnelling starts in each suburb along the alignment.\n\nWe understand there is concern about the potential for vibration and settlement impacts from tunnelling works. Ground movement does not necessarily result in property damage, in fact it is highly unlikely. Buildings experience ground movement naturally through environmental changes such as seasonal climate variations, vegetation (tree roots), structural effects (different building types of age of construction) or ground effects (reactivity to soil).\n\nProperties above the final tunnel alignment (and within 50 metres of the alignment, in line with planning approvals) will be offered a Property Condition Survey. Even though it is highly unlikely for any damage to occur from our tunnelling, Transport encourages anyone who is eligible for a Property Condition Survey to take up this offer following confirmation of the final alignment.\n\nIf your property is located within 50 metres of the tunnels you will be offered a property condition survey (PCS) before and after construction. The survey is free and will ensure there is a clear record of your property’s condition. In the unlikely event damage is caused by our construction work, it will be repaired at no cost to you.\n\nConstruction of these tunnels will continue to follow well-established methods used on other major tunnelling projects in the Sydney region. They will be built safely, and in line with the project’s planning approvals.\n\nFor Stage 1 all properties within 50 metres of the tunnel are eligible for a PCS both before and after construction of the tunnels. The project strongly recommends property owners accept the offer to have one completed. The PCS is free to residents, and will provide a photographic baseline for comparison if you have concerns about property damage that you believe was caused by construction activity. In the unlikely event that any damage is caused by our construction work, rest assured it will be repaired at no cost to you.\n\nYou may have already undergone a PCS or received several offers from other projects in the area, we strongly urge you to accept this offer for each individual project. Accepting these offers ensures that your property is documented in the construction phase for each project.\n\nStage 2 is currently undergoing detailed design, once this is finalised, and the final alignment of the tunnel known, eligible residents will be contacted with offers for a PCS.\n\nProperty Condition Surveys involve a visual inspection of the interior and exterior of a property to document its condition before construction work takes place nearby, in accordance with the Australian Standard 4349.1 Inspection of Buildings.\n\nProperty Condition Surveys are completed at no cost to you, and at a date and time that is convenient to you. The property owner (or nominee) will need to be present to grant access to the property.\n\nInspections typically take around two to three hours to assess and photograph the internal and external condition of the building/s, depending on the size and features of your property. The outcomes of the inspection will be detailed in a property condition report, and you will be supplied with a copy. Transport and ACCIONA will also keep a copy.\n\nThe report will also include photographs to provide an accurate record of the current condition of the property and will record any noticeable defects. Inspections are scheduled to take place during daylight hours to accurately record the condition of the property’s exterior.\n\nProperty Condition Surveys (PCS) will be offered to properties close to the construction area for the Western Harbour Tunnel as a precautionary measure and offer peace of mind to property owners during construction.\n\nIf your property is located within 50 metres of the outer edge of the tunnels you will be offered a PCS before construction starts near your property. The survey is free of charge and will ensure there is a clear record of your property’s condition.\n\nWe will make three attempts via letter to offer a PCS. If you’ve subscribed to our email distribution list the project will attempt to also contact you via email.\n\nWe recognise there are multiple projects working in the Inner West and North Sydney areas and you may have organized a property condition survey for another project previously. We strongly encourage you to accept a Property Condition Survey offer for each individual project you are offered. Accepting these offers ensures that your property is documented in the construction phase for each project.\n\nWestern Harbour Tunnel Stage is a separate project from others in the area and is being carried out by a different construction contractor.\n\nIt is important that a new property condition survey is completed just prior to Western Harbour Tunnel construction commencing in your area so that in the unlikely event of any damage to your property we can determine the timeframe this occurred.\n\nYou should contact the project team as soon as possible to begin the process of filing a property damage claim. You do not have to wait until the post-construction Property Condition Survey (PCS) is complete to file a claim for property damage.\n\nThe property damage team will then contact you and walk you through the property damage process.\n\nIf you’re not satisfied with the project's decision on your damage claim, you can request your claim be reviewed by an Independent Property Impact Assessment Panel (IPIAP) through Transport for NSW. The panel is made up of independent geotechnical and engineering specialists who have been approved by the Department of Planning and Environment (DPE).\n\nSettlement is the movement of the ground, generally caused by changes in stresses within the earth. Excavation of tunnels will almost always cause some settlement. Tunnel-induced settlement is the result of the ground relaxing around newly excavated area and occurs at the time of excavation and the weeks proceeding. Groundwater drawdown is when groundwater flows into the tunnel causing ground at the surface to lose volume. This form of settlement typically occurs very slowly over the lifetime of the project. Ground movement does not necessarily result in property damage. Buildings generally experience ground movement naturally through environmental changes such as seasonal climate variations, vegetation (tree roots), structural effects (different building types of age of construction) or ground effects (reactivity to soil).\n\nDuring excavation, the team uses a conservative trigger (green, amber, red) system to address changing ground movement levels. Geotechnical engineers map the tunnel rockface at every excavation advance to measure any settlement and this information is incorporated into a daily planning meeting with construction teams.\n\nMonitoring occurs on the surface and inside the tunnel throughout excavation, as shown in the image below. Residents may notice prism markers being installed on roads and footpaths by our survey team ahead of tunnelling in an area.\n\nThese prisms are used to monitor potential ground movement throughout excavation. We will monitor these prisms on a daily basis at the location of our tunnelling activities.\n\nGenerally, noise and vibration impact from tunnelling is most noticeable when we are closest to a property, increasing on approach and reducing as we move away. The deeper the tunnel the less likely you are to hear excavation (generally from below 30 metres is low noise impact), so 60-70 metres will be barely audible. The sounds you may hear during tunnelling include:\n\n· First phase:roadheader excavation sounds like an old refrigerator humming which will occur 24/7 and rock bolting which creates a temporary drilling noise. As this drilling noise stops and starts, it can be more noticeable to residents.\n\n· Second phase: daytime rock hammering will create a repetitive tapping sound varying in impact depending on your property's location to the work. Tunnel support activities: including rock bolting and drilling create a temporary drilling noise. As this drilling noise stops and starts, it can be more noticeable to residents.\n\nWhile we are building, we will monitor noise and vibration to make sure it meets the appropriate guidelines. Throughout construction we regularly monitor noise at different times of the day and night to ensure noise is within our predicted noise levels. This monitoring lets us know if we need to change our construction methods, adjust our mitigation measures, or adjust the noise model.\n\nAll our work will be carried out in line with the project’ Conditions of Approval, Environment Protection Licence and Construction Environmental Management Plan which are overseen by the Department of Planning and Environment (DPE) and NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA).\n\nThe ventilation outlet for the Western Harbour Tunnel will not be filtered.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel ventilation system will be built to meet strict air quality standards using state-of-the-art ventilation and tunnel design.\n\nIn NSW we have an Advisory Committee on Tunnel Air Quality, chaired by the NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer, which consists of a range of experts in fields related to road tunnels, air quality and human health. This includes the NSW Chief Health Officer and an independent, international air quality expert.\n\nThe Committee has released a report in relation to road tunnel air quality which found emissions from well-designed road tunnels cause a negligible change to surrounding air quality, and as such, there is no discernible health benefit for surrounding communities in installing filtration and air treatment systems in such tunnels.\n\nFiltration does not remove all pollutants from tunnel exhaust, therefore Transport for NSW will still need to operate a ventilation system, complete with inlets and outlets to protect the local air quality and tunnel users. The ventilation systems we use in NSW in our road tunnels are built to meet strict air quality standards and use state-of-the-art ventilation and tunnel design.\n\nSydney’s motorway tunnel ventilation outlets, including those for Western Harbour Tunnel, are designed to propel tunnel air high into the atmosphere. Once in the atmosphere, the ejected tunnel air is diluted hundreds of times, resulting in little, if any, change to the quality of the air people breathe.\n\nYou can learn more about ventilation systems, filtration and air treatment systems by visiting chiefscientist.nsw.gov.au or nswroads.work/airquality.\n\nOur commitment is that the tunnels will be built to meet strict air quality standards using state-of-the-art ventilation and tunnel design.\n\nOur assessments have shown emissions from the ventilation outlets for the project will have a negligible contribution to surrounding air quality and will be generally undetectable. The ventilation outlets will be continuously monitored, and the EPA will regulate the ventilation outlets to ensure they meet air quality limits.\n\nYou may be interested to know that you will experience an improvement in air quality along the Western Distributor, Sydney Harbour Bridge and Warringah Freeway as the result of more vehicles using the Western Harbour Tunnel, reducing traffic on surface roads.\n\nIndependent reviews of 2 years of post-operational air quality monitoring data have been conducted for NorthConnex, WestConnex M8 and the M4 tunnels. These reviews found that emissions from the NorthConnex, WestConnex M8 and the M4 ventilation outlets have no detectable impact on local air quality.\n\nThe reviews for NorthConnex and the M4 tunnels found significant improvements in local air quality due to projects removing traffic from surface roads. Communities along these corridors stand to benefit from the removal of thousands of vehicles from local surface roads.\n\nAir quality assessments were undertaken as part of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Western Harbour Tunnel is available on our interactive portal.\n\nThe EIS has been prepared by a team of qualified professionals, including technical specialists, and was reviewed by subject matter experts from Transport for NSW to provide a balanced, merit-based EIS in accordance with the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979, the Secretary’s environmental assessment requirements and applicable NSW assessment policies.\n\nAs part of the preparation of the air quality impact assessment for the project, Appendix H (Technical working paper: Air quality) was issued to the Office of the Chief Scientist and Engineer and the Advisory Committee on Tunnel Air Quality (ACTAQ) to carry out a scientific review of the environmental impact assessments relating to ventilation outlets. To maintain independence and robustness of the review process, two independent reviewers were engaged by the Office of the NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel and associated ventilation systems would be built and operated in compliance with conditions of approval set by the Department for Planning, Housing and Infrastructure (DPHI). Further, the monitoring of ventilation outlet emissions during operation would be regulated under an Environment Protection Licence issued under the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (NSW).\n\nAir quality would be continuously monitored within the ventilation outlets and tunnel 24 hours a day during operation and real-time data would be used to ensure compliance with strict air quality criteria. Air quality data would be made publicly available as close to real time as possible on a dedicated webpage.\n\nAmbient air quality monitoring would be carried out for 12 months before, and a set period of time, likely at least 24 months, after the tunnel opened to verify everything was performing as expected and confirm compliance with air quality goals.\n\nWe have a number of resources available on our Western Harbour Tunnel portal, including the Air quality fact sheet, Interactive map, Guide to the EIS, and Chapter 12 of the Environmental Impact Statement: Air quality. The Department of Planning and Environment has also published the Independent Peer Review – Air quality on the Western Harbour Tunnel planning portal.\n\nIn addition to the above resources, you may be interested to know that Transport for NSW has a dedicated Air quality portal for all your questions on being located near ventilation outlets, how the ventilation outlets work, road tunnels, vehicle emissions and more. On this portal you can find a video series from the experts addressing air quality concerns, FAQs, and additional resources. Visit the dedicated Air quality portal at nswroads.work/airquality\n\nWe will contact relevant property owners well before construction in their area starts to provide key information about subsurface acquisition. This will include a link to our online tunnel tool so you can see where the tunnels pass in relation to your property, how deep and how far away they are, and how to contact the team if you have any questions.\n\nFollowing our initial letter, an official Property Acquisition Notice (PAN) is sent out.\n\nThe subsurface acquisition process will move progressively along the tunnel alignment in groups. Transport for NSW will contact you if the project needs to acquire any land under your property as this information becomes available.\n\nAll properties impacted by subsurface acquisition for Stage 1 have been contacted.\n\nThe health and safety of our workers, the community and the environment is our priority. A comprehensive health impact assessment was carried out as part of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Western Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway Upgrade project. This assessment can be found in Appendix I – Health assessment. A health impact assessment is a way of determining what the consequences to health (both positive and negative) of the project may be.\n\nThe human health assessment for the project has focused on health-related impacts associated with key air quality, noise and vibration and social aspects. The report includes a detailed review of what impacts may occur, who may be exposed to these impacts and mitigation measures. An overview of the findings can be found in EIS Chapter 13 – Human Health.\n\nWe acknowledge some areas experience an overlap with impacts from more than one project or experience projects that are in construction consecutively over extended periods of time. Cumulative impacts have been assessed in EIS Chapter 27 – Cumulative Impacts.\n\nConstruction fatigue is recognised as an important issue for communities in the vicinity of large construction projects that overlap in time or space. We will work with other projects in the area to mitigate impacts where possible and further opportunities to manage construction fatigue will be considered during the detailed design and construction of the project.\n\nThe Planning Minister reviewed the Human Health and Cumulative Impact assessments and approved the Western Harbour Tunnel being aware of this cumulative impact. The assessments were prepared to meet the Secretary’s environmental assessment requirements and in accordance with national and international guidance endorsed or accepted by Australian health and environmental authorities.\n\nWe have been collaborating with relevant teams on nearby projects to align our work and minimise impact on you. We continue to work closely throughout the planning and delivery of our projects to achieve this outcome.\n\nTransport for NSW acknowledge a project of this scale will change the local community during construction and operation. We are committed to being the best neighbour we can and ensuring the safety of the community and our workers. The community will continue to be kept updated throughout all phases of the project.\n\nWe will use a variety of consultation tools and activities to inform and engage the community, stakeholders and our customers about our work as it progresses, including weekly portal updates, Community Updates, Fact Sheets, email updates, letterbox and online notifications and more. Following positive feedback, we will continue to offer online information sessions as a regular way of engaging with the community.\n\nDepending on health advice, we may not always be able to door knock residents who live close to our work sites, we may carry out any face-to-face engagement as appropriate. For more information about how we work with the local community, please refer to the Community Communications Strategy (CCS).\n\nWe are continuing to build our knowledge of your community and surrounding local businesses to help us identify further ways to minimise impacts during construction. We would like to invite you to participate in a short survey so we have a greater understanding of you and your circumstances. To complete the survey, please visit: nswroads.work/whtcommunitysurvey\n\nWe will continue to work with key stakeholders and the local community to identify issues and opportunities to reduce the impact of our work wherever possible.\n\nPlease complete this form if you would like to subscribe to suburb specific updates and stay up to date with the latest information on the Western Harbour Tunnel project.\n\nProjects in your area\n\nWe recognise there are other major infrastructure projects in this area and are working closely with other projects in the area. We are working closely with the Rozelle Interchange and Sydney Metro project teams to manage the cumulative impact as much as possible.\n\nGetting in touch\n\nIf you have any questions or would like more information, please contact the Western Harbour Tunnel project team:\n\nPhone: 1800 931 189\n\nEmail: whtbl@transport.nsw.gov.au"
