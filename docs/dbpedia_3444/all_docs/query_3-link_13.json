        "text": "The Western Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway Upgrade (the project) - proposed by Transport for NSW - has been approved by the NSW Government (the Minister for Planning and Public Spaces).\n\nThe project involves two main components:\n\n• a new crossing of Sydney Harbour via two 6.5km separate tolled motorway tunnels connecting the Westconnex (M4-M5 Link) at Rozelle and the Warringah Freeway at North Sydney (Western Harbour Tunnel);\n\n• upgrade and integration works along the existing Warringah Freeway, to connect new motorway infrastructure with the existing road network and provide infrastructure required for future connections to the Beaches Link and Gore Hill Freeway Connection project (the Warringah Freeway Upgrade).\n\nThe project forms part of the Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link program of works. While Beaches Link and Gore Hill Freeway Connection projects are subject to separate environmental assessment and approval process, together the projects would provide additional road network capacity across Sydney Harbour, improve transport connectivity to the Northern Beaches and provide benefits for freight, public transport and private road users.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel would involve a western bypass of Sydney’s CBD, providing an alternative to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Western Distributor and ANZAC Bridge, and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. The Warringah Freeway Upgrade would involve widening in parts, and associated surface road and intersection improvements. The provision of a continuous dedicated southbound bus lane would benefit public transport on the Warringah Freeway, providing direct bus access to North Sydney from the north."
