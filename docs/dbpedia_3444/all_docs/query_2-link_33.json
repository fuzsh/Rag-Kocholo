        "text": "The Sydney Harbour Tunnel has reopened in both directions after a truck fire forced its closure late today.\n\nPeople were trapped in their cars until the fire was out and the truck removed.\n\nThe fire broke out at the start of the afternoon peak, deep inside the southbound tunnel.\n\nA battery in the truck's engine compartment ignited, and flames and smoke poured from the vehicle.\n\nThe driver scrambled from the cabin, as his trucked burned as the tunnel sprinklers went off.\n\nSeveral fire crews were sent in.\n\nA 15 minute errant turned into a two hour nightmare for motorist Chris Kamen.\n\nTraffic in both directions ground to a halt, and the northbound lane was closed so firefighters could reach the scene of the emergency.\n\nBy the time the fire was extinguished the traffic had banked up for kilometres along the Gore Hill Freeway and the Eastern Distributor."
