        "text": "Whether or not you have a km0 for roads originating in a particular town, exit 0 is by nature a different animal. If only it was because some central point of origin (eg Puerto del Sol in Madrid) won’t ever have a motorway to it, let alone one that has an exit in that single kilometer.\n\nIf you have exit 0, it is always going to be on the actual point of origin of a motorway, a state border where numbering is being reset at best. Responding to the original question, Canada has a number of exit 0’s, and so has Spain (eg the exit when you enter from France near San Sebastián). In the US the convention seems to be that exits in the first mile always become exit 1, even if conventional rounding would have resulted in zero. Less sure about other countries using distance-based exit numbering, but you obviously also need to bear in mind that many routes don’t exactly start at 0.0 but slightly higher to leave some flexibility - so how many exit 0 could there be on conventional rounding? In China they reset exit numbers every 1000 kilometers, so you could run into exit 0 there midway. Unless they, too, have a rule against it.\n\nOn 06/08/2022 at 13:04, Henry Ung wrote:"
