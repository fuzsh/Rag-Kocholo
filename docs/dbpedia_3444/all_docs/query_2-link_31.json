        "text": "Sydney's Beaches Link toll road will now be completed in 2028 — two years later than initially intended — an environmental impact statement (EIS) has revealed.\n\nThe 7 kilometre tunnels will connect the Warringah Freeway at Cammeray to Balgowlah and Seaforth in the city's north-east, reaching a depth of 108 metres.\n\nTransport Minister Andrew Constance defended the rescheduled construction timeline.\n\n\"If you think about the magnitude of a multi-billion mega project like this, its typically a five-to-seven-year prospect,\" he said.\n\nThe EIS confirmed 41 properties would need to be acquired to build the Beaches Link.\n\nMr Constance said engineers building the tunnels would need to overcome \"terrible topography\", including having to erect temporary dams in Middle Harbour.\n\nOne of the more controversial features of the project are several ventilation stacks, some of which are slated to be built near schools and homes.\n\nThe stacks will be located at the Warringah Freeway at Cammeray, the Gorehill Freeway at Artarmon, Burnt Bridge Creek Deviation at Balgowlah and Wakehurst Parkway at Killarney Heights.\n\nThe EIS said ventilation outlets will meet air quality limits and be continually monitored.\n\nHowever, there remains significant community concern about the health impacts of emissions from the stacks.\n\nThe EIS also claimed impacts on significant heritage and indigenous sites \"are considered to be negligible\".\n\nEventually, people will be able to drive from the Beaches Link to WestConnex via the new Western Harbour Tunnel, which will direct traffic under North Sydney and Waverton to Rozelle.\n\nThe State Government said drivers would bypass 19 sets of traffic lights through The Spit, Mosman and Neutral Bay, shaving 56 minutes off their travel time from Dee Why to Sydney Airport.\n\n\"This tunnel is going to ease the pressure through communities which have had to deal with rat running, the challenge with Military Road, not only in terms of its congestion but has been a hotspot in terms of accidents with over 500 a year,\" Mr Constance said.\n\nHe said a tolling strategy for \"one of the deepest road tunnels in the southern hemisphere\" would be made next year during the financing process.\n\n\"You can't build this type of infrastructure without having tolling concessions in place ... there is a degree of user-pays,\" he said."
