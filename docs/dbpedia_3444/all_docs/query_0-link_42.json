        "text": "Project overview\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel will be the second road tunnel under Sydney Harbour. The tunnel will connect the WestConnex Rozelle Interchange with the Warringah Freeway in North Sydney. Key components of the project include:\n\ntwin tunnels, each with three lanes and approximately 6.5 km long;\n\ntunnel to tunnel connection to the M4-M5 Link;\n\nfuture connection options for Beaches Link and Gore Hill Freeway;\n\nsurface connections to City West Link in Rozelle, Falcon Street, and Berry Street in North Sydney; and\n\nancillary infrastructure to enable ongoing operation of the tunnel.\n\nOur involvement\n\nEMM was initially engaged by the to support the development of a tender bid to deliver the Western Harbour Tunnel project to prepare draft construction environmental plans (CEMPs), sub plans, monitoring programs and work with the tender design and engineering team to identify environmental risks and to innovate and develop strategies for improved project outcomes.\n\nInnovation during the tender process led to several proposed design and construction method departures from Transport for New South Wales’s approved concept design. These departures required the need to assess these departures for consistency with the Minister’s conditions of approval, assess obligations under the project’s revised environmental management mitigations, and prepare a series of consistency assessment reports.\n\nTechnical solutions\n\nAcoustics\n\nAir Quality\n\nConstruction Environmental Management and Delivery\n\nContamination Assessment and Remediation Management\n\nEcology\n\nGroundwater\n\nHeritage\n\nSurface Water"
