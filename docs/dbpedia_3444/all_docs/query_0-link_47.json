        "text": "The consequence of this recommendation was that when the M5 East was built, in the late 1990s, a tunnel was used for part of the Wolli Creek Valley and a rare pocket of green space in Sydney's inner south saved.\n\n\"I like to think, and I certainly will tell my children, that perhaps my greatest accomplishment in this lifetime was the part I played in saving the Wolli Creek Valley and the Cooks River Valley,\" Mr Kirby said.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Mr Kirby presided over an inquiry into the so-called Warringah Transport corridor, a road reservation that ran through the Castlecrag escarpment across Middle Harbour to Seaforth.\n\nThese investigations, which attracted thousands of submissions and sustained public interest, explored in detail issues that have continued to emerge as successive state governments have embarked on vast motorway projects through Sydney.\n\nOne issue is whether increasing road capacity really solved the problem of congestion. The Warringah inquiry likened dealing with congestion to dealing with old age â€“ a fact of life that can be managed, but not avoided.\n\n\"Like a facelift, the provision of more road space will afford, at best, a temporary respite,\" Mr Kirby's report said.\n\nOn the cover of the final Warringah Inquiry report is a photograph of the Castlecrag escarpment taken by Max Dupain, a resident of Castlecrag. The photograph was Dupain's wordless yet eloquent submission to the Inquiry, which found that a road across the harbour would have diminished the \"majesty\" of the land-forms.\n\nHowever, the proposed freeway to Warringah was not simply rejected upon environmental grounds.\n\nThe inquiry found that while the freeway had been proposed as a solution to congestion, it would have no significant impact upon congestion, because of the land use consequences of building a freeway. It would open up Warringah, so that it was likely that land would be re-zoned. It was common ground that another 80,000 residents could be expected, who would in turn generate traffic and the same level of congestion as before.\n\nIn respect of the Premier's most recent proposal, Mr Kirby said the same land use considerations arose.\n\n\"Whilst the proposal to build a tunnel is a significant improvement upon the environmentally destructive surface freeway that I was called upon to consider, the solution to the traffic woes of the Warringah peninsula is complex,\" Mr Kirby has written in a piece for the Herald.\n\n\"Options, including public transport options, should be identified and the public given the opportunity to express its view.\"\n\n--"
