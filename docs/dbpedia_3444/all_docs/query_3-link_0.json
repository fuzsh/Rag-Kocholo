        "text": "We know Sydney traffic can be frustrating, especially in peak hour. The Western Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway Upgrade will change the way you travel across Sydney Harbour. This project will get you to places faster by improving capacity and providing new direct routes and reliability on both sides of the harbour.\n\nThis much needed new crossing of Sydney Harbour will be a game changer for our city. You will save time on your journeys and enjoy more direct bus routes between the Inner West, Sydney and North Sydney, with seamless connections to the future Sydney Metro and Sydney Trains.\n\nBeaches Link\n\nOn 8 September 2023, the NSW Government confirmed the decision to cancel the Beaches Link project.\n\nTransport for NSW will write to the Department of Planning and Environment to withdraw its State Significant Infrastructure Application for this project.\n\nTransport will continue to carry out a road network review to assess what, if any, network improvements may be required in northern Sydney and other impacted areas to ensure a safe, efficient and reliable road network for motorists."
