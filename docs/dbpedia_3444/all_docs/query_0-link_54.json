        "text": "Warringah Freeway Upgrade Project\n\nThe significant $1.18 billion Warringah Freeway upgrade will accommodate population growth and increased transportation demands in Sydney by creating a continuous roadway from the Northern Beaches through the Western Harbour Tunnel to the WestConnex roadways system. Addressing traffic congestion and creating new motorway connections, key elements include a 4km stretch between High Street and Willoughby Road to reduce merging points and enhance safety and traffic flow. Interchanges at Falcon Street and High Street will be improved, with a new northbound on-ramp at High Street to relieve pressure on the existing ramp at Berry Street.\n\nThe project will also facilitate connections to the future Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link, enhance public transport links with a continuous southbound bus lane, and introduce new cycleways and pedestrian paths integrated with public transport networks.\n\nThe crucial Warrnambool Line Upgrade is set to improve train services between Melbourne and Warrnambool, benefitting passengers across the entire corridor. In partnership with Rail Projects Victoria, the upgrade includes over 200km of new signalling, two new crossing loops, and a new stabling facility. Through these improvements passengers will experience increased travel flexibility through more frequent and reliable train services.\n\nDT Infrastructure’s scope involves end-to-end signalling design, delivery, and commissioning, including the installation of six new signalling interlockings and 80 new signals to enhance safety. fully integrated train control system will be introduced on the V/Line network, optimising operational and maintenance performance while improving reliability. Furthermore, we have diligently carried out comprehensive systems engineering and assurance throughout the entire project lifecycle, guaranteeing seamless integration and operation of all railway components. This meticulous approach ensures the safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of the system, ultimately meeting the desired project objectives.\n\nGamuda’s exceptional health, safety and environmental management record has been recognised and rewarded multiple times by the British Safety Council, including the following :\n\nInternational Safety Award (with distinction) in 2015 for MRT Kajang Line\n\nInternational Safety Award (with distinction) in 2019 for MRT Putrajaya Line\n\nFive Star Occupational Health & Safety (OSH) Audit in 2018\n\nSword of Honour in 2019\n\nIn Australia, Gamuda became the first Malaysian-based company to achieve accreditation from the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner and we have pre-qualified to work with Transport for New South Wales roadworks level R5, bridgeworks level B4 and financial level F150+ (unlimited).\n\nInternationally, we have maintained key safety certifications in accordance with ISO 9001 – Quality, ISO 14001 – Environmental and ISO 45001 – Occupational Health and Safety Management System Standards.\n\nIn fact, the British Safety Council awarded Gamuda the Sword of Honour in 2019 for excellence in safety.\n\nGeneral information\n\nLocation: Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, Australia\n\nContract award date: 19 June 2022\n\nContract type: Design and Construct\n\nDelivery Partners: Joint venture between Ferrovial and Gamuda Australia\n\nProject completion: 2027\n\nProject value: $1.35 billion\n\nGamuda is a leader in design, using the latest technology and tools in our construction and infrastructure projects – be it in digital industrialised building system (IBS), 4D and 5D building information modelling (BIM) systems or in procurement systems.\n\nCertified by the Building Research Establishment as a BIM Level 2 Prepared Business, Gamuda is on the forefront of this transformative technology.\n\nWe have even developed our own augmented reality platform, called BIMAR, in which we can overlay virtual design and construction elements with real-time worksite images.\n\nBIMAR allows us to undertake a site visit with clients before construction even begins, which means we can identify and rectify any issues early and efficiently.\n\nTaking our BIM capabilities even further, Gamuda is revolutionising the construction industry by incorporating digital design tools, automation and robotic construction to prefabricate up to 85% components for residential, industrial and public buildings.\n\nNot only does this reduce construction time by half, Gamuda’s IBS has been independently verified by the Construction Research Institute of Malaysia to increase builder productivity by 300% and equip contractors for the Industry 4.0 revolution.\n\nGamuda has pioneered the use of variable density tunnel boring machines (VD TBMs) to manage the risks associated with tunnelling amongst even the most challenging geological formations.\n\nThe VD TBM is the world’s first automated system comprising custom artificial intelligence control algorithms, improving safety, quality and durability.\n\nExclusively available to Gamuda, this proprietary technology was awarded the Technical Product/Equipment Innovation of the Year award at the 2019 International Tunnelling and Underground Space Association (ITA) Tunnelling Awards in the USA.\n\nGamuda has been globally recognised for developing innovative engineering solutions. From the world’s first autonomous tunnel boring machine, to the world’s first tunnel with dual functionality for both traffic and stormwater (SMART).\n\nWe don’t just deliver solutions – we use innovative engineering to invent them. Gamuda’s variable density tunnel boring machine (VD TBM) was the world’s first automated system comprising custom artificial intelligence control algorithms, enabling autonomous control of tunnel boring machines which can switch between earth pressure balance, slurry mixshield, and high-density slurry modes.\n\nThis innovation allowed Gamuda to safely tunnel through Kuala Lumpur’s limestone rock during the delivery of the MRT Kajang Line and MRT Putrajaya Line. During use, the TBM pushed slurry into cavities detected in the limestone rock ahead of the machine’s cutter. By varying the slurry density the tunnel face was stabilised, minimising the risk of sinkholes appearing on the land surface. It prevented tunnel collapse and protected the TBM from damage.\n\nKey features\n\n14km of new and upgraded four-lane divided highway bypassing the Coffs Harbour CBD and urban area\n\nThree tunnels (approximately 1km in total) at Roberts Hill, Shephards Lane and Gatelys Road\n\nA new bus interchange and pedestrian footbridge servicing Kororo Public School\n\nThree grade-separated interchanges\n\nUpgrade of the existing Pacific Highway between Korora Hill and the dual carriageway at Sapphire\n\nLocal access and service roads adjacent to sections of the new highway providing connections for local residents and businesses.\n\nMore information on the project is available on Transport for NSW’s project portal.\n\nAn integral component of our commitment to sustainable and efficient use of resources is reflected in Gamuda’s circular construction framework. During the planning, design and execution phases, meticulous integration between design and construction is implemented especially to successfully achieve sustainability-related project goal and the process through which the project is managed.\n\nOur people are the cornerstone of our business and we are committed to their growth and development through a wide range of programmes and initiatives that include our Tunnelling Training Academy and our Enabling Academy.\n\nWith a commitment to be carbon neutral by 2040, Gamuda’s ecological stewardship programmes include the rehabilitation of wetlands in Malaysia, investment in the planting of native species of trees, development of urban parkland and a commitment to a reduction of waste through the circular economy.\n\nGamuda strive for continuous improvement and data-driven transformation, integrating business processes and operations to make disruptive business decisions. Gamuda’s technological advances in building information modelling (BIM) and industrialised building systems (IBS) not only ensure precision and quality, but enabled greater efficiency and productivity.\n\nGamuda is committed to operating with minimal disruption to the environment, with a guiding principle of giving back to the planet and local communities. Gamuda has built a diverse, vibrant workforce and continues to invest in our people to enable them to excel.\n\nOne of our key achievements is the development of the Enabling Academy in Malaysia to help people with autism gain sustainable employment.\n\nGamuda is committed to operating with minimal disruption to the environment, with a guiding principle of giving back to the planet and local communities.

Our mission is to invest in and train specialist TBM crew members in tunnelling academies here in Australia, as we have done in Asia, working with our community education partners to make this happen.\n\nTo this end, in late 2020 Gamuda signed MoUs with Registered Training Organisations HSAS and TAFE NSW as prospective delivery partners.\n\nOccupational Health and Safety ISO 45001\n\nQuality Management ISO 9001\n\nEnvironmental Management ISO 14001\n\nApproved by the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner\n\nAustralian Government Building and Construction Work Health and Safety Scheme\n\nAEO (Authorised Engineering Organisation) accredited by Transport for NSW\n\nSustainability\n\nEconomic, environmental and social sustainability has always been Gamuda’s approach. In everything we do we Build Right. For Life. Our value creation strategy in the sustainability framework, anchored on three key pillars:\n\nOur people are the cornerstone of our business and we are committed to their growth and development through a wide range of programmes and initiatives that include our Tunnelling Training Academy and our Enabling Academy.\n\nGamuda’s technological advances in building information modelling (BIM) and industrialised building systems (IBS) not only ensure precision and quality, they are also an integral component of our commitment to sustainable and efficient use of resources during the planning, design and execution phase. Championing this technology allows us to identify potential issues, reducing costly changes and wastage down the track.\n\nWith a commitment to be carbon neutral by 2040, Gamuda’s ecological stewardship programmes include the rehabilitation of wetlands in Malaysia, investment in the planting of native species and development of urban parkland and a commitment to a reduction of waste through the circular economy.\n\nGamuda has an excellent track record of creating jobs and training during the project delivery.\n\nIn 2011, Gamuda set up Asia’s first Tunnelling Training Academy which has since trained thousands of tunnel engineers and skilled superintendents. We have plans to replicate the Tunnel Training Academy in New South Wales to upskill the local construction workforce should the current tenders be successful.\n\nGamuda recognises the challenges faced by many people on the autism spectrum in securing meaningful employment, despite their myriad skills and areas of expertise.\n\nIn light of this, in 2013 Gamuda launched Project Differently Abled, which ultimately resulted in 20 people living with autism being employed by Gamuda.\n\nThe project was also a precursor to the Enabling Academy, established in 2017, which prepares people living with autism for gainful and sustainable employment.\n\nSince 2017 more than a dozen people each year have graduated from the Gamuda Enabling Academy, each of whom have gained employment across our 29 partner companies.\n\nAt Gamuda we believe in creating social value for local communities through partnerships that foster collaboration.\n\nBy 2022 there will be the need for 500 specially trained TBM tunnelling crew in projects across Australia. Our mission is to invest in and train specialist TBM crew members in tunnelling academies here in Australia, as we have done in Asia, working with our community education partners to make this happen.\n\nTo this end, in late 2020 Gamuda signed MoUs with Registered Training Organisations HSAS and TAFE NSW as prospective delivery partners.\n\nGamuda is committed to operating with minimal disruption to the environment, with a guiding principle of giving back to the planet and local communities. Gamuda has built a diverse, vibrant workforce and continues to invest in our people to enable them to excel.\n\nOne of our key achievements is the development of the Enabling Academy in Malaysia to help people with autism gain sustainable employment.\n\nLocal Partnerships\n\nAt Gamuda we believe in creating social value for local communities through partnerships that foster collaboration.\n\nExplore opportunities and get in touch today!\n\nIf you would like to register your interest to work on this project, please send your resume and a cover letter to employment@chbteam.com.au\n\nFor more information, or to register your interest as a supplier or subcontractor, please send your information to procurement@chbteam.com.au\n\nFerrovial Gamuda Australia joint venture will deliver the $1.35 billion Coffs Harbour bypass project on behalf of the Australian and NSW governments.\n\nGamuda is excited to be part of this project and, together with Ferrovial Construction, will be focussed on combining engineering smarts with environmental and sustainability innovation to ensure a positive legacy for the people of Coffs Harbour far beyond construction.\n\nContact details"
