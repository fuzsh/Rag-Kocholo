        "text": "INCOMPLETE PAGE\n\nSydney has an extensive 191.6km network of freeways, including the Sydney Orbital, a 110km network which incorporates almost every major freeway of the city except for the M4. Our oldest freeway is the Cahill Expressway, incidentally one of our most hated due to its appearence. Followed by this expressway a number of freeways begun construction across Sydney, including the M4 and Warringah Freeways. Throughout the 90s major work begun on construction more motorways across the city, with the M5 South Western Motorway and M2 Hills Motorway built in this decade, along with our second harbour crossing, the aptly named Sydney Harbour Tunnel, and the Gore Hill Freeway. The Eastern Distributor and M5 East opened before and after the turn of the century respectively, with the Cross City Tunnel opening not long after. The Western Sydney Orbital, or M7 Westlink, opened in late 2005.\n\nThe newest freeway is in fact the Lane Cove Tunnel, itself nearly 10 years old, and it is clear that some of our motorways need an extensive overhaul, including the likes of the M5 East and M4. Projects like the WestConnex and NorthConnex are underway, both of which open in 2019, and will help enhance connectivity across the city. ​\n\n​The slideshow below shows the history of Sydney's freeways from 1958 all the way to 2023 in the future.\n\nStart the slideshow from the beginning.\n\nA link to the GIF is available here."
