        "text": "2014 The project was identified in Infrastructure NSW's 2014 State Infrastructure Strategy. 2016 The 2016-17 NSW Budget allocated funding to commence planning. 2017 Coffey and AECOM were engaged to conduct geotechnical investigations along the route, including 235 boreholes. 2017 A Preferred route was announced and the market sounding process commenced. Nov 2017 A State Significant Infrastructure Application (SSIA) was lodged to identify topics that must be assessed in any future Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Jul 2018 In the July 2018 Project update, the NSW Government announced that both the Western Harbour Tunnel and the Beaches Link would be tolled, along with indicating the Tunnel contract would include the Warringah Freeway Upgrade. This contracting approach has since changed (see June 2020 update).
