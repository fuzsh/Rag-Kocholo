Investructure is providing Deputy Project Director support for this $4.2Bn Incentivised Target Cost (ITC) project. The complexities around the interfaces of a D&C contract at the southern end and another ITC on the northern end, along with the utilisation of an Asset Maintainer, is a unique opportunity for TfNSW to change the face of risk apportionment and Whole of Life considerations in mega projects. The Western Harbour Tunnel will be the second road tunnel under Sydney Harbour. The tunnel will connect the WestConnex Rozelle Interchange with the Warringah Freeway at Cammeray. Once complete and pending the construction of the proposed Beaches Link, there will be a continuous connection from WestConnex at Rozelle to Sydney’s Northern Beaches. Stage Two includes tunnelling between Birchgrove and the Warringah Freeway at Cammeray. Included in the project scope is: • construction of approximately 4.8 kilometres of tunnelling • harbour marine work, and • tunnel fit out. The harbour crossing section of tunnelling will be completed using tunnel boring machines. The remaining tunnelling will be completed using road headers.",
