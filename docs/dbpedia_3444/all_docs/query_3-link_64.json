        "text": "The Beaches Link Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Northern Beaches Tunnel project is now on display for public comment.\n\nWhile the Manly Observer is still reviewing the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) released today (December 9), some preliminary stand out points is the positioning of the ventilation stacks – at Burnt Bridge Creek Deviation at Balgowlah and Wakehurst Parkway (south side), and the acquisition of about 40 homes.\n\nWhat is the Northern Beaches Tunnel?\n\nThe Northern Beaches Tunnel, also known as the “Beaches Link” will have two entry/exit points at Balgowlah and Seaforth and connect with the Warringah Freeway in Cammeray. It’s about 7km in tunnels that goes deep under Middle Harbour.\n\nIt is part of a broader plan, including a Western Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway upgrade, which will eventually connect Balgowlah with the West Connex at Rozelle.\n\nIt is scheduled to be completed in 2028 and will almost certainly be a tolled road.\n\nToday’s statements\n\nPremier Gladys Berejiklian said the mega-project will include twin tunnels under Middle Harbour with three lanes in each direction, allowing commuters to avoid peak hour congestion on the Spit Bridge, Military Road and the Roseville Bridge. An explainer video was released today.\n\n“Beaches Link will transform the way people move to and from the Northern Beaches, bypassing 19 sets of traffic lights through The Spit, Mosman and Neutral Bay and help save up to 56 minutes between Dee Why and Sydney airport,” Ms Berejiklian said in a statement issued this morning.\n\n“Residents in Neutral Bay, Mosman and Cremorne will experience less congestion and noise, with traffic volumes expected to reduce by around a third along Spit Road.”\n\nMinister for Transport and Roads Andrew Constance said the project will integrate with new and existing public transport connections. The Wakehurst Parkway will be widened from one lane to two in each direction between Seaforth and Frenchs Forest.\n\n“We’re also planning more than five kilometres of new cycle and pedestrian pathways, including links to the Northern Beaches Hospital precinct.\n\nThe tunnel will be up to 108 metres in depth (approximately 33 storeys) and include new connections on the Gore Hill Freeway at Artarmon, Warringah Freeway at Cammeray and direct access onto Burnt Bridge Creek Deviation at Balgowlah and Wakehurst Parkway at Seaforth.\n\nWe will examine the changes in Balgowlah in a separate article.\n\nThe EIS will be on extended public exhibition from Wednesday 9 December 2020 until Monday 1 March 2021 and is available here."
