        "text": "The Western Harbour Tunnel (WHT) is the planned second road tunnel under Sydney Harbour. It will connect the WestConnex Rozelle Interchange with the Warringah Freeway. Once completed, the project will provide a continuous 6.5 kilometres of connection from Rozelle in the West to Cammeray in the North.\n\nThe WHT will have three lanes in each direction and will serve as a new western bypass of the Sydney CBD, offering an alternative to the heavily congested Anzac Bridge, Western Distributor, and Sydney Harbour Bridge corridors.\n\nProject Overview\n\nThe complex project involves both driven tunnels and submerged tubes with surface connections to City West Link at Rozelle and to Warringah Freeway, Falcon Street, and Berry Street in North Sydney. Ancillary infrastructure will be delivered to support the ongoing operation of the WHT.\n\nOur Role\n\nRP Infrastructure (RPI) worked with Transport for NSW’s (TfNSW) Western Harbour Tunnel Team on the procurement phase activities for Package 1 and Package 2.\n\nRPI prepared the Pre-Tender Estimates (CAPEX) consisting of Package 1 –Southern Tunnels from Rozelle Interchange; and Package 2- Immersed Tube Tunnel and associated marine works scope, northern tunnelling and project-wide mechanical and electrical and civil design and fit out scope. Our services included cost plan development and reporting, quantitative risk assessment and reporting, cash flow modelling and reporting. In addition to the Pre-Tender Estimates, RPI has also undertaken Peer Review of the Operational cost estimates (OPEX).\n\nThe team are subsequently providing Tender Evaluation Support for WHT (Package 1 and Package 2). The services to be delivered under this phase include development of pricing schedules and returnables; tender assessment including value for money assessment and reconciliation of tendered payment schedules against the Pre-Tender Estimate on a risk-adjusted basis.\n\nPackage 2 will be delivered as an ITC Contract. Part of our Tender assessment is to validate the Contractor’s TCE to provide TfNSW assurance that the TCE they will be signing up for is fair and reasonable for all parties."
