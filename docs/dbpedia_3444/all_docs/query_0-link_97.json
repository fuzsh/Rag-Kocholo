        "text": "A joint venture between CIMIC Group company CPB Contractors and Downer has been selected by the New South Wales Government to deliver the Warringah Freeway Upgrade in North Sydney.\n\nThe $1.18 billion design and construction contract will see the Warringah Freeway extended from the northern end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Willoughby Road, allowing motorist to travel on a single roadway from the Northern Beaches, through the Western Harbour Tunnel and into the WestConnex roadways system.\n\nThe project involves upgrading approximately four kilometres of the Warringah Freeway and associated works, including a dedicated bus lane and active transport links for cyclists and pedestrians.\n\nAdditionally, the project will include a new northbound ramp at High Street which will ease pressure on the existing ramp at Berry Street. Connections to the future Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link are also included in the scope.\n\nNew South Wales Minister for Transport and Roads Andrew Constance said the upgrade will reduce congestion and simplify the complex road corridor, which is used by up to 250,000 vehicles each day.\n\n“This crucial upgrade will make the Warringah Freeway more efficient and reliable for the drivers who use it every day, and will pave the way for the future Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link,” Mr Constance said.\n\n“More than 15,000 jobs will be created during construction of the entire Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link program, with about 600 direct jobs created for the Warringah Freeway upgrade.”\n\nThe Downer and CPB Contractors Joint Venture was among the three preferred bidders for the project, with a John Holland and Seymour Whyte Joint Venture, and an ACCIONA, Fulton Hogan and Georgiou Joint Venture also competing for the project.\n\n“We’re proud to be involved with the delivery of efficient urban transport networks and the creation of more liveable cities,” CIMIC Group Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Juan Santamaria said.\n\nCPB Contractors Managing Director Jason Spears promised the team will work closely with all stakeholders on the project.\n\n“We are pleased to have been entrusted by the NSW Government to deliver this important upgrade to the northern approach of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Our teams are highly skilled in delivering complex transport projects in the centre of major cities and will work closely with all stakeholders to safely deliver this upgrade while minimising disruption on what is one of the busiest freeways in Australia,” he said.\n\nEarly works are already underway with the main work to start early next year. Construction is expected to take approximately five years to complete, subject to the detailed design and construction program.\n\nThe New South Wales 2021-22 budget allocated $6.3 billion over the next four years for the Western Harbour Tunnel, Beaches Link and Warringah Freeway Upgrade, including $454 million in the 2021-22 financial year.\n\nThe community will continue to be updated throughout all phases of this project, with more information available at https://caportal.com.au/rms/wht\n\nRelated stories:"
