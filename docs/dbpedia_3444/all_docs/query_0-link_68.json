        "text": "The Rozelle Interchange tunnel project, described as one of the most complex underground junctions in the world, has opened in Sydney after three years of construction work.\n\nThe A$3.9bn (£2bn) Rozelle interchange is a 33km project that includes 24km of tunnelling underneath the Rozelle Rail Yards.\n\nThere three levels of tunnels within the Rozelle interchange, which “funnel” traffic in from a dozen different entrances including the City West Link, the Iron Cove Bridge, the Anzac Bridge and the M4-M8 link.\n\nThe Rozelle Interchange was constructed by the John Holland and CPB Contractors Joint Venture. John Holland is a tunnelling specialist while CPB Contractors is part of CIMIC Group.\n\nThe NSW government aims to connect the interchange up with the Western Harbour Tunnel scheme. Work has begun on the second stage of the latter scheme, which aims to ease congestion on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The project is a 6.5km tunnel that will connect the Warringah Freeway in North Sydney with the Rozelle Interchange, and is expected to complete in 2028.\n\nThe first stage of the Western Harbour Tunnel included 1.7km of tunnels for the southern section from Rozelle to Birchgrove and will complete in 2025. Stage 2 will involve the construction of the Warringah connection, and is expected to take five years.\n\nConstruction of the Rozelle Interchange began in 2020 and reached the halfway mark in 2021. The project forms the final stage of the WestConnex scheme, which comprises a 33km “traffic light” motorway network.\n\nMost of the entire 33km is underground, as the New South Wales (NSW) government has embraced plans to remove congestion by taking roads underground and opening up surface space for new development, and improving air quality.\n\nWestConnex has been delivered in four major stages. The new M4 motorway opened in July 2019, includes the 5.5km of tunnels and connects Haberfield to Parramatta.\n\nThe M8, which opened in July 2020, includes 9km of twin tunnels at the M5 at Kingsgrove to a new interchange at St Peters, with 6ha of new open space, built on a remediated former landfill site.\n\nThe new extensions of the M4 and M8 opened in January 2023, linking the M4 at Haberfield with the M8 at St Peters, with future connections to the Anzac and Iron Cove bridges via the Rozelle Interchange."
