        "text": "The Warringah Freeway Upgrade is improving one of Sydneyâ€™s busiest roads, making it safer and easier to use, and more efficient and reliable for the benefit of all including public transport users. The upgrade will include new civil construction and bridges, retaining structures, and cut and cover tunnels.\n\nWe carried out proof engineering for complex structures and certification of designs. These included 9 bridges with steel and concrete composite superstructures and deck structures, 12 retaining walls, and 3 cut and cover tunnels forming connections to the Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link. We then carried out associated geotechnical and structural independent calculations, design checks, and certifications.\n\nWhen complete, the upgraded freeway will connect to the Beaches Link and Western Harbour Tunnel, making travel faster, easier, and safer around Sydney."
