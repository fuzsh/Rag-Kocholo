        "text": "The Western Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway Upgrade was added to the Infrastructure Priority List as a Priority Project last month, with the proposal from the New South Wales Government involving the construction of a 6.5 km twin three-lane motorway from the Rozelle Interchange to the Warringah Freeway near North Sydney.\n\nThe Warringah Freeway between the northern end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Willoughby Road would also be upgraded.\n\nInfrastructure Australia Chief Executive Romilly Madew said constructing the new tunnel would be beneficial economically and for the community.\n\n“The Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Harbour Tunnel are critical transport links – carrying more than 250,000 vehicles each weekday as people travel into the CBD and through to other parts of the city,” she said.\n\n“By 2031, this is expected to increase to 300,000 as Sydney’s population grows.\n\n“Without an additional harbour crossing, we expect there to be additional traffic and delays around the Sydney CBD.\n\nApart from impacting community access to school, work and other essential services, our 2019 Australian Infrastructure Audit found that if not addressed, congestion on this part of the road network could cost the NSW economy more than $780,000 per day by 2031.\n\n“The business case developed by the NSW Government demonstrates a wide range of benefits for both drivers and public transport users, including significant travel time savings and improvements in travel time reliability.”"
