        "text": "Residents of Sydney's lower north shore say they are \"devastated and disgusted\" the green light has been given to the Western Harbour Tunnel, which will be the city's third harbour crossing.\n\nThe NSW Government today announced it had given planning approval to the 6.5 kilometre long tunnel which will have three lanes in each direction.\n\nThe project is expected to cost the NSW Government $14 billion.\n\nThe Stop the Tunnels group, a coalition of local school P&Cs, environment groups and residents groups based on Sydney's lower north shore, said their long-held concerns had been brushed aside\n\n\"We're devastated because this project is high impact and high risk,\" group spokeswoman Larissa Penn said.\n\n\"The route of these tunnels goes through Sydney's largest school zone ... we estimate about 20,000 kids will experience really high-level construction impacts for over 10 years.\n\n\"Those construction impacts aren't a passing inconvenience, they're really significant.\"\n\nThe group has made numerous submissions objecting to the Western Harbour Tunnel project, and presented a petition with almost 11,000 signatures to the NSW Parliament last year.\n\nBut Ms Penn said the community's concerns about ventilation pollution and traffic congestion had largely fallen on deaf ears.\n\n\"The kids will have a dozen unfiltered smoke stacks around them between Rozelle and Balgowlah by the time these projects are finished,\" she said.\n\n\"This project dredges the harbour at its most contaminated point, that's been well documented in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and objections.\n\nBut Transport Minister Andrew Constance said the Western Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway upgrade would help reduce pressure on one of Sydney's busiest stretches of road.\n\n\"The Western Harbour Tunnel will take pressure off the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour Tunnel, Anzac Bridge and Western Distributor corridors to revolutionise transport capacity in and around our city,\" he said.\n\n\"The new tunnel will start at the new Rozelle interchange and head under the Harbour to the Warringah Freeway and will integrate new and existing public transport connections.\n\n\"This city-shaping piece of infrastructure will deliver a vital boost to the NSW economy, with the tunnel and freeway upgrade, along with Beaches Link, expected to support around 15,000 full-time equivalent jobs.\"\n\nMr Constance assured local residents that the Government's Chief Scientist had considered the health and environmental impacts of the ventilation stacks.\n\n\"The reason the Government engaged the Chief Scientist to assess ventilation is to give that confidence so that people know the Government is not going to do anything that is unsafe or detrimental to the health of school children or the community,\" he said.\n\nMr Constance said the Western Harbour Tunnel would resolve a major \"choke point\" in Sydney's road network when it eventually connects to the Beaches Link and the WestConnex motorway.\n\n\"People who've had to endure the absolute frustration of congestion which has had everyone by the throat is now discovering the great benefits of [these projects],\" he said.\n\n\"The entire road network is going to dramatically change as a result of cars and trucks being underground ... and it'll completely transform the city for centuries to come.\"\n\nA 4km stretch of the Warringah Freeway will be upgraded as part of the first stage of the project.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel will be constructed by laying concrete tunnel tubes in a trench dug on the bottom of Sydney Harbour between Waverton and Rozelle.\n\nThe tunnel will join the Warringah Freeway at Cammeray to the Rozelle interchange in Sydney's inner west.\n\nThe NSW Government will start tendering for contracts and hopes to begin construction in the first quarter of 2021."
