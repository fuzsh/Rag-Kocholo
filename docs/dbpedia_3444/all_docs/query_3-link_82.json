        "text": "Transport for NSW Transport says it will continue to carry out a road network review to assess what, if any, network improvements may be required in northern Sydney and other impacted areas.\n\nThe Beaches Link was to be a new motorway, including a 7km toll tunnel, providing better connections between Sydney’s northern beaches and the rest of the city. It was to connect with the Western Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway upgrade, which are under construction. The Western Harbour Tunnel is a new Sydney Harbour crossing, designed to ease pressure on the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nThe six-year Beaches Link project was initially due to start this year."
