        "text": "Providing vital geotechnical and contamination investigations for the design of the Western Harbour Tunnel alignment\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link program is an important part of Transport for NSW vision to create an integrated road and public transport network, balancing the needs of motorists and local communities.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel stretches from the Warringah Freeway at Cammeray, across Sydney Harbour, to the WestConnex interchange at Rozelle. The Beaches Link provides an alternative to the Spit Bridge for the Northern Beaches, connecting through to the Warringah Freeway and Gore Hill Freeway.\n\nTetra Tech Coffey as a as sub-consultant to AECOM, successfully delivered the geotechnical and contamination investigations for the design of the tunnel alignment between Balmain and Seaforth. This involved the planning, logistics, supervision, logging, and sampling of the land-based boreholes drilling works in a complex urban environment, and management of all laboratory testing via our in-house testing laboratories."
