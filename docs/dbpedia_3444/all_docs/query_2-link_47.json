        "text": "RouteXpert Review\n\nSydney is the largest and oldest city in Australia and the capital of the state of New South Wales. You can start or end this tour as indicated in Sydney. Stay in Sydney for a few days to explore this city and climb the Sydney Harbor Bridge, visit the Sydney Opera House or visit the Taronga Zoo, you can reach this zoo by ferry from Sydney Harbor. And of course you can enjoy Bondi Beach from your hotel, which is literally at the entrance of the hotel.\n\nYou leave Sydney via the Pacific Motorway Sydney - Newcastle, this M1 Pacific Motorway, also known by the former names F3 Freeway, Sydney - Newcastle Freeway and Sydney - Newcastle Expressway; is a 127 km highway that connects Sydney with the Central Coast, Newcastle and Hunter regions of New South Wales. It is part of the AusLink pathway between Sydney and Brisbane. After an hour it is time to visit the Old Pacific Highway, this is a nice curvy part of a small 20 Km through Mooney Mooney Creek. Mooney Mooney Creek is a suburb of the Central Coast region of New South Wales, 60 kilometers north of Sydney along both sides of the river it is named after. It is part of the local government area of the Central Coast Council. Then you take the Pacific Motorway again up to Newcastle. Newcastle, an industrial town 167 km north of Sydney at the mouth of the Hunter River. The city had 288,732 inhabitants in the 2006 census, making it the 8th city in the country. You do not enter Newcastle, but you go onto the Pacific Highway, to leave it again after 4 KM, because in the Hunter Region Botanic Gardens, a coffee / lunch stop is planned and you can also take some nice pictures in the garden . The award-winning Hunter Region Botanic Gardens is managed and maintained by volunteers, and is used, among other things, for the enjoyment and education of people in the Hunter region and visitors from Australia and abroad. Then again a small 80 KM Pacific Highway to drive along the Lakes Way along the Myall Lakes, these are a series of freshwater lakes protected by the Ramsar convention. These are located in the Mid-Coast Council local government area in the Mid North Coast region of New South Wales. The Myall lakes border the east coast, about 250 kilometers north of Sydney.\n\nAfter about 160 km you leave the Lakes Way and turn onto the Pacific Highway again. At Kew, you leave the Pacific Highway, it is then just under 50 KM to the end point in Port Macquarie, where you can relive this more or less Highway route in the hotel's swimming pool.\n\nThis 4-star rated route is mainly about beautiful highways, with occasional trips through nature reserves and a few small towns where you can stop for a snack.\n\nGeneral info:\n\nNew South Wales is a state of Australia with Sydney as its capital, and is often abbreviated to NSW. The three most important cities are, from north to south, Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong, which are all on the coast. Other cities are Albury, Broken Hill, Dubbo, Tamworth, Armidale, Lismore, Nowra and Coffs Harbor.\n\nThe state is located on the east coast of the continent, north of the state of Victoria and south of the state of Queensland. In the west it borders South Australia. The coast borders the Tasman Sea. New South Wales has two federal enclaves: the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Jervis Bay Territory.\n\nNew South Wales can be physically divided into four parts:\n\nA narrow coastal strip, with a climate whose temperature varies from temperate on the extreme south coast to subtropical on the Queensland border.\n\nThe mountainous areas of the Greater Australian Separation Mountains and the highlands that surround it, such as the Southern Highlands, Central Tablelands and the regions of New England. Even though the mountain walls are not very steep, many mountain tops exceed 1000 meters, of which Mount Kosciuszko reaches 2229 meters as the highest peak.\n\nThe agricultural plains, which make up a large part of the area of the state. These areas are much less densely populated than the coast. This part includes the Riverina region.\n\nThe dry, desert-like plains in the far north-west of the state, which are unsuitable for settlements of any size.\n\nIt is the oldest colony of the former Australian colonies of the United Kingdom. The colony was founded in 1788 and originally included much more of the Australian mainland. At that time, the western half of the colony was called New Holland and the eastern half was New South Wales. New Holland was controlled from Sydney.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century large areas were separated around the British colonies Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) (1825), Victoria (1851), Queensland (1859) and South Australia (1836) (which at that time also included the Northern Territory) to shape. These colonies and Western Australia voted in 1901 to continue together as the Commonwealth of Australia.\n\nTourist attractions in the state include; The Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, a national park including the Three Sisters rock formation; The Hunter Valley, 150 km north of Sydney, the oldest wine region in Australia. The Snowy Mountains, on the border with Victoria, a popular ski resort, and the capital, Sydney.\n\nTop Car and Motorcycle Route from Melbourne to Brisbane\n\nPlanning to go through Australia by motorcycle? Then read the five tips below carefully, so that you can start your motorcycle holiday well prepared. Good preparation is half the job.\n\n1. Decide in advance where you want to rent your motorcycle. Find a reliable rental company with good reviews. By comparing the prices of various rental companies, you can save a lot of money.\n\n2. Plan your routes in advance. Australia is so big that it is useful to know in advance exactly where you want to go.\n\n3. In Australia you don't just get from A to B: you have to drive a long time to get to your next destination. Practicing long motorcycle riding is therefore definitely recommended.\n\n4. Always check the weather forecast. You can't take much on the bike, so only bring what you really need according to the weather forecast.\n\n5. Are you going in high season? Book your accommodations in advance. If you plan to go camping, invest in a good tent.\n\nMotorbike rental:\n\nAussieRider : https://www.aussierider.com/bikes/australie/#\n\nEagleRider : https://www.eaglerider.com/motorverhuur/australia\n\nGeneral:\n\nToll roads:\n\nToll roads are ideal for getting around or through a huge city like Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane quickly and very easy to use. There are no toll booths, so it is not possible to pay on site. The toll must be paid by yourself by telephone and credit card within three days after using the road or tunnel. When you pick up the rental motorcycle, you will receive all the information about this. It's a simple system but it requires action from yourself to avoid fines.\n\nMotorbike traffic rules:\n\nMotorcycling rules in Australia vary by state or territory. Inquire about the regulations on site.\n\nHelmet:\n\nWearing a helmet is mandatory for driver and passenger. The helmet must comply with the Australian Standard (AS/NZS1698) or the European Standard (UNECE 22.05), which is indicated on a decal or label inside the helmet. In some states, such as New South Wales and Victoria, a helmet may no longer meet the standard if a small camera is mounted on it, if speakers (Bluetooth) are built in, or if the helmet has a tinted visor.\n\nLighting: Dipped beam is not mandatory during the day, but is recommended.\n\nPassengers:\n\nThe carriage of 1 passenger is allowed. Children under 8 years of age are not allowed to be transported on the motorbike. Children from 8 years old may only be transported on the back if they can reach the footrests with their feet. Younger children may be transported in a sidecar. In several states, such as New South Wales, Northern Territory and Queensland, it is only allowed to carry a passenger if the driver has held a motorcycle license for more than one year.\n\nDriving side by side:\n\nTwo motorcycles may ride side by side, provided that their mutual distance does not exceed 1.5 m.\n\ntraffic jams:\n\nIn Australia it is allowed to slalom between stationary or slow-moving cars in a traffic jam (lane filtering) provided a maximum speed of 30 km/h is maintained and other traffic is not endangered.\n\ngas stations:\n\nIn Australia, a gas station is often referred to as servo (derived from service station). In the outback, a gas station is often called a road house. Pay attention; The number of filling stations is very limited, especially along the southern main route and the north-south connections. Keep this in mind and take enough spare fuel with you. For example, use the Fuel Map Australia app (fuelmap.com.au) to search for nearby gas stations and see current fuel prices.\n\nOpening hours:\n\nGas stations are usually open at least from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. or 8 p.m. Many gas stations in larger towns and along highways offer 24-hour service or have gas dispensers. When planning longer trips, keep in mind that outside the major towns and along minor roads, gas stations are not open at night or in the morning, and sometimes on Sundays.\n\nPay:\n\nCash can be paid at petrol stations. Credit cards are accepted at most gas stations.\n\nTank machines:\n\nMajor credit cards are usually accepted at fuel dispensers (pay-at-the-pump), but often require a PIN to be used.\n\nReserve fuel:\n\nBecause the distances between places in Australia are long and gas stations in the outback may not always have sufficient fuel in stock, it is recommended that you always carry a spare tank of fuel. It is prohibited to carry fuel in a reserve tank on ferries.\n\nView Route Collection\n\n8 Routes\n\n3536.16 km\n\n66h 38m"
