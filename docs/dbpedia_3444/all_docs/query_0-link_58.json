        "text": "Road users are being told to expect delays, with major works scheduled on the Warringah Freeway this coming weekend.\n\nChanged traffic conditions will be in place from 12am Sunday June 9 to 4.30am Tuesday June 11 to allow for the construction of new shared user bridges at Ridge St, North Sydney and Falcon St, Cammeray.\n\nFrom 12am to 8am on Monday June 10, there will be no access to the Warringah Freeway northbound from the Sydney Harbour Bridge. All northbound motorists from the Sydney Harbour Bridge will need to take the Pacific Highway exit.\n\nFrom 1am to 8am on Monday June 10, the Warringah Freeway will be closed northbound from the Pacific Highway, North Sydney.\n\nThe Sydney Harbour Tunnel will be closed northbound from 1am to 8am on Monday June 10.\n\nRoad user will need to take the Cahill Expressway over Circular Quay, the Sydney Harbour Bridge and take the Pacific Highway northbound.\n\nThe Sydney Harbour Tunnel will be closed southbound from:\n\n– 12am to 7am Sunday June 9 and Monday June 10\n\n– 10pm Monday June 10 to 4:30am Tuesday June 11\n\nMotorists will need to use the Cahill Expressway southbound and the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nAt other times across the weekend, there will be changed access arrangements for southbound motorists travelling to the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.\n\nThe Sydney Harbour Bridge will remain open in both directions over the weekend.\n\nThere will also be local traffic impacts for residents in North Sydney, Crows Nest and Cammeray to ensure capacity for the additional traffic on detour routes.\n\nSpecial Event Clearways will be in place from 10pm Sunday June 9 to 9am Monday June 10 on the Pacific Highway from Bradfield Highway to Falcon St (western side/northbound) and from 10pm Sunday June 9 to 8am Monday June 10 on Miller St from Pacific Highway to the Warringah Freeway overpass at Cammeray (western side/northbound).\n\nTransport for NSW coordinator general, Howard Collins said the bridge construction work is being timed to take advantage of lower-than-normal traffic volumes expected over the long weekend.\n\n“We will make the most of the Freeway and Tunnel closures during the long weekend to work on two new shared user bridges, using one 750 tonne and one 650 tonne crane. This is critical work that cannot take place during normal traffic periods,” he said.\n\n“The Sydney Harbour Tunnel will be closed both southbound and northbound on Monday morning, as the girders being lifted will swing over lanes to and from the tunnel.”\n\nOther disruption across the weekend includes the closure of the following ramps along the Warringah Freeway, from 12am Sunday June 9 to 4.30am Tuesday June 11:\n\n– the Berry Street northbound on-ramp.\n\n– the Ernest St northbound off-ramp.\n\n– the Ernest St southbound on-ramp.\n\nThe Falcon St northbound on-ramp will also be closed from:\n\n– 12am – 7am Sunday June 9\n\n– 12am – 7am Monday June 10\n\n– 10pm Monday June 10 to 4:30am Tuesday June 11\n\n[signup]"
