        "text": "For information on the Christian symbol, see Christian cross.\n\nFor other uses, see Cross (disambiguation).\n\nA cross is a geometrical figure consisting of two lines or bars perpendicular to each other, dividing one or two of the lines in half. The lines usually run vertically and horizontally; if they run obliquely, the design is technically termed a saltire, although the arms of a saltire need not meet at right angles.\n\nThe cross is one of the most ancient human symbols, and is used by many religions, such as Christianity. It is frequently a representation of the division of the world into four elements (Chevalier, 1997) or cardinal points, or alternately as the union of the concepts of divinity, the vertical line, and the world, the horizontal line (Koch, 1955).\n\nContents\n\n1 Etymology\n\n2 History\n\n3 As markings\n\n4 As emblems and symbols\n\n5 In heraldry\n\n6 In flags\n\n6.1 Sovereign state flags with crosses\n\n6.2 Other selected flags and arms with crosses\n\n7 Other noteworthy crosses\n\n8 See also\n\n9 References\n\n9.1 Notes\n\n9.2 Sources\n\n10 External links\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word cross comes ultimately from Latin crux, a Roman torture device used for crucifixion, via Old Irish cros. The word was introduced to English in the 10th century as the term for the instrument of the torturous execution of Jesus as described in the New Testament, gradually replacing the earlier word rood.\n\nHistory\n\nIt is not known when the first cross image was made; after circles, crosses are one of the first symbols drawn by children of all cultures. There are many cross-shaped incisions in European cult caves, dating back to the earliest stages of human cultural development in the stone age. Like other symbols from this period, their use continued in the Celtic and Germanic cultures in Europe. For example, celtic coins minted many centuries before the Christian era may have an entire side showing this type of cross, sometimes with the cardinal points marked by concave depressions in the same style as in stone age carvings. Other coins may be showing the cross held by a rider on a horse and springing a fern leaf, sometimes identified as a Tree of Life symbol.\n\nAs markings\n\nWritten crosses are used for many different purposes, particularly in mathematics.\n\nThe Roman numeral for ten is X.\n\nIn the Latin alphabet, the letter X and the minuscule form of t are crosses.\n\nThe Chinese character for ten is 十 (see Chinese numerals).\n\nThe dagger or obelus (†) is a cross\n\nThe addition (or plus) sign (+) and the multiplication (or times) sign (×) are cross shapes.\n\nA cross is often used as a check mark because it can be clearer, easier to create with an ordinary pen or pencil, and less obscuring of any text or image that is already present than a large dot. It also allows marking a position more accurately than a large dot.\n\nA large cross through a text often means that it is wrong or should be considered deleted. A cross is also use stand-alone (✗) to denote rejection.\n\nAs emblems and symbols\n\nPicture Cross Name Description Ancient Egyptian ankh\n\nAlso known as the Egyptian Cross, the Key of the Nile, the Looped Tau Cross, and the Ansate Cross. It was an Ancient Egyptian symbol of life and fertility, predating the modern cross. Sometimes given a Latin name if it appears in specifically Christian contexts, such as the crux ansata (\"handled cross\").\n\nBasque cross The lauburu. Christian cross\n\nAlso known as the Latin cross or crux ordinaria. It is the most common symbol of Christianity, intended to represent the death of Jesus when he was crucified on the True Cross and his resurrection in the New Testament.\n\nCoptic ankh\n\nThe Coptic ankh is an adaptation of the Ancient Egyptian Ankh used by early Gnostic Christians in Egypt; compare Coptic cross.\n\nOriginal Coptic Cross\n\nThe original Coptic cross used by early Gnostic Christians in Egypt.\n\nCoptic Cross\n\nA small circle from which emanate four arms of equal length, with angled T shapes in the corners, cross-pieces outward, representing the nails used in Jesus' crucifixion. This cross receives its name from Coptic Christianity, which centered on Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nNew Coptic Cross\n\nThis new Coptic Cross is the cross currently used by the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Coptic Catholic Church of Alexandria. It evolved from the older Coptic Crosses depicted above. A gallery of Coptic Crosses can be found here.\n\n# Double Cross\n\nUsed by doctors and veterinarians as an introduction on medical prescriptions in Denmark and Norway. It is read \"in nomine Dei\" and followed by \"rp\": recipe [1]\n\nSun cross, Bolgar cross\n\nAlso known as the Bolgar cross, Sunwheel, solar cross or Woden's cross. Used in Europe since the Neolithic era and by ancient and contemporary Native American culture to represent respectively Neopagan beliefs and the great Medicine Wheel of life. Was used by the Bulgarian Tzars (emperors) as a symbol of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\n\nHigh cross\n\nFree-standing Celtic crosses commonly found in Ireland and to a lesser extent in Great Britain, very common in churches and graveyards.\n\nCanterbury cross\n\nUsed in the Anglican Churches. It has four arms of equal length, each widening at the outer end in a hammer shape so that their rims nearly form a circle. Each arm bears a triangular panel incised with a triquetra symbolizing the Trinity. In the center of the cross is a small square. The Anglo-Saxon original, as a brooch, dates from c. 850 A.D. and was excavated in 1867 in Canterbury, England. A stone replica can be found in Canterbury Cathedral and in many other Anglican cathedrals around the world. [1]\n\nCrucifix\n\nA representation of Jesus' body affixed to a cross. It is primarily used in the Catholic Church, Anglican, Lutheran, and Eastern Orthodox churches, and it emphasizes Christ's sacrifice— his death by crucifixion.\n\nGreek cross\n\nUsed especially by Eastern Orthodoxy and Early Christianity Also known as the crux immissa quadrata. Has all arms of equal length and not much longer than the width. Often the arms curve wider as they go out.\n\nRed cross\n\nThe earliest emblem of the Red Cross is a red Greek cross on a white background; it is often claimed to have been derived as the inverse of the Flag of Switzerland, which has a white Greek cross on a red background.\n\nSerbian cross (Tetragrammatic cross)\n\nThe motif of a cross between objects is perhaps derived from Constantine's labarum and has figured on Byzantine coins, since the 6th c. Later, the 4 symbols of the cross have been interpreted as flints or firestones, but also as the initials (letters β) of the imperial motto of the Palaiologos dynasty: King of Kings, Ruling Over Kings (Greek: βασιλεύς βασιλέων, βασιλεύων βασιλευόντων—Basileus Basileōn, Basileuōn Basileuontōn). The cross has been used by Serbian states and the Serbian Orthodox Church since the Middle Ages after Dušan the Mighty was crowned Emperor (Tsar) of the Serbs and Greeks (16 April 1345). Today it is the national, religious and ethnic symbol of Serbs and Serbia.\n\nFlorian cross\n\nAdopted as an emblem by the fire service, this cross is named for Saint Florian, the patron saint of Austria and firefighters. Although similar to the Maltese Cross and Cross pattée, it differs in having arms rounded outwards at the ends. Two different versions are included here; the one above is commonly found on fire service badges, patches, and emblems; the one below is typical of the St. Florian medallion or medal.\n\nEastern cross\n\nUsed in the Eastern Orthodox Church. The top line is said to represent the headboard, and the bottom, slanted line represents the footrest, wrenched loose by Jesus' writhing in intense agony. It is raised to the left side, because that was the side of the righteous criminal who said to Jesus: \"remember me when you come into your kingdom\". This symbolises the victory of good over evil. The letters IC XC found at the end of the main arm of most Eastern Orthodox Crosses are a Christogram, representing the name of Jesus Christ (Greek: Ιησούς Χριστός). See also the Cross of Salem.\n\nSt. Brigid's Cross\n\nThis cross is found throughout Ireland. It is told that Brigid, daughter of a pagan king, made the cross from reeds to be used as an instrument of conversion. However, Brigid's name is derived from Brigit (also spelled Brigid, Brìghde, Brìde, and Bríde), a Celtic Goddess of fire, poetry, and smithcraft, and today the cross is used to protect houses from fire. This is an example of the integration of religious traditions.\n\nChi-Rho\n\nConstantine I's emblem, the Chi-Rho (from the two Greek letters that make it up) is also known as the labarum or Christogram. Several variants exist.\n\nLorraine Cross\n\nUsed in heraldry. It is similar to a patriarchal cross, but usually has one bar near the middle and one near the top, rather than having both near the top. Is part of the heraldic arms of Lorraine in eastern France. It was originally held to be a symbol of Joan of Arc, renowned for her perseverance against foreign invaders of France.\n\nMarian Cross\n\nIncluded on the coat of arms of Pope John Paul II, the Marian Cross is a Catholic adaptation of the traditional Latin cross to emphasize Catholic devotion to Mary.\n\nPisan cross\n\nThe coat of arms of the people of Pisa; now symbol of the Comune of Pisa.\n\nOccitan cross\n\nThe central figure in the coat of arms of the counts of Toulouse; now a symbol of Occitania as a whole.\n\nPapal Cross\n\nThe three cross-bars represent the Pope's triple role as Bishop of Rome, Patriarch of the West, and successor of St. Peter, Chief of the Apostles.\n\nPatriarchal cross\n\nSimilar to a traditional Christian cross, but with an additional, smaller crossbar above the main one meant to represent all the Orthodox Christian Archbishops and Patriarchs. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, this cross is sometimes seen with an additional, slanted bar near the foot of the cross (see Byzantine cross). This cross is similar to the Lorraine Cross, Caravaca Cross, and Salem Cross.\n\nCeltic Cross Popular in British Isles in Roman Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian denominations. Also called \"St. Luke's Cross\" by School of Theology (Episcopal) graduates that receive a cross upon graduation. Cross of Sacrifice\n\nA Latin cross with a superimposed sword, blade down. It is a symbol used by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission at the site of many war memorials.\n\nCross of Salem\n\nAlso known as a pontifical cross because it is carried before the Pope, it is similar to a patriarchal cross, but with an additional crossbar below the main crossbar, equal in length to the upper crossbar. It is also similar to the Eastern Cross.\n\nSt. Nino's Cross\n\nAlso known as a \"Grapevine cross\" and traditionally ascribed to Saint Nino, the 4th-century female baptizer of the Georgians, it is used as a symbol of the Georgian Orthodox Church.\n\nSt. Thomas Cross\n\nAlso known as a \"Mar Thoma Cross\" and traditionally ascribed to Saint Thomas, the Apostole of India, it is used as a symbol of the Syro Malabar Catholic Church and venerated by all Saint Thomas Christians denominations.[2]\n\nSt George's Cross (in Scandinavia)\n\nThe definition of a St George's cross is, in Scandinavia, extended to also include a centred cross, normally red but not necessarily, with triangular arms that do not fill the square.[3] The example beside is the cross of the Swedish Order of Freemasons.\n\nSaint Peter's Cross/Inverted Cross\n\nAn upside-down Latin cross, based on a tradition that holds that Saint Peter was martyred by being crucified upside-down. Today it is often associated with anti-Christian or Satanic groups.\n\nTau Cross\n\nAlso known as Saint Anthony's Cross, the Egyptian Cross and the crux commissa. It is shaped like the letter T. Francis of Assisi used it as his signature.\n\nThieves' Cross\n\nAlso known as the Furka Cross. The fork, shaped like the letter Y. [2]\n\nMariner's Cross\n\nThe Mariner's Cross is a stylized cross in the shape of an anchor. The Mariner's Cross is also referred to as St. Clement's Cross in reference to the way he was martyred.\n\nOrder of Christ Cross\n\nCross originally used by the Portuguese Order of Christ.

This symbol was adopted by many Christians, who often extended the lower arm in the manner of a Christian cross, creating what is now known as a Celtic cross. Some white nationalist and neo-fascist groups adopted this variation of the Celtic cross, made up of simple lines, without any of the ornamental complexity of traditional Celtic crosses. It is thought that this basic variation's minor resemblance to the swastika[citation needed] is the reason it has become popular in such circles. This variation was also used by the Zodiac killer at the scenes of his crimes.\n\nSwastika\n\nThe swastika is an equilateral cross with its arms bent at right angles, in either right-facing (卐) form or its mirrored left-facing (卍) form.\n\nArchaeological evidence of swastika-shaped ornaments dates from the Neolithic period. It occurs mainly in the modern day culture of India, sometimes as a geometrical motif and sometimes as a religious symbol. It remains widely used in Eastern and Dharmic religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Though once commonly used all over much of the world without stigma, because of its right-facing variant's iconic usage in Nazi Germany, the symbol has become stigmatized in the Western world.\n\nMacedonian Cross\n\nOne of the symbols of the Macedonian Orthodox Church – Ohrid Archbishopric. It is also known by the name Veljusa cross (вељушки крст) because it was found in the monastery of Holy Mother of God in Veljusa.\n\nIn heraldry\n\nThese crosses are ones used primarily or exclusively in heraldry and do not necessarily have any special meanings commonly associated with them. Not all the crosses of heraldry and the crosses with commonly known contexts are listed below.\n\nThere are numerous other variations on the cross in heraldry.
