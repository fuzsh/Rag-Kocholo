        "text": "Gran Canaria is no stranger to curious explorers of one kind or another. The third-largest island of the Canarian archipelago has seen pirates, privateers and explorers – including Christopher Columbus himself – come and go. And over the past few decades all manner of geologists have descended on the island to study its volcanic terrain. Now it’s your turn to discover this ‘continent in miniature’, and see its dramatic mountain terrain.\n\nA treasure trove for history buffs, Las Palmas is the capital of the island. Head to Vegueta, the city’s Old Town district where it’ll feel like you’ve travelled back in time. Stroll through narrow cobbled streets and alleyways and admire the old churches and brightly-coloured colonial houses. Visit the Cathedral of Santa Ana and its bell tower for panoramic views over the Old Town, the harbour and beyond.\n\nMost of Gran Canaria’s visitors come here to see the geological wonders a couple of hours outside the capital. The island’s most distinctive natural feature is the volcanic basin Caldera de Tejeda, right in the heart of the mountainous interior. Home to the sacred Roque Bentayga rock formation, this is an excellent area to explore and learn about the fascinating geological history of the islands.\n\nOnce aboard MS Spitsbergen, you’ll settle into your cabin and attend a mandatory safety drill. Locate the Science Center, the Explorer Lounge and Bar, the restaurant, and the observation deck – you’ll be frequenting these areas. After the welcome dinner, you can sink into an armchair in the Explorer Lounge with a glass of wine – your expedition is underway!\n\nIf you feel like extending your voyage, we recommend booking our optional Pre-Programme in Las Palmas to explore more of this beautiful island. The program includes an overnight stay in Las Palmas and an excursion taking you to the main sights of the city and the impressive Bandama Crater.\n\nOur next stop lies Just 78 miles off the African coast. The easternmost island of the Canaries archipelago, Lanzarote’s spartan, desert-like landscape, stands in sharp contrast to its lush green siblings to the west. Featuring a terrain fashioned by eroded volcanic formations, deep U-shaped ravines and vertical cliffs give way to a wide central plain covered with aeolian sand. Lanzarote is a geologist’s dream!\n\nLong before Arrecife officially became the island’s administrative centre, it was a popular fishing port. Today, it’s a welcoming sun-kissed town with bags of charm. Walk over the bridge to visit San Gabriel, one of two castles that overlook the harbour. Learn a little of the island’s history in the tiny museum and soak up great views from the castle.\n\nIt’s a short walk to Arrecife’s Old Town, which spreads around the Charco de San Ginés lagoon. Elegantly whitewashed fisherman houses, brightly-coloured boats bobbing in the water and lively bars and restaurants combine to form a pleasant maritime atmosphere. Stroll around this charming area and check out the main historical buildings. Visit the 17th century church San Ginés and, around the corner, Arrecife’s first two-storey building, the 18th century Casa de los Arroyo.\n\nWhen you’re done sightseeing, take a seat in an outdoor restaurant, order tapas and a drink, and enjoy life in one of the sunniest places on Earth.\n\nLanzarote’s ace in the hole is the quality of its stunning beaches. Head to El Reducto, the town’s main beach. Protected by natural reefs, this white sand beach resembles a large pool. Featuring clear, calm waters, it’s the perfect spot for some sunbathing.\n\nAlternatively, you can join an optional excursion to discover Lanzarote’s natural wonders. The spectacular volcanic landscape of Timanfaya National Park, the famous Jameos del Agua lagoons and long lava tubes are all within easy reach. And don't be fooled by the lack of mountains – hiking the volcanic trails of Lanzarote is a unique experience not to be missed!\n\nWelcome to Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the joint-capital of the Canary Islands. Santa Cruz is a major Spanish cultural destination with a vibrant harbour, charming old-town appeal, and a slick modern edge. The icing on the cake to this compelling mix, however, is a UNESCO-listed carnival, the second largest in the world. While Rio’s may be bigger few, would disagree that Santa Cruz’s carnival is more accessible with a safer, friendlier atmosphere.\n\nDon’t think for a moment think you’ll be arriving late to the party. Today, you’ll witness one of the most anticipated spectacles of the carnival, the Gran Coso Apoteosis, or Grand Carnival Parade. Get ready to take in a memorable exhibition of colour as you gaze at elaborate floats and decorated cars. Watch the Carnival Queens and the winners of the official carnival contest parade along the main streets of Santa Cruz before seeing a spectacular firework display.\n\nThere is more to Tenerife than carnival, however. The island’s interior is dominated by Teide National Park and the El Teide volcanic peak – the highest point on Spanish soil. Join one of our optional excursions to this stunning national park. Rising 12,188 ft. above sea level, El Teide forms an impressive backdrop for adventure. Explore a unique landscape of craters, volcanic cones, ancient rocks and streams of petrified lava.\n\nNaturally, the hiking opportunities offered in the National Park are outstanding. Various trails of differing lengths take in some of the most scenic vistas in the archipelago. Just be sure to bring a sturdy pair of hiking shoes or boots, and of course, your camera.\n\nAfter an adventure-filled start to your expedition, you’ll appreciate a relaxing day at sea to recharge. As we sail towards Madeira, soak your tired muscles in the hot tubs or simply recline out on deck and scan for wildlife. Alternatively, work up a sweat in the gym or the panoramic sauna.\n\nYou won’t want to miss the fascinating lectures given by members of the Expedition Team as they share their knowledge of Madeira with you and prepare you for the adventures ahead. Lecture topics today may focus on the archipelago’s history and wildlife, including birds and whales. Learn about the threat of invasive plant species on Madeira and how the local community is working to remove them from the National Park.\n\nDays at sea present an excellent opportunity to spend some time getting to know the crew and your fellow explorers. Strike up a conversation at the bar and see what you have in common with your shipmates.\n\nEnveloped by swathes of moist laurel forest, Madeira rises majestically out of the Atlantic in riotous shades of green. Generous layers of ferns, mosses and lichens cover volcanic rocks and ancient trees, creating a dense jungle habitat. Funchal, the island’s capital, is set in a natural amphitheatre on the sunny south coast. It couldn’t have a more idyllic location.\n\nA quaint and yet cosmopolitan city, Funchal has lost none of its old-world charms. Wander down the narrow winding streets of the historic Old Town and delight in the painted woodwork of houses, shops, cafés, galleries, and museums. Be sure to sample Madeira’s famed fortified wines in one of the many bars and restaurants.\n\nA visit to Funchal Cathedral is a must. Dating back to 1485, it has a beautiful wooden ceiling and is a classic example of Manueline architecture. A short walk from the cathedral is the historic farmers’ market, bursting with the vibrant sights and sounds of traders selling their fresh produce. Why not sample some local delights, including the exotic ananas-banana, literally – pineapple banana, which only grows in Madeira.\n\nYou’ll want to take the cable car to the picturesque village of Monte for glorious views of Funchal and the bay. While you’re up there, visit the 18th century Church of Nossa Senhora do Monte, and the paradisaic Monte Palace tropical garden. As you stroll around this landscaped haven, you’ll see its vast exotic plant collection, as well as art exhibitions from around the world.\n\nFor something truly memorable, slide your way back down to Funchal in exhilarating carros de cesto, or ‘basket carts.’ Essentially wicker baskets with seats set on wooden skis, hold on tight as you descend over a mile from Monte to Funchal!\n\nTo discover Madeira’s isolated hamlets, terraced agriculture fields and dramatic topography, feel free to join an optional excursion that takes you further into the interior.\n\nPorto Santo is so small it could fit into its sister island Madeira six times over. And yet, this dainty size is exactly what makes it so appealing. With Madeira getting all the attention, Porto Santo quietly offers those in the know a mix of picturesque scenery, gently rolling hills and miles of undisturbed sandy beaches.\n\nStay out on deck and scan for dolphins and seabirds as we approach the island. Cory’s Shearwaters, Northern Gannets and Great Skuas, are likely to be seen in the winter months. If you’re lucky, you might spot Sandwich Terns, Kentish Plovers, Manx Shearwaters and Bulwer’s Petrels as well.\n\nWe’ll dock for the day at Vila Baleira, Porto Santo’s small and compact capital. It’s an easy walk to the palm-lined square of Largo de Pelourinho where most of the island’s cultural landmarks lie. Start with the charming little church, Nossa Senhora da Piedade, built in the 15th century. Best known as the house where Christopher Columbus lived and had a son with a local noblewoman, the so-called Casa de Colombo is another must-see.\n\nGo full-local and relax while sitting in a café sipping vinho do Porto Santo, the island’s distinctive reddish-brown wine. Undoubtedly, most visitors are drawn by the almost-five miles of golden sands that line the coast. You can take it easy and frolic in the turquoise waters or take one of several walks if you’re feeling energetic.\n\nWalk all the way down to Ponta da Calheta on an optional excursion for gorgeous views over the craggy island of Ilhéu da Cal. An alternative hike will take you north to the summits of Pico do Castelo and Pico Branco, rewarding you with stunning birds-eye views. For something a little different, cross the island to drink the reputedly miraculous spring water of Fonte da Areia, said to guarantee eternal youth.\n\nAfter your days of exploration on land, you’ll be ready for another leisurely day aboard the ship. Recline in the panoramic Explorer Lounge, drink in hand, and take in the view. Watch the waters for whales and dolphins and keep an eye on the sky for seabirds. Now’s the time to reflect on your adventures so far, edit your photos, update your travel journal, and rest your legs.\n\nBy the time we return to the Canary Islands, you’ll be primed and ready for what’s in store. Located off the western coast of Africa, the archipelago has a history of its own. Initially populated by peoples of Berber origin, the islands are reputed to have been visited by Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, and Romans, before the Spaniards settled in. Dominated by large active volcanoes, including the mighty Teide, the Canaries are ripe for exploration.\n\nTo better equip yourself and build excitement for the next part of your adventure, spend some time in the library reading up on the places you’ll visit, or attend lectures from the Expedition Team in the Explorer Lounge. Lecture topics may include subjects such as the volcanoes of the Canary Islands, wine making, wildlife or botany.\n\nLa Palma more than lives up to its nickname La Isla Bonita, or ‘The Pretty Island’. Home to unspoiled pine and laurel forests, banana trees and palm groves, La Palma is certainly the greenest of the Canary Islands. Add rugged gorges, towering mountains, and sheer cliffs, and you have an island that has it all.\n\nIn the old days, Santa Cruz de la Palma served as a trading post on the way to the New World. Today, the island’s capital is widely considered one of the most attractive towns in the archipelago.\n\nStart your exploration of the city by heading to Calle Real, Santa Cruz’s vibrant main street. You can’t miss the monumental Plaza de España, lined with magnificent Renaissance-era buildings, including Santa Cruz’s iconic city hall. For many, it’s the best example of Canarian architecture to be found.\n\nYou’ll see traditional wooden balconies lavishly adorned with plants and flowers on many streets. If you want to see the best examples, head to Avenida Maritima, just five minutes from the Plaza de España.\n\nNo visit to Santa Cruz would be complete without a stroll through the districts of La Canela and Sant Telmo, with their air of faded colonial glory. If you like quirky buildings, head to the eccentric La Palma Island Museum set inside an old convent. It has everything from natural history and local crafts to astronomy and art exhibitions.\n\nHiking in La Palma is superb, with some walks starting right in Santa Cruz. The most impressive areas to hike, however, are found further afield. The central highlands, the southern volcanoes and the spectacular Caldera de Taburiente National Park offer fantastic walks rated as among the best in the archipelago. Join us on an optional excursion and enjoy some of the best walking in the Canaries!\n\n​\n\nOnly a million years old, El Hierro is the youngest, smallest and westernmost of the Canary Islands. You’ll feel that sense of remoteness the moment you set foot on the island. It’s a straight line across the ocean to the Americas from here.\n\nTypical of the Canaries, El Hierro is a volcanic island with characteristic dark rocks shaped by eruptions, powerful winds and landslides. With the unique geology of an oceanic volcano in the early stage of shield development, it’s no wonder that UNESCO has classified it as a World Biosphere Reserve.\n\nEl Hierro lacks natural harbours, so most of the villages are inland. Valverde, the only landlocked capital in the Canaries, is just over four miles away from La Estaca, our port for the day. Founded in 1610 – much later than any other capital in the Canaries – Valverde is a relaxing small town. You won’t find traffic lights or fancy shops here, just the easy-going atmosphere of the most traditional capital in the archipelago.\n\nBy far, walking is the best way to explore El Hierro. On an optional excursion, you’ll visit the island’s natural highlights, which are conveniently crisscrossed by a network of marked trails suitable for all fitness levels. Discover shimmering natural pools, lava-sculpted rocks, pine forests, peaceful flower meadows and twisted trees bent by the force of the elements. By the time we wave goodbye to El Hierro, you’ll have a heightened appreciation of this beautiful gem of an island.\n\nThe second smallest of the Canary Islands is also the most untamed. If you’re looking for an authentic slice of traditional Canarian life, La Gomera is the place to experience it.\n\nFounded in 1487, San Sebastián is the charming capital of the island. Columbus called here before heading to the Americas, and so did British and Portuguese pirates, seeking to plunder New World fortunes.\n\nSan Sebastián is small enough to explore on foot. Stroll along the main street of the Old Town, Calle Real, to take in the best the town has to offer. The Iglesia de la Virgen de la Asuncion is a must-see church. A traditional Baroque style building, Columbus and his men are said to have prayed here before setting sail.\n\nIt’s a leisurely stroll to the 15th century fortress Torre del Conde, a beautiful whitewashed stone building in a lovely green space. Head to the intriguing Archaeological Museum of La Gomera, where you’ll learn all about the island’s first settlers and much more.\n\nLa Gomera’s steep ravines and narrow valleys caused the islanders to develop a unique way of communicating over long distances: a loud whistling called el silbo. Listening to a demonstration of this traditional form of communication on an optional excursion is always a highlight.\n\nThe top of this almost circular volcanic island is crowned by the jaw dropping Garajonay National Park, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Join an optional excursion to enjoy pleasant hikes through laurel forests and idyllic palm-covered valleys to high mountain walks and panoramic peaks.\n\nA spectacular circular path follows the island’s perimeter, featuring trails that will satisfy walkers of all levels of fitness. While we won’t suggest you do the entire 87-mile length, a walk to the black sands of Playa la Guancha with its panoramic views will be well worth it.\n\nYour expedition comes to an end back where it all started, in Gran Canaria. Here’s your chance to get to know the island even better, and discover all that the ‘continent in miniature’ has to offer.\n\nIn terms of diversity, Gran Canaria has it all – dunes, subtropical valleys, deep ravines, palm-dotted oases, pine forests, spectacular cliffs and jagged mountain ridges. And that’s before we mention sunshine, beaches and the sea. Gran Canaria has more than 60 miles of beach! And there is no need to go far, as the beach scene starts in Las Palmas itself.\n\nMost of the island’s natural features are now listed as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and are made for walkers. Gran Canaria has almost 620 miles of marked trails – and many of them are incredibly old, established to connect isolated villages during the first decades of the Spanish conquest. Leave the coast, get onto the trail network, and you’ll probably have the landscape pretty much to yourself.\n\nGran Canaria is also one of the best islands in the Canaries to learn about the Guanches, the original inhabitants of the archipelago. Museo Canario in Las Palmas should be your first port of call, but you’ll find fascinating archaeological sites scattered around the island.\n\nWhy not extend your stay to discover more of the island? During our optional post-Programme, you will have the opportunity to learn why this island is dubbed the ‘continent in miniature.’ The programme includes an overnight stay in a hotel in Las Palmas and an excursion taking in the capital’s landmarks and the lush Bandama Crater.\n\nWhatever is next for you, we look forward to welcoming you back on your next adventure!"
