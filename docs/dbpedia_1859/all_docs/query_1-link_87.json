The black charge standing on the barry wavy base of the coat-of-arms is a key.\n\nSantiago Dotor, 03 May 2000\n\nThe coat of arms’ on the flags I spotted at the town hall and in various other places in Puerto de la Cruz in February 2010 had a total height of at least 80% of the height of flag.\n\nKlaus-Michael Schneider, 08 Mar 2010\n\nCoat of Arms\n\nimage by Klaus-Michael Schneider, 14 Apr 2007\n\nThe shield is divided per fess. The chief shows a green dragon with red tongue in a golden (yellow) field topped by a red Latin cross (not a Cross of Santiago). The base shows three silver (white) fessy wavy lines in a blue field superimposed by a black key with the beard pointing to the right side. The shield is topped by a coronet.\n\nThe current coat of arms is used since 27 May 1964, allowed by the council of ministers (of Spain? Of the islands?). The coat of arms is said to have been designed by Bruno B. Heim, born in Switzerland in 1911. Heim was a priest, titular archbishop of Xanthus and had written various books about heraldry.\n\nThe coat of arms reflects historical issues which characterize the municipality. According to Leopoldo de la Rosa Olivera, the dragon represents the guardian of the gardens of the Hesperides, in which there grew the tree with golden apples. (see also the coat of arms of La Orotava). The cross refers not only to the cities name but also to the Christian tradition. The waves represent the maritime roots of the city, bringing trade, development and expansion. The key opens the way across the sea to India, especially in the past. The coronet symbolizes incorporation into the Kingdom of Castille and Leon.\n\n(my rough translation from source in Spanish: \"Entender un simbolo\" (\"Recognizing a Symbol\") edited by the Municipality of Puerto de la Cruz (colours according to own photo, shot on 21 Jan 2007 in Puerto de la Cruz)\n\nSources and Credits\n\nKlaus-Michael Schneider, 15 Apr 2007\n\nQuite Heim's style. His heraldic animals look fantastical; in this, he followed the medieval mind.\n\nJan Mertens, 15 Apr 2007"
