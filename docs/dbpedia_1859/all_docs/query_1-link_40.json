        "text": "This last post of 2022 will also be the final one of my “Climate Journeys” series—part summary, part new twist.\n\nI’ve been describing continental and global patterns of climate zonation with a focus on linear “journeys” across them because my primary interest is in personal experiences of these patterns—my own (so far and maybe to come) or more generally. The reason I find these experiences exciting to begin with is connected to the underlying theme of this entire blog and my entire body of work: the empowering “world-at-my-fingertips” sensation I (and others too?…an ongoing question) experience from seemingly “compressed,” more “knowable” versions of environmental spaces and phenomena that we typically think of as being larger-than-life. (In a conservation context this “empowerment” idea becomes a little loaded, something I’ve brought up before and will be getting back to in later posts.) Climatic variation, typically operating on scales of hundreds or thousands of miles, is an example of these larger-than-life phenomena, and it can be “compressed” in a few different ways.\n\nOne way—the subject of most of the blog and work—is through topography, which can create sharp temperature and rainfall gradients across divides or climbing mountain slopes. The aim of many of the worldviews is to heighten this type of miniaturization even further. This post, though, will focus on cases where oceanic and meteorological patterns are compressed without the influence of topography. As I’ve written before, this second type is arguably more impressive for the very reason that elevation isn’t involved, even if the down-scaling isn’t quite as extreme as, say, in crossing between the leeward and windward sides of certain Hawaiian islands. (Like the topographical kind it could also be accentuated virtually, through some sort of sampling along a transect or maybe speeding up in film; I went into some of the possibilities in my earlier “Long Gradients” series and so won’t get into it further here.)\n\nI’ve already described one example of non-topographical compression—the roughly 1200km/800mi transition from the Peruvian desert (less than 2” of rainfall—not as dry as the Atacama but perceptually not that different) to what’s probably the world’s wettest low-elevation rainforest on the southern Colombian coast with over 200.” That’s about the length of the state of California, though the most perceptibly dramatic part of the gradient, from the northern edge of the desert to the southern edge of the rainforest, from the maps at least seems to be squeezed into only about half that distance. (As I said earlier my on-the-ground experience wasn’t quite so dramatic, but that was probably a function of the time of year and the particular route taken.) To simplify a bit this second time around, essentially the cold Humboldt Current pulls the South American coastal desert northward far beyond what would be predicted by latitude, while the wet zones shift northward to a much smaller degree. It’s the ocean temperatures, then, that are “compressed.”\n\nBut in the South American example the corresponding effect on the land in terms of climate (precipitation in that case) and vegetation is dramatic. In North America, while there is a perceptible shift in native and cultivated vegetation between Cape Hatteras and the Delmarva Peninsula (palmettos and Spanish moss disappear, for example), the terrestrial effect isn’t quite what the ocean temperature map would suggest. One reason is that the Gulf Stream doesn’t have anywhere near as strong an influence on land temperatures in North America as the North Atlantic Drift (its eastern continuation) does in Europe. The current gives the Isles of Scilly at the tip of southwestern England about the same average winter lows as Jacksonville, Florida, rather than making both climates correspondingly milder. The main reason for the uneven effect is, as I’ve talked about before, the westerly direction of the prevailing winds—blowing over land along the east coast of North America but over water along the coast of Western Europe. Another reason, if you look more closely at the map, is that north of South Florida the heart of the Gulf Stream (in red) actually flows a ways offshore.\n\nThe current does, though, have a significant warming effect on one particular piece of land in the western Atlantic—Bermuda. It isn’t located in the warmest part of the current either but the winds from the west do have an expanse of water to blow over, giving the island a borderline tropical climate with winter lows similar to West Palm Beach despite its being at the same latitude as the Georgia-South Carolina border. A former design colleague and fellow plant enthusiast of mine, Brett Desmarais, and I frequently geek out on anomalies in vegetation/hardiness zones; at some point we came up with the idea of a hypothetical archipelago (“Nantuda”) that would make the compressed warm-cool water temperature gradient between Bermuda and Nantucket perceptible on land. Brett came up with a layout of five islands “protruding” from an actual range of seamounts.\n\nToday the resident population is about 350, and while tourism has become the island’s biggest industry only 400 visitors are allowed at any one time. Lord Howe has also been a remarkable success story in terms of reversing past ecological damage, especially for an inhabited island. Pigs, cats, and goats were eradicated in the last few decades of the 20th century, and rats and mice—the former responsible for additional extinctions—have been eliminated through an intensive (and very controversial) program of blanketing the island with poisoned bait by hand and helicopter in 2019. (When I was there ten years earlier I remember hearing that the plan was going to involve evacuating all people, cows, and—Noah’s Ark-style—representatives of endemic bird species during the process. That was apparently scaled back somewhat, with the residents and much of the cattle population remaining.) These eradications have led to a significant and perceptible rebound in native species populations. Also you might have read about the 15cm-long Lord Howe stick insect or “tree lobster” recently rediscovered under a bush on a nearby rock called Ball’s Pyramid—now it can likely be re-introduced on the main island where rats had wiped it out. Exotic plants are also an issue as on most islands, though there have been successful efforts at controlling invasive weeds, and on a more experiential level I remember non-native trees being rare in public areas of the settled zones. (The main exception was Norfolk pines, which bugged me particularly because they stood out so much.)\n\nSo compared to other inhabited, biologically significant islands I’ve visited (especially Robinson Crusoe, of somewhat comparable size and population yet almost entirely transformed or degraded), Lord Howe is exceptional. The indigenous landscape feels present everywhere; it hasn’t been reduced to tiny fragments that you need special guidance—or an actual guide—to find. (Getting to the cloud forest does require a guide, but not because it’s been destroyed in all the more accessible places.) The human elements that do exist are limited enough to be picturesque in a way—garden- or storybook-like.\n\nI’ve written about a few of these environments previously—this post will summarize and situate them within the larger-scale rainfall gradient and introduce a few others. (Because of topographical variation they don’t quite form a continuous chain down the coast, but many more than these exist.) I probably don’t need to say again that I find these environments thrilling, and am surprised they aren’t more well-known.\n\n“Fog Forests”\n\nThe fog-scapes at the northern end of the rainfall gradient, inland from the coast of central Ecuador between 400 and 800m of elevation, once again are true forests, taller and more luxuriant than the surrounding dry forests. They’re like the cloud forests we typically think of but unlike, say, rainy Monteverde in Costa Rica, they wouldn’t exist at all without the fog (called garúa in Ecuador and Peru). The effect of the fog is self-reinforcing in that the trees themselves intercept a great deal of it, which then slowly drips to the forest floor.\n\nWhile they’re about 900km from the mainland and I haven’t seen the relationship made explicitly, you might say that the wet highland forests of the Galápagos Islands also fit into this fog forest category (or at least the tiny fragments that still exist). The Humboldt/Peru Current flows past the islands as it heads westward away from the continent, essentially drawing them into the mainland rainfall gradient. The arid lowlands of the archipelago could generally be considered part of the same semi-desert/dry forest zone as the central coast of Ecuador; the primarily garúa-dependent highland forests (beginning as low as 300m above sea level) would be the fog forest equivalent. Like all Galápagos environments though, these forests are very distinctive, with low stature and species diversity; they’re formed exclusively by trees in the endemic genus Scalesia. (For a lot more detail on Galápagos vegetation zones, including the surreal too-wet-for-trees zone above the forest, check out my post on Santa Cruz Island.)\n\n(There’s a lot more to say about Fray Jorge, and as I shared in my last Newsletter I’ve recently completed a worldview that it inspired—that’ll be my next post!)\n\n“Hygrophilous Forest”\n\nThis one I actually haven’t been able to visit, but it rounds out the discussion well since as far as I can tell it represents the continent’s southernmost fog-scapes, around the latitude of Santiago where the influence of the coastal fog belt peters out.\n\nMoving south into the subtropical shrubland (Mediterranean) zone, the fog supports “hygrophilous” forests (the term, which I hadn’t come across before, means “damp”). Like Fray Jorge’s forest pockets these forests are evergreen and have close affinities with the temperate rainforests to the south, though in this case I haven’t seen them referred to as “rainforests” themselves. Unfortunately I can’t speak to their atmosphere in that regard, from experience or from photographs (of which I haven’t found any). According to the only description I’ve seen of these forests, the best examples are found in west-facing valleys in La Campana National Park, about 50km to the northwest of Santiago and from the coast. I did spend a few days there but didn’t know at the time that these forests existed. They do receive more rainfall than Fray Jorge and have an abundance of lichens and epiphytes including Spanish moss (actually species a bromeliad), so my guess is that they do have a more rainforest-y aspect. Whether they could give my diagram a nice symmetry as the temperate equivalent, precipitation- and character-wise, of Ecuador’s fog forests would be interesting to know.\n\nAnother comparison might be to the SF Bay Area’s redwood forests, which are also highly dependent on fog and are located in another subtropical shrubland/Mediterranean zone (though with slightly higher rainfall…Santiago is at the equivalent latitude of Los Angeles). These I’ve also seen classified as “rainforests” by some and not others, depending on whether “rain” is taken to mean “precipitation” in general.\n\nGiven that I only had the chance to visit a small number of these fog-scapes, and not at the ideal time of year, I’d really like to put together some sort of creative project to explore/portray them as a unit—which I haven’t seen done before, even just in text—and at their most evocative. I think it would make both a more feasible and a more interesting proposal than, say, my long gradient transect idea. Plus, though I haven’t seen detailed predictions, I think it’s pretty certain that (with the context of their dry surroundings) these ecological gradients/contrasts are going to be easily and heavily affected by climate change, given the fog-scapes’ tiny scales and the finely-tuned climatic meteorological generating the region’s fog patterns.\n\nDarren\n\nTechnically the two ends of that roughly 1200km distance—Lobitos, Peru, with about 50mm/2in of rainfall and Buenaventura, Colombia, in the vicinity of the world’s wettest sea level location with about 5000mm/200in—aren’t even the true extremes. A few hundred km farther north, Lloró, Colombia is the second-wettest place anywhere on earth, receiving about 13,000mm/500in. And the actual minimum of essentially zero rainfall is in northern Chile. But at those extremes the additional increase and decrease are, vegetation-wise, relatively imperceptible. (Coastal Colombia’s record precipitation levels have been less well explained than the Peruvian/Chilean desert’s record dryness, but given that the two are located so close together, according to Trewartha it would make sense if a single phenomenon is responsible for both—probably the cold current).\n\nMy own experience of this gradient is a lot less complete than the Chilean one despite the shorter distance. That’s mostly for practical reasons—on the northern end, the coast of northern Ecuador/Southern Colombia isn’t considered very safe and the Colombia side is mostly wild and roadless. To the south, the pattern is interrupted/obscured by the Gulf of Guayaquil and the Guayaquil metropolis. Given those limitations and my assumption that renting a car would’ve been less advisable than in Chile (though I never actually looked into it), I didn’t set out to capture it in any systematic way. But in 2018, tacked onto a few weeks in the Galápagos, I did get a driver to take me the 300km from Guayaquil north to Manta, mostly along the famous “Spondylus Route” connecting popular scenic and cultural attractions along the coast. That did allow for more flexibility than a bus would have, but I decided to keep things simple and limit my immersive experiences to some low-key hiking in one national park.\n\nI was, though, also looking forward to the views from the car window. As you might’ve noticed on the maps above, particularly the vegetation map, a significant piece of the gradient is actually squeezed in between Guayaquil and the coast. That’s because rainfall also increases dramatically from the coast heading inland: the influence of the cold current rapidly decreases moving eastward just as it does northward. But that piece of the drive turned out to be underwhelming. I think this was because most of the vegetation was in leaf (the rainy season was supposed to have ended by then but it didn’t look like it), blurring the wet-dry distinction, and the gloomy weather probably made it even harder to see. The fact that there isn’t much natural vegetation left didn’t help either. Also, according to Trewartha the coastal vegetation in that region is more lush that might be expected from the low rainfall because of the fog drip and overcast skies, though I’m not sure why those factors wouldn’t have the same effect in the “real” deserts to the south. And his own maps do show desert creeping up the coastline. So, it’s still a mystery to me.\n\nThe national park I visited is Machalilla, which includes one of Ecuador’s few intact remnants of coastal dry forest.\n\nThis post and the next will take a closer look at one of the “West Coast” climate journeys I mapped in the last post—along the Pacific coast of South America. I’m choosing this one because 1) it incorporates the full range of climates/biomes without large intervening bodies of water, 2) it’s one of the world’s most dramatic in terms of its contrasts, and 3) I’ve been able to travel, relatively continuously, a large part of it during a period when this topic was at the front of my mind.\n\nBefore I get into this example I’ll mention why I’m not focusing on any North American ones, which #1 (mostly) applies to and which are relatively straightforward to travel. The reason is that despite their accessibility #3 doesn’t apply. I have visited many places along both coasts but generally piecemeal, with the exception of a high school family road trip from L.A. to Vancouver when I wasn’t yet obsessed enough with this subject to coax everyone into a string of representative hikes along the drive. And the 2020 coast-to-coast drive I wrote about last year hardly involved leaving the car let alone visiting any quasi-natural areas (which are few-and-far-between in the middle part of the U.S.).\n\nThe progression of climates and biomes along the west coast of South America is the most dramatic in the world thanks especially to the extreme dryness of the Atacama and Peruvian deserts—in the driest part, around Antofagasta in northern Chile, it basically doesn’t rain—and their latitudinal extent. Both of those aspects result from overlapping conditions that would each likely produce a desert on its own.\n\nFirst, at those desert latitudes, the Andes form a high and continuous wall and the prevailing winds are from the east, creating an especially strong rain shadow effect. Second, the subtropical high-pressure zone typically centered around 30 degrees has its usual drying effect, except that for complicated reasons again having to do with the Andes it’s more stable and extends farther north than along other west coasts. And finally, and probably most importantly, the cold Humboldt/Peru Current cools and dries the air all the way to Ecuador where the coastline starts to bend eastward away from the current. (Once again I’m drawing on my new favorite book, Trewartha’s The Earth’s Problem Climates, for most of this background.)\n\nThe absolute dryness of those deserts of course produces a heightened contrast with the wet climates to the north and south. But the northward extension of the dry zone (mostly due to the cold current) also means that on the northern side that contrast is compressed, so that the coastline between Southern Ecuador and central Colombia features the world’s sharpest rainfall gradient at sea level. You can see that to a degree in the maps above but I think it’s complex and interesting enough to deserve its own post—stay tuned for that.\n\nIn this post I’ll focus on the southern part of the pattern, from the Atacama Desert on the Peru-Chile border south to the temperate rainforests of Chiloé Island and the Carretera Austral (Chile’s southernmost coastal “highway”) in northern Patagonia. To go all the way to the southern tip of the continent by road would’ve required driving into Argentina, through higher and drier landscapes, in order to bypass the rugged intervening coastline. (Someday, though, it would still be nice to make a separate visit to that extreme.)\n\nI made the 3700 km./2300 mi. journey (in fall 2019) by a combination of bus, car and ferry, with the exception of one air travel segment. My goal was to experience and photograph enough reasonably intact landscapes, at roughly even intervals along the route, to later be able to create either 1) a photographic transect of the gradient with only slight variation from one image to the next or 2) one of my fractured watercolor representations.\n\nBut as I mentioned in my “Long Gradients” series of posts, I’ve since realized that the fractured/abstract style doesn’t lend itself well to this scale and “linearity.” And even though I knew that having limited flexibility on the trip (for a few reasons I didn’t want to do the whole thing by rental car) would mean any attempt at the photographic transect would be superficial, it became even clearer that the concept can’t really work without using an interval less than, say, fifty miles. Particularly in such a topographically complicated region, where it’s hard to eliminate local variations to the large-scale climatic patterns without choosing the route very carefully, fewer images means less flattening out of those variations.\n\nFrom Santiago I flew to Temuco, in the northern part of the wet temperate zone, with the closest airport to Villarrica Volcano and other sites in the Lake District. This region is still too far north for rainforest but was shockingly green after I’d spent so much time in the dry half of the country. This seemed to be a good portion of the trip to do by air since nothing between the two cities had jumped out as a must-see, but I immediately regretted that decision after feeling like I’d been dropped onto a different planet. It felt unmooring to a degree that I briefly considered trying to somehow squeeze that 9-hour drive into the last few days of the trip along with the 10-hour drive to and from Fray Jorge. I gave up on that possibility but, learning that there are in fact a few national parks straddling the dry-subtropical/wet-temperate divide within that segment, I decided it would just need to happen on a future trip. (The urge has quieted a bit since then.)\n\nTo fill that missing ecological link in the transect I needed to cheat—by using an image from the wetter, south-facing slopes of La Campana, back near Santiago, which I imagine to be reminiscent of the transitional landscape toward Temuco. (It has more of a Northern California look to it.) So much for the goal of even intervals and minimal topographic influence.\n\nNow I’ll focus on each of the three journey types, where they do occur and where they’d be expected to but don’t. You’ll see that many of my arrows join disconnected pieces of continents like Iceland and the UK, stretching the concept of “journey” a little bit, but that’s partly to emphasize that these patterns tend to be intact even across intervening water. Plus the fact is that, if we’re talking about native ecosystems, these patterns can only be experienced today as archipelagos anyways since those ecosystems have been broken up and mostly replaced by altered landscapes.\n\nMy main source for trying to understand the exceptions to these overall patterns is The Earth’s Problem Climates (by Glenn Trewartha, who also developed this particular climate classification system)—some of you won’t be surprised to hear me say that it’s become one of my favorite books ever. That’s despite that fact that, without a very deep knowledge of climatology or meteorology, it’s hard for me to get more than the overall gist of the explanations. They have a lot to do with seasonal variations in the strength, location, and orientation of winds and currents, adding much more complexity to the overall conditions I wrote about last time, interacting with topography and the shape of coastlines. In fact this complexity means that the primary causes of the anomalies rarely seem to be well understood. So I won’t try to give more than a basic idea of why the three typical patterns don’t always apply. (I still do get into the weeds a bit though, so just stick to the graphics if you’d like to skip the explanations.)\n\nEast Coast\n\nHere’s the world map again showing only the zones making up the “East Coast” pattern/journey type. (From here on I’m going to ignore the Polar Ice Caps, since realistically if you were going to try and travel these routes you’d probably leave those out.)\n\nEarly last year I wrote a series of posts on “long gradients,” inspired by the dry-wet transition on a drive from California to Maine and back; this next series will pick back up on that theme, zooming out to the entire globe.\n\nFirst, a quick recap of the “long gradient” concept. Having grown up in the relatively climatically uniform Midwest I think of these large-scale transitions, extending over many hundreds of miles, as more “typical” than the more rapid and more easily experienced kind generated by topography. My worldviews focus on the latter, “compressed” type, because by definition they’re better at eliciting that “world-at-my-fingertips” feeling that I go on and on about. They also lend themselves better to being captured and accentuated on paper. But the large-scale kind can have a similar impact if you travel them quickly enough. (A car works if you don’t stop very frequently, but for me this would also be a side benefit of having more widespread high-speed rail.) And if you are maximizing speed, in a sense that impact can be even greater than for the small-scale kind because you’re covering a distance that’s still continental or global in scale. Time is being compressed without compressing space.\n\nGlobal Climates: The Typical Pattern\n\nNeedless to say plenty of these long gradients exist across the globe, and they can be grouped into some broad categories based on whether they’re created by variations in temperature, precipitation, or usually some combination of both. But they can also be broken down further, and classified, into particular patterns that repeat across the different continents. It’s probably somewhat common knowledge that the same types of climates can be found in multiple places around the world—e.g. “Mediterranean” climates aren’t just found around the Mediterranean, and tropical rainforest climates are found in multiple places along the equator. But that also holds true for groupings or progressions of climate types, beyond the obvious transition from polar to tropical. You can start to see these patterns in the climatic map below, of a generic “continent” spanning both hemispheres. (I’ve chosen the colors to reflect degree of similarity.)\n\n(This post will stay on this generic global level. It does get into the weeds a bit, but as a framework for looking at the specific places I’ll get into later on, the main points should be enough.)\n\nNow, to the Galápagos—specifically Plaza Sur (or South Plaza), an island I haven’t mentioned in my previous posts on the archipelago. This one is tiny and low, covering only about 0.1 square kilometer, so there’s no wet highland zone as with the others I’ve described. In this case the “edge” that drew me in was simply the edge of the island itself—that is, the “compressed” aspect of the place that I wanted to accentuate was the smallness of the landmass rather than a sense of downsized ecological/meteorological patterns. That it felt like its own miniature world, then, didn’t have anything to do with the “island-continent” phenomenon that I’d apply to the larger, ecologically diverse islands in the Galápagos (though that phenomenon is best and most commonly associated with the Big Island of Hawaii, with tropical and alpine in addition to wet and dry).\n\nThe miniature-world quality did, though, have something to do with the prominent animal life, maybe because it makes the environment seem more multi-dimensional and “complete” in its own way. Of course the Galápagos is most famous for its fauna, but as you know it’s the flora that usually catches my attention instead. (I sometimes jokingly refer to animals as “mobile life forms”—for some reason things that stay put, with the passage of time a less central or perceptible factor, are much more interesting to me. I pay more attention to fauna on the level of biogeography, since ranges of animal species are a lot more stationary than individuals. It might be analogous to my interest in buildings but not—in the least!—cars.) On Plaza Sur, though, the wildlife somehow comes across as a particularly integral fixture of the landscape. Maybe the animals seem to stand out more, or seem more confined and stationary (I said “fixture” on purpose), because of the smallness and sparseness of their surroundings. (Of course most of them move around quite a bit, including between islands, but my outlook is one of distilling and idealizing.) This greater-than-usual prominence of animals in my particular experience of the island is captured in Habitat, the first watercolor where I’ve incorporated them; the title itself reflects that greater inclusivity.\n\nIn Sanctuary, which I painted during the residency and assembled back at home (it was my one and only experiment with literally collaging the fragments together, i.e. cutting and pasting), the place is heavily idealized. To accentuate the sense of “smallness,” boundedness, and fragility, I converted the park from an ecological island to an actual island. Plus, I completely invented the landscape in the lower right (representing Trousers Point), wishing there had been grass trees in that particular spot.\n\nIn the four years since, the worldviews have become a lot more reality-based—they’re still obviously abstract, but I’ve generally tried to keep the spatial relationships between the fragments relatively true-to-life. That goes along with my recent emphasis on depicting “journeys” from one view to the next that reflect my actual experiences traveling through these places. My reasons for the shift are two-fold. First, fitting my personal, idealized experience of a place into real-world geography is a more interesting challenge than being free to invent that geography from scratch—similar to the advantage of designing with site constraints versus a blank slate in a landscape architecture project. And second, as my purpose has become more conservation-driven, I’ve wanted to highlight the threat to real places rather than take a more escapist approach creating the impression that we’ve already lost them.\n\nSo I created the new work, Sanctuary II, to try my hand at keeping the real geography of the place relatively intact while at the same time 1) emphasizing the pieces that were most prominent in my own experience and 2) accentuating the internal contrasts between the park’s varied environments as well as the external contrasts between between the park as a whole and the adjacent heavily altered landscapes (i.e. its nature as an ecological island). That was definitely a challenge because, as shown in the diagram below, there’s a great deal that I wanted to include—along three different “journeys.” There are a lot of landscapes that I couldn’t fit in without making the composition too busy, and as I hope you can tell, it was hard to choose! But another reason for wanting to take a second look at the place was that I’ve gotten a lot more comfortable with working large. Almost everything I’ve produced during the past two years or so is 36” or more on one side (easy with oils, much more daunting and logistically complicated with watercolor). That means I can incorporate many more fragments while maintaining or even increasing the level of detail in each.\n\nLike all of the worldviews with a conservation message, Sanctuary II combines that message with the seemingly contradictory purpose of heightening the empowering, “world-at-my-fingertips” feeling I get from these sharp contrasts within and around natural environments. As I’ve explained before, that contradiction is resolved if I consider these dual motivations to be two aspects of a protective impulse. I’ve recently been thinking about that control-as-protection as a kind of “embrace.” In my caption for this work as it’ll appear in the Proceedings of the International Cartographic Association I describe it this way:\n\nTaking in the specialness of the place—so close to and yet so far from civilization—and of its many facets gave me the feeling of physically embracing the landscape. That sensation came equally from the knowledge that this small, intricate collection of ecosystems will not easily survive the effects of fire, invasive species, and a warming and drying climate.\n\nSo this and most of my other recent worldviews have been more involved and, as interpretations rather than re-imaginations of physical places and experiences, more focused on analysis, precision, and problem-solving than earlier works have been. This new emphasis has been a way for me to re-engage myself in some of what I miss from design practice and, frankly, school. I’m hoping future projects will take me even further (back) in that direction.\n\nDarren\n\nWith an end-of-September deadline to pre-record my “Musical Space, Geographical Time” talk for October’s NACIS meeting (they’re requiring pre-recording for anyone considering presenting remotely), my musical mapping experiments with The Last Island are winding down. So this should be either the last or second-to-last post dealing with the topic (maybe to your relief)—soon I’ll be back to focusing on geographical journeys in paint and real-life.\n\nThe three following musical elements—key brightness, relative key (i.e. key variability), and relative “height” (i.e. “height” variability)—all have to do with the concept of \"key.” (Relative “height” incorporates other characteristics too, as I’ll say more about below, but key is an important component.) I’ve been going back-and-forth on whether these three aspects of key are actually distinct or “real,” not just for listeners in general vs. myself but even to my own ears. And I’m not sure that’s even resolvable. So the point of mapping and describing them separately is largely to raise that very question. As usual I’m always anxious to hear your thoughts!\n\nI think of these three elements as related in that they, like “key” in general, are “holistic” or “emergent” characteristics of music. They tend to be properties of the entire score rather than individual voices, and tend to be established over extended lengths of time rather than a few beats or bars. There are exceptions to both of these tendencies: in theory a set of voices can play in one key while another set plays in another, following multiple “paths” (this is something I do play with in The Last Island, see below); and it’s possible for key or “height” to be defined over just a beat or two depending on context. But these elements generally aren’t systematically quantifiable voice-by-voice or bar-by-bar as other elements are.\n\nKey Brightness\n\nDo certain keys sound “brighter” that others? Doing some research would probably clear the question up further, but based on personal experience and informal conversations it seems to be the case. It’s probably more perceptible to certain ears than others (my having near-perfect pitch—though somehow over the past few years consistently a half-step off—is a likely factor), and which keys sound brighter or darker to those ears probably doesn’t follow a consistent pattern. I think it’s fair to say that to pretty much everyone all the time, major keys sound brighter than minor keys. But that’s a function of intervals rather than some hard-to-define characteristic of absolute pitch. While I tend to hear keys with lots of sharps/flats as darker, that could be a subconscious association with black keys on the piano, and it doesn’t always hold true.\n\nSo my process of selecting bright vs. dark keys in writing The Last Island, or evaluating it later in places where there was less intent involved, was based mostly on gut impressions. Later I tried to fit them into a quasi-scientific system; looking back at my cryptic notes (below) I’m having trouble figuring out exactly how I went about it. But a system did come together, relating to number of accidentals as I mentioned above.\n\nThe takeaway from the key brightness map (the central black-and-white band on the sheet of parallel maps above), in terms of how it corresponds with the geographical elements it’s meant to evoke, isn’t as straightforward as with other musical elements that I’ve shared before (like attack and instrumentation). Those other elements show an overall intensification building up to and then down from the musical/geographical “climax” point. But I think what does come across in this one is darker keys corresponding to 1) darker forested landscapes in the middle third of the piece and 2) the ominous mood at the very end as deforested landscapes “appear,” in both the slides and the music, in the distance. (That location in the distance explains the hatched dark-and-light zones at the tail end. Certain voices play in a dark key depicting that distant but encroaching destruction, while the rest play in a brighter key to represent the for-now-preserved foreground.)\n\nRelative Key\n\nI’ve been thinking about key brightness as an “absolute” quality—you can sense how bright or dark a key is even if you hear it in isolation. But with relative key (above/to the right of brightness on the sheet), the relativity is the point—what matters is key changes, or key variability, not characteristics of the individual keys. (For the mathematically-minded among you, taking this a step further would mean drawing a map of the derivative of the key, rather than the keys themselves as I've done above.)\n\nSo in this case I’ve represented the different keys as colors along the rainbow spectrum rather than on a greyscale. Similar keys, like C major and G major or C major and A minor, are denoted by similar colors so that the more dramatic the key change, the sharper the color contrast. A greyscale would’ve shown those contrasts too, but each shade of grey by itself would’ve suggested an “absolute,” intrinsic level of something, whether that’s brightness or some other quality. Color indication, however, seems appropriately arbitrary (though, having synesthesia, now that I think about it these colors could in fact represent some absolute quality of each key—maybe a future map?). Plus, key changes are fundamentally changes in musical “color” that outweigh the probably less perceptible changes in brightness. Having said all this though, I’m not totally sure that what I’m perceiving as a “color” change isn’t actually a “brightness” change. Again, I’m not even sure that’s answerable, for my own ears let alone everyone else’s. Think of these as possible ways of experiencing key, whether or not they’re actually distinct.\n\nI wrote key changes into The Last Island to evoke a combination of things: 1) shifts in scenery or atmosphere (overlaid with considerations of brightness as described above), 2) physical exertion/movement of the traveler/listener, and 3) the complexity or “energy” of a particular scene. The zone of rapid key changes around the climax point represents a mix of all three of these. Overall, more and sharper changes in key/color mean a heightening of sensation, which like in the earlier maps tends to correlate with a cumulative intensification of the physical environment. (I don’t claim any originality in using this technique—you’re probably familiar with what’s been disparagingly called the “truck driver’s gear-shift” in pop music, where half- or whole-step key changes are inserted to heighten emotion. I did try to be more subtle than that in most cases.)\n\nBack to the question of representation—using the rainbow gradient, as opposed to another type of color gradient, has some issues. Not all segments of it (say, yellow vs. blue) are of equal “strength” to the eye, and so contrasts between those sections aren’t either. It follows that in the map, the apparent degree of contrast between different keys likely doesn’t quite correspond with reality (if there is a reality to all of this to begin with). So I’ve made a version using a smaller segment of the rainbow spectrum—red to yellow—which doesn’t eliminate the strength disparities but might at least limit the range of contrasts that could be misleading. The two versions are lined up below.\n\nRelative “Height”\n\nI mentioned that I used key changes to represent physical movement/exertion—that usually means climbing uphill (I’m thinking this imaginary island rises to at least 10,000 ft.). But the sensation of elevation change in the piece isn’t just a matter of key change; it’s combined with rising or falling melodic lines as well as harmonic changes that don’t necessarily represent key changes. (The combination of those elements also indicates “height” in a broader sense than geographical elevation, incorporating emotional as well as elevational “heightening.”) Because of that mix, composing and then mapping changes in “height” is largely intuitive and I’m not even positive that it’s a real thing at all (the reason I’ve put it in quotes). And again, there is a question of whether the” key” component can really be separated from the two other key-related elements. But for experimenting/mapping purposes I’m doing it for now.\n\nThe obvious way to map “height” is with a rising/falling line, and that’s what I did at first (turned into the “section-cut” drawing below). But that’s different from all the other maps, which use a color gradient or a greyscale to measure different intensities or levels, including even the geographical elevation map. Though geographical elevation change is a form of spatial variation, the whole concept of musical mapping deals with 2-D/horizontal space. The “vertical” dimension of music that I described with the 3D model in my first music-related post is a function of the stacking, layering, and simultaneity that music allows; it doesn’t represent vertical position in physical space. So except where I’ve wanted to break elements into the different musical voices or instruments (as in previous posts), these maps of musical elements are meant to represent views from “overhead” rather than “from the side.”"
