The author inquires some rock art sites that are a distinguishing trait of Canary Islands and had a deep significance for the natives: lithophones. They are volcanic rock formations endowed with a special sonority, similar to that of a bell, when struck with a stone or another object. Thanks to the natural acoustics of the landscape where they are located, the sound can be heard at considerable distances. The lithophones had a social and cultural solid place in the Canary native world. They offered rhythmic or a-rhythmic sound production within the proscenium for sacred acts exploiting the magic-religious power associated to chthonic female divinities. Lithophones were struck rhythmically also to support dances and make musical competition during social events (thanksgivings and royal consecrations). Other lithophonic structures within commanding view and acoustically reinforced setting had a different vocation, serving mainly to warn inhabitants of external threats and aggressions. Canary Archipelago possesses two atout for our chances to understand the aboriginal exploitation of rock art sites for music-making: the frequent coexistence of lithophones with inscriptions in Libyco-Berber script and the presence of a collective oral memory passed from generation to generation since the ancestral time despite the European ‘civilization’.\n\nThe Guanches, Paleo-Berbers that settled in the Canary Islands before the Spanish colonization, had rich cultural traditions.

Para ello, se parte del corpus epigráfico herreño y se compara con el conjunto continental. A través de este estudio, se constata la presencia de múltiples morfemas del líbico de Numidia en las inscripciones herreñas. A su vez, se detectan rasgos lingüísticos de los dialectos bereberes meridionales, confirmándose el vínculo del alfabeto canario con la variedad presahariana, descendiente del líbico oficial númida. Finalmente, se advierten diferencias ortográficas entre el norte y el sur de la Isla que podrían reflejar variedades diatópicas, diacrónicas y diastráticas. / This study aims to transcribe the Canarian inscriptions from El Hierro island through the Libyco-Berber morpho-phonological analysis view. Our analysis revealed the presence of many morphemes from the Numidian inscriptions (oldest Libyco-Berber alphabet) in El Hierro. Also, islander inscriptions exhibited linguistic features of the Southern Berber dialects, that confirmed the link between Canarian and pre-Saharan alphabets. Finally, our epigraphic analysis showed differences between the north and south of El Hierro. This orthographic disparity could reveal diatopic, diachronic and socio-cultural varieties.\n\nExponemos y analizamos las dataciones absolutas y relativas de los alfabetos líbico-bereberes, así como tres hipótesis sobre su origen: dos principales y una polémica tercera que, además, alude al poblamiento de las Islas Canarias. Veremos que las dataciones precisas son escasas y se circunscriben a los territorios septentrionales de Túnez y Argelia. Varias evidencias, entre ellas su alta densidad de inscripciones y su cercanía a Cartago, parecen indicar que los antiguos libios crearon esta escritura a partir de la infuencia alfabética fenicia. The absolute and relative datings of the Libyco-Berber script are exposed and analyzed. Three hypotheses about its origin are discussed here: two main ones and a polemic third theory that mentions the Canary Islands’ settlement. As it will be shown, the accurate datings are few and are confined to the northern Tunisian and Algerian territory. Several evidences, as its high epigraphic density and its proximity to Cartago, would show that ancient Libyans created this scripture basing on the Phoenician alphabet."
