        "text": "Santa Maria Volcano, Guatemala\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe eruption of Santa Maria volcano in 1902 was one of the largest eruptions of the 20th century, forming a large crater on the mountain's southwest flank. Since 1922, a lava-dome complex, Santiaguito, has been forming in the 1902 crater. Growth of the dome has produced pyroclastic flows as recently as the 2001-they can be identified in this image. The city of Quezaltenango (approximately 90,000 people in 1989) sits below the 3772 m summit. The volcano is considered dangerous because of the possibility of a dome collapse such as one that occurred in 1929, which killed about 5000 people. A second hazard results from the flow of volcanic debris into rivers south of Santiaguito, which can lead to catastrophic flooding and mud flows. More information on this volcano can be found at web sites maintained by the Smithsonian Institution, Volcano World, and Michigan Tech University. ISS004-ESC-7999 was taken 17 February 2002 from the International Space Station using a digital camera. The image is provided by the Earth Sciences and Image Analysis Laboratory at Johnson Space Center. Searching and viewing of additional images taken by astronauts and cosmonauts is available at the NASA-JSC Gateway to\n\nEmergence and evolution of Santa Maria Island (Azores)âThe conundrum of uplifted islands revisited\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nRamalho, Ricardo; Helffrich, George; Madeira, Jose; Cosca, Michael A.; Thomas, Christine; Quartau, Rui; Hipolito, Ana; Rovere, Alessio; Hearty, Paul; Avila, Sergio\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe growth and decay of ocean-island volcanoes are intrinsically linked to vertical movements. While the causes for subsidence are better understood, uplift mechanisms remain enigmatic. Santa Maria Island in the Azores Archipelago is an ocean-island volcano resting on top of young lithosphere, barely 480 km away from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Like most other Azorean islands, Santa Maria should be experiencing subsidence. Yet, several features indicate an uplift trend instead. In this paper, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of Santa Maria with respect to the timing and magnitude of its vertical movements, using detailed field work and 40Ar/39Ar geochronology. Our investigations revealed a complex evolutionary history spanning â¼6 m.y., with subsidence up to ca. 3.5 Ma followed by uplift extending to the present day. The fact that an island located in young lithosphere experienced a pronounced uplift trend is remarkable and raises important questions concerning possible uplift mechanisms. Localized uplift in response to the tectonic regime affecting the southeastern tip of the Azores Plateau is unlikely, since the area is under transtension. Our analysis shows that the only viable mechanism able to explain the uplift is crustal thickening by basal intrusions, suggesting that intrusive processes play a significant role even on islands standing on young lithosphere, such as in the Azores.\n\nSeismic-reflection studies, offshore Santa Maria Province, California\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBird, K.J.; Childs, J.R.; Taylor, D.J.\n\n1991-02-01\n\nWell data and seismic-reflection records are being analyzed to provide a subsurface geologic framework for the US Geological Survey's Santa Maria Province project. This project, jointly sponsored by the Evolution of Sedimentary Basins and Onshore Oil and Gas Investigations Programs, in a basin-evolution and petroleum geology study focusing on the geologically complex and tectonically active south-central California margin. The area embraces several basins and basin fragments including the onshore Santa Maria, offshore Santa Maria, Pismo, Huasna, Sur, Santa Lucia, and western Santa Barbara-Ventura. These basins have many similarities, including generally synchronous formation at about the end of the Oligocene, developmentmoreÂ Â» on a complex assemblage of Mesozoic tectonostratigraphic terranes, and basin fill consisting of Neogene clastic marine and nonmarine deposits, minor volcanic rocks, and organic-rich biogenous deposits of the Monterey Formation. Despite these similarities, basin origins are controversial and paleogeographies uncertain. In 1990, the US Geological Survey collected approximately 130 line-mi of multichannel seismic reflection data in seven profiles off-shore California from Morro Bay south to the western Santa Barbara Channel. These are the first US Geological Survey seismic data collected in this area since the early 1980s exploratory drilling began in the offshore Santa Maria basin. Profiles were generally oriented perpendicular to structural grain and located to intersect as many well-sites and pre-existing seismic profiles as possible. Profile orientation and spacing were designed to provide the offshore extensions of onshore well-correlation profiles currently under construction. With synthetic seismograms the authors are integrating the stratigraphy of the wells with these seismic-reflection records.Â«Â less\n\nQuantifying Late Quaternary Deformation along the Santa Ynez River, Santa Maria Basin, California\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSlatten, C. L.; Onderdonk, N.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe fault bounded Santa Maria Basin, located on the Central Coast of California, is positioned in an area of convergence between the rotating Western Transverse Ranges and the non-rotated Southern Coast Ranges. The Santa Ynez River Fault (SYRF) is an east-west trending fault that parallels the Santa Ynez River west of Lake Cachuma, California and defines the southern structural boundary of the Santa Maria Basin. However, the rate and style of Late Quaternary deformation and uplift in this region and the potential for seismic hazard along the fault is lacking. Fluvial terraces are key geomorphological components of fluvial systems that can be used to provide insights into regional and local uplift and deformation. The Santa Ynez River delineates the northern edge of the Santa Ynez Mountains and flows west through the Santa Ynez Valley to its mouth at the Pacific Ocean. The Santa Ynez River Field Area is a 10 km stretch of the Santa Ynez River just west of Lake Cachuma where terraces are well developed and the SYRF cuts through terraces and the active river (Figure 1). If there has been Quaternary movement of the SYRF we expect to find deformation in these areas. An initial survey of the area identified five terrace levels ranging from 8 m to 135 m above modern river level. The fluvial terraces are being mapped as separate units, surveyed for deformation with GPS based transects, and sampled for optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. These combined methods will allow us to document the geomorphic characteristics and landform evolution of the lower Santa Ynez River, evaluate the possibility of Late Quaternary activity of the SYRF, and determine the rate of Late Quaternary regional uplift along the western Santa Ynez River in the Santa Maria Basin providing a possible basis for augmentation of the seismic hazards for Santa Barbara County.\n\nColor Panorama of Santa Maria Crater for Opportunity Anniversary\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2011-01-20\n\nNASA Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity is spending the seventh anniversary of its landing on Mars investigating a crater called Santa Maria, which has a diameter about the length of a football field.

As the ophiolite rocks moved relatively away from the spreading center, they were covered by Lower Jurassic through Lower Cretaceous basin plain and prograding outer continental margin deposits. During this time, right-lateral movement along faults that were located to the east was transporting the area relatively northward toward its present location.moreÂ Â» A mild tectonic event in the middle of the Cretaceous caused formation of a parallel unconformity. Renewed subsidence in the Late Cretaceous brought deposition in trench, slope, sandy submarine fan, shelf, and ultimately in the eastern part of the area, delta and fluvial environments. During the ensuing Laramide orogeny, significant deformation raised the entire area above sea level and erosion created a major angular unconformity. During the early Tertiary, most of the Santa Maria basin area remained elevated as a forearc highland. The present-day east-west-trending area south of the Santa Ynez River fault was at the time oriented north-south. During the Eocene, this portion of the area was submerged and became a forearc basin that was located to the east of the forearc ridge that served as a source of sediment. The basin filled through the Eocene and Oligocene with submarine fan, sloe, shelf, coastal, and finally fluvial deposits. In the medial Miocene, these forearc basin rocks were rotated clockwise into their present position along the southern margin of the basin and the upper Tertiary Santa maria basin was formed.Â«Â less\n\nGeohistory analysis of the Santa Maria basin, California, and its relationship to tectonic evolution of the continental margin\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMcCrory, P.A.; Arends, R.G.; Ingle, J.C. Jr.\n\n1991-02-01\n\nThe Santa Maria basin of central California is a geologically complex area located along the tectonically active California continental margin. The record of Cenozoic tectonism preserved in Santa Maria strata provides an opportunity to compare the evolution of the region with plate tectonic models for Cenozoic interactions along the margin. Geohistory analysis of Neogene Santa Maria basin strata provides important constraints for hypotheses of the tectonic evolution of the central California margin during its transition from a convergent to a transform plate boundary. Preliminary analyses suggest that the tectonic evolution of the Santa Maria area was dominated by coupling betweenmoreÂ Â» adjacent oceanic plates and the continental margin. This coupling is reflected in the timing of major hiatuses within the basin sedimentary sequence and margin subsidence and uplift which occurred during periods of tectonic plate adjustment. Stratigraphic evidence indicates that the Santa Maria basin originated on the continental shelf in early Miocene time. A component of margin subsidence is postulated to have been caused by cessation of spreading on adjacent offshore microplates approximately 19-18 ma. A sharp reduction in rate of tectonic subsidence in middle Miocene time, observed in the Santa Maria basin both onshore and offshore, was coeval with rotation of crustal blocks as major shearing shifts shoreward. Tectonic uplift of two eastern sites, offshore Point Arguello and near Point Sal, in the late Miocene may have been related to a change to transpressional motion between the Pacific and North American plates, as well as to rotation of the western Transverse Ranges in a restraining geometry.Â«Â less\n\nFrequency of suspected cases of neurocysticercosis detected by computed skull tomography in Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nSilva, J E; DiefenthÃ¤ler, A P; Palma, J K\n\n2000-01-01\n\nDue to the lack of studies about neurocysticercosis in the South of Brazil, an investigation was conducted to determine the percentage of suspected cases of neurocysticercosis in computed tomography diagnoses in Santa Maria, RS, from January 1997 to December 1998. Of 6300 computed tomographies (CT) of the skull performed at the private Hospital de Caridade Astrogildo de Azevedo, 80, i.e., 1.27% were suspected of neurocysticercosis. Fifty were women (62.5%) and 30 were men (37.5%). The most frequent radiological manifestation indicating neurocysticercosis was the presence of calcifications (isolated or associated), with a 95% rate (76 cases), while the presence of hypodense lesions reached a 5% rate (4 cases). After routine analysis, each CT was evaluated again and the suspected cases were confirmed. The percentage of suspected cases of neurocysticercosis detected by CT in the present study carried out in Santa Maria was considered low (1.27%). This can be explained by the fact that tomography is not accessible to the economically underprivileged population of Santa Maria. We hope that the present study can alert the population and the professionals to the fact that neurocysticercosis is a more frequent disease than indicated by the few diagnoses made.\n\n75 FR 9827 - Proposed Expansion of the Santa Maria Valley Viticultural Area (2008R-287P)\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-03-04\n\n... 105(e) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act), 27 U.S.C. 205(e), authorizes the Secretary...

Monthly data of physical-chemical variables and phytoplankton from November 2004 to February 2006 were used to define the actual trophic state of the lagoons by means of a trophic index (TRIX), and its imprint on the Morphological Phytoplankton Groups. From the analysis of data distinctive responses were observed for each lagoon. Trophic state and phytoplankton dynamic apparently were determinate by differences in hydrodynamics in each lagoon. Santa Maria lagoon showed higher trophic index values followed by Ohuira and Topolobampo. The phytoplankton community dominated for nannophytoplankton was regulated by nitrogen along the year in the entire lagoon system. However, the relationship between phytoplankton and physical-chemical variables examined by multivariate analysis indicated that in Santa Maria, nutrients from the runoff of fertilizers at the beginning of the fall/winter agriculture cycle influenced the occurrence of diatoms Harmful Algae Blooms (HABs), while in Ohuira higher water residence times have major regulatory effects on a large number of HABs of cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates and a lower Trophic state. A minor grade of affectation in Topolobampo lagoon is suggested by a dominance of the seasonality, a lower water residence times, and non HABs incidence during the period of this study.\n\nGeology of the undeveloped oil and gas fields of Central Offshore Santa Maria Basin, California\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMilton, J.D.; Edwards, E.B.; Heck, R.G.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nTwo prominent subsurface structural features of the Central Offshore Santa Maria Basin are the Hosgri fault system and the associated anticlinal fold trend. Exploratory drilling and 3D seismic mapping have delineated a series of oil and gas fields along this trend which underlie four federal units and one non-unitized lease. The units are named after local geography and are called the Lion Rock, Point Sal, Purisima Point and Santa Maria Units. The individual lease, OCS P-0409, overlies the San Miguel field. The Hosgri fault system trends northwest-southeast and effectively forms the eastern boundary of the oil and gas province.

The Monterey is both source and reservoir rock, averaging 300 meters n thickness throughout the Central Basin. Development of the Monterey Formation as a reservoir rock was through diagensis and tectonism with resulting porosities-from 15 to 20% and permeability up to one Darcy. These parameters coupled with a high geothermal gradient facilitate the inflow rates of the viscous Monterey oil. Some 24 exploration and delineation wells have been drilled in this area and tested at rates ranging from a few hundred to several thousand barrels per day. Estimated oil reserves in the Central Offshore Santa Maria Basin total approximately 1 billion barrels.Â«Â less\n\nGeology of the undeveloped oil and gas fields of Central Offshore Santa Maria Basin, California\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMilton, J.D.; Edwards, E.B.; Heck, R.G.\n\n1996-12-31\n\nTwo prominent subsurface structural features of the Central Offshore Santa Maria Basin are the Hosgri fault system and the associated anticlinal fold trend.

Richard; Rietman, Jan D.; Heck, Ronald G.; Lettis, William R.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Hosgri Fault Zone trends subparallel to the south-central California coast for 110 km from north of Point Estero to south of Purisima Point and forms the eastern margin of the present offshore Santa Maria Basin. Knowledge of the attributes of the Hosgri Fault Zone is important for petroleum development, seismic engineering, and environmental planning in the region. Because it lies offshore along its entire reach, our characterizations of the Hosgri Fault Zone and adjacent structures are primarily based on the analysis of over 10,000 km of common-depth-point marine seismic reflection data collected from a 5,000-km2 area of the central and eastern parts of the offshore Santa Maria Basin. We describe and illustrate the along-strike and downdip geometry of the Hosgri Fault Zone over its entire length and provide examples of interpreted seismic reflection records and a map of the structural trends of the fault zone and adjacent structures in the eastern offshore Santa Maria Basin. The seismic data are integrated with offshore well and seafloor geologic data to describe the age and seismic appearance of offshore geologic units and marker horizons. We develop a basin-wide seismic velocity model for depth conversions and map three major unconformities along the eastern offshore Santa Maria Basin. Accompanying plates include maps that are also presented as figures in the report. Appendix A provides microfossil data from selected wells and appendix B includes uninterpreted copies of the annotated seismic record sections illustrated in the chapter. Features of the Hosgri Fault Zone documented in this investigation are suggestive of both lateral and reverse slip. Characteristics indicative of lateral slip include (1) the linear to curvilinear character of the mapped trace of the fault zone, (2) changes in structural trend along and across the fault zone that diminish in magnitude toward the ends of the fault zone, (3) localized compressional and extensional structures\n\nWorkshops on Volcanoes at Santiaguito (Guatemala): A community effort to inform and highlight the outstanding science opportunities at an exceptional laboratory volcano\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJohnson, J. B.; Escobar-Wolf, R. P.; Pineda, A.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nSantiaguito is one of Earth's most reliable volcanic spectacles and affords opportunity to investigate dome volcanism, including hourly explosions, pyroclastic flows, block lava flows, and sporadic paroxysmal eruptions. The cubic km dome, active since 1922, comprises four coalescing structures. Lava effusion and explosions are ideally observed from a birds-eye perspective at the summit of Santa Maria volcano (1200 m above and 2700 km from the active Caliente vent). Santiaguito is also unstable and dangerous. Thousands of people in farms and local communities are exposed to hazards from frequent lahars, pyroclastic flows, and potentially large sector-style dome collapses. In January 2016 more than 60 volcano scientists, students, postdocs, and observatory professionals traveled to Santiaguito to participate in field study and discussion about the science and hazards of Santiaguito. The event facilitated pre- and syn-workshop field experiments, including deployment of seismic, deformation, infrasound, multi-spectral gas and thermal sensing, UAV reconnaissance, photogrammetry, and petrologic and rheologic sampling. More than 55 participants spent the night on the 3770-m summit of Santa Maria to partake in field observations. The majority of participants also visited lahar and pyroclastic flow-impacted regions south of the volcano. A goal of the workshop was to demonstrate how multi-disciplinary observations are critical to elucidate volcano eruption dynamics. Integration of geophysical and geochemical observation, and open exchange of technological advances, is vital to achieve the next generation of volcano discovery. Toward this end data collected during the workshop are openly shared within the broader volcanological community. Another objective of the workshop was to bring attention to an especially hazardous and little-studied volcanic system. The majority of workshop attendees had not visited the region and their participation was hoped to seed future\n\nThe Book of the Sick of Santa Maria della Morte in Bologna and the Medical Organization of a Hospital in the Sixteenth-Century.\n\nPubMed\n\nSavoia, Paolo\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn 2012 a manuscript was rediscovered in the Biblioteca dell'Archiginnasio of Bologna, titled Libro degli infermi dell'Arciconfraternita di S. Maria della Morte. It is the record of incoming patients of one for the main hospitals of the city, devoted exclusively to the sick poor and not just to the poor, called Santa Maria della Morte, compiled by a young student assistant (astante) for the period 1558-1564. I publish here a transcription of a portion of this Libro pertaining to the year 1560. My introduction situates the manuscript within the context of the history of early modern Italian hospitals, describes the organization of the hospital of Santa Maria della Morte based on archival sources of the period, and finally highlights the connections between surgical and anatomical education and the internal organization of the hospital.\n\nMass-casualty Response to the Kiss Nightclub in Santa Maria, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nDal Ponte, Silvana T; Dornelles, Carlos F D; Arquilla, Bonnie; Bloem, Christina; Roblin, Patricia\n\n2015-02-01\n\nOn January 27, 2013, a fire at the Kiss Nightclub in Santa Maria, Brazil led to a mass-casualty incident affecting hundreds of college students. A total of 234 people died on scene, 145 were hospitalized, and another 623 people received treatment throughout the first week following the incident.1 Eight of the hospitalized people later died.1 The Military Police were the first on scene, followed by the state fire department, and then the municipal Mobile Prehospital Assistance (SAMU) ambulances. The number of victims was not communicated clearly to the various units arriving on scene, leading to insufficient rescue personnel and equipment. Incident command was established on scene, but the rescuers and police were still unable to control the chaos of multiple bystanders attempting to assist in the rescue efforts. The Municipal Sports Center (CDM) was designated as the location for dead bodies, where victim identification and communication with families occurred, as well as forensic evaluation, which determined the primary cause of death to be asphyxia. A command center was established at the Hospital de Caridade Astrogildo de Azevedo (HCAA) in Santa Maria to direct where patients should be admitted, recruit staff, and procure additional supplies, as needed. The victims suffered primarily from smoke inhalation and many required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. There was a shortage of ventilators; therefore, some had to be borrowed from local hospitals, neighboring cities, and distant areas in the state. A total of 54 patients1 were transferred to hospitals in the capital city of Porto Alegre (Brazil). The main issues with the response to the fire were scene control and communication. Areas for improvement were identified, namely the establishment of a disaster-response plan, as well as regularly scheduled training in disaster preparedness/response. These activities are the first steps to improving mass-casualty responses.\n\nFirst record of Ginkgo-related fertile organs (Hamshawvia, Stachyopitys) and leaves (Baiera, Sphenobaiera) in the Triassic of Brazil, Santa Maria formation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarboni, Ronaldo; Dutra, TÃ¢nia Lindner\n\n2015-11-01\n\nThis paper describes new ginkgophytes recently discovered in a new exposure of the original type section of the Passo das Tropas Member, Santa Maria Formation, linked to ParanÃ¡ Basin succession. The well-preserved fossils come from a very fine red laminated mudstone representing a lacustrine interval, within a broader low-sinuosity fluvial succession. The material occurs in a Dicroidium-dominated assemblage and is represented by the leaves Baiera and Sphenobaiera, accompanied by the fertile structures Hamshawvia and Stachyopytis. Cuticle fragments preserved on leaf impressions of Sphenobaiera schenkii show xeromorphic features. The geology, paleogeography and paleoclimate of the Passo das Tropas Member (PTM), Santa Maria Formation, is discussed. By comparing these ginkgophytes with those from other Gondwanan assemblages, the Brazilian deposits earlier assigned to Anisian-Ladinian age can now be extended to the Carnian age.\n\nPreliminary Paleomagnetic Data From Santa MariÃ¡ Volcano, Guatemala and Their Bearing on the Mono Lake and Hilina Pali Excursions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEscobar Wolf, R. P.; Diehl, J. F.; Rose, W. I.; Singer, B. S.\n\n2005-12-01\n\nPaleomagnetic directions determined from oriented block samples collected by Rose et al. in 1977 ( Journal of Geology) and from eight paleomagnetic sites drilled in lava flows from Santa Maria volcano, Guatemala in 1990 define a pattern of variation similar to the pattern of geomagnetic field changes recorded by the sediments of the Wilson Creek Formation near Mono Lake, California. This led Conway et al. in 1994 ( Journal of Geology) to suggest that these flows had recorded the Mono Lake Excursion (MLE). The correlation was made on pattern recognition alone and relied almost entirely the well- defined inclination dataset than on the declination data; no radioisotopic ages were available. In March of 2005 we returned to the crater of Santa MariÃ¡ and drilled 23 lava flows from the original sections of Rose et al; block samples for 40Ar/39Ar were also collected. Unfortunately aggradation in the crater due to mass wasting made it impossible to sample all the flows of Rose et al. At each site or lava flow, four to seven cores were drilled and oriented with a sun compass. Samples cut from the drilled cores were magnetically cleaned using alternation field demagnetization and analyzed using principle component analysis. Thermal demagnetization is currently underway. The resulting inclination waveform (over 70Â° of change from +60Â° to -12Â°) is very similar to those previously reported in the literature for the MLE, but the declination waveform shows little variation (<25Â°; mean declination is 13.4Â°) throughout the stratigraphic sequence that we collected. Consequently, VGP data from the lava flows do not show the classic clockwise and counterclockwise loops as seen at the Wilson Creek section and at other MLE locations. Instead the directions (VGPs) tend to cluster in three distinct groups with the lowermost lava flows (5) and uppermost lava flows (3) clustering near the expected axial dipole inclination for the region (~28 Â°) while lava flows from the middle of the\n\nEffemeridi del transito meridiano 2017-2020 per la basilica di Santa Maria degli Angeli in Roma\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSigismondi, Costantino\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe meridian transit time is computed using the ephemerides of IMCCE and the position of the image's center on the 1702 meridian line is corrected for the average atmospheric refraction at the site of Santa Maria degli Angeli, SMA, in Rome.

V.; Martinez-Hackert, B.; Polio, C.; Gutierrez, E.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nSanta Ana (Ilamatepec) Volcano is an active composite volcano located in the Apaneca Volcanic Field located in western part of El Salvador, Central America. The volcano is surrounded by rural communities in its proximal areas and the second (Santa Ana, 13 km) and fourth (Sonsosante, 15 km) largest cities of the country. On October 1st, 2005, the volcano erupted after months of increased activity. Following the eruption, volcanic mitigation projects were conducted in the region, but the communities had little or no input on them. This project consisted in the creation of lahar volcanic hazard map for the Canton Buanos Aires on the northern part of the volcano by incorporating the community's knowledge from prior events to model parameters and results. The work with the community consisted in several meetings where the community members recounted past events. They were asked to map the outcomes of those events using either a topographic map of the area, a Google Earth image, or a blank paper poster size. These maps have been used to identify hazard and vulnerable areas, and for model validation. These maps were presented to the communities and they accepted their results and the maps.\n\nInfluence of rootstocks on growth, yield, fruit quality and leaf mineral element contents of pear cv. 'Santa Maria' in semi-arid conditions.\n\nPubMed\n\nIkinci, Ali; Bolat, Ibrahim; Ercisli, Sezai; Kodad, Ossama\n\n2014-12-16\n\nRootstocks play an essential role to determining orchard performance of fruit trees. Pyrus communis and Cydonia oblonga are widely used rootstocks for European pear cultivars. The lack of rootstocks adapted to different soil conditions and different grafted cultivars is widely acknowledged in pear culture. Cydonia rootstocks (clonal) and Pyrus rootstocks (seedling or clonal) have their advantages and disadvantages. In each case, site-specific environmental characteristics, specific cultivar response and production objectives must be considered before choosing the best rootstock. In this study, the influence of three Quince (BA 29, Quince A = MA, Quince C = MC) and a local European pear seedling rootstocks on the scion yield, some fruit quality characteristics and leaf macro (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) and micro element (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn and B) content of 'Santa Maria' pear (Pyrus communis L.) were investigated. Trees on seedling rootstock had the highest annual yield, highest cumulative yield (kg tree(-1)), largest trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA), lowest yield efficiency and lowest cumulative yield (ton ha(-1)) in the 10(th) year after planting. The rootstocks had no significant effect on average fruit weight and fruit volume. Significantly higher fruit firmness was obtained on BA 29 and Quince A. The effect of rootstocks on the mineral element accumulation (N, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn and B) was significant. Leaf analysis showed that rootstocks used had different mineral uptake efficiencies throughout the early season. The results showed that the rootstocks strongly affected fruit yield, fruit quality and leaf mineral element uptake of 'Santa Maria' pear cultivar. Pear seedling and BA 29 rootstock found to be more prominent in terms of several characteristics for 'Santa Maria' pear cultivar that is grown in highly calcareous soil in semi-arid climate conditions. We determined the highest N, P (although insignificant), K, Ca, Mg, Fe and Cu mineral element concentrations\n\n[Violence and social distress among transgender persons in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nSouza, Martha Helena Teixeira de; Malvasi, Paulo; Signorelli, Marcos Claudio; Pereira, Pedro Paulo Gomes\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe authors conducted an ethnographic research with transgender persons in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, in 2012, using participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and following their everyday lives. These individuals invariably experienced physical and symbolic violence and the resulting distress, a condition they had to deal with in their careers and daily practices and tasks. The article discusses the violence experienced by transvestites (in the family, school, police precincts, and health services), specifically seeking to understand how such violence relates to their experiences with health services and how the latter respond.\n\nHistory of the Journal of Nursing of the Federal University of Santa Maria.\n\nPubMed\n\nBudÃ³, Maria de Lourdes Denardin; Beck, Carmem LÃºcia ColomÃ©; Silva, Dalva Cezar da; Prestes, Francine Cassol; Soares, Rhea Silvia de Avila; Garcia, Raquel PÃ¶tter\n\n2017-02-09\n\nTo report the history of the Journal of Nursing of the Federal University of Santa Maria.

Point sources includes a sugar-beet refinery, oil refineries, stockyards, golf courses, poultry farms, solid-waste landfills, and municipal and industrial wastewater-treatment facilities. Pumpage has exceeded recharge by about 10,000 acre-feet per year. The result is a declining potentiometric surface with an accumulation of solutes and an increase in nitrogen in ground water. Nitrogen concentrations have reached as much as 50 milligrams per liter. In comparison to the solutes from irrigation return, natural recharge, and rain, discharge of wastewater from municipal and industrial wastewater-treatment facilities contributes less than 10 percent. The quality of treated wastewater is often lower in select chemical constituents than the receiving water.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between obesity and fracture in postmenopausal women from Santa Maria, Brazil. A cross-sectional study was carried out at Santa Maria (parallel 29Â° south), Brazil. Postmenopausal women aged â¥55Â yr who had at least 1 appointment at the primary care in the 2Â years before the study were recruited from March 1, 2013 to August 31, 2013. The Global Longitudinal Study of Osteoporosis in Women study questionnaire was applied with permission of The Center for Outcomes Research, University of Massachusetts Medical School. Height and weight were measured according to the World Health Organization protocol. Bone fractures (excluding hand, feet, and head) that occurred after the age of 45Â yr were considered as the outcome. Overall, 1057 women completed the study, of whom 984 had body mass index measured. The mean (standard deviation) age and body mass index of the women included in the study were 67.1 (7.6) yr and 29.2 (5.5) kg/m(2), respectively. The prevalence of fractures in obese and nonobese women was similar (17.3% vs 16.0%); 41.4% of all fractures occurred in obese women. Obese postmenopausal women make a substantial contribution to the overall burden of prevalent fractures in this population. Our results provide further evidence in support of the concept that obesity is not protective against fracture. Copyright Â© 2015 The International Society for Clinical Densitometry.

In this retrospective report, we aimed to describe the nightclub fire event, its immediate consequences, and evaluated its impact on legislation. Our objective was to disseminate the lessons we learned from this large-scale nightclub fire disaster. We conducted a literature review in PubMed and Lilacs database from 2013 to 2015 related to the nightclub Kiss, Santa Maria, fire, burns, and similar events worldwide over the past 15 years. We searched in the general press and online media information sites, and seeking legislation about this topic at the federal level in Brazil. We reported on the legislation changes that resulted from this nightclub fire. Current federal legislation on fire prevention and the scope of public safety, including night clubs and discos, states is the duty of the state and everyone's responsibility, pursuant to Article 144 of the Federal Constitution of Brazil. Thus, the federal union, individual states and municipalities have the power to legislate on fire prevention, and especially to ensure the security of the population. A state law called \"Law Kiss\", was passed in 2014, establishing standards on safety, prevention and protection against fire in buildings and areas of fire risk in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. On a national level, a law of prevention and fire fighting in Brazil was also drafted after the Santa Maria disaster (Law project no. 4923, 2013). Currently, this bill is still awaiting sanction before it can take effect. As we push for enactment of the national law of prevention and fire fighting in Brazil, we will continue emphasizing fire prevention, fire protection, fire fighting, means of escape and proper management. All similar events in this and other countries remind us that similar tragedies may occur anywhere, and that the analysis of facts, previous mistakes, during and\n\nThe Response of Sediments and Dissolved Organic Matter to Rapid Rainfall in the Santa Maria da Vitoria Watershed, EspÃ­rito Santo, BR\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWard, N. D.; Firme de Almeida, L.; Dias, G.; Gould, R.; Tan, A.; Bianchi, T. S.; Krusche, A. V.; Keil, R. G.; Richey, J. E.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe Santa Maria da VitÃ³ria River supplies over 30% of the water for the greater VitÃ³ria, EspÃ­rito Santo, BR metropolitan area, which has a population of roughly 1.6 million people. The availability of clean freshwater is severely limited during periods of heavy rainfall because water sanitation facilities are \"clogged\" by high sediment discharge. The headwaters of the Santa Maria da VitÃ³ria River are characterized by relatively pristine forested environments, transitioning into primarily agricultural and rural land uses, and finally reaching the large urban center of VitÃ³ria near its marine receiving waters. The discharge of suspended sediments and dissolved organic matter (DOM) was examined at a 3 hour frequency during heavy storm flows from October 2013 to May 2015 in the Santa Maria da VitÃ³ria River main channel and a small tributary, the MangaraÃ­ River. Bulk isotopic analyses were used to determine potential sediment sources and whether specific landscape/land use features were functionalized during periods of high runoff. Likewise, time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-ToF-MS) was used to identify a broad suite of DOM compounds that responded positively with river discharge in an effort to determine the influence of land use on the delivery of dissolved components to the river. For example, the abundance of compounds related to specific agricultural settings increased during storm flow along with anthropogenic DOM sources such as plasticizer and pesticide-derived compounds. Suspended sediment concentrations increased by as much as 70 times during peak river discharge relative to base flow several days earlier with similar increases in particulate organic carbon and nitrogen observed. Results from this study and previous field measurements were integrated into a coupled hydrology-sediment transport model, DHSVM, as part of a dynamic information framework with the goal of predicting water/sediment discharge to inform management and policy sectors of the\n\nMutations of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Durham, Santa-Maria and A+ Variants Are Associated with Loss Functional and Structural Stability of the Protein\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGÃ³mez-Manzo, SaÃºl; Marcial-Quino, Jaime; Vanoye-Carlo, America; EnrÃ­quez-Flores, Sergio; De la Mora-De la Mora, Ignacio; GonzÃ¡lez-Valdez, Abigail; GarcÃ­a-Torres, Itzhel; MartÃ­nez-Rosas, VÃ­ctor; Sierra-Palacios, Edgar; Lazcano-PÃ©rez, Fernando; RodrÃ­guez-Bustamante, Eduardo; Arreguin-Espinosa, Roberto\n\n2015-01-01\n\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzymopathy in the world. More than 160 mutations causing the disease have been identified, but only 10% of these variants have been studied at biochemical and biophysical levels. In this study we report on the functional and structural characterization of three naturally occurring variants corresponding to different classes of disease severity: Class I G6PD Durham, Class II G6PD Santa Maria, and Class III G6PD A+. The results showed that the G6PD Durham (severe deficiency), and the G6PD Santa Maria and A+ (less severe deficiency) (Class I, II and III, respectively) affect the catalytic efficiency of these enzymes, are more sensitive to temperature denaturing, and affect the stability of the overall protein when compared to the wild type WT-G6PD. In the variants, the exposure of more and buried hydrophobic pockets was induced and monitored with 8-Anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS) fluorescence, directly affecting the compaction of structure at different levels and probably reducing the stability of the protein. The degree of functional and structural perturbation by each variant correlates with the clinical severity reported in different patients.

CSM is a collection of 427 canticles composed in Galician-Portuguese between 1252 and 1284 at the Court of King Alfonso X the Wise of Spain (1221-1284). The canticles (of which 9 are repeated) include devotional and liturgical poems and 353 narrative stories consisting mainly of depictions of Marian miracles. Most are set to music and many are illustrated. We reviewed the canticles for description of miracles and other neuropsychiatric phenomena. Two neurologists reached a consensus about the descriptions. Of the 353 miracles, 279 medically relevant facts (from 187 canticles) and 25 instances of resurrection were reported. Possible neuropsychiatric conditions were described in 98 canticles. Physicians were mentioned in 16 narratives. The most common neurologic conditions detailed were blindness (n = 17), dystonia, weakness, and deformities (n = 20). Other common conditions included psychosis (n = 15), speech disorder/deaf-mutism (n = 12), infections (n = 15), sexual dysfunction/infertility/obstetrical-gynecologic issues (n = 18), head trauma (n = 5), ergotism/St. Anthony's fire (n = 7), and others. There were 9 instances of prodromic mystical experiences/hallucinations heralding death. While limited by retrospection and interpretation of neuropsychiatric phenomena in the medieval context, these short accounts are among the first descriptions of neuropsychiatric conditions in early Portuguese/Galician. They reflect how medieval societies used rational and irrational approaches to understand occurrences in their lives.

The volcano is a prevalent part of every day life in El Salvador; the sugarcane and coffee belt of the country are to its Southern and Western flanks, recreational areas lies to its East, and second and third largest cities of El Salvador exist within its 25 km radius. Understanding the eruptive characteristics and history is imperative due to the volcano's relative size (the highest in the country) and it's explosive, composite nature. Historical records indicate at least 9 potential VEI 3 eruptions since 1521 AD. The volcano's relative inaccessibility and potential hazards do not promote a vast reservoir of research activity, as can be seen in the scarcity of published papers on topics prior to the 1904 eruption. This research represents the first steps towards creating a comprehensive stratigraphic record of the crater and characterizing its eruptive history, with an eventual goal of recreating the volcanic structure prior to its collapse. Samples of pre-1904 eruptive material were taken from the southern wall of an E-W oriented fluvial gully located within the SSW of the tertiary crater. These were analyzed using thin sections and optical microscopy, grain size distribution techniques, and scanning electron microscopy. The 15-layer sequence indicates an explosive history characterized by intense phreatomagmatic phases, plinian, sub-plinian and basaltic/andesitic composition strombolian activity. Another poster within the session will discuss an older sequence within the walls of the secondary crater. Further detailed studies will be required to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of Santa Ana Volcano.\n\nIntrospection on improper seismic retrofit of Basilica Santa Maria di Collemaggio after 2009 Italian earthquake\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCimellaro, Gian Paolo; Reinhorn, Andrei M.; de Stefano, Alessandro\n\n2011-03-01\n\nThe 2009 L'Aquila, Italy earthquake highlighted the seismic vulnerability of historic masonry building structures due to improper \"strengthening\" retrofit work that has been done in the last 50 years. Italian seismic standards recommend the use of traditional reinforcement techniques such as replacing the original wooden roof structure with new reinforced concrete (RC) or steel elements, inserting RC tie-beams in the masonry and new RC floors, and using RC jacketing on the shear walls. The L'Aquila earthquake revealed the numerous limitations of these interventions, because they led to increased seismic forces (due to greater additional weight) and to deformation incompatibilities of the incorporated elements with the existing masonry walls. This paper provides a discussion of technical issues pertaining to the seismic retrofit of the Santa Maria di Collemaggio Basilica and in particular, the limitations of the last (2000) retrofit intervention. Considerable damage was caused to the church because of questionable actions and incorrect and improper technical choices.\n\nAssessment of MSIV full closure for Santa Maria de Garona Nuclear Power Plant using TRAC-BF1 (G1J1)\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCrespo, J.L.; Fernandez, R.A.\n\n1993-06-01\n\nThis document presents a spurious Main Steam Isolation Value (MSIV) closure analysis for Santa Maria de Garorta Nuclear Power Plan describing the problems found when comparing calculated and real data.

Based on their concentrations the ranking of metals Fe>Zn>Ni>Cr>Mn>Pb>Cu>Co>As>Cd>Hg suggests that organism size, metabolism and feeding habits are correlated with metal concentrations. Local geological formations affect the concentrations of different metals in the aquatic environment and are subsequently transferred to fishes. The correlation analysis suggests that metabolism and nurturing habits impact the concentration of metals. Concentrations of Fe and Mn appear to be influenced by scavenging and absorption processes, which vary by species. The considerable variability in the metal concentrations obtained in different species underscores the importance of regular monitoring. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

R.; Saucedo, R.; Macias, J.; Arce, J.; Garcia-Palomo, A.; Mora, J.; Scolamacchia, T.\n\n2003-12-01\n\nTacanÃ¡ volcano, with a height of 4,030 m above sea level, straddles the southern Mexico/Guatemala border. Last active in 1986, when there was a small phreatic event with a duration of a few days, this volcano presents an impending hazard to over 250,000 people. The NE sector of the volcano reveals the violent volcanic history of TacanÃ¡ that may be indicative of a serious potential risk to the area. Its earliest pyroclastic history appears to consist of fall, flow, and surge deposits, together with lavas, that have formed megablocks within a series of old debris avalanche deposits. This sector collapse event is overlain by a sequence of pumice fall and ash flow deposits, of which the youngest, less-altered pumice fall deposit shows a minimum thickness of > 4 m, with a dispersal axis trending toward the NE. A second debris avalanche deposit, separated from the above deposits by a paleosoil, is dominated by megablocks of lava and scoriaceous dome material. The current topography around the northeastern flank of the volcano is determined by a third, and most recent debris avalanche deposit, a thick (> 20 m) sequence of six block and ash flows dated at around 16,000 years BP, each separated by 1-10 cm thick ash cloud surge deposit, together with secondary lahar deposits. These are followed by a at least 4 lava flows that extend 2 km down the flank of the volcano. It appears that the most recent pyroclastic event at TacanÃ¡ is also recorded in this sector of the volcano: above the block and ash flows occurs a > 1 m thick ash flow unit that can be seen at least 5 km from the vent. Lastly, the Santa Maria Ash fall deposit, produced in 1902, has capped most of the deposits at TacanÃ¡.\n\n[A collection of scientific instruments at the dawn of the modern hospital: Vincenzo Viviani's physical-mathematical instruments and Santa Maria Hospital in Florence (1871-1895)].\n\nPubMed\n\nDiana, Esther\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAround the second half of the nineteenth century, the collection of physics-mathematical instruments that Vincenzo Viviani (1622-1703) had bequeathed to the Santa Maria Nuova Hospital of Florence stirred new interest. The process of modernising the hospital was indeed to lead to the progressive alienation of the institution's rich historical patrimony, including the scientific collections. In tracing back the negotiations that led to the sale of the Viviani collection, archive documents have also brought to light the collection inventory, which is now proposed a new to help recount the history of how scientific instruments became museum collectibles in Florence.\n\nBiodiversity of the white coral bank off Cape Santa Maria di Leuca (Mediterranean Sea): An update\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMastrototaro, F.; D'Onghia, G.; Corriero, G.; Matarrese, A.; Maiorano, P.; Panetta, P.; Gherardi, M.; Longo, C.; Rosso, A.; Sciuto, F.; Sanfilippo, R.; Gravili, C.; Boero, F.; Taviani, M.; Tursi, A.\n\n2010-03-01\n\nThe biodiversity of the Santa Maria di Leuca (SML) coral bank is summarized and its description is updated using data collected by means of underwater video systems, benthic samplers and fishing gears. A total of 222 living species have been recorded within the coral bank area in the depth range 280-1121 m. The most abundant benthic taxa recorded are Porifera (36 species) followed by Mollusca (35) and Cnidaria (31). The scleractinian corals Madrepora oculata and Lophelia pertusa are the main colonial species in the structure of the SML bank. Annelida, Crustacea and Bryozoa have been found with 24, 23 and 19 species, respectively. A total of 40 species of demersal fish have been recorded. Other faunal taxa were found with small numbers of species. One hundred and thirty-five species are new for the SML bank, 31 of which represent new records for the north-western Ionian Sea (2 Porifera, 17 Cnidaria, 1 Mollusca, 3 Annelida, 2 Crustacea, 4 Bryozoa and 4 Echinodermata). The finding of the annelid HarmothoÃ« vesiculosa represents the first record for the Mediterranean Sea.

A.; Ortiz, R.; Martin, J. M.; Ctvrtnickova, T.; Mateo, M. P.; Nicolas, G.\n\n2010-09-01\n\nThe aim of the study was to characterize specimens submitted to the effects of weathering in an urban atmosphere. Samples investigated were stones covered by crusts and deposits of thickness ranging from micrometers to millimetres due to traffic pollutants and mineral dust. The pieces were collected in the Church of Santa Maria La Blanca in Seville (South Spain). In the Historical Centre of this city, the traffic is the main source of sulphur oxides. Several analytical techniques have been employed to determine composition of specimens: OM, XRD, XRF, SEM-EDX and LIBS. The main weathering form was gypsum (CaSO4á¹¡2H2O), and it has its source in sulphur oxides from traffic. Over this alteration layer, the deposits of atmospheric particles have been found. According to LIBS results, these particles can be composed of Al, Si, Ba, K, Na, Ti, V, Mg and Ca, while XRF technique also detect S, Fe, Mn and P. These atmospheric particles can have an anthropogenic or terrigenous origin, including the weathering of the building materials and its restoration products.\n\nOccurrence and behaviour of Paromola cuvieri (Crustacea, Decapoda) in the Santa Maria di Leuca cold-water coral community (Mediterranean Sea)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCapezzuto, Francesca; Maiorano, Porzia; Panza, Michele; Indennidate, Antonella; Sion, Letizia; D'Onghia, Gianfranco\n\n2012-01-01\n\nOccurrence and behaviour of Paromola cuvieri (Crustacea, Decapoda) were recorded by means of the MEMO lander equipped with two digital cameras and deployed in the cold-water coral community of the Santa Maria di Leuca (Mediterranean Sea). A total of 14 individuals were observed at depths between 547 and 648 m; 10 in the coral habitat on coral mounds and 4 off the coral habitat on muddy bottoms. Thirteen specimens recorded were females, one male and all were shown to scavenge the bait. All the specimens carried a sponge on their exoskeleton using the fifth pereiopods. The specimens were distinguishable by the size and shape of the carried sponge. The present observations demonstrate both passive covering behaviour and active behaviour of discouraging approach and attack from competitors or predators, respectively. This study represents the first in situ documentation of Paromola cuvieri behaviour interacting with other deep-sea species in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nLong-term changes in sediment barium inventories associated with drilling-related discharges in the Santa Maria Basin, California, USA\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPhillips, C.; Evans, J.; Hom, W.\n\n1998-09-01\n\nNine-year (1986--1995) records of barium (Ba) concentrations in surficial, subsurface, and suspended sediments near offshore oil and gas platforms in the Santa Maria Basin, California, USA, were analyzed to evaluate temporal trends related to drilling activities. These trends provide important information on the long-term effects of drilling discharges on geochemical conditions. Drilling during the 1986 through 1989 (phase II) monitoring period resulted in significant changes in Ba concentrations in suspended particles and surficial sediments, whereas the relatively shorter 1993 through 1994 (phase III) drilling operations resulted in only minor increases in Ba concentrations in suspended sediments. Residual excess Ba wasmoreÂ Â» present in some sediments within 500 m of the platforms at concentrations up to an order of magnitude above background. These elevated levels probably were associated with cuttings particles deposited near the base of the platforms. Calculated excess Ba in sediments within 500 m of the platforms represented 6 to 11% of the total Ba discharged during the two drilling periods.Â«Â less\n\nVolcano-ice-sea interaction in the Cerro Santa Marta area, northwest James Ross Island, Antarctic Peninsula\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCalabozo, Fernando M.; Strelin, Jorge A.; Orihashi, Yuji; Sumino, Hirochika; Keller, Randall A.\n\n2015-05-01\n\nWe present here the results of detailed mapping, lithofacies analysis and stratigraphy of the Neogene James Ross Island Volcanic Group (Antarctic Peninsula) in the Cerro Santa Marta area (northwest of James Ross Island), in order to give constraints on the evolution of a glaciated volcanic island. Our field results included recognition and interpretation of seventeen volcanic and glacial lithofacies, together with their vertical and lateral arrangements, supported by four new unspiked K-Ar ages. This allowed us to conclude that the construction of the volcanic pile in this area took place during two main eruptive stages (Eruptive Stages 1 and 2), separated from the Cretaceous bedrock and from each other by two major glacial unconformities (U1 and U2). The U1 unconformity is related to Antarctic Peninsula Ice sheet expansion during the late Miocene (before 6.2 Ma) and deposition of glacial lithofacies in a glaciomarine setting. Following this glacial advance, Eruptive Stage 1 (6.2-4.6 Ma) volcanism started with subaerial extrusion of lava flows from an unrecognized vent north of the study area, with eruptions later fed from vent/s centered at Cerro Santa Marta volcano, where cinder cone deposits and a volcanic conduit/lava lake are preserved. These lava flows fed an extensive (> 7 km long) hyaloclastite delta system that was probably emplaced in a shallow marine environment. A second unconformity (U2) was related to expansion of a local ice cap, centered on James Ross Island, which truncated all the eruptive units of Eruptive Stage 1. Concomitant with glacier advance, renewed volcanic activity (Eruptive Stage 2) started after 4.6 Ma and volcanic products were fed again by Cerro Santa Marta vents. We infer that glaciovolcanic eruptions occurred under a moderately thin (~ 300 m) glacier, in good agreement with previous estimates of paleo-ice thickness for the James Ross Island area during the Pliocene.\n\nLaser doppler and radar interferometer for contactless measurements on unaccessible tie-rods on monumental buildings: Santa Maria della Consolazione Temple in Todi\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGioffrÃ©, M.; Cavalagli, N.; Pepi, C.; Trequattrini, M.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nNon-contact measurements can be effectively used in civil engineering to assess the variation of structural performance with time. In the last decades this approach has received considerable interests from researchers working in the field of structural health monitoring (SHM). Indeed, non-contact measurements are very attractive because it is possible to perform non intrusive and non destructive investigations even being at a significant distance from the targets. Within this context, contactless measurements of the tie-rod vibrations in the Santa Maria della Consolazione Temple in Todi (Italy) are presented in this paper. In particular, laser vibrometer and radar interferometer measurements are used to estimate natural frequencies and mode shapes. This information is crucial to obtain the tensile axial force in the tie-rods, which can be used as an indicator of structural integrity or possible failure. Furthermore, a novel approach is proposed where drones (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) can be successfully used to improve the effectiveness and the accuracy of the experimental activities.\n\nEvidences of volcanic unrest on high-temperature fumaroles by satellite thermal monitoring: The case of Santa Ana volcano, El Salvador\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLaiolo, M.; Coppola, D.; Barahona, F.; BenÃ­tez, J. E.; Cigolini, C.; Escobar, D.; Funes, R.; Gutierrez, E.; Henriquez, B.; Hernandez, A.; Montalvo, F.; Olmos, R.; Ripepe, M.; Finizola, A.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nOn October 1st, 2005, Santa Ana volcano (El Salvador) underwent a VEI 3 phreatomagmatic eruption after approximately one century of rest. Casualties and damages to some of the local infrastructures and surrounding plantations were followed by the evacuation of the nearby communities. The analysis of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) infrared data reveals that the main explosion was preceded by a one-year-long thermal unrest, associated to the development of a fumaroles field, located at the western rim of the summit crater lake. By combining space-based thermal flux and ground-based measurements (seismicity, sulfur emissions and lake temperatures), we suggest that the activity observed at Santa Ana between 2004 and 2005 was driven by the gradual intrusion of an undegassed magma body at a very shallow depth. Magma injection induced thermal anomalies associated with sustained degassing from the fumaroles field and promoted the interaction between the magmatic-hydrothermal system and the overlying water table. This process culminated into the VEI 3 phreatomagmatic eruption of October 2005 that strongly modified the shallow structure of the crater area. The subsequent three-years-long activity resulted from self-sealing of the fracture system and by the opening of a new fracture network directly connecting the deeper hydrothermal system with the crater lake. Our results show that satellite-based thermal data allow us to detect the expansion of the high-temperature fumarolic field. This may precede an explosive eruption and/or a lava dome extrusion. In particular, we show that thermal records can be analyzed with other geochemical (i.e. SO2 emissions) and geophysical (seismicity) data to track a shallow magmatic intrusion interacting with the surrounding hydrothermal system. This provides a remarkable support for volcano monitoring and eruption forecasting, particularly in remote areas where permanent ground data acquisition is hazardous, expensive\n\n[Oxacillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci bacteremia at a teaching hospital in Santa Maria, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nRigatti, Fabiane; Tizotti, MaÃ­sa Kraulich; HÃ¶rner, Rosmari; Domingues, Vanessa Oliveira; Martini, RosiÃ©li; Mayer, LetÃ­cia Eichstaedt; Khun, FÃ¡bio Teixeira; de FranÃ§a, Chirles AraÃºjo; da Costa, Mateus Matiuzzi\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis study aimed to characterize the prevalence and susceptibility profile to oxacillin-resistant Coagulase-negative Staphylococci strains isolated from blood cultures in a teaching hospital, located in Santa Maria, RS. In addition, different methodologies for phenotypic characterization of mecA-mediated oxacillin resistance were compared with genotypic reference testing. After identification (MicroScan - Siemens), the isolates were tested for antimicrobial sensitivity using disk diffusion and automation (MicroScan - Siemens). The presence of mecA gene was identified by the polymerase chain reaction molecular technique. The most common species was Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=40, 67%). The mecA gene was detected in 54 (90%) strains, while analysis of the sensitivity profiles revealed a high rate of resistance to multiple classes of antimicrobial drugs. However, all isolates were uniformly sensitive to vancomycin and tigecycline. The cefoxitin disk was the phenotypic method that best correlated with the gold standard. Analysis of the clinical significance of CoNS isolated from hemocultures and the precise detection of oxacillin resistance represent decisive factors for the correct choice of antibiotic therapy. Although vancomycin constitutes the normal treatment in most Brazilian hospitals, reduction in its use is recommended.\n\nA review of the MIS 5e highstand deposits from Santa Maria Island (Azores, NE Atlantic): palaeobiodiversity, palaeoecology and palaeobiogeography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÃvila, SÃ©rgio P.; Melo, Carlos; Silva, LuÃ­s; Ramalho, Ricardo S.; Quartau, Rui; HipÃ³lito, Ana; Cordeiro, Ricardo; Rebelo, Ana Cristina; Madeira, PatrÃ­cia; Rovere, Alessio; Hearty, Paul J.; Henriques, Diamantino; Silva, Carlos Marques da; Martins, AntÃ³nio M. de Frias; Zazo, Caridad\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe privileged location of Santa Maria Island (Azores archipelago) in the middle of the North Atlantic makes the fossiliferous outcrops on this island of utmost importance to gain a better understanding of how coeval living communities relate to the broader evolutionary and biogeographic history of the Atlantic basin during the late Neogene and the Quaternary. Here we focus on this island's MIS 5e fossil record, offering a comprehensive review on the palaeobiodiversity, palaeoecology and palaeobiogeography of the biota living in the mid North Atlantic during this interglacial. Several studies in oceanic islands stress the huge impact of sea level changes on insular communities. Pleistocene sea-level changes occur during the short-time events known as \"Terminations\" (associated to glacial/interglacial shifts) as well as with the onset of glaciations (associated to interglacial/glacial shifts). Both are responsible for extinctions and local disappearance of species, bottleneck effects and formation of new species, resulting in community structure changes. This work increases the number of fossil marine taxa reported from the Last Interglacial deposits of Santa Maria to 143 species. All the 19 new records are molluscs (13 gastropods and 6 bivalves), thus increasing the number of fossil molluscs to 136 species. Although thermophilic members of the \"Senegalese\" tropical fauna were found in these deposits, many of the most emblematic species (e.g., Persististrombus latus (=Strombus bubonius), Cymbula safiana, Harpa doris, Cardita senegalensis, Barbatia plicata, Ctena eburnea or Hyotissa hyotis) are absent, suggesting that they did not reach the Azores. Our results indicate that the main differences between the species composition of the MIS 5e and the present-day shallow-water Azorean communities are probably due to the dropping of sea surface temperature associated with the onset of the last glaciation, which had both direct and indirect effects on species ecology. A\n\nReducing volcanic risk; are we winning some battles but losing the war?\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nTilling, R.I.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nHistorically, significant advances in volcanology have been catalyzed by volcanic disasters or crises, reflecting the the simple fact that volcanoes seem to receive serious scientific and public attention only when they cause, or threaten to cause, trouble. For example, three deadly eruptions in 1902, Mount Pelee, Santa Maria, and Soufriere (St.Vincent), spurred the movement to establish permanent volcano observatories there. Profoundly impresses by the devastation cused by Mont Pelee, Thomas A. Jaggar, Jr. founded the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) in 1912. Since then, studies conducted at HVO and new observatories have been pivotal in transforming the nascent science of volcanology into the multidisciplinary science that it is today.Â\n\nMethane Hydrate Recovered From A Mud Volcano in Santa Monica Basin, Offshore Southern California\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNormark, W. R.; Hein, J. R.; Powell, C. L.; Lorenson, T. D.; Lee, H. J.; Edwards, B. D.\n\n2003-12-01\n\nIn July 2003, a short (2.1 m) piston core from the summit of a mud volcano recovered methane hydrate at a water depth of 813 m in Santa Monica Basin. The discovery core penetrated into in the hydrate as evidenced by chunks of ice and violent degassing of the core section between 162 and 212 cm depth. The core consists of shell hash and carbonate clasts (to 7-cm long) in silty mud. The methanogenic carbonates are of two types: massive, recrystallized nodular masses with an outer mm-thick sugary patina and a bivalve coquina with carbonate cement. Living clams including the genus Vesicomya, commonly found at cold-seep sites elsewhere, were recovered from the top of the core. Further sampling attempts using piston, gravity, and box corers, all of which were obtained within 15 m of the discovery core, recovered olive-brown silty mud with variable amounts of whole and fragmented bivalve shells and methanogenic carbonate fragments characteristic of cold-seep environments. Gases collected in cores adjacent to the discovery core contain elevated amounts of methane and trace amounts of heavier hydrocarbon gases, indicating some component from thermogenic sources. Hydrogen sulfide was also detected in these sediment samples. Vertical channels in one core may have served as fluid pathways. The existence of hydrate at such a shallow depth in the sediment was unexpected, however, the presence of Vesicomya and hydrogen sulfide indicate that the mud volcano is a site of active methane venting. The mud volcano, which is about 24 km west-southwest of Redondo Beach, is about 300 m in diameter at the base. No internal structure is resolved on either high resolution deep-tow boomer or single-channel air-gun profiles, most likely as a result of the gas content and sediment deformation. The diapiric structure has ascended through well-bedded sediment on the lower slope of the basin, producing as much as 30 m of bathymetric relief. It is located in an area where strike-slip motion along\n\nSpectroscopic study of the degradation products in the holy water fonts in Santa Maria della Steccata Church in Parma (Italy).\n\nPubMed\n\nBersani, D; Campani, E; Casoli, A; Lottici, P P; Marino, I-G\n\n2008-03-03\n\nTwo holy water fonts (dated at the beginning of the XVII century) in the Santa Maria della Steccata Church in Parma (Italy) have recently been restored. Before the intervention, a detailed investigation on their degradation products was carried out to understand the mechanisms of alteration of the materials and to suggest appropriate restoration procedures. The analyses were performed by means of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), micro-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and micro-Raman spectroscopies. Calcite, iron oxides, silicates and sodium chloride (from salted holy water) were found in the red coloured calcarenite. On and under the lead coverings, different lead oxides (mainly massicot), other lead salts (lead basic carbonate, cerussite, plumbonacrite Pb10O(OH)6(CO3)6 and lead-chlorine compounds as laurionite PbOHCl and phosgenite Pb2CO3Cl2) were identified by Raman spectroscopy and XRD. Haematite alpha-Fe2O3, goethite alpha-FeO(OH) and lepidocrocite gamma-FeO(OH) were found on and around the iron hinges. Lead compounds and sodium chloride, through crystallization and solubilization cycles, were responsible for the stone's degradation, whereas the iron corrosion materials on the hinges produced mechanical stress and cracks in the stone. Various suggestions have been given on how to restore these fonts and to remove the causes of damage.\n\nRelationships among in-situ stress, fractures and faults, and fluid flow: Monterey formation, Santa Maria Basin, California\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nFinkbeiner, T.; Barton, C.A.; Zoback, M.D.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nWe used borehole televiewer (BHTV) data from four wells within the onshore and offshore Santa Maria basin, California, to investigate the relationships among fracture distribution, orientation, and variation with depth and in-situ stress. Our analysis of stress-induced well-bore breakouts shows a uniform northeast maximum horizontal stress (SH max) orientation in each well. This direction is consistent with the SH max direction determined from well-bore breakouts in other wells in this region, the northwest trend of active fold axes, and kinematic inversion of nearby earthquake focal plane mechanisms. In contrast to the uniformity of the stress field, fracture orientation, dip, and frequency vary considerably from well to well and within each well. With depth, fractures can be divided into distinct subsets on the basis of fracture frequency and orientation, which correlate with changes of lithology and physical properties. Although factors such as tectonic history, diagenesis, and structural variations obviously have influenced fracture distribution, integration of the in-situ stress and fracture data sets indicates that many of the fractures, faults, and bedding planes are active, small-scale strike-slip and reverse faults in the current northeast-trending transpressive stress field. In fact, we observed local breakout rotations in the wells, providing kinematic evidence for recent shear motion along fracture and bedding-parallel planes. Only in the onshore well do steeply dipping fractures strike parallel to SHmax. Drill-stem tests from two of the offshore wells indicate that formation permeability is greatly enhanced in sections of the wells where fractures are favorably oriented for shear failure in the modern stress field. Thus, relatively small-scale active faults provide important conduits along which fluids migrate.\n\nThe Santa Barbara Channel - Santa Maria Basin Study: Wind Measurements and Modeling Resolving Coastal Mesoscale Meteorology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDorman, C. E.; Koracin, D.\n\n2002-12-01\n\nThe importance of winds in driving the coastal ocean has long been recognized. Pre-World War II literature links wind stress and wind stress curl to coastal ocean responses. Nevertheless, direct measurements plausibly representative of a coastal area are few. Multiple observations on the scale of the simplest mesoscale atmospheric structure, such as the cross-coast variation along a linear coast, are even less frequent. The only wind measurements that we are aware of in a complicated coastal area backed by higher topography are in the MMS sponsored, Santa Barbara Channel/Santa Marina basin study. Taking place from 1994 to present, this study had an unheard of dense surface automated meteorological station array of up to 5 meteorological buoys, 4 oil platforms, 2 island stations, and 11 coastal stations within 1 km of the beach. Most of the land stations are maintained by other projects. Only a large, a well funded project with backed by an agency with the long-view could dedicate the resources and effort into filling the mesoscale \"holes\" and maintaining long-term, remotely located stations. The result of the MMS funded project is a sufficiently dense surface station array to resolve the along-coast and cross-coast atmospheric mesoscale wind structure. Great temporal and spatial variation is found in the wind, wind stress and the wind stress curl, during the extended summer season. The MM5 atmospheric mesoscale model with appropriate boundary layer physics and high-resolution horizontal and vertical grid structure successfully simulates the measured wind field from large scale down to the lower end of the mesoscale. Atmospheric models without appropriate resolution and boundary layer physics fail to capture significant mesoscale wind features. Satellite microwave wind measurements generally capture the offshore synoptic scale temporal and spatial scale in twice-a-day snap shots but fail in the crucial, innermost coastal waters and the diurnal scale.\n\nNatural Offshore Oil Seepage and Related Tarball Accumulation on the California Coastline - Santa Barbara Channel and the Southern Santa Maria Basin: Source Identification and Inventory\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nLorenson, T.D.; Hostettler, Frances D.; Rosenbauer, Robert J.; Peters, Kenneth E.; Dougherty, Jennifer A.; Kvenvolden, Keith A.; Gutmacher, Christina E.; Wong, Florence L.; Normark, William R.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nOil spillage from natural sources is very common in the waters of southern California. Active oil extraction and shipping is occurring concurrently within the region and it is of great interest to resource managers to be able to distinguish between natural seepage and anthropogenic oil spillage. The major goal of this study was to establish the geologic setting, sources, and ultimate dispersal of natural oil seeps in the offshore southern Santa Maria Basin and Santa Barbara Basins. Our surveys focused on likely areas of hydrocarbon seepage that are known to occur between Point Arguello and Ventura, California. Our approach was to 1) document the locations and geochemically fingerprint natural seep oils or tar; 2) geochemically fingerprint coastal tar residues and potential tar sources in this region, both onshore and offshore; 3) establish chemical correlations between offshore active seeps and coastal residues thus linking seep sources to oil residues; 4) measure the rate of natural seepage of individual seeps and attempt to assess regional natural oil and gas seepage rates; and 5) interpret the petroleum system history for the natural seeps. To document the location of sub-sea oil seeps, we first looked into previous studies within and near our survey area. We measured the concentration of methane gas in the water column in areas of reported seepage and found numerous gas plumes and measured high concentrations of methane in the water column. The result of this work showed that the seeps were widely distributed between Point Conception east to the vicinity of Coal Oil Point, and that they by in large occur within the 3-mile limit of California State waters. Subsequent cruises used sidescan and high resolution seismic to map the seafloor, from just south of Point Arguello, east to near Gaviota, California. The results of the methane survey guided the exploration of the area west of Point Conception east to Gaviota using a combination of seismic instruments.

The summit of the Santa Ana volcano contains an acid lake where hot springs, gas bubbling and intense fumarolic emissions occur. A volcanic plume, usually driven by the NE trades, may be seen rising up to 500 m from the summit crater of the Santa Ana volcano. The goal of this study is to provide a multidisciplinary approach for the volcanic surveillance by means of performing geochemical continuous monitoring of diffuse CO2 emission rate in addition to seismic monitoring. Temporal variations of soil CO2 efflux measured at Cerro Pacho dome, Coatepeque caldera, by means of the accumulation chamber method and using a CO2 efflux continuous monitoring station developed by WEST Systems (Italy). From May 2001 till May 2002, CO2 efflux ranged from 4.3 to 327 gm-2d-1, with a median value of 98 and a quartile range of 26 gm-2d-1. Two distinct diffuse CO2 degassing periods have been observed: (1) an increasing trend from May to July 2001, and (2) a stationary period from November 2001 to May 2002. The increasing-trend period may be due to the anomalous plume degassing at the Santa Ana volcano during 2001 and soon after the January and February 2001 earthquakes. Temporal variations of CO2 efllux during the second period seem to be coupled with those of barometric pressure and wind speed at different time scales, though most of the variance is contained at diurnal and semi-diurnal frequencies. These observations can help to explain the existence of a persistent behavior (Hurst exponent, H=0.934 +/- 0.0039) within the diffuse CO2 degassing phenomena. However, further observations are in progress to understand the long-term memory of diffuse CO2 degassing at the Santa Ana volcanic complex.\n\nCMB-13 research on carbon and graphite\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSmith, M.

F.; Gomez-Hermosillo, C. M.; Venegas-Garcia, D. J.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nSanta Maria del Oro Lake ( SMO) (21.37Â° N, 104.57Â° W; 750 m a.s.l.) is a quaternary crater-lake located at western Mexico in the natural border between two geological provinces: the plio-quaternary Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the oligo-miocenic silicic volcanic province Sierra Madre Occidental. SMO, a tropical freshwater lake, is a warm-monomictic lake having a diameter of ca. 2 km and a mean depth at the depocenter of ca. 60 m, where three benthos cores were recovered. Contents of POP' s, total inorganic carbon (TIC), total organic carbon (TOC) and heavy metals were analyzed. Geochemistry and mineralogy also were studied in shallow sediments which corresponded to the decade of 50-60's, otherwise the beginning of industrial development of central Mexico; which is considered the possible source of emission of POP' s and heavy metals. Dioxin, furan, plaguicides and PCB' s contents were analyzed by a GC-MS applying USEPA methods. In the first 40 cm (n= 20) of the sedimentary column ( SC) the absence of POP' s was evidenced, applying a method detection limit ( MDL) of 5 Î¼ g/ml for dioxin, furan and PCB' s. For plaguicides like chlordane and toxaphene the MDL was 0.5 Î¼ g/ml and for plaguicides like DDT, aldrin, endrin, dieldrin, heptachlore and mirex the MDL was 5 Î¼ g/ml. The MDL for HCB was 1 Î¼ g/ml. The average (n= 30) for TIC, TOC and total carbon (TC) for the first 40 cm of the SC is as follows: TIC 2.4 %, TOC 3.7 % and TC 6.12 %. The average (n= 20) content (in ppm) of heavy metals for the first 20 cm of the SC is as follows: As 5.97, Cr 27.54, Cu 16.31, Ni 12.29, Pb 21.35 and Zn 82.46. These contents are roughly similar to the clarke of these metals in volcanic rocks. After the criteria of severe effect level ( SEL) of heavy metal in sediments, the content of these metals is below SEL levels. These results permit us to conclude that the sediments of SMO can be considered in unaffected state with respect to antropogenic contamination like POP' s and heavy\n\nHurricane Maria Puerto Rico Landsat Analysis\n\nDOE Data Explorer\n\nFeng, Yanlei; Chambers, Jeff [LBNL; Negron-Juarez, Robinson [LBNL; Patricola, Chris; Clinton, Nick; Uriarte, Maria; Hall, Jaz; Collins, William\n\n2018-01-01\n\nHurricane Maria made landfall as a strong Category 4 storm in southeast Puerto Rico on September 20th, 2018. The powerful storm traversed the island in a northwesterly direction causing widespread destruction. This study focused on a rapid assessment of Hurricane Marias impact to Puerto Ricos forests. Calibrated and corrected Landsat 8 image composites for the entire island were generated using Google Earth Engine for a comparable pre-Maria and post-Maria time period that accounted for phenology. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) using image-derived end members was carried out on both composites to calculate the change in the non-photosynthetic vegetation (Delta-NPV) spectral response, a metric that quantifies the increased fraction of exposed wood and surface litter associated with tree mortality and crown damage from the storm. Hurricane simulations were also conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model to estimate wind speeds associated with forest disturbance. Dramatic changes in forest structure across the entire island were evident from pre- and post-Maria composited Landsat 8 images. A Delta-NPV map for only the forested pixels illustrated significant spatial variability in disturbance, with patterns that associated with factors such as slope, aspect and elevation. An initial order-of-magnitude impact estimate based on previous work indicated that Hurricane Maria may have caused mortality and severe damage to 23-31 million trees. Additional field work and image analyses are required to further detail the impact of Hurricane Maria to Puerto Rico forests. A minor update to this dataset was posted on April 20, 2018.

A joint U.S./Japan science team is responsible for validation and calibration of the instrument and the data products. The broad spectral coverage and high spectral resolution of ASTER will provide scientists in numerous disciplines with critical information for surface mapping, and monitoring of dynamic conditions and temporal change. Example applications are: monitoring glacial advances and retreats; monitoring potentially active volcanoes; identifying crop stress; determining cloud morphology and physical properties; wetlands evaluation; thermal pollution monitoring; coral reef degradation; surface temperature mapping of soils and geology; and measuring surface heat balance.

This is examined using the spherical harmonic representations of the Clementine topography and Lunar Prospector gravity data. It is demonstrated that the floors of both circular and noncircular maria significantly deviate from an equipotential surface. Deeper circular maria and the deeper part of the noncircular Mare Tranquillitatis have been subsided under larger mass loads in the crust. We calculate the mass beneath the maria to be in excess to the mass required for isostatic compensation of the topography at 60 km depth. A global map of this excess mass shows that the noncircular maria are isostatica"
