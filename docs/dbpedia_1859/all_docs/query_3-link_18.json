        "text": "Explore at your own pace with a private vehicle, driver and English-speaking guide at your service. This exclusive tour is designed to allow you the chance to customize your time ashore and discover the most interesting sights in the comfort and privacy of your own vehicle. With your private vehicle, and the personalized attention of your driver and English-speaking guide, you will have the flexibility and independence to design your itinerary ashore according to your own interests, and take in the sights at your own pace. See the famous sights, or go beyond to create your own intimate connections and unique cultural encounters. Recommended for the single/solo traveler, couples, family, friends, and special interest groups traveling together. It can also be an excellent choice for guests with mobility limitations.\n\nCapacity: 2 guests. Your private party may be of any size up to the maximum capacity.\n\nPlease note: Private cars are ordered per vehicle (not per person), so only one person in the party needs to order the vehicle. The price shown is the total cost for the vehicle, driver, and English-speaking guide. Entrance fees for attractions are not included. In many destinations, the number of vehicles available is extremely limited, so guests are encouraged to secure their private vehicle reservation as early as possible."
