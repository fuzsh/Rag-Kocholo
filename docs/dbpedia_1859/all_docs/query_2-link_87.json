        "text": "The plenary session of the La Laguna City Council will address in the ordinary session tomorrow Thursday a motion to agree to use the historical shield of La Laguna, symbol of the collective identity of the municipality, in all acts, documents, official communications, and signage in that the municipality, the city or its institutional representation be represented.\n\nThe motion, elevated to the Plenary Session by councilor Santiago Pérez, takes a historical tour of the founding of the city and recalls that since 1510 the granting of private arms to the city was granted to put them on its seals and flags, a shield whose oldest sample is the one that currently exists on the cover of the Corregidor’s house.\n\nThe motion recalls that this symbol disappeared from the day to day of the X¡Corporación after La Laguna was awarded the title of Historical Heritage of Humanity in 1999, turning the Rose of the Winds into the corporate identity of the City Council, when it should only be of the historic center, “a decision that was stolen from the Plenary through a series of agreements of the Government Commission of 2001.”\n\nThe document presented to the plenary session for its approval highlights that “the recognition of the symbols that end up becoming our historical heritage is not born from a social vacuum, from a distancing of society from those symbols that have endured throughout the centuries constituting what they are today.”\n\nFor this reason, “taking into account the great importance that should be given to the shield as a consolidated symbol of the historical-cultural heritage”, its recovery is proposed."
