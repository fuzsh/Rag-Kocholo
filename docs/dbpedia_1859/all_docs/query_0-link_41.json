        "text": "[FONT=&quot]15 APRIL[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 3 of 3[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2013 – Scott Miller, singer, songwriter and guitarist, best known for his work as leader of the 1980s band Game Theory and 1990s band The Loud Family, and as the author of a 2010 book of music criticism, dies at age 53 (sucide). He was described by the New York Times as \"a hyperintellectual singer and songwriter who liked to tinker with pop the way a born mathematician tinkers with numbers\", having \"a shimmery-sweet pop sensibility, in the tradition of Brian Wilson and Alex Chilton.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2014, Omnivore Recordings began releasing a series of reissues of Miller's entire Game Theory catalog, which had for decades been out of print. A biography of Miller by Brett Milano was published in October 2015, and Miller's posthumously completed Game Theory album, Supercalifragile, is expected in early 2017.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Scott Miller was born in Sacramento, California in 1960. He was of Scottish and Irish ancestry, and his mother's family had lived in the Sacramento area since at least the 1850s California Gold Rush.[4]:89 His father, Vaughn Miller, was an Army veteran of World War II who had a long career working for the State of California.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Miller was an only child, whose musical interests began \"sometime as a six or seven year old, listening to the Monkees and the Beatles\". However, his earliest musical influences were wider-ranging, springing from his father's \"immense record collection – lots of Broadway show tunes. But the things I was really interested in were these New York folk scene records ... the Womenfolk being really prototypical. And after that it was the Beatles all the way. They were gods walking the earth to me.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]At age nine, while taking folk and classical guitar lessons from Tiny Moore, Miller was writing \"little albums' worth\" of derivative songs, and started his first band, innocently calling it \"The Monkees.\" He later noted, \"We were really little kids, and we didn't realize you had to have your own personality... I was Mike Nesmith, of course,\" naming the serious Monkee known as a songwriter. By 1971, Miller's lessons switched to rock guitar, and he \"had pretty serious bands from seventh grade on.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]While attending Rio Americano High School, he and his longtime friend and bandmate Jozef Becker formed bands called Lobster Quadrille, Mantis, and Resistance, as well as the first version of Alternate Learning. Miller began recording his music at age 15, when he got his first TEAC multitrack recording machine. He reminisced in 1993, \"Writing songs like the Beatles and trying to obtain real equipment – that's been my goal in life since I can remember.\" Some of Miller's early recordings from 1975 to 1979 were released in the 1990s to his fan club as a cassette called Adolescent Embarrassment-Fest; several others appear as bonus tracks on the 2014 CD reissue of Blaze of Glory (1982).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Another passion of Miller's youth was art. Until college, he noted, \"I was extremely serious about being a visual artist, and only so-serious about doing music. I was producing really bad music and really good art.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Miller's first band to release commercial recordings, Alternate Learning (also known as ALRN), released its self-titled 7\" EP in 1979, and a full-length LP called Painted Windows in 1981, on Rational Records. Alternate Learning was formed in 1977 in Sacramento, moved in 1978 to Davis, California, and performed frequently at U.C. Davis and in the Bay Area until the group was disbanded by Miller in 1982.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Miller's first band to release commercial recordings, Alternate Learning (also known as ALRN), released its self-titled 7\" EP in 1979, and a full-length LP called Painted Windows in 1981, on Rational Records. Alternate Learning was formed in 1977 in Sacramento, moved in 1978 to Davis, California, and performed frequently at U.C. Davis and in the Bay Area until the group was disbanded by Miller in 1982.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Among the practical obstacles that stood in the way of the group's success, Game Theory experienced substantial turnovers of personnel after three of their five studio albums were recorded, which disrupted promotional plans and concert tours following the releases of Real Nighttime, The Big Shot Chronicles, and Two Steps from the Middle Ages. The release of Two Steps was said to be plagued by difficulties, which included Miller's breakup with Thayer. After Thayer left to form Hex with Steve Kilbey of The Church, LaFreniere and Gassuan also left the group. In addition, Enigma Records, which distributed Game Theory's records, folded in 1989 soon after the release of Two Steps.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Game Theory continued to tour in 1989 and 1990, with Michael Quercio of The Three O'Clock (who had produced Game Theory's Distortion EP) joining as a member, along with Jozef Becker. Prior to the 1989 tour, Gil Ray sustained a serious back injury that left him temporarily unable to play drums; he switched to guitar and keyboards, but left the group in 1990. In 1990, Miller recruited original member Nancy Becker to rejoin the group for its final released recordings, in which new versions of three songs (including one previously recorded by Alternate Learning) were recorded for Game Theory's best-of compilation CD, Tinker to Evers to Chance (1990).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Game Theory's releases have long been out of print and difficult to find, contributing to the band's inability to transcend what Miller described as \"national obscurity, as opposed to regional obscurity.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After Miller's death, surviving members of Game Theory reunited on July 20, 2013, for a memorial tribute performance in Sacramento.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]With a new line-up in 1991 and a new recording label, Miller retired the name Game Theory and chose to call his new group The Loud Family. Rolling Stone described this name as both \"a hip allusion to the mid-Seventies PBS series An American Family\" and \"a clever way to describe the sound and feel of the band. Either way, it's a great hook—smart, funny and instantly memorable. All of which, appropriately enough, are qualities shared by Miller's songs.\" Miller later described his intended reality-show metaphor: \"Going through life is a lot like having cameras on you and you have to perform, but there's no script; you just have to do the normal kind of bumbling thing. Besides, it had the word 'loud' in it.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Stereo Review, by way of introducing The Loud Family and eulogizing Game Theory, called Miller \"an entity unto himself, taking dictation from a mind working overtime without stopping to consider the possibility of success or banishment. Problem is, [while] others have squeezed through the needle's eye to varying degrees ... Miller still labors in semi-obscurity, his back catalog bulging like Ph.D. theses interred in some musty corner of a rarely visited library.\" Assessing Miller's prospects of success, the article continued:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Let's face it: Smart rock doesn't sell. Despite the best efforts of critics, despite the support of introspective, collegiate humanities majors who have assimilation problems, even despite the soft spot certain record companies occasionally show for music with a brain, the market share is marginal. Therefore, to persevere at making hyperliterate music that has complex motives and is densely constructed—relative to the immediate sparkle and shine of mainstream chart music, that is—is an act of bravery, commitment, or lunacy.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The Loud Family debuted on Alias Records in 1993 with Plants and Birds and Rocks and Things, produced by Mitch Easter. The album was later acclaimed by Aimee Mann as \"one of the five best records ever made.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]From 1991 until Miller's death in 2013, The Loud Family released six studio LPs and one live LP. They were also the subject of a concert video documentary, released on DVD in 2003, which chronicled the group's final concert tour in 2000, in support of the album Attractive Nuisance.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In a 2003 book, Sonic Cool: The Life & Death of Rock 'n' Roll, The Loud Family was cited as \"perhaps the most sophisticated 'pop' band that ever lived.\" According to author Joe Harrington, \"the songs are beautiful, but they inevitably lampoon some aspect of the culture with biting accuracy. It's the perfect juxtaposition between old/new Pop/Punk that makes The Loud Family simply too good to be true in this day and age.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2002, Aimee Mann undertook a still-unreleased collaboration with Miller on an acoustic album, which was recorded by Miller for her SuperEgo label, and which remained unfinished at his death. Miller indicated in late 2003 that he and Mann had \"done each other's songs and written one together,\" and that the project was \"halfway through,\" but \"might be on permanent hold.\" In 2006, Miller stated that he would \"love to finish the thing with Aimee Mann, maybe in altered form,\" stating that he and Mann still discussed the project.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In May 2014, Mann told an interviewer that she and Miller had been trying to make \"an acoustic record where we were both singing basically my favorite songs of his, and somehow the hard drive got lost.\" Mann added that she had \"no idea where that record is,\" and that she had been \"really crushed\" upon hearing of Miller's death.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]On July 14, 2014, Omnivore Recordings announced their commitment to reissue Game Theory's recordings, remastered from the original tapes. Noting that Miller's work with Game Theory had been out of print and \"missing for decades,\" Omnivore stated that they were \"pleased to right that audio wrong\" with a series of expanded reissues of the group's catalog. The reissue series is produced by Pat Thomas, Dan Vallor (Game Theory's tour manager and sound engineer during the 1980s), and Grammy-winning reissue producer Cheryl Pawelski.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The first in the series, an expanded version of Game Theory's 1982 debut album Blaze of Glory, was released in September 2014, on CD and on pink vinyl. The reissue was supplemented with 15 bonus tracks (four from Alternate Learning, and 11 previously unissued recordings). Omnivore's November 2014 expanded reissue of Dead Center, on CD only, included material from the Game Theory EPs Pointed Accounts of People You Know (1983) and Distortion (1984), which Omnivore reissued on vinyl only. The reissue of Real Nighttime (1985), the first of Game Theory's albums to be produced by Mitch Easter, was released in March 2015.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In February 2016, nearly 30 years after its initial release, the double album Lolita Nation was remastered and reissued by Omnivore, with 21 bonus tracks that included the previously unreleased full 8-minute version of \"Chardonnay,\" alternate mixes of other album tracks, and live covers of songs by artists such as David Bowie, the Modern Lovers, and the ... Pistols.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Miller's record label, 125 Records, revealed after Miller's death in April 2013 that he had made plans to reunite in the summer of 2013 with some of his old bandmates to record a new Game Theory album, Supercalifragile, that band's first since Two Steps from the Middle Ages in 1988.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In September 2015, Miller's wife Kristine Chambers announced that she and Ken Stringfellow had teamed to produce a finished recording from the source material for Supercalifragile that Miller had left behind in various stages of completion, \"including fully-formed songs and many other ideas, sketches, lyrics, even musical gestures and snippets of found sound.\" Additional recording took place at Abbey Road Studios in London, in the summer of 2015. A preliminary decision to release the album under Scott Miller's name, using the title I Love You All, was later reconsidered in favor of Miller's original plans for a Game Theory project.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]On May 5, 2016, it was announced that the project, now under Miller's planned title Supercalifragile as the sixth and final Game Theory album, would be released in early 2017. A Kickstarter campaign, created to fund the pressing and other expenses involved with completing the album, was fully funded within two weeks.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Participants in Supercalifragile included Aimee Mann, who had written in July 2015, \"I'm working on this song I wrote with Scott Miller, and hearing him sing it in my headphones is possibly the most devastatingly heartbreaking thing I've ever experienced.\" Mann's announcement was accompanied by a photo of sheet music bearing the title, \"No Love.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Other friends and former collaborators whose involvement was announced included Jon Auer of the Posies, Anton Barbeau, Peter Buck of R.E.M., Doug Gillard, Nina Gordon, Scott Kannberg, Ted Leo, Stéphane Schück, and Will Sheff. Former members of Game Theory and The Loud Family collaborating in the production included Michael Quercio and Jozef Becker, with performances by Suzi Ziegler, Dave Gill, Nan Becker, Donnette Thayer, and Gil Ray. Former Game Theory producer Mitch Easter was brought in to handle the final mixing of the album.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Miller was long described as a cult favorite with little commercial success, resulting in reviews with such superlatives as \"critically acclaimed and quite underrated,\" \"the most criminally unknown songwriter/performer/all-around Rock Genius in America today,\" \"one of America's most underappreciated songwriters\", \"the most underrated pop genius in music history,\" and \"America's most consistently underrated singer-songwriter ... producing album after album of hook-laden and profoundly literate rock-and-roll.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Rolling Stone, in a 1993 review, suggested that \"mostly it's because his songs, though insinuatingly tuneful, can be maddeningly oblique, fleshing out each verse with abstruse references to long-forgotten pop songs and TV shows; at times, the results sound like Thomas Pynchon writing for Big Star.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Rock critic Robert Christgau wrote that \"Scott Miller was a prototypical '80s rock artist—serious, playful, skillful, obscure, secondhand.\" Christgau criticized Miller's musical obsessions and literary obscurities as \"rendering the ostensibly public essentially private,\" adding, \"Adepts recommend 1987's Lolita Nation, which is said to make sense, though I don't know exactly what sense.\" He also offered mild praise for Game Theory's \"Mitch Easter-produced albums,\" which he likened to \"dreams of the early dB's ... which isn't to say Miller and cohorts didn't also develop a groove as they got older,\" referring to Two Steps from the Middle Ages as an \"excessive\" and \"funkier\" album that \"I kinda like\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In a 1993 interview with Miller, Option wrote that success was a touchy subject for him, quoting Miller's joking example of a typical review: \"Nothing good ever happens to Scott Miller, but somehow he's managed to drag his broken body into a studio one more time and make another album.\" Miller continued that he was \"past the point of fighting\" discussions of how \"arty or brainy\" he was, but had hoped for greater emphasis \"on what the songs are about—be it the boy-.... situation, or being depressed about some key failure I've had, or getting a little bit of understanding about life.\" In another 1993 interview, Miller mused:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] I don't think I'm in danger of making albums that don't age well, because I haven't ever fit into the times spectacularly well. I've always been aware of myself drawing on a musical vocabulary so broad that a lot of people don't get what I consider to be my real songwriting coups. I think they go right past a lot of people. The bad part of that is I probably won't become a big star. But the good part is that I don't think people will find the albums less useful over time. They'll sound as good in 2004 as they will in 1994.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2012, more than a year before Miller's death, The Guardian wrote, \"Scott Miller was always a little too out of time for his own good, which means his towering talent is near forgotten\", attributing Miller's cult status to the contradictions of \"pretty but muscular pop, characterised by a mix of acoustic and electric guitars, by literate but often non-specific lyrics, by keyboard sounds and production techniques that were sometimes unfortunately era-specific, by Miller's sometimes quavering and uncertain voice. Too spiky for the chart kids; too smooth for the alternative kids—the curse of Scott Miller was being only himself, rather than finding a movement or a trend he could be part of.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Miller's own description of his high tenor vocals as a \"miserable whine\" or \"my usual obnoxious vocals\" was sometimes repeated by reviewers of his work in Game Theory, who often added balancing comments, such as \"while he's fond of referring to his voice as a 'miserable whine,' he sure knows how to make it communicate.\" In many reviews, Miller's self-deprecation was outweighed by critical praise for his talents in vocal phrasing, inventiveness, and musical ambition. Stephin Merritt cited Miller's \"swooping melodies, large vocabulary lyrics dense with idiom and metaphor,\" and \"gloriously catchy hooks.\" According to Pitchfork writer Matt LeMay, Miller \"had a singular way of making unexpected and counterintuitive chord changes sound downright inevitable.\" Music journalist Kent Williams added, \"What marks Miller's songs as unique is his obsession with coming up with a perfect, and perfectly new chord progression. Like his hero Alex Chilton, he had a fondness for accessible pop music that had lots of moving parts under the hood. Lyrically, he was both class clown and over-achiever. He wanted words as devious and pretty as the best lyrics of Stephen Sondheim and Jerry Leiber, but shot through with almost Joycean obscurity and puckish humor.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]According to Professor Stephen Burt of Harvard University, Miller often wrote \"songs about overthinking it, anthems for people who think they think too much and try too hard, who feel at home (if they ever do) only among like-mindedly wordy souls. The tension in Miller's songs—it's never resolved—between guitar-driven pop and keyboard-based New Wave is like the tension between heart and mind, between a nerdy identity never fully embraced and a fear of something more.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After the publication of his book in 2010, Miller's name was cited as \"synonymous with thinking people's pop. Pithy, smart and nearly mathy in his mixing of the avant garde with earnest pop precision, he earned his stripes with comparisons to Big Star's Alex Chilton, but surpassed his influences by crafting his own genre of IQ rock, sporting songs with ... increasingly unpredictable-yet-gorgeous arrangements.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2013, MTV wrote of \"Miller's indelible output\" and \"Game Theory's transcendent tunes\" as \"his legacy ... ready and waiting for discovery.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Spin wrote that Miller's influence as a songwriter outreached his fame. Miller was credited as an influential force in the 1980s- and 1990s-era music scenes, beginning in Northern California with bands associated with the Paisley Underground genre, and later influencing better-known independent pop artists. In 1996, Aimee Mann stated that \"Scott Miller is the best songwriter out there, in my opinion. I often think about that when I'm writing: 'Would Scott think this song is any good?'\" adding \"Scott's definitely better than me.\" Mann confirmed more than a decade later, \"I was very influenced by Scott Miller's songwriting,\" and \"musically, he was a really big influence.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]According to MTV, Miller's work with Game Theory in the 1980s remained \"still visceral and vital\" in 2013, \"influencing a new generation of indie artists.\" Significant musicians who have praised Miller's talent and enduring influence on their work include The New ....ographers' leader A.C. Newman, Okkervil River's Will Sheff, Charles Bissell of the Wrens, Doug Gillard, and Ted Leo, each of whom performed at a New York City tribute to Miller on June 29, 2013, as well as Veruca Salt's Nina Gordon, the Posies' Ken Stringfellow, and Camper Van Beethoven's Jonathan Segel, each of whom appeared on Loud Family albums as guest musicians. Many other artists inspired by Miller's music found greater commercial success than Miller; among those cited are Jellyfish, Velvet Crush, Matthew Sweet, Ben Folds, Guided by Voices, and Michael Penn.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Miller was acknowledged by Irish rock group The Revenants in their 1999 song \"Scott Miller Said,\" which opens by quoting Miller's \"Andy in Ten Years,\" from Lolita Nation. Music critic Nick Kelly, writing for Ireland's largest newspaper, named \"Scott Miller Said\" as the \"greatest ever Irish rock song.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In January 2014, Spin led an article with: \"The legacy of Scott Miller, the former Game Theory and The Loud Family power-pop songsmith who died early last year, just got that much more impressive,\" crediting Miller for bringing Ted Leo to the attention of Aimee Mann, on the occasion of the release of Mann and Leo's first studio release together as The Both. Their song \"Bedtime Stories,\" which appears on The Both (2014), was written about Miller as an expression of mourning and as \"a musical salute... consciously a tribute to him, especially the chord progression of the chorus, which is very, very Loud Family.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A biography by rock critic Brett Milano, Don't All Thank Me At Once: The Lost Genius of Scott Miller, was published in October 2015. Milano described his book as one that not only tells Miller's story, but also explores \"the college and indie-rock explosion of the 1980s and 1990s,\" and how some influential artists \"managed to fall through the cracks.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Scott Miller was the author of Music: What Happened?, a book of music criticism published in 2010, which Billboard called \"a well-received critical overview of 53 years of rock history.\" In second and third editions of the book, Miller's 2010 chapter and 2011 chapter were added.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The book's cover art established a knowledgeable but humorous tone by featuring photographs of Miller in poses that recreated noteworthy album covers such as that of Liz Phair's Exile in Guyville. Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that Miller's \"encyclopedic knowledge of pop,\" upon which his music drew, made the book a \"shining example of the auteur ideal ... a year-by-year, song-by-song journey from 1957 to this decade, connecting the dots for a macro-perspective on pop.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]For each year, Miller wrote about ten or more of his favorite songs, providing analytical insights and placing the songs in context in the musical world of their era. Miller had kept annual countdown lists of his favorite records throughout his life, and his personal project of compiling those lists onto CDs evolved into a formal endeavor to explain what made those songs noteworthy, for what was then the last 50 years of recorded music. The writing process started in 2006, when Miller took a hiatus from music making after the release of What If It Works?. Portions of the book were serially published in draft form on Miller's official web site, where Miller responded to fan requests by writing about one year at a time, in random order.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Reacting to the state of pop music criticism, Miller identified a major issue as critics' failure to \"credit an artist with getting a feeling across.\" Based on past experience as an artist receiving criticism, Miller argued against critics' efforts to maintain journalistic distance or objectivity, suggesting that \"acknowledging and respecting readers' stylistic boundaries and keeping their own sentimentality in check\" was counterproductive, and hypothesizing that instead, \"readers actually want a critic to be their friend by listening through stylistic boundaries with special gold-seeking ears, and reporting how they unexpectedly turned into a love-struck adolescent over a vocal harmony or a piano run... digging the truth of musical experience out from under half-asleep habits of discussing it.\" Miller further proposed \"more music talk in music criticism\" and suggested that readers would appreciate \"sensitively modest doses\" of musical analysis to support a conclusion \"that great melody writing occurred or it didn't.\" For example, Miller noted that critics rarely \"identify catchy melodies as specific passages within a song,\" in the way that working musicians might discuss \"the A-minor in the second measure of the chorus.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In response to the book, rock critic Robert Christgau wrote, \"The way [Miller] describes the songs he loves... is tremendously suggestive. If only he or some acolyte could spin a worldview around those observations, we might really have something to go on.\" Musician Stephin Merritt wrote that Miller \"manages actual humor (a first in music criticism) and major insights that may change the way you think about, for example, 1967. Almost a new art form.\" In a book review in Ugly Things magazine, Miller was described as \"a sort of fourth-generation rock and roll renaissance man capable of making the printed page jump and sing as deftly as the complex conversations that his Les Paul conducts with a Marshall stack.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]From 1997 until 2010, Miller periodically wrote on subjects ranging from music to philosophy, theology, physics, and poetry, at Ask Scott, a section of his official web site. His initial offer to respond to emailed questions from fans became for him \"a fun exercise\" to attempt an honest answer to any question, regardless of the level of his expertise in the subject.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]According to writer Franklin Bruno, Miller's responses were \"by turns quick-witted, earnest and appreciative, politely deflecting, and self-deprecating\", sometimes openly struggling with \"resignation and bitterness about his music career.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Miller attended University of California, Davis, intending to study art. After switching majors, he graduated with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and obtained a full-time job in LISP compiler development at Lucid Inc., with several future Loud Family bandmates. Of this period, Miller stated in an interview that his employers \"let me go whenever I have to do band stuff, which is very big of them.\" Miller described his job situation as \"kind of a carrot in front of me and a boot behind me,\" acknowledging that his engineering work was highly paid, and noting his need to make a living.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After Lucid's dissolution in 1994, Miller was a manager and software developer at Objectivity, where he became Director of Development and Technical Publications. From 2011 until his death, Miller was a lead engineer at MarkLogic.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]U.S. Patent 7,761,475 was issued to Miller on July 20, 2010, as the inventor of a technique for object-oriented database management.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Miller lived in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife Kristine and their two daughters. On April 15, 2013, Miller committed suicide at the age of 53. In response to Miller's unexpected death, friends and bandmates established a memorial fund for the education of Miller's children.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2013 – David Ewan \"Dave\" McArtney, New Zealand musician and songwriter, dies at age 62.

McArtney started studying law before forming Hello Sailor with Harry Lyon and Graham Brazier. He died in his home in Point Chevalier, Auckland.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After Hello Sailor disbanded in 1980, McArtney formed the Pink Flamingos with Dragon keyboard player and songwriter Paul Hewson(not Bono) and a revolving line-up of players. McArtney was signed to Polygram records and released their debut album Dave McArtney & The Pink Flamingos in 1981. Paul Hewson left the band, which then released the EP Remember The Alamo and extensively toured New Zealand. The band then relocated to Sydney and signed to Polygram Australia, releasing their second album We Never Close in 1982. Later that year the group disbanded, with McArtney moving to London.

He is best known as the lead singer of Little Joe & The Thrillers, whose song \"Peanuts\" reached No. 22 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1957.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was born in South Philadelphia, and started singing in church. His mother, Annie Hall, was a locally well-known blues singer and his grandmother was a Baptist preacher. By the time he was 12, he and three cousins had formed a gospel vocal quartet, the Evening Stars, who had a one-hour weekly radio show in Philadelphia. Cook was noted for his falsetto singing as well as his personality, and first recorded in 1949. In 1951 the group recorded \"Say A Prayer for the Boys In Korea\" for Apex Records. He also worked in shipbuilding for the US Navy, and as a delivery driver.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the early 1950s Cook decided to make the transition to secular rhythm and blues music, later declining an offer to join The Soul Stirrers after Sam Cooke left. He formed a new doo-... vocal group, the Thrillers, with Farrie Hill (second lead), Richard Frazier (tenor), Donald Burnett (baritone), and Henry Pascal (bass). They won a contract with OKeh Records in 1956, and their first single, \"Do the Slop\", was a regional hit in Philadelphia and New York City. The song introduced a new dance craze, and the group performed at the Apollo Theater.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The group's second single, \"Peanuts\", was written by Cook and again featured his falsetto as the lead. Released in 1957, it won the group an appearance on American Bandstand, and rose to No. 22 on the national pop chart, though it failed to make the R&B chart. Cook's falsetto singing style was reportedly an influence on singers Frankie Valli, who recorded \"Peanuts\" with The Four Seasons, and Lou Christie.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Later recordings by the group were less successful, though they continued to release singles on the OKeh label until 1961. After a brief stay with 20th Century Records, the group broke up. Cook began performing solo, and toured with B. B. King and Bobby \"Blue\" Bland. He also formed a group, The Sherrys, with his daughters, Delthine and Dinell Cook and their friends Charlotte Butler and Delores \"Honey\" Wylie. Their record \"Pop Pop Pop-Pie\" reached No. 25 on the R&B chart in 1962. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Cook moved to Boston in the late 1960s, and continued to perform in clubs. He had a residency at the Cantab Lounge in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from 1980 until he retired in 2007, being voted the region's Best Local R&B Performer in 2002.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was survived by his wife Joanne and six children.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2015 – Margo Reed, American blues singer and the sister of blues singer Francine Reed, dies at age 73 from complications of Alzheimer's. In 2000, she was named Female Vocalist of the Year by Arizona Jazz magazine. She was inducted into the Arizona Blues Hall of Fame in 2004 and received the Jazz in Arizona Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Her 60-year career began in Illinois where she and the family traveled on a Mennonite gospel circuit. Margo's voice was honed for all styles of singing, and her personal favorite was Mahalia Jackson's \"Soon We'll Be Done with the Troubles of the World.\" Residents in and around Kankakee remember Margo leading family performances throughout the county that created memories of proms and post-prom parties. The siblings had grown up listening to their father's touring gospel group, learning that music during rehearsals in their home. Margo's style was as memorable and unforgettably unique as those of Billie Holiday, Bessie Smith and Dinah Washington. The joy and passion she infused into her music was exhilarating, a style that delighted longtime fans and fascinated new listeners. The energy and emotion of her vocal style chased away the blues or soothed like a mother's lullaby.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Her CD, \"Margo: Live!\" with the Armand Boatman Trio, recorded October 2000 in concert, earned these rave reviews: \"Sassy . . . s****y . . . approaches perfection\" and \"Soul-stirring. . . a treat for your ears and your heart.\" Margo was named \"Best Female Jazz Vocalist\" by the listeners of KJZZ radio in 2004 and was inducted into the Arizona Blues Hall of Fame that same year. She was voted \"Best Female Jazz Vocalist\" in 2000 by the readers of AZJazz Magazine, the editors noting, \"Margo has hit her stride, performing with grace, style and a deliberateness that signals the best is yet to come.\" She was presented a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007 by Jazz in Arizona, and she was inducted as part of the musical Reed family into the Arizona Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame in 2011. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]She recorded four albums: \"Margo\" (1990), \"Margo Live!\" (2000), \"The Many Facets of Margo Reed\" (2010) and \"Some of My Favorites\" (2012), and was part of the family's a cappella gospel album \"Blood Harmony\" (2005). For 40 years, Margo was a first-call performer in Phoenix for clubs, concerts, festivals, charity events and private parties, especially performing with pianist Buddy Weed in her earliest years. Her club bookings included the Century Sky Room, Tommy's Copa West, Boojum Tree Lounge of the Phoenix Doubletree Inn, Del Webb's TowneHouse, Westward Ho Hotel, Page Four, Timothy's Pub, Tito's, JD's Lounge, Remington's, Mesa Hilton Hotel, Famous Door, Velvet Room, Z'Tejas, A League of Our Own, Kazimierz World Wine Bar and OC Seven. Margo also captivated patrons in Atlanta and Detroit, wowed crowds in San Diego and Denver, and thrilled listeners in Telluride, Colo. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Margo was the first member of the Reed family to come to Phoenix in 1973 with her children, Sheldon and Margo Sherri, the move west recommended by a doctor to ease her son's asthma. She soon was joined by her mother, Girley Reed, and five of her seven siblings: Tony, Lavergne, Michael, Francine (now living in Atlanta, Ga.) and Bucko (Leonard Jr.); sister Mellody later relocated to Arizona, now is living in Southhaven, Miss. Margo's first job, cleaning hotel rooms, led to her continued career in Arizona. A co-worker heard her singing on the job and suggested she sit in at the Century Sky Room. She did and was immediately hired to sing on weekends, but kept her daytime job to support her children. Then she was hired for one night in the Boojum Tree Lounge, performing with pianist Armand Boatman. That led to other local bookings and tours to Seattle, Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe, San Diego, Detroit and Oregon. Margo was a featured entertainer at the Telluride Ski Village in Telluride, Colo., from 1990-93. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]She also performed in Telluride at Garano Peaks, Last Dollar Saloon, Opera House, New Sheridan Hotel, O'Banion's, Moon Saloon and Telluride Ballroom at Mountain Village.

He stayed for thirty years in his hometown of Venice, Italy and worked at the Opera Buffa, at the Chapel of San Marco and at the Grand Opera in Vicenza, he dies at 83. By that time he had become notable throughout Europe and had turned down several opportunities, including offers from the Tsar of Russia. In 1794, he finally moved to London to play in the orchestra of the King's Theatre, and settled there for the remainder of his life. In fifty years, he became a prominent figure in the musical events of the English capital, performing at the concerts of the Philharmonic Society of London as well as in more private events, where he would meet the most influential persons in the country, like the Prince Consort and the Duke of Leinster. He was acquainted with composers Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven, whom he visited on several occasions in Vienna, and to whom he showed the possibilities of the double bass as a solo instrument. His ability on the instrument also demonstrated the relevance of writing scores for the double bass in the orchestra separate from that of the cello, which was the common rule at the time. He is also remembered today for the Dragonetti bow, which he evolved throughout his life.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Dragonetti was born in Venice, Italy of Pietro Dragonetti, a barber and amateur musician, and Caterina Calegari. He began playing the guitar and the double bass by himself on his father's instruments. He was soon noticed by Doretti, a violinist and composer of ball music, who took him along for public performance in Venice. At the age of twelve, he was placed under the tuition of Berini, the best master for the double bass in Venice, who decided after only eleven lessons that he could not teach the boy anything more. At the age of thirteen, Dragonetti was appointed principal player at the Opera Buffa in Venice. At fourteen he was appointed principal double bass player in the Grand Opera Seria at the San Benedetto theatre.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]When about eighteen, in Treviso, he was invited to join the quartet of the Tommasini, and was noticed by Morosini, procurator of San Marco, who indulged him in auditioning for the admission in the Chapel of San Marco. He made a first attempt in 1784, which was lost to Antonio Spinelli. He finally joined the institution on 13 September 1787 as the last of the five double bass players of the Chapel with a yearly income of 25 ducats. He soon became the principal bassist. He later was offered a place by the Tsar of Russia, which was declined and got him a salary raise in the Chapel. He became very famous at the time, started playing solo pieces, which was exceptional at the time for the double bass, and even got elected as of the directors of a musical festival held for the coming of fourteen sovereign princes to the republic of Venice. One of his concertos was particularly remarked by the queen of Naples.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]When in Vicenza for an engagement at the Grand Opera there, he acquired his famous Gasparo da Salò double bass from the Benedictine Nuns of the Convent of San Pietro (La Pieta) in Vicenza, which is now housed in the museum of St Mark's Basilica. He was offered another position to the Tsar of Russia, which he declined after the procurators of St Mark increased his salary to an exceptional 50 ducats. They even granted him a leave for a year, with a continuation in his wages, to go to the King's Theatre in London. That leave was extended for three more years afterwards, but finally Dragonetti never returned to Venice for more than a brief period during the French occupation of the city, 1805-1814.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Dragonetti had no close family, but had many close friends in the musical world in London. The story that he kept and often traveled with a collection of life-sized cloth mannequins, bringing them to his concerts and having them placed in front row seats of theaters, and even introducing one of these dolls as his wife, is completely unsubstantiated. He was an avid collector, and did indeed collect dolls, sometimes taking one along on trips to amuse the children, of whom he was very fond. He never did learn to speak English, expressing himself in a mixture of Italian, English, French and Venetian dialect, but was an astute businessman, and in fact, helped his surviving family in Venice financially. The authoritative source for information on him is the book of Dr. Fiona Palmer, Domenico Dragonetti in England (1794–1846) pub.

After only a few months, he became very famous in London, and his brilliant career was to last till the end.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Later he became intimate with the Prince Consort and the Duke of Leinster. He took part between 1816 and 1842, in forty-six concerts held by the Philharmonic Society of London. At the Italian Opera orchestra, he met the cellist Robert Lindley, who became his close friend and with whom he shared the stand during fifty-two years. They made a specialty at playing Arcangelo Corelli's sonatas.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]At the age of 82, Dragonetti visited Bonn in August 1845 to participate in the 3-day music festival held as part of the inauguration of the Beethoven Monument there. Various major Beethoven works were conducted by Louis Spohr and Franz Liszt.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He died in his Leicester square lodgings at the age of 83 and was buried on 23 April 1846 in the vaults of the Roman Catholic chapel of St Mary, Moorfields. In 1889 his remains were moved to the Roman Catholic cemetery at Wembley. Vincent Novello and Count Carlo Pepoli (librettist of Vincenzo Bellini's I puritani) were among his most famous friends in London.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1791-1792, Joseph Haydn accepted a lucrative offer from German impresario Johann Peter Salomon to visit England and conduct new symphonies with large orchestras. The visit was a huge success and generated some of his best known work. Another trip was therefore scheduled in 1794-1795. On that second occasion, Haydn met Dragonetti, who became a very good friend, and who visited him in Vienna in 1799. On that first trip to Vienna, Dragonetti also met Beethoven in a famous encounter.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"Two new and valuable, though but passing acquaintances were made by Beethoven this year, however - with Domenico Dragonetti, the greatest contrabassist known to history, and Johann Baptist Cramer, one of the greatest pianists. Dragonetti was not more remarkable for his astounding execution than for the deep, genuine musical feeling which elevated and ennobled it. He was now - in the spring of 1799, so far as the means are at hand of determining the time - returning to London from a visit to his native city, Venice, and his route took him to Vienna, where he remained several weeks. Beethoven and he soon met and they were mutually pleased with each other. Many years afterwards Dragonetti related the following anecdote to Samuel Appleby, Esq., of Brighton, England: \"Beethoven had been told that his new friend could execute violoncello music upon his huge instrument and one morning, when Dragonetti called at his room, he expressed the desire to hear a sonata. The contrabass was sent for, and the Sonata, n°2, of Op.5, was selected. Beethoven played his part, with his eyes immovably fixed upon his companion, and, in the finale, where the arpeggios occur, was so delighted and excited that at the close he sprang up and threw his arms around both player and instrument\". The unlucky contrabassists of orchestras had frequent occasions during the next few years to know that this new revelation of the powers and possibilities of their instrument to Beethoven was not forgotten.\" (Alexander Wheelock Thayer, 1967)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]To this day, the mastering of the Beethoven double bass symphonic parts are considered a basic standard for all orchestral double bass players. Dragonetti came back to Vienna for an extensive stay in 1808-1809. On that second trip he became friends with composer Simon Sechter, who would become the court organist in 1824, and professor of composition at the Vienna Conservatorium in 1851. He wrote piano accompaniments to some of his concert pieces, and they maintained a lifelong correspondence. Dragonetti was again in Vienna in 1813 and got to meet once more Beethoven, who had just written Wellington's Victory, to celebrate the victory of Wellington over the French armies of King Joseph Bonaparte at the Battle of Vitoria. The premiere of this work, as well as of Beethoven's seventh symphony was performed on 8 December 1813 in the University's Festsaal, with Dragonetti leading the double basses.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Dragonetti was known for his formidable strength and stamina. It was particularly important at a time when the role of the double bass in the orchestra was to assist the concertmaster in maintaining the cohesion and establishing the tempo. He had huge hands with strong, broad fingers, which allowed him to play with a taller bridge and strings twice as far from the fingerboard as the other bassists.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] The physical quality is his huge hand: endowed, first of all, with prodigious strength so that its grip on the strings of the instrument is the equivalent of the grip of a blacksmith's vice... A hand endowed with five fingers so long, big and agile, that all five, including the bent thumb, go up and down the fingerboard each playing a note. (Caffi, 1855)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]This was not at all standard in these times, as most players used to play - in one position - one note with the index finger, and one with the other three fingers in combination.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Dragonetti was a lover of the fine arts, and a collector of musical instruments as well as many art-related articles, such as original scores and paintings. When he died, the following instruments were dispatched: a giant double bass attributed to Gasparo da Salò and stated to have been used in contemporary performances of Handel's music, which is now conserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London; a very fine Domenico Montagnana Basso di Camara (from Venice); a Gasparo da Salò double bass dated 1590; an Amati double bass; a Maggini double bass; a Stradivarius violin (once played by Paganini), now known as the \"Dragonetti\"; a Guarnerius \"del Gesù\" violin dated 1742, now known as the \"Dragonetti-Walton\"; a Gasparo da Salò violin; two Amati violins; one Lafont violin; a Stradivarius violin copy; 26 unnamed violins; a Gasparo da Salò viola; an Amati viola; a Hill viola; 5 unnamed violas; 6 cellos; a large cello; 3 guitars; 2 bassoons; 3 French horns.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mention is made of this on The Contrabass Shoppe web site which says...[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"There are various stories of how Dragonetti came into possession of the famous Gasparo da Salo bass. The fascinating and highly commendable biography Domenico Dragonetti In England by Fiona M. Palmer (Clarendon Press Oxford 1997) seems to offer the most plausible account. Because of Dragonetti's unprecedented virtuosity as a soloist, attractive offers of work were made from both London and Moscow. As remuneration for renouncing the offers and remaining as principal bassist with the orchestra of the Ducal Chapel of St Mark's in Venice (an orchestra of considerable importance), a decree made in 1791 gave Dragonetti a financial gratuity.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Similarly, it is reputed that Dragonetti was presented with an instrument made by Gasparo da Salo (1542–1609) by the Benedictine nuns who occupied St Peter's monastery in Vicenza where Dragonetti lived and played in the Grand Opera. In the Palmer biography, a footnote refers to a 1906 account by C.P.A. Berenzi, who suggests that the instrument may have been made for the monks of St Peter's, Vicenza, by Gasparo da Salo, and acquired by the procurators of St Mark's to entice Dragonetti to remain in their employ.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]When he left for London in 1795, Dragonetti left many papers and manuscripts, including a Complete system of the double bass, or instruction book for that instrument, containing many elaborate exercises and studies, in the care of a friend. Unfortunately, they were sold and could not be retrieved by their author when he returned to Venice after some years. Today, many of his letters, personal papers, compositions, solos and manuscripts are to be found in the British Library. Some were directly bequeathed by Dragonetti, some were offered by Vincent Novello, and some were bought at auctions.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1849 - Opera \"Il Profeta,\" premieres in Paris.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1858 - Johann Baptist Cramer, Ger/Brit pianist/composer/publisher, dies at 87.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was the son of Wilhelm Cramer, a famous London violinist and conductor, one of a numerous family who were identified with the progress of music during the 18th and 19th centuries.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Cramer was born in Mannheim and was brought to London as a child, where he worked for most of his musical career, lived most of his life, and died.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]From 1782 to 1784, he studied piano under Muzio Clementi and soon became a renowned professional pianist both in London and on the continent. He enjoyed a worldwide reputation, and was particularly appreciated by Beethoven when he visited Vienna, concertized and competed with him. Both were considered the greatest pianists of their time, Beethoven excelling in interpretative expressiveness, Cramer in pure technical perfection. He was the English publisher of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 and is credited with giving it its nickname, \"The Emperor\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Cramer was one of the most renowned piano performers of his day. He met Beethoven in Vienna, initiating a mutually rewarding relationship, while renewing his friendship with Haydn.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After 1800, he was based almost exclusively in England. Following the resoundingly successful example of his former teacher Clementi, he also became a successful music publisher in London.

His business partners were Thomas Frederick Beale and Robert Addison. He ended his personal involvement in the company at the end of 1833, although it retained his name.

They are still considered standard didactic works for piano students.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His music is generally less dramatic and elegant than Clementi's, much less adventurous than Dussek's and far less Romantic in sentiment than Chopin forerunner Field's.

He joined the New Jersey station WJZ in 1921, not just as an announcer but also as a singer, often engaging in recitals with the station's staff pianist, Keith McLeod. By 1927, WJZ had moved to Manhattan and had become the flagship station of the Blue Network of NBC's new national radio network. Cross' voice became familiar as he not only delivered announcements for the Blue Network but also hosted a number of popular programs. Cross was the announcer for the quiz program Information Please and the musical humor show The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street, among others. In the 1940s Cross hosted a Saturday morning show featuring child performers, called Coast To Coast on a Bus.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]From 1931 to 1975 Cross served as host for the weekly live broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera, the job for which he is most remembered. His distinctive voice conveyed the excitement of live performances \"from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City\" for generations of radio listeners. Initially, he broadcast from a seat in \"Box 44\" at the old Metropolitan Opera House at Broadway and 40th Street. In 1966, he introduced the radio audience to the Met's new home at Lincoln Center as he hosted a special broadcast of the opening night performance from a modern radio booth in the new house. For 43 seasons he was the main (usually sole) commentator. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the 1930s he shared some broadcasts with other commentators, such as Deems Taylor, John B. Kennedy and Marcia Davenport, and Robert Woldrop replaced him (for unknown reasons) for the April 3, 1937 broadcast of Das Rheingold and the May 15, 1937 broadcast of Mignon. He also missed two later broadcasts (Rigoletto - February 10, 1973 and Norma - February 17, 1973) due to the death of his wife. Cross never retired but died in New York from a heart attack during the Met season of 1974-75. His first Met broadcast was Hansel and Gretel on December 25, 1931 and his last was of Turandot on December 28, 1974, 43 years and 3 days later. He was succeeded by Peter Allen, who had been his standby announcer.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A native New Yorker, Cross died in New York City where he had lived all his life. He is interred at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Cross edited several popular editions of opera synopses, published in conjunction with the Met broadcasts. He also co-authored (with David Ewen) Milton Cross' Encyclopedia of the Great Composers and their Music – a set of biographies of 78 composers, published in 1953 by Doubleday & Co.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Cross was also featured as narrator on several records, including:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Peter and the Wolf, 4 78-rpm discs, c. 1950, Musicraft Records M 65 302–305[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Milton Cross Explains, 2 discs each, Ottenheimer Publishers/Cabot Records 1958[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] The Instruments of the Orchestra CAB 4021[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] The Magic of Music CAB 4022[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Cross was parodied in Peter Schickele's album, P. D. Q. Bach: The Stoned Guest. Will Jordan played the role of \"Milton Host\", the host, who gave the commentary and told the listener what the synopsis of the act for the opera was. An earlier parody of Cross came in the character of \"Doktor Quilton Foss\" in G.I. Carmen, an all-soldier musical stage production of the U.S. Army. Billed as \"the Boilesk Voishin\" the show toured occupied Europe from June 9, 1945 through January 24, 1946. Again the host, \"Foss\" introduced the show and offered commentary throughout the evenings proceedings.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1898 - Marian Jordan, Peoria Ill, radio comedienne (Fibber McGee and Molly) is born.\n\nin 1901 - Karel Albert, Flemish composer (Marieken van Nymeghen) is born.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1904 - Lily Pons, Draguignan France, soprano diva (Hitting a New High) is born.\n\nA piano student at the Paris Conservatoire, Lily Pons received her first vocal instruction from Alberti de Gorostiaga. She made her operatic début in 1928 at Mulhouse as Lakmé, with Reynaldo Hahn conducting, then sang in French provincial houses as Gretel, Cherubino, Blonde, the Queen of the Night and Mimi. Giovanni Zenatello, who ran the summer seasons at the Arena at Verona and who had become a prominent agent, brought Pons to New York to audition.\n\nGalli-Curci had withdrawn from the Met due to the advancement of a goiter, leaving the colortura throne vacant. Gatti-Casazza was desperately searching for a replacement. Toti dal Monte had been alienated, Pagliughi's figure was considered impossible, and Mercedes Capsir was past her prime. The time was right for a fresh coloratura to step in, but Pons's credentials were so unimpressive that it took a great deal of patience to persuade Gatti-Casazza to listen to her. Pons had a tiny voice, but she looked good and posessed charm and very secure high Es and Fs, so Gatti-Casazza decided to take a gamble.\n\nFor her 1931 début as Lucia, he gave Pons no fanfare whatsoever, not even advance photos for the newspapers. Lanfranco Rasponi describes the event in The Last Prima Donnas: \"The public, totally unprepared, was dazzled by the purity and daring acrobatics of the diminutive voice, which, because of infallible schooling, always managed to reach the last row of the gallery, however big the theater. The mad scene was a triumph, and in the excitement no one could recall how many curtain calls there were.\"\n\nLily Pons Following this sensational début at the Metropolitan, Pons became a star overnight and remained with the company for 28 seasons logging successes as Gilda, Amina, Marie ( La fille du régiment), Philine ( Mignon), Olympia and, above all, Lakmé. In 1935 she sang Rosina at Covent Garden and Gilda and Lucia at the Paris Opéra. She sang in South America, San Francisco, Monte Carlo and Chicago, and made several films. She was married to André Kostelanetz from 1938 to 1958.\n\nShe made her stage farewell at the Metropolitan in 1958 as Lucia. She continued to sing in concert and in 1972, at the age of 68, appeared at Philharmonic Hall in New York City, under the baton of her ex-husband André Kostelanitz. She sang six arias to delirious acclaim, and the concert became part of a television documentary dedicated to her. Lily Pons was diagnosed with cancer in 1976 and died a short time later.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1913 - Constance Shacklock, opera singer is born.\n\nin 1920 - John Conrad Nordqvist, composer, dies at 80.\n\nin 1924 – Rudy Pampill, the saxophonist and longtime bandleader for Bill Haley's Comets, Rudy Pompilli was born in Chester, Pennsylvania, of Italian heritage. A self-taught musician, he joined Ralph Martieri's orchestra in the early Fifties, and in 1953 was voted Best New Saxophonist in a Down Beat magazine poll. While leading a jazz group called The Merry Men in 1953, Pompilli first met Haley who was then managing Chester radio station WPWA. Joining The Comets in September 1955, Pompilli arrived on the heels of their massive hit, 'Rock Around The Clock'. In spite of his conservative, scholarly appearance, Pompilli was an attention grabber, playing his instrument while lying on his back with his feet flailing in the air. Pompilli's first hit with Haley came with the double-sided entry, 'R-O-C-K'/'Rock-A-Beatin' Boogie', and continued with 'See You Later Alligator' (1956), 'Rip It Up' (1956), and 'Rudy's Rock', a sax heavy number written by Pompilli and Ralph Jones, and featured in the film Rock Around The Clock. Like many Fifties rock pioneers, Bill Haley and The Comets soon fell from popularity in the US while remaining in demand in Britain. With Haley moving to Mexico to escape his debts, The Comets were let go in 1962. Returning to Chester, Pennsylvania, Pompilli performed in local night spots. Rejoining Haley in 1964, Pompilli frequently organised new versions of The Comets. But with Haley becoming unreliable, Pompilli and the band were sometimes forced to take the stage without their lead singer. For a time, Pompilli assumed the name Rudy Pell and led his own band, The Happy Days. He fell ill in 1974 during a European tour. Although he attributed his symptoms to the flu, he was diagnosed with lung cancer upon his return to the US. - Died February 5, 1976.\n\n16 APRIL\n\npage 1 of 5[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]16 APRIL\n\n[/FONT][FONT=&quot]page 2 of 5\n\nin 1924 - Henry (Enrico Nicola) Mancini, prolific American composer, conductor, and arranger, is born at Cleveland, Ohio. Mancini revolutionized film and television scoring by introducing elements of jazz and rock 'n' roll into a series of movie and TV productions during the late 1950s and 1960s, notably the Peter Gunn program, Breakfast at Tiffany's, and The Pink Panther, These efforts brought him Academy Award and Emmy nominations resulting in four Oscars, two of them for his songs \"Moon River\" and \"Days of Wine and Roses.\"\n\nSimultaneously, he launched a recording career that found him reaching the charts with 39 albums between 1959 and 1977 and topping the singles charts with his recording of \"Love Theme from Romeo & Juliet.\" His records won him 20 Grammys.\n\nMancini's parents, Quinto and Anna Pece Mancini, were Italian immigrants. His father worked in the steel industry in West Aliquippa, Pa., and played piccolo and flute, which he taught to his son; they played together in the local Sons of Italy band, and Mancini joined the Pa. All-State Band in 1937. Already intent upon a career as a film composer, he began taking piano lessons. When he was 14 or 15 he was sent to Pittsburgh to study piano with Homer Ochsenhardt, then began studying arranging with Max Adkins. Adkins introduced him to Benny Goodman, who accepted one of his arrangements. At the same time, having graduated from high school, he was accepted at the Juilliard School of Music, where he began attending in 1942. He majored in piano, studied with Gordon Stanley. Having turned 18 not long after the U.S. entry into World War II, he was quickly drafted into the Air Force. Glenn Miller arranged to have him assigned to a service band with which he played until 1944, when he was reassigned to the infantry and sent to Europe. Mancini was discharged from the service on March 30,1946, and shortly after, joined the Glenn Miller Orchestra under the direction of Tex Beneke (Miller died in the war).\n\nMancini played piano and wrote arrangements for the band. He became romantically involved with Ginny (Virginia) O'Connor, a member of the Mello-Larks, who sang with the orchestra. When she left to become a session singer in Los Angeles, he followed, marrying her on Sept. 13, 1947; they had three children, Christopher, Monica, and Felice, each of whom worked in the music industry. Mancini spent the years 1947 to 1952 writing music and arrangements for radio shows, bands, and nightclub performers while studying at the Westlake School of Music. Also at this time, Mancini studied with Ernst Krenek, Dr. Alfred Sendry, and Mario Castelnuovo- Tedesco in preparation to become a film composer. When the Mello-Larks were hired to sing in a short film featuring Jimmy Dorsey at Universal-International Pictures, Mancini was brought in as their arranger, which led to a two-week assignment to write music for the Abbott and Costello comedy Lost in Alaska.\n\nHe was then hired as a member of the music department, and over the next six years he composed, arranged, and adapted music for 100 films, most of them low-budget B-pictures. His experience with swing music gave him a natural affinity for the studio's film biography The Glenn Miller Story, one of the biggest box office hits of 1954, which earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Score. His score for the 1956 film Rock, Pretty Baby was released on a soundtrack LP by Decca Records that made the charts in 1957. With the decline of the studio system, Mancini was laid off by Universal in 1958; but producer, director, and screenwriter Blake Edwards, with whom he worked previously, immediately hired him to write music for the television detective show, Peter Gunn. Mancini's theme for the show employed elements of rock 'n' roll, and his music for the individual episodes was jazzstyled.\n\nThe series was successful upon its debut in September, and Ray Anthony, who had scored a hit five years earlier with the theme from the TV series Dragnet, recorded Mancini's \"Peter Gunn\" as a single that reached the Top Ten in February 1959. RCA Victor Records signed Mancini to a recording contract and had him record an album's worth of the music he had written for the series. His debut album, The Music from Peter Gunn, topped the charts in February 1959 and went gold. The series music earned him an Emmy nomination for Best Musical Contribution to a Television Program, and he was nominated for four of the newly instituted Grammy Awards for the album, winning for Album of the Year and Best Arrangement.\n\nHe quickly followed up with a second LP, More Music from Peter Gunn, which reached the Top Ten in June 1959 and earned him an additional six Grammy nominations: Album of the Year; Best Jazz Performance, Group; Best Performance by an Orch.; Best Musical Composition, More Than 5 Minutes; Best Sound Track Album of Background Score for a Motion Picture or TV; and Best Arrangement. Mancini and Edwards teamed for a second television series for the 1959-60 season, Mr. Lucky, about a gambler. The inevitable Music from Mr. Lucky album hit the Top Ten in April 1960, the same month that Mancini's instrumental recording of his theme \"Mr. Lucky\" (lyrics by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans) reached the Top 40. The LP was nominated for three Grammys, winning for Best Performance by an Orch. and Best Arrangement but losing out for Best Soundtrack Album or Recording of Music Score from a Motion Picture or TV. A follow-up album, Mr. Lucky Goes Latin, spent six months in the charts and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Performance by an Orch. for Dancing. Mr. Lucky spent only one season on TV, but Mancini and Edwards returned to filmmaking, launching a director-composer partnership that would result in 26 movies released between 1960 and 1993. The first was a Bing Crosby vehicle, High Time, which opened in September 1960. Marking Peter Gunn's third and final season, Duane Eddy revived \"Peter Gunn\" for a Top 40 hit in October. Mancini's RCA contract called for three albums per year, and in addition to his versions of music he had written for television or film, he also began to record LPs containing his arrangements of music written by others.\n\nThe Blues and the Beat, an album of jazz and blues standards, reached the charts in November 1960 and earned two Grammy nominations: Best Performance by a Band for Dancing and Best Jazz Performance, Large Group, winning in the latter category. Mancini scored three films released in 1961. The Great Impostor appeared in March, accompanied by his recording of the instrumental theme, which reached the singles charts. Bachelor in Paradise opened in November, and its title song, with lyrics by Mack David, was nominated for an Academy Award. But Mancini's major effort of the year was his score for the Blake Edwardsdirected Breakfast at Tiffany's, released in October. The film was a box office hit, and Mancini's Breakfast at Tiffany's LP topped the charts and went gold. \"Moon River\" (lyrics by Johnny Mercer) was sung under the film's credits by Andy Williams and in the film itself by Audrey Hepburn.\n\nBoth Mancini's instrumental recording of the song and a vocal version by Jerry Butler hit the Top Ten in November. At the Academy Awards ceremony, Mancini won best score (Breakfast at Tiffany's) and best song (\"Moon River\") Oscars. At the Grammys his Breakfast at Tiffany's LP was nominated for Album of the Year and won for Best Performance by an Orchestra (for Other than Dancing) and Best Soundtrack Album or Recording of Score from a Motion Picture or TV; his recording of \"Moon River\" won for Record of the Year and Best Arrangement; \"Moon River\" was named Song of the Year. Andy Williams, who had not recorded \"Moon River\" initially, released it on an album, Moon River & Other Great Movie Themes, that reached the Top Ten and went gold. It became his signature song, and he used it as the theme of his television series, The Andy Williams Show.\n\nAlso during 1961, Mancini began to make personal appearances, eventually giving up to 50 concerts a year. He scored four films released in 1962, notably Hatari!, a box office hit released in July, and Days of Wine and Roses, released in December. Lawrence Welk scored a chart entry with \"Baby Elephant Walk\" from Hatari!, and Mancini charted with \"Theme from Hatari!,\" while the Hatari! LP reached the Top Ten, earning four Grammy nominations: \"Sounds of Hatari!\" for Best Original Jazz Composition; \"Baby Elephant Walk\" for Best Instrumental Theme and Best Instrumental Arrangement; and the album as a whole for Best Performance by an Orchestra or Instrumentalist with Orchestra (Not Jazz or Dancing).\n\nThe Blake Edwards-directed Days of Wine and Roses drew its greatest attention for the title song (lyrics by Johnny Mercer), which won the Academy Award for Best Song and the Song of the Year Grammy, while Mancini and Andy Williams, who sang it in the film, each scored Top 40 hits. Mancini's instrumental version won two Grammys: Record of the Year and Best Background Arrangement. In the absence of a Mancini LP of the score, Williams's Days of Wine and Roses album topped the charts and went gold. Mancini had only two film scores released in 1963, which may have afforded him more time for his recordings. Our Man in Hollywood, which hit the Top Ten in March, contained his versions of some of his own and others' film music; it earned a Grammy nomination for Best Performance by an Orchestra or Instrumentalist with Orchestra (Not Jazz or Dancing). Uniquely Mancini, a collection of jazz and R&B standards, was in the Top Ten in June.\n\nMancini had a surprise Top 40 hit in July, as his instrumental \"Tinpanola\" from Mr. Lucky Goes Latin was given a lyric by Al Stillman and recorded by Perry Como as \"(I Love You) Don't You Forget It.\" Mancini's most notable film work of the year came with the December release Charade, one of the year's biggest box office hits. The title song, with lyrics by Johnny Mercer, was an Academy Award nominee, and there were two instrumental versions of it in the Top 40, one by Mancini and the other by Sammy Kaye. Mancini's Charade LP made the Top Ten and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Performance by a Chorus. Of Mancini's five film scores in 1964, the most memorable was Blake Edwards's The Pink Panther, which earned him an Academy Award nomination. His single of \"The Pink Panther Theme\" reached the Top 40 and won three Grammys, for Best Instrumental Composition (Other Than Jazz), Best Instrumental Performance (Other Than Jazz), and Best Instrumental Arrangement.\n\nHis album The Pink Panther hit the Top Ten, went gold, and earned two Grammy nominations, for Album of the Year and Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or TV Show. Blake Edwards quickly followed up the film with a sequel, A Shot in the Dark, released in June, and Mancini's score included the title tune (lyrics by Robert Wells), which he took into the singles charts. In July RCA released the hits collection The Best of Mancini, which went gold. Mancini's next notable film score came with the release of Dear Heart in December.\n\nThe title song (lyrics by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans) earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Song, Grammy nomination for Song of the Year, and was recorded by Andy Williams and Jack Jones for Top 40 hits. Mancini's chart single of the song was nominated for a 1964 Grammy for Best Performance by a Chorus and his Top Ten LP Dear Heart and Other Songs About Love, released later, was nominated for the same award in 1965. Mancini's only film score of 1965 was for Blake Edwards's box office hit The Great Race. From it came the song \"The Sweetheart Tree\" (lyrics by Johnny Mercer); it was nominated for an Academy Award. Johnny Mathis and Mancini had chart singles with the song, and Mancini earned a Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Performance (Non-Jazz).\n\nIn February 1966, Mancini released the double-album The Academy Award Songs, containing his renditions of Oscar-winning songs dating back to 1934; it reached the charts and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Performance by a Chorus. May brought the release of Arabesque, the second of three films with Mancini scores released in 1966. His Arabesque album charted and earned three Grammy nominations: Best Instrumental Theme and Best Instrumental Arrangement for the title tune, and Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or TV Show for the album itself. In August, Blake Edwards's film What Did You Do in the War, Daddy? was released with a Mancini score that included \"In the Arms of Love\" (lyrics by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans), which Andy Williams recorded for a chart entry.\n\nIn September, RCA released A Merry Mancini Christmas, a perennial seller that eventually went gold. Mancini's record sales declined starting in 1966, but he continued to place albums in the lower reaches of the charts and to write an average of three film scores a year. In June 1969 he scored a surprise #1, millionselling hit with his recording of \"Love Theme from Romeo & Juliet\" (music by Nino Rota) from his album A Warm Shade of Ivory, which went gold and hit the Top Ten. The single was nominated for Grammys for Record of the Year and Best Contemporary Instrumental Performance, and won for Best Instrumental Arrangement.\n\nBy 1969 his film scores were being released as soundtrack albums by various labels rather than as Henry Mancini albums by RCA, and the film Me, Natalie, which opened in July 1969 with a soundtrack on Columbia Records, earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or TV Special. Since his RCA contract still called for three albums a year, Mancini's work turned up with even greater frequency in record stores. In 1970, for example, eight albums containing his music were released: RCA's newly recorded Theme from \"Z\" and Other Film Music, Mancini Country, and Mancini Plays the Theme from \"Love Story,\" plus the compilation LP This Is Henry Mancini (all of which reached the charts) and soundtracks from four films that opened during the year with his scores&#8212;The Molly Maguires (Paramount), The Hawaiians (United Artists), Darling Lili (RCA), and Sunflower (Avco Embassy).\n\nDuring that year's Grammy competition, he won his 19th award for Best Contemporary Instrumental Performance for the Theme from \"Z\" and Other Film Music LP, his 20th for Best Instrumental Arrangement for the track \"Theme from Z\" (music by Mikis Theodorakis), and earned nominations for Best Instrumental Composition for the track \"Theme from Sunflower\" and Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or TV Special for the Darling Lili LP. (The track \"Theme from Love Story\" [music by Francis Lai], released too late to qualify for the 1970 Grammys, was nominated for a 1971 Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.) At the Oscars, he was nominated for Best Song for \"Whistling Away the Dark\" (lyrics by Johnny Mercer) from Darling Lili, Best Original Score for Sunflower, and Best Original Song Score for Darling Lili.\n\nAfter doing little work on television for the previous decade, Mancini began to accepting assignments writing TV themes, such as those for the network adventure series Cade's County, the children's show Curiosity Shop, and the syndicated series Circus!, all in 1971. He did his next film work on Sometimes a Great Notion, released in November 1971, a country-styled score featuring the song \"All His Children\" (lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman), sung on the soundtrack by Charley Pride and nominated for an Academy Award. Pride's recording hit the country Top Ten in March 1972. That year Mancini expanded his television activities, hosting and writing music for his own syndicated show, The Mancini Generation,\n\nfor which 28 episodes were taped. His \"Theme from The Mancini Generation\" earned a Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Arrangement, and he also got two nominations in connection with the album Brass on Ivory, which he did with trumpeter Doc Severinsen, Best Pop Instrumental Performance with Vocal Coloring for the LP as a whole, and Best Instrumental Composition for the title tune. Mancini returned to film-scoring in 1973 with three movies, the most notable of which was Oklahoma Crude, including the song \"Send a Little Love My Way\" (lyrics by Hal David), sung on the soundtrack by Anne Murray, whose recording made the pop and country charts. He scored another four films released in 1974, including the MGM compilation That's Entertainment!, a major box office hit. Among the three films featuring his scores that were released in 1975, the box office hit Return of the Pink Panther marked a reunion with Blake Edwards, and the his RCA album of the film's music earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or TV Special. He also wrote music for the TV movie The Blue Knight in 1975, one of several television films he would score in subsequent years. He had another four film scores in 1976, among them The Pink Panther Strikes Again, featuring the song \"Come to Me\" (lyrics by Don Black), which was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nHe also released two new albums on RCA, and two tracks from the first&#8212;Henry Mancini Conducts the London Symphony Orch. in a Concert of Film Music&#8212;earned Grammy nominations, for Best Instrumental Arrangement for \"The Disaster Movie Suite\" and Best Instrumental Composition for \"The White Dawn.\" Mancini's most notable work of 1977 was the score for the television miniseries The Money Changers. Among the three feature films and two TV movies he scored in 1978, the most successful was Revenge of the Pink Panther, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for the song \"Move 'Em Out\" (lyrics by Leslie Bricusse) and two Grammy nominations, Best Pop Instrumental Performance for \"The Pink Panther Theme (78)\" and Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or TV for the soundtrack LP. He left RCA after 20 years with the November release of the album The Theme Scene. He scored three films in 1979, notably 10, which earned him Academy Award nominations for Best Song for \"It's Easy to Say\" (lyrics by Robert Wells) and Best Original Score and a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Instrumental Performance for \"Ravel's Bolero.\"\n\nThere were two features and a TV movie in 1980 and four features in 1981. In 1982 he won his fourth Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for Victor/Victoria, a film musical starring Julie Andrews and directed by Blake Edwards; the soundtrack album earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or a TV Special. He was also up for a 1982 Grammy for Best Instrumental Composition for \"The Thorn Birds Theme\" from his score from the popular TV miniseries The Thorn Birds, broadcast during the 1982-83 season. Mancini scored three films in 1983 and two in 1984.\n\nAlso in 1984, he teamed with flutist James Galway for the album In the Pink, which earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Arrangement on an Instrumental for the track \"Cameo for Flute...For James.\" There were three film scores in 1985 and another three in 1986, among them That's Life!, from which the song \"Life in a Looking Glass\" (lyrics by Leslie Bricusse) was nominated for an Academy Award. Also in 1986, he accompanied Johnny Mathis on the chart album The Hollywood Musicals, from the which the track \"It Might as Well Be Spring\" earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocal(s). Among his two feature and two TV film scores of 1987, the one for the theatrical release The Glass Menagerie resulted in a soundtrack album that earned him two Grammy nominations, for Best Album of Original Instrumental Background Score Written for a Motion Picture or TV and for Best Instrumental Composition for the track \"The Blues in Three.\" Mancini scored two feature films and a TV movie in 1988.\n\nHis album Premier Pops, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orch., earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Arrangement on an Instrumental for \"Suite from The Thorn Birds\"; he also was nominated for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocal(s) for the title track from Volare, an album he recorded with Luciano Pavarotti. In 1990, Mancini re-signed to RCA and recorded Mancini in Surround: Mostly Monsters, Murders and Mysteries, which earned a Grammy nomination for Best Arrangement on an Instrumental for the track \"Monster Movie Music Suite.\" His next RCA album, Cinema Italiano: Music of Ennio Morricone and Nino Rota, released in April 1991, brought him a Grammy nomination for Best Arrangement on an Instrumental for the track \"The Untouchables\" (music by Ennio Morricone).

Victor/Victoria, starring Julie Andrews and directed by Blake Edwards, opened on Broadway in 1995 and ran 738 performances.
