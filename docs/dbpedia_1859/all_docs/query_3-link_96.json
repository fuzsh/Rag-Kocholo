Although nothing is completely proven, today in Marca Canaria we will talk about the different theories that revolve around the name of the Canary Islands.\n\nThe 8 Canary Islands: context and history\n\nThe Canary Islands are an archipelago of volcanic origin located in the Atlantic Ocean that forms a Spanish autonomous community in northwest Africa, with historical nationality status. It is also one of the outermost regions of the European Union.\n\nThe Canary Islands cover eight islands, five islets, eight rocks and the sea. Politically, the archipelago is made up of seven islands with their own administration and an eighth island, La Graciosa, recognized as such since 2018. The seven islands with their own administration are, on the one hand, El Hierro, La Gomera, La Palma and Tenerife, which They constitute the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife; and, on the other hand, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria and Lanzarote that make up the province of Las Palmas.\n\nTo these seven islands are added, on the one hand, the uninhabited islets of Montaña Clara, Alegranza, Roque del Este and Roque del Oeste which, together with the island of La Graciosa, form the Chinijo archipelago and, on the other hand, the islet of Lobos, all of these belonging to the province of Las Palmas. In addition, to the eight islands and five islets a series of adjacent rocks are added: those of Salmor, Fasnia, Bonanza, Garachico and Anaga located in the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and those of Gando and the Farallón de Sardina located in Gran Canaria .\n\nFinally, this autonomous community is completed with the Canary Islands waters, which are a special maritime area of ​​the autonomous community and are integrated within the perimeter contour that arises from the union of the most salient extreme points of the islands and islets, being the the only autonomous community in Spain that includes the sea as part of its surface.\n\nFirst mentions of the Canary Islands in written documents\n\nThe first written document with a direct reference to the Canary Islands is due to Pliny the Elder, who cites the trip of King Juba II of Mauritania to the islands in 40 BC. C. and refers to them for the first time as the Fortunate Islands. In this document the term Canary Islands also appears for the first time, used to refer to the island of Gran Canaria.\n\nAccording to Pliny, this name was given to the island in memory of two large dogs that Juba's envoys captured there and later took to Mauritania (ancient region of the northwestern Maghreb).\n\nTraditionally, it has been considered the possibility that the dogs were mastiffs, which are currently represented on both sides of the current shield of the Canary Islands. However, the historian José Juan Jiménez, from the Museum of Nature and Man of Tenerife, maintains that Plinio the Elder was not referring to dogs but to a species of large monk seal that populated the coasts of the Archipelago until the 15th century. and which has the name cannis marinus. And Gran Canaria at that time was still uninhabited and, therefore, did not have dogs either, which were brought to the island by the original settlers, the Amazhigh or Berbers, who arrived on the island in the 1st century AD. c.\n\nThe Canarii, the possible reason for the name of the islands\n\nSince ancient times, the plural toponym has been used to refer to the entire Archipelago. Thus, in the 4th century Arnobius of Sicca wrote about the Canary Islands.\n\nSome modern theories relate the term Canary Islands to the North African ethnonym canarii, a Berber group that was located in northwestern Africa. In fact, Pliny himself mentions the canarii in another text, although he again relates this term to the dogs. Also the aforementioned José Juan Jiménez defends that the origin of the Canarii of Gran Canaria is in that Atlas tribe that, after rebelling against the Romans, was deported to the island of Gran Canaria in the 1st century AD. C. For this reason, and according to the aforementioned historian, although the islands were called \"Canary Islands\" due to the presence of the monk seal cannis marinus in the archipelago, after the canarii were sent to Gran Canaria the name of the island would be related , progressively, with that of said tribe.\n\nSome of the most popular theories\n\nNo, the name of the Canary Islands does not come from the bird\n\nIf you ask a child from outside the Canary Islands where the name of the Canary Islands comes from, they will surely answer that it comes from the bird: the canary. In reality, the Canary Islands could mean land of dogs and this is undoubtedly one of the most relevant theories.\n\nDifferent studies say that the monarch Juba II of Mauritania sent his troops to colonize the Canary Islands. Supposedly, when they landed, they found thousands of dogs. This caught the attention of the troops so much that they baptized the islands “Insulare Canaria” (islands of dogs), which would end up leading to the current name of the Canary Islands.\n\nWhat if it came from monk seals?\n\nThere is a possibility that when the expeditionaries sent by Juba II arrived in the Canary Islands they did not find dogs, but rather monk seals, also known as sea dogs. This discovery would make them baptize the islands as \"Canaria\", very similar to the current name of the Canary Islands. If this theory is true, it would dismantle the previous one, which traditionally links the origin of the lucky islands with dogs.\n\nPerhaps the name of the Canary Islands does not come from animals\n\nTo explain where the name of the Canary Islands comes from, various historians say that there was a Berber tribe called Canarii. These ancient settlers were found mainly on the island of Gran Canaria and could be responsible for the current name of the Archipelago.\n\nSo where does the name of the Canary Islands come from?\n\nAlthough any of the three theories could be perfectly correct, the reality is that there is still no reliable evidence of the origin of the current name of our islands. Whatever the origin of the name of the Canary Islands, without a doubt our Archipelago is a paradise.\n\nThe Canary Islands are a land with a thousand things to see, explore and know .
