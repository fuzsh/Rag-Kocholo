The canton is charged with a gánigo placed over a white map of the island and a green cross patty placed over a white sail.\n\nThe flag seen in the port is in proportions c. 3:5, with a smaller coat of arms. The flag seen at the Town Hall is in proportions c. 8:15, with a larger coat of arms. On the reverse of this flag, the emblems are placed at fly.\n\nAccording to Jos&eacute Manuel Erbez (Banderas y escudos de Canarias, 2007; website), the gánigo, a pottery bowl typical of the Canarian native culture, over the island's silhouette symbolizes the native heritage of the island. The sail with the cross represents the caravels of Colombus that moored off the island, subsequently known as \"Coombian island\".\n\nThe coat of arms of La Gomera is prescribed by a Decree adopted on 25 June 1999 by the Government of the Canary Islands and published on 2 August 1999 in the official gazette of the Canary Islands, No. 103, pp. 11,682-11,683 (text). The coat of arms was originally adopted on 4 December 1998 by the Island Council, as published on 28 December 1998 in the official gazette of the Santa Cruz de Tenerife Province, No. 157, and validated on 11 March 1999 by the Heraldry Commission of the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands.\n\nThe coat of arms is described as follows:\n\nCoat of arms: Gules two caldrons or one and one. A bordure gules 12 caldrons or of smaller size four two two and four. The shield surmounted by a Count's coronet.\n\nThe rationale for the design is the following.\n\nThe shield is based on historical criteria, related with the establishment of the Domain of the Canary Islands, granted by King John II to the lords of Las Casas. The design matches the coat of arms of the Herrera lineage, as the most representative of the early history of La Gomera, summarizing under this name all the lords and counts of the island who initiated the island's government. This coat of arms has been traditionally considered as representative of the island in all official acts since the establishment of island's governments.\n\nThe coat of arms of La Gomera is almost identical to that of Lanzarote, the only differences in La Gomera being the Count's coronet instead of the Marquis' coronet and a thin gold fimbriation between the field and the bordure.\n\nKlaus-Michael Schneider, José Manuel Erbez & Ivan Sache, 10 March 2012\n\nUnofficial flags of La Gomera\n\nUnofficial flags of La Gomera - Images by Jaume Ollé and António Martins, respectively, 23 November 2000\n\nPrevious to the adoption of the today's flag, two flags were seen in some occasion, with unofficial character and surely with the only purpose of completing the set of seven islands when La Gomera was the only island with no flag. One shows the coat of arms on a white field, while the second is horizontally divided white-blue-red-blue-white.\n\nSantiago Dotor, Jaume Ollé & José Manuel Erbez, 23 November 2000\n\nMunicipalities on La Gomera"
