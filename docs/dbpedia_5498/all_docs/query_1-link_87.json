        "text": "Private university in Garden City, New York, US\n\nFor other uses, see Adelphi (disambiguation).\n\nAdelphi University is a private university in Garden City, New York. Adelphi also has centers in Downtown Brooklyn, Hudson Valley, and Suffolk County in addition to a virtual, online campus for remote students. It is the oldest institution of higher education in suburban Long Island.[3] As of 2019, it has about 7,859 undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAdelphi College\n\n[edit]\n\nAdelphi University began with the Adelphi Academy, founded in Brooklyn, New York in 1863. The academy was a private preparatory school located at 412 Adelphi Street, in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, but later moved to Clinton Hill. It was formally chartered in 1869 by the board of trustees of the City of Brooklyn for establishing \"a first class institution for the broadest and most thorough training, and to make its advantages as accessible as possible to the largest numbers of our population.\"[citation needed] One of the teachers at the Adelphi Academy was Harlan Fiske Stone, who later served as the Chief Justice of the United States.\n\nIn 1893, Charles Herbert Levermore was appointed as the head of Adelphi Academy. Seeking to establish a liberal arts college for the City of Brooklyn, Levermore received a charter from the Board of Regents of the State of New York, officially establishing Adelphi College on June 24, 1896. The college received its charter through the efforts of Timothy Woodruff, former Lieutenant Governor of New York and future first president of the board of trustees. Adelphi was one of the first coeducational institutions to receive a charter from the State of New York. At the time of its foundation, the college numbered only 57 students and 16 instructors. The Adelphi Academy continued to exist as a separate but nonetheless connected entity to the college. The new college was located in a building behind the Adelphi Academy, on the corner of St. James's Place and Clifton Place, in Brooklyn. The building that originally housed Adelphi is now used by Pratt Institute for their School of Architecture.[4] In 1912, Adelphi became a women's college. In 1922, the school raised over one million dollars to expand the overcrowded facilities in Brooklyn. In 1925, Adelphi College severed its ties with the Adelphi Academy, the latter closing in 1930. In 1929, the college moved from its founding location in Brooklyn to the current location of its main campus in Garden City, New York. The original \"academy\" continues to function as a P–12 school in Brooklyn.[5] The original three buildings of the Garden City campus, Levermore Hall, Blodgett Hall and Woodruff Hall, were designed by McKim, Mead and White.\n\nIn 1938, the Dance Program was founded by the world-famous dancer Ruth St. Denis. In 1943, the School of Nursing was established in response to the need for nurses due to American involvement in World War II. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the opening of two federally funded residence halls on campus, in a speech entitled \"The Challenge of Nursing for Young Women Today.\"\n\nIn 1946, after World War II ended, Adelphi reverted to a coeducational college and started admitting new students on the federal GI Bill. New sports teams were created following the readmission of men to the school. In 1952, the first program for clinical psychology was established at the school; it was the forerunner to the Institute for Advanced Psychological Studies, now the Gordon F. Derner School of Psychology.\n\nAdelphi University\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1963, the New York State Board of Regents granted the college university status, and the name was changed to Adelphi University. In 1964, the School of Business was founded. In 1966, the Institute for Advanced Psychological Studies was founded. In 1973, the university established ABLE (Adult Baccalaureate Learning Experience) for the education of adults. Now known as the College of Professional and Continuing Studies, it was one of the earliest programs created for nontraditional students. In 1984, the Institute for Teaching and Educational Studies was founded; it became the School of Education in 1990. In 1993, the Society of Mentors was established, giving students faculty advisors that they could consult on an as-needed basis to assist them in their studies. In 1995, the Honors College was founded.\n\nIn January 1963, Adelphi Suffolk College (which had started out in 1955 offering extension courses in Suffolk County, New York) purchased the former W.K. Vanderbilt estate in Oakdale, New York. In 1968, it was spun off to Dowling College after its chief benefactor, Robert Dowling.\n\nAdelphi faced a serious scandal in 1996, as the school celebrated its 100th anniversary. University president Peter Diamandopoulos and the board of trustees were accused of neglect of duty, misconduct and failure to carry out the educational purposes of Adelphi. The New York State Board of Regents was called in to investigate; Diamandopoulos, along with all but one of the board of trustees, was dismissed from office.[6] The university was in dire financial straits until Robert A. Scott was installed in the position of President in 2000. Scott saved the school by decreasing tuition, increasing scholarships offered for the students, and launching an advertising campaign to increase enrollment. Since that time, the school has surpassed many of its previous gains, and is said to be undergoing a new renaissance. Adelphi University has been ranked as a \"Best Buy\" college by the Fiske Guide to Colleges for the last ten years for its quality education offered at a comparatively affordable price.[7] Adelphi University also participates in the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities's (NAICU) University and College Accountability Network (U-CAN).[8] In 2023, the Princeton Review ranked Adelphi University a \"Green College\" making the list of environmentally responsible colleges and universities across the country.[9]\n\nIn August 2023, Adelphi relocated the Manhattan Center location to Downtown Brooklyn at 179 Livingston Street. Adelphi - Brooklyn Center, located on the 5th through 7th floors, is adjacent to Macy's Brooklyn store and shared with St. Francis College. [10]\n\nBreast cancer support program\n\n[edit]\n\nThe university's School of Social Work is home to the Adelphi New York Statewide Breast Cancer Hotline and Support Program.[11] The program began in 1980 as the Woman-to-Woman Hotline, a free and confidential service to help women with breast cancer.[12] It is the second oldest breast cancer hotline in the United States; over 100 trained volunteers offer information and emotional support for women and men suffering from breast cancer. There are professional social workers, bi-lingual Spanish-speaking staff and support staff, along with support groups, educational programs and individual counseling.[13]\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nRankings\n\n[edit]\n\nAcademic rankingsNationalForbes[14]353U.S. News & World Report[15]166Washington Monthly[16]238WSJ/College Pulse[17]208GlobalTHE[18]1501+\n\nIn 2015, Adelphi University was ranked #17 in New York State by average professor salaries.[19]\n\nIn 2024 Adelphi University was ranked No. 163 in National Universities by U.S. News & World Report.[20]\n\nColleges, schools and degrees\n\n[edit]\n\nCollege of Arts and Sciences: B.A., B.S., B.F.A., M.A., M.S., M.F.A.,\n\nCollege of Professional and Continuing Studies: A.A., A.S., A.A.S., B.A., B.S., Post-baccalaureate Certificate, M.S.\n\nGordon F.

The Adelphi University School of Business, established in 1964, was renamed the Robert B.

For programs which are not directly associated with Adelphi (from accredited institutions and are approved by the Center for International Education), students may use all their federal aid, and 75% of their Adelphi institutional aid — while remaining enrolled on campus. Adelphi faculty-led programs, including theater, art, art history, literature, history, counseling, chemistry and speech-pathology, are held in Italy, Kenya, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Iceland, England, Jamaica, Kosovo and Poland.[23]\n\nLevermore Global Scholars program is an innovative academic community dedicated to preparing students to become global thinkers and leaders in a changing world. Students engage through classroom study, events and conferences at the United Nations and study abroad.\n\nMain campus buildings\n\n[edit]\n\nMain halls\n\n[edit]\n\nMany of the buildings on the Garden City campus are symmetrical in nature.

The Panthers compete at the NCAA Division II level for all sports and have been a member of the Northeast-10 Conference since 2009.\n\nThe Panthers have won 18 NCAA Division II National Championships in three different sports. The men's lacrosse team has won seven national crowns, their last coming in 2001. The women's lacrosse team has won an NCAA Division II-record ten, including three consecutive National Championships in 2009, 2010, 2011 and back-to-back titles in 2014 and 2015; and most recently in 2019. In 1974, the men's soccer team were the National Champions. They have also won numerous individual national championships in track and field.\n\nSince transitioning to the Northeast-10, the Adelphi Panthers have become a powerhouse in the East Region. In 2013, just their fourth year in the conference, the Panthers were awarded the 2013 Northeast-10 Presidents' Cup. The Presidents' Cup is presented annually to signify overall athletic excellence in the Northeast-10. The honor is awarded to the institution that compiles the most total points from all of its programs competing in league championships.[25]\n\nNotable alumni\n\n[edit]\n\nGary Dell'Abate (\"Baba Booey\"), producer of The Howard Stern Show\n\nSean Hannity, conservative news host\n\nChuck Connors, actor and professional baseball and basketball player\n\nFlavor Flav, rapper\n\nPaul Ekman, psychologist\n\nMeredith Eaton, actress\n\nChuck D, rapper\n\nGary Dell'Abate (\"Baba Booey\") (b. 1961) – producer of The Howard Stern Show\n\nJohn D.
