(I point) Women have been able to gain more work and improve their quality of life. Women in Bangladesh and India significantly improved their quality of life. Women have access to a wider variety of low-cost products to buy. Women have been able to stay at home and take care of children.\n\nGet answer\n\nSolution\n\nExpert Verified\n\n4.3(299 votes)\n\nMargery CardenasElite · Tutor for 8 years\n\nAnswer\n\nWomen have been able to gain more work and improve their quality of life.\n\nExplanation\n\nGlobalization has had a significant impact impact on women and gender in various ways. Among the options provided:<br />1. \"Women have been able to gain more work and improve their quality of life.\" This statement is accurate. As businesses expand and markets open up, there has been an increased demand for labor, leading to more job opportunities for women. This has allowed many women to improve their financial situation and quality of life.<br />2. \"Women in Bangladesh and India significantly improved their quality of life.\" While this statement might be true, it is too specific and does not provide a comprehensive view of the positive impacts of globalization on women globally.<br />3. \"Women have access to a wider variety of low-cost products to buy.\" This is a result of globalization, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a positive impact on women's rights or gender equality. Access to products doesn't equate to improved quality of life or empowerment.<br />4. \"Women have been able to stay at home and take care of children.\" This statement is not necessarily a positive impact of globalization. In fact, in many cases, globalization has led to women leaving their homes to work in factories or other sectors, which might not be an improvement for all.<br />Given the options, the most accurate statement that reflects a positive impact of globalization on women and gender is the first option."
