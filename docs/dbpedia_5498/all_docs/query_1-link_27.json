        "text": "The Motherworld was the collection of planets where the Imperium was headquartered, primarily referring to the planet Moa. The dominant religion was upheld by the Scribes. The world was once the peak of civilization, but since the death of the royal family, that focus was lost, leaving art and technology to stagnate and deteriorate. The planets orbited a pair of stars.[1] 1,886 kings ruled in unbroken succession until the bloodline was finally severed.\n\nThe Motherworld appeared in flashbacks in A Child of Fire, Chalice of Blood, The Scargiver, and Curse of Forgiveness, finally appearing in the present day in the final scene of Curse of Forgiveness.\n\nCulture[]\n\nMoa was an ancient world with a long history of civilizations rising and collapsing, building atop each other. The modern culture of the Motherworld was a melting pot, but rather than blending and expanding, the mixture of cultures was consumed and compressed into a cold world focused only on expansion. The infrastructure of the world lagged behind as all focus was on the stars.[2]\n\nAmong the venerable royal family was the ancient queen, Issa. Issa represented lifegiving and compassion and it was believed that she would return to life once more among the lineage of the House of Carathon. Alongside this belief was the creation myth of Moa, involving the White Serpent of Time, the Würm; and the Mother of the Material World, the Wolf. Of equal importance was the Graal, the Vessel of Mercy and Redemption, which would pour its life into the source river. There were four noble houses that supported that of the royal family: Ürgrund, Fasces, Graal, and Marz. A holy acacia tree was also important, but not much is known about this tree. Finally, the King's Gaze, represented by a six-winged eye, was believed to exist as the divine consciousness of the royal bloodline.[3]\n\nAnother symbol of a stylized eye is also used by the Motherworld, it is present on black bags serving as hoods that we see twice: first when the general Titus tells the events that followed his surrender, It is with masks marked with this eye that his men are blinded before being executed, and then when Kora tells the assassination of the royal family, where an orchestra of musicians wearing the same hood was present on board the Peacemaker/King's Gaze.\n\nEvents[]\n\nAssassination of the royal family: At her coronation, in orbit above the planet, Princess Issa and her parents, the king and queen, were killed as part of Senator Balisarius' plot to steal power for himself and other powerful figures of the Motherworld who stood to lose much of that power if the politics of the world would change in Issa's planned direction.\n\nLocales[]\n\nCity palace: The royal palace was the center of the urban sprawl that made up the society of the Motherworld. The kings would meet with their advisors and other visitors here, while also able to address the city below.[4]\n\nCountry palace: Something of a vacation home for the royal family, the country palace was a place where the king could relax after political squabbles and get away from the city. It was in the gardens of the country palace that Arthelais witnessed Princess Issa's power of lifegiving.[5]\n\nAcademy Militarium: Directly across from the balcony of the city palace was the Military Academy coliseum of the Academy Militarium. The space between could contain rows of soldiers who could be addressed directly by the king (or regent).[6]\n\nSenate: The senate was a particularly old building, crumbling with age and being held up with new structure, paralleling the similar change in leadership of the Motherworld.[7]\n\nLozor University: A school of higher education on the Motherworld, this was the school Yisrael Bloodaxe attended before his expulsion.\n\nArx Ignis: A desert said to have been crossed by the first king on the back of the sacred lochna. This name comes from the audio of \"A Wedding Surprise,\" so its spelling is approximated.\n\nChlorus: Lush grasslands. Chlorus is mentioned during King Ulmer's wedding in \"A Wedding Surprise,\" so its spelling is approximated.\n\nOrbiting construction site & hangar[8]: A space station orbiting Moa, this construction site was used to build dreadnought-class battle cruisers such as the Peacemaker.\n\nPeoples and fauna[]\n\nThe dominant species of Moa was humans, who had a history dating back at least tens of thousands of years on the planet. A giraffe-like creature known as a lochna was said to have carried the first king across the desert, but the status of this species is unknown in the present day. A breed of birds lived near the country palace, which Princess Issa appreciated. Issa also had a forest canine named Lola, though, due to her family's wealth and power, Lola easily could have been imported from another world. Similarly, King Ulmer kept a boar on hand, which was used to gore his guests who bored him. It's unknown if the boar was native to Moa or pulled from offworld. Skulls and other remains of giant, humanoid warriors could also be found around the country palace, but nothing is known about these creatures. They were similar in proportions to the Kalies, but don't have a confirmed connection to the Kalies.\n\nOrganizations[]\n\nHouse of Carathon\n\nImperium\n\nMotherworld infantry\n\nScribes\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]"
