Find \"Bibliographies,\" the 5th blue tab in the middle of the screen to find several thematic bibliographies, such as Systematic Theology by Doctrinal Persuasion.\n\n2. A dictionary of theology or a theological discipline.\n\nIf you search \"theological dictionary\" in the Summon tool, which is the search bar in the middle of the Library homepage (www.regent.edu/lib), you should find several results.

A book of theology written by a patristic writer after the council of Nicaea (translated in English).\n\nFor numbers 3-8, I recommend looking up specific scholars, (ie: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patristics) then searching for his/her work the Library catalog by author (http://library.regent.edu/search/a). You can find theologians by a simple Google search (ie: \"medieval/scholastic scholar), or you may find these theology-based websites from the Divinity Research Guide to be helpful: http://libguides.regent.edu/content.php?pid=207432&sid=4922460.\n\n4.
