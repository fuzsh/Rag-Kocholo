        "text": "This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nThis is a list of colleges, seminaries, and universities that do not have educational accreditation. In many countries, accreditation is defined as a governmental designation.\n\nDegrees or other qualifications from unaccredited institutions may not be accepted by civil service or other employers. Some unaccredited institutions have formal legal authorization to enroll students or issue degrees, but in some jurisdictions (notably including the United States) legal authorization to operate is not the same as educational accreditation.[1][2]\n\nInstitutions that appear on this list are those that have granted post-secondary academic degrees or advertised the granting of such degrees, but which are listed as unaccredited by a reliable source. There are several reasons for an institution not maintaining accreditation. A new institution may not yet have attained accreditation, while a long-established institution may have lost accreditation because of financial difficulties or other factors. Some unaccredited institutions are fraudulent diploma mills.[3] Other institutions (for example, a number of Bible colleges and seminaries) choose not to participate in the accreditation process because they view it as an infringement of their religious, academic, or political freedom.[4] Some government jurisdictions exempt religious institutions from accreditation or other forms of government oversight.[5] Still other institutions are not required to have accreditation.\n\nSome of the institutions on this list are no longer in operation. Several unaccredited universities have names that are similar to those of accredited institutions, and thus some persons may be misled into thinking that an entity is an accredited university. Accreditation is date-related: in the United States, colleges and universities are typically not fully accredited until several years after they open. Also in the United States, many colleges and universities existed prior to the development of the modern accreditation system.[6]\n\nThere are many organizations which give their own accreditation, not generally recognised as valid by governments and others, to educational institutions. Many of these are listed in the article List of unrecognized higher education accreditation organizations. Some of the educational institutions listed here claim accreditation from such organizations.\n\nA\n\nA Touch From Above Christian University, California;[7] overseen by the unaccredited Transworld Accrediting Commission International[8]\n\nAbundant Living Bible College, Kentucky;[9] overseen by the unaccredited Transworld Accrediting Commission International[8]\n\nAccademia di Belle Arti di Medicino, Italy[10]\n\nAcadémie Européene d'Informatisation (also known as the World Information Distributed University), Belgium and Russia[10][11][12]\n\nAcademy of Intuition Medicine, California (also called the Academy of Intuition Medicine Online)[13][14]\n\nAcademy of Natural Therapies, Hawaii;
