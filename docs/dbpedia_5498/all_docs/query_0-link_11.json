Whether academics like it or not, students check Wikipedia to begin their research, get an overview of a topic, find relevant sources, images, data and bibliographies. Reviewing exisiting literature no longer usually starts with paying a visit to the university library and talking to a reference librarian. As information professionals we have to accept that students use Google and click on the first availabe link: a link to a Wikipedia page. And although academics can have endless conversations about the \"dangers\" of using Wikipedia in higher education, we, as librarians, have an obligation to take the initiative and be much more proactive about Wikipedia within our communities.\n\nThis talk will look at examples of how two academic librarians based at Regent's Univesity London www.regents.ac.ukare trying to engage their students and colleagues with Wikipedia, to encourage collaboration and participation, and increase understanding. We will be showing examples of what we have tried in the past and what we are planning to try in the near future, discussing the benefits of participation, and real potential barriers to engagement.\n\nThe more librarians get involved in Wikipedia, the better for everybody. Academic librarians, whose roles allow them to work closely with both students and academic staff, have a real opportunity to play a significant role in increasing engagement with, and understanding of, Wikipedia within the higher education community. Since libraries and Wikipedia share the same goals, that is to promote open access to human knowledge, there really is no excuse for us not to embrace Wikipedia.\n\nTrack\n\nCollaboration\n\nLength of presentation/talk\n\n25 Minutes\n\nTarget audience\n\nBeginner and intermediate\n\nExpected outcomes\n\nWe hope to encourage other academic librarians with our examples.\n\nWill you attend GLAM-WIKI 2015 if your submission is not accepted?\n\nNo\n\nSlides or further information (optional)\n\nSpecial requests\n\nIf you are interested in attending this session, please sign with your username below.
