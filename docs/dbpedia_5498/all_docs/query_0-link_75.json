It was a constituent school of Regent's College London, which became Regent's University London in 2013..[1][2]\n\nEBS London offered courses in the field of International Business Management and had a strong focus on Banking and Finance, reflected by the fact that a third of its graduates pursued a career in that field.[3] Besides its focus on teaching, the university had a long-standing commitment to research, offering MPhil and PhD degrees.[4]\n\nAround 900 students from over 85 nationalities made the School highly international.

European Business School London (EBSL), EBS Universität für Wirtschaft und Recht and European Business School Paris are the remaining European Business Schools.
