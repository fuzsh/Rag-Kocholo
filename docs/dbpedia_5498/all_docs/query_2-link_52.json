        "text": "<p>Looks like this is another scam ‘honors society’, that takes a student’s money and really adds no value to a resume.</p>\n\n<p>Am I right?</p>\n\n<p>Golden Key is legit has has been around since 1977 if I recall right. Both my mom and I are members and the chapter on my campus is quite active within the community as well as doing fun, bonding type activities around the county (kayaking, beach bonfires, potlucks, etc). For me, it’s like being in an adult, co-ed scout troop. One also has access to some decent discounts and deals through being a member. I believe there are scholarship opportunities as well.</p>\n\n<p>Like gadad said, it comes down to a personal choice whether those benefits and activities are worthy of the one-time membership fee. Not all things that charge membership fees are scams, but not all things are worth the membership fee to everyone either.</p>\n\n<p>I was Phi Beta Kappa. When I joined I’d at least heard of it. But I don’t think it benefited me in any way. </p>\n\n<p>Don’t your GPA and class rank pretty much speak for themselves? And if you already participate in various activities, like the Regent’s Scholar Society at UC, why take on another (lesser) honors society?</p>\n\n<p>While it certainly isn’t a scam, S1 and his circle have dismissed it as having or adding any real value to their lives/C.V.'s. I remember being kind of excited when he received the invite, but he was not impressed, not keen to join.</p>\n\n<p>I got invited to join but didn’t because it wasn’t worth my money, although if invited I would definitely join one of the engineering honors societies on campus. Even if I had joined I would no longer have room on my resume for it since I have enough items that actually relate to my major.</p>\n\n<p>Considering they just base invitations off of your GPA, how is becoming a member worthwhile if your GPA can just speak for itself?</p>\n\n<p>If putting it on your resume is why you are doing it, don’t, save your money. Employers and universities are wise to this. Join the Honors Program at your university which has value added. If you are solicited, say on your resume: “nominated for membership to Golden Key.” It is a great way to get the benefit on your resume, save your money, and indicate to future employees that you were actually smart enough to not part with your money!\n\nHave a look at the controversy section in Wikipedia\n\n[Golden</a> Key International Honour Society - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](<a href=“http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Key_International_Honour_Society]Golden”>Golden Key International Honour Society - Wikipedia)\n\nand look at:\n\n[Golden</a> Key Intnl Honour Society – worth it? - goldenkey scholarship gradschool | Ask MetaFilter](<a href=“http://ask.metafilter.com/23093/Golden-Key-Intnl-Honour-Society-worth-it]Golden”>Golden Key Intnl Honour Society -- worth it? - goldenkey scholarship gradschool | Ask MetaFilter)</p>\n\nIt was worth it because I got a really pretty medallion to wear at graduation, and I think and extra cord.\n\nIt looked great. I have only recently started adding it to my resume, so I don’t know if it will help, but since I paid for it, I might as well.\n\nThe only think i don’t like about it is that the official name of the organization has a U in the word Honour, and it just feels wrong to me."
