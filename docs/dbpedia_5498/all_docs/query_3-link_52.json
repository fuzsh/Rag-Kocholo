        "text": "I’m Zack Eswine, and along with my wife Jessica and three children, we do life together in Webster Groves Missouri. At times, I’m more doubtful, broken and cynical than I want to be. At other times I marvel at how good it is to know and be known. I’m asking, seeking, knocking, as Jesus asks us to. I find in Him the strength of truth, reality, purpose, help and hope.\n\nI’m a pastor at Riverside Church. I’ve written several books. I’m a flawed but earnest mentor, nurturer and encourager to other pastors. I often receive letters from those who struggle deeply with depression and other forms of grief along with the ancient questions about God, life and each other that most of us ask. I too have known the hounding and haunting of anxieties and depression. I’m grateful that in Jesus’s hands, the mattering things like love, laughter and beauty don’t quit and will live on when death finally dies.\n\nI was born and raised in Southern Indiana, in the towns of Henryville, Clarksville and Floyd’s Knobs. I graduated from Floyd Central High School in 1987. I received a B.S.W. from Ball State University, an M.Div. from Covenant Theological Seminary and a Ph.D. from Regent University.\n\nI blog irregularly and in line with the rhythms of local life with family, neighbors, pastoral vocation and mentoring. I enjoy old movies, music, poetry, novels, essays on culture, writings on spirituality. I cheer for Notre Dame Football and Indiana Basketball. Sitting next to a body of water, whether a pond, a lake or an ocean, calms my mind. Jesus has my attention."
