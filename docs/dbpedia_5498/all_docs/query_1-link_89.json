        "text": "Business school affiliated to the University of London\n\nThis article is about the constituent college of the University of London. For other uses, see London Business School (disambiguation).\n\nLondon Business School (LBS) is a business school and a constituent college of the federal University of London. LBS was founded in 1964 and awards post-graduate degrees (Master's degrees in management and finance, MBA and PhD). Its motto is \"To have a profound impact on the way the world does business\".[4]\n\nThe main campus is located at Sussex Place in London, adjacent to Regent's Park. In 2012, the school acquired the Marylebone Town Hall and spent £60 million to refurbish it with the objective of expanding its teaching facilities by 70% - the new building is called The Sammy Ofer Centre.[5] In 2017, it was announced that LBS had also acquired the site of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists,[6] who vacated the building in November 2019.[7] LBS has a secondary campus in Dubai that is dedicated to Executive Education and the Dubai EMBA.[8]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFoundation\n\n[edit]\n\nLondon Business School was founded in 1964 under the name of the 'London Graduate School of Business Studies', with Dr. Arthur Earle as Dean. In 1965, the school was registered as a company and was designated by the University of London as an institution having recognised teachers. In 1966, the first Executive Development Programme was launched, followed by the Senior Executive Programme. The same year, a full-time MSc degree was also launched, with Sheila Cross enrolling as the School's first female student. In 1968, the School inaugurated the Sloan Fellowship MSc programme, which was the first one outside of the US. 17 students were enrolled and the programme was funded by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation. The first doctoral programme was established in 1969 and in 1970 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II opened the School's Regent's Park campus. The first PhD was awarded in 1974, and that year women made up over 15% of the student body for the first time. In 1983, the first part-time MBA programme was held under the direction of Sir Andrew Likierman, a former Dean of the School. In 1986, the school officially became the London Business School and was incorporated by Royal Charter, which gave LBS the right to confer and grant degrees. In 1992, the School was given the Queen's Award for Export in recognition of providing educational services to managers and companies worldwide. The following year, the school started its first Masters in Finance programme and in 2001, the EMBA-Global degree programme in partnership with the Columbia Business School.[9]\n\nIn 2007 a new campus was opened in Dubai to offer both Executive MBA and Executive Education Programmes. In 2009, the school started two new programmes: The EMBA-Global Asia, in partnership with the University of Hong Kong and Columbia Business School, and the Masters in Management (MiM). In 2012, the school acquired Marylebone Town Hall and restored it with the objective of expanding its teaching facilities by 70 per cent.[5] The building was renamed \"The Sammy Ofer Centre\" in honour of a generous donor, the Ofer Family, who made a gift for the development of the building, which was opened in 2017.[10] In 2016, LBS launched a new programme, the Masters in Financial Analysis, aimed at recent graduates who wish to pursue a career in finance, and acquired the lease of the neighbouring building of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaenocologists, which it will occupy in 2020.\n\nWith the objective of increasing its size, the school organised a £100 million funding campaign. By the beginning of 2016, it had raised £98 million, £40 million of which will be used to renovate the Marylebone Town Hall, with £28 million for research, £18 million in scholarships for students, £10 million to increase the school's endowment, and £4 million to improve technology across the school.[11] By June 2016, the school had raised £125 million, including two £25 million gifts from alumni Jim Ratcliffe and Idan Ofer.[12]\n\nFrançois Ortalo-Magné, the French-born former Dean of the Wisconsin School of Business, succeeded Sir Andrew Likierman as Dean in August 2017.[13]\n\nCampus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe campus is located at Sussex Place in Marylebone, on the perimeter of Regent's Park.[14]\n\nLBS maintains a number of facilities, including a sports centre, restaurant, three cafes and a library, all dedicated for the exclusive use of its community. There is also a privately run pub, 'The Windsor Castle' attached to the campus. Most classrooms for the MBA are located in the Sainsbury Wing, the centre of the terrace, most of which are 100-student amphitheatre rooms.\n\nThere is no accommodation on campus for students in full-time programmes, although there are rooms on-campus for visiting faculty and executive education participants. Most students choose to live in nearby private residential buildings or in students halls of residence such as the International Students House, London.\n\nLBS is expanding its campus in central London. The business school has redeveloped the Marylebone Town Hall into classrooms and offices at the Sammy Ofer Centre. It will further expand it in 2020 (see above).[15]\n\nOrganisation and administration\n\n[edit]\n\nList of the London Business School Deans\n\n[edit]\n\nList of the Deans from 1965 to today:[16]\n\nStarting year Ending year Name 1965 1972 Arthur Earle 1972 1984 Sir James Ball 1984 1989 Peter G. Moore 1989 1997 Sir George Bain 1998 2001 John Quelch 2002 2006 Laura Tyson 2007 2008 Robin Buchanan 2009 2017 Sir Andrew Likierman 2017 Present François Ortalo-Magné\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nAdmission\n\n[edit]\n\nAll candidates must take international exams related to their English abilities (TOEFL or IELTS) and mathematic/logical reasoning skills (GMAT or GRE). Candidates are also asked to write several essays (topics are related to the envisaged programmes). The recruitment process has two steps. The first one consists of sending an application with the following information:[17]\n\nAn application form (administrative and academic information on the candidate, but also his/her career plan and personal ambitions)\n\nSeveral essays\n\nThe GMAT or GRE scores. The average GMAT score is around 708 (90th percentile)\n\nThe TOEFL scores (English test)\n\nA one-page résumé (CV)\n\nTwo reference letters (one academic and one professional)\n\nThe candidate's academic transcript\n\nOnce the application has been accepted, an examination is made by the selection committee. Candidates meeting the criteria of the school will be invited for an interview on campus in London. If this latter step is a success, the candidate receives an offer from LBS.\n\nMaster in Business Administration (MBA)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe school's flagship programme is its full-time 15–21-month Master of Business Administration degree. MBA students take a prescribed set of core courses then choose from roughly 70 different electives. Class size has been around 400 students in every annual cohort. These are broken into 5 streams of approximately 80 students who take all core courses together. The admission process is highly competitive and selective.\n\nBeyond academics, the school puts an emphasis on personal and professional development including leadership, global awareness, and business skill building. These developments are facilitated via specialized workshops led by external consultants, students, and faculty. In addition to a range of elective courses at the London Business School, the school has partnerships with around 32 exchange schools around the world. Each academic year around 100 students spend a term at another leading business school.\n\nThe MBA Programme has one of the world's largest international exchange programmes.[18] Each year approximately 35 per cent of second-year MBAs spend a term abroad at one of over 30 partner schools, including NYU Stern School of Business, IESE Business School, Booth School of Business of The University of Chicago, The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA Anderson School of Management, the MIT Sloan School of Management, Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, Columbia Business School, Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley, McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University, Indian School of Business among others.\n\nExecutive MBA\n\n[edit]\n\nThe school offers four Executive (part-time) MBA degrees, which are completed in 16–20 months. At an academic level, the school offers the same degree to both Executive (part-time) and full-time MBA students. The programmes involve very similar core courses to the full-time MBA, international field work and a wide range of elective courses. The course ends with a capstone together with company project or management report.\n\nExecutive MBA (London).\n\nExecutive MBA (Dubai). The programme begins with an orientation week in London. Following this, students take 10 core modules, which are taught in a four- or five-day block each month in Dubai. Students then undertake electives, which are primarily offered in London, and an international assignment. Two additional core modules take place in London.\n\nEMBA-Global Americas and Europe. A further 140 executives are enrolled in the dual-degree EMBA-Global Programme. It is taught in partnership with Columbia Business School. Graduates are awarded degrees from both universities. The first year involves week-long modules each month alternating between London and New York. In the second year, students select from the full range of electives available at the participating schools.\n\nEMBA-Global Asia. launched in 2008 jointly with Hong Kong University and Columbia. Teaching takes place at all three business schools. While the first year is modelled on the transatlantic EMBA-Global, the school states that because \"EMBA-Global Asia is designed for people who have or will have significant trans-national responsibilities, all courses reflect a greater proportion of global material\".[19]\n\nSloan Masters in Leadership and Strategy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Sloan Fellowship was established in 1968 and is a master's degree programme designed for senior executives, accomplished professionals and entrepreneurs with significant experience of decision-making at strategic levels.[20] The admission process is highly competitive and selective. On average, Sloan Fellows already have 15 years of management experience when being admitted to the programme. A typical class is highly diverse and includes attendees from 13 to 23 countries.[21]\n\nThis 12-month, full-time master's degree programme focuses on strategy, leadership and change, and globalisation. The Sloan programme is also offered at Stanford Graduate School of Business and the MIT Sloan School of Management.\n\nMasters in Finance\n\n[edit]\n\nThe school offers a Master's in Finance (\"MiF\") programme on both a part- and full-time basis. Around 120 students attend the full-time programme, while 60 attend the part-time degree.\n\nMasters in Financial Analysis (MFA)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Masters in Financial Analysis is the most recent programme offered by the London Business School, starting in September 2016 and consists of 12 months of courses. The programme targets recent graduates with less than a year of work experience who plan to start a career in finance, typically as an analyst in an investment bank or in consulting. The curriculum consists of 12 core courses based on 5 pillars (Accounting, Corporate Finance, Asset Management, Financial Markets, and Financial Econometrics). The 12 courses are:[22]\n\nCorporate Finance\n\nCapital Structure\n\nMergers & Acquisitions\n\nInvestment Fundamentals\n\nAsset Management\n\nAnalysis of Financial Statements\n\nSecurities Valuation and Financial Modelling\n\nWorld Economy\n\nFinancial Institutions\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nPrivate Equity\n\nData and Time Series Analytics\n\nStudents must also complete three electives of which a minimum of two must be related to finance.[23] The programme includes a business immersion week within a company (Google, Deloitte, CNN, Accenture, Blackrock etc.) to work on case studies.[24] Finally, students participate in a Field Trip (study trip) that lasts a week. This travel experience consists of many networking dinners, company visits, and company presentations. The following destinations are available: Silicon Valley, Paris, Milan and Munich, Mumbai and Bangalore, or Shanghai.[25]\n\nMasters in Management (MiM)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Masters in Management (MiM) is a one-year master's degree in management aimed at recent graduates who have less than one year of full-time postgraduate corporate work experience or less than two years of experience in a non-traditional business role.\n\nThe programme is structured in 3 terms, composed of the following core courses:[26]\n\nFirst term:\n\nFinancial Accounting\n\nData Analytics for Management\n\nFinance\n\nPerformance in Organisations\n\nSecond term:\n\nThe Global Macroeconomy\n\nMarketing\n\nStrategic Analysis\n\nDecision and Risk Analysis\n\nThird term:\n\nApplied Microeconomics\n\nIntroduction to Management Accounting\n\nStudents must also follow 2 electives and can choose among 30 different courses.[27] The programme includes a business immersion week within a company (Google, Deloitte, CNN, Accenture, Blackrock etc.) to work on case studies.[28] Finally, students have to participate in a Field Trip (study trip) that lasts a week. This travel experience consists of many networking dinners, company visits, and company presentations. The following destinations are available: Silicon Valley, Paris, Milan and Munich, Mumbai and Bangalore, or Shanghai.[29]\n\nThe programme has a very good market placement. 96% of the 2015 graduates accepted an offer within three months of graduation. 40% work in consulting, 35% in finance and the rest in different industries. The most prestigious companies recruit on campus. The top 3 recruiters are the Boston Consulting Group (11 students hired in 2015), Goldman Sachs (8 students hired in 2015), and McKinsey & Company (7 students hired in 2015). Among the other companies that recruited 2 MiM students or more in 2015 are, for example, Oliver Wyman, Arthur D. Little, Deloitte, A.T. Kearney, and Bain & Company.[30]\n\nExecutive education\n\n[edit]\n\nAbout 10,000 executives attend the school's non-degree programmes each year. The school offers a portfolio of 31 Executive Education programmes in general management, strategy, leadership, marketing, human resources and finance.[31] These programmes are split into two main areas, open and custom. About 45 companies per year commission London Business School to design and deliver customised corporate programmes for them, 60% of which are delivered outside the UK.\n\nRankings\n\n[edit]\n\nBusiness School\n\nInternational RankingsEuropean MBA RankingQS (2024)[32]2Financial Times (2024)[33]2Global MBA RankingQS (2024)[34]5Financial Times (2024)[35]8\n\nThe MBA program at LBS is widely considered to be one of the top 10 in the world.
