        "text": "Making His Own Luck\n\nA man named St. Patrick is bound to be lucky. And UNMC’s St. Patrick Reid, PhD, assistant professor of pathology and microbiology, readily admits that he has been a lucky man. But it’s not luck that Dr. Reid is a crucial contributor to the UNMC discovery that the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads through airborne transmission.\n\nTransforming the language of care\n\nOur researchers know access to health care is essential, and they are working to increase participation in clinical trials. Read this special dual-language report on the experience of one non-English-speaking participant of an oncology clinical trial.\n\nLearning in 3D\n\nSee how Jennifer Cera, DNP, and the iEXCEL visualization team are advancing medical education and women's health through 3D animation of the female anatomy.\n\nCombating Anxiety With Innovation\n\nAnxiety among patients considering deep brain stimulation surgery is common, but now UNMC innovators are using simulation and 3D printing to both screen and prepare patients for a surgery in which they remain awake.\n\nHitting New Strides\n\nMunroe-Meyer Institute's intensive therapies are keeping 3-year-old Bentley Hinrichs on his toes. MMI therapists crafted a top-down therapy model for Bentley that his parents say is unlike any they’ve seen.\n\nWomen Empowering Women\n\nNine women in leadership roles at UNMC talk about shaping health care, working through their own struggles and sharing what they've learned to help others succeed."
