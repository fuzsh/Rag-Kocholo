        "text": "There are Three Categories of Sources: Academic, Popular, & Primary\n\n1. Academic Sources (also called Scholarly or Peer-Reviewed)\n\nBooks, journal articles, and book chapters written by academic experts (also called \"peer-reviewed\" or checked by experts). Look for length, depth, originality, academic publisher, & extensive citations. Journal articles are marked \"peer-reviewed\" in Primo.\n\n\"Reference\" sources means brief information found in encyclopedias, dictionaries, glossaries, etc. The library has many of these academic sources, such as The Oxford English Dictionary, The Diagnostic & Statistical Manual 5, and Credo Reference database.\n\nGovernment sources and Think tank or Non-profit research may be counted as academic by some professors, as a press or web source by others, and can be very credible. Look out for any bias--but keep in mind, academic sources can be biased or false as well.\n\n2. Popular sources are non-academic sources like newspapers, magazines, and books you see in a bookstore. These can be helpful to understand the latest events, ideas, and arguments on a topic. They are often very influential and written by skilled researchers or academics.\n\n3. Primary sources: original historical documents, artifacts, classic literature, pop culture, etc. (documents or artifacts that you interpret and use as evidence). Search for influential documents, letters and speeches of famous people, or the text of a law, for example.\n\nScripture is a primary source, as is any work by a philosopher, artist, or literary writer, or the text of a legal document like a Supreme Court decision. These sources hold authority and can be a powerful way to back up your argument.\n\nWhat about non-credible sources? Examples are AI and Wikipedia. You should not cite these sources or plagiarize from them. Their information can be false (especially AI) and the author of the information is either unknown or not human. However, you can get ideas from these sources, like an overview or a citation, as long as you can verify the information from a good source and cite that source.\n\nReference: Encyclopedias & Dictionaries\n\nUseful for:\n\nOverviews\n\nShort biographies\n\nDiscovering key terms\n\nLists of sources (what they cited)\n\nLibrary Subject Databases\n\nUseful for finding:\n\narticles\n\nscholarly journals\n\nmagazines and newspapers\n\ne-books\n\ndissertations & theses\n\nPrimo Search\n\nUseful for finding:\n\nBooks\n\nE-Books\n\nVideos\n\nArticles\n\nReference Entries (brief info)\n\nThe Internet\n\nUseful for finding:\n\nopinion and news articles\n\nbackground information on your topic\n\ngovernment publications\n\narticles by think tanks, non-profits, & churches\n\nopen access (i.e. free) collections/archives\n\nHave you ever been doing research and been asked to pay for an article? If you haven't been going through a library, the chances are good that you have.\n\nPart of what the Library provides for you as a student is an access to information that you can't reach or find through Google. It might seem easier to use Google, but you are really shooting yourself in the foot as a student and a scholar if you miss the wealth of information available through the Library.\n\nBesides that, the Library uses your tuition to purchase your access to hundreds of thousands of articles, e-books, & books, so why not use it?"
