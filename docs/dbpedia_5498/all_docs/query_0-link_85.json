        "text": "Public university in DeKalb, Illinois, US\n\nNorthern Illinois University (NIU) is a public research university in DeKalb, Illinois. It was founded as Northern Illinois State Normal School in 1895 by Illinois Governor John P. Altgeld, initially to provide the state with college-educated teachers. In addition to the main campus in DeKalb, it has satellite centers in Chicago, Naperville, Rockford, and Oregon, Illinois.\n\nThe university is composed of seven degree-granting colleges and has a student body of approximately 16,000. NIU is one of seven public universities in Illinois that compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's, Division I.[5] The athletic teams are known as the Huskies and compete in the Mid-American Conference (MAC).\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nNorthern Illinois University was founded as part of the expansion of the normal school program established in 1857 in Normal, Illinois. In 1895, the state legislature created a board of trustees for the governance of the Northern Illinois State Normal School, which would grow into what is today known as NIU.\n\nIn July 1917, the Illinois Senate consolidated the boards of trustees for the five state normal schools (Eastern Illinois State Normal School, Illinois State Normal School, Northern Illinois State Normal School, Southern Illinois State Normal University, and Western Illinois State Normal School) into one state Normal School Board.\n\nOver the next fifty-eight years, the school and the governing board changed their names several times. In 1921, the legislature gave the institution the name Northern Illinois State Teachers College and empowered it to award the four-year Bachelor of Education degree. In 1941, the Normal School Board changed its name to the Teachers College Board. In 1951 the Teachers College Board authorized the college to grant the degree Master of Science in education, and the institution's Graduate School was established. On July 1, 1955, the state legislature renamed the college Northern Illinois State College and authorized the college to broaden its educational services by offering academic work in areas other than teacher education. The Teachers College Board granted permission for the college to add curricula leading to the degrees Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science. On July 1, 1957, the Seventieth General Assembly renamed Northern Illinois State College as Northern Illinois University in recognition of its expanded status as a liberal arts university.\n\nIn 1965, the Illinois State Teachers College Board became the Board of Governors of State Colleges and Universities and was reorganized to include Northeastern University, Governor's State, and Chicago State Universities. In 1967 authority for Northern Illinois University, Illinois State University, and Sangamon State University were passed on to a newly formed board of regents. In 1984, the board created the position of chancellor for the three regent universities to act as a chief executive for all three schools. In 1996, authority for each of the three regency universities was transferred to three independent boards of trustees, each concerned with only one university.[6]\n\nIn 2008, the university drew international attention when a gunman opened fire in a crowd of students on campus, killing five students and injuring 17 more people before fatally shooting himself.\n\nUniversity presidents\n\n[edit]\n\n13 presidents have served at the university.[7]\n\nJohn Williston Cook (1899–1919)\n\nJ. Stanley Brown (1919–1927)\n\nJoseph Clifton Brown (1927–1929)\n\nKarl L. Adams (1929–1948)\n\nLeslie A. Holmes (1949–1967)\n\nRhoten A. Smith (1967–1971)\n\nRichard J.

The same publication also ranked NIU as 57th best in the country for Public Affairs programs,[18] and within that field, NIU was ranked 4th for Local Government Management and 11th for Public Finance & Budgeting.[18][19] Forbes magazine placed NIU as number 386 on its list of 600 universities in 2021.[20]\n\nScience and research\n\n[edit]\n\nNIU is classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity\".[21] The university is also a member of the Universities Research Association that manages several federal physics laboratories including Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois. The university is expanding its program in accelerator technology.\n\nEstablished in 1963, Northern Illinois University's Center for Southeast Asian Studies[22] (CSEAS) is currently one of seven federally recognized National Resource Centers (NRC) for Southeast Asian foreign language and area studies. NIU has been awarded the Title VI Foreign Language and Area Studies[23] (FLAS) Fellowships since 1974 and Undergraduate NRC grants since 1997.[24] NIU's CSEAS operates within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and offers an undergraduate minor and a graduate concentration in Southeast Asian studies, enrolling more than 1,500 students each year.\n\nCampus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main campus sits on 756 acres in DeKalb and includes 64 major buildings. Additional campus sites include, the Lorado Taft Field Campus (144 acres), Rockford Campus (10 acres), and the Naperville Campus (11.2 acres).[3]\n\nOne of the most prominent buildings on campus is the castle-like Altgeld Hall. It is one of the five castle-themed buildings built according to the suggestion of Governor John Peter Altgeld. The auditorium in Altgeld Hall, which was designed to also function as a ballroom, was restored and can seat up to 500.[25] On the level below the auditorium, the original gym was transformed into a computer classroom.[26] Also on the same level is the NIU Art Museum which occupies two large spaces.\n\nThe East Lagoon near Altgeld is a recreation spot on campus.[27][28] The Holmes Student Center also houses a 78-room hotel.[29]\n\nResidence halls\n\n[edit]\n\nNIU's residence halls (including two complexes with four 12-story towers each) provide several living options to on-campus students.[30] Living-learning floors include the Health Professions House; Business Careers House; Teacher Education and Certification House (TEACH); Honors House; International House; Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics (STEM) House; and Fine Arts House.[31] Other floor options include all-men, all-women, transfers, quiet lifestyle and alcohol-free.\n\nNorthern View Community, which opened in 2008, offers apartments to undergraduate students who are at least two years post-high school, graduate students, law students, or any student who has a dependent and/or a partner or spouse.[32]\n\nThe Fanny Ruth Patterson Complex, a 1,000-bed complex just north of Lincoln Hall, opened to all students in the fall of 2012. It features two residential buildings where students can live in clusters of 12.[33]\n\nAfter an extensive renovation, Grant C Tower reopened in the fall of 2011 with completely new accommodations and furnishings for NIU students. Gilbert Hall, which had not been used as a residence hall since 1995, underwent a complete renovation and re-opened in the fall of 2013. Grant D Tower was renovated and re-opened in the fall of 2013.\n\nDouglas Hall, a part of the pair of residence halls Lincoln-Douglas, was demolished by the spring of 2016. Lucinda Avenue has been extended and used since the spring of 2016. This is a part of the master plan to create a new campus.\n\nResidence halls in use:[34]\n\nGilbert Hall\n\nGrant Towers\n\nNeptune Hall\n\nFanny Ruth Patterson Complex[35]\n\nNorthern View\n\nStevenson Tower\n\nAthletic facilities\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the west side of campus is Brigham Field at Huskie Stadium, the home of NIU football games, which also often hosts other outdoor events. Huskie Stadium, which has a seating capacity over 23,000, is surrounded by large open grassy areas which provide recreation, and also serve as the tailgating lots for football games.

Currently, the NIU Huskies compete in NCAA Division I, FBS (I-A) for Football, in the Mid-American Conference.\n\nNIU's athletic department experienced large growth in reputation in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Almost completely unknown to observers from outside of Illinois before the mid-1990s, the Huskies were ranked as high as 10th in the 2003 AP College Football poll after victories against BCS opponents number 14 Maryland (who finished that season at number 17), number 21 Alabama and Iowa State. In 2010, NIU football had its first undefeated MAC regular season (8-0), and cracked the top 25 in Associated Press and coaches' polls. In 2012, NIU football, after winning another MAC Football Championship earned a place in the Orange Bowl and was the first team to participate in a BCS Bowl from the Mid-American Conference.\n\nNotable alumni\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nNorthern Illinois University Press\n\nNorthern Illinois University shooting\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
