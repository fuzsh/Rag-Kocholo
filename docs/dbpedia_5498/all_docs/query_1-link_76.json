        "text": "Public university in Windsor, Ontario, Canada\n\nFor the Caribbean medical school, see Windsor University School of Medicine.\n\nThe University of Windsor (UWindsor, U of W, or UWin) is a public research university in Windsor, Ontario, Canada.[2] It is Canada's southernmost university.[3] It has approximately 17,500 students.[4] The university was incorporated by the provincial government in 1962 and has more than 150,000 alumni.[5]\n\nThe University of Windsor has nine faculties, including the Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Education, the Faculty of Engineering, Odette School of Business, the Faculty of Graduate Studies, the Faculty of Human Kinetics, the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Nursing, and the Faculty of Science. Through its faculties and independent schools, the university has demonstrated its primary research focuses of automotive, environmental, social justice, and international trade research. In recent years, it has increasingly begun focusing on health, natural science, and entrepreneurship research.[6]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFounding era\n\n[edit]\n\nThe university dates to the founding of the Roman Catholic Assumption College in Windsor, Ontario, in 1857.[7] Assumption College, a primarily theological institution, was founded by the Society of Jesuits in 1857. The Basilian Fathers assumed control of the college in 1870. The college grew steadily, expanding its curriculum and affiliating with several other colleges over the years.[8]\n\nIn 1919, Assumption College affiliated with the University of Western Ontario.[7] This affiliation expanded the curriculum at Assumption, including new general and honours programs for Bachelor of Arts degrees, graduate courses in philosophy, and pre-professional programs in engineering, medicine, and law.[9] At this time, Assumption was one of the largest colleges associated with the University of Western Ontario.\n\nThe school became co-educational in 1934 when it formed and admitted women to attend Holy Names College.[10] In 1937, the first class of women graduated from Assumption College, receiving Bachelor of Arts degrees.[11]\n\nEscalating costs forced Assumption College, a Roman Catholic university, to become a public institution to qualify for public support.[7] In 1953, through an Act of the Ontario Legislature, Assumption College received its own university powers, and ended its affiliation with the University of Western Ontario.\n\nIn 1956, the institution's name was changed to Assumption University of Windsor, by an Act of the Ontario Legislature, with Reverend Eugene Carlisle LeBel, C.S.B. named as its first President. The recently created Essex College, an independent non-denominational college led by Frank A. DeMarco, became an affiliate, with responsibility for the Faculty of Applied Science; the Schools of Business Administration and Nursing; and the departments of Biology, Chemistry, Geology and Geography, and Mathematics and Physics.[12][13]\n\nMid-twentieth century\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early 1960s, the city of Windsor's growth and demands for higher education led to further restructuring. A petition was made to the province of Ontario for the creation of a non-denominational University of Windsor by the board of governors and regents of Assumption University and the board of directors of Essex College.[12] The University of Windsor was established as an institution by the University of Windsor Act on December 19, 1962.[14] The transition from an historic Roman Catholic university to a non-denominational provincial university was an unprecedented development.[12]\n\nOn July 1, 1963, the entire campus with all of its facilities and faculty became known as the University of Windsor. As a 'federated member', Assumption University remained as an integrated institution, granting degrees only in its Faculty of Theology.[12] Father Eugene Carlisle LeBel from Assumption became the inaugural president of the University of Windsor, and Frank A. DeMarco, who had been holding both positions of Principal, as well as Dean of Applied Science at Essex College, became the inaugural Vice President. The university's coats of arms were designed by heraldic expert Alan Beddoe.[15]\n\nSix months later, Assumption University of Windsor made affiliation agreements with Holy Redeemer College (now Académie Sainte-Cécile), Canterbury College and the new Iona College (affiliated with the United Church of Canada). Canterbury College became the first Anglican college in the world to affiliate with a Roman Catholic University.[12][16]\n\nIn 1964, when President LeBel retired, John Francis Leddy was appointed president of the University of Windsor, and presided over a period of significant growth.\n\nPresident Leddy, \"concerned that the University of Windsor should emerge as soon as possible from the status and reputation of a College to that of a University\", set out to review the existing departments. Based on the strengths in the social sciences, economics, political science and psychology, Leddy proposed to the university's board of governors that a law school be established. In September 1968, the Faculty of Law opened with its first class of students.[17]\n\nFrom 1967 to 1977, Windsor grew from approximately 1,500 to 8,000 full-time students.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, this growth continued. Among the new buildings erected were the Odette Business Building and the CAW Student Centre.[citation needed]\n\nThe university partnered with Chrysler in 1996 to establish the Automotive Research and Development Centre, a research lab that focuses on automotive research and education.[18]\n\nTwenty-first century\n\n[edit]\n\nEnrolment reached record heights in 2003 with 16,000 students registered, a 15% increase from the year previous. The increase was driven primarily by first-year students due to the elimination of Grade 13 in Ontario that year.[19] The university developed a number of partnerships with businesses and industry, such as a partnership in 2013 with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment that introduced internships for students and research opportunities.[20]\n\nIn 2008, a satellite campus of the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry opened at the University of Windsor.[21] The partnership between the University of Windsor and the University of Western Ontario followed several years of community and political organizing, and built upon an existing partnership that started in 2002 that sent Western medical students to Windsor for clinical training.[22] The satellite school initially trained undergraduate medical students in the Doctor of Medicine program and has since expanded to offer post-graduate residency programs in family medicine and psychiatry. As of 2023, the program has added almost 100 physicians to the region.[23]\n\nCampus\n\n[edit]\n\nLocated in Canada's traditional \"automotive capital\" across the border from Detroit, the campus is near the United States and its busy port of entry to and from the United States. It is framed by the Ambassador Bridge to the west and the Detroit River to the north.\n\nThe campus covers 51 hectares (130 acres) (contiguous) and is surrounded by a residential neighborhood. The campus features a small arboretum, which represents most of the species from the Carolinian forest. Campus is approximately a 10-minute drive from downtown Windsor. The university has moved some academic programs to the downtown core, including Social Work, the Executive and Professional Education program, Music and Fine Arts. Due to its historical roots in multiple religious institutions, the university's campus has many examples of Christian architecture in addition to its modern flagship buildings like the $10-million dollar Joyce Entrepreneurship Centre.[24]\n\nThe War Memorial Hall (more generally known as Memorial Hall) is a landmark building used as classrooms, labs, and offices. Memorial Hall honours alumni who had enlisted and died in the First World War, and in the Second World War. A bronze tablet remembers the alumni of Assumption College who died in the Second World War.[25]\n\nThe Joyce Entrepreneurship Centre (formerly the “Innovation Centre”) is located on the main campus, on the south side of Wyandotte street.[24] This building houses the EPICentre, and WEtech Alliance. The EPICentre (Entrepreneurship, Practice, and Innovation Centre) is a University of Windsor organization focused on providing students and alumni with the expertise and resources necessary to pursue entrepreneurial goals. The EPICentre is part of the Ontario Centres of Excellence and provides education, mentorship, office space and varying levels of funding to help support startup business.[26] WEtech Alliance is a similar organization, also being an Ontario Centre of Excellence, whose main focus is to support technology startup companies. They provide services to technology startups in the Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent regions, not exclusively to students and alumni from the University of Windsor.[27]\n\nThe CAW Student Centre is the main, comprehensive centre servicing all student needs. It houses a large food court and the main campus bookstore. Also within the CAW Centre: Student Health Services, a dental office, counselling services, a photographer, a pharmacy, the University of Windsor Students' Alliance (UWSA), a Multi-Faith Space, the campus community radio station CJAM-FM, and an information desk. A large public area beside the food court is available for clubs and informational booths to be set up on certain days. For example, during October there is a period where many Canadian law schools set up booths with representatives who answer questions and provide information to undergraduate students.\n\nThe St. Denis Centre, at the south end of campus on College Avenue, is the major athletic and recreational facility for students. It has a weight room, exercise facilities, and a swimming pool. The South Campus Stadium built for the 2005 Pan American Junior Games is beside the St. Denis Centre - which also has dressing rooms for Lancer teams - and borders Huron Church Road, the major avenue to and from the border crossing.[28] The athletics department has become well known for Track & Field, and Men and Women's Basketball.[by whom?]\n\nIn February 2018, the university announced plans to build a new athletic centre, titled the Lancer Sport and Recreation Centre. The new facility will cost $73 million and be 130,000-square-feet. Unlike the current St. Denis Centre, there will be many separate sections of the facility to host different athletic resources; such as a new gymnasium, pool, fitness gym and many multi-purpose rooms, as opposed to a single general-purpose space.[29] Construction for the facility began in October, 2018.[30]\n\nIn June 2019, a new research facility opened up on the campus. The new facility, called the Essex Centre of Research (or CORe) is built on to the south side of the existing Essex Hall science facility. It is an open concept 46,000-square-feet facility, featuring state-of-the-art labs and will primarily be used as a research facility.[31]\n\nStudent residences\n\n[edit]\n\nThe university houses students in three residence halls on campus, with a fourth currently under construction.\n\nAlumni Hall is home to Beyond First-Year and First-Year students. Alumni Hall has all-gender floors and it is a suite-style residence where suites have two bedrooms that share a kitchenette and a three-piece bathroom. Beyond First-Year, students are typically not assigned to the same suite as First-Year students.\n\nCartier Hall is home to First-Year undergraduate students.[32] Cartier Hall has all-gender floors, two students share one room and four students share one washroom.\n\nLaurier Hall is home to Beyond First-Year students and First-Year students. Laurier Hall has single and double rooms on all gender floors.\n\nThe University is currently expanding its residence offerings with a new 160,000 square-foot, six-storey, 440-room building featuring dining facilities and other student amenities. It is expected to be ready for occupancy in 2025.[33]\n\nOrganization and administration\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernance\n\n[edit]\n\nThe university is governed as a public, non-profit, and non-denominational institution by the University of Windsor Act, 1962, which sets out the basic legal obligations and purposes of the institution. Similar to most Canadian universities, the Act establishes the university as a bicameral institution, governed by a Board of Governors and Senate, and led by a chancellor and president.[14]\n\nThe Board is responsible for the oversight of all operational aspects of the university, including strategic direction, budgets, property management, and accountability for the university's financial, human, and physical resources.[34] The Board is also responsible for appointing the chancellor, and the president and vice-chancellor. There are 32 members of the board, 20 external and 12 internal; this size was considered to be large without a compelling reason by the Auditor General of Ontario in a 2022 audit of Ontario universities.[35]\n\nThe Senate is the supreme governing body of the university in academic matters. It is responsible for establishing academic policy, approving new programs and curricular changes, setting admission requirements, and overseeing academic regulation and discipline. It is the Senate that grants degrees, and has the authority to revoke them. The Senate is constituted by members of the faculty, who are either appointed ex-officio by virtue of their role, or elected by the faculty members from their home constituencies. Several students, staff members, and an alumni representative are also appointed to the Senate.[14] There are several standing committees of the Senate that oversee different aspects of the Senate's mandate.[36]\n\nAs is common in Canada, Windsor is formally headed by the chancellor and led on a day-to-day basis by the president and vice-chancellor. The chancellor is the titular head of the university and confers all degrees. The role is mainly ceremonial. Since May 2019 this has been Mary Jo Haddad, a Windsor nursing alumnus and the first woman to take this role, who succeeded Ed Lumley.[37][38] The president serves as the chief executive of the university and the chair of the Senate. As per the Act, the president has supervision and direction over the academic work and administration of the university. The current president is Robert Gordon who has been in this role since September 2019.[39]\n\nFaculties, schools, and departments\n\n[edit]\n\nThe university is organized into nine faculties and schools, which may also be made up of departments. These faculties and schools are led by a dean who is supported by an associate dean. These, along with the department heads and the faculty members, make up each of the faculty's Assembly or Coordinating Council.[40] The university has 524 faculty members.[41]\n\nFaculty of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences\n\nDepartment of Communication, Media, and Film\n\nSchool of Creative Arts\n\nSchool of Dramatic Art\n\nDepartment of English and Creative Writing\n\nDepartment of History\n\nDepartment of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures\n\nDepartment of Philosophy\n\nDepartment of Political Science\n\nDepartment of Psychology\n\nDepartment of Sociology and Criminology\n\nSchool of Social Work\n\nFaculty of Education\n\nFaculty of Engineering\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nDepartment of Mechanical, Automotive, and Materials Engineering\n\nFaculty of Graduate Studies\n\nFaculty of Human Kinetics\n\nFaculty of Law\n\nFaculty of Nursing\n\nOdette School of Business\n\nFaculty of Science\n\nDepartment of Biomedical Sciences\n\nDepartment of Chemistry & Biochemistry\n\nSchool of Computer Science\n\nSchool of the Environment\n\nDepartment of Economics\n\nDepartment of Integrative Biology\n\nDepartment of Mathematics and Statistics\n\nDepartment of Physics\n\nFederated and affiliated institutions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Windsor has three federated or affiliated institutions. It is federated with Assumption University, a Roman Catholic university offering graduate degree programs in religious subjects. The university is affiliated with Canterbury College, a public liberal arts college affiliated with the Anglican Church of Canada, and Iona College, a public liberal arts college formerly affiliated with the United Church of Canada.[42]\n\nFinances\n\n[edit]\n\nWindsor has an endowment of $139 million as of April 2023. The university's total assets (including its campus) are valued at $877 million.[43] Its operating budget for the 2023-2024 academic year was $345 million. The Government of Ontario provided 29% of the university's operating revenue, while tuition fees accounted for the bulk of the remainder at 69%. International student tuition fees comprised 62% of all tuition fee revenue.[44]\n\nThe growing reliance on tuition fees from international students is not unique to the University of Windsor and is common at Ontario's public universities.[35] A 2023 blue-ribbon panel of experts reviewed the financial sustainability of Ontario's universities and colleges and found that Ontario funds universities at just 57% of the national average, due to the government's policies that reduced direct funding to institutions and cut tuition fees for domestic students.[45]\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Windsor is a public research university and a member of Universities Canada.[46] Full-time undergraduate students comprise the majority of the university's enrolment, with the university offering over than 120 majors and minors. There are more than 70 master's (course and research based) and doctoral degree programs.[4][47] In 2020, the university conferred more than 2,700 bachelor's degrees, 1,900 master's degrees, and 50 doctoral degrees.[48]\n\nThe University of Windsor's philosophy department is known for its work in informal logic, and regularly hosts an international argumentation conference through the Ontario Society for the Study of Argumentation.[49] Students, faculty, and visiting researchers collaborate in the inter-departmental research group the Centre for Research in Reasoning, Argumentation, and Rhetoric.[50] As of 2016, the University of Windsor offers an interdisciplinary PhD in Argumentation Studies, the only graduate program in North America with a focus on this field.[51]\n\nThe Faculty of Nursing offers several undergraduate and graduate programs. This includes the accredited clinical Bachelor of Science in Nursing and nurse practitioner programs, along with a research-based doctoral program.[52][53] The undergraduate program is also offered in collaboration with St. Clair College.\n\nThe Faculty of Law, one of seven in Ontario, has a major teaching and research focus on social justice issues and criminal law. Two legal clinics offer training experience for students. The faculty offers a dual undergraduate law program with the University of Detroit Mercy, training students in both Canadian and US law, the only one of its kind in North America.[54]\n\nUniversity of Windsor also provides Inter-Faculty Programs offering cross-departmental majors like Forensics, Environmental studies and Arts & Science concentration. There are nine cooperative education programs for 1,100 students.\n\nReputation and rankings\n\n[edit]\n\nUniversity rankingsGlobal rankingsQS World[55]547Times World[56]501–600U.S News & World Report Global[57]1121Canadian rankingsQS National[55]20Times National[56]21–24U.S News & World Report National[57]27Maclean's Comprehensive[58]14\n\nThe University of Windsor has placed in higher-education school rankings. The 2025 QS World University Rankings ranked the university 547 in the world, and 20th in Canada. The 2023 Times Higher Education World University Rankings placed Windsor 501-600 in the world.

In terms of national rankings, Maclean's ranked Windsor 14th in their 2024 comprehensive university rankings.\n\nScholarships\n\n[edit]\n\nThe university joined Project Hero, a scholarship program cofounded by General (Ret'd) Rick Hillier, for the families of fallen Canadian Forces members.[59][60]\n\nThe university established Rosa Schreiber Award with the assistance of former University of Windsor Professor Economics, Alan A. Brown. From the university's Senate Committee on Student Awards: The competition award is open to arts or social science students in Year 2 or beyond. Applicants must submit a 1,500–2,000-word essay on some aspect of moral courage. Submission must be made to the Office of Student Awards. This competition will be held in alternate years. It was established in 1995 to honour Rosa Schreiber, an Austrian freedom fighter who risked her life to help others during World War II.[citation needed]\n\nStudent life\n\n[edit]\n\nInternational students from nearly 100 countries make up approximately 29% of the student population. Despite the large number of international students, the majority of students are domestic and come from Windsor and Essex County; 12% of full-time students originate from the Greater Toronto Area.[61][62][4]\n\nDemographics of student body (2022)[note 2] Undergraduate[note 3] Graduate Male[63][64] 44% 61% Female[63][64] 56% 39% Canadian student[4] 93% 27% International student[4] 7% 73%\n\nIn addition to the newspaper The Lance, which is partially funded by the UWSA and provides stories written by student volunteers, students at the University of Windsor publish several independent publications. The Student Movement is a grassroots, independent, student run paper providing a critical discourse towards administration and the UWSA.[citation needed] The Issue is a student run electronic publication covering international social justice issues.[citation needed]\n\nLeddy Library is the main campus library. The Paul Martin Law Library serves the Faculty of Law. The Canadian Auto Workers Union helped to build the CAW Student Centre which is a central meeting place for students.[citation needed] The university has a unique agreement with the Ambassador Duty-Free Store at Canada's busiest border crossing which provides student jobs, 400 parking spaces, and an annual cash annuity to the school.[citation needed]\n\nStudents also take advantage of the downtown area conveniently down the street. From restaurants to printing shops, to Bubble Tea Cafés, there are a variety of shops of interest to students.\n\nToldo Lancer Center is the newest addition to the University of Windsor. It provides many different kinds of recreational services for students including free access to the Fitness Center to workout, opened every day. Students can also enjoy their access to the Dennis Fairall Fieldhouse and state of the art additions including Lancer Commons, Pool, Triple Gymnasium and Multipurpose Rooms. The Toldo Lancer Center officially opened to students on July 4, 2022.[citation needed]\n\nStudent unions\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are three student unions at Windsor. The University of Windsor Students' Alliance, otherwise known as the UWSA, represents all full-time undergraduate students at the University of Windsor, located in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. It provides services such as an Office of Student Empowerment, financial awards, a food pantry, representation on various University of Windsor bodies, a weekly student newspaper, The Lance, and various other services and programs.[65]\n\nThe Organization of Part-time University Students (OPUS) represents part-time undergraduate students, while the Graduate Student Society represents all graduate students at the university.[66][67] All three student unions are affiliated with the Canadian Federation of Students.[68]\n\nAthletics\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Windsor Lancers\n\nThe University is represented in U Sports by the Windsor Lancers.
