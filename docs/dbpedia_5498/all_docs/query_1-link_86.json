        "text": "Public university in Flagstaff, Arizona, US\n\nNorthern Arizona University (NAU) is a public research university based in Flagstaff, Arizona.[9] Founded in 1899, it was the final university established in the Arizona Territory.[10]\n\nNAU is one of the three universities governed by the Arizona Board of Regents and accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.[11] As of fall 2023, 28,194 students were enrolled at NAU with 21,550 at the Flagstaff campus.[12] The university is divided into seven academic colleges offering about 130 undergraduate and graduate programs, and various academic certificates. Students can take classes and conduct research in Flagstaff, online, and at more than 20 statewide locations, including the Phoenix Biomedical Core research campus.\n\nThe university is classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity\" and ranked No. 187 in the National Science Foundation (NSF) national research rankings for fiscal year 2022.[13] NAU's astronomy faculty led the observations of the NASA DART mission,[14] co-discovered several astronomical bodies such as Eris and Sedna, and are major participants in the search for the hypothetical Planet Nine.[15] The university is a primary institution of the Lowell Observatory.[16] Alumni include 4 Truman Scholars, 11 Goldwater Scholars, and 3 Udall Scholars.[17][18]\n\nThe NAU Lumberjacks compete in the NCAA Division I primarily as part of the Big Sky Conference, and have won several national championships in cross country running. At an elevation of 6,950 ft (2,120 m) above sea level, the school's athletic facilities are used by Olympic and professional athletes worldwide for prestige high altitude training.[19]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nInitially named the Northern Arizona Normal School, the institution opened on September 11, 1899, with 23 students, two faculty members—one, Almon Nicholas Taylor, who was also the school president—and \"two copies of Webster's International Dictionary bound in sheepskin\" as teaching resources.[20] It was one of about 180 \"normal schools\" founded by state governments in the 19th century to train teachers for the rapidly growing public common schools. Some closed but most steadily expanded their role and became state colleges in the early 20th century and state universities in the late 20th century.\n\nThe first graduating class, in 1901, consisted of four women who received credentials to teach in the Arizona Territory. In 1925, the Arizona State Legislature allowed the school, which was then called the Northern Arizona State Teachers College (ASTC), to grant bachelor of education degrees. In 1929, the school became Arizona State Teachers College at Flagstaff.[21]\n\nAlso in 1929, the Great Depression struck the nation, and the ASTC found new meaning in community outreach. Rather than collapsing, the school endured through the depression. In fact, Grady Gammage, the school president at the time, described higher education as \"a 'depression industry' that fared well in hard times.\" Despite financial difficulties, enrollment increased from 321 students to 535 students between 1930 and 1940, and graduate work was introduced in 1937.[22]\n\nASTC provided an education during economically trying times, often creating jobs to help students afford their education; they worked in the school-owned dairy farm, in the campus kitchen and dining hall, and as newspaper deliverers. The self-sufficiency of the college helped conserve monetary resources, and it was a major contributor to the local economy of the surrounding Flagstaff community, injecting almost a half-million dollars in 1938.[23]\n\nASTC was known for its diverse student body and ethnic tolerance. In fact, the first Hopi to receive a college degree was Ida Mae Fredericks in 1939.[23] Students came from rural farms, mining families, the East Coast, and points between. During the depression, fraternities and clubs sprang up, reflecting the diversity of backgrounds and interests.\n\nDuring World War II, NAU was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.[24] Enrollment at the university dropped sharply at the beginning of World War II, dropping to 161 in 1945.[25] However, the end of World War II brought increased enrollment as returning veterans continued their education.\n\nThe end of the war also expanded programs beyond teaching degrees, especially in the fields of art and science. To reflect this growth, the school changed its name to Arizona State College at Flagstaff in 1945 and, in 1958, became Arizona State College. Also in 1958, the world-renowned forestry program was started. With further growth over the next two decades, the Arizona Board of Regents granted Arizona State College university status as Northern Arizona University in 1966.[21]\n\nThe university received authorization to offer Doctors of Philosophy and Education in 1968, with the first doctoral candidates graduating in 1973.[26]\n\nIn 2007, the business college was renamed The W. A. Franke College of Business, with entrepreneur Bill Franke as the namesake of the new 111,000 sq ft (10,300 m2) business complex.[27]\n\nIn 2022, José Luis Cruz Rivera became the university's 17th president. In 2023, the university announced the establishment of NAU Health initiative, which will include the creation of a medical school through the College of Medicine.[28]\n\nCampuses\n\n[edit]\n\nFlagstaff campus\n\n[edit]\n\nSet across 829 forested acres, the Flagstaff campus houses academic, administrative and residential buildings.\n\nAt 6,950 ft (2,120 m) above sea level, NAU is the fourth highest-elevation four-year college campus in the country. The main campus is surrounded by the largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in the world[29] and enjoys a four-season climate, with the host city of Flagstaff averaging 90.1 inches of snow per year.[30] Winter skiing is accessible at Arizona Snowbowl, which is an alpine ski resort located on the San Francisco Peaks, 7 mi (11 km) northwest of town, and the Grand Canyon and Sedona are short drives away.[31] Flagstaff is regularly ranked among the best college towns in the United States.[32]\n\nFor many years, the university has prioritized sustainability initiatives,[33] and campus-wide programs and resources encourage the entire university community to get involved with sustainability efforts. There are more than a dozen LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design)-certified buildings on campus and all new construction must meet strict LEED standards. Dining services and facilities contribute to a composting initiative, collecting more than 300,000 pounds of material each year, which prevents 250 metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. Much of the campus uses renewable wind and solar technologies and the university is investigating opportunities to utilize the vast ponderosa pine forests around campus for biomass electricity or heat production. NAU President José Luis Cruz Rivera pledged carbon neutrality at NAU by 2030.\n\nStatewide campuses and NAU Online\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to the more than 21,000 students who study on the Flagstaff campus, NAU currently serves another 8,000 students online and statewide. In order to provide access and affordability to all Arizona residents, NAU offers more than 130 accredited degree programs at more than 20 statewide locations.[34] NAU also has partnerships with community colleges and NAU–Yavapai, a collaboration with Yavapai College in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The university's oldest branch campus, and the largest, is NAU–Yuma.\n\nNAU Online offers more than 140 fully-online options at all degree levels, including undergraduate and graduate degrees, certificates, and minors.[35]\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nColleges and programs\n\n[edit]\n\nAcross seven colleges (with an eighth, the College of Medicine in development), NAU offers more than 130 undergraduate degree programs, more than 80 master's degree programs, and about 20 doctoral programs, along with 50 undergraduate and 40 graduate certificates.\n\nThe top undergraduate academic degree plans by enrollment for the 2023 fall semester were:[12]\n\nPsychological Sciences\n\nNursing\n\nBiomedical Science\n\nCriminology and Criminal Justice\n\nBiology\n\nElementary Education\n\nCollege of Arts and Letters\n\n[edit]\n\nThe College of Arts and Letters houses numerous departments, including:\n\nSchool of Art\n\nComparative Cultural Studies\n\nEnglish\n\nGlobal Languages and Cultures\n\nHistory\n\nPhilosophy\n\nKitt School of Music\n\nTheatre\n\nThe college also oversees the Clara M.

Previously, NAU, like Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, required 16 core courses for assured admissions. However, not all Arizona high schools offer the 16 core courses, especially in second languages and math. NAU's pilot program removed the second language course availability barrier and will accept more fourth-year math courses, allowing more students the opportunity to pursue a postsecondary education.\n\nFall first-year student statistics[69][70][71][72][73][74]\n\n2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Applicants 37,805 44,855 42,872 37,386 36,855 36,831 36,875 36,511 31,995 Admits 34,383 35,881 33,592 30,523 31,312 30,428 29,812 28,495 20,727 % Admitted 90.94 79.99 78.35 81.60 84.95 82.61 80.85 78.04 64.78 Enrolled 5,473 5,575 5,297 5,217 3,395 3,668 3,872 5,607 3,872 Avg Freshman GPA 3.70 3.70 3.70 3.70 3.64 3.61 3.60 3.60 3.40 Avg ACT Composite 22 22 22 22 23 23 23 23 23\n\nTuition and fees\n\n[edit]\n\nThe average cost of tuition and fees for a full-time, Arizona resident undergraduate student for the 2023–24 school year is $12,652[75] and $28,900 for out-of-state undergraduates.[76] NAU also participates in the Western Undergraduate Exchange Program, which offers lower tuition rates for students from the Western United States. For 2023–24, WUE tuition and fees are $18,328.[77] NAU is also part of two programs, the Western Regional Graduate[78] program and the Professional Student Exchange Program,[78] that allow approved graduate students from other Western states to pay in-state tuition.\n\nNAU's Access2Excellence (A2E) initiative, announced in April 2022 by President José Luis Cruz Rivera, will provide a tuition-free undergraduate college education for every Arizona resident with a household income of $65,000 or below, assuring tuition will be fully covered by scholarships and financial aid.
