        "text": "Public research university located in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada\n\nThe University of Ontario Institute of Technology,[5][6] branded as Ontario Tech University or Ontario Tech, is a public research university located in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. The university's main campus is located on approximately 160 hectares (400 acres) of land in northern Oshawa, while its secondary satellite campus is situated in downtown Oshawa. The university is a co-educational institution that operates seven academic faculties.\n\nThe institution was founded in 2002 and adopted the brand name Ontario Tech University in 2018.[7][8] The legal name of the university is unchanged.[6]\n\nIn its first decade of operation, the university developed its main campus with the construction of several new buildings. In 2011, the university opened its secondary campus in downtown Oshawa.\n\nIn 2021, there were approximately 10,100 undergraduates and 970 graduate students enrolled at the university. As of 2022, the university holds an association with over 25,500 alumni.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Ontario Institute of Technology was founded in 2002 by the passage of Bill 109, the University of Ontario Institute of Technology Act, 2002, by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario on June 27, 2002. It is a public university emphasizing science and technology and was a part of the Ontario government's initiative to create more spaces in post-secondary institutions for the flood of post-secondary students in 2003.[9] Ontario Tech is located in the Durham Region of Ontario.[10]\n\nOntario Tech offers graduate and post-graduate programs and research opportunities.[11] At first there were 947 students in September 2003 and total enrollment was over 5,000 in the 2007–2008 school year.[12] The student population today is over 10,000 students.[10]\n\nConstruction on the university's first buildings, designed by Diamond Schmitt Architects, began in 2002, and included a geothermal heating and cooling system extending 190m under the main campus quadrangle.[citation needed] These first buildings, three in total, were completed by the end of 2004. The Ontario Power Generation (OPG) building (funded by OPG) and the Campus Recreation and Wellness Centre (CRWC) were built in 2007.[13] The university purchased the historic Regent Theatre in downtown Oshawa in 2009 and renovated it for use as a lecture theatre in 2010.[14] The Clean Energy Research Laboratory (CERL) opened in 2010. In 2011, the Automotive Centre of Excellence (ACE) and the Energy Systems and Nuclear Science Research Centre (ERC) opened. In 2014, the UOIT-Baagwating Indigenous Student Centre (UBISC) opened. In 2017, the Software and Informatics Research Centre (SIRC) was built.[13]\n\nIn March 2019, the school was rebranded as Ontario Tech University.[15][16][17]\n\nOn June 10, 2019, construction of Shawenjigewining (SHA) Hall began. The building officially opened November 4, 2021.[18]\n\nCampus\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth campus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe North campus is located at 2000 Simcoe St North and is considered the 'main' campus. The Faculty of Business and Information Technology (FBIT), the Faculty of Energy Systems and Nuclear Science (FESNS), the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science (FEAS), the Faculty of Science (FS), the Faculty of Health Science (FHS), and the Faculty of Graduate Studies are located on the North Campus.[13]\n\nFacilities on the North campus include: the award-winning Campus Library, the Science Building, the Business and Information Technology Building, the Energy Systems and Nuclear Science Research Centre (ERC), the Ontario Power Generation (OPG) building, the one-of-a-kind Automotive Centre of Excellence (ACE), the Software and Informatics Research Centre (SIRC), the Campus Recreation and Wellness Centre (CRWC), the University Pavilion (UP), the Student Life building, and student housing. The North campus is co-located with Durham College's campus and both institutions share various facilities including the Campus Library, the CRWC, and the bookstore, and various services including parking, security, and IT services.[13] The university has plans in conjunction with Durham College to expand further north in Oshawa over the next few years, on land that they have already purchased.[13] Part of this plan includes the Centre for Cybercrime Research, a university-owned building focusing on research and education in various aspects of cybercrime.[19]\n\nAutomotive Centre of Excellence\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Automotive Centre of Excellence (ACE) is a multi-level testing and research centre including a five-storey high wind tunnel that allows for climatic, durability, and life cycle testing. It was built by the university in partnership with General Motors (GM) Canada, the Government of Ontario, the Government of Canada and the Partners for the Advancement of Collaborative Engineering Education (PACE).[13] The total cost of the facility was approximately $100 million.[20] It is used by the university for research and education and is also used by GM Canada and its other sponsors for various purposes, including testing new car prototypes.[13] It is divided into two sections: a core research facility (CRF) and an integrated research and training facility (IRTF), with a total area of approximately 16,300 square metres.[21]\n\nThe IRTF is the main portion of the building, spanning five floors with space for research and education. This portion of the ACE building is open to university students and is used as a place to study.[13] The CRF, usually referred to as 'the wind tunnel', has full-size chambers for full climatic, structural durability and life cycle testing including a climatic wind tunnel. In this test chamber, wind speeds can exceed 240 kilometres per hour, temperatures range from −40 to +60 °C and relative humidity ranges from 5 to 95 per cent. The climatic wind tunnel has a variable nozzle that can optimize the airflow from 7 to 13 square metres (and larger) as well as a large flexible chassis dynamometer integrated into a 11.5-metre turntable; these allow for vehicles in a wide range of sizes to be tested at various angles of windflow, including crosswind. The chamber also includes a solar array that can replicate the effects of the sun.[22]\n\nEnergy Research Centre\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Energy Research Centre (ERC) is a 9,290-square-metre, four-storey facility focusing on clean energy technologies that houses Ontario Tech's nuclear engineering undergraduate program, the only program of its kind in Canada. This building is used for research in geothermal, hydraulic, hydrogen, natural gas, nuclear, solar, and wind energy technologies. The ERC is the result of a joint $45.4-million investment from the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario as part of the Knowledge Infrastructure Program.[23]\n\nThe ERC contains a 72-seat lecture theatre, three 50-seat classrooms, two 30-seat tutorial rooms with flexible seating, 11 student-study (breakout) rooms, 12 labs, dedicated working stations for graduate students, and administrative space and offices for staff and faculty. One of the more notable labs is an extensive nuclear power plant computer simulation, the most extensive of its kind.[23] The second, third, and fourth floors of the ERC have indoor connections to the adjacent Business and Information Technology building.[13] The ERC features a glass-covered atrium with a large hanging metal-wire sculpture of Northern Dancer, the famous, award-winning Canadian horse from Windfields Farm. Ontario Tech and Durham College purchased the core area of Windfield Farms in 2013, including the site where Northern Dancer was buried; the sculpture is a tribute.[24]\n\nDowntown campus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Downtown campus is located in the downtown region of Oshawa, approximately ten minutes away from the North campus. Most of Ontario Tech's buildings in the downtown campus have not yet been named and are instead referred to by the address at which they are located. The Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities (FSSH) and the Faculty of Education (FE) are located at the downtown campus.[13]\n\nFacilities at the Downtown campus include: Bordessa Hall, 61 Charles Street, Regent Theatre, 2 Simcoe Street South, 11 Simcoe Street North, and the UOIT-Baagwating Indigenous Student Centre (UBISC).[25]\n\nRegent Theatre\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Regent Theatre is a 609-seat lecture theatre used by the university that, despite being a historic location, is fully outfitted with electric sockets and fold-down side-desks for students' computers. When not in use by the university, the theatre is also rented out for events in the evenings and on weekends,[14] including regular use by the Ontario Philharmonic Orchestra, who hold most of their concerts in the Regent Theatre.[26]\n\nStudent housing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe residences for Ontario Tech are shared by Ontario Tech and Durham College students, as well as Trent University students studying at Trent's Oshawa campus. There are two separate residences on campus: Simcoe Village and South Village. Both of these residences are managed by Campus Living Centres.[citation needed]\n\nSustainability\n\n[edit]\n\nOntario Tech has many 'green energy' features on campus, including solar panels on the roof of the Promenade, geothermal heating sourced from deep under the Polonsky Commons, and green roofs to reduce heating and cooling costs.[27]\n\nAdministration\n\n[edit]\n\nPresidents\n\n[edit]\n\nGary Polonsky 2002–2006\n\nRonald Bordessa 2006–2011\n\nTim McTiernan 2011–2017\n\nSteven A. Murphy 2017–present\n\nBoard members\n\n[edit]\n\nLyn McLeod 2002–2008\n\nPerrin Beatty 2008–present\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe university aims to educate its students in a \"technology-enriched environment\", and offers IT services and leased laptop programs to help support this pedagogy.[28][29] The university's academic year is organized into three semesters, Fall, Winter, and Spring/Summer.[30]\n\nThe university's academic programs are administered by six faculties, the Faculty of Business and Information Technology, the Faculty of Education, the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, the Faculty of Health Science, the Faculty of Science, and the Faculty of Social Science and Humanities. Most faculties are further organized into smaller academic departments and schools. Graduate programs are coordinated by the School of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies. The university also provides continuing education through its Continuous Learning department.[31] In 2020, the university had a total of 318 instructional faculty members, 264 of whom held either a doctorate, professional degree, or another type of terminal degree.[32]\n\nIn 2019, the university conferred 1,755 bachelor's degrees, 124 professional degrees, 227 graduate degrees, and 84 graduate diplomas.[33] More than a third of all graduate degrees conferred by the university was from an engineering-related program.[34]\n\nThe university holds membership with several national and international academic postsecondary organizations, such as Universities Canada.[35]\n\nReputation\n\n[edit]\n\nUniversity rankingsGlobal rankingsARWU World[36]901–1000Times World[37]601–800U.S News & World Report Global[38]1121Canadian rankingsARWU National[36]25–26Times National[37]20–27U.S News & World Report National[38]27Maclean's Undergrad[39]9Maclean's Reputation[40]31\n\nIn Maclean's 2023 ranking of Canadian universities, Ontario Tech University placed ninth, out of 19 universities in their primarily undergraduate university category, and 31st out of 49 universities in their national reputational survey.[40]\n\nOntario Tech University has ranked in several international post-secondary school rankings. In the 2023 Academic Ranking of World Universities rankings, the university was placed 901–1000 among 1000 post-secondary institutions ranked.[36] In the Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2023, the university was ranked 601–800 out of 2,671 post-secondary institutions.[37] In U.S. News & World Report 2022–23 global university rankings, the university placed 1121st out of 2,459 schools.[38]\n\nResearch\n\n[edit]\n\nThe university engages in academic research and operates eight research institutes and centres, as well as several research groups. Additionally, the university also operates a joint research facility with the University of Technology Sydney, the Joint Research Centre for AI for Health and Wellness.[41]\n\nAs of 2022, 11 faculty members from the university hold Canada Research Chairs. Seven chairholders sit on the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, and two sit on the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.[42] In the 2020–21 academic year, the university received 159 research awards and approximately $4.6 million in funding from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council, 49 research rewards and nearly $2 million in funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Council, and six research rewards and $433,375 in funding from the Canadian Institute of Health.[43]\n\nIn 2020, the university had a sponsored research income of approximately $17.6 million. In the same year, the university's faculty averaged a sponsored research income of $80,900, while graduate students averaged a sponsored research income of $21,700.[44]\n\nAdmission\n\n[edit]\n\nThe requirements for admission differ between students from Ontario, students from other provinces, and students based outside of Canada, due to a lack of uniforming in marking schemes between provinces and countries.[45] In addition to academic requirements, the university also requires applicants whose first language is not English to present proof that they are proficient in the English language.[46]\n\nIn 2018, the university reported a retention rate of 81.1 per cent of first year students who advanced onto their second year at the university.[47]\n\nStudent life\n\n[edit]\n\nDemographics of student body (2021–22)[48][49] Undergraduate Graduate Male 57.8% 53.1% Female 42.2% 46.9% Canadian student 92.2% 66.5% International student 7.8% 33.5%\n\nIn the 2021–22 academic year, the university student body included 10,030 full-time and part-time undergraduate students, and 1,020 full-time and part-time graduate students.[3] The student body is primarily made up of Canadians, with over 90 per cent of the student body holding Canadian citizenship.[50]\n\nOrganizations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe university's student body is represented through the Ontario Tech Student Union (OTSU).[51] The students' union was formed in 2017. Prior to that, the university's student body was represented by a student association that represented the student bodies of Ontario Tech and Durham College. The association's split resulted from a controversy over accountability and student fees between the two student bodies.[52] Services provided by the OTSU includes academic advocacy, legal services, and medical insurance.[51] The student union sanctions several student-run organizations, including clubs based on common interest, and institutional student-run societies for most academic faculties.[53]\n\nThe university formally does not grant recognition to any fraternities or sororities, and that they are independent organizations that are not associated or sanctioned with the university.[54] However, there are several fraternities and sororities that operate around the campus.[55] These organizations, some of which are residential and some of which are not, host events for students and do philanthropy work for the surrounding community. Tau Kappa Epsilon has an annual charity event known as \"Teke in a box\" that raises money for the campus food centre,[56] and Zeta Psi has an annual charity event known as \"Zete car push\".[57]\n\nThe Chronicle is a student newspaper that serves the student bodies of Ontario Tech University and Durham College. The newspaper is produced by Durham College journalist students.[58]\n\nAthletics\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Ontario Tech Ridgebacks\n\nThe university's sports teams compete as the Ontario Tech Ridgebacks in U Sports' Ontario University Athletics (OUA) conference. Varsity teams include badminton, basketball, curling, dance, field lacrosse, golf, ice hockey, rowing and soccer. The university's athletic department also maintains sports clubs for cricket, esports, and equestrian.[59]\n\nInsignias and other representations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Latin name of the university is Universitas Ontario Instituto Technologiae and its motto is Cogitando et Agendo Ducemus, meaning \"By thinking and doing we shall lead\".[60] Ontario Tech's slogan is \"Challenge, Innovate, Connect\".[10]\n\nBranding\n\n[edit]\n\nThe official name of the institution under provincial legislation is the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, and is used in formal documentation issued by the institution, including academic degrees.[61]\n\nHowever, the university publicly operates under a different name, Ontario Tech University. The institution explored the idea of adopting a new name in 2018, given that the abbreviation 'UOIT' was hard to pronounce and made marketing difficult.[62] The subject became a topic of discussion for months, followed by feedback from both the stakeholders and the school.[63] The operating name was adopted by the university in March 2019, which led to a system-wide revamp in all promotional materials including banners, merchandise, and the website. The change was met with mixed reviews.[64]\n\nCoat of arms\n\n[edit]\n\nCoat of arms of Ontario Tech University\n\nNotes\n\nGranted 15 July 2009[65]\n\nCrest\n\nA falcon guardant wings addorsed and inverted Azure holding in its dexter claw a thunderbolt Argent.\n\nEscutcheon\n\nArgent an open book proper bound Azure on a chief indented Azure a canoe inverted Argent.\n\nSupporters\n\nTwo thoroughbred horses Azure crined and unguled Argent standing on a grassy mount set with trillium flowers Proper.\n\nMotto\n\nCogitando Et Agendo Ducemus (By Thinking And Doing We Shall Lead)\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nA number of individuals are associated with the university either as alumni or members of its administration and faculty.
