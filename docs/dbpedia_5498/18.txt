History

In 1985 it acquired the former South Villa Estate campus of the University of London's Bedford College in Regent's Park. The site was leased by Bedford College in 1908, and a new set of buildings designed by the architect Basil Champneys was opened by Queen Mary in 1913. The buildings were modified and added to over the years, especially after bomb damage during the Second World War. Bedford College merged with Royal Holloway College (another college of the University of London) in 1985 and moved to Royal Holloway's campus at Egham in Surrey, vacating the premises in Regent's Park. Regent's College gradually expanded and the European Business School London moved to the College campus in 1987.[3]

In July 2012 it was announced that Regent's College had been awarded taught degree-awarding powers (TDAP) from 1 September 2012.[4] Institutions that have degree-awarding powers in the UK are known as "recognized bodies" of which there are over 150. In February 2013 Regent's College agreed to acquire American InterContinental University London from Career Education Corporation.[5] In March 2013 the UK's Department for Business Innovation and Skills announced that Regent's College had met the criteria to become a university. Regent awarded silver by TEF in 2021 ranking.[6]

Validation of research degrees (MPhil and PhD) was transferred from the University of Wales to the University of Northampton for students starting from September 2016.[2] This followed the decision of the University of Wales to withdraw from validating other institutions as part of its merger with the University of Wales Trinity Saint David.[7]

The university's taught degree awarding powers were renewed for a further six-year term in 2018, after which it will be eligible for permanent degree awarding powers.[8]
