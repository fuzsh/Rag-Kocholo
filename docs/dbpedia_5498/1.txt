1. List a bibliography on a theological discipline.

We have bibliographies on the Divinity Research Guide (http://libguides.regent.edu/divinity?hs=a). Find "Bibliographies," the 5th blue tab in the middle of the screen to find several thematic bibliographies, such as Systematic Theology by Doctrinal Persuasion.

2. A dictionary of theology or a theological discipline.

If you search "theological dictionary" in the Summon tool, which is the search bar in the middle of the Library homepage (www.regent.edu/lib), you should find several results. You can click on the title of one of the dictionaries and an option will be provided on the right side of the screen to cite the resource.

3. A book of theology written by a patristic writer after the council of Nicaea (translated in English).

For numbers 3-8, I recommend looking up specific scholars, (ie: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patristics) then searching for his/her work the Library catalog by author (http://library.regent.edu/search/a). You can find theologians by a simple Google search (ie: "medieval/scholastic scholar), or you may find these theology-based websites from the Divinity Research Guide to be helpful: http://libguides.regent.edu/content.php?pid=207432&sid=4922460.
