KPOV is grateful for an incredible group of volunteers who give time and energy to help the station thrive. Each year, we honor individuals who have excelled in their service to KPOV with our Volunteer of the Year Award. This year, we are proud to present the award to Stacie “Stacie Dread” Johnson and Stu “Studio” McDonald!

Stacie is a volunteer who is dedicated to building community at KPOV. She led the planning of the fall volunteer picnic, and also created a fun, welcoming atmosphere by decorating the station for the spring fund drive. She is always willing to lend a hand in the broadcast studio during fund drives, whether filling in on specials or helping her fellow talk show hosts with their live fundraising shows.

Stu has donated an extensive amount of time to creating a better, safer workplace for the KPOV community. Our electrical upgrade, emergency lighting, new floors, and office lighting are all thanks to Stu’s efforts.
