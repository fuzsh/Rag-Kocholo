It's a way to ensure that the voices of independent artists, local musicians, and community leaders continue to be heard. By voting for us, you're not only giving us a well-deserved pat on the back but also amplifying the power of community radio to unite, inspire, and entertain.\n\nGrab your phone, tablet, or laptop and head over to the voting page.\n\nVoting for The Source's Best of Central Oregon Reader's Poll is live now through Sunday July 14. Submit your ballot online, or turn in a paper ballot (found in The Source's weekly publication) to The Source’s office. Online voting closes on July 14 at midnight, while print ballots are due by 3pm.\n\nKPOV is grateful for an incredible group of volunteers who give time and energy to help the station thrive. Each year, we honor individuals who have excelled in their service to KPOV with our Volunteer of the Year Award. This year, we are proud to present the award to Stacie “Stacie Dread” Johnson and Stu “Studio” McDonald!\n\nStacie is a volunteer who is dedicated to building community at KPOV. She led the planning of the fall volunteer picnic, and also created a fun, welcoming atmosphere by decorating the station for the spring fund drive. She is always willing to lend a hand in the broadcast studio during fund drives, whether filling in on specials or helping her fellow talk show hosts with their live fundraising shows.\n\nStu has donated an extensive amount of time to creating a better, safer workplace for the KPOV community. Our electrical upgrade, emergency lighting, new floors, and office lighting are all thanks to Stu’s efforts."
