Eric D. Johnson, the creative force behind Fruit Bats, doesn't spend a lot of time looking in the rearview mirror. But with the 20th anniversary of his first Fruit Bats release (2001's Echolocation) on his mind, it seemed as good a time as any to take stock of his work-and he's doing so in the form of Sometimes a Cloud Is Just a Cloud: Slow Growers, Sleeper Hits and Lost Songs (2001-2021), a two-disc collection that tracks the history of Fruit Bats from it's earliest days to right now. Thoughtfully compiled by Johnson himself, this set is split in two distinct halves.

Includes a 4-COLOR BOOKLET with liner notes from Alison Brown, Dave Dennison, and Mike Marshall, plus ARCHIVAL PHOTOS and SESSION DOCUMENTS. Unavailable on all formats since the early 2000s, Alison Brown's Grammy-nominated debut album Simple Pleasures was a leap forward for Scruggs-rooted banjo playing when it was first released in 1990. This led to her immediate recognition as a banjo pioneer and to her win in 1991 of the Banjo Player of the Year award from the International Bluegrass Music Association (the first female to win an Instrumentalist of the Year award).\n\nThe album was produced in 1989 by acoustic music icon and frequent Jerry Garcia cohort David Grisman (architect of \"Dawg Music,\" the jazz-influenced breakout fringe of the bluegrass genre) and recorded with a cast of all-star musicians at Dawg Studio in Marin, CA. Players on the sessions included Alison Krauss (fiddle), David Grisman (mandolin), Mike Marshall (guitar, fiddle, mandolin), Matt Eakle (flute), Joe Craven (percussion) and Jim Kerwin (bass). The album's 12 tunes were all written by Alison and include the first recorded versions of some of her most well-known compositions, including \"Mambo Banjo,\" \"Leaving Cottondale,\" and \"Weetabix.\" For the 2024 reissue, the original 8-track, 1\" multitrack tapes were transferred at a resolution of 192kHz/36-bit, and remixed and mastered by Matt Coles at Compass Sound Studio in Nashville. Simple Pleasures will be released on LP, CD, and all digital platforms and features liner notes from Mike Marshall, recording engineer Dave Dennison, and Alison. The CD and DL versions include 3 bonus tracks of never-before-released demos recorded at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, CA, in 1988, produced by Richard Greene and featuring David Grisman (mandolin), Mike Marshall (guitar), Todd Phillips (bass), and Greene (fiddle). Originally released on Vanguard Records in 1990, Simple Pleasures earned extensive critical praise both for Alison's compositions as well as her instrumental prowess and received a Grammy nomination for Best Bluegrass Album. In his liner notes for the reissue, Mike Marshall wrote: \"It is SO fun to revisit this first album of Alison's and to remember how she put her own stamp on the acoustic music scene back in the early 90s both as a composer and monster instrumentalist. It was refreshing and very much needed to have a woman showing us guys what was what and, in the process, paving the way for the next generation of virtuoso female bluegrass pickers.\" One of the most multi-faceted minds in roots music, Alison Brown is a GRAMMY-winning musician, GRAMMY-nominated producer, and co-founder of Compass Records Group. She is the recipient of the USA Artists Fellowship in Music and the Distinguished Achievement Award from the International Bluegrass Music Association. A pioneer among women in the music industry, Alison was the first female to win an Instrumentalist of the Year award from the International Bluegrass Music Association; in 2019, she became the first female 5-string banjoist to be inducted into the American Banjo Museum's Hall of Fame. Alison serves as Vice President of the Board of Governors of the Recording Academy, on the advisory board of the Salt Lick Incubator and the Earl Scruggs Center, and as co-chair of the Steve Martin Banjo Prize. Over the course of her career, she has continued to break down barriers for the 5-string banjo through both her solo discography and her live performances with the Alison Brown Quintet, as well as frequent collaborations with actor/comedian/banjoist Steve Martin, The Indigo Girls, and others. Alison's 2023 release, On Banjo, received critical acclaim for charting new territory for the 5-string banjo and a Best Album of the Year nod from AllMusic.\n\nQuick View\n\nOrville Peck\n\nStampede [Indie Exclusive Baby Pink 2 LP]\n\nVinyl: $44.99 Buy\n\nVideo\n\nCritically acclaimed, Orville Peck has long dreamed of making Stampede, a duets album with singers, songwriters, and fellow musicians hes long admired.

When we started Wild Rivers way back when, we had never played a real concert before. When we made our first record it was our first time stepping into a real studio. We barely even knew each other when we started this band. Since then we've played a thousand shows, recorded over 30 songs, and become a family.When we set out to record 'Never Better', we felt like we were at a new stage of the band. By that point, we'd put in the hours and all began to feel totally self assured in what we were about to do. We wanted to bring everything we've learned over the years and all that we've been through as a group to the project. We chose to trust our guts and move quickly and confidently in every decision, second guessing ourselves as little as possible. In having this mindset, we were able to completely let loose and go deeper into the process, finding new ways of recording live, swapping instruments, and turning these songs on their heads. We couldn't have made this record a few years ago.We approached this record with the mindset, 'this is who we are'. We aren't pretending to be something we're not, or trying to sound like anyone else. We wanted it to feel easy. We wanted the stories to be real. We wanted to show our true selves as best we could. We're proud of who we've become as people and as a team. We truly feel like we're having the most fun with music that we've ever had, and in the most exciting stage of our lives. We're never better.\n\nQuick View\n\nFred Again\n\nUsb [2 LP]\n\nVinyl: $39.99 Buy\n\nDouble vinyl LP pressing.\n\nQuick View\n\nFuture & Metro Boomin\n\nWe Don't Trust You\n\nVinyl: $38.98 Buy\n\nWE DONT TRUST YOU arrived as a celebration of the historic partnership of two culture-shifting legends at the peak of their powers, nearly breaking the internet in its wake.

The winds of change were blowing through Wayne Shorter's life and career in 1970. The saxophonist had just left Miles Davis' group and was soon to form his collective fusion band Weather Report. His music was evolving too as he began to delve into his own unique fusion explorations on his previous two Blue Note recordings Super Nova and Moto Grosso Feio. Recorded in August 1970, the mesmerizing Odyssey of Iska would be the last release of Shorter's early Blue Note period. The album was a tribute to his daughter Iska-who had been born the year before with severe brain damage-with four immersive Shorter compositions portraying a variety of moods: \"Wind,\" \"Storm,\" \"Calm,\" and \"Joy.\" The album's centerpiece is an extended version of Bobby Thomas' Brazilian influenced piece \"De Pois do Amor, o Vazio\" (After Love, Emptiness), foreshadowing Shorter's growing interest in Brazilian music which he would explore further in the years to come. Shorter's soprano and tenor saxophones are the lone horns heard on the album which featured Gene Bertoncini on guitar, David Friedman on vibraphone and marimba, Ron Carter and Cecil McBee on bass, and Alphonse Mouzon, Billy Hart, and Frank Cuomo contributing drums and percussion.\n\nQuick View\n\nDonald Byrd\n\nByrd Blows On Beacon Hill (Blue Note Tone Poet Series)\n\nVinyl: $38.99 Buy\n\nVinyl LP pressing.

This album is one of my more personal records to date. It's not a full biography, but my personal experiences are tied up in all of my music. A lot of the records are me. Some are from the POV of a character. and some are me. The album weaves things from my life as an artist, touching on things other artists go through. The narrative follows a battle rapper through various moments in his career, starting with how they honed their battle rap skills, following their career through different moments.\n\nMusically, the new album finds Lupe delighting in the simple pleasures of assembling assonant syllables into playful and poignant narratives. The 8-track album is smooth, yet cerebral, brimming with ideas, but always radiating Lupes pure love for the art of emceeing and committing himself as a servant of the rap game. The album was produced in full by longtime collaborator and friend, Soundtrakk (Superstar, Kick, Push, HipHop Saved My Life), their second time linking up on a full album after 2022s DRILL MUSIC IN ZION, and is also the first time Lupe, Trakk, and longtime manager Charles Chill Patton were in the studio together since Pattons release from prison in 2023. It felt great to be back in the studio again as a family, Lupe says. Its the first time theyd worked together in the studio since Lupes seminal album, The Cool in 2005.\n\nThe word samurai means to serve, Lupe says on the albums title. My relationship to that word has always meant that you need to be at the service of other people, either in the overall community, or in this instance, the rap community at large that Ive been a part of for years. You have some duty, some purpose to serve. The title alone is very important to me. Before rap even, martial arts was my whole life, and it still plays a huge role in my life. The album is me, but also inspired by a quote I heard from one of my favorite artists. The overall themes of the album speak to the constant fight and the battle one goes through being in the entertainment industry. Some of the things we need to defend.\n\nQuick View\n\nBeyoncé\n\nCOWBOY CARTER OFFICIAL VINYL [2 LP]\n\nVinyl: $62.98 Buy\n\nCOWBOY CARTER OFFICIAL VINYL has two 180 gram black vinyl LPs in printed inner sleeves with a 40 page photo booklet featuring never-before-seen images and a folded collectible 24âx 36â poster.\n\nQuick View\n\nGracie Abrams\n\nThe Secret of Us [Yellow Vinyl]\n\nVinyl: $32.99 Buy\n\nVideo\n\nGracie Abrams returns with her sophomore album, \"The Secret of Us\" released via Interscope Records.

In 1999, the same year that Jason Moran released his debut recording Soundtrack To Human Motion, the pianist and composer also joined New Directions, a band made up of young stars from the Blue Note roster. At the core of New Directions was the genesis of a rhythm section-with Moran, bassist Tarus Mateen, and drummer Nasheet Waits-that would go on to become one of the most enduringly creative and acclaimed piano trios in jazz. The Bandwagon made their first recording as a trio with Facing Left in 2000 and has been the foundation of the majority of Moran's artistic statements since. On his 2010 album Ten, Moran celebrated the 10th anniversary of The Bandwagon with an assured album that was a snapshot of a mature band with a decade of shared musical experience from which to draw. In addition to provocative originals the album presented singular interpretations of pieces by Thelonious Monk, Jaki Byard, Leonard Bernstein, and Conlon Nancarrow.

Their distinctive brand of hyperliterate folk-rock set them apart from the start, releasing nine full-length albums that are unbound by genre and highly ambitious. Now the beloved indie band is back with their first new album in six years, As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again - not only the longest Decemberists album to date (and their first intentional, proper double-LP) but also their most empathetic and accessible, its 13 songs like semaphores of mutual recognition for our fraught times and faint hope. The first dozen songs are punchy, pithy gems all, reflections on mortality and loneliness, longing and cynicism, expectation and unease. The band animates them brilliantly, pushing out and pulling in at the perfect moments. John Moen practically dances beneath the jangle of opener Burial Ground, breathing the life into this song about spiraling toward the end. From the irrepressible Oh No!\" and guileless tenderness and absolute surrender of All I Want Is You, to the romantic ghost story that shimmers behind pedal steel in spite of the specter in \"Long White Veil,\" these 12 songs alone would constitute a dazzling Decemberists album, rich with woe and love, anxiety and honesty. But a keening little choir and arid electric guitar invoke Joan in the Garden, the bands first full-on prog escapade since The Crane Wife. Though rooted in doubt, much like the album it ends, Joan in the Garden ultimately lands as a celebration of musics ability to convey valence and ambiguity, to frame an endlessly complicated story in instantly compelling terms.\n\nThis, songwriter Colin Meloy will tell you proudly, is the best Decemberists albums and perhaps the ultimate realization of 22 years of work. In many ways, As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again feels like an aptly titled renewal for The Decemberists. The first full-length release on YABB Records, the bands own label, after a run of nearly two decades with Capitol. As they were once, here are the Decemberists again, now an independent band empowered by singing stories that sound instantly familiar and convey some bit of hard-won wisdom.\n\nQuick View\n\nLindsey Stirling\n\nDuality [Indie Exclusive Limited Edition Butterfly Green LP]\n\nVinyl: $25.99 Buy\n\nVideo\n\nThe seventh studio album from acclaimed musician Lindsey Stirling celebrates the delicate, yet beautiful, nature of duality  the inner battle of fearlessness and self doubt we all experience.

Their new album Pulsar, is a focused but far-reaching record, the jubilant testament of a band with plenty to say and the skills to say it themselves. Across 10 tracks, L'ImpÃ©ratrice move freely and authoritatively among the sounds they love, bridging hip-hop, kosmische, and modern pop with their most unabashed embraces of French Touch and international house ever. Benguigui, meanwhile, boldly sings of self-empowerment by shirking beauty standards, ageism, and drab normalcy, with a little help from an exciting set of new friends.A longtime fan who had seen the band multiple times, Maggie Rogers flew to Paris to lead the svelte and graceful \"Any Way,\" approaching the song with an unabashed vim. They had a similar encounter with Erick the Architect, who was so enthusiastic about the sample- based and panoramic \"Sweet & Sublime\" that Benguigui scrapped one of her own verses to make more room for him. And Italian singer Fabiana Martone (Nu Genea) crafted the melody for \"Danza Marilu\" the moment she heard it's disco thump. Throughout these 10 songs, L'ImpÃ©ratrice espouses the rare willingness to be real about life and it's woes while also sounding like a perfect picture of joy. Pulsar opens like a window being slid open onto an unimagined world. During the title-track finale, where a casual confession of suffering climbs into a mighty climax rooted in redemption, the band intertwines dubstep, turntablism, and symphonic strings to offer a bracing conclusion: however we are is OK.\n\nQuick View\n\nEels\n\nEELS Time!

The whole purpose of my music is that it's not just about me - when I do live shows I get local LGBTQ+ acts to open for me. I want to create community, or lead people to other artists I collaborate with. I just want people to have a great, uplifting time with the record and the shows around it. It's a simple plan, perfectly executed.\n\nQuick View\n\nThe Avett Brothers\n\nThe Avett Brothers [Indie Exclusive Light Blue LP]\n\nVinyl: $36.99 UNAVAILABLE\n\nThe Avett Brothers return with their first album in five years. Produced by longtime collaborator, friend and early champion Rick Rubin, The Avett Brothers is as much untitled as it is self-titled, for as Thomas Keating said: Silence is Gods first language  everything else is a poor translation.\n\nFrom the albums all-vocal opening to the sharp, scrappy and scorching rock n roll blast of lead single Love Of A Girl, to the novel strains of folk, roots, synth and strings that have landed The Avett Brothers numerous Billboard Top 5 and chart-topping albums, three GRAMMY nominations, five Americana Music Awards, a documentary co-directed by Judd Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio, and so much more, this record is one that revealed itself naturally over time.\n\nRecorded in Malibus Shangri-La Studios, as well as Nashville, Mar Vista, and the bands hometown of Concord, NC, The Avett Brothers is a collection of songs seen through a lens of independently studied spirituality; questions and considerations in the interest of the divine unknowable. In an ongoing attempt to comprehend existence and our interpersonal connectedness, these songs seek the sacred in the commonplace: a cheap cup of coffee, the smallest movement of love, broken hearts and school bus lessons, a babys first and second steps, growing older and holding on to ones roots, losing someone and accepting fate, rediscovering hope and finding sanctity in tragedy...ultimately reveling in the fun and surrender of what we cannot understand.\n\nAs their first full length release on Ramseur Records/Thirty Tigers since 2007s Emotionalism, The Avett Brothers is both a cumulative opus and fresh start for the bands future as a multifaceted and singular force.\n\n2024 Copyright © Music Millennium\n\nWebsite Platform by Broadtime\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Service\n\nReturns\n\nAccessibility\n\nThis website uses cookies to personalize content and analyse traffic in order to offer you a better experience.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â\n\nback to top\n\nNo items in cart"
