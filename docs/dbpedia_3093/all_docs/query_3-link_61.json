        "text": "A rustic, unique and secluded property on the shores of Lake Superior located off of Point Abbaye Road north of L'Anse. This is an unplugged remote get away can be reserved to reset your hectic life. Sauna and outhouse in separate buildings. Bring your own drinking water but access to Lake water. No electricity. The driveway ends at grassy area near cabin. The main cabin at Point of View has two bedrooms, each with a single and double bed, and a futon (full size) in the great room. These have mattresses and there are some extra blankets but plan to bring your own. There is a well-stocked kitchen with propane stove and refrigerator. There is a separate building with a wood sauna and guest room with a futon for additional sleeping.\n\nPoint Abbaye Road may be rough at times and often have muddy patches after spring snowmelt. A cold weather visit would require careful planning as the Point Abbaye Road is not plowed as far as this property but could be fun for adventure seekers. The property is open to the public year-round but best in the shoulder and warm seasons. This area is surrounded by forested swamps, be prepared for insect visitors if the winds are low or from the land.\n\nIf visiting please be respectful of the property by taking what you bring with you including any dog waste. You can drive to the cabin but all trails for non-motorized recreation only. There is one privy available onsite for public use with possibly the best view from a U.P. outhouse.\n\nKLT does not allow campfires if open burn is not permitted. See DNR Burn Permits Map (state.mi.us) for current information on fire risk.\n\nThe Point of View property, acquired in 2017, links over 5 miles of protected state and county land along the Lake Superior shoreline on the Abbaye Peninsula. The land offers wild and unmanaged forest, as well as an off-grid rustic cabin and boathouse that date back decades, and a newer privy and sauna. A unique rock formation juts out in front of the cabin forming a long rock wall, and a natural harbor provides for safe and easy access for canoes and kayaks in calm weather. This remote, rustic setting fosters meaningful connections with the natural world and offers shelter from the weather that often pounds this peninsula. A large outcropping of some of the oldest exposed rocks in North America serves as the front yard of the cabin.\n\nExcept for the cabin clearing, the property is forested with old growth character including stands of large hemlock. This area provides important migratory stopover habitat. Migratory birds that follow the Great Lakes shoreline favor stopover sites on prominent shoreline features (like Point Abbaye) that are forested to the edge or have structural and species diversity within the forest such as is found on this parcel. The Point of View property is an important addition to the Abbaye Peninsula and Huron Bay Conservation Initiative."
