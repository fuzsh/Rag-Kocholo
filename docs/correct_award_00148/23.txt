Caribbean poet Derek Walcott, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1992, died at the age of 87 at his home in St. Lucia, the Associated Press confirmed with his family.

Walcott published several acclaimed poetry collections and plays exploring Caribbean identity, cultural experience and history with colonialism. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1992 for his "poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment."

Some of Walcott's works include Tiepolo's Hound, Omeros, The Prodigal and White Egrets, which won the T.S. Eliot Prize in 2011. In 2015, Walcott received the Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry Lifetime Recognition Award, a prestigious Canadian literary award.

Walcott was born in 1930 in Castries, St. Lucia, the son of a school teacher and civil servant. He attended St. Mary's College in St. Lucia and the University of the West Indies in Jamaica.

He published 25 Poems when he was 18 years old, but his breakthrough is widely considered to be the poetry collection In a Green Night, which was released in 1962.

Throughout his career, Walcott taught at universities around the world, including Boston University, Columbia, Rutgers and Yale.
