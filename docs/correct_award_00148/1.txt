rip -- poet Derek Walcott Pulitzer Prize Winner

Walcott is often considered a âpoliticalâ poet, and in certain respects he was. But he was more than that. He was, finally, writing about love â for place and people and the sacred. âThe fate of poetry,â he wrote, âis to fall in love with the world.â

Derek Walcott, Poet and Nobel Laureate of the Caribbean, Dies at 87

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/books/derek-walcott-dead-nobel-prize-literature.html

Derek Walcott, whose intricately metaphorical poetry captured the physical beauty of the Caribbean, the harsh legacy of colonialism and the complexities of living and writing in two cultural worlds, bringing him a Nobel Prize in Literature, died early Friday morning at his home near Gros Islet in St. Lucia. He was 87. His death was confirmed by his publisher, Farrar, Straus and Giroux. No cause was given, but he had been in poor health for some time, the publisher said. Mr. Walcott's expansive universe revolved around a tiny sun, the island of St. Lucia.
