Derek Walcott was a Saint Lucian poet and playwright who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992. He is considered one of the most important Caribbean literary voices of the post-colonial era.

His work often explores themes of history, identity, and the legacy of colonialism in the Caribbean. Walcott's poetry is characterized by its lyrical beauty, evocative imagery, and formal precision, drawing comparisons to T.S. Eliot and W.B. Yeats. He combines a deep understanding of Western literary tradition with a profound engagement with Caribbean folklore and oral storytelling.
