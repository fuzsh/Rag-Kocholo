        "text": "Some very fine news just landed in our inbox: Derek Walcott, the Saint Lucia–born poet who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992, will be giving the keynote lecture at a symposium at El Museo del Barrio on the evening of Oct. 11. His lecture is titled “A Part of the Continent, from John Donne” and will be followed by a theatrical reading of his 1970 play Dream on Monkey Mountain.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

If you have some time on your hands, this 1986 Paris Review conversation between him and Edward Hirsch is well worth a read. Mr. Walcott talks a bit about his influences as a painter:\n\nThe painter I really thought I could learn from was Cézanne—some sort of resemblance to oranges and greens and browns of the dry season in St. Lucia. I used to look across from the roof towards Vigie—the barracks were there and I’d see the pale orange roofs and the brickwork and the screen of trees and the cliff and the very flat blue and think a lot of Cézanne. Maybe because of the rigidity of the cubes and the verticals and so on. It’s as if he knew the St. Lucian landscape—you could see his painting happening there. There were other painters of course, like Giorgione, but I think it gave me a lot of strength to think of Cézanne when I was painting."
