        "text": "Description\n\nWhen Derek Walcott was awarded the Nobel Prize, he was cited for \"a poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment.\" The lively interviews in this collection reveal Walcott's generous and brilliant intelligence as well as his strong, forthright opinions. He discusses the craft of poetry, the status of contemporary poetry and drama, his founding of the Trinidad Theatre Workshop, and his views on a number of influential writers, including Eliot, Auden, Brodsky, Heaney, and Naipaul.\n\nBoldly speaking his mind, Walcott takes many controversial positions on a wide range of subjects, such as Caribbean and U.S. politics, literary instruction in American universities, the proper role of sound in modern poetry, and the \"ego\" apparent in contemporary American poetry, and problems of race. Whatever the subject, Walcott responds fully and candidly."
