        "text": "When Derek Walcott was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1992 the citation said he was honoured \"for a poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment.\"\n\nThis vision and commitment were forged in the extraordinary cultural melting pot that is the Caribbean. There is English, Dutch, Creole and African all represented within two generations of his lineage. He was brought up in a British colony as an English-speaking Methodist, but St Lucia was mostly a Creole-speaking Catholic island. In social terms he was from an intellectual elite, while economically he was harshly poor. Black and white have of course played a big part in Walcott's life, but it is the colours in between that have defined the man and his work. Or as he put it in his 1979 autobiographical poem The Schooner Flight:\n\nI'm just a red nigger who love the sea,\n\nI had a sound colonial education, I have Dutch, nigger and English in me,\n\nand either I'm nobody, or I'm a nation.\n\nThe writer Marina Warner first saw Walcott at a reading in a former 18th-century prison in Dublin. \"He read a section of his poem Omeros where a woman opens a box and the whole of the empire spills out in these rolling stanzas packed with colonial symbolism,\" she recalls. \"Derek was surrounded by portraits of Lord Lieutenants of Ireland in their uniforms and medals. To see him reading these lines there, in his wonderful, rumbling Paul Robeson style of delivery, was a marvellous moment. It really was history talking back.\"\n\nWarner points out that he is simultaneously a profound critic of how the Caribbean has been treated by empire but is also very aware of the cultural legacy and riches that connection brings. \"He operates within this interesting contradiction all the time. He has a white grandfather and has green eyes. He is the patchwork quilt of the Caribbean.\"\n\nThe novelist Caryl Phillips claims that Walcott \"has shown that there is a sense of what I would call 'big history' in the region, rather than seeing it as a set of scattered islands off the United States where small history happens. This is a place where much larger forces are at work.\"\n\nPoet David Dabydeen, who like Phillips was born in the region, notes that Walcott's approval for things like his \"sound colonial education\" can make him unpopular with \"people who believe in an easy flag-waving and drum-beating nationalism\". But while his work combines forms from English, Russian and Greek poetry, it also contains Caribbean rhythms and sensibility, explains Dabydeen. \"He shows that the seemingly diverse traditions of Creole and Mediterranean are not so diverse after all. The fact is that Europe is there in the form of the English, the Spanish, the French and the Dutch.\"\n\nWalcott's latest work, the 160-page poem Tiepolo's Hound, is another boldly ambitious explication of the synthesis between the Caribbean and the western world. It tells the story of the impressionist painter Camille Pissaro, a Sephardic Jew who was brought up on the Caribbean island of St Thomas, went to France in his mid-20s and helped to change the face of European art. The poem also tells the story of Walcott, another outsider and artist working against the prevailing fashions who left his Caribbean home to pursue his visions.\n\nAs a young man Walcott considered being a professional painter, and the poem is illustrated with his work. \"But the text does says how hard I find painting and how much of it is failure,\" he quickly explains. \"It's not saying here's Pissaro and here's me. But it does show the relationship between the writing and the painting.\"\n\nWalcott covers some interesting art historical ground and makes a good case that Pissaro's wintry depictions of Paris are infused with Caribbean colouring. But it is the key question of why Pissaro chose to leave the region that most preoccupies him. It is quintessential Walcott material.\n\n\"There was no reason why he should have stayed in St Thomas,\" he says. \"If it is possible to feel bored and restless with contemporary St Thomas, imagine how it felt 150 years ago. Of course there's the business of him being white and Jewish, and it may be an anachronistic question or the wrong question about the wrong time. But I am still interested in the idea of why he went. I wonder whether painting that landscape and the black faces was ever a real choice for him. Was it considered a proper subject or was that at the time completely out of the question.\"\n\nBruce King has written a major biography of Walcott that will be published by Oxford University Press in October. In Tiepolo's Hound, he sees Walcott again putting the West Indies at the centre of history rather than tangential to it. \"This is the real difference between him and Naipaul. Naipaul sees Trinidad as a backwater and Derek says, 'No, we are part of world culture. A lot of things have happened here.' Just because they don't have an economic base it will always be difficult to talk about West Indian independence, and perhaps it will always be a colony in an economic sense. But culturally it is amazing what has been produced there. And this is what he sees himself contributing to. To dismiss it all like Naipaul does is absurd.\"\n\nAccording to Caryl Phillips, Walcott has, almost single-handedly, created a poetic tradition in the Caribbean. That has been both a help and a hindrance to him. \"If you are working in the shadow of Yeats or Wordsworth you always have someone to measure yourself against. You are not on what Heaney calls 'a peasant's pilgrimage'. But Derek didn't have that comforting notion that there had been people before him. It makes what he has done even more remarkable.\"\n\nDabydeen says Walcott's impact on the status of Caribbean writing has been profound. \"When he won the Nobel Prize in 1992 we all won the Nobel Prize. The symbolism of this on the 500th anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the region was immense. There is enormous local pride. There is a fish cake named after him in St Lucia, Columbus Square is now Walcott Square, and he carries all this with a great deal of the humility.\"\n\nIn a sense Walcott was born into the cultural officer class of the region. His people were the teachers, preachers and local administrators. His father, Warwick Walcott, was a civil servant working for the attorney general. He was an opera fan, had a sizeable library, wrote poetry and painted. He was a significant figure in the local artistic scene and had set up a literary society and staged plays.\n\nHis mother, Alix, was a headmistress. Derek and his twin brother Roderick, a theatre director who died earlier this year, were born in the largest town in St Lucia, Castries, in 1930. They had one older sister. Their father died when the boys were aged one, leaving his wife to bring up the children during a depression. Alix Walcott was an extremely forceful woman and very well read. Walcott remembers her singing Methodist hymns around the house and reciting great chunks of poetry and prose. \"Things like Cardinal Wolsey's farewell speech. She knew a lot of Portia's speeches and had played her in a production put on by my father. She was a real ham and a performer, and I always hoped that one day she would recite something of mine like that.\"\n\nIn order to provide for the family she took in sewing work, but Walcott says he wasn't conscious of any deprivation. \"My mother hid the struggle from us children. She complained about her salary and she had a tough time. Although she became a headmistress she still had to do a lot of sewing. The more I think about her the more remarkable I realise she was. And she understood straight away when I said that I wanted to write.\" Walcott was also encouraged at his school, St Mary's College, by some of the younger teachers and the headmaster. \"They made me feel that this is what I should do. The headmaster asked to read one of my poems at some celebration or other when I was about 10. When I look back that is phenomenal encouragement.\" By the age of 14 his precocity had sparked an island row when a priest accused him of heresy after one of his poems, which said that God could be better found through nature than through preaching, was published in the local newspaper.\n\nWalcott's education was, apart from its location, identical to that of middle-class children in England at the time, and the travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor, who visited the school in the early 50s, noted that \"it had a completely English atmosphere\". Astonishingly this tiny island school has produced two Nobel Prize winners, Walcott and the 1979 economics laureate Sir Arthur Lewis. Coincidentally they were both born on January 23.\n\nWalcott just missed out on the island scholarship to Oxford because he was bad at mathematics and so went to the University of the West Indies in Jamaica, where he studied French, Latin and Spanish. \"I don't know what would have happened to me as a writer if I had gone to England and shaped my life out of England. Of course I will never know, but I think I prefer what did happen.\" He says had a terrific time at university but didn't do any work, preferring to spend his time in the drama group and writing for the newspaper. \"There was the excitement of a new Caribbean being created,\" he says. \"There were new writers and artists emerging. Obviously colonialism was there and racism and history and so on. We had our anger, but it was kind of great to be angry - it had its own vigour. It wasn't at all sour or vengeful.\"\n\nAfter university he taught in schools in St Lucia, Grenada and Jamaica, as well as contributing articles and reviews to papers in Trinidad and Jamaica. In 1953 he went to live in Trinidad, where he continued to write poetry and plays. He and his brother had always written small plays which they performed themselves in the house. His first publicly performed plays were put on in St. Lucia in 1950. Later that year he won a Rockefeller scholarship to study theatre in New York. Walcott ended that trip early after suffering from homesickness but has subsequently worked a great deal in American theatre. In 1998 he was the co-lyricist in Capeman, Paul Simon's $11m Broadway debacle. It was based on the life of Puerto Rican Salvador Agrón, who as a 16-year-old in the 1950s had murdered two white teenagers while wearing a red satin cape. The case had become a cause célèbre for radicals in the 60s and the musical attracted massive publicity. When it closed after just two months it was the most expensive failure in Broadway history. Even before its spectacular collapse Walcott had begun to dissociate himself from the show, complaining that his work was being butchered by the succession of directors brought in to salvage it. Ultimately he regarded the project as a waste of four years' work.\n\nWhen Walcott returned to Trinidad in 1959 he formed the Trinidad Theatre Workshop. It celebrated its 40th anniversary last year. \"We've had some terrific actors,\" he says. \"People sometimes dismiss it because it is not a professional theatre, but that's just because the economic context means it can't sustain professional theatre, it doesn't mean the performances are not first class.\"\n\nWhen Walcott's play, Ti-Jean, was performed in Central Park in New York in the early 1970s, two of the actors, Hamilton Parris and Albert Laveau, attracted rave reviews - better than those for the play itself. The theatre's reputation for excellence has since attracted overseas directors like the RSC's Terry Hands and Greg Doran, and the company has won awards when touring in America. But Walcott has still had to fight a long, bitter and largely unsuccessful battle with the Trinidad authorities to obtain state funding for what is a national theatre in all but name.\n\n\"The quality of literature that has come out of the Caribbean over the last 40 years has been phenomenal,\" he says. \"Who could have foreseen that a place like Trinidad, which is of the scale of some English counties, could have produced both Naipaul and CLR James? And there is equivalent potential there in the theatre. You would think that a society would say that art is as necessary as roads and sewage. But the attitude is that art is an amateur activity, which is not just short-sighted thinking, it is illiterate and ignorant thinking.\"\n\nCaryl Phillips sees why he is so angry. \"It's not as if vast amounts of money are needed, but even this wasn't forthcoming. It has grated on him as an individual. He made very early on a serious commitment to the Caribbean in terms not just of his aesthetic but also the physical and emotional trajectory of his life.\"\n\nThis emotional trajectory has not been straightforward, and his professional and domestic life have often been stormy. Until he won the Nobel Prize he had been consistently short of money. His health was put under pressure by heavy drinking and smoking. He is now diabetic and no longer does either. His first marriage was in 1954 to Fay Moston, a secretary from a wealthy Jamaican family. They had one son, now a painter living in St Lucia, the following year, but the marriage broke up in 1956. His second wife, Margaret Maillard, was an almoner in a hos pital in Port of Spain, Trinidad. She was also active in the Trinidad arts scene as a dancer and a painter, and the couple shocked local opinion by living together before getting married. They have two daughters; one is now at university and the other works for an advertising company. Walcott has three grandchildren.\n\nHis marriage to Margaret, shaky since the late 60s, broke up after he had an affair in the mid-70s with a young dancer in one of his plays, Norline Metivier. He married her in 1976, but that also ended in divorce. His partner since 1987 has been Sigrid Nama, a Danish-Flemish-American art dealer, whom he met when giving a reading in Pittsburgh that year.\n\nWalcott has included a fair amount of autobiographical content in his poems over the years but all this material was yet to come when he self-published his first collection, 25 Poems, in 1948. It was funded by a $200 gift from his mother and was printed to look as much like a Faber & Faber book as possible. This arrangement wasn't unusual in the Caribbean; VS Naipaul's father had paid for the publication of his first book of short stories.\n\nWalcott's first collection of poems published outside the Caribbean was In a Green Night in 1962. Tom Maschler had recently joined Jonathan Cape and was on the lookout for young poets. Alan Ross, editor of The London Magazine, had published some of Walcott's work and put his name forward. \"With fiction I am a totally confident judge,\" says Maschler. \"I don't know in the same way with poetry, but I did like the book enormously. But I must admit I didn't have any idea he would become such a significant figure. If we had published Seamus Heaney I think I would have been waiting for him to win the Nobel Prize. But while I did know that Derek was a very important poet, I didn't know then just how important he would be.\"\n\nWalcott, although a new name in England, was already at this stage a significant mature artist in the Caribbean, and as early as 1964 he was able to publish his Selected Poems. He went on to build his reputation with a series of acclaimed collections that extended his work from the early celebrations of Caribbean landscape. Both The Castaway (1965) and The Gulf (1969) deal with his personal anxieties in being pulled both by the European tradition and his native culture. Another Life, his 1973 book-length autobiographical poem, saw his breakthrough in terms of critical respect, and his reputation was further secured with The Star-Apple Kingdom in 1979, in which he probed the many strata of Caribbean society in terms of language, race and culture.\n\nBy this time Walcott, although maintaining strong links with Trinidad and St Lucia, was essentially living in America. After the false start of his first visit in the late 50s, he was by now increasingly an insider in the east coast literary establishment. He was invited to contribute to the influential liberal journal Partisan Review and also for the New York Review of Books. The poet Robert Lowell champi oned his work, and they became friends.\n\nWalcott was by now doing more readings in America and had begun to teach at prestigious American universities. First at Rutgers, then Yale, Columbia, Harvard, and since 1982 at Boston University, where he is a professor of English and teaches a postgraduate theatre course. Walcott's own poetry has long been seen as ideally suited to black and post-colonial literature courses, but he has always distanced himself from what he sees as a ghetto mentality. He has always written in English, although he often uses the rhythms of the French Creole he spoke alongside English as a boy. \"I hate all that nonsense about not touching the colonialists' lan guage. All that about it being corrupting and belonging to the master and making you Caliban. That thinking just denies you an outlet. You deny everything that is great from a language, whether it is Conrad or Shakespeare.\"\n\nIt saddens him that some African-American literature is seen as being different from American literature. \"I think that is baffling and wrong. If you think of American literature up to about 1920, Jews were not thought to be part of it. Now look at American literature: Roth, Mailer, Bellow. That is what American literature is. Some people say that these Jewish writers were white so it is a different issue, but it wasn't like that at the time. Jewish writers were really excluded from the concept of American literature.\"\n\nDabydeen sees this approach as part of his commitment to the highest standards. \"He really believes that writing is about craft. You must have syllabic intelligence, you must know rhythm and where a line ends. In other words you can't slap words down on a page and call it dub. That is black performance fuckery. It's just not good enough to throw in a bit of Creole and think you can get away with it.\"\n\nWalcott has been widely seen as dismissive of the political correctness on some American campuses. His friends say he can be flirtatious, enjoys double entendres and sexual jokes, and likes to test people out with outrageous statements. This style got him into trouble. In 1982 a student at Harvard complained that he propositioned her and that after she rebuffed him he reduced her grade. When the Harvard authorities changed the student's grade, both Joseph Brodsky and Susan Sontag wrote complaining that this was a slur on Walcott's integrity. In 1996 a former student at Boston University claimed that he refused to produce her play after she turned him down. The university stood by him and the case was settled out of court. Both incidents put huge pressure on Walcott, and for a time his career and future employment prospects were in jeopardy. It was believed that the incidents also counted against him last year when the new British poet laureate was named. Walcott had made no secret of the fact that he would have liked the job.\n\n\"I thought it would have expanded the idea of the laureateship in a nice way,\" he says. \"I'm still amazed and thrilled that the captain of the English cricket team is of Indian descent and when I see black footballers playing for England. Twenty or 30 years ago that would not have been possible, so I was flattered that I was being considered.\"\n\nThe man who got the job, Andrew Motion, is a great admirer of Walcott's work: \"In a literary culture often connected with academies it would be easy to see his work as ideally suited to certain courses. But he has the freedom of imagination to engage with other things too. Those easily spotted themes in fact take their place with an almost limitless number of other themes and interests and that is a sign of a real quality.\"\n\nWalcott's 1988 collection, The Arkansas Testament, had received mixed reviews, but in 1990 his refashioning of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey in a 20th-century Caribbean fishing setting, Omeros, was widely acclaimed. Hermione Lee was one of the judges who awarded the WHSmith book award to Walcott that year. \"I think Omeros is one of the great epic poems of the 20th century,\" she says. \"There is a wonderful hubris about the work which is true of the man. Even in a five-minute meeting you can see he is a person of enormous boldness and grandeur. He does a big number both as a writer and a person.\"\n\nLee has taught Omeros to her students at Oxford. She says that some of the more feminist students do find him quite macho and difficult. \"He very much writes about the male ego and produces a sort of autobiography of the male epic poet. It is a very physical, active and heroic idea of poetry. It is not Emily Dickinson.\"\n\nThe poem, however, has not met with universal approval. The poet and critic Craig Raine, in his literary magazine Areté, recently subjected it to forensic levels of close reading and found a series of anomalies and repetitions. A canoe lost on page 50 is sold on page 116. Eyes are described as slitted on seven occasions. Raine also sees Walcott as being too \"touched\" by other poets: Dylan Thomas, Hopkins, Auden, Yeats, Lowell, Heaney and Brodsky. \"The clichéd colonial paradigm of invasion and conquest has been fulfilled aesthetically,\" says Raine, before conceding that this is \"odd, given that Walcott's pronouncements on the colonial past and its role in the present are so eminently sensible.\"\n\nFor all that, the publication of Omeros is widely seen as the clinching factor in Walcott being awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1992. He says that even now he is still coming to terms with the \"width of the prize\". Apart from fish cakes and squares being named after him, his face also appears on stamps and phonecards in St Lucia. Friends say that his experiences in America and demands made on him after winning the prize have made him more cautious about people and more determined to continue to write and not let his achievements become set in stone.\n\n\"He is driven by a need to establish himself in terms of history,\" says King. \"Some writers in old age will turn to meditation or ping pong or something, but Derek just isn't like that. He is a writer and an intellectual. Derek read and wrote serious books and serious literature and that was his life. That's not to say he doesn't watch comedy shows or basketball on television. But he has never enjoyed going to cocktail parties or having dinner with strangers.\"\n\nDabydeen applauds the fact that Walcott has produced some of his strongest work since receiving the prize. \"When you get the Nobel Prize, usually for the rest of your career people are waiting for the work to be rubbish, but he has gone from strength to strength. He really does believe that writing is a sacred calling and he doesn't judge himself by contemporary standards. He really worries whether what he has written can measure up to Shakespeare.\"\n\nWalcott's time is currently spent travelling the world giving readings and commuting between his homes in St Lucia and New York. He is painting, writing a screenplay about a steel band and \"fiddling around\" with several plays, as well as constructing verse. He is obviously committed to his calling, but has had his doubts. Towards the end of Omeros, Walcott breaks off from the hurtling narrative to question his role as a poet:\n\nWhat I had read and rewritten till literature was guilty as History. When would the sails drop from from my eyes, when would I not hear the Trojan War in two fishermen cursing in Ma Kilman's shop? When would my head shake off its echoes like a horse shaking off a wreath of flies? When would it stop, the echo in the throat, insisting, 'Omeros'; when would I enter that light beyond metaphor?\n\nHis answer is the scale of achievement in the poem itself. But he has also put it rather more succinctly when he saluted another writer torn between cultures, his friend and fellow Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky. \"Poetry is still treason,\" wrote Walcott, \"because it is truth.\"\n\nLife at a glance: Derek Alton Walcott\n\nBorn: January 23 1930, Castries, St Lucia.\n\nEducation: St Mary's College, St Lucia; University of West Indies, Jamaica.\n\nMarried: 1954 Fay Moston, (one son), divorced. 1962 Margaret Maillard, (two daughters), divorced. 1977 Norline Metivier, divorced.\n\nCareer: Teacher at schools in St Lucia and Grenada; lecturer at Kingston College, Jamaica; Rutgers University; Yale University; Columbia University; Harvard University; Boston University.\n\nEssays: 1998 What the Twilight Says.\n\nPoetry: 1948 25 Poems; 1962 In a Green Night; 1964 Selected Poems; 1965 The Castaway; 1969 The Gulf; 1973 Another Life; 1976 Sea Grapes; 1979 The Star-Apple Kingdom; 1981 The Fortunate Traveller; 1984 Midsummer; 1986 Collected Poems; 1987 The Arkansas Testament; 1990 Omeros; 1997 The Bounty; 2000 Tiepolo's Hound.\n\nPlays: 1952 Harry Dernier; 1957 Ti-Jean; 1970 Dream on Monkey Mountain; 1978 The Joker of Seville; 1980 Remembrance; 1993 Odyssey.\n\nAwards: 1989 Queen's Gold Medal for poetry; 1992 Nobel Prize for literature."
