        "text": "Derek Walcott\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1992\n\nResidence at the time of the award: Saint Lucia\n\nPrize motivation: “for a poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment”\n\nLanguage: English\n\nPrize share: 1/1\n\nLife\n\nWest Indian poet and playwright Derek Walcott made his debut as an 18-year-old with In a Green Night. For many years he divided his time among Saint Lucia; Boston University, where he taught; and Trinidad, where he managed a theater. Walcott also worked as an artist and combined his poetry with painting in the volume Tiepolo’s Hound (2005).\n\nWork\n\nDerek Walcott’s works often deal with Caribbean history, while he simultaneous searches for vestiges of the colonial era. Western literary canon is revised and given a completely new form, as in the poetry collection Omeros (1990). In his writing Walcott explores the complexity of living and working in two cultures."
