        "text": "(1930–2017). A poet and playwright of the West Indies, Derek Walcott was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1992. He began his writing career as a teenager. By age 19 he had published 25 Poems. After his career as a playwright was established, by age 30, he taught creative writing at Boston University, Harvard, Yale, Rutgers, and other schools.\n\nDerek Alton Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born on January 23, 1930, on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. (Roderick also became a playwright.) Derek graduated from St. Mary’s College in St. Lucia before attending the University of the West Indies in Jamaica. While studying at the university, he wrote his first play, Henri Christophe: A Chronicle (1950), based on the life of the Haitian revolutionary.\n\nAfter graduating from the university in 1953, Walcott taught at schools on St. Lucia, Grenada, and Jamaica. Within a few years he made his home in Trinidad, near Port-of-Spain, while writing articles and critical essays for newspapers and journals. In the late 1950s he went to New York City to study directing under José Quintero and to view rehearsals at the Phoenix Theater company. In 1961 he founded the Trinidad Theater Workshop to produce his own plays.\n\nWalcott’s plays have been performed around the world. Many of them make use of themes from black folk culture in the Caribbean. The best known out of his approximately 30 plays are Dream on Monkey Mountain (produced 1967), a West Indian’s quest to claim his identity and his heritage; Ti-Jean and His Brothers (1958), based on a West Indian folktale about brothers who seek to overpower the Devil; and Pantomime (1978), an exploration of colonial relationships through the Robinson Crusoe story. Among his other plays are Henri Dernier (1951), a radio play; Drums and Colours (1958), a Jamaican historical epic; Malcochon (or Six in the Rain, 1959); In a Fine Castle (1972); Remembrance (1979); The Last Carnival (1986); and The Odyssey (1992)."
