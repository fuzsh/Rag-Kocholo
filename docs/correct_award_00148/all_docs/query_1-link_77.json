        "text": "“Black Literature is taught as sociology, as tolerance, not as a serious, rigorous art form.”\n\n– Toni Morrison\n\nAs Toni Morrison rightly said, Black Literature has not always been viewed purely from the lens of art. More often than not, the works of Black authors have been judged from a sociological perspective. Like almost everything in life, it took decades for Black authors to prove their talent and show the world that their works have great artistic and creative value. In fact, it was in 1986 that a Black author was first awarded a Nobel Prize, one of the most prestigious awards in the world.\n\nSince its inception in 1901, the Nobel Committee has been honoring individuals and institutions who have made outstanding contributions in the fields of physics, chemistry, physiology, medicine, peace, and literature in the year preceding the ceremony. In 1969, economics was added as another category. Nobel Prizes come from the trust fund established by Swedish chemist, inventor, and philanthropist, Alfred Bernhard Nobel. As per Nobel’s will, the prizes for physics and chemistry are awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the prizes for physiological or medical works are bestowed by the Nobel Assembly, the Swedish Academy awards prizes for literature, the Norwegian Nobel Committee decides on the winner for the peace prize, and the prize for economics is bestowed by the National Bank of Sweden.\n\nIt is no doubt that the Nobel Prize in Literature marks the pinnacle of an author’s success. To date, four talented Black authors have been honored by this prestigious award.\n\nLet us take a look at the achievements of the Black authors who beat all odds and became the recipients of the Nobel Prize.\n\nAuthor: Wole Soyinka\n\nCountry: Nigeria\n\nYear of Receiving the Nobel Prize: 1986\n\nWole Soyinka, born Akinwande Oluwole Babatunde Soyinka, is the first African to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Born on July 13, 1934, Soyinka, a descendant of the rulers of Isara, has made his mark not only in the literary sphere but also in the political scenario of Nigeria. He not only fought in the Nigerian struggle for independence from British colonial rule but also played an active role in the Nigerian Civil War. His political activities led him to exile and even imprisonment for a number of years. The renowned playwright, novelist, poet, essayist, and actor rightfully won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986. Wole Soyinka’s works are notable for their inclusion of the myths, stories, and rituals of the Yoruba culture. Some of his notable works are The Lion and the Jewel, Kongi’s Harvest, A Dance of the Forests, Death and the King’s Horseman, Season of Anomy, and The Interpreters.\n\nAuthor: Derek Walcott\n\nCountry: Saint Lucia\n\nYear of Receiving the Nobel Prize: 1992\n\nSir Derek Alton Walcott was born in Saint Lucia, West Indies, on January 23, 1930. He was the first Caribbean-African author to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992. Walcott also won a number of other prestigious literary awards like the Obie Award, the MacArthur Foundation Award, the Royal Society of Literature Award, the Queen’s Medal for Poetry, the OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature, the T.S. Eliot Prize and the Griffin Trust For Excellence in Poetry. The works of the talented poet and playwright are notable for portraying the complexity of living and working in two cultures. Walcott’s work truly epitomizes the multiculturalism and colonial influence that the Caribbean is known for. His most well-known work is his Homeric epic poem, Omeros, which was published in 1990. Walcott also penned a number of masterful plays like Dream on Monkey Mountain, Beef, No Chicken, and Henri Christophe: A Chronicle in Seven Scenes.\n\nAuthor: Toni Morrison\n\nCountry: United States of America\n\nYear of Receiving the Nobel Prize: 1993\n\nChloe Anthony Wofford Morrison was born Chloe Ardelia Wofford on February 18, 1931. The American novelist and editor, popularly known as Toni Morrison, became the first Black woman to win a Nobel Prize in 1993. Born in Lorain, Ohio, Morrison was a pioneer in many things. In addition to being the first Black woman to win a Nobel Prize, she was also the first Black female editor in fiction at Random House. After publishing her first novel, The Bluest Eye, in 1970, Morrison steadily built her reputation as an author. Her 1977 book, Song of Solomon, won her the National Book Critics Circle Award. In 1988, she won the Pulitzer Prize for Beloved. Beloved was also made into a film in 1998. Toni Morrison’s works are famous for depicting racism in the United States and the overall Black American experience.\n\nAuthor: Abdulrazak Gurnah\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nYear of Receiving the Nobel Prize: 2021\n\nAbdulrazak Gurnah is a British novelist who was born on December 20, 1948, in the Sultanate of Zanzibar, now a part of Tanzania. At eighteen, he left his motherland and took refuge in the United Kingdom when the Arab elite was overthrown during the Zanzibar Revolution. Gurnah’s works are known for depicting the effects of colonialism and the conditions of refugees. Some of his well-known works are Paradise, By the Sea, and Desertion. Abdulrazak Gurah rightfully won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2021.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor centuries Africans have undergone persecution. Many of them have been kidnapped from their homeland, transported across continents in inhumane conditions, and forced into slavery. They were compelled to either leave behind or hide their culture, tradition, and religion. It was not till the Civil War that Blacks started getting treated as equals. However, the struggle has been a long one. In fact, the struggle is still on. More often than not, Black people, despite being talented and hard-working, have to persevere twice as hard to be successful in their chosen fields. Black authors are no exception. This African Heritage Day, let us celebrate Black authors by taking a moment to commemorate the achievements of the Black Nobel Laureates in Literature.\n\nDo comment and let me know your thoughts about the immensely talented Black Nobel Laureates in Literature.\n\nAnnouncements\n\nCongratulations to our latest BREW Award Winners!\n\nClick here to view the full lists of winners.\n\nBe our VIP\n\nSign up for our newsletter, and be the first to know what’s new.
