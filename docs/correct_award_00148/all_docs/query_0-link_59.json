        "text": "Contact: Darnley Lebourne\n\nWednesday May 4, 2011  The Government of Saint Lucia takes pride in once again congratulating Saint Lucian Nobel Prize winner for Literature, Hon. Derek Walcott on his recent success in winning the OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature. Mr. Walcott is the inaugural winner of the prize, which was introduced for the first time this year as a major award for literary books by Caribbean Writers.\n\nMr. Walcotts success in securing this latest prize is evidence of his established brilliance as perhaps the greatest living writer today. The government and people of Saint Lucia celebrate with our Nobel Laureate this latest achievement. We continue to share and identify with the work of Mr. Walcott, which in many ways has been inspired by the rich social and cultural reality of Saint Lucia.\n\nWe note that the Bocas Literary Festival organizers have listed as part of their rationale for the prize, the following: to celebrate the Caribbeans literary achievements in a festive atmosphere, to foster interest in reading and writing, to help demystify books and improve literacy and to exploit and enhance our presence on the world stage.\n\nWe have no doubt that Hon. Walcotts capture of this award will help to advance these goals. Saint Lucia celebrates this latest tribute to the outstanding excellence of Derek Walcott."
