        "text": "Derek Walcott, who has died aged 87, was a Caribbean poet whose work embraced the British and classical traditions that other post-colonial writers spurned.\n\nHis poetry has a global importance – he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1992. Shortly after that, Columbus Square in his home town of Castries, St Lucia, was renamed Walcott Square, and his name is also commemorated by the Walcott acra, a salt fishcake served with a Creole sauce. It is fitting for a poet whose work would always be rooted in the St Lucia of his birth.\n\nWalcott would use the characters of his childhood, and recast them as heroes on a Homeric scale. His long narrative poem Another Life (1973) made a bold start in this kind of writing, and he would bring it to fruition in his mature masterpiece Omeros (1990).\n\nHe would write about islands, beaches, boats, castaways and ports. These became metaphors, sometimes for the solitary nature of writing, sometimes for the kind of peace for which his poetry strove (“the amen of calm waters”), or for the diverse nature of people.\n\nAt times he would long for his fishermen and cafe owners to measure up to Achilles and Hector, and in Omeros he referred to “all that Greek manure under the green bananas”.\n\nHe would do this with a technique that attracted much attention for the ingenuity of his rhyming. Some of these rhymes rely on a Caribbean accent, so that “bars” can rhyme with “claws”, or “soundless” with “sandals”. He would also find ways of working Creole into his work.\n\nOn the other hand, he would defend his quest for refinement in his use of English: “I hate all that nonsense about not touching the colonialists’ language. All that about it being corrupting and belonging to the master and making you Caliban.”\n\nIn the 1970s, performance poets from the Black Power movement protested about his work. Meanwhile the Oxford academic Craig Raine criticised him for being too in thrall to the influences of such poets as Auden, Lowell and Heaney.\n\nFor the most part, Walcott shrugged all this off with his distinctive self-confidence. He made a comparison with painting (another career he considered): “If you asked a young Caribbean painter, ‘Why are you painting like Turner? He was an Englishman’, he would tell you to f--- off. As writers, we’re not as belligerent as we should be.”\n\nWalcott could be belligerent when he wanted to be. He would speak angrily about American foreign policy; he branded Raleigh and Drake “ancestral murderers and poets”, and used a production of Seamus Heaney’s The Burial at Thebes (based on Antigone) to attack central American dictators. His later years were marked by a spat with his former friend V S Naipaul, which resulted in Walcott declaiming vituperative doggerel at literary festivals.\n\nNothing, however, divided his public as much as his personal conduct. By the time Walcott declared an interest in following Ted Hughes as Poet Laureate in 1998, the scandal was no longer about any perceived desire of his to belong to the establishment. Rather, it was an opportunity to revisit incidents from his professional career, when he was accused of using his authority to seduce and harass female students.\n\nIn one episode, during a brief spell at Harvard, a student alleged that he had given her a low mark for declining his advances. In 1996, when at Boston, he formed a friendship with an aspiring playwright, Nicole Kelby, which led to the similar charge that he would expect some gratitude if his efforts led to a production of her drama. In the first case, Harvard stood by him. The second was settled out of court.\n\nThis legacy blew up briefly during discussions of the laureateship, but commanded more attention when he and Ruth Padel were rival candidates to succeed Christopher Ricks as Professor of Poetry at Oxford. There was intense controversy over whose behaviour was more unedifying: Walcott’s blemished reputation on campus, or Padel’s gamesmanship in helping journalists publicise it. Walcott withdrew from the ballot, and Ruth Padel won the post, but she resigned after a few days.\n\nFor all this confrontation, and tangled relationships, Walcott’s work reaches for, and often attains a kind of peace. When interviewed on Desert Island Discs, he spoke of his love of rhyme, and how the need for a line to harmonise with another would work towards a kind of redemption.\n\nAs he grew older, he wrote that he stopped fearing “the sickle moon/whitening this beach again like a blank page”, and added: “All its indifference is a different rage.” His restlessness and anger became something he could live with companionably.\n\nDerek Alton Walcott was born at Castries, St Lucia, on January 23 1930, as was his twin brother, Roderick, who became a playwright and director. His father was a painter whose friends formed a circle devoted to the work of Shakespeare and Dickens; he died when Derek was one. His mother was a teacher, and a Methodist on an island that was predominantly Roman Catholic.\n\nDerek attended St Mary’s College in St Lucia; when he was 10, his poetry attracted the attention of his headmaster. He excelled in English and classical literature and history, and just missed winning the island’s scholarship to Oxford because of his poor mathematics. His first collection, Twenty-Five Poems, appeared in 1948; it was privately published, and cost $200 to produce.\n\nHe went to Jamaica to attend the University of the West Indies. He later confessed that he studied little, but spent much time writing, especially as a theatre reviewer for student newspapers. He married, and had a son. The marriage did not last long, and he moved to Trinidad.\n\nHere he found the cultural climate exciting, and he would defend it against the disparaging remarks of V S Naipaul. Most of his writing at this stage was for the theatre, and he founded the Trinidad Theatre Workshop in 1958. He saw the stage as a natural home for verse writing (not even Tennessee Williams’s work was poetic enough for him).\n\nAlthough some regard his dramatic writing as even more significant than his poetry, it has failed to make much impact beyond the Caribbean. Many of his plays were reviewed unfavourably, and one, Capeman, a musical whose book he wrote for Paul Simon, was one of Broadway’s most expensive flops.\n\nAlan Ross, the poet, cricket-lover and editor of the London Magazine, visited Trinidad in 1961, where he met Walcott, and this led to the publication of In a Green Night by Jonathan Cape the following year. The collection established Walcott’s voice at a time when few had encountered any West Indian writing.\n\nAmong the volume’s admirers was Robert Lowell. The two became friends, although Lowell would later insult Walcott in what the latter would realise was a sign of Lowell’s mental illness.\n\nHis recognition led to teaching posts at Rutgers and Yale Universities, and in 1981, he became a visiting professor at Columbia. His most permanent position was at Boston University, where students would risk facing his acerbic quips.\n\nBy now his poetry was reliably confessional, and increasing in its narrative scope; he was finding ways of developing character and drama in poetry rather than in plays. Omeros was the fullest realisation of this process: in it, the narrator is a poet who is a rival for the love of Helen.\n\nThe poem culminates in a dialogue with Homer himself – at first a bust, and then the poet’s guide. It was the volume that preceded the Nobel Prize of 1992.\n\nIn 2000, Tiepolo’s Hound appeared. The narrative concerns the Impressionist painter Camille Pissaro, whose Jewish and West Indian origins enabled Walcott not only to reflect on his own feelings as an exile, but also to include some of his own paintings.\n\n(Walcott’s writing about painting is notable because, rather than using an image as a starting point for some description, it talks knowingly and revealingly about technique.)\n\nAnother late book, The Prodigal, tackles this theme more directly, with its reminiscences of the poet’s own travels.\n\nHere Walcott contrasted Europe’s struggles with its history – one almost impossible to escape – with the forgetfulness of Caribbean islands. It was a lifelong preoccupation, and one that was bound up with his own career.\n\nHis final volume of new poems, White Egrets, which was much praised and won the T S Eliot prize in 2010, returned to the theme of the “sea so / deep it has lost its stuttering memory of our hates” and included a glimpse of self-reproach: “I know what I’ve done, I cannot look beyond. / I treated all of them badly, my three wives.”\n\nIn 1969 Trinidad and Tobago awarded Walcott the Order of the Hummingbird, and in 2016 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Lucia.\n\nHe married first, Fay Moston, with whom he had a son; secondly Margaret Maillard, with whom he had two daughters; and thirdly Norline Metivier. All three marriages were dissolved. He survived by his children and his companion of many years, Sigrid Nama.\n\nDerek Walcott, born January 23 1930, died March 17 2017"
