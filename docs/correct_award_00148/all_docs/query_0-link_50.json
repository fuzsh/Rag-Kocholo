        "text": "Sir Derek Walcott was born and raised in St. Lucia as an enterprising and talented young man. He lived a life with a prolific love for the spoken and written word. He became St. Lucia’s second Nobel Prize winner (the first being Sir Arthur Lewis for Economics). Yes, this tiny island, dubbed the “Helen of the West” has spawned two Nobel Laureates.\n\nSir Walcott was raised as a Methodist on a Catholic Island; where the British ruled but the citizens spoke French-Creole; a mulatto negro.\n\nDerek Walcott studied at the University College of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica. After graduation, he moved to Trinidad in 1953, where he became a critic, teacher, journalist and founded the Trinidad Theatre Workshop.\n\nIt was after the publication of his epic poem, Omeros (modern Greek for Homer), critically praised as Walcott's major achievement, that he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nThree days after winning the presidential election, Barack Obama was spotted in Chicago carrying a book of poems by Derek Walcott. Sir Walcott later wrote a poem for President Barack Obama. When he was asked what he thought when he saw the picture of Barack Obama carrying his poetry book, Derek Walcott said that it had nothing to do with him so much as the fact that we have a president who reads poetry “there’s hope because poetry tries to tell the truth”.\n\nSir Derek Alton Walcott died Friday morning at his home in St. Lucia. One of our brightest sons who in turn inflamed the hearts and minds of youth world-wide. May he rest in peace."
