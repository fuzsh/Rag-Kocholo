        "text": "In December, Nobel Laureate Derek Walcott presented a $40,000 cheque to The UWI St Augustine Campus Principal, Professor Clement Sankat to go towards the establishment of a scholarship for students enrolled in the Theatre Arts programme at the university.\n\nThis was possible through the proceeds from the highly successful production of Walcottâs play 'O Starry Starry Night' which was staged in November 2013 at the Central Bank Auditorium in Trinidad. Each year for the next five years, a Theatre Arts student at the Department of Creative and Festival Arts will be awarded a scholarship to assist with studies tenable at The UWI.\n\nA similar scholarship has been established at the University of Essex, England, where the play, which is written by Walcott, and features Wendell Manwarren, Brian Green and Martina Laird, premiered in May 2013.\n\nIn November, two members of the international cast, David Tarkenter assisted by Michael Prokopiou also held an Actorâs Workshop for 20 UWI and University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTT) students at the St Augustine Campus."
