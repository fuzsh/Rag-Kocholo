        "text": "Eighty-one-year-old Derek Walcott beat out nine other poets, including Seamus Heaney, to win the T.S. Eliot Prize for Poetry for his 14th collection of poems, White Egrets. Walcott, who was awarded the 1992 Nobel Prize in Literature, published his first poem at 14.\n\nWalcott was born in 1930 in the town of Castries on the volcanic island of Saint Lucia. His experiences from living in the ex-British colony continues to influence his workâ€”he infuses his poetry with the flavors of the African, Asian, and European cultures that are prevalent in the Caribbean lifestyle. His epic poem Omeros uses the spirit of Dante and the characters of Homer's The Iliad and The Odyssey to tell a love story set on Saint Lucia.\n\nWalcott divides his time between Trinidad and Boston, where he teaches literature and creative writing.\n\nFrom White Egrets:\n\n\"The Sweet Life Cafe\"\n\nIf I fall into a grizzled stillness\n\nsometimes, over the red-chequered tablecloth\n\noutdoors of the Sweet Life Cafe, when the noise\n\nof Sunday traffic in the Village is soft as a moth\n\nworking in storage, it is because of age\n\nwhich I rarely admit to, or, honestly, even think of.\n\nI have kept the same furies, though my domestic rage\n\nis illogical, diabetic, with no lessening of love\n\nthough my hand trembles wildly, but not over this page.\n\nMy lust is in great health, but, if it happens\n\nthat all my towers shrivel to dribbling sand,\n\njoy will still bend the cane-reeds with my pen's\n\nelation on the road to Vieuxfort with fever-grass\n\nwhite in the sun, and as for the sea breaking\n\nin the gap at Praslin, they add up to the grace\n\nI have known and which death will be taking\n\nfrom my hand on this chequered tablecloth in this good place."
