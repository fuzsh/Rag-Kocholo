        "text": "BOMB Magazine, Issue 40, 1992\n\nDerek Walcott Interview by Caryl Phillips\n\nhttp://bombmagazine.org/article/1565/derek-walcott\n\nIn this interview conducted by Caryl Phillips, Walcott is being praised as the most important writer that the English speaking Caribbean has produced. The interview is set in Walcott’s Boston apartment. The interview speaks on the following:\n\n-Walcott’s first impression of America\n\nWalcott:” my first visit must have been before ’58. Errol Hill, Noel Vaz and I came through New York to talk about producing a play for The Federation. I didn’t go out, I was terrified of New York. Someone had a friend (probably Noel Vaz) who had a penthouse apartment. I stayed in the apartment for the length of the trip—five days—and wrote, very fast, a play called Ti-Jean. New York was staggering, I felt very lost, it seemed too huge.”\n\n-Walcott’s Decision to not leave the Caribbean for America or Britain like most writers\n\nWalcott:” I got very afraid. I thought, “Wait a minute, this street is not going to end. I’m going to turn around and go back.” That was how extensive my fear was. When I was younger, I was supposed to get a Colonial Development Welfare scholarship to go to Oxford, but I was very bad at mathematics, so I went to the University of the West Indies. It isn’t that I melodramatically chose to stay in the Caribbean, but I’m glad I didn’t go to England at that age. I would have been a very different kind of writer if I had gone to England.”\n\nThe Fame of Derek Walcott\n\nThe Fame of Derek Walcott, a review of Derek Walcott by David Mason\n\nIn this review on Derek Walcott, David Mason reviews his work, some noteworthy quotes are below:\n\n“Walcott’s poetry is linguistically rich—Helen Vendler called it “macaronic”—dramatically and intellectually diverse, and written with one eye on immortality at all times. The very life of the artist and poet is one of his major subjects—his own life, in fact, the life of someone famous and flawed.”\n\n“Set aside Walcott’s flaws—he can be verbose and repetitive and much too concerned with his own stature—and you have a generous, original vision, carnivalesque in its colorings of experience that matters. Indeed, Walcott’s big, dramatic voice and overt musicality are sometimes now held against him. There exist poets and critics for whom the art is all concept, a bloodless disembodiment only a critic could love. But Walcott writes for performance. ”\n\n“With his mixed African and European blood, his schooling in “the mighty line of Marlowe” and the pidgin of the streets, his painter’s eye for color and detail, his social conscience and theatricality, Walcott has been able to bring a fresh Renaissance complexity to Caribbean literature. ”\n\n“Walcott’s facility proves that nobody owns poetry. It can come from anywhere, including tiny islands bereft of substantial museums or monuments.”\n\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2719/the-art-of-poetry-no-37-derek-walcott\n\nDerek Walcott interview with Edward Hirsch for The Paris Review\n\nThis Interview of Walcott took place mid-June 1865 on Walcott’s home island of St. Lucia. Hirsch and Walcott stayed in adjacent bungalows, a few miles from the harbor city of Castries where Walcott was born and raised. In this week Hirsch was able to study Walcott and his everyday life. Noteworthy quotes from the interview are below:\n\n“One is always aware of the sea in St. Lucia—an inescapable natural presence that has deeply affected Walcott’s sense of being an islander, a New World poet.”\n\n“I remember coming across drawings that my father had done, poems that he had written, watercolors that were hanging in our living room—his original watercolors—and a terrific series of books: a lot of Dickens, Scott, quite a lot of poetry. There was also an old Victrola with a lot of classical records. And so my family always had this interest in the arts.”\n\n“I imagine that all artists and all writers in that moment before they begin their working day or working night have that area between beginning and preparation, and however brief it is, there is something about it votive and humble and in a sense ritualistic.”\n\n“Any serious attempt to try to do something worthwhile is ritualistic. I haven’t noticed what my own devices are. But I do know that if one thinks a poem is coming on—in spite of the noise of the typewriter, or the traffic outside the window, or whatever—you do make a retreat, a withdrawal into some kind of silence that cuts out everything around you. What you’re taking on is really not a renewal of your identity but actually a renewal of your anonymity, so that what’s in front of you becomes more important than what you are.”\n\n“I am primarily, absolutely a Caribbean writer. The English language is nobody’s special property. It is the property of the imagination; it is the property of the language itself. I have never felt inhibited in trying to write as well as the greatest English poets. Now that has led to a lot of provincial criticism—the Caribbean critic may say, You are trying to be English, and the English critic may say, Welcome to the club. These are two provincial statements at either end of the spectrum. It’s not a matter of trying to be English. I am obviously a Caribbean poet. I yearn for the company of better Caribbean poets, quite frankly. I feel a little lonely. I don’t see what I thought might have happened—a stronger energy, a stronger discipline, and a stronger drive in Caribbean poetry. That may be because the Caribbean is more musical: every culture has its particular emphasis and obviously the Caribbean’s poetry, talent, and genius is in its music. But then again the modern Caribbean is a very young thing. I consider myself at the beginning, rather than at the end, of a tradition.”"
