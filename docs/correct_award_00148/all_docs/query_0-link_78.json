        "text": "Since Nobel laureate and Caribbean poet and playwright Derek Walcott died Friday, remembrances have flooded in for the complicated but mighty writer, who captured the lush beauty of the Caribbean and the brutality of its colonial history.\n\nWe’ve collected several of these tributes, from a Caribbean street photographer, poets and other writers. Many pointed to the importance of one Walcott poem, “The Sea is History,” which argues that the history of the Caribbean cannot be stolen, because it is in the sea. The landscape was often at the center of Walcott’s work.\n\nRead those remembrances — along with “The Sea is History”– below. These comments have been edited lightly for length and clarity.\n\nFrom Ruddy Roye, a Jamaican street photographer whose work often focuses on the lives of the forgotten — the “raw and gritty lives,” he says — especially those of home:\n\nI believe when Caribbean people talk about Walcott, we talk about him under the stars after a night at the club. We sit on our cars or against the nightclub walls reminiscing about how we felt in literature class after reading one of his poems.\n\nWe would talk about being imbued with an identity solely scraped up out of the ashes of mediocre lives. In his poetry, his grandiose sentences, Walcott was able to unlock feelings of shame that we felt about being descendants of slaves. His writings were able to inspire the best in many, especially his fellow artists who reached for the spaces to sculpt our own personalities. Caribbean people enjoy feeling like they are from the Caribbean. And Walcott’s poetry made us feel like we belonged — that we were not shaped by the hands of our colonizers but architects of our own stories.\n\nMy favorite poem by him is “A Far Cry From Africa.” The culture that Derek Walcott helped to foster in the Caribbean (one of pride, rooted in the voices of our ancestors) is something that continues to inform my photography. I look at how black images have been defined in the past and hope that my work continues to redefine how we, the “other” here and around the globe, see black folks.\n\nFrom Patrick Sylvain, a Haitian-American poet, essayist and instructor of Haitian Language and Culture at Brown University, who also writes about landscape, as in this poem on Port-Au Prince:\n\nWhen I met Derek Walcott in the fall of 1989, I had no idea that I was in the presence of a Herculean poet. I was young and relatively unfamiliar with the Caribbean-Anglophone poets. I was with a member of the Dark Room Collective when we went to pick Walcott up from his Boston apartment, and I remember as soon as I entered I was in awe of his books and paintings. The vibrant colors, and the vivid details; such beauty, I thought. I wanted to ask him innumerable questions about St.Lucia, Trinidad, and his paintings, but I was timid, and his piercing gaze reminded me of my grandfather. I remained silent until he said to me: “Ou ka pale patois (Can you speak patois)?” His question puzzled me because I spoke Haitian Creole and not patois. I thought about it for a quick second and answered in the affirmative. He smiled at me and handed me one of his books, “mwen sav ou pa posede liv sa a (I know you do not have this book)!” The autographed book he gave me was “The Arkansas Testament,” the first book of his that I read and fell in love with. I’m thinking of the poem “Saint Lucia’s First Communion” in which the condition of children on the island exposes the ongoing dilemma of being a former colonial subject shackled by rituals and poverty.\n\nThat Sunday, after Derek Walcott read his poems to us, I began to realize his grandeur as a poet. I purchased “Midsummer” from him. I was utterly excited by the prospect of entering the Caribbean landscape through the sensibility of a methodical and lyrical poet.\n\nAnd after our first encounter, we frequently ran into each other at restaurants, his readings, the theater, with friends. We often discussed politics and literature. Despite the controversies that often surrounded him, I knew him as a beautiful, kind, reservedly funny soul, and also as someone who cared deeply about the Caribbean. Just as Robert Pinsky, Yusef Komunyakaa, Seamus Heaney and Martín Espada have been influential in my work, Derek Walcott has encouraged me to embrace my hybridized, trans-national Caribbean self and to understand that aesthetic has no geographical boundary. And through Derek Walcott’s poetry, I am forever reminded that “The Sea Is History.”\n\nFrom Ishion Hutchinson, a Jamaican poet and essayist, who also examines the Caribbean’s colonial history:\n\nDerek’s works proves and sustains what Hemingway — an author he revered — calls “grace under pressure,” which I take to mean a duty to poetry, a faith in its craft without compromise in spite of failure or success. I am in awe of that devotion, an awe I guard jealously because I am from his world, the Caribbean — though there are marked differences in our experience of it — which he celebrates and holds accountable. I try to avoid telling anecdotes of my encounters with him because they all mean something deeply personal to me. Every single, average moment was magical and I feel talking about it reduces what I cherish and cannot voice about his presence.\n\nBut this one I will share, about visiting him one autumn 10 years ago at Boston University, where he was teaching a playwriting class. After the session, he took the students to a Chinese restaurant, and during the walk there he and I sort of tagged along in the back. Even then I was thinking of the strangeness of walking with him, us in winter coats, leaves swirling about; the scene was like from a film. Not a lot was said, and most of it repeated questions. “You really like George Barker?” he asked me a few times, and my answer was the same yes with different words. But when I told him the Jamaican filmmaker Perry Henzell had died, he stopped in the leaves on the pavement and looked at me for a very long time. I wish now I could remember precisely what he said after the long silent stare, but it amounted to “he was a good man and a good artist.” We then walked on to the restaurant.\n\nFrom Kwame Dawes, a poet, editor and essayist who was born in Ghana, but spent most of his childhood in Jamaica. Reggae music in particular has influenced his work:\n\nI think I came across Walcott’s work for the first time in the 1970s, while I was in high school in Jamaica. By the time I got to university, Walcott and Kamau Brathwaite were the two major Caribbean poets. There was a tremendous amount of intellectual discussion, like there is with Michael Jackson and Prince, asking: Who is greatest? These were the lines of ideological discourse, which was a lot of nonsense because they were coming from similar grounds. I felt my experience with reading Walcott was that I struggled to understand everything he was writing, but I went back to it because of its sinuous metaphor and the intensity of language. Brathwaite was more immediately accessible, while Walcott had this ambition in writing the landscape of the Caribbean.\n\nI met Walcott probably in the 1990s, and I’ve met him and interviewed him on stage on several occasions. He’s known for being a bit of a curmudgeon in talking about work, but my experience is that I found him generous and thoughtful. In my work I’m often both quarreling with him and being guided by him, and I think he appreciated that — the conflicted sense of that.\n\nI think the poem “Sea of History” is a stunning poem and it’s so iconic. He introduces the idea of the Caribbean and creates this incredible conversation around the Caribbean person being told they have no history, or that they are deprived of a sense of history. But he says our history is in the sea. That’s where our cathedrals, our tombs are. Its Walcott facing tradition, and ruins and landscape, and saying: I still have a place in that landscape. It’s saying art that comes out of the Caribbean, comes out of the landscape. He says that we can write all we want but it’s irrelevant, because the landscape is the poem. It’s a clear political statement being made. And in the poem we see his wonderful rhetorical skills and exploration of place and identity.\n\nBelow, read “The Sea is History,” and poems Dawes and Roye wrote after Walcott’s death:\n\nTHE SEA IS HISTORY\n\nBy Derek Walcott\n\nWhere are your monuments, your battles, martyrs?\n\nWhere is your tribal memory? Sirs,\n\nin that grey vault. The sea. The sea\n\nhas locked them up. The sea is History.\n\nFirst, there was the heaving oil,\n\nheavy as chaos;\n\nthen, like a light at the end of a tunnel,\n\nthe lantern of a caravel,\n\nand that was Genesis.\n\nThen there were the packed cries,\n\nthe shit, the moaning:\n\nExodus.\n\nBone soldered by coral to bone,\n\nmosaics\n\nmantled by the benediction of the shark’s shadow,\n\nthat was the Ark of the Covenant.\n\nThen came from the plucked wires\n\nof sunlight on the sea floor\n\nthe plangent harps of the Babylonian bondage,\n\nas the white cowries clustered like manacles\n\non the drowned women,\n\nand those were the ivory bracelets\n\nof the Song of Solomon,\n\nbut the ocean kept turning blank pages\n\nlooking for History.\n\nThen came the men with eyes heavy as anchors\n\nwho sank without tombs,\n\nbrigands who barbecued cattle,\n\nleaving their charred ribs like palm leaves on the shore,\n\nthen the foaming, rabid maw\n\nof the tidal wave swallowing Port Royal,\n\nand that was Jonah,\n\nbut where is your Renaissance?\n\nSir, it is locked in them sea-sands\n\nout there past the reef’s moiling shelf,\n\nwhere the men-o’-war floated down;\n\nstrop on these goggles, I’ll guide you there myself.\n\nIt’s all subtle and submarine,\n\nthrough colonnades of coral,\n\npast the gothic windows of sea-fans\n\nto where the crusty grouper, onyx-eyed,\n\nblinks, weighted by its jewels, like a bald queen;\n\nand these groined caves with barnacles\n\npitted like stone\n\nare our cathedrals,\n\nand the furnace before the hurricanes:\n\nGomorrah. Bones ground by windmills\n\ninto marl and cornmeal,\n\nand that was Lamentations—\n\nthat was just Lamentations,\n\nit was not History;\n\nthen came, like scum on the river’s drying lip,\n\nthe brown reeds of villages\n\nmantling and congealing into towns,\n\nand at evening, the midges’ choirs,\n\nand above them, the spires\n\nlancing the side of God\n\nas His son set, and that was the New Testament.\n\nThen came the white sisters clapping\n\nto the waves’ progress,\n\nand that was Emancipation—\n\njubilation, O jubilation—\n\nvanishing swiftly\n\nas the sea’s lace dries in the sun,\n\nbut that was not History,\n\nthat was only faith,\n\nand then each rock broke into its own nation;\n\nthen came the synod of flies,\n\nthen came the secretarial heron,\n\nthen came the bullfrog bellowing for a vote,\n\nfireflies with bright ideas\n\nand bats like jetting ambassadors\n\nand the mantis, like khaki police,\n\nand the furred caterpillars of judges\n\nexamining each case closely,\n\nand then in the dark ears of ferns\n\nand in the salt chuckle of rocks\n\nwith their sea pools, there was the sound\n\nlike a rumour without any echo\n\nof History, really beginning.\n\n“The Sea Is History” from THE POETRY OF DEREK WALCOTT 1948-2013 by Derek Walcott, selected by Glyn Maxwell. Copyright © 2014 by Derek Walcott.\n\nUsed by permission of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, and Faber & Faber.\n\nFOR DEREK WALCOTT\n\n1930-2017\n\n“…For no matter how many promises God has made, they are “Yes” in Christ. And so through him the “Amen” is spoken by us to the glory of God.” Paul (2Cor.1:20)\n\nBy Kwame Dawes\n\nIn the black box, the lights isolate emotion\n\nwith theatrical efficiency—every gesture is art,\n\nas if in the clean, rehearsed moments, the word\n\nas the beginning of all things, and glorious yes\n\nof possibility, must be followed by the congregants\n\nsaying Amen—this is the holy theatre, a world\n\nI have come to think of as a home place, a shelter,\n\nthe womb of my art. So there in that black box\n\ndeep inside a winter storm in Providence, they\n\ntell me the old man has slipped into his first sleep,\n\nand his editor calls each day to listen to the soft\n\nebb and flow of the sea in his breathing. No one\n\nwants to say “all is silence now”, but we do know\n\nthat after the poem is over, what remains is a soft\n\npulse of the sea where we the Makaks of history\n\nfind our cathedrals, our history, our glorious tomb.\n\nI did not expect the thickening pain in my throat,\n\nas if I could fall down and weep—I did not expect\n\nthe moment to be like this, but it was and here\n\nis the beginning of our lamentation. For weeks\n\nI have carried in my head the calculation of greatness—\n\nhow ambitious was the madman Lowell, how\n\nfull of the privilege of his New England elitism,\n\nhow it is that every time I think of the Boston police\n\ncoming to secure him and carry him to another dark\n\nasylum, I can only think that I envy him the dignity\n\nthey afforded him; and I think that the St. Lucian\n\nwould have known that five white Boston cops\n\nwould not sit at his breakfast table while he shivered\n\nand ranted and read for them “The Sea is History”,\n\nbefore deporting him to the asylum of fire and healing.\n\nThis is the way history arrests ambition. We migrants stay\n\nsane so that we can live to go mad in our secret chambers.\n\nBut the old man has slipped into his first sleep and at last\n\nall his promises of last poems, last words, last\n\ntestaments, seem fulfilled. This is not yet an elegy, merely\n\nan effort to clear the glue in my throat, and a way\n\nof saying that his art comes to me burnished with\n\nso many grand yeses; and on this morning of grey\n\nchill, I have learned to pray for language, just enough\n\nto offer a word of company for the old man. The word\n\nis waves—not original, surely, but I offer it—the sea,\n\nthe soft waves reaching the coast, the pulling back,\n\nthe soft snore of a man waiting to leave the shore at last.\n\nKwame Dawes\n\nLincoln, Nebraska\n\nMarch 16th, 2017\n\nUNTITLED\n\nBy Ruddy Roye"
