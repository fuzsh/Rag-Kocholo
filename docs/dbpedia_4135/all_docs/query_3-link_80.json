        "text": "NB: endnote links inside doc are broken and pointing to a google doc atm, will try to fix… endnotes are at the bottom.\n\nNB2 [added Dec 2022]: Part 2 [click to jump to section] of these notes are the research notes underlying the Lovelace labs vision document, which outlined a set of organisational features common to the LMB/PARC/Bell Labs, and suggested a broad ‘new’ model of research lab learning from that.\n\nPrior to entering 10 Downing Street in April 2020 I spent 7 months in my parents rural house re-reading my notes and studying other books from the past 6 years of researching what we now call applied metascience. I made several ‘working notes’ documents that I thought would be useful to myself and others when I entered government (which was delayed due to the Brexit chaos).\n\nThe notes are largely my own words but it was based on work with my brother, and also discussions and input with a range of people including Alexey Guzey (who spent quite a lot of time improving and tidying the notes and suggesting new things to include). The notes sit somewhere between a reference list and an essay, which we intended to mine to turn into separate papers. Due to COVID that only partly happened.\n\nI was recently rereading this one and thought it might be useful to post it. I haven’t redacted anything from the version we circulated in 2020 (which was a little redacted to avoid pissing too many people off). I know it was read carefully by several people behind some of the new institutes in the US. Its blunt in places and I would moderate some of it now, but it shows some of what we were thinking before entering no10.\n\nPart 1 discusses some broad challenges in the science and technology space. I’d spent the years before having a hobby of trying to think and understand how to improve the processes of R&D, particularly in a UK context. I spoke to hundreds of people globally in a kind of ‘focus grouping’ of global science to see what issues people cared about, and what a government should be looking at.\n\nPart 2 [click to jump to] is a set of notes on the common elements between Bell Labs, Xerox PARC, and the Cambridge LMB, based on the reading citing and also my discussions with figures from these institutes like Sydney Brenner, Eric Betzig, and Alan Kay. I’ve since found what I think is a much more compelling way of explaining this argument, based on a talk I gave at Metascience 2022 in California, so I’ll be doing a second blog post on this. But that one will be a lot shorter and have much less detail than I put here. So if you want a reference dump on how those organisations worked, read on. The basic logic here is that rather than studying a single outlier laboratory, you look at the intersection of the Venn diagram to see what might be causal to their unique results.\n\nThis second study was the genesis of a ‘twin for ARIA’ program that didn’t make it through the Whitehall machine - the Lovelace program - which aimed to setup a network of research labs operating on fundamentally different principles to academic labs to diversify the structures. (ARIA was only one of several new things we felt needed to be created in UK R&D).\n\nThis might be of interest to some people to see what we were thinking prior to entering government, what we thought some key issues were, and it contains quite a lot of resources/citations that could be of use to people thinking about how to reinvent science. The endnotes are full of quotes/refs that could be of use.\n\nAgain, it is not comprehensive of what we were thinking/considering nor was it intended as a linear essay, its just the only one that’s legible enough to circulate. There is nothing in here about the practicalities/policies of implementation - its more of a historical analysis. I’ll blog some notes on that later. It also doesn’t cover UK ARPA (now ARIA) much because we’d covered that elsewhere.\n\nResearch ecosystems need structural diversity: a collection of rough notes & thoughts on the structures of scientific research, with emphasis on the common features of Bell labs/LMB/Xerox PARC\n\nUnfinished resource/group wiki (not intended to be read linearly) - last updated April 2020\n\nTable of contents:\n\nSome quotations that cover the major themes as a ‘summary’\n\nThe structure of the scientific unknown, and a science ecosystem crisis\n\nIs there a slowing of scientific progress?\n\nFinding secrets: the scientific unknown and an entrepreneurial, start-up science\n\nTaking the hidden paths: start-up dynamics and disruption of the prevailing views 1\n\nA science ecosystem climate crisis: central management of research, perverse incentives, and an increasingly Potemkin academy\n\nWellcome’s 2020 Research Culture report: ‘[research] is about to collapse’\n\nCommon features of three of the most successful research laboratories in history\n\n1. Fund scientific communities not scientific factories: “focussed ecosystems pursuing tech visions”\n\nLearn lessons from three of the most transformative research institutes in history\n\nXerox PARC: the creation of personal computing.\n\nCambridge MRC laboratory of molecular biology (1950s-70s): the foundations of molecular biology\n\nAT&T Bell Labs: ‘One policy, one system, universal service’\n\nAn anti-bureaucracy silver bullet: institutes should be fully internally funded at an elite level\n\nIdentify unique and long-term visions\n\nThese long-term visions become talent attractors\n\nForm scientific ecosystems, not factories, by recognising the social nature of science\n\n2. Invest long-term in promising world class scientists instead of individual projects\n\nAllow researchers to focus entirely on research and mentoring, not bureaucracy\n\nInvest in exceptional scientists rather than individual projects\n\nDistant central edict cannot control innovation: Give researchers great freedom to pursue ‘heretical’ ideas and realise that ‘impact’ actually means ‘well-received by current opinion’\n\nUse internal evaluation to allow assessment of an individual’s ecosystem contribution, with external evaluation of the institute\n\nBalance internal and external hiring to maintain culture and reward contributions (do not ban internal hires)\n\nFacilitate research via strong core support, technical assistance and resources\n\nA brief summary\n\n3. Organise as self-organising start-up style small teams, not hierarchical bureaucracies\n\nAge balance in research societies: balancing youthful ignorance and senior wisdom\n\nFlatten the hierarchy: positive feedback in academic power and “The slavery of graduate students”\n\nRemaining dynamic: do not give tenure to researchers\n\nCredit assignment & ‘pianists without fingers’: we need research supervisors\n\nBe people number limited: prevent empire building and promote cross-disciplinary collaboration via enforcement of small team sizes\n\nEmpower promising young researchers\n\nSome further resources\n\nAppendix - Bureaucracy vs start-up\n\nSome quotations that cover the major themes as a ‘summary’\n\n“Every now and then I receive visits from earnest men and women armed with questionnaires and tape recorders who want to find out what made the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge (where I work) so remarkably creative...... creativity in science, as in the arts, cannot be organized. It arises spontaneously from individual talent. Well-run laboratories can foster it, but hierarchical organization, inflexible, bureaucratic rules, and mounds of futile paperwork can kill it. Discoveries cannot be planned; they pop up, like Puck, in unexpected corners.”\n\nFirst MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology Director Max Perutz\n\n‘The ARPA/PARC history shows that a combination of vision, a modest amount of funding, with a felicitous context and process can almost magically give rise to new technologies that not only amplify civilization, but also produce tremendous wealth for the society. Isn’t it time to do this again by Reason, even with no Cold War to use as an excuse?’\n\nAlan Kay, Xerox PARC researcher and pioneer of personal computing\n\n‘I am afraid that there will be little tangible left in a later age to remind our heirs that we were men, rather than cogs in a machine.’ John Pierce, Bell Labs researcher and a key player in the 20th century communications revolution (Gertner 2012, pg. 360).\n\n“Heroic lone-wolf entrepreneurs may be the preferred heroes of narratives spun by the media, but history has shown us that teams—and the networks that come from them—are the true engines behind innovation in Silicon Valley and far beyond. No one understood this better than Bob Taylor.” Obituary of ARPA/PARC pioneer Bob Taylor in Wired\n\n‘I learnt very quickly that the only reason that would be accepted for not attending a committee meeting was that one already had a previous commitment to attend a meeting of another organization on the same day. I therefore invented a society, the Orion Society, a highly secret and very exclusive society that spawned a multitude of committees, sub-committees, working parties, evaluation groups and so on that, regrettably, had a prior claim on my attention. Soon people wanted to know more about this club and some even decided that they would like to join it. However, it was always made clear to them that applications were never entertained and that if they were deemed to qualify for membership they would be discreetly approached at the appropriate time.’\n\nSydney Brenner, pioneer of molecular biology\n\n‘The important breakthroughs come from loonshots, widely dismissed ideas whose champions are often dismissed as crazy.’\n\nSafi Bahcall, ‘Loonshots’\n\n‘If the work you propose to do isn’t virtually certain of success, then it won’t get funded’—Nobel Laureate Roger Kornberg (Lee, May 28th 2007, Washington Post)\n\n‘Even God wouldn’t get a grant today because somebody on the committee would say, oh those were very interesting experiments (creating the universe), but they’ve never been repeated. And then someone else would say, yes and he did it a long time ago, what’s he done recently? And a third would say, to top it all, he published it all in an un-refereed journal (The Bible).’\n\nSydney Brenner, pioneer of molecular biology\n\n\"I recently learned a disagreeable fact: there are influential scientists in the habit of putting their names to publications in whose composition they have played no part. Apparently some senior scientists claim joint authorship of a paper when all that they have contributed is bench space, grant money and an editorial read-through of the manuscript. For all I know, entire scientific reputations may have been built on the work of students and colleagues! I don't know what can be done to combat this dishonesty.”\n\nRichard Dawkins, introduction to the selfish gene [we emphasise that since this was written decades ago, what he describes has in many ways become the system and the norm in biomedical science and it would look odd and harm their ability to get grants for a senior scientist not to put their name on their junior scientists papers regardless of contribution. It is therefore now not ‘dishonesty’ in many cases. A Nobel Laureate told us he puts his name on papers in order to help his students get published in flashy journals at their request, despite feeling deeply uneasy about it. We suggest that rather than authorship, in many cases the lab affiliation should be listed alongside department affiliation]\n\n“... there is a serious problem with incumbents hoarding opportunity. Just make them compete with their grad students and postdocs. Make them get back into the lab. Make them do the analysis. That would sort things out pretty quickly.”\n\nA comment on this piece by a researcher from a free-standing institute\n\n“I strongly believe that the only way to encourage innovation is to give it to the young. The young have a great advantage in that they are ignorant. Because I think ignorance in science is very important. If you’re like me and you know too much you can’t try new things. I always work in fields of which I’m totally ignorant.”\n\nSydney Brenner, pioneer of molecular biology\n\nGoogle AI’s view of Academia, [edit: see new 15th Jan Wellcome report for similar]\n\nThe structure of the scientific unknown, and a science ecosystem crisis\n\nThese notes concern disruptive research and impediments to them.\n\nIs there a slowing of scientific progress?\n\nIt has been persuasively argued that technological progress has slowed or at least become far less efficient relative to the early/mid 20th century, when World Wars, the Space Race and the Cold War compelled government investment in high-risk technology beyond that which private capital could provide (see this Kasparov speech [‘reviving the spirit of innovation’, 2013, Oxford] and footnote1)2. This correlates with a historic shift in mindset, from wanting vertical growth (doing new things) to horizontal (more of the same, ie, one to many), beginning in the late 1960s. Quarterly GDP change now matters more than long-term results, and we are living with the long-term consequences of this chronic short-term thinking. At the national level, reaching the moon (1960s) vs a focus on GDP per year (1970s onward) represents this shift in attitude.\n\nCowen and Southwood (2019) highlight a decline in economic growth, and a decline in general purpose technologies (GPTs)3. For example:\n\nReproduced from Cowen/Southwood. They write: “Overall, consider Robert J. Gordon’s simple take: ‘U.S. economic growth slowed by more than half from 3.2 percent per year during 1970-2006 to only 1.4 percent during 2006-2016.’”\n\nThe physicist turned-researcher-into-research Michael Nielsen4 and Stripe founder Patrick Collison also wrote an essay (“Is science stagnant?”in the Atlantic) in 2018 suggesting that scientific innovation is slowing down since the 1970s. They focussed upon Nobel Prizes, surveying scientists and finding that recent work is not judged by fellow scientists to be of the same transformative type as earlier work5. They find physicists rate the importance of earlier work more highly, with the 1990s and 2000s lacking sufficient Nobel Prizes to be included (1900s included a lot of eccentric Nobel Prizes when the award was new):\n\nDiscovery impact scores for physics nobel prizes from the survey of Collison/Nielsen. Note that the 1990s/2000s did not get enough nobel prizes to be included in the analysis.\n\nNielsen/Collison found similar though slightly better results in other fields6.\n\nA related point is made with respect to the biotechnology industry by Peter Thiel: ‘Despite dramatic advances over the past few centuries, in recent decades biotechnology hasn’t met the expectations of investors—or patients. Eroom’s law—that’s Moore’s law backward—observes that the number of new drugs approved per billion dollars spent on R&D has halved every nine years since 1950.’ (p75, Thiel, Zero to One).\n\nThese views are not conclusive as it is difficult to assess innovation (they may even underestimate the problem), but we are certainly not living in the tech future we predicted in the 1950s (Mars habitation, cures for cancer, fast speed of plane travel, etc...—see footnote for historical example7). Almost all progress has been in ‘bits’ not ‘atoms’.\n\nOne extreme explanation is that the scientific slowdown is due to science getting harder, with low hanging fruit being gone. This may be the case in part8. Another view is that the slowdown is due a severe shift in the balance of power within the scientific system from a ‘start-up’ style mode to a risk averse, bureaucratised system with power increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small group of more established, senior individuals and bureaucratic staff. As Cowen and Southwood highlight, researchers are increasingly tied into Kafka-esque bureaucracies9. This suggests great riches could be found by enterprises that can create alternatives to this system.\n\nFinding secrets: the scientific unknown and an entrepreneurial, start-up science\n\nAlbert Einstein, quoted in The Pittsburgh Press, December 28th 1934.\n\nTo understand how we should create new research systems, we should first consider the structure of the landscape of the unknown, and how, historically, such unknowns have become known.\n\nThe secrets trap: there is always a sense that we know the landscape of the scientific unknown, that majority opinion knows where to look, and that top-down and senior individuals know what is to come. Yet the established scientific experts at any given moment in history have usually been entirely wrong about the future of their fields. Newton was unexpected in 1663. Darwin’s Origin of Species was a revolution. The papers of Einstein’s annus mirabilis was so unexpected and outside the norm that they were difficult to publish10,11. The ‘leaders’ of today’s science historically have typically not provided tomorrow’s insights, and are unlikely to in the future (some do, but it is by far the minority).\n\nIn this way, the origin of molecular biology came in part from physics at the Cavendish, Cambridge—Steve Hsu writes that “many molecular biology departments were established (originally with names like BioPhysics!) against the wishes of \"real'' biologists of the era.” Invaders, as Hsu calls them. Likewise, today the cure for Alzheimer’s is likely lying hidden in the unknown, not where the herd is looking. The cure for Alzheimer’s, based on historical precedent, will not come from funding the prevailing view of what constitutes ‘Alzheimer’s research’. See “How an Alzheimer’s ‘cabal’ thwarted progress toward a cure’ by Sharon Begley - are we are about to repeat the mistake with clean energy by flocking to the ‘most likely options’?\n\nAs Thiel writes: ‘The best place to look for secrets is where no one else is looking’. A beautiful recent (2015) UK example of apparently blue skies research with major implications for dementia comes from studying hibernating animals such as hedgehogs, finding a potential new brain protecting chemical working in a very unexpected way (see BBC and Nature, and a clue from 1989!)! Completely outside the prevailing orthodoxy.\n\nIn Zero to One, Thiel highlights a number of reasons why we are now much less able to find secrets and thus transform our world (in footnotes)12. We shall see that the university system, with tenure and central approval of funding, suffers significantly from these incentive problems that limit its ability to do some kinds of research [see this recent 2020 NBER paper Bhattacharya and Packalen, 2020]. The UK should strongly factor these points into how we fund research, encouraging different systems to collectively explore diverse parts of the unknown rather than low-risk herding (which likely is just replicating other countries' current efforts anyway). We need mechanisms to consciously drive such ‘outside the box’ consensus breaking research. Instead all current pressures and incentives align with satisfying current peers.\n\nTaking the hidden paths: start-up dynamics and disruption of the prevailing views\n\nWe need to nurture a diversity of research endeavours. An example of different styles of research is explained in a 2001 speech13 from then DARPA director Fernando ‘Frank’ Fernandez, who said “People like Dr. Clayton Christensen of Harvard have argued that there are really two kinds of innovation (Fig. 1). There’s the well-planned, evolutionary, sustaining innovation, which is where you have a road map and, based on this road map, you change the way you do business in a fairly predictable manner. Most good organizations have such road maps. The second kind of innovation is radical, disruptive innovation, where something new happens that initially doesn’t fit into and probably doesn’t improve upon the current way of doing business. But if this radical innovation can be nurtured, it will eventually far exceed the performance of the standard business model.”\n\nFigure 1 referred to by former DARPA Director Fernandez - Note how the radical, disruptive research requires accepting a performance drop before a performance increase, and so cannot be found via a locally greedy optimisation.\n\nIn the world of business such considerations are much more common: the world of start-ups realises that there are always unconventional yet transformative ideas lurking in the shadows away from clear view, and that large institutes are unlikely to find them. Peter Thiel writes ‘Every one of today’s most famous and familiar ideas was once unknown and unsuspected’ (Thiel, 93).\n\nDespite this diversity of research style, there is very little consideration of how the career structures and power organisation allocation in research systems alters the style of research they produce. There is essentially no consideration of whether PhD->Postdoc->Tenure track etc is the right one for all types of government funded research. Careful, incremental scholarly research has different requirements than, say, development of new experimental methods for biology.\n\nA science ecosystem climate crisis: central management of research, perverse incentives, and an increasingly Potemkin14 academy\n\n‘If there is the tiniest difference between the behavior you want and the incentives you offer, people will find it.’15 Paul Graham, Y Combinator co-founder amongst other achievements, on Twitter 17th Feb 2020\n\nModern approaches to science bureaucracy often ignore a) the health of the scientific ecosystem and b) the nature of the scientific ecosystem as a complex system with complex incentives, feedback loops and many agents with different priorities. Rather than hand power to the scientists themselves, science bureaucracies often instead think that science can be micromanaged from afar in a top-down manner, selecting for ‘impact’, ‘translatability’ and ‘market potential’ but history and our current predicament suggest at least some caution here. Much of the growth of research policy has arguably harmed research because they try to control something they do not, and arguably cannot, understand (as complex systems prediction is very much in its infancy) 16. We need a more systems-level research policy, evaluating the relationship between parts not summed integration of isolated metrics.\n\nCentral management’s reliance on metrics is necessary because a distant bureaucracy can only ever have a scattered, low resolution image of an environment it seeks to control. It is very difficult to assess creative science over the short-term, and attempts to do so focus on what can be remotely quantified (citations, journal impact factor, short term competitor/peer assessment of impact), rather than on what is important (truth, long-term impact, benefit to science ecosystem health (good mentoring etc)17). When central management rewards such metrics, it creates an incentive, meaning people work to optimise the metric rather than what you are intending to reward (this is Campbell’s law18). It is far easier and better rewarded to optimise for short-term attention grabbing than it is to do lasting and important scholarly work, which eventually corrupts the culture of the system as a whole. The system therefore leads not just to what Smaldino and McElreath (2016)19 call the ‘natural selection of bad science’, but actually directly incentivises bad science and promotes more of it (and thus promotes bad scientists) . This, in a nutshell, is why we risk having an increasingly Potemkin academy, and why productivity has become a cheap substitute for ‘excellence’. (One could ask, only part facetiously, whether the UK’s Research excellence framework should more accurately be called the ‘bureaucratic short-term appearance of productivity framework’?)\n\nWhen we reward being productive over being correct or creative, phenomena such as empire building, taking credit for others work, exploitative practices, poor quality control, misleading analysis and other such problems rise (see part 2). Though they can be detected locally, central bureaucracy is necessarily blind to these phenomena, revealing a strength of local control. We have unintentionally incentivised a large amount of bad science and bad behaviour, usually by good, well-intentioned people.\n\nThe long-timescales over which the research system operates mean the symptoms of this take a long time to develop, but are severe - a climate change of the academic ecosystem. Unlike the financial system, there is no way of the system ‘blowing up’ to reveal how rotten it has become, because collective interest amongst scientists mean they are reluctant to speak out (the recent UK government report contains no mention of any of these problems, or any significant problems whatsoever - try to find a single mention of young scientists in the report titled ‘Ensuring20 a successful UK research endeavour’) (an excellent analogy between modern research and the financial crisis is found from Scientific American blog in 201921. The difference is that broken research cannot completely ’collapse’ and reset, it just lingers on, as it is not subject to competitive displacement).\n\nSome unfortunate consequences of this:\n\nFrom Monya Baker, 2016, Nature - 1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility\n\n“Survey sheds light on the ‘crisis’ rocking research”\n\nModern academic research is substantially non-replicable: as productivity is rewarded over accurate scholarship (see Ed Yong articles - As Ed Yong wrote in 2019 “They’re an almost inevitable product of an academic world that rewards scientists, above all else, for publishing papers in high-profile journals—journals that prefer flashy studies that make new discoveries over duller ones that check existing work…. People are rewarded for being productive rather than being right, for building ever upward instead of checking the foundations.”\n\nA large replication studies suggests only half of studies in psychology can be replicated (Ed Yong 2018, Atlantic))\n\nEd Yong reported in ‘A waste of 1,000 research papers’, the Atlantic 2019, that ‘Decades of early research on the genetics of depression were built on nonexistent foundations.’22, with the paper suggesting that the foundation of an entire field of medical genetics, and the contents of approximately 1,000 research papers, is entirely statistically spurious.\n\nFrom Nature’s news website by Brian Owens (2011): “Bayer halts nearly two-thirds of its target-validation projects because in-house experimental findings fail to match up with published literature claims...An unspoken industry rule alleges that at least 50% of published studies from academic laboratories cannot be repeated in an industrial setting.”\n\nAn influential paper by Ioannidis from 2005 in PLOS, called ‘Why most published research findings are false’, summarising it as blaming ‘investigator prejudice, incorrect statistical methods, competition in hot fields and publishing bias, whereby journals are more likely to publish positive and novel findings than negative or incremental results’. The opening line of that paper summarises the problem well: ‘There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false.’23,24 (see25 for a slate star codex piece on this claim).\n\n[Edit feb 2020] Particularly disturbing is the suggestion from a journal editor in chief26 at molecular brain, a subsidiary of nature, that a substantial fraction of papers cannot provide raw data on request - ‘more than 97% of the 41 manuscripts did not present the raw data supporting their results when requested by an editor, suggesting a possibility that the raw data did not exist from the beginning, at least in some portions of these cases.’ The ‘41’ manuscripts are just under a quarter of all submitted manuscripts handled by the editor.\n\nA luxury journal system which has led to a damaging magazine style of science (see Nobel Laureate Randy Schekman in Guardian), with ‘stories not studies’, high impact paper chasing and competitive (antagonistic) peer reviewing (for solution suggestions see27).\n\nTraining far more PhDs and postdocs than there are jobs for (by some estimates a 10:1 ratio, Ben Barres 2017, Nature). - (top graduate students and postdocs are not trainees: they are the real scientists).\n\nEver-lengthening PostDoc “training” as people need more and more papers to arrive at job interviews with higher metrics, like rainforest trees outcompeting each other for light. This has put particular pressure on families as academics lack stable jobs until their forties and the long-hours training period corresponds to child bearing ages.\n\nIncreasing use of graduate students as cheap technicians (What Sydney Brenner called ‘The slavery of graduate students’). In large parts of biology many professors rarely actually do significant amounts of research, instead using large numbers of graduate students to churn out papers. One consequence of this is that the standards for entry to programs have dropped and the systems are not designed for training the most exceptional talent anymore. Brenner makes this point well his interview with Elizabeth Dzeng, available online here.\n\nOperating large labs in order to maximise the number of papers a senior author can take credit for whilst crowding out junior scientists (the declining value of authorship). There needs to be a very fundamental rethink of scientific publishing - the current culture of a senior author, with many in the lab, taking effective intellectual ownership of other’s work via ‘last authorship’. This could be changed with government level ambition (wellcome open science is pushing similar)28.\n\nProfessors competing with their trainees and preventing them continuing their research outside (Ben Barres, 2017, Nature).\n\nThis matters beyond the academy29: for an example of how the social dynamics of well intentioned people can halt a field's progress, see “How an Alzheimer’s ‘cabal’ thwarted progress toward a cure’ by Sharon Begley, July 2019, perhaps delaying a viable treatment for decades by stifling exploration diversity.\n\nSome of these problems arise from trying to make the academic system do modern research without reforming its career structure—we need more support staff (programmers, engineers, technicians, potentially with accompanying training degrees) and fewer postdocs (see Alberts et al 2014 in PNAS for postdoc overtraining issues). But this is also due to central management, and is a critique of having incentives when there is too big a gap between a) what you want to incentivise (long-term benefits) and b) what you can in practice incentivise (citations # etc)30.\n\nTo repeat a core theme, these problems are in many cases an unavoidable result of distant central management attempts, because central management ends up producing systems that they can understand and exert control over rather than actually improving the original system (this is known as legibility, from ‘Seeing like a state’ by James Scott31). As a blog title puts it, ‘every attempt to manage academia makes it worse32’. Central bureaucracies can be blind to much of what really matters in innovative societies.\n\nFrom Edwards and Roy 2017\n\n‘Academic Research in the 21st Century: Maintaining Scientific Integrity in a Climate of Perverse Incentives and Hypercompetition’.\n\nIt will also relatively drive out those who seek scientific excellence as opposed to those seeking scientific fame/power via playing politics. Edwards/Roy 2017 quote Dunn, December 2013 in the Chronicle of Higher Education as saying a major reason for academics leaving the academy is the presence of ‘‘a perverse incentive structure that maintains the status quo, rewards mediocrity, and discourages potential high-impact interdisciplinary work’’ (Dunn, 2013). Edwards/Roy conclude: ‘If a critical mass of scientists become untrustworthy33, a tipping point is possible in which the scientific enterprise itself becomes inherently corrupt and public trust is lost….’. We have placed excerpts from their piece into the footnotes34.\n\nCentral bureaucracies are good for scale, not for speed and flexibility and outside the box thinking. In correspondence to Nature in 2012 titled ‘Bureaucracy bypass let research flourish’, Min- Liang Wong highlighted:\n\nFour of the greatest discoveries of the twentieth century — the structure of the atom, quantum mechanics, the theory of relativity and the structure of DNA — were made without project reviewers or grant-giving agencies (B. Gal-Or Cosmology, Physics, and Philosophy p. 493; Springer, 1983).\n\nThe bureaucratic process requires a substantial burden of time on their researchers, such as elaborate grant application forms, and it is challenging to find expertise in the areas to centrally evaluate the proposals (Nurse report, 2015)35. In order to get past review panels, work must play into the current established thinking, otherwise it will likely get voted down by someone who thinks it won’t work (see below and Guzey 2019b for peer review being a disaster in a hypercompetitve field36). Further, the peer review process may operate only little better than luck in many cases 37. Recently funders have acknowledged this issue38 and in several cases begun incorporating random selection in handing out resources39 (D Adam, November 2019, Nature, ‘Science funders gamble on grant lotteries’).\n\nAs Alan Kay wrote of science bureaucracy in a comment on a blog post: ‘Their problems come from feeling that something is wrong if only (say) 35% of the results are breakthroughs. They think this is “not efficient”, but I think this is a hangover from school where students are given easy problems and are expected to solve most of them. The reality in *edge of the art* research is that the problems are not easy, but the ones that get solved then provide enormous leverage to civilization.’ This approach/mindset means that edge of the art research, as Kay calls it, simply don’t get supported. This in turn has led to a drift toward bureaucracy and incrementalism, which has become a vicious cycle.\n\nA simple cautionary tale from Ionnadis 2011, Nature40, ‘.....any system that demands high-risk innovative goals, and requires results, generates potential for exaggeration.’41\n\nDouglas Adam captures the problem well in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: the human urge for the creation of little green pieces of paper42. Likewise for rules and control.\n\nWellcome’s 2020 Research Culture report: ‘[research] is about to collapse’\n\nWhilst editing these notes (15th January 2020), the Wellcome Trust published the results of a large survey43 about research culture, matching this view of ecosystem dysfunction at a cultural level. Wellcome director Jeremy Farrar said: “These results paint a shocking portrait of the research environment.” A subset of the reports findings:\n\n‘78% of researchers think that high levels of competition have created unkind and aggressive conditions.’\n\n‘Only 14% of researchers agree that current metrics have had a positive impact on research culture….’There was a prevalent idea that funding criteria were a core driver of research misconduct. Many argued that the nature of these criteria, which rewarded researchers who had published in higher-impact journals, encouraged negative research behaviours, such as deliberate embellishment or distortion of data.’\n\n“Interviewees felt that funding was consistently granted to those with impactful research, and therefore teams that conducted rigorous research to exemplary ethical standards only to discover null data were often overlooked for future funding.”\n\nOnly 34% of respondents had received career advice or guidance from their supervisor, which is odd for a ‘training’ position(Figure 9). The same figure was true for mentors having ‘Connected you to others within or outside your field’.\n\n43% believe that their workplace puts more value on metrics than on research quality [we suspect the notion of ‘quality’ itself has become degraded also].\n\n‘69% of researchers think that rigour of results is considered an important research outcome by their workplace. However, one in five junior researchers and students (23%) have felt pressured by their supervisor to produce a particular result.’\n\n‘Just over half of researchers (53%) have sought, or have wanted to seek, professional help for depression or anxiety.’\n\n‘Many respondents described a system of patronage and power.’\n\nThe consequence, as a Russell group postdoc quoted in the report said “Really, I think [research culture is] about to collapse. Huge things need to change, otherwise they’re going to find everybody’s going to have left academia….”\n\nDespite their ‘shocking’ nature, perhaps most shocking is that these cultural issues have been essentially completely absent from the priorities of scientific leadership: see for example the 2015 government review of science, titled ‘Ensuring a successful UK research endeavour’, which was written from the perspective of senior people and created more bureaucracy44. The entirety of the reports comments on scientific culture are in this footnote45. The report does raise important issues (see example46) but proposes no solutions (the creation of a new overarching bureaucracy is not a solution in and of itself and in view of many is the problem), and resorts to statements of aspiration devoid of any concrete proposal47. By contrast, deep problems with the current system such a lack of focus on young scientists have been highlighted in a bottom up way (for example, see Phillips/Phillips 2018, Telegraph).\n\nDue to flaws in the Haldane principle48, designs around science funding are often made by and from the perspective of the very senior individuals sitting around tables in London. Such individuals have no direct incentive to address fundamental problems (since for them, all is well) (edit Feb 2020 - see new piece by Peter Thiel in ‘first things’49). There is an unhealthy power asymmetry in the research ecosystem and a lack of a corrective mechanism (such as public discontent)50. Because many Professors (in biology at least) often no longer do much research but rather manage laboratories, edit journals and serve on committees, societies such as the royal society increasingly reflect collections of formerly practicing scientists, rather than their original role as bubbling cauldrons of science. Their membership is an award for important and accomplished scientists, ‘Fellowship of the Royal Society has been described by The Guardian newspaper as “the equivalent of a lifetime achievement Oscar”. They therefore often unintentionally advocate as instruments of the status quo, rather than serving as an active forum for debating, facilitating and improving the collective scientific endeavour.\n\nRecognising the contribution of distinguished scientists is of course good, but we additionally need a ‘royal society’ for practicing scientists ‘at the bench’, an elite national society for brilliant and promising minds to link up the nation’s innovators and disruptors through informal bottom-up conferences, workshops and generous long-term fellowships.\n\nThese factors combine to mean that consulting only the usual voices will likely unintentionally produce a very distorted sense of how to increase the budget. For an example of how money might be mis-spent, we can look at the effective doubling of the US NIH budget during late 1990s/early 2000s. This simply led to people who wouldn’t have been good enough to get funded being funded, a glut of extra postdocs and PhDs being trained, without a clear increase in the quality of the product. Indeed, the subsequent overtraining arguably contributed to the hypercompetitive atmosphere in academia (see Alberts et al 2014, ‘rescuing US biomedical research from its systemic flaws) (see footnote for example detail51). A doubling of the science budget is not at all guaranteed to meaningfully improve the system.\n\nThis suggests that a much more diverse range of opinions should be sought including those internationally and across career stages, with special emphasis on ‘outlier’ institutes and systems that have returned a disproportionate amount of innovation and discovery, but that are not present in the current system to a significant extent.\n\nPart 2 - Common features of three of the most successful research laboratories in history\n\nOne explanation for this slowing is that we no longer have some kinds of scientific structure that we used to have. Government has announced an intention to create a UK ARPA, but there are other examples from that period.\n\nThese looked quite different to universities and are largely gone. We will now examine what are probably the three most significant laboratories of the twentieth century: Xerox PARC, the Cambridge Laboratory of Molecular Biology, and AT&T Bell Labs. Together they gave rise to the fundamentals of personal computing, molecular biology and communications technology, and created international networks of science with their founding institutes at the center.\n\nThough it is tempting to view them as somehow magical curiosities, they were, as Bell Labs president Kelly said of his own lab, ‘No house[s] of magic’. Instead they followed a set of structural principles, from which great work emerged in a long-term and relatively unplanned and unforeseen manner (though they had many short-term successes also). Our goal is to examine them and work out how to replicate them.\n\nWhat is most interesting to us is that when one examines these institutes, we find their culture and organisational principles share a number of striking structural commonalities at odds with how modern research is organised, and contrary to common assumptions of how research is best organised. Recent attempts to learn from these commonalities, in particular HHMI Janelia, have become highly successful.\n\nPaper 2 examines whether it is likely they can be replicated effectively with similar order of magnitude results.\n\nThis section is structured in three overlapping parts:\n\nThe first part explores how, rather than a university department like ‘department of chemistry’, or of ‘computer science’, the institutes were instead focussed essentially upon what can broadly be termed visions.\n\nThe second part explores how researchers were selected and funded within this system.\n\nThe third part explores how power was allocated and interacted within the system (junior vs senior, for example), and how teams emerged.\n\nWhere points are ‘obvious’, our intent is to show how they were fundamental features of these laboratories, not some desirable add-on, and that they had myriad hidden benefits52.\n\nGoing forward it is important to note there were big differences these campuses, in terms of size, career path, duration etc. Bell, for example, appears to have had greater top-down guidance. But importantly, the top-down guidance was internal and so could be more intelligent (adaptable and using local control). If anything, that they varied along such dimensions and this and still had the commonalities above makes those commonalities more important, not less.\n\nNote: none of these institutes were funded by competitive, for-profit companies: all were either government money or effective tech monopolies.\n\n1. Fund scientific communities not scientific factories: “focussed ecosystems pursuing tech visions”\n\nLearn lessons from three of the most transformative research institutes in history\n\nXerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) (early 1970s)\n\nXerox PARC: the creation of personal computing.\n\nPeople view computers with an inevitability but it could have been much delayed had Xerox PARC not existed. Mitchell Waldrop (The Dream Machine (TDM)) highlights that in the 1950s Wall Street showed very limited interest in technology, just as technology was about to become of high importance. IBM itself totally missed the personal computing revolution even once all of its constituent parts were in place (p164, 187, TDM).\n\nIt was instead the visionary government funding agency ARPA that funded a network of university academics (including PhDs) that saw the promise of computing for the world beyond the lab (ARPA is one example that proves ‘visionary government funding’ is not always oxymoronic).\n\nXerox PARC was financially independent from the original ARPA but it grew from ARPA’s computing program directly and its culture largely came from it. Xerox PARC is widely credited (including by Gates/Jobs) for being a dramatic accelerator of personal computing. PARC was exclusively funded by Xerox’s effective monopoly in the area of photocopying.\n\nXerox PARC had a vision that built directly on JCR Licklider’s ARPA vision (and personnel): ‘Computers are destined to become interactive intellectual amplifiers for everyone in the world universally networked worldwide’ (Licklider).’ ARPA/PARC were effectively successors in the personal computing story, with researchers such as Kay extending the vision53.\n\nFrom Wired54: “the 1970s and early 1980s, the essential cluster was at Xerox PARC—and its leader was Bob Taylor. Taylor's lab was of such high caliber that at the time Stanford professor Donald Knuth called it \"the greatest by far team of computer scientists ever assembled in one organization.\" Taylor's Computer Science Laboratory, working with its sister Systems Science Laboratory, pioneered or perfected many of the innovations we associate with modern computing: the graphical user interface, icons, pop-up menus, cut-and-paste techniques, overlapping windows, bitmap displays, easy-to-use word processing programs, and Ethernet networking technologies, among others. When Steve Jobs famously visited Xerox PARC in 1979, these were the innovations he witnessed with awe and later incorporated into the Lisa and Macintosh computers.”\n\nXerox PARC won three Turing Awards for work in the early 1970s in large part guided by Licklider and later Kay’s vision (the Turing Award is the Nobel Prize equivalent in computer science) from a core research staff of barely 50 (It was smaller than the other institutes included here). More importantly than arbitrary prizes, it created personal computing, as noted above both Gates and Jobs credited their fundamental work. PARC invented the Xerox Alto, the first computer to resemble those we use today, with graphical interfaces. Many everyday features and underlying technologies of personal computing/modern offices were invented there, including object oriented programming, bitmap graphics, laser printing, what you see is what you get software, the ethernet and much more. It was, as Waldrop titles his book, a ‘dream machine’. It did most of this in approximately five years. After the mid-1970s the relationship with the Xerox bureaucracy broke down\n\nHow did PARC’s magic happen? It didn’t just happen to have the 50 best researchers in the world - Google almost certainly has many more brilliant people today than PARC had. As we shall see the key features emphasised by alumni are its organisation, structure and resulting culture. For an example of analysis of key features of creative research environments from someone inside xerox PARC, see this recent essay by Alan Kay.\n\nA cautionary note about PARC - it came directly out of an existing program (ARPA’s IPTO) and it did not last. Alan Kay and others ascribe this to a breakdown in the relationship with Xerox after around 5 years ((Bob Taylor had a contract with Xerox in the early days to give it freedom from Xerox). Had this not happened, would PARC have continued at a same-order-of-magnitude rate, or would it have stagnated? Brett Victor + others including Kay note much of Licklider’s vision remains unfulfilled.\n\nThe first Cambridge MRC Laboratory for Molecular Biology (LMB) building\n\nCambridge MRC laboratory of molecular biology (1950s-70s): the foundations of molecular biology\n\nFor the MRC laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge, the implicit vision was that the understanding of cellular life would come from understanding interactions between molecular structures, a near heresy at the time (its original name was the ‘MRC Unit for Research on the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems’).\n\nJames Watson, co-discoverer of the double helix, described it as “the most productive center for biology in the history of science” (Pennisi, 2003), with twelve Nobel Prizes amongst its staff as of 2019 (several more for work done by visitors at the LMB). By this flawed measure it is the most successful research institute in history.\n\nAs with Xerox PARC, LMB’s unique culture was critical:\n\n“A British newspaper once described [the Cambridge LMB] as a Nobel factory. But Klug [Nobel Laureate] takes issue with that characterization: ‘It’s more like a plantation, where you plant the seed.’ The fertilizer came in many forms—money, equipment, collegiality, to name a few.” (Pennisi 2003)\n\nIt has delivered many great advances, such as the structure of DNA, the genetic code, messenger RNA, much of modern developmental biology (C. elegans), genetic sequencing technologies, several major advances in broader structural biology, the cause of sickle cell anaemia, monoclonal antibody technology (critical for much modern immunotherapy and basic research) and much more. The LMB laid the foundations for molecular biology that underlies modern medicine. It also made Cambridge (UK) a global hub of molecular biology, with its alumni leading the world of biotech even today (a very underappreciated point).\n\nThe LMB is now much bigger with a much broader focus.\n\nWe will see that it shared its fundamental structural features with Xerox PARC and Bell.\n\nAT&T Bell Labs Murray Hill campus 1942\n\nAT&T Bell Labs: ‘One policy, one system, universal service’\n\n‘My first stop on any time-travel expedition would be Bell Labs in December 1947’\n\n55Bill Gates (Gertner, p. 4)\n\nFor the industrial Bell Labs, the vision was its founder Theodore Vail’s philosophy of a communications system delivered as and providing ‘One policy, one system, universal service’ for communications (p.20, Gertner). They were originally focussed on telephones in the US but the technology created generalised and scaled dramatically.\n\nThe Bell vision of a connected world would be delivered through technological process - as Gertner writes in his classic history of Bell: ’Eventually it came to be assumed within the Bell System that there would never be a time when technological innovation would no longer be needed.’ (p18, Gertner). It was tech progress that was inherent to the betterment of the system as a whole. Their task? ‘Our job, essentially, is to devise and develop facilities which will enable two human beings anywhere in the world to talk to each other as clearly as if they were face to face and to do this economically as well as efficiently’ (Oliver Buckley, Bell Labs vice president (1930s),Gertner p45).\n\nThrough this vision, Bell Labs laid the foundations of communications technology across almost the entire 20th century. To restate: the core enabling technologies of modern communications technology almost entirely come from one laboratory. Nine Nobel Prizes and four Turing Awards were given for work done there, with many discoveries not winning due to there not being an equivalent prize in the field (such as Shannon). More strikingly, only one institute exists that is structured even slightly similarly (Janelia, where three of us have worked).\n\nFundamental inventions include vacuum tubes, transistors, core parts of the laser, UNIX programming, C programming, cellular phone technology, fiber optics, photovoltaic cells, information theory, radio astronomy… there are many more. Many of these advances made telephones and later the internet possible. But it was also blue skies - cosmic background radiation was found there, and a Nobel Prize was given for microscope innovations.\n\nLike PARC and the LMB, Bell had a distinctive environment:\n\n‘[Claude Shannon] would later tell an interviewer that the institution of Bell Labs (its intellectual environment, its people, its freedom, and, most importantly, the Bell system’s myriad technical challenges) deserved a fair amount of credit for his information theory [arguably the foundational theory of digital computing].’ P135 Gertner\n\nIt was a culture tweaked by management for creativity, not simply productivity56.\n\nGertner’s 2012 book ‘The Idea Factory’ is by far the largest evaluation of Bell Labs. There has been surprisingly little other analysis of what made it work. Note how tricky it is to find a diagram or explanation of a Bell Labs managerial structure. The lack of interest in the organisational structure is telling.\n\nBell Labs is particularly interesting because it did not suffer the relative decline thought to be inevitable for institutes, at least until it was killed by antitrust regulators. Bell lasted many decades and if anything it improved in the first few decades. It did not regress to the mean and did not become stagnant/bureaucratised. For this reason I focus more on Bell than on the other two institutes.\n\nFor a critique of Bell labs see the footnote57.\n\nThis paper highlights common features of these funding structures that are essentially absent from modern research. The common features between them and their difference from modern science bureaucracy is, in our opinion, a major under recognised point in current research policy. In essence, the UK can learn from Bell/PARC/LMB in ways that will positively transform our world.\n\nAn anti-bureaucracy silver bullet: institutes should be fully internally funded at an elite level\n\nThe foundational difference in funding between these institutes versus Universities is that unlike the vast majority of basic research institutes in the world today, these institutes were all fully internally funded. They largely could not even apply for outside grants though there were exceptions. The institute as a whole was supported, and researchers inside the system had no need (and were essentially forbidden from) to apply for external grants. Instead, resources were allocated internally. This point about internal funding underlies many if not all of the points which come below58.\n\nFunding came from a single source, greatly simplified negotiations, reduced the chaos that arises from competing interests, and allowed decisiveness. Each extra funder would have come with new requirements and complexities. Instead: one source, one approach, independence, and simplicity.\n\nFurther, for two of the institutes their funding came from tech monopolies, which gave them greater funding freedom than is possible in competitive markets (see Thiel’s Zero to One, and also footnote59). Given that Britain lacks any tech monopolies, it is incumbent for the government to fill this void and create the kind of blue skies industrial research labs such as Bell Labs. They should be deliberately funding things that cannot be done without government money, in the style that monopolistic companies like AT&T were able to do.\n\nThis internal funding freed PARC, Bell and the LMB from the perils of relying on a distant, central bureaucracy and gave them independence to operate ‘outside the norm’. This is in marked contrast to how most University research is funded. Modern universities instead have a strong reliance on these external funding sources which are universally slow and suffer from common problems.\n\nVannevar Bush’s report that founded the modern US research endeavour\n\nThe current bureaucratic situation is very different to University research funding’s founding spirit. When President FDR asked for the war-time funding of science to be extended to peace time, he prescribed the following: “New frontiers of the mind are before us, and if they are pioneered with the same vision, boldness, and drive with which we have waged this war we can create a fuller and more fruitful employment and a fuller and more fruitful life.’60\n\nVannevar Bush\n\nWar time research in the US referred to by FDR came in large part from the Vannevar Bush’s World War 2 OSRD, which was created rapidly and outside existing channels (which led to push back, for quite amusing history see bold in 61). Strikingly, within 6 months, Bush’s war-time funding agency OSRD had awarded and delivered 126 research contracts. The entire OSRD system was up and running, from scratch, much faster than a US NIH allocation funding round (the main US biomedical grant), which recommends 8 months planning before even submitting the proposal, let alone it going through the peer review and the bureaucratic machine (see62 and 63):\n\nA 2019 tweet on the pre-submission phase of the US NIH grant only, longer than the entire startup time of the original government research agency OSRD\n\nAdopting full internal funding would protect research centers from critical problems in central management of science, and allow local control and decision making as is found in startups. In contrast, in Universities researchers are sometimes hired as much if not more for their ability to extract money from external central bureaucracy as they are for their ability to do truly groundbreaking science and innovation and/or help their scientific community.\n\nIdentify unique and long-term visions\n\nThe research visions uniting each institute allowed them to be a) known for something specific which in turn led them to be b) hubs and attractors for talent: they were ‘the place to be’.\n\nCritically, these visions were not a goal for direct ‘impact’: this is completely the opposite of how these institutes worked. The institutes were not about direct ideas to change today: they were each aiming over 20-30 year timescales (though Bell/LMB/PARC often had big impact much, much faster - aim for the stars and you will quickly reach the moon!). Bell Labs had a thirty year timescale from invention through to application (Gertner p305). ‘The Vail strategy [founder of Bell Labs], in short, would measure the company’s progress “in decades instead of years”’, yet many advances came much sooner (p18, Gertner). Alan Kay’s part of the PARC revolution came by imagining what would be possible in computing in twenty to thirty years time, and beginning the journey to that summit. At the early LMB Cambridge, Sydney Brenner, seeing Crick and Watson’s double helix model before its publication, saw the future of a subject that was a long way from the real world (yet largely birthed the UK’s bioscience sector and the UK’s huge influence on the global molecular biology network). Few of the advances had obvious immediate, real-world application at the time they were planned and their impact was often highly unclear, though advances were often quickly made use of in unexpected ways once they had been made.\n\nAn underappreciated point for these visions was that they were relatively unique at the time - they were emerging fields of technology. They were not just researching ‘cancer’ or ‘climate change’ (but had influence on them64): They were doing something outside the mainstream, pushing ‘think different’ not incremental/horizontal development. The institutes therefore had near monopolies in their area of research at least at their foundations. This is in contrast to academic departments between different Universities.\n\nSydney Brenner with the early ‘heretics’ at the Cambridge LMB, including Crick and Perutz\n\nWith hindsight their focus seems obvious. But at the time much of what they were doing seemed crazy to the mainstream. Sydney Brenner, on the early days of the LMB and of molecular biology itself65 (Interview w/Elizabeth Dzeng, 2014):\n\n‘What people don’t realise is that at the beginning, it was just a handful of people who saw the light, if I can put it that way. So it was like belonging to an evangelical sect, because there were so few of us, and all the others sort of thought that there was something wrong with us.\n\n‘I remember when going to London to talk at meetings, people used to ask me what am I going to do in London, and I used to tell them I’m going to preach to the heathens\n\n‘I think it would have been difficult to keep going without the strong support we had from the Medical Research Council66. I think they took a big gamble when they founded that little unit in the Cavendish [the predecessor to the actual physical institute built later in the 50s - this is a model to replicate]. I think all the early people they had were amazing. There were amazing personalities amongst them.\n\nThis is very different to how central bureaucracies usually fund institutes: these institutes are typically either very broad, or they are funding something which has already become mainstream (otherwise it cannot get past a committee of people - rare visions get voted down and regression to the mean occurs). But if you want to make a big difference there are advantages to not looking where everyone else is looking globally.\n\nThese long-term visions become talent attractors\n\n‘[A] great vision acts like a magnetic field from the future that aligns all the little iron particle artists to point to “North” without having to see it... The pursuit of Art always sets off plans and goals, but plans and goals don’t always give rise to Art. If “visions not goals” opens the heavens, it is important to find artistic people to conceive the projects’\n\nAlan Kay of Xerox PARC\n\nHaving unique, focussed visions allowed these institutes to become talent attractors, building a critical density of excellent people focussed on a problem. Of the early cambridge LMB:\n\n‘The increasing international reputation of the group’s work brought talented young scientists to Cambridge, including physicist Francis Crick as a research student and biologist James Watson as a postdoc.’ (Bynum, 2012)\n\nAs Nobel Laureate Horvitz wrote of the cambridge LMB:\n\n“In the budding field of molecular biology, “his [Perutz’s] operation became known as the place to be,” says John Sulston, who shared.. [the]... Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine with Brenner and H. Robert Horvitz. (Pennisi 2003)”\n\nOr Brenner in the King’s review:\n\nThis [the early LMB] was not your usual university department, but a rather flamboyant and very exceptional group that was meant to get together. An important thing for us was that with the changes in America then, from the late fifties almost to the present day, there was an enormous stream of talent and American postdoctoral fellows that came to our lab to work with us. But the important thing was that they went back. Many of them [UK LMB members] are now leaders of American molecular biology, who are alumni of the old MRC.’67 Brenner, Dzeng interview\n\nForm scientific ecosystems, not factories, by recognising the social nature of science\n\nThese laboratories became communities of scientists, not simply collections of people working separately. It allowed a “critical mass” of people to appear, a phrase Bell Labs management specifically used and recognised the need for (p 153, Gertner). Bell became more than the sum of its parts, with Bell Labs president Kelly describing Bell as a ‘living organism’ (p 151, Gertner) -‘physical proximity was everything’.\n\nHaving a focussed research vision means almost every talk is relevant to everybody in the building. Spontaneous interactions were far more likely to lead to positive results than in a university department where everything was working on very different things (though university departments bring other benefits of greater diversity of research focus). These interactions were so critical to the Bell Labs mode that there was a rule that nobody could decline to help a colleague, and all office doors had to be kept open (only Claude Shannon broke this rule)(p151, Gertner). Bell Labs architecture was consciously designed with this in mind68. Similar rules existed at the LMB in its heyday - ‘Per Perutz’s order, there were no doors, no locked cabinets— no secrets among scientists.’69 (Pennisi 2003)\n\nBrenner himself described the Cambridge LMB environment as ‘absolutely the most marvelous place to work in’ (Friedberg 2010, pg 117), and highlighted its social aspect. Comparing the LMB to a newer institute: ‘‘In the LMB, we were more tightly packed… It may be just a romantic sentiment, but I feel that when you are living in more of a warren, you may be more productive…. What’s terribly important in a lab is keeping it open and keeping the conversation going all the time.’ (Sydney Brenner in the 2013 HHMI winter bulletin). In his biography Friedberg describes Brenner routinely holding court on a Saturday morning, ‘talking for an hour or more with the young trainees’ and anybody who happened to pass through70,71. This social interaction is widely remembered as a hallmark of the LMB72. These environments teach without the need for courses, you get a real education by doing, by being, not by bureaucratic pedagogy.\n\nThis kind of freewheeling, cross-lab interaction is rarer in a University department, where the range of problems being worked on is vast, and other structural issues (such as being drowned in bureaucratic distractions, see below) can limit such workplace dynamics.\n\nRecognition of community was also present at the very origins of ARPA visionary Licklider’s vision when at MIT. As Licklider’s wife Louise said: ‘Cambridge [US] was like an anthill. Everybody was getting involved with everybody else - finding different challenges, taking up different ideas. I use the word cross-fertilisation because there was an awful lot of that going on. And quite a lot of socializing too.’ (P66, The Dream Machine). These interactions are a hidden cost of, and so are killed by, hierarchy, paperwork and lack of free time. Consider that modern grants and bureaucracy often prohibits scientists using their grant money even to take invited guest speakers travelling from abroad to dinner.\n\n2. Invest long-term in promising world class scientists instead of individual projects\n\nHow were individuals in these scientific ecosystems selected (broadly part 2) and self-organised (broadly part 3)?\n\nAllow researchers to focus entirely on research and mentoring, not bureaucracy\n\nThe ability to focus on research without distraction, not only total hours of research, is critical to doing great scientific work but largely ignored by science central management. Feynman73, Newton74, Cajal (modern neuroscience founder)75 and many others have said this76. Turing Award winner Richard Hamming, from Bell Labs, advised in his classic ‘You and your research’:\n\n``Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.'' Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don't want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime….. Most great scientists are completely committed to their problem. Those who don't become committed seldom produce outstanding, first-class work…..Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on your problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning, free.’\n\nThis advice is impossible to follow even loosely in any modern academic research environment77. In a publish or perish world, there is little time even to read other’s research, destroying scholarship, cross-fertilisation between fields and, critically, enjoyment. Creative work requires lots of ‘free time’.\n\nThe 2020 Wellcome trust report on research culture explored below found that more people agreed with the statement that “My institution/workplace’s expectations of me to undertake a number of roles leave me little time for research” than disagreed (44% vs 33%). We pay scientists to research but they do paperwork instead.\n\nMaher and Anfres 2016, Nature - Researchers spend less than half of their time doing research and this is worsening.\n\nA recent estimate is that researchers at all levels spend less than half of their time actually doing research, and that almost 40% felt this bureaucratic burden has worsened substantially just in the last 5 years (Maher and Anfres 2016, Nature). Given the fractionation of time and focus this entails, this likely substantially underestimates the harm (research output is nonlinearly related to time spent on it). Much of this distraction is inherent to the current University system and likely impossible to reduce without fundamental reform. This all occurs despite, or even because of, the huge increase in University bureaucrat number.\n\nMuch of this time wastage goes into the process of applying for and reviewing research grants, an inherent requirement of University. From a 2017 paper by some of our authors, slightly edited:\n\nTo illustrate how costly the growing bureaucratic burden upon scientists is, consider the grant writing process. Most grant proposals take months to prepare, and yet have very little chance of success. A study in the British Journal of Medicine (Herbert et al 2013) estimated that for a single round of applications, 550 years of researcher’s time was spent preparing proposals, with only a 25% success rate (which is higher than many grant success rates), equating to 412.5 years of wasted time. When multiplied across all funding applications, this is a truly extraordinary waste of our most highly trained minds’ time. Even if this is an upper estimate (though we suspect it is not), this waste is absurd… we have a system in which a medium sized lab, with approximately three to four projects, ends up writing very lengthy grants with a success rate of 20-30%. Thus, every 2-3 months (assuming 3 year projects), the lab head has to write an extensive grant application, with pilot data and numerous other requirements78. The incentive for real innovation in this system is low.\n\nAs a university vice president for research from the US recently remarked despairingly: ‘its amazing anybody gets anything done…’.\n\nIndividual universities themselves are also highly bureaucratic79. An everyday example of the absurdly slow and convoluted bureaucracy is that of a set of 5 LEDs, costing a total of under £10, has to go through a nine-step bureaucratic review process at a leading UK institute (see Phillips/Phillips 2018). In the UK, a neuroscientist friend recently had to wait three months after a grant was delivered and approved simply for the grant to go through UCL’s bureaucracy, three months during which he was therefore out of work (after several months of waiting for the grant to be approved). He spent more time waiting in total to get into the job than Bush’s War-time OSRD agency (above) took to be created and be fully functional80.\n\nThese problems are likely inherent to all large bureaucracies, but many bureaucracies think the issues are somehow solvable with more paperwork. When the new UK ARPA was announced there was predictable resistance to it being outside the UKRI bureaucracy (‘bizarre’ in the words of one prominent research policy researcher in New Scientist81), but one of the founding points of ARPA was that it was a way of getting around bureaucracy, like Lockheed’s Skunk Works82. The early ARPA visionaries realised the following:\n\n“Bureaucracy destroys initiative. There is little that bureaucrats hate more than innovation, especially innovation that produces better results than the old routines. Improvements always make those at the top of the heap look inept. Who enjoys appearing inept?” — Frank Herbert, Heretics of Dune, as quoted by Jake Wilder in this piece.\n\nAs Alan Kay says, you cannot have great ideas inside the beltway.\n\nA large fraction of this time wastage is removed by relying solely on internal funding. Without this step, an institute is inevitably locked into the problems inherent to external bureaucracies. This is why HHMI’s research campus Janelia declined both external NIH money and affiliation with nearby universities: the hidden costs of bureaucracy greatly exceeded the $10’s of millions they stood to gain.\n\nThis is the type of waste of taxpayers money we should be paying attention to - not worrying about mis-spending a pound or two on some LEDs.\n\nInvest in exceptional scientists rather than individual projects\n\n‘There’s no exploration any more except in a very few places….. [the researcher] would need to do something that’s important to advance the aims of the people who fund science.’ Sydney Brenner in Dzeng Interview, Kings Review\n\nUniversities are largely funded by each researcher applying to various central funding agencies for funding of individual projects. This project funding system sounds like a fair thing to do, but it is fraught with inherent difficulties (see below).\n\nRather than micromanaging projects, the institutes examined here focussed on bringing the best in the world to one place united by a vision, then giving them great freedom once admitted. The rest would sort itself out83. They invested in people not projects.\n\nContrastingly, researcher salaries in the UK are notoriously internationally low which limits our ability to attract top talent - in particle physics “The current rate is ~£17k for a student in London, this compares to $39k for a student at a leading US university and 29k Euros at a leading German university.”84\n\nAs Pennisi writes of the LMB:\n\nThe lab’s recipe for success dates back to its early days, when leaders such as Max Perutz had the luck and insight to pick the best and the brightest (among them some quite unorthodox choices) and secure them almost unlimited support, both financial and collegial. [Similar quotations in the footnote85].\n\nGertner’s book about Bell Labs is replete with similar tales of the need for talent at Bell Labs, with Bell bringing the best in and paying them ‘for their imaginative abilities’ (p3 Gertner)86.\n\nFor a useful comment on why unorthodox choices work see footnote87.\n\nWhen Bell Labs sensed opportunities in lasers, Kompfner, a deputy of Pierce, simply began travelling the world to bring the best to Bell:\n\n“He went around the world at that time, in 1960, trying to find good people - that's all he wanted, good people88, and he would try to persuade them to switch their disciplines to take on what he called ‘laser and optical communications research’”. P256 Gertner\n\nEven when projects failed, Bell Labs worked to keep the best scientists: ‘Bell Labs wasn’t going to fire us, they were going to tell us to find a job within Bell Labs.’ (p294, Gertner). This freed scientists to pursue risky work, knowing that their next project grant did not depend on definite success. In the University system, applying for a grant after a barren spell without successful papers is a largely futile endeavour, forcing collective low-risk, low-payoff research to ensure you get the next grant.\n\nBut these were no socialist utopias - surviving at Bell was highly competitive, it was simply that at Bell, like LMB/PARC, the individual as a whole was assessed, not the individual projects success - if you failed whilst pursuing a difficult target well, you would be kept on (see example in89). Ie, membership of the laboratory was the key cut off. This ‘people not projects’ is the direct opposite of the project-based University funding system.\n\nThese were ‘sink or swim’ institutes where you were solely kept on due to merit (‘Technically competent management, all the way up’). This was not publish or perish, as it wasn’t the short-term output that was used to assess people.\n\nDistant central edict cannot control innovation: Give researchers great freedom to pursue ‘heretical’ ideas and realise that ‘impact’ actually means ‘well-received by current opinion’\n\n\"You did what they said could not be done, you created things that they could not see or imagine\" From the final email of ARPA/PARC pioneer Bob Taylor, sent to his colleagues, quoted in wired.\n\nA critical issue is that though we might want to fund research into curing dementia or promoting clean energy, we do not know how to because we haven’t discovered it, and so attempts to do so will often simply inflate existing views rather than promote exploration (see the Alzheimer’s example above).\n\nIsaac Asimov writes in ‘How do people get new ideas?’ that “It is only afterward that a new idea seems reasonable. To begin with, it usually seems unreasonable. It seems the height of unreason to suppose the earth was round instead of flat, or that it moved instead of the sun, or that objects required a force to stop them when in motion, instead of a force to keep them moving, and so on.”\n\nGertner (p.184) cites a 1956 book, The Organisation Man by Whyte, which suggests why Bell Labs (and a similar industrial lab) had been so successful:\n\n‘Of all corporation’s research groups these two have been the most outstandingly profitable…. Of all corporation research groups these two have consistently attracted the most brilliant men [sic]. Why?…. Of all corporation research groups these two are precisely the two that believe in ‘idle curiosity’90.\n\nThe three institutes trusted the instincts of their hand picked researchers.\n\nAs Bell Labs Unix pioneer Kernighan said: ‘‘I was never told what I should be working on in thirty years!’ (Nottingham interview). He highlighted especially that ‘Most people worked on something that was long-term, or at least whose immediate application was not obvious’. A reminder that Bell Labs largely built the fundamentals of modern communications technology, a higher impact contribution than anything UK R&D has produced for 50 years.\n\nEven in Bell’s early days the first lab president Frank Jewett and architect of the first US east-west coast phone line Harold Harnold agreed on a need for what Gertner calls a certain ‘indistinctness about goals’ (p32, Gertner). Harold Arnold also said of scientific research: ‘Of its output, inventions are a valuable part, but invention is not to be scheduled nor coerced.’ As Ian Ross, who worked in the Bell Labs department doing transistor development in the 1950s, said ‘So often the original concept of what an innovation will do frequently turns out not to be the major impact.’(p250 Gertner). In the current government system, unpredictable discoveries and serendipity must be scheduled and have predicted impact or you won’t be funded!\n\nWhilst modern scientific funding and publication systems force consensus, these institutes fostered crazy thinking that allows ground breaking discoveries by heading to different parts of the scientific unknown.\n\nImpact was actually often consciously disregarded, even (especially?) in the genesis of the most fundamental and impactful advances, such as those of Claude Shannon91.\n\nThe LMB was similar, giving individual researchers the freedom to think differently92. An example comes from John Walker: this is what happened when he wanted to do the loonshot project at the LMB for which he would later win the Nobel Prize.\n\n‘Walker never needed to write a proposal about this new research direction [which led to the Nobel Prize]. At the time, MRC relied on the lab chiefs to decide how to spend the money it allotted to the lab; they, in turn, trusted their colleagues to come up with good projects. Thus, Sanger merely asked a few questions before saying, “ ‘Why don’t you get on with it?’ ” Walker recalls….. At the outset, the project did not garner much support. “Quite a number said I was a fool and that I was going to wreck my career,” says Walker. Instead, he shared the 1997 Nobel for determining the structure of ATP synthase. He then went on to figure out how this key membrane protein works.’ (Pennisi, 2003)\n\nWhy is the focus on impact by central bureaucracies deadly? The essence of the problem is that, as Alexey Guzey paraphrased our argument, “by focusing on ‘impact’ we're actually focusing on ‘current impact’, but almost all high impact research starts from low impact research which grows and is being recognized over time”. Truly important work is rarely recognised at the time it is born, and almost by definition is not accepted by the peers of the time. By requiring that ‘impact’ be recognisable by the average peer today, we are killing most genuinely impactful work and instead selecting for the consensus view rather than funding work that leads to unpredicted--and therefore likely more valuable--discoveries.\n\nBahcall has a useful Francis Bacon quote in his book Loonshots: ‘As the births of living creatures are at first ill-shapen, so are all Innovations, which are the births of time.’ Bahcall highlights the fragility of nascent original ideas, which lack the protective clothing of more mainstream thoughts - his book uses a description of them as being ‘ugly babies’.\n\nBahcall’s loonshots has important analysis of how structural organisation alters the dynamics of innovation, an extremely under analysed point in research policy which usually assumes a ‘University focussed’ policy.\n\nBahcall summarises a related point: ‘the important breakthroughs come from loonshots, widely dismissed ideas whose champions are often dismissed as crazy.’ (Bahcall, page 2). When truly important things arise, they look different from what we expect (or we would already have found them), and thus alien, suffering rejection. Twitter, Instagram, Google, Facebook etc were recognised as great ideas only after their success.\n\nNobel Laureate William Kaelin warned in Nature in 2017 that we must ‘adopt more humility about predicting impact, which can truly be known only in retrospect’ highlighting that ‘transformative discoveries such as restriction enzymes, yeast cell-cycle mutants and CRISPR–Cas9 were once considered simply oddities of nature’, and said that the bureaucratic systems emphasizing impact over quality in both funding and publishing were leading to a literature full of ‘mansions of straw’ and ever longer training periods.\n\nConsider this discovery of CRISPR-Cas9, perhaps the single most important practical and impactful scientific advance in thirty years. Jennifer Doudna, a Professor who was involved in the research team that did critical work, remembered thinking at the time of starting that project that ‘this is probably the most obscure thing I ever worked on’ and that she ‘certainly never anticipated would lead to something like this’93.\n\nEven when such an innovation actually appears, their impact is usually not anticipated broadly. Who predicted the impact of electricity in the 1800s? Or take Bell Labs: An internal AT&T market research piece from 1971 which somewhat stalled mobile phone development at Bell Labs - ‘There was no market for mobile phones at any price’ (Gertner, 289)94. Or the development of the transistor, perhaps the most influential innovation of the 20th century, which was relatively unnoticed outside Bell Labs at the time (and its full use was not appreciated even there)(p104 Gertner). Fiber optics, ARPANet and the internet, all fundamental steps to the 21st century, were met with muted reception regarding importance or were thought impossible by the majority opinion (p258, Gertner, p417, Waldrop).\n\nBrenner summarises:\n\nIn order to do science you have to have it supported. The supporters now, the bureaucrats of science, do not wish to take any risks. So in order to get it supported, they want to know from the start that it will work. This means you have to have preliminary information, which means that you are bound to follow the straight and narrow……...There’s no exploration any more except in a very few places….. he would need to do something that’s important to advance the aims of the people who fund science.\n\nAll of this should cause serious alarm bells about the entire UK government funding system now being predicated on predictable ‘impact’.\n\nThese points show that a research system in which every researcher must send their ideas for centralised approval by a committee is a very bad system for genuine innovation. As Thiel writes, ‘the best place to look for secrets is where no-one else is looking’.\n\nThere are ‘trillion dollar notes on the floor’95 - system-level dysfunction has led to large amounts of the profitable scientific unknown being not just unexplored, but unexplorable. The UK must have eyes for them.\n\nUse internal evaluation to allow assessment of an individual’s ecosystem contribution, with external evaluation of the institute\n\nSo the institutes provided almost entirely internal funding, and focussed on selecting top talent who could pursue ‘crazy’ ideas (rather micromanaging what researchers could do according to prevailing trends of the time).\n\nHow did LMB/PARC/Bell hire and evaluate researchers96?\n\nAn important difference between University departments and these institutes was that they used internal assessment as opposed to external assessment of researchers/funding decisions; they did not even bring in external opinion to assess individual researchers. Today University money comes from outside grants, and these outside grants are externally assessed, so researchers are beholden to the trends of the time.\n\nAssessments about renewal at the institutes were done by those familiar with the individual, their whole contribution to the ecosystem: they evaluated people, not paperwork. As Brenner said in an interview:\n\n‘I think one of the big things we had in the old LMB, which I don’t think is the case now, was that we never let the [external] committee assess individuals. We never let them; the individuals were our responsibility. We asked them to review the work of the group as a whole. Because if they went down to individuals, they would say, this man is unproductive. He hasn’t published anything for the last five years. So you’ve got to have institutions that can not only allow this, but also protect the people that are engaged in very long term, and to the funders, extremely risky work.’ Dzeng interview in King’s review\n\nBrenner’s view was that you have to review institutes as a whole, simply because evaluating the contribution of the parts from the outside is impossible to do effectively.\n\nThe same was known at Bell Labs. Unix Pioneer Brian Kernighan said in an interview with the University of Nottingham on the topic of evaluation/incentivisation of individual research, and how people stayed motivated despite not being told what to do:\n\n‘The way it worked was, once a year you had to write down on a side of one sheet of paper what you had done in the year, and they used that to determine how much they would pay you next year…. In some sense It [managing individuals research] didn’t matter so long as this collection of people did things that were useful. And they had produced things over the years that were useful….. Given an environment like that where everybody is better than you, you don’t slack, you try to keep up with them.’\n\nBoth were systems where good emerged from collections of excellent people motivated by internal motivation not external pressure.\n\nAll of this comes down to the obvious but almost totally ignored point that individuals contribute in ways other than their own research papers (itself very difficult to assess). Current centralised individual project assessment can never capture this. Gertner (2012) said of Bell Labs:\n\n‘... some lawyers in the patent department at Bell Labs decided to study whether there was an organizing principle that could explain why certain individuals at Bell Labs were more productive than others. They discerned only one common thread: Workers with the most patents often shared lunch or breakfast with a Bell Labs electrical engineer named Harry Nyquist. It wasn’t the case that Nyquist gave them specific ideas. Rather, as one scientist recalled, “he drew people out, got them thinking.” More than anything, Nyquist asked good questions.” Gertner p135.\n\nNyquist would himself make a great contribution to research (the Nyquist frequency), but even had he not, he was making a critical influence on the research ecosystem. Contributing to the health of the scientific society in such a way as Nyquist rather than publishing as many papers as you can is a very, very bad, even fatal, career move nowadays. An example from Oxbridge in the footnotes97. A recent (2019) paper in the new statesman highlights that this state of affairs would have been unthinkable 50 years ago98.\n\nAt the early LMB, this tolerance and use of local knowledge allowed ‘misfit’ and atypical characters like the 35-year old Francis Crick to remain in science despite no productivity99.\n\nEvaluate the collective, not the parts. Let the collective self-organise.\n\nBalance internal and external hiring to maintain culture and reward contributions (do not ban internal hires)\n\nAn important corollary to collective evaluation is internal promotion. In modern Universities internal hiring is frowned on - you are meant to hire people you know only as paperwork and a brief talk. This is a mistake: ecosystems need a balance of internal/external promotion/recruitment to a) maintain culture and reward internal contributions but also b) get outside ideas and prevent stagnation of a club-like atmosphere.\n\nWithout internal promotion, it is always in one’s interest to have an eye on the door and be beholden to the criteria imposed externally, not internally. If you cannot grow in an ecosystem, one has little ‘stake’ in the community and ultimately no reason to care about it beyond ethics. If merit does not let you grow in a research environment, you have no incentive in the collective. The institute is nothing but a vehicle to your own personal success.\n\nPARC/Bell internally promoted extensively100. Every Bell Labs president came from within Bell Labs, as did most/perhaps all of their managers, and they hired straight from graduate school and promoted through-out scientists careers101. Brenner, Crick etc came from the early MRC unit at Cavendish that grew into the LMB proper. PARC famously formed from the graduate alumni of Licklider’s ARPA IPTO. Trinity College Cambridge is similarly renowned for nurturing of talent and internal promotion (famously, Newton)102.\n\nA lack of internal hiring also strongly reduces the motivation to create the next generation of researchers: as Kay wrote of ARPA/PARC in a reply to a Telegraph article co-written by the author: “good results included ‘good people’ (i.e. long range funding should also create the next generations of researchers). In fact, virtually all of the researchers at Xerox PARC had their degrees funded by ARPA, they were “research results” who were able to get better research results.”\n\nThough it's good to get a range of experience in different places, lack of internal promotion or makes it hard to build self-organising teams, and prevents maintenance of culture. The current culture of endlessly moving between institutes in one’s youth prevents a stable, collaborative atmosphere arising amongst scientists and promotes selfishness.\n\nFacilitate research via strong core support, technical assistance and resources\n\nA simple point to bring out that could go anywhere in this paper - these institutes achieved economies of scale by sharing resources between labs, and funded people at a high level. This allowed small labs to act as big labs, getting around a major problem with science in Universities in that small labs cannot afford top equipment. We expand on this in a footnote103.\n\nThe relative focus of the labs made this sharing of resources possible, as they were using similar tools and techniques across groups.\n\nConsequently and relatedly, the institutes were also all involved in methods development, recognising the multiplicative benefits of new technologies. We cannot be certain but suspect this is due to them having a focus on one area, having many groups focussed on a topic allowed them to see the ‘arc’ of the subject and overview where new techniques were needed and cost-share/collaborate to make it happen. Methods development in University departments, especially with government funding, is very difficult to organise, due to lack of core support and due to funding agencies not funding it (the NIH will essentially not fund pure methods research). This suggests a niche as methods are highly influential.\n\nA point picked up in paper 2 is that as science has become more method intensive, it has responded by lengthening career paths with scientists expected to be experts in all areas. This is an area where basic science should learn from industry and allow technical support. See, for example, ‘the case for scientific consulting in neuroscience’ by MIT-based researcher Jakob Voigts.\n\nA brief summary\n\nIn the first two sections of this part of the paper, it has been argued that Bell/PARC/LMB labs differed from Universities in two critical ways:\n\nThey were fully internally funded ecosystems focussed upon a research vision, which allowed critical mass to build.\n\nThey had minimal bureaucracy and management, instead simply focussing on selecting the best researchers available and letting them pursue their own interests (people not projects). This is in contrast to the University system, where researchers must apply individually for each project funded, and must appeal to collective approval for funding by peers, driving conformity, risk-aversion and herding.\n\nTo close out this section, imagine if Bell Labs researchers had to apply to corporate HQ for each crazy yet revolutionary idea they had? It wouldn’t have happened, and that's modern academia. Instead, we should allow researchers to be exceptional autonomous decision makers.\n\n3. Organise as self-organising start-up style small teams, not hierarchical bureaucracies\n\nThe final thematic difference: the relative weighting of power in the hands of junior researchers vs senior supervisors differed strongly at Bell/LMB/PARC (pro-junior researchers) compared to the University system (pro-senior supervisors). Rather than existing in large, fixed, tenured lab structures, the organisations were instead self-organising, composed of flexible small groups without entrenched top-down leadership.\n\nAge balance in research societies: balancing youthful ignorance and senior wisdom\n\nThe great disruptive discoveries in history come predominantly either from people under the age of 40 or from outsiders to the field104. In contrast to its lack of acknowledgement in science funding establishments, the view that scientist’s peak in the first half of their career has been clearly expressed by many of history’s greatest scientists including Einstein, Shannon, Watson, Newton, Brenner, Cajal etc105. One does not need to agree completely with this statement to accept that we need to consider the balance of power across age in research. We at least need balance between stages.\n\nAn interesting mini-study from the start-up world by Brian Timar106. He took 33 major companies (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Walmart, Tesla etc) and plotted the age of the founders:\n\nThe median and mean age of founders of the 33 most important companies(arbitrarily chosen) were both around 30.\n\nIn contrast to a cult of youth and start-ups in silicon valley, the power structure in academia is against newcomers/outsiders/disruptors and in favour of existing ‘expertise’107. The Professorial system is inherently hierarchical and based on people being ‘experts’ in the field, which has benefits for teaching108. Yet for innovative research this knowledge, and also age itself, may not be a clear advantage.\n\nTo have an innovative society, you need a strong bottom up force of a) new ideas and b) empowered eccentric thinkers who question the mainstream view and can act on this questioning.\n\nEven putting aside other changes with age109, there is tremendous value in ignorance in research110:\n\n“I strongly believe that the only way to encourage innovation is to give it to the young. The young have a great advantage in that they are ignorant. Because I think ignorance in science is very important. If you’re like me and you know too much you can’t try new things. I always work in fields of which I’m totally ignorant.”\n\nSydney Brenner, pioneer of molecular biology\n\nThe eyes of children can see things that adults cannot.\n\nThose who have built the current view of science are also unlikely to tear down their own work, as Santiago Ramon Y Cajal wrote:\n\n‘Two phases may often be noted in the careers of learned investigators. First there is the productive time devoted to the elimination of past errors and the illumination of new data, and it is followed by the mature or intellectual phase (which does not necessarily coincide with old age) when scientific productivity declines and the hypotheses incubated during youth are defended with paternal affection from the attacks of newcomers. Throughout history, no great man has shunned titles or failed to extol his right to glory before the new generation. Rousseau’s bitter quote is sad but true: “There has never been a wise man who hasn’t failed to prefer the lie invented by himself to the truth discovered by someone else.’”111\n\nRamon Y Cajal, Nobel Laureate, viewed as founder of modern neuroscience. (see footnote for a similar quote from James Watson - ‘‘more bricks into an edifice that already has enough rooms’112).\n\nThis system blocks the Newtons and Einsteins of the world from breaking through against the prior paradigm113. A recent example from a talk by Geoffrey Hinton “‘a CVPR reviewer reject..[ed] Yann LeCun’s paper even though it beat… the state of the art. The reviewer said it…[told] us nothing114 about computer vision because everything … [was] learned.”115 (the subsequent AI advances came in learning).\n\nThis suggests that we should be mindful of the ages and seniority of people who hold power in a scientific system, ensuring that the young maintain an ability to be independent and disrupt. Given it would run contrary to established power, it may be an area where ‘the Haldane principle’ cannot apply (that is, government must intervene over senior scientist’s wishes). Rather, this requires deliberate system intervention against the interests of the powerful, like antitrust regulation.\n\nRelatedly, recent increases in the cost of techniques and methods have meant that the powerful can prop up their pet hypothesis with technical power whilst the young cannot afford to compete, relegating new PIs to third tier journals or to engaging in unethical practices.\n\nFlatten the hierarchy: positive feedback in academic power and “The slavery of graduate students”\n\nRather than promoting dissenting views, quite the opposite is actually occurring. There is consistent long-term drift in the direction of power toward the more senior in bureaucracies, as rules are by definition made by those in power and the young face pressure to be sycophantic to the old. There has been essentially no push back against this in academia.\n\nThe ratio of senior/junior power is now very imbalanced in favour of seniority, and worsening, which alone justifies creating a parallel system. Risk-averse funding agencies generally fund prestige not promise which favours seniors, creating a strong positive feedback loop on prior success over time (see Yudkowsky 116). Another related issue is that even if you find a brilliant young lab head to work for, they will not be able to give you the glitzy letter of recommendation you need or the oil to get the paper past the custodians of Nature as needed for promotion.\n\nYoung scientists now exist as the bottom layer in a virtual pyramid scheme, ‘training’ for permanent positions that barely exist (Ben Barres, Stanford, write that perhaps 10% of postdocs get lab head jobs in the US, which matches similar estimates117). Sydney Brenner highlights this:\n\n'Today the Americans have developed a new culture in science based on the slavery of graduate student"
