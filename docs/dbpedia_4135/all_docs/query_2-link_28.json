        "text": "What is the next step in finding out about nature?\n\nWhat we have now is the effect of enormous capacity to obtain sequence information plus all this insane sort of rise of what’s called omics science, such as genomics, proteomics. In other words, more is better, make multiple observations, and this spirit in science is that in order to do science you just have to make a lot of observations. The idea is to create a computer program, which will tell you the answer.\n\nTo which question?\n\nThat’s the problem; there is no question. The data generate the answer. I think this is rubbish. This is a modern period. It’s the great Baconian view of science, of biological science; the journals are full of papers full of stuff of so-called emerging phenomena. Our great task here is, our ultimate task is, to be able to simulate biological activity that has a theoretical model, and then you can compute what happens. Nobody can compute it at the moment. Our task is to solve how to convert data into knowledge. Knowledge will imply that old thing, causal relationships. You can’t understand how twenty thousand genes work in a single cell by simply categorizing them, by simply saying that these genes are involved in energy production and these genes are involved in something else. The cell must have its own grammar, which is not what you impose on it. People are trying to do this, but we are still very far from doing this. What we now have to do is basically what I call computational or theoretical biology, and we even have a task before that, which I call pre-computational biology, which is to find the correct level of abstraction. In this correct level of abstraction should be embedded the correct level of analysis and description.\n\nLet me give you one example. Many people say that this is going to be all these proteins interacting with each other and we’ll have to calculate these interactions. The question is this, Is this going to be a whole set of partial differential equations in order to find out how does the thing work in fact? We can, by demonstration, simply show that many of the systems proposed would not be stable enough because if you only have one good gene and one bad one, you still can be apparently normal. We know that with one good gene we only make half of the products and it does not regulate. So the system must be robust; the system must not be sensitive to changes of concentration of twofold. There have to be ways around that. Otherwise we should fall apart instantly.\n\nThe ways around it are the following. Roughly speaking, there are two levels of protein interaction, which I call strong and weak. The strong interaction is that no protein or hardly any, protein or polypeptide chain, act alone. Most of the proteins inside of a cell form assemblages, complexes, they form little machines, what I call gadgets, devices. It is the device, which works. These devices can have as many as 65 different genes to contribute to that. Usually it is of the order of ten. The argument is as follows. Once you understand how a given device works, then you can begin to compute the output, and you can then condense that into one object. For example, there is a device, which can be analyzed in detail and essentially what it does is that it takes away cyclic AMP [adenosine 3′,5′-phosphate], converts it into a pulse, and through a lot of machinery, it converts it into a pulse of calcium. When we understand how all that is set by the detailed properties of the components, by the affinity constants of an enzyme, how it can also be set by the local diffusion constants, and so on, and once we have that, we can place all this information in a form and we can compute the response of the object. Someone can then say that I put this drug on this receptor, and the receptor, which is another piece of machinery, generates so much cyclic AMP, I can eventually compute what the effect of the drug would be on, let us say, the contraction of the heart muscle. I don’t have to think that there is a lot of kinetic equations to influence the outcome because what you find is that in biology things are done by counting. It has to be done by counting because of the characteristics of the nature of the interactions. Nobody has actually sat down and analyzed it in this detail. I’m just giving you a glimpse of this. That’s what I’m working on now. Once you do this, you can have a framework for dealing with all this information.\n\nIsn’t it becoming exceedingly complex?\n\nIt has taken about a billion years or more to evolve a human being; you can’t expect to do it in a weekend.\n\nHow will we cope with it?\n\nWe’ll cope with it by simple things; otherwise, the biological system itself could not cope with it unless it’s simplified in some way. My view of complexity is that we’ve added to this because the actual elementary phenomena have to be simple or else the thing would just break down. What we’ve got to do is to find, if you like, the principle of natural engineering; we impose too much on them the concept of designed objects, which we design, the machines that we design. That’s wrong because all the systems have different properties; they’ve got to evolve, that’s one of the cardinal things and therefore we must discard our preconceptions of artificial engineering, which is what we do, and start to think in natural engineering. Let me give you one example. If you take insulin and look at its interaction with its receptor, that interaction is irreversible. It has such a high affinity constant, essentially there is no dissociation constant. So how do you measure the amount of insulin inside your blood without having a dissociation constant?\n\nSo in any way you measure it, it is the following. Each interaction is converted through some machinery, which we can specify, into an activated receptor, which essentially has tyrosines phosphorylated. There’s an immediate explanation for why a receptor is always a dimer. It is because a dimer is a closed thing; it is a handshake model. I activate you, you activate me, end of story. I am both the substrate and the enzyme. That means that you are counting molecules of insulin, you are counting collisions, because from every collision you will convert that into an activated receptor. The number of activated receptors can be converted into a linear rate of production of a small molecule simply by having enzymes that make the small molecule bound to the receptor and be activated there; you convert the count to the product. This is a whole bit of machinery and there are dozens of examples where things are done by counting and not by classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, like normal enzymes do. You count so many molecules converted to this.\n\nYou can now see that this can make it essentially concentration-independent because you have only half of the amount of protein or you introduce a change in the induction period, but the output, provided it’s not saturated, remains the same. This system is very much buffered against fluctuations in the concentrations of the actual molecules participating, which does this essentially by counting. Once I just sketched the data in, but now there is an enormous simplification because we can simply say, this transforms into this and this transforms into that, and we have many such things. Sometimes we can convert the front levels of concentrations into frequencies of pulses. It might be easier for a cell rather than measuring 10 % change in a concentration, which, as you know, is very difficult to make a discrimination like this, to measure the difference between ten and eleven pulses in a fixed amount of time. Understanding the nature of signaling inside the cells immediately gives you a means of simplifying it. That’s the answer to not to be defeated by complexity. A lot of the complexity is something we can’t think about. We can’t think about twenty thousand things going one and the same time, but the cell has means of making this difference.\n\nI’ve written a paper on this and I once explained it to Gödel, about the act of center of enzymes, the fact that enzymes and products can coexist in the same cell in solution. In other words, you don’t have to send the product through a pipe to the next enzyme at the scale of bacterium collisions. Of course, collisions are highly frequent events, so that basically at most of the time a molecule is hitting the wrong protein and most of the time it hits the right one it hits at the wrong place. But all other things are ignored and the system has not to worry about anything. When I told about this to Gödel, he looked at me and he said, “That is the end of vitalism.” It was an interesting remark."
