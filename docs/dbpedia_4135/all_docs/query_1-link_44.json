Completion of a draft of the project, which involved sequencing the three billion letters in human DNA, was announced in 2000 by President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. One-third of the mapping was done at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, England, where Sulston was director.\n\nSulston had come to the institute in 1992 from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, where he began work in the late 1960s mapping the cell lineage and genetic structure of the tiny nematode worm, C. elegans, which had only 100 million bases in its genetic code. The project became his life's work, and the MRC eventually collaborated with scientists at Washington University in the United States on mapping the genome of this tiny creature, which would serve as a model for the Human Genome Project. One of Sulston's most significant findings in the nine-year C. elegans project was that certain of the worm's cells die by programmed cell death, and he showed the first mutation of a gene, the nuc-1 gene, that participates in this cell death. His discovery has had numerous implications in the cure of human diseases—for example, as in stimulating the death of cancer cells. The sequencing of the nematode genome was completed in 1998; it was the first animal genome to be sequenced.\n\nIn 1987, Sulston was invited to a conference in the United States to give an estimate of the cost of a project that would sequence the human genome. The Human Genome Project was established by the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1990, with a target completion date of 2005. However, the U.S.-British project became complicated by the quest for patents and profits, despite the will of Sulston and many colleagues that the human genome sequence be offered as public information, as the natural heritage of all people.\n\nIn his book The Common Thread: A Story of Science, Politics, Ethics, and the Human Genome, written with the assistance of science writer Georgina Ferry, Sulston tells the story of his work with the nematode project and then as director of human genome research at Wellcome Trust Sanger. He details the competition between the public project and American scientist Craig Venter and his privately funded company, Celera Genomics, as Venter raced to beat the international researchers and establish commercial control over the human genome sequence. Sulston and his fellow researchers placed their information on publicly available databases as it was ready, for companies worldwide that could use the information to develop treatments and cures for human illnesses, but they insisted that the sequence itself remain unpatentable. Venter pledged to finish the genome sequencing project by 2001 and sell his version to drug companies. He suggested that the government-funded researchers map the genome of the laboratory mouse instead. The research \"war\" was settled by the U.S. Congress when it allocated funding for the project. Under political pressure, both Venter and the international group put together what research they had completed and presented it to Congress, which then announced the completed \"draft.\"\n\nIn a review for the Lancet, Virginia Barbour wrote, \"In a gripping chapter, Sulston lays out the events that, in 1999-2000, almost broke the nerve of the HGP leaders, especially those in the USA, who were under pressure not to criticise what was by then a successful US company.… The Common Thread gives a startling insight into why this hype, rather than the science, dominated the sequencing of the human genome.\"\n\nSulston's book, said Robin McKie, in a review for the London Observer, \"makes surprisingly angry reading, with most venom being reserved for [Venter].\" In the review's headline, McKie referred to Sulston as \"The Jedi Knight of DNA.\" Mary Chitty, in a review for Library Journal, praised the book as \"a firsthand account of the excitement, hard work, vision, and dating\" involved in Sulston's work with worm biology and then the human genome.\n\nEd Regis, in the New York Times Book Review, wrote, \"This is a story in which nobody comes off looking good. Some of the world's top molecular biologists are shown plotting to deny Venter and Celera an early conquest of the genome. Sulston himself exhibits a meanspirited streak when he … [declines] to give Venter some data he had requested.\" Robert Macfarlane, of the Spectator, called the book \"rather tedious\" and \"a rather pallid account\" of the story. He concluded, \"Sulston himself comes over as an immensely nice, modest and passionate man, and the bottom line is that he may have helped prevent the founding of the most powerful oligarchy ever seen. But he hasn't written a very good book.\"\n\nSteven Rose, in a review for the Guardian, commented that the first third of the book, about Sulston's nematode research, makes for \"heavy-going reading.\" But, he added, \"it all comes to life when we get to the decision to move from worms to humans,\" making the book \"unputdownable stuff, with the good guys and the bad guys clearly labeled.…an insider's story of one of the century's greatest technopolitical ventures.\" Lewis Dartnell, in a review for ScienceNet.org, called the book \"an intriguing look into the changing face of science, for better or worse.\"\n\nIn an interview for a press release by Don Powell, of the Sanger Institute, Sulston said, \"When results are shared freely amongst the biological community … scientists can move much more rapidly towards their goals.…Remember, this is only the start and we need dedicated people to translate the fundamental knowledge into real healthcare benefits.\"\n\nIn a speech given in 2001, quoted by Mark Henderson in an article for the London Times, Sulston summarized his feelings about the real success of the genome project when he said, \"The genome is not a Pandora's box—it is a genuine treasure chest. But to open it fully, we need to have a rethink, to bring the public with us. The process must be democratic. It cannot be every man for himself. This is our common genome, and we must make common cause.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAmerican Scientist, May-June, 2003, Dorothy Nelkin, \"Genome politics: An Insider's Story,\" p. 272.\n\nBritish Medical Journal, October 12, 2002, Lynn Eaton, \"Human Genome Pioneers Are Awarded Nobel Prize,\" p. 791.\n\nChemist & Druggist, October 19, 2002, \"2002 Nobel Prize Award,\" p. 34.\n\nChemistry and Industry, November 6, 2000, \"Innovation Awarded,\" p. 698.\n\nChoice, May, 2003, C.
