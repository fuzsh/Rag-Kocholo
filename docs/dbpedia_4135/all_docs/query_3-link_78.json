        "text": "From biotechnology and digital media to sustainable energy and cloud computing, almost everything today is somehow affected---and sometimes entirely reshaped---by scientific and technological advances.\n\nBy science in this article we mean the natural and engineering sciences (we thus exclude pure mathematics as well as the social sciences). Thus, in this article, we focus on scientists in the biological, medical, and physical sciences as well as those concerned with technology and especially computers.\n\nAs a society, we have come to take the fruits of science for granted, such as our use of computers, our access to running water and electricity, and our dependence on various forms of transportation and communication. But all such benefits follow from the discoveries and inventions of scientists as they pursue deep insights into the workings of nature and its materials.\n\nThis article focuses on the 50 most influential scientists alive today and their profound contributions to science. These are scientists who have invented the Internet and fiber optics, challenged AIDS and cancer, developed new drugs, and in general made crucial advances in medicine, genetics, astronomy, ecology, physics, and computer programming.\n\nIn referring to the scientists on this list as âinfluential,â this article attempts to gauge their influence on science as such. In other words, the scientists listed here are influential because of the groundbreaking scientific work they have done and its impact on the world.\n\nSome scientists are enormously influential as popularizers or culture critics or public intellectuals. In this respect, figures like Richard Dawkins and Lawrence Krauss, or Carl Sagan and Stephen Jay Gould a generation back, come to mind. The scientists on this list, however, are here because of their preeminence as scientists doing science.\n\nThe scientists described here are all creative and brilliant. Many of them are also unusual and interesting---colorful personalities that it would be a pleasure to know!\n\nAs you feast on the names and biographies of the scientists on this list, also check out our article \"The World's 50 Smartest Teenagers.\" Some of the most influential scientists in the future will be drawn from this list.\n\nThe Sheldrake-Sheremer Nature of Science Dialogue\n\nJoin us this summer as two world-renowned thinkers, Rupert Sheldrake and Michael Shermer, discuss and debate the nature of science!

Alain Aspect\n\nAlain Aspect holds the Augustin Fresnel Chair at the Institut d'Optique and is also a Professor at the Ãcole Polytechnique, both in Paris. He is also a member of the French Academy of Sciences and the French Academy of Technologies. A graduate of the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure de Cachan (ENS Cachan), Aspect passed the agrÃ©gation in physics in 1969 and received his master's degree from UniversitÃ© d'Orsay.\n\nIn 2013, on the 100th anniversary of Niels Bohr's pioneering atomic model, the Danish Society of Engineers, in collaboration with the Niels Bohr Institute and the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, awarded the Niels Bohr Medal to Aspect.\n\nAspect made his most crucial breakthroughs in quantum theory. In 2005, he was awarded the CSNR Gold Medal by settling a 70-year-old dispute between Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein over the basic understanding of quantum physics by demonstrating the fascinating phenomenon of entanglement (non-local instantaneous interactions between particles, which Einstein rejected for propagating physical influences faster than the speed of light). Aspect's work is foundational to the field of quantum computing.\n\nSome of his best-known experiments confirmed that âquantum entanglementâ for twinned photon pairs is irreconcilable with Einstein's worldview. These experiments measured two particles that were released at the same time and from the same source in opposite directions. The results were conclusive proof of entanglement.\n\nAspect continues his experiments, which are fundamental to our understanding of how everything in the world is interconnected. He is currently studying the localization of waves in solids using ultra-cold atoms.\n\nWeb resource: Alain Aspect's Home Page.\n\nAspect is also featured in our article \"50 People Who Deserve a Nobel Prize.\"\n\n***\n\n2. David Baltimore\n\nDavid Baltimore is currently Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology, where he served as president from 1997 to 2006. He also serves as the director of the Joint Center for Translational Medicine, which joins Caltech and UCLA in a program to translate basic science discoveries into clinical realities.\n\nBaltimore is a graduate of Swarthmore College and Rockefeller University. In 2004, Rockefeller University gave Baltimore an honorary Doctor of Science.\n\nIn 1975, at the young age of 38, David Baltimore received the Nobel Prize, along with Howard Temin and Renato Dulbecco. They were awarded the prize for their discoveries concerning the interaction between tumor viruses and the genetic material of the cell. One of Baltimore's most significant contributions was in virology, for his discovery of the protein reverse transcriptase, essential for the reproduction of retroviruses such as HIV.\n\nIn 1999, President Bill Clinton awarded Baltimore the National Medal of Science for his prodigious contributions to science. He has had a profound influence on national science policy, spanning everything from stem cell research to cloning to AIDS.\n\nBaltimore is past president and chair of the American Association of the Advancement of Science (2007--2009). He was recently named a Fellow of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR).\n\nBaltimore has published 680 peer-reviewed articles. His recent research focuses on the control of inflammatory and immune responses, on the roles of microRNAs in the immune system, and the use of gene therapy methods to treat HIV and cancer.\n\nHe is also a member of numerous scientific advisory boards, including the Broad Institute, Ragon Institute, Regulus Therapeutics, and Immune Design.\n\nWeb resource: David Baltimore's Home Page.\n\n***\n\n3. Allen J. Bard\n\nAllen J. Bard is a professor at the University of Texas, where he also serves as director of the Center for Electrochemistry and holds the Norman Hackerman-Welch Regents Chair. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1958.\n\nIn 2011, Bard was awarded the National Medal of Science for his contributions in electrochemistry, including electroluminescence, semiconductor photo-electrochemistry, electro-analytical chemistry, and the invention of the scanning electrochemical microscope. His discovery of electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) has enabled the medical community to detect the HIV virus and analyze DNA.\n\nBard is considered the âfather of modern electrochemistry.â In 2013, President Obama awarded Bard with the National Medal of Science. Other awards he has received include the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 2008, the Priestley Medal in 2002, and the Fellow of American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990.\n\nHe has published three books: Electrochemical Methods, with Larry Faulkner, Integrated Chemical Systems, and Chemical Equilibrium. He has also published over 600 papers and chapters, while editing the series Electroanalytical Chemistry (21 volumes) and the Encyclopedia of the Electrochemistry of the Elements (16 volumes). He is currently editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\n\nBard's current research focuses on harnessing the power of natural sunlight to produce sustainable energy. His lab at the University of Texas tests different chemical compounds in the hopes of discovering a material that will carry out artificial photosynthesis. Bard feels strongly that such discoveries must be sought and made because otherwise humanity will be in deep trouble as fossil fuels run out.\n\nWeb resource: Allen J. Bard's Home Page.\n\nBard is also featured in our article \"50 People Who Deserve a Nobel Prize.\"\n\n***\n\n4. Timothy Berners-Lee\n\nTimothy Berners-Lee is a computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He was honored as the \"Inventor of the World Wide Web\" during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. In 2009, he was elected as a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences. And in 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work.\n\nBerners-Lee graduated from Queens College, Oxford. He worked as an independent contractor at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) from June to December 1980. While there, he proposed using hypertext to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. Over a decade later, he built the first website at CERN, and it was first put online in August of 1991.\n\nIn November 2009, Berners-Lee launched the World Wide Web Foundation âto tackle the fundamental obstacles to realizing his vision of an open Web available, usable, and valuable for everyone.â In 2013, the Alliance for Affordable Internet was launched, and Berners-Lee is leading the coalition of public and private organizations, including Google, Facebook, Intel, and Microsoft.\n\nIn 2013, Berners-Lee was one of five Internet and Web pioneers awarded the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. He was also awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of St. Andrews. And in 2012, Berners-Lee was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.\n\nWeb resource: Timothy Berners-Lee's Home Page.\n\n***\n\n5. John Tyler Bonner\n\nJohn Tyler Bonner is one of the world's leading biologists, primarily known for his work in the use of cellular slime molds to understand evolution. He has led the way in making Dictyostelium discoideum a model organism central to examining some of the major questions in experimental biology. He is the George M. Moffett Professor Emeritus of Biology in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University.\n\nBonner studied at Harvard University. His Ph.D. studies were interrupted by a stint in the United States Army Air Corps, so he completed his studies in an unusually short period of time. He soon joined the faculty of Princeton University. He holds three honorary doctorates and is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was made a National Academy of Sciences fellow in 1973.\n\nSome of his works include: The Cellular Slime Molds, The Evolution of Culture in Animals, Life Cycles, and The Ideas of Biology. Bonner's work argues for the underappreciated role that randomness, or chance, plays in evolution. In one of his latest works, Randomness in Evolution, Bonner shows how the effects of randomness differ for organisms of different sizes, and how the smaller an organism is, the more likely it is that morphological differences will be random and selection may not be involved to any significant degree.\n\nHe also discusses how sexual cycles vary depending on size and complexity, and how the trend away from randomness in higher forms has even been reversed in some social organisms. Bonner's present research interests include experiments designed to understand how this reversal is achieved in a number of species that vary morphologically.\n\nWeb resource: John Tyler Bonner's Home Page.\n\n***\n\n6. Dennis Bray\n\nDennis Bray is a professor emeritus in the Department of Physiology, Development, and Neuroscience at the University of Cambridge. He was trained as a biochemist at MIT and a neurobiologist at Harvard Medical School before returning to the UK, where he had a long research career in the fields of nerve growth and cell motility.\n\nBray has authored numerous textbooks on molecular and cell biology such as Molecular Biology of the Cell and Cell Movements. His most recent book, Wetware, is for a general audience. In it, Bray taps the findings of the new discipline of systems biology to show that the internal chemistry of living cells constitutes a form of computation. In the book he argues that the computational power of cells provides the basis of all the distinctive properties of living systems, allowing organisms to embody in their internal structure an image of the world, which accounts for their adaptability, responsiveness, and intelligence.\n\nBray received the Microsoft European Science Award for his work on chemotaxis in E. coli. He used detailed computer simulations, tied to experimental data, to ask how the macromolecular pathway controlling cell motility in bacteria works as an integrated unit. His team found that the physical location of molecular components within the molecular jungle of the cell interior is crucial to understand their function.\n\nBray's most recent work includes the propagation of allosteric states in large multi-protein complexes. He has also recently published several more popular articles, including a contribution to a 2012 Alan Turing centenary symposium in Nature entitled âIs the Brain a Good Model for Machine Intelligence?,â as well as an essay entitled âBrain versus Machineâ in the collection Singularity Hypotheses: A Scientific and Philosophical Assessment.\n\nWeb resource: Dennis Bray's Home Page.\n\n***\n\n7. Sydney Brenner\n\nSydney Brenner is a biologist and the winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, shared with H. Robert Horvitz and John Sulston. His major contributions are in elucidating the genetic code. Brenner is the Senior Distinguished Fellow of the Crick-Jacobs Center at the Salk Institute of Biological Sciences.\n\nAmong his many notable discoveries, Brenner established the existence of messenger RNA and demonstrated how the order of amino acids in proteins is determined. Beginning in 1965, he also began to conduct the pioneering work with the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, which ultimately led to his Nobel Prize. In this research, he laid the groundwork to make C. elegans---a small, transparent nematode (worm)---a major model organism for research in genetics, neurobiology, and developmental biology.\n\nBrenner, along with George Pieczenik, created the first computer matrix analysis of nucleic acids using the TRAC computer language, which Brenner continues to use. They returned to their early work on deciphering the genetic code with a speculative paper on the origin of protein synthesis, where constraints on mRNA and tRNA co-evolved, allowing for a five-base interaction with a flip of the anticodon loop, and thereby creating a triplet code translating system without requiring a ribosome. This is the only published paper in scientific history with three independent Nobel laureates collaborating as authors (the other two were Francis Crick and Aaron Klug).\n\nBrenner has been awarded the Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences, the Albert Lasker Medical Research Award in 1971, and ultimately the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2002.\n\nMost recently, Brenner is studying vertebrate gene and genome evolution. His work in this area has resulted in new ways of analyzing gene sequences, which have developed into a new understanding of the evolution of vertebrates.\n\nWeb resource: Sydney Brenner's Home Page.\n\n***\n\n8.

Conway Morris's views on the Burgess Shale are reported in numerous technical papers, and have been recounted for a more general audience in Stephen Jay Gould's Wonderful Life and in Conway Morris's own book, The Crucible of Creation.\n\nThe Burgess Shale Formation, located in the Canadian Rockies of British Columbia, is one of the world's most productive fossil fields, famous for the exceptional preservation of the soft parts of its fossils. At 505 million years old, it is one of the earliest fossil beds containing soft-part imprints.\n\nAs a paleobiologist, Conway Morris is known for being a devout Christian, one who tries to show that the evidence from paleobiology and evolution supports the existence of God. He is an increasingly active participant in discussions relating to science and religion. He is active in the Faraday Institute for Science and Religion and has lectured there on \"Evolution and Fine-Tuning in Biology.\" In 2007, Conway Morris was invited to give the prestigious Gifford Lectures at University of Edinburgh; they were titled \"Darwin's Compass: How Evolution Discovers the Song of Creation.\" In these lectures Conway Morris makes several claims that evolution is compatible with belief in the existence of a God.\n\nSome of his awards include Texas A&M's Trotter Prize in 2007, the GSL Charles Lyell Medal in 1998, and the Paleontological Society's Charles Schuchert Award in 1989. In recent years, Conway Morris has been studying evolutionary convergence---the phenomenon whereby unrelated groups of animals and plants develop similar adaptations---the main thesis of which is put forward in his popular Life's Solution: Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe.\n\nWeb resource: Simon Conway Morris's Home Page.\n\n***\n\n10.

Alan Guth\n\nAlan Guth is a theoretical physicist and cosmologist, who currently serves as the Victor Weisskopf Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nGuth is the originator of the inflationary cosmology, a theory of the universe that answers the conundrum posed by the Big Bang of why the universe appears flat, homogeneous, and isotropic, when one would expect (on the basis of the physics of the Big Bang) a highly curved, heterogeneous, and anisotropic universe. His theory, if correct, would explain the origin of the large-scale structure of the cosmos.\n\nGuth's first step to developing his theory of inflation occurred at Cornell in 1978, when he attended a lecture by Robert Dicke about the flatness problem of the universe. Dicke explained how the flatness problem showed that something significant was missing from the Big Bang theory at the time. Guth first made public his ideas on inflation at a seminar in 1980 after he submitted his paper, titled \"The Inflationary Universe: A Possible Solution to the Horizon and Flatness Problems,\" to the journal Physical Review.\n\nIn 1997, Guth authored the book The Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins. In 2012, he was awarded the Fundamental Physics Prize.\n\nMuch of Guth's current work concerns the density fluctuations arising from inflation, such as the implications of novel forms of inflation and whether the underlying theory can be made more rigorous. Guth is also interested in pursuing the possibility of inflation in \"brane world\" models, which propose that our universe is a four-dimensional membrane floating in a higher-dimensional space.\n\nWeb resource: Alan Guth's Home Page.\n\nGuth is also featured in our article \"50 People Who Deserve a Nobel Prize.\"\n\n***\n\n19. Lene Vestergaard Hau\n\nLene Vestergaard Hau is the Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and Applied Physics at Harvard University. One of her well-known achievements is using a superfluid to slow a beam of light to a standstill. This work led to further experiments on the transfer of light to matter, then from matter back into light, which led to important implications for quantum encryption and quantum computing.\n\nHau and her associates at Harvard University have demonstrated exquisite control over light and matter in several experiments, but her experiment with two condensates is one of the most compelling. In 2006, they successfully transferred a qubit from light to a matter wave and back into light, using Bose-Einstein condensates. While the matter is traveling between the two Bose-Einstein condensates, it can be trapped for minutes, then reshaped into something else. This novel form of quantum control has implications for the developing fields of quantum information processing and quantum cryptography.\n\nDuring her doctoral studies in quantum theory at the University of Aarhus in Denmark, Hau worked on ideas similar to those involved in fiber optic cables carrying light, but her work involved strings of atoms in a silicon crystal carrying electrons.\n\nHau's latest research has continued to be centered on cold atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates. Her group uses laser cooling to efficiently precool atoms to temperatures in the micro-kelvin range. Recently, the Hau group succeeded in reducing the light speed---initially to 17 meters per second, and later to almost zero m.p.s.---by optically inducing quantum interference in a Bose-Einstein condensate.\n\nUltra-slow light creates a unique new tool for probing the fundamental properties of Bose-Einstein condensates.\n\nWeb resource: Lene Vestergaard Hau's Home Page.\n\nHau is also featured in our article \"50 People Who Deserve a Nobel Prize.\"\n\n***\n\n20.

He is the Director of Research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at Cambridge and former Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.\n\nHawking is known for his work on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called \"Hawking radiation.\"\n\nHawking attended Oxford University as an undergraduate, and then Cambridge University for his graduate studies. When Hawking began his graduate studies, there was much debate in the physics community about the prevailing theories of the creation of the universe. Inspired by Roger Penrose's theorem of a spacetime singularity in the center of black holes, Hawking applied the same thinking to the entire universe, and during 1965 he wrote his thesis on this topic. The thesis made a seminal contribution to Big Bang cosmology.\n\nHe has authored several popular science publications on cosmology, including A Brief History of Time, which remained on the best-seller list of the British Sunday Times for 237 weeks, and The Universe in a Nutshell. He recently published My Brief History, which is about his journey from a post-war London boy to his years of international acclaim and celebrity.\n\nHawking, who has suffered for many years from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease), has received numerous awards, including the Special Fundamental Physics Prize in 2012, the Copley Medal in 2006, and the Albert Einstein Award in 1978.\n\nRead more about Stephen Hawking in our article The 50 Greatest Living Geniuses.\n\nWeb resource: Stephen Hawking's Home Page.\n\n***\n\n21. Peter Higgs\n\nPeter Higgs is a theoretical physicist and emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh. He is best known for his work in the 1960s on a theory now known as the \"Higgs mechanism,\" which predicted the existence of the Higgs boson (sometimes popularly called the \"God particle\"), and which is generally accepted as a crucial element in the Standard Model of particle physics. According to the Standard Model, the Higgs mechanism is the means by which the fundamental particles of the Standard Model acquire their individual masses.\n\nThe existence of the Higgs boson was experimentally confirmed in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva, Switzerland. As a result of this experimental verification of his 40-year-old prediction, the following year (2o13) Higgs was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics (shared with FranÃ§ois Englert).\n\nThe discovery of the Higgs boson validated the last untested area of the Standard Model's approach to fundamental particles and forces, and now inspires physicists to probe for still deeper theories and discoveries in particle physics.\n\nHiggs studied for his doctorate in molecular physics at King's College London, where he wrote his thesis on problems in the theory of molecular vibrations. He has served as chair of Theoretical Physics at Edinburgh, is a Fellow of the Royal Society, was awarded the Rutherford Medal and Prize in 1984, and became a Fellow of the Institute of Physics in 1991. He retired in 1996, when he became an emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh. In 2012, Edinburgh University established the Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics to be housed in the university's School of Physics and Astronomy.\n\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013, Higgs has earned many other awards, such as the Sakurai Prize in 2010, the Wolf Prize in Physics in 2004, and the Dirac Medal in 1997.\n\nWeb resource: Peter Higgs's Home Page.\n\n***\n\n22.

Not only did these instruments help to decipher biological information, they also introduced the concept of high-throughput data accumulation through automation and parallelization of protein and DNA chemistries.\n\nIn 2000, Hood participated in founding the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB), a nonprofit, biomedical research organization based in Seattle, Washington. The ISB was established to integrate biology, technology, and computation to create a new approach to the study of biological systems from an integrated or whole-system perspective.\n\nOne of the signature projects of Hood's own research group within the ISB is the \"predictive, personalized, preventive, and participatory\" (\"P4\") approach to medicine.\n\nHood has received several notable awards, including the National Medal of Science in 2011, the Heinz Award in 2006, and the Albert Lasker Award in 1987, among others.\n\nWeb resource: The Institute for Systems Biology.\n\nHood is also featured in our article \"50 People Who Deserve a Nobel Prize.\"\n\n***\n\n23.

He once told a New York Times interviewer that âfor good people to do evil things, that takes religion,â and his dislike of religion has only grown over the years.\n\nWeinberg has a large number of awards to his name, including the National Medal of Honor in 1991, the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Distinguished Achievements in Sciences from the American Philosophical Society in 2004, and the James Joyce Award in 2009, among many others.\n\nWeb resource: Steven Weinberg's Home Page.\n\n***\n\n47. George M. Whitesides\n\nGeorge M. Whitesides is a Professor of Chemistry at Harvard University. He is known for his work in a very wide variety of areas of chemistry, notably NMR spectroscopy, organometallic chemistry, soft lithography, micro-fabrication, microfluidics, nanotechnology, molecular self-assembly and self-organization, and research into the origin of life.\n\nWhitesides earned a Ph.D. in chemistry from the California Institute of Technology, where his graduate work focused on the use of NMR spectroscopy in organic chemistry. He is the author of more than 1,200 scientific articles and is listed as an inventor on more than 50 patents. He has also co-founded over 12 companies with a combined market capitalization of over $20 billion, including Genzyme, Theravance, Surface Logix, and WMR Biomedical.\n\nAmong Whitesides's many awards are the Dreyfus Prize in the Chemical Sciences in 2009, the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Chemistry in 2009, and the National Medal of Science in 1998. Whitesides has one of the highest Hirsch index rating of all living chemists, which measures both the productivity and impact of the published work of a scientist or scholar.\n\nWhitesides's current research interests continue to span a very wide array of fields, from cell-surface biochemistry to science for developing economies.\n\nWeb resource: George M. Whitesides's Home Page.\n\nWhitesides is also featured in our article \"50 People Who Deserve a Nobel Prize.\"\n\n***\n\n48. Edward O. Wilson\n\nEdward O. Wilson is a biologist and naturalist. His specialty is myrmecology---the study of ants---on which he is considered to be the world's leading authority. He was for many years the Joseph Pellegrino University Research Professor in Entomology for the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. Upon his retirement in 1996, he assumed the titles of Professor Emeritus and Honorary Curator in Entomology.\n\nWilson is also famous for his many popular books on evolutionary biology, for his advocacy of environmental causes (specially preserving biodiversity), and for his efforts to advance the secular humanist worldview. He is a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.\n\nWilson first tried to enlist in the United States Army, but he failed his Army medical examination due to his impaired eyesight. He completed his undergraduate education and later completed his Ph.D. in biology at Harvard University.\n\nIn 1975, Wilson entered the public eye through the controversy surrounding publication of his Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, a highly ambitious and equally controversial work on the genetic basis of cooperative or âsocialâ behavior in ants and other species, including humans.\n\nIn 1990, Wilson and co-author Bert HÃ¶lldobler published The Ants , a magisterial synthesis of Wilson's life's work on ant taxonomy, biology,and behavior. He and HÃ¶lldobler subsequently published several popular books on ants.\n\nIn addition to his work in myrmecology, Wilson has also authored a number of best-selling popular works on various aspects of biology and the philosophy of science, including On Human Nature, Biophilia and Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge. The latter was another controversial work which argued that the natural sciences are destined to replace the social sciences and even the humanities.\n\nWilson, who was raised in Alabama as a Southern Baptist, adheres to the philosophy of scientific humanism, which he sees as \"the only worldview compatible with science's growing knowledge of the real world and the laws of nature.\" He argues that it is best suited to improve the human condition.\n\nWilson has long taken a special interest in preserving endangered species. In 2005, he assisted in establishing a nonprofit, the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation, devoted to achieving this goal.\n\nWilson has been honored with countless awards, including the American Humanist Association's Humanist of the Year in 1999, Time magazine's 25 Most Influential People in America in 1995, and the Pulitzer Prize for The Ants in 1991.\n\nWeb resource: The E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation.\n\n***\n\n49. Edward Witten\n\nEdward Witten is a theoretical physicist and professor of mathematical physics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In 2004, Time magazine stated that Witten was widely thought to be the world's greatest living theoretical physicist.\n\nWitten earned his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University, but initially enrolled in applied mathematics. Witten then held a junior fellowship at Harvard University, and a few years later a MacArthur Foundation fellowship.\n\nWitten coined the term \"topological quantum field theory\" to denote a physical theory in which the expected values of observable quantities encode information about the topology of spacetime. He also discovered that Chern-Simons theory could provide a framework for understanding the mathematical theory of knots and 3-manifolds.\n\nWitten is best known for his fundamental mathematical insights into string theory. His finding that various string theories can be mapped onto one another by certain rules, called dualities, led to a flurry of work now known as the \"second superstring revolution.\"\n\nIn 1990 Witten became the first---and so far, the only---physicist to be awarded a Fields Medal by the International Mathematical Union, which is often viewed as the greatest honor a mathematician can receive, and has been described as âthe Nobel Prize of mathematics.\"\n\nWitten has also been awarded the National Medal of Science in 2002, among many other honors.\n\nWeb resource: Edward Witten's Home Page.\n\n***\n\n50. Shinya Yamanaka\n\nShinya Yamanaka is a physician and researcher who studies adult stem cells. He is Senior Investigator with the Gladstone Institutes, which are associated with the University of California-San Francisco. He also serves as Director of the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, and as a professor with the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences, at Kyoto University in Japan.\n\nYamanaka was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, along with John Gurdon, for their discovery that mature (adult) somatic cells can be converted into stem cells with regenerative properties (pluripotency) similar to those of embryonic stem cells.\n\nYamanaka, a native of Japan, received his Ph.D. from Osaka City University Graduate School, after which he conducted a residency in orthopedic surgery at National Osaka Hospital and a postdoctoral fellowship at the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease. He was an associate professor when he began the research that led him to the Nobel Prize. In addition to his present academic positions mentioned above, he also currently serves as President of the International Society for Stem Cell Research.\n\nYamanaka showed, for the first time, that an intact, differentiated (adult), somatic cell could be reprogrammed to become pluripotent, thus having unlimited powers to differentiate itself. This work opened up completely new lines of research, in the process bypassing much of the rancorous public debate surrounding research on embryonic stem cells.\n\nYamanaka's scientific discoveries were deemed so significant that he was recognized as a \"Person Who Mattered\" in the 2007 Person of the Year edition of Time magazine. He also was awarded the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for his work. In addition to these honors and the Nobel Prize, he has alsoreceived the Wolf Prize in Medicine in 2011, the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 2009, and the Meyenburg Cancer Research Award in 2007.\n\nWeb resource: Shinya Yamanaka's Home Page.\n\nLast Updated: November 01, 2019"
