        "text": "“You must meet Bob Horvitz,” Sir John Sulston told me, the first time we met. “He’s spent 30 years of his life studying the 22 cells of a worm’s vulva!” The truth, though, is that Sulston doesn’t think there is anything remotely silly about spending 30 years looking at a worm. In fact Sulston believes that when we understand those 22 worm cells, we will understand some of the fundamental mechanisms of biology - the secrets of life itself.\n\nThis week, the Nobel Prize committee agreed, awarding the 2002 prize for physiology and medicine to Sulston, Horvitz, and their former boss Sydney Brenner.\n\nSulston not only knows a lot about worms, but is responsible for sequencing a third of the human genome. For a man at the very top of his profession, he is also an extraordinarily nice guy: he has made few personal enemies on the way up, and remains astonishingly self-effacing. The contrast with Craig Venter, who ran a rival, private effort to sequence the human genome, could not be greater. Venter used his own DNA for the project, thus ensuring a kind of immortality as one of the standard reference humans against whom all others will have their DNA measured; Sulston used anonymous DNA from Addenbrooke’s hospital.\n\nBut Sulston’s career, from the worm to the human genome, is not just a personal triumph. It is also a triumph for old-fashioned pre-bureaucratic British science, and for the tradition of unassuming Oxbridge elitism which makes boasting almost as unforgivable as failure. Everything about his approach to science was shaped at the Medical Research Council (MRC) molecular biology unit at Cambridge: a place where tremendous achievements were produced in cramped and nondescript quarters. The three prizes won this week can be added to the nine won since 1945 by people who were given, on arrival, a yard of bench space in which to make their mark on the world. But though they had no room, they had all the equipment they could want. Even more valuably, they were given all the time they needed, and did not need to waste any of it on administration: Sulston had been 20 years a scientist before he had to write a grant application.\n\nSulston was born in 1942; his father was an army chaplain who became an administrator in an Anglican missionary society, and his mother was an English teacher. As a child, he loved to discover how things work, from Meccano to radio sets. He even repaired a broken-down television scrounged from a second-hand shop. He watched tiny animals under the microscope and dissected a dead bird: “I understood that living things were mechanisms,” he says.\n\nOddly enough, Sulston did not shine at university; he scraped a 2:1 in organic chemistry at Cambridge. He prepared to quit science, and go abroad to work for VSO, but that fell through. He wrote in his autobiography: “I wandered along to the chemistry labs, more or less on the rebound, and asked about becoming a research student. It was the 60s, a time of university expansion: the doors were open and a 2:1 was good enough to get me in. I couldn’t have done it now.”\n\nHe had stumbled into the work he loved. He found himself doing a PhD in the manufacture of nucleotides - the chemical chunks that carry information in DNA and RNA - and this mixture of intellectual excitement and practical problem-solving enthralled him. By the end of his doctorate he was no longer 2:1 material, but ready to be sent off to work with the best.\n\nAt the Salk Institute in California, Sulston moved back into the centre of the scientific world. Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, was there, and would drop in to the labs for conversation; but outside the labs, their way of life was high-minded bohemian: his wife Daphne was soon pregnant, so they lived quietly with their daughter Ingrid five miles from the labs, growing vegetables in the back garden and taking long drives around the country in their holidays. “It was a matter of not living lavishly but enjoying what you had, growing things with your hands, working hard, but not being tied to a nine-to-five job, and generally feeling that there’s more to life than money.”\n\nSeveral of his colleagues remember him arguing passionately in the 70s that it was absurd for scientists to be paid more than dustmen, because they had the inestimable privilege of loving their work. In a decade when it was almost impossible for molecular biologists not to make fortunes from their knowledge, Sulston conspicuously abstained. He has lived in the same house for decades and, even when he was running the vast and shiny human genome campus outside Cambridge, he would ride into work, and down to the pub of an evening, on an unflashy bicycle.\n\nIn 1969, Sulston returned home to work with Brenner. Brenner had worked closely with Crick since the late 50s, when they were tying to discover how the chemical Meccano kit of life can be read out from DNA. In 1969, he was working in Cambridge on the early stages of a project that seemed completely crazy: he wanted to disassemble a tiny hermaphrodite nematode into all its constituent genes, to find out how it grew from an egg, and then, once he had found out how the worm grew with all its nerves and muscles, to discover how its behaviour was wired into the nervous system. The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans does not seem very complicated: in fact it looks like a fragment of white cotton thread, about a millimetre long, and almost completely transparent. It eats nothing but bacteria and has neither blood nor brain. There are about 300 nerve cells, but only two of them are essential for life. It seems an unpromising animal for an intelligent man to devote 30 years of his life to. But for lovers of the worm, it became a lens through which the whole living world can be seen with the utmost clarity. “If we understand the worm, we understand life,” he says now: “Which of course we’re nowhere near.”\n\nWhen Sulston returned to Cambridge, the project consisted of Brenner with one other scientist and two technicians. But there was self-belief enough for an empire at the MRC: “You entered a society where people did feel that they were the best, it was just taken for granted.” He did some practical work: he was the first man to work out how to freeze worms without killing them, so that interesting mutants could be preserved for later study; and he made a preliminary estimate of the amount of DNA in a worm which turned out to be almost exactly right (it has about a thirtieth as much as a human being). Then he discovered a technique for freeze-drying worms in formaldehyde vapour, which would make some of the chemicals of the nervous system fluoresce, so that you could look at a the worm under the microscope and see which parts of it had been full of signal traffic when it died. But he did not seem destined for greatness.\n\nHis favourite toy is still on the filing cabinet in his office at the genome centre in Hinxton. It is an old green German microscope, fitted with special lenses that display the transparent interior surfaces of a worm as if they were a bas relief. It was with this that he carried out the work for which his prize was given. He was the first man to discover that you could actually watch the cells of a worm dividing and dying as it grew, partly because he was the first man to look for this.\n\nThe textbooks claimed that worms hatched with all the cells they would ever need; Sulston, patiently counting, discovered that one part of the newly-hatched larva had only 15 nerve cells, whereas the adult had 57. So he placed a larval worm on a little dab of bacteria so that it would not wriggle too far from food - for the worms are interested only in food and sex; since most of them are hermaphrodites, they don’t have to move to breed. Then he settled down to watch the innards of the transparent worm developing. Soon enough, 10 new nerve cells swam into his ken. He was so excited that he took the worm and microscope home, wanting to watch it develop all weekend, but in the small hours of the morning he realised he just could not stay awake any more. He popped the dish of worms in the fridge and resumed their study in the morning.\n\nBy the end of the weekend, he was able to tell his colleagues two things: that he had traced the development of the worm’s ventral nerve cord, and that the best place in the fridge for worms was just under the lettuce, in the vegetable cooler. He had also become the first man in history to trace in a living animal the ways in which cells move and sometimes die under instructions from their genes. This knowledge is fundamental to understanding cancers, as well as the normal growth of an animal; and the discoveries that followed from his observation have won him his share of the Nobel Prize.\n\nWithin two years, Sulston and two colleagues had mapped the lineage of every cell in the adult worm, so they could tell precisely how it grew from the moment of hatching. But it was the next stage of his labours that really made his name as a scientist and got him his Fellowship of the Royal Society. Because the worm is transparent, it is possible to watch the embryos as they grow inside transparent eggs. It is just fiendishly difficult. A German team had tried for years to capture it with the help of computers and high-speed video cameras. But they were getting nowhere, and in the early 80s Sulston decided to carry out by hand, with almost superhuman concentration, the task that had defeated the finest machines of the times. He mounted a gossamer cross-hair over the end of his microscope, placed a worm beneath, and watched the embryo developing inside it.\n\nIt took him 18 months hunched over the microscope in two four-hour shifts a day. But at the end he had tracked every cell that was born and died in the 14 hours that a worm’s egg is growing. It was work that demanded a level of detail and patience that had simply been thought impossible until Sulston did it. By choosing one cell at a time and watching it as it grew and divided, drawing the results in small, neat, coloured circles on paper beside the microscope, he made a complete map through time and space of the development of a worm. At every stage, the growth of the worm involved cells dividing or dying - just as it does in any living thing - and Sulston had mapped every single cell so he knew where it had come from and what it would change into. This could not be done, even in principle, with anything much more complex than the worm, because most animals change unpredictably as they grow or learn. But the worm is quite invariant. Every normal worm is an exact clone of every other one and grows in almost exactly the same way. This makes it an extraordinarily useful animal for scientists.\n\nIn the early 80s, when Sulston had finished the embryonic lineage of the worm, the techniques of gene sequencing were still in their infancy. People all over the world were sequencing individual genes, but it was a hugely laborious process that could take three months for a single gene, even if you knew where to start looking. Sulston decided to computerise the problem. Working with Alan Coulson, a British DNA specialist, he decided to make a physical map of the worm’s DNA. They first broke all the worm’s DNA into 17,000 overlapping fragments, all being grown inside bacteria. Then they had to identify all the different fragments and see how they overlapped. Sulston spent two years mostly writing the computer programs that made it possible; after that his job was a mixture of computers and exhortation as he got worm researchers around the world to contribute their fragments of DNA to a shared project that would benefit everyone. After a couple of years, they could see that the map would be completed.\n\nIn 1989, Sulston, Coulson, and their American collaborator Bob Waterston showed the progress of their map as a wallchart a yard long. They had always made a point of releasing all the data they got, so it wasn’t really novel; but like all the best news, their wallchart dramatised and made inescapable something people had only half understood.\n\nTheir wallchart caught the eye of Jim Watson, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, who was then running the human genome project in the US. It proved to him that Sulston and Waterston were the people to take the human genome project forward, because they had got further with their worm than any of the rival projects working on things like fruit flies.\n\nFrom then on, the fortunes of the worm and the human were intertwined, and serious politics and money entered the picture. At first things went quickly and informally. The news of the first British grant of £1m towards sequencing the worm reached Sulston as a hand-written fax from the Wellcome trust. But soon the commercial world moved in. In 1992 Sulston and Waterston were offered large sums of money by an American businessman named Rick Bourke to move to Seattle and work on the human genome. He planned to set up a $50m institute for sequencing; the money would be recovered with the profits form patenting their discoveries. He offered to let Sulston and Waterston continue with the worm in their spare time, but they could tell his heart wasn’t in it. And though they were ambitious for the human genome, they were serious about the worm as well. At this point, the Wellcome Trust, the immensely rich charity that funds almost all the science carried out in Britain today, stepped in with an offer of £50m. A little would fund the continuing worm research and most of it would build a huge new centre in the grounds of Hinxton Hall, outside Cambridge, where the British arm of the human genome project could be housed.\n\nWatson, who had urged the Wellcome Trust to do this, lost his job as a result after Bourke accused him of damaging American commercial interests. But when the excitement died down Sulston, as head of this new Sanger Centre, and Waterston, in St Louis, had become the joint champions of a publicly funded and publicly accessible assault on the human genome, conducted on both sides of the Atlantic simultaneously; and it was Sulston, 3,000 miles from US politics, who was freer to speak out for both of them. Their collaborative effort was in bitter competition to the private and patent-hungry approach of an American team under Venter. Sulston believes passionately that the information in genome sequences must be freely available and that it is wrong to patent human gene sequences, both morally and scientifically. It is morally wrong because human genes are discovered, and not invented, while a patent on a discovery blocks all inventions in that area. “If you patent a discovery which is unique, say, a human gene or even just one particular function of a human gene, then you are actually creating a monopoly and that’s not the purpose of the world of patents. Indeed, the purpose is to cause inventors to compete with each to get better products. So mousetraps are in one category, human genes are in the other!” says Sulston.\n\nFrom the earliest days of the worm project, it was obvious that the different lines of work increased each other’s value: Sulston’s studies of cell lineage would have been little use without the very detailed physical maps of the worm produced by other researchers. And within the genome, the naked sequence of DNA letters is only interesting when it is correlated with the knowledge produced by traditional genetics. There is no doubt that Sulston believes DNA patents are immoral. But he is just as keen to argue that they damage science - a value which scientists regard as objective and beyond dispute: “The origin of the pressure for public release is not in theoretical politics or anything, although it obviously fits with my general philosophy. But the key thing is that it was not a theoretical concept, it was a pragmatic way of moving forward. I think that’s pretty important to bear in mind.”\n\nFor all his disclaimers, it is still clear that he did something morally remarkable. He could have been like Venter, whose private foundation recently gave $100m to a sequencing project. He simply didn’t think the money was worth its cost. He plugged on without it, because he thought this was the only way to ensure that the results he got were the most scientifically interesting. Again, he could have ensured that there was not even the appearance of a race by keeping the publicly funded data under wraps until the sequence was complete. Instead, they released their results as they got them, a principle insisted on by Sulston, because this was the way to make them most useful most quickly to the scientists outside the project."
