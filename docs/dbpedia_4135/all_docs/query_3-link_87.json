        "text": "The Gairdner Foundation Lecture\n\nBy Nishat Karim\n\nRobert Horvitz, professor of biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nCars. When we want to drive them, we place the key in the ignition and we are merrily on our way. Usually we don't think about what goes on under the hood while we are driving unless, of course, something goes wrong.\n\nOur bodies are just the same. Just under our layers of skin lie the secrets to our body's success. As an uncountable number of cells and our organs do their work, we go about ours. Only when something seems wrong, do we notice.\n\nFor years now, Dr. Robert Horvitz, with a team of others, has studied what could be considered the nuts and bolts of the human body - its cells. These scientists have discovered that there is a genetic program for cell death - that is the death of cells is in fact a biological process.\n\nOn Oct. 19, 1999, Horvitz, a professor in the Department of Biology and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, spoke to an audience of students and faculty at York University about the wonders of programmed cell death. His lecture, Genetic Control of Programmed Cell Death, was held in the Senate Chamber where community members keenly listened to the information he had to share.\n\nAs part of the 40th Anniversary of the Gairdner Foundation International Awards, international scientist awardees such as Horvitz spoke in various centres across Canada, as well as at an international symposium in Toronto entitled Minds that Matter between Oct. 20 and 22.\n\nAs a Gairdner award recipient, Horvitz spoke about the process of cell death and the various studies done to prove that in fact our cells do not die sporadically, rather they are programmed to die. According to studies done in his laboratories, cell death is an active process with various stages involved and our genes are a part of this process. Horvitz went on to say that abnormalities in cell death - that is, too much or too little cell death within the body (if even one step in the process is altered), can lead to abnormalities in humans. Abnormalities such as certain forms of cancer, are generated due to a lack of cell death.\n\nAfter a detailed and informative discussion of genes and steps involved in programmed cell death, Horvitz took some time to privately answer questions. His knowledge, gained from years of experience, surely enlightened many minds - young and old.\n\nAs a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, he has served on many editorial boards, visiting committees and advisory committees and is currently a member of the Advisory Council of the National Center for Human Genome Research (NIH). Horvitz was president of the Genetics Society of America in 1995 and has received numerous awards for his accomplishments. He was elected to the US National Academy of Sciences and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology.\n\nNew Members of the York University Founders' Society\n\nBy Nishat Karim\n\nSix new members were inducted into the York University Founders' Society this Fall, five during the Fall Convocation ceremonies on Nov. 5 and 6.\n\nHartwell Bowsfield joined the Department of History at York in July 1970 and served as the first archivist of the University. York is very grateful to Bowsfield - a scholar, teacher, historian and builder whose work as University archivist continues to serve York's community of students, staff and faculty. It is largely because of his work that we have a complete record of York's earliest years.\n\nAlong with making significant contributions to various educational and public organizations in Ontario and Canada, for which he received an honorary LLD from York in 1992, Alan M. Clarke played a pivotal role during the formation of York University. In the mid-1950s, Clarke held the position of secretary of the YMCA Organizing Committee through which York was created. He played an important role in organizing the committee, keeping it alive and moving the University project forward.\n\nAs an early member of the Board of Governors of York University, Michael M. Koerner has made significant contributions to the founding and development of York. He has been a great supporter and friend to York University over the years. Koerner is also a member of the Order of Canada and was the president of the Art Gallery of Ontario between 1982 and 1984.\n\nAs one of the first faculty appointments made to York University in 1960, John R. Seeley worked closely with Murray Ross, founding president of York, in defining the directions of the new institution. Later in 1962, he was appointed the first Chair of the Department of Sociology. As a distinguished scholar, Seeley was among the early academic leaders of York University.\n\nUnable to attend convocation due to illness, Douglas Lochhead was inducted into the Founders' Society in absentia. As one of the first faculty appointments, he came to York on Jan. 29, 1960. Lochhead was also appointed the first University librarian on July 1, 1960. Since that time he has written various articles in professional journals and numerous poems, many of which are in Canadian periodicals.\n\nIn addition to these members, on Oct. 22 prior to convocation, Douglas Verney was inducted into the Founders' Society during a ceremony held in the Verney Room (S674 Ross). On July 4, 1961, only four months after Atkinson College's founding, Verney joined York University as one of the first two academic appointments to Atkinson College, serving as acting dean. Later in July of 1962, Verney was appointed the first Chair of the fledgling Political Science Department. Verney continued to teach at York until 1996, even after his retirement in 1992.\n\nThe York University Founders' Society is a new honour recognizing those who made major contributions to York during its founding years (1957-1965). Inductions into the Founders' Society will be made on numerous occasions during the 40th anniversary year. Further information is available on the 40th anniversary home page on the York Web site.\n\nMemorial garden established for York professor Classic\n\nThe Linda Lamont-Stewart memorial garden outside Stong College\n\nBy Clara Thomas\n\nOn October 19, almost exactly a year since York's memorial service for Linda Lamont-Stewart, a professor of English at the University, a garden was dedicated in her memory.\n\nLamont-Stewart was first a student at York, a PhD candidate and teaching fellow. She later became a part-time and contract lecturer in the English Department before joining the full-time faculty. Her specialty was Canadian literature.\n\nThe land at the north-east corner of Stong College had formerly been a barren area underneath well-established pine trees. Now, the trees remain, but the land has been planted, and extensively planted, with a variety of shrubs and roses. Those of us who had hoped for a \"Linda Garden\" from the beginning are both surprised and delighted by the area given over to the project, its design and assortment of greenery and flowers supervised by Mary Lynn Reimer, York's Master Planner, and Bob Smith, and their colleagues from Facilities Management.\n\nShrubs with such intriguing names as gold-flame spirea and yellow twig dogwood promise seasonal colour and Lamont-Stewart's very favourite yellow roses - Connell Explorer roses - are already putting forth tentative blooms. There is a walkway, a friendly bench and a surrounding rim of large flat stones which serve as a protection for the planting, meeting and resting place.\n\nA fund for the memorial was established by Lamont-Stewart's parents, whose generosity was extended by donations from her students and colleagues in the English department. A bronze commemoration plaque, fixed to the adjacent wall of Stong College overlooks the garden and honours Linda Lamont-Stewart as a \"much-loved and respected teacher.\"\n\nShe will always be remembered.\n\nShelf Esteem\n\nBy Michael Todd\n\nThe Emergence of the Modern Language Sciences: Studies on the transition from historical-comparative to structural linguistics in honour of E.F.K. Koerner, Vol. 1 (John Benjamins Publishing Co., 1999) edited by York Professor of languages, literatures and linguistics Sheila Embleton, John E. Joseph and Hans-Josef Niederehe.\n\nIn this volume the development of modern linguistics before, during and after Saussure is traced in 20 studies honouring the scholar who has done more than anyone else to professionalize linguistic historiography during the last quarter century. Among the wide range of topics covered are: grammar and philosophy in the age of comparativism, the relations of Saussure's anagram studies to his theory of the linguistic sign, nationalist overtones in German linguistics from 1914 to 1945, and the true story of why Chomsky's Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory didn't get published during the 1950s or 1960s.\n\nVolume 2: Methodological perspectives and applications (John Benjamins Publishing Co., 1999) edited by York Professor of languages, literatures and linguistics Sheila Embleton, John E. Joseph and Hans-Josef Niederehe. Alongside considerable continuity, 20th-century diachronic linguistics has seen substantial shifts in outlook and procedure from the 19th-century paradigm. Our understanding of what is really new and what is recycled owes a great debt to E.F.K. Koerner's minutely researched interpretations of the work of the field's founders and key transitional figures. Some of the best-known scholars in the field explore in 22 studies how these methodological shifts have been and continue to be laid out in historical Romance, Germanic and Indo-European linguistics, as well as in work outside these traditional areas.\n\nThe Collected Works of George Grant, Vol.1 (1933-1950) (University of Toronto Press, 1999) edited by York social science Professor Arthur Davis and Peter C. Emberley, professor of political science at Carleton University. A decade after his death, George Grant continues to stimulate, challenge and inspire. During his lifetime his voice reached a broad cross-section of Canadians, and urged us to think more deeply about matters of justice and responsibility. He wrote on subjects as diverse as technology, abortion, Canadian politics and nationalism, and the war in Vietnam. Vol.1 reveals Grant's mind as it develops through his student years. Included are his early reviews, a brief journal written as he recovered from TB in 1942 and his earliest social and political writings about Canada.\n\nVision and Action (Cambridge University Press, 1998) edited by psychology and biology Professor Laurence Harris and computer science Professor Michael Jenkin deals with vision and action as an interactive, multi-sensory visual process. It is becoming apparent to perception scientists and visual psychophysicists that perceptual senses do not function in isolation. The visual processes involved in moving, reaching, grasping and playing sports turns out to be a complex interaction. This book derives from an international conference held at York University where leading scientists from around the world met to discuss several facets of vision and action. The book would be of interest to graduate students and researchers in vision science.\n\nPolitical science student Melanie Stewart Millar's Cracking the Gender Code: Who Rules the Wired World? (Second Story Press, 1998) won first prize this year in the computer/Internet category of the Independent Publisher Book Awards. Stewart Millar argues that women must critically examine and understand our relationship to technology if we are to have decision-making power in the digital society that is rapidly taking shape around us. Using the critical tools of a feminist politics of anticipation, she points to strategies and coalition-based activism that can help us counteract the relentless pursuit to technotopia: a place where women and people of colour are once again relegated to the lower echelons of the social structure and where democracy is being redefined.\n\nComputational Principles of Mobile Robotics (Cambridge University Press) by authors Michael Jenkin, York professor of computer science, and Gregory Dudek, director of the mobile robotics laboratory at McGill University, emphasizes the computational methods of programming robotics, rather than the methods of constructing the hardware. The book is divided into three major parts: locomotion, sensing and reasoning. Mobile robotics is a multidisciplinary field involving both computer science and engineering. Addressing the design of automated systems lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, computational vision and robotics. Autonomous robots must negotiate the reality of moving, sensing and reasoning out their environment. Mobile Robotics approaches these three tasks and describes the way in which existing robotic systems have addressed them.\n\nWhat should be done about Burma? asks US consul general in talk at Yor\n\nUS Consul-General Franklin Huddle\n\nBy Cathy Carlyle\n\nWhen you have a military-run government in control which ignores human rights issues, you have a problem. When you have a government which shows no desire to change and shows indifference to sanctions, the problem seems almost impossible to solve. Burma is an example of such a government and the one which Frank Huddle, US consul general in Toronto, chose to illustrate his talk on \"problem states\".\n\n\"It's hard to get Burma to come to the table....It's hard for the United States to come up with a policy of carrots and sticks that has any effect on the Burmese government,\" he said during an informal talk at York recently. \"In the case of the US, and possibly of Canada, the role of values in creating foreign policy looms large. We do have underlying values, but it's hard to mix those with our interests in Burma. Our interests there are not that large, and certain ideals are beyond our control.\n\n\"One of the problems is that since 1988 Burma has been falling apart economically and the military sees itself as saviours. SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council, the military ruling body] started taking steps to resurrect the military almost as a theology. They insisted on newspapers repeating outdated sayings from the past, like Russia repeating Lenin's words.\" Huddle talked about the military having a \"mission\" and of the \"mind set\" they share through \"living, playing, talking together, and listening to eternal monologues about past heroes\". The members of SLORC, mostly generals, have limited education, almost no contact with the West, and have had their tutelage with General Ne Win [chairman of the non-democratic Burmese Socialist Programme Party], he added.\n\nHuddle described Burma as insular and isolated physically - \"It has been cut off from the rest of the world since there is no road crossing through it\" - and metaphorically. He added that the Burmese government's negotiating style is \"take it or leave it\", and said it is willing to pay the price for its intransigence, even though inflation is \"spectacularly high\" and poverty seems endemic.\n\n\"We're trying to move gradually in Burma, hoping the government there will come to its senses. It is difficult to hold out carrots because Burma is a country rich in resources. It is an exporter of food. And there is a natural resilience to pressure from sanctions. Sanctions work only when universally agreed upon, too. The US cannot apply them alone and hope to make the government change.\"\n\nHe said the sanctions that have been tried - for instance, denying Burma the GSP [the United States' generalized system of preferences which provides duty-free entry to certain products from designated counties and territories], downgrading the US's relationship with them, imposing an arms embargo - have had little effect. \"The only tactic that remotely worked was when we refused to grant visas to high-ranking government members. There's a lack of a really big carrot or a big stick, other than all-out war. The Burmese government counts on the fact that we are 10,000 miles away, and war with them is unlikely.\"\n\nDuring a discussion period, Huddle was asked whether the United States had anything to learn from its relationship with North Korea vis-à-vis Burma. He said the former is a country with \"nuclear ambitions\" and a huge army with \"erratic and aggressive\" behaviour. \"That's why we're willing to offer carrots, in the hopes that their nuclear plans will go no further\". In response to another question, he said that ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) has had little success in affecting change in Burma and, in fact, has been \"repeatedly frustrated\" by the Burmese government.\n\nWhen asked if he was optomistic about the future of Burma, Huddle replied, \"We can always hope that satellite news - illegal in Burma, but there - will bring about a difference; that the generals will realize that a moderate rule is preferable and will bring this into effect; and that we can help Burma's neighbours - China, Thailand and to some degree, India - to play a constructive role. The best policy is to steadily put a price on intransigence.\"\n\nCanadian ambassador to Chile on awareness-raising mission during visit to York\n\nBy Susan Scott\n\nChile's government is stable and in December, the country is poised to elect its first democratic president since the early 1970s, according to Canada's ambassador to the Latin American republic.\n\nLawrence Lederman's October visit to York was organized by the York Centre for Research on Latin America and the Caribbean (CERLAC) and Gary J. Smith, vice-president (university advancement). Lederman began his ambassador posting in September 1997. Prior to that, he was Chief of Protocol for Canada.\n\nLederman explained that the political mood in Chile is quieter as the country prepares for the election of a new president despite the shadow of a continuing controversy surrounding the country's former president, Augusto Pinochet. Pinochet is in England awaiting a judicial decision of an appeal by his lawyers to the British court to overturn an earlier ruling that would have ordered Pinochet's extradition to Spain. Spain requested the extradition because it wants to try Pinochet for the alleged murders of Spanish citizens in Chile during Pinochet's presidency from 1973-1990.\n\nChile also wants Pinochet back and Lederman said for many Chileans this option would be preferable. If he was sent back, he could then be dealt with by his own citizens. \"They don't want imperialistic forces to keep him,\" he said.\n\nLederman predicted a return to democratic rule after the Dec. 12 elections, the first time this has happened since Salvador Allende was overthrown in September 1973 by Pinochet, his then-commander of the armed forces. \"I believe the new leader will allow a free market economy and do more for the country's social programs. The government is stable, there's no fear of change or uncertainty in the country, and other countries should feel confident in continuing to export to the country,\" Lederman said.\n\nOn the subject of exporting, Lederman delivered some fascinating statistics. He reported that Canada is the second largest investor (behind the United States), primarily in the mining sector. Canada also invests significantly in Chile in energy, financial services, equipment manufacturing and telecommunications. In 1998, Canada ranked first among foreign investors in Chile with $2.22 billion in new investment, according to Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT).\n\nIn addition, Chile is the only South-American country to have established a free-trade agreement with Canada that took effect in July of 1997.\n\nLederman admitted that Chile still faces problems, particularly poverty. He cited figures indicating poverty has dropped to 25 per cent from 40 per cent in 1993. Unemployment is estimated at 11 per cent. On the positive side, inflation has dropped to three per cent this year from 4.7 per cent last year and economic growth may reach four per cent this year.\n\nRicardo Grinspun, former director of CERLAC, questioned Lederman about the progress Chile has made. He said his group has worked in the area for 20 years and he still sees \"two Chilies.\" He cites continuing concerns as rural development and improving the lives of rural peasants, access to health care, the rights of aboriginal peoples and the environment, particularly resources such as water.\n\nGrinspun admitted these are not problems only in Chile but says the country's political instability has contributed to fear amongst the people.\n\n\"Canada should develop broader objectives with Chile, ones that will promote economic growth without harming people. I agree the Chilean democracy has made strides but they've been limited or constrained vis-à-vis the former dictatorship.\" He added many Chileans still fear the military.\n\nGrinspun said his group would be interested in further meetings with Lederman's embassy staff. \"Canada is a leader in promoting democratization, we should continue to do all we can.\"\n\nCERLAC is working with a university in southern Chile to establish a centre for sustainable development, and in the city of Arica in northern Chile to create a centre for adult education for women.\n\nAside from CERLAC's involvement, York's Schulich School of Business has formal linkages with two Chilean universities.\n\nYUFEAA Excellence in Teaching Award\n\nBy Nishat Karim\n\nWhat better way to honour, support and celebrate the fine teachers that York University produces than to award them for excellence in teaching? That's just what the York University Faculty of Education Alumni Association (YUFEAA) has done. This year, the recipient of the second annual Excellence in Teaching Award for 1998-1999 is Catherine Little, a science teacher at Windfields Junior High School and a graduate of York in 1992. The runner up, Jeffrey Kawzenuk is a teacher at Port Hope High School and a graduate from York in 1985.\n\nThe YUFEAA teaching award recognizes an educator who has made an outstanding contribution to the field of education. The educator demonstrates qualities such as, but not limited to, enhancing students' lives through the act of teaching; creates a collaborative and innovative teaching environment; and implements innovative teaching methods, creative program design and exciting learning opportunities for students.\n\nOne student summed up how Little has accomplished all of this and more. Ainslie J. Harris said, \"Mrs. Little is one of the most truly dedicated teachers I have had. She really enjoys her job and one of the ways she shows that is by adding fun and creativity to the curriculum. She has passed her love of science on to me, and given life once again to my idea of becoming an engineer. She helps kids to enjoy science and realize their potential. She encourages all students to do their best. If there is anyone who deserves this award for excellence in teaching, it is her.\"\n\nThis year's award was sponsored by Manulife Financial, who provided a cash award of $1,000. All educators of York University's Faculty of Education Pre-service, In-service or Graduate Studies programs are eligible for nomination. To receive more information please contact the Faculty of Education at (416) 736-5001.\n\nResearch explores connections between information technology and international politics\n\nBy Susan Scott\n\nMichael Dartnell is fascinated by information technology and how political organizations around the world are increasingly using the Internet to get their messages out.\n\nThe 1993 PhD graduate from York has returned to the University for this academic year after receiving a $30,000 grant from the United States Institute of Peace to study this phenomenon. The institute is a Washington-based organization created by the US Congress to promote peaceful resolution to conflicts around the world. Prior to coming to York, Dartnell was at Concordia University in Montreal. He's now based at York's Centre for International and Security Studies.\n\nDartnell plans to use his funding to research and create \"Insurgency Online\" a permanent Web site archive about Internet-active political groups. In fact, this work in progress is available through York's Web site: www.yorku.ca/ research/online/insuron.htm. He's also planning research trips and eventually a book chronicling his findings. To assist him with the project, Darnell has five research assistants. As well this year, he's teaching two seminars at the University, one called \"The Politics of Cyberspace\", the other \"Insurgency Online\".\n\nWhile searching for a base to conduct his research, he approached York because of its \"innovative and progressive profile\". He believes his work compliments the University's objective to heighten its profile in the field of information technology, which is a new area for international relations and comparative political research.\n\nDartnell has written and lectured extensively on politics and terrorism. Among others, he's written on France's Action Directe, an extreme-left terrorist organization. As well, his current Web site includes his Online Guide to Political Inquiry, a links library of hundreds of political science resources.\n\nSo who are these groups? Dartnell says they can be \"democratic or non-democratic, but not mainstream.\" Some examples include the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition, a small political party that Dartnell estimates captured a small percentage of the vote (approximately 10,000 people out of the 500,000 people in Northern Ireland) in that province's most recent election. Another example is the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan, a social and political action organization interested in democracy and women's rights in their country that is using the Web to document conditions in that country. Still another is Hamas, the Palestinian resistance organization against Israeli occupation. And another is Gay and Lesbians of Zimbabwe, who publicized homophobic remarks made by that country's leader, Robert Mugabe.\n\nDartnell admits the number of groups with their own sites, or pages on other sites, is \"huge\". His own interest in the subject was sparked when, as a PhD student at York, he completed his thesis on political terrorism and \"how marginal organizations get their message into the mainstream\". More recently, he's combined that interest withe the Internet revolution.\n\nThe striking point, says Dartnell, is how the Internet helps these groups get their message out. \"They can have influence far beyond their numbers and far beyond their physical location\" because of the international scope of the Internet.\n\nUltimately, using the Internet will, in Dartnell's mind, create a new kind of \"political elite,\" one that is highly technically \"savvy\". He's also interested in the way the Internet is breaking down traditional territorial politics.\n\n\"A country, its politics and individual identity use to be identified by territorial limits that were inviolable. But it doesn't matter where you are with the Internet. So, I want to know, what does this mean? How do we understand the power system, what is power and how does the individual fit into this?\" says Dartnell.\n\nAlthough there are organizations dabbling in similar research, including The Rand Corporation, a non-profit research group in the US and the Institute of Peace, Darnell says his research is more comprehensive. His focus is to establish a permanent educational and archival research centre on the Web, a clearing house of information on one site.\n\nCanadian medical history at the millennium: past accomplishments, future directions\n\nBy Georgina Feldberg and Alison Li\n\nOn Nov. 5 and 6, 60 historians of medicine from across Canada met at the York Senate Chamber to discuss \"Canadian Medical History at the Millennium: Past Accomplishments, Future Directions\". The conference, generously funded by AMS/Hannah Institute, was held in honour of Hannah Professor Emeritus of the History of Medicine at McMaster University Dr. Charles G. Roland.\n\nRoland organized the first, and very influential, conference on Canadian medical history and historiography in 1983. Now, some 15 years later, professional historians, physicians, sociologists and archivists gathered at York University to review the course of historical change and the shifting roles that history can play in medical education and debate.\n\nIn a session on \"Sources and Resources\", Barbara Craig (Faculty of Information Science, University of Toronto) explored the technical and economic challenges of conserving electronic and web-based communications. Other sessions covered national and regional perspectives; historical demography; women and health; biography; science, hospitals and institutions. Mary-Ellen Kelm (University of Northern British Columbia) spoke about medical history and the politics of aboriginal populations. She pointed to contributions medical historians can make to the demography of First Nations. Heather MacDougall (University of Waterloo) traced the making of Medicare as a national cultural icon.\n\nThe papers, presented in both English and French, stimulated discussion of how the practice of history will respond to new sources of data and how health reform and shifting institutional structures might alter the parameters of health history.\n\nThe keynote address was presented by Michael Bliss (University of Toronto) whose biography of Sir William Osler has recently been nominated for the Governor General's Prize. Bliss spoke on the subject of \"Oslerolatary\", or, the hero-worship of the celebrated physician. He asked what we as historians can learn from this phenomenon and indeed, from Osler himself.\n\nPlans are underway to publish a collection of the presented papers in the Canadian Bulletin of Medical History.\n\nGeorgina Feldberg is director of the York University Centre for Health Studies. Alison Li is a professor of science & technology studies at York University's Atkinson College."
