He drew attention for the first time to the role of cell death in normal adult mammals and in disease. He clearly enunciated the concept that cell death is a selectively regulated process which should be possible to control in disease states.\n\nProfessor Kerr was born in Sydney in 1934. He studied medicine at the University of Queensland and worked as an intern, then pathology registrar at the Royal Brisbane Hospital from 1958 to 1961. He obtained his PhD from University College Hospital Medical School in London.\n\nHe then returned to the University of Queensland in 1965 as Senior Lecturer in Pathology becoming Professor of Pathology in 1974, whilst also working as a pathologist at the Royal Brisbane Hospital.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1995 Professor Kerr was Adjunct Senior Principal Research Fellow at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research. He retired in 1995 and was Professor Emeritus at the University of Queensland from 1996.\n\nProfessor Kerr was a Fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (1967) and the Royal College of Physicians (1974).\n\nHe was awarded the Australian Medical Association of Queensland’s Bancroft Medal and Oration (1993), the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Fred W Stewart Award (1995), Germany’s Paul Ehrlich & Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize (jointly with H Robert Horvitz, 2000) and the Charles University and City of Prague Charles IV Prize (2002).\n\nHe received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from the University of Queensland (1998) and was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (1996)."
