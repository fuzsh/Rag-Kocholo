The funding will be used to drive PureTech's existing pipeline forward and to advance new healthcare related products and technologies. \"PureTech has the scientific creativity to really go for the big ideas that can be game changers. The team dreams up technologies and then makes them happen,\" said Dr. Robert Langer, PureTech Co-founder & Institute Professor at MIT. \"It's exciting to have additional resources to drive these important products to market.\"\n\nIn conjunction with the funding round, PureTech announced the appointment of three new Senior Partners: Dr. H Robert Horvitz, Nobel Laureate, David H. Koch Professor at MIT, and Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Mr. Joi Ito, Director of the MIT Media Lab and board member of Sony, the MacArthur Foundation, The New York Times, the Knight Foundation and Mozilla; and Dr. Raju Kucherlapati, Paul C.
