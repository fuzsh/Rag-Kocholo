        "text": "JINFO.ORG\n\nElection to the British Royal Society is one of the greatest distinctions in the world of science. Approximately 1,450 individuals currently hold this honor, of whom about ninety percent are citizens or residents of British Commonwealth countries or the Republic of Ireland. These are the \"Fellows\" of the Society. The remaining roughly ten percent are designated \"Foreign Members.\" The Foreign Membership of the Royal Society thus represents the \"cream\" of international science outside the Commonwealth countries and the Irish Republic. Listed below are individuals, both living and deceased, elected to Foreign Membership between 1901 and the present (i.e., over the same period of time during which the Nobel Prizes have been awarded) who were, or are, Jewish, or of half- or three-quarters-Jewish descent, as noted. Note that although the majority of individuals on the list below are not Nobel Prize winners, the percentage of Jews and those of Jewish descent elected to Foreign Membership between 1901 and the present closely matches the overall percentage of such individuals who have received Nobel Prizes in the sciences, medicine, and economics. The year shown in parenthesis for each individual is the year of his or her election.\n\nAnatole Abragam (1983)\n\nAlexei Abrikosov 1 (2001)\n\nYakir Aharonov (2024)\n\nBruce Alberts (1993)\n\nVladimir Arnold 2 (1988)\n\nKenneth Arrow (2006)\n\nRichard Axel (2014)\n\nJulius Axelrod (1979)\n\nDavid Baltimore (1987)\n\nGrigory Barenblatt (2000)\n\nBarry Barish (2019)\n\nBonnie Bassler 3 (2012)\n\nSeymour Benzer (1976)\n\nPaul Berg (1992)\n\nHans Bethe 4 (1957)\n\nKonrad Bloch (1985)\n\nNiels Bohr 5 (1926)\n\nRaoul Bott 6 (2005)\n\nRonald Breslow (2000)\n\nEdouard Brézin (2006)\n\nMichael Brown (1991)\n\nMelvin Calvin (1959)\n\nEmily Carter (2024)\n\nVinton Cerf 7 (2016)\n\nCatherine Cesarsky (2005)\n\nMartin Chalfie (2018)\n\nDavid Chandler (2011)\n\nErnst Cohen (1926)\n\nStanley Deser (2021)\n\nCarl Djerassi (2010)\n\nPaul Ehrlich (1910)\n\nPaul R.

At least three of Vinton Cerf's four paternal great grandparents were Jews. Bennett Cerf, the (Jewish) co-founder of publishing giant Random House, was a cousin. 8. Jewish father, non-Jewish mother; see http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2011/03/tom-eisner-father-chemical-ecology-dies-81.\n\n9. Jewish father, non-Jewish mother, according to a follow-up dispatch issued by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) several days after publication of its October 14, 1992 story on that year's Nobel Prizes written by Tom Tugend.\n\n10.

Stephen Kuffler, known as the \"father of modern neuroscience,\" was described as having had a Jewish paternal grandmother by his colleague Nobel Prize winner Sir Bernard Katz and as having had \"one Jewish grandfather\" by his former student Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel. In fact, all four of Kuffler's grandparents were Jews, although he was baptized into the Reformed Church of Hungary and identified as a Roman Catholic most of his life. His paternal grandparents were Benjamin and Flora (née Mittelmann) Kuffler; his maternal grandparents were Adolf and Julia (née Schlesinger) Kohn. (Contrary to other biographical information, his mother was born Elsa (or Elza) Kohn, not Elsa Kertesz.) Kuffler's paternal grandparents are buried in the Jewish Cemetery of Györ, Györ-Moson-Sopron, Hungary. His uncle Paul (Pal) Kuffler, who was murdered by the Nazis in 1944, is buried in the Kozma Street Jewish Cemetery in Budapest.\n\n13.

Jewish mother, non-Jewish father; see http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1946/muller-bio.html.\n\n16. Pauli described himself as being three-quarters Jewish in a letter to Frank Aydelotte, the director of the Institute for Advanced Study, quoted in the April 1995 issue of Physics Today (p. 86). See also http://www.ethbib.ethz.ch/exhibit/pauli/ausreise_e.html. According to the family-authorized biography of Pauli by Charles Enz, No Time to be Brief: A Scientific Biography of Wolfgang Pauli (Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York, 2002, pp. 1-7), three of Pauli's four grandparents (all but his maternal grandmother) were Jewish. Specifically, Pauli's father, Wolfgang Pauli, Sr. (originally Wolf Pascheles, whose parents came from the prominent Jewish Pascheles and Utitz families of Prague), converted from Judaism to Roman Catholicism shortly before his marriage in 1899 to Bertha Camilla Schütz. Bertha Schütz was raised in her mother's Roman Catholic religion, but her father was the Jewish writer Friedrich Schütz (whose biography can be found on p. 469 of Vol. 5 of S. Wininger's Grosse Jüdische National-Biographie). Although Pauli was raised as a Roman Catholic, eventually he (and his parents) left the Church.\n\n17. Jewish mother, non-Jewish father according to interview in Bitter Prerequisites: A Faculty for Survival from Nazi Terror, by William Laird Kleine-Ahlbrandt (Purdue University Press, West Lafayette, IN, 2001, p. 48).
