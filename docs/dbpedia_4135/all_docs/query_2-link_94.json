Martin, independently, in the same year.[16] The availability of these cultured stem cells eventually made possible the introduction of specific gene alterations into the germ line of mice and the creation of transgenic mice. There's a period that Evans worked in the Whitehead Institute at MIT[1].\n\nEvans and his collaborators showed that they could introduce a new gene into cultured embryonic stem cells and then use such genetically transformed cells to make chimeric embryos [17]. In some chimeric embryos, the genetically altered stem cells produced gametes, thus allowing transmission of the artificially induced mutation into future generations of mice.[18] Transgenic mice with induced mutations in the enzyme Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) were created.[19] The HPRT mutations were produced by retroviral insertion, but it was proposed that by taking advantage of genetic recombination between the normal HPRT gene and an artificial gene sequenced added to the cultured embryonic stem cells, \"it may also eventually be possible to produce specific alterations in endogenous genes through homologous recombination with cloned copies modified in vitro\". The production of transgenic mice using this proposed approach was accomplished in the laboratories of Oliver Smithies,[20] and also of Mario Capecchi.[21]\n\nReferences\n\n^ Evans, Martin J.
