        "text": "Peng Leong, PhD, MBA is the Chief Business Officer and Head of Brain Aging of BioAge, a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a pipeline of treatments to extend healthy lifespan by targeting the molecular causes of aging. Peng leads BIOAGE’s efforts to identify and execute strategic transactions that will help the company to convert prioritized drug targets into a portfolio of therapies for human aging. Peng started his career at Chiron Corporation, studying signaling pathways involved in cancer before moving to business development where he acquired rights to novel technologies and drug candidates. While working in healthcare investment banking at CIBC World Markets and Piper Jaffray, he was involved in raising more than US$ 1.4 billion for over 20 biotechnology companies. In his various roles, including at Merck KGaA, Peng has played a leadership role in the acquisition or sale of over US$ 1 billion in pharmaceutical product rights. As CBO of Kazia Therapeutics, Peng was responsible for strategy and business development,\n\nand in-licensed GDC-0084 in Phase II trials for glioblastoma. Peng received his PhD in Biochemistry from the University of Toronto, Canada and an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nEric Morgen, MD is the Chief Operating Officer of BioAge, a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a pipeline of treatments to extend healthy lifespan by targeting the molecular causes of aging. Eric oversees BioAge’s clinical and computational efforts to bring new therapeutics to the clinic that target fundamental mechanisms of aging. Eric was previously an assistant professor at the University of Toronto, where his research focused on biomarker discovery and characterization in high-dimensional datasets from human cohorts. He completed an HBSc in artificial intelligence, MD, clinical training in pathology, and a research fellowship in computational biology and molecular epidemiology at the University of Toronto, where he held a Canada Graduate Scholarship from the CIHR, and was subsequently a CIHR research fellow. He has published over 15 papers in the areas of molecular biomarker discovery, pharmacogenomics, aging, and diagnostic medicine. Eric is a licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada, a fellow of\n\nthe Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, holds a specialty designation in pathology, and previously practiced medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto.\n\nBenjamin Yaden, PhD is VP-External Innovation, Diabetes, Obesity and Cardiometabolic Diseases for Eli Lilly and Company. In his present role, he identifies, novel preclinical and clinical assets along with innovative modalities to seed the Lilly Diabetes and Complications portfolio. He works jointly with the therapeutic area R&D and Lilly’s Corporate Business Development partners to help define and execute strategy for External Innovation. In addition to his primary role, he serves on scientific advisory boards and as a board observer in the biotech space. Ben has 20 years of drug discovery experience in a multitude of disease areas (men’s health/urology, skeletal muscle wasting, diabetes, fibrosis and metabolism) including both external and internal partnering. He received his MS and PhD from Purdue University. He currently serves as an adjunct professor in the Biology Department at Purdue University (Indianapolis), where he continues to investigate and collaborate with world leaders in hepatology to delineate TGFβ superfamily mechanisms\n\naround chronic liver/skeletal muscle injury and fibrosis."
