Thompson, PhD\n\nChair, Scientific Advisory Board\n\nDonald Bren and Chancellor’s Professor\n\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Human Behavior\n\nDepartment of Neurobiology and Behavior\n\nUniversity of California, Irvine\n\nDr. Leslie Thompson has studied Huntington’s disease for most of her scientific career. She was a member of the the HDF’s Venezuela Project that identified the causative gene for HD in 1993. She is trying to understand how the HD mutation damages brain cells and identify targets for new drugs to prevent or ameliorate the damage. She is also looking at how the mutation influences modifications of the huntingtin protein and other cellular molecules. In addition, Dr. Thompson worked with a group of investigators to establish the HD patient-derived iPS cell consortium (induced pluripotent stem cells) and is using stem cells to study HD through multi-institutional collaborations and Big Data approaches. She is currently evaluating the use of human neural stem cells as a possible therapy for HD.\n\nDr. Thompson is an American Association for the Advancement of Science fellow. She received the HDF’s Leslie Gehry Brenner Prize for Innovation in Science in 2013.\n\nDiane E. Merry, PhD, Vice Chair\n\nProfessor and Vice Chair\n\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology\n\nThomas Jefferson University\n\nDr. Diane Merry researches the molecular mechanisms underlying inherited neurodegenerative disease, with a primary focus on Kennedy’s disease, which is caused by the identical and unusual genetic mutation that causes Huntington’s disease. Dr. Merry’s group has developed and utilized unique cell and mouse models to both understand mechanisms of disease and identify molecular targets for therapeutic development. Over the past decades her group has made important and fundamental discoveries into the structural and functional requirements of the mutant androgen receptor (AR) protein in disease and has identified several AR targets that are in preclinical development.\n\nDr. Merry serves as Vice Chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University and chairs the Scientific Advisory Board for the Vickie & Jack Farber Institute for Neuroscience at Jefferson.\n\nX. William Yang, MD, PhD\n\nProfessor\n\nTerry Semel Chair in Alzheimer's Disease Research and Treatment\n\nCenter for Neurobehavioral Genetics\n\nThe Jane and Terry Semel Institute for Neuroscience & Human Behavior\n\nDepartment of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Sciences, Brain Research Institute\n\nDavid Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA\n\nDr. X. William Yang co-invented a powerful mouse genetic technology to engineer bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and to generate BAC transgenic mice. His laboratory at UCLA has made significant contributions to the development of transgenic mouse models for human neurodegenerative disorders including Huntington’s, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and the use of such models to dissect disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets.\n\nThe Yang lab has also applied novel genetic and systems biology approaches to study brain gene expression, and to decipher RNA and protein networks for HD in particular. They study the role of basal ganglia circuitry in the generation of normal and pathological behaviors. The Yang lab invented a new mouse genetic tool (called MORF mice) for brainwide labeling of thousands of neurons and glial cells to illuminate their exquisite morphology.\n\nDr. Yang received the NIH’s BRAIN Initiative award, the McKnight Foundation’s Brain Disorder Award, and the HDF’s 2014 Leslie Gehry Brenner Prize for Innovation in Science. He is a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation.\n\nAnne B. Young, MD, PhD\n\nChair Emerita, Scientific Advisory Board\n\nChair Emerita, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital\n\nDistinguished Julieanne Dorn Professor of Neurology, Harvard Medical School\n\nRoyal College of Physicians, London\n\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\n\nNational Academy of Medicine\n\nDr. Anne B. Young is an acclaimed researcher and clinician whose work at the bench and bedside has concentrated on neurotransmitter systems in the basal ganglia and their role in Huntington’s, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. She and her late husband John B. (“Jack”) Penney, Jr. first conceptualized a model of the functional anatomy of the basal ganglia that has been termed the “classical” model. They both played key roles in the HDF’s Venezuela Project which led to the identification of the HD gene.\n\nDr. Young was recruited in 1991 to Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital as the hospital’s first female head of a department. She founded and designed the MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases (MIND) in 2001 to accelerate the discovery of effective therapies for these diseases. In addition to training generations of outstanding clinicians and researchers, she has served on many editorial and advisory boards, served as president of the Society for Neuroscience, and received many awards and honors, including the HDF’s 2016 Leslie Gehry Brenner Prize for Innovation in Science.\n\nGillian P. Bates, FMedSci, PhD, FRS\n\nProfessor of Molecular Neuroscience\n\nCo-Director Huntington's Disease Centre\n\nUniversity College London (UCL) Institute of Neurology\n\nFellow, Royal Society\n\nDr. Gillian Bates was a member of the HDF’s Venezuela Project that identified the causative gene for HD in 1993. She went on to develop the first mouse model of HD in 1996. She currently uses mouse models to understand the earliest events that cause HD, validate approaches to treating this disease and steer drug development programs.\n\nIn 2013 Dr. Bates demonstrated that, when carrying the HD mutation, the HD gene produces a small, truncated huntingtin protein (exon 1 HTT) along with the complete HTT protein. This exon 1 HTT is known to readily form the aggregates that are found in HD patient brain tissue and to cause brain cell dysfunction. Finding approaches that will decrease exon 1 HTT levels has become an important goal in developing treatments that will delay the onset or slow the progression of HD. Dr. Bates received the HDF’s Leslie Gehry Brenner Prize for Innovation in Science in 2012.\n\nC. Frank Bennett, PhD\n\nChief Scientific Officer\n\nIonis Pharmaceuticals\n\n2019 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences\n\nDr. C. Frank Bennett is one of the founding members of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, leading much of their preclinical antisense drug discovery and antisense technology research.

He has published more than 230 papers in the field of antisense research and development and has more than 175 issued US patents.\n\nDr. Bennett collaborated with Adrian Krainer, of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, to develop Spinraza, the first effective therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the number one genetic cause of death for infants. It affects the motor nerve cells in the spinal cord and impacts the muscles used for activities such as breathing, eating, crawling, and walking. Since Spinraza’s approval in 2016, more than 11,000 people have been treated with it worldwide.\n\nPrior to joining Ionis, Dr. Bennett was Associate Senior Investigator in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology at SmithKline and French Laboratories, currently GSK. He received HDF’s 2018 Leslie Gehry Brenner Prize for Innovation in Science.\n\nBeverly L. Davidson, PhD\n\nKatherine A. High Chair in Cell and Gene Therapy\n\nDirector, Raymond G. Perelman Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics\n\nChief Scientific Strategy Officer, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia\n\nProfessor, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\n\nNational Academy of Medicine\n\nDr. Beverly Davidson’s laboratory focuses on genetic diseases that affect the brain, investigating how mutant gene products contribute to disease, and why certain brain regions are more susceptible than others. Her team employs advanced molecular methods, sequencing and imaging in animal models, and a variety of molecular tools to test various hypotheses. Her lab is also developing next generation therapeutics for inherited disorders, including the engineering of novel gene therapy vector capsids and cargo to approach tissue and cell type specific treatments.\n\nRecent honors include the 2023 National Ataxia Foundation’s Dr. John W. Schut Research Achievement Award. She is immediate past president of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy, the largest international association of gene and cell therapy research.

He has studied HD since 1998, inventing and applying innovative methods and tools, including robotic microscopy, stem cells and artificial intelligence. His landmark study in 2004 in Nature changed the way the field thought about the hallmark pathology in Huntington’s disease, the most cited paper in neuroscience for the decade. With philanthropists in the San Francisco Bay Area, he established the Taube-Koret Center, which works to translate the most promising discoveries from the labs into therapeutics, often in partnership with drug companies. His most promising HD therapeutic strategy stimulates a pathway in cells that helps clear the abnormal Huntingtin protein. Dr. Finkbeiner received the HDF’s Leslie Gehry Prize for Innovation in Science in 2022.\n\nJudith Frydman, PhD\n\nDonald Kennedy Chair in Humanities and Sciences\n\nProfessor, Departments of Biology and Genetics\n\nStanford University\n\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\n\nNational Academy of Science\n\nDr. Judith Frydman grew up in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She received her PhD in Biochemistry from the University of Buenos Aires. She carried out her postdoctoral training at the Sloan Kettering Institute in New York.\n\nDr. Frydman's research focuses on understanding how proteins fold in cells. The Frydman lab uses a multidisciplinary approach to address fundamental questions about molecular chaperones (proteins that aid in folding), protein folding and degradation. In addition to basic mechanistic principles, she and her team aim to define how impairment of protein folding and quality control are linked to disease, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease. She examines whether reengineering chaperone networks can provide therapeutic strategies.\n\nMichelle Gray, PhD\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nJarman F. Lowder Endowed Professor in Neuroscience\n\nCenter for Neurodegeneration and Experimental Therapeutics\n\nDepartment of Neurology\n\nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham\n\nDr. Michelle Gray completed her doctoral training in developmental neurobiology at Ohio State University. During her postdoctoral training with Scientific Advisory Board member Dr. X. William Yang at the University of California, Los Angeles, she helped develop a BACHD mouse model (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome human mutant Huntingtin).\n\nDr. Gray is now the Dixon Scholar in Neuroscience and a member of the Center for Neurodegeneration and Experimental Therapeutics at University of Alabama at Birmingham where her lab has a specific interest in the role of mutant Huntingtin- expressing astrocytes in the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease. Her lab has demonstrated that astrocytes are key contributors to the progression of Huntington’s disease-like phenotypes using the conditional BACHD model as well as a differential role of gliotransmission on behavior using this model. A current focus of the lab is understanding the astrocyte and interneuron interactions in the striatum that contribute to the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease.\n\nMyriam Heiman, PhD\n\nLatham Family Career Development Chair\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nDepartment of Brain and Cognitive Sciences\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nInvestigator, Picower Institute for Learning and Memory\n\nDr. Myriam Heiman uses HD patient tissue as well as mouse and cell models of HD to understand why some cells are more or less vulnerable to the mutant HD gene. She uses knowledge of these intrinsic differences to identify new therapeutic targets for HD. Dr. Heiman has pioneered the use of in vivo genetic screening in the mammalian brain, as well as the use of novel single-cell and cell type-specific transcriptional profiling tools to study HD. Her work has recently pointed to the importance of neuronal innate immune activation and cell type-specific mitochondrial dysfunction in HD pathogenesis. She is the recipient of several awards, including an Early Career Investigators Innovation Award from the Bumpus Foundation, a EUREKA grant from the National Institutes of Health and awards for excellence in graduate mentoring and undergraduate teaching from MIT.\n\nH. Robert Horvitz, PhD\n\nInvestigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute\n\nProfessor of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nNobel Laureate\n\nNational Academy of Sciences\n\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\n\nNational Academy of Medicine\n\nDr. Robert Horvitz, 2002 Nobel laureate in Physiology or Medicine, is interested in how genes control animal development and behavior and affect human health. Dr. Horvitz has made seminal discoveries concerning the genetic regulation of signal transduction and programmed cell death. By using the experimentally tractable roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as an experimental organism, he and his team have identified key genes involved in cell lineage, cell fate, cell signaling and programmed cell death as well as in nervous system development and function. They have identified and analyzed molecular and cellular pathways responsible for these and other important biological processes. Their goals are to understand fundamental aspects of biology and to provide mechanistic insights into human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nDavid E. Housman, PhD\n\nLudwig Professor of Biology\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nNational Academy of Sciences\n\nNational Academy of Medicine\n\nDr. David Housman uses genetic approaches to identify the molecular basis of human disease pathology. He develops strategies to combat three major diseases: trinucleotide repeat disorders like Huntington’s disease, cancer and types of cardiovascular disease.\n\nDr. Housman’s research guided the search leading to the 1983 discovery of the HD marker, the first DNA marker ever for a genetic disease. This discovery led a group of scientists to find the HD gene itself in 1993. His current research focuses on identifying modifier genes which are responsible for variation in age of onset for HD in humans as well as in mouse models. His lab also focuses on the identification and development of small molecules which show promise for therapeutic intervention in HD.\n\nDr. Housman has received many prizes and awards.

Jennifer Morton, PhD, ScD, FRSB\n\nProfessor of Neurobiology\n\nUniversity of Cambridge\n\nProfessorial Fellow\n\nDirector of Studies in Medicine and Veterinary Medicine\n\nNewnham College, Cambridge\n\nDr. A. Jennifer Morton has been working on Huntington’s disease ever since she set up her laboratory at the University of Cambridge in 1991. She is interested in understanding the relationship between neurodegeneration and the neurological symptoms in HD. She is particularly interested in sleep, circadian rhythms and cognitive decline in HD. With funding from the Hereditary Disease Foundation, The Wellcome Trust, and CHDI Foundation, she has characterized the behavioral profile of a number of mouse models of HD.\n\nFor the past 10 years, Dr. Morton has also been working with HD sheep. She believes that, although it is an unconventional model, there is much to be gained from understanding the behavioral pathology in this large-brained diurnal model of HD. Her lab’s goal is to identify quantifiable measures of behavior that can be used to test the efficacy of novel therapies for HD.\n\nRichard C.

Orr, PhD\n\nJames Schindler and Bob Allison Ataxia Chair in Translational Research\n\nProfessor, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology\n\nDirector, Institute for Translational Neuroscience\n\nUniversity of Minnesota\n\nNational Academy of Medicine\n\nDr. Harry Orr’s laboratory at the University of Minnesota has a long-standing and productive National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-supported research program on the use of genetics, biochemical, and behavioral approaches in the study of neurodegeneration with a focus on the human disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1).\n\nIn collaboration with Dr. Huda Zoghbi at Baylor University, they cloned the gene affected in SCA1- the first genetically defined ataxia. They then established the first transgenic mouse model of a polyglutamine disease. This model is the center of continued studies on the normal function of the gene product, ataxin-1, as well as the SCA1 pathogenic process. The work is among the first studies to indicate that regions outside of the polyQ tract are critical for disease. Identification of molecular pathways involved in neurodegenerative disease can be significant in development of efficacious targets for intervention. A current focus is on two signaling pathways, each having distinct but seminal roles in SCA1. Dr. Orr received the 2022 Kavli Prize in Neuroscience for his pioneering genetic research on SCA1.\n\nHenry L.

Brown Chair in Neuroscience\n\nAssociate Member, Department of Medicine, Division of Neurology\n\nAssociate Member, Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences\n\nUniversity of British Columbia\n\nLynn Raymond is a clinician-scientist who trained at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and completed a NeuroDr. Lynn Raymond is a clinician-scientist who trained at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. She was recruited to the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 1994 where she combines neuroscience research with clinical practice in neurology. She leads a research lab funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and is Clinic Director of the Centre for Huntington Disease.\n\nFor many years she has investigated the roles of altered neuronal circuits, synapses and NMDA-type glutamate receptors in Huntington’s disease with the goal of finding therapeutics that slow progression. More recently, Dr. Raymond’s work focuses on changes in cortical and striatal synaptic plasticity and circuit function that may underlie early cognitive and sensorimotor deficits and could contribute to neuronal vulnerability to degeneration.\n\nDr. Raymond has served as UBC site investigator for several multi-center clinical research studies in Huntington’s disease.

Steffan, PhD\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Human Behavior\n\nUniversity of California, Irvine\n\nDr. Joan Steffan is studying how a reduction in cellular housekeeping in the brain may contribute to the onset and progression of Huntington’s disease. She identified a role for the Huntingtin protein in a process called autophagy which is a mechanism of protein and organelle clearance by the lysosome, an organelle which contains enzymes that degrade cellular trash to keep the cell clean and generate energy during stressful conditions. She is studying how cellular stress pathways turn on autophagy and induce modification of the Huntingtin protein to activate its autophagic function.\n\nDr. Steffan has found that normal modification of the Huntingtin protein becomes impaired with the mutation, and that Huntingtin protein levels decline with aging in the part of the brain that is affected by Huntington’s disease. She continues to evaluate whether a loss of Huntingtin function in autophagy with aging and mutation may contribute to Huntington’s disease pathogenesis, and is working to develop therapies that may activate this function with the hopes of slowing disease progression.\n\nSarah J. Tabrizi, FRCP, PhD, FMedSci\n\nProfessor of Clinical Neurology\n\nDirector, Huntington’s Disease Centre\n\nJoint Head of Department of Neurodegenerative Disease\n\nUniversity College London (UCL) Queen Square Institute of Neurology\n\nPrincipal Investigator, UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL\n\nHonorary Consultant Neurologist\n\nNational Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square\n\nDr. Sarah Tabrizi leads an internationally recognized bench-to-beside research program at the University College London (UCL) Huntington’s Disease Centre that ranges from studying cellular mechanisms of neurodegeneration to first-in-human clinical trials testing novel disease-modifying therapies. She was first to describe the role of the innate immune system in the pathogenesis of HD, published the first assay of mutant HD protein in human blood cells and cerebrospinal fluid, and led two major international multidisciplinary research initiatives, TRACK-HD and TRACK-ON, yielding fundamental insights into the preclinical stage of HD. Recently she identified and described the mechanisms of important new genetic modifiers of disease progression in HD. Dr. Tabrizi was global clinical PI on the world’s first gene targeting study for HD using anti-sense oligonucleotide therapy, and serves on numerous academic and industry led scientific advisory boards driving preclinical development and translation of nucleic acid and DNA repair therapies for HD.\n\nIn 2014, she was elected a Fellow of the UK Academy of Medical Sciences.

She led the HDF’s history making Venezuela Project, a 22- year international collaborative team, studying the world’s largest Huntington’s disease family in Venezuela, collecting tissue samples, and developing a family tree of over 18,000 individuals spanning 10 generations.\n\nThis work led to the discovery of the DNA marker for Huntington’s disease in 1983 and the HD gene itself in 1993. This same genetic material has assisted in the mapping of other disease genes, including those responsible for familial Alzheimer’s disease, kidney cancer, two kinds of neurofibromatosis, Lou Gehrig’s disease (ALS), dwarfism and others. One important result of this work was the development of a genetic test to determine if an individual carries the expanded version of the HD gene.\n\nIn 2020, the HDF established the Nancy S. Wexler Young Investigator Prize to be awarded annually to a researcher whose work reflects the highest caliber of excellence, diligence and creative thinking. Dr. Wexler has received numerous awards and honors for her work including honorary doctorates from the University of Michigan, Bard College and Yale.

With HDF support, she performed her dissertation work with Dr. Rene Hen at Columbia University, where she and her colleague Jose Lucas used inducible mouse genetics to demonstrate that turning off disease-causing genes leads to the reversal of the HD-like symptoms. As a Helen Hay Whitney Postdoctoral Fellow in Dr. James E. Rothman’s laboratory at Yale, Dr. Yamamoto identified the importance of the pathway autophagy in clearing protein aggregates (clumps), a hallmark of HD. These studies have led to a long-standing collaboration with Dr. Anne Simonsen at the University of Oslo pursuing how the protein Alfy regulates the degradation of aggregates by autophagy and its potential impact on HD pathogenesis.\n\nDr. Yamamoto’s early recognition includes a Dean’s Award of Excellence for her dissertation work, and the Harold and Golden Lamport Award for Excellence in Clinical Science Research.
