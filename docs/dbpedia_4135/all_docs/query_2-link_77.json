Visit Our Biology Page, where youâll find the best biology colleges and universities, career information, interviews with top biologists, influential scholars in the field of biology, great books, a history of the discipline, online biology degrees, and more.\n\nBiology. Taken from the Greek words Î²Î¯Î¿Ï (bios) and Î»ÏÎ³Î¿Ï (logos), biology is the study (logos) of life (bios). A biologist is someone who studies life. Life takes many forms, from the largest animal on earth, the blue whale, to the tiniest single-cell organisms.\n\nBecause the field of biology covers all of life on Earth, it has a number of different branches that study varying areas of biology. These branches include anatomy, biochemistry, biophysics, biotechnology, botany, cell biology, ecology, evolution, genetics, immunology, marine biology, microbiology, molecular biology, mycology, parasitology, photobiology, phycology, physiology, plant physiology, radiobiology, structural biology, theoretical biology, virology, and zoology. Each of these disciplines contributes to our understanding of every living organism that shares this beautiful planet with us.\n\nBiologists also help us to better understand how human activities impact the natural world, how the evolution of species occurs, and how our own bodies work. Biologists work closely with doctors to investigate new treatment methodologies and develop new vaccines and diagnostic tests.\n\nSome biologists are also working to take biology to the future, investigating gene therapies and modifications to eradicate disease, improve immune response, or integrate humans more fully with technology.\n\nThe famous biologists on this list have made groundbreaking discoveries in their respective fields of study, saving lives, preventing disease outbreaks, and improving our management of fisheries and other natural resources.\n\nIn what follows, we look at influential biologists over the last decade. Based on our ranking methodology, these individuals have significantly impacted the academic discipline of biology within 2010-2020. Influence can be produced in a variety of ways. Some have had revolutionary ideas, some may have climbed by popularity, but all are academicians primarily working in biology. Read more about our methodology.\n\nNote: This isnât simply a list of the most influential biologists alive today. Here we are focused on the number of citations and web presence of scholars in the last 10 years. There are other highly influential scholars who simply havenât been cited and talked about as much in the last 10 years, whereas some new faces have been making a splash in the news, speaking events, and publishing, publishing, publishing. Our AI is time sensitive. To find some of the big names you might have expected to see here, we encourage you to use our dynamic ranking system and check influence over the past 20 and 50 years.\n\nWant more?

He studied zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, earning a bachelorâs degree, MA, and PhD.\n\nDawkins is a pioneer in the role of genes in evolution. His most well-known book, The Selfish Gene, is an examination of how genetics drive evolutionary change. He also coined the term meme in this book, to describe the behavioral equivalent of a gene. A meme, he felt, reflected a cultural touchpoint that, once assumed in popular culture, continued to evolve and change as it passed from one person to another.\n\nIn 2006, he published The God Delusion, a book in which he challenges religiosity and its infiltration into government and politics. In his view, children should be taught comparative religion in school without bias, enabling them to draw their own conclusions about religion based on evidence and critical assessment. He is an opponent of the teaching of intelligent design in schools, which he considers a compromise to give oxygen to creationism.\n\nLearn more about Richard Dawkins\n\n#2\n\nCarolyn Bertozzi\n\n#10261\n\nOverall Influence\n\n1966 - Present (58 years)\n\nCarolyn Ruth Bertozzi is an American chemist and Nobel laureate, known for her wide-ranging work spanning both chemistry and biology.

He has become a vocal advocate for his theories on evolutionary biology, which has earned him both acclaim and criticism. At times, he has appeared to be hampered by his political beliefs, perhaps unwilling to consider possibilities that did not comport with his worldview.\n\nHe has challenged the notion of inheritability of intelligence and other traits, feeling instead that the lifeform is an active participant in evolution and the environment, rather than a passive participant. He has also theorized that genetically modified crops were not created just to be better, but to also force farmers into having to buy new seeds every year, rather than to use the seeds created by their last crop.\n\nLearn more about Richard Lewontin\n\n#7\n\nEdward O.

He graduated from Princeton University as valedictorian, with a BS in mathematics. He went on to attend University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, where he earned his PhD He is a founder of Verastem and a founding advisor of Foundation Medicine.\n\nHe began his career in mathematics, but soon started looking at mathematical applications in neurobiology. In order to make the transition, he studied cellular neurobiology and later microbiology and genetics. He founded the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research which quickly became one of the worldâs leading genomic research centers.\n\nLearn more about Eric Lander\n\n#21\n\nJerry Coyne\n\n#1386\n\nOverall Influence\n\n1949 - Present (75 years)\n\nAreas of Specialization: Ecology, Evolution\n\nJerry Coyne is professor emeritus at the University of Chicago for the Department of Ecology and Evolution. He earned a BS in biology from the William & Mary. He was drafted while attending graduate school at Rockefeller University, but returned to his studies upon his return, earning a PhD in biology from Harvard University. He went on to a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, Davis. He is an expert in speciation and ecological and evolutionary genetics.\n\nHe has been a vocal critic of religion, intelligent design, theistic evolution, and creationism, and has authored several books on the topic, including Faith vs. Fact: Why Science and Religion are Incompatible. As evidence for the truth of evolution, he cites the fossil record, embryology, molecular biology, the existence of vestigial organs (in humans as well as other creatures), biogeography, and DNA sequencing similarities. He also cites the existence of transitional fossils such as ambulocetus, which represents a transition between land mammals and whales, and the Tiktaalik, which represents a transition between fish and amphibians.\n\nLearn more about Jerry Coyne\n\n#22\n\nNiles Eldredge\n\n#823\n\nOverall Influence\n\n1943 - Present (81 years)\n\nAreas of Specialization: Evolutionary Biology\n\nNiles Eldredge is a biologist and paleontologist. He studied Latin and geology as an undergraduate before earning a PhD at Columbia University. His career and research have been devoted to the exploration of paleontology and evolutionary theory.\n\nAs curator of the American Museum of Natural Historyâs Department of Invertebrates, and later, Invertebrate Paleontology, he specialized in the study of the evolution of Phacopida trilobites, which went extinct roughly 245 million years ago.\n\nA critic of the more common, gene-centered, view of evolution, he and collaborator Stephen Jay Gould have hypothesized that evolution occurs via multiple mechanisms, including environmental and ecological systems. Their theory, punctuated equilibrium, states that evolution occurs in shorter periods of accelerated change, separated by periods of stasis. His theoretical approach situates the evolutionary process within the historical and ecological context.\n\nLearn more about Niles Eldredge\n\n#23\n\nMasatoshi Nei\n\n#4723\n\nOverall Influence\n\n1931 - 2023 (92 years)\n\nAreas of Specialization: Evolutionary Biology\n\nMasatoshi Nei is a Carnell Professor with the department of biology at Temple University. An evolutionary biologist, he studied at both Kyoto University and the University of Miyazaki.\n\nHe has been prolific in the development of the statistical theory of molecular evolution, developing new theories as new discoveries in molecular biology emerge. He has worked at institutions such as Brown University, National Institute of Radiological Sciences and Kyoto University, advancing his understanding of how mutations can drive evolution.\n\nHe is famous for mathematically demonstrating how natural selection enhances linkage intensity and his measure of genetic distance (Neiâs distance). He has written numerous books about his research, including Molecular Population Genetics and Evolution, Molecular Evolutionary Genetics, and Mutation-Driven Evolution. Nei holds the view that mutation is the driving force for evolution and that multi-gene families evolve through a model that looks like a birth-death process. With his group of researchers, he invented a method for identifying positive selection by statistical analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions.\n\nLearn more about Masatoshi Nei\n\n#24\n\nStuart Kauffman\n\n#800\n\nOverall Influence\n\n1939 - Present (85 years)\n\nAreas of Specialization: Biochemistry\n\nStuart Kauffman is an emeritus professor of biochemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, an affiliate faculty member for the Institute of Systems Biology, a medical doctor, theoretical biologist, and researcher of complex systems. He earned his BA at University of Oxford and an MD at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nAmong his best-known work has been his exploration of the complexity of biological systems and the origins of the Earth. He built the N-K fitness landscapes model, which expanded upon the spin glass physics models. His N-K fitness landscapes have since been used by biologists and economists to understand systems behaviors.\n\nHe is a prolific writer, with over 350 articles to his credit, as well as 6 books, including At Home in the Universe: The Search for Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity, The Origins of Order: Self Organization and Selection in Evolution, and Humanity in a Creative Universe.\n\nLearn more about Stuart Kauffman\n\nHonorable Mentions in Biology\n\nElizabeth Blackburn, University of California, San Francisco\n\nGeorge M.
