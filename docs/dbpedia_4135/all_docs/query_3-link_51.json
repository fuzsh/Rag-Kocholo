His major interest is in the development of vaccines for neglected diseases of poverty, in addition to coronavirus vaccines. Together with his science co-partner, Dr. Maria Elena Bottazzi they led the development of a low-cost patent-free COVID19 vaccine technology that led to the production and distribution of CORBEVAX (India) and INDOVAC (Indonesia) administered to almost 100 million people to date. For this work they were nominated for the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize. In addition to his vaccine development efforts, Prof. Hotez has led national and global efforts to combat antivaccine activism. This began when he wrote about his daughter with autism and intellectual disabilities and his book with Johns Hopkins University Press, “Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism”. His forthcoming book in 2023 also with JHU Press is entitled, “The Deadly Rise of Antiscience”. Prof. Hotez is the author of more than 650 scientific papers indexed on PubMed and 5 single author books. He is an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine and American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and he has been honored by the AMA and AAMC among other organizations. He previously served as US Science Envoy in the Obama Administration. During the pandemic he appeared regularly on cable news and radio outlets and podcasts to educate the public about COVID-19 and vaccinations.\n\nEsper Kallas, MD\n\nDirector, Butantan Institute\n\nFull Professor, Department of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil\n\nDr. Kallas is the Director of Butantan Institute, located in São Paulo, Brazil, and a Full Professor at the Department of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
