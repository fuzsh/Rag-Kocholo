        "text": "Sydney Brenner was born in Germiston, South Africa and is a molecular biologist who since 1957 has worked in Cambridge University laboratories. He played a significant role in the discovery and understanding of the genetic code of DNA. He was also part of the scientific team that introduced mRNA in 1961.\n\nHe met James Watson and Francis Crick who published the first paper explaining the structure of DNA. Brenner and Crick were to become the two most important figures in determining the general nature of the genetic code. Brenner's main contribution to genetics was his theoretical proof that the codons must be read one after another and shouldn’t overlap as an overlapping code would put restrictions on the amino acid sequences. In 1961 Brenner was working together with Crick, François Jacob, and Matthew Meselson, and made his best-known contribution to molecular biology when they discovered the messenger RNA (mRNA). For this, Brenner received numerous honours which included the Albert Lasker Medical Research Award in 1971.\n\nLater on, Brenner conducted another award-winning research project, where he diagrammed and mapped the entire genome of the worm C.elegans. This breakthrough research led Brenner to new discoveries concerning sex determination, brain chemistry, and programmed cell death. He was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2002 with H. Robert Horvitz and John E. Sulston for their discoveries concerning genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death\n\nCited from World of Microbiology and Immunology COPYRIGHT 2003 The Gale Group Inc\n\nRaj Ramesar is Professor and Head of the Division of Human Genetics at the University of Cape Town. His research is focused on disease susceptibility in African populations, where he is the Director of the MRC Human Genetics Research Unit. He is also directorof CANSA’s Colorectal Cancer Research Consortium. The biodiversity of the African population has led to him starting a research programme called Heritage, which crosses academic boundaries and celebrates origins and diversity, while using the opportunity to identify those genomic fragments that predispose people to disease. Apart from being on the editorial board of several international journals, Ramesar serves on the Executive Board of the African Society of Human Genetics, and is its Liaison Officer to the International Federation of Human Genetics Societies. He is also Chairman of the Africa Genome Education Institute. His work as Director of the Cancer Association of South Africa's National Colorectal Cancer Research Consortium involves translating sophisticated molecular genetic research for application to rural and indigenous communities. Professor Ramesar was awarded the UCT Vice-Chancellor's Alan Pifer Award (2009) for his research in this regard.\n\nhttp://h3africa.org/component/contact/contact/13-principal-investigators/27-professor-raj-s-ramesar\n\nhttp://www.humangenetics.uct.ac.za/hg/division/staff/principal/ramesar\n\nProf Rob Warren holds a PhD in Biochemistry from the University of Cape Town and is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Medical Biochemistry at Stellenbosch University. His research focuses on novel strategies to reduce the time-to-detection period of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and also to better understand the causative agents of the disease.\n\nIn an attempt to improve current TB diagnosis methods, Prof Warren and his team at the Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Tuberculosis Research, have embarked on a number of studies, including the development of a wind-up microscope fitted with a light emitting diode (LED). The microscope is energy efficient and can be used in rural areas where there is no power supply.\n\nOther research which was patented and published , focuses on a molecular-based approach to the rapid speciation of mycobacteria. By means of PCR amplification of the DNA that is present and absent in different species, it is possible to differentiate between TB and other members of the same complex. The value of this research is that it allows the identification of human TB in wild animals and the discovery of potentially novel species of mycobacteria.\n\nhttp://www.innovus.co.za/pages/posts/professor-rob-warren-tuberculosis-213.php\n\nDr Janine Scholefield is part of the gene expression and biophysics research group headed by Dr Musa Mhlanga at the CSIR. She completed her PhD in human genetics at the University of Cape Town, then went to the University of Oxford for three years as a Nuffield Medical Fellow, where she worked with many international experts to perfect the technique of creating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).\n\nThe team of researchers at CSIR generated the first induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in Africa. The ability to grow these stem cells has transformed the way that researchers are able to investigate and understand diseases. It also holds very big promises in what is known as 'regenerative medicine': growing new tissue to replace diseased tissue in sick individuals. Dr Janine Scholefield, one of the key CSIR researchers involved in generating iPSCs, recorded video footage of rhythmically beating cells through a microscope. The beating pattern is distinctive, and easily recognisable as heart muscle cells. These cells didn't come from a heart but were transformed into heart cells, from skin cells taken from an adult. This is the basis of iPSC technology, which induces adult cells to return back into stem cells, which are cells at the earliest stage of life.\n\nInformation from http://ntww1.csir.co.za/plsql/ptl0002/PTL0002_PGE157_MEDIA_REL?MEDIA_RELEASE_NO=7524909"
