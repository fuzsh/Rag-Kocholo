        "text": "EuropeâAcademia Europaea\n\nThe Academy of Europe, founded in 1988, honors those scientists and scholars as members who âcollectively aim to promote learning, education, and research.â The Academy is made up of âleading experts from the physical sciences and technology, biological sciences and medicine, mathematics, the letters and humanities, social and cognitive sciences, economics, and the law.âIn order to produce technical reports of this magnitude, the Academy collaborates with national academies of science in EU countries through the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC). The goal of the Academy is to eventually obtain an advisory role for social sciences and humanities, not only for the EU, but also the Council of Europe.\n\nDavid Robert Brown, ScD, MS, BS, Academy of Europe\n\nSir Philip Cohen, PhD, Academy of Europe\n\nAlan H Hall, MD, Academy of Europe\n\nBrian Patrick Johnson, PhD, Academy of Europe\n\nPaolo Preziosi, PhD, Academy of Europe\n\nDavid E Williams, PhD, DABT, Academy of Europe\n\nRobert A Young, PhD, DABT, Academy of Europe\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe Academy of Medical Sciences Award is an award that is given to Fellows at the Academy of Medical Sciences in the United Kingdom based on the excellence of their science, their contributions to medicine and society, and the range of their achievements.

Given every year, the medal is the oldest Royal Society medal still awarded, and probably the oldest surviving scientific award in the world, having first been given in 1731.\n\nJohn E Walker, Sr, FRS, Copley Medal\n\nFrance\n\nThe Grande MÃ©daille of French Academy of Science was established in 1977 and is awarded annually to a researcher who has contributed in a substantial manner to the advancement of science. The prize may go to a French national or to a foreign scientist, who has contributed in some remarkable and decisive way to progress in his/her field.\n\nJack H Dean, PhD, ScD, DABT, ATS, Grande MÃ©daille (Chevalier)\n\nJapan\n\nThe Japan Prize is a prestigious international award presented to individuals whose original and outstanding achievements are not only scientifically impressive, but have also served to promote peace and prosperity for all mankind. The Prize is awarded by the Japan Prize Foundation. Since its inception in 1985, the Foundation has awarded 81 people from 13 countries. In principle, the award is intended for a single person but small groups of researchers are also eligible. The person must be alive to be named a Japan Prize Laureate.\n\nSang-Tae Kim, PhD, DABT, ATS, ERT, Japan Prize\n\nJapan\n\nThe Keio Medical Science Prize gives recognition to the outstanding and creative achievements of researchers in the fields of medicine and life sciences, in particular those contributing to scientific developments in medicine. This international prize is designed to promote worldwide advances in medicine and life sciences, to encourage the expansion of researcher networks throughout the world, and to contribute to the well-being of humankind.\n\nLeroy Hood, PhD, Keio Medical Science Prize\n\nSwitzerland\n\nThe Louis Jeantet Prize, was established in 1986 and is awarded annually to experienced researchers who have distinguished themselves in the field of biomedical research in Europe. The main fields of research that are promoted are physiology, biophysics, structural biology, biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology, developmental biology and genetics. The Louis-Jeantet Prize for medicine has notably supported outstanding work on immunology, virology, bacteriology, neurobiology and in clinical epidemiology. The Foundation rewards excellence. Several winners of the Louis-Jeantet Prize for medicine have subsequently been distinguished by the Nobel Prizes in physiology or medicine, or in chemistry.\n\nSir Philip Cohen, PhD, Louis Jeantet Prize\n\nAlan H Hall, MD, Louis Jeantet Prize\n\nUnited States\n\nThe National Academy of Medicine, formerly the Institute of Medicine is renowned for its research program, but it is also an honorific organization with more than 1,700 members and foreign associates who donate their time to put their knowledge and expertise to work for the nation's health. Each year, the full membership elects up to 65 new members and five foreign associates to the National Academy of Medicine. Members are elected for their excellence and professional achievement in a field relevant to the National Academy of Medicine's mission and for their willingness to participate actively in its work. These individuals represent not only the health care professions but also the natural, social, and behavioral sciences, as well as law, administration, engineering, and the humanities. For those at the top of their field, membership in the National Academy of Medicine reflects the height of professional achievement and commitment to service.\n\nBruce A Beutler, MD, National Academy of Medicine\n\nLinda S Birnbaum, PhD, DABT, ATS, National Academy of Medicine\n\nThomas W Clarkson, PhD, National Academy of Medicine\n\nDavid L Eaton, PhD, ATS, National Academy of Medicine\n\nBernard D Goldstein, MD, ATS, National Academy of Medicine\n\nH Robert Horvitz, PhD, National Academy of Medicine\n\nMaureen Lichtveld, MD, MPH, National Academy of Medicine\n\nDonald R Mattison, MD, National Academy of Medicine\n\nRoger O McClellan, DVM, DABT, DABVT, ATS, National Academy of Medicine\n\nFerid Murad, National Academy of Medicine\n\nGilbert S Omenn, MD, PhD, National Academy of Medicine\n\nKenneth S Ramos, MD, PhD, ATS, National Academy of Medicine\n\nJim E Riviere, DVM, PhD, DSc, ATS, National Academy of Medicine\n\nTakashi Sugimura, MD, National Academy of Medicine\n\nSteven Robert Tannenbaum, PhD, National Academy of Medicine\n\nGerald N Wogan, PhD, National Academy of Medicine\n\nFrance\n\nThe National Order of Merit is an award that was founded by Charles de Gaulle in 1963 and rewards distinguished civil or military service. This order was created to avoid a too large number of members in the Order of the Legion of Honor. The Grand Master is the French President. This order has the same classes and dignities that the Legion of Honor has. SOT members who have been elected for services to sciences are:\n\nJean-Roger Claude, PhD, ERT, National Order of Merit (Chevalier)\n\nNancy D Claude, PhD, National Order of Merit (Chevalier)\n\nSweden\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine or Chemistry is an international award administered by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank established The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize. Each prize consists of a medal, personal diploma, and a cash award. A person or organization awarded the Nobel Prize is called Nobel Laureate. The word âLaureateâ refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In Ancient Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honor.\n\nBruce A Beutler, MD, Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nJohn B Gurdon, Kt, DPhil, DSc, FRS, Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nLee Hartwell, PhD, Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine or Chemistry\n\nH Robert Horvitz, PhD, Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine or Chemistry\n\nFerid Murad, Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine or Chemistry\n\nJohn E Walker, Sr, FRS, Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nEngland\n\nThe Royal Society of Chemistry is the largest organization in Europe for advancing the chemical sciences. Supported by a worldwide network of members and an international publishing business, our activities span education, conferences, science policy and the promotion of chemistry to the public. A designation of a Fellow is granted to those with substantial career progression who have made outstanding contributions to the advancement of chemical sciences. The Royal Society is supported by a worldwide network of members who carry the distinction of FRSC after their names.\n\nRao M Uppu, PhD, DABT, ATS, REHS, BCES, FRSC, AAAS Fellow, Royal Society of Chemistry\n\nUnited States\n\nThe Lasker Awards are among the most respected science prizes in the world. Since 1945, the Awards Program has recognized the contributions of scientists, physicians, and public servants who have made major advances in the understanding, diagnosis, treatment, cure, and prevention of human disease. Lasker Awards often presage future recognition by the Nobel committee, so they have become popularly known as âAmericaâs Nobels.â Eighty-three Lasker laureates have received the Nobel Prize, including 31 in the last two decades. The Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award honors scientists whose fundamental investigations have provided techniques, information, or concepts contributing to the elimination of major causes of disability and death.\n\nJohn B Gurdon, Kt, DPhil, DSc, FRS, The Lasker Awards\n\nLee Hartwell, PhD, The Lasker Awards\n\nLeroy Hood, PhD, The Lasker Awards"
