The Fire Blade[1] is the Alt Form Weapon of the Dialanche in Metroid Prime Hunters. By default, the Dialanche is encased in two pieces of sharp titanium.[2] When the Fire Blade is used, these rocky limbs are thrown out and orbit as "arms" around the Dialanche, in a similar fashion to the Vhoscythe's Spin Attack. This is a very effective close-quarters attack, as it attacks a full 360Â° around the Dialanche while rapidly dealing damage to any opponents. The power of each hit is not notable, but it makes up for this flaw with its attack rate and the fact that a single attack can hit twice, with each hit extending half of the Dialanche.

A downside of the Fire Blade is that the spinning rock "arms" disengage the Dialanche from any vertical surface, making it impossible for Spire to use it and climb a wall (as he normally would be able to) at the same time.
