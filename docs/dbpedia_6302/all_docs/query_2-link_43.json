I seriously can't remember any other car with a \"shape\" like that. :/\n\nNo there isn't and the Prowler ain't either, that was designed to resemble a hot rod and apart from the front wheels to an extend it shares no real similarity.\n\nTry the Suzuki GSX/4.\n\nDoesn't look similar, same sort of car though.\n\nI think both cars use motorcycle engines. The Fire Blade requires extensive suspension work but once dialed in it's fun to drive. Not as fun as the GSX-R4 though...\n\nAre there any cars in the game similar to this one???\n\nI'm talking about the looks just in case...\n\nThere's nothing really that similar to the Caterham, but I'd put forward the 1966 Shelby Cobra 427 for consideration.\n\nThe Gillet Vertigo started out IRL as a Lotus 7 replica (the same as the Caterham). Then extra bodywork was added over the wheels and a roof and it was made into a a race car.\n\nThe Caterham itself is fun on slippy tyres. Even at relatively low speeds you have to work at the wheel to get it to go where you want.\n\nAre there any cars in the game similar to this one???\n\nI'm talking about the looks just in case...\n\nno the Caterham company made their cars looks different from anything else\n\nThe Gillet Vertigo started out IRL as a Lotus 7 replica (the same as the Caterham). Then extra bodywork was added over the wheels and a roof and it was made into a a race car.\n\nForgot about that one, that's probably indeed the closest it gets regarding looks, at least the overall proportions are still very much Lotus 7/Caterham.\n\nThe Gillet Vertigo started out IRL as a Lotus 7 replica (the same as the Caterham).

Really?\n\nThey look similar? Really?\n\nI meant the closest you're gonna get in GT5, if you look closely at the overall dimensions of the Gillet (and the grille for example) and ignore the added bodywork you'll recognize its origins.\n\nIn the same way (albeit more instantly recognizable I'll admit) this Donkervoort D8 GT has Seven-origins.\n\nno the Caterham company made their cars looks different from anything else\n\nCaterham didn't design the 7, Lotus, or more specifically Colin Chapman did."
