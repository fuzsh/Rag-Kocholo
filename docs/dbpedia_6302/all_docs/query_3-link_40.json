        "text": "Recommended\n\nUses a Soulslike bonfire and progression system, with a parry based battle system somewhat reminiscent of Sekiro. Oozing with style, though hard to read enemy attacks can make fights feel spammy.\n\nNot Recommended\n\nIt's a marvel it was made by such a small team, and the shell system is a clever way to implement builds in a short game. Nonetheless, none of the weapons feel good and there's too much enemy spam.\n\nRecommended\n\nA short free game intended as a demo of sorts for Hellpoint. Not the most memorable, but it's a solid way to kill an evening.\n\nRecommended\n\nOnly a Soulslike in its checkpoint system, otherwise a 3D platformer with action adventure elements. Nonetheless a great feeling 3D platformer that isn't afraid to be quite difficult.\n\nRecommended\n\nCriminally underrated multiplayer duel game evocative of Souls PvP. Sadly the dev went under due to lack of sales, but even without updates the game is still kept online. Devs may make it open source.\n\nRecommended\n\nCombat is Sekiro meets Black Desert, in a battle royale. Has a more aggressive focus than Souls PvP but controls are similar. Overall a fun go-to multiplayer game, though the PvE mode is mediocre.\n\nRecommended\n\nI don't know where to put this one. There's too many cutscenes, exploration is boring, and the EA Play app. But hey, it's Sekiro in space and some of the boss battles are great.\n\nRecommended\n\nIt's just one boss battle, and not a particularly memorable one. But as a student project it's a good start, and for the price of free you really can't complain. Give it a try.\n\nRecommended\n\nThis game \"gets\" Dark Souls 1 and what made it great better than anyone else, even Fromsoft. It captures the same weightiness in combat, captures similar exploration, boss design. I adore it."
