        "text": "Even though the Big N has released five more consoles since the Super Nintendo, many Nintendo fans would say the SNES is still the best console that the House of Mario has ever released.\n\nMuch of the console’s success has to do with its roster of games, of course. From third-party titles to Nintendo’s own franchises, this was an era—from 1990 to 1996—that showcased the platform’s total dominance over the industry, even as the Sega Genesis proved to be a strong competitor—and we all know who won that console arms race in the end. It’s not difficult to see why: Super Mario World, Super Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past are the very best games in their respective series. And that’s not even counting games made by outside studios, such as Capcom and Konami.\n\nThere’s a lot more to the SNES library than just Mario, Samus, and Link, and more than two decades later, many of these games are still criminally overlooked. These are the 35 most underrated games on the SNES.\n\n*Note: This article has been updated since it was originally published to include entries 35-26\n\n35. E.V.O.: Search for Eden\n\n1993 │ Almanic\n\nImagine a video game where you control a small creature, use it to battle other creatures, and evolve it into stronger forms after gaining enough EXP. No, I’m not talking about Pokémon but a game that was released several years before it.\n\nE.V.O.: Search for Eden was a platformer RPG where players only had one goal: Survive. To do this, players have to bite, bash, and bludgeon their way past hostile creatures, and every victory net evolution points. Earn enough, and a creature could add or upgrade a body part that (usually) improved its capabilities. The number of combinations players could create was nearly endless, and the game encouraged experimentation through secret evolution paths. While E.V.O. was fairly grindy and repetitive, it’s worth playing just to see what kinds of patchwork chimera you can create. – Aaron Greenbaum\n\n34. The Lost Vikings\n\n1993 │ Silicon & Synapse\n\nBlizzard Entertainment is synonymous with titles such as Warcraft, Diablo, and StarCraft. But before Blizzard made those games (or was even known as “Blizzard Entertainment”), the company was better known for titles like The Lost Vikings.\n\nThe Lost Vikings was a comedic puzzle platformer where players controlled the three titular lost vikings: Erik the Swift, Baleog the Fierce, and Olaf the Stout. Each character had its own special abilities, and gamers had to use all three if they wanted to beat a level. While difficulty ramped up quickly in The Lost Vikings, players had unlimited continues, so they could keep trying over again as long as they wanted. The sequel, The Lost Vikings 2, was more of the same but with additional abilities and characters. Either title is worth your time if you can find it. – AG\n\n33. True Lies\n\n1994 | Beam Software\n\nThough the SNES was the home of a surprising number of surprisingly good games based on movies and TV shows, many of those titles went cruelly overlooked due to the bad taste that the worst games in that category left in our mouths. Though quite a few of those games were unsurprisingly based on Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, True Lies gave our greatest action hero the video game experience he always deserved to star in.\n\nTrue Lies is an overhead shooter that initially resembles something like Smash TV but is actually a little deeper than that. It certainly lets you shoot your way through waves of bad guys in surprisingly gory fashion, but the real star of the show is True Lies’ surprisingly engaging objectives and more labyrinthian levels. It’s honestly closer to a SNES version of Hotline Miami in some ways. Granted, its action isn’t nearly as refined as what you’ll find in the best Konami and Capcom titles of the era, but it’s a more than worthwhile experience in its own right. – Matthew Byrd\n\n32. Clock Tower\n\n1995 | Human Entertainment\n\nThough there are a few games on the SNES that boast great horror themes, Clock Tower is really the only SNES game I’d bother to call “scary.” Actually, this game’s genuinely scary nature and more methodical gameplay were likely two of the bigger reasons why it didn’t find much of an audience in 1995. By the time Resident Evil came along the next year, Clock Tower already felt like a historical footnote.\n\nWhile Clock Tower certainly shows its age these days, it remains a remarkably intriguing horror gaming experience. Built around a stalker system that sees protagonist Jennifer Simpson constantly try to escape the appropriately named Scissorman, Clock Tower maintains a welcome sense of dread that is bolstered by the game’s incredible gothic atmosphere. This game didn’t have all the answers, but it was certainly asking all the right questions. – MB\n\n31. Breath of Fire 2\n\n1995 │ Capcom\n\nWhile Squaresoft dominated the SNES JRPG scene with Final Fantasy, more than a few solid contenders popped up here and there, one of which was Capcom’s Breath of Fire. This RPG impressed audiences with its large world, memorable characters, and iconic dragon transformation system. But there’s always room for improvement.\n\nBarely a year after Breath of Fire’s launch, Capcom released Breath of Fire 2, which improved virtually every aspect of gameplay. Graphics pushed the limits of the SNES’ pixel fidelity, the story received much more attention, and combat was more tactical thanks to the addition of party formations. And, if you will pardon the pun, the soundtrack of Breath of Fire 2 was absolute fire in the best ways possible. It’s a shame Capcom has all but abandoned turn-based RPGs because we sure could do with a Breath of Fire resurrection. – AG\n\n30. Magic Sword\n\n1990 | Capcom\n\nOn the surface, Magic Sword should be significantly more popular than it actually is. A SNES action game made by Capcom with innovative mechanics, 50+ levels, and alternate endings? Why don’t we all know about this? Well, the truth of the matter is that this game’s visuals, animations, and sound didn’t quite survive the transition from arcade to SNES. On the surface, it’s a pretty rough experience.\n\nThe gameplay is sublime, though. Bolstered by an incredible partner system that lets you bring one of several companions into battle, Magic Sword falls somewhere between a beat-em-up and a Contra-like side-scroller. Its action is satisfying, its difficulty is surprisingly well-tuned, and for a game with this many levels, it features a surprising variety of enemies, backdrops, and themes. It’s not an all-time classic, but it’s a fantastic time. – MB\n\n29. Demon’s Crest\n\n1994 │ Capcom\n\nBefore Capcom became synonymous with the survival horror of Resident Evil, it was known as the company behind the hand-blisteringly difficult Ghosts ‘n Goblins franchise. These games had many enemies, but none challenged and annoyed players quite like the demonic Firebrand. So Capcom’s developers thought to themselves, “Why not make him the star of his own game?”\n\nDemon’s Crest is the third and most polished title to feature Firebrand (Gargoyle’s Quest and Gargoyle’s Quest II for the Game Boy and NES, respectively, are the first and second). Demon’s Crest is a Metroidvania platformer that revolves around the titular Demon Crests. The more players find, the more abilities they unlock that not only change combat but also open up new paths in old levels. Demon’s Crest is slower and more methodical than Ghosts ‘n Goblins, but it’s every bit as challenging. – AG\n\n28. Brain Lord\n\n1994 | Produce!\n\nThe SNES’ collection of APRGs is generally underrated. While JRPGs understandably dominated the scene at that time, the best of those ARPGs often feel novel and refreshing to this day. Brain Lord doesn’t quite crack the top tier of that genre, but it is an immensely entertaining experience that holds up remarkably well to this day.\n\nBrain Lord focuses a bit more on the action side of the ARPG formula. Actually, it’s closer to a dungeon crawler or Zelda title in many respects. The game is constantly forcing you to navigate a surprisingly devious collection of puzzles and traps, though the satisfying combat and excellent dungeon designs keep things from becoming too frustrating too quickly. Brain Lord doesn’t break a lot of new ground, but it’s a fantastic ARPG for those who love this era of the genre and are looking for something geared towards a slightly more hardcore audience. – MB\n\n27. U.N. Squadron\n\n1991 │ Capcom\n\nUsually, you can judge a video game by its box art since it helps convey what the game is all about. However, that isn’t always true. Every so often, a box provides the wrong message. The art for U.N. Squadron, for instance, makes it look like a boring flight sim. In reality, it’s anything but boring.\n\nWhat gamers in the U.S. knew as U.N. Squadron was a side-scrolling shoot ‘em up originally called Area 88. Like many in its genre, U.N. Squadron was a fast and frantic shooter that threw plenty of enemies at players, but it set itself apart with variety and difficulty. Players could select different pilots, each with their own pros and cons, and upgrade their planes before each level. But most importantly, U.N. Squadron didn’t follow the stringent “get hit once, die and lose all your powerups” gameplay design of other shoot ‘em ups. Instead, it gave each plane a health bar, and players kept their weapons after death. As a result, the game was much more balanced and fair than your average shoot ‘em up without losing any of the spectacle or challenge. – AG\n\n26. Super Adventure Island II\n\nThe Adventure Island games are fun, but many of them are just “solid-to-very-good” action platformers with a little extra style to spare. With Super Adventure Island 2, though, developer Make Software, Inc. decided to try something really different. In the process, they created a kind of SNES masterpiece that has rarely been replicated.\n\nSuper Adventure Island 2 incorporates RPG and exploration elements not seen in the other Adventure Island games. It features upgrades, shops, an overworld map, and even a surprisingly deep series of minigames highlighted by a casino that lets you bet on creature foot races. It’s that all-too-rare kind of game that uses fundamentally satisfying action platforming gameplay as the basis for a slightly deeper experience. It’s very likely your favorite SNES game you’ve never played. – MB\n\n25. Saturday Night Slam Masters\n\n1993 | Capcom\n\nYou can communicate via radio with other characters from the film. Some of the characters will even try to impede your progress with bad advice. And when you head indoors, the game shifts to a first-person view as you collect ID cards. This is so much better than the typical movie cash-in that flooded the SNES library in the mid-‘90s. – CF\n\n10. Cybernator\n\n1993 | NCS Corp\n\nCybernator proves yet again that there are few things more cathartic than manning a giant mech and shooting the hell out of other mechs and robots. The developers at NCS Corp seemed to take real joy in taking this generic concept and pushing it to its full potential, with tight controls, vibrant graphics, and even a surprisingly strong soundtrack. Cybernator remains somewhat obscure even today, but it’s well worth picking up if you run across a cartridge in the wild. – CF\n\n9. Metal Warriors\n\n1995 | LucasArts\n\nAnd if you loved Cybernator, I’ve got great news for you because Metal Warriors is basically an unofficial sequel. While developed by a completely different company (the legendary LucasArts), Metal Warriors doubled down on everything that made Cybernator great, with more mechs, faster gameplay, and better graphics.\n\nThe game even featured the ability to exit your mech to get through certain areas. Some fans argue that Cybernator is the superior game, but Metal Warriors tweaked what made that game great just enough to edge out its unofficial predecessor. – CF\n\n8. Super Smash TV\n\n1992 | Williams\n\nBasically a twin-stick shooter before consoles came with analog sticks, Super Smash TV featured incredibly fast and intense gameplay. This nearly perfect port of the arcade version lets one or two players blow off steam by firing weapons at hundreds of enemies attacking them from all sides as part of a futuristic life-or-death TV show. Well, the 1999 setting seemed futuristic at the time. – CF\n\n7. Blackthorne\n\n1994 | Blizzard Entertainment\n\nBefore Blizzard built mega huge franchises like StarCraft, Warcraft, and Diablo, there was simply Blackthorne. But even back in 1994, Blizzard seemed poised for greatness. What could have been another generic 16-bit shooter was actually a much deeper game, which required you search for keys in its giant, vibrant levels to progress. Even if you’ve never played the SNES version, Blackthorne is a free download on Battle.net now, so there’s no reason not to play it now. – CF\n\n6. Zombies Ate My Neighbors\n\n1993 | LucasArts\n\nBack in the day, LucasArts was actually known for a lot more than cranking out Star Wars games and dysfunctional development cycles. The developer used to make really innovative games like Zombies Ate My Neighbors, a top-down shooter with tons of weapons, ranging from water guns to bazookas. And it had real personality, too.\n\nZombies contained nods to numerous classic horror movies, and despite the title, monsters included enemies like squidmen, blobs, and even giant demon babies. This is also one of the more difficult games of the 16-bit era, but it’s well worth experiencing just for the creativity on display alone. – CF\n\n5. Actraiser\n\n1991 | Quintent\n\nFew games have ever pulled off the merging of two completely disparate genres into one like Actraiser did. Yes, much of the game is a solid, though not especially memorable platformer, but those sections are squeezed between a really interesting city-building section where you basically play God (in fact, you were referred to as “God” in the Japanese version).\n\nEven though it seems like these two gameplay styles should have nothing to do with each other, it works remarkably well here. Actraiser is one of the finest, most memorable games on the SNES, and its sequel is worth checking out as well. – CF\n\n4. Shadowrun\n\n1993 | Beam Software\n\nThere was no shortage of traditional sword and sorcery RPGs on the SNES, so Shadowrun stands out specifically for its dark cyberpunk setting. While receiving mixed reviews upon release, Shadowrun’s image has been rehabilitated in recent years, with many players praising its deep conversation system and gameplay that mixes traditional table-top rules with 16-bit RPG action. Plus, the game’s film noir influences helps give it what’s quite possibly the best storyline of any SNES game. – CF\n\n3. Illusion of Gaia\n\n1994 | Quintent\n\nIllusion of Gaia is an action-RPG for gamers who want something different from their action-RPGs. While combat remains relatively simple, there are so many new ideas that work surprisingly well, like an experience system that de-emphasizes grinding and a simplified item system.\n\nThose might sound like bad ideas at first, but they work surprisingly well in the context of the game. Wrapped in some truly ingenious puzzles and one of the best stories of the 16-bit era, you’ll wonder why more games haven’t tried to copy Illusion of Gaia’s innovations. – CF\n\n2. Secret of Evermore\n\n1995 | Square Soft\n\nSquare released so many great SNES games in the ‘90s that at least one of them had to fall through the cracks. Secret of Evermore is unique among Square titles, as the only game ever released by the company that was designed by Americans. This meant a more westernized art style, and a focus on traditional tropes of American storytelling, like the adventure of a boy and his dog.\n\nBut you can also see a lot of the Square influence at play here too, with combat extremely similar to Secret of Mana (though the two titles are officially unrelated). Evermore may never quite meet the heights of Mana, but it’s still worth tracking down to see how a Square game would turn out with a stronger western influence. – CF\n\n1. Harvest Moon\n\n1997 | Amccus\n\nOn paper, Harvest Moon sounds like the worst game ever. You inherit a farm. You grow crops and take care of livestock. If you’re particularly successful, you get married, too. But anyone who has played a Harvest Moon game knows that while this sounds about as exciting as watching paint dry, it’s actually incredibly addicting watching your farm grow.\n\nWhile later games in the series included much more customization, the SNES original is still one of the most relaxing games around, and well worth a playthrough for anyone looking for something a little bit simpler than saving the world. – CF"
