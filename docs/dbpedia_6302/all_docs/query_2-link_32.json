        "text": "Flame blade has a duration of concentration, up to 10 minutes, while flaming sphere has a duration of concentration, up to 1 minute and shillelagh a duration of one minute (no concentration).\n\nFlame blade provides 3d6 magical fire damage using your Wisdom modifier (melee spell attack) for 10 minutes. This could potentially span two or three combats (likely, if you're in a tightly packed dungeon), and allows you to use other spells or cantrips as you please as long as they don't require concentration.\n\nFlaming sphere, on the other hand, typically lasts no longer than one combat (10 rounds at most), and uses the same level spell slot as flame blade.\n\nWe can do the math and see that economically, when the hit ratio is the same (as you have pointed out in your question), flaming sphere does only 1d6 avg \"guaranteed\" damage, and can only do that 10 times. I say \"guaranteed\" because it only does damage when it rams an enemy or when an enemy stops within 5 feet of it, and the enemy still gets a save against it. You can control when it rams an enemy, you can't control when an enemy stops near it.\n\nOn the other hand, flame blade can hit for 3d6 (that's an additional 4 average damage over flaming sphere if the target fails its save), and it can do it 10 times as many times. At an average of 11 damage and assuming a perfect hit ratio and attacking every round, that's 1100 potential damage over 10 minutes. Flaming sphere, on the other hand, can do 70 at most (and under perfect conditions, with everything going just right, 560 total avg damage).\n\nFinally, flame blade has utility beyond being a weapon: it also produces light that can be dismissed at will and evoked using a bonus action while the spell is still within its casting duration. This is more useful than the light provided by flaming sphere, which in this case burns twice as bright but only a tenth as long.\n\nThe proposed changes work well in practice, our druid uses it sometimes\n\nDmg283 says about spell design:\n\nIf a spell is so good that a caster would want to use it all the time, it might be too powerful for its level.\n\nThis is definetely not the case, so it is not too powerful.\n\nI consider the opposite also true:\n\nif a spell is so bad that a caster would never want to use it, it might not be powerful enough for its level.\n\nI think this was a clear sign Flame Blade was too weak earlier.\n\nThe question can be reduced to this:\n\nIs 2 damage per round worth your concentration?\n\nMy answer is: clearly, NO\n\nHow not to calculate expected damage\n\nClaiming that you can calculate expected damage by multiplying damage/round with duration is like saying you can cover 1000 miles in ten hours if your car's top speed is 100 mph. Yes, It is a theoretical maximum, ou just have to completely ignore trafic, laws, your tank's and your bladder's capacity.\n\nIn other words, it is meaningless.\n\nFlame Blade will not last 10 minutes.\n\nYour Concentration is likely to get interrupted when you are in melee range. You might have to stop it voluntarily, because the enemy wants to run away, and you need Entangle to stop it, or it turns invisible, and you need Faerie Fire to enable your party (and yourself) to hit it more reliably.\n\nEquivalent spell\n\nTake a 4th level Druid, with a Wisdom of 18. On average, he can do 10.5 damage with Flame Blade, or 8.5 with Shillelagh.\n\nWould it be efficient of him to cast an imaginary spell Inferno Staff, that requires concentration, lasts up to 10 minutes, adds 2 damage to Shillelagh and turns the damage type to fire? Spending one third of his highest level slots on something this negligible, while tying up his concentration looks a really bad deal.\n\nAt 8th level the damage bonus of Inferno Staff is effectively reduced to 1, if the Druid inceases his Wisdom.\n\nAt this point he clearly is much better off with casting Faerie Fire or Entangle, even if they last much shorter. Your DPR increase is much higher through Advantage, and these spells help your allies too."
