        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nbinjjo\n\n70%Emulated\n\n18h 5m Played\n\nFE6 is a chronological sequel to FE7, and the two games share a lot of characters, music, and maps with each other. Since it was never released in the US, a fan translated rom is the only way for English speakers to experience this game, of which I found the translation to be very good. Aside from a few minor differences, Binding Blade is virtually identical to its predecessor in terms of gameplay, but there were some clear improvements made in the succeeding title that remedied annoyances, such as the inability to use items during preparations.\n\nAll of the chapters are seize missions, but the lack of route enemy and defend maps is sort of a relief here. Enemy reinforcements can move immediately after spawning, which can lead to some really cheap deaths, and the seemingly endless waves of them make some maps much more frustrating than they need to be. Needless to say, punishing the player for not knowing when these enemies will appear is just absurd, and I find this to be the biggest flaw of Binding Blade.\n\nThere are two instances of branching paths that result in different chapters, both of which are easy to attain with prior knowledge of the credentials. A huge cast of characters adds to an already high replay value, but there are a lot of really bad units in this game; many come to you at level 1 when your army will average much higher, and some wouldn’t be very good even in the first few chapters. In terms of story, it’s Fire Emblem: backhanded nobles, underdog armies, etc., just general fare for the series. I found the epilogue to be a little underwhelming, as each character only gets a very short quip of their life after the game’s events, many of which are the same as others.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nChorophobe\n\n70%Game Boy Advance\n\n56h 27m Played\n\nThis game has the same great core gameplay that makes me love pretty much all the fire emblem games but 6 has its own unique quirks that make it one of my lesser appreciated in the series.\n\nI played Binding blade after playing the 3 games that came after it and I can't help but notice that they had many great ideas in binding blade that didn't fully get figured out until the later games. Binding blade Shares the same tactical strategy backbone that all the other games share, with the rock-paper-scissors weapon mechanics and challenging difficulty. But the lighter emphasis on story, weaker characters, and tedious or outright unfair at times battle design make this entry in the series one of the harder ones to get into.\n\nBinding blade is the tale of a war that sweeps the continent of Elibe. The Kingdom of Bern invades its surrounding territories for no known reason, but they conquer everything in the intro to the story because of the might they bring with them into battle: Dragons that have been brought back from a 1000 year disappearance after a war in the past known as the Scouring. Enter Roy, a 15 year old boy and son of the Marquess of one of the invaded territories, Pherae. He is met at the start of the story by the princess of Bern, sister to the invading king, who wishes to aid the territories Bern is attacking and bring a peaceful end to the unnecessary war started by her mad brother.\n\nAlong the journey, Roy fights many battles throughout the continent, bringing a variety of map design and level gimmicks that keep the challenge on an increasingly upward curve throughout the experience. The issues that I found with the game however, are wholly in the implementation of its map design and main Lord, Roy himself. Every single mission in Binding Blade have the same win condition of traversing a large map with the entire army, and fighting a boss at the end and seizing the throne with Roy. The reason why this is such a problem is the that every map becomes linear, and a bit stale. The units who have lest movement range get left behind in the dust as your army advances, and that includes Roy himself who is one of the slower moving units in the game.\n\nWhile most units in Fire Emblem games are able to change classes at some point and gain a massive stat boost and even movement boost, this is the case for every unit in the game except thieves, and Roy himself. Roy remains, for al but the very endgame of Binding Blade, capped to level 20 with weaker stats than the rest of your army or even the majority of enemy units in the last half of the game. The game turns into babysitting Roy as you escort him through the latter half of the game.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, game often throws enemy reinforcements at you that spawn and move in the same turn, which can result in you losing units who get attacked from behind with no warning or way to prepare for them. While the game is generous with replacement units, it is always unsatisfying to lose a unit due to something you can't even see coming and most players will reset when such a death occurs.\n\nWhere Binding blade does stand out though, is in it's scale. you go from small battles against bandits and turncoats to leading an army across the continent in search of the means to end the war and restore peace to the land. There are many challenges along the way, and although the characters and motivations for such are only surface level, The game is satisfying enough to see through to the end and not feel let own by the climax if you played your cards right.\n\nThere is however a pretty specific set of requirements to see the true ending, and I would recommend looking up what to do to not miss it, as the game's alternative end is somewhat of an anticlimax.\n\n75/100"
