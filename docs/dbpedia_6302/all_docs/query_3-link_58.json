        "text": "Blade and Sorcery: Nomad wouldn’t be half of the great game that it is without its amazing spell casting system. It’s at least half of the name after all. So if you’re wondering what spells and magic is available to you in Blade and Sorcery, read on to find all of the spells in Blade and Sorcery: Nomad, and how to use them.\n\nOh, and if you’re playing Blade & Sorcery on PCVR this guide will be a little out of date, but it will be updated when the Quest version catches up to PCVR version 1.0, which added the Crystal Hunt game mode.\n\nHow To Use Spells in Blade & Sorcery\n\nTo use Blade & Sorcery: Nomad spells, hold the “A” key on one of your controllers when you aren’t holding anything in that hand. You’ll see a magical looking circle appear around your hand with three smaller circles forming a triangle around it. Move your hand over one of these circles and release the “A” key to select that type of magic.\n\nTo now use that magic spell, hit the trigger button on that hand, and a ball with your chosen magic will appear in it. Keep in mind that you can select different types of magic with each hand, or the same with both.\n\nYou can do a lot with this ball of magic, depending on what type you selected. You can also combine a spell with both hands by holding a magical ball in either hand together to create an impressive effect. Spells can be combined with weapons to give them magical effects by holding the magic ball over the head of the weapon.. Spells can also be combined with magical staves by holding the ball over the crystal at the top of the staff, and then you can then use that spell by pressing the “A” key with whichever hand is holding that staff.\n\nEach type of spell does different things with each of these actions, and we’ll go over the three types of spells and what they do here. Also keep in mind that weapons and staves run out of magical energy after you use them, so you’ll have to recharge them with the spell again. You can tell when this happens when the glow of the magic fades from the item.\n\nOne last thing though, you can’t use spells as much as you want. You only have a certain amount of mana, which will get used up the more you use magic. Don’t worry though, mana will regenerate on its own pretty quickly. You can check how much mana you have by turning your wrist inwards towards your face. It’s the blue part of the circle, and your health is the red part of the circle.\n\nGravity\n\nGravity is definitely the most unique type of magic in Blade and Sorcery: Nomad. Unlike Fire and Lightning gravity magic can be used even without forming a ball of magic with the trigger button. A hand with the Gravity spell selected can be used to pick up an enemy by a limb or the neck from afar. All you need to do is point your hand and wait for the grabbing symbol to appear over the body part, just like you would see when picking up an item in Blade and Sorcery.\n\nLightning\n\nThe lightning spell puts the power of electricity at your fingertips. It’s very good for not only damaging, but stunning and debilitating enemies. If you form a ball of lighting in your hand and point it at an enemy it will damage and make them stand in place while being electrocuted if it touches their skin or conductive armor like plate. Though be careful that the lighting doesn’t just latch on to their weapon, which will cause it to become electrified (more on that later).\n\nFire\n\nFire magic makes up the most directly damage dealing Blade and Sorcery spells of them all. Though they don’t offer as much utility or crowd control as the others, fire spells are great damage dealers at range. For instance, using a ball of fire with a single hand will cause a little fireball to jump forward out of your palm. You can even direct it in flight by moving the hand that fired it. Hitting an enemy with this fireball will knock them back and deal significant damage."
