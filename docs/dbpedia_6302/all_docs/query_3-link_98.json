        "text": "Blade Ball Lunar update has introduced a powerful element you can choose in Element mode. Here's a list of all Dragon abilities, what they do, and how to unlock it in the Element mode.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAll Dragon element abilities in Blade Ball\n\nIt's still too early to crown the ultimate Roblox Blade ball element, but the Dragon element has the early lead. The main reason is the Dragon Guardian ability that protects you against balls. You can devour opponents and significantly improve your defense by using powerful Dragon skills. These abilities make Dragon one of the favorite characters in Elemental mode.\n\nRelated: Blade Ball Continuity Zero Ability Guide\n\nHow to unlock the Dragon element character in Blade Ball\n\nTo unlock the Dragon element in Blade Ball, you must complete limited-time quests until February 29, 2024. This way, you'll unlock Dragon rewards, with the last one being the Dragon element! While you'll find some quests challenging, completing them will allow you to get one of the best elemental abilities in Blade Ball for free!\n\nAlthough you don't need Robux, you'll still have to upgrade your Dragon skills to beat other players in the Element mode. If you're having an issue choosing this skill after the unlock, ensure your current Element character has fully updated abilities. After you accomplish that, you'll be able to change your character."
