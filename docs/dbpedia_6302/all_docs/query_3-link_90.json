        "text": "Diablo 4: Season of the Infernal Hordes is here, and it brings with it some of the final changes to the game ahead of its first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, which launches Oct. 8. This season, season 5, is shorter than the previous four, but adds plenty to the game for both Seasonal and Eternal Realm players.\n\nBelow, we’ll highlight some major changes to the game before giving you the full patch notes for Diablo 4 update 1.5.\n\nThe Infernal Hordes\n\nThe Infernal Hordes is a brand new endgame activity in Diablo 4, and is designed to be both replayable and rewarding (loot-wise). It takes place in the pit of Hell itself — an area players haven’t gotten to spend much time in since the game’s original campaign — and will let players choose helpful boons to keep the gameplay interesting run after run.\n\nA rework for Unique items\n\nAfter Diablo 4: Loot Reborn, season 4, Unique and Uber-Unique items have fallen out of style. But with season 5, Blizzard has tuned every Unique in the game to be far more powerful than before. While you still can’t Temper their affixes, each Unique’s affix has been juiced to the limit. Most players expect Unique items to make a big impact on builds this season.\n\nTwo new questlines\n\nAs always, there is a seasonal questline in Season of the Infernal Hordes that tells a small but meaningful story in the world of Diablo. But this time there’s also a new questline to introduce the Infernal Hordes, which will send players to mini-dungeons that will teach the basics of the mode. The first questline is exclusive to the season, but the Infernal Hordes quests will stick around forever in the Eternal Realm.\n\nMajor class rebalancing\n\nSince Diablo 4 launched, it’s been the Barbarian show for nearly every season. This is because Barbarians have more item slots than any other class; they can equip four weapons simultaneously. This advantage has enabled Barbarians to significantly overperform compared to the other classes for the past year. But Blizzard is finally fixing this issue, and its devs have rebalanced the stats of all the non-Barbarian classes so that they can finally stand a chance in the “best class” tier lists.\n\nDiablo 4 Patch 1.5 notes\n\nBelow, we’ve listed out the complete patch notes for the Season of the Infernal Hordes Diablo 4 update.

Trembling Hands, Blackened Femurs, and Gurgling heads have been removed from the game. Eternal Characters that have the other body parts can convert them to hearts at the Alchemist.\n\nBoss Ladder bosses no longer drop Rare items. They now drop additional Gold instead of Rare items.\n\nTormented Bosses\n\nDeveloper’s Note: The goal of these changes is to broaden the chances of acquiring Mythic Unique Items. Now, players can engage with whatever Tormented Boss they have the materials for in their quest to find a Mythic Unique.\n\nTormented Bosses now drop 5 times as many Boss Materials.\n\nRebalanced Tormented Boss loot to have parity with each other.\n\nAll Tormented Bosses have 5 chances to drop a mythic at 1.5% chance each. In total, a 7.5% chance to drop a Mythic Unique. The resulting effect of this change is that the bosses have a chance to drop multiple Mythic Uniques instead of just 1.\n\nThe cost to summon a Tormented boss had been reduced from 2 Stygian Stones to 1.\n\nHelltide\n\nThe way baneful hearts are earned has been adjusted.\n\nChance to get one from a Tortured gift starts at 15% and increases each time you fail to get one.

It resets to 1%.\n\nHelltide Commanders always drop a heart.\n\nA World Boss spawned in an active Helltide Zone will drop 3 Hearts.\n\nLocal Event chests have a small chance to grant hearts when achieving Mastery.\n\nThreat gain now consistently scales with the health of slain monsters.\n\nHelltide Whispers\n\nThey only spawn in one subzone.\n\nThese Whispers will always add up to equal 10 Grim Favors’.\n\nIcons have been updated to be consistent with other Whispers.\n\nCull Demons now includes Fallen.\n\nCull Fallen replaced with Cull Cultists.\n\nProfane Mindcages return in Season of the Infernal Hordes!\n\nThey always drop from Hellborne.\n\nCan be stacked up to 3 times.\n\nOnly available in the Seasonal Realm.\n\nIn World Tiers I & II, the Blood Maiden now requires only two Baneful Hearts to summon.\n\nTortured Gift chests in World Tiers I & II now require 75 Cinders instead of 100 to open.\n\nLoot Rewards\n\nResplendent Spark awards for defeating Tormented bosses can now be earned separately on both Hardcore and non-Hardcore modes.\n\nResplendent Sparks and Scattered Prisms will no longer be automatically picked up. Additionally, these items can now be found in the lost items Stash if forgotten on the ground.\n\nUnique and Mythic Unique items can now be acquired from Whisper Caches, Purveyors of Curiosity, and Tortured Gifts in Helltide.\n\nThe chance to find Mythic Unique items through all non-boss means has been increased.\n\nTreasure Goblin drop quality has been improved.\n\nCan drop 1-3 Legendary items and 2-6 Rare items.\n\nDeveloper’s Note: The higher the number of Legendary Drops, the lower the number of Rare Drops. The opposite is also true. (Ex: If 2 Legendary items drop, then 4 Rare items will drop alongside.\n\nAdditionally Common Ore, Herbs, Leather, and Gem Fragments will always drop.\n\nTreasure Goblins can also drop Forgotten Souls in World Tiers III & IV.\n\nTreasure Goblins now have a 10/20/30% chance to drop 1-2 Scattered Prisms in World Tiers I & II/World Tier III/World Tier IV.\n\nTreasure Goblins drop 1-2 Elixirs.\n\nGold drop increased (Ex: Level 1 in World Tier I: 40k Gold. Level 100 in World Tier IV: 150k Gold).\n\nUser Interface and User Experience\n\nFloating Combat Text has been updated to be more consistent and be more legible.\n\nSettings for Floating Combat Text have been added to allow players to further customize what sort of floating text they want to see.\n\nThe Stats window now has a highlight for when the Armor Cap has been reached.\n\nThe sections in the Stats window can now be collapsed and expanded as desired.\n\nMythic Unique Items now have new visual effects and have a unique look in the Inventory for them to stand out more.\n\nLegendary Aspects can now be favorited and filtered while interacting with the Occultist.\n\nShift-clicking a skill will now add 5 points (or as many as possible) to it in the Skill tree.\n\nThe notification for unlocking and upgrading Aspects has been improved to be more prominent.\n\nA new setting has been added to display the Health and Resource bars above the player character’s head.\n\nMap pins dropped by party members now display a suggested path to match self-placed pins.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nFor this Season, Helltide Chests no longer contain Obols.\n\nDeveloper’s Note: Obols received from Helltide Chests were part of the Season 4: Loot Reborn Blessings only.\n\nThis season’s Nightmare Dungeon rotation remains the same as the previous season.\n\nWorld Bosses are now more resilient to damage.\n\nExperience rewards for side quests, including Priority Quests (Ex: Gem Crafting Quest) and Class Quests, have been increased.\n\nSkills that grant Immunity, e.g. Flame Shield and Blood Mist, now only go on cooldown once the Immunity effect ends.\n\nWe have made some updates to Crowd Control sources.\n\nHard Crowd Control from monsters now lasts 1.5 seconds on average, down from 2.5 seconds on average.\n\nThe maximum duration of monster hard Crowd Control is now 2 seconds.\n\nReworked some monster attacks that apply short hard Crowd Control effects frequently, so they no-longer chain these effects on players.\n\nAdditionally, Potions can now be used while Crowd Controlled.\n\nCertain tutorial quests, such as the quest for crafting a Gem, are now tracked account-wide for completion status.\n\nVarious Dungeons have had tweaks to their layouts to further streamline them.\n\nMore Weapon Types are now available to more Classes.\n\nDruids can now use Polearms, 1-handed Swords, and Daggers.\n\nNecromancers can now use Maces and Axes.

Instead, it requires the legendary crafting material for the item slot.\n\nJewelry: Abstruse Sigils\n\nWeapons: Baleful Fragments\n\nArmor: Coiling Wards\n\nWe increased the character level requirements for unlocking Smoldering Ashes in the Battle Pass.\n\nDeveloper’s Note: This change was necessary due to increased XP gain rates that were allowing players to reach the character level requirement for Smoldering Ashes before they reached the corresponding Tier in the Battle Pass. We want to avoid instances that allow players to purchase Tier Skips to gain the benefits from of the Smoldering Ashes ahead of players who aren’t purchasing them. We will continue to iterate on this system in future seasons.\n\nWe’ve increased the max level difference you can earn base monster experience from. The maximums have been updated:\n\nDeveloper’s Note: We wanted to properly reward players for pushing to a higher monster difficulty, especially since Profane Mindcages can now stack. With this change, max stacked Profane Mindcages should have an impact on experience gained.\n\nWorld Tier I and II: 3 to 30\n\nWorld Tier III: 6 to 30\n\nWorld Tier IV: 10 to 30\n\nExample of previous system at World Tier IV: A Level 60 player killing a Level 80 monster will reward experience equivalent of having killed a Level 70 monster.\n\nExample of current system at World Tier IV: A Level 60 player killing a Level 80 monster will receive experience appropriate for a Level 80 monster.\n\nBoss Health has been reduced across the game.\n\nBefore:\n\nWTI: 0%\n\nWTII: 4000%\n\nWTIII: 6500%\n\nWTIV: 30000%\n\nAfter:\n\nWTI: 0%\n\nWTII: 2000%\n\nWTIII: 4000%\n\nWTIV: 6000%\n\nPit Boss damage has been reduced by 66% across the board.\n\nShadow Pit Boss Affix attacks now apply a stacking damage debuff which stacks up to 3 times.\n\nAt the third and final stack, Pit Boss damage is the same as Loot Reborn.\n\nThe Bandit Sharpshooter boss has been replaced with Mother’s Judgement.\n\nDeveloper’s Note: We’ve made this change to reduce the amount of one-shots that happen when fighting bosses in the Pit. Players should have more room to get hit by boss attacks up to a certain point.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nAccessibility\n\nFixed an issue where the Screen Reader didn’t identify Paragon Nodes when navigating the Paragon Board on controller.\n\nGameplay\n\nBarbarian\n\nFixed an issue where Fury Regeneration would malfunction when assigning the Tactical Rallying Cry Upgrade.\n\nFixed an issue where the 5 second internal Cooldown for the Aspect of Ancestral Echoes was not listed in the Aspect’s description.\n\nFixed an issue where stack granted by the Aspect of Limitless Rage could be inconsistently acquired.\n\nFixed an issue where Charge could be used to bypass interaction channels, such as opening Helltide Chests.\n\nFixed an issue where Earthstrikers Aspect could waste its guaranteed Overpower trigger on autocast instances.
