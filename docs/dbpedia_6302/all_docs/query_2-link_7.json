        "text": "Hello! I present to you my ideas for the most powerful weapons in Sea of Thieves. The Sword of Souls, or now the Burning Blade Sword, now moves around the world only as an artifact not available to players, but I am sure that in the future the Reaper Bones will be able to steal this sword and complete its transformation in which LeChuck did not succeed. After reforging, the Burning Blade took on its true form, from which its blade was distorted into a crystal filled with Flameheart's rage and bad memories, and the hilt was modified to match the strength of this blade. Now the hilt uses a stone from the Devil's Roar and to restrain this power, skeleton runes are applied to the sword showing who its owner is, and the gray parts of the joints are replaced with tin from which Reaper masks are usually made. Concept design in the picture below\n\nWhen the Burning Blade is charged, its blade, the stones in the hilt and the skeleton symbols glow brightly indicating that it is ready for use. Inside the blade are moving fires similar to the ash dragons (same as in Masked Renegade Lantern) and also flames of bad memories come out of the blade causing the blade to burn.\n\n(gif)\n\nThere are 7 skeleton runes on the hilt of the sword, such as\n\nFlame\n\nHeart\n\nLord\n\nRitual\n\nKing\n\nCaptain\n\nBlade\n\nThe Burning Blade is capable of releasing the bad memories accumulated in it; to do this, you need to use a strong attack like a cutlass and then a flame similar to the fire from the Ashen wind skull will burst out of the blade, but along with the fire, ghostly memories attacking within the radius of the fire will burst out. This flame acts on the player in the same way as LeChuck's power did in Monkey Island Tall Tale, and it is the slowing effect that is applied to the player (the player is literally pulled to the ground) and does little damage like the Skulls of the Sirens' Song or even less. The flame attack cannot be used constantly; after 5-10 seconds of use, the sword goes into cooldown with a small chance of summoning a friendly ghost to the owner of the sword from 1 to 3 pieces. This ghost is also a memory (Just like Briggsy in the adventure) and interacts with the player in the same way as the bone caaller.\n\nApproximate Flame Attack (There should be a lot of screaming ghosts here):\n\nWhat friendly ghosts should look like:\n\nBut the power of the sword is not infinite. Over time, the sword will begin to lose strength and fade. The brightness of his Blade, stones in the handle and symbols will begin to decrease until they completely exhaust their power. The blade of the sword will begin to look like that of Rapier of the Ashen Dragon, and the symbols will fade out, revealing engraving cracks. Below is an example of a drained sword\n\nHe's starting to look like his original self.\n\nThe light from the symbols has disappeared"
