        "text": "The relationship between Spell Blade and the sword …\n\nHello. I would like to draw your attention to such a problem as the involvement of the class in its main weapon.\n\nIn modern realities, Spell can only use (due to the sheer superiority) Crystal Blade (from ordinary swords), which in my opinion is a big mistake in terms of gameplay and its variety.\n\nSee for yourself what% of all SpellBlade builds are built on Crystal Blade? Do you think this is correct?\n\nThe problem in my opinion is how the SpellBlade passive skills are organized, for the most part, they are not directly related to swords in any way, but only to specific parameters.\n\nAs a result, the sword with% of the element killed all other swords.\n\nI believe that it would be more correct to have an organization in which SpellBlade could choose different swords with equal efficiency, depending on his build.\n\nNot just one weapon for all occasions.\n\nQuick questions to the OP - and taking my usual devils advocate approach…\n\nYou have posted a LOT of different threads about your thoughts & criticisms of the spellblade design - everything from skills to gear synergies and the general mechanics of things like wards… In some cases you make valid points that would improve the class design based on the developers intended class theme and help it be more balanced with other classes in terms of pushing high corruptions etc. However, some of your other comments, imho, just come off as spellblade bashing and seem to want to dilute the niche quality of the spellblade character by making it less that its designed to be and more overlapping with the theme design of other classes…\n\nPersonally, I find the spellblade a brilliant, innovative class in LE and it works really well in the character thematic design of an elemental mage using melee. It works as fire, lightning and cold very well and barring a few tweaks here and there (some you have mentioned and I agree with) is more than capable of handling the end game. It has design based limitations around gear restrictions and various other intended limitations that the devs obviously implemented to suit that design theme… There are also lots of things that continually change to improve the class and yet remain within the design considerations - like for instance the addition of crystal swords only recently…\n\nThere are spellblades in Arena ladders clearing 300+ levels and people using Spellblades to farm 200+ corruption…\n\nSure, its not in the same leagues as the tanky boy Sentinels and other classes that clear 1000+ arena and 300+ corruption, but that is, imho, a balancing issue not a design issue.\n\nSo my question are this:\n\nDo you like the Spellblade class as a thematic melee elemental mage?\n\nAre you basing your comments & especially criticisms of the class in consideration of the thematic designs of the other classes - i.e. based on how the developers have intended the class to fit into the others… Obviously the devs have designed each class to fit a niche and thats how the game is intended - for better or worse - vs making each class very generic - something you seem keen on.\n\nHave you played any other classes to see if they suit the way you want Spellblade to work instead? e.g. perhaps a shaman or spell based sentinel would better match how you seem to be trying to mold a spellblade?\n\nHi. I apologize in advance, I use a translator, so I hope that I can correctly convey my thought.\n\nUnfortunately, there is some problem with SpellBlade’s perception. I’m not entirely sure that I understand correctly what the developers want to do, how they see the “ideal SpellBlade”.\n\nAs for me, for me the “perfect Spell” is an ordinary fragile magician who uses his will (intellect) to protect (through the Ward) and uses the sword as a catalyst (a conductor - tool) for his magic, in close combat.\n\nThat is, the Mage himself is a source of power, and not a magic sword (After all, it is the Mage who is the basis of the class, and not the warrior). Unlike the warriors, who use magic swords as a source of magic.\n\nBut in fact, looking at today’s Spell, at his strongest assemblies, he seems to me like an ordinary warrior who has a magic sword in his hands. Which is not much different from any warrior class that was given an element of damage.\n\nWhich doesn’t really have much connection to the sword, except for Gemini and a few skills, that is, very superficial. Spell Blade has a melee binding, but not a sword.\n\n(From that for example, Crystal Blade, I see it as an attempt to artificially create such a connection. He is more suitable for a warrior who plays with his weapons. In my opinion this is a mistake, the connection should be created through class skills, not items. But this is a personal opinion , I do not insist)\n\nAnd I can’t understand, it’s just errors in the balance, lack of content, or errors in the implementation of the idea, or maybe everything is correct, it should be, it’s just that I don’t perceive SpellBlade that way.\n\nIt’s unique to the mastery in LE.\n\nEHG did not invent a melee fighting mage.\n\nFir me personally the Spellblade exactly fits what I’d expect from the name. I’d even go further and say that it’s even more magic and less martial arts ninja style than I would have build the mastery around.\n\nIf I would ever create a Spellblade in a game, it would be a Kung Fu Fighter with all kind of melee weapon skills. Magic would be used for defensive purposes, movement and buffs.\n\nWith all that elemental stuff, the current LE soellblade perfectly fits for me.\n\nThe issue you point out, is one that isn’t solely dedicated to the Spellblade mastery. Many builds have a not so wide choice of weapons if you want to fully use its potential.\n\nYou will always use a base type weapon that fits your build best. In this case, it’s the Crystal Blade. It’s the highest base that fits this class. As others said, you can also use Katana for maxing damage.\n\nOn a bleed Bladedancer you won’t use Crystal blades. You might use an axe with a lot of bleed support, but sword fits better, because of passive synergies and idols.\n\nThese kind of restrictions can be found all over the game. This is part of the philosophy. The devs tell you straight away that if you want to play a dual wielding melee mage, the optimal choice is swords. That’s their class fantasy.\n\nMaybe when time goes by we get additional sword base types that are suitable for Spellblade besides the 2 current choices. I don’t say no to more variety.\n\nBut class fantasy is ok for me regarding Spellblade.\n\nI do not argue with this, I completely agree that SpellBlade should solve his tasks with the help of swords. But this is the problem.\n\nMaybe when time goes by we get additional sword base types that are suitable for Spellblade besides the 2 current choices.\n\nTake a look at this list.\n\nSword: Katana\n\nAxe: Eagle Wing\n\nBlunt: Solarum Hammer, Doom Star, Rune Hammer\n\nDagger: Rune Dagger, Moon Dagger\n\nSceptre: Argentus Sceptre, Obsidian Sceptre\n\nAmong all these weapons that could potentially be used, there is only one sword, the katana, and then, it is only suitable because of one single node (of all SpellBlade skills), which gives a critical attack.\n\nOr take for example the Scimitar, which logically should be suitable for SpellBlade instead of Argent Scepter, but not suitable, because SpellBlade does not have abilities that are enhanced by swords.\n\nAs a result, even with suitable swords, we use scepitres. Or with daggers or clubs …\n\nAs a result, for SpellBlade you need to create crutches, like Crystal Sword, for its mechanics to work …\n\nIn my opinion, SpellBlade should be such that by taking a Scimitar in hand, it becomes useful and effective for us. Or taking the Dawn Blade into our hands, he turned out to be more effective for us than, for example, the Obsidian Scepter.\n\nP.S. Tell me, is Spellblade for you a magician or a warrior?\n\nIf you give a war to the hands of a sword with fire damage, he will turn into a melee mage?\n\nIf I would ever create a Spellblade in a game, it would be a Kung Fu Fighter with all kind of melee weapon skills. Magic would be used for defensive purposes, movement and buffs.\n\nI remember the D&D games.\n\nTake Paladin for example. He imposes buffs on himself, increases defense, attack, and so on, even a sword can make him burn (if I didn’t mix it up). But does that make him a melee mage?\n\nPeople play role-playing games to act out their fantasy, so we have Sorka, not the number one magician. Druid, not magician number two. Paladin, not mage number three.\n\nAnd at the same time, we want to be effective. All the most popular games, such as Diablo, GD, and others, they give people a role-playing game.\n\nAt the same time, if it does not give them efficiency, or upsets the balance (as, for example, he began to do PoE), the game loses its popularity and is not played.\n\nBecause most people don’t play math, but fantasy.\n\nNo. I just want what the developer gives to be effective and interesting. And the mechanics of the characters, including from the point of view of the role-playing part, were full-fledged, and not contained in the game crutches.\n\nIf the developers make a SpellBlade, whose lore is based on swords, then they must have implementation in his skills and abilities.\n\nIf the developers give the SpellBlade skills that work from the spell (for example, Lightning Blast through triggers), then the SpellBlade must successfully implement them. And don’t do it with a staff, because SpellBlade is not a Sork. And with swords, because such a Lore was invented by the developers.\n\nTake the Druid for example. His lore is based on transformation. Imagine that his transformation does not depend on skills, but on the clothes he is wearing. Would that be correct? No.\n\nWeapons and armor, a tool that should help customize the playable class, not replace it.\n\nBut that’s how it is with SpellBlade now. His Lore is a sword. But we are offered to run with scepters and staves, axes and clubs, because this is mathematics …\n\nYes… To me this is part of the appeal of a game like Last Epoch… Because classes are unique in thier own ways, it motivates me to play each class… to experiment and find the ones I like and enjoy a variation in play style that is partially confined within the design of the class…\n\nGames that are more free, allowing you to build any character tend to be less appealing to me because I subconciously end up building subtle variations of the same thing - they are interesting but imho, I dont spend very much time playing them because I am not forced to try new things.\n\nNo… not at all - I have been playing rpg games for decades and before that DnD - a melee based mage is nothing new. But it works as a niche build in the Mage Class, in the same way as a Forge Guard works as a niche build in Sentinel Class. For me, its ticking a box for a particular character favourite - just like all LE classes - they all try to match class themes that people are familar with while still trying to add something Unique to LE.\n\nOne important thing to note before continuing: The game is in beta and I have been playing for over a year now and there have been MANY class reworks already… I dont think that ANY class in the game right now is 100% complete or 100% perfect - spellblades included.\n\nWhat I get from your threads/posts is that you have an IDEA of what YOU think a Spellblade should be and are trying to make the Spellblade in the game match your idea… instead of just playing the spellblade like its designed…\n\nUnlike you, I dont see a Spellblade as a fragile magician using swords/gear to enhance their innate magical spells/abilities … I see it the other way around… I see a warrior (something like a ranger not barbarian) that uses magically enhanced skills/weapons to enhance their melee abilities… So for me, the current design of the Spellblade fits well… Skills benefit from Dex & Int, melee attributes like attack speed etc are important, crystal swords benefit damage and speed… Spells, like Flame Ward/ Ward etc, focus on defence… melee tagged skills focus on offence with elements… With your idea of a spellblade, that would have to be reversed… offense becoming spells… defence becoming melee (like armour/dodge etc).\n\nSo I think that you just have a different view on what you think a spellblade is… Its different than what I think the game designers intended (and what I consider a spellblade to be)…"
