        "text": "Just watched the latest episode of FIF. IMHO the ‘brutal’ testing that is done on the knives is ridiculous. One of the blades, this case a sword, snapped and came back and hit the judge in the neck. This came after he was pounding it against a wooden post.\n\nHe could have been seriously injured while abusing a blade for ‘testing’. Kind of like a fellow using a lawn mower th trim hedges.\n\nIn all fairness the first sword took the abuse. But still.......!\n\nI enjoy the show bit glamorizing the abuse rather than the skill is worrisome.\n\nAnything for ratings. J. Neilson is a great knife maker and has contributed a lot to educating other makers but I have to agree that the \"tests\" are getting out of hand; but in the end they are intended for entertainment I guess. I do not know who makes the decision on what testing will occur but I hope they learned from the close call. I also wonder about backyard makers beating sharp steel into a piece of railroad track for \"testing\" and losing an eye. In thinking about my childhood though, if I had a dollar for every time my brother and I put the DDT, body slam, suplex or other wrestling move on each other I could buy my forge press I want. We survived...\n\nFIF is like most other Reality TV shows. It takes a topic that a small percentage of the population is very interested in and adds drama, danger or humor to try to draw in a larger percentage as viewers. One of the craziest examples of this is the Duck Dynasty show. I am from the area and have met the Robertsons a few times. Even duck hunted some of the same holes before they hit stardom. Viewers not familiar with the area or the sport might think this is real life but anyone with any knowledge knows better.\n\nSo while i get frustrated with FIF episodes, hunting shows and mainstream entertainment in general, I often ask myself if anyone would pay to watch me in my every day life? And if they did watch, would any of my actions excite them enough to get off the couch? Absolutely not!! But.... If there is a 14 year old kid in Detroit who decides to try his/her hand at making a knife because they watched FIF or asks their uncle to take him hunting because of Duck Dynasty, I think it is OK to add a little pizzazz.\n\nFIF is like most other Reality TV shows.

Not the silliness of them sommuch as the \"inaccuracy\" of them.\n\nTheres too many extra variables.\n\nLike for example... Having blades judged by how well they cut when swung by a judge.\n\nWell... Theres bound to be some fatigue and variation in technique between tests...\n\nShould be a measured mechanical chopper of some sort.\n\nMany of the tests are like that, inconsistent.\n\nInteresting show otherwise.\n\nI have caught a couple of the new shows and the format is a little better to me...at least as a maker any how. I really like seeing the blades those makers bring in for round one. Tobin's knife last night was great but that Damascus-mono steel San-Mai Bowie the Marine dude had was just awesome. I fell asleep after that part...long day."
