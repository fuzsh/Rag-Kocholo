        "text": "I know this has been discussed to death, but I’m having a difficult time finding any information on the drawbacks and benefits of choosing one versus the other that isn’t a gajillion months old.\n\nAlso, is anyone else having trouble finding swords and off-hands? Is it even worth spending all this time finding both a sword and matching item level off-hand if staves are so readily available?\n\nI’m curious because I made the mistake of splurging on a sword transmog I had no immediate use for. Help a brother out.\n\nThere is no definitive answer to which is better, staves or sword + OH. The only way to know what is better is to sim your character to find out, and its on an item to item basis, not an overall difference. For example I have my 425 Dagger and 415 Off Hand that is better than most staves because of the raw stat combinations as well as it just being titan forged. For example if you had like a 415 staff and a 425 dagger and 415 off hand to choose from, likely the dagger + OH combination would be much better (depending on your class and what stats are valued for you). However if you had a 415 staff and a 425 dagger but something like a 380 off hand, then the staff would more than likely just be better. It’s purely a combination of stats for the main hand and off hand compared to the 2 hander because casters do not benefit at all from raw weapon damage like melee users do.\n\nI have been a little bit away from the game for a couple months but correct me if I am wrong, but if I remember correctly Blizz made it so if you have a 1 hander like a dagger or mace / axe, you could Transmog them into a sword or vice versa. The only one that did not fit that rule is a wand because it had a shoot animation vs a melee animation (which is dumb af).\n\nDaggers can’t be mogged to swords and vice versa.\n\nWands can’t be mogged to anything but wands b/c of attack animation, even artifacts.\n\nswors/daggers can be mogged to artifact staves and staves can be mogged to the fire mage sword.\n\nBUT as to whats better, sim it. Basically its whatever combo gives the most stats. Weapons are gotten from raids or M+/ regular mythic, or you can get lucky in warfronts. It can be your first loot drop or take awhile, all RNG sadly :["
