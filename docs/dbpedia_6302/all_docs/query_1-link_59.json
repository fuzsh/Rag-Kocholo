Players take the helm of two distinct choppers and fly attack and rescue missions in 18 different levels. The game features four campaigns in a variety of environments including the Swiss Alps, Arizona Desert, Amazon Jungle and the Arctic Circle. Players blast opponents with the help of high-tech weaponry, including EMP weapons, rail guns, homing missiles, and special turbo upgrades that give the helicopter jet aircraft capabilities."
