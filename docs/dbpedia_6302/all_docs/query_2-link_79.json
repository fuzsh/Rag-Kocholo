You are more than welcome to do so yourself as well as long as credit is given for the parts used (please refer to the credited authors in case the part you want it is their work)\n\nIt's A-ok with me if you want to merge this mod with another incompatible mod as well\n\nThe only thing I'd prefer you talk to me first on is if you have an idea of something about the game you think should be defuckened. Chances are I might like to add it myself, and if it's not ill let you know you have the go ahead to make it seperate\n\nFile credits\n\nnacorcb\n\nHelping get Deflects working\n\nBlubber\n\nfor the Animation Repository some new additions come from\n\nMordrog\n\nCreating the Posture bars mod included in this mod\n\nCopyistMonk\n\nCreating the two hand animation swap included in this mod\n\nMadRhetoric\n\nCreating the dodge animation swap included in this mod\n\nTNordgaren\n\nfor creating The Erd Tools customizable dll mod pack , which was used to allow crafting in combat\n\nKirnifr and ividyon\n\nLetting me look at their code for Elden Ring Reforged to add the controls change to power stance\n\nThe ER modding discord\n\nfor being a valuable resource and community for all technical problems and questions I had getting these changes working"
