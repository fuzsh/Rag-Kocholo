        "text": "1. Can you have 2 flame blade spells going at the same time one in each hand and attack with TWF? Would the minuses be -4 /-4?\n\n2. Can you add sneak attack damage?\n\n3. can you use feats other spells abilities that add damage pluses to hit(not through str augmentation)?\n\nI would say yes all three though I am not sure on the first one\n\nthe second one, so long as it takes an attack roll sneak attack applies. and if you are an arcane trickster you don't even need an attack roll\n\nthe last one I'm pretty sure the spell description tells you that...\n\nEridan wrote:\n\n1. No following the 'Combining Magic Effects' rules.\n\n2. Yes\n\n3. Weapon Focus, weapon finess etc. should work as long as it is possible with a scimitar and not depending on STR\n\nCould you use flurry of blows with gods fav weapon and crusader furry feat?\n\naka. Samsarans\n\nAlternate Racial Traits\n\nThe following alternate racial traits may be selected in place of one or more of the standard racial traits above. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.\n\n* Mystic Past Life (Su) You can add spells from another spellcasting class to the spell list of your current spellcasting class. You add a number of spells equal to 1 + your spellcasting class's key ability score bonus (Wisdom for clerics, and so on). The spells must be the same type (arcane or divine) as the spellcasting class you're adding them to. For example, you could add divine power to your druid class spell list, but not to your wizard class spell list because divine power is a divine spell. These spells do not have to be spells you can cast as a 1st-level character. The number of spells granted by this ability is set at 1st level. Changes to your ability score do not change the number of spells gained. This racial trait replaces shards of the past.\n\nI thought you wouldn't need two, if you're just going to flurry. Pretty sure you can flurry with just one.\n\nI'm not sure if you'd need Dervish Dance to be able to Finesse it, either, as they are \"melee touch attacks\". But on that, I'm not entirely sure.\n\nDiego Rossi wrote:\n\nEridan wrote:\n\n1. No following the 'Combining Magic Effects' rules.\n\nWhy? I don't see anything about that.\n\nI suppose you get that idea from this:\n\nPRD wrote:\n\nStacking Effects: Spells that provide bonuses or penalties on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and other attributes usually do not stack with themselves. More generally, two bonuses of the same type don't stack even if they come from different spells (or from effects other than spells; see Bonus Types, above).\n\nbut flame blades aren't a bonus or a penalty. They are completely separated effects.\n\nI agree with Diego Rossi because your not stacking both spells together. Each spell needs a separate attack to hit and damage roll.\n\nWould this be any different if you casting Shillelagh on two different cubs and using TWF."
