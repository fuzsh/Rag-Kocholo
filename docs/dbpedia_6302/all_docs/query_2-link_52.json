I am looking forward to adding suggestions to this post so let me know what works and what doesn't! I will edit this post with notes on specific games as I see them here or from personal experience. I use AHK with most of the games that I play, anything from keybinds to full MMO grind bots. Lets compile some of our good info here.\n\nEasy Steps:\n\nFirst basic steps to get AHK working with the average game.\n\n1) Make sure the script is running with Admin privilege(Right-Click on script, Run As Administrator)\n\n-Explanation: Some games run at admin level and AHK does not typically run with this privilege set.\n\n2) Switch the game settings from 'Full Screen' mode to 'Windowed' or (I prefer) 'Borderless Windowed' mode.\n\n-Explanation: DirectX draws the screen in a manner different from Windows, this can cause things like colors\n\nbeing reported wrong, mouse jumping to the 'wrong' coords, and it can just plain prevent the game from\n\nregistering the input at all.\n\n3) A lot of times Keypresses need to be held down longer than normal for the game to fully register it.\n\n-Explanation: Usually caused by DirectX(DirectInput). It 'polls' the keyboard every 15ms(varies slightly) and\n\nrecords the keys that are down, then 15ms later it takes another 'snapshot' and compares the two. This\n\nis how games allow you to hold two(or more) keys at the same time, but very fast(sub 10-15ms) inputs\n\ncan fall between snapshots and the game never sees the keypress. If your script is very twitchy and seems\n\nto skip over some keypresses then this is likely the problem.\n\n-Example: (Holds key down for 10ms)\n\nSend, {a down} Sleep 10 Send, {a up}\n\n4) Some games do not allow their keybinds to be 'hijacked'.\n\n-Explanation: Many games, especially DirectX driven, use driver level keyboard interaction and cannot be\n\nchanged via AHK. You need to choose keybindings that the game is NOT using, some people have had\n\nsuccess by changing the in-game keybinds so that those keys are 'free' for AHK to use.\n\nIntermediate Steps:\n\nIf you are at this point and the script still doesn't work it is likely that you are dealing with some sort of cheat\n\nprevention software. Don't give up hope, there are a couple fairly simple things that can still be done.\n\n1) Compile the script to .exe form and rename the program to something non-threatening to the game.\n\n-Explanation: Look here in the docs for how to compile, it is very well written and I will not be re-creating\n\nthe wheel here. This method is a fairly simple workaround for most 'hackshield' type softwares.\n\n-Examples: Rename to something generic or the same as something legit(setup.exe, skype.exe) possibly\n\njust random garbage(alksjdu.exe).\n\n2) Set up a second user account and run scripts as that user. Here is a link to the post with full explanation.\n\n-Explanation: Games run as one user do not have access to the processes run by a second user. In\n\nthis scenario, some cheat prevention softwares lack the access level to prevent the keystrokes sent\n\nby the second 'user'(our AHK script)\n\nExpert Steps: (None of these are verified or easy to use)\n\nThese are mostly theory at this point. These will be very difficult and will require in-depth knowledge to implement.\n\n(if you try any of these ideas with success let me know, i will update this)\n\n1) Download and setup a VM(Virtual Machine), install and run the game INSIDE the VM. Run AHK on\n\nthe OUTSIDE OS. This should prevent the game from interacting directly with AHK or 'seeing' it while\n\nstill allowing AHK to move the mouse and click.\n\n2) Simulating DirectInput. This is difficult and not supported natively in AHK in any way. Look here for a\n\nthread describing a couple ways to simulate DirectInput. This is theoretical and untested. Requires\n\nknowledge of DLL interaction.\n\nFollowing these steps should get scripts working in the majority of games. I have found a few that I cannot\n\nmake work so far but they are few and far between. If you have some tips to add to this please let me know!\n\nAHK Does Not Work In These Games(As far as I know, will be updated with solutions):\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order\n\nim trying to make a very basic script to run on rappelz, just wondering if u have had any dealings with webzen games before, im only making a scrip that hits keys in a continuous loop, not worrying about whats happening in game or anything like that, i might latter on try to work out a more complex script, but right now i just want to be able to use the keys, tab lets me select monsters & the 1 key lets me attack, that`s basically all i`m trying to do.\n\nthe game doesn't recognize the input from my autohotkey script, & something about my script is preventing me from making it into an exe file (im trying to fix that), i have the key strokes being held down for a random time between 20 & 50 microseconds to simulate a real players actions (iv`e had some limited dealings with auto-ban functions in the past) the file is called \"test2.ahk\" so it shouldn't be threatening, im running windows 7 & i don`t have the option to \"run as admin\" when i right click the file, i cant change the in-game keys, there 1 to 0, alt+ 1 to 0,shift+ 1 to 0 & ctrl + 1 to 0, ive tried to use 1 & 2, that's all, i was running the game in window mode when i tested & i haven't tried to do the 2nd used thing yet as its 1am when i found this thread.\n\nany help would he appreciated, i know the game can be botted as there are a few people in-game that are well known for doing it. the game does use gameguard\n\ngameguard sux!\n\ni made the script u sugested, i used it on this window to test i knew what i was doing with it & it wont work for rappelz\n\ni have already made the script i want to use with rappelz but it has the same affect, nuthing, i know its doing what its ment to because if i bring up a notepad it starts typing into it but on rappelz it has no affect. (i also have a counter on my script that brings up a window from the taskbar showing me how many times its ran threw my loop)\n\ni have tried send, sendinput & sendevent. i have the script compiled into an exe file(was sugested on some other thread that it might help)\n\nand while rappelz is active i cant even use the hotkey to pause my script\n\nany sugestions? because i refuse to play a magic class until i can get this working so i can auto attack like a melee class can (a mage class has to hit 1 every 1 sec & 2 every 1 sec, they need to be hit 0.5 sec apart to actualy have the class attacking like a melee class does"
