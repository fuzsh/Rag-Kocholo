        "text": "HELLO ALL! This is my personal guide to telling the Pokemon games for the GameBoy Advance series apart from fake ones!\n\nThis guide will go over Generation III and (unofficially) Generation III.5.\n\nThese games include the ever popular Pokemon Ruby, Pokemon Sapphire, Pokemon Emerald, Pokemon Fire Red, and Pokemon Leaf Green.\n\nNow you probably found yourself here trying to dig for answers on if you are purchasing an Authentic or Genuine copy of said games vs one that just very well might be a fake bootleg copy.\n\nSo sit back, let your nostalgia run rampant while you struggle on trying to get back your childhood, which you may have ever so ungracefully discarded or sold regrettably in the past.\n\nEnjoy! (Click the See More to get the full page!) All large HQ images too! Click the image to view it in PNG!\n\nNow, to start things off, these copies here are from my personal collection over the years. Most of which I purchased online (after much digging on trying to authenticate stuff). The copies of Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald all contain a battery to keep their clocks running properly. As these games have aged over the years, they have dried up and died. All of them has been replaced by myself. Simple soldering process is all that is needed to replace them. Of course, having a tri-wing screwdriver helps as well.\n\nFirst off we’ll start with Pokemon Ruby!\n\nHere is the front of the game. Please note the embossed number’s just right of Pokemon title. Fake ones NEVER have that.\n\nFront image showing the non-gloss, and the transparency of the cartridge. Note the position of the battery.\n\nObverse side. Note the four contact points in the upper left corner. Also the contact points of all the teeth that insert into the cartridge. They are all straight and level. Fake ones have variously positioned points.\n\nWhen you take them apart, the cartridge slides a bit then comes right out. (I don’t have a fake copy so I can’t know if they are any different.)\n\nHere is what the board looks like. Notice the battery position and the crystal used for the time on the left hand side. Also the chips placement on the board as well as their size.\n\n(if I’m not mistaken this is a later model with the smaller chip. Look at the Sapphire and you’ll see what I mean)\n\nThen the back side of the circuit board where everything is made clearly visible.\n\n———Next we have Pokemon Sapphire!———\n\nPlease note everything as the Ruby version as to this one.\n\nReverse\n\nReverse (x2)\n\nBoard. Now this is where I was mentioning the larger chip on this copy.\n\nBack side, unobstructed view of the board.\n\n———Pokemon EMERALD!———\n\nNow for some reason my copy doesn’t have the embossed letters on it.\n\nDon’t let that fool you though! Check out the actual holographic details on the sticker!\n\nObverse side, you can clearly see the contact points and pins with the 4-square in the corner.\n\nInternals.\n\nBack side of circuit.\n\nPokemon Fire Red time!!!\n\nCheck out the shiny design of the sticker, and embossed numbers.\n\nBack side you can see the 4-square and flat contact points.\n\nInside view. Note, NO BATTERY! This version has a smaller chip than the Leaf Green below. Probably a newer revision.\n\nBack side of the circuit board.\n\nPokemon Leaf Green!\n\nNote the shiny sticker and the embossed letters/numbers.\n\nThe lettering isn’t shiny while the background is.\n\nBack side. Same as Fire Red. 4-square, flat contact points.\n\nInternal board. NO BATTERY! Larger chip. Possibly Rev.1?\n\nAnd back side of Leaf Green.\n\n——————————————————–\n\nIf your copies do not look like this, then they are most likely fakes!\n\nI also found this page (Spanish webpage) it also shows some of the most common fakes and easy ways to spot them.\n\nHope this helps out!\n\nAll images are copyrighted by me, chieftain20. You are free to use these images as you like, just don’t alter them at all. Hence the watermark added to each photo. The watermark has been added to each image to be least intrusive as possible on the item, while keeping images secure from illegitimate potential sales on various websites."
