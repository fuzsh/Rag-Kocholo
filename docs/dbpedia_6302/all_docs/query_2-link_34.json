        "text": "{Spoiler Alert}\n\n[Almost There]\n\nIf I could address your character as something other than the Blade, it would âThe Problem Solverâ; as you do almost everything to rebuild the town, Rivercrest. This game is fun for those who have played previous Elder Scrolls games and doesnât have the time or means to play the Online Game. Iâm not bashing ESO, itâs just the WiFi in my area makes it difficult as well as my personal unwillingness to meet stranger players online. As for this game, I find it best to play with a portable charger plugged into my phone. The game does consume the battery; but so does other great app games. Like other great app games, the developers improve the software overtime. I remember when I had to wait hours to have a Silver or Gold Chest unlocked. Now, it opens in an instant. My only complaint is the lack of Archery. Of course, you donât use a bow to fight someone standing right in front of you. My suggestion for combat would be that you get an alert when an opponent sees you, which gives you the option to shoot one arrow the opponent as they approach you (which would weaken them before combat starts). If Archery is deemed impossible for the game, then perhaps instead you get a window of opportunity to cast an aggressive spell at the opponent or a defensive spell on yourself as a âprebuffâ. Anyway, I give this game four out of five stars because I like to think this game has room for improvement.\n\nOnce you play enough RPG games that involve building a town/base and performing quests/missions you start to feel like youâre playing the same game over and over again with a slightly different theme. They all have similar character pov and controls. This game broke that rut for me. Itâs beautifully rendered and pulls you right into another world. Thereâs plenty to keep you busy beyond the usual daily tasks with crafting, enchanting, sparring, and exploring the abyss. The storyline is multilayered and keeps you interested in whatâs going on in this world. As a professional artist of over 20 years I can appreciate the attention to detail in the rendering of every aspect of the game. I find myself examining the weapons and items in 3d to inspire me in my own work. Sometimes I just wander around my town like a tourist enjoying the fountains and trees that decorate it. So far Iâve played for several weeks, advancing through the levels and quests at a good pace without spending a penny (sorry devs, I donât have a lot of disposable income) in the store. The game rewards you generously with gold, gems and chests that keep you well equipped to move forward. If youâve got the money to spend thereâs some amazing offers in the store that Iâm sure would add to your gaming experience. This is the first time that I have ever written a review for a game with this much to say. Blades is so good that it deserved the time and effort to send some love to the creators!\n\nTo tell you the truth I was pretty skeptical when I saw it because I thought it was going to nothing compared to the trailer but itâs even BETTER. At first I was like oh I see itâs one of those crappy games but I still downloaded it and i said to myself the voices and main menu or surprisingly good then I started getting into the game play and I loved it so much I literally downloaded it like 2 hours ago. But I do have some suggestions first I would like maybe a little bit more simpler to understand what the creatures are like maybe when you see a new one it will like freeze on that monster or just anything new that you encounter and like show itâs name but other wise itâs fine to me notify me if you are going to take this into consideration. And also I donât know if your still gonna update this game but I would say add a online multiplayer where you cans trade goods and stuff and really just to chat oh and chat system it would be good if you could type chat or mic chat but I have one more idea weâll before I tell it if you do read this itâs ok if you say no but it would really make my day cause Iâm so exited and Iâve never been contacted or gave my ideas to and game company but your probably one of my favorite game companyâs on my phone oh and I was also going to ask is there and elder scrolls blade or just any elder scrolls on Ps4 and if there is notify me please. Overall thanks Bethesda ðð»ðð»ð¤ð»ð¤ð¾ðð¼ð§ð¼âð»"
