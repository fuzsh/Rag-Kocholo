        "text": "Efreet Warrior\n\nHello! This is a 2-handed melee Commando that uses the Conduit to convert Blade Arc to fire and employs that as his main skill. He also casts Blackwater Cocktail for a large amount of support. A lot of the build’s power comes from Shar’Zul’s Worldeater, and it doesn’t rely on item sets, but it does use a few MIs. It has a fairly standard devotion setup for fire damage.\n\nSince I posted this in 1.1.5.2, a string of changes have buffed this build, while only a couple have weakened it. Most importantly, there’s now a 2H fire sword illusion to use with Blade Arc!\n\nMost of the changes\n\nThe release of Balthazar’s Crest, Shar’Zul’s getting phys res and the granted skill getting buffed (twice), Menhir’s Bulwark becoming usable with 2H melee weapons, the Military Conditioning beef up, BWC having damage reduction, Blast Shield cooldown reduction, Faceguard of Justice changed to give +1 to all Soldier skills, extra damage on the Conduit, attack speed on Magi; Thermite Mines and Meteor Shower received nerfs on the other hand.\n\nHere’s the screenshot of the character sheet with just permanent buffs on:\n\nGrimtools\n\nUpdated 1.1.8.1 build (boots have “of the Wolverine” but it doesn’t show on GT)\n\nChanges for 1.1.8.1\n\nItems\n\nHelm switched to Mythical Faceguard of Justice (that has +1 to all skills in Soldier)\n\nMedal changed to Balthazar’s Crest\n\nOne ring changed to Mythical Combustion Band\n\nUsing shoulders and a ring with different affixes\n\nRing components changed to Runebound Topaz\n\nWeapon component switched to Enchanted Flint\n\nWeapon augment changed to Potent Ravager’s Rage\n\nSkills\n\nOleron’s Rage dropped in favor of Menhir’s Bulwark\n\nWar Cry dropped in favor of Demon Fire\n\nFightning Spirit and Blast Shield reduced to lower break points, BWC reduced to 1 point\n\nThermite Mine and Agonizing Flames hard capped\n\nDevotions\n\nQuill replaced with Toad\n\n1.1.8.1 build with the minimum affixes and no armor augments (generic setup)\n\n1.1.5.2 build I was using\n\nGeneric setup for 1.1.5.2\n\nFor leveling a character like this, I would recommend using a combination of Demolitionist bombs (Blackwater, Grenado, Canister).\n\nPerformance\n\nThe build feels especially strong now. I’ve put together a video to demonstrate how it plays (includes Gargabol, Morgoneth, Lokarr, SR60-61 without Shrines or “camera abuse”, Crucible 150-170 with just Empyrion’s Guidance buff): YouTube link\n\n1.1.5.2 performance: Imgur link for proof\n\nPros\n\nStrong, consistent damage\n\nGood AoE, especially for a melee build\n\nVery high resistances\n\nMultiple circuit breakers/defensive procs\n\n200% casting speed on a melee build makes it very smooth to cast supporting skills\n\nCons\n\nSomewhat prone to being bursted down, but Menhir’s Bulwark greatly helps with this\n\nResistance reduction (RR) is on the low side\n\nFreeze and petrify resistances are poor\n\nEnergy sustain isn’t great\n\nItems\n\nI’ve opted for only the head piece of Justicar set. Why not more? Well, trying it greatly reduces phys res in favor of armor (which the build isn’t stacking anyway) and/or decreases DPS. Even the flat damage on the 3 piece bonus isn’t as valuable as the bonus skill points to BA that the MI shoulders provide.\n\nMain hand: Shar’Zul’s Worldeater – extremely powerful for a fire Commando and greatly helps with needed skill points, but Sunherald’s Claymore is a viable alternative\n\nHelm: Mythical Faceguard of Justice – a fantastic universal helm for Commandos\n\nChest Armor: Fateweaver’s Raiment – very, very good for builds that don’t have an essential chest piece, plus the % elemental damage and Flahsbang points are used\n\nShoulders: Benn’Jahr’s Pauldrons – good piece that not only gives points for the main skill, but has crucial stats: physical resistance and attack speed\n\nPants: Mythical Legwraps of the Tranquil Mind – the resistances are relevant and slow res is even needed; spirit enables equipping the chest piece; bonus to Flashbang and proc aren’t bad; not a mandatory item, a number of other choices could be a good replacement\n\nGloves: Mythical Grasp of Unchained Might – good stats on top of modifiers to Blade Arc\n\nBoots: Stoneplate Greaves – a good flexible option; Mythical Wyrmscale Footguards, Mythical Golemborn Greaves and Mythical Magelord’s Greaves work as well\n\nBelt: Mythical Ulzuin’s Torment – strong fire belt with bonuses to Demolitionist, couldn’t want much else\n\nAmulet: Conduit of Warring Whispers – the build-enabling item\n\nRing 1: Cronley’s Signet – The best way to max Laceration, which is important for fire Blade Arc and scales extremely well by the ultimate rank; flexible on top of good stats\n\nRing 2: Mythical Combustion Band – a lot of favorable stats along with bonus RR make this excellent\n\nMedal: Balthazar’s Crest – seems tailor-made for the build\n\nRelic: Annihilation – perfect as all stats are desired, and the proc is augmented by the conversion the weapon has; the best completion bonus is Temper + Agonizing Flames\n\nCrafting for stun or freeze resistance is preferred.\n\nAugments and Components: Going full flat fire damage augments on rings and the weapon works out great; Enchanted Flint is a good fit, stacking conversion helps Shar’Zul’s Wrath, Meteor, and Meteor Shower; Killrian’s Shattered Soul works well here thanks to the attack speed and fire damage; Rune Augment is arbitrary.\n\nSkills\n\nNot much to say here, it’s mostly straight-forward. Investing into Blackwater Cocktail is easy with the bonus skills. It gives more freedom with Devotion choice and the damage reduction has better uptime than War Cry. There aren’t too many buttons to click and it doesn’t feel clunky.\n\nDevotions\n\nUlzuin’s torch – obvious choice, but worth noting that the proc works nicely with the phys to fire conversion\n\nAlladrah’s Phoenix – really good as it gives a lot of global crit damage which the masteries don’t provide, extra fire damage and some damage mitigation\n\nChariot of the Dead – solid Devotion that fits the affinities, and the CC res isn’t wasted\n\nViper – the elemental RR is actually significant against monsters with high fire resistance\n\nFeedback\n\nShar’Zul’s Worldeater seems too stacked, but because it supports a class that is generally regarded as weaker, I suppose it’s fine\n\nThe proc on Killrian’s Shattered Soul could stand to have burn damage.\n\nThe toggle on Horns of Ekket’Zul looks like it should have chaos damage. Thanks to the Justicar helm change, the item feels obsolete for fire Commando now.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to @RektbyProtoss for some feedback on the build before I posted it!\n\nThanks to @banana_peel and @Nery for advice."
