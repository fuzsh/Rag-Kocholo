        "text": "The fiery blade cannot be an improvised weapon\n\nThe rules for Improvised Weapons specify that they require an object:\n\nAn improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.\n\nThe rules define an object as:\n\na discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone\n\nThis is further elaborated on in this answer to the question \"What is an object?\".\n\nWhile it can be argued that the fiery blade is discrete (I'd agree), and inanimate (a bit harder to convince of, but I'd agree as well), it is not an \"item\":\n\nan individual article or unit\n\nBy the very nature of fire, you can't really refer to it as a unit.\n\nIn conclusion, the fiery blade you evoke from flame blade is a spell effect, not an object. Therefore it cannot be an improvised weapon.\n\nWhat if my GM rules that it can be?\n\nAllowing the flame blade to act like an improvised weapon opens up more mechanics than the spell accounts for and a GM will need to consider how that may impact the other aspects of the game. Considering this, if your GM does allow the spell effect to be used as an improvised weapon or decide that the fiery blade is an object, the following answers apply:\n\nWould such an attack benefit from scimitar proficiency?\n\nMaybe. The rules say:\n\nAt the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.\n\nSo it is up to the GM whether the fiery blade is similar enough. It has the same size and shape so that's a point in the \"yes\" direction, but it is made of fire rather than metal.\n\nWould it deal 1d4, 1d6, or 3d6 damage?\n\nIt would deal either 1d4 or 1d6,\n\nIf your GM rules that it is similar to a scimitar, it will use the scimitar's damage. Otherwise it:\n\nbears no resemblance to a weapon [and] deals 1d4 damage\n\nSo, in short it is up to your GM.\n\nWould the damage be fire damage?\n\nMaybe. As before, if it's being treated like a scimitar it has those properties:\n\ncan use a similar object as if it were that weapon\n\n... and therefore it would deal slashing damage.\n\nOtherwise...\n\nthe DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object\n\n... and fire is probably the most likely candidate. Again, up to the GM.\n\nHot Take (ba dum tiss)\n\nFlame Blade creates an improvised scimitar\n\nYou evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.\n\nYou can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage.[snip...]\n\nIt's all there:\n\nYou get a blade. ☑\n\nThe blade resembles a scimitar. ☑\n\nYou can use an action to make a spell attack for 3d6 fire damage (+1d6 per extra 2 spell levels). ☑\n\nNothing about that disables the normal action you are able to take with a blade that resembles a scimitar, which is to say that you can use the Attack Action with it.\n\nIn many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.\n\nCaveat: Your DM could rule that it's not QUITE similar enough to a scimitar to get the 1d6 damage and any relevant proficiency, but that seems like a pedantic power trip.\n\nIs this useful?\n\nNo, not really. It lets you make attacks of opportunity, but that's about it. Anyone casting this spell is either better off using the spell's action for 3d6, using a different spell, or just attacking with a regular weapon.\n\nThis is one of those \"there's no reason not to allow it, because there's no reason to do it\" kind of things.\n\nSorry, Flame Blade does not create a melee weapon\n\nFlame Blade...\n\nYou evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action. You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage. The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.\n\n...only lets you make a melee spell attack, not create a melee weapon (which is what you would need for an improvised weapon attack).\n\nUnless the description specifically states otherwise, the thematic effect/flavor of a spell does not tangibly affect the world. Similar effects for other melee spells include the shadowy wreath around your hand in Vampiric Touch or the vine-like whip that shoots out in Thorn Whip. The description of the effect in Flame Blade is more elaborate than these other examples but if it was a weapon suitable for making melee weapon attacks it would say so. Conversely, these effects also aren't valid targets for disarm. They also do not work with Maneuvers. They will however trigger things like Armor of Agathys and Repulsion Shield because they are melee attacks.\n\nAdvice:\n\nRAW\n\nChoose a spell which does create melee weapons. Shadow Blade and Alter Self (Natural Weapons option) would both enjoy all the benefits of weapon attacks. They are also both Second Level (like Flame Blade), though not Druid spells.\n\nHouse rules\n\nUse a little Home Brew to tweak Flame Blade into something more like Shadow Blade.\n\nAdd Alter Self to the Druid spell list (not just as a level 14 Circle of the Moon cantrip). A part of me says it should be there already.\n\nSide note: Bigby's Hand, also a melee spell attack, could be used as an improvised weapon. Its description specifically says that it creates an object. It might be fun to see someone try that."
