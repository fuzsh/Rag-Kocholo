        "text": "This page contains basic information about combat and its mechanics/bars. This includes details on status bars, basic mechanics, and status effects.\n\nKnowing this information is absolutely crucial to elongating your life, and will give any voyager a fighting chance when they inevitably enter a skirmish with their future adversaries, or worse-- allies.\n\nGUI[]\n\nThere are many elements to the GUI, each one playing its own part. In order to have a chance at surviving, learning these are essential.\n\nHealth Bar A visual representation of the player's health. Players start with 200 Health; things like Fortitude (0.5 Health per Fortitude), Health bonus from Talents and Equipment, Vitality (10 Health per Vitality) and Power (4 Health per Power) increase the max health. Upon reaching 0% Health, the player gets knocked down and is at the mercy of anyone around them.\n\nRegeneration is sped up while sitting at a Campfire, and slowed down while the player is in combat.\n\nPlayers cannot regenerate Health if their hunger bar is below ~12.5%\n\nThe lower your Health is, the slower you get. In short, Health directly affects your agility.\n\nThe player's Health bar has three states:\n\nPosture Bar A visual representation of the player's ability to guard against attacks. Building this bar indicates negative standing, so you should do your best to keep this bar as low as possible when engaging in combat. When the bar cannot hold any more energy, the next blocked hit will instead guard break, dealing increased damage and stunning you.\n\nPosture decreases if the player lands parries and/or stops blocking.\n\nWhen blocking while in shaky/weak block frames, your posture bar glows red to indicate that your block isn't full yet.\n\nSpitting with T on NPCs also restores posture by a great amount. (Not recommended as you'll be forced to stand still for the taunt)\n\nCooldown Icons Icons that indicate whether or not the player can do certain actions. When these icons become reddened/grayed out, the specified action will be on cooldown.\n\nThe first icon represents roll/dodge cooldown.\n\nThe second icon represents parrying cooldown.\n\nThe third icon represents when block is fully functional.\n\nThe fourth icon represents cancels and feints cooldowns.\n\nThe fifth icon represents Resonance cooldown. Only visible if you have one.\n\nCooldown Indicators Cooldown Indicators represent the cooldown for mostly everything in-game, from Talents like kick-off, propagandist, and audacity, to criticals, feints, Resonances, and even special attacks like Sudaruska's Fury. It has the name of the cooldown on the left side, and the amount of time until you can use it on the right. Ether Bar A visual representation of the player's Ether amount. Ether is Deepwoken's form of magic, and Mantras cannot be used without sufficient Ether.\n\nDifferent mantras use varying amounts of Ether. Adding Mantra Modifiers will increase the amount of Ether required to cast.\n\nEther passively regenerates, and regeneration is buffed with a high Tempo.\n\nEther also regenerates faster when out of combat.\n\nTempo A visual representation of the player's Tempo. Tempo is gained by hitting or being hit, and increases Ether regen during battle, as well as permitting the player to vent if they have a certain amount of Tempo stored. Maximum Tempo starts at 120.\n\nTempo decreases over time and is \"stored\" when out of combat\n\nWith at least 40 Tempo, press G to Vent. This pushes away anyone near you but can be parried/blocked. With more Erudition, venting becomes easier to do as you will have more Tempo, as well as Tempo regen.\n\nArmor Durability A visual representation of the player's current armor durability. When this bar is depleted, the player's armor is considered \"broken\", and you will start taking damage as if you have no armor on at all.\n\nArmour can be repaired through various methods, such as a Blacksmith, using Talents, the Metal Enchantment, or a Bloodiron Ring.\n\nAssuming you managed to pick up Exoskeleton or if you are a Vesperian, there will be two armor bars instead- the white representing Clothed Armor, and the green representing Natural Armor.\n\nLet it be known that applying these things will take some time to master.\n\nAs you play the game and face hardships, knowing how to properly watch over these values will begin to come to you naturally. Ward your frustration should you become disappointed in your progress- there is still the road ahead, Pathfinder.\n\nMaps[]\n\nUpon talking to a shipwright or spawning a boat, you'll unlock the ability to write down your navigations.\n\nWith places that have not been explored yet obscured, and places you have already visited fully written. It also identifies you of your current location with a yellow (blue if in the depths) marker, and the waterlocks leading to the next Luminant. It will also provide you of the whereabouts of your guildmates with their first and last inital, and points of interest in your current location. You will also be shown if you cross out of the maps boundaries as an arrow to the side of the map.\n\nIf you have Dimensional Travel/Kamui in your possession, using a map inside of it will also inform you of your physical location.\n\nKeybinds[]\n\nUpon pressing the settings button, you can find a keybinds section next to the settings page. Keybinds will allow you to have two different keys for an action, with the first one already being there when you start. To revert something, all you would need to do is press the reset button next to the action you're changing.\n\nCertain actions such as Ironsing's pull and Murmurs require you to have access to them on the slot you're currently using in order to change their Keybinds. Currently, you are unable to change Keybinds for sailing & ritual casting.\n\nSurvival Basics[]\n\nThese are stats that are you required to maintain in order to survive in the world of Deepwoken. These stats will gradually deplete over time during your travels, but the depletion can be sped up by varying environments, creatures, or other players.\n\nIn order to survive, the player will need to eat food to replenish their Stomach and hydrate to replenish their Water. Many food items also contain water within them, such as the Mushroom Bisque, allowing you to regenerate both.\n\nOnce both are depleted, you will begin to lose Blood and your health will be reduced to half of your max health.\n\nOnce every bar reaches zero, you will enter a combat state and be rendered helpless unless you consume food within the next few seconds.\n\nThese stats can be found at the bottom-left of your screen, in the main game.\n\nBlood A visual representation of how much Blood is currently in the player's body. Being attacked or taking damage in some form will cause the player to lose Blood. Upon reaching zero Blood, the following happens:\n\nThe player will always be combat tagged.\n\nThe player's Water and Stomach bar will rapidly decrease.\n\nGetting hit while bleeding out drains a large amount of Water and Stomach\n\nMaximum blood increases with power, gaining ~10% more blood each power. Thus, the maximum amount of blood is doubled at power 10 and tripled at power 20, compared to the starting amount.\n\nWhen healing at a campfire, your Water and Stomach will work together to replenish your Blood.\n\nWater A visual representation of how much Water is currently in the player's body. Water isn't too vital for survival and will deplete over time. You will lose 50% of the bar upon vomiting. Upon reaching zero Water, the following happens:\n\nThe player's screen will become blurry.\n\nThe player will start to move slower.\n\nYour Water will drain slightly faster when healing at a campfire or swimming.\n\nStomach A visual representation of how much food is currently in the player's body; essentially your hunger bar. You will lose 50% of the bar upon vomiting. Upon reaching zero Stomach, the following happens:\n\nThe player will gradually lose health and blood.\n\nThe player's max health will be reduced.\n\nAttempting to swim while starving and with less than 50% HP will immediately knock the player, resulting in drowning if not assisted.\n\nYour Stomach will drain slightly faster when healing at a campfire or swimming.\n\nInventory[]\n\nYour inventory will be color-coded to assist you in finding types of items. Should you be unable to find an item in your mountain of objects, simply use the search bar in the bottom and type the item name in to quickly find it.\n\nItem Type All items in you see in your UI whether in the inventory or in your hotbar have a color based off of what type of item they are. These categories take different priority in the sorting of your inventory so misc items like books will be seen at the bottom of your inventory while training items and utility like flint are seen at the top. Items also have a frame on them with the color defining its rarity or otherwise worth. Grey for common, yellow for uncommon, red for rare and cyan for legendary. Purple frames are seen on potions and enchants. Grey is always seen on elemental weapons like Crypt Blades. (These item frames aren't always correlated to the items drop-rate hence why some \"Legendary\" items may appear to drop commonly when you do the math)\n\nDuring the 2/9/24 update, the Inventory UI received a category revamp. It brought along 9 different categories, combining old item categories making a clean separate line for each category, and listing the number amount of items in each category on the right side.\n\nDuring the 2/16/24 update, the Inventory UI received a further addition of 3D model icons. This can be changed in the settings and can be disabled or extended to only show if the item is hovered over. It also added collapsable categories with a down arrow next to the category amount, which collapses the category upon being clicked. And the addition of the 10th category; Relics.\n\nCarrying Capacity Carrying Capacity dictates how much weight in items your character can hold before their speed is reduced and they can no longer safely have items. You may check an item's weight by hovering over the item in your inventory and seeing the number held in the small blue box in the corner. Hovering over the item may also give you a description along with a number of how many notes it'll sell for at a vendor.\n\nThere exists a soft cap, which is the listed capacity in digits on the right in your inventory. You may carry more items beyond that amount, reaching the hard cap.\n\nThere then exists a hard cap, upon reaching the cap; your carrying capacity will be colored red. Detailed when you try to carry more items than you're currently capable of. Eventually, your character will be unable to hold onto any more items, and enough items must be dropped to make room to pick up another. As well as consequently slowing down your movement and any items picked up past that point or higher will be voided upon leaving the server or resetting; including enchants and items that haven't been soulbounded.\n\nFor example, if the soft cap would be 240; the hard cap would be anything past that.\n\nLocking Items By right-clicking on a sellable/droppable item, you can lock it. By locking it you prevent the item from being sold or dropped while giving it an appearance of chained borders.\n\nCombat Basics[]\n\nWhen fighting, while dealing damage is important, reducing their posture can also help in reducing the volatility of your fellow adversary. Should they block one of your attacks, rest assured that you still dealt some form of damage to them by placing them in negative standing.\n\nAttack Left clicking (M1) allows you to swing your weapon, dealing damage to whoever is hit unless they block, parry, or dodge your attack.\n\nIn the case of getting your attack blocked, your attack will instead deal a different type of damage in the form of \"Posture Damage\", taking into account the weight of your weapon rather than your damage output.\n\nWhen 4 hits are swung consecutively without pauses, your character will kick your adversary away in an action called a Flourish. This is an \"end\" to your string of swings, and has a small amount of endlag before you can swing again- which can be circumvented by casting a Mantra directly after the Flourish. Landing a Flourish causes the target hit to be launched away from you, essentially preventing an infinite combo. Flourishes can only be feinted by casting a mantra.\n\nMany Talents modify your Flourish in different ways, from blurring someone's screen when they get pushed into a wall with the Concussion Talent, burning someone with the Flaming Flourish Talent or placing down Ice with the Chilling Flourish Talent.\n\nHitting or parrying opponents applies stun, which, for a slight moment, lowers their movement speed, disables their rolling, cancels their ability to attack, and nullifies the hitbox of any current mantras they are casting despite the continuing animation and visual effects.\n\nIn continuation of the ending point, if someone uses Ice Lance but you manage to score a hit as they drive it towards you, you will take no damage from the Ice Lance- it won't even stick into you, even if you were meant to be hit by it.\n\nPerforming an M1 while running performs a Running Attack, forcing your character to strafe forward and strike with increased range- stopping your character in place directly after, and has increased end-lag and slightly increased windup. While some of these properties may sound negative, it can be handy when in need of having to catch your adversary off guard. If a Running Attack is used against an adversary with their back turned to you, you shall charge into them with a gust of wind and strike. The only way to feint a Running Attack, similar to a Flourish, is to cast a mantra.\n\nA hidden technique, subtly called Stepping, involves double tapping W during an M1, which will bring you closer to your opponent if you need to exploit range of your weapon and what your adversary may assume about your standing in combat. Suggested to only use this when necessary, as attempting to perform the required actions may put extra physical strain which will make it harder to perform other actions- as well as accidentally performing a Running Attack- unless you are used to the button combo.\n\nGetting hit will negate your ability to throw in an M1 for a little longer than it takes for you to be able to roll so it's not at all recommended to try to M1 in the middle of your opponents combo.\n\nCritical Attacks Critical Attacks, or \"Crit(s)\" for short, can be initiated by pressing R or clicking M3 (Pressing down the scroll wheel). Personally advised to use R .\n\nCritical Attacks have various uses. Some work as a way to throw off your adversary's timing, such as the normal Sword critical or Rifle Spear critical. Others work as a way to help deal damage, such as the Dagger or Rapier criticals. Some others work as a combo tool, such as Spear criticals, while some others may be used to simply instill fear and discomfort in the opponent, such as a Kyrscleave critical.\n\nAdding onto this, some legendary weapons have unique criticals that can enhance the feeling of possessing a \"protagonist's weapon\". Such weapons would include the Railblade and Petra's Anchor, both having two criticals.\n\nA mass majority of Critical Attacks cannot be feinted. When you perform one, make sure you are committed to doing so.\n\nParrying Tapping the F key causes your character to enter a stance of deflection for a moment. Enemies hitting you during this timeframe causes them to be parried, causing them momentary stun and posture damage, as well as reducing your posture on a successful parry.\n\nSuccessful parries gives your character brief frames of auto-parry in which all incoming attacks are parried automatically. Parrying also resets its cooldown so that you may parry immediately again. It's also possible to attack during it's auto-parry frames, but this is difficult to do safely. Parrying will cancel all attacks (except for some monster attacks), as well as the damage for that attack, even if they come from behind your character. However, this is not the case for Blocking (see below).\n\nParrying has a 1.4 second cooldown. If you miss your parry, you may hold F to Block and nullify/reduce any imminent damage you would otherwise take for missing the parry.\n\nParrying physical attacks like Mantras or M1s will completely interrupt your opponents action, even if the animation continues. So, without their action getting in the way of their parry, they are able to parry whatever move you throw out next. This does not apply to all mantras however, especially projectile based ones. You may alternatively attempt to roll their mantra which MAY have an 100% chance of an M1 if you throw it out quick enough.\n\nBlocking By holding the F key after this stance of deflection has worn off, your character will hold their defensive stance and brace for incoming attacks, increasing your posture rather than lowering your health if you were hit during the block. The blocker can act slightly before the attacker, but not as much as if they parried. Remember, letting your posture exceed its maximum hold will result in you being block-broken.\n\nIf you are hit, your block will be disabled and you will instead be forced to parry. You may also Vent by pressing G if you have enough Tempo.\n\nBlocking only shields you from attacks in front of you. You can still get hit from behind or on your sides unless you parry, which stops attacks regardless of where you're facing.\n\nVenting When the player has at least 40 Tempo (indicated by a small notch on the tempo bar), pressing the G key will make the player Vent.\n\nVenting pushes others nearby away and grants a brief period of invincibility and relief, which allows the player to get out of tricky situations such as being comboed or being overcrowded, along with dealing a miniscule amount of damage, enough to cancel attacks and knock your adversary if they have sufficiently low health.\n\nShould the Vent fail to land or be parried/blocked, you will be stunned in place, unable to do anything. This will provide a window for your adversary to close in on you. Should you be lucky, this window won't be exploited.\n\nWhile block-broken or assassinated, you cannot Vent.\n\nVents are parryable, blockable and rollable which all negate the knock back you'd normally receive. Parrying it however does stun the person venting in place as if they missed the vent.\n\nFeinting Right-clicking- otherwise using M2- during the moment your character pulls their weapon/arm back for a swing will allow you to fake-out the opponent with a Feint. You can also hold the button down which will feint your M1 as soon as possible and allows you to attack again even sooner more easily.\n\nYou may feint Running Attacks and Uppercuts (see below) by using a Mantra just before you strike.\n\nYou may feint Mantras by doing M1+ M2 during a cast.\n\nYou may feint a swing into a Mantra by casting a Mantra during the moment your character pulls their weapon/arm back.\n\nThis allows you to play mind games with your adversary, and is very essential for mid-high level combat. For example, feinting can bait them to block- disabling their ability to parry and instead forcing them to roll. When they roll, you can follow through their roll and attack them through it.\n\nThe strongest way to use feints is to use them without a pattern or rhythm. People can learn the way your feints work, and turn your feints from a tool into a downfall by swinging at you when they know you will feint.\n\nAlternatively, you can make a makeshift feint by intentionally missing an attack, which spares you of the cooldown. This technique is a gamble, but with risk comes rewards.\n\nFeinting has very slight end-lag, and will briefly disable your ability to make any attack for a very small moment.\n\nDashing Pressing Q allows you to Dash towards your desired direction, granting you immunity frames against most attacks, with the exception of a few.\n\nYou can roll-cancel by right-clicking- otherwise using M2- during the movement of your roll. For many experienced players, roll-canceling replaces Dashing as it is simply better in most cases, given that it cancels the endlag of your Dash as well as asserting yourself in combat and sizing up your adversary.\n\nMany Talents exist to add properties to your Dashes. For example, if a Galebreather obtains the rare card Gale Dash, they will gain a wind-empowered dash upon initially dodging an incoming attack.\n\nWith the Echo Talent \"Aerial Assault\" (Unlocked at Power 2), you can do an Air Dash by Q in the air, with the direction traveled depending on where your camera is facing.\n\nStance Change Pressing the Y button will change your Stance from one-handed to two-handed. Many Light Weapons cannot switch their stance except for Fists, which can switch between their unlockable fist styles at will.\n\nOne Handed Stance: This stance defaults to Light and Medium weapon, and Heavy weapons can use this stance after obtaining 40 HVY. Offhand equipment, such as shields, parrying daggers, and guns will be accessible. An alternate idle animation is used if you do not have anything on your offhand. This stance increases posture damage dealt to the target when parrying but reduces posture damage dealt when hitting their block.\n\nTwo-Handed Stance: This stance defaults to Heavy weapons, with Medium Weapons also having access to it. Any offhand equipment will be put away, such as shields. This stance increases posture damage dealt to the target when hitting their block but reduces posture damage dealt when parrying.\n\nStealth When crouched, one can sneak up behind most humanoid enemies- excluding Songseekers for example- and M1 from behind to perform an Assassination.\n\nThis will deal a large amount of damage to NPCs, and inversely a low amount of damage to players, and will cause the victim to ragdoll for 5 (NPCs)/2 (Players) seconds and place their venting on cooldown while they are knocked. Executes NPCs if the damage dealt is high enough.\n\nEquipment such as the Assassin's Cloak or the Assassin Talent can make it so that a level 1 player can instantly execute an Immortal Guardian.\n\nIf the target is not killed by the initial attack, it is recommended to swing at them as much as possible before they get up. They cannot be picked up if they aren't technically 'knocked' down.\n\nThough if you deal with more than 40%, the target will automatically wake up.\n\nUppercut You may hit your adversaries up into the air with an Uppercut by pressing M1 while holding Ctrl. If your opponent is a monster, they will fail to rise with you and instead remain grounded.\n\nUppercuts are advertised as anti-air tools, being able to counter an enemy that attempts to strike you from the air. The hitbox affects a wide area in front of you, covering the sides and front requiring you mostly to face your opponent when the move drives you forward to strike.\n\nVictims hit by Uppercuts are unable to block, and parry timing is seemingly tighter, which makes Uppercuts play a big role in combos. Comboing will keep you in the air, while feinting and parrying will drop both of you.\n\nCertain Talents- such as Flaming Uppercut and Quick Link- can also affect the potency of Uppercuts by adding properties to them the same way some Talents add properties to Flourishes.\n\nUppercuts have their own unique windup speed, regardless of whatever weapon type you may be using- making Uppercuts especially useful for Heavy users (and furthermore for those Gran Sudaruska users..).\n\nIf you land an Uppercut against a dodge or block, then the reduced end-lag should allow you to strike your opponent with an M1 before they can retaliate.\n\nLanding a flourish on an opponent suffering from the stun of your arial combo will automatically kick them to the floor, which will result in any wall-bang Talents occurring- such as Bulldozer and Breathing Impact.\n\nMissing an Uppercut will completely immobilize you and leave you vulnerable- akin to failing to Vent, but you can typically parry an incoming attack if your opponent is on edge, or try an Uppercut yet again before full recovery.\n\nOn paper, this looks like a lot to memorize, but do not worry. These things will come more naturally as you play the game, just do not forget that these exist. Improving your combat potential and your ability to conquer those that stand in your way lies in your ability to master what must be mastered.\n\nStatus Effects[]\n\nStatus Effects are present throughout the game, whether it be fighting or exploring, e.g. being engulfed in flames by Flamecharm Mantras or stepping in acid pools in Erisia.\n\nMain article: Status Effects\n\nMagic Basics[]\n\nSpell Casting When you use a spell, it will deplete a certain amount of ether dependent on the volatility of the spell. You will hear a sound cue while casting, and timing your click to this will enable you to use the spell faster. There is also a visual cue, however, this differs from spell to spell. Spell Feinting Similar to the feinting system within the melee weapons, you are able to fake a spell and then quickly select another one for example, going for a fire grab and then quickly cancelling it to a fire AoE attack. You can also feint rituals however you need all the items for the ritual in order to start and stop it. It could be possible that there are consequences for cancelling ritual tier magic, so be careful. You may only cancel a few mantras in the game during their attack like Rapid Punches.\n\nSpell feinting is performed by pressing M1 and then M2. Spell feinting will not refund the ether cost.\n\nIt's possible to feint and feint your spell at the same time. Double feinting like this will often draw out your opponents parry and roll. It's still fairly possible to retaliate against but dealing with this technique is tricky, especially when used with very quick mantras which easily overwhelms most unexperienced players thought process.\n\nPerfect Casting Clicking M1 during a specific time of your Mantra cast will Perfect Cast it. Almost all spells benefit from Perfect casting, and certain spells and Talents utilize Perfect Casting to better strengthen their power, but all around, Perfect Casting will:\n\nCast the spell faster.\n\nIncrease damage.\n\nIncrease posture damage.\n\nIncrease spell size (unconfirmed)\n\nA successful Perfect Cast can be indicated by Talents that are based around it.\n\nAdvanced Movement[]\n\nRoll Cancel When you roll, you can M2 similar to how feinting works and cancel your roll. Useful against enemies after perfect dodging to immediately attack or to fake out your opponent. Gives you the same i-frames as a normal perfect roll. Ragdoll Cancel After being ragdolled, you can M2 to do a backflip that ends the ragdoll early for some attacks- such as a Thresher tail whip.\n\nAlliances[]\n\nThe Alliance mechanic assists players in minimizing damage from friendly fire, rather than a complete damage immunity mechanic typically found in other games. In Deepwoken, the game runs an \"ally check\" when calculating damage or deciding to proc abilities. Players and NPCs considered allies will receive less damage dealt by you. Some Talents increase this effect further and can also proc additional effects.\n\nAllies can view messages from you anywhere in a server through Shouts. In Dungeons and other instanced servers, all messages are automatically shouted to other allies in the server. In public servers, you can send a shout by prefixing your message with an exclamation mark (!). For example: \"!give me 30,000 notes\". It can also work through allies with Vow of Allegiance.\n\nIf you are in a guild, all other members of that guild are treated as allies. You can form alliances with players outside of your guild through a Vow of Allegiance. To form a Vow of Allegiance, you must say \"Wanna make a vow of allegiance [name]?\" near your target. The target can accept the vow by saying \"yes\", which will then show the confirmation window. There are no stat or Talent requirements to make this vow. Vows of Allegiance persist on the slot (not to be confused with the Character or Account), and each slot can only form 50 allegiances. You can break your Vows of Allegiance through a Yun’Shul wish (you must make this wish at the Temple of Hearts as the Idol of Yun'Shul does not have this option). However, this breaks ALL vows made on the slot.\n\nThe ally check can be disabled by turning on the \"No Holds Barred\" in-game setting, useful if you would like to spar with teammates as your attacks will deal normal damage and proc Talents/abilities that normally would not.\n\nTrivia[]"
