        "text": "SPOILER ALERT If you haven't read the most recent chapter and are looking for a walkthrough, be aware that the page is full of spoilers.\n\nThis page contains the choices in Blades of Light and Shadow, Book 2 and their outcomes.\n\nThis game revolves heavily around the choices you make. They can improve or decrease relationships with the characters, as well as increase XP, which allows you to level up and learn new skills. This walkthrough is made to assist others in helping them make the right choice for their game. Good luck and happy playing!\n\nChoices that have no outcome on the side have not been explored yet, please help this page by contributing those answers!\n\nGame Mechanics\n\nXP\n\nYou'll get XP by making the right choices and passing Skill Checks.\n\nThe number of XP received from some Choices is based on the level you're at. These will be indicated accordingly. For example, if the walkthrough says +4/10 XP, you'll get 4 XP if you're at Level 1 and 10 XP if you're at Level 2.\n\nThe levels are as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 1-10 (2 or 4 XP)\n\nLevel 2: 1-50 (5 or 10 XP)\n\nLevel 3: 1-150 (10 or 20 XP)\n\nLevel 4: 1-750 (25 or 50 XP)\n\nLevel 5: 1-2500 (100 or 200 XP)\n\nLevel 6: 1-7500 (250 or 500 XP)\n\nLevel 7: 1-15000 (500 or 1000 XP)\n\nAfter reaching the end of Level 7 you'll only get \"MAX Level!\" but the game will still keep counting the XP as if you were still on Level 7. For example, you can go from 14851/15000 to 351/15000 then to 851/15000.\n\nSkills\n\nYou will have to choose Skills for your character. Skills will help you conquer challenges, befriend allies, and unlock special scenes.\n\nSome choices will require you to have a Skill to choose them. These unlock special scenes and often award XP. Only the skills you choose will be among the available options. Unchosen skills will be shaded, chained and unavailable. The option order of these choices will vary based on the skills you have, unavailable skills will appear at the bottom.\n\nMore Skills can be unlocked by earning XP, which you'll get by making correct choices, defeating enemies, and passing Skill checks. Earn enough XP to level up and learn new Skills.\n\nThere are five categories: Species-specific Skills, Combat Skills, Diplomacy Skills, Survival Skills, Elite Skills. This walkthrough uses the in-game icons for options that require certain Skills.\n\nSpecies-specific Skills:\n\n- This choice requires you to be an Elf.\n\n- This choice requires you to be a Human.\n\n- This choice requires you to be an Orc.\n\nYou can import your acquired Skills from Book 1. If you don't import, Charisma, Seduction, Blades, Beastmaster, and Woodslore will be automatically unlocked in Book 2.\n\nBook 1 Combat Skills:\n\n- This choice requires the Blades Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Bows Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Brawling Skill.\n\nBook 1 Diplomacy Skills:\n\n- This choice requires the Charisma Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Deception Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Seduction Skill.\n\nBook 1 Survival Skills:\n\n- This choice requires the Beastmaster Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Medicine Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Woodslore Skill.\n\nBook 1 Elite Skills:\n\n- This choice requires the Light Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Kaytar Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Stealth Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Fireball Skill.\n\nBook 2 Combat Skills:\n\n- This choice requires the Alchemy Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Chain Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Staff Skill.\n\nYou get \"Heavy Hitter\" if you've unlocked all Combat Skills.\n\nBook 2 Diplomacy Skills:\n\n- This choice requires the Inspire Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Insight Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Intimidate Skill.\n\nYou get \"Silver Tongue\" if you've unlocked all Diplomacy Skills.\n\nBook 2 Survival Skills:\n\n- This choice requires the Craft Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Realmwalk Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Shadowsight Skill.\n\nYou get \"Jack of All Trades\" if you've unlocked all Survival Skills.\n\nBook 2 Elite Skills:\n\n- This choice requires the Heal Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Bind Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Theft Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Wayfinding Skill.\n\n- This choice requires the Shatter Skill.\n\nYou get \"Living Legend\" if you've unlocked all Skills.\n\nAt the end of the latest chapter, the walkthrough will indicate the maximum possible XP that can be gained and the Skills needed to achieve it. For this book, it will assume you have all Book 1 skills and only include the new skills. It is the quickest way to max out the XP bar but not the only one since there might be several ways to reach the maximum. The Skills need to be acquired in the order they appear. Only the required Skills will be listed even if you can have more Skills at that level. For example:\n\nor\n\nElite Skills\n\nElite Skills are very powerful premium Skills that will help you throughout your adventure. When you get offered one that is your ONLY chance to unlock the Skill.\n\nInjuries\n\nYou can get injured if you've chosen one incorrect option or a sequence of incorrect options. Injuries will persist on your character, and may make future challenges more difficult. They might prevent you from getting XP too. You can treat injuries by finding some items to heal them.\n\nSide Quests\n\nSide Quests will let you deepen your relationships with party members, and collect gear and treasure to help on the adventure, including treatment for injuries.\n\nSocial Quests\n\nSocial Quests let you get closer to your companions and learn more about them.\n\nLore Tablets\n\nCollect them to learn more about magic, world history, and the secrets of the realms. You'll get bonus XP for every tablet you collect and if you get all six tablets, you'll unlock a Bonus Scene.\n\nLegendary Weapons\n\nYou can collect Legendary Weapons to enhance your fighting skills and gain some extra XP from them. They will also replace your regular weapon, such as your gauntlet (Brawling Skill). You can only use them if you've unlocked the corresponding Combat Skill.\n\nSetup Choices\n\nChoice 1 (Book 1 Completed)\n\nImport now!
