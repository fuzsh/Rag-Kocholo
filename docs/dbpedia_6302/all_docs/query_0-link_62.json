        "text": "Fire Emblem (Japanese: ファイアーエムブレム 烈火の剣 Fire Emblem: The Sword of Raging Fire), retroactively subtitled The Blazing Blade, is a Game Boy Advance game released in 2003, and later re-released on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2014. It is the seventh game in the Fire Emblem series, the second game in the series to be released on the Game Boy Advance, and was the series' first internationally-released title, spurred on by the sparking of interest in the series caused by Super Smash Bros. Melee and the recent release of Advance Wars.[1]\n\nThe Blazing Blade is a prequel to Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade, set on the same continent of Elibe twenty years prior to its predecessor's events. It stars three main lord characters: Eliwood and Hector, the fathers of The Binding Blade's Roy and Lilina respectively, and a completely new character, Lyn. The game is divided into two segments: the first segment stars Lyn and revolves around her quest to save her grandfather from his treacherous brother, acting as a tutorial mode for the game. The longer second part stars Eliwood, Hector and Lyn as they oppose the schemes of the sorcerer Nergal, who seeks to summon the long-banished dragons back to Elibe for his own gain.\n\nPlot\n\nIn Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, the player is given a direct character role in the story, as a tactician who guides the armies of Lyn and later Eliwood and Hector to victory in battle. At the start of the game, the tactician's name, month of birth, gender, and (only in the Japanese version) blood type are decided by the player; by default, the tactician's name is Mark.\n\nLyn's tale\n\nMark wakes up in a house on the Sacae plains. A teenage girl introduces herself as Lyn of the Lorca, a tribe of nomadic plains dwellers. Suddenly, bandits attack; Mark aids Lyn, who, with a sword, fights them off. The next morning, she decides to travel with Mark, to avenge her dead parents and the rest of the Lorca tribe, who were killed by bandits.\n\nIn the town of Bulgar, Lyn meets the womanizing cavalier Sain and his more serious partner Kent, both knights of Caelin, a territory in Lycia. She is disgusted by Sain's nature and leaves the city. Then, more bandits arrive to attack Lyn, and the knights go to their aid. After the battle, the knights inform Lyn, whose name is revealed to be Lyndis, that her mother Madelyn was the daughter of Hausen, the marquess of Caelin, making Lyn next in line for the throne. The bandits were sent by Lundgren, Hausen's younger brother, who aspires to be marquess. Lyn is a threat to this, so her life is in danger; the group decides to go to Caelin.\n\nLyn takes the group to a shrine to pray for a safe journey. There, her party defeats bandits seeking to steal the sacred sword, Mani Katti. As thanks, the caretaker of the shrine allows Lyn to hold the Mani Katti and pray. She draws it from its sheath, meaning the sword's spirits have chosen her. Since Lyn is the rightful owner, the priest allows her to take the sword.\n\nLyn sees her friend, the shy pegasus knight Florina, being bullied by a group of the Ganelon bandits. The bandits start a fight, during which an archer named Wil lends a hand. The group then stops at a small fort where they meet Natalie, a woman looking for her husband Dorcas. More Ganelon bandits surround the fort, including Dorcas, who had joined the bandits to pay for Natalie's illness. He is convinced by Lyn to switch sides; after the bandits retreat, he decides to join the growing party. As Lyn approaches the border, two other travelers, the talkative cleric Serra and her escort, a serious mage named Erk are caught up in another fight. Both join Lyn after the bandits' defeat.\n\nLyn travels to Araphen, whose marquess is willing to help. Suddenly, the castle is set on fire by Lundgren's assassins and Lyn is attacked; however, Rath, a high-ranking Araphen officer and a Sacaean nomad of the Kutolah tribe, comes to her aid. The cheerful thief Matthew joins and helps them enter the barracks by unlocking doors. After the battle, Lyn meets the marquess of Araphen. However, he views Sacaeans as savages and refuses to help Lyn. Rath, who overhears his comments, leaves the marquess's service and joins Lyn.\n\nWhile passing through Khathelet, Lyn runs into a strange boy, Nils, who requests her help to get his sister Ninian back from a shady organization called the Black Fang. The two are traveling performers: a dancer and a bard, respectively. A monk named Lucius also joins, having heard Nils's plight. Lyn's forces manage to defeat the Black Fang; in the castle, they find that Ninian has already been rescued by Eliwood, the son of the marquess of Pherae. Lyn thanks him and tells him her story; Eliwood decides to help Lyn out. Ninian and Nils also start to help Lyn by using their powers, which allow them to sense approaching dangers. Ninian finds that she has lost her ring, Ninis's Grace, a keepsake from her mother. Lyn and the others are able to track the Black Fang down and reclaim Ninian's ring from them.\n\nLyn continues to encounter more numerous and advanced troops on the way to Caelin. Matthew learns that Lundgren has been poisoning Hausen. Furthermore, he has also been spreading false rumors that Lyn is an impostor. Eliwood helps Lyn by convincing the other Lycian territories to stay neutral in the conflict, leaving Lundgren her only opponent. The group encounters the hearty former Caelin general Wallace, who remains loyal to Lord Hausen and believes Lyn, joining her forces.\n\nLyn finally reaches Castle Caelin and, after a heated battle, defeats Lundgren. She is finally able to meet Hausen, her grandfather, who is near death because of the poison. However, Lyn convinces him that they still have much they can do together, and Hausen decides to make an effort to continue living and begins to recover. When Lyn decides to stay in Caelin, Florina and Wil enter the service of House Caelin to stay with her. The rest of the characters go their separate ways, as described in their endings. Mark takes their leave to travel on their own for a time. Lyn's tale ends here.\n\nEliwood's tale – Finding Elbert\n\nEliwood's tale takes place a year after the events of Lyn's tale. A month before the story begins, the marquess of Pherae and Eliwood's father, Lord Elbert, vanished while journeying abroad, along with several of his best vassals. Eliwood leaves Pherae to search for him, along with the paladin Marcus, an old family retainer, and the cavalier Lowen a new but skilled Pheraean recruit.\n\nEliwood, desperate to find any lead on his father, leaves Pherae. Hector sneaks away from Ostia to accompany him in his search. Elbert first goes to Santaruz to ask Helman, the marquess, if he knows anything of Elbert's whereabouts. Eliwood arrives to find Helman injured by a member of the Black Fang, Ephidel. Helman uses his dying words to inform Eliwood to seek out marquess Laus, Darin.\n\nEliwood and Hector head for Laus but end up attacked by Darin's subordinates and his son, Erik. Darin flees before he is captured, abandoning his son. After being defeated, Erik tells Eliwood of the strange man, named Ephidel, that is manipulating his father. Eliwood then chases after Darin and the Black Fang; he then finds himself defending Caelin from a Black Fang assault and earns Lyn as an ally.\n\nLeila, an Ostian spy situated into the Black Fang, appears and informs Hector that the Black Fang and Darin are on the Dread Isle. Eliwood immediately leaves for Badon to request passage to the isle. He is initially unsuccessful, owing to the island's reputation, though eventually the pirate captain Fargus steps up to the challenge.\n\nAfter arriving on the isle and fighting through a large portion of the Black Fang's forces and encountering Ninian, Eliwood kills Darin and finally locates his father in the clutches of a man named Nergal. Nergal attempts to summon a dragon with Ninian using Elbert's Quintessence, but he is interrupted by Nils and the incompletely opened gate destroys the dragon and Ephidel, who was standing nearby. Nergal reappears after the gate has stabilized, but Elbert wounds him to chase him off. Unfortunately Elbert dies in Eliwood's arms after this and the group leaves the Dread Isle to head home to Pherae.\n\nBern and the Shrine of Seals\n\nWhen Eliwood reunited with his father on the Dread Isle, Elbert lived just long enough to inflict a severe but not fatal wound on Nergal, and to warn Eliwood that Nergal would be back and that Eliwood and his friends would have to be ready when he was. During the return journey, Nils and Ninian informed Eliwood that Nergal was somewhere far to the east, i.e. in Bern. They stopped at a fortress near Ostia to rendezvous with Uther and inform him of these new developments, whereupon Uther suggested that they make a detour to the Nabata Desert on the Missur Peninsula to seek the \"Living Legend\" before heading to Bern.\n\nThe Living Legend was none other than the Archsage Athos, one of the Eight Legends of the Scouring, who agreed to help Eliwood and his friends in unlocking the Divine Weapons to aid in combating Nergal. For this purpose, he said, it would be necessary to travel to the Shrine of Seals in Bern. His friends Pent, Louise, and Hawkeye agreed to aid Eliwood as well. Athos teleported the group to Pherae, where they spent the night before setting out for Bern.\n\nEliwood and his companions clashed with one of the Reed brothers near the Bern-Pherae border, while Pent and Louise sought out an audience with Queen Hellene of Bern to ask her about the location of the Shrine of Seals.\n\nHellene had problems of her own, however, which she required Eliwood to resolve before she would aid him in finding the Shrine of Seals. Zephiel's coming of age ceremony was fast approaching, but the Fire Emblem, a vital component to the ceremony, had been stolen. Eliwood's task, therefore, was to retrieve the Fire Emblem and return it to Hellene.\n\nSearching for clues as to the Fire Emblem's whereabouts, Eliwood and his companions traveled to the royal castle of Bern and, finding it unguarded, sneaked in. They overheard Prince Zephiel playing with Princess Guinivere, and King Desmond talking to Sonia; the latter conversation confirmed that the Fire Emblem was hidden in the Black Fang's fortress. After nearly being spotted by Sonia, Eliwood fled the castle only to find Vaida harassing Nils and Ninian. Because Vaida was empowered by Nergal, Eliwood was unable to do more than fight her to a stalemate, but eventually she tired of the fight and retreated.\n\nLyn used her tracking skills to lead the group in pursuing Vaida high into the mountains, to the Black Fang fortress. They arrived in time to eavesdrop on Sonia's next assignment for Jaffar, one of the Four Fangs: to kill Prince Zephiel that night. Eliwood and company were spotted by the Black Fang, however, and some enchantment prevented them from leaving the fortress until they had fought their way through to the source of the enchantment. One of the leaders of the Black Fang had the Fire Emblem in his possession, which Eliwood took before fleeing to the manse where Zephiel and Hellene lived.\n\nThey arrived at the manse that night and succeeded in stopping the attempt on Zephiel's life. The next morning, Hellene rewarded Eliwood with a map to the Shrine of Seals.\n\nWhen they arrived at the Shrine of Seals, they found the surviving Reed brother and the last remnants of the Black Fang guarding it. After Eliwood defeated them, Athos teleported to the Shrine and admitted that while he could have simply teleported everyone else directly to the Shrine as well, he needed proof that Eliwood would not be swayed by the immense power of the Divine Weapons, and that the journey through Bern was a test of Eliwood's strength and determination. They entered the shrine and encountered Bramimond the Enigma, and they convinced it to open the seals guarding the Divine Weapons.\n\nDefeating Nergal\n\nJust as Eliwood and his party were leaving the Shrine of Seals, they encountered Nergal, fully healed and more powerful than ever. He demanded that Eliwood hand over Nils and Ninian on pain of death; Ninian volunteered to be taken hostage in exchange for Nils' freedom. Nergal agreed, and he struck Eliwood down when Eliwood objected. If not for Athos' protection, Eliwood might have died then and there.\n\nMore determined to stop Nergal than ever, Eliwood ventured into a cavern near Ostia, where the ghosts of Roland and his most trusted soldiers guarded Durandal, the Blazing Blade. Eliwood defeated the ghosts of the soldiers and obtained Durandal with Roland's blessing. Outside the cave, he was accosted by a huge dragon of ice. Before he could think to do otherwise, he took up Durandal and struck down the creature. Nergal appeared again and informed him that the dragon was none other than Ninian, who had transformed and fled again rather than obey Nergal's commands. She transformed back into her human form just long enough to say goodbye to Eliwood before dying in his arms. Athos fought Nergal, barely injuring him at all, and Nergal retreated with one last insult on the great man Athos once was, and the path that the two of them had once traveled together.\n\nExhausted and grief-stricken, Eliwood and his friends set out for Castle Ostia, where they planned to rest in preparation for the final attack on Nergal. Their rest was interrupted by a band of Nergal's morphs who had infiltrated the castle and delivered a message from Nergal: \"I await you on the Dread Isle.\" Athos realized that he would need more time to obtain certain other Divine Weapons and alert Bramimond to the threat that Nergal posed to Elibe, but Eliwood was eager to set forth for the Dread Isle and take the fight to Nergal's morphs before he could attack again. Eliwood left Durandal in Athos' care, knowing that they would meet again at the Dragon's Gate, and that when they did, he would not hesitate to take up his ancestor's Divine Weapon again.\n\nEliwood sailed to the Dread Isle a second time and destroyed most of the morphs guarding the Dragon's Gate before Athos arrived. Together they fought through the reanimated bodies of Lord Darin and the most powerful members of the Black Fang before confronting Nergal himself. With his dying breath, Nergal opened the Dragon's Gate and called three Fire Dragons through.\n\nAt that moment, Bramimond arrived and used his magic to restore Ninian to life; with her icy magic she subdued two of the dragons before collapsing from exhaustion, leaving it up to Eliwood and his friends to defeat the third. After the battle, knowing that Elibe would never be safe as long as the Dragon's Gate remained open, Nils stepped through the portal to close it from the other side.\n\nHector's tale\n\nHector's tale covers the same events as Eliwood's tale, but instead focuses on Hector as the main character. Several events are changed slightly, and some extra chapters are added:\n\nChapter 11 covers Hector's departure from Ostia with Matthew.\n\nChapter 15 is a Hector's tale-exclusive chapter that involves Hector's party defending Laus from invaders.\n\nChapter 19x pt 2 is a Hector's tale-exclusive side-chapter that becomes available if the party kills Kishuna in Chapter 19x and if Nils was at least level 7 by the end of Lyn's tale.\n\nChapter 25 is a Hector's tale-exclusive chapter that introduces a new character: Farina, one of the three pegasus sisters. She will join the party if paid 20,000 gold.\n\nChapter 30, instead of dealing with Eliwood looking for Durandal, covers Hector's search for Armads.\n\nChapter 31x also introduces a new character: the swordmaster Karla, sister to Karel. She can be recruited after a duel with Bartre, but only if he is at least a level 5 Warrior.\n\nChapter 32x is a Hector's tale-exclusive chapter that concludes the Kishuna subplot. It can be accessed if the player completes chapter 32 in 20 turns or less.\n\nIn addition, many chapters feature different or additional enemies, so the difficulty of Hector's tale is generally increased when compared to Eliwood's.\n\nGameplay\n\nThis section has been marked as a stub. Please help improve the page by adding information.\n\nOverall, The Blazing Blade features no significant changes to its gameplay compared to The Binding Blade; though there were several smaller adjustments.\n\nThe Blazing Blade reintroduces the ability for enemies to drop items upon defeat, a gameplay feature absent from The Binding Blade. Additionally, the player may now use class change and stat booster items from the preparations menu instead of deploying the desired unit to use the item in the next chapter. The Blazing Blade also removes the ability for units to gain multiple S weapon levels, instead limiting each unit to mastering only one weapon type (with one playable exception).\n\nThieves and the Transporter were both given class changes; both classes lacked the ability to class change in The Binding Blade.\n\nThe Blazing Blade also adds the ability for the player to decline side quests.\n\nCompared to The Binding Blade, The Blazing Blade has several more gameplay modes; The Binding Blade only has normal and hard, while The Blazing Blade has Lyn's tale, Eliwood's tale, and Hector's tale, with each tale having a normal and hard variant.\n\nGraphically, The Blazing Blade made revisions to several battle animations introduced in The Binding Blade. These revisions include smoothing out some animations and changing the outfits of some classes; for instance the female Sage loses the poofy sleeves on her dress and gains elbow length gloves, the Druid was given a new sound effect when performing a critical hit, the Mercenary's outfit and build were given slight modifications, and so on. Additionally, The Blazing Blade was the first Fire Emblem game to have character portraits blink during dialogue scenes.\n\nThe Binding Blade gives every weapon in the game a line of flavor text,* all language releases of The Blazing Blade instead only feature descriptions on regalia or weapons with special effects.\n\nCharacters\n\nMain article: List of characters in Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade\n\nThe Blazing Blade features 44 playable characters; however, only 42 are available in any given playthrough, as the player must choose between Karel or Harken and Wallace or Geitz, and two characters – Farina and Karla – are available only in Hector's tale. Of these 44, 13 are playable in Lyn's tale.\n\nChapters\n\nMain article: List of chapters in Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade\n\nFrom the beginning of Lyn's tale to the end of Eliwood or Hector's tale, the game is thirty-two (Eliwood) or thirty-four (Hector) chapters long, counting the prologue and final chapter but none of the side quests. The game features a total of fourty-six distinct map chapters, including side quests and alternate versions of chapters.\n\nSupport conversations\n\nMain article: List of supports in Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade\n\nDevelopment\n\nGame credits\n\nMain article: Staff of Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade\n\nPre-release builds\n\nMain articles: Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade pre-release build 0206 and Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade pre-release build 0219\n\nTwo pre-release builds of the Japanese version of The Blazing Blade were leaked to the public in 2008, and are available in patch form. Both builds are dated at approximately two months before the Japanese release and as such the bulk of the game is complete in both builds, but there are numerous unfinished and beta elements such as unfinished or different portraits, missing kanji, CG images which are either preliminary sketches or lacking the grainy sepia overlay, slightly or completely different music tracks, minor statistical differences, and numerous portions of The Binding Blade's interface left intact.\n\nReception\n\nFire Emblem: The Blazing Blade currently holds a Game Rankings aggregate score of 88.3%, which was the highest of any game in the series until Fire Emblem Awakening was released a decade later.[2]\n\nTrivia\n\nIn the Japanese release, certain functions in the game are unlocked by linking The Blazing Blade to a copy of The Binding Blade and transferring data. As The Binding Blade was not released outside Japan, this functionality was removed from international releases, and instead the content is either available by default or unavailable. Linking with The Binding Blade achieves the following effects:\n\nAllows the player to skip Lyn's tale on their first playthrough of the game and start from Eliwood's tale instead. No counterpart function exists in the international versions.\n\nTwo epilogue scenes are unlocked through linking, although both have alternate obtain criteria. A cleared Binding Blade save file which achieved the bad ending (where the game ended at Chapter 22) unlocks the first scene with Eliwood, Hector, Roy and Lilina, which can also be obtained by clearing the game nine times. A cleared save with the good endings (where the game ended at the Final Chapter) unlocks the second scene where Zephiel is confronted by Jahn, which can also be obtained by clearing the game eleven times. In the NTSC release of the game, both scenes are in the epilogue by default; in the PAL releases, both scenes are removed entirely.\n\nOf the official English localizations of the series, The Blazing Blade is the only one where item names are not capitalized as proper nouns (aside from regalia weapons and the Light Brand), and are rather presented as common nouns – for example, \"Iron Sword\" is spelled \"Iron sword\". From The Sacred Stones onward, capitalizing item names as proper nouns became the series standard. The gringe fan translation of The Binding Blade and \"Project Naga\" fan translation of Genealogy of the Holy War, however, handle item names the same way as this game.\n\nThis game supports the ability to allow characters to wink and blink during dialogue, though the former is used once in the entire game by Matthew in his recruitment conversation with Guy. Because the wink animation plays at the same speed as the blink animation, most players miss it.\n\nIf the player holds Select for a few moments in the game's Battle History in the Extras menu, a screen with a password will pop up. Despite rumors claiming that it was meant for a contest on the game's official Japanese website, no contest for The Blazing Blade has ever been held, nor were plans even made for one.[3]\n\nEtymology
