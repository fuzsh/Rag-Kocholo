        "text": "Planning on playing an Elf Blade or F/M, so no dual classing as I want to be able to use all class abilities from the start.\n\nWhich one of these will be the most fun option yet will still be viable in ToB?\n\nWhat can the Blade do that the F/M canâ€™t and vice versa?\n\n@Wowo they're not saying he can't play the way he wants to, they're saying he shouldn't give flawed advice based on personal bias that completely excises a classes legitimate abilities, within a comparison between two classes. Otherwise, they should remove F/M arcane spell casting, since combined with fighter melee ability, it completely trivializes the game content.\n\n@SionIV\n\nThey didn't nerf...they corrected, OS was NEVER supposed to stack with haste. And the difference between is 1 attack overall (the extra half-attack from the Pwnage-gauntlets puts you at 1 less attack then pre-correction OS would've, which it also combines a kai effect, so as long as the fighter isn't a part-kensai, the Blade will deal more overall melee damage despite being an attack short).\n\nArcane spells are like using ctrl+y.....so you shouldn't use those either....a single class Kensai is like using ctrl+y, so you shouldn't use that either. A single class swash-buckler is like using ctrl+y, so you shouldn't use that either. Improved haste on a fighter is like ctrl+y, shouldn't use that either. Playing any class in the game is like using ctrl+y, you shouldn't use those either. Using any kit is like using ctrl+y shouldn't use those either. Playing a solo character with all 3's is like using ctrl+y, shouldn't play those either (I've actually done this last one......though a mage/sorc needs to pick/cast find familar at creation or Tamoko will kill you in the ambush cutscene)).\n\nI've been reading most of this, and I've been seeing stuff about traps, and I don't know if anyone mentioned this, but did you know that your normal thief traps will actually do much more damage than the HLA thief traps?\n\nI was fighting demogorgon once with the original tougher demogorgon, and I used all 7 spike traps, and it would only bring him down to badly injured, then I reloaded, got rid of all the spike traps, and just laid down 7 normal thief ones, and it killed him instantly, so from that day on, I never selected HLA traps every again ( normal traps do more damage than spike, too many enemies immune to fire/ high magic resistance for fireball traps < although im not 100 % sure if MR applies for the fire ball one> and the time stop trap I've never seen any use for since you cant do damage when time is stopped) but in the end the only time I use traps ever, is to kill all the coweled wizards in Athkatla, makes it much easier to get around town, plus you can get some cOoOoOoL items and spells"
