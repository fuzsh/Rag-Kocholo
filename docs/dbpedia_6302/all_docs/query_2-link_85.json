        "text": "View: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSXToKSDucg\n\n\"game mechanic\" here could mean pretty much anything from a day/night cycle, complex city management, to the simple action of jumping.\n\nBut this video specifically goes over mechanics that on the face of it seem really interesting and add to a game's feature set, but then end up almost bafflingly underutilized to the point you wonder why it was even included.\n\nThe first example he gives is in Donkey Kong Country, which makes frequent use of animal companions like Rambi the Rhino, and in particular, Squawks the Parrot. While Squawks would go on to have roles in many Donkey Kong games, in the original Donkey Kong Country, he is used precisely once to provide a flashlight to illuminate a path in front of Donkey Kong in a single dark level of the game before he is never seen again.\n\nThe next example he goes to is Custom Moves in Smash Bros. Wii U, which are only default given to 2 characters, with the others having to be unlocked by chance over potentially hours of grinding. Then, you can only use Custom Moves in certain modes in certain circumstances, and the competitive scene hated them for modifying a character to be inconsistent with their default setup. When DLC time came around, no DLC characters even got Custom Moves, showing that Nintendo themselves apparently gave up on the mechanic they never even put much stock in to begin with.\n\nThen we go to....Shrek 2. Odd choice, but okay. Basically only 1 level in the game has a character named Fairy which is basically a Tinkerbell knockoff who has the ability to throw out sparkles from her wand that can cause both party mates and enemies to float, and floating enemies can't attack, allowing you to use Tinkerbell as basically crowd control while also letting her give party mates a lift in platforming. The ability is so specific that if you try to cheat her in to other levels, her floating mechanic doesn't even apply to other characters or enemies outside that stage, they never even programmed it to work on anything but what was included in that 1 level.\n\nNext is a quick roundup of Zelda mechanics as the series seems to basically be built on the foundation of mechanics only ever used once or twice, like the Magic Rod in Link's Awakening, most of the masks in Majora's Mask, and the spinning wheel in the Arbiter's Grounds in Twilight Princess.\n\nThe main mechanic he focuses on though is from Ocarina of Time, particularly Din's Fire. It is required to finish the game, but has only 2 use cases. Technically you can use it to hurt enemies, but there's basically no reason to use it over any other attack.\n\nNext is environmental hazards in DmC: Devil May Cry, featured in the intro that you can fling enemies up into, and then is just...never used again. Some levels have holes you can fling enemies off, but killing an enemy by flinging it into a spinning carousel is just more satisfying.\n\nThen is Batman: Arkham Knight. He calls the Batmobile overused, though he thinks it's over hated. What is underused is gadget gliding. It's cool in concept, but there ends up just being no great reason to use it most of the time. It's never used in a boss fight or given extra abilities, it's just...mediocre.\n\nIf you want the rest you'll have to watch the video.\n\nSo, I always forget it even exists, but in the first Danganronpa game, it had something called Re:Actions, which I presume was the devs' attempt to make dialog more engaging, where you can click on a highlighted item in the middle of conversation and the protagonist will ask for more detail on that specific thing. Fine idea, right? Well... it's literally only ever used for mandatory progression, if you ever see it you have to click on all of them, so it just kind of becomes... background noise, it never feels like a chore, but you just kind of forget it about after you beat the game. There is only one exception in the entire game where it's optional, and you get some extra info on a character, and it really feels like it should have been used for that purpose more. I'm always shocked to see it again anytime I watch someone else's playthrough of Danganronpa."
