Thats one of the most iconic things about the medieval ages and we dont even get that.. we always get some basic ass units. wheres the full armor horses?\n\nwe spawn in to a completely already carved out world, but imagine if the world was wiped and kingdoms had to grow, a race to power, thatd be something fun.\n\nwe need flame arrows and the ability to torch villages and castles while their people scream and try to flee while we ride through and cut them all down.. WHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ IS THE GORE!?\n\nthis game is boring asf and way too over hyped.. its fans are too respectful to say wtf tw.. instead the smallest things are celebrating.. were missing out on an amazing game!\n\ncant we have custom castles? custom troop builds so we can gear our own units and try them against pre geared tw made units/armies?\n\ndude we didnt even get co-op or a decent online experience.. where is the 20-30 players vs waves of non stop bots survival mode? castle defense? arena survival?\n\nImagine we start our own guild, our own banners and choose online challenges..\n\narena a big ass open arena where we try to complete a 10-20 wave trial that progressively gets harder.\n\nthis games just oring.. its the same boring routines and you build nothing.\n\nSALT"
