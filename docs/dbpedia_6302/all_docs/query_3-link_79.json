The Safi'jiiva, Kjarr, Alatreon and Fatalis weapons dominate each category with its potential in their respective element brackets. Read on to learn more!\n\nElemental Damage\n\nEach monster in Monster Hunter World (MHW) has elemental weaknesses and resistances that will allow you to hunt more efficiently. The best way to find out what a monster is weak to is through the Monster Field Guide.\n\nElemental Damage can be found in certain weapons. Note that not all weapons have elemental damage.\n\nDragon Fire Ice Thunder Water\n\nBest Elemental Weapons\n\nElemental Builds are the most efficient when equipping the Safi'jiiva or Kjarr weapons while being paired with the Safi'jiiva armor set. This armor set effect is activated by wearing 3 pieces of Safi'jiiva armor for the maximum output.\n\nThough, if only the weapon's elemental effect is to be considered, the Kjarr weapon will win more often than not. With the exception of the dragon element where Alatreon weapons dominate.\n\nSafi'jiiva Weapons\n\nThis is a collection of weapons that can be obtained during the Safi'jiiva Siege. By using Awakened Materials, these weapons have Awakened Abilities.\n\nYou can increase elemental damage of Safi'jiiva weapons with awakened abilities. Though, awakening weapons does take time and requires a good amount of grinding. at Awakened Level 23, a weapon is considered fully awakened and the weapon begins to change in appearance.\n\nKjarr and Taroth Weapons\n\nThis is a collection of weapons that can be obtained during the Fury of El Dorado Event Quest.\n\nKjarr and rank 8/12 Taroth weapons have one of three possible weapons skills; Critical Element which increases elemental damage, as well as Critical Status Effects and Kulve Taroth Essense.\n\nAlatreon Weapons\n\nAlatreon weapon stats have high dragon element ratings. They also naturally have purple sharpness and average Elderseal which is why it beats out the Kjarr and Taroth weapons in the Dragon Elemental Damage category.\n\nWhere the Kjarr and Taroth weapons fall short in sharpness, the Alatreon weapons dominate from the outset.\n\nFatalis Weapons\n\nAnother note-worthy mention for the Dragon Elemental Damage are the Fatalis Weapons. They strong base stats though their elemental rating is not remarkable, they make up for it with good sharpness, high Elderseal and two level four slots.\n\nBest Sword and Shield of Each Element\n\nBest Ice Element Sword and Shield\n\nKjarr Slicer \"Stream\" Rarity Attack Affinity Elem. 12 392 10 Ice 450 Def.
