        "text": "YOU DIED\n\nYou are an Undead â a creature cursed to an endless cycle of death and resurrection â newly arisen amidst a crumbling kingdom of ruin and despair. You have fragmented memories of your life before this affliction, and fleeting visions of a world from a time long gone (though exactly how long, none can say). Your soul has been hollowed out of your body, replaced by a flickering flame that sustains you instead of food and drink. Whoever you were, you now are not, and perhaps never shall be again. All you are left with now are rusted weapons and armor, rotting flesh, and a gnawing hunger to stoke your inner fire. The world you have awoken into is dying, yet you cling to a glimmer of hope that you can either find escape from this place or discover a way to restore it. Perhaps you believe both are possible… or perhaps you will lose hope and seek to damn the world as much as you yourself are.\n\nWHAT THIS IS\n\nBonfire & Blade is a rules-lite tabletop RPG inspired by the setting and themes of Dark Souls, with a system based on the excellent pamphlet RPG Vampires & Claymores. It can be run by one person facilitating the game as the Fire Keeper, with one or more players exploring the world, and a handful of 6-sided dice in two colors. It adds new rules and ideas to Vampires & Claymores' design:\n\nEarn a rest at a bonfire to recover your wounds and refill your healing flasks.\n\nHarvest Tinder from the ruins and corpses of your foes to stoke your inner fire, spending it as currency or to empower your action rolls.\n\nEach death brings new Insight into your skills and the world; use these lessons to exploit enemy weaknesses, avoid danger, or bypass challenges.\n\nUncover and declare Truths about the world that was and decide if they fill you with hope or despair. Will you eventually choose to remake the world, escape your undead curse, or fall to ruin and become a terrible new opponent?\n\nPlay for multiple sessions or follow the included advice on how to run the game in a contained and satisfying one-shot.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nWith time and enough sales, I hope to be able to provide the following updates to Bonfire & Blade:\n\nA one-page rules reference sheet.\n\nA proper character sheet for easier play.\n\nAdvice and/or assets for online play, with or without a virtual tabletop.\n\nOne or more sample adventure starters to help get your game off the ground.\n\nAn in-depth example of how to set up the game world, including sample locations and mysteries to explore.\n\nBonfire & Blade was created for the RPG LATAM JAM in April, 2021."
