        "text": "A List of the Best Medieval Sword Fighting Video Games Similar to Skyrim!\n\n(All the games in this list are available on Steam, except for the last one. The 1 to 5 star rating is for how similar to Skyrim each game is. 1 star means it’s at least similar enough to be on this list. 5 stars means it’s very similar.)\n\nIf you still play Skyrim in 2022, or you just beat Elden Ring and want another good sword fighting game to play, then you’re in the right place to learn about some other similar games you might want to check out. During my time away from work I’ve come across many sword fighting video games similar to Skyrim. Some have fantasy elements like dragons and magic. Others are more like historical fiction with castle sieges and warhorses. Some are single-player offline RPGs while others are competitive online games. But they’re all medieval, they all have swords and they all share similarities with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, one of the most popular RPGs ever made.\n\nSo today I want to share a list of what I believe to be the 22 best medieval video games like Skyrim. As always, feel free to add any medieval sword fighting video games you think should be included in this list in the comments below. I’ll probably update this list every few years as a service to anyone who is searching for a new medieval video game to play. Now, let’s get started!\n\nNote on Ranking System: I’ll be giving every game a “similar to Skyrim” rating from 1 to 5, 5 being very similar to Skyrim, so that people who’ve never heard of these games before can have a better sense of how similar to Skyrim they are, at least in my humble opinion.\n\nThe 22 Best Sword Fighting Video Games of All Time (if you still play Skyrim in 2022)!\n\n#22\n\nChivalry: Medieval Warfare & Chivalry 2\n\nDeveloped by Torn Banner Studios, 2012, 2021\n\nChivalry: Medieval Warfare’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 1/5\n\nChivalry 2’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 1/5\n\nA competitive online medieval combat game, Chivalry: Medieval Warfare was a blast to play when in its day and still is. Chivalry 2 is a whole other breed, well-loved for completely different reasons. If you want to take all the virtual swordplay skills you’ve learned from Skyrim to the online battlefield rather than another single-player role playing game, then here would be where to start.\n\nChivalry: Medieval Warfare is a skill-based sword fighting game that relies heavily on the reflexes of the player. Chivalry 2, however, takes a casual approach, making it easier for beginners to have fun, although a skilled player can still claim dominance on the ramparts with their banner raised high! Overall, the rating given for how similar to Chivalry 2 Skyrim is comes to a 1 star out of 5. Other games like Chivalry 2 are Mordhau and Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord.\n\n#21\n\nMordhau\n\nDeveloped by Triternion, 2019\n\nMordhau’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 1/5\n\nMy computer is too much of a potato to play Mordhau seriously, thank goodness, or else this list of the best medieval video games might never have been written. I might be trolling the public servers with my greatsword instead of doing everything that I know is important. Inspired by Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, Mordhau adds to the multiplayer sword-fighting experience by adding more a few more attack and defense options, as well as more customization abilities in our knightly arms and armor. With a loyal community that likes to have fun, you’re bound to have a good time escaping into this first person medieval world of real personalities online. But like in Chivalry, just be prepared to take a few beatings before you learn how to compete with the sweaty die-hard nerds. Or, if you prefer co-op, you can play the awesome horde mode. Overall, the rating given for how similar to Mordhau Skyrim is comes to a 1 star out of 5. Other good games like Mordhau are Chivalry 2 and Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord.\n\n#20\n\nEnclave\n\nDeveloped by Starbreeze Studios, 2002\n\nEnclave’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 2/5\n\nThis old RPG game is perhaps overlooked if you’re searching for other games to play after beating Skyrim. Enclave is a linear-based single-player RPG with an extensive campaign where you can play as multiple characters and choose your fighting style so it still feels open world after long epic adventures. You can play in first person or third person, use magic, swords, axes, bows and other medieval weapons. Highly unique from other sword fighting games for its retro combat system and atmosphere, Enclave deserves to be on any list of the top games like Skyrim. In fact, I played this game years ago because I was looking for an old RPG that could run on my laptop without lagging. Now I’m surprised it’s not featured on all the other lists of games like Skyrim. Overall, the rating given for how similar to Enclave Skyrim is comes to 2 stars out of 5. Other good games like Enclave are Dark Messiah of Might & Magic and Arx Fatalis.\n\n#19\n\nOverlord & Overlord 2\n\nDeveloped by Triumph Studios, 2007, 2009\n\nOverlord’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 2/5\n\nOverlord 2’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 2/5\n\nOverlord and Overlord 2 are open-world single-player RPGs similar to Skyrim except you’re limited to third person view, there aren’t many side quests and your best weapon is an army of minions who follow your every command! Your goal: to be as evil as you can. Explore a hilarious medieval fantasy world where elves are environmental activists and your minions sing Christmas carols before they tear down houses and cause other unspeakable havoc at your behest. While you direct your minions to cause mass destruction to innocent townsfolk throughout a vast medieval fantasy landscape, feel free to swing your giant sword! Also unique from other Skyrim type RPGs is your ability to upgrade and customize your home, or evil castle of doom as it should be called. After laughing a lot in the first few minutes of playing you’ll realize that the Overlord series doesn’t take itself too seriously, for the betterment of everyone who plays it. Overall, the rating given for how similar to Overlord Skyrim is comes to 2 stars out of 5. Other good games like Overlord are Fable III and Dragon’s Dogma.\n\n#18\n\nFable Anniversary\n\nDeveloped by Lionhead Studios, 2014\n\nFable Anniversary’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 3/5\n\nA remake of the first Fable from 2004 which was a massive success as one of the most popular RPG games of all time, Fable Anniversary is an open-world story-driven medieval fantasy video game like Skyrim with its many side quests and magical spells. Guns and a pet dog don’t appear until Fable II, which makes the game set in a fantasy world similar to the Late Middle Ages when guns, or miniature hand-held cannons, were first being used on across medieval battlefields and sieges. Fable III is the latest installment in the series but a Fable IIII is in the making so expect to read a lot of news and updates on that throughout 2022. If every fan of Skyrim hasn’t at least heard of the Fable series, this list will hopefully let those few remaining know that, hey, this game is awesome! Overall, the rating given for how similar to Fable Skyrim is comes to 3 stars out of 5. Other good games like Fable are Jade Empire and Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning.\n\n#17\n\nValheim\n\nDeveloped by Iron Gate AB, 2021\n\nValheim’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 2/5\n\nThe open world, building and crafting survival game Valheim is inspired by Vikings and Norse mythology. You can sail in a longship looking for treasure and materials to build your castle or whatever else you want to construct. From taming animals and fishing in rivers to battling dragons and besieging Fuling villages and castles, with your friends in co-op mode, almost anything is possible when you get creative, just like in Minecraft. And you level up your skills by using them over time, making it somewhat of an RPG. The game is in early access so you can also look forward to regular updates in 2022 and the future. Their latest big update, Hearth & Stone, has added many new building blocks to customize your dwelling. Wage war on the world with your (spoiler) blackmetal sword until every boss is beaten and your castle domineers the landscape and your ship has sailed through every randomly generated river. Overall, the rating given for how similar to Valheim Skyrim is comes to 2 stars out of 5. Other good games like Valheim are Reign of Kings and Conan Exiles.\n\n#16\n\nDragon Age: Inquisition\n\nDeveloped by BioWare, 2014\n\nDragon Age: Inquisition’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 3/5\n\nUnlike the first two Dragon Age games, the latest installment, Dragon Age: Inquisition, allows you to team up with a friend in dungeon runs in co-op mode, making it a multiplayer RPG like Skyrim that medieval open world video game lovers will appreciate. In a vast fantasy world full of quests and magical races, this medieval fantasy RPG allows you to stop time and select the attacks of your companions like a turn-based strategy game until you go back to real time to hack and slash with your sword. In the third person view, you hop from quest to quest exploring a world teeming with highly developed characters, vibrant colors and, of course, danger! If you and you’re friend are looking for a two player fantasy RPG like Skyrim to enjoy together, Dragon Age: Inquisition could be it. Overall, the rating given for how similar to Dragon Age Skyrim is comes to 3 stars out of 5. Other good games like Dragon Age are Dragon’s Dogma and Overlord.\n\n#15\n\nDark Souls III\n\nDeveloped by FromSoftware Inc, 2016\n\nDark Souls III’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 3/5\n\nA single-player medieval sword fighting RPG adventure in a harsh world where you can expect to die many times but the rewarding combat system makes you want to keep dying again… Does that sound fun at all? Dark Souls III lets you play alone or summon a friend to aid you in co-op mode, making it one of the few multiplayer games like Skyrim. The game isn’t as open-world as Skyrim but the quests, the loot, the experience points and epic gear are all there. The whole Dark Souls series together make a group of grim medieval RPG games not to be reckoned with. Popular for its sword art, the medieval weapons in the Dark Souls games are considered by many public medievalists to be slightly more realistic, at least in design, than most other fantasy RPG weapons. If you’re up for a challenge and consider yourself more than just a casual gamer, this game might test your skills. Overall, the rating given for how similar to Dark Souls Skyrim is comes to 3 stars out of 5. Other good games like Dark Souls are Elden Ring and Demon’s Souls.\n\n#14\n\nExanima\n\nDeveloped by Bare Mettle Entertainment, 2015\n\nExanima’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 1/5\n\nAs if some Einstein programmer turned Chivalry into a top-down physics-based medieval swordplay RPG game, Exanima is unlike any video game out there. If you get a kick out of ragdoll physics you might find yourself smiling constantly as you swing your sword into perfect ragdolls. But the realistic graphics, not to mention the sword fighting which is actually similar to HEMA, makes it a serious game at the end of the day. It’s definitely not to be taken lightly if you’re a fan of technical medieval melee combat in video games.\n\nMy favorite feature of Exanima was, because I kept dying in the story mode and just wanted to appreciate the amazing physics of the game, the arena! Playing in arena mode lets you start as one captain who, after working their way up the ranks of competition, builds a team of mighty contenders to get rich with. Work your way up from fighting with wooden sticks and wearing rags for armor to being festooned in burnished steel plate and wielding a historically-accurate polehammer. In addition, the game is still in early access so you might expect some updates in 2022. One of their latest updates added some magic to the game, which is really useful when being attacked by multiple enemies in the story mode. I really hope they make a multiplayer mode! Overall, the rating given for how similar to Exanima Skyrim is comes to a 1 star out of 5. Other good games like Exanima are Titan Quest and Trine.\n\n#13\n\nReign of Kings\n\nDeveloped by Code}{atch, 2015\n\nReign of King’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 1/5\n\nIf you’ve always wondered what it feels like to be a medieval king and tax everyone way too much, Reign of Kings might be a really fun time for you. You’re able to build castles with a block-by-block building system and construct trebuchets to break into the bases of other players to steal all their loot. A public server can be dominated by a clan of players who control the throne and tax the resources collected by other players. Extremely unforgiving, be prepared to fight for your life and your property as the king’s men (roleplaying gamers) come down into the country demanding tribute.\n\nFrom the wild official servers where there’s no rules with no admins, to the heavily moderated RP (role play) servers where you can’t KOS (kill on sight), Reign of Kings would be a great choice if you have other friends who also want to play a multiplayer game similar to Skyrim with you. The only catch is that there’s no magic or dragons, just the good old medieval stuff, like whips and cages! The first person sword fighting gameplay has a fun learning curve, adding a skill-based mechanic to the game and making it rewarding to get good at, not to mention addictive. Just be careful when you go offline to sleep IRL (in real life). That’s when the cowards like to pull out their trebuchets and you’ll log back in the next day with some revenge to reap! Overall, the rating given for how similar to Reign of Kings Skyrim is comes to a 1 star out of 5. Other good games like Reign of Kings are Conan Exiles and Rust.\n\n#12\n\nKingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning\n\nDeveloped by 38 Studios, Kaiko GmbH, Big Huge Games and KAIKO, 2012\n\nKingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 4/5\n\nA single-player open world RPG similar to Skyrim, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is full of many side quests and adventures in a medieval fantasy world. Perhaps its biggest difference from Skyrim is the game’s combat system. With fast-paced third person sword fighting it’s not all just button mashing. You can dodge and block which becomes very helpful, calling for skill, especially when you’re fighting multiple sorcerers at once. If you enjoy exploring a vast medieval fantasy world and building your character up from level 0, you’ll enjoy this top rated RPG of epic proportions. Like Skyrim, there is a sense of wonder you feel when you exit the gates of a city, leave civilization behind and delve into the wilderness where dangerous monsters await. All the classic tropes of what makes a medieval fantasy role playing game are here. Overall, the rating given for how similar to Kingdoms of Amalur Skyrim is comes to 4 stars out of 5. Other good games like Kingdoms of Amalur are Fable II and The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings.\n\n#11\n\nDragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen\n\nDeveloped by Capcom and QLOC, 2013\n\nDragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 4/5\n\nTo play the expansion and re-release of Dragon’s Dogma from 2013, Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen, means you’re prepared for an open world single-player RPG with a ferocious appetite. But you don’t have to do it alone. Choose your AI companions carefully to compliment your own play style. Choose which gear your companions use as you loot chests and progress through the main story quest, nocking off many side quests along the way.\n\nWhen you’re not traveling across the landscape with your party of heroes, you’re crawling through dungeons wishing you had bought more health potions back in civilization. But no matter, it’s a good thing you have a mage on your team who can heal you. She’s been working great with that new archer you hired for this stupid side quest. But a dangerous errand can turn into a magical adventure when you organize your inventory and plan ahead. Where will the next quest take you? Overall, the rating given for how similar to Dragon’s Dogma Skyrim is comes to 4 stars out of 5. Other good games like Dragon’s Dogma are Dragon Age and Final Fantasy X.\n\n#10\n\nJade Empire\n\nDeveloped by BioWare and LTI Gray Matter, 2005\n\nJade Empire’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 3/5\n\nTake your craving for a single-player sword fighting adventure into Jade Empire, a fictional empire inspired by medieval China! Choose your weapons and spells carefully because you never know what kind of spirits and monsters you’ll face on the battlefield. Jade Empire could be a great substitute if you loved Skyrim but want a good katana video game to play. All the many Eastern weapons are a beautiful sight.\n\nJade Empire forces you to choose your attacks carefully as your opponents might have secret magical defenses. Switch between fighting styles and stances to react to your opponents fighting style, whether you prefer a polearm, magical spells or a combination of both. Sometimes you can’t always fight the way you want when the enemy forces you to switch weapons or fighting styles. It’s a game mechanic hard to find in other single-player RPGs and this one did it so well. Of course, this medieval RPG is one of the best! Overall, the rating given for how similar to Jade Empire Skyrim is comes to 3 stars out of 5. Other good games like Jade Empire are Fable III and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.\n\n#9\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\n\nDeveloped by CD Projekt, CD Projekt RED, 2015\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 4/5\n\nWith an attention to detail unbeaten by any open world fantasy video game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is sure to impress the die-hard medieval RPG fan. From riding into a camp of bandits swinging your sword from the saddle of your horse to sailing from island to island in search of epic loot, there’s a niche to carve out for all your favorite aspects of any single player RPG in this game. Just make sure you know who your working for before you accept a contract to slay a monster in some gloomy crypt…\n\nBut seriously, what’s more fun than riding your horse into a castle courtyard swinging your sword at knights. Maybe dismounting to cast powerful fire spells? Fight stealthily or aggressively; fight your way across a massive fantasy world full of cities, villages, caves and other dangerous places to explore. The whole Witcher video games series offers complex stories and gaming experiences you’re sure to not forget easily. Overall, the rating given for how similar to Witcher 3 Skyrim is comes to 4 stars out of 5. Other good games like Witcher 3 are Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Ghost of Tsushima.\n\n#8\n\nMount & Blade 2: Bannerlord\n\nDeveloped by TaleWorlds Entertainment, 2020\n\nMount & Blade 2: Bannerlord’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 2/5\n\nTake a step back and strategize the best way to besiege the enemy’s castle. Once all your men and trebuchets are in place, exit your top-down strategy game viewpoint and enter first person mode to stride into battle with your sword swinging! Although the Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord series has no magic unless you download community mods, it’s a medieval war game similar to Skyrim because of its role playing system, allowing you to customize your character completely from level 0 and upward until you’re the king of the entire realm. Also, the game has popular multiplayer modes so you can take your knowledge of medieval combat to other players around the world. A sequel to the popular RPG Mount & Blade: Warband, our boy Bannerlord offers everything the prequel had and more. Catch an idea of what it might have been like to control an army on campaign against another nation in medieval times with this masterpiece. Overall, the rating given for how similar to Mount and Blade Skyrim is comes to 2 stars out of 5. Other good games like Mount and Blade are Total War: Shogun 2 and Medieval Dynasty.\n\n#7\n\nArx Fatalis\n\nDeveloped by Arkane Studios, 2002\n\nArx Fatalis’ Similar to Skyrim Rating: 3/5\n\nAlthough the maps are linear rather than open world, Arx Fatalis is a top sword fighting game you should play if you like Skyrim and old school graphics in general. On a single-player medieval dungeon crawling RPG adventure, you loot for supplies and progress through wild medieval quests, leveling up your abilities, until you’re ready to face the final challenge of miserable life. I hope you sharpened your sword!\n\nThe first person sword fighting allows for gamers to take full advantage of distance and footwork, as well as location-specific damage, which is impressive considering how outdated the game is. This old sword fighting game feels like exploring a very, very large cave in Skyrim, but the challenges and puzzles may be more difficult than what you’re used to, making it a fantasy world easy to escape into and become fully immersed in. Don’t use your loot unwisely! Overall, the rating given for how similar to Arx Fatalis Skyrim is comes to 3 stars out of 5. Other good games like Arx Fatalis are Rune and The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.\n\n#6\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\n\nDeveloped by Bethesda Softworks, Bethesda Game Studios, 4J Studios and Superscape, 2006\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 5/5\n\nIf your favorite game is still Skyrim in 2022 but you still haven’t tried The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, you may be missing out on a great time. The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, too, because it’s 3D and open-world, is very similar to Skyrim and could be a great supplement to continue your medieval fantasy adventures. In fact, the whole Elder Scrolls series is amazing, with the latest installment being the highly rated The Elder Scrolls Online. But I’m not alone in saying that the fourth game in the series, Oblivion, is the best!\n\nFrom riding horses through the forest with a torch in your hand to scaling the ramparts of medieval cities chopping down archers with your sword, the Skyrim-style excitement is all there in Oblivion, baby. I would even go as far to say, and this is just my opinion, that Oblivion is better than Skyrim. The story speaks for itself. Overall, the rating given for how similar to Oblivion Skyrim is comes to 5 stars out of 5. Other good games like Oblivion are Gothic II and Dark Messiah of Might & Magic.\n\n#5\n\nThief: Deadly Shadows\n\nDeveloped by Ion Storm and IOMO, 2004\n\nThief: Deadly Shadows’ Similar to Skyrim Rating: 3/5\n\nIf your favorite guild in Skyrim was the Thieves Guild then you’ll most likely get a kick out of Thief: Deadly Shadows. It’s almost as if this game was a spinoff of the Thieves Guild in Oblivion, even though it was released in 2004. There are prequels and sequels in the game’s series but Thief: Deadly Shadows, because of its impressive 3D graphics which can still satisfy fatherless generation Z gamers today, is a cult classic that has earned a spot in the list of the best medieval video games of all time. It’s a gem if you’re looking for old sword fighting games or crave a medieval quest that requires more than just button mashing. Move slow and think before you act because sneaking around with your bow and arrow could easily turn into fending off a dozen knights with your sword if a guard rings the alarum. And make sure you find all the loot! You couldn’t be a medieval thief without epic loot. Overall, the rating given for how similar to Thief Skyrim is comes to 3 stars out of 5. Other good games like Thief are Unknightly and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.\n\n#4\n\nDark Messiah of Might & Magic\n\nDeveloped by Arkane Studios, Kuju, Floodgate Entertainment, Ubisoft Annecy, 2006\n\nDark Messiah of Might & Magic’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 3/5\n\nAlthough it’s linear-based rather than open-world, Dark Messiah of Might & Magic will not leave you hanging when it comes to a profound fantasy RPG adventure. The combat is very similar to Skyrim, which is a plus, and the leveling-up system allows for a wide variety of different play styles, especially as the environments offer up many interesting opportunities to do more damage than a sword could ever do. While you’re limited to the first-person view, you’ll explore many fascinating environments and encounter many unique enemies.\n\nFrom slaying spiders deep underground to fighting orcs atop mountains, there’s no landscape and no monster you can’t conquer with might and magic. If you like Skyrim, especially if you’re favorite part of the game was the first person sword fighting, then Dark Messiah of Might & Magic is definitely another game to play in 2022 while you wait for the next installment in the Elder Scrolls series. Overall, the rating given for how similar to Dark Messiah Skyrim is comes to 3 stars out of 5. Other good games like Dark Messiah are Arx Fatalis and The Elder Scrolls IV: Morrowind.\n\n#3\n\nGothic 3\n\nDeveloped by Piranha Bytes, 2006\n\nGothic 3’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 5/5\n\nIf you’ve already beaten all the Elder Scrolls games and want the next best thing, the Gothic series is where to go, especially Gothic 3 as it’s the closest game to Skyrim you’re likely to ever find outside of the Elder Scrolls series. Whether it’s traveling through the woods at night with a torch or raiding caves with halberds and fire spells that you love most out of any single-player open-world RPG, Gothic 3 has it for you. With a giant map and hundreds of side quests, there’s so much to explore and see in this underrated masterpiece that still has a following on Twitch. Like in Skyrim, you’re able to switch back and forth between third and first person view, allowing you to absorb full panoramic views of luscious medieval scenery or narrow your view in the dark dungeons of castles. For a game that was released in 2006, the 3D graphics are still impressive today. And the developers are currently re-mastering the first game in the series, Gothic, so stay tuned for news about that RPG game while you wait for The Elder Scrolls VI. Overall, the rating given for how similar to Gothic Skyrim is comes to an exploding 5 out of 5 stars. Other good games like Gothic are Risen and The Witcher.\n\nPostscript note from 2024: Since writing this article I also tried The Chronicles of Myrtana: Archolos, which is a full conversion mod for Gothic 2 that won a Mod of the Decade award and I must highly recommend it! Also, I don’t think I gave Gothic 1 and 2 enough credit here, as after beating them both in 2022 for the first time I think I enjoyed them much more than Gothic 3.\n\n#2\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance\n\nDeveloped by Warhorse Studios, 2018\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 5/5\n\nUnique from every other 3D single-player, Kingdom Come: Deliverance open-world RPG that came before it because it’s practically a historical fiction and nothing like a fantasy game. The developers hired professional medievalists to make the world realistic and as close to the real Middle Ages as they could without sacrificing enjoyment for the player.\n\nAlthough the map isn’t very large compared to other games in the genre, even things like travel are more historical than conventional RPGs so the world will seem bigger as traveling is slower and more dangerous. And I’ll just say it’s impossible to make a wholly realistic sword fighting game but if I had to pick the most realistic sword fighting game so far it would have to be this one for sure.\n\nIf you prefer the more technical kind of sword fighting you find in games like Mordhau then you’ll probably appreciate this game’s first-person combat system and swordplay mechanics. It’s another thing that makes this game unique as there are dozens of different attack options at your disposal, which means sword fights are much more fluid and realistic. The thing that makes it similar to Skyrim is the sense of wonder and adventure you get when discovering new areas and exploring in first person. From looting chests to choosing which skills you want to spend your experience points in, most of the similarities are there. The nature scenes are incredible, which makes wandering through towns to soak up gossip like wondering through Oblivion‘s Imperial City. By Azura, by Azura, by Azura, this game is an arena grand champion! (Apologies if you don’t get that Oblivion reference.) Overall, the rating given for how similar to Kingdom Come Skyrim is comes to a whopping 5 out of 5 stars. Other good games like Kingdom Come are Swordsman VR and Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord.\n\n#1\n\nDie by the Sword\n\nDeveloped by Treyarch, 1998\n\nDie by the Sword’s Similar to Skyrim Rating: 2/5\n\nTo introduce the #1 game in our list, Die by the Sword, to people who’ve never heard of it before, let me tell you how I experienced it for the first time. I was a sweaty 16-year-old loser back in 2007 playing a video game from 1998. In my group home I wasn’t allowed to use the Internet or play M-for-mature rated games (don’t ask why) but one of the staff members secretly handed me the full package, expansion pack and all, baby, on a burnt CD that didn’t care or not if I was connected to the Internet. The expansion pack is called Limb for Limb, because you’re able to chop bodies from limb to limb, and me being a troubled youth at the time you can imagine how much fun I had taking out some anger with my virtual medieval sword!\n\nFor 1998, Die by the Sword is some high-tech stuff because, if you select the right settings in the menu, you literally need to drag your mouse across your desktop just to swing your sword! That’s why it’s so ahead of its time, considering VR games today in 2022 have similar gameplay but with motion sensors. The game is linear-based but altogether its a long journey through many grim medieval environments.\n\nDie by the Sword might be the best medieval sword video game ever made because of the skill that it requires, emulating an entertaining sword fight the best a working man’s personal computer could do in 1998. Like in Chivalry, you have to be aware of which direction your blade is attacking in and you control it with the direction of your mouse. Being conscious of your sword becomes more important once you also take distance and footwork into the matter. In a 3D world, in 1998–don’t tell me this is just some Pacman stuff. This is history! Those Zelda games where all you had to do was mash the right button at the right time to make a “sword-strike” are a lot different than a game like Die by the Sword where you have to literally draaaag your mouse across the desk accurately to get a decapitation just the way you want it. As it is with Chivalry and Mordhau, the direction you swing your mouse when you attack determines the accuracy of your strike. Even Skyrim, which takes into account timing and distance, doesn’t give you nearly as much control of your weapon as Die by the Sword, and that’s saying something considering that Skyrim was made 13 years later. Today, I may wish I was a kid again, but I’ll never regret being born in 1991 so that I could appreciate the novelty of this classic medieval sword game. I hope you enjoy it as much as the sweaty 16-year-old me did. And make sure to keep reading for some final remarks. I hope I was of assistance in helping you find your next video game to play. Overall, the rating given for how similar to Die by the Sword Skyrim is comes to 2 stars out of 5. Other good games like Die by the Sword are Rune and Enclave.\n\nList of the Best Medieval Sword Fighting Games Similar to Skyrim in Proper Order\n\nThe best medieval video games like Skyrim in proper order are:\n\nDie by the Sword\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance\n\nGothic 3\n\nDark Messiah of Might & Magic\n\nThief: Deadly Shadows\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\n\nArx Fatalis\n\nMount & Blade 2: Bannerlord\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\n\nJade Empire\n\nDragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen\n\nKingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning\n\nReign of Kings\n\nExanima\n\nDark Souls III\n\nDragon Age: Inquisition\n\nValheim\n\nFable Anniversary\n\nOverlord & Overlord 2\n\nEnclave\n\nMordhau\n\nChivalry: Medieval Warfare & Chivalry 2\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nSome honorable mentions that nearly made it into this list of are:\n\nElden Ring (released 2022)\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword\n\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of Mordor\n\nPirates, Vikings and Knights II\n\nFor Honor\n\nTwo Worlds & Two Worlds II\n\nDemon’s Souls\n\nGothic & Gothic II\n\nThe Witcher & The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings\n\nKengo: Legend of the 9\n\nBushido Blade & Bushido Blade 2\n\nGhost of Tsushima\n\nRisen 3\n\nAssassins Creed Valhalla\n\nPlease speak your mind freely and recommend any medieval video games you think should be included in this list in the comments below.\n\n* * * Final Remarks – I hope you enjoyed this list of the best medieval video games! * * *\n\nIf you enjoyed this list of top games like Skyrim then check out my list of the best medieval movies.\n\nWhen it comes to playing video games, I’d highly recommend doing something more productive like hiking or reading but, hey, video games are awesome, especially video games with swords and knights set in the Middle Ages! Back in 2016 I wrote a whole post on why reading books is better than playing video games. Well, after reading hundreds of books and getting a university education since then, it’s nice to explore medieval worlds through other mediums besides books every once in a while. I believe video games can be a great way to fulfil your fascination of everything medieval, but I wouldn’t recommend being addicted to them like I was for many years.\n\nFor your interest, if there’s any qualification needed to write a list of the best medieval video games, here’s mine: I waited out in a freezing parking lot, in Canada’s frigid winter, behind hundreds of people at Skyrim‘s midnight release back in November of 2011. The wait was worth every aching minute, especially as I took a week off work to play the game non-stop on my Xbox 360 while my roommate did the same thing on his PC in the other room. We were so cool! Maybe.\n\nThere are plenty of amazing sword and melee video games that could’ve been on this list if only they were set in the Middle Ages or at least in a medieval-esque fantasy universe. Such games are Hellish Quart, Warhammer: Vermintide 2, Greedfall and Conan Exiles. There are also many fun melee games that don’t include swords like Condemned: Criminal Origins, Dying Light 2 and No More Room in Hell, so I thought I’d mention those here although I might save them for another post about melee video games in the future. On that note, please mention any good melee games you know or share this list with your friends. Because, maybe this is not about me feeling better about myself for “wasting” so much time playing video games in my youth rather than appreciating history when I try to convince whoever might read this (you) that it’s never too late, even if you’re crippled and in your ’90s, to play Die by the Sword for the first time right after playing Skyrim just to appreciate the awesomeness of the evolution of 3D sword-fighting video games in the 21st century AD, of humankind, of life, or death for that matter, on Earth."
