        "text": "Even though I ended up really positive on Alien, I often find tabletop RPGs based on existing properties to be under satisfying. My preference is to play in new worlds, allowing works of art I like to influence me as I tell fresh stories rather than trying to rehash ones I’ve seen before. That being said, a film like Blade Runner did significantly define the cyberpunk genre, one that’s extremely popular in the medium of tabletop RPGs, so Free League Publishing’s Blade Runner: The Roleplaying Game makes sense as their next big adaptation.\n\nIt’s very clear that the team behind the book are passionate about the films. A large portion of the book is dedicated to painting the setting, which takes place between the two films in the year 2037, in painstaking detail. This section functions as a more robust version of the text that precedes each film, going in depth on the rise of the Wallace Corporation and the current structure of the world. While the world of Blade Runner is interesting, it does feel like it hasn’t evolved with the rest of the cyberpunk genre. Sure there’s evil megacorporations and wealth inequality, but the setting doesn’t seem as vibrant or exciting as new games in the genre, like Free League’s other recent release Cy_Borg.\n\nFor Blade Runner fans, there’s a lot of backstory to dive into, but since it’s a world we’ve seen before there are a lot less surprises.\n\nSince all players are Replicant-hunting Blade Runners, character creation feels a little flat to me. Aside from choosing between human and replicant, which has slight mechanical differences, there are different archetypes that you can play as, such as cityspeaker and enforcer, but these end up feeling slightly generic. The classes affect your stats, which are broken down into attributes and skills, like all other games that share the Year Zero engine that Blade Runner is based on. Instead of being standard number scores, these stats all have letter grades that correspond to the die you will roll when doing a check.\n\nFor example, if you’re in a fist fight, you may have a D8 in the hand-to-hand skill and a D10 in the strength attribute. Roll a six or higher on either die, that counts as a success. Roll a 10 or higher, that’s two successes. Rolling multiple successes across your two dice gives you a critical success, which can have extra effects to your action. You can push yourself to reroll dice, but at the risk of hurting yourself. It’s a smart system that incentivizes you to use the skills you’re good at while still giving you a chance of success even when you’re using your worst stats.\n\nYour character also has some built in elements to help you figure out who they are aside from their stats. As part of set up, you will define a key relationship and memory to help sketch out your character’s past and present. These can be used by the GM to help build events in the game, tying the ongoing action to your character in more personal ways. You also have a signature item, which can be used during a scene to help you recover.\n\nCombat has some interesting wrinkles to it, but can feel a bit fiddly. There’s lots of rules for different things like falling, drowning and fire damage, which can sometimes slow things down at the table while you’re trying to remember all the specific rules. The main core of the game relies not only on damage, but a crit die for each weapon. Any time you roll a critical success with your attack, you get to roll the crit die of your weapon, which causes an injury to the target in addition to the standard damage. These have both narrative and mechanical effects, making for satisfyingly cinematic fights. For example, that punch you do may knock out their teeth, causing them to have disadvantage on manipulation rolls, while the gunshot may give them a bleeding gut, causing any mobility roll to re-open the wound. It’s a lot of different dice values to keep track of, but once you do it feels a bit more dynamic than a standard D&D fight.\n\nSince Replicants often run from their pursuers, the game outlines some clever rules for both on-foot and car chases. Each round, both the pursuer and the prey secretly select from a series of maneuvers in an attempt to catch up to or lose the other person. Once those are chosen, a random obstacle is rolled, adding both flavor and consequence to that moment in the chase. The prey may have their hide maneuver canceled by running into a dead end, while a crowd of people with umbrellas may give that same hide maneuver advantage. It’s a smart system that allows for another way to resolve action aside from a straight up fight.\n\nThe biggest hook for this game to me is the investigation structure. Each day of the investigation is timed out to have four shifts, forcing players to use their time wisely. Story beats will happen that cause the case to progress to its climax as more shifts go by, ensuring that there’s always forward momentum carrying things towards a dramatic conclusion. This encourages players to split the party, covering the maximum amount of ground as the clock ticks down. If you get the Blade Runner Starter Set, which is sold separately from the core rulebook, it comes with a premade case file called Electric Dreams that contains crime scene photos, newspaper articles and all sorts of other ephemera to help set the scene for the mystery at hand. The rulebook does outline tools to create your own case files, but the production value that goes into the Electric Dreams is what makes it really shine.\n\nI’m interested to see how I would feel after a long campaign of this, as it seems like continually playing as a Blade Runner would not be sustainable. Through the films we learn of the injustice built into the systems that Blade Runners defend, making it a moral area I’m not sure I’d want to continue treading in without shifting into fighting against those systems. The game does some work to allow for this push and pull, rewarding you with promotion points when you follow orders and humanity points when you ‘do the right thing,’ so there’s definitely space to explore how to rebel against authority while still working within it, asking important questions about personhood and justice. All of Free League’s upcoming case files will eventually be connected, so time will tell if they are able to walk that narrative tightrope.\n\nThere are many other smaller tabletop games that do parts of what Blade Runner does in a more streamlined fashion. Cy_Borg offers a more flavorful cyberpunk dystopia, with a strong visual identity and aggressive style. Bindlewood Bay has a more freeform mystery system that is less about moving characters towards a predetermined solution and more about letting the players be the author of the solution. Blade Runner is one of the most narrowly focused RPGs I’ve seen in a long time, but that focus gives you the tools to live out your own Blade Runner movie.\n\nEspecially while using the case file, you’re in for a highly polished experience that’s fraught with decisions that question your conceptions of identity and memory.\n\nThe latest edition of the Popcorn Frights Film Festival is underway, unleashing movie premieres, repertory screenings, and horror celebrations with much more still to come.\n\nOpening weekend kicked off with a variety of repertory screenings of Psycho Cop Returns, Maniac Cop 2, Maniac, Society, the “lost” cut of Return of the Living Dead 3, and more with the filmmakers in attendance. It also came with a slew of brand new premieres from emerging filmmakers.\n\nHere’s a round-up of some of Popcorn Frights 2024’s feature offerings so far…\n\nBeezel\n\nDirector Aaron Fradkin explores the enduring, grisly horrors lurking within the bowels of a New England home via an experimental triptych. Co-written with Victoria Fratz, Beezel begins with an appropriately gnarly child death in the ’60s, shot on Super 8, kicking off three different experiences with witchy terror stretched over six decades. Fradkin puts heavy emphasis on scare-crafting, ensuring every second of screen time is dedicated to the build-up or release of a scare, including all the familiar tactics you’d expect. The magic in Beezel isn’t in its bid to induce chills, though that’s commendable, but rather in its unique narrative structure.\n\nFradkin seamlessly connects three distinct perspectives and stories through technology in a seamless way. Super 8 grit fades into VHS static as the ’60s jump to the ’80s to close out an era of witchy torment. The transition from analog to digital is particularly inspired, though it heralds in the longest and most unfulfilling story of the three, which sees Fratz step in front of the camera as the unlikeable wife of the home’s latest heir. While Fradkin packs this segment full of lore and nightmarish freak-outs, it’s not enough to mask the narrative and budgetary constraints, further unhelped by the central couple’s lack of chemistry or logic.\n\nBeezel wisely keeps its mythology shrouded in mystery, never overexplaining its hand. Early teases never pan out in the obvious or expected path, and the deaths can be delightfully gory. The rough acting and jump scare tactics can distract, but it’s the innovative narrative structure that sets this gory witch tale apart.\n\nChateau\n\nWriter/Director Luke Genton‘s screenlife influencer horror movie calls found footage hits like Hell House LLC and Deadstream to mind. Cathy Marks stars as James, an aspiring YouTuber who rents a haunted French chateau on the advice of her best pal Dash (Coltron Tran) in the hopes of going viral. James covertly gets hired as Chateau’s housekeeper, planning to vlog her time there in secret from the homeowner. Of course, the longer James stays, the more she uncovers the truth behind the place: those who die on the property are doomed to linger there in the afterlife.\n\nThe friendship between James and Dash is endearing, offsetting some of the pitfalls that come with influencer horror. Specifically, it goes far in humanizing a self-serving protagonist. Genton attempts to further overcome that hurdle by introducing familial trauma, something that factors into James’ arc in the back half, though it’s handled in a familiar, superficial way. Of course, Genton’s aim is simply to deliver a fun, frightful, good time, not reinvent the found footage format. Those who come looking for just that may find it here, largely thanks to the beguiling Chateau itself and the inventive camera setups Genton employs to make this haunted house a character itself. But those tired of the subgenre won’t be moved by the familiar trappings of the found footage format, motion sickness inducing shaky cam in parts and all.\n\nStrange Darling\n\nOne of the best genre films of the year, writer/director JT Mollner’s Strange Darling screened in-person at the fest ahead of its release next week on August 23. It’s the type of film that’s best going in blind, packed with narrative turns and unexpected detours, so just know this: the plot follows the exploits of a serial killer who may have met their match. Mollner boldly tells their story nonlinearly, a risky move that pays off in spades thanks to a tremendous pair of lead performances, stunning 35mm cinematography by Giovanni Ribisi (yes, that one), and endless style.\n\nWilla Fitzgerald and Kyle Gallner embark on a violent, thrilling cat-and-mouse game that takes no prisoners- including the audience. Told in six chapters and presented out of order, Strange Darling is a surprising crowd-pleaser that’s meticulously plotted and richly acted. Mollner was recently announced as the screenwriter behind The Long Walk, and it’s not hard to see why with Strange Darling. It’s violent, twisty, and thrilling, so don’t miss it when it releases next week.\n\nThere’s a Zombie Outside\n\nMultihyphenate writer/director/producer Michael Varrati goes meta with hyper specificity in There’s a Zombie Outside. Ben Bauer takes on a dual role, sort of, as the star of a cult zombie movie and the actor who plays him. When the film’s horny zombie bleeds over into the real world and begins invading Ben’s LA life, fact and fiction blur and Ben is thrown into an existential nightmare. Varrati explores the crossroads of identity through his lead actor, torn between the distinctly separate worlds of horror and the Los Angeles gay community, deepening the meta layers further by appearing in a voiceover capacity as the cult film’s director.\n\nThere’s a Zombie Outside stacks the horror side of the equation full of notable stalwarts, including Tiffany Shepis as Officer Findlay, Peaches Christ, and the voices of Lori Cardille (George Romero’s Day of the Dead) and Elizabeth Coffey (John Waters’ Pink Flamingos and Female Trouble). The stalking zombie is also appropriately great, with a particular make out scene that makes you eager to see the original cult feature nestled within the overarching meta-story. But There’s a Zombie Outside, for all its dizzying bending of reality, is less a horror movie and more an inward meditation on identity. That it spends more time grappling with the industry side of filmmaking and Ben’s Los Angeles friend group diminishes its accessibility to a wider audience. It’s a personal story told with hyperspecificity and an eroding grip on reality, which makes it all the more disorienting for Ben and the viewer.\n\nStay tuned for additional dispatches from Popcorn Frights."
