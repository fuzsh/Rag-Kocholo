        "text": "Almost 15 years ago, I played my first Monster Hunter game, Monster Hunter Freedom Unite on the PSP. Fast forward to 2022 and here I am playing yet another game in the series, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak.\n\nThe more things change, the more they truly stay the same.\n\nWith more than 150 hours spent in the game, it amazes me just how much time I’ve sunk — and continue to sink — on this series. Even as I’ve gotten older and have less free time to spend on video games in general, I always somehow find the time for Monster Hunter.\n\nTECHNOBUBBLE GUIDES: MONSTER HUNTER RISE SUNBREAK\n\nAll Post-Game Secret Monsters and How to Unlock Them in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak\n\nAll Male and Female Armor Through Master Rank 100 in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak\n\nHow to Meld Rarity 10 Talismans in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak\n\nAll Sub-Camp and Buddy Recon Point locations in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak\n\nAll Decorations and Rampage Decos for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak\n\nI was there back when Monster Hunter was a niche series that didn’t have much mainstream appeal outside of Japan except for a dedicated core group of enthusiasts. And here I still am with the series garnering mass worldwide appeal with the success of Monster Hunter World.\n\nA big reason is that the franchise keeps giving me a reason to come back. There’s just something about Monster Hunter, whether it be the gameplay, the monsters or everything else in between that just clicks and resonates with me.\n\nAt the same time, being a longtime player means that I also notice a lot of things, not just what’s new and improved about the latest games but what might be missing as well. This was apparent in Monster Hunter Rise, which boasted excellent gameplay and really great monster design but also released with an incomplete campaign and an endgame that felt a bit uneven.\n\nI still decided to give the game the benefit of the doubt, however, due to the staffing challenges posed by a historic pandemic and the promise of free title updates. Well, that and the fact that the Monster Hunter team has always gone the extra mile in putting out a painstakingly polished product prior to Rise.\n\nNow the team gets its mulligan with the Sunbreak expansion and the arrival of Master Rank monsters (or G-rank for old-school players). The question now is, does Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, well, rise to the occasion?\n\nA whole new world in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak\n\nFresh off from your success in finishing off the monster rampage from Rise, Kamura’s newly won peace is jolted once again with the arrival of a new wolf-like monster from beyond its shores.\n\nThe invading Lunagaron, however, also brings with it a new reliable ally. This would be Argosy captain Rondine’s older sister, Fiorayne, the vice-leader of the Kingdom’s royal knight order. With Kamura’s ally in trouble, your hunter gets shipped off, literally, to the knight base of Elgado to help deal with a new monster threat.\n\nI must say that after playing Rise on the Switch, moving to the PC — which had a simultaneous launch with Nintendo’s console this time around — was a marked difference visually. I had to deal with some driver issues at first. But once that was fixed via a pre-release patch from Capcom, it’s been smooth sailing since.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, Sunbreak looks quite good for a Switch game. The PC version, however, is a different beast altogether, especially when played on an ultra-wide display. And I’m not a PC elitist by any means.\n\nIt actually makes me wish that the game had cross-saves between the Switch and PC as redoing the base Rise campaign was tough. Even after rushing through the original campaign, it still took me 40 hours to get to Sunbreak. Plus the rush meant I started the expansion without my collection of decorations and weapons from hundreds of hours played on the Switch. As someone whose main group also plays on the Switch, it would have been nice to be able to continue my progress through both systems. I actually had hope for a while after cross-saves were included in the list of questions from an official Capcom survey for the game. Alas, that was not meant to be, which meant duplicating the same effort on two versions of the game, especially since early review copies were limited to PC.\n\nAll of that was ultimately worth it, however. The buttery frame rate and quick input response are just some of the benefits of the PC version. This not only makes the game a more aesthetically pleasing experience overall but also makes a big difference gameplay-wise in terms of move timing. I have an easier time pulling off guard points and counters more consistently in the PC version, for example. The increased visual fidelity also further spotlights the stars of Sunbreak’s show, its monsters, which come alive in crisp and vivid detail.\n\nLittle touches like monster scales and hair strands are suddenly more noticeable, a reflection of the painstaking work that artists pour into every individual creature. The environments, while not as detailed as World and Iceborne, also get a facelift. I especially like the new Jungle map, a kicked-up reimagining of a classic Monster Hunter stage, that is now my favorite location in the game. In addition to the nostalgia factor for longtime hunters such as myself, the new map just has a nice flow to its design that makes exploring it a treat. This is especially true in comparison to the other new location, the Citadel. That map is quite big but feels a bit unwieldy to go through, even with fast-travel locations and the new Buddy Recon points that you can use once per hunt in addition to the traditional camps.\n\nThe game’s endemic life, meanwhile, comes alive in the new maps, providing an extra advantage for resourceful hunters who know how to use them. Use a Marionette Spider to slam a monster into walls that have Starburst Bugs and they crash down to the ground and get afflicted with the bugs’ specific elemental blight. Bait a monster next to a wall with Slicer Crabs and they’ll get pelted with sharp, cutting projectiles that get even more aggressive if a monster is knocked down.\n\nIf you attract a monster to the shores of the Jungle’s northern beach area, they’ll take damage from a school of Spearsquid that circles around its shallow waters. It basically builds on the environmental interactions seen in World and Iceborne.\n\nLittle details such as these show the typical attention to detail from the staff that I love about the series. From the heartwarming expression that your Cohoot owl gives you when you pet it to quest girl Chichae’s adorable tendency to check to her left and right for danger, Sunbreak is filled with all these seemingly little things that bring its world to life.\n\nI actually have volumes of Monster Hunter books from Japan that show how monsters are designed — including biological traits taken from real-world animals that are individually illustrated during the design process — and the research that goes into each creature is mind-blowing. I mean, just check out the video I did on the making of Kulu-Ya-Ku, and that’s just for one monster. The fact that so much attention is given to details that most players will likely just gloss over shows the kind of dedication, love and care from the staff that I have always admired.\n\nFurther adding to the overall experience is the game’s sound, which continues to do a great job in setting the mood. When you’re just gathering or moving through an area, for example, the orchestral music recedes to the background while environmental sound effects from crickets and birds or falling rain are played up to immerse yourself in what is around you. Once you meet a monster, however, the dramatic music comes to life, making it feel like an epic encounter.\n\nI also tip off my cap to the localization team, who did a bang-up job with the translation of the game’s dialogue. I can’t remember how many times I caught myself chuckling over things like Chichae’s inner monologue fantasies or an NPC at the Elgado outpost asking, “You’re not letting your cats go feral, are you?”\n\nThen you’ve got creative quest names like “Oy My Garsh Harag” and “Moonlit Espinascapade.”\n\nYup, that’s the Monster Hunter localization team I know, alright.\n\nMonster Hunter Sunbreak’s monster mash\n\nUltimately, Monster Hunter is all about one thing, monsters.\n\nWell, monsters and armor are actually among its weaponry of diverse elements. Actually, now that I mention weaponry, it should be monsters, armor and weapons. OK, monsters, armor, weapons and gameplay is what Monster Hunter is all about.\n\nI’m not sure why but I’m thinking of the Spanish Inquisition all of a sudden.\n\nNow as someone who has been playing Monster Hunter since Freedom Unite, the new monsters from Rise were among my favorites in the series from a design perspective. I just love the creativity behind them, whether it be the kung-fu stylings of Aknosom or the Olympic-worthy gymnastic moves of Bishaten.\n\nIt’s a theme that continues with the Sunbreak expansion. While Rise had a theme inspired by the “hyakki-yakou” or “Night Parade of a Hundred Demons” from Japanese folklore, Sunbreak adopts a more Western touch. This is apparent not just with Elgado’s Royal Knight Order but the design of its Three Lords — Lunagaron, Garangolm and Malzeno — who are obviously inspired by werewolves, Frankenstein and Dracula.\n\nEach is quite fun to fight and makes a worthy addition to the Monster Hunter rogue’s list.\n\nLunagaron is a speedy canine who starts out standing on all fours before bulking up and standing on two feet following his transformation. Garangolm is a bruising powerhouse who enlarges his fists via powerful elemental arms when enraged and loves to use high-impact attacks. Malzeno, meanwhile, boasts a flashy moveset that includes an awesome teleport move as well as a new status called Bloodblight that triggers a life-based tug-of-war between the monster and a hunter’s health. It’s basically like a Castlevania boss.\n\nThere’s also a returning cast of old monsters, including some fan favorites who are coming back for the first time in a while. And as with past games, there are secret post-game monsters to unlock at higher Master Rank levels, including up to Level 100.\n\nMonsters, overall, feel more quick and nimble, with even seemingly slow and lumbering ones excelling at tracking you down and being right in your face before you know it. This is likely in response to all the quality-of-life improvements that were introduced in World that made controlling hunters easier, which made dealing with monsters easier overall as well. Hunters are even more quick and nimble in Rise and Sunbreak, thanks to the addition of Wirebug moves.\n\nWhile I loved the new and returning monsters in Sunbreak, however, one issue I have is the monster count. Iceborne, for example, launched with 27 new monsters. In contrast, Sunbreak only has 17 new monsters.\n\nThat’s a huge reduction.\n\nEven the monster unlocks at Master Rank 50, 70 and 100, while being great monsters, also didn’t feel like a big surprise — and I’m not talking about the decision to spoil every monster through trailers even before the game came out. I just didn’t get a sense of, “Oh wow, I didn’t expect that monster,” when I first saw them.\n\nGranted, every monster looks awesome and feels great to fight so the quality is there for sure. It’s just that the quantity issue can’t be ignored, either, since losing 10 new monsters compared to Iceborne is just too big a drop. This becomes especially apparent in the endgame, which feels just a tad bit sparse, particularly after going through the excellent campaign experience.\n\nIceborne had the Guiding Lands, for example, which felt like a proper, new endgame activity, even though it started out a bit too grindy and also split the player base a bit. Even Rise had Rampages, which helped fill out post-game content, but has since disappeared for Master Rank. Admittedly, Rampage mode had its share of issues, especially for solo play. But I thought it was pretty fun when you had at least one extra player with you and that it could’ve been better with just a few tweaks that addressed some of the complaints about it.\n\nInstead, the endgame is now primarily dependent on anomaly quests against tougher, infected monsters, which you will need to hunt in order to fully upgrade your weapons. In a sense, it’s more of a return to classic Monster Hunter — almost like a nod to the old deviant monsters — which is actually what a lot of folks asked for.\n\nI actually think the afflicted monsters are great thanks to the extra challenge that they bring to the table. In addition to being immune to trapping, afflicted monsters also add extra mechanics that shake things up a bit. This includes nerfing the healing efficacy of items like max potions, which suddenly fail to fill up your entire life bar if you happen to be hit with affliction as well. Even minor monsters such as Tobi-Kadachi suddenly become a threat if you’re not careful. My only gripe is that I wish they had their own unique armor set at least. Instead, they only provide afflicted materials for upgrading weapons, which isn’t bad but it also would have been nice to get some armor diversity, especially given how Blademaster and Gunner armor are now the same in terms of looks.\n\nHonestly, though, Sunbreak’s end game is great for folks like me who have limited time and can’t pour in the insane amount of hours required by, say, a Guiding Lands area. Others, however, might feel differently. The absence of some features also makes it feel like stuff was taken out of the game.\n\nSunbreak doesn’t even have a proper siege mission against a large monster like in past games. With the emphasis on castle ruins in the trailers, I thought it would add a new one for sure as they looked like an ideal siege location. Given the positive reaction to the Jungle, one could only imagine how much the community would have reacted if they brought back, say, the classic Jhen Mohran hunt on the sea of sand. Granted, siege missions can be hit or miss and also suffer from the same issue some players have with Rampage quests taking too long. But they’re fun when done right and are part of the Monster Hunter experience.\n\nI have a feeling the pandemic might have something to do with it again. Here’s hoping that the post-game support and free DLC from Capcom is on point and more akin to Iceborne than it was for Rise, which felt a bit lacking.\n\nHow is Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak's gameplay?\n\nWhile the lower monster count at launch is an issue, the other component of Monster Hunter’s one-two punch remains stellar, thankfully. I’m talking about gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay was a big reason why I rated Rise favorably despite its more apparent flaws compared to past games. It’s the reason why I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Sunbreak as well.\n\nSome old-school purists might disagree. But this is as good as the overall gameplay has felt for me in the history of the franchise from a combat standpoint. It’s just that excellent.\n\nYes, there will be debates when it comes to weapon tuning as well as buffs and nerfs to people’s weapons of choice or existing skills. But as far as the base mechanics go, I just absolutely love them. Rise’s mechanics are a big reason why I haven’t gone back to Iceborne, and I consider Iceborne to arguably be the best game in the series after having Monster Hunter 4U hold the top spot in my personal rankings as far as the enjoyment I got during my initial playthrough of a Monster Hunter game for some time. It’s just hard to return to Iceborne’s Great Sword gameplay, for example, after experiencing the improvements for the weapon in Rise. Meanwhile, Sunbreak further builds on the gameplay established by Rise with even more new skills and mechanics.\n\nSpeaking of new additions, I’m a huge fan of the new Follower Quests that let you play with NPC characters. This is arguably the biggest change in the franchise for solo players since player count scaling was introduced by World. I was actually surprised with how competent the AI was as an ally.\n\nThe followers also have different personalities, with some leaning more toward support, while others focus more on attacking. This means you can pick a follower based on your playstyle or needs.\n\nPersonally, my favorite is the healing-averse Luchika equipped with a bowgun. She’s just so good with stickies and her personality is a hoot, too. Plus, as the only one who guns in my group, it feels nice to be able to pair up with another gunner, especially when I’m using a melee weapon. My only complaint is that you can’t bring Followers with you to regular quests. Having to do Follower Quests solo can also be a drag on multiplayer sessions with friends as you have to essentially leave to do your own thing instead of having them be part of the co-op experience.\n\nStill, just having someone like Fiorayne with you for certain story quests is a great feature. It also fixes one of my main gripes about the series. That would be all these strong-looking NPCs who don’t do anything and just leave everything to you when it’s time to fight a dangerous monster or boss. I’m looking at you, Admiral and Seeker from Monster Hunter World. In contrast, Fiorayne carries her own weight and even gets her time to shine via a cool scene during the fight against the last boss. You can be my wingman, or wing woman, anytime Fiorayne.\n\nPalamutes also get extra use thanks to some new abilities. This includes providing extra storage as well as a new “Sniff ‘Em Out” ability that makes it easier to find marked items on the map, whether it be materials or endemic life.\n\nPalicoes, meanwhile, can now have the moves in three of their five skills slots edited, making it easier to have the “perfect Palico.” They also get new secret support skills, including a healing bat, explosive fireworks and lucky “Lottery Box” that can knock down monsters with a mini-Dragonator that’s appropriately called the Kittenator. I slap that thing onto almost every Palico I have.\n\nFor hunters, the ability to have two different loadouts of Switch Skills out in the field is a game-changer as well, not just from a quality-of-life standpoint but also by allowing you to use two different moves that you couldn’t bring together before. This is especially true for certain weapons like Great Sword and Long Sword, which benefit greatly from being able to bring two different loadouts.\n\nSome of the new Switch Skills added to Sunbreak are also quite fun. These include a new Surge combo for Great Sword that trades away the ability to tackle more frequently in exchange for faster strikes and more staggers. The new GS Strongarm stance counter is also a game changer, shoring up one of the holes in the weapon. The skill gives the weapon a true counter instead of just the tanking and guard point moves that it had previously, providing even more options for technical play. It also gives new life to moves like the True Charge Slash, allowing players to hit it more easily than before.\n\nHeavy Bowgun, meanwhile, sees the return of crouching fire, which has great synergy with new Switch Skills that allow you to create a special ring for improving bullet performance as they pass through it. Insect Glaive also gets a nice alternative to the helicopter move via the new Kinsect Slash, which doubles as an attack and essence grabber at the same time. The move just feels extra satisfying when you land it consecutively on a monster’s head and either break parts or cause a topple. Even the seemingly simple decision to reduce the Wirebug requirement for the Lance’s Twin Vine skill actually makes a difference in improving that weapon.\n\nNot all the new moves are groundbreaking, of course, but they help improve Rise’s already great mechanics even more.\n\nAlso, while the game added a bunch of quality-of-life features, there are a few more that would help improve the user experience. My co-worker Cameron Duren, who helped me review the game, has a pet peeve with the skill search function for armor, which I also agree with. Since World, that feature shows results in a non-standard order that can be hard to navigate. It would be much better if it showed results in alphabetical order to help streamline the process or players who like to build mixed armor sets, for example. The search function for decorations could be improved as well to make it easier to find the one you want based on the skill you are looking for.\n\nNew Monster Hunter vs. classic, more grounded Monster Hunter\n\nAdmittedly, Rise’s gameplay — and by extension, Sunbreak’s — has been a bit polarizing for certain pockets of the community.\n\nThis is particularly true for some longtime players who prefer classic Monster Hunter’s more grounded gameplay. In fact, my co-worker had this exact issue with Rise and Sunbreak, which he feels is a bit too freewheeling. It’s a complaint I can certainly understand as someone who took my licks as I went through the pain of mastering the series’ more difficult, classic gameplay, even though I actually happen to like many of the changes that some players are critical about. In fact, I still remember some people in the community complaining about Generation Ultimate’s addition of Hunter Arts and refusing to play the game because of them. And I consider MHGU to be the last classic Monster Hunter entry.\n\nI do feel that when people say Rise and Sunbreak feel easier, it’s probably due to all the things that hunters are now allowed to do and not because the monsters got weaker. It’s the same thing when people were complaining that World felt easier. It’s not that the monsters got easier. If anything, the monsters felt stronger overall. It’s just that the quality-of-life improvements, which are especially noticeable for weapons like bowguns, made fighting the monsters easier, especially when factoring in all the other extra tools you have at your disposal such as being able to heal while moving, for example.\n\nThis is also the case for Sunbreak even though its monsters feel even more aggressive than before to me. Not only does it have mechanics like Blastoads and Sleeptoads from World and Puppet Spiders and Wyvern Riding from Rise, it also has Marionette Spiders that essentially give you a free monster topple. Just the Wirebug wirefall recovery alone makes a huge difference in impacting the difficulty of the game. It’s basically like how offensive weapons of war have outpaced the available defensive options. Military tanks are better than ever today, for example. But opponents also got better tools like MANPADS. Heck, I remember when some people complained about the introduction of mounting in the game’s fourth generation and how it made the game easier. As someone who doesn’t like to use traps as a way to keep monsters in place so I can just wail on them, I can understand where they’re coming from, although I personally love the addition of the mounting mechanic as an Insect Glaive main for Monster Hunter 4 and World.\n\nPersonally, I actually like the Wirebug moves, too. I especially like the extra nimbleness that they give traditionally slow weapons such as Great Sword, which has been my main weapon for Rise, and Heavy Bowgun, which was my main weapon in Tri and Iceborne. It’s not game-breaking but adds enough mobility for you to aggressively stick to a monster constantly or break away in case of emergencies.\n\nI also see it as its own unique thing associated with Rise, just like Hunter Arts were a unique feature for Monster Hunter Generations. Monster Hunter traditionally had two development approaches, with one adopting the more experimental approach seen in games such as Generations and now Rise. I have a feeling the next main line Monster Hunter game for Playstation from the main team wouldn’t be quite as freewheeling as Rise and Sunbreak, so I’m enjoying these games for what they are.\n\nThese are also the times when having the perspective of a longtime fan helps. I remember fans criticizing Tri for not being as good as the second generation of Monster Hunter, which I feel is only valid in terms of monster count as the hitbox improvements from that game alone was a big and welcome change.\n\nI also remember folks criticizing World for not being as good as Generations Ultimate in their mind. Then I saw folks criticizing Rise compared to World. Now I see some players criticizing Sunbreak compared to Iceborne, with some holding up Iceborne as the pinnacle of Monster Hunter after it received its share of criticism before.\n\nAdmittedly, some of the criticisms are quite valid, and I’ve voiced several of my own about Sunbreak in this review. At the same time, there always seems to be a set of players within the community who criticize every new game compared to the one that just came before it. Don’t get me wrong, criticism is fine and actually needed, in my opinion. It’s how you fix issues and make the next game better or even improve the current one via patches.\n\nBut criticisms must also be legitimate. It can’t be criticism just for the sake of criticism, self-validation or even the exclusion of others’ own new experiences. Otherwise, it’s just like how some older folks automatically criticize the younger generation. That’s more for self-affirmation and accomplishes nothing. World definitely brought in a lot more people to the franchise, something that comes with its own list of pros and cons. On one hand, it’s nice to see more mainstream gamers enjoying Monster Hunter and finally getting it. The added support also provides extra reassurance for the future of the franchise. That last part is especially important because it explains the reason behind all the changes that were made for World.\n\nUltimately, Capcom is a business that wants to sell more games. Some players might complain about how those changes “ruined” the franchise. But one thing that is undeniable is that those changes made World a global success, something that the franchise has failed to achieve with its classic formula. Whether they made the game better or not can be debated. But their impact on the longevity of the game is undeniable. And if you look at sales numbers alone, then these are apparently changes that people wanted.\n\nChanges to make the game more accessible and attract a larger audience also mean that a lot of the quirks of past Monster Hunter games that old-school fans consider a right of passage have also gone by the wayside. I still remember how much more skilled you needed to be as a gunner, which was my main weapon at the beginning of my Monster Hunter journey, because of the less player-friendly camera system. Solo speed runs were also much more challenging due to the fact that there was no player scaling for hub quests, which meant solo players had to beat content scaled for multiplayer. That being said, I also don’t want to end up as some Monster Hunter boomer who delegitimizes the experience of newer players. While a larger audience can magnify issues such as toxicity, a lot of new players have also added to the community, which you can see with some of the content creators who came after the release of World.\n\nUltimately, both old and new Monster Hunter are part of the Monster Hunter experience. I just consider myself lucky to be part of that early wave because it made me appreciate the franchise fully and see it grow to what it is today. Yes, it’s sad to lose some of the things that defined the core experience of Monster Hunter. At the same time, I’m also happy to see the franchise thriving today. And if i find myself having a craving for that classic Monster Hunter experience, which happens from time to time, I can always fire up those old games to scratch that itch. That is part of the privilege of being a veteran of the series as it allows me to appreciate both old and new Monster Hunter.\n\nStill, while I am happy with the game overall, however, I do hope that Sunbreak’s update schedule is more fleshed out than Rise’s. It looks like they are at least adding new armor options via anomaly monsters, so I consider that a step in the right direction. I certainly hope that some of the issues or perceived shortcomings of the game also get addressed and Sunbreak gets the same attention that Iceborne did. And by that, I mean attention that’s befitting of a mainline game in the series so Sunbreak doesn’t feel like Iceborne’s red-headed stepchild or a stopgap before the next PlayStation entry.\n\nAlso, please bring back Prowler Mode, Capcom. Pretty please?\n\nFinal thoughts on Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak\n\nMonster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak further builds on the new mechanics introduced by Rise with an assortment of new skills as well as several quality-of-life improvements that further improve the overall Monster Hunter experience. Add the introduction of AI hunting partners — a first in the series — and you have a nice assortment of new things that further move the series forward. The absence of Rampage Mode in Master Rank does make it feel like features have been taken out. The endgame could also be a bit more fleshed out. A great campaign experience combined with excellent combat mechanics, however, makes Sunbreak another worthy addition to the franchise.\n\nRating: 9 out of 10\n\nCost: $39.99 for exapnsion only, $69.99 for Rise and Sunbreak\n\nMore information: Official Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak site"
