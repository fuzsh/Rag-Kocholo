        "text": "Last updated on August 28, 2024\n\nAdeline, Resplendent Cathar | Illustration by Bryan Sola\n\nAggressive decks are a tried-and-true way of winning a game of Magic. Who cares how good your opponents’ cards are if they’re dead before they can use them? These decks are often composed of cheap creatures and burn or pump spells to push damage.\n\nAttack triggers are another way for aggressive decks to apply pressure. They press your advantage by providing extra value in addition to combat damage. Maybe you generate a creature token or two, some Treasure tokens, or another buff. Attack triggers are especially important in Commander, where aggressive decks need to get loads of value to overcome the challenge of defeating three players with 40 life.\n\nLet’s check out the best attack triggers!\n\nWhat Are Attack Triggers in MTG?\n\nGut, True Soul Zealot | Illustration by Wayne Reynolds\n\nAttack triggers are abilities that trigger when one or more creatures are declared as attackers in the “declare attackers” step of the combat phase. There’s a lot of diversity in attack triggers. They’re primarily on permanents. Some creatures have abilities that trigger when they attack or that trigger when many creatures attack.\n\nWhile every color has attack triggers, they’re concentrated in green cards, white cards, and red cards. This list has been weighted towards Commander. Since these abilities naturally encourage aggressive archetypes, I’m giving higher rankings to attack triggers on cheap creatures that play well with that strategy, and I'm looking for attack triggers with high-impact abilities, especially since most creatures need to survive a turn for these abilities to matter.\n\n#36. Hellkite Charger\n\nHellkite Charger is pricy twice over as an expensive creature with an expensive cost to its attack trigger, but it deserves a slot on the list as a reliable combo piece. Cards like Savage Ventmaw (plus a mana dork), Grand Warlord Radha, or a ton of mana dorks convert this into easy infinite extra combats.\n\n#35. Legion Loyalty\n\nThe myriad ability on Legion Loyalty promises to end the game if you have a board state, rather like an enchantment-based Moonshaker Cavalry. It does its best work alongside creatures with powerful ETB triggers like Solitude or creatures with saboteur effects like Professional Face-Breaker.\n\n#34. Alibou, Ancient Witness\n\nIf flooding the board with Constructs, Thopters, and Servos wasn’t enough value for you, Alibou, Ancient Witness kicks it up a notch with a ton of direct pressure and a bit of scrying to make swinging at the opponents worthwhile. It’s pretty niche but provides artifact decks with an effect they need.\n\n#33. Duskana, the Rage Mother\n\nDuskana, the Rage Mother has one of the strongest attack triggers on the list, though it has some stiff deck-building requirements. This Naya commander received a huge boost in Kudo, King Among Bears, which ensures your creatures attack as the largest on the board. A few other great cards to pair with Duskana include Mentor of the Meek and Collector Ouphe.\n\n#32. Galepowder Mage\n\nWhile the most obvious home for Galepowder Mage is a flicker deck, it provides great pressure for aggressive decks exploiting cards like Impact Tremors. You can even use it to remove blockers temporarily—or permanently in conjunction with Containment Priest.\n\n#31. Blossoming Bogbeast\n\nMagic has many variants of Craterhoof Behemoth at home, but I’ve found Blossoming Bogbeast to be one of the strongest. +2/+2 and trample isn’t a buff worth writing home about, but gaining life takes little effort. Throw in some Soul Sisters or Weather the Storm, and your opponents will be sinking in the bog.\n\n#30. Gut, True Soul Zealot\n\nGut, True Soul Zealot requires sacrifice fodder, but you can find plenty, especially in decks that produce Treasure or Blood tokens. A few 4/1s add up quickly, especially if you pair them with anthems or Impact Tremors effects.\n\n#29. Champion of Rhonas\n\nChampion of Rhonas excels as a Sneak Attack variant, especially for decks that won’t or can’t play red. You should pair it with haste enablers to mitigate the chance of this green creature dying before it exerts a creature into play.\n\n#28. Curse of Opulence\n\nCurse of Opulence rewards your aggression with mana and gets heat off your back since two of your opponents are more likely to want the Gold token than to attack you. Enchanting the correct opponent can also help apply pressure if the threat assessment at your table is lacking.\n\n#27. Beastmaster Ascension\n\nBeastmaster Ascension is a classic green enchantment for pumping a wide board of creatures. It can be a touch slow, but getting to seven counters is easier than you think, especially in the token decks where this card excels.\n\n#26. Six\n\nSix promises to be an incredible value engine in self-mill decks. Even if you never get to swing with Wrenn’s old partner, retracing permanent spells provides absurd value. I love the mechanical callback to Wrenn and Six. It shows what elements of the card each entity brought, better expressing the partnership of dryad and treefolk.\n\n#25. Delina, Wild Mage\n\nDelina, Wild Mage doubles down—or better—on creatures with impactful ETBs like Inferno Titan and Etali, Primal Conqueror. I think it’s overshadowed by Rionya, Fire Dancer, but Delina can be an incredible support piece and synergizes with cards like Barbarian Class and Farideh, Devil's Chosen.\n\n#24. Scion of Calamity\n\nScion of Calamity helps keep those pesky artifacts and enchantments under control while applying plenty of pressure across the board thanks to myriad. This dinosaur also works with Elemental Bond effects to draw cards.\n\n#23. Sun Titan\n\nThe Magic 2011 Titans all have hefty attack triggers, with Sun Titan being one of the most impressive. It provides aggressive decks with resilience against board wipes, but it also works incredibly well with creatures like Selfless Spirit and Cathar Commando that sacrifice themselves as part of their powerful effects.\n\n#22. Burakos, Party Leader\n\nBurakos, Party Leader has proven itself one of the best party commanders in the game, being itself a cleric, rogue, warrior, and wizard. Anything with an attack trigger that makes multiple Treasure tokens on attack is quite threatening. Folk Hero might be the best background for this black commander (providing its deck with an Orzhov commander color identity) since almost all your creatures share a creature type with Burakos if built right.\n\n#21. Sludge Titan\n\nIf you’re anything like me, the cards in Clue: Ravnica Edition slipped past your attention, but Sludge Titan deserves all of it. Baseline, the attack trigger draws two cards, one creature and one land. But decks that build around self-mill, with commanders like Muldrotha, the Gravetide or Sidisi, Brood Tyrant, often view milling five cards as equivalent to drawing five cards, making Sludge Titan a uniquely powerful value engine.\n\n#20. Sword of the Animist\n\nSword of the Animist is a staple ramp piece for non-green decks that struggle to ramp on their own. White decks benefit from this legendary artifact; they have relatively weak ramp and plenty of cards that care about equipment for even more value. Bitterthorn, Nissa's Animus (the compleated version of the sword represented in Origins) provides similar value, though I favor the OG’s cheap casting and equip cost.\n\n#19. Andúril, Narsil Reforged\n\nAndúril, Narsil Reforged can close games by buffing your board incredibly well. Ascending takes little effort, especially in go-wide decks that want this effect. You can take this equipment to even greater heights with +1/+1 counter synergies like Shalai and Hallar and Simic Ascendancy.\n\n#18. Caves of Chaos Adventurer\n\nCaves of Chaos Adventurer takes us into one of the most busted Magic locales of recent memory in the Undercity. You don’t even need to complete a dungeon for this card to have an impactful attack trigger. You go up so many cards between taking the initiative and impulse drawing off this, and we can’t forget the cast-from-exile synergies.\n\n#17. Aurelia, the Law Above\n\nWe have many iterations on Firemane Commando’s “draw a card when you attack with two or more creatures” abilities, like Glimmer Lens and Chivalric Alliance. I’d put all of them roughly here, but I like Aurelia, the Law Above the best because it triggers when your opponents attack and can go even higher as a potential win condition.\n\n#16. Aurelia, the Warleader\n\nPower creep has weakened Aurelia, the Warleader, but this Boros ( ) angel still ends games in a wave of righteous fire as you pummel your opponents with an additional combat or two, which happens to work well with many other cards on this list!\n\n#15. Zur the Enchanter\n\nZur the Enchanter has a lot of range. It can certainly play into aggressive strategies by picking up the likes of All That Glitters and Duelist's Heritage, but it's best known as a more controlling stax commander in builds that focus on tutoring up cards like Stony Silence, Rest in Peace, and Rule of Law to prevent your opponents from playing altogether.\n\n#14. Caesar, Legion’s Emperor\n\nCaesar, Legion's Emperor has consistently impressed me most of all the Fallout commanders. It just has a lot of text, all of which is great. I like pairing it with cards like Mondrak, Glory Dominus and Divine Visitation to get the most out of creating two attacking tokens, which I think should be a default mode.\n\n#13. Hellrider\n\nI’ve won many Cube games on the back of Hellrider blasting my opponents for 5 or 6 unexpected direct damage, and this red devil works just as well in EDH. Sometimes even better; token commanders go nuts these days. I bet you could take out a player with Hellrider triggers alone. You can find similar effects in Mishra, Claimed by Gix, Commissar Severina Raine, and Brutal Hordechief.\n\n#12. Sovereign Okinec Ahau\n\nSovereign Okinec Ahau plays well as a support card with commanders like Jetmir, Nexus of Revels or Gahiji, Honored One, or it works in the command zone as a Selesnya commander. This noble cat‘s ability is pure value, easily exploitable since you can effortlessly double the number of +1/+1 counters you distribute, and it comes with a body that’s pretty annoying to remove thanks to the unnecessary addition of ward .\n\n#11. Goldspan Dragon\n\nGoldspan Dragon pressures your opponents on so many levels. You gain a massive mana advantage since it makes 2 mana on attack, plus it doubles the mana of any Treasure you have lying around. A hasty 4/4 flying dragon provides another layer of pressure while you accumulate resources, beating down in the air and keeping planeswalkers well below their ultimate.\n\n#10. Seasoned Dungeoneer\n\nI don’t need to explain why the initiative is utterly busted. Seasoned Dungeoneer is a great card to add the initiative to your decks because the attack trigger ensures you can always get it back, regardless of how many blockers your opponent has. This white creature pairs nicely with monarch cards, too.\n\n#9. Arna Kennerüd, Skycaptain\n\nWas Arna Kennerüd, Skycaptain alright to print in Modern Horizons 3? Prepare to win out of nowhere with this human knight, either as an Esper commander or in the 99. A few of the most potent cards you can copy include Curious Obsession, All That Glitters, and Cranial Plating. A really neat trick is doubling up on shield counters, which gives your creatures twice the protection.\n\n#8. Breena, the Demagogue\n\nBreena, the Demagogue brings a touch of group hug to the aggressive-themed deck. Most players can’t resist the temptation of a free card and knocking an opponent down a few pegs—everybody attacks the player with the most life. And while they do that, you consolidate your power until you turn the tides in a flash, and your opponents regret all the counters they gave you.\n\n#7. Inti, Seneschal of the Sun\n\nInti, Seneschal of the Sun is never the most powerful or flashiest red card in your deck, but it fills so many little roles. You get a discard outlet to get reanimation targets in the graveyard or tuck cards beneath Currency Converter. It’s a source of spells to cast from exile for Prosper, Tome-Bound, throws +1/+1 counters around for the likes of Shalai and Hallar, and filters through excess lands when flooding. Many decks can justify including this great red creature.\n\n#6. Kaalia of the Vast\n\nKaalia of the Vast might be the best way to cheat at Magic without getting thrown out of the LGS: Why choose between a strong dragon commander, a great angel commander, or the best demon commander, when you can play all three of them together?\n\nGetting free angels, demons, and dragons—three creature types renowned for their epic creatures—at least feels like cheating. Some marquee creatures to cheat in include Avacyn, Angel of Hope, Terror of the Peaks, and Bloodthirster.\n\n#5. Combat Celebrant\n\nSneeze and Combat Celebrant goes infinite. Helm of the Host is the classic option, but you can also use Rionya, Fire Dancer or any creature that untaps attacking creatures. Even if you aren’t interested in comboing, this red warrior is a hyper-efficient way for aggressive decks to get an extra combat.\n\n#4. Primeval Titan\n\nPrimeval Titan might be banned in Commander, but I couldn’t resist adding it. You can grab utility lands like Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle or Field of the Dead, assemble Dark Depths combo in a single attack, or get two Forests and win with the sheer mana advantage that comes with putting three lands into play a turn.\n\n#3. Laelia, the Blade Reforged\n\nLaelia, the Blade Reforged draws so many cards, and you can do a neat trick with Laelia's exile payoff and cascade cards—a little rules quirk makes each card you reveal when cascading (or discovering) a unique event, so Laelia gets a counter for each card you go through. If you don’t find an appropriate card until you go 20 deep, Laelia gets 20 counters, and your opponents are suddenly under a lot of pressure.\n\n#2. Uro, Titan of Nature’s Wrath\n\nUro, Titan of Nature's Wrath isn’t as dominant in Commander as in Standard or Modern, but that doesn’t mean it can’t hit hard. The combination of card advantage and ramp quickly puts you ahead of your opponents, and Uro won’t stay down. This works best in decks with lots of cheap spells to keep the graveyard full for paying that escape cost.\n\n#1. Adeline, Resplendent Cathar\n\nAdeline, Resplendent Cathar might look unassuming, but it puts in tons of work in multiplayer games. Decks exploiting attack triggers want to be aggressive, so getting three tokens plus one over-statted legendary creature is incredible. It takes very little to break this white knight. One token doubler, anthem, or Impact Tremors effect sends the damage spiraling out of control. Not to mention all the typal synergies you get from creating three humans a turn.\n\nBest Attack Trigger Payoffs\n\nThe best cards to reward attack triggers are Isshin, Two Heavens as One and Wulfgar of Icewind Dale, two of the best extra-combat commanders. You can also double the triggers with cards like Strionic Resonator or Roaming Throne in the right deck.\n\nStacking additional combats can also get more value from your attack triggers. Cards like Aurelia, the Warleader, Aggravated Assault, and World at War result in tons of additional triggers. If you’re in blue, you can grab extra turn spells like Time Warp.\n\nOne issue with attack triggers is the vulnerability they require. You have to attack, after all, giving your opponent a chance to trade in combat. This is why ways to prevent combat damage can be excellent payoffs. Iroas, God of Victory and Dolmen Gate are the best options. Maze of Ith can do in a pinch since it can rescue a creature from combat after it attacks.\n\nDo Creatures Entering the Battlefield Attacking Trigger Attack Triggers?\n\nNo, they don’t. Attack triggers only trigger after an attacker is declared during the declare attackers step. Creatures that enter the battlefield tapped and attacking aren’t declared as attackers, so they can’t trigger these abilities.\n\nWrap Up\n\nPrimeval Titan | Illustration by Aleksi Briclot\n\nAttack triggers are an excellent way for aggressive decks to get a bunch of value. They can provide the kind of value midrange decks or control decks lean on instants and sorceries for, while getting into the red zone and pressuring your opponents, punishing them for using ramp and card draw that doesn't affect the board.\n\nWhile these are some of the best attack triggers, this category has enough support I’m sure I missed a good one or two. What are your favorite attack triggers? What would you have added to the list? Let me know in the comments below or on the Draftsim Discord!\n\nStay safe and keep attacking!\n\nFollow Draftsim for awesome articles and set updates:"
