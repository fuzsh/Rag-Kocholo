        "text": "Sorry bad english\n\nI buy Fire Emblem Awakening and I played all romantic paths, see all romantic scenes and dialogues. Now I am looking for another Fire Emblem game with romantic elements.\n\nI did a search and google and looks like have only 4 games of fire emblem series with romanceable characters:\n\nFire Emblem Awakening\n\nFire Emblem The Houses\n\nFire Emblem Genealogy of War\n\nFire Emblem Fates\n\nAre those 4 games the only ones or have more ? or maybe exist any of the fan made games of fire emblem with such features ? Someone can list it ?\n\nIf not, someone can recommend for me another games with the same ( or similar ) relationship/romance system like exist in Fire Emblem Awakening ? I really loved so much Fire Emblem Awakening and I really need to play more games like this.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nEdited December 27, 2019 by fhc\n\nFates has romance that is extremely similar to Awakening, but there are other games that touch on romance, it just depends on how similar to Awakening you want it. Unfortunately I know very little about hacked games, so I cannot make any suggestion for those.\n\nThere are a lot of other games that have romance that can grow throughout the game, but they don't marry until the game's ending, and there are a fairly small number of these paired endings. In these it is a smaller element to the game, and it should be noted these games are all came out before a Player Avatar became common place:\n\nFire Emblem: The Binding Blade\n\nFire Emblem 7 (released as simply Fire Emblem in the west, and Fire Emblem: The Blazing Sword in Japan)\n\nFire Emblem: The Sacred Stones\n\nFire Emblem: Radiant Dawn (although it feels the most tacked on in this game)\n\nThe only ones where the characters will marry and have children that become playable characters are:\n\nFire Emblem: Awakening\n\nFire Emblem: Fates (sometimes this game is referred to by the paths in the game, so Fire Emblem: Conquest, Fire Emblem: Birthright, and Fire Emblem: Revelation)\n\nFire Emblem Genealogy of the Holy War\n\nNow if having a Player Avatar that can romance other characters is what you are looking for these are the games with that:\n\nFire Emblem: Awakening\n\nFire Emblem: Fates\n\nFire Emblem: Three Houses\n\nI hope this helped.\n\nThank you very much, Eltosian Kadath.\n\nI tried to google the verb \"tacked on\" but I not find the meaning of it, at least not explained in a way that I can understand it, I am Brazilian, my English is bad, and I not find it in any Portuguese/English dictionary. what this word means ? This means that have very few of this content in the game ?\n\nEdited December 27, 2019 by fhc"
