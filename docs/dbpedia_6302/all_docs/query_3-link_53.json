        "text": "What are the best Lords of the Fallen weapons? Sure, grinding vigor to gain levels in any Soulslike is one surefire way of getting stronger, but you’re only as good as the gear you wield. That’s where finding the best swords, hammers, axes, bows, and catalysts can help you overcome the odds, no matter how stacked against you they are.\n\nSome of the Lords of the Fallen classes will give you decent weapons that will keep you going in the RPG game for a fair bit of time. However, eventually, you’ll need some better gear to take down some of the more difficult Lords of the Fallen bosses you need to beat. So if you like the sound of the game, learn more via our Lords of the Fallen review, no matter if you prefer to use a sword and board combo, to sling spells like there’s no tomorrow, or to fire a volley of arrows from afar, here are the best Lords of the Fallen weapons we’ve found so far.\n\nWhat is the best Lords of the Fallen weapon?\n\nHere are the best Lords of the Fallen weapons to use:\n\nHallowed Praise\n\nBloodlust\n\nKukajin’s Sword\n\nPutrid Child Sword\n\nCrimson Rector Sword\n\nPieta’s Sword\n\nCharm of Fortune’s Sight\n\nBow of the Convert\n\nOur experience with Lords of the Fallen will likely differ from yours, but in terms of a melee-based build, we certainly recommend mixing it with spells that augment your blade with different elements. The Poison Weapon Umbral spell, for example, will tip your blades with poison elements in addition to any it already has. While you can only coat your weapon with one element from spells or items, innate bonuses will stack.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some essential Lords of the Fallen weapons you can find on your journey across the realm of Mournstead.\n\nHallowed Praise\n\nInside Pilgrim’s Perch, from the Vestige, walk the plank and defeat the enemies on the other side. Cross into the Umbral and climb the ladder that appears. Leap across to the swinging platform, then jump to the platform further away. Defeating the enemies here will give you this sword, and honestly, it’s one of the better early-game melee-build weapons. Requiring only 12 Agility points to wield properly, this combines physical damage that increases with every upgrade, as well as a set amount of holy damage. What really makes this weapon good is the reasonably high bleed stat, making it more likely that sustained hits will inflict the bleed status on your foes.\n\nBloodlust\n\nAfter defeating the optional boss Crimson Rector Percival, you can find this sword inside a chest, and it’s well-worth seeking out. It’s got relatively low requirements, too, only needing Agility and Inferno stats at 13 each. Its physical damage potential is quite good at its base level, but it additionally inflicts the same amount of fire damage. On top of that, you get a rating of 60 in both bleed and burn status ailments, meaning you cover many bases whenever you hit an enemy with this weapon. These have the potential to do even more damage, and when combined with the Poison Weapon spell and several upgrades to increase its raw damage, this sword can make short work of even the toughest foes.\n\nKukajin’s Sword\n\nYou can only get this sword if you either complete her questline by freeing her from her petrified state and then paying vigor bounties at Skyridge Bridge for help during boss fights or kill her before she leaves Mournstead. Upon receiving her sword, you’ll have a weapon that rivals the Bloodlust in terms of being the best weapon in the game. This sword has a steady 60 buildup for both bleed and poison, meaning that you’ll inflict tons of damage if you hit enemies continuously. Dual-wielding this with Bloodlust makes for a great offensive build if you’re okay with dodging more than you parry.\n\nPutrid Child Sword\n\nFor something a little different, you can pick up the Putrid Child Sword as a drop from enemies in the Fief of the Chill Curse. It requires eight points in Strength and 14 points in both Radiance and Inferno, which is a significant investment. Once you do, though, you get both physical and wither-based damage that scales with each upgrade. In addition to this, you’ll inflict the frostbite status ailment if you hit enemies enough times in quick succession, which not many enemies late-game have resistance to.\n\nCrimson Rector Sword\n\nIf you’re going for a pure strength build, then the Crimson Rector Sword will serve you well in the early game. It does require 19 Strength to wield effectively, but its raw power surpasses a lot of similar weapons found by this point in the game. It is a no-thrills weapon, so you won’t be doing anything more than just raw damage unless you enchant it, but sometimes that’s all you need to create some of the best Lords of the Fallen builds. An alternative to this is the Thorned Crimson Rector Sword, which is very similar in nature. However, it also inflicts 60 bleed points at the cost of some raw attack power and is slightly heavier to wield.\n\nPieta’s Sword\n\nBy using the Remembrance of Pieta and trading Umbral Scourges to Molhu in the Skyrest hub area, you’ll have access to one of the best pure-Radiance type weapons in the game. It does cost a whopping 25 Radiance to wield but gives you a Smite status ailment score of 100. On top of that, it’s relatively lightweight, and it does have scaleable holy damage. If you went with the Orian Preacher as your starting class, this is an essential weapon for your build. Just make sure you have a backup for those that resist the holy type.\n\nCharm of Fortune’s Sight\n\nOkay, so firstly, this isn’t a weapon, but it is a catalyst, which is essential for casting magic. The main reason that we like this is that it requires only 12 for both Radiance and Inferno and yet it allows you to cast up to four different types of spells with increased spellpower damage. It’s also easily accessible, bought from Molhu for 650 vigor in the Skyrest, making it a great way for non-magic builds to pivot should they need that extra elemental boost.\n\nBow of the Convert\n\nThe Bow of the Convert is on a body lying on a rooftop in the Calreth Slums, close to the pyromancer and archer near the giant gate. You need to go through this area to progress to one of the Lords of the Fallen beacons, so if you cross to the other side after finding the non-boss pyromancer, you’ve gone too far.\n\nOn the face of it, the additional base damage stats compared to the rest of the bows and crossbows are a bit lacking. However, the thing that makes it stand out, besides its 16 Agility requirement, is just how many status ailments each arrow you fire can potentially inflict. Arrows are given the power to inflict 60 stacks of bleed, burn, and poison with every hit, so if you use Radiant Arrows with them, you’ll get another 80 stacks in the bleed ailment and the high physical and holy damage that arrow type offers.\n\nHow to upgrade Lords of the Fallen weapons\n\nAs you descend Pilgrim’s Perch, in the area where you can ride an elevator back to the Vestige, there are several dog enemies and a knight. Kill them all and loot the area to find the prison cell key. Head for the giant cell in this area and talk to the woman there. Give her the cell key, and she’ll soon make her way to Skyrest, where she can upgrade your weapons."
