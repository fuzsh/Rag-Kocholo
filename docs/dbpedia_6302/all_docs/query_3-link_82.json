Cool spell effects. Weird art (but great battle maps). Fan-fic tier writing.\n\nFull Review:\n\nFell Seal: Arbiter's Mark is Final Fantasy Tactics reincarnated. It's not enough to say that it's an homage or \"of the same genre.\" It's identical to the original Final Fantasy Tactics in more ways than those words do justice to. The layout feels the same, the maps feel the same, the class system feels the same, the attacks feel the same, etc. There are some key differences, however. Most of those are evolutions of FFT's systems or aesthetic differences.\n\nThe mechanics are good. Items restock at the end of every battle, for one thing. Status effects seem to work better and can be implemented by ranged weapons via class skills, making some class archetypes that were weak in FFT feel strong in Fell Seal. One notable class skill is the humble tackle, which becomes far more useful and fun in Fell Seal, as it frequently does more damage than a base attack, depending on how it interacts with the map or even other characters. The classic cross-shape formation from FFT has a weakness now, in that it opens you up to free, heightened multi-target damage. The push effect is also guaranteed, meaning positioning on elevated terrain is far more important to consider.\n\nOne of the biggest flaws in Fell Seal so far is the Deviant Art level character writing and styling. Some of the scenarios and dialogue play out like they're lifted wholesale from a fan-fiction, and the expressions in the portraits are jarring, as the portraits themselves are very western in style and seem to be styled after paintings from the Baroque or Pre-Raphaelite movement, but the characters emote through alternate portraits which take that same Baroque style and apply anime expressions to it. The neutral portraits are good, but these anime-expression versions are not.\n\nThe backgrounds, on the other hand, are beautiful. They're hand-drawn and look better than FFT's maps (and I always liked FFT's maps). If there's one thing about this game's art that's really notable, it's the battlegrounds. The colors pop and their are lots of interesting little touches, and since the primacy of the game is fighting on these dressed-up grids, this is a big green flag for the game. You'll be spending a lot of time looking at the maps, so it's good that they're the best visuals the game has to offer.\n\nThe spell effects are also a highlight, and one of the elements of Fell Seal that surpasses FFT. Water I gives you icicles that stab your foes. When you get Water II, though, Instead of just slightly bigger icicles, you see ice swords that stab the target. Other spells have similarly interesting and thematically-appropriate effects.\n\nThe music is nice, but it hasn't really stood out to me so far. FFT's soundtrack is legendary. I'm only 12 hours into the game at this point, so maybe there are better tracks awaiting me.\n\nI didn't like the main characters at first, but they're growing on me. You can still recruit generic characters like in FFT, and I have my team composed of 3 or 4 of those with 2 or 3 story characters most of the time. You can also change their appearances, outfits, and names at any time through the guild shops. This level of customization is a welcome addition. The portraits for generic characters are blander than FFT's, but the game also supports custom portraits, which is a nice perk.\n\nIf you liked Final Fantasy Tactics for the gameplay, Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark is excellent. If you liked it for the aesthetic, it mostly misses the mark, but is not without some merits. If you liked it for both, I think you'll come out ahead with this game.\n\nPosted 1 December, 2020.\n\nWas this review helpful? Yes No Funny Award\n\n10.2 hrs on record (9.7 hrs at review time)\n\nSlain's younger brother is the better game in every way. While I like Slain, I found Valfaris to be a huge upgrade in both gameplay and presentation. The level design is more interesting, the backgrounds are amazing, the character is cooler, and the metal soundtrack is at least equal, if not better than Slain's.\n\nShooting: Valfaris introduces ranged weapons, and they completely change the tempo of the game. The gun options all feel very different and each one is useful in some way. Different players are sure to gravitate toward different weapons. One or two seem to stand out to me as obviously best, but I've read opinions from others that differed from my own, so there's clearly room for different playstyles here.\n\nMelee: Slain might take the edge over Valfaris on this category in terms of technical execution, but the more mobile melee attacks in Valfaris are satisfying in their own right and fit the faster speed of the game well. Melee attacks also replenish your energy for the big guns, so they're a good fit into the gameplay loop.\n\nPlatforming: This is where Valfaris stands head and shoulders over Slain. There's a hanging mechanic reminiscent of Contra that allows for a lot of unique and interesting platforming sequences. There's also climbing (which, for perhaps the first time in memory, is actually better than spamming jump against the climbable surface). Both of these new movement mechanics are used in some boss fights to good effect.\n\nAtmosphere: Valfaris is dripping with 'tude. The dialogue is still campy, but it's less clumsy than Slain's, and there are some bits where Therion's lines break through from cheesy to genuinely cool. The general brutality and mayhem is on par with Slain's, or maybe even greater, and molded to fit the sci-fantasy style to great success.\n\nValfaris is probably my favorite game this year.\n\nPosted 29 November, 2020.\n\nWas this review helpful?

All of the weapons have unique functions and only one of them is hit-scan. Enemies have no hitscan, so you can dodge everything in the game, meaning defense is active and fun. You don't have to sit behind cover waiting for your turn to shoot.\n\nThe default weapon, the axe, is one of the best melee weapons in any fps. It does real damage--it can one-shot many of the lesser enemies--and it has a small vortex ability to pull in nearby enemies. It's not overpowered, though. I still used my ranged weapons more often, overall, but I cherished every opportunity to carve through a horde of charging melee mooks.\n\nThere's not a lot of advanced movement tech. It has rocket jumping, and unless I'm missing something, that's it. The rocket jumps are pretty fun, though, and you can skip parts of levels, if that's your thing. I always have fun sequence-breaking, so this was a plus for me.\n\nThe level design is flat-out amazing. It has great vertical design, spaces that open up as you proceed, and a good mix of big, open spaces, narrow corridors, and all kinds of other environment types. Some of the levels are so novel and interesting that they will steal your focus from the enemies.\n\nAmid Evil is very worth your time.\n\nPosted 27 September, 2020.\n\nWas this review helpful?

Yes, it's hard, but nothing in the game is going to cheat you out of a win. It gives you every tool to deal with every situation. There's definitely some pattern-learning involved, but that's the sort of game this is.\n\nThe variety of weapons is nice. It feels like every weapon has a niche, even if you'll probably end up settling on the same pair for most runs. I used charge and spread for almost every mission, but I've read opinions from others who think chaser is best, or roundabout. The fact that there's not a standout winner means that they're all pretty useful and viable.\n\nIf there's one thing that seems like a no-brainer, it's the smoke bomb charm. The only time I didn't use it was in the airplane levels, where it doesn't work. Any other level, I found it to be indispensable. Some might find the hearts worthwhile, though. The single heart only lowers your damage by 5% and the double heart by 10%, so it's entirely doable. But for me, invincibility frames were too good to pass up.\n\nUltimately, if you like sidescrolling platformers and shooters, this game is super fun and worth your time. Provided you have patience.\n\nPosted 31 August, 2020.\n\nWas this review helpful? Yes No Funny Award"
