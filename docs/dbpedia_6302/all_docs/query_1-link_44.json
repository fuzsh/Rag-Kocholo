        "text": "The knives and swords Keaton Goddard forges in his basement blacksmithing studio have the appearance of something out of “Mad Max.” His back yard is a pile of old bicycle parts, scrap wood and leaf springs from trucks he finds in a rusting pile at Barrett’s Garage.\n\nThe knives strike a balance between functional and ornamental. The swords are decked with recycled truck parts, spark-plug spikes, aluminum knuckles and bike-wheel cassettes.\n\n“As a baseline, I want to make something badass,” Goddard said. “What’s the most ridiculous thing I can make?”\n\nOn Wednesday, July 22, at 9 p.m. he will be featured as a contestant on History's debut episode of the “Forged in Fire” show. In the show, four blacksmiths compete to make swords, axes and knives in a limited time for a panel of judges. Goddard, 25, called it “Chopped” for sword-makers.\n\nWhat started as a hobby Goddard could do with his father’s tools after school turned into full-time blacksmithing when he left a sales job at a metal-working company called Techtronic Industries two years ago.\n\nInstead of selling metal parts, he would salvage scrap for free, and forge, sand and polish them into post-apocalyptic swords. He started making Spartan swords and Japanese-style tanto swords in black marble cases.\n\nHe made a Bowie knife inspired by the video game “Call of Duty,” a medieval sword inspired by “The Legend of Zelda,” and a glowing red Japanese-style katana that looks more like a light saber in “Star Wars” than something you would ever see in battle.\n\nThe idea was to turn junk into something both useful and decorative.\n\n“I’ve always been into ‘Lord of the Rings’ and medieval movies and video games in my childhood,” Goddard said. “But the reason I got into this was because it’s more unique. Other people are making cars or repairing bikes, but from a business perspective, this is more unique.”\n\nHe started recording videos of himself forging, sanding and polishing the swords. His YouTube channel, called Faraway Forge, blew up in January, when a video he made while crafting a katana blade from a rusty leaf spring had 13 million views on YouTube. It cost him nothing to make.\n\n“I’ve always been good with my hands and enjoy working with my hands,” he said. “I decided to try it and it went off from there. It started out as a hobby and just went crazy.”\n\nIt’s become more time-consuming than a full-time job. A knife takes about four or five hours to make. A sword can take up to 80 hours, from salvaging the used metal, to forging and sanding the blade, to filming and editing a video for his YouTube channel.\n\nSome time about two years ago, the blades he was making became more and more unique. One of them is a paring knife inside a chef’s knife inside a larger chef’s knife. One is a Bowie knife with knuckles for a grip. One is a tanto knife with a deer antler for a handle.\n\nOn the tube\n\nWhat: Nantucket blacksmith Keaton Goddard competes to made swords and knives on “Forged in Fire”\n\nWhen: First episode is at 9 p.m. Wednesday, July 22\n\nWhere: History TV"
