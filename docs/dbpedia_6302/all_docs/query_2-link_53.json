        "text": "Giant’s Flame\n\n· Red-orange in color\n\n· Wielded by the Fire Giant, Fire Monks, and Fire Prelates\n\n· Also known as the flame of ruin. This nickname is never capitalized in game.\n\n· Does not inflict a status effect\n\n· Borrowed from the power of a fell god (Burn O Flame)\n\n· Sometimes glimpsed within the faith, the punishment for which is banishment under the Golden Order (Catch Flame)\n\n· Capable of burning the Erdtree and prophesied to one day do so (Surge, O Flame, Fire’s Deadly Sin)\n\n· Thus, it is anathema to the Erdtree (Anathema: something or someone that one vehemently dislikes OR a formal curse by a pope or a council of the Church, excommunicating a person or denouncing a doctrine.) [Catch Flame]\n\n· Beguiles those who look upon it. Thus, those who guard it also worship it (Flame Sling)\n\n· Firemonks were appointed to watch over it following its sealing and some have succumbed to it’s allure (Surge, O Flame, Fire Monk Ashes)\n\nFIRE, POWER, DEATH\n\nPretty much every single one of these is associated with death in some way. Arguably only Bloodflame is not.\n\nBut we can squeeze Bloodflame in by associating fire with power, as well. Mohgwyn’s Sacred Spear tells us that the Formless Mother “bestows power upon accursed blood,” and this must mean the flame is the power, as that is what is added to the blood upon communing with her.\n\nScouring Black Flame associates the Blackflame’s ability to kill gods as its ‘power’ as well. Indeed, the ability of near every one of these flames can be described as powerful. Some fire even has the power to put others to sleep.\n\nAnd of course Giant’s Flame beguiles those who look up on it, implying that it has an almost bewitching effect. Though this effect seems to be born of a reverent fear and respect rather than some sort of actual bewitching spell, this still makes flame powerful — its overwhelming power and ability able to conjure up an entranced like state.\n\nIt seems that fire, thematically, is also a representation of death. It’s tied deeply to action, to cause, to effect.\n\nIt causes death, it calls forth death, it is born of death, it kills death, it prophesies death, it imitates death. It’s almost a manifestation of the different aspects of death — phases, stages or abilities of death. The two are one in the same.\n\nFIRE AND THE GOLDEN ORDER\n\nNone of the different flames we have discussed have any place within the Golden Order.\n\n· Giant’s Flame is anathema to the Golden Order because it’s prophesied to one day burn it’s symbol down\n\n· Frenzied Flame opposes the Golden Order because it opposes literally everything\n\n· Ghostflame isn’t necessary to burn death if Death has been plucked from the Elden Ring. Additionally, Ghostflame may be sourced from an Outer God (Twinbird Kite Shield), who would run contradictory to the Greater Will. Additionally again, the Ghostflame Torch description almost seems to imply using Ghostflame gets you banished or sealed underground\n\n· Bloodflame exists seemingly from an Outer God who wouldn’t fit within the Golden Order for obvious reasons.\n\n· Accursed Flame literally seems to have been caused by the Golden Order and their banishment of the Omen.\n\n· Blight Flame seems to have developed from death itself and thus has no place in the Golden Order\n\n· Destined Death’s sealing is what created the Golden Order\n\n· Slumber Flame is — look can we act like this one doesn’t exist? It basically doesn’t exist.\n\n· Similarly as we know, death has no place in the Golden Order, either.\n\nPOSTMORTEM EDIT: I’m adding the below wayyy after submitting the original post for completion’s sake and my own peace of mind. If you’re reading this, thank you so much for checking out my work even though it was posted a while back! I appreciate you. Feel free to leave a comment below!\n\nPlacidusax and the Blade of Calling’s “flames” were both pointed out to me in the comments when this post initially went up and I kind of wrote it off, but after playing through the game 1.5 more times, I think it deserves a spot here.\n\nGolden Flame\n\n· I’ve also x4 made this one up since we don’t have a name for it\n\n· Golden-yellow in color\n\n· Wielded by Elden Beast, Melina, Placidusax and found on the Blade of Calling and the Sentry’s Torch\n\n· Deals holy damage and does not inflict a status effect\n\n· This is flame touched by the power/influence of the Greater Will and/or Golden Order\n\nWe see in the game that things associated with the Greater Will are of the color gold — the Elden Beast and the Erdtree being the first examples. Worship of both sprung up the ‘religion’ known as the Golden Order.\n\nTherefore, I think we can logically understand each wielder under the ‘wielded by’ bullet point above.\n\nPlacidusax was Elden Lord in his age and the Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone description tells us that his stone scales were gold. As for the Sentry’s Torch (the item that cemented all this for me and reminded me to come back here and update this), it does not deal fire damage, it deals holy damage, which indicated to me that it is a standard torch imbued with the power/influence of the Greater Will/Golden Order.\n\nWhy am I typing all of this? Because -\n\nGolden Flame shouldn’t exist based on my above extrapolations regarding death and flame’s exclusions from the Golden Order. But some of these depictions we see in game might not really be flame — it might be golden energy, per say — similar to that energy we see used on the Golden Order Greatsword and Sacred Relic Sword’s weapon skills. Those skills do not depict flame, yet radiate a golden energy.\n\nI think Golden Flame is either that — a golden energy taking the form of flame — or its Normal Flame imbued with the Greater Will’s golden influence — like Placidusax’s breath and the Sentry Torch."
