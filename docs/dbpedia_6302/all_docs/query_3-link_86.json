        "text": "I am debating whether I feel like dipping into another season of Diablo 4 today, but Season of the Infernal Hordes does bring one great thing with it. Rather, 15 brand new Unique items to hunt, and as such, tons of new builds.\n\nWhile there are a lot of patch notes for this season, here are all the new Uniques that are hitting today, and lots of them do sound pretty amazing. The list begins. Skipping the stats, just showing off the powers to streamline things a bit:\n\nALL CLASSES\n\nCrown of Lucion – Helm: Each time you use a Skill with a Resource Cost, gain [5-15]%[x] increased damage and Resource Cost is increased by 30%[+] for 4 seconds, stacking up to 5 times.\n\nEndurant Faith – Gloves: When you would be damaged for at least 40% of your Maximum Life at once, it is instead distributed over the next 2 seconds and reduced by [10-30]%[x].\n\nShard of Verathiel - 1 Handed Sword: Basic Skills deal [50-200]%[x] increased damage but additionally cost 25 Primary Resource.\n\nRakanoth's Wake – Boots: When you cast a Skill with a Cooldown, you explode, dealing X Fire damage.\n\nLocran's Talisman – Amulet: Your skills gain [0.10-0.40]%[+] Critical Strike Chance bonus per point of Primary Resource you have, up to [10-40]%[+]. Each point of Primary Resource above 100 grants 0.2%[x] Critical Strike Damage instead.\n\nBARBARIAN\n\nUnbroken Chain – Amulet: Casting Steel Grasp reduces Iron Malestrom’s Cooldown by [3.3-10.0] seconds. . Enemies damaged by Iron Maelstrom deal [10-30]% less damage for 6 seconds (Barbarian Only.\n\nThe Third Blade - 1 Handed Sword: Your Weapon Mastery Skills are now also Core Skills that have no Cooldowns but cost Fury, dealing [50-70]% of normal damage. Their Fury costs are reduced by 5 for any additional Charges the Skill would have had.\n\nDRUID\n\nThe Basilisk – Staff: When you first hit an enemy when an Earth Skill, Petrify them for 3 seconds. Petrifying an enemy additionally deals [4412-26472] Physical Damage.\n\nMjolnic Ryng: While Cataclysm is active, you gain unlimited Spirit and deal [X] [40-100]% increased damage.\n\nNECROMANCER\n\nThe Mortacrux – Dagger: When consuming a Corpse, there is a [10-30]% chance to also create a decaying Skeletal Simulacrum that seeks enemies but cannot attack. When it dies, it explodes for 5,514 Shadow damage. This effect is treated as a Macabre Skills.\n\nPath of Trag’oul: Bone Prison traps a larger area and fires [10-30] Bone Splinters at enemies trapped within. Increase your Maximum Essence by 2 for 10 seconds each time these Bone Splinters hit an enemy. (Necromancer Only\n\nROGUE\n\nThe Umbracrux – Dagger: Your Subterfuge Skills create an attackable Shade Totem for [3-8] seconds. Any damage it takes is replicated onto surrounding enemies at 20% effectiveness. You may only have 1 Shade Totem active at a time. This damage counts as a Trap Skill.\n\nShroud of Khanduras: Casting Dark Shroud makes you Immune for 2 seconds but your Evade Cooldown is increased by [9.0-3.0] seconds. Evading while Dark Shroud is active leaves behind an explosion that deals [3,426-10,278] Shadow Damage and Pulls In enemies. (Rogue Only)\n\nSORCERER\n\nAxial Conduit: Chain Lightning alternates between orbiting you and seeking up to 3 enemies. When it returns, it drains 6 Mana from you for each active Chain Lightning. After draining 66 total Mana, the bolt explodes for [1,887-7,548] Lightning Damage. Chain Lightning expires if you don’t have enough Mana for it to drain (sorcerer Only).\n\nVox Omnium - Unique Staff: Casting a Core Skill additional fires 2 instances of Fire Bolt, Frost Bolt, or Spark, matching the elements of your last 2 non-Core Skill cats. These projectiles deal [30-90]%[x] increased damage.\n\nWhich of these will emerge as meta? There are also new Aspects on top of this which will play into things, but I’ll assemble those in a separate post. For now, these are the actual new items you should be hunting. I wonder if they bring any new transmog as well?\n\nFollow me on Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram.\n\nPick up my sci-fi novels the Herokiller series and The Earthborn Trilogy.\n\nForbes Community Guidelines\n\nOur community is about connecting people through open and thoughtful conversations.
