Opening its doors for the first time on Aug. 14 to 18, the Theatre, built from salvaged materials and supported by countless hours of volunteer labour embodies the heart and soul of the Spafford family’s story.\n\nThe journey to rebuild began after the barn caught fire in 2000, a loss that, while devastating, sparked a new chapter for the Spaffords.\n\n“It was probably lights from heat lamps for chickens. That’s what probably lit it up,” Spafford said. “In retrospect, looking back at it, it kind of worked out. It brought a lot of friends together. I have no regrets when it comes to that.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe rebuild, spanning 24 years, was a labor of love involving friends and family, who salvaged materials from 10 different buildings. The result is a theatre that seats 95, with seats reclaimed from the Kingston Grand Theatre.\n\nOver the years, the barn on the Spafford property has been used as a venue for weddings, art shows, and concerts. The idea to transform the barn into a theatre was inspired by Spafford’s daughters, both artists with a background in theatre, who saw the potential for the space to become a dedicated venue for the performing arts.\n\n“My daughters are all artists and went to Queen’s for theatre, so that’s a nice plus. They’re sort of taking the reins. I know a little bit about barns, but I don’t know too much about theatre. So, my daughter Shea is really putting it together and the whole family has come together to be in the play.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut the theatre’s inaugural production isn’t just any play—it’s one written by Spafford himself.\n\nAlthough Spafford has no formal background in writing, he poured his passion and personal experiences into “The Nobleman.” Inspired by his childhood memories of Noble Trousdale and his family’s general store, the play is a tribute to the spirit of small-town life.\n\n“The community and the stories they told about Trousdale and stuff like that, it all just kind of came together. It just kind of wrote itself,” said Spafford. “People are telling you a story about something and that fit with another story, and they all just came together.”\n\nSet in the 1970s at Trousdale’s General Store, it captures the essence of community through humor and heartfelt moments. “No matter what obscure household or hardware item was needed, Trousdale knew what it was and, if it wasn’t in stock, where to find it,” Spafford said.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“The Trousdale’s are a great family, nice people who’ve been in the business for six generations. They just have a moral outlook on things that we’re lacking today,” Spafford added. “Noble Trousdale always had a quick line, and he was always very friendly. His father owned the store before him, so they’ve been in the business for a long time. Just a good bunch of people.”\n\nAdding a special touch to the production, Noble Trousdale’s grandson, Matthew, is portraying his father, John, in the play—bridging the past and present in a meaningful way.\n\nWhile Trousdale never swung a hammer, he was instrumental in the rebuilding of Spafford’s barn. His guidance and resourcefulness helped shape the reconstruction. Unfortunately, Trousdale, along with many of Spafford’s friends who aided in the rebuild, will never see the barn in its completed form. Their influence, however, is deeply felt in every corner of the Stone Blade Theatre.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Sometimes you get to a job where you have to have the community. The great thing about it is when you got to that point where you needed them, they were there. There were some wonderful people that unfortunately, that’s my only regret of the whole situation, quite a few friends aren’t going to be here for this opening,” said Spafford. “That’s tough.”\n\nThe opening of Stone Blade Theatre on Aug. 14 represents more than just the culmination of years of hard work, it’s a living tribute to the people and community that made the project possible. For the Spafford family, it’s not just a theatre — it’s a testament to enduring friendships, family bonds, and the power of community.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories\n\nNews Near Kingston"
