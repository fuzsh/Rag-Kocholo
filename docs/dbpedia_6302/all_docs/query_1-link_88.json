The park is located at 889 Kinglet Court in Brighton.\n\nGoats from Frederick-based Goat Bros last visited Brighton in October 2023.\n\n“My husband Jordan and I started our grazing business in November 2022. Our herd of 300 goats travels around the front range, providing holistic land management for municipalities and private landowners,” said Director of Operations Toni Sarazen for Goat Bros Hoof Action Grazing.\n\n“We’d love to bring awareness to land management alternatives available with goats and the importance of fire mitigation,” said Sarazen."
