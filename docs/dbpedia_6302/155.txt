The fire blade is a recurring Sword in the Dragon Quest series. It is a powerful weapon that can unleash flames on the enemy when used as an item in battle, and often deals blistering bonus damage as well.

Characteristics[edit]

The fire blade is a red European-style sword with a wavy red blade shaped like a flame. The hilt, handle, and edge of the blade are gold, and the blade has a blue and gold crystal in the center. In some illustrations, the handle is purple, while the hilt and pommel are light blue. Despite being the penultimate sword in the first game of the series, the fire blade has only made a handful of appearances in other games in the series.
