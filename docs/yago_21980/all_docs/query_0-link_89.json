        "text": "Title: UNITED KINGDOM / ITALY: KENNETH BRANAGH'S LATEST FILM, 'IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER', OPENS IN LONDON\n\nSummary: LONDON, ENGLAND, UNITED KINGDOM (RECENT) (RTV) (CONTAINS FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY) VARIOUS OF CELEBRITIES ARRIVING AT PREMIERE/ ACTOR MICKEY ROURKE\n\nEmbargoed: 14th December 1995 12:00\n\nKeywords:\n\nLocation: LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM/VENICE, ITALY\n\nCity:\n\nCountry: EUROPE England United Kingdom Italy\n\nReuters ID: LVADAY7HJ4ACKF882HROZ8F2AZ2H\n\nStory Text: It's been a difficult year for British actor-director Kenneth Branagh, with a box-office flop and a failed relationship.\n\nBut there are signs his new film \"In the Bleak Midwinter\" could lift the curse that has dogged him for the past 12 months.\n\nCelebrities packed the London premiere of the black-and-white film, which promises to be different from the start.\n\nThe story is close to the heart of all actors (not least the Shakespearian Branagh) as a troupe of unemployed, untalented actors try to stage \"Hamlet\" in an empty church.\n\nThe cast includes Richard Briers, Jennifer Saunders, John Sessions and Joan Collins.\n\nBranagh admits it was a low budget production and \"everyone was on the same money from the clapper loader to Joan Collins\".\n\nBranagh wrote and directed the movie but does not himself appear though Michael Maloney - the moving spirit, the rising star, the Hamlet - looks remarkable like an alter ego.\n\nAfter the dismal box office failure of his feature \"Frankenstein\" and his split with long-time companion Emma Thompson, Branagh decided it was time to regroup. He said, \"I wanted to make something that made people laugh, I wanted to do it quickly, I wanted to do it with people I knew\".\n\nA lavish premiere party hosted by fashion designers Aquascutum attracted various cast members, including Joan Collins.\n\nOther guests included actor Mickey Rourke, former 70's cult model Twiggy and former Rolling Stones band member Bill Wyman. All seemed to agree that Branagh had been successful in his more subdued return to the silver screen.\n\nCopyright Holder: REUTERS\n\nCopyright Notice: (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2011.
