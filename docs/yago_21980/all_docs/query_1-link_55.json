        "text": "Dear Friends of Shakespeare in Delaware Park,\n\nWhat an incredible season it’s been! Whether it was rain or shine (and let’s be honest, there was a lot of rain!), your unwavering support turned our 49th season into a spectacular success. Thanks to you, we brought the magic of The Winter’s Tale, the hilarity of The Comedy of Errors, and the adventure of A Midsummer Night’s Tour to life—free and open for all to enjoy. We couldn’t have done it without YOU!\n\nNow, we’re already counting down the days to our 50th milestone celebration next year. We can’t wait to create even more unforgettable memories with you! Be sure to follow us on Facebook and Instagram to stay in the loop on all the exciting SDP news, including our Holiday fundraiser, “Shakespeare, Santa, and Dickens Walk into a Dinner Theatre,” on Monday, December 2nd at Desiderio’s, and the return of the Fabulous Feast on March 15th, 2025 at Rich’s Atrium. Our “Beware the Ides of March” theme promises to be the greatest toga party in Buffalo!\n\nWe’ll see you back on the hill next summer for our 50th anniversary productions of Twelfth Night and Richard III."
