        "text": "There is a Christmas feel-good movie that is already several decades old. It was directed by Kenneth Branagh, a prestigious actor and director who has made both popular movies and adaptations of famous literary works, including several Shakespeare plays. It stars Joan Collins and a cast of actors well known to anyone who watched British television in the 1980s and 1990s. It is also a mostly-forgotten movie now.\n\nWhy is this? The most obvious explanation for why movies are neglected is because they are not very good. However In the Bleak Midwinter (given the less gloomy title of A Midwinter’s Tale for American audiences) is actually very funny and heartfelt. It is one of my favourite Christmas movies, and yet most people that I have met are unfamiliar with it.\n\nThere are a number of reasons for this. Branagh made In the Bleak Midwinter just three years after he had made Peter’s Friends, a similar story about theatrical loveys coming together at Christmas time, and experiencing angst, torment and the comforting bliss of friendship. If many think that Peter’s Friends was too sentimental or that its characters were far too lovey, then what are they to make of In the Bleak Midwinter, where the lovey factor was increased to the power of ten?\n\nThe word ‘lovey’ fallen out of use now, but was applied to people who were overly affectionate in a melodramatic way when they were with their friends. It often applied to actors, and was associated with a kind of falseness. This derogatory application was often applied to Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson at the time when they were a couple.\n\nStill Peter’s Friends boasted the star names of Branagh and Thompson in acting roles, alongside popular TV comic actors such as Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Imelda Staunton and Rita Rudner. By contrast, In the Bleak Midwinter was a cast of lesser-known loveys. Branagh did not act in the film, but stayed behind the camera directing, the first of his films in which he was not a cast member.\n\nJoan Collins was the biggest star, but she is hardly an actress renowned for making good movies. Beyond that, British audiences could single out Richard Briers, John Sessions, Jennifer Saunders and Julia Sawalha, but none of these are names of international renown.\n\nThere is also the subject matter of In the Bleak Midwinter. Many of the most successful Christmas movies deal in either fantasy or family stories. This is a film about a troupe of troubled actors staging a production of Hamlet at Christmas, hardly the most appealing subject for a wider audience. Throw in Branagh’s trademark habit of filming his movies as if they are stage plays (putting the camera too far back from the action), and this can make the film seem poorly-adapted for watching on a small screen.\n\nStill perhaps this is what Branagh wanted. Just as the production of Hamlet (in the film) is a labour of love for the lead actor and stage manager Joe Harper (Michael Maloney), then so In the Bleak Midwinter is Branagh making a film that he wanted to make, rather than worrying too much about commercial success. Of course both Joe and Branagh wanted their productions to sell too, but that was not their main reason for making them. If they were after vulgar sales, they could easily have chosen a more populist subject matter.\n\nThe main theme of In the Bleak Midwinter is summed up by the Noel Coward song that is played throughout the film, ‘Why Must the Show Go On?’ Like Coward’s song, Branagh’s film is a funny and self-deprecating look at the “god-awful business of acting”, and asking what it is that drives theatre actors to keep going when the work is so stressful and the returns diminishing. It might be said that Branagh’s film is designed to answer that question.\n\nThe movie is filmed in black-and-white to give it an old-fashioned atmosphere, and perhaps to reflect the mood of the characters at the beginning of the film. They are indeed having a bleak midwinter. None more so than the movie’s hero. Joe Harper is an unemployed actor who is dealing with feelings of depression:\n\nI’ve been an actor now for eleven years. If everything had gone according to Laurence Olivier’s book, I’d have known triumph, disappointment, and married a beautiful woman. Instead, I’ve known tedium, humiliation and shacked up with a psycho from hell.\n\nJoe does have a chance of a big acting role if the cards fall out his way. However it would be a role in a tawdry blockbuster. That would establish his career, but it is not the kind of role that he craves. He is supported by his cheerful and glamorous manager, Margaretta D’Arcy (Joan Collins), who naturally thinks that he should take the starring role.\n\nWhile he considers, Margaretta agrees to help him to put on a production of Hamlet in his home town of Hope. Whether the name of the town is a good omen or not is unclear at this point. Joe is hoping to support his sister Molly (Hetta Charnley), who works as a teacher there, and save a local church from closure by showing the town has a vibrant art scene.\n\nMargaretta is sceptical about Joe’s plans: “All you’re going to get at this time of year is eccentrics, misfits and nutters,” she warns him. She is right in this. The cast that Joe gathers together all have hang-ups and personal problems equal to Joe’s alone, and it seems that they need a successful Shakespeare play to restore their own confidence just as much as he does.\n\nThere is Terry Du Bois (John Sessions), a fast-talking gay actor more used to performing in pantomime. Needless to say, he is flamboyantly camp and given to making sexual innuendos. He rises a little above the stereotype by having a personal sorrow of his own – a son who rejected him due to his career and lifestyle.\n\nAt the opposite extreme is Henry Wakefield (Richard Briers), an ageing actor who seems grumpy and homophobic, but who turns out be more good-hearted than he first appears. Henry is initially disdainful of Terry, and especially displeased to learn that Terry is playing Queen Gertrude. However the two men eventually bond over a shared love of old-fashioned acting styles, especially that of Henry Irving.\n\nTom Newman (Nicholas Farrell) is a melodramatic and vain actor, egotistical and pretentious but also very sensitive. Carnforth Greville (Gerard Horan) is the troupe’s drunk, a man whose self-esteem has been eroded by the disappointment of his mother. Family disappointment seems to be a theme, and this is true for Nina Raymond (Julia Sawalha), a short-sighted, accident-prone young widow who is being discouraged from an acting career by her father.\n\nRounding off the crew are Vernon Spatch, a thespian trying to escape his history as a child actor, and the most versatile member of the team, and Fadge (Celia Imrie), an eccentric new-age set designer whose nipples are prone to harden when the production is going right. Molly is the only member of the team who is not from an acting background. She is a cheerful teacher who supports her brother despite occasionally feeling exasperated with him. “Great! Hello kids, do stop watching Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and come and see a 400-year-old play about a depressed aristocrat,” she complains.\n\nMuch of the movie follows the time-honoured clichés of films about actors putting on a production. There are the comically awful auditions in which the wheat is separated from the chaff. There are teething problems about the location of the play and the money available for it. Margaretta is available on the phone to offer warm words of support and little else.\n\nThere are the constant arguments among the catty actors, who eventually will pull together and perform well. There is a good deal of hammy theatrics that have to be ironed out before the final rehearsal. These are captured in a series of short scenes where the film cross-cuts between the various antics of the actors.\n\nOne or two serious crises threaten to stop the entire production. On the first occasion, the actors club together to pay to keep the play going. On the second occasion, Joe is asked to choose between staying in the production and seeking fame by flying off to America for his new role. The difficulties facing a well-meaning thespian are made clear. “We’re actors – we’re beggars,” admits the sympathetic Henry. Nina takes the opposite view: “It’s not about fame or wealth. It’s about nourishing your soul,” she begs him.\n\nGiven that Branagh has himself appeared in a superhero movie, it may be surprising (perhaps not very surprising) to see that he comes down on the side of nourishing one’s soul. In the end, theatre – even amateur drama with low production values – is more important than money or winning personal acclaim.\n\nIt is not that Branagh is oblivious to the absurdities or faults of theatre. His film concedes that it is a grim and thankless task performed before a dwindling audience. Theatres and church close all the time because there is no more demand for them, Joe acknowledges.\n\nBranagh also has some fun mocking the pretentiousness of actors and stage directors. Discussing the setting of the play, Joe says, “I don’t think it should be Elizabethan. That would be ridiculous.” (If only Branagh had recognised the absurdity and redundancy of many modern-dress productions in his own Shakespeare adaptations). During the auditions, Tom outlines his views on Hamlet:\n\nHamlet isn’t just Hamlet. Oh no, no, no. Oh, no. Hamlet is me. Hamlet is Bosnia. Hamlet is this desk. Hamlet is the air. Hamlet is my grandmother. Hamlet is everything you ever thought about sex, about geology…In a very loose sense, of course.\n\nAllowing for some exaggeration, this is what Branagh himself believes, and his film asserts the continuing relevance of performing Shakespeare plays on stage. In different ways, the entire crew are suffering from a depression equal to that of Hamlet, and the play brings home the issues to them.\n\nOn two occasions, an actor breaks down when a scene touches on a personal problem they are having. Hamlet is often quoted to reflect the mood of an actor at a particular time. It is more than just a piece of entertainment. It is a work that touches the lives of people centuries later, and this is a tradition that Branagh would like to see preserved on stage.\n\nThe production of Hamlet is about more than the play though. It is about the sense of comradeship and unity that goes with making a production. In the Bleak Midwinter might be described as a buddy movie, though unlike many buddy movies, the friends together are not all members of one sex.\n\nThere are buddy movies about female friends, in which males (lovers or husbands) are viewed negatively. There are buddy movies about male friends, who often view the women in their lives with latent hostility. Branagh’s movie combines men and women, but otherwise observes the same rules.\n\nThe production company act as a surrogate family to one another, a point that is made more than once in the film. By contrast people outside the group of friends are a threat to their harmony and unity. The invaders are cynical moviemakers wishing to steal the actors for a big film, or they are family members who disapprove of the actors for wasting their career in theatre. “Families, you know” Terry muses; “They don’t work, do they?”\n\nDespite their differences, this self-made theatrical family does work however. When Joe breaks down and asks what the point of living is, several cast members begin to list the things that make their own lives worthwhile.\n\nAt the end, the story draws to a happy and sentimental conclusion, but it is not a final resolution of all their problems. They will leave the town of Hope and return to their problems, but in the glory of success and comradeship, this crew of misfits and outcasts have briefly found comfort and warmth together, and this is something to celebrate. No wonder In the Bleak Midwinter is one of the best Christmas movies ever made."
