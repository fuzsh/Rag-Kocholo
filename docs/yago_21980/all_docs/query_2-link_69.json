        "text": "Interview by Perrin Smith, Video by Paige Mathieson, Photos by Meg Aki\n\nCrafting a career in any field requires lifetimes of effort and insurmountable dedication. It’s why Kenneth Branagh’s achievements across acting, directing and writing are so difficult to ignore. This Saturday, Branagh crossed the red-carpet at the 24th annual SCAD Savannah Film Festival and spoke to District before accepting his Lifetime Achievement in Acting and Directing Award.\n\nBranagh’s latest film, “Belfast,” is described as semi-autobiographical. It’s set in Branagh’s hometown of Belfast, and centers around a young Irish boy’s childhood during “The Troubles,” pulling from much of his own, true experiences growing up at the same time.\n\nFor “Belfast,” Branagh once again flexed his ability to work in multiple fields and served as the film’s director and writer. On the carpet, Branagh offered advice to upcoming filmmakers and SCAD students, particularly those that are interested in working in multiple fields.\n\n“Follow your nose for what you think is good work,” he said. ‘‘You are your own best asset.’’"
