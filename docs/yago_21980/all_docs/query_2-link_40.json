Although a new name to American film audiences, Branagh had been a force on the British stage for several years, making his name with the Royal Shakespeare Company before forming his own troupe. In the years since Henry V made him a box-office commodity, Branagh has brought more bardish drama to the silver screen—his productions of Much Ado about Nothing, Othello, and Hamlet have created new generations of Shakespeare afficionados—while also broadening his oeuvre by directing, producing, and appearing in such diverse films as the mystery thriller Dead Again and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Roles in such mainstream fare as The Gingerbread Man and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets have also come Branagh's way, making his return to the London stage in 2003 after an absence of a decade something for many theatregoers to celebrate.\n\nWhile some critics view Branagh as a heir to Sir Laurence Olivier's theatrical legacy due to his virile performances and his success in making Shakespeare viable fodder for film, he has also taken his share of critical knocks, but has come back fighting. His character might best be defined by a comment he made to fellow actor Laurence Fishburne while filming Othello. Fishburne, as quoted by Mark Huismaninan Advocate interview with Branagh, was worrying about a particular speech that he could not master, wondering if he should just cut it. Branagh, by way of encouragement, turned to him and said, \"'Look man, I'm a pug Irish kid from Belfast, and I'm not supposed to do this stuff either.'\" The recipient of numerous awards, in 2000 this \"pug Irish kid from Belfast\" became the youngest actor to receive the coveted Gielgud Award for his service to Shakespeare. As Alastair Macaulay wrote in the Financial Times more than two decades into the actor's career, Branagh is \"a winningly direct stage performer, remarkably unaffected, capable of high energy or simple stillness or, in speech, dazzling speed. In ensemble, he responds beautifully to other players, and galvanizes them by his absorption. And his timing is terrific.\"\n\nBelfast Beginnings\n\nBranagh is well trained at doing things from which his background is supposed to disqualify him. Born in Belfast in 1960, he was raised in a lower-middle-class family with grandparents on both sides having worked on the docks. Branagh's father was a joiner and all-round handy man before the family left violence-riven Ulster in 1969 for Reading, England, forty miles from London. According to Billington, the move was \"traumatic and troubling\" for Branagh, who was an outcast at school due to his Irish accent. \"Then your accent changes,\" Branagh told Billington, \"and you feel guilty about this, as if you were betraying your roots.\" In early adolescence, Branagh, a bit of a social outsider, found solace in books and movies. A set of theater magazines introduced him to the great tradition of the stage in England, especially of Olivier's National Theater. Soon he found a place in school by participating in rugby and soccer, becoming captain of both, \"more, I suspect, for my innate sense of drama—I loved shouting theatrically [tough-guy] . . . encouragement to 'my lads'—than for any real sporting skill,\" Branagh wrote in his autobiography, Beginning.\n\nIncreasingly, however, he found his real passion lay with the theater and movies. As a young boy he was deeply impressed by The Birdman of Alcatraz: \"No one appeared to be acting,\" Branagh noted in Beginning. The first play he saw was a production of A Christmas Carol, and it was \"magic\" for him, as he recalled in his autobiography. At Reading, he began taking parts in school plays and even wrote a short play for a festival. He was fifteen when he first hitchhiked to Stratford, pitching his tent and attending as many of the plays of the Royal Shakespeare Company as he could. He was particularly impressed by Derek Jacobi's performance in Hamlet. By the age of sixteen, Branagh was set on a career in acting, much to the dismay of his parents. Ironically, however, Branagh was in part inspired to acting by his parents, for he grew up in an oral tradition where \"crack\" or good conversation was a primary means of entertainment. \"They had a natural sense of pace,\" Branagh told Smith in New York magazine. \"When to pause, little rhetorical flourishes. They were fireside actors.\"\n\nThough his school work suffered because of his interest in theater, in 1978 Branagh won an audition to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Impressed with his technical control, the Academy accepted him, and Branagh won a scholarship from his local county council to help with tuition. At the Royal Academy Branagh lost his amateur habits of presenting a role and instead let the part play him. He proved an adept student. \"We knew straightaway that Ken was first division,\" fellow actor John Sessions told Howell in Vogue. Branagh had early contact with some of his idols: in 1981 he wrote to Sir Laurence Olivier asking for tips on how to play Chekhov's Three Sisters—\"Have a bash at it and hope for the best,\" was Olivier's reply, as Branagh recounted in Beginning. Also, Sir John Gielgud, then Academy president, was impressed by a Branagh rehearsal for Hamlet, a role the fledgling actor subsequently performed for the royal family.\n\nEarly Successes\n\nThe year 1981 proved to be a turning point for Branagh: not only did he win a major role in a British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) production set in Belfast, but he also landed a part in the play Another Country and became the recipient of the Royal Academy's Bancroft Gold Medal for outstanding student of the year. With the airing of the BBC play Too Late to Talk to Billy, Branagh's parents finally realized that their son was indeed an actor. Other roles followed: the lead in Francis, a play about St. Francis of Assisi, and a one-man show, The Madness, based on Tennyson's poem Maud. Then came a Society of West End Theaters Award for best newcomer for his role in Another Country, and Branagh was on his way. The Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) cast him in the title role of Henry V, \"the most auspicious Stratford debut since Richard Burton's,\" according to Billington in Interview. Preparing for that role, Branagh had an audience with Prince Charles in order to get the feel of royalty for his part. The interview went well, and Prince Charles became an important patron for Branagh.\n\nIncreasingly, however, Branagh felt disillusioned with his position with the RSC. His play Tell Me Honestly deals in part with these frustrations, but he had larger things in mind: starting his own company. His dream was to recreate the old spirit of an actors' theater with its camaraderie intact, one that could take Shakespeare back to its roots. A fellow actor who had performed with him in Another Country, David Parfitt, was also interested in the concept. While funding was an obstacle, Branagh put himself into the marketplace, acting in movies, including High Season and A Month in the Country, and in television productions, including an adaptation of the novel Fortunes of War, during the production of which he met his future wife, actress Emma Thompson. From such work he was able to save $60,000, and with a little help from friends such as Prince Charles and Derek Jacobi, Branagh launched the Renaissance Theater Company (RTC). The company's first play, Public Enemy, about a Northern Irish youngster who is fixated on Jimmy Cagney, not only starred Branagh but was written by him as well. With the second production, Twelfth Night, the company came into its own, and Shakespeare productions directed by Jacobi and Judi Dench, as well as a production of John Osborne's Look Back in Anger, soon made the RTC a respected company not only in London but also in the United States when they toured there.\n\nWhile Branagh worked as an innovative actor, administrator, director, and front man for the RTC, he still found time for other projects, including his long-held dream of filming Henry V. Renaissance Films was created to produce the film and Branagh personally helped to raise the money for filming. Assembling a cast of renowned actors including Paul Scofield, Jacobi, and Thompson, Branagh produced a film that was praised by critics and was popular at the box office. The film received special praise for its vivid recreation of the 1415 battle of Agincourt in which a vastly outnumbered English army under Henry V defeated the French, making Henry the leading king in Europe. Hal Hinson, writing in the Washington Post, noted both Branagh's \"brash and flamboyant\" acting style and \"forthright and articulate\" directing skills, and concluded that Branagh \"has made a Henry V for his time, and a masterful one.\" Peter Travers, reviewing Henry V for Rolling Stone, noted that the \"film is more than a promising first try: It's thrilling.\" Writing in the New York Times, Nicholas Wade compared Branagh's film interpretation of Shakespeare's play with Olivier's 1944 version and concluded that Branagh has created a \"peerless rendition.\" Stanley Kauffmann, writing in the New Republic, also drew comparisons between Branagh and Olivier, concluding that while Branagh \"is not yet near Olivier as a classical actor . . . director, as artistic entrepreneur, as sheer charge of filmworld energy, he has won his own Agincourt.\"\n\nAlthough Henry V put Branagh on the celebrity map, it was not all an easy ride to fame. \"My real 'God, what am I doing?' happened four or five days before shooting,\" Branagh told Michael Billington in Interview magazine. Unsure of what was expected of him in his directorial debut, Branagh called for a test and met the crew for the first time, \"shaking with fear,\" as he told Billington. As both actor and director, Branagh had a stand-in to set up his shots as Henry, and this man was seated upon the throne for one of the major speeches of the play. All was ready for the test filming, yet the crew just stood there. \"I was looking round and felt things weren't happening as they should and that people were starting to look at me. Then the assistant director whispered in my ear, 'You've got to say \"Action,\"' and I realized I'd made the classic . . . gaffe on day one.\" The final validation of his efforts to take the bard to the masses came when he was shopping on Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive shortly after Hamlet's release. A salesperson initially ignored him to deal with a television celebrity, Branagh related to Howell in Vogue, but when the clerk finally took a look at Branagh, he threw up his hands: \"'Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I know you, don't I? You're famous, aren't you? You're the one who played Henry VIII!'\"\n\nBranagh has never been one to stop and savor success for long; even during the filming of Henry V he was busy late at night writing his autobiography, Beginning, in order to help finance new quarters for the RTC. Richard Christiansen, reviewing the memoir for the Chicago Tribune, commented that \"perhaps because he is so close in time to all the events he describes, Branagh's book has an immediacy not always present in autobiographies.\" Christiansen went on to describe passages of the book as \"quite moving.\" Meanwhile, Branagh was busy creating his own history. He and Thompson were married in the fall of 1989, a storybook wedding costing upwards of $50,000, fireworks and all.\n\nBranagh's next film project was Dead Again, a tip of the hat to mystery films of the 1940s. The film focuses on Mike Church, a modern-day Los Angeles detective who assists a beautiful amnesia victim who is tormented by nightmares. An antiques dealer helps to convince Church that the source of the nightmares is another person's life experience: the murder of a famous pianist by her composer husband in 1948. Branagh directed the movie and played the dual roles of the detective and composer, while Thompson played dual female roles and Jacobi took the part of the antiques dealer. Kenneth Turan in the Los Angeles Times called the result a \"giddy whirling dervish of a movie,\" and Vincent Canby in the New York Times dubbed Dead Again a \"big, convoluted, entertainingly dizzy romantic mystery melodrama.\" While filming Dead Again, Branagh was also directing the RTC company in performances in Los Angeles; while he became known for this sort of artistic juggling act, it was to take its toll.\n\nThe 1992 film Peter's Friends, reminiscent of The Big Chill, was lighter fare for Branagh: a group of college chums, gathered at the newly inherited country house of classmate Peter, take stock of the intervening years. Described as \"sunny and superficial\" by Janet Maslin in the New York Times, the Branagh-directed film strikes a grave note when it is revealed Peter has been diagnosed with AIDS. Terrence Rafferty, however, reviewing the movie in the New Yorker, found little to like in it: \"You cower in your seat,\" Rafferty wrote, \"steeling yourself against the next grisly bit of repartee\" in a film inhabited by \"arrogant, self-absorbed poseurs.\" Despite Rafferty's reaction, Peter's Friends was a box-office success and established Branagh's credentials in Hollywood.\n\nBack to Shakespeare\n\nBranagh returned to celluloid Shakespeare with his much-praised adaptation of Much Ado about Nothing, a play about love and the battle between the sexes set against a backdrop of misunderstandings, mistaken identities, and pithy dialogue. Caryn James, reviewing the film adaptation for the New York Times, noted that Branagh's \"is a glorious version of Shakespeare, and it works not because it is Shakespearean but because it is cinematic.\" \"Branagh's production is handsome, brainy, purposefully bustling, securely paced, [and] well-attuned to Shakespeare's unblinkered view of humanity,\" enthused Commonweal contributor Richard Alleva. Dave Kehr, in the Chicago Tribune, described the movie as \"sunny and brightly performed\" despite the fact that almost half the original dialogue was removed in the adaptation. Kenneth Turan, writing in the Los Angeles Times, called Branagh's adaptation a \"rollicking version,\" but his opinion was not shared universally by critics. Hal Hinson, appraising Much Ado about Nothing for the Washington Post, maintained that Branagh does not connect with his material as he did in Henry V, and adding that the actor/director demonstrates \"how, in the wrong hands, even Shakespeare can be trivialized and reduced to chatter.\" Hinson concluded that \"we had every reason to expect more from Branagh than Shakespeare dumbed down for the masses.\"\n\nBranagh's first resounding critical flop was Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, which he not only directed but also starred in as Victor Frankenstein, creator of the legendary monster. The big-budget film sported a star-packed cast, but many reviewers agreed with Janet Maslin in the New York Times that Branagh was \"in over his head\" with the material. \"He displays neither the technical finesse to handle a big, visually ambitious film nor the insight to develop a stirring new version of the story,\" Maslin noted. James Wolcott, writing in the New Yorker, added a further sour note, dubbing Mary Shelley's Frankenstein a \"frantic, incoherent, pointless mess.\" Though the film did earn back the money invested in it, the critical reception stung Branagh. \"I made the film exactly as I wanted and that makes it worse,\" Branagh told Laurie Werner in a Chicago Tribune interview. \"Because you realize that you've put your heart and soul into something that in the end most people thought wasn't very good.\"\n\nIn the midst of the disappointment following Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, the Branagh-Thompson marriage began to flounder, and ultimately ended in divorce in 1997. The strains of two separate careers finally were too much. \"The end of a marriage is just incredibly sad—deeply, deeply sad,\" Branagh told Werner. Thompson continued with her film career, turning in acclaimed and award-winning performances in the films Remains of the Day and Howard's End, and also assuming behind-the scenes responsibilities.\n\nLike his ex-wife, Branagh also did not allow personal setbacks stall his career. Taking a hiatus from directing, he performed the role of the villain Iago in the 1995 movie version of Othello, where his \"terrific skill as a popularizer is a boon,\" according to Janet Maslin in a New York Times review. Maslin also commented that Branagh has the \"rare ability to deliver Shakespearean dialogue as if it were street talk.\" Meanwhile Branagh was also writing and directing A Midwinter's Tale, a comedy about a bumbling theater company trying to mount a production of Hamlet in a small village over the Christmas holidays. \"My original intent was to make a film about an actor at that moment of crisis where he questions what he's doing and why,\" Branagh told Terry Lawson in a Detroit Free Press interview. Shot in black and white, the movie was something of an antidote to the big-production fanfare of previous films. Although New Yorker contributor James Wolcott felt that Branagh's attempt at Woody Allen failed—\"the characterizations . . . aren't fresh,\" he noted—Lawson found A Midwinter's Tale to be a \"warm\" comedy. The film won a gold medal at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nHamlet, Prince of Denmark\n\nBranagh's next project was perhaps his most ambitious: a full-length film version of Hamlet with a cast including Branagh in the title role alongside Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie, Gerard Depardieu, Kate Winslet, John Gielgud, Jack Lemmon, Billy Crystal, and Robin Williams. The $18 million, four-hour-long film, described by Time's Richard Corliss as \"big and pretty, vigorous, thoughtful,\" was a labor of love for its director, who has performed the role of Hamlet some three hundred times onstage. The play is set in a Hapbsburgian nineteenth century, where militaristic flourishes are everywhere, although classical allusions and a level of intrigue reminiscent of sixteenth-century court life imbue Hamlet with a mythic quality.\n\nCalling the uncut Hamlet \"a jungle of a play,\" Commonweal contributor Alleva wrote that Branagh's \"magificent, foolhardy movie\" retains all the Bard's \"narrative detours, playful elaborations, obscure allusions, blatant and subtle jokes, topical gossip.\" To balance the resulting \"tedium\" experienced by the modern viewer, the actor/director has \"turned the Dane into a bit of a speed freak.\" Although Alleva found some problems with this approach, on the whole he ranked Branagh's Hamlet as \"the most jawdropping\" film adaptation of any of Shakespeare's works, with Prince Hamlet resonating a compelling character who is \"mettlesome, high-pitched nature [is] sent zig-zagging out of control by the fury coursing within him.\" In Entertainment Weekly Mike D'Angelo agreed, noting that while Branagh's production is \"wildly inconsistent\" and \"marred by miscalculations so drastic that you'll sometimes find yourself questioning the director's sanity along with the Dane's . . . . There are twice as many moments of startling power.\" Although Hamlet did not fare well enough at the box office to recoup its costs, it did return Branagh's efforts in a slew of awards and the fact that the name Shakespeare was once again bandied about in the media.\n\nFrom his by-the-book Hamlet, Branagh's next flirtation with the Bard was more playful. In 1999 he filmed Love's Labour's Lost as a lushly costumed musical studded with songs by Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, and Irving Berlin, and casting the talents of Alicia Silverston, Nathan Lane, Matthew Lillard, and Alessandro Nivolo. \"It's hard not to admire the missionary zeal with which Branagh approaches his muse,\" quipped Dallas Morning News reporter Chris Vognar reviewing the film, noting that the actor/director \"knows the Shakespearean tradition of taking risks with the material.\" Taking risks, as usual for Branagh, translated into mixed reviews: while some critics praised the spirit of the film, others, such as Time contributor Richard Corliss, were less charitable. \"It's time to wonder what happened to the Great Hope of the British Theatre,\" Corliss bemoaned, dismissing Love's Labour's Lost as \"Shakespeare done by the Fame kids.\" \"So excited is the filmmaker to exhibit all his bright notions and riffs and homages to Shakespeare and musicals and classic Hollywood . . . that each player ends up performing a different play,\" added Lisa Schwarzbaum in Entertainment Weekly. In contrast, Quadrant reviewer Neil McDonald maintained that the allsinging, all-dancing approach \"all works splendidly,\" and that Branagh's decision to set the play in the days leading up to the outbreak of World War II prevents the serious denouement from jarring audiences.\n\nTeaming with Woody Allen Ends on Thin Ice\n\nShakespearean productions continued to be offset by more modern fare, as Branagh balanced Hamlet with a performance as a semi-sleazy Savannah lawyer in the Robert Altman-directed Gingerbread Man and as the lead neurotic in Woody Allen's 1998 film, Celebrity. While some bemoaned the fact that he was \"going Hollywood\"—particularly after Branagh turned up in the roundly panned, big-budget Wild Wild West opposite Will Smith and Kevin Kline—Lesley O'Toole offered relief by observing in the London Times that the actor/director's intention was to broaden \"his appeal to American audiences\" in order to \"facilitate that all-important financing of the less overtly commercial projects he really wants to make.\"\n\nThe 1990s proved to be a difficult decade for Branagh; several outstanding performances and his risky but rewarding production of Hamlet were balanced by several bad acting choices, his divorce from Thompson, and a failed five-year relationship with actress Helena Bonham Carter. However, the resilience that fueled his early career was still there, and would recharge his personal life a few years later when he met the woman who would become his second wife on a film set. Remarking on his 2001 return to West End theatre as a director of the comedy The Play Wot I Wrote, Jay Rayner noted in the London Observer: \"Branagh has turned his back on the Machiavellian power games of Hollywood, which clearly intoxicated him for much of the Nineties, and returned to first principles. It has served him well.\"\n\nIn 2002 the actor found himself in Greenland and Iceland during the filming of the miniseries Shackleton for Channel 4 television and the Arts & Entertainment cable network. Praised by Hollywood Reporter reviewer Ray Richmond as \"One of the greatest projects ever mounted by A & E,\" the production follows the efforts of British explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton to cross Antarctica and reach the South Pole in 1914. Aboard his ship the Endurance were twenty-seven men and sixty-nine sled dogs when the expedition set sail in October of 1914; ten months later, prevented by ice and sub-zero temperatures from accomplishing their goal, the expedition was rescued with no men lost. While noting the excellence of the production, Richmond nontheless maintained that Shackleton \"is Branagh's movie. He is a controlled, captivating, charismatic force of nature in . . . a film that leaves us feeling an unapologetic measure of awe.\" At year's end Branagh had garnered two well-deserved British Academy award nominations for best actor: one for Shackleton and one for his chilling, Emmy-winning performance as Nazi SS Officer Reinhard Heydrick in the 2001 HBO/BBC film Conspiracy, which is about the secret conference held outside Berlin in 1942, wherein the methodical extermination of European Jews that would later be known as the Holocaust was planned out in minute detail.\n\nOther roles found Branagh wearing a variety of more modern hats, as he continued to take on commercially viable projects in order to fund those closer to his heart. He impressed audiences in his role as Gilderoy Lockhart in the 2003 film Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, and also captured critical acclaim for his role in Michael Kalesniko's 2002 film, How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog. Playing a once-cutting edge playwright who is now fighting his wife's efforts to have a baby while undergoing a mid-life crisis, Branagh \"grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit,\" according to Entertainment Weekly contributor Owen Gleiberman in a review of Kalesniko's film.\n\nA Long-awaited Return to Stage\n\nIn 2002 Branagh returned to both Shakespeare and the stage when he accepted the plum role of Richard III in a production at Sheffield, England's Crucible Theatre. The sold-out show, which marked the actor's first time on stage since playing Hamlet for a 1992 RSC production, drew patrons from as far away as Japan and the United States, all of whom crowded into a small theatre known for hosting snooker tournaments. Branagh's decision to return to theatre was inspired by a talk with the Crucible's up-and-coming artistic directer, Michael Grandage, as well as by witnessing a Grandage-directed performance by fellow stage and screen actor Joseph Fiennes in Marlowe's Edward II the year before. Enthused by the youthful Grandage's vision, as well as by the young audiences Fiennes was able to attract, Branagh saw the role of Shakespeare's most beloved villain as yet another way to bring Shakespeare to new audiences.\n\nIf you enjoy the works of Kenneth Branagh\n\nIf you enjoy the works of Kenneth Branagh, you might want to check out the following films:\n\nMel Gibson in Hamlet, 1991.\n\nAnthony Hopkins in Titus, 2000.\n\nIan McKellen in Richard III, 2000.\n\nLaurence Olivier in Richard III, 1956.\n\nFollowing their two-year relationship, Branagh wed art director Lindsay Brunnock in the spring of 2003, and wags claimed that the marriage marked a sea change in his outlook. Whatever the cause, entering his mid-forties Branagh indeed seemed to be coming full circle in a career that promised much in its maturity. In the early summer of 2003 he took to the boards of London's National Theatre as the title character of David Mamet's Edmond, where his bravura performance impressed critics. As Ray Bennett noted in a Hollywood Reporter review, Branagh \"bites into the prose and spits it out as poetry with his extraordinary ability to utter every phrase and fragment as if they were fresh born and not from a writer's page. Onstage . . . Branagh is fearless.\" Still, he seemed wont to let go of his hold on Hollywood audiences; in the news during the spring of 2004 was the report that he would join Tom Cruise and Matrix star Carrie-Ann Moss in the third of Cruise's Mission: Impossible films. With plans for several more screen adaptations of Shakespearean dramas up his sleeve, Branagh will likely continue the creative balancing act that has propelled his career thus far.\n\nBiographical and Critical Sources\n\nBOOKS\n\nBernard, Jami, First Films, Citadel Press (New York, NY), 1993.\n\nBranagh, Kenneth, Beginning, Norton (New York, NY), 1990.\n\nContemporary Theater, Film, and Television, Volume 9, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1992, pp. 46-47.\n\nCrowl, Samuel, Shakespeare at the Cineplex: The Kenneth Branagh Era, Ohio University Press (Athens, OH), 2003.\n\nDavies, Anthony, and Stanley Wells, editors, Shakespeare and the Moving Image, Cambridge University Press (New York, NY), 1994.\n\nParsons, Keith, and Pamela Mason, Shakespeare in Performance, Salamander Books, 1995.\n\nShuttleworth, Ian, Ken and Em: A Biography, St. Martin's Press (New York, NY), 1995.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAdvocate, February 20, 1996, Mark Huisman, \"Prince of Players,\" pp. 43-49.\n\nChicago Tribune, May 20, 1990, Richard Christiansen, review of Beginning, p. 5; May 21, 1993, Dave Kehr, \"Shakespeare by Numbers,\" p.

Classically trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, where he was awarded the prestigious Bancroft Gold Medal as outstanding student of the year, Branagh completed his course of study in 1982, then moved rapidly into a series of attention-getting roles on the West End and on television. His early association with Shakespeare's plays began with an invitation to join the Royal Shakespeare Company at the age of twenty-three, and he became the youngest actor ever to perform the title role in an RSC production of Henry V. Important parts in other Shakespeare productions in that 1984–85 season contributed to Branagh's emergence as a stage director soon thereafter.\n\nHe left the RSC to direct an independent production of Romeo and Juliet (in which he also starred) and, primarily, to form (with actor David Parfitt) his own production group, which became a reality in 1987 as the Renaissance Theatre Company. Renaissance acquired a high profile in rapid time, with Branagh and other major British actors directing a variety of productions in which they also appeared, in London and on national and international tours. Hamlet (with Branagh in the title role, directed by Derek Jacobi)—which, like Henry V, would become a play with which Branagh would be permanently linked—and Twelfth Night (directed by Branagh and later remounted for television) were among Renaissance's most successful late-1980s productions. The company's success enabled Branagh to make his first film, now financed through the production company he called Renaissance Films PLC.\n\nMost actors who turn to film directing do so in mid-career, ordinarily after they have obtained considerable experience in front of the camera. Even Laurence Olivier, whose professional path Branagh's career so frequently appears to emulate, did not direct his first film until he was in his late thirties, and by then, after twenty-two screen appearances, he was a major star. In 1989, when Branagh directed his first film at the age of twenty-nine, his scant movie experience included just two feature films. By that time, however, he had achieved remarkable success as an actor, director, and producer on the British stage and in a variety of important television roles. And, as it happened, he had already written several plays of his own, one of them (Tell Me Honestly) produced by the RSC, another (Public Enemy) produced to launch the first Renaissance season. In this unusual, multitalented respect, Branagh's formative years most resemble the early career of Orson Welles—who made Citizen Kane, his first film, when he was twenty-six, after establishing a formidable theatre and radio presence in the late 1930s. Welles had the Mercury Theatre as his special training ground; Branagh had the Renaissance.\n\nIt is surely no accident, however, that the first film Branagh directed (and adapted and starred in) was the same first film which Laurence Olivier directed (and adapted and starred in): Henry V, the final history play in Shakespeare's tetralogy on kingship, which begins with Richard II and also includes King Henry IV, Parts One and Two. The comparisons and contrasts between the two films are genuinely striking, reflective of the periods in which they were made and of the imposing talents of the men who made them.\n\nOlivier, responding to Winston Churchill's plea for a film to rally Britain in the final days of World War II, creates a ringingly, unambiguously heroic Henry for the ages, an idealized monarch who leads England to victory against France with commanding force tempered by humanity. Olivier's Henry V ensures that English history is represented as comedy. The excision of lines spoken by the Chorus in the play's final scene makes the romantic pairing of Henry and Katherine appear deceptively permanent, thereby assuring the wartime spectator of a stable English future in fact contradicted by Shakespeare's text and by English history. This interpretation is visually reinforced: Olivier's Henry V is artfully shot to highlight a deliberate sense of artificial cinema space; a Disneyesque mise-en-scene, with its heightened technicolored landscapes, illustrates a fairy-tale universe in which battles are won with little serious injury.\n\nOlivier's and Branagh's versions of Henry V have virtually identical running times (136 and 138 minutes, respectively). Like Olivier's version, Branagh's attempts to create a reflexive illusion of theatre itself in the film's opening section, though Branagh alters and reduces Olivier's reconstruction of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre to insinuations of a movie sound stage. Like Olivier's version, Branagh's includes explicit references to Henry's earlier relationship with Falstaff in the two Henry IV plays. And, like Olivier's actors, Branagh's dazzling cast (many of them associated with Renaissance) includes some of the finest Shakespearean verse speakers available.\n\nIn virtually every other respect, Branagh's film diverges from Olivier's. His Henry V represents history as tragedy. Significant passages omitted by Olivier, because they reflect flaws in Henry's character or guilt at his father's usurpation of the crown from Richard II, are restored by Branagh. Although he properly retains the heroic elements required by such set speeches as the Saint Crispian's Day call to arms, his portrayal of the king emphasizes the dark and complex elements within Henry's character. Unlike Olivier's version, Branagh's film includes the conspiracy against Henry. This portion of the film is dimly lit, heavily shadowed. Henry behaves in Machiavellian fashion and appears unsympathetic in his own conspiratorial behavior. In text restored to the Harfleur sequence, Henry looks and sounds downright pathological. War scenes feature death marches; soldiers die in mud and muck. Quick cuts, slow-motion photography, extended tracking shots, and unusual framing perspectives are employed to heighten the inescapable anti-war ideology vital to Branagh's approach. A few more liberties are taken with the text than in Olivier's version, including the placement of the king at the hanging of Bardolph. The inclusion of liturgical music in Patrick Doyle's wonderfully evocative score contributes movingly to the film's power. Most notable of all, perhaps, Branagh restores the lines Olivier cut from the Chorus's speech which conclude the play on such a dark note. Henry V may, indeed, have created the world's \"best garden,\" but the peaceful idyll he achieved was short-lived once his infant son inherited the throne: \"Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crowned King/Of France and England, did this King succeed,/Whose state so many had the managing/That they lost France, and made his England bleed.\"\n\nBy any measure, Branagh's Henry V is a stunning film. That it succeeded so powerfully in duplicating, perhaps surpassing, Olivier's achievement is all the more striking in the context of its director's youthful audacity. Branagh's other Shakespeare films include the superb Much Ado about Nothing, Hamlet, and Othello (with Branagh cast as a vividly slimy Iago), which Branagh unfortunately did not direct. Othello is visually tame, the Shakespeare text excessively cut.\n\nBut Much Ado about Nothing proved that Branagh's success with Henry V was no fluke. Co-starring Emma Thompson as Beatrice opposite Branagh's Benedick, Much Ado certified his nimble approach in making Shakespeare accessible and entertaining, while preserving much of the original poetry and literacy. Branagh's screen adaptations of Much Ado and Hamlet also confirm what had become strikingly evident in his leadership of the Renaissance Theatre Company: He is a keenly savvy—some might say cynically savvy—marketer of his projects. By casting such actors as Keanu Reeves, Denzel Washington, and Robert Sean Leonard alongside Branagh, Thompson, and other British actors in Much Ado, and by casting Robin Williams, Jack Lemmon, Gerard Depardieu, and Billy Crystal alongside Branagh, Derek Jacobi, John Gielgud, and Julie Christie in Hamlet, Branagh strengthens his films' potential international markets, particularly in the United States. Such patterns of casting do not always work, but they do help to attract financing and have influenced recent attempts by others to adapt Shakespeare to the screen.\n\nAlthough the text of Much Ado about Nothing has been severely pruned by Branagh, like his Henry V, it emerges on screen as a highly intelligent, clearly told story. Filmed on location in Tuscany, Much Ado is visually enchanting, as vibrantly bright and sensually warm as Henry V is consciously dark and (until the wooing scene) cold. Like so much of his film work, Branagh's reading of Much Ado derives a great deal from his performance (also opposite Emma Thompson) in Renaissance's stage production of the play, directed by Judi Dench in 1988. Branagh has written of the potentially filmic images that haunted him during performances of that production in his introduction to the published screenplay: \"One night during Balthasar's song 'Sigh No More, Ladies,' the title sequence of this film played over and over in my mind; heat, haze and dust, grapes and horseflesh, and a nod to The Magnificent Seven. The men's sexy arrival, the atmosphere of rural Messina, the vigour and sensuality of the women, possessed me in the weeks, months, and years that followed.\"\n\n\"Emotional volatility,\" Branagh writes in this essay, was the key to the Beatrice-Benedick relationship. But, most especially—in Much Ado as in virtually all Renaissance stage and screen productions—the rehearsal process depended on a genuine desire to eliminate \"artificial Shakespeare voices\" in favor of acting \"naturalness\" which would retain the poetry while conveying the \"realistic, conversational tone\" present in much of the play's original dialogue. The witty battle of the sexes, so often the essence of comedy, is splendidly articulated here in the Branagh-Thompson dueling lovers. Like Henry V, Much Ado proves in both visual and aural terms that, even when Branagh cuts Shakespeare's text perhaps more than he should, he knows exactly how and why he is doing it.\n\nAmong Branagh's non-Shakespearean films, Dead Again deserves special mention. A film in which Branagh and Emma Thompson both play dual roles, it reveals Branagh's knowledge of other films, filmmakers, and genres—and his considerable versatility as both actor and director. Dead Again employs numerous conventions of film noir, including the periodic insertion of a 1940s plot-line, shot in black and white, into the film's main story, which is photographed in color. Numerous references to specific films (including Citizen Kane, Psycho, Vertigo, and noir detective pictures) periodically appear. (Dead Again even makes droll reference to one of its featured actor's early television successes: Derek Jacobi's I, Claudius series.) The film's detective hero, Mike Church, displays Branagh in James Cagney mode. The screenplay and performances are extremely witty, by turns frightening the spectator into total identification or saturating him with over-the-top red herrings that become self-reflexively and genuinely funny. Robin Williams's uncredited appearance as a psychiatrist is among the film's cleverest surprises.\n\nPeter's Friends and In the Bleak Midwinter are modest entertainments, partially autobiographical, it would appear, particularly In the Bleak Midwinter (released in the United States as A Midwinter's Tale). Here, Branagh affectionately satirizes a group of actors attempting to mount a production of Hamlet, and the film appeals especially to admirers of British theatre. It should be noted, particularly in audience anticipation of Branagh's Hamlet movie, that he returned to the RSC to play the title role in a magnificent, sold-out production of that play (directed by Adrian Noble) during the 1992–93 season. In numerous ways, Hamlet is likely to be the Shakespeare play with which Branagh (who also directed the all-star BBC radio version) remains most closely identified.\n\nMary Shelley's Frankenstein is as \"big\" a Branagh film as Peter's Friends and In the Bleak Midwinter are small ones. Produced by Francis Ford Coppola and costing forty-four million dollars, the film stars Branagh (who also directed) as Victor Frankenstein and Robert De Niro as the tormented creature. It contains numerous imaginative pleasures, but its overblown representation of an implicitly overblown story brought general critical wrath upon Branagh's head at the time of its release. It has became a rare example of a Branagh film that (to date) is a commercial failure.\n\nIn January, 2000, Branagh was awarded the Golden Quill by the Shakespeare Guild, an American society devoted to fostering appreciation of the Bard in the United States. The award preceded by three months the American premiere of Branagh's film Much Ado about Nothing—a work taking what might be considered substantial liberties with the Shakespearean text. Branaugh, who starred, directed, and wrote the screenplay, set the story in the 1930s and made it a musical comedy, complete with period songs by Irving Berlin and Cole Porter. American critics tended to praise the film for its freshness and mixture of cinematic styles; British reviewers were, on the whole, considerably less generous.\n\nThe careers of Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson, as frequent co-stars and a prominent acting couple, have attracted considerable publicity, especially since their marriage in 1989 and separation in 1995. (Their relationship has invited frequent comparison to the one between Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, who eventually divorced.) Each has always made films without the other; and Thompson has won Oscars for Best Actress in Howards End and for Best Screenplay Adaptation for Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility. Nevertheless, some of the most magical moments in Branagh's films feature the two of them together (Henry V, Peter's Friends, Dead Again, Much Ado about Nothing).\n\n—Mark W.
