Set on the famous train during a snowstorm, the story follows famed detective Poirot as he attempts to solve the murder mystery of a fellow passenger. The whodunit is one of Christie's most well-known novels.\n\nBranagh recently directed a live-action version of \"Cinderella,\" starring Lily James and Cate Blanchett. His directing film credits also include the Shakespearean adaptations \"As You Like It,\" \"Hamlet,\" \"A Midwinter's Tale\" and \"Much Ado About Nothing.\"\n\nThe eponymous actor/director/producer is also the head of the Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company, supported by Rob Ashford and Christopher Oram as artistic associates. Earlier this year, the company announced a year-long residency of five productions to be staged at the West End's Garrick Theatre. The opening productions, Terrence Rattigan's Harlequinade and Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale, opened this month featuring Branagh himself, Judi Dench and Zoё Wanamaker.\n\nKenneth Branagh Productions to Be Broadcast Internationally in Live Screenings\n\nAs reported by Deadline, Branagh will also produce the \"Orient Express\" remake alongside Ridley Scott, Simon Kinberg and Mark Gordon."
