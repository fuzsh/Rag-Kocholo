        "text": "Plays at The Garrick from The Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company promises an unmissable first season of cinema broadcasts. Working in collaboration with artistic associates, director Rob Ashford and designer Christopher Oram, the acclaimed actor-director Kenneth Branagh (Henry V, Hamlet, Dead Again, Cinderella) presents an exceptional series of plays that brings together a remarkable group of actors, including Judi Dench, Derek Jacobi, and Kenneth Branagh. The first of three plays expected this season, The Winter’s Tale is Shakespeareʼs timeless tragicomedy of obsession and redemption reimagined in a new production co-directed by Rob Ashford and Kenneth Branagh, following their triumphant staging of Macbeth in Manchester and Manhattan. Judi Dench will play Paulina, Kenneth Branagh will play Leontes.\n\nRuntime is approximate and includes at least one intermission. This is not a live broadcast.\n\nTickets: $25 (members), $30 (nonmembers)"
