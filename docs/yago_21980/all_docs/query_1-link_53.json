It is the story of an American tourist, his wife and daughter who rush into the U.S. embassy two steps ahead of the secret police who suspect them of spying and taking pictures in an unauthorized area. To stay out of jail, the Hollanders take refuge in the American Embassy, which is temporarily being run by the absent ambassador's diplomatically incompetent son. The plot thickens as they carefully and frantically plan their escape. The ambassador’s son and the Hollander’s daughter even have time to fall in love.\n\n_____\n\nTHE COMEDY OF ERRORS, by Shakespeare, directed by Lawrence Gregory Smith, 7/25 - 8/18 Tue - Sun 7:00 (no mainstage performances on Mondays, but see the listings for A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S TOUR which is only on Mondays). All performances are FREE, non-ticketed and open to the public. Donations are graciously accepted. All performances are on \"Shakespeare Hill\" in Delaware Park near the rose garden and The Terrace Restaurant. Chairs can be rented from Shakespeare in Delaware Park. For details visit shakespeareindelawarepark.org/season/2024-49th-season/\n\nA note from the director, Lawrence Gregory Smith: While remaining true to Shakespeare’s story, text, and traditions, this quick-paced and energetic production will be set within the tapestry of 1970s variety and game shows – think ROWAN & MARTIN’S LAUGH-IN, LET’S MAKE A DEAL, and MATCH GAME. This will be a rich, colorful weaving of comedic fabric – fast, flamboyant and fun!\n\nTHE COMEDY OF ERRORS PLOT SUMMARY: Egeon, a merchant from Syracuse, is arrested in Ephesus while searching for his lost wife and one of his twin sons. Unknown to him, both his twin sons and their twin servants are now in Ephesus. As Antipholus of Syracuse and his servant Dromio arrive, they're mistaken for their Ephesian twins.\n\nA whirlwind of confusion unfolds: Adriana, wife of Antipholus of Ephesus, unknowingly dines with the wrong husband. Debts are claimed, jewelry is misplaced, and accusations of infidelity and madness abound. The Ephesian Antipholus is arrested for unpaid debts, while his twin is believed mad.\n\nEventually, all parties converge. The twins meet face-to-face, Egeon recognizes his sons, and his lost wife, now an abbess, is reunited with her family. Misunderstandings are cleared, and the comedy concludes with joyous reconciliations.\n\n_____\n\nOPENINGS LATER THIS AUGUST (a partial listing):\n\nTHE LIGHT AND THE DARK (THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ARTEMISIA GENTILESCHI), a play by Kate Hamill, directed by Jade King Carroll, presented by Chautauqua Theater Company in the Bratton Theater. Previews: Aug. 10–14, Performance Dates: Aug. 15–23\n\nTHE LIGHT AND THE DARK PUBLICITY BLURB: Artemisia Gentileschi, a trailblazing artist, was the most successful female painter of the 17th century. Her artistic legacy endures as one of the few Baroque-era female artists, with dozens of paintings exhibited globally alongside Rafael and Caravaggio. Artemisia, characterized by her irreverence and audacity, aspired to attain immortality through her groundbreaking work. However, her journey took an unexpected turn, marked by a series of brutal betrayals that forever altered her life and art. The resulting transformation kindled a fire within her, a flame that continues to astonish and resonate with audiences today.\n\nThe Light and The Dark delves into the profound impact of art in assuaging trauma and explores the transformative power of female rage in reshaping societal paradigms.\n\nThis production includes adult content — nudity, a depiction of torture and an act of sexual violence as well as profanity — and may not be suitable for youth 13 and under.
