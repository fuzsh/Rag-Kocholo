        "text": "Sir Kenneth Charles Branagh is a Northern Irish-British actor, director, producer, and screenwriter, best known for directing numerous adaptations of Shakespeare's plays, such as Henry V, Othello, Much Ado About Nothing, and Hamlet. His other film credits include Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Wild Wild West, and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. He also voiced Miguel in the 2000 DreamWorks animated film The Road to El Dorado.\n\nFor Disney, he directed the 2015 live-action adaptation of Cinderella and the 2020 film Artemis Fowl. He also played Herr Knopp and Gestapo in Swing Kids. He directed the 2011 film Thor, which served as the fourth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He also did an uncredited voice appearance as the Asgardian Distress Caller at the beginning of Avengers: Infinity War. Additionally, he directed the Fox films Death on the Nile and A Haunting in Venice, in which he reprised his role of Hercule Poirot from 2017's Murder on the Orient Express.\n\nRoles[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHe was considered for the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. However, Ewan McGregor was cast instead.\n\nBranagh was once married with Dame Emma Thompson from 1989 to 1995, of which they met in 1987 during the filming of the BBC television series Fortunes of War and has appeared together in several films, such as Look Back in Anger, Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing, Dead Again, and Peter's Friends, and both couple would eventually separate in 1995 due to Branagh's affair with Helena Bonham Carter. In addition, Branagh, Thompson, and Bonham Carter later went on to appear in the Harry Potter franchise, albeit in different films; as well as participated in the respective Disney live-action adaptations (of which Branagh directed 2015's Cinderella, with Bonham Carter playing the Fairy Godmother and Thompson playing Mrs. Potts in 2017's Beauty and the Beast, respectively).\n\n[]"
