        "text": "Love and money take center stage in Kenneth Branagh’s redo of Agatha Christie’s “Death on the Nile.” He’s both behind the camera as director and in front of it as iconic Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot, a persnickety man of precision sporting a huge mustache curled up at the ends. Indeed, the ’stache is back, with its own origin story to boot.\n\nBranagh digs deep into his detective’s psyche in reprising the role he first tackled in 2017’s “Murder on the Orient Express,” which he also directed. It begins with a black-and-white flashback to the trenches of World War I, where the young Poirot’s instinct on the battlefield saves his fellow soldiers. Thanks to the advice of a past love, he parlays his heroics into the boldest facial hair in all of Belgium.\n\nSouth Shore Oscar night: South Shore Oscar night: Quincy native nabs second Academy Award nomination\n\nVery impressive, but it can’t disguise a wonky screenplay by Michael Green, that, like his script for “Orient Express,” relies heavily on exotic locales – on the Karnak, a riverboat in Egypt – and big stars cast as either suspects or victims. The occasion is the wedding of Linnet, an heiress (Gal Gadot), and Simon Doyle, a handsome playboy (Armie Hammer), previously engaged to Linnet’s bestie, Jacqueline (Emma Mackey), now openly stalking the newlyweds.\n\nAlso aboard are various family members and friends played by the likes of Annette Bening, Russell Brand, Rose Leslie, Sophie Okonedo, Jennifer Saunders and Letitia Wright. Tom Bateman is back as Bouk, Poirot’s pal from “Murder on the Orient Express.” When one of the passengers is killed, everyone is a suspect. Poirot gets to work questioning the aunt, cousin, lawyer, nurse, doctor, etc. Everyone, it seems, has a motive for murder. Don’t they always?\n\nTwo Jens for Valentine's Day: Milton's Jenny Slate leads 'I Want You Back'; J-Lo tops 'Marry Me'\n\nThere are numerous weapons aboard the ship and even more red herrings. Even if you haven’t read the book or seen the 1978 film (starring Mia Farrow and Bette Davis), you’ll probably figure it out faster than Poirot. For Branagh, the thing is danger and suspense: Lunging rattlesnakes, falling boulders ... It doesn’t really work because no one is killed until the second hour. That means sitting through 60 minutes of draggy setup and exposition. These characters are just not delicious enough to remain that patient. Computer-generated scenery of Egyptian pyramids only gets you so far. And no one wants to watch Hammer bump and grind on the dance floor in the wake of real-life allegations of sexual assault. Ewwwwww!\n\nPoirot, taking people-watching to a whole new level, is always the most interesting man in the room. Like the ace detective, Branagh the director is attentive to drawing a robust performance out of Branagh the actor. Playing Poirot with newfound humanity, Branagh fleshes out the gumshoe’s psyche like never before, as Poirot laments a lost love and ponders reopening his heart.\n\nThe methodology of how Poirot solves these mysteries is always the draw to Agatha Christie “cozies.” The fun is in Poirot’s legendary powers of observation, deduction and reveals, which once the body count expands, occur too quickly. The pace suddenly picks up steam and it’s jarring after the slow-as-a-riverboat opening acts, making quick work of this one and that one before suddenly the killer is exposed.\n\nAfter earning a trio of Oscar nominations this week for “Belfast,” including best director, Branagh is having a really good stretch. “Death on the Nile” isn’t likely to add to it.\n\nMovie review: Renate Reinsve is at her best in 'Worst Person in the World'\n\nA novel idea: Amazon's 'Book of Love' mixes classic rom-com with telenovela\n\n'Death on the Nile'\n\nRating: PG-13 for violence, bloody images and sexual material\n\nCast: Kenneth Branagh, Tom Bateman, Annette Bening, Russell Brand, Ali Fazal, Dawn French, Gal Gadot, Armie Hammer, Rose Leslie, Emma Mackey, Sophie Okonedo, Jennifer Saunders and Letitia Wright\n\nDirector: Kenneth Branagh\n\nWriter: Michael Green\n\nRunning time: 127 minutes.\n\nGrade: B-\n\nThanks to our subscribers, who help make this coverage possible.
