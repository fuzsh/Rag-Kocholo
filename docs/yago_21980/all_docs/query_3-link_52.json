        "text": "Excerpt from a Rhode Island Film Festival press release:\n\n\"We were very pleased to have on hand Stuart Bailey, the Executive Producer from Blackfriars Productions who produced Kenneth Branaghs short film \"Listening,\" which won First Prize for Best Director.\" Bailey presented Branaghs acceptance remarks:\n\n\"I made Listening as an experiment. I love the short film, and for me it was a marvellous way to explore a compressed narrative, where very little was said, (a real challenge for me!), and where picture, sound and silence try to work in a different relationship than in my other work. For all of us who worked on it, was a great communal and collaborative experience. It was made with love, and we offer it up to you in the same spirit.\n\n\"To all the organisers whose hard work has made it possible, to the sponsors who help enable it, and to the audience tonight and to come, who make the festival what it is. I am so sorry that I can't be with you this evening."
