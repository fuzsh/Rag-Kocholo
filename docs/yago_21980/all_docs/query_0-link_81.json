        "text": "Kenneth Branagh has filmed his production of The Winter’s Tale at the refurbished Garrick Theatre. Choosing to film the play in the theatre is a far less expensive option than making a film of the play with its attendant costs, but there are downsides.\n\nThis approach is designed to give the filmgoers the experience of being in the theatre and Branagh begins by giving the film-goers a lengthy (10 minute or so at least) shot looking down from the gods into the theatre. It is as if you are sitting in the theatre waiting for the play to begin. Following on from nearly 20 minutes of advertisements in the cinema, this is a trifle tedious.\n\nThis is followed by an introduction from Branagh which is only slightly less tedious than the shot of the inside of the theatre. But these are quibbles.\n\nLess of a quibble is that the lighting in the theatre does not translate well onto the screen. The entire production is filmed in very low light that makes it difficult to discern some of the details which camera can pick up and that a theatre audience may not see. So the poor lighting loses one of the advantages of this particular form of production.\n\nThe other irritating problem with this film is that the cinematographer has not managed to get his focal lengths and perspectives right. Characters on the left-hand side of the stage are nearly three times as tall as those on the right. As they move across stage, they either grow or shrink depending on which direction they are moving. Characters who come onstage from the left look as if they are walking in on stilts.\n\nNow Branagh has made some of the best Shakespearean films in recent years:\n\nHamlet,\n\nHenry the Fifth\n\nand a glorious Much Ado about Nothing where he stars with the wonderful Emma Thompson,\n\nSo you would expect that he would understand how to bring a Shakespearean play to the cinema screen, but his cinematographer and his lighting director have lets him down fairly badly in this production.\n\nSo what is to like about this production? Pretty much everything else. As I’ve explained elsewhere, I don’t think this is a great Shakespearean play with its clunky plot and psychological improbabilities. But this having been said, the acting is superb.\n\nTo start with, we have the incomparable Judi Dench as Paulina. She brings a deep compassion to the role which has echoes of the fool in King Lear. It’s a commentary on the longevity of the talent of this actor that she has now played all three of the women in The Winter’s Tale.\n\nJudi Dench as Paulina in the film of Kenneth Branagh’s 2016 production\n\nas Hermione in the Royal Shakespeare Theatre’s 1969 production\n\nand as Perdita in the 1970 Royal Shakespeare Company’s production\n\nSome actors have a special magic when it comes to Shakespeare and Judy Dench is one of them. She brings to the role of Paulina a passionate energy when confronted with injustice but also a note of sadness born of experience. Her final speech is Shakespeare at his best.\n\nPaulina: There’s time enough for that;\n\nLest they desire upon this push to trouble\n\nYour joys with like relation. Go together,\n\nYou precious winners all; your exultation\n\nPartake to every one. I, an old turtle,\n\nWill wing me to some wither’d bough and there\n\nMy mate, that’s never to be found again,\n\nLament till I am lost.\n\nKenneth Branagh is excellent as Leontes particularly in Act 1 Scene 2 where he oscillates between his increasingly insane jealousy and the calm exchanges he must have to disguise it.\n\nLeontes. Too hot, too hot!\n\nTo mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.\n\nI have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances; 185\n\nBut not for joy; not joy. This entertainment\n\nMay a free face put on, derive a liberty\n\nFrom heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,\n\nAnd well become the agent; ‘t may, I grant;\n\nBut to be paddling palms and pinching fingers, 190\n\nAs now they are, and making practised smiles,\n\nAs in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as ’twere\n\nThe mort o’ the deer; O, that is entertainment\n\nMy bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,\n\nArt thou my boy?\n\nand then when the floodgates open\n\nThere have been,\n\nOr I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;\n\nAnd many a man there is, even at this present,\n\nNow while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,\n\nThat little thinks she has been sluiced in’s absence 285\n\nAnd his pond fish’d by his next neighbour, by\n\nSir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there’s comfort in’t\n\nWhiles other men have gates and those gates open’d,\n\nAs mine, against their will.\n\nAfter Paulina presents him with the baby Perdita and he begins a slow process of realisation of what he has done, Branagh’s Leontes shrinks as a stage presence and everything about him indicates the terrible price he is paying.\n\nAntigonus with the baby Perdita. She is to be abandoned, he eaten by a bear\n\nAs a director, Branagh skilfully negotiates one of the difficulties of the play: the overlong wool shearing scene. He turns it into an Eastern European fertility rite with the shepherds, the shepherdesses and particularly Perdita brimming with erotic energy.\n\nTom Bateman and Jessie Buckley as Florizel and Perdita\n\nMiranda Raison brings a quiet dignity to the role of Hermione, Leontes’ wronged wife.\n\nHer response to Leontes’ histrionics is measured and restrained.\n\nHermione. No, by my life.\n\nPrivy to none of this. How will this grieve you,\n\nWhen you shall come to clearer knowledge, that\n\nYou thus have publish’d me! Gentle my lord,\n\nYou scarce can right me throughly then to say\n\nYou did mistake.……….\n\nThere’s some ill planet reigns:\n\nI must be patient till the heavens look\n\nWith an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,\n\nI am not prone to weeping, as our sex\n\nCommonly are; the want of which vain dew\n\nPerchance shall dry your pities: but I have\n\nThat honourable grief lodged here which burns\n\nWorse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,\n\nWith thoughts so qualified as your charities\n\nShall best instruct you, measure me; and so\n\nThe king’s will be perform’d!\n\nIn the final scene she is revealed as the statue that, in true fairytale form, comes to life.\n\nHer response is revealing.\n\nPaulina Turn, good lady;\n\nOur Perdita is found.\n\nHermione.You gods, look down\n\nAnd from your sacred vials pour your graces\n\nUpon my daughter’s head! Tell me, mine own.\n\nWhere hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found\n\nThy father’s court? for thou shalt hear that I,\n\nKnowing by Paulina that the oracle\n\nGave hope thou wast in being, have preserved\n\nMyself to see the issue.\n\nNot a word to Leontes. Hermione has been waiting sixteen years in the hope that her daughter was alive.\n\nAnd in his final speech Leontes does not have a word to say to Hermione.\n\nIf this play is reworking the themes of the great tragedies particularly Othello and King Lear, then redemption and reconciliation for Leontes are both muted and qualified."
