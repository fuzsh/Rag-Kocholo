        "text": "Every person (or, at least, every film enthusiast, I really should say) can, typically, name the one actor whose talent never ceases to dazzle them. In addition, they can also, likely, name a certain filmmaker whose work and directorial style they admire over anyone else. Sometimes, a movie fan’s choice of a favorite actor and a favorite director can end up being the same person, such as in the case of Sir Kenneth Branagh.\n\nThe Northern Ireland native came to prominence in the late 1980s and early ‘90s as one of the most acclaimed and respected actors of his generation for giving performances in movies that, many of which, he also helmed himself. He is still known to juggle both talents at once with some recent favorites (such as his second Agatha Christie adaptation, Death on the Nile), while sometimes taking a moment to focus on one duty at a time and, often, with wonderful results either way. See for yourself by taking a look at our picks for Kenneth Branagh’s best movies on streaming, available for a digital rental, or for purchase on physical media, starting with one of his definitive efforts from both behind and in front of the camera.\n\nHenry V (1989)\n\nAfter facing ridicule from the French King Charles VI (Paul Scofields), the young, vengeful ruler of England (Kenneth Branagh) aspires to conquer the country of France for himself, resulting in horror on the battlefield and turmoil in his own soul.\n\nWhy it’s one of Kenneth Branagh’s best movies: Kenneth Branagh earned Academy Award nominations both for directing and playing the lead of Henry V -
