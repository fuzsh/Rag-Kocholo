        "text": "King Leontes of Sicilia falsely accuses his wife, Hermione, of infidelity with his best friend, the King of Bohemia. Inflamed by jealousy and convinced that he is right, Leontes’ torment causes a storm of loss that only the next generation can heal. Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale is a captivating parable of betrayals, renewed hope, and the transformative power of time.\n\nDirected by CSC Associate Artistic Director Bryn Boice in her Boston Common debut, the production will take place at the Parkman Bandstand on July 16 – August 4, 2024 in partnership with the City of Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu, Parks and Recreation Commissioner Ryan Woods, and Boston Chief of Arts and Culture Kara Elliott-Ortega.\n\nSEE THY WORDS: All performances are Open Captioned.

This is because it holds both tragedy and comedy together in its plot. Deep-seated jealousy, a false sense of betrayal, and desire for revenge are among the themes that the play explores, in addition to a child and mother dying, child abandonment, false imprisonment, pick-pocketing–and being pursued by a bear (while exiting). For these reasons, we encourage you to consider whether this play may be appropriate for young children. We always recommend parents/teachers/guardians to read the play script and/or screen an earlier free performance if they are unsure.\n\nThe Winter’s Tale runs approximately two hours and twenty minutes plus a 15 minute intermission\n\nAudience Information\n\nPerformances are FREE of charge.\n\nAudience members are permitted to bring modest food items to consume at the show.

This event was described by Ed Siegel of the Boston Globe as “fully engaging, with one of the most diverse audiences ever seen in Boston.” The production was chosen as one of the top ten theatrical events of 1996 by the Boston Globe, and Mr. Maler received the Eliot Norton Award for his outstanding direction. Carolyn Clay of the Boston Phoenix wrote, “how proud it is for Boston to finally offer free Shakespeare.”\n\nFollowing the success of its first production, CSC presented Romeo & Juliet at the newly renovated Parkman Bandstand on Boston Common in August of 1997. Performing annually at the Parkman Bandstand — centrally located, handicapped-accessible and accessible to all by public transportation — CSC has become one of Boston’s most attended annual arts events. Each summer CSC welcomes approximately upwards of 50,000 people to our shows on the Boston Common, and over the past 28 years CSC has performed for over 1 million audience members.\n\nFree Shakespeare on the Common is possible thanks to the support of friends like you. There are a number of ways to support CSC. Donations will be collected on the Common or you can also CLICK HERE."
