        "text": "April 16, 2016\n\nJust as magical as the movie.\n\nFirst, I have to say that if I ever were marooned on an island with electricity, dvd player, etc...and I could have only one movie, this one would be it. (If I could have two, I'd also pick Galaxy Quest. I have such a serious mind.)\n\nBut rather than go on and turn this into a desert island disc choice, I have to say that reading this gave me more insight into some of the character's situations and therefore why they said the lines they said. Most of this book was filmed, yet there were a few lines and short scenes that did not make the cut, which was an added bonus to read.\n\nI truly wish Kenneth Branagh had written another screen play based on these eccentric - if wonderful - characters.\n\nJanuary 1, 2023\n\nWe found this movie by chance at our library 22 years ago and loved it. As theater geeks it spoke to us and we delight in showing it to fellow geeks, usually to confusion then delight. Such a treat to find this under the tree this Christmas! Wonderful to see the lines and hear the actors' voices in my head while also filling in the blanks of lines that I've missed on 10+ viewings. Will reread and share with Shakespeare fans and theater geeks alike in this form as well as the movie.\n\nJanuary 31, 2023\n\nThis was great; not a surprise given the movie, and it gives more insight into such a delightful film.\n\nFebruary 16, 2011\n\nI was so disappointed in this book - I had hoped to find a new series of mystery novels to explore, but this will not be it. I couldn't believe how inappropriate a minister could be - having dinner at the home of a married man when his wife was out of town... and then being surprised when the small town folk noticed her car there all night. Duh. And why she decides to pursue investigations on her own rather than letting the police do its job... dumb, dumb, dumb.\n\nAugust 18, 2012\n\nThis is the shooting script for the movie that Sir Kenneth made about theatre life and aspiring to grow into film from stage. This is another one my favorite films, and having been in theatre for many years I can relate to so much. I feel I lived it. The written text is fantastic for seeing all the nuances that you may not have caught in the film."
