        "text": "Music and acting\n\nDornacker was the tall lead singer (Leila), keyboardist, and songwriter of the 1970s/1980s San Francisco \"tack\" rock group Leila and the Snakes. Pearl Gates and Pamela Wood provided supporting vocals. Their repertoire included \"Rock and Roll Weirdos,\" \"Pyramid Power\" and a spoof version of Peggy Lee's \"Is That All There Is?\" Gates later left (and took the band with her) to form Pearl Harbor and the Explosions. Guitarist Miles Corbin went on to form the surf instrumental band the Aqua Velvets.\n\nDornacker provided lead vocals on \"Christopher Columbus\" (1978), a song by R. Crumb & His Cheap Suit Serenaders. With Ron Nagle, she co-wrote the humorous hit song \"Don't Touch Me There\" for The Tubes. The song was sung by Re Styles and appeared on The Tubes' second studio album, Young and Rich (1976), and was released as a 7\" single in the US, the UK, and the Netherlands. The B-side was \"Proud to Be an American\". Jane had also toured with The Tubes as a backing singer and dancer.\n\nDornacker was also an actress. She appeared in playwright Sam Shepard's jazz opera Inacoma at San Francisco's Magic Theatre (1977) and was featured in other works by the Overtone Theatre. She appeared in The Stand-Up, Anita Sperm and as the mysterious Nurse Murch in the film The Right Stuff.\n\nStand up comedy and radio\n\nDornacker developed a successful career as a stand-up comic on the San Francisco circuit and did her first work as a traffic reporter in the early-mid-1980s for KFRC, a popular Top 40 radio station. She worked with Don Rose, who was that station's morning disc jockey at the time. She was noted for her exceptionally fast speech, so fast it required concentration to understand her. As she did traffic, she would tell her daughter Naomi to get up and get to school. She moved to New York City to become a much-loved, raspy-voiced \"trafficologist\" and \"Jane-in-a-plane.\" After Dornacker died, Rose arranged several tributes to establish a college fund for Naomi.\n\nDornacker survived one helicopter crash only to die in a second helicopter crash in the same year. On April 18, 1986, Dornacker was reporting from a WNBC helicopter over the Hackensack River in New Jersey when the aircraft crashed into the river. She and the pilot survived and were able to swim to shore.\n\nDeath\n\nOn October 22, 1986, Dornacker was giving one of the station's N-Copter traffic reports during the Joey Reynolds Show on WNBC Radio in New York City. At 4:44 p.m., the Enstrom F-28 helicopter she was aboard plunged into the Hudson River from an altitude of roughly 75 feet (23 m). Dornacker was starting her report for incoming New Jersey traffic when the helicopter suffered mechanical failure in mid broadcast and crashed. Her last words were, \"Hit the water, hit the water, hit the water!\"\n\nThe F-28 helicopter nose-dived, struck the top of a chain link fence at a river pier, crashed into the Hudson River very near to the Manhattan shore and sank in 15 to 20 feet (5 to 6 m) of water. Both occupants were trapped for nearly 10â€“15 minutes before help arrived. Dornacker died on her way to Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center. She was 39 years old. Pilot Bill Pate, the only other occupant, was severely injured but survived.\n\nIn the subsequent investigation, the NTSB found that the sprag clutch that was installed in the helicopter, which was on lease to WNBC Radio by Spectrum Helicopters of Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, was a military surplus part which was not designed for use in a civilian aircraft, and that the part had not been adequately lubricated. It directly led to a mid-air seizure of the main rotor blades.\n\nFinal crash transcript\n\nAircheck of the incident\n\nAftermath\n\nDornacker's then 16-year-old daughter, Naomi, received $325,000 in a settlement with owner Spectrum Helicopters of Ridgefield Park, NJ, and the maker of the helicopter. Naomi's father Bob Knickerbocker died shortly before her mother's death.\n\nAll the New York stations grounded their traffic helicopters for a few days after the accident.\n\nA memorial concert in celebration of Jane took place at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco on Saturday, November 22, 1986.\n\nThere is a memorial to her in Wayne, New Jersey, where Dornacker and her family lived.\n\nShortly after the incident, several on-air interviews with WNBC Radio staff described the incident and their feelings in detail, including how other news organizations \"pumped news\" into the WNBC Radio newsroom as they were all in shock. Joey Reynolds broke down on-air when talking about her now-orphaned child. WNBC played other interviews with friends and recordings of her talking about the first helicopter crash earlier that same year. Her music was also played during these tribute shows including \"Don't Touch Me There\" which she wrote for The Tubes."
