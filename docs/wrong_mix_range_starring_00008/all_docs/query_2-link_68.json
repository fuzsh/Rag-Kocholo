        "text": "Where I was sitting (working) when âthatâ phone call came in\n\nâPaul, itâs Ed. How would you like to paint the Starship Enterprise?â\n\nTom Cranham (the only pic I have of him) and George Pryor\n\nof âLittle Georgie and the Storyboardsâ fame\n\nThe room underneath my studio on Dillon where Bob Keane recorded Richie Valensâ three first records: âCome On Letâs Goâ âDonnaâ and\n\nthe vocals for âLa Bambaâ\n\nThe photo on the lower right is me playing with Clapton and Gary at the Parrot Christmas of 1984...Rosie took the picture. The conch shell to the left of the picture was my going away present from the FX crew in September of 1979\n\nWith the adorable and endlessly funny and charming Susan in front of the main (stunning) Victorian building at Skywalker Ranch that houses the library, cafeteria, and various offices. The library would knock your socks off...what a place...also the location of that famous last interview before his death in 1987 of Joseph Campbell, who influenced both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg with his 1949 landmark book,\n\nâThe Hero With a Thousand Facesâ\n\nMy bed alcove was just to the left of the picture...Flash & Raffles (Raff zonked out by the front door in my studio) would sleep on that far corner of the sofa so they could keep an eye out the window for anything interesting happening in the garden below. When they heard me making waking up noises, I would hear âplonk-plonkâ as they jumped down off the sofa, which they were not allowed on because of all the cat hair they would leave. I had to smile at their guile, playing me...âWhat? Who...us??? We werenât up there!â\n\nCute\n\nThe nifty Toshiba television I gave to Ed when I moved to England the second time in 1991\n\nFabulous folding Polaroid SLR camera that EVERY illustrator needed to gather instant reference...such a clever design and ever so useful before digital cameras\n\nnext to my mint 1921 Western Electric candlestick phone...the first year they included the dial on the handset\n\nKenney Jones jazzinâ it up with the Tornados at his polo club.\n\nI took the photo, and itâs the best photo Iâve seen of him...he was so happy playing with these guys, and playing on his jazz heroâs kit---Clem Cattini\n\nPeter at work in my studio at the LaBamba house...he was living in Taos, New Mexico at this time, and when he got a job in LA, would bring his drawing table and art supplies and work alongside me. I loved watching him create. Such a monster of a talent.\n\nComing into Death Valley, summer (!) of 1980. 115F. Morris blew third gear climbing out of the valley, but we managed to limp him home for a rebuilt gearbox by a whizzo British mechanic in Silverlake...which is still working perfectly. Iâm wearing the very first shirt Lesley ever made for me. So strange she made it 10 years earlier at the Elm Grove flat in Barnes on her new Bernina, and now Iâm wearing it in Death Valley.\n\nRobin Trowerâs âBridge of Sighsâ oil painting (32â sq). Painted in one go at the flat in Barnes...I stayed up all night. The painting has not been cared for as can be seen on the right hand side...it looks like it has been stored flat with something on top of it. Someday it will be in a museum, but at present it is in Chrysalisâ offices in Notting Hill...hopefully being cared for.\n\nAussie singer, Ron Charles, in the back garden of the Battersea house, 1975, just before we went to the Supertramp âMoving to Americaâ party and my consequent move to LA. Ron always went for slim women, whilst I liked busty ones...and he now lives happily back in Melbourne with a busty nurse very proud of her assets. âI understand now why you always went on about big tits!â he laughs\n\nAhhh...just received this from Wronald (I call him that) of his contemporary single from that time in 1975...and heâs still knockinâ âem dead in Melbourne today with his pipes (and quite happily living with that busty nurse!)\n\nNo Fru...one of two lonely heart-wrenching 500-mile trips to walk âourâ walk without her...so painful, yet I had to do it, and the next time Iâm in Cornwall I know Iâll walk this walk to the sea without her again\n\nThe church in Huish, Wilsthire, where David and Primmie were married and where Primmie is buried. Her grave is the second from the right in the foreground left of the path. She was only 28"
