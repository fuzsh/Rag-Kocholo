        "text": "Great band, even if there were hideously cheesy moments on almost every album. I'd say those are the three to have. CBP takes a lot of heat for being a big David Foster production but I like it- it's actually one of their most consistent albums in terms of songs. Remote Control is good; it's the transition from over the top glam show band to a leaner rock hits band. I like the albums after CBP as well.\n\nFee Waybill is a great singer! My top two are Remote Control and Completion Backwards Principle. Outside Inside has the great No, Not Again and Love Bomb is good, too! I like 'em a lot! They had a close relationship with Todd Rundgren and I saw them tour with him. That was a great show!\n\nSaw them a few times at the Roxy in Los Angeles.\n\nDuring one show, this gal in a trench coat came and sat at the empty table next to where I was sitting. Next thing I knew she took it off and was just wearing a g-string. Turns out she was part of the show!\n\nThat was a fun night.\n\nI have just really discovered the Tubes in the last few years. Fee Waybill has become involved in a local summerstock theater company near here (The Barn in Allegan Michigan) and has starred in several productions over the past 5 years or so. He is a pretty good dramatic actor and singer which brought me to start exploring The Tubes. The only album I own is the live “Tubes World Tour”, which is good, but I got the chance to see them for the first time live about 3 years ago and they were great. The band also did a benefit show for The Barn the summer before last, but I had a conflict and could not go. I have become a fan, but back in the day they pretty much passed me by other than their hits.\n\nGreat band and I think Fee is one of rock's all time greatest singers. I need more of their stuff; I only have \"Completion Backwards Principle\" and \"Outside Inside.\" I love them both! I used to play \"Tip of My Tongue\" in a band that had three horns; that was a blast!\n\nSaw them at Bimbo's in '76, and several times since - their shows back in the mid-'70s were spectacles beyond belief; since then they've put on good, competent rock shows. Excellent songs performed and sung well. I gather there are only a few original members left though.\n\nYou picked the right albums to buy. \"Young and Rich\" would be the next one to get.\n\n1st concert I ever saw...San Jose June '76. The 1st album (with White Punks on Dope) is a must have along with 1978's double live album \"What do you Want from Live?\" After that, albums get very uneven. In the 70's fantastic theatrics, great musicianship, and 2 keyboardists (Vince Welnick on piano who later played with the Grateful Dead) and Michael Cotton who played a massive modular synth on stage."
