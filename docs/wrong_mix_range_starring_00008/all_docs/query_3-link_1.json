It also marks Muhlach's return since Of All The Things in 2012.[5]\n\nThe Bonifacio children put letters in a can of Rebisco biscuits for their father, Barangay captain Manuel Bonifacio, a former overseas Filipino worker from Batangas. The opening scene also features pictures of the family at different points in time.\n\nIn the present, Manuel is a widower who lives with his nephew Jun. On his birthday, he is greeted by the townsfolk as he celebrates another birthday, he also receives birthday greetings from his children as well but however late in the evening, he receives the news from Dr. Nelson that he has lung cancer and has only two to five months to live.\n\nAll of the Bonifacio children: Allan, Bryan, Charmaine, and Dexter arrive at their old household and vote to let Manuel decide the last will and testament. The children decide to visit the old family household for seven Sundays in spite of their own problems: Allan is competing with a rival business owner named Mr. Kim, Bry wants to meet a woman named Juliana Smith, Cha struggles with her husband Jerry's infidelity and Dex is on the run after a botched concert event.\n\nDex is the first to arrive at the old household after he is told by his roommates to hide somewhere else after some victims are able to locate his room. He stays for some time and goes out to buy some call credits, and there he meets Camille, his old friend. They have gone to Allan's store and realize that he is facing financial issues.\n\nThe next day, the Bonifacio children decide to host a birthday party for their own father after not showing up to his birthday proper. They ask Jun to stall their father in order to buy some time; however, Manuel catches up with the act and pretends to be surprised. A basketball game is later held at Marc's urging, but Allan and Bry argue in the middle of the game, involving Cha and Dex in the process and causing their father to bring out knives to cause them to stop fighting.\n\nManuel expresses disappointment to his Jun. Jun then asks his cousins to get along, even if they have to pretend. The next day, the siblings pretend to get along but however, they could not agree on how to bring their father to the funeral parlor. Manuel tells them to prepare an advanced eulogy, causing an awkward moment and prompting his children to finally agree on something.\n\nWhile at the family household; Bry, Cha, and Dex get to talk about their past selves and there Manuel receives a call from the doctor that he was misdiagnosed and that he simply had tuberculosis. Manuel does not disclose the news to his children, fearing that they will abandon him again.\n\nThe next Sunday, the family goes to the beach. Manuel shows an unusual amount of vigor, causing his children to be suspicious of his true medical condition. Manuel shows his family a game wherein he picks out a letter from the old Rebisco can and the siblings have to guess who wrote the letter. This causes the siblings to realize how distant they have become over the years.\n\nDex stays with his father and buys ice cream together at Allan's store. While confronting Mr. Kim, Manuel realizes Allan's financial situation. Dex hides again from those who are chasing him by asking Camille to mislead them.

While at it, Manuel calls his Bry to help Allan regarding his financial situation.\n\nBry arrives at the household and gives financial assistance to Allan. In turn, Allan helps Bry open up about Juliana, who turns out to be the mother to his child, Gian, and helps him contact her and Gian. The next day, after Bechay's medical check-up, Dr. Nelson tells Allan and Bechay the truth about Manuel's condition, causing Allan to confront his father and Manuel to explain his coverup.\n\nOne evening, as the family prepares for dinner, Dex confronts Cha about what actually happened to Jerry and overhears the conversation between his father and Jun about his true medical condition. Bry gets a call from a fellow lawyer about what Dex allegedly did during the botched concert. This causes Bry to confront Dex and leads to the siblings fighting each other verbally because of their shortcomings. Because of this, the siblings leave as Manuel laments about what transpired.\n\nThe next day, Cha evicts her husband; Allan returns to his store; Dex returns to his old room and Bry receives a message from Juliana. Allan laments about the state of his incomplete house; however, his son tells him about what he feels about his father, causing Allan to make amends to Bry and find the other siblings. The siblings help Bry meet Juliana and Gian.\n\nThe siblings then go to the cemetery where their late mother is buried. They see their father talking to her grave, lamenting about how he felt like a failure in being a father. The siblings say their promised eulogy to their still-living father and make a loving embrace.\n\nThe movie ends with Allan's store being relaunched while Mr. Kim's brother arrives for his store's groundbreaking, causing both sides to taunt each other and challenging the family to a dance showdown, with Mr. Kim's brother losing to the family.\n\nRonaldo Valdez as Capt.
