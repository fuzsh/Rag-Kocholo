        "text": "Tyler Perry is steering into the FAST lane. The mega producer is launching multiple FAST (free, ad-supported television) channels as part of its ongoing relationship with BET.\n\nPerry’s library of BET series will be scheduled on the new just-launched channels BET Tyler Perry Comedy and BET Tyler Perry Drama, marking the first time Perry’s BET series have been made available on FAST channels. The outlets are set to launch on FAST platforms including Roku, Pluto TV, Plex, TCL, Freevee and more to come.\n\nThe Perry BET library reps more than 600 hours of series, including “Tyler Perry’s Sistas,” “Tyler Perry’s The Oval,” “Tyler Perry’s House of Payne,” “Tyler Perry’s Ruthless,” “Tyler Perry’s Zatima,” “Tyler Perry’s Assisted Living” and “All the Queens Men.” The channels will launch with marathons of those shows, as well as best-of highlights and cast conversations.\n\nShows set to be added at another date include “Tyler Perry’s Meet The Browns,” “Tyler Perry’s The Haves and The Have Nots,” “Tyler Perry’s For Better or Worse,” and “Tyler Perry’s Too Close To Home.”\n\n“The introduction of Perry’s content to FAST channels is a momentous occasion in our partnership,” said Louis Carr, president of media sales at BET Media Group. “We’re thrilled to provide Black audiences with a fresh avenue to enjoy Tyler Perry’s content and offer more access options for our original programming.”\n\nBET announced in January at the CES convention in Las Vegas that its library of Tyler Perry original series will be made available for licensing and syndication by third-party platforms, including SVOD, AVOD, FAST and broadcast.\n\nIn April, Perry struck a new multi-year deal with BET Media Group that included the renewal of eight of his shows for BET and its BET+ streamer. BET also ordered another new scripted series from Perry, “Route 187.”\n\nAmong the shows that were renewed under that new content deal were BET’s Tyler Perry’s Sistas” for its eighth season, “Tyler Perry’s The Oval” for Season 6 and “Tyler Perry’s Assisted Living” for a sixth season. Also renewed is “Tyler Perry’s House of Payne” for its sixth season on BET (and 12th overall, having previously run in syndication and TBS). The deal additionally included new seasons of BET+ series “Tyler Perry’s Zatima,” “Tyler Perry’s Ruthless,” Tyler Perry’s Bruh” and “All The Queen’s Men.”\n\nEarlier this month, Perry expressed support for a plan by BET CEO Scott Mills, who is part of a group looking to potentially buy the company from Paramount Global. “I’m a huge fan of Scott and if this is a deal that he can work out and make happen, I’m 100% supportive,” Perry said. “Between Shari Redstone and him, they’re the reason that I’m here. They’ve been fantastic to work with. I love working with Scott every day, and I will continue to work with him wherever in whatever capacity he is in.”\n\nHere’s a first look at the Tyler Perry FAST channels:"
