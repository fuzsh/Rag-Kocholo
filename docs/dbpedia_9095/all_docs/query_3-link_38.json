        "meta_description": "The chapter provides an annotated translation of the anonymous Latin work known to historians of Spain as the Historia Roderici or &apos;History of Rodrigo&apos; (HR). It has a claim to be regarded as one of the earliest biographies of a layman who was not a king to have been composed in medieval Christendom. The Rodrigo DÃ­az whom it commemorates was an eleventh-century Castilian nobleman who enjoyed a strikingly successful career as a military adventurer. He is better known to posterity as El Cid. Rodrigo&apos;s truly remarkable career was made possible by the distinctive circumstances of his age: the instability of the Taifa principalities; the acceptability of tribute-taking as the primary mode of Christian-Islamic relationship in Spain; and the availability of mercenary knights. Skilful exploitation by diplomacy and force of the fractious Taifa principalities enabled him to become a tribute-taker on a princely scale.",
