        "text": "This study correlates the results obtained from the resistivity and spontaneous potential well logs in six boreholes for water extraction, located in the multilayer siliciclastic basin in the Madrid region, in the center of the Iberian Peninsula. Given the small lateral continuity that the layers considered in isolation show in this type of multilayer aquifer, geophysical stretches, with their corresponding average lithological assignments, have been established to achieve this objective from the well logs. These stretches allow for mapping the internal lithology in the studied area, obtaining a correlation of greater geological scope than that provided by the correlation between layers. Subsequently, the possible correlation of the lithological stretches selected in each of the boreholes was analyzed, verifying their lateral continuity and establishing an NNW-SSE section in the study area. In this work, the transcendence of the correlation of wells up to great distances (about 8 km...\n\nSatellite thematic maps in geological field studies are an important tool for the delineation, interpretation, representation, and visualization of geological processes, while the development of seismic sections offers an increasingly detailed analysis of subsurface geology and inferring and understanding the subsurface structure of the earth. This combination promoted a fast-growing research in the fields of morphotectonics and neotectonics. The area under investigation is one of the most significant Iraqi places which includes several oil fields. The study area is located in northern Iraq and administratively follows Kirkuk governorate. Landscapes in this area are characterized by asymmetrical, cylindrical and extended folds. Kirkuk, Bai-Hasan and Qarachuq Anticlines reflect these structural elements and their fold axis trends towards northwest-southeast within the Zagros folded zone. The main objective of this study is to use the visual and digital interpretation of Landsat image to discriminate the sudden breaks and omissions of rock beds in the study area. Therefore, a morphotectonic map was created, the accurate location of the sudden breaks was provided and the zones affected by tectonic deformation, which left its imprint on the successive lithological units were detected. Seismic data were used to assess the tectonic impact on subsurface formations and their reflections on exposure rocks. The seismic lines were selected based on the locations of the identified sudden breaks as interpreted from satellite images. The hypothesis derived from this study is that the sudden breaks in the study area were triggered by a series of faults. In addition, the region was affected by the vertical stresses resulting from these faults and morphological aspects of the region were determined by the temporal variations of the above stresses.\n\nA B S T R A C T The Grote Brogel Fault (GBF) is a major WNW-ESE striking normal fault in Belgium that diverges westward from the NW-SE striking western border fault system of the Roer Valley Graben. The GBF delimits the topographically higher Campine Block from the subsiding Roer Valley Graben, and is expressed in the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) by relief gradients or scarps. By integrating DTM, Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), Cone Penetration Test (CPT) and borehole data, we studied the Quaternary activity of the GBF and its effects on local hydrogeology. In the shallow subsurface (< 50 m) underneath these scarps, fault splays of the GBF were interpreted on newly acquired ERT profiles at two investigation sites: one on the eastern section and the other on the western section, near the limit of the visible surface trace of the fault. Borehole and CPT data enabled stratigraphic interpretations of the ERT profiles and thereby allowed measuring vertical fault offsets at the base of Pleistocene fluvial deposits of up to 12 m. Groundwater measurements in the boreholes and CPTs indicate that the GBF acts as a hydrologic boundary that prevents groundwater flow from the elevated footwall towards the hangingwall, resulting in hydraulic head differences of up to 12.7 m. For the two investigation sites, the hydraulic head changes correlate with the relief gradient, which in turn correlates with the Quaternary vertical offset of the GBF. ERT profiles at the eastern site also revealed a local soft-linked stepover in the shallow sub-surface, which affects groundwater levels in the different fault blocks, and illustrates the complex small-scale geometry of the GBF.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to determine the effectiveness of cross association in detecting the similarity between correlated geological colum- nar sections. For this purpose, cross association is used to compare several geological columnar sections which are arbitrarily selected from different lo- calities in central and north Jordan. It turns out, for most of the study cases, that the sections which consist of the same rock units (formations) are statistically classified as similar (p-value � .05), while sections of differ- ent rock units (formations) are statistically classified as dissimilar (p-value � .05). Geologists get used to study rocks in outcrops or in drill cores. A sequence of sedimentary rocks may be divided up into a number of lithostratigraphical units usually of various sizes. Superimposed lithostratigraphical units are frequently distinguished from each other based on lithological properties and stratigraphical position. The formation is the fundamental unit of stra..."
