Producing crystal devoid of intricate cutting is quite simple. Producing itwithoutany flaws is an entirely different matter. What determines the quality and integrity of a fine piece of crystal is not just the design. It's the lawlessness of the crystal itself that separates the exemplary from the garden variety. At one end of the spectrum we find crystal so flawed that it doesn't warrant dis- cussion. F6r removed from mediocrity, we next approach crystal that is intricately cut. While this is a worthy form of art, it is often used to mask all types of imperfections. At the opposite end of the spectrum we find crystal that is virtually flawless. Crystal that is by far the most difficult to produce. Like Orrefors' extraordinary Regina Bowl. Designed with immense pride by the inimitable Olle Alberius, it repre- sents a level of excellence that has persisted for over 250 years at the Orrefors factory in Sweden. Of course, achieving such purity and clarity is an agonizing feat. In fact, seven out of ten bowls do not survive the intense scrutiny of Orrefors' quality control. If you are fortunate enough to exam- ine a Regina bowl you'll see that it holds far more than the deepest secrets of the crystal makers' art. What it really holds is your imagination.

E Some people have a talent for travel. They look upon travelling as a fine art. These true connoisseurs require the best. It is for them that the Louis Vuitton craftsmen create luggage and maintain the tradition of custom-making. Louis Vuitton craftsmen possess the se- cret of utilising traditional craftsmanship in new guises without any sacrifice in the stan- dards of workmanship. They have the knack of inventing new grain finishes and discover- ing innovative colours. Both old and new working materials are meticulously selected. Louis Vuitton offers fresh ideas for new desti- nations. The Louis Vuitton initials authenticate the concept perpetuated by the company since 1854.

MAR1E ANTOlNETTE D,NNER SERV,CE BY ^^ ^ ^^ ^^ V| H* Li em m P The truth is, most German cars are a lot better at handling the Autobahn than they are at handling the human body. One luxurious exception is the Scorpio touring sedan. Built in Koln, West Germany, Scorpio performs with an over-the-road discipline befitting its European heritage. Yet it balances that performance with a cabin environment which indulges its occupants in space and comfort and tasteful design. The result is what ROAD & TRACK calls the Best Sedan under $27,500 in the world/ Perhaps the most striking evidence of Scorpio's respect for passengers is in the rear compartment Here, legs may stretch out in over 38 inches of legroom (nearly eight inches more than Mercedes 190). Backs and shoulders can ease themselves onto Connolly leather upholstery. And, with a mere flick of the wrist rear seatbacks may be /Hmw-reclined, allowing your companions to relax in what AUTOMOBILE MAGAZINE suggests may be \"the most comfortable seats in the industry.\" Naturally, the Scorpio driver's happiness is equally well attended to, in a driver's seat that is a paragon of both ergonomics and thoughtfulness. But what he or she should find most comforting of all is the sense of power to be derived from Scorpio's 2.9-liter V-6 engine. Its multi-port electronic fuel injection and twin-throttle design deliver a wide torque band— for smooth, fluid performance in both city and highway situations. Meanwhile, Scorpio's fully independent suspension and anti-lock braking system (ABS) help manage the road through the hard corners and the hardest of stops. But even with all this, some owners have admitted there is one activity they occasionally prefer to sitting behind the wheel of a Scorpio: sitting behind the driver of a Scorpio. -selected from cars sou m the us IMPORTS) FRCM 6BMARY FOfi SflfCT UiCOUt-ttSKURY DEALBS. SCORPIO T T Negotiating the twists and turns of the Black Forest comes naturally to most German sports coupes. Negotiating the twists and turns of the driver, alas, does not. Happily, the turbocharged XR4Ti coupe was engineered to be the master of both terrains. On the road, XR4Ti sprints from zero to 60 in just 7.8 seconds. Credit goes to a fuel-injected, overhead- cam 4-cylinder engine that uses a Garrett turbocharger to deliver more power than many engines with twice the displacement and double the cylinders. Add to this XR4Ti's fully independent suspension and low-profile Pirelli P6s. and the result is a vehicle with the taut feel and spirited reflexes you expect from a true European performer. What you may not expect is XR4Ti's devotion to driver comfort and ease of movement. With anatomically designed front seats that help keep you firmly in place. Lumbar supports that adjust to your dimensions. And a clean, no-nonsense presentation of analog gauges, controls, and power conveniences. All carefully positioned to maximize your command over XR4Ti's 175 horsepower. The XR4Ti coupe from Germany. Performance that sends a chill up your spine. Without putting an ache in your back.

The Perpetual Calendar in 18 k. gold with ultra-thin automatic mc Our fascination with the measurement of time is legendary. And yet, we were not the first to unravel the mystery. Over one thousand years ago the Mayas were already seeking accurate ways to determine its course. By patiently observing the alternation of day and night, and carefully charting the flight of moon and stars across the heavens, they were able to establish a calendar as precise as our own. Without the benefit of telescope or opti- cal instrument, they developed a mechanism as perfect, in its own way, as the Perpetual Calendar. With the same fascination and patient attention to detail of the Mayas before them, the master-watch- makers at Audemars Piguet hand-carve, chisel and polish each intricate spring, tiny pivot and delicate pinion, destined to form the Perpetual Calendar. They create a balance so perfect that only the grea- test of craftsmen could aspire to it. A watch pro- grammed with such a complex mechanism that leap years are accounted for, keeping perfect time, untouched, until the year 2100. In today's hectic world, only Audemars Piguet could have pioneered the recreation of an authen- tic classic, for the sole pleasure of the few who can afford to contemplate time. After all, from the 20-day month of the Mayas, to the Perpetual Calendar of our master-watchmakers, the chal- lenge to harnass the evolution of time remains unchanged.

Liz Claiborne The F ragrance I o a s CONNOISSEUR'S WORLD MY EYE by Thomas Hoving Those Qood Old Blankets There's good news tor those of ib who have occasional pangs of insecurity. Recently .1 group of distinguished psychoanalysts announced thai keeping \"security blankets\" through- our \\our whole lite can be beneficial to your health — better, even, than that now- ramous aspirin regimen. Normally 1 shrug oft such august pronouncements with skepticism, but this one got me: I'd been a secret blanket user tor \\c.irs. The gtxvl doctors listed ten \"most popu- lar security blankets,\" including such calming and reassuring things as \"talking to oneself, \"watching TV, eating, reading, listening to music, a favorite walk, a mem- ory, someone special, and a prayer, and suggested that you make a list ot yours. My list had not only well-worn blankets in the top ten categories but drawers hill of new ones. If one's insecurities are in proportion to one's blankets, this was revealing. A walk. Rome. The nirvana of walks, a mystery story of time revealed with every step. You can walk from Sabine and Oscan times to today in a couple of hours. A memory. Bittersweet: those heady years I was driven, humiliated, and cursed at in the United States Marine Corps. Sweet: all those times I learned I had passed the examination after all. TV. \"Star Trek\" — the golden oldie. The Olympics and the Super Bowl. PBS (most of the time), especially Bleak House, for the most satisfying acting ever on TV. And one more, Jason Robards in The Ice- man Cometh. Music. I'd take the complete works of Richard Wagner (the absolute pinnacle of recordings on CD). Followed closely by the entirety of Mozart. Also, bel canto — Norma, Lucia di Lammermoor — and, for the sentimental blanket, Rosenkavalier. Eating. Dinner at Taillevent, in Paris. Otherwise, spaghetti, almost any kind. The Taillevent menu: ( 1 ) cassolette de MAY NS»K langoustines; (2) panache de foiegras; (3) asperges .111 jusde truffe; (4) supreme de bai an gros sel; (5) noisettes de chevreuil; (6) canette sauvage; (7) cotelettes au persil; (8) ( arre d'agneau; (9) fromagesj ( 10) des- sert. Reading. Sh.1kespe.1re. Catch'22, which I've read seven tunes and haven't begun to find the real subtleties in. And ( Ksscs — the James (oyce one. Trie <- 'am bridge Ancient History, volumes 1-12. The Bible, and Connoisseur, natch. Those fulfilled the doctors' \"most popu- lar'' categories. Bur 1 had .1 Just tull ot other vital \"security blankets.\" Without them, I'd go to pieces. Art. The most profound, perfect, excit- ing, and moving work of art is, as every- body knows, The Adoration of the Mystic Lqmfr, by Jan and Hubert van Eyck, in the cathedral of Saint Bavo, in Ghent, Bel- gium. Second \"art blanket\" would be the Resurrection by Piero della Francesca, up there in that tiny civic museum in Borgo San Sepolcro. For a more modern \"com- forter,\" I'd contemplate Las Menmos, by Diego Velazquez. For today? Picasso's Guernica, inexplicably as profound — and utterly comforting — as the van Eyck. Wine. Must have wine. For white, Pierre Ramonet's Montrachet. For red, a 1957 Petrus. Champagne? Krug 1982. Bed. (How could the psychoanalysts miss that one?) My \"Hollywood\" king-size Simmons, purchased in San Diego in 1955. Still perfect. Architecture. Drop me into the Pan- theon when it's snowing. Oi course, the pyramids at 2:00 A.M. under a full moon don't exactly jangle the nerves. And FLIW's Fallingwater, almost any time. Landscape. Easy. The Li River near Gulin, in China. After that, the gorgeous, verdant hills of Quaker Hill, in Pawling, New York, where I've got a cottage. Pet. My lapdog, Liza, seven pounds of half Maltese, halfYorkie. Expert opinion. Morris Abram, lawyer, sage, libertarian; Senator Pat Moynihan, \"complicator\"; Robert Wilson, superin- telligence; Jack Lenor Larsen, best \"eye\" in America; Howard Sloan, entrepreneur and raconteur; Felix Rohatyn, \"king of candor\"; and, ol course, my bullheaded, infallible self. i larden.

High technology. My home-built air- plane, a two-seater, canard-winged Falcon X-P (which has a built-in parachute and cannot stall, spin, or go faster than ninety miles an hour, even in a dive). Higher technology. Swiss army knife — with scissors, tweezers, pliers, and screw- driver for quick eyeglasses repair. Highest technology. My Psion pocket computer-word processor, on which 1 write everything from editorial calendars to my next novel. Sport. A unique ski run in the spring, the Grosses Stierloch, from Ziirs-am-Arl- berg down to Zug, Austria (ending with a Bloody Mary at the Rote Wand). Someone else. Easy. My business part- ner for ten years — and my wife of thirty- five years — who, even in the heat of argu- ment, never fails to calm and comfort me (about an hour later). Basic. A cool, pure glass of water. One of the most calming and comforting natu- ral things 1 can think of. Fast food. A Macoun apple. Prayer. That my \"security blankets\" will comfort me for a long time. □ MAY 1988 35 Harlem? Harlem ! Dance Theatre of Harlem, America's extraordinary ambassador, represents the U.S. in a tour of the Soviet Union. It was the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. that jolted Arthur Mitchell, a leading dancer of the New York City Ballet, into a personal commitment to do whatever he could, wherever he could, to help his people. The fact that the only thing he could do was teach ballet and that the only place he could afford was the basement of a Harlem church didn't discourage him. His pupils were kids from the Harlem streets, and his lessons were tough and uncompromising. To kids who thought that drugs were \"cool,\" he taught the need for iron discipline over mind and body. To those who dreamed of quick fame and easy money, he taught the virtues of sweat and hard work. Along the way. he taught them grace and beauty and pride in themselves. The result has been electrifying: a dance company that has fused the sophisticated elegance of ballet with the real-world emotion and vitality of Harlem. In the dance capitals of the world, they rate standing ovations and have become some of America's finest ambassadors. This year they were selected to represent the U.S. in the President's Special Cultural Exchange Initiative with the Soviet Union. We started supporting the Dance Theatre of Harlem some thirteen years ago. We thought they had a message for us and for all American businessmen — and maybe the Soviets can profit from it, too. We think it should be called \"Mitchell's Law\"— if you want to change your world, or your country, or just your business, the way to begin is by ignoring all excuses for doing nothing, and start doing whatever you can. wherever you can.

CONNOISSEUR'S WORLD Ten meters under the Rue Pierre Nicole, Patrick Saletta may have rediscovered the oldest chapel in Paris Paris Underground It's dark, it's damp, and, strictly speaking, it's illegal. But a whole lot of young people have given a whole new meaning to the word \"underground\" by exploring and partying in the labyrinth of subterranean passages, disused quarries, sewers, and cat- acombs that riddles the subsoil of Paris. And the pioneer of the underground, Pat- rick Saletta, has made some spectacular discoveries. When the twenty-four-year-old Swed- ish-born Parisian wandered into a quarry eight years ago equipped with only a can- dle, he got lost for seventeen hours, fright- ened himself nearly to death, and went back for more. \"A lot of people go under- ground to get a kick out of the tear inspired by being in a completely unknown world,\" he says. \"You're twenty meters from the surface and all you can hear is the occa- sional rumble ot a Metro tram or the taint noise ot traffic overhead. Time no longer exists; it's incredible, like a drug.\" Soon hooked, Saletta, who now work- in advertising, started popping under- ground to explore Paris's 1,250 kilometers of sewers and 200 miles ot stone-quarry galleries, not to mention cellars, crypts and reservoirs, and thousands ot miles ot passages used by electricity and telephone authorities. Saletta rapidly abandoned his candle tor an acetylene lamp, protective clothing, and stout boot.- and uncovered some sur- prises. Underneath the Senate, a Nazi headquarters during the war, he found bunkers daubed with German graffiti. He also claims to have -tumbled on atomic -helters built tor France- mini-trie- and equipped with oxygen canisters, I -tore-, ventilation systems, and generators but won't say where tor tear ot vexing mil- itary authorities. One ot his most important rind- 1- a di-- used chapel ten meters under the Rue Pierre Nicole near the Luxembourg Gar- den-, accessible via an underground pas- now used tor trash can- in a modern apartment building. Saletta, who ha- re- -earched the practically unknown chapel tor a forthcoming book on Paris's under- ground, think- it was built around A.D. 500, rebuilt in 1220, and restored in Saletta and a photographer friend, Frederic Raynaud, also found an under- ground entrance to a magnificent tour- teenth-centurv vaulted cellar underneath what is now a tire station, near the Boule- vard Saint-Germain, on the Left Bank. Saletta and Raynaud have had their share ot subterranean surprises. They once resur- faced in a fourteenth arrondissement po- lice station. Raynaud was particularly im- pressed to find himself one day clambering over a mas- of skeletons reburied in cata- combs in the south of Pans between 1786 and IS Vs*. when the city's overflowing cemeteries were emptied. Catophilia pay dirt: a fourteenth-century cellar. The carver of this painted wood-and-shell sculpture had more than fillet o' fish in mind. Collected in 1 909 from the island of New Ireland, 400 miles from New Guinea, the fearsome creature may have originally held a small human figure in its mouth and been brandished in ceremonial dances; note the license taken with the fish's bones, carved in a radiating pattern in resemblance of a palm frond. The man-eating fish and forty-six other carvings from this South Pacific island are on display in the exhibition \"Assemblage of Spirits: Idea and Image in New Ireland.\" Organized by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, it is at the Brooklyn Museum until May 9; then, from June 1 1 to September 4, at the Kimbell Art Museum, in Fort Worth; and from October 8 to January 29, 1989, at the De Young Museum, in San Francisco.

He canceled the exhibi- tions that Simon, the director, had planned and indefinitely postponed the opening ot his new, namesake contempo- rary-art museum in SoHo. She promptly resigned. It was then that Simon witnessed her new career rise Thoenix-like from the ashes ot the ill-fated Broida. She was soon being courted by other institutions and asked to organize shows and to write and produce catalogs. Perhaps her most im- pressive offer was to become director of the Des Momes Art Center, which had just lost its director. What Simon soon recog- nized was that she wanted the freedom to do all these things and a few other things besides. She transformed herself into Joan Si- mon, Inc., a corporation offering indepen- dent administrative, curatorial, and pub- \"YOU DON'T HAVE TO FLATTER THE TRUSTEES.\" lishing services; her clients now include foundations, book publishers, and alterna- tive spaces as well as museums. Instead of accepting the position as director of the Des Moines Art Center, Simon carved out a role as interim director and head curator. In less than six months, working from her base in New York City and traveling regu- larly to Des Moines, she programmed two years of exhibitions, originated the first museum exhibition of Jenny Holzer's elec- tronic signs, produced the catalog, and planned a national tour for it. \"I love solving problems,\" Simon says, thinking back on the Des Moines experi- ence. \"I came to museum directing from nine years as managing editor of Art in Saint Louis Crystal.

To the rare-book dealers and miniature-book specialists Anne and Da- vid Bromer, of Bromer Booksellers ir ton, they are — wink, wink — \"only a small part of our business.\" Miniature-book lov- ers and collectors seem to pursue their interest in dogged seriousness and to dis- j cuss it with appropriate whimsy. \"I started collecting miniature books at the time mv wite began to comment about the bur- geoning collections which were claiming every bit of free space in the house,\" once wrote the Texas retailing whir Stanley Marcus. \"I figured I could smuggle in five miniature books without detection.\" His collection eventually grew to about i volumes, hard to hide from a disapproving : spouse even though thev were at Lillipu- tian scale. Coy disclaimers notwithstanding, the Bromers count upwards oi a thousand vol- umes in their library of miniatures. Two years ago they commissioned miniature books from thirty-four of the world's greatest bookbinders, including Brugalla of Spain and Lobstein of Paris. These top- caliber binders unflinchingly braved the challenge of working with tools the si:e of toothpicks and silver-dollar-si:e bits oi su- perb leathers, creating exquisite one-of-a- kind miniatures. The bindings displayed everything from gold tracery and embroi- dery patterns to mother-of-pearl and sand from no less a quarry than Walden Pond. The largest volume in the collection mea- sured just under four inches; the most topi- cal books were volumes devoted to the putative Shakespeare sonnet \"Shall I Die? Shall I Fly?,\" discovered at Oxford in 1985. These ornate objects of bibliophilic desire were snapped up in tow by a major New York collector. Miniatures didn't use to be so ostenta- tiously, charmingly superfluous. Six- teenth-centurv monks and nuns traveled with tinv Psalters and prayer books. Much later, for the pious laitv. there would be three-and-a-half-bv-one-inch \"finger\" editions of the Bible. A seventeenth-cen- turv gentleman might tuck one ot the Company of Stationers' tamed engraved London Almanacks into his waistcoat for readv reference. Flirtatious French demi- mondaines would commission highly dec- orative, luxurious volumes of erotic poetry bound in gold-stamped Morocco (with handy mirrored inside pockets for quick beautv-patch checks ).

Vial, whose Comite International pour la Sauvegarde de Ye- nise has been helping to shore up Venice's endangered monuments, has now set his sights on the Grande Muraille as well. He has organized something called \"The Re- turn of Marco Polo,\" which amounts to a . _ narity blowout under the shadow oi the Great Wall — three davs of exceptional tetes in earlv June around the great monu- ments oi ancient Peking. A pnvate per- formance by the Beijing Opera, a cocktail reception staged bv Maxim's on the Great Wall itself, and a masked ball in the mid- dle of the Forbidden City are some oi the featured amusements. The monev-raising bash ends with an auction featuring works bv such well-known artists as Sandro Chia, Sol Lewitt, Keith Haring, and Zao Wou Kv. Conducted bv Sotheby's, the auction should. Vial hopes, net about a quarter oi a million dollars. At the actual restoration cost oi : X©-$4 X D per foot, the auction alone could allow the refurbishing ot at least eighty-three feet oi the 1 . 500-mile-long Great Wall. UNESCO will oversee the financing, channeling funds into local commissions that will implement the actual work.

In Dublin, Ireland, the municipal-planning body called the Dublin Corporation has— on similar road-clearing pretexts— been decimating \"The Liber- ties,\" one of the oldest, most historic districts in the city. And now, most recently, in Omaha, Nebraska, the city council has given its okoy to the destruction of the largest national historic site on record. The victim in this case is a Victorian-revival warehouse district on the edge of the Missouri River. It seems that ConAgra Inc., a $9 billion agribusiness concern — and one of the larg- est employers in the area — threatened to pull up stakes and build its new headquarters elsewhere, unless the nearby warehouse district was leveled. Why? So that the folks at the new ConAgra facilities could enjoy a better view. Of what? Of downtown Omaha. Cineplex Odious The multiplexing of America has sliced and diced our great movie palaces into movie minimarts. What was Grauman's Chinese Theater is now a triplex. The Cine- plex Odeon theater at Universal Studios, Universal City, the largest in the country, has enough minithe- aters (eighteen) to make you feel as if you're at an airport looking up to check your gate and departure time. Movies are bad enough as it is; now we're asked to tolerate watching the few good ones in sweat-box surroundings without a troce of charm, much less magic. Uncomplainingly accepted by a video genera- tion that is olreody occustomed to postoge-stamp screens and distorted formats the scaling-down of the theatrical moviegoing experience is unfortunately here to stay. Taxing Hie Imagination Remember the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which was supposed to turn your springtime fongo with the IRS into a brisk two-step? We don t know about its effect on you, but for artists the act has turned into one big pain in the tax, and — for thousands of would-be artists — into a steel door slomming shut on the future. The TRA requires among other things that \"creative persons' now must show a profit in three out of five consecutive years it used to be two in order to be allowed to deduct expenses on their art making, and that deduc- tions may be allowed only on works that are sold (in other words, make twenty paintings, sell two, and you get to deduct expenses on only the two . Aside from the expenses and the hillocks of new forms these measures create, the law means that a whole generation with fledgling creative aspirations is finding it extremely difficult to survive as artists. The well-established ones simply have to pay more. Lobbying efforts are now being mounted to amend these shortsighted \"re- forms.\" Doing the Vatican Rag The Vatican surely must have bigger fish to fry than Italy's classical musicians. Citing instances of indecor- ous activity (one musicol act allegedly had featured nude dancing on the altar), Cardinal Ugo Poletti of the Rome diocese last fall effectively banned musical per- formances from Italian churches, unless they were for purely liturgical purposes. This throws a question mark over the future of classical-music events in a country seriously short on regulation performance spoces— not to mention the future of classical musicians olready scraping by [paid performances are strictly out).

Attack of Hie Microwaves The epidemic of listless food wreaked by microwave cooking grows and grows. Champion at eye-blink feats of defrosting, boiling water, and curdling eggs into an acceptable scramble, the time-saving machines— which cook from the inside out— wilt foodstuffs into submis- sion, doing away with anything resembling crispness, crunchiness, and the other surface textures that give food much of its appeal. To the almost ubiquitous machine itself, add the plethora of plastic-pouched \"entrees\" and other microwave-specific frozen digesti- bles — and, most recently, the blessings and encourage- ment of food gurus Barbara Kafka has just put out a book on microwave cooking} — and you have the mak- ings of, as they say, \"a revolution\" in eating.

HartV wife (Linda Fiorentino), who ran away from him vears aso in Chicago, rums up one Kkcv afterncxm in his favorite cafe, hitched to a Chinese art collector (John Lone) who made his fortune by inventing the first reallv effective prophv- lactic. Hart's attempts to get her back have an impulsive, fated qualirv; he's miserable around her, but he's pulled toward recon- ciliation like a wide-eved somnambulist. Rudolph does have a tew things on his mind here: he wants to show us how these expatriates were precursors of not only the artistic radicalism ot the modern era but also its flim-flammerv. John Lone's art col- lector— named, symbolically, Stone, as opposed to Carradine's Hart — points to one ot his paintings midway through the movie and proudlv announces, \"This is art because I paid hard cash for it\" — words meant to resonate with a premonitory tin- John Lone, Linda Fiorentino, and Keith Carradine take their ambitions to art in Rudolph's The Modems. The Moderns doesn't tell us much about expatriate Americans in Paris in 1926. but it certainlv gives us an eveful from the director Alan Rudolph's mindscape. He has airlifted intact his floating crap game ot characters and conceits to Gallic Bo- hemia. It's Choose We all over again, only this time the accents within earshot are French, and instead ot Pop art on the stu- dio walls we have canvases ot Cezanne, Matisse, and Tica-- Rudolph has wanted to make a mo\\ le about American expatriate artists in twen- ties France tor over twelve vears; but tor all its deep-think tolderol, this film doesn't have the curdled, clogged-arterv quality ot most \"dream\" projects that have outlasted their incubation periods. Rudolph's dream-walk stylistics may at first seem fluffy and insubstantial, but they have the force ot poetic obsession behind them — this will-o'-the-wisp artist has a cast-iron constitution. Keith Carradine plays N'ick Hart, a scrounging painter and forger who draws cartoon caricatures tor the newspaper gos- gle through the galleries ot our minds. Thev're the lingo ot \"Hollvwood meets Wall Street.\" What we take away from this film, though, are not so much Ru- dolph's musings as his ethereal film sense, his gift tor turning his people into objects tor serene contemplation. Keith Carra- dine is lighted and photographed with such devotional exactness that his West- ern good looks begin to seem archetypal. John Lone, by contrast, is so shiny-sleek that his skin might be made ot moist porce- lain. The real portraiture in this film isn't on museum walls; it's in Rudolph's float- ing, mural-like procession ot human ta- bleaux. — Peter Rainer The China Linen Route Katha Diddel took the slow boat to the bed-linens trade.

It arrayed impeccably feminine rose, muguet, and jasmine elements along- side brawnier stuff like vetiver, moss, and patchouli. You had to be there, perhaps, but such whiffs of manliness in a women's perfume were startling — and addictive, as witnessed by the loyal following Aroma- tics has since maintained.

The packag- ing, inspired by one of Paloma's jewelry designs, was a bold black oval with clear glass at the center. Relying heavily on pat- chouli, vetiver, cedarwood, tabac, and labdanum (lending a warm and ambery tone), the perfume folds these into a big bouquet of bright, verdant florals — rose, hyacinth, jas- mine, and mu- guet. Spicy and herbal notes of co- riander, clove, and angelica also play a part in the scent's strong profile. The most recent version of this hybrid is Halston's Couture. The woody, virile ac- cord in the background is a composite of patchouli, sandalwood, and amber. The kev scent is extracted from bergamot, a fruit grown for perfumery in southern Italy; it imparts freshness and brightness and mixes beautifully with mandarin and ta- jette (reminiscent of marigold stems and leaves) to create a strong, lush top note that diffuses headily. The Couture bottle is a crystal version of the flacon designed in 1975 for the first Halston fragrance. It is for the woman who sits at conference tables wearing dark tailored cashmere suits and stiletto heels and likes a similarly dou- ble message in the air. — Jill Resnick Movable Feast Bouquets of praise tied in ribbons of super- latives have been heaped on Chanterelle since the day the restaurant opened, eight 60 CONNOISSEUR Three can sit as expensively as one.

Last year the establishment, already one of the city's most unusual culinary land- marks, was declared an official monument when the New York Times food critic be- stowed on it the paper's jealously guarded four-star garland, thereby conferring on Chanterelle a status held only by Lutece, Le Bernardin, and the Quilted Giraffe. That's not bad for a ten-table restaurant lodged in a crevice in SoHo's cast-iron canyons, a golden-yellow, inviting candy box of a space that used to house a Spanish luncheonette. But then Chanterelle has, more or less, always been Chanterelle — even the weeks- long waits for a reservation haven't been changed by the batch of fresh laurels. The real story of this singular restaurant is its consistent ability to produce an extraor- dinary dining experience, at the heart of which are the culinary talent of the chef- owner, David Waltuck, and the relaxed, elegant, efficient atmosphere set by the restaurant's hostess (and David's wife), Karen Waltuck. The small (six-entree) menu changes biweekly, except for one or two house spe- cialties and appetizers, notably the seafood sausage wallowing in a beurre blanc pud- dle, its taut skin yielding an exquisitely fla- vored mince of lobster, shrimp, scallop, and pine nuts. So it isn't so much the reg- ular appearance of specific dishes that dis- tinguishes Chanterelle as the exercise of the distinctive Waltuck style, which in- variably delivers a potent one-two combi- nation of supreme simplicity and intense flavor. Supremely adept at sauces and glazes, Waltuck often allies them with quick-seared cuts of meats and seafood. Whether it's an appetizer of limpid squab consomme perfumed with ginger and an- ise, or strips of rare tuna in a pool of bal- samic-vinegar butter, or venison medal- lions in a robust red-wine-based reduction, dishes at Chanterelle tend to form perfect- ly harmonized duets of natural flavor and culinary artifice, the satisfying plainsong of a cut of meat or fish carefully embel- lished with an intense coloratura of sauce. Waltuck will sometimes launch more- operatic orchestrations, such as fowl braised under puff pastry, but his greatest forte is the pure and deceptively simple. The Waltuck touch is as assured with desserts, which run from staples like exotic sorbets and a crisp, buttery apple tart to more dazzling concoctions like a mille- teuille of blood oranges served with cara- mel sauce. The cheese tray, a resplendent assorti lent that offers a good share of exot- ic surprises, is easily among the best in New York. The excel- lent wine list is skewed to high- end vintages and commensu- rately expensive. A tidy little machine of gas- tronomic delights, Chante- relle will move next fall to new quarters, in TriBeCa, at the corner of Hudson and Harrison streets. There the restaurant (like the original, „-,..^ designed by Bill Katz) will be Chanterelle menus by Eric Fischl eft) and Jennifer Bartlett.

Under Construction.- Umda Kasuko ~ After two yean of designing under her own label, Unida Kasuko is becoming a Pans- fashion- insider favorite; her designs have been steadily bought out of the Paris bou- tique she opened last October (54 Rue Etienne Marcel, 75002 Paris; 236-6001). The excitement is over a tailored style that steers between trendiness and classicism. She admires and has drawn from the work of the J apanese young titans Yohj i Yama- tnoto and Rei Kawakubo; like them, she aspires to a pared-down contemporariness. But she creates her own style, starting with sensual fabrics, which is at once more con- structed, tactile, and colorful than the reigning Japanese high-fashion minimal- ism. Kasuko toiled anonymously for fifteen years in French pret-a-porter before she turned into an instant sensation (her cur- rent financial backer, she says, was so struck bv her designs that he offered her a contract within ten minutes of their meet- ing). Her next winter line will maintain her strong vet feminine look. \"It should be very constructed and rather rigid, but with a certain fluidity,\" she says. \"I'm structur- ing yet unstructunng.\" Contradictory as that sounds, it isn't just talk; part of the talent of this bright new force on the Paris fashion scene is her flair for translating such paradox into cloth. — Regan Charles Edited by Robert Knafo CONNOISSEUR Since i mERE has never bei A QUARTZ B TCH A'.DTHER L BE.

OldGUf, lei: 284256 Auctions IME FOR THE BIG PICTURES Will Jasper Johns's 1962 Diver live up to the overripe hype and estimate ($3.5- $4.5 million)? At Christie's New York, May 3. May is the month of picture fever — the strong version of a malady that also strikes in late November and early December. It is the time for beholding high rollers going gaga over great or merely expensive art, and tor the paying of stupefying prices. Each of the last several Mays has seen mighty records set, only to be effortlessly surpassed in the ensuing spring. Needless to say, there were solid, economic reasons for the appear- ance of this peculiar May bug. A seemingly endless supply of top-notch material in a too-liquid economy meant Olympian prices at the top end and merely eye-pop- ping hikes further down the line. While it will work its usual rounds this year, the May bug may for the first time in a long while be encountering severe resis- tance. There are a number of superlative paintings on the block this month, but it should surprise no one it the results of this month's picture sales were to be less than stellar. It may sound nonsensical to make bear- 70 ish predictions after a season that saw the selling of the four most expensive paint- ings of all time. But in the easier-money days, a lot of reallv marginal material by Will a van Gogh sink or soar? New York, May 10 good to great artists saw its way to the sale- rooms, as well as material that could most charitably be called competent, by many lesser lights. There, not infrequently, it brought bids that defied reason and only encouraged more consigning and more bidding, in an apparently endless cycle. There is, as usual, no lack of money out there for first-rate material — but note the results o{ lesser lots in the big Impressionist and modern sales in New York and Lon- don late last year, many of which were sell- ing below estimate, if at all. On the heels of an intense, decade-long euphoria in the auction market — in which Impressionist and modern art, especially, routinely out- did itself- — deflationary self-correction is clearly in the air. All the dark foreshadows notwithstand- ing, the month's picture sales are still remarkable for their astonishing number and variety. There will be spirited elbow- ing between Sotheby's and Christie's for headlines in New York as the superpowers hold major contemporary-art sales. In the CONNOISSEUR Who chose the Hakimian?

Rosenquist. and Twom- blv. The highlight may come in the second session: a Jackson Pollock entitled Search. from 1955 — not quite the characteristic drip work he became famous tor. but just watch it g Christie's, however, may steal its cross- town rival's thunder on May 3. with Jasper Johns's brilliant 1962 five-panel work Dii- ct — certainly a seminal piece in the Johns canon although still overhvped by the Christie's claim that it is \"the most impor- tant painting bv a living artist ever to be auctioned.\" An encyclopedic piece, sum- ming up a number ot important themes and techniques in this period oi Johns's work, it has appeared in even.- major exhi- bition oi the artist's output since 1964- As long as we are touting individual paintings, my personal favorite oi the month is a stunning Pre-Raphaelite work called Truth, by J. B. L. Shaw, in William Doyle Galleries' May 5 sale of modern and European paintings. Dating from 1898, the painting was exhibited shortly thereaf- ter a the Royal Academy, where its un- concealed prurience had the desired shocking effect. Its whereabouts were un- known for forty vears, until it reappeared recently in a private collection in New York. May 10 is the pivotal dav for the power- picture pageants (as with power breakfasts, they're a form of social theater). Sotheby's and Christie's are going one-on-one tor the Impressionist and modern paintings and sculpture crowd. Sotheby's has been on a roll lately with major museum deac- cessions. Recent examples include very successful sales of works bv Heade, Sar- gent, and Joshua Johnson, all for the NXTntnev. For this outing Sotheby's has two very rich and colorful Matisse oils, one from the twenties and one from the forties, consigned bv the Museum of Modern Art. which likelv will fetch about 52 million each. There also are major works b . zanne. Degas. Picasso, and Renoir, among others. However, Chnstie's mav again trump all this with its ace in the hole: van Gogh's portrait (the sitter and her family didn't care tor it at all) of a disconcertingly va- cant Adeline Ravoux, the thirteen-vear- old daughter of the keeper ot Cafe Ravoux. where van Gogh lived in the few months before his death. There are three versions; .!_> >*' * tes Henri Matisse ot the Sotheby's Impressionist and modem sale, May 10. Christie's is guesstimating that this one will fetch more than 515 million. This is less : a crowd-pleaser than the celebrated Irises or Sunflou^ers. which rewrote the record books last year. Among othet things, its fate will be a test of mv opening remarks about the market — will an argu- ably second-rate van Gogh prevail over good judgment and fetch a headline-si:e bundle I Not all the action is in New York, how- ever. On Mav 1 1 . Butterfield 6k Butter- field holds a sale of contemporary art, which will be simulcast in San Francisco and L. A. The interesting presence here is work bv estimable postwat California art- sts such as Ameson, Davis, Graham, Moses, \\ oulkos. and Zajac. There also are two very smart sales on the tenth and eleventh, respectively, of modern British art in London at Phillips and Sotheby's. The latter's is no doubt the stronger of the two, offering two Mun- ningses as well as some very pleasing pic- tutes bv the likes oi Augustus John and Sir Stanley Spencer. At Bonhams' annual event simultaneous with the Roval Horti- cultural Society's Chelsea Flower Show, the evening session will feature the usual lovelv bouquet ot some two hundred still lifes, garden scenes, botanical studies, and so on bv names that likely will trigger more recognition in merrie olde England than elsewhere. New this year is Bonhams' day session at their Chelsea rooms of garden and conservatory furniture and other orna- ments (statuary, benches, planters, urns, and such), an increasingly popular market in all the London houses. — James R.

PUERTO RICO/The Shining Star of the Caribbean HE LIVELY ARTS When lyon opera ballet's cinderella almost turned into a pumpkin by r. m. koster Last year, in January, the Lyon Opera Ballet made its United States debut at New York's City Center. The com- pany's main offering was a wild new version of Cinderel- la, performed to a sound col- lage of music from Sergei Prokofiev's lush score, am- plified heartbeats, murmurs and gurgles from the nursery, and who knows what else. The show was the brainchild of three strong-willed wom- en: Franchise Adret, the troupe's directc; Maguy Marin, a choreographer; and Monserrat Casanova, the set and costume designer. It pre- sents the familiar tale as a romance fringed with anxi- , ety, as if from the perspec- ' tive of a child — a real child, in a topsy-turvy world where grown-ups strut like dolls 3 and robots, and toys routine ly come to life. Every part of the enterprise screamed \"Chutzpa!\" — a provincial company tam- pering with a classic in what ought to be i le of ballet's holy places, George Balan- chine's theater. Since Balanchine's own company moved to Lincoln Center, in 1964, City Center has become a pretty ragtag temple. Good, bad, or indifferent, dance troupes of every stripe vie to show their wares there. The Big Apple, say what you will, is still the dance capital of the world. If you can make it here . . . Any- way, Cendrillon was a hit, and the compa- ny was invited back with fairy-tale speed to dance it again in May. I made the trip with them, and it proved an interesting week. To begin with, the coach turned into a pumpkin: the dancers went on strike. Dance is prehuman. Birds do it, bees do it, et cetera. Humans added a beat, thereby- turning an instinct into an art. The first. It is also the toughest in physical wear and tear. Writers tend to develop cirrhotic New York City, May 1987. Though split in factions, the company smiles for the camera livers. Sculptors, one imagines, smash their thumbs. But dancers punish their entire bodies. Here is Dame Margot Fon- teyn on the subject: \"If the people who find bullfights cruel knew what dancers go through, they wouldn't want to watch bal- let either.\" Franchise Adret agrees: \"C'est un metier de chien!\" And, except at the Nureyev- Baryshnikov level, a poorly paid dog's call- ing too. Most of the Lyons dancers make 7,000 francs a month, about $1,200. But were they striking for a higher salary ? Non! What the dancers demanded, and what the city of Lyons refused to give, was a ten- dollar hike in the New York per diem, a matter of $150 each, $4,200 in grand total. Odd behavior, letting a pittance come between them and a triumphant return to New York. And what about the city fa- thers? They had laid on a gala premiere, with ceremonies to be televised live back to France. And this priceless PR was being forsworn for a trifle! Both sides, in other words, were being French: in aspect raisonnables, in dis- course luades, and in prac- tice pigheaded. Three days before showtime, when the company was due to leave for New York, the city still wasn't paying, and sixteen of the twenty-eight dancers re- fuse J to travel. Adret was vexed but not surprised. The mayor, she understood, viewed the strike as blackmail. She en- dorsed his position. As for the strikers, their minds were slammed shut, and their action had little to do with its avowed purpose. Adret has done it all in the world of ballet: starred in a ballet created tor her by Li- far; served as inspecteur de danse for the French Minis-"
