Helen Crisp has once more taken time out from a demanding job to cast a critical eye over the manuscript and bring to my attention some potentially disastrous howlers. One could not ask for a more supportive and skilful agent than Duncan McAra, and thanks also to Joanna Godfrey at I.B.Tauris for seeing the text through the editing process. The work of the copy-editor is too often taken for granted, so many thanks are due to Alex Middleton for applying his skills to the manuscript. I am indebted to the helpful and friendly staff at the Biblioteca Nacional de España (Spanish National Library) and Hemeroteca Municipal de Madrid (Madrid Newspaper Archive), both world-class research facilities. Anyone who endeavours to write about Madrid, past or present, will find Madrid, villa y corte by Pedro Montoliú, an official ‘Cronista de la Villa’ (‘Chronicler of the City’), one of the most insightful and invaluable accounts of the city’s history. I would also like to thank the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Central Library for making available a badly needed space in which to write in peace and quiet. Of course, none of this would have been possible without the people of Madrid. My gratitude goes to them for providing me with such an extraordinary story, and to these frequently exasperating and always endearing Madrileños, I dedicate this book.\n\nxiii\n\nintroduction\n\nOne could forgive Madrid’s town-hall authorities for failing to observe that 2011 marked the 450th anniversary of the city’s designation as the capital of Spain. My first visit to Madrid came on the heels of the fourth centenary and I do not recall a single event having taken place to commemorate the occasion.1 This is not so surprising, for Madrid is more a way of life than a city, to be accepted rather than commemorated. It is an accident of history, a whim of King Felipe II, with no more legitimate a claim to the title of capital of Spain than Valladolid, Toledo or Sevilla. Perched desolately in the middle of the Castilian plateau, astride the sad little Manzanares River, which not many Madrileños have laid eyes upon, as remote as a place could be from Spain’s historical centres of industry and great ports, Madrid is a village that plays at being a city. ‘Soy hijo de Madrid’ – ‘I’m a native son of Madrid’. This comment came from the driver of a clapped-out and rather dangerous 1950 Citroën Traction Avant taxi, a butane-gas fuel tank bolted to the boot, as we bumped along Calle Serrano on the way into town from the airport, more than 50 years ago. He stated his pedigree with the same bravado as if he had revealed himself to be the Emperor Charles V. ‘Look!’ He pointed with pride to the statue of the pagan goddess Cybele that sits in the city centre, driving a chariot drawn by two lions atop a fountain. ‘Your first view of La Cibeles!’ he proclaimed. The fountain’s proper name is Cibeles – the addition of the definite article represents a singularly Madrileño term of endearment equivalent to the working-class ‘our Maggie’, one indicative of the statue’s exalted status among the city’s people. I was dropped at my hotel in the Puerta del Sol at midday, a punishing July sun beating down on the pavement, to be greeted xv\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nby a deafening, shrill chorus from blind lottery vendors with strips of tickets pinned to their shirts. ‘¡Veinte tiras para hoy – tengo la suerte! ’ (‘Twenty strips for today – I’ve got the winning ticket!’) they shrieked across the square. A one-legged Civil War veteran sat crouched on the pavement and, when I dropped a 50-peseta coin into his outstretched hand, he struggled up on his good leg, propped himself on his crutch and flicked me a smart parade-ground salute. It seems I had given myself away as every inch the country cousin, for I later discovered that my handout to the beggar almost matched the cost of a night’s stay at my hotel. To complete the Goya tableau, two moustachioed members of the Guardia Civil (Civil Guard) in patent-leather hats, their sub-machine guns cradled lovingly in their arms, cast a scrutinising glance in my direction. By late afternoon the temperature had risen to the level of the engine room of the Titanic. Desperate to escape the raging furnace, I strolled across town to the Plaza de la Marina Española and parked myself on a granite bench under the shade of a poplar. Presently there appeared a sight that could have walked off a Buñuel film set. A ragged Gypsy leading a donkey, a dog and a monkey sporting a straw hat positioned his menagerie below the windows of a block of flats and began solemnly, expressionlessly beating on a drum. This was the signal for the dog to leap up onto the donkey, followed by the monkey, which clambered atop the dog. And there they stood in the blistering heat, waiting for someone to appear at the window with a peseta or two – or, what is more likely, to release a barrage of expletives for having the siesta hour interrupted. Madrid’s afternoon siestas and the Gypsy with his bedraggled troupe are things of the past, and one is tempted to ask what there is to celebrate in this congested, noise-bedevilled, air-polluted, in-yourface city. Fair question. However, Madrid has one defining feature and this has remained largely immutable over the years: its people. A few years ago, an English acquaintance of mine returned from having spent a year in Madrid, complaining that it had all been good fun, but that the people he came across did not strike him as very ‘inquisitive’. I would strongly disagree, but nevertheless I reminded him of an incident I once witnessed on a bus in Plaza de Cibeles. xvi\n\nintroduction\n\nAn elderly woman with a stick was having difficulty boarding, so the driver engaged the emergency brake and got off to help her up the step and into a seat before carrying on. It was mid afternoon and people were on their way back to the office, yet I could not fail to notice that none of the passengers rolled their eyes, checked their watches or clucked their tongues. That to me is worth more than any alleged lack of inquisitiveness – and it’s a cause for celebration. I would also celebrate the fact that Madrid remains a very young city in a very old country. In spite of the strains and stresses attendant in a city that is the third largest in the European Union, with nearly 3.5 million inhabitants – 6.5 million, including the greater metropolitan area – Madrid holds fast to its youthful qualities of energy, openness to change and a delightfully presumptuous self-esteem, something expressed in the local proverb ‘de Madrid al cielo’ – once you’ve been to Madrid, the only place to go is heaven. A late-winter afternoon in 2004, more than 40 years after that first encounter with Madrid, found me on a short visit to the capital, walking up the Calle de Alcalá towards the cathedral-like central post office in Cibeles. It was 11 March, a day that was to become one of the most tragic in the city’s history. In the intervening four decades, Spain had moved forward from ruthless dictatorship to drabocracy, dictadura to dictablanda (dura meaning ‘hard’ and blanda meaning ‘soft’), in a popular Spanish play on words of the day, gradually mutating into an embryonic and fully-fledged democracy. Those crucial years of transformation, from the early 1960s to the late 1970s, were a time of stop-start reform, groping in the dark, never knowing for certain where the goalposts stood, and not without their moments of political hilarity. In 1964, the Franco regime choreographed a national jubilee to mark the 25th anniversary of the end of the 1936–39 Civil War. Madrid was festooned with banners proclaiming ‘25 Years of Peace!’ This also coincided with the time Spain began to open its floodgates to mass tourism from abroad. Millions of visitors from the US and Europe flocked to the beaches. These package-holiday sun-seekers returned to Stuttgart, Sacramento and Sheffield with cherry-red shoulders and an affection for tapas and sangría.2 The only problem xvii\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\narose when tour operators began picking up on a common quibble: many holidaymakers expressed disappointment that Spaniards don’t smile. This information was passed on to the Ministry of Information and Tourism and the reaction was one of horror at the thought of the dour, po-faced descendants of Seneca refusing to greet foreign visitors with a broad grin. The reality is that the Spanish, and particularly the Castilians, receive foreigners with courtesy, but few would go out of their way to make themselves ‘typical’ for tourists. The government panicked at the prospect of upsetting the goose that was just beginning to lay the golden egg. In response, street hoardings were swiftly covered with a ‘Smiley’, the hideously grinning image created in 1963 by the US artist Harvey Ball. This was placed above the slogan ‘Sonríe, Por Favor’ (‘Smile, Please’). It was not long before a Madrid satirical magazine displayed on its cover ‘25 Years of Peace’, and, below it, ‘Smile, Please’. The publication was shut down for three months. That was in 1964: by 2004, Spain had enjoyed nearly three decades of genuine peace, as well as media freedom. But with the world convulsed by the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and ferocious wars being waged in Iraq and Afghanistan, the country was to suffer the consequences of its having embraced the causes of its NATO allies. On that afternoon in March, a young man sat slumped on a bench in front of the Café del Círculo de Bellas Artes, sobbing bitterly. His friends tried to comfort him, softly uttering words of reassurance, but it was in vain: his face remained buried in his hands. Then he looked up, his expression contorted with grief, and said in a trembling voice, ‘I have lost my faith in humanity.’ A group of Muslim terrorists with links to al-Qaeda had that morning exploded ten bombs on the city’s commuter-train network, killing 191 people and wounding nearly another 2,000. It was the deadliest terrorist action in Europe since the Lockerbie bombing in 1988. Many of the victims were poor immigrants from Latin America on their way to work from the city’s industrial suburbs. The coordinated attacks, it later emerged, had been carried out in revenge for Spain’s support for the Iraq war. Within hours of the bombings, black crêpe hung from Madrid’s most iconic buildings and an eerie quiet descended on the city’s streets, punctuated by the wail of ambulances and rescue vehicles. The xviii\n\nintroduction\n\nfollowing night, two million people marched to the Atocha railway station, the scene of the worst carnage. The mood in the street was one not so much of anger as of defiance and indignation. The prevailing sentiment among the demonstrators, their heads held high, seemed to be, ‘We are Madrileños and you do not do this to us.’ The tragedy of that day brought to light the Madrileños’ deep humanity and sense of dignity. Among those lying in hospital or the morgue were many illegal immigrants, whose loved ones dared not make enquiries for fear of being expelled from Spain. The ruling right-wing Partido Popular (People’s Party, PP) rose to the occasion by granting automatic Spanish citizenship to relatives of the victims. But then this same government offended the dignity of the city’s people by making a desperate attempt to claim that the attacks had been carried out by the Basque separatist group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (Basque Homeland and Liberty, ETA). A general election had been scheduled for 14 March, three days after the bombings. Prime minister José María Aznar’s designated successor Mariano Rajoy was favoured to win, albeit by a narrow margin. Aznar and his ministers knew that acknowledging Islamist responsibility would jeopardise their chances of winning the election, as the attacks would be perceived as a consequence of the PP taking Spain into the Iraq war, a policy highly unpopular with most Spaniards. Ministers therefore strived furiously to convince the elect­ orate that ETA was behind the bombings. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ana Palacio, even sent instructions to all Spanish diplomats to place the blame on the Basque guerrillas at every opportunity. The government’s ploy backfired. ETA denied any involvement in the atrocities. It was not their style, and everyone knew it. When ETA committed an outrage, they were swift to claim responsibility, almost always through a feverish communiqué sent to a radical Basque newspaper. Equally, when they denied responsibility for an act of barbarity such as this one, it was so. Sometime after the attack a van was discovered near the site of one of the explosions, with a tape of the Quran on the front seat. Then, when an Arabic newspaper in London printed a letter from Islamist extremists claiming responsibility for the xix\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nbombings, the people of Madrid were outraged. They had been lied to, and the government was to pay the inevitable penalty for having attempted to deceive them. On the day of the election, Madrid voted massively against the government. The rest of the country followed suit. The PP was ousted from office and the Partido Socialista Obrero Español (Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party, PSOE) came to power. This book tells the story of a heroic city, which in 1808 led the uprising against Napoleon’s army of occupation and gave the world its first taste of guerrilla warfare. Madrid is a city that in the 1936–39 Civil War held out to the end against General Franco’s troops, suffered constant air raids and shelling for three years and was overrun and captured, but never signed a surrender document. This is a city that in 2004 stood in defiance against the onslaught of Islamist terrorism, and which seven years later, in May 2011, again showed its fighting spirit as the cradle of the worldwide ‘Indignado’ (‘Indignant’) movement.\n\nxx\n\n— 1 — from maŷrīt to madrid\n\nMuhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman knew the attack would come from the north. In the ninth century, the emir of Córdoba was the most powerful ruler in Spain. His dominions stretched across most of the Iberian Peninsula and covered a large swathe of the modern states of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. The emirate of Al-Ándalus, the Arabic name for Andalucía, was a land of splendour in every sense, with its fields of olive groves extending to the horizon, the cooling breeze of the snow-capped Sierra Nevada peaks to the south, and the vast acres of vineyards and orchards, watered by sophisticated irrigation systems imported from North Africa. In 711, the Berber chieftain Tariq ibn Ziyad led an army of 16,000 warriors across the Strait of Gibraltar,1 the narrow body of water that separates Spain from Morocco, taking advantage of a dynastic civil war between Christian Visigoth pretenders, who three centuries earlier had themselves conquered Roman Hispania when that empire began to crumble. The Moors, as the North African invaders were collectively known, displayed a remarkable tolerance towards their new subjects, Christians and Jews alike. Córdoba, the capital of the Arab-Muslim emirate of Al-Ándalus, became a beacon of multicultural enlightenment, a glittering, bustling city of poets, mathematicians, philosophers and musicians. It is estimated that in those days there existed in France some 700 books worthy of the name, while the library of Córdoba, at the peak of its glory, held more than 100,000 volumes. 1\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nFor a brief period, Muslim Spain was the most vibrant spot on earth, a place that saw the magical fusion of commerce, learning and power that put it in the rarefied company of classical Greece, imperial Rome, Han China and Renaissance Italy. The Umayyads, exiled from Damascus, had carved out a kingdom, and Córdoba was the jewel in the crown. The city matched Baghdad as a treasure house of culture, wealth, commerce and learning throughout the Muslim world.2 The emir Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman, whose dynastic title was Muhammad I, faced a double-edged threat to his authority. A rebellion by Iberian Christians, known as Mozarabs, often in league with Mudalies, a people of mixed Iberian ancestry, required the almost permanent deployment of Muslim troops to rebel-held enclaves. Far more worrisome were the separate uprisings in Toledo, the former capital of the Visigoth kingdom. The city’s overwhelmingly Mudali population had risen in revolt against Córdoba, enlisting the support of Ordoño I, the Christian king of Asturias, something that would eventually, in 1031, result in the fracturing of the Caliphate into a number of smaller, independent kingdoms. It was in Asturias, a remote mountainous region of north-western Spain, that in 718, nearly a decade after the Moorish invasion, the warrior Don Pelayo had raised the standard of insurrection, signalling the beginning of the Reconquista, eight centuries of warfare that saw control of Spain gradually wrested from Muslim hands, with the conquest of the last Moorish redoubt of Granada in 1492. Now, as the emir waited, Ordoño’s forces were marching south under the banner of St James the Apostle, patron saint of Spain, threatening Toledo, the gateway to the Al-Ándalus heartland.3 Forty-five miles north of Toledo lay a small, almost forgotten settlement, sited close to what was once a hub of roads linking the Roman provinces of Emerita, Cesaraugusta, Asturica and Corduba. By the fifth century, though it had been occupied and lightly fortified by the Visigoths, the desolate village on the high Castilian plateau that was to become Madrid began to fade from history. A century later, whatever urban life had existed was lost and the poorly defended 2\n\nFR O M MAŶRĪ T T O MADRID\n\nsettlement reverted to a small agricultural community.4 Who had occupied this site before the arrival of the Visigoth tribes remains a much-disputed historical enigma. In 1596, an image resembling a dragon was discovered carved into Puerta Cerrada, one of the city’s ancient walls. This inspired some historians to assert that Madrid had once been a Hellenic settlement, for the dragon was used by the ancient Greeks to adorn their cities’ coats of arms. Other scholars claimed that the dragon was in fact a snake, proving that the city had been founded by the Phoenicians. Those who defended the Roman-origin theory contended that the symbol was actually an image of the god Jupiter.5 What is known with certainty is that by the sixth century, many of its inhabitants began to migrate south to the bustling and prosperous town of Toledo, which in consequence grew to become the epicentre of Visigoth Spain. Muhammad I looked northwards and set his sights on this abandoned settlement, less than a two-day march short of the strategic Guadarrama mountain range. This is where the Christian crusaders would have to be stopped, he thought. Here on this featureless plateau, 2,100 feet above sea level, was the perfect position from which to engage an advancing army. The untrustworthiness of Toledo, moreover, added a sense of urgency to the task of building another line of defence against the Christian forces. The emir dispatched his military engineers and troops, who marched to this desolate spot, the site of modern Madrid, where in the late ninth century they erected a small fortification, or alcázar, enclosed by a crenellated, 12-footthick wall. The fort occupied a central position in a line of lookout towers erected at 25-mile intervals along a roughly west–east axis.6 It is relatively easy to locate where these towers stood. The Spanish word for tower is torre, and this became the prefix for lookouts – Torrelaguna, Torrepedrera, Torrecilla, Torrelavega and so on.7 If one drives north from Madrid along the A-6 motorway, one can see a particularly striking tower, thanks to heavy restoration, rising on a promontory at the approach to Torrelodones, 18 miles from the capital. It barely attracts the notice of the thousands of Spanish motorists speeding to and from the insipid dormitory towns that have sprung up alongside the road. 3\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nMuhammad I sent his troops to build a fortress on the plains, giving it the name of Maŷrīt (pronounced Mahereet), which translates as ‘waterways’, perhaps inspired by the several small rivers and streams that flowed nearby. In Visigoth days the village, if indeed it had ever attained that status, was called Matrice, or ‘mother stream’.8 The Arabic name stuck for the two centuries the Moors held the citadel in the face of sporadic attacks from the north, until 1083 when it was overrun by a Christian army under Alfonso VI of León and Castilla. When the king’s troops approached the walls, they discovered that what in the eighth century had been a vulnerable Visigoth fort, 300 years later had been transformed into a formidable redoubt, garrisoned by some of the emir’s most fearsome soldiers. The Reconquista was above all a religious crusade, so it was only appropriate that the hand of Divine Providence should intervene on behalf of the Christians. As the column of horsemen and infantry marched on the fortress, brandishing their swords and beating their drums, there appeared before them a vision of the Virgin Mary, who implored the king to allow her to lead his men against the Moorish defences. Suddenly the walls began to crumble before the onrushing host, revealing to their astonished eyes an icon that had been secreted four centuries earlier by the Visigoths when they had come under siege by the Muslim invaders. It was Nuestra Señora de la Almudena (Our Lady of the Almudena), from the Arabic term ‘al-mudayna’ (‘the citadel’). Guided by her image, the army stormed the gap to drive out the Moorish soldiers. Or so the story goes. Once wrested from Muslim hands, the citadel acquired the Mozarabic name of Matrit, and so preserved the same meaning as that it had been given by its former Visigoth and Arab rulers. Today it is known as Madrid, whose patron saint, quite naturally, is Nuestra Señora de la Almudena. The 800-year Reconquista of Spain was not a perpetual military campaign in which Christian forces would drive the Muslims out of a stronghold and then push on southwards and lay siege to their next objective. It was the longest war in history, but there were extended periods of peace and truces in the fighting, and fortresses and towns were sometimes retaken by Muslim armies, who then had to be 4\n\nFR O M MAŶRĪ T T O MADRID\n\nexpelled a second or third time. It was quite common for rival factions of Christian as well as Muslim rulers to engage in minor civil wars and, in some of these confrontations, mercenaries would be drafted in across faith lines. At times, these conflicts were cast in religious terms, but that does not mean they were fought because of religious differences. The kaleidoscope of coalitions could be dizzying. In the middle of the eleventh century, for instance, the Muslim ruler of Toledo signed a treaty with the Christian prince of Navarra for help against the Muslim city of Guadalajara. The price was steep and included a large payment of gold. In turn, the Navarra Christians were given the right to harvest a portion of the agricultural crop of Guadalajara, if the city was captured. In response, the Muslim elites of Guadalajara concluded a treaty with the Christian king of León and Castilla, whose soldiers then sacked Toledo. The Muslims of Toledo responded by sending emissaries of their own to the king of León, who demanded a large sum of gold from them in return for breaking his initial treaty and switching sides.9 It was not until 500 years after Don Pelayo rallied his followers at his mountain fastness of Covadonga in Asturias that the last remaining Muslim-held outpost in Spain, the emirate of Granada, was forced to become a vassal state of the Christian Crown of Castilla, though remaining under Muslim administration. Even then, it was to be another 250 years before the Christians launched a final offensive to take Granada in 1492, a battle that concluded with the eradication of the last remnants of Muslim authority from Spain. Before this time, the people of the conquered lands, Christians and Jews, were as a rule treated with tolerance insomuch as their religious beliefs were concerned, as had been the case with the first wave of Muslim expansion following the death of the Prophet Muhammad in AD 632, during which the Muslims acknowledged a kinship with their new subjects, who are regarded in the Quran as ahl al-kitāb, people of the Book (i.e. the Bible), chosen by Allah to receive His message. It was no different in Muslim Spain, where during eight centuries of shifting frontiers, a modus of coexistence was devised, which, at various stages of the Moorish conquest and the Christian Reconquista that followed, for the most part amounted to little more 5\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nthan a change of local tax collector. This arrangement applied to those areas that came under Christian rule during this period as well, at least until 1492, when the Jews were expelled from Spain, followed in the years thereafter by the gradual forced conversion of the Moors.10 In 1502 the ‘Reyes Católicos’ (‘Catholic Monarchs’) Fernando and Isabel11 offered the Mudéjars, Muslims who remained in Christian territory after the Reconquista, the choice of conversion or expulsion. In a final cleansing operation a century later even the converts, known as Moriscos, were made subject to an order of banishment by King Felipe III. Life in Madrid, as it began to evolve after the Christian occupation in the eleventh century, followed a similar pattern to that of other towns during the Reconquista. There remained behind a Mudéjar community of probably fewer than 100 souls, who, by the end of the fifteenth century, that is 400 years later, had risen only to some 250 Moorish inhabitants, roughly three per cent of the population. It may not seem a significant number, but it is worth bearing in mind that this is more than three times the proportion of North Africans living in present-day Madrid, and it was well above the 0.1 per cent average for other towns of medieval Christian Castilla. While by no means a significant segment of Madrid society, the Moors made up a homogeneous group that was eventually organised into hierarchical communities called aljamas. The aljama was effectively a ghetto, typically with its own Muslim butcher, a mosque and a cemetery. The city’s two aljamas were located in what is today the heart of La Latina district, the oldest part of Madrid. They are commemorated on tiled street signs depicting a fanciful rendering of Muslims in turbans and hooded robes: Plaza de Puerta de Moros (Moors’ Gate Square) and Calle de la Morería (Moorish Quarter Street). The number of Muslim inhabitants grew steadily with a wave of immigration from those parts of Spain still under Moorish domination, mainly in and around Granada. They came, in contemporary parlance, to seek a better life, marching northwards in caravans and on foot to a place that was beginning to make its mark on history. Madrid offered these migrants an opportunity to leave behind a 6\n\nFR O M MAŶRĪ T T O MADRID\n\nbesieged society in constant readiness for warfare, and to escape ‘the rigours of life under the Almoravid and Almohad empires’.12 In coming to Madrid the new arrivals cast their lot with the victors in the land that was beginning to gather form as Spain. Here we have the earliest instance of a pattern of immigration that was to become the stimulus of Madrid’s expansion throughout history. Like London, Madrid has always acted as a magnet for settlers. Since its foundation, it was the continual influx of outsiders who built the city and raised it to greatness, but, unlike London, those who migrated to Madrid came mostly from surrounding areas of the country rather than from abroad. Madrid remained an outpost straddling the frontier of Christendom for at least a century after its conquest by Alfonso VI. It is unknown whether Toledo, the ancient Visigoth capital, was taken shortly before or after the fall of Madrid. The demise of the taifa, or emirate, of Toledo in 1085 marked the first victory by the combined forces of Castilla and León, who were to fight side-by-side for the final liberation of Spain four centuries later. Toledo was also the first major city in Al-Ándalus to succumb to the crusaders. Madrid could have stood as the command centre from which Alfonso VI mustered his troops for the march on Toledo, a more important military trophy. Conversely, Madrid may have been overrun at an earlier date as the Christian forces marched south towards Toledo, which at that time was an objective of far greater strategic value. Toledo, the Visigoth capital and a fountain of knowledge and culture, surpassed only by Córdoba in Muslim Spain, was lost. The once-proud rulers of this gem astride the Tajo River were now regarded as lowly Mudéjars. As such, they were allowed to conserve their religion, their property and their customs, but were diminished to the status of vassals of the Castilian Crown. Islam was still a mighty force to be reckoned with and the Moors did not stop to weep over their loss, much less turn tail. This was to come much later.13 The campaigning continued in Castilla, where the Muslims fought to retake towns and fortifications that had fallen to the Christian armies, and simultaneously in the south, as the crusaders battled to reclaim 7\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nthe old Visigoth possessions still under Moorish domination. With Toledo under Christian control, all eyes now turned towards Madrid. The city had by default become the gateway to Carpetania, the ancient Spanish lands north of Madrid comprising most of Castilla, a region that had once been inhabited by a pre-Roman Celtic tribe called the Carpetanos. Alfonso VI, the warrior king who had driven the Moors from Castilla, León, Galicia and Portugal, and could with justification proclaim himself emperor of Spain, planned to convert Castilla into the stronghold of his Christian realm, with Madrid as a prominent frontline defensive bastion. It was no doubt an achievable strategy, with the Moors being steadily rolled back to their Andalucían sanctuaries, but in 1086 a fresh breath of life was delivered to the beleaguered Muslim cause. In that year an army of Almoravids, a Berber dynasty from southern Morocco, disembarked in the Bay of Gibraltar, filled with fighting zeal and determined to repair the unity of Al-Ándalus, and defeated Alfonso at the Battle of Sagrajas. The Almoravids pushed northwards and in 1109, the year of Alfonso VI’s death, 26 years after he had taken possession of Madrid in the name of Christendom, the Almoravid chieftain Yusuf bin Ali led his army to the gates of Madrid, there to lay siege to the fortress. The Spanish emperor was succeeded by his son-in-law Alfonso I of Navarra and Aragón, to whom the task of meeting this new challenge from the Moorish enemy fell. Bin Ali pitched his camp in an esplanade at the foot of the citadel, on a spot that would go down in history as Campo del Moro (Moors’ Field), today a sweeping landscaped garden facing the Palacio Real (Royal Palace). The Muslim soldiers set about sacking the out­lying settlements and then turned their attention to the attack on the powerful citadel walls that had been fortified by Muhammad I. This was a time of great peril for the defenders: bin Ali’s troops attacked with such ferocity that parts of the wall crumbled before the onslaught. At that point, according to popular legend, a terrible plague descended on the invaders. The Moorish general, watching with alarm his troops succumb to the epidemic, had no choice but to lift the siege and march back to Muslim-held territory. Far-fetched it may 8\n\nFR O M MAŶRĪ T T O MADRID\n\nseem, but the tale is not entirely implausible. Hygienic conditions in twelfth-century Spain, as throughout Europe, were not of a high standard and it is quite possible that bin Ali’s men were laid low by a waterborne infection (the city’s waste drained into the Manzanares River, which flows near to where the citadel stood) or some other source of disease. Madrid was never again to be threatened by Moorish domination, though Mudéjar influence was to remain embedded in the city’s culture for many years. Sadly, all traces of early Muslim architecture vanished in the wake of Madrid’s expansion. The only visible reminder of its presence is a warren of narrow, winding streets in La Morería district, which give onto little squares whose names – Yeseros, Mancebos, del Granado, Alamillo – in some instances refer to crafts that were practised by the city’s Moorish inhabitants, predominantly architecture and masonry, and are derived from words of unmistakably Arabic origin.14 There was to be little respite for the Christian rulers striving to consolidate and expand their dominions south of Madrid. From the mid twelfth century onwards yet another wave of Muslim warriors, this time of the Berber Almohad dynasty, gathered its forces for a strike at the Castilian territories. Once landed on Spanish shores, they quickly wrested control of Al-Ándalus from the enfeebled Almoravids. The Christian enclave at the Mediterranean port of Almería fell into Almohad hands, along with Baeza, north of Granada, the advanced staging post for Christian raids into Andalucía. The Almohads established strongholds at Córdoba and Sevilla, bringing strong pressure on the Tajo River line of defence at Toledo. The Almohad Caliph al-Nasir’s strategy was to drive the Christian kings, who appeared to be far too many to mount a unified defence, back to the Duero River. Wending its way eastward from Portugal, the Duero flows 50 miles to the north of Madrid, thus by definition the city was an objective squarely in the sights of the Almohad army. The great offensive never came. Madrid was subject to sporadic attacks by detachments of the sultan’s troops, but successfully resisted its besiegers. The Almohad forces found themselves confronted with an unexpected challenge: the fragmented realms of Castilla, León, Navarra and Portugal, sensing 9\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nthe threat of five centuries of Reconquista being lost to a determined and powerful foe, united their armies to clash with the enemy in its heartland of Andalucía. The Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, near the city of Jaén, was fought in the summer of 1212. The campaign brought together the four most powerful Spanish kings, whose ranks were swelled by a corps of battle-seasoned troops from Madrid who had already taken part the previous year in the offensive to expel the Moors from Murcia. On a brutally hot July morning the Madrid contingent, commanded by the distinguished nobleman Diego López de Haro, was leading the advance of the Christian army, in search of a route that would take them to the Moorish encampment. The troops snaked their way towards the Despeñaperros mountain pass, a defile flanked by towering rock faces, little suspecting that al-Nasir’s army lay in wait at the bottom. Before they entered, a shepherd appeared before the host, declaring he could guide the army to the Almohads by a side route.15 This enabled the Christian forces to take the enemy, encamped at the bottom of the pass, by surprise. The army descended on the unsuspecting Moors, roaring ‘¡Santiago y cierra, España! ’ (‘For St James and forward, Spain!’) as they charged. It was the first time the battle cry was used in the Reconquista, and today it remains enshrined in the hymn of the Spanish army’s cavalry corps. López de Haro, along with the kings of Castilla, Aragón and Navarra, delivered a crushing defeat to Caliph al-Nasir’s forces, who withered before the cavalry charges and left tens of thousands of dead and wounded on the field. The Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa marked the definitive turning point in the Reconquista. From this date forward, until the fall of Granada in 1492, the Almohads suffered a steady attrition of their power in Al-Ándalus. Never again were the Berber invaders to recapture the initiative in any meaningful way. By 1248, Córdoba, Sevilla and Valencia were under Christian sovereignty, and only the death in 1252 of King Fernando III, who consolidated the Reconquista through the permanent union of Castilla and León, prevented the Spanish army from crossing the Strait of Gibraltar to take the crusade to the enemy’s heartland. The Almohad defeat dispelled the threat 10\n\nFR O M MAŶRĪ T T O MADRID\n\nof any serious military challenge to Madrid, which now stood safely behind the frontline. Madrid’s contribution to this signal victory over the Almohads was acknowledged by the granting of a royal coat of arms. A banner depicting a brown bear, a species that once abounded in the dense forests of El Pardo, on a silver field had been carried into battle at Las Navas de Tolosa, and this came to be recognised as the city’s heraldic arms. Several years later, a dispute arose between a sector of the clergy and the Concejo, or municipal council,16 over the ownership of tracts of hills and grazing land lying within municipal jurisdiction. Given the litigants’ high rank, Alfonso VIII was called upon to mediate in the legal row. The king pronounced his judgement: the grazing land belonged to the Church, the woodland was the property of the Concejo. To affirm its claim on the forests, the Concejo adapted the city’s emblem to show the bear standing upright with its paws clawing at a madroño, or strawberry tree. The wrangle then shifted to the coat of arms itself, with the clergy insisting on slapping two white diagonal stripes across the shield and adding red castles in each corner. The Concejo, for its part, retaliated with seven silver stars placed around the border to symbolise the constellation Auriga, the Charioteer. Today the stars are taken to represent Ursa Major (bears roamed the woodlands around the town) and the five points of each of the stars refer to the five districts of Madrid’s autonomous region. Thus it remains, having taken its definitive design in 1869, with the addition of a royal crown to acknowledge the monarchy’s supremacy. The oldest representation of the coat of arms can be found carved into the remnants of the stone wall of a medieval manor house in the Calle de Segovia. The house was demolished in 1988 to make way for a block of flats, which bears the original name of La Casa del Pastor. Madrid had begun to establish its credentials as a permanent settlement under Christian rule well before the fateful battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. In 1152, King Alfonso VII granted the town the status of villa, a term with broader urban status, ranking above a settlement or village. This also meant Madrid could now exercise its own legal jurisdiction, which until then had been under the administration of 11\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nSegovia. In 1202, his successor, Alfonso VIII,17 granted the city the right to draw up its own fuero, a legal charter loosely defined as a compilation of laws and privileges. The most important of these were the rights to administer justice, raise taxes and appoint officials. Until that time Madrid had been governed by the Fuero of Toledo, a code that had been formulated to administer the affairs of a primarily peasant population. Madrid, on the other hand, was rapidly transforming itself into a settled urban society. The city was beginning to take on the life of a bustling metropolis. In the narrow, dust-clogged thoroughfares and squares, fat, snorting cattle and bleating merino sheep jostled for passage with squalling market vendors, whose wares were set out in the streets: domestic and devotional candles, bundles of rope for all occasions, earthenware jugs for storage and drinking, gleaming Toledo blades for kitchen and other, less congenial uses, braces of game strung up on hooks, including rows of drying ham hocks, the prize jamón serrano of Ibérico pigs. The Fuero was the first landmark step towards establishing a system of municipal self-government and it conferred on the Concejo a diverse range of powers, from the right to create a penal code to the authority to set food prices and fix a limit on the cost of wedding ceremonies. The Fuero also banned citizens from carrying daggers in public. Anyone found in violation of this law was fined and the revenue collected was put into a fighting fund to help finance the Reconquista. The Fuero was recognised as the supreme authority, sanctioned by the monarch, and implemented by the Concejo, whose duty it was to promote and safeguard peaceful coexistence with Madrid’s Muslim and Jewish communities, so that ‘rich and poor might live in peace and security’, as enshrined in the 26-page original, which was discovered in 1748.18 The laws applied only to the city’s Christian inhabitants and were not extended to Muslims and Jews, who were free to live under their own legal codes, but conversely found themselves excluded from any privileges the Fuero conferred on Christians. Legal disputes that arose between either of these two religious minorities and the ruling Christians were resolved under the by-laws of the Fuero. The complex framework of religious tolerance that prevailed in medieval Madrid, as well as in other cities that 12\n\nFR O M MAŶRĪ T T O MADRID\n\ncame under Christian rule during the Reconquista, could scarcely be imagined in any other European country of the day. Let it not be forgotten that Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in a state of reasonable tolerance until 1492, when Fernando and Isabel issued the infamous edict of expulsion after the fall of Granada. France and England banished their Jews fully 310 and 200 years, respectively, before they were expelled from Spain. The Fuero comprises a veritable treasure trove of information about the early life of Madrid. Given the zeal that held sway in those towns and cities liberated by the Reconquista, no effort was spared to reinforce Christian ascendancy over the Muslims. That applied to the Moors who stayed behind to carry on with their lives in Christian communities as well as the enemy lurking without. So it comes as no surprise that as early as the eleventh century Madrid, which at the time could best be described as a large town, with a population of at most 12,000, boasted no fewer than ten parish churches. The Fuero gives a detailed description of each of these along with their location within the walls, and we learn that in a good number of cases the local mosque was forced to give up its existence to accommodate the new rulers’ houses of worship – although none of these travesties equalled that of the plateresque cathedral that was inserted in the mosque of Córdoba, the glory of the Umayyad Caliphate, following Fernando III’s capture of that city in 1236. With the exception of two, San Nicolás and San Pedro,19 both extensively restored and undoubtedly built over mosques to judge by their Mudéjar towers, all of the original churches fell victim to neglect over the centuries or, with the expanding wealth and dominance of the Church, were demolished to make way for grander edifices.20 The Fuero also tells us of the appearance in Madrid, in the early thirteenth century, of two newly founded monastic orders, the Franciscans and that dreaded black-robed scourge of heretics and unbelievers during the Inquisition, the Dominicans. The two religious brotherhoods established themselves as far from one another as possible within Madrid’s walls, which enclosed an 86-acre municipal area. The Dominicans built their monastery on a hill on the city’s 13\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nnorthern perimeter. The order had close ties to the Crown of Castilla and received ample royal donations, with which the monks acquired vast land holdings within the city’s jurisdiction. The monastery, one of the wealthiest and most influential institutions of its day, fell into disrepair and vanished in 1869 in a state of utter ruin. The Franciscans founded their community on a spot south of the Alcázar built by Muhammad I. Nearly 800 years later, the Iglesia de San Francisco continues to thrive, substantiating perhaps the legend that it was founded by St Francis of Assisi himself, who fell ill in Madrid on a journey to Africa, and there had the friary raised as living quarters for his convalescence. Until the mid fourteenth century, under the reign of Alfonso XI – known as ‘el Justiciero’ (‘the Avenger’) for the ferocity with which he repressed any suggestion of disobedience by his nobles – Madrid’s affairs were managed by a council of patricians and pecheros, or worthy commoners. The ordinary citizenry was often invited to take part in meetings held two or three times a week to discuss municipal issues and resolve disputes between litigants. They also voted to elect their supreme representative, known as the Señor de Madrid, the medieval forerunner of the mayor.21 Meetings were usually convened by the ringing of the bells of the church of San Salvador, which until its demolition in 1842 stood in the Calle Mayor, adjacent to the present-day Ayuntamiento, or town hall. The gatherings were held in a small chamber above the cloister, and it is a striking testament to the skills of Gothic architects that the structure managed to remain erect for the more than 600 years of the building’s recorded history. On this same subject, as early as the fifteenth century one of the issues that came before the Concejo was how to raise funds to carry out urgent church-repair work. It took several days of heated debate to arrive at a consensus: the Concejo would levy a proportional tax of 50,000 silver maravedís22 (roughly £1.25 million in today’s money), three quarters of which was to be collected from land revenues and the rest apportioned equally between the city’s nobility on the one hand, and commoners, Jews and Moors on the other.23 14\n\nFR O M MAŶRĪ T T O MADRID\n\nIn the structure of the ancient Concejo can be found the embryo of Madrid’s present-day Ayuntamiento, an institution at once the object of popular affection and blistering scorn. It is a corporate body that wields enormous power over almost all facets of civic life, and consequently serves as the whipping boy for every Madrileño’s grievances. Well might the people of Madrid hail King Alfonso XI as ‘el Justo’ (‘the Just’), the title by which he was known to his subjects, for it was this fourteenth-century monarch of Castilla who recognised with foresight the city’s coming emergence as a centre of power. In 1339 the king decreed that Madrid was to have an updated Fuero, designated the Fuero Real (Royal Code), which took precedence over the 1202 statutes, and which within a decade had become the template for the modern Ayuntamiento. The same monarch, in 1346, issued a royal warrant, known as a cédula, which essentially confirmed Madrid’s Ayuntamiento as the city’s ruling body. The king ordered the appointment of a host of new officials, the equivalent of councillors, who held twice-weekly meetings, on Mondays and Fridays, chaired by the two men who shared the office of alcalde (mayor), along with the prison bailiff and the scribe, who as one of the few literate men within the city walls performed the role of town-hall secretary. Thus was awakened the southern-European zeal for top-heavy bureaucracy, as one by one the administration expanded to include in its ranks a lieutenant mayor, two standard bearers, six woodland keepers, an official spokesman, a solicitor and a keeper of the seal. In September, each of these authorities was appointed for a one-year term of office, ensuring that none of the city’s notables missed out on this ‘jobs for the boys’ scheme.24 One of the first measures enacted by the new Ayuntamiento was the foundation of the Estudio de la Villa in 1346, a school for Madrid’s children, of which nothing remains but a plaque in the Calle de los Mancebos, a few minutes’ walk south of the Calle Segovia. One of its most illustrious graduates, enrolled at the school two centuries later, was Miguel de Cervantes, the great novelist, who studied under the Spanish humanist Juan López de Hoyos. The fourteenth century saw Madrid’s transformation from a town characterised by the lingering hallmarks of a frontier Reconquista 15\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\noutpost to a Castilian city of growing prominence. It was around this time that the monarch granted Madrid the honour of hosting the Cortes, an ancient institution that has existed in one form or another since the eighth century and remains deeply embedded in Spain’s legislative tradition. Today the Congreso de los Diputados (Chamber of Deputies) and Senado (Senate) of the Spanish parliament are known collectively as the Cortes. Six centuries ago it was periodically convened as a gathering of the feudal lords and other dignitaries of Castilla, eventually incorporating representatives of the fledgling urban bourgeoisie. The king and his court travelled from Toledo, the royal residence of Christian Spain, to preside over these assemblies. Historians have put forth the argument that the Cortes of León, held in 1188, was the first parliamentary body in Western Europe, and no evidence has yet emerged to refute this claim. Alfonso XI, Madrid’s spirited royal patron, called together the Cortes on two occasions at the Alcázar during his reign, setting in train a precedent for succeeding monarchs who, to the delight of Madrid’s Ayuntamiento, showed their favour by granting royal privileges on the city. These included the right to collect certain taxes and to enjoy exemptions from others, as well as priorities granted in matters of protocol. The Cortes also became a forum for passing judgement on questions of dynastic succession. Thus in 1390, when King Juan I died after being thrown from his horse, leaving as heir his 11-year-old son, the future Enrique III, the Cortes was convened in Madrid to choose a regent to rule in Castilla until the boy came of age. This event, along with the solemn funeral organised by the Concejo for Juan I, reinforced Madrid’s status as an upcoming seat of Castilian power. After his coronation in 1393 (14, in medieval times, was considered a reasonable age to rule a country), Enrique III came to spend long months of the year in Madrid and considered himself as one with the Madrileños.25 In the same year of his enthronement the king married Catherine of Lancaster, daughter of John of Gaunt, a union that brought a temporary peace between England and Castilla. The municipal authorities of Toledo, the chief royal abode of the Castilian monarchs and spiritual capital of Spanish Catholicism, were no doubt displeased with the bestowal of patronage on this 16\n\nFR O M MAŶRĪ T T O MADRID\n\ncomparative nonentity to the north. They had even greater cause to resent Madrid’s rising prominence when in 1382, some years before Juan I met his death, the king agreed to pay a considerable ransom of precious stones, silks and birds of prey to the warrior class known as the Mamluks for the release of King Leo V of Armenia. This hapless sovereign had been defeated in battle by superior Mamluk forces and taken prisoner to Cairo, whence he succeeded in sending a messenger to Castilla, presumably choosing this land, which he perceived to be a Christian brother-in-arms against the Muslim invaders, to plead for help. Juan I responded by ransoming Leo V and receiving him, not in the royal capital of Toledo, but in Madrid, where he was given the freedom of the city in perpetuity and an annuity of 150,000 maravedís.26 In a gesture of reciprocity, the former ruler of the Armenians rebuilt the much-deteriorated towers of Madrid’s Alcázar before taking his leave of the city, two years later, to live out his days in the more sumptuous ambience of Paris, where he was granted another sizeable pension from King Charles VI of France. Enrique III, like his father Juan I, was an ardent believer in Madrid’s rising star. The king’s desire to proclaim the city’s primacy to the four corners of the earth led to the most bizarre undertaking of his reign. In what was to be one of the last initiatives before his death, in 1403 Enrique III dispatched Ruy González de Clavijo, a Madrid nobleman and the king’s chamberlain, on a mission to modern-day Samarkand in Uzbekistan, there to show the flag to none other than the Mongol emperor Timur (Tamerlane). Clavijo had the advantage of being literate and, what is more, like his predecessor Marco Polo he was a prolific chronicler of his travels. Sailing from Cádiz, the small entourage made its way along the Black Sea coast of Turkey and then carried on overland by camel caravan through Armenia, Persia and Turkmenistan, eventually reaching the fabled city of Samarkand, where in due course Clavijo was granted an audience with the fearsome Mongol conqueror. Timur received the Spanish envoy in a chamber with a silver gilt table, as high as a man… on the top of which there was a bed of silk cloths, embroidered with gold… and here the 17\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nlord was seated. The walls were hung with rose-coloured silk cloths, ornamented with plates of silver gilt, set with emeralds, pearls and other precious stones.27 Later there was feasting and drinking such as was never envisaged in austere Castilian Spain, with much wine, as well as ‘cream and sugar… They also brought great quantities of roasted sheep and horses… and they eat all this with much noise, tearing the pieces away from each other, and making game over their food.’28 From his journal, we learn that when Clavijo’s host confronted him with these glories of Samarkand, a dazzling place that could have served as the set for a film of the Arabian Nights, the Madrileño calmly riposted with a tale of his great city of Castilla, which is surrounded by a wall of fire and rests on a body of water, and which one enters miraculously through a closed gate. In this city there is a court of law, he proclaimed, whose judge is a cat and where the lawyers are beetles, and the dead walk the streets. Could Clavijo be having a mischievous jibe at the Concejo? Timur, whose empire stretched from Turkey to India, listened impassively to the Spanish traveller’s tale. The Mongol emperor was fresh from his conquest of Delhi, where he had had 100,000 captives executed, left the city a smouldering ruin and, according to Clavijo himself, needed to employ 90 captured elephants merely to carry precious stones looted from his conquest. Madrid? Could such a place even be worthy of putting to the torch? The audience ended amicably and Clavijo returned to Spain in 1405, content with having secured for Madrid a place on the world stage. The year 1477 marked a decisive turning point, when Madrid began to throw off the trappings of a town, at least in appearance if not in temperament, and experience the most sweeping transformation in its history. For in that year, the Reyes Católicos King Fernando and Queen Isabel (who was reputed to be a Madrileña by birth) entered Madrid and took a broom to a place they found in a state of archaic disarray.\n\n18\n\n— 2 — a very catholic facelift\n\nChristian Spain in the fifteenth century was in a phase of dynamic expansion and religious enthusiasm, while Moorish Spain, having attained a high level of civilisation and material prosperity, had lost its military vigour and spiritual fervour. The successors to the warlike Almoravids and Almohads were for the most part weak rulers and, moreover, they were never very popular with their subjects. The powerful Christian mini-states of Aragón and Cataluña were at that time concerned with their Mediterranean possessions, which were the Balearic Islands, Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily, as well as the Duchy of Athens. Portugal had gained its independence from the Crown of Castilla in the twelfth century and was busily creating a vast empire that would one day stretch from South America across Africa and India to South East Asia. So it was left to Castilla and its ruling class of feudal lords to see the Reconquista through to its victorious conclusion with the capture of Granada. The marriage in 1469 of Fernando, heir apparent to the throne of Aragón, and Isabel, the future queen of Castilla and León, all but brought about the final unification of Spain. The Kingdom of Navarra, which stubbornly held out until its annexation by Castilla in 1515, and of course the coveted Moorish emirate of Granada, were the only territories remaining outside the dominion of the Reyes Católicos. When King Juan II of Aragón died in 1479, his son Fernando enjoyed an untroubled accession to the throne. But, to confuse matters, Isabel’s claim to Castilla was contested by Juana, the daughter of Isabel’s 19\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nhalf-brother Enrique IV, who could count on the support of her prospective husband Alfonso V of Portugal. With Enrique IV’s death in 1474, a war of succession broke out between partisans of the two female contenders for the throne of Castilla. Madrid, as the emerging seat of Castilian power, could not remain aloof from the dynastic fight. The city was fairly evenly divided in sentiment between both claimants, with a small majority leaning towards Juana, who was said to be the biological daughter of Enrique IV’s favourite courtier Beltrán de la Cueva, hence her nickname Juana la Beltraneja. Juana’s followers barricaded themselves in the Alcázar fortress, but through an act of treachery by one of Isabel’s partisans, a diplomat named Pedro de Ayala, who was charged with the defence of the Puerta de Guadalajara at the eastern edge of the city, the doors were thrown open to Isabel’s forces, who stormed the Alcázar by surprise and took possession of Madrid. Thus ended the dynastic conflict. As founder, along with her husband Fernando, of the Spanish Inquisition, Isabel could hardly be faulted for a lack of combativeness. Yet she was not a vindictive woman, at least not towards her fellow Christians. No reprisals were taken against the Madrid faction that had opposed her claim to the throne of Castilla, and under her reign the city grew and prospered as never before in its history. Though the Reyes Católicos spent comparatively little time in Madrid, Valladolid being their favoured royal residence, they did convene two meetings of the Cortes in the city, in 1482 and 1499. These semi-public gatherings were held with the active support of the Concejo, which strove to repair the devastation done by the storming of the Alcázar, to say nothing of the damage to Isabel’s pride on seeing a segment of her people rise up against her, by donating public land for resettlement in the vicinity of the fortress. Land was given free of charge to Christians who chose to return to a city that had suffered an exodus of its population, with people fleeing to the countryside to escape the fighting that raged around the citadel. The Concejo’s records speak of outbreaks of arson, looting and the widespread destruction of buildings during the war. The Cortes convened after this minor civil war were used as a forum to launch an ambitious undertaking 20\n\nA V E RY C AT H O L I C FA C E L IF T\n\nof urban regeneration and expansion for this city which, with the gradual return of the populace, boasted between 12,000 and 14,000 inhabitants. Isabel inspired the construction of churches and civil buildings in which attention to decoration was given the same consideration as structural elements. Much of this work took the name of Isabelline Gothic style, representing the transition between the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, a striking amalgam of original features and influences of Gothic, Mudéjar and Flemish art. Many of Madrid’s sixteenth-century buildings erected in this manner were commissioned by the Reyes Católicos or were in some way sponsored by them. One of the most striking of these structures is the church of San Jerónimo el Real, which stands on a rise overlooking a field on which more than three centuries later the Museo del Prado would be erected. The original Jerónimos monastery, no longer in existence, was commissioned in 1463 during the reign of Enrique IV. It stood near the Manzanares River, a remote as well as architecturally faulty spot, given the marshy soil that could scarcely support such a weighty structure. Isabel had ‘Los Jerónimos’, as it is today known to Madrileños, rebuilt in what is still the city centre to serve as the royal residence of the Reyes Católicos during their sojourns in Madrid. For centuries the church was the traditional venue for the investiture of the heir to the throne, the Príncipe de Asturias. The reign of the Reyes Católicos in many ways ushered in a minor renaissance for Madrid. The city stood on a crossroads of trade routes, affording easy passage across a landscape unobstructed by physical barriers and only two days’ journey from the thriving commercial and political centres of Toledo and Segovia. Toledo was in the sixteenth century still the capital city of Castilla and home to Christian Spain’s major source of swords, knives and other metallurgical products. Segovia was in its own right a great centre for the textile trade and it was in this city, in 1474, that Isabel was proclaimed Queen of Castilla in the church of San Miguel. Isabel encouraged a building boom that took Madrid’s urban expansion right up to the city’s defensive walls, running roughly along the Calle Mayor, Cava Baja and Puerta Cerrada. This steadily 21\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\ndrew what had been outlying suburbs, almost separate townships, into central Madrid. The Concejo could scarcely keep up with an avalanche of applications for building permits. The town-hall authorities luxuriated in every bureaucrat’s zeal for enacting by-laws. Between 1476 and 1493, the Concejo produced a deluge of regulations governing the establishment of new shops, and this coincided with a proliferation of tradesmen and artisans. According to the Libros de Acuerdos,1 these new arrivals in the closing years of the fifteenth century were engaged in almost 100 different professions. A number of these occupations, mainly those of scribe and letrado (literally a ‘lettered’ person, usually a lawyer), attested to the spread of literacy and learning. These men were held in high social standing and this was reflected in their wages. A letrado’s annual salary of 1,500 maravedís in old Castilian currency was only exceeded by that of aldermen, doctors and surgeons. Many other new tradesmen – watchmakers, silversmiths, musicians – came to live in this rapidly growing city to practise their specialised skills. The Concejo was determined to put a stop to antisocial customs like casting the contents of chamber pots out of windows – the cry ‘¡Agua va!’ (‘Water below!’) was the signal for passers-by to run for cover. The city was infested with filth and its inhabitants’ social habits could most charitably be termed disagreeable – and this did not go unnoticed by foreign visitors. Camillo Borghese, who was papal nuncio in the late seventeenth century and was later elected pope as Paul V, remarked that the houses of Madrid were bad and ugly and almost all made of mud and among other imperfections have neither doorsteps nor closets, in consequence of which, all perform their necessities in chamber pots which they afterwards throw into the street, a thing which creates an insupportable odour… if one did not use diligence to clean the street frequently one could not move, but even in spite of this cleaning it is impossible to walk.2 Over 1,400 by-laws were brought into effect to regulate the activities of the textile and jewellery trades alone, but even more were required 22\n\nA V E RY C AT H O L I C FA C E L IF T\n\nto oversee the plethora of taverns that began springing up around the city to serve commercial travellers as well as the ever more affluent Madrileños and, underpinned by a climate that favours street life, came to form an integral part of Madrid’s social fabric. It would be woefully inaccurate to portray Madrid’s taverns as a gathering place for the city’s genteel classes. The vast majority of these inns, which were for the most part more like brawling houses than taverns, were rude, dark, poorly ventilated watering holes, frequented by a smattering of civil servants and honest wage earners, but mostly by a coterie of soldiers fresh from butchering Dutch insurrectionists, along with tramps and beggars (who accounted for around ten per cent of the population) and common criminals of every description, not to mention half-starved, down-at-heel noblemen and assorted swashbucklers, always game to wield a dagger or sword to obtain their crust. There was no lack of premises to accommodate all this humanity, since by 1600 Madrid was home to 391 taverns. In reality, there were undoubtedly many more, since the authorities, given their concern with the proliferation of these establishments… strived to limit their numbers, at first to 200, and later to 400, but all in vain.3 The Concejo took the supervision of the city’s taverns with utmost seriousness. By 1616, the lawlessness, brawling and general riotous behaviour endemic to these places had reached such a level that the authorities stepped in to ban innkeepers from providing chairs and tables in their establishments, as well as prohibit patrons from consuming food brought in from outside. The rationale was to discourage people from spending excessive time at these drinking houses.4 Madrid was the birthplace of the picaresque hero, the roguish character popularised by the seventeenth-century literary giants Francisco de Quevedo and Miguel de Cervantes, and early publicans were often men typical of this breed. The practice of diluting wine with water was so prevalent in Madrid’s taverns that the government felt obliged to enact a decree, one of the harshest on the books for a non-capital crime, imposing 100 lashes for anyone convicted of 23\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nselling adulterated wine. Moreover, the offender’s stock of wine was to be confiscated and shared equally between the plaintiff and the presiding magistrate. This had no adverse impact on the continual increase in the number of the city’s inns, something that carried on through the centuries to follow. It is reckoned that more taverns and cafés today exist between Madrid’s Plaza Santa Ana and Plaza Antón Martín than in the whole of Norway. It was also around this time that, by popular custom, the Plaza del Arrabal established itself as the city’s central marketplace. The enclosed square, which also served as the venue for bullfights and public executions, was torn down more than a century later and replaced with the more dignified Plaza Mayor, a sprawling, enclosed quadrangle of nearly 200,000 square feet, surrounded by threestorey residential buildings, with more than 200 balconies facing the square. Felipe III’s likeliest motive for having the Plaza del Arrabal demolished in 1617 was to endow his new capital with a worthy rival to Valladolid, the former seat of government, which boasted the largest central square in Spain. When construction was completed in 1619, the Plaza Mayor stood as the symbolic centre of the Spanish Empire. Its inauguration three years later drew 50,000 people to witness a spectacle of bullfighting and jousting. The site of the Plaza del Arrabal and later the Plaza Mayor was also the scene of the canonisations of various saints, among them St Ignatius of Loyola in 1609 and San Isidro in 1622. Four centuries later, the Plaza Mayor remains the most celebrated landmark of Madrid’s historic old town. New buildings went up under the Reyes Católicos, mostly to the east of the city centre, the logical direction for urban expansion, given the barrier of the river to the west, the bumpy terrain rising towards the Guadarrama mountains to the north and Toledo’s boundary to the south, encroaching upon which could pose the risk of a land-rights dispute. Isabel oversaw the construction of five new hospitals, some of which served as rest stops for travellers, though being bled with leeches or having infected wounds doused with vinegar were not necessarily salutary experiences for patients. A major urban clean-up campaign got underway in a city portrayed in contemporary accounts as swarming with filth of every description, where pigs and other farm 24\n\nA V E RY C AT H O L I C FA C E L IF T\n\nanimals enjoyed free rein in the streets. Not that the city’s human inhabitants were much more scrupulous in their hygiene: as early as the thirteenth century the framers of the original Fuero had felt compelled to introduce a fine for those who deposited their faeces in the public footpath or doorways. Fernando and Isabel found to their dismay that most Madrileños had cheerfully ignored this law laid down three centuries previously. The monarchs wrote to the town’s chief magistrate, Rodrigo de Mercado, reminding him that the Crown had been responsible for Madrid’s facelift and that it was up to the people ‘to keep the streets clean’ and that nobody ‘should dare to jettison from their windows night soil or anything else that fouls the footpath’.5 The Reyes Católicos ordered the streets to be swept clean every seven days and within two hours of sunrise, and all rubbish was to be collected and taken to one of four public tips. Under Fernando and Isabel, abattoirs, tanning factories, forges and other polluting or malodorous industries were relocated outside the city walls. The streets, if the warren of twisting dirt footways that were turned into streams of mud after a rainstorm could be described as such, by royal decree were given their first paving stones. By the end of the fifteenth century living space was at a premium and as a result new houses were built outside the walls. Markets and fairs began to flourish under the protection of the monarchs, and this gave a boost to trade and likewise to the Concejo’s economic power.6 The Concejo was delighted with this lavishing of royal patronage on their city. Madrid’s star was undeniably in the ascendant: the influx of scholars, craftsmen and merchants, the fact that the great Madrid families – Luzón, Guzmán, Mendoza – were now spending more time in the city in homes worthy of their station, the splendid overall urban revival, all of this presaged days of glory for a Madrid that, a few decades hence, was to become the capital of the Spanish Empire. There was only one hitch: who was to pay for this enterprising and costly expansion and building works? The Concejo claimed to be without a bean, or maravedí, to put it in the vernacular. There wasn’t even 25\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nenough money in the municipal coffers to provide the mayor and his staff with a proper assembly hall. The corporation was humbled into holding its meetings in the local parish church. Fernando and Isabel came up with the solution, which was to shift the financial burden onto the populace: Jews, Moors, noblemen and merchants alike, each contributing according to his ability. In addition, a special tax was levied on meat, one maravedí for every arrelde 7 of beef purchased. Apart from public health, the Madrid authorities concerned themselves with an array of administrative matters, from keeping the peace to enacting more humane labour laws. To this end a ban was imposed, applying to citizens of all social rank, on carrying swords in public ‘upon pain of having their weapons confiscated… and broken or disposed of in the manner deemed most appropriate’.8 The Concejo also addressed itself to traditional work practices by fixing a minimum number of hours on employment contracts, with fines imposed for employers who signed up workers for less than the stipulated minimum number of hours to which they were entitled as well as job seekers who accepted work under illegal conditions. The Concejo also set 15 as the minimum age for farm labourers, a seemingly benevolent measure, though it has been argued that this was imposed less in the spirit of child protection than to prevent adolescents running rampant though croplands. Then came 1481, the year of infamy for Madrid’s Muslims and Jews. Fernando and Isabel were becoming increasingly intoxicated with the spread of Christian power in and beyond their dominions. The Reyes Católicos had brought stability to the kingdoms of Castilla, León and Aragón, and this laid the foundation for the permanent political unification of Spain that was to take its definitive form under the reign of their grandson Carlos I. It was in this year that the events were set in train that 11 years later resulted in the ethnic cleansing of Christian Spain, with the expulsion en masse of the country’s Jews. This surge of royal intolerance was precipitated by a signal event that took place the previous year: 1480 saw the establishment of the Holy Office of the Inquisition. The black-robed Dominican friars of Madrid were the driving force behind the witch-hunter tribunal, 26\n\nA V E RY C AT H O L I C FA C E L IF T\n\nwhose grand inquisitor held court in the city. The Jews and Moors suffered greatly under this reign of terror, which for more than 300 years kept much of the populace in dread of torture and worse at the hands of malign clerics. That said, the Spanish Inquisition ‘was ostensibly set up to deal with formal heresy, and therefore neither the Jews nor the Moors of Spain, at the time of its creation, were subject to it. Heresy is a crime of Christians: the Jews and Moors were then unbelievers.’9 Despite not being of the Catholic faith, these two minorities were gradually brought under Inquisition control. But it is useful to bear in mind that, thoroughly evil as it was, in terms of the number of people who suffered persecution and were consigned to the flames of purification, Spain’s Inquisition was relatively benign compared with the butchery let loose in other European countries. Spain’s alleged witches were usually let off with a lashing, public humiliation or banishment, quite mild punishments compared with the thousands executed in France and Germany during the heyday of Europe’s witchcraft hysteria. The first edict directed against Madrid’s Jewish inhabitants was issued in March 1481: ‘Let no Jew dare walk the streets of this city without a badge, under pain of paying a 100-maravedí fine [roughly £100 in today’s money] for the first offence, 200 for the second, and for the third, the forfeiture of the clothes he carries.’10 Several months after this proclamation came into effect, the Concejo issued another decree by order of Isabel and Fernando, this one including the Muslims as targets of their intolerance. The edict makes all the more sinister reading for appearing as a single sentence inserted matter-of-factly between one passing judgement on a land dispute between two noblemen and another granting a licence to a butcher to sell meat within the city walls. It reads: ‘The Concejo has agreed to dispatch a letter with the Corregidor [Chief Magistrate] Juan de Guzmán, by which Jews and Moors are required to live in separate quarters, or incur the wrath of our lords the Reyes Católicos.’11 Madrid’s ethnic ghettos had already come into being by the time of this decree, with the Jews confined to the streets around the synagogue and the Moors to the environs of their mosque. Both houses of worship were subsequently razed, and while there are 27\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nrecords attesting to the site of the Moorish quarter, which lies just south of the Calle Segovia, streets between the Plaza Mayor and the Manzanares River, the location of the Judería is largely a matter of guesswork. It is believed that most of Madrid’s Jews lived in the neighbourhood of Lavapiés, now in the heart of the historic city centre. The church of San Lorenzo is believed to stand on the site once occupied by the synagogue, appropriately enough in what was called Calle de la Sinagoga, later renamed, with predictable hubris, Calle de la Fe (Street of the Faith). Indeed, Lavapiés was the scene of several pogroms in the late fourteenth century, leading some historians to claim that the decree to force the Jews to live in a walled compound was actually intended for their protection. This does not stand up to scrutiny in the light of subsequent events. Over the centuries, the intermingling of Madrid’s Christians with the city’s two religious minorities had created a measure of commercial dependence, on Jewish tailors, cloth merchants and spice dealers, and also on Muslim architects and builders, to name a few of the professions that were largely in the hands of these communities. The edict restricting the Jews to the quarter in which they had originally settled quaintly specified an exception for four individuals – Jacon and Hayn Lerma, Mair de Curiel and Juçaf Barbaça – who were allowed to sell their cloth and spices outside the ghetto walls but in daylight hours only, ‘and at night must return to their homes to be with their wives and children, in the same manner as the Moors’.12 The Concejo was also prepared to make an exception for one Rabí Jacó, who was the only Jew granted permission to live outside the ghetto, for the simple reason that he was the city’s most qualified physician. In a medieval town with a dubious sanitary infrastructure and hence frequent outbreaks of disease, Christians required swift and trustworthy medical attention, notwithstanding the religious convictions of the person administering treatment. The memory of 1434 still struck terror into the hearts of many Madrileños. Without warning, on 29 October of that year rain had begun falling in torrents on the city and the downpour continued unabated for 70 days and nights. Homes were flooded, the streets were choked with rotting corpses and the carcasses of drowned animals, and houses collapsed 28\n\nA V E RY C AT H O L I C FA C E L IF T\n\nunder the incessant deluge. The people of Madrid were to have only a four-year respite, until in 1438 a deadly plague swept over the city. King Enrique IV, the nobility, the clergy and anyone who could find a means of survival outside the walls fled towards the high ground of the Guadarrama range, leaving the commoners to suffer the ravages of disease. Fearful of the ever-present threat of natural disaster, the Concejo was only too happy to make allowances for those skilled in dealing with such calamities. That the Jews, as non-Christians, could not by definition be accused of heresy was no justification for allowing them to share the same soil as those who had spent the better part of seven centuries battling to rid Spain of its non-believers. So went the reasoning of the Reyes Católicos. Therefore, in 1492, a year after the Treaty of Granada was proclaimed, guaranteeing religious freedom to Jews and Muslims alike in the emirate of Granada’s transition to Castilian sovereignty, the Reyes Católicos performed an historic volte-face by issuing the Decreto de la Alhambra (Alhambra Decree). At a stroke of the pen some 200,000 Jews were expelled from Spain, with the blessing of the Church and in the name of Christian unity. Spain’s Muslims may have believed – erroneously, as history was to demonstrate – that Fernando and Isabel were simply following medieval European trends: after all, pogroms were commonplace in other countries, some of which had forced their Jews to flee long before the Spanish Inquisition was conceived. The Muslims reasoned that this campaign was directed against the Jews, not themselves, who had after all called the Iberian Peninsula home since the eighth century. But ancestral links proved no safeguard against persecution. For that matter, there is strong evidence that the Jewish presence in Spain predated Christianity itself, with the first settlers arriving at the time of the Diaspora that followed the Roman conquest of Judea in the first century BC. The 1492 decree in reality fired the monarchs’ (and the Inquisition’s) eagerness to cleanse Spain of all vestiges of religious impurity. This meant the Muslims would have to leave as well. The Moors put up some armed resistance to abandoning what they considered to be their homeland. Spanish troops quickly quelled these uprisings in villages near Granada, Valencia and elsewhere 29\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nin the most recently conquered territories. Then came the forced conversions, followed by the burning of Islamic texts13 and finally the brutal suppression of a major insurrection a fuego y sangre (by fire and sword) in Granada in 1499 at the hands of the notorious Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, a grand inquisitor who hailed from a town near Madrid. In 1501, the Moors were given the choice of embracing Christianity or going into exile. Most chose the former, thus preserving their property and traditional family life. These converts, known as Moriscos (literally ‘little Moors’), stayed on in Spain, paying lip service to the Christian faith, until 1609 when the Habsburg King Felipe III issued the definitive order of expulsion. Fernando and Isabel’s greatest achievement was to have financed Christopher Columbus’s voyage to the New World.14 It was left to their grandson and first of the Habsburg dynasty, Carlos I, to preside over the expansion and consolidation of the empire which followed that remarkable sea voyage in 1492. Carlos I arrived in Madrid from Flanders in 1517, a 17-year-old king with little hope of endearing himself to a city whose regard for foreign masters verged on the xenophobic. Three years later, at the age of 20, he was also crowned Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire, a realm that brought under his authority Germany, Austria, Naples, Sicily, the Netherlands and immense territories of South America. Little did this matter to the Madrileños, who were more concerned with the fact that he spoke no Spanish, that he was almost totally ignorant of Spanish affairs and that he surrounded himself with a coterie of Flemish advisers who lost no time in exploiting their privileges vastly to enrich themselves at court. A good deal of grumbling was heard in Madrid’s taverns about the imposition of this foreign teenager, whose mother, Queen Isabel’s daughter Juana, was quickly removed from public life to make room for the young interloper from Flanders. Juana was the last ruler of the venerable Castilian Trastámara line. She was wedded to Philip, Duke of Burgundy, thus introducing the Habsburg dynasty into Spain. The early death of her siblings had left Juana heiress to the throne, but nine years into their marriage, Philip died suddenly and, some whispered, in suspicious circumstances. Juana’s grief was such 30\n\nA V E RY C AT H O L I C FA C E L IF T\n\nthat she succumbed to a state of hopeless despair and was incapable of dealing with affairs of state. Hence her nickname: ‘Juana la Loca’. She apparently suffered from what would today most likely be diagnosed as severe clinical depression. Her state of mind is frighteningly depicted in the painting by Francisco Pradilla Ortiz, which hangs in the Museo del Prado, of the queen holding vigil over Philip’s coffin, convinced that he will come back to life. Carlos ensured his domination as well as his throne by having his mother confined for the rest of her days in the convent of Santa Clara in Castilla, where her condition degenerated further, and where she ruled in name only as her son’s co-monarch. The mistrust felt by Madrileños towards their foreign monarch was matched by Carlos’s bewilderment as to why his forebears had chosen to sojourn for extended periods in this isolated town perched on the stark Castilian plateau. ‘The people of Madrid took note of the fact that during the first four years of the monarch’s reign, until he went to Germany to be crowned emperor, Carlos held Cortes in Valladolid, Zaragoza, Barcelona and Santiago, but never in Madrid.’15 The grumblings of discontent rose to an uproar over taxes levied to finance Carlos’s foreign wars, which were of scant interest to Madrileños. People observed with sullen anger how French-speaking courtiers were appointed to high office and finally, in 1520, Castilla declared itself in open revolt. Toledo and Segovia were the first to take up arms against the Crown in an insurrection called La Guerra de los Comuneros, so named for the Castilian comuneros (followers of the Castilian cause) who took up arms against the Crown. As they were to prove later, the Madrileños were never ones to stand on the sidelines when there was a good uprising in the offing. The Alcázar was besieged by a mob, which raided the armoury and made off with a sizeable haul of lances, pikes and firearms. Apart from the storming of the citadel, the only other act of vandalism was an attack on the home of the royalist leader Diego de Vargas, whose furniture was hurled out of the windows. The rebellion was to be fleeting: in 1521 the Comuneros laid down their arms on learning that Carlos had issued a decree from Germany agreeing to abrogate the unpopular measures that had driven the people into the streets. 31\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nQuite a different mood reigned when Carlos next entered Madrid, in 1525, where he was received with an outpouring of acclaim. The emperor rode through the city with his distinguished prisoner, François I, in tow. The French king’s army had been crushed at the Battle of Pavia, after which he was imprisoned by Carlos and forced to sign the Treaty of Madrid, surrendering significant territory to his captor. A French monarch marched in humiliation through the city streets – this was much more to the Madrileños’ liking. Carlos was at last beginning to win his people’s hearts, something that was consolidated in 1528 when he finally chose Madrid to convene the Cortes. It was at this gathering of nobles and officials that the emperor conferred on his son, the future Felipe II, the title Prince of Asturias, making him the recognised heir to the Spanish throne. One of the unintended outcomes of the Comuneros’ rebellion was the birth of a structure that would in time come to be accepted, only slightly erroneously, as the geographical centre of Spain.16 To protect themselves from the banditry and general lawlessness that follows in the footsteps of armed conflict, the citizens of Madrid erected a fortification on the city’s eastern edge, and over its gate they emblazoned a golden sun. The small citadel and the gate were demolished when hostilities ceased and peace was restored to Castilla. But the square in which the fortification had stood and the name of the gate became one of the city’s most celebrated icons, the Puerta del Sol (Gate of the Sun). The square, known as ‘Kilómetro Cero’ (‘Kilometre Zero’), is marked by a plaque, and is the starting point from which all road distances in Spain are measured. Nearly a decade was to pass before Carlos I summoned the Cortes in Madrid for a second time. At this gathering he announced, to the delight of the Concejo, that he had acceded to their request to bestow on Madrid the title of ‘Villa Imperial y Coronada’ (‘Imperial and Crowned City’), decreeing at the same time that the royal crown be displayed on its coat of arms. The usage of the Spanish imperial crown took Madrid a step closer to becoming the official capital, though it would be nearly another three decades before the bumptious little town on the plains was to upstage its historic rivals Toledo and Valladolid. 32\n\nA V E RY C AT H O L I C FA C E L IF T\n\nThe emperor now began to take a deeper interest in Madrid, its hunting grounds, its architecture, even its commercial life, which he did much to stimulate by exempting all tradesmen who had to journey more than five leguas (leagues) to market from paying a tax levied on each article sold. Likewise, Carlos’s wife Isabel, who was also his first cousin, became a benefactor of the city, having ordered a chapel to be built on the site where San Isidro was believed to have discovered water for his master Iván de Vargas. The chapel was built as an offering of thanks to the future saint, whose miraculous water was supposed to have restored her ailing infant son Felipe to health. The shrine has become a popular pilgrimage for Madrileños, who every year on 15 May, the saint’s birthday, gather on this spot in classic nineteenth-century Castilian dress, the women in long polka-dot frocks and mantillas, sporting carnations in their hair, riding in colourful Gypsy carts drawn by mules. Carlos I divided a good deal of his time between the historic Castilian cities of Toledo and Valladolid. Then, towards the middle of the sixteenth century, he began to make preparations for Madrid to receive his exalted person and the Spanish court on a more permanent basis. In 1537 he had the long-suffering Alcázar enlarged to twice its original size and restored to a standard worthy of a royal residence. Around 1551, the court was unofficially shifted from Toledo to Valladolid, a city favoured for its less extreme climate and abundant water supply. By then Madrid had grown to some 15,000 inhabitants living in 2,500 houses. At the time of Carlos’s death in 1558, the population had soared to 25,000, with people constantly pouring in from surrounding towns to seek their fortune close to the court and partake in the dynamic life of Castilla’s fastest-growing town. Of far greater importance for Madrid than the multitude of new arrivals was the spread of churches, monasteries and seminaries, all of which proclaimed Madrid’s status as a bastion of Catholic traditionalism. The Council of Trent was instituted in 1545 under Carlos I and came to a close in 1563 with his son Felipe II, the arch defender of the faith, on the throne. This commission of cardinals had been initiated by the Vatican to uphold the structures of the Church in response to the reformist currents of Protestant Europe. 33\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nWithin a very brief period, construction was started on a multiplicity of religious as well as grand civil edifices. The Real Basílica de Nuestra Señora de Atocha (Royal Basilica of Our Lady of Atocha), with a Dominican monastery attached, soon became Madrid’s most venerated place of worship.17 The parish church of San Luis Obispo was built next to the Puerta del Sol, but the building was gutted by fire in 1935. Carlos’s son Felipe founded the Augustine monastery of San Felipe el Real, dedicated to the saint whose name he bore. This also adjoined the Puerta del Sol, and was demolished in 1838 under the so-called Desamortización Eclesiástica (Ecclesiastical Confiscation) enacted by prime minister Juan Álvarez Mendizábal. In 1557 the widowed Princess Juana of Portugal founded the convent of Las Descalzas Reales near the Puerta del Sol, a veritable gem of classic Renaissance architecture, now a national monument whose museum contains priceless masterpieces by Titian, Rubens and Brueghel the Elder, as well as religious treasures. Madrid’s name as a repository of Christian heritage was thus secured throughout Spain. After the fall of Granada and the consolidation of the Reconquista, Spanish monarchs spent a good deal of their time migrating between Toledo, Valladolid and Madrid to conduct court affairs. Not only did these continual royal relocations create a climate of political instability in Castilla, which ranked as the undisputed centre of power, they also gave rise to a rivalry, indeed a mutual animosity, among the three chief towns of Christian Spain. Valladolid served as Carlos I’s capital for most of his reign. The city’s history was an illustrious one – it had been granted important commercial privileges as far back as the twelfth and thirteenth centuries by Alfonso VIII and Alfonso X. In 1469 Valladolid was chosen as the venue for the marriage of Fernando and Isabel, and it was also the birthplace of Felipe II and the site of Columbus’s first burial place.18 The city grew and prospered until 1561, when it was partially destroyed by fire, thus virtually knocking it out of the running to become the permanent capital of the newly unified Spain. That aside, Felipe was repelled by an outbreak of Lutheranism that had taken hold in the city’s recent past. Toledo, the other contender, left Madrid completely in the shade in terms 34\n\nA V E RY C AT H O L I C FA C E L IF T\n\nof history and culture. But from the monarch’s point of view Toledo suffered at least two serious drawbacks: on the one hand, the city had been a major Comunero stronghold in the 1520 uprising against the monarchy, thus provoking fears of lingering resentment against the king’s absolutist rule. More troubling was that its archbishop was the Primate of Spain, therefore making Toledo the seat of Spanish ecclesiastical power, thanks to which it also happened to be the second richest episcopal see after Rome. The Spanish Church and Crown as they existed at the time of the Counter-Reformation were perceived as inseparable, not least by those unfortunates accused of heresy, for the Inquisition was a religious institution under the control of the monarchy. The same could be said for the enemies of Spain in Europe and the Americas who were destined to feel the wrath of the Spanish tercios19 that waged war in the name of the cross. As far as the monarch was concerned, however, in temporal matters the Church was nothing but a troublesome meddler that, in exercising its moral authority, often posed a challenge to the Crown’s absolutist powers. In Toledo, the monarch and his court were always under the watchful and frequently reproachful eye of the Church.20 This left only one candidate in the running for the title of capital of Spain, and that was Madrid.\n\n35\n\n— 3 — a capital idea – but why?\n\nIn February 1561, edicts issued by the Concejo of Toledo attested to the fact that the city’s corporate body was the recognised agent of the Spanish Crown. By July of that year, decrees concerning state business were being promulgated in Madrid. What had transpired in this five-month interim to bring about Toledo’s demise? This is a matter of conjecture, for not a single document exists to explain the decision to shift the Spanish Empire’s official seat of power to Madrid. Five years earlier Carlos I, having grown weary of his worldly burden, transferred the title of Holy Roman Emperor to his brother Fernando. Carlos then retired to the secluded monastery of Yuste in the Gredos mountains of Extremadura, there to devote the remaining two years of his life to contemplation and prayer.1 The throne of Spain, the Spanish imperial dominions throughout Europe and the New World – all this went to his son, who reigned as Felipe II from 1558, the year of Carlos’s death. Ascetic, severe, bigoted, unattractive, fanatical, cruel – most historians would agree that Felipe answered faithfully to all these attributes, in character as well as appearance. In his defence, it could be said that Felipe was certainly no less attractive in appearance than his second wife, the dour-faced Mary I of England, a marriage that made her queen consort of Habsburg Spain, while Felipe was styled ‘King of England’. One has only to contemplate the great monastery of El Escorial, high in the hills 28 miles north of Madrid, to grasp how this tormented king was determined to hold his far-flung empire in 37\n\nm a d r i d : t h e h i s to ry\n\nan iron grip. Starkly imposing, almost threateningly so, the gigantic structure casts a grim shadow across the plain below, a pall that extended to Spanish possessions near and far. The monastery is as sinister as it is grandiose. Its architecture reveals sexual repressions, political ambitions and the peculiarity of character of the king who built it. Felipe’s personality impregnates the entire structure… El Escorial reflects Felipe’s desire to compare himself to the Christ figure. This is evident in the pale and blond crucified Christ in the cloister, physically identical to Felipe himself. The entire monastery is a condemnation of traditional magic, religious and sexual forces.2 The ‘sexual repressions’ detectable in the architecture stem perhaps from Felipe’s deep distress at the death of his uncle Juan, the son of the Reyes Católicos, whose passionate relationship with Margaret of Austria ended when Juan died in the act of making love to her. Felipe’s father Carlos I was determined to prevent his son from meeting a similar fate and charged his tutor to ration the young prince’s physical contact with his first wife, Maria of Portugal. El Escorial in this sense embodied Felipe’s resolve to stem the tide of Protestant heresy. The king engaged the celebrated Spanish architect Juan Bautista de Toledo to be his collaborator in the design of El Escorial. Together they erected a monument to Spain’s role as a centre of the Christian world, second only to Rome. The principles underlying the mathematical harmony obtained in the architecture of El Escorial were also applied to the selection of a capital. It seems that the move was not, at the time, intended to be permanent, but Madrid was conveniently close to the new palace of the Escorial, and it gradually came to be recognised as the capital of the monarchy. The town’s only claim to this particular honour lay in its geographical position as the mat"
