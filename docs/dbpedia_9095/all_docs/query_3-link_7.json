Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Curiel de Duero is essentially constant during July, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Curiel de Duero is essentially constant during July, remaining around 7.8 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on April 4, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 10.0 miles per hour, while on August 25, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.7 miles per hour.\n\nThe wind direction in Curiel de Duero during July is predominantly out of the west from July 1 to July 17 and from July 26 to July 31 and the north from July 17 to July 26.\n\nWind Direction in July in Curiel de Duero\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Curiel de Duero typically lasts for 7.0 months (215 days), from around April 10 to around November 12, rarely starting before March 21 or after May 2, and rarely ending before October 18 or after December 9.\n\nThe month of July in Curiel de Duero is reliably fully within the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in July in Curiel de Duero\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in July in Curiel de Duerogrowing seasongrowing seasongrowing seasonJul11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303031310%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%JunAug100%Jul 16100%Jul 16Jul 28100%Jul 28100%NowNowcoldcoolcomfortablewarmhot\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Curiel de Duero are rapidly increasing during July, increasing by 608Â°F, from 883Â°F to 1,491Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Curiel de Duero is essentially constant during July, remaining within 0.2 kWh of 7.9 kWh throughout.\n\nThe highest average daily incident shortwave solar energy during July is 8.1 kWh on July 10.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in July in Curiel de Duero\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Curiel de Duero are 41.643 deg latitude, -4.101 deg longitude, and 2,657 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Curiel de Duero contains significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 541 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 2,767 feet. Within 10 miles also contains significant variations in elevation (725 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (5,233 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Curiel de Duero is covered by cropland (76%) and shrubs (13%), within 10 miles by cropland (80%) and trees (11%), and within 50 miles by cropland (66%) and trees (23%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Curiel de Duero, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Curiel de Duero.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Curiel de Duero according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Curiel de Duero is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Curiel de Duero and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nValladolid Airport (LEVD, 53%, 39 mi, west, 115 ft elevation change)\n\nBurgos Villafria Airport (LEBG, 31%, 55 mi, northeast, 285 ft elevation change)\n\nAdolfo SuÃ¡rez MadridâBarajas Airport (LEMD, 16%, 84 mi, south, -659 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Curiel de Duero and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
