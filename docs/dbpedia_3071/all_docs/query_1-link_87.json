        "text": "The plot isn't that remarkable, but the incredible fight scenes make this more than worth the price of admission. Linda Stirling solidifies her reputation as one of the best serial heroines ever by being basically the co-hero instead of just a damsel in distress all the time. Roy Barcroft is appropriately evil as Captain Mephisto, reputedly his favorite serial role. Plus, his transformation scenes have spectacular old school FX. A bit of a sleeper due to the lack of recognizable masked heroes or obvious sci-fi, but a fun chapter play which will keep you guessing.\n\nDespite what the title and image on the poster might indicate, this isn’t a period piece. Instead, the plot revolves around a madman who, with the help of some electric-spinny-science machine, can turn himself into an exact replica of his ancestor, an evil pirate named “Captain Mephisto.”\n\nGod, I love that name.\n\nMephisto is played by Roy Barcroft. Barcroft considered the role to be his very best, and I’d have to agree. Captain Mephisto rules! He’s smug, and menacing, as Barcroft’s best baddies are, but also not afraid to throw himself into the action and get his hand dirty. Speaking of action, the endless fistfights have some energy back in them. Admittedly, the last few Republic serials were starting to lose me in that department, but the room-trashing brawls here are great. Really, the only downside is that Captain Mephisto doesn’t actually talk like a pirate. If he had, this would have gotten five stars."
