        "text": "Real Name: Don Diego Vega\n\nIdentity/Class: Normal human\n\nOccupation: Caballero\n\nAffiliations: Fray Felipe / Bernado, Sir Edmund Kendel, Toronada;\n\n(Topps / Image Comics) Lady Rawhide\n\nEnemies: Alcalde, Captain Ramon, Sergeant Gonzales, Don Luis Quintero\n\n(Topps / Image Comics) Dracula\n\nKnown Relatives: Alejandro Vega (father); Elena Felicidad (mother)\n\n(Son of Zorro, 1925) Don Q (son)\n\n(Zorro, the Gay Blade, 1980) Bunny Wigglesworth (brother)\n\n(Zorro and Son, 1983) Carlos de la Vega (son, a.ka. Zorro Jr.)\n\n(Mask of Zorro, 1998) Esperanza de la Vega (wife, deceased) Elena Montero (daughter), Alejandro Murrieta (son-in-law), Joaqu√≠n (grandson)\n\nAliases: The Fox, Diego de la Vega (amended name from the Disney TV version on)\n\nBase of Operations: Pueblo de Los Angeles, Southern California, c.1820s\n\nFirst Appearance: \"The Curse of Capistrano\", All-Story Weekly Volume 100, #2 (August 9th,1919)\n\nPowers/Abilities: A master swordsman, particularly good at fencing. He is also skilled with a whip. In addition he is a master horseman, extremely fit, and very acrobatic.\n\nHistory: Born in Madrid in 1793, Diego Vega emigrated to America with his parents Alejandro Vega and Elena Felicidad soon after his birth. They settled in California, becoming rich land owners, and although Diego returned to Spain to study art and science at Madrid University, and to learn fencing from the English knight Sir Edmund Kendel, he always considered California his home.\n\nBack in America things had taken a turn for the worse. The ruthless Alcalde gained power in California, and used his position of influence to exploit and rob the poor people of the area. Alerted to this by his father, Diego returned home. Knowing that open opposition might bring disaster down on his family, Diego passed himself off as a fop, while secretly adopting the masked identity of El Zorro (the Fox), a bandit in black upon the black stallion Toronada, who stood up for truth and justice against the oppressors. While his friend Felipe (a.k.a Bernado) pretended to be a deaf mute and thus spy on Alcalde for his master, Diego would venture out from the caves underneath his father's Hacienda to strike terror into his enemies.\n\nComments: Created by Johnston McCulley, a former newspaper crime reporter who had turned his hand to writing. The first Zorro story, The Curse of Capistrano debuted in 1919 in the pulp magazine All-Story Weekly. Though the original look (below, right) for the hero was slightly different from the one which he would become best known for, many of the major components were in place - the mask, cape and sword.\n\nCurse ended with Zorro unmasking (in the second to last chapter), and revealing to everyone in the pueblo of Los Angeles, as well as the readers, that the Fox was Don Diego. It seems clear that no sequel was planned. Perhaps this might have been Zorro's sole appearance, had Hollywood not intervened. In 1920 the silent movie, an adaption of Curse called The Mark of Zorro was made, with Douglas Fairbanks as the hero. Zorro became a household name, and the public demanded more adventures. Publishers Grosset and Dunlap re-released Curse under the title The Mark of Zorro to tie in with the movie. Two years later McCulley bowed to demands, and The Further Adventures of Zorro was released in Argosy Magazine. McCulley would continue to write Zorro stories on and off until his death in 1958, the year after the Walt Disney tv series which made his character a world-wide phenomenon debuted. The final story written by McCulley, The Mask of Zorro, was published after his death, early in 1959.\n\nZorro on the Printed Page\n\nProse\n\nIn all McCulley wrote some 65 additional tales of his masked rider spread over 40 years.

Following this, Tor Books released a short series of new, original stories\n\nZorro and the Jaguar Warriors by Jerome Preisler\n\nZorro and the Dragon Riders by David Bergantino\n\nZorro and the Witch's Curse by John Whitman\n\nThere was also a series of books aimed at younger readers, also kicked off by the 1998 movie:\n\nThe Secret Swordsman by William McKay\n\nSkull and Crossbones by Frank Lauria\n\nThe Treasure of Don Diego by William McKay\n\nSeven adventure novels for middle readers were written by Sandra Curtis, V.P. of Creative Development of Zorro Productions, Inc. The titles include:\n\nD.J.Arneson also re-wrote two of the original Zorro stories for younger readers:\n\nZorro and the Pirate Raiders (based on The Further Adventures of Zorro)\n\nZorro Rides Again (based on Zorro Rides Again)\n\nMoonstone Publishing recently announced plans for a new prose Zorro short story collection.\n\nComics\n\nIn 1949 Dell Comics brought out the first Zorro comics. Printed in Four-Color (which was eventually renamed Zorro), they initially adapted the novels. The Dell series is considered somewhat of a classic, with art by the great Alex Toth. Fifteen issues were produced, which have been reprinted in a hardback anthology in 1988 by Eclipse Comics as Complete Classic Adventures of Zorro, and in paperback anthology by Image Comics in 1999 under the same title.\n\nFour-Color #882\n\nFour-Color #920\n\nFour-Color #933\n\nFour-Color #960\n\nFour-Color #976\n\nFour-Color #1003\n\nFour-Color #1037\n\nZorro #8\n\nZorro #9\n\nZorro #10\n\nZorro #11\n\nZorro #12\n\nZorro #13\n\nZorro #14\n\nZorro #15\n\nA Summary of Zorro on the screen\n\nAs stated above, the 1920 Fairbanks' movie The Mark of Zorro was instrumental in giving the character the exposure it needed to ensure longevity, and as a direct result Zorro returned to the written page. Meanwhile in the cinema, Fairbanks also returned to the Zorro fold, this time playing Don Q, Son of Zorro. Others soon followed. Republic produced five serials between 1937 and 1949, while Tyrone Power donned the mask in a talkie remake of Fairbanks' The Mark of Zorro in 1940.\n\nZorro made it to television in 1957, when Walt Disney cast Guy Williams in the part. He played the part for three seasons and 82 half-hour episodes between 10th October 1957 and 2nd April 1961. Two cinema movies, edited together from episodes of the series, were released: The Sign of Zorro (1958) and Zorro, the Avenger (1960). The show made lasting alterations to the legend, changing Diego Vega to Diega de la Vega, and altering how he hid his identity - in the books everyone knew he was a good swordsman, so Diego acted as a boor and bigot, rude and snobbish to those below him in the social strata; in the series Diego was a likable but apparently ineffectual fop. Shown across the world, it's opening theme introduced Zorro to legions of new fans: \"Out of the night, when the full moon is bright, comes a horseman known as Zorro. This bold renegade carves a Z with his blade, a Z that stands for Zorro. Zorro, the fox so cunning and free. Zorro, who makes the sign of the Z.\" The show's success would have meant it went on longer, if not for a dispute between Disney and ABC.\n\nDisney's Zorro\n\nPresenting Senor Zorro\n\nZorro's Secret Passage\n\nZorro Rides to the Mission\n\nThe Ghost of the Mission\n\nZorro's Romance\n\nZorro Saves a Friend\n\nMonastario Sets a Trap\n\nZorro's Ride into Terror\n\nA Fair Trial\n\nGarcia's Secret Mission\n\nDouble Trouble for Zorro\n\nZorro, Luckiest Swordsman Alive\n\nThe Fall of Monastario\n\nShadow of Doubt\n\nGarcia Stands Accused\n\nSlaves of the Eagle\n\nSweet Face of Danger\n\nZorro Fights His Father\n\nDeath Stacks the Deck\n\nAgent Of The Eagle\n\nZorro Springs a Trap\n\nThe Unmasking of Zorro\n\nThe Secret of the Sierra\n\nThe New Commandante\n\nThe Fox and the Coyote\n\nAdios, Senor Magistrado\n\nThe Eagle's Brood\n\nZorro by Proxy\n\nQuintana Makes a Choice\n\nZorro Lights a Fuse\n\nThe Man with the Whip\n\nThe Cross of the Andes\n\nThe Deadly Bolas\n\nThe Well of Death\n\nThe Tightening Noose\n\nThe Sergeant Regrets\n\nThe Eagle Leaves the Nest\n\nBernardo Faces Death\n\nThe Eagle's Flight\n\nWelcome to Monterey (Start of Season 2)\n\nZorro Rides Alone\n\nHorse of Another Color\n\nThe Senorita Makes a Choice\n\nRendezvous at Sundown\n\nThe New Order\n\nAn Eye for an Eye\n\nZorro and the Flag of Truce\n\nAmbush\n\nThe Practical Joker\n\nThe Flaming Arrow\n\nZorro Fights a Duel\n\nAmnesty for Zorro\n\nThe Runaways\n\nThe Iron Box\n\nThe Gay Caballero\n\nTornado Is Missing\n\nZorro Versus Cupid\n\nThe Legend of Zorro\n\nSpark of Revenge\n\nThe Missing Father\n\nPlease Believe Me\n\nThe Brooch\n\nZorro and the Mountain Man\n\nThe Hound of the Sierras\n\nManhunt\n\nThe Man from Spain\n\nTreasure for the King\n\nExposing the Tyrant\n\nZorro Takes a Dare\n\nAn Affair of Honor\n\nThe Sergeant Sees Red\n\nInvitation to Death\n\nThe Captain Regrets\n\nMasquerade for Murder\n\nLong Live the Governor\n\nThe Fortune Teller\n\nSenor China Boy\n\nFinders Keepers\n\nEl Bandido (start of Season 3)\n\nAdios El Cuchillo\n\nThe Postponed Wedding\n\nAuld Acquaintance\n\nIn 1992 Disney colourised the entire series, and re-released it.\n\nNew Adventures of Zorro\n\nMade by Filmation, and aired as part of 1981's Tarzan/Lone Ranger/Zorro Adventure Hour, with Henry Darrow providing the hero's voice, the first Zorro cartoon only had a short run of thirteen episodes between 12th September and 5th December.\n\nThree Is a Crowd\n\nFlash Flood\n\nThe Blockade\n\nThe Frame\n\nTurnabout\n\nThe Tyrant\n\nTerremoto\n\nThe Trap\n\nFort Ramon\n\nThe Take Over\n\nDouble Trouble\n\nThe Conspiracy\n\nThe Mysterious Traveler\n\nZorro\n\nA co-production between America's New World Television, France's Ellipse and Italy's RAI, the international Zorro series lasted for four seasons and eighty-eight episodes between 5th January 1990 and 2nd December 1992.
