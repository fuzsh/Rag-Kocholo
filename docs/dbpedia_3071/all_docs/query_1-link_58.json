        "text": "Reaction Paper:\n\nMovie Flick: The Count of Monte Cristo\n\nDon Diego de la Vega: There is a saying, a very old saying: when the pupil is ready the master will appear.\n\nCan you discuss the history of the film?\n\nDon Diego de la Vega: This is called a training circle, a master’s wheel. This circle will be your world, your whole life. Until I tell you otherwise, there is nothing outside of it.\n\nAlejandro Murrieta: Capitan Love is…\n\nDon Diego de la Vega: There is NOTHING outside of it. Captain Love does not exist until I say he exists. As your skill with the sword improves, you will progress to a smaller circle. With each new circle, your world contracts, bringing you that much closer to your adversary, that much closer to retribution.\n\nAlejandro Murrieta: I like that part.\n\nThe Story of Zorro\n\nOne of the more enduring heroes of modern literature and film has been Robin Hood, who has become famous for “stealing from the rich and giving to the poor”. The Robin Hood legend, one of a skilled fighter who strives to overcome the unfair oppression of the people by a tyrant, is an easy one for fans to identify with. It’s not surprising that there have been several variations on this theme, with one of the most successful being Zorro.\n\nZorro, which is Spanish for “fox”, is the story of a masked rider who battles the unjust rulers of the pueblo of Los Angeles during the days of Spanish rule. His real identity is that of Don Diego de la Vega, the son of a wealthy landowner. Diego returns from his studies in Spain and discovers that Los Angeles is under the command of Capitan Monastario, a cruel man who relishes in the misuse of his power for personal gain. Knowing that he cannot hope to single-handedly defeat Monastario and his troops, Diego resorts to subterfuge. He adopts the secret identity of Zorro, a sinister figure dressed in black, and rides to fight Monastario’s injustice.\n\nZorro was created by writer Johnston McCulley, seen here showing one of his books to actor Guy Williams. The first Zorro story, The Curse of Capistrano, appeared in 1919 in All-Star Weekly, which later became Argosy magazine. More than 65 Zorro books and short stories were to follow, with an estimated 500 million readers around the world following the masked avenger’s exploits in 26 languages, before McCulley’s death on November 22, 1958 at age 75.\n\nWith that sort of reader interest, it was inevitable that the Zorro story be made into a film. In fact, there have been many filmed versions, beginning with Douglas Fairbanks Sr.’s portrayal of Zorro in the 1920 silent production The Mark of Zorro. Tyrone Power scored a huge hit with a 1940 remake of that film, and several other Zorro films and serials were also produced over the years.\n\nWalt becomes interested in Zorro\n\nIn 1950, Johnston McCulley assigned the film and television rights to Zorro to Mitchell Gertz, a Hollywood agent. Gertz tried for several years to find the financing to produce a Zorro series, but to no avail. Then, in 1952, Walt Disney became involved in the Zorro legend when he was looking for a source of financing for his new theme park. He used his private research company, WED Enterprises, to license the rights to the Zorro stories from Gertz, planning to produce a number of episodes and use the resulting profits for developing the Park. A separate company, Zorro Productions, was set up in 1953 as part of Walt Disney Incorporated for this new venture.\n\nWork began on the series, including some preliminary story ideas and costume sketches. A good deal of effort when into buying antique furnishings that would have been used on the sets, but sadly the project never made it past these early stages. At first, Walt tried to sell the show to anyone who was interested, but when the networks insisted on a pilot episode and he refused, work was halted on the project.\n\nHappily, as events unfolded, the Zorro series proved later to be a viable project despite this early setback. Walt had continued working on the Disneyland theme park project, and eventually reached an agreement with the ABC television network to help finance it if he would produce a weekly series for them. In 1954 the industry trade papers carried several stories speculating that Zorro would be part of the packaging for ABC’s investment in the Park, but the network instead eventually decided on the Disneyland anthology series. For a time, the Zorro project was dead yet again, but not for long.\n\nBy 1957 Disneyland had proven to be a huge success, but Walt wasn’t satisfied with it and wanted to expand the Park. Once again he turned to ABC for financing, and once again they agreed if he would produce another television series. Sadly, these negotiations would later prove to be the basis for a major lawsuit between Disney and ABC over the ownership rights to the series. Things still looked good in 1957, though, and five years after Walt had acquired the rights, Zorro was finally headed to television. Walt formally turned over his personal rights to the series to the Studio, best known as Walt Disney Productions, and work began on putting the show into production.\n\nCasting the series\n\nBy this time, the Disney name was a proven ratings draw, and no pilot was needed. Walt immediately set to work on a search for someone to play Zorro, knowing full well that whoever he picked, comparisons to Tyrone Power were inevitable. This was a much sought after role, for Disney’s success with Davy Crockett was not lost on a host of other actors who could only dream of being the Studio’s next Fess Parker. More than 20 actors were tested for the part, including Hugh O’Brian, John Lupton, Jack Kelly, Dennis Weaver and David Janssen. On April 18, 1957, the Studio held a screen test for a relatively unknown actor named Guy Williams. When Walt saw the results, he knew he had found his Zorro.\n\nGuy Williams, whose real name was Armand Joseph Catalano, was born on January 14, 1924 in New York. The family nicknamed him “Armando,” which he used until he went into acting. After school, he worked as a male model with moderate success in the advertising field, then came to the attention of MGM and later Universal-International Studios, which put him under contract in 1952. Although he appeared in films such as Bonzo Goes to College, Mississippi Gambler, Seven Angry Men, Sincerely Yours, I Was A Teenage Werewolf, The Last Frontierand Man From the Alamo, Williams’ parts were relatively small and it looked like his hopes of becoming a leading man were in vain. By the time Disney found the 6’3″ 190-pound actor, Williams was almost ready to give up his acting career. Luckily for Williams, he auditioned for the role of Zorro, and to his astonishment, he found himself the star of a network series.\n\nWilliams proved to be an excellent choice for the demanding dual roles of Don Diego and Zorro. Already an accomplished fencer, he seemed born for the part, handling the required comedy, drama, and action scenes with great success. While Williams was perfect for the role, the series also turned out to be perfect for Williams, paying him $2,500 per week, plus additional amounts for personal appearances and merchandise royalties.\n\nThroughout his exploits, Diego could always count on the assistance of his faithful manservant, Bernardo. Bernardo, who was mute, decided to help Diego by pretending to be deaf as well. This allowed Bernardo to secretly listen in on conversations and report back to Diego. Bernardo also came to the rescue several times by dressing as Zorro, which allowed Diego to be seen in the same place as Zorro, thereby eliminating suspicion that he might be the masked avenger.\n\nBernardo was played by Gene Sheldon, who brought his past experience as a pantomimist to his portrayal of the silent servant. A versatile performer with experience in radio, vaudeville, Broadway and films, Sheldon was signed to a long-term contract for Zorro which eventually led to several other films for the Studio.\n\nSheldon was so good in his part as the mute Bernardo that many viewers came to believe that the actor was really unable to speak. This was reinforced when Sheldon appeared as yet another mute character in the Disney film Babes in Toyland. Sheldon was quite capable of speaking and had actually worked as a radio announcer before going into acting. He also did an amusing comedy banjo routine that was later used on an episode of the Disneyland anthology series.\n\nAnother important character was Sergeant Garcia, the second-in-command of the pueblo. Garcia was a fairly comedic character, due in part to his rotund physique. He provided a welcome relief to the sinister commanders of the garrison, and as the series progressed, he developed a certain kinship with Zorro. While he tried his best to be a good soldier, Garcia could always be counted on to let his voracious appetite or appreciation of liquor to get the best of him. The villains in the series took note of this, and Garcia accidentally would become a problem for Zorro over and over again.\n\nGarcia was played by Henry Calvin, whose real name was Wimberly Calvin Goodman. Calvin, a native of Dallas, had performed on Broadway in Kismet and several other plays, and had hosted his own radio series on NBC in 1950. The 6’2″ actor weighed in at an impressive 340 pounds, and needed to use a special razor to maintain Garcia’s stubbly beard.\n\nCalvin was an important part of the series, and another example of the masterful casting that had been done for the primary characters. It’s hard to imagine that the show would have been anywhere near as successful as it was without the hapless Sergeant Garcia and his many efforts to catch the elusive Zorro.\n\nCompleting the regular characters on the series was Don Alejandro de la Vega, Diego’s father. Alejandro was one of the wealthiest and most prominent of the citizens of Los Angeles, and many of the local peasants and landowners turned to him for help and guidance. It was Alejandro who first summoned Diego back home to help stop the evil Monastario in his quest for power, thereby inadvertently beginning Zorro’s career. For most of the series, Alejandro didn’t know that Diego was secretly Zorro, and his son’s apparent cowardice caused friction within the family.\n\nThe part of Don Alejandro was played by veteran character actor George J. Lewis, who had a long film and television career prior to Zorro, often as a villain. Born in Mexico, Lewis actually spoke English without an accent and had to affect one for his role as Alejandro. Interestingly enough, Lewis had once donned a Zorro costume himself! He co-starred in the 12-part Republic Pictures serial Zorro’s Black Whip (1944), which starred Linda Stirling as Barbara Meredith. When her crime fighting brother died, Barbara took on the role of the “Black Whip”, a successor to Zorro. At one point, Lewis, who was cast as her boyfriend, donned the outlaw’s costume to protect her secret.\n\nOne very important member of the cast didn’t even get his name in the credits. Besides the distinctive black costume and his skill with a sword, Zorro relied on his trusty horse, Tornado, to aid in him in his battles. Tornado was usually played by Diamond Decorator, a seven-year-old quarter horse, with three stand-ins used to perform the horse’s various stunts. One horse specialized in Tornado’s dramatic rearing, as seen in the opening credits, one was used in fight scenes, and the third for high-speed running. Diamond Decorator also was used for many of Guy’s personal appearances as Zorro, being well behaved despite the distractions of the eager fans.\n\nDiamond Decorator had an interesting history beside his role on Zorro. The horse competed in the Grand Nationals Medal Class in the 1950’s with fourteen consecutive show wins.\n\nPreparing for the series\n\nWhile casting was underway, the Studio was also working on the logistics of turning back the clock to the early days of Los Angeles. In June 1955, workers started building the series’ permanent sets, which included the buildings of the Pueblo La Reina de Los Angeles and the soldier’s cuartel, or stockade. These were the Studio’s first permanent sets, and cost more than $100,000 to construct. Disney also spent $35,000 on furnishings and $30,000 on additional props, helping to bring the pre-production costs to a total of $208,000. All of this was expensive, helping to make Zorro the most expensive western television series to date, but the quality was obvious on the screen, helping to set the mood for the masked adventurer’s heroics.\n\nWhile the costs to get ready for the series were high, so were the costs for each episode. Disney set a budget of between $50,000 and $100,000 for each 30-minute show, and the first season of 39 episodes was to eventually cost $3,198,000. When Disney was studying the television marketplace in 1950, the average cost for a 1-hour drama series was only $13,840 – and here was Walt spending an average for $82,000 for a show only half as long. Once again, Walt was setting his own standards.\n\nEven with these lofty budgets, Disney did try to contain costs where it wouldn’t show on the air. One method was to shoot portions of up to four episodes at the same time if they used common sets. Guy Williams commented at the time that “(It’s) a little confusing at times. Not remembering the dialogue, but remembering what led up to it. Sometimes I’m real blank and we have to go back and read scenes we’ve already filmed.”\n\nWilliams also had to deal with a rigorous training schedule designed to turn the former model into a dashing hero. Although he had previously done some fencing, it was decided that Williams needed some intensive brush-up work if he was to be convincing on the screen. The Studio hired Fred Cavens, the fencing coach who had earlier coached Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and Tyrone Power for their Zorro outings, to tutor Williams and the rest of the cast.\n\nOut of the night,\n\nwhen the full moon is bright…\n\nThere were other lessons to attend besides the fencing sessions. The part of Don Diego called for Williams to play the guitar as he serenaded young señoritas, but unfortunately, Williams could neither play the guitar nor sing. Despite a series of lessons from guitar instructor Vicente Gomez, Williams never mastered the skills required and his singing was dubbed by Bill Lee, who was also one of the singers of the series’ theme song.\n\nIn addition to Don Diego’s love songs, music played an important part throughout the series. Composer William Lava wrote a different musical theme for each of the show’s main characters, similar to the technique used in Peter and the Wolf. These brief themes were played when the characters were on the screen, and they helped to set the mode for the action to follow. When the bumbling Sergeant Garcia entered a scene, for example, a lively piece of music in the background foreshadowed the events to come.\n\nThe most important piece of music, though, was the series’ theme song. A relatively short song, it would become one of the best known television themes of all time. It was written by Norman Foster (words) and George Bruns (music).\n\nOut of the night,\n\nwhen the full moon is bright,\n\ncomes the horseman known as Zorro.\n\nThis bold renegade\n\ncarves a Z with his blade,\n\na Z that stands for Zorro.\n\nZorro, Zorro, the fox so cunning and free,\n\nZorro, Zorro, who makes the sign of the Z.\n\nZorro, Zorro, Zorro, Zorro, Zorro.\n\nWalt used the popularity of his Disneyland anthology series to help promote the new Zorro series. On September 11, 1957 the episode The Fourth Anniversary Show provided audiences with their first glimpse of Guy Williams as Zorro. Although the segment was a brief one, it helped generate a tremendous amount of interest in the series before it took to the air on October 10, 1957.\n\nThe Fourth Anniversary Show was also the first time that the theme song was heard. Soon, people across the country were singing along, and not long after the show debuted, the first of many recordings of the theme appeared on the market. While it might have been expected that the quartet who sang the song for the series (Thurl Ravenscroft, Bill Lee, Bob Stevens and Max Smith) might have had the honor of being first on the market, it was actually Henry Calvin who rushed out the first version. Many other versions followed, but the most popular was that of the Chordettes, quickly climbing into the Top 20. All together, more than 1,000,000 copies of the theme were sold during the two year run of the series.\n\nA merchandising bonanza\n\nAs soon as Zorro hit the air, children began imitating their new hero, pretending they were master swordsmen and scrawling “Z’s” everywhere one looked. This juvenile vandalism was far reaching – a popular news story of the time told how Williams discovered a large “Z” scratched into the paint on his new car.\n\nThe new fans also began dressing the part, and the Studio had foreseen just this possibility. Disney had already lined up a number of merchandise licensees, and Zorro costumes, swords and bullwhips quickly soared to the top of many a youngster’s wish lists.\n\nGuy Williams’ contract called for him to receive 2.5% of any Zorro merchandise sales. Just as Fess Parker had enjoyed a financial windfall when Davy Crockett merchandise sales soared, Williams was to find this clause a very profitable one. Many of the licensees who had enjoyed success withCrockett and Mickey Mouse Club merchandise quickly signed up for Zorro contracts, with more than 500 items being licensed. Some of the largest licensees and their products were:\n\nLido Toy Co. – TV play set\n\nChester H. Roth Co. – socks\n\nE-Z Mills – pajamas\n\nMorris Belt and Suspender Co. – leather belt, satin tie\n\nHassenfeld Brothers – oil paint set\n\nLouis Marx and Co. – toys, play sets\n\nBen Cooper, Inc. – playsuits\n\nU.S. Time Corp. – watches\n\nWhitman Publishing Co. – puzzles, games, coloring books\n\nIn addition to a massive wave of traditional print and television advertising, the Studio was also able to promote the series and be paid for it at the same time! They created a new character, “Little Zorro”, and used him in the daily Mickey Mouse comic strip which appeared in more than 100 newspapers across the country. “Little Zorro” is all but forgotten today, but at the time it was a wonderful example of Disney’s famed corporate synergy and marketing prowess.\n\nSponsorship\n\nWith the number of advertisements that appear in television shows these days, it’s somewhat hard to believe that Zorro only had two sponsors, the 7-Up soft drink company and the AC Spark Plug Division of General Motors. Many series aired during the 1950s actually were owned and sponsored by advertising companies, so it was not all that unusual a practice back then for most, or even all, of the commercials in a show to come from just one company. Interest in Zorro was so high, though, that the Studio was able to land two lucrative contracts to fund the expensive series.\n\nWalt went all out in his effort to obtain 7-Up’s backing, including an appearance in a film made for the soft drink bottlers and their distributors. Cracking Zorro’s whip for emphasis, Walt explained the premise of the series, using models of the as-of-yet unbuilt outdoor sets, as well as samples of the costumes. The sales pitch was successful and 7-Up agreed to participate in a series of joint promotions with Disney, not all tied in with Zorro. For example, Annette and Roberta Shore were seen promoting The Shaggy Dog with a toast of 7-Up in publicity photos and ads.\n\nReflecting the hopes that Zorro would appeal to a broad audience and not just children, the Studio also signed up the AC Spark Plug Division. Although there were two sponsors, each wanted to be specifically identified with the series, so Disney took a unique approach. Instead of having commercials from both firms each week, the sponsors alternated weeks, with a brief word from “your alternate sponsor” making sure that each company shared in the weekly success.\n\nBoth firms used animated characters in their commercials. The most successful of these was 7-Up’s Fresh- up Freddie, a feisty rooster in a Zorro costume. At first, Freddie didn’t have a name, but when the show’s popularity took off, the advertisers decided to take advantage of the attention and began promoting Freddie himself. Freddie became a celebrity in his own right, receiving fan mail, and stuffed dolls were made available. 7-Up sponsored a monthly Zorro Newsletter for dealers, with a circulation of 10,000 copies per month, often featuring a Freddie doll in publicity photos with the stars of the series.\n\nAlmost forgotten today are the AC characters, Alan Cranbroke and Cynthia Aldrich. This animated couple was joined by live spokesperson Gordon Mills, who settled their domestic arguments and just happened to throw in a mention of AC’s products in the process.\n\nZorro meets his fans\n\nJust as Fess Parker and the Mouseketeers toured the country to promote their shows, Guy Williams saddled up to promote Zorro. One of his most popular venues was rodeos, where he received $2,500 to ride around the arena dressed as Don Diego. Williams found that the public was fickle when he appeared as the Grand Marshal in the 1958 Portland Rose Parade. He refused to ride a horse down the parade route, stating that he never rode a horse if he didn’t know it’s temperament. He rode instead in a car, disappointing fans along the way. A local newspaper then printed a picture of a five-year old riding the horse, and an embarrassed Williams replied that he had refused over concerns about how the horse would react to the crowd, not over fear for his personal safety. Later, Williams was quoted as saying he was careful around horses as he had broken his shoulder trying to learn how to ride Tornado, but other articles placed the event back in 1953, well before he landed the role of Zorro. Luckily, Williams weathered this minor controversy and his popularity remained intact.\n\nIn typical Disney fashion, Walt also used the cast of Zorro in a very successful cross promotion with a series of live appearances at Disneyland. Large newspaper ads touted the appearance of Guy Williams, Henry Calvin, Gene Sheldon and Britt Lomond at the Park, with the first shows held April 26-27, 1958 and a second outing on May 30 to June 1. In addition to parades each day, the stars also appeared in four shows daily. Three of the shows featured a running battle between Zorro and Monastario on the rooftops of Frontierland, with his foes ending up in the river. The fourth show each day was held in Frontierland’s “Magnolia Park”, with Williams appearing as Don Diego. The reaction was so positive that a third series of appearances was held November 27-30 for Thanksgiving weekend, but without Lomond, who was unable to attend. Williams also returned to Disneyland for another series of personal appearances for Christmas 1958.\n\nZorro enjoyed a very successful season, averaging 35.7% of the viewing audience each evening, and an estimated 35 million viewers saw the show each week. Every series that went up against Zorro this year found itself canceled; on CBS, it was Harbor Master and Richard Diamond, and on NBC, You Bet Your Life.\n\nThe success of Zorro prompted the Studio to take a page from its Davy Crockett book. Portions of the first 13 Zorro episodes were edited into the feature film The Sign of Zorro, released overseas in 1958 and domestically in 1960. While the film only did moderate business domestically, it was another story overseas. The series had not yet aired there, and with new audiences ready for the adventures of Zorro, it achieved yet another success for Disney.\n\nThe second season\n\nHaving enjoyed a very successful first season, it was no surprise that Zorro was renewed for a second year. Like many other series, there would be a number of changes made in the look of the series to reflect viewer comments and economic realities. One of the first changes made was a move away from the first season’s rigid format of using 13 episodes for each story. As story editor Lowell S. Hawley noted at the time “Now we play stories for what they’re worth. If a writer has material enough for three, four or five episodes, we let it go at that.” This allowed for a greater number of stories, but also helped to solve a problem common to serialized series. If a viewer were to miss one of the early episodes in one of the first season stories, it was possible that they would not want to jump into the storyline midway through. Breaking the season into a number of shorter stories made it easier for viewers to miss a week and still be able to understand what was going on when they next watched the show.\n\nThe Studio also made a casting change for the second year in the hopes of attracting more woman viewers. One of the criticisms of the first season was Don Diego’s lack of interest in the opposite sex, for he was always more interested in chasing yet another villain than in chasing women. Actress Jolene Brand was hired for the part of Anna Maria Verdugo, a local wealthy señorita. Anna Maria was set to appear in nine of the first 13 episodes, allowing the Studio to assess audience reaction without having to commit to hiring Brand for the entire season. Evidently she didn’t make a major impact, for the character was dropped and Don Diego went back to being his unromantic self.\n\nAnother change came with a new opening sequence beginning with the January 22, 1959 episode. Instead of using a stock opening each week as had been done up to then, now each show used scenes from that week’s episode in a bid to attract viewers who might be flipping channels and come across the show. Announcer Dick Tufeld provided narration for both the new opening scenes and for previews of next week’s episode.\n\nAll of the changes proved successful, for the ratings increased and Zorro moved ahead to take 38.9% of the audience each evening. The year saw the cancellation of two more series on NBC, Ed Wynn and Steve Canyon, and Zorro steadily outdrew CBS’ December Bride. Overall, Zorro knocked five of the seven series to face it off the air.\n\nThe Studio also released another theatrical compilation of several episodes. Zorro, The Avenger, was only released overseas, and was not seen in the United States until it was eventually aired on The Disney Channel.\n\nOne other interesting Disney footnote concerns several of the second season episodes. Like many other young women, Annette Funicello developed a crush on Guy Williams, but unlike all the others, she was able to fulfill her fantasy. As a present for her 16th birthday, Walt cast her in several episodes as Anita Cabrillo, a new arrival in the pueblo with a mysterious past.\n\nThe battle with ABC begins\n\nUnfortunately, Zorro was to come up against a foe even he could not hope to defeat – the American legal system. Disney and ABC became locked in a bitter series of legal challenges over the ownership of the weekly anthology series, The Mickey Mouse Club and Zorro. Unable to come to terms, Walt decided to pull Zorro off the air, despite the high ratings the series was sure to receive if were to return for a third season.\n\nWhile the legal maneuvers went on, Disney aired four hour-long Zorro episodes on the anthology series to help keep public interest alive in the character. Walt even used Annette Funicello again in one of them, The Postponed Wedding, in an effort to capitalize on her popularity. Walt also kept Williams on full salary for two years, but by the time the legal issues were finally settled out of court, Walt decided that the public had moved on to other fads and there would be no point in resurrecting Zorro.\n\nDespite this decision, Disney retained the rights to Zorro, paying the Gertz estate $3,500 a year for the privilege. It wasn’t until 1967 that the Studio finally relinquished their rights to Zorro.\n\nZorro in syndication\n\nAlthough Zorro was no longer shown in the United States the series continued to air for several years in many overseas markets. The show was particularly popular in Australia, where it ran for several years. This success did not go unnoticed back at the Studio, which decided there was still a strong enough interest back home to take the show out of the film vault. Zorro returned to the American airwaves in syndication, a new market for Disney, beginning with the 1965-66 season. The original network run of the series had attracted an estimated 35 million viewers, and the demographics had been high in the desired age groups, making it relatively easy for Disney to sell the show in the syndicated market.\n\nPlanning to keep costs to a minimum, the Studio split the stations into three sets of prints, “A”, “B” and “C”, which were then rotated between the stations. To do so, they had to drop the first two episodes, Presenting Señor Zorro and Zorro’s Secret Passage, as those stations that started with the “B” or “C” series of prints would have confused viewers if they had shown Zorro’s origin part way through the season. The gap was filled by taking two episodes from the show’s second season, Señor China Boy and The Iron Box, and using them in the “A” set of shows. Other than this switch, the Studio needed to do very little work, for the first network season had been divided into three 13-part stories in the first place.\n\nA total of 43 stations signed up for the series, which began airing September 8, 1965. The Studio had high hopes for the syndication effort, expecting that it would help sell more Zorro merchandise. Also hoping that more stations would sign up, Disney made a considerable effort to promote the series. Many of the companies that had enjoyed successful sales of Zorro products took out new licenses, and several newcomers signed up to offer a wide variety of items. Disney pumped out a steady stream of Zorro books and records, mainly re-issues of items from the ABC run, and even brought back the “Little Zorro” character.\n\nThe first year of syndication went well and Zorro returned for a second year in syndication in 1966. The two network second season episodes that had been used to fill out the first syndicated season were replaced by splitting one of the anthology Zorro episodes into two parts, and once again, the series was very profitable for the Studio. In fact, there was serious thought to starting production on new episodes, but a look at the costs involved soon quashed that idea.\n\nLife after Zorro\n\nAfter the last of the anthology Zorro episodes had aired, Walt lost interest in the character, and in 1967, the Studio decided not to renew its option and let the rights revert to the Gertz estate. With the syndicated run over, Zorro became just another canceled television series.\n\nFollowing his role as Zorro, Guy Williams only appeared in one other Disney project, the television show The Prince and the Pauper. The Studio tried to find suitable film roles for Williams, but eventually decided not to renew his contract. After he left the Disney payroll, Williams worked in a number of film and television roles. For a time, he was slated to replace Pernell Roberts on Bonanza when Roberts left the series seeking his fame in the movies, and he appeared in several episodes to test the character. When that effort didn’t work out, he worked sporadically until he was signed to star as Professor John Robinson in the science fiction series Lost in Space.\n\nAfter several years of playing an increasingly diminishing role in that series, Williams left show business and Los Angeles. He had appeared in Argentina several years earlier to promote Zorro and had enjoyed the public attention and lifestyle there. He moved to Buenos Aires and bought property in the country, opening a cattle ranch. He rarely returned to the United States, although in 1975, it appeared that he might once again do so to don the Zorro mask. Press reports claimed Williams was to star in a new film, Grandson of Zorro, but the project never came to be.\n\nIn 1982, word circulated yet again that Williams was to play Zorro once more. The Studio was starting work on a comedy version, Zorro and Son, and they were very interested in getting Williams to reprise his role as Don Diego and Zorro. At first, Williams indicated that he was indeed interested, but when he saw the scripts, he quickly decided to back out of the project. Zorro and Son did go ahead, but without Williams, who had returned home to Buenos Aires.\n\nIt was there that Guy Williams died alone, sometime in late April or early May, 1989, at age 65. Neighbors noticed that they hadn’t seen him for several days, and police found him dead of natural causes in his apartment. His passing received major coverage back in the U.S., for it seemingly marked the end of an era. Zorro wasn’t finished yet, however. In addition to Zorro and Son, the masked avenger gained new audiences when the original episodes were screened repeatedly on The Disney Channel. After several runs in the original black-and-white format, the series gained a new generation of viewers when Disney successfully colorized the series, thereby making it more appealing to today’s audiences. Thirty years after Zorro first rode to fight injustice, he continues to attract new fans, who once again love to make the “sign of the Z”.\n\n2. How does The Mask of Zorro apply the Spielbergian visual wit to the classic swashbuckler?\n\nAlejandro Murrieta: [whispering to his baby son] And so it was. Lighting split the sky, thunder shook the earth, and then all was quiet. The great warrior known as Zorro was gone. The people of the land gave him a hero’s funeral, the largest anyone had ever seen. They came from far and wide to say farewell to their brave and noble champion. But don’t worry, little Joaquin. Whenever great deeds are remembered, your grandfather will live on. For there must always, always be a Zorro. And some day, when he’s needed, we will see him again… on his fearsome steed Tornado, riding like the wind, his sword blazing in the sun… leaping, jumping, swinging through the air… fighting like a lion. Fighting like a tiger. Fighting…\n\n[sees Elena watching him]\n\nAlejandro Murrieta: … as safely as possible.\n\nElena: Is this your idea of putting the baby to sleep?\n\nThe Mask Of Zorro (1998)\n\nMany filmmakers have attempted to emulate Steven Spielberg; it’s an occupational hazard of being the most commercially successful movie director of all time. But few of these imitations, even those shepherded by Spielberg himself as an executive producer, have approximated his pop sensibility as surely and satisfyingly as The Mask Of Zorro. Director Martin Campbell, an able journeyman who occasionally resembles a contemporary Michael Curtiz when he connects with the right material, competently mimics Spielberg’s flair for swift, Rube Goldberg-infused stunts that follow a minutely intricate physical chain reaction to an explosive punchline. When Zorro seizes several soldiers’ drawn guns with his whip, for instance, the firearms are diverted so that they point to the opposing side of the screen to inadvertently fire, killing another rampaging bad guy who was fixing to do the hero in from an altogether different vantage point. This tumbling-dominoes approach to set pieces particularly benefits the witty and exciting sword fights, which—like Spielberg’s action films—strike just the right balance between kinetic pathos and slapstick.\n\nCampbell lacks Spielberg’s amazingly fluid ability to fashion images in which the various planes of the screen comment on one another at once. The Mask Of Zorro’s compositions, though beautiful, are simpler, probably partially by design so as to evoke the spirit of the various swashbucklers to which it obviously owes its existence. Campbell pivotally manages, however, to capture the sense of actor camaraderie visible in Spielberg’s early adventure films. Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Banderas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stuart Wilson, and L.Q. Jones all have phenomenal chemistry, which invests The Mask Of Zorro with a galloping romantic spirit that’s on seriously short supply in big-budget genre films these days.\n\nThere’s also the infectious Spielberginess of the film’s plot, which is a mashup ofThe Count Of Monte Cristo, Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom, and Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade. Zorro (Hopkins) is an aging freedom fighter combating Spain in the Mexican War of Independence who’s imprisoned when a dastardly Spanish governor (Wilson) discovers his true identity. Escaping 20 years later, Zorro takes a protégé (Banderas), whom he trains in his makeshift Batcave/Phantom Of The Opera lair, and the two settle their various grudges while thwarting a campaign to steal California from Mexico, which involves a slavery ring resembling the evil temple from the second Jones film. Along the way, Zorro and his friend bicker and forge a poignant father-son bond that will be familiar to fans of the third Jones outing (in fact, Sean Connery was originally in talks to play the role that went to Hopkins). Yet the derivations don’t stick out, because the filmmakers ably hit the chalk marks sketched by their cinematic godfather two decades prior, heeding the most important lesson that Spielberg imparted to the American pop film: Genre tropes are only as powerful as the flair and enthusiasm driving them.\n\n3.What do you think is the most awkward scene in the film?\n\nDon Diego de la Vega: You have passion, Alejandro, and your skill is growing. But to enter Montero’s world, I must give you something which is completely beyond your reach.\n\nAlejandro Murrieta: Ah, yes? And what is that?\n\nDon Diego de la Vega: Charm.\n\nThat one scene in the Mask of Zorro movie in which Zorro cutting off Elena Montero’s dress is so ingrained in pop culture that the entire scene has its own entry on Wikipedia, oddly that’s not the weirdest part of this entry, no, the weirdest part is that both people in that scene later admitted to being really turned on by it.\n\nYes, both Antonio “Puss In Boots” Banderas and Catherine “is she still dating that old guy?” Zeta-Jones have expressed in interviews about their involvement with the classic 90’s movie that they were both aroused by the entire scene. Like, reallyaroused, which if we’re honest, we could kind of tell from Zeta-Jones’ reaction, but it’s still kind of weird.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with E!, (boy is that going to play hell with our spellchecker) the pair both admitted that the entire scene was incredibly arousing for them. Note that we didn’t say “romantic” or “not at all rapey” back there, which is kind of important because as far as we can tell, Elena should have been terrified during that scene. She was just attacked by a masked man with a sword who literally just cut off all of her clothes, what part of that is arousing? The part where he could have nicked an artery? The part where he threatened to stab her in the neck? Seriously, since when was “erotic sword play” considered an integral part of turning a woman on and where can we sign a petition to have it taught in schools?\n\nAccording to the interview, Banderas was aroused by Zeta-Jones’ beauty while Zeta-Jones was turned on by Zorro’s curious way of undressing her character. We’re not sure why exactly Banderas thought he needed a sword in his hand to appreciate a buxom naked actress, but we’re sure as hell not going to pry into it.\n\nNo, what we’re going to do instead is invite you to watch the scene for yourself and ask you to keep in mind that during the entire thing Antonio Banderas was probably nursing an erection at the thought of stab-stripping Catherine Zeta-Jones down to her underwear. Now try watching the rest of the movie knowing that.\n\n4.Can you evaluate the fight scenes of the film?\n\nElena: [in a confessional, Alejandro posing as a priest] Forgive me father for I have sinned. It has been three days since my last confession.\n\nAlejandro Murrieta: Three days? How many sins could you have committed in three days? Come back when you have more time, please.\n\nIn which we go to a mine and the bad guys get the shaft.\n\n… I’m sorry.\n\n5) Zorro vs Captain Love/Diego vs Montero\n\nThe Fighters:\n\nAlejandro Murrietta aka Zorro, here to foil the bad guys’ evil plan. Played Antonio Banderas.\n\nDon Diego de la Vega aka the swashbuckler formerly known as Zorro. Still long-haired and decadent, he had planned to leave this fight to his successor in order to personally reclaim his daughter, but after she frees him from captivity (long story), he shows up to pitch in as well. Played by Anthony Hopkins.\n\nCaptain Love, the sadistic soldier who’s going to fight Alejandro. Played by Matt Letscher.\n\nDon Rafael Montero, the bad guy. Played by Stuart Wilson.\n\nAll armed with rapiers, as usual. The bad guys have guns, though they don’t see much use. Elena is also there but her main contribution is to screw things up, sadly.\n\nThe Setup: Knowing that Team Zorro has the map to their secret mine, Love and Montero have decided to destroy the area and kill its workers, in order to prevent Santa Anna from finding out that California was sold to him using Mexican gold. Thankfully Zorro arrives to put a sword-shaped kibosh on that. After dispatching of a few henchmen, the hero is nearly shot in the back by Montero, but he’s saved when Diego and Elena make an unexpected appearance. Diego finally gets his grudge match against Rafael, and soon Zorro finds himself squaring off against Captain Love.\n\nThe buildup to the latter confrontation is oddly the more dramatic, playing out like the prelude to an Old West shootout. Zorro slowly unsheathes his sword and lets the sun glint off it menacingly– an idea apparently thought up by Banderas himself, and achieved by natural lighting.\n\nLove chooses to pull a reverse Indy-from-Raiders: he removes his sidearm with the same exaggerated care as Zorro did his sword, then tosses it aside voluntarily so the two can have a real duel. Which they do!\n\n(There’s a bit of a ticking clock here on the gunpowder trails set to blow up the mine with all the slave workers trapped inside, but honestly it’s a bit difficult to follow.)\n\n(And yes, I am lumping two fights into one. They occur nearly simultaneously, with the same weapons, in fairly close geographical proximity. To divide them up into separate entries would be repetitive and tiresome and repetitive.)\n\nThe Fight: Much as they do with breakfast time at the Country Buffet, the old folks get moving first. After getting the drop on Rafael and punching him good in order to strip him of his rifle, Diego allows his old enemy to draw his sword so they can have a proper fight.\n\nAfter a bit of cross-cutting the elder Zorro has him on the ropes, and verbally relishes the pleasure he’s soon to take in killing the evil don. But gentle-hearted Elena can’t stand to watch her adopted father get run through, so she stops her real dad from doing the deed… and unfortunately Montero uses the diversion to suddenly grab ahold of her, and threaten to kill her if Diego doesn’t stand down. Unwilling to risk his rediscovered daughter’s life, Diego complies. Rafael then confirms that he was bluffing– even he wouldn’t be so awful as to kill his own daughter. But not so un-awful as to refrain from shooting a defenseless Diego, which he does. Elena pushes the gun aside just in time so that Rafael’s shot is not fatal, at least not immediately; the wounded old fox picks up his sword and the fight is back on.\n\nUnfortunately the gunshot wound severely degrades de la Vega’s fencing abilities, as gunshot wounds tend to do, and the remainder of his battle is a losing one. Eventually the good guy is disarmed, but just as Montero prepares to slice him open, Diego notices that his adversary’s foot is conveniently placed in a pile of leather straps attached to the wagon used for hauling up the gold. At the last moment, Diego ducks out of the way and hits… something so that the wagon comes loose from its moorings, sliding down the cliff and dragging Don Rafael with it. Adios, amigo.\n\nWhile the older men’s fight gets to handle the majority of this sequence’s dramatic load, that leaves us with the Zorro/Love battle to pick up the pace in terms of excitement and fun– although not entirely without dramatic beats, since Alejandro has some emotional payback for the captain, as well. (Actually, going after Joaquin is the one lawful and “good” thing Captain Love did in the movie, seeing as how Joaquin actually was a notorious bandit and wanted criminal, so….)\n\nAnyway, after their too-cool little standoff, the fellows waste no time getting down to clanging blades, with Alejandro tossing a pointed barb about how Love “would like [his] remains displayed,” in reference to the villain parading Joaquin’s be-jarred ahead in front of his brother earlier in the film.\n\nBeing the “fun” pairing, Z&L get more of the dynamic beats in the fight. Zorro kicks Love down a small ravine and goes chasing after him by surfing on a shovel (!); when he goes looking for him in a boiler room, Zorro realizes that his opponent set the whole place to explode and escapes just in time. Love tries to follow up by hiding around a nearby corner to get the drop on Zorro, but the hero gets the literal drop on him by jumping from out of nowhere behind the captain, happily chirping “did you miss me?” Alejandro even one-ups his mentors signature move, at one point slicing a tell-tale “M” into his opponent’s cheek (“for Murrieta!” he explains, gratuitously).\n\nThe battle finally spills out onto a suspended platform, the two fighting frantically in closer and more dangerous quarters. Zorro is at one point disarmed, but once again he doesn’t miss a beat– quickly punching his opponent in the gut, Alejandro then knocks the stunned Love’s sword out from under his hands hard enough to launch it in the air, then snatches it from above the platform’s head bar, and runs the villain through with it. A straightforward kill executed with some unexpected panache.\n\nLove-kebab.\n\nAlthough his “secret” identity is known to the villains by this point, Alejandro nonetheless removes his mask immediately after the finishing move, his true face staring into his nemesis’ dying eyes. Shortly after, the wagon and shipload of gold bars comes tumbling down on the platform, which Zorro narrowly escapes.\n\nThe prisoners are saved and the three protagonists are reunited, but Diego dies a few minutes later (boo!), barely living to see his daughter returned to her identity and finding love (yay!).\n\nThe whole endeavor can’t help but feel a bit anti-climactic after the amazing one-two punch of the previous two fight scenes (a one-two-threepunch if you count the horse chase scene that follows Zorro’s duel with Elena, which isn’t quite a genuine fight but is still plenty fun). If anything, the Z-man’s performance in the preceding material makes it hard to believe that he’d face a genuine threat from Love alone, but the movie tries valiantly to sell the danger and the stakes. It’s also unfortunate that Elena’s main role here is reduced to a meddlesome hostage who inadvertently gets her dad killed, after the earlier duel set her up so well as an Action Girl. She does eventually find usefulness in freeing the trapped prisoners before the inevitable explosion, so there’s that. And at least this movie doesn’t abuse her as bad as the sequel does.\n\nBut for the most part, the whole thing works. The staging is inventive, and as mentioned before the cross-cutting between two different fights makes the entire thing more diverse and dynamic. And while still maintaining a spirit of fun, there’s definitely an undercurrent of menace and real stakes here, unlike the more breezy tone of what’s come before.\n\nHEY GIRL\n\n4) Zorro vs Elena\n\nThe Fighters:\n\nAlejandro de la Vega aka Zorro, who you know by now. He has already secretly met her multiple times: first in his proto-Zorro outfit just before stealing Tornado, again while hiding from Love’s men in a confessional booth (in a gut-busting scene, he pretends to be a priest), and again during his undercover mission as a wealthy Spanish nobleman. In that last guise the two shared a very sexy flamenco dance at her father’s party, but what they’re about to do now is even sexier. Played by Antonio Banderas.\n\nElena Montero, born Elena de la Vega. Diego’s real daughter, stolen as an infant and raised by his adversary. To her adopted dad’s frustration, she has the untameable passion of her mother and the righteousness of her real father. She’s frustrated by her feelings for Alejandro (he sent her necessarily mixed messages, being torn between his attraction to her and his mission to suck up to Rafael) and has doubts about her father’s behavior, being torn between her justice and loyalty. Played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, in a star-making performance.\n\nBoth are armed with rapiers, as usual.\n\nThe Setup: About ready to make his escape, Zorro returns to Montero’s stables to fetch Tornado but is intercepted by Elena, who holds him at swordpoint and demands he return whatever it is he stole. He keeps trying to give her the brush-off but she’s persistent; when he condescendingly tells her (or “mansplains,” to use a hilarious new expression) that he doesn’t “have time to give [her] the proper instruction,” she smirks and tells him that she’s been trained in fencing since she was four.\n\nEven though she’s giving him some (reciprocated) flirtatious vibes– Daddy’s cooped this bird up for waaaaaay too long and she’s totally down to, ahem, fence— Zorro can tell he’s not walking away from this… not that he entirely wants to. She waits while he removes his sword (not a euphemism), and they begin.\n\nHere’s as good a place as anyway to point out what seems to be a deliberate effort (it may just be my perception) on the part of Bob Anderson and all the principal actors: even though they all use the same type of fencing with the same type of weapon, each main character seems to have his or her own trademark fighting style— or at the very least different approaches and attitudes to the same style. Each one’s body language identifies them like a signature.\n\nAlejandro is all limber flash and pizzazz, whereas Diego (especially towards the end) is fluid, effortless, almost lazy. Montero’s style is plain but strong, aggressive and relentless. Captain Love fights more formally & rigidly; you constantly see him with one hand firmly planted behind his back. Elena is somewhat more formal as well, but in more of a dramatic way: during the fight that’s about to ensue, she keeps re-assuming similar exaggerated starting poses, and generally moves about in a florid way.\n\nIt’s an excellent little touch that adds richness to the film, even if the audience doesn’t consciously notice it. Anyway, en garde!\n\nThe Fight: Paced and staged differently than anything that’s come before, but certainly no less fun.\n\nElena’s skill is evident early on, as at the end of their first exchange she ends up slashing Zorro on the shoulder… but only his clothing, she doesn’t actually seem to break the skin. He regards the non-wound with a sort of amused frustration, and by unspoken mutual consent they take a quick breather as they both slip into something more comfortable remove their more obstructive layers of clothing: Zorro his hat & cape, Elena the robe she was weaving over her nighgown. Actually, the amount of humor/sexiness they each put behind small little dialogue exchanges and body language throughout the fight… well, it’s hard to accurately convey it into print, but it’s perfect. Both actors are absolutely on the same wavelength with each other and with what was needed out of the scene, and the resulting chemistry is impeccable. They pull if off so well you’d almost think they were an item in real life as well– and hey, who knows. Both later admitted being genuinely turned on while filming the scene. Don’t tell Michael or Melanie.\n\nOnce they begin again without encumbrance, Zorro’s superior skill comes into play, and he repays his torn shirt by ripping her dress to reveal a generous amount of thigh. “Not bad,” she says nonchalantly. “Not bad at all,” he replies as he outmaneuvers her and leans in for a surprise kiss. She gets visibly (and sexily) angry, flustered enough so that in the next exchange he slices off one of her shoulder straps, resulting in her being dangerously close to toplessness. So of course he kisses her again, getting her even more worked up.\n\nShe ends up disarming him, but without missing a beat, he outwits her by diving into a nearby pile of hay and blocking her thrusts with a horse bridle. This also allows Zorro to seize her sword, and even though she runs to grab his where it fell, he beats her there, makes her rise slowly, and tells her not to move as the camera focuses on the hero making several rapid but delicate sword swipes. He steps back looking enormously pleased with himself, and when the shot moves back to her, we see why: he’s cut her gown in just enough places so that it will fall apart on its own within seconds, leaving her stripped to the waist, save for some strategically placed hair.\n\nI’ll just leave this here, gentlemen.\n\nShe uses his hat to cover her indecency, and after a bit more banter they embrace for their third and most passionate kiss. He disappears to collect his things just as Elena, eyes closed, leans in for more as if entranced. He says goodbye to the señorita and leaves just ahead of Don Rafael and his men. But not before popping back for his hat.\n\nThere’s a hilarious little denouement as Elena has to explain to her flustered father what happened while (not) concealing her obvious attraction to him. When she shouts “he LEFT!” it’s clear that she’s more angry that he didn’t stick around for more smooching than she is about having lost the fight. But really, in a fight like this, everyone’s a winner– especially the audience. Don’t you think?\n\nIf this scene commits any sin (besides that one from the Seven Deadlies, I mean), it’s that it’s too short, ending not too long after it starts. But that’s a bit of a necessity, given that the two could only plausibly be in there so long before somebody thought to check the stables. Plus it’s stretched out fairly well as it is with the flirtatious material in-between exchanges of blades.\n\nIt really is perfectly paced and staged. There’s an energy to it that would be hard to convey in the script, so kudos to not just the actors but also director Campbell for understanding what was needed. James Horner’s score switches to a steady beat of maracas (I think) throughout, helping enormously with the playful tone.\n\nIt’s a bit ridiculous that Alejandro, a man who’s only studied for a few weeks (months?) could stand a chance against Elena, who received 16 years of the best instruction. But that’s the kind of silly universe this movie inhabits– one where no one recognizes you if you put a bandana on your head, or where a masked man in dark black can successfully sneak around in broad daylight. It works.\n\nIs it a bit sexist? Well, it features a woman being turned on by multiple unwanted kisses from a criminal who’s (kind of) physically assaulting her, who then humiliates her by stripping off half her clothes, so… okay, technically it is. But, I must mansplain, you shouldn’t take that any more seriously than the idea that the novice fencer can beat the expert, and so forth. It’s willfully silly, so have some fun with it. It’s still less sexist than literally anything that happens in the Twilight books.\n\nOh, I’m ready for the fun part.\n\n3) Zorro vs Captain Love, Don Rafael, and Soldiers\n\nThe Fighters:\n\nAlejandro Murrieta aka Zorro 2.0. After finding vital intel on Montero’s plans, Alejandro receives Diego’s blessing to don (heh) the full Zorro regalia: mask, hat, sword, whip and sexy Spanish ninja outfit. His training complete and his passion forged into a focused determination, Alejandro– and Zorro– are cooler than ever. Played by Antonio Banderas.\n\nCaptain Harrison Love, the professional soldier (and real person) who leads Montero’s men. A real sadistic SOB with whom Alejandro has a personal score to settle. Quite a skilled fighter, too; Love is a battlefield, after all. Played by Matt Letscher.\n\nDon Rafael Montero, the film’s main villain, who you remember from before. Twenty years older but no less deadly or determined. Played by Stuart Wilson.\n\nMontero’s men, about six or so of them. Again here as ballast. The enormous one is missing; presumably because he’s at the dentist.\n\nAll are armed with rapiers or sabers. Some of the soldiers have single-shot rifles that prove useless against the speedy fox, and Captain Love carries a pistol but he is immediately deprived of it.\n\nThe Setup: Alejandro has just returned from an extended undercover mission, impersonating a young nobleman in order to get in Montero’s good graces and find out his plan: he plans to buy California from Santa Anna, using gold from a secret Mexican mine run by slave labor. Though his performance was impeccable, Alejandro still had to suffer through a few tense confrontations with the man who hunted down his brother: Captain Love, an amoral mercenary with the face of a date rapist:\n\nFrustrated at having had to restrain his bloodlust, Alejandro is encouraged by Diego to hide his rage behind the mask of Zorro. On the eve of the would-be California Purchase, the determined hero sneaks into Montero’s home to abscond with the map to his hidden mine. Meanwhile, Diego, in a distant but visible field, puts the fear of God into the villains with some not-so-subtle imagery:\n\nAfter effortlessly stealing the map, Zorro surprises Love in a hallway. Holding him at sword-point, he deprives Love of his weapons, and when two guards approach, he holds their captain hostage and forces them to let him kick them out the window. He doesn’t want to deal with them; all he needs is Love. Once they’re alone, Zorro steps back and returns the captain’s sword so that they can duel, and he can give Love a bad name.\n\nThe Fight:\n\nWho’s holding the other sword? Love, actually.\n\nThis Love has taken its toll on the hero, so he clearly relishes the opportunity to defeat and embarrass him. They start out tentatively at first, with Zorro almost teasing the villain with tiny little gestures. But soon the fight begins in earnest and it’s wonderful to behold. Love, being a many-splendored fighter, is quite good, but the power of Love is no match for Zorro. The hero easily dominates the captain and finally sends him sprawling to the ground with a brutal punch. But before Zorro can finish the job and become a murderer of Love, our old pal Don Rafael comes rushing out to the hallway, ready to fight.\n\nEven though the apparent return of his old bete noir surely rattled Montero’s nerves, he hasn’t missed a step in the fencing department, putting up a worthy fight for Zorro.\n\n“Rafael, without your Love, you are nothing!”\n\nThings get even trickier when we’re reminded that despite a good decking Love is all around, and the captain rejoins the fray. Even outnumbered Zorro is still deadly, picking up a second sword and driving his opponents back. That’s a bad long-term strategy, though, so the fox escapes from the hallway and out into a larger courtyard/foyer area, pursued by his two adversaries and with yet more soldiers streaming in.\n\nIt gets even more fun from there. Zorro outfences and outmaneuvers the faceless goons even more easily than he did the main villains (who also join the battle). Even more before, Alejandro is always in motion, always in control, always too cool for school. If he’s ever anxious at all during the fight, he doesn’t show it; on the contrary, the look on his face betrays that this new hero is having the time of his life. Swashbuckling hasn’t looked this good since Errol’s days.\n\nThe fight is packed with all sorts of delightful incident. Zorro controls the terrain by jumping off & on a large table and bringing the fight up there, he clocks Love again after being momentarily disarmed, he duels Montero from the other side of a huge candle stand, he does Olympic-level gymnastics on a series of tree branches. It’s not until the fight’s end that he’s even briefly put out, when he’s literally up against the wall with all the surviving soldiers ready to close in.\n\nBut just as they charge, Zorro sidesteps from the wall and cuts loose the enormous hanging map behind him so that it falls on top of his pursuers, leaving them in a state of confused chaos so he can escape with the goods. (There’s bit of poor staging here: Banderas steps away from his foes a few seconds too early, and the careful viewer can see the soldiers would have had ample time to stop or change course on their blind charge. Ah, well.)\n\nZorro is quite rightfully pleased with himself, but he doesn’t see that his escape has been witnessed by Rafael’s “daughter,” Elena….\n\nExcept for the most minor of errors, very little not to love here. The choreography is fantastic, James Horner’s music soars, Banderas’ devilish charm dazzles, and the pacing is perfect– like many of the great fight scenes, it goes on long enough that you don’t feel cheated but short enough that want more. Plus there’s some excellent comic timing at work in the moments before the fight, as Zorro dispatches of Love’s would-be rescuers. If you’re not cheering for the movie now, you’re in a coma.\n\nAnd here I am, fresh out of “love” puns.\n\nIn which Zorro gets his “faithful” horse.\n\n2) Alejandro vs Montero’s Soldiers\n\nThe Fighters:\n\nAlejandro Murrieta, the young urchin from the prologue, all grown up. A semi-reformed bandit under the tutelage of escapee Diego de la Vega. He will, spoiler, soon assume the mantle of Zorro, but based on his woefully incomplete outfit and un-professionalism here, it’s safe to say he hasn’t graduated yet. Played by Antonio Banderas, who isn’t in enough movies lately if you ask me.\n\nArmed with: goes into battle with a rapier here, but loses it and improvises with what he can find, including a sword and knife from his opponents, a mounted bull’s head, a pair of cannon balls, and an actual cannon.\n\nA barracks full of soldiers, over a dozen or so of them. Working for Don Rafael Montero and under the direct command of professional soldier Captain Love. More cannon fodder, presumably played by stunt men and local actors. The skeezy-looking leader is played by (near as I can figure) Pedro Altamirano, and the only other notable one is a rather enormous fellow, played by Óscar Zerafín González.\n\nArmed with: They may have some guns about but none of them really come into play, mostly swords and fists.\n\nThe Setup: After twenty years, Don Rafael has returned to California with some sinister scheme afoot. Upon learning of this, Diego escapes his hellish prison (he didn’t think to do that earlier?) to thwart his old rival. But after being stymied in his post-escape efforts to kill Montero, de la Vega instead takes up the cause of rehabilitating Alejandro, himself despondent and suicidal after the death of his brother (courtesy of Captain Love). Diego blows the dust off his old Zorro lair and gives him a crash course in badassery, honing his swordsmanship, strength and agility in order to help him take revenge on Love… and, Alejandro gradually deduces, to groom him as a successor.\n\nI’ll note here that few things in movies are cooler than post-jailbreak Diego during this middle part of the movie. Good old Anthony Hopkins plays the man as a long-haired, cigar-smoking, wine-guzzling, open-shirted bohemian who uses his whip to flick out candle flames for fun.\n\nAnd also just because he CAN, presumably.\n\nHe’s a retired superhero but he’s also the weirdly cool uncle you never had. It’s a riot.\n\nAnyway, after a few training montages, Alejandro spies Montero’s soldiers with a freshly-purchased and unbroken black Andalusian horse, similar to Zorro’s old steed Tornado. Seeing a chance to irk Love’s men and still a thief at heart, Alejandro dons a subpar Zorro mask and sneaks off an unsanctioned mission to steal the stallion from the soldiers. Along the way he has his first meet-cute with the also-grown up Elena, whose natural passion and righteousness weren’t repressed even after two decades of being raised by Rafael. He sneaks into the stable adjoining the barracks (it can’t be great trying to sleep next to that smell every night, come to think of it) and locates his target easily enough, but there are… complications.\n\nThe Fight: Alejandro gets on the horse, but as soon as he tries to ride it out, it objects, and the wild bucking eventually sends the pair crashing into the soldiers’ sleeping area. The new Tornado inadvertently handles just a bit of Murrieta’s work for him by kicking a few panicked soldiers out of the way, but when the horse smashes through the wall like the Kool Aid Man, his new “owner” falls off, and is left utterly surrounded by a lot of very pissed off Mexican soldiers.\n\nWhat follows is a good bit of fun. The fight signals its intentions early, as that traditional Looney Tunes bit goes down where everybody dogpiles on the hero at once, only for him to calmly climb out from underneath the teeming mass. Ridiculous, but it establishes that this is meant to be an amusing scene rather than an exciting one, and for better or for worse it certainly plays out differently than the rest of the film’s action.\n\nAnd it’s inventive. After pulling off the tried & true method of swinging on the chandelier and using roped counterweights to ascend higher, the hero seizes a mounted bull’s head and uses the horns as a weapon, then ducks inside an open jail cell and when his pursuers on the other side try to stab him through the bars, he uses the sliding door to trap & mangle their swords.\n\nThroughout the whole thing Murrieta never stops moving, constantly punching, kicking and dodging. Soon enough he grabs a couple blades of his own (sword & knife) and does even better, but he backs into a giant soldier who shakes him free of his weapons. The guy looks enormous– seemingly over seven feet tall, but possibly more in the 6′ range since he’s mostly contrasted against the relatively diminutive Banderas.\n\nThe remaining soldiers step back to gleefully watch this monstrous Mexican man-mountain take out Alejandro on his own. Backed into a corner, Murrieta grabs the nearest weapons at hand– two cannon balls– and when the giant gets close enough Alejandro bashes them simultaneously against both sides of his foe’s face. The giant is not visibly stunned at first, but after repeated blows, he eventually turns around in a daze and, rather comically, spits out a whole mouthful of teeth at once. Ouch.\n\nWhile the remaining soldiers were watching dumbfounded, Alejandro loaded and primed the nearby cannon, so that when they looked back up at him the fuse was ready to light.\n\nNow they’re LITERALLY cannon fodder.\n\nThe guards scamper away and Alejandro blows a new hole in the wall, spastically proclaiming that he is Zorro and that “the legend has returned!” Of course, since we can’t leave the scene without one last joke, the hero accidentally blows up the whole building (due to all the exposed gunpowder) and barely escapes alive.\n\nAs mentioned, not much to it and more silly than thrilling, but still a lot of fun, and most importantly, a nice bit of action filler to pass the time until the next real fight sequence (which won’t be for a while). Banderas is quite capable, acting cocky but not as cool & competent as he will be later on. The actors playing the faceless goons sell everything well and the music is appropriately mischievous.\n\n(What’s WITH this building, come to think of it? It seems to be a combination barracks/jail/arms room, adjacent to the stables. Logistically impractical.)\n\nThe Mask of Zorro, a deliciously fun 1998 film that was a solid hit but got nowhere near the acclaim it deserves. Directed by gifted genre helmer Martin Campbell, its fight scenes were overseen by legendary Hollywood swordmaster and GFS mainstay Bob Anderson. Here, Anderson channeled his vast skill in the service of creating a gloriously old-school Hollywood throwback.\n\nAnd good thing, too, because as any Zorro fan can tell you, the thing that most separates him from his contemporaries and inspirations (Batman being among them) is the masked man’s sense of style. Even Robin Hood has nothing on the Z-man in that department. A consummate showman, Zorro always fights like he has an audience to entertain (and as he is a folk hero within his stories, he frequently does), and is fond of using his environment in creative ways and making fools of those who oppose him; even sillier incarnations such as the parody film Zorro The Gay Blade don’t fail to present a Zorro who’s always the coolest guy in the room.\n\nAnderson’s staging combined with the flamboyant performances of Hopkins and Banderas (the latter of whom was said by Anderson to be the best talent he’d ever worked with) give the film a “classic” feel and it never fails to entertain. Unfortunately the movie is a bit backloaded when it comes to action; it’s not until well past the halfway point that the real joys begin, even if what precedes that is perfectly serviceable. And of course that only serves to make the payoff that much sweeter.\n\n1) Zorro vs Don Rafael and Soldiers\n\nThe Fighters:\n\nDon Diego de la Vega, aka Zorro (Spanish for “fox” in case you were wondering, gringo), a wealthy Spanish nobleman leading a double-life as the populist crusader of the title. It’s clear he’s been operating for some time now, but that’s about to come to an unfortunate end. Played by Anthony Hopkins.\n\nArmed with: a rapier, along with pretty much everyone else in the movie. Also has a whip, though in this movie it’s largely used as a tool rather than a weapon.\n\nDon Rafael Montero, the Spanish aristocrat appointed as governor of then-Spain-owned California. His oppressive policies have clearly put him at odds with Zorro. Played by Stuart Wilson, who’s fine but pales next to the original choice of master ham Armand Assante. Ah, what we missed out on!\n\nArmed with: rapier.\n\nSoldiers, less than ten or so. Under the command of Don Rafael, and none of them particularly skilled or competent. Pure cannon fodder.\n\nArmed with: rapiers (possibly sabers) and also some with muskets. One has a handgun.\n\nThe Setup: The beginning of Mask of Zorro practically functions as the ending– if a rather dark one– to another movie that’s not shown to the audience. Between the lengthy text prologue and the implications of the early dialogue, the audience learns that the Spanish colony of California is about to come under the control of the legendary Mexican leader Santa Anna. Montero, however, has yet to leave the soon-to-be-liberated land, in order to take one last stab at killing Zorro, who has clearly been antagonizing Rafael for some time now. Montero’s hatred for the outlaw is deep and personal.\n\nMontero has set a trap for Zorro by organizing the public execution of three random civilians, hoping that Zorro will show up and be killed in the attempt to save them. The audience mainly sees the ensuing confrontation through the eyes of two young boys, Joaquin Murrieta (who was a real person) and his little brother Alejandro (who wasn’t), both of them big Zorro fans.\n\n[Note that this segment combines two short fights– Zorro’s exploits at the gallows and the ensuing confrontation at his home– into one entry. This combination is done in the interest of brevity, as the two battles are both short and largely against the same foes.]\n\nThe Fight: Zorro, who arrived disguised as a hooded monk, waits until the last possible moment to interrupt the proceedings, but does so with signature style, seizing one of the firing squad’s rifles with his whip and yanking it into the guns of his compatriots so that all their shots hit their captain rather than the would-be victims. Campbell wastes no time setting up Zorro’s signature cleverness and showmanship.\n\nThe battle that follows is well-done. Zorro fends off the remaining soldiers with ease, pulling a few more tricks like escaping through the gallows’ trapdoor, impaling one guard by throwing him into a sword that become lodged in a wooden pillar, and trapping another foe inside a set of stocks (you know, these things) nearby. Hopkins and/or his stunt double make for an appropriately dashing and capable figure, even if makeup and lighting couldn’t quite conceal the actor’s age and physical condition (he was about 60 at the time of filming):\n\nThe Murrieta brothers, watching from the rooftops, spot the additional set of soldiers waiting to snipe Zorro from a nearby balcony, and foil them by pushing a statue in their direction just before they could take a rather fateful shot. Zorro shows up to thank them in person, and leaves Joaquin his signature silver medallion in gratitude. This will be important later.\n\nBefore leaving (via escape into the crowd), Zorro confronts Rafael, and leaves a signature “Z” cut on his neck, telling him to go back home to Spain and never return.\n\nZorro would come to regret that act of chivalric mercy, because after he rides to his lovely hacienda and attends to his wife & infant daughter, an unmasked Diego is confronted by Don Rafael and a squad or armed guards. Montero has at some point deduced his adversary’s true identity, the revelation of which must be truly cutting as it’s the same guy who married Rafael’s own unrequited love, Esperanza.\n\nDiego, naturally, resists arrest, and after fighting some guards off a heated duel soon begins between himself and Rafael– right there on the stairs, which is always neat. Though Rafael is clearly skilled, it’s likely de la Vega would have won if not for the interference of the gun-wielding soldiers. Seeing them leveling another shot, Esperanza rushes in to defend her husband and takes a bullet in the back that was meant for him, dying instantly. Shell-shocked at his wife’s death, Diego goes down to a cheap blow to the head (courtesy of Montero) as he rushes to attend to his crying infant daughter.\n\nZorro is hauled off to a third-world prison with his wife dead, his daughter left to be raised by his hated enemy, his home burned with his beloved horse inside. Harsh.\n\nOverall the action is fun but not spectacular. Zorro’s acrobatic exploits in the opening set the stage and tone for what’s to come. The music is serviceable if not soaring, and the actors are all clearly committed. All of the hero’s tricks in the beginning are well-done, but my personal favorite beat is probably Montero immediately killing the soldier who inadvertently shot Esperanza.\n\nNeeds work."
