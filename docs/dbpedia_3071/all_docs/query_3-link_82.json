        "text": "Another beautiful face from the world of the pulp serials.\n\nHer true name was Louise Schultz, but she became famous as Linda Stirling.\n\nIn 1944 she was the titular character in the Republic serial The Tiger Woman.\n\nThe basic premise – evil white men want to cast the natives out of their stretch of Amazon forest to exploit the land.\n\nEnter Rita Arnold, alias the Tiger Woman – a jungle queen that will defend the rights of the natives.\n\nThe lot, in 12 thrilling chapters.\n\nAll in all the serial was not so good – or so they say.\n\nAnd in fact, it’s pretty taxing, for the viewer’s suspension of disbelief, the fact that the Tiger Woman – that lives in a jungle where there are no tigers – is wearing a costume made of leopard fur.\n\nWhy not the Leopard Woman, then?\n\nConfusing confusing.\n\nBut Linda Stirling was beautiful – and she was instantly cast as the lead in another 12-episodes serial, called Zorro’s Black Whip, which is noteworthy, among other things, for the fact that there is no Zorro in it whatsoever.\n\nIn it, Stirling is The Black Whip, a masked avenger in the Idaho territory, fighting evil land speculators.\n\nMore serials followed.\n\nI’m very intrigued by 1945 Manhunt of Mystery Island, also known as Captain Mephisto and the Transformation Machine.\n\nSpies! Pirates! Superscience! Linda Stirling!\n\nStirling appeared in a number of serials in the ’40s, but later married, retired, and got herself a degree in English Literature.\n\nShe became a teacher of English and drama in Glendale, California.\n\nApparently she did keep a low profile, but her students were still liable to remember her as a serial star."
