        "text": "The legend of Zorro was played out in several serials. In some serials, Zorro was present in only the title, such as Zorro's Black Whip, where Zorro makes no appearance.\n\nReed Hadley stars in Zorro's Fighting Legion.\n\nBut in this serial, Zorro's Fighting Legion, Zorro takes a starring role. It's one of the best Zorro serials and one of the best serials ever made, period. With Reed Hadley alternately playing the foppish Don Diego and the man of action Zorro, Zorro's Fighting Legion gives us one action-filled, edge-of-the-seat cliffhanger after the next. For your money, these are some of the best cliffhangers ever made, and with William Witney and John English in charge, also some of the most believable. Rarely do the cliffhangers cheat when extracting their hero from danger. You'll find more wit in the cliffhanger solutions of Zorro's Fighting Legion than you'll find in all the serials combined released after 1950. Zorro's Fighting Legion has the ingredients of a western, but it never really feels like a western. The locale is vaguely exotic, Mexico, just after the end of the Spanish Revolution (circa 1810). One of the great problems of western serials was their lack of variety. Once locked onto the prairie it was hard to supply any surprises other than the usual galloping horses, gun battles over rocks, and the occasional exploding cabin. But Zorro's Fighting Legion contains some unusual ingredients. For starters, we get the secret cave of Don del Oro. The Yaqui Indians treat him like a god. And indeed he looks like a walking, talking golden idol. He sits on a throne with the Yaquis at his feet, while his thunderous voice booms out his orders. And in the middle of the cave, a fiery pit of death awaits all who cross Don del Oro.\n\nBut the most impressive creation of this serial is the person of Zorro himself. Reed Hadley was always a rather stiff actor, but this role suits him well because Don Diego is supposed to be pretending that he's a fop. (\"Thinking bores me,\" he says when offered a position on the town council). So we go along with his not quite convincing performance because he's not supposed to be entirely convincing, or else we might actually start wondering about the actor himself. Hadley strikes just the right mixture of fop and daredevil. He's no Douglas Fairbanks or Tyrone Power, the two actors most closely associated with Zorro, but he gives us one of the better characterizations in the history of the serials."
