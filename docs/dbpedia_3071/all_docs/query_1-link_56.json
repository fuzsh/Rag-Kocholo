        "text": "I know he uses guns in the past, but it's different when they're one-shot flintlocks. Futuristic usually implies assault weapons or ray guns, neither of which I'm real keen on seeing Zorro use. I don't want to see him shooting bullet Z's into a wall.\n\nAs stated, I agree. Him using a lazer gun or a machine gun, as practical as it would be honestly would rob the distinctive traits of the character, who even though there have been glosses on the character, like the serial that put him in 1940's L.A., where he was not in his Old California setting, is iconic for being a cunning rogue of a swordsman. And I think again, there's a chance to work that in dramatically and perhaps even dramatically theme wise into such a film.\n\nAn outlaw in a future world living \"off the grid\" so as to not be part of a system that tracks an individual's every movement, where he must use methods that bypass all the high tech security apparatus could play into the theme of inspiring the masses etc. Hell... Keep Tornado even. Have scenes where the forces he's fighting against have advanced transportation of some kind but Zorro makes them look like fools riding his horse into the rough terrain and disappears into the hinterlands or some such.\n\nAgain... I don't want to make this out to be a slam dunk of a concept. It's about how it is executed. But I don't think there's anything inherently stupid or wrong in doing a version of Zorro in the future. And even my suggestion that they keep it \"old school\"? Eh... Maybe that's not how the creators see it? Maybe they find a way to keep the essence of Zorro as the master swordsman and swashbuckling figure but he also has some kind of futuristic update that fits the character? I'm open to it all. And if this fails I am confident someone will come along with a new version of this perennial American made hero in the near future.\n\nEhh, not so sure about this.\n\nIt sort of makes sense, get all Batman Beyond with it for something a little different, I just for whatever reason can't get into it conceptually. But I think that's less to do with it being a problem to set Zorro specifically in a new setting, and more just like \"there are plenty of futuristic/dystopian/cyberpunk movies out there, and we don't often get cool Mexican-American 1840s/50s movies\".\n\nZorro has a bit of a different flavor to your usual western, so it'd be cool to get more of that stuff. Futuristic's just...sure, Zorro can be futuristic, I guess? But what's even the point?\n\nThe same point as the SHERLOCK and ELEMENTARY series?\n\nhttp://zorro.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Zorro_Films\n\nAmerican films Edit\n\nThe Mark of Zorro (1920), with Douglas Fairbanks\n\nDon Q, Son of Zorro (1925), with Douglas Fairbanks\n\nThe Bold Caballero (1936), with Robert Livingston\n\nZorro's Fighting Legion (1939), with Reed Hadley\n\nThe Mark of Zorro (1940), with Tyrone Power\n\nThe Sign of Zorro (1958), with Guy Williams, portions of the first 13 Zorro TV series episodes edited into a feature film, released overseas in 1958 and domestically in 1960.\n\nZorro, the Avenger (1959), with Guy Williams, another theatrical compilation of several Zorro TV episodes, released overseas, and was not seen in the United States until it was eventually aired on the Disney Channel.\n\nThe Mark of Zorro (1974), a made for television movie with Frank Langella as Zorro that reuses the Alfred Newman theme from 1940's The Mark of Zorro.\n\nZorro, The Gay Blade (1981), a parody, with George Hamilton.

Sony also plans another film with a script by Christopher Stetson Boal based on the novel by Isabel Allende as a less traditional swashbuckler and more of a Dark Knight style unveiling of the character with a new backstory, gritty realism and emotional core with swordplay, combined with the martial arts that came from Europe and created a deadly combination of action and lethal fighting systems that combined swords, daggers, grappling and bare knuckles.
