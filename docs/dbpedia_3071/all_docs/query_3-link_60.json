        "text": "Dressed in the colour of a moonless night, with a sombrero and long flowing black cloak, a mysterious masked figure sets out to serve his brand of justice to all evil-doers of Old California. With a crack of his whip and the swift gallop of his black steed Tornado, he leaves behind a mark on the face of his corrupt victims - a distinguishing trademark \"Z\" scarred by his sharp blade. With stealth he arrives, with flair he fights, he's none other than Zorro, the \"fox\"!\n\nZorro has undergone many interpretations in various mediums - books, movies, television serials, cartoons, even operas and plays. Created by Johnston McCulley, Zorro's first appearance was on Aug 9 1919 in \"All-Story Weekly\" titled \"The Curse of Capistrano\", and ran in 5 parts. It was self-contained, and the ending revealed the true identity of Zorro. However, its popularity ensured that Zorro was to be featured in more stories, and as they say, the rest is history, entrenching the character as one of the legends in pop fiction.\n\nHowever, what really extended Zorro's initial popularity in the early formative years was the result of Douglas Fairbanks Sr.’s portrayal as the title hero in “The Mark of Zorro”. A silent film, The Mark of Zorro broke box office records of its time, and gave birth to the action-adventure genre. Its success meant that a sequel “Don Q, Son of Zorro”, also starring Fairbanks, was made.\n\nHold on, the Son of Zorro? Yes. With the various re-telling and mediums used, the character Zorro has seen some creative and artistic license being applied to spin new tales. It’s not always that Don Diego donned the mask, it could be his son, his great grandson too, and Zorro had even undergone a gender change in “Zorro’s Black Whip” (1944). Thank goodness that was the only female Zorro in his film history.\n\nThroughout Zorro’s long film history of about 50 movies, starring legendary actors like Fairbanks, Tyrone Power, Frank Langella, Alain Delon, and even George Hamilton in a comedic spoof version, perhaps the most famous of all the actors to become Zorro was for Walt Disney’s television series in the 1950s. In more than 70 episodes, Guy Williams was that generation’s swashbuckler, and a fan favourite too. For all fans of the series, who could have forgotten the theme song that sang with gusto of the bold renegade making the Z, which stood for Zorro, in a low voiced chorus. But being a Disney production, certain elements of action were toned down, with the violent carving of the “Z” on the forehead or the cheek relegated to the harmless carving on clothes instead. But this did not dampen the effect of Zorro-mania in the late 50s and early 60s sparked by the series."
