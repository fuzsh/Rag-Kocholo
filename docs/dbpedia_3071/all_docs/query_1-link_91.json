        "text": "Publishing history\n\nZorro debuted in McCulley's 1919 story The Curse of Capistrano, serialized in five parts in the pulp magazine All-Story Weekly. At the denouement, Zorro's true identity is revealed to all.\n\nDouglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, on their honeymoon, selected the story as the inaugural picture for their new studio, United Artists, beginning the character's cinematic tradition. The story was adapted as the film The Mark of Zorro (1920), which was a commercial success. McCulley's story was rereleased by publisher Grosset & Dunlap under the same title, to tie in with the film.\n\nIn response to public demand fueled by the film, McCulley wrote more than sixty more Zorro stories, beginning in 1922. The last, \"The Mask of Zorro\" (not to be confused with the 1998 film), was published posthumously in 1959. These stories ignore Zorro's public revelation of his identity. McCulley died in 1958, just as the Disney-produced Zorro television show was becoming popular.\n\nFictional character biography\n\nIn The Curse of Capistrano, Don Diego Vega becomes Señor Zorro in the pueblo of Los Angeles in California \"to avenge the helpless, to punish cruel politicians\", and \"to aid the oppressed.\" He is the title character, as he is dubbed the \"Curse of Capistrano.\"\n\nThe story involves him romancing Lolita Pulido, an impoverished noblewoman. While Lolita is unimpressed with Diego, who pretends to be a passionless fop, she is attracted to the dashing Zorro. His rival is Captain Ramon. Other characters include Sgt. Pedro Gonzales, Zorro's enemy but Diego's friend; Zorro's deaf and mute servant Bernardo; his ally Fray (Friar) Felipe; his father Don Alejandro Vega; and a group of noblemen (caballeros) who at first hunt him but are won over to his cause.\n\nIn later stories, McCulley introduces characters such as pirates and Native Americans, some of whom know Zorro's identity.\n\nIn McCulley's later stories, Diego's surname became de la Vega. In fact, the writer was wildly inconsistent. The first magazine serial ended with the villain dead and Diego publicly exposed as Zorro, but in the sequel the villain was alive, and the next entry had the double identity still secret.\n\nSeveral Zorro productions have expanded on the character's exploits. Many of the continuations feature a younger character taking up the mantle of Zorro.\n\nAlthough McCulley's stories were set in Los Angeles during the era of Mexican rule (between 1821 and 1846), some movie adaptations of Zorro's story have placed him during the earlier Spanish era.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nIn The Curse of Capistrano, Diego is described as \"unlike the other full-blooded youths of the times\"; though proud as befitting his class (and seemingly uncaring about the lower classes), he shuns action, rarely wearing his sword except for fashion, and is indifferent to romance with women. This is, of course, a sham. This portrayal, with minor variations, is followed in most Zorro media.\n\nA notable exception to this portrayal is Disney's Zorro (1957–59), where Diego, despite using the original facade early in the series, instead becomes a passionate and compassionate crusader for justice and simply masquerades as \"the most inept swordsman in all of California\". In this show, everyone knows Diego would love to do what Zorro does, but thinks he does not have the skill.\n\nThe Family Channel's Zorro (1990–1993) takes this concept further. While Diego pretends to be inept with a sword, the rest of his facade is actually exaggerating his real interests. Diego is actually well versed and interested in art, poetry, literature, and science. His facade is pretending to be interested in only these things and to have no interest in swordplay or action. Zorro also has a well-equipped laboratory in his hidden cave in this version of the story.\n\nCharacter motifs\n\nThe character's visual motif is typically a black costume with a flowing Spanish cape, a flat-brimmed black sombrero cordobés, and a black cowl sackcloth domino mask that covers the top of the head from eye level upwards. In his first appearance, he wears a cloak instead of a cape, and a black cloth veil mask with slits for eyes covers his whole face. Other features of the costume may vary.\n\nHis favored weapon is a rapier, which he often uses to leave his distinctive mark, a Z cut with three quick strokes. He also uses a bullwhip. In his debut, he uses a pistol.\n\nThe fox is never depicted as Zorro's emblem. It is used as a metaphor for the character's wiliness, such as in the lyrics \"Zorro, 'the Fox', so cunning and free ...\" from the Disney television show theme.\n\nHis heroic pose consists of rearing on his horse Tornado, sword raised high. (The logo of Zorro Productions, Inc. uses an example of this pose.)\n\nInspirations\n\nThe historical figure most often associated with the Zorro character is Joaquin Murrieta, whose life was fictionalized in an 1854 dime novel by John Rollin Ridge. In the 1998 film The Mask of Zorro Murrieta's (fictitious) brother Alejandro succeeds Diego as Zorro. As a hero with a secret identity who taunts his foes by signing his deeds, Zorro finds a direct literary predecessor in Sir Percival Blakeney, hero of the Scarlet Pimpernel pulp series by Emma Orczy.\n\nThe character recalls other figures, such as Robin Hood, Reynard the Fox, Salomon Pico, Manuel Rodríguez Erdoíza, and Tiburcio Vasquez. Another possible historical inspiration is William Lamport, an Irish soldier who lived in Mexico in the seventeenth century. His life was the subject of a fictive book by Vicente Riva Palacio; The Irish Zorro (2004) is a recent biography. Another is Estanislao, a Yokuts man who led a revolt against the Mission San Jose in 1827.\n\nThe 1890s penny dreadful treatment of the Spring-heeled Jack character as a masked avenger may have inspired some aspects of Zorro's heroic persona. Spring Heeled Jack was portrayed as a nobleman who created a flamboyant, masked alter ego to fight injustice, frequently demonstrated exceptional athletic and combative skills, maintained a hidden lair and was known to carve the letter \"S\" into walls with his rapier as a calling card.\n\nLike Sir Percy in The Scarlet Pimpernel, Don Diego avoids suspicion by playing the role of an effete dandy who wears lace, writes poetry, and shuns violence. The all-black Fairbanks film costume, which with variations has remained the standard costume for the character, was likely adapted from the Arrow serial film character The Masked Rider (1919). This character was the first Mexican black-clad masked rider on a black horse to appear on the silver screen. Fairbanks's costume in The Mark of Zorro, released the following year, resembled that of the Rider with only slight differences in the mask and hat.\n\nBooks\n\nJohnston McCulley's original magazine serial, The Curse of Capistrano from All-Story Weekly, was published in 1924 as a novel by Grosset & Dunlap under the title The Mark of Zorro. It was reprinted by MacDonald & Co. in 1959 and by Tor books in 1998, ISBN 978-0-8125-4007-9.\n\nJohnston McCulley's Zorro novels and short stories have been reprinted by Bold Venture Press in a series of trade paperback editions.\n\nZorro: The Complete Pulp Adventures Volume One March 2016 ISBN 978-1530392445\n\nZorro: The Complete Pulp Adventures Volume Two June 2016 ISBN 978-1534602007\n\nZorro: The Complete Pulp Adventures Volume Three September 2016\n\nZorro: The Complete Pulp Adventures Volume Four November 2016\n\nZorro: The Complete Pulp Adventures Volume Five January 2017\n\nZorro: The Complete Pulp Adventures Volume Six March 2017\n\nJohnston McCulley's Zorro short stories were reprinted by Pulp Adventures Inc. in a series of trade paperback editions.\n\nZorro The Master's Edition Volume One (1932–1944) February 2000 ISBN 1-891729-20-9\n\nZorro The Master's Edition Volume Two (1944–1946) January 2002 ISBN 1-891729-21-7\n\nZorro The Master's Edition: A Task For Zorro (1947) July 2002 ISBN 1-891729-31-4\n\nA series of paperback novels were published by Tom Doherty Associates, Inc.

Zorro Productions, Inc., asserts that it \"controls the worldwide trademarks and copyrights in the name, visual likeness and the character of Zorro.\" It further states \"[t]he unauthorized, unlicensed use of the name, character and/or likeness of 'Zorro' is an infringement and a violation of state and federal laws.\"\n\nIn 1999, TriStar Pictures Inc. sued Del Taco, Inc., due to a fast-food restaurant advertising campaign that allegedly infringed Zorro Productions’ claims to a trademark on the character of Zorro. In an August 1999 order, the court ruled that it would not invalidate Zorro Productions’ trademarks as a result of the defendant's arguments that certain copyrights in Zorro being in the public domain or owned by third parties.\n\nA dispute took place in the 2001 case of Sony Pictures Entertainment v. Fireworks Ent. Group. On January 24, 2001, Sony Pictures, TriStar Pictures and Zorro Productions, Inc. sued Fireworks Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, and Mercury Entertainment, claiming that the Queen of Swords television series infringed upon the copyrights and trademarks of Zorro and associated characters. Sony and TriStar had paid licensing fees to Zorro Productions, Inc., related to the 1998 film The Mask of Zorro. Queen of Swords was a 2000–2001 television series set in Spanish California during the early 19th century and featuring a hero who wore a black costume with a red sash and demonstrated similarities to the character of Zorro, including the sword-fighting skills, use of a whip and bolas, and horse-riding skills.\n\nZorro Productions, Inc., argued that it owned the copyright to the original character because Johnston McCulley assigned his Zorro rights to Mitchell Gertz in 1949. Gertz died in 1961, and his estate transferred to his children, who created Zorro Productions, Inc. Fireworks Entertainment argued that the original rights had already been transferred to Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. in 1920 and provided documents showing this was legally affirmed in 1929, and also questioned whether the copyright was still valid.\n\nThe court ruled that \"since the copyrights in The Curse of Capistrano and The Mark of Zorro lapsed in 1995 or before, the character Zorro has been in the public domain\". Judge Collins also stated that: \"Plaintiffs' argument that they have a trademark in Zorro because they licensed others to use Zorro, however, is specious. It assumes that ZPI had the right to demand licenses to use Zorro at all.\"\n\nIn another legal action in 2010, Zorro Productions, Inc., sued Mars, Incorporated, makers of M&M's chocolate candies, and ad agency BBDO Worldwide over a commercial featuring a Zorro-like costume. The case was settled with \"each party shall bear its own costs incurred in connection with this action, including its attorney's fees and costs\" on August 13, 2010.\n\nIn March 2013, Robert W. Cabell, author of Z - the Musical of Zorro (1998), filed another lawsuit against Zorro Productions, Inc. The lawsuit asserted that the Zorro character is in the public domain and that the trademark registrations by Zorro Productions, Inc., are therefore fraudulent. In October, 2014, Cabell's lawsuit was dismissed, with the judge ruling that the state of Washington (where the case was filed) did not have jurisdiction over the matter. However the judge later reversed his decision and had the case transferred to California.\n\nIn June 2015, Robert W. Cabell's legal dispute with Zorro Productions, Inc. resulted in the Community Trade Mark for \"Zorro\" being declared invalid by the European Union's Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market for goods of classes 16 and 41. This follows the ‘Winnetou’ ruling of the Office's First Board of Appeal in which the Board of Appeal ruled that the name of famous characters cannot be protected as a trademark in these classes. Both rulings are currently being appealed. Zorro Productions, Inc. owns approximately 1300 other ZORRO related trademarks worldwide.\n\nLegacy\n\nBob Kane has credited Zorro as part of the inspiration for Batman. Like Zorro, Bruce Wayne is affluent, the heir of wealth built by his parents. His everyday persona encourages others to think of him as shallow, foolish and uncaring to throw off suspicion. Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and The Dark Knight Strikes Again both include multiple Zorro references like the Batman inscribing a Z on a defeated foe. In later tellings of Batman's origins, Bruce Wayne's parents are murdered by a robber as the family leaves a showing of the 1940 film The Mark of Zorro, starring Tyrone Power.\n\nThe Masked Rider, the primary mascot of Texas Tech University, is similar to Zorro.\n\nHanna-Barbara Productions' Pixie and Dixie cartoon featured a Zorro-like character with a mask, cape and sword known in the episode \"Mark of the Mouse.\" Hanna-Barbara Production's El Kabong character, an alternate persona of Quick Draw McGraw is loosely based upon Zorro.\n\nA cave that was used as a filming location in various Zorro productions is now known as \"Zorro's Cave\" and remains in place, now hidden behind a condominium complex, on land that was once the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Calif., recognized as the most widely filmed outdoor shooting location in the history of Hollywood."
