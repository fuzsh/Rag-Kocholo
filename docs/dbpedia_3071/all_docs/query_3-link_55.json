        "text": "It’s hard to beat Saw II on Halloween weekend. Still, despite some critical pans, The Legend of Zorro came in a respectable but unspectacular second in last weekend’s box office, selling some $16 million worth of tickets.\n\nThat’s considerably less than the $22 million business that its predecessor, the 1998 Mask of Zorro, did on its opening weekend. Still it’s probably enough to ensure that the horseman in black will keep riding through more sequels, at least until Antonio Banderas tires of the role.\n\nIn fact, the masked rider (whose name means “fox” in Spanish) has proved to be one of the most durable heroes in American pop culture.\n\nZorro helped spawn all the generations of masked heroes and superheroes that followed through the 20th century. (Consider: Like Batman, he keeps his headquarters in a cave, has a butler who keeps his secret, responds when the townspeople activate a distress signal and poses as a rich, useless playboy during the day.)\n\nMr. Banderas, moreover, is just the latest in a long, and occasionally distinguished, line of actors to don the mask: Douglas Fairbanks Sr., Tyrone Power, Frank Langella, Alain Delon. Linda Starling played a female Zorro in Zorro’s Black Whip (1944).\n\nEven Clayton Moore – better known as that other masked rider, the Lone Ranger – took on the role in a 1949 Republic serial The Ghost of Zorro. (It wasn’t very good, according to my sources, but it may have given studio bosses the idea to let Mr. Moore try playing the Ranger.)\n\nEven more intriguing, according to historian Bill Yenne, is the peculiar synergy between Zorro and Hollywood. The character made his first appearance in 1919, just as the California film industry was hitting its stride. Zorro’s home turf, moreover, was the sleepy hamlet of Los Angeles, the movies’ front yard.\n\nZorro’s creator was Johnston McCulley, a former police reporter and Army public affairs officer who’d relocated to California early in the last century.\n\nBy the time World War I ended, he was one of hundreds of writers churning out words by the thousand for the scores of “pulp” magazines that thrived during the era.\n\nTelevision largely killed off the market for these mass-market story ’zines (called “pulps” since they were printed on cheap paper). In their time, though, they helped nurture many new writers and, in the case of Hugo Gernsback’s Amazing Stories, spawned whole new genres (in Amazing’s case, modern science fiction).\n\nOne of the biggest of the pulps was All-Star Weekly, which had published the first of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Tarzan stories. In its Aug. 9, 1919, issue, All-Star introduced Zorro to the world in Johnston McCulley’s story “The Curse of Capistrano.”\n\nCritics have loved poking at all the glaring anachronisms in The Legend of Zorro: the bad guys’ repeating rifles that weren’t introduced in the real world until the Civil War; the Southerners stomping around in gray uniforms a decade before the Confederacy settled on that color.\n\nIn fact, Zorro’s had a hard time with historical accuracy from the start. Mr. McCulley, who was born in Illinois, didn’t know much California history and often fudged the facts.\n\nIt’s often not clear if Zorro is riding around when the Spaniards or the Mexicans control the territory. Nit-picking historians have pointed out that the haciendas around Little Ol’ L.A. weren’t as luxurious or as numerous as Mr. McCulley claimed. And as for those gorgeous eucalyptus trees in the background, they’re weren’t transplanted to California until the late 1800s (from Australia), by which time Zorro would have been retired to the Old Caballeros’ Home.\n\nFor that matter, the mission of San Juan de Capistrano, home of the swallows, isn’t anywhere near Los Angeles and wasn’t even mentioned in the first Zorro story.\n\nWhatever. The fact, is “Curse of Capistrano” was good enough to attract one really enthusiastic fan: Douglas Fairbanks Sr.\n\nThe 37-year-old actor was already building a reputation as an action star when he happened to find the piece in All-Story. He quickly bought the rights and dashed off a story treatment himself, under the pseudonym “Elton Thomas.”\n\nThe result was The Mark of Zorro (1920), one of Hollywood’s earliest swashbucklers and still entertaining to this day.\n\nSome smartaleck in American Heritage named the elder Mr. Fairbanks the “most overrated American movie star” a while back. That’s really unfair.\n\nSure, he was a bit pudgy by modern standards, but he’s the guy who put the swash in swashbuckler, and he set the modern standards for stunt work (and yes, he did most of his own stunts himself). Others improved on the image, but he pioneered it. Without Douglas Fairbanks Sr., there’d be no Errol Flynn, no James Bond, no Indiana Jones. Here’s a quick field guide to some of the better Zorro movies:\n\n‘The Mark of Zorro’ (1940): Some would argue that this was the best of the lot, directed by Rouben Mamoulian (Queen Christina, Golden Boy, Laura), with Tyrone Power in the title role. The cast is spectacular: Basil Rathbone as the supercilious villain, Gale (“the Spider Woman”) Sondergaard as a femme fatale, Linda Darnell as the love interest and Eugene Pallette (who played Friar Tuck in the Errol Flynn Adventures of Robin Hood) as the local friar. Mr. Fairbanks had played Don Diego as a sort of moron, obsessed with silly magic tricks. Mr. Power played up the, er, Liberace elements of his non-masked persona. Frank Langella took the lead in the 1974 TV-movie remake of Mark.\n\n‘Zorro the Avenger’ (1959) and ‘Sign of Zorro’ (1958): Two Disney knock-offs that starred my personal favorite Zorro, Guy Williams. Disney reportedly cobbled these two movies together from episodes of its incredibly successful 1957-58 TV series, supposedly for distribution in Japan. Still, I recall watching at least one of these at my hometown theater as a kid. Mr. Williams – born Armando Joseph Catalano – made an affable lead, and his fencing experience helped. The real delight, however, lies in the background characters: the ex-vaudevillian Gene Sheldon as the ever-silent Bernardo, and Henry Calvin as the bumbling but good-hearted Sgt. Garcia.\n\n‘The Erotic Adventures of Zorro’ (1974): “The First Movie Rated Z!” I haven’t seen this soft-porn comedy; those who have claim it’s OK comedy and lousy pornography. Still, it might be the source for the strip-tease duel between Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones from Mask of Zorro.\n\n‘Zorro, the Gay Blade’ (1980): Actor George Hamilton – he of the Perfect Tan – and producer Melvin Simon were casting about for a sequel to Mr. Hamilton’s popular Dracula spoof, Love at First Bite. The result was a disco-era Zorro, playing up Don Diego’s supposed effeminacy to the level of High Camp, or maybe Low Camp. Mr. Hamilton’s character isn’t exactly gay – although he’s overdoing Mr. Fairbanks’ mannerisms to the hilt. The trouble comes when he sprains his ankle and must turn over the role of Zorro to his long-lost flamboyant twin brother, “Bunny” Wigglesworth of the Royal Navy. Bunny gives Zorro a makeover, including lemon and plum-colored outfits, plus a whip. Trust me, you had to be there.\n\nBen Steelman: 343-2208\n\nben.steelman@starnewsonline.com"
