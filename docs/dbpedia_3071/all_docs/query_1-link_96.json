The film was made after the popular 1940 20th Century-Fox remake of \"The Mark of Zorro\" and Republic was unable to use the character himself, but still wanted to capitalize on it. However, and despite the title, Zorro does not feature in this serial. The hero(ine) is actually called The Black Whip throughout.\n\nThe serial is set in pre-statehood Idaho, and involves a fight to prevent and ensure statehood by the villains and heroes respectively.\n\nParts of this serial were reused as stock footage to pad out later serials such as \"Don Daredevil Rides Again\" (1951) and \"Man with the Steel Whip\" (1954) - despite the fact that both of those serials had male leads.\n\nPlot\n\nIn \"Zorro's Black Whip\" the word Zorro never occurs, but a female who behaves like Don Diego in Idaho fights a cabal of corrupt politicians as \"The Black Whip\" after her brother (the original Black Whip) is killed. Hammond, owner of the town's stagecoach line and a leading citizen, is opposed to Idaho becoming a state, and kills Randolph Meredith, owner of the town's newspaper, for endorsing it. Meredith's sister Barbara, expert with a bullwhip and pistol, dons Randolph's black costume and mask and becomes \"The Black Whip\", dealing a blow to Hammond and his gang each time they perform some heinous act in their efforts to keep the town, and their power over it, unchanged. Aided by US government agent Vic Gordon, Barbara confronts Hammond in a final showdown just as the town votes on whether or not to accept statehood.\n\nLinda Stirling as \"The Black Whip\" is quite obviously female but, even after a bout of wrestling, the villains do not realise they aren't fighting a man. Some reference is made to this in the script, however, when the villains are trying to determine who the Black Whip's secret identity could be:cquote2|Hammond: Barbara Meredith, she's the Black Whip!Baxter: She couldn't be! The Black Whip's got to be a man! He's outshot us, outrode us, and outfought us, stopped at us every turn!|Chapter Nine: AvalancheThe day is saved when Vic Gordon discovers Barbara's secret and removes her from suspicion by appearing in her costume. From this point on he, despite relinquishing the costume, tends to assume the hero role while Barbara becomes slightly more of a traditional damsel in distress.\n\nCast\n\n* Linda Stirling as Barbara Meredith, The Black Whip and newspaper proprietrix\n\n* George J. Lewis as Vic Gordon, a US government agent allied with the Black Whip. In a related role, Lewis later portrayed Zorro's father in the Walt Disney television series \"Zorro\"\n\n* Lucien Littlefield as \"Tenpoint\" Jackson, the comic relief newspaper typesetter working with Barbara Meredith\n\n* Francis McDonald as Dan Hammond, villainous owner of the town's Stagecoach company\n\n* Hal Taliaferro as Baxter, one of Hammond's henchmen\n\n* John Merton as Ed Harris, one of Hammond's henchmen\n\n* Stanley Price as Hedges, Hammond's Clerk-Henchman\n\nThe surnames of the two lead characters, \"Meredith\" and \"Gordon\", are an in-joke. They are the surnames of both versions of Nyoka the Jungle Girl in the, otherwise unconnected, Republic serials \"Jungle Girl\" and \"Perils of Nyoka\".\n\nChapter titles\n\n#The Masked Avenger\n\n#Tomb of Terror\n\n#Mob Murder\n\n#Detour to Death\n\n#Take Off That Mask!\n\n#Fatal Gold\n\n#Wolf Pack\n\n#The Invisible Victim\n\n#Avalanche\n\n#Fangs of Doom\n\n#Flaming Juggernaut\n\n#Trail of Tyranny\n\nThis was one of two 12-chapter serials released in 1944, along with Linda Stirling's serial debute, \"The Tiger Woman\". It had been Republic's standard pattern to produce two 12-chapter serials and two 15-chapter serials each year since 1938 but 1944 was the last year that occurred. In fact, Republic would only produce two more 15-chapter serials, \"Manhunt of Mystery Island\" and \"The Purple Monster Strikes\", both in 1945 and both starring Linda Stirling.\n\ntunts & Effects\n\ntunts\n\n*Babe DeFreest as The Black Whip (doubling Linda Stirling)\n\n*Dale Van Sickel as Vic Gordon/Rock Heavy Karl/Camp Heavy/Danley (doubling George J. Lewis)\n\n*Tom Steele as Baxter/Ed (doubling Hal Taliaferro)\n\n*Helen Thurston\n\npecial Effects\n\nSpecial Effects by Republic's in-house team of the Lydecker brothers.\n\nProduction\n\nFilming on \"Zorro's Black Whip\" took place between 29 July and 26 August 1944 under the working title \"The Black Whip\". the production budget was $134,899 but the negative cost rose to $145,251 ($10,352, or 7.7%, over budget compared to $8,199.55, or 5.7%, over all Republic serials). This was the cheapest serial Republic released in 1944.\n\nRepublic's overall spending on serials in 1944, $782,204, was actually the second largest in its history. Only 1949, $815,683, would exceed it, although that was split over five productions rather than 1944's four.\n\nThe sixth chapter of the serial was released to film exchanges on 16 November 1944 (now recorded as the official release date).\n\nee also\n\n*List of film serials by year\n\n*List of film serials by studio\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n*\n\n* [http://www.serialexperience.com/showarticle.php?fldRecNum=259 Zorro's Black Whip at Todd Gault's Movie Serial Experience]\n\n* [http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/z/zorros-black-whip.html Stomp Tokyo review of Zorro's Black Whip]\n\nDownload or view online\n\n* [http://www.movieflix.com/search.mfx?ss=black+whip&Search%0D%0AMovies.x=0&Search%0D%0AMovies.y=0 Episodes 2-12 free online]"
