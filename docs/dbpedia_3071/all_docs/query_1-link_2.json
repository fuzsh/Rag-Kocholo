        "text": "American actress (1921–1997)\n\nLinda Stirling (born Louise Schultz;[1] October 11, 1921 – July 20, 1997) was an American showgirl, model, and actress. In her later years, she had a second career as a college English professor for more than two decades. She is most famous for her roles in movie serials.\n\nEarly years\n\n[edit]\n\nThe daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Alex Schultz,[2] Stirling was born in Long Beach, California.[3] She attended Burnett Grammar School, George Washington Junior High School, and Long Beach Polytechnic High School.[2]\n\nShe began studying drama when she was 12, and she eventually studied for two years at Ben Bard's Academy of Dramatic Arts.[4] She also was active in the Long Beach Players' Guild.[2]\n\nStirling worked as a model for photographers and acted in summer stock theater.[3]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the book In the Nick of Time: Motion Picture Sound Serials, William C. Cline wrote, \"Of the characteristics necessary in a heroine, Linda Stirling possessed all — presence, wholesomeness, beauty and versatility — and any single one would have been sufficient in her case.\"[5]\n\nStirling's first role was as a model in The Powers Girl in 1943 and her first role in a serial was the title character in The Tiger Woman (1944). She was featured as the heroine in Zorro's Black Whip (1944).[1]\n\nAfter her marriage, she essentially retired from films to raise a family, although she later appeared in occasional episodes of television shows, beginning in 1952.[4]\n\nLater years\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter her career as an actress ended, and her children had grown, Stirling earned her Bachelor's and her Master's degree at UCLA.[6][3] With her degree in hand, Stirling began a new career as a teacher of college English and Drama in the 1960s at Glendale College in Glendale, California between 1967 and 1992.[6]\n\nIn her later life, Stirling sought to distance herself in the classroom from her Hollywood past, but still remained active on the film convention circuit until the last years of her life. She also appeared in a 1990 documentary on Republic Pictures, the studio where she did the bulk of her work.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1946, she married Republic screenwriter Sloan Nibley. They had two sons.[5]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nStirling died of cancer in Studio City, Los Angeles, California in 1997.[6][7]\n\nRecognition\n\n[edit]\n\nStirling was one of the original winners of the Golden Boot Awards in 1983 for her contributions to western cinema.[8]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm Year Title Role Notes 1943 The Powers Girl Model Alternative title: Hello Beautiful 1944 The Tiger Woman Tiger Woman / Rita Arnold Alternative title: Perils of the Darkest Jungle The San Antonio Kid Ann Taylor Strangers in the Night Rosemary in Portrait Uncredited Sheriff of Sundown Lois Carpenter Vigilantes of Dodge City Carol Franklin Zorro's Black Whip Barbara Meredith / The Black Whip Serial 1945 The Topeka Terror June Hardy Sheriff of Cimarron Helen Burton Manhunt of Mystery Island Claire Forrest Alternative title: Captain Mephisto and the Transformation Machine Santa Fe Saddlemates Ann Morton The Purple Monster Strikes Shelia Layton Alternative titles: D-Day on Mars\n\nThe Purple Shadow Strikes Dakota Entertainer Uncredited The Cherokee Flash Joan Mason Wagon Wheels Westward Arlie Adams 1946 The Madonna's Secret Helen North Passkey to Danger Model Uncredited The Invisible Informer Eve Rogers The Mysterious Mr. Valentine Janet Spencer Rio Grande Raiders Nancy Harding The Crimson Ghost Diana Farnsworth The Magnificent Rogue Model Uncredited That Brennan Girl Minor Role Uncredited\n\nAlternative title: Tough Girl 1947 Jesse James Rides Again Ann Bolton The Pretender Flo Ronson Television Year Title Role Notes 1954 The Pepsi-Cola Playhouse Helen Blayne 1 episode: \"The Woman on the Bus\" Adventures of the Falcon 1 episode 1954–1955 The Public Defender Betty 2 episodes The Adventures of Kit Carson Various roles 3 episodes 1955 The Man Behind the Badge Nettie Perry 1 episode Medic Ellen McClure 1 episode 1956 Cavalcade of America 1 episode The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp Joan Laramie 1 episode The Millionaire Martha 1 episode 1957 On Trial 1 episode 1959 The Real McCoys Mrs. Baker 1 episode, (final appearance)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBiography portal\n\nCalifornia portal\n\nFilm portal\n\nTelevision portal\n\nTheater portal"
