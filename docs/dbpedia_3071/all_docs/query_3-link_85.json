        "text": "Not conclusive as you said, but it's still much more than I have read.\n\nBy the way, do you consider \"Mysteryous Don Miguel\" a novel or a short story?\n\nLOL! I dont know? Masters Edition describes Mysteryous Don Miguel (1935)as a Novelette, whatever that is? A short Novel . Its several chapters published across two issues of Argosy, whose cover blurb introduced it as Zorro returns in a Novel by McCulley \n\nSo you can choose what to call it.\n\nThe point I was trying to make, is that it's impossible to survive having your heart run through, so the only possibility is that Zorro was mistaken when he thought that he HAD ran Ramon through the heart. What I was wondering is how could Zorro make that wrong assumption if no blood came out of Ramon's body. But maybe it will be clear once I get a chance to read .\n\nYeah again you might be making some assumptions, how he survived to appear in Further Adventures, wont be clear, or explained. Like I said you have to role with it, you can imagine what you want. Or be disappointed. Either way he survived! And he's got a wicked \"Z\" scar across his face between the eyes And he's out to kill Zorro!\n\nIt makes sense,\n\nthough I don't understand what you mean by \"Others never believed to begin with\".\n\nFrom the start you seemed to be assuming everyone knows. Who this everyone is I dont know?. Characters come and go.\n\nFurther your assumption appears to be that this everyone who knows, must also include any new characters who appears in any new story. These people (new characters) if they suspect at all would only know second hand, and would need proof. There are also those (some of the Dons, even Gonzalez) who protect his identity.\n\nSince he's being hunted again, knowing who he is has become a liability for some.\n\nAlso not everyone was there at the reveal, some would never have a reason to believe he was Zorro, and new characters would certainly doubt it, adding further confusion as he maintains the façade.\n\nEven those who were once convinced, he can trick them into having doubt!\n\nAs you read, you realize there is no across the board everyone knew he was Zorro, its more nuanced to each story , and character as they are introduced.\n\nI was suggesting that Diego had to convince people that he was not Zorro which is the same thing that you wrote.\n\nTo be clear first he had to convince people he was not the fake Zorro, for that he must ride again as Zorro.\n\nAnd inevitably he has to convince others he is not the real Zorro either. Is that clear? LOL I'm laughing at my own inept inability to describe this after several times, forgive me.\n\nMy assumptions were only a way to ask you some questions. Please relax a bit , I am not determined to be unsatisfied with these stories. Quite the opposite, I have enjoyed \"The Curse of Capistrano\", and I feel I would also enjoy the rest of McCulley's stories.\n\nI think you will enjoy them too, but based on some of the questions, it seems you have some firm assumptions that things might have to go or be explained a certain way to be viable, that from what Ive read, might disappoint you when you see how they are answered (or in some cases not answered) in the story.\n\nI get it, allot of this \"info\", although it is fun to talk about for me and it seems for you as well, I was curious about several of the same things you asked, especially in establishing a bit of a chronology of what happened or was developed and where. I just fear having the info told, isn't particularly going to make the stories more fun to read.\n\nReally useful info, thanks!\n\nI can apparently talk about them endlessly. It's my pleasure.\n\nAlso, can you tell me if the duel between the real Zorro and the copycat Zorro happened in front of many people?\n\nWhich duel? There isn't just one.\n\nThey had many.\n\nAnother big spoiler I guess.\n\nThe impostor Zorro is Captain Rocha himself the Son of the previous Governor who Zorro ran out of town. In their first duel Zorro marks him determined to prove he is the impostor. Later he extracts a confession from him (when they are alone). Later he traps him with the help of the Cocapah who unmask him. And later he publicly exposes him as an impostor where they have their final duel.\n\nI don't know how many other examples are there. I know \"Zorro Saves A Friend\" is the title of both a McCulley story and a Disney episode, but the plots are very different. However, the plot of McCulley's story reminds me of the episode \"Death Stacks the Deck\". I also know \"Zorro Fights A Duel\" is the title of both a McCulley story and a Disney episode, and although the plots have many differences, they both involve someone publicly challenging Zorro to a duel by calling him a coward. Of course, McCulley's Esteban Sanchez is a one-shot character who is a killer, while Disney recreated this episode as the third of Don Ricardo del Amo's 4-episode arc, and Ricardo is not a bad guy even though he challenges Zorro.\n\nIm sure there was some McCulley influence.\n\nIn skimming some of the stories again, to answer some of your questions. Im finding more parallels, again its been a while since I watched the full Disney eps. But Zorro saves a friend(1932) does immediately reminded me of a Disney episode, where Zorro protects a friend who has been swindled by a gambler and is losing his land.\n\nAnd Zorro Hunts a Jackal(1933) reminded me of an episode where Zorro haunts and terrifies the soldiers, making them believe the place is haunted. Another where the Capitan hires an expert swordsman to lure out Zorro seemed familiar, and where a young man accused of murder seeks refuge in the Mission, until Zorro can prove his innocence.\n\nThere seem to be several repeating themes.\n\nI would guess they may have been mining both McCulleys stories, and McCully himself for ideas.\n\nSo you think you can play this guy?\n\n\\\n\nI love these staged publicity images with McCulley (pic edited, I think it was originally Power in the frame)\n\nAlso, I didn't suggest Bernardo was the most significant character in McCulley's stories. However, in one story I found the line \"I have instructed Bernardo to have everything ready.\" and I wonder how Bernardo was instructed. And according to this summary of \"Zorro Saves a Herd\"...\n\nThis is a common description, he often gives Bernardo instructions, and it is often Bernardo who preps and brings him his horse and gear.\n\nHow he describes what he needs to someone who can't hear? I guess Diego makes himself understood, again this isnt something you might find a definitive explanation for, could be him doing the sign language. LOL! Imagine what you want. I think there was also later a reference to a small writing board, but that requires even more explanation why it wasn't mentioned from the start, or if it's not always there.\n\nIn the end you know he made himself understood.\n\nAnd you are right that most people are not aware of José and Bardoso, as I was one of the people who didn't learn about them until recently.\n\nThanks for the explanations about Barbados/Bardoso (\"Zorro Rides Again\" was published 9 years after \"The Further Adventures of Zorro\", so McCulley could have forgotten the name) and José.\n\nI does look like after the first few stories/novels they were somewhat fazed out, but like I said havent read them all. I wish they had been represented in other media.\n\nAnother detail, José rides a spotted horse, also he considers Diego a blood Brother.\n\nI do love both him and the Pirate Bardoso as characters, they were some of the better developed secondary characters and allies.\n\nJosé, leader of his tribe, was not a servant but an ally, was much more noble and independent character with his own motives. And the constant presence of a pirate who hung out in the seedier sides, really set it in a more swashbuckler atmosphere. He wished Zorro had been a Pirate with him, and believes they would have ruled the seas together.\n\nIf I remember correctly at Disney Land going through the Pirates ride and area, you transition towards Frontier Land, where there is a Rancho del Zocalo which is pretty much the perfect transition time and place for Zorro! From ---> Pirates ---> to Cali. Western\n\n...He'd have a foot in both those \"lands\".\n\nIf he would ever appear at Disney again.\n\nAs for Disney's Garcia, from what I have read I agree with you that he may be a fusion between Gonzales and McCulley's Garcia. I don't know when Garcia made his debut, but I know he appears in at least four stories: \"Zorro Draws A Blade\" (1944), \"Zorro Opens A Cage\" (1945), \"Zorro Lays A Ghost\" (1945), \"Zorro Frees Some Slaves\" (1946).\n\nLike I said there was an Esteban Garcia first introduced in Rides Again(1931), although he was more analogous to the Captains. A new Gonzalez is introduced in Mysterious Don Miguel (1935) who is a bit more like Disney's Garcia. Then is somewhat re-imagined as a new Garcia who first shows up in Zorro Draws his Blade(1944), who seems more like the character that would become the Disney version. Although there are still differences, I'll se if I can find the first descriptions of him.\n\nI guess it depends on our definition of \"costume\n\nAs long as people recognized him as Zorro and not a random bandit, and as long as people associated his clothes with his \"activity\", then I'd say we can call it a costume\n\nI conceded Im fine with the definition, MCulley himself referenced it as a costume.\n\nFor the record, there is a story where out of Los Angeles, Zorro shows up in a tavern, and those he confronts do mistake him for just a random bandit. \" It is only after he marks one with a Z do they realize that it is Zorro.\n\nSo they are familiar with him, although didn't recognize him as Zorro by what he wore, but only after he marks one.\n\nSo again not sure what you will make of that, if you seem to be looking for these definitive interpretations and lines drawn, you might not find them in the McCulleys stories.\n\neven though he didn't have fox ears or a Z on his chest. Incidentally, I dislike when Zorro carnival costumes have a Z on the clothes as much as I dislike when they are not all-black.\n\nLOL I am so with you on that! It bugs me when they put a \"Z\" on the clothes, the chest, the belt, or on the hat too! You know why, because it makes it look like a costume ! t:\n\nDo the stories also explain where he hides his black horse? Is the horse's hiding place in one of the underground secret passages like in the movies and tv series?\n\nAt least once they do take it with them into that cave of the old Indian sorceress, although I don't know if that's where he is kept.\n\nIn several cases its José, with who he earlier makes contact, and lets him know where and when he will need the Black (other times its Bernardo) . The implication is until then José keeps him hidden.\n\nWhere? In a hidden valley is described at least once or twice. In that cave? Doesn't always say.\n\nUsually after designating a place and time to meet, he will secretly bring him there at the time , often hiding by a gulch or somewhere near, until he hears the secret call.\n\nAlso convenient, Zorro can return him their to José, who then proceeds to ride him off leading the soldiers astray. \\\n\n\"Zorro sprang out of the saddle, and José of the Cocopahs sprang into it. The black started again, and again the ringing hoofs gave signal to those behind. Crouching in the brush, Zorro watched them ride furiously past chasing José, who had a way of losing them when he willed, and of caring for the black in a secret hiding place\"\n\nOther times, when at home, Bernardo has brought him from somewhere in the Vega estate.\n\nYou seem to be wondering if this was all ever consolidated into one single \"lair\" under the Hacienda, as per Fairbanks, and then Rides Again?\n\nI don't know, maybe in later stories.\n\nAnother passage in Zorro Deals With Treason(1934), describes coming towards his Fathers Hacienda, going into a hut at the rear of the patio, then going through a tunnel that leads into the house.\n\nSo the set up is there, apears to be tunnels throughout, and acces to secret lairs, like a fox would have.\n\nAncestor? Did you mean \"descendent\",\n\nYes meant descendant, also in Rides Again serial the horse is the implied descendant of Zorro's original horse.\n\nTrivia: in that 1937 serial, the picture of Don Diego is that of Douglas Fairbanks. It would be interesting to have a list of all the innovations to the Zorro mythos brought by Fairbanks.\n\nI absolutely consider Fairbanks Zorros second father. The Argosy illustrator in the first and some later stories did not do the character justice, as McCulley was vague in some aspects, and allowed for interpretation, it is really Fairbanks that would come to define much of his look, then adapted by Power, and Disney.\n\nAs far as the mask specific, Im fine with either the full mask or the half mask as being correct.\n\nAs some times when McCulley described it as a full mask, illustrators ignored it and used the Fairbanks style, other times when he left it vague, they used either the full mask or half.\n\nBy \"vigilante\" I mean someone who fights against bandits to ensure their capture because he thinks the authorities cannot catch them without his help.\n\nBy \"freedom fighter\" I mean someone who fight against the authorities because he believes they are oppressing the people.\n\nZorro is both a vigilante and a freedom fighter, but in \"The Curse of Capistrano\" he is only a freedom fighter (and a highwayman who steals from the rich to give to the poor, Robin Hood-style, something rarely kept in adaptations) and not a vigilante. That's why I was wondering which was the first McCulley story with Zorro as a vigilante.\n\nNot sure if McCulley always or ever followed that firm distinction. And dont particularly agree with the assessment that he is only a freedom fighter as you describe in Curse/Mask and not a vigilante too. My understanding is as I said he was both. Even in Curse/Mask, the implication is he has already been doing this for a while: Not just robbing the rich who have exploited the poor, but against anyone who has raised a hand against the Campesinos, Indians or the Freys.\n\nI don't think there is one single place where he stops being one, then becomes the other, like the firm line you draw.\n\nAs far as stories, in Further Adventures he is up against Pirates, who sack, pillage the town, while at the same time trying to win back his kidnapped bride to be.\n\nIs he Vigilante or Freedom Fighter there?\n\nIn Rides again, he his trying to clear his own name of atrocities falsley put on him, both secret and civilian identity.\n\nSaves a Friend he is protecting a friend, who has been swindled by a notorious card shark.\n\nSo, you have answered all my questions except one: in which story do Diego and Lolita mary, and in which story (and of which cause) does Lolita die? I don't mind spoilers. Also, does Diego have other loves in subsequent stories?\n\nI skipped it, cause I don't really know the answer.\n\nIn Mysterious Don Miguel(1935), a character called Carmelita arrives, and her father are guests at the Vega house, where it's whispered she is meant to be married to Diego if he takes a liking to her. And Diego seems fine with the prospect.\n\nNo mention is made of Lolita Pulido here, who have already been absent for several stories.\n\nI believe I read all of the stories except one up till there, Zorro Hunts by Night(1940), so if her departure and death happened, it may have happened there ?\n\nBut I remember reading a summery of The Sign of Zorro(1941) (which comes right after), and they seem to have made mention of that there.\n\nSo yeah, I personally don't know where that was described. Never read it myself.\n\nI would love to know as well.\n\n^\n\nInteresting to note, as far as cover image, at this point Argosy had from then on standardized their covers, and had a regular occurring image of Zorro on them (maybe based on Power), representation that used the half mask.\n\nIT CONTINUES FROM MY LAST MESSAGE; SORRY FOR THE LONG DELAY.\n\nThis is a common description, he often gives Bernardo instructions, and it is often Bernardo who preps and brings him his horse and gear.\n\nHow he describes what he needs to someone who can't hear? I guess Diego makes himself understood, again this isnt something you might find a definitive explanation for, could be him doing the sign language. LOL! Imagine what you want. I think there was also later a reference to a small writing board, but that requires even more explanation why it wasn't mentioned from the start, or if it's not always there.\n\nIn the end you know he made himself understood.\n\nGood to see that Bernardo has a bigger role in later works than in \"The Curse of Capistrano\". And while this seems to contradict the original claim that Bernardo cannot understand sign language, I think the change is for the better.\n\nLike I said there was an Esteban Garcia first introduced in Rides Again(1931), although he was more analogous to the Captains. A new Gonzalez is introduced in Mysterious Don Miguel (1935) who is a bit more like Disney's Garcia. Then is somewhat re-imagined as a new Garcia who first shows up in Zorro Draws his Blade(1944), who seems more like the character that would become the Disney version. Although there are still differences, I'll se if I can find the first descriptions of him.\n\nThis confirms my idea about the origin of Disney's Garcia.\n\nI conceded Im fine with the definition, MCulley himself referenced it as a costume.\n\nFor the record, there is a story where out of Los Angeles, Zorro shows up in a tavern, and those he confronts do mistake him for just a random bandit. \" It is only after he marks one with a Z do they realize that it is Zorro.\n\nSo they are familiar with him, although didn't recognize him as Zorro by what he wore, but only after he marks one.\n\nSo again not sure what you will make of that, if you seem to be looking for these definitive interpretations and lines drawn, you might not find them in the McCulleys stories.\n\nWell, you said the scene in question takes place OUTSIDE Los Angeles, so maybe that's the reason why they thought he was a random bandit. I think people from Los Angeles do recognize him as Zorro, isn't it true?\n\nLOL I am so with you on that! It bugs me when they put a \"Z\" on the clothes, the chest, the belt, or on the hat too! You know why, because it makes it look like a costume ! t:\n\nI agree with you, not because it makes it look like a costume but because it doesn't match any of the offical portrayals of how the character dresses. Indeed, the Zorro costume I wore as a kid for Carnival was all-black and had no Z, and that's because I wanted it that way. Everyone else had some Z on the clothes and/or part of the clothes were of another color.\n\nAt least once they do take it with them into that cave of the old Indian sorceress, although I don't know if that's where he is kept.\n\nIn several cases its José, with who he earlier makes contact, and lets him know where and when he will need the Black (other times its Bernardo) .

Hopefully I will learn more details about this.\n\nI absolutely consider Fairbanks Zorros second father.\n\nInnovations to the Zorro mythos introduced by Fairbanks are, hoping there are few or no mistakes in the following list:\n\n*the distinctive costume;\n\n*the moustaches, even if they are fake here;\n\nthe fact that Zorro is sometimes called that instead of always being Señor Zorro;\n\n*popularization of the Z motif, though unlike what some sources say it wasn't invented for the film but was already present in the first novel. Plus, in the film he also uses it on objects and people's clothes, not just people's faces;\n\n*Zorro being an acrobat, a parkour artist we could say;\n\n*Zorro outwitting/defeating countless soldiers at the same time;\n\n*Zorro learning swordsmanship in Spain, though him being summoned home from Spain didn't originate until Power;\n\n*secret pssage/hidden hideout for the horse;\n\n*horse being black;\n\n*Bernardo not being deaf;\n\n*Bernardo knowing Zorro's secret identity\n\n*Diego living with his father;\n\n*Zorro disguising himself as a priest;\n\n*Zorro laughing while fighting.\n\nAs some times when McCulley described it as a full mask, illustrators ignored it and used the Fairbanks style, other times when he left it vague, they used either the full mask or half.\n\nSo, there's no proof of McCulley ever describing a half-face mask in his text, right?\n\nNot sure if McCulley always or ever followed that firm distinction. And dont particularly agree with the assessment that he is only a freedom fighter as you describe in Curse/Mask and not a vigilante too. My understanding is as I said he was both. Even in Curse/Mask, the implication is he has already been doing this for a while: Not just robbing the rich who have exploited the poor, but against anyone who has raised a hand against the Campesinos, Indians or the Freys.\n\nI don't think there is one single place where he stops being one, then becomes the other, like the firm line you draw.\n\nAs far as stories, in Further Adventures he is up against Pirates, who sack, pillage the town, while at the same time trying to win back his kidnapped bride to be.\n\nIs he Vigilante or Freedom Fighter there?\n\nIn Rides again, he his trying to clear his own name of atrocities falsley put on him, both secret and civilian identity.\n\nSaves a Friend he is protecting a friend, who has been swindled by a notorious card shark.\n\nYou have a good point about the distinction between vigilante and freedom fighter is not always that evident, and the lines often blur.\n\nA couple of random observations you might appreciate:\n\n-Age: McCulley describes Diego as being about 25yo in Zorro Saves a Friend(1932)\n\nThis matches \"The Curse of Capistrano\", in which Diego is described as \"a fair youth of excellent blood and twenty-four years\".\n\n-Voice: Diego changes his voice when he is Zorro (not surprising), described in MDM(1935)\n\nOnce again, this matches \"The Curse of Capistrano\".\n\nI did say \"may\" have inspired, never implied it was \"100% based on him\" , was posting it as a curiosity after the more fun Disney one. He definitely influenced the Spielberg/Amblin version of the character.\n\nI agree with you completley, the vid and others, should be taken with caution as to what actually inspired McCulley, the wikipedia is also full of statements of historical and fictional characters, declared as \"the\" inspiration for Zorro.\n\nAl of them should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nTrue, you did say that, in fact my comment was directed to other people who avoid saying \"may\" and treat it as a proven fact. By the way, I have to rectify something. I previously said \"I can't find any pre-1998 source that compared Zorro to him [Murrieta] or vice versa\". Now I have found at least one example: the 1991 book \"The Legend of Zorro\" by Bill Yenne wrote \"McCulley may have drawn inspiration from a number of California legends, including contemporaries of the infamous bandito Joaquin Murieta (1830-1853)\". Of course it's only speculation, but it's a pre-1998 speculation, and that's why I thought I had to rectify my previous text. Incidentally, I like how the author used \"may\".\n\nI grew up reading some Emilio Salgari, particularly Sandokan & the Black Corsair two spectacular antecedents to Zorro.\n\nI am glad you like Italian works. By the way, Disney's Zorro is still ofter reaired on Italian TV. At the moment it's aired every Sunday morning on Rai 3, one of the main channels. Four days ago they aired episode 1x14, after a hiatus of few weeks due to holidays. Occasionally the series airs on late afternoon, or on evening, before diner time, or pre-prime time. I think it's probbly the only show that old that is still reaired on mainstream channels. How about the USA? Is the series still reaired sometimes?\n\nThis, when I realized it came as big surprise, but not surprisingly both inside and out in the courtyard and balconies is where a large part of the stories and set up occurred, so it makes since it would be in a sound-stage, great image above!\n\nTrivia: the de la Vega hacienda set was often redressed to appear as other people's hacienda, or as other buildings. On the other hand, the cuartel, tavern, church, etc. weere not soundstages but permanent exteriors on the Disney back lot. Sadly, they were later destroyed.\n\nThe Zorro locations, both in the soundstage and in the back lot, also appeared in other Disney productions.\n\nAnother great old Zorro site- modeled the entire Hacienda in 3D, full of visual references. - Hacienda 3D - Zorro\n\nThis is a true fan, I love it.\n\nAnd an actual model, small soldier scale - Zorro\n\nI knew about these, interesting websites! Of course, they had to make guesses, since in real life they didn't build a full house inside the soundstage. Note how other buildings occasionally stood in for the hacienda: for example, the back of the tavern often doubled for the back of the hacienda.\n\nThanks for all the info about the Zorro-Batman connection. I'll examine it when I have more time.\n\n19901993 Zorro Ep. The Wizard\n\nHypothetical ancestor of Wayne, actually shows up in Zorro.\n\n(not exact dialogue)\n\nFor the record, Zorro says \"My apologies. But the location of this place must remain a secret\", and then removes the blindfold. Dr. Wayne's reply is indeed \"Incredible! A secret cave! How splendid!\"\n\nI have to update an old message of mine, and this includes two basic corrections.\n\nWe then cut to the entrance covered by greenery, with a stick to prevent Tornado from escaping. This location seems very similar to the East entrance seen from the inside, as shown in the YouTube video above, but I was told by an Iverson expert that the actual cave is not that large, meaning the location was recreated in the studio.\n\nAfter another in-depth discussion with the same Iverson expert about three months ago, we came to the opposite conclusion: the two scenes set at the cave's back entrance seen from inside, like in the following shot...\n\nwere filmed in the actual cave rather than in a soundstage or another exterior location. Here is a recent image of the back entrance seen from inside:\n\nI added a couple of circles to show the proof that they are the same place:\n\nI wonder why did they bother to make it so similar to the real entrance which wouldn't even be shown in any scene, but a strong clue that this is indeed a studio location is Diego's ribbon, which is tidy again. This doesn't necessarily mean the scene was shown together with the scene in which he comes out of the tunnel, since Diego's ribbon is tidy most of the time. On the other hand, the scene with the messy ribbon is the only one which was shot at the actual cave, while the scene before it and the one after it were not.\n\nThat was one misleading clue. It's true that Diego's ribbon is untidy when he is on one end of the cave (not shown below), then tidy in both scenes where he is on the other end , then untidy again when he returns to the original position:\n\nHowever, this doesn't prove that these two scenes were fimed in two different places. It only means the scenes were not shot in sequence, and the ribbon changed its position between the filming of one scene and that of the next one.\n\nDiego and Bernardo then walk through the greenery and emerge outside:\n\nI can't say for sure if the greenery shots from the inside and from the outside were shot at the same location, but it may be. The Iverson expert doesn't think the outside lcation is the actual East entrance of Zorro's Cave, and I think he is right because I noticed that there wouldn't be the space for all the greenery wall, which is longer in the video than in the two pictures above, and we don't even see where it ends.\n\nLook at this video from film historian Bill Sasser, who died recently:\n\nFrom 6:14 to 6:46 we see Zorro's Cave, and the still image that starts at 6:41 shows that there is no room for the greenery wall to continue at the left of the entrance, especially if you use the following two pictures to get an idea of the measures of the place compared to a human being:\n\nWe were also wrong about this. The following shots...\n\n... were also filmed at the actual Zorro's Cave. For proof, see the following picture, which is the back of Zorro's Cave as it appears in 2014:\n\nAll three pictures have a yellow circle pointing to the same hole in the rock. There are some optical illusions at work here, since it looks bigger in the first image compared to the second, and it looks closer to the entrance in the first two pictures compared to the third. But the hole is definitely the same.\n\nA distinctive vine has been outlined in light blue in the first two images to better compare them. Of course, the vine is fake like all the foliage covering the entrance.\n\nSo, if the greenery scenes above weren't filmed at the actual cave, where were they filmed? Maybe they were filmed at the Disney studio, and indeed this link...\n\nThe Mark of Zorro Johnston McCulley Forge Books @ Books and knowledge\n\n... contains the following message from a certail Jamail:\n\n\"One of the highlights of my life was an employee tour of the Walt Disney Studio when I got to walk up to a bushy outgrowth on the perimeter of the studio property, which turned out to be the area where Zorro was filmed emerging from the cave on Toronado.\"\n\nI tried contacting her for more details, but so far I have been unable to do so. Maybe someone else will know something about these employee tours.\n\nI already explained wat's wrong with the question above.\n\nThe employee tour thing is still a mystery, though: how could a bushy outgrowth on the perimeter of the Disney studio property have been used as Zorro's Cave, since we know that they used a real cave at Iverson for episode 2 and a soundstage in episode 8? Unless in the latter they only used a soundstage for the inside, and a different location for the outside, but there's not definite proof for this. Of course, it's possible that the whole employee tour thing is a hoax.\n\nJULY 2019 UPDATE: I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN CONTACTING HER. HERE IS HER ANSWER.\n\nBack to Diego and Bernardo: after another camera cut/set switch, they leave the Sphinx/Harum Scarum Cluster/Old Yeller Tree area and are again in front of the greenery, which was probably at the Disney studio. They come back \"inside\", which is a studio shot, then the camera cuts to the West entrance, and Diego's ribbon is messy again, despite the fact that it was still tidy while he was at the fake entrance witht he greenery: another proof of the set switch.\n\nAs per what I said above: the changing ribbon doesn't prove anything, and we know now that there wasn't any set switch here."
