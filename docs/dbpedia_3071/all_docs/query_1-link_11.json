        "text": "And whether any actual thieves wore a mask similar to Zorro.\n\nZorro has worn several different styles of masks in his 101-year history. The character was created in 1919 by pulp fiction writer, Johnston McCulley (1883–1958). Zorro, which of course is the Spanish word for “fox,” appeared first in a serialized novel, published by All-Story Weekly, a pulp magazine owned by Frank Munsey. It was called The Curse of Capistrano.\n\n1. A Full-face mask.\n\nIn the novel, Don Diego Vega (the character later got the “de la” inserted into his name, which was more aristocratic — Don Diego de la Vega) wore a mask that covered his entire face.\n\nFor example, McCulley describes Zorro this way in the novel: “Before her stood a man whose body was enveloped in a long cloak, and whose face was covered with a black mask so that she could see nothing of his features except his glittering eyes.” (Curse of Capistrano, pp. 63–64).\n\nAnd, when Don Diego and his love interest, Lolita Pulido, were about to kiss we learn that “he bent swiftly, raised the bottom of his mask, and touched her lips with his.” (Curse of Capistrano, p. 108)."
