        "text": "Real name: Louise Schultz\n\n1921 - 1997\n\nBorn October 11, 1921 in Long Beach, California, Linda Stirling became a prolific western and serial heroine at Republic Pictures during the mid to late 1940s. And she is probably best remembered for her work in cliffhangers THE TIGER WOMAN (1944), ZORRO'S BLACK WHIP (1944), MANHUNT OF MYSTERY ISLAND (1945), THE PURPLE MONSTER STRIKES (1945), THE CRIMSON GHOST (1946), more.\n\nStirling was under a term player contract(s) with Republic Pictures from April, 1944 through March, 1947. That provided her with security and a regular paycheck but Republic could utilize her as much as they wanted during the contract period. At Republic, she did twenty-four films in 1944 - 1947, and those were a mix of serials, westerns, and other features.\n\nShe married screenwriter Sloan Nibley in 1946 (he passed away in 1990). Soon after their marriage, Stirling retired to raise a family.\n\nShe did appear in a few 1950s TV programs. Later in life, she earned degrees in English Literature from UCLA and became an English and literature teacher at Glendale College.\n\nLinda received a Golden Boot award at the 1983 awards ceremony.\n\nShe passed away from cancer on July 20, 1997 at her Studio City, California home.\n\nAlthough some of the data is incomplete or inaccurate, the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) has information on Linda Stirling: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0830549/\n\nDeath notice for Linda Stirling in the August 9, 1997 Los Angeles Times newspaper: https://www.newspapers.com/clip/110497868/death-notice-for-serial-queen-linda/\n\nFind A Grave has a record on Linda Stirling but her interment information is unknown: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/40652118/linda-stirling\n\nDaniel Neyer's \"The Files of Jerry Blake\" website has a webpage on Linda Stirling in serials: https://filesofjerryblake.com/serial-heroines/linda-stirling/"
