        "text": "Early years\n\nThe daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Alex Schultz, Stirling was born Louise Schultz in Long Beach, California. She attended Burnett Grammar School, George Washington Junior High School, and Long Beach Polytechnic High School.\n\nShe began studying drama when she was 12, and she eventually studied for two years at Ben Bard's Academy of Dramatic Arts. She also was active in the Long Beach Players' Guild.\n\nStirling worked as a model for photographers and acted in summer stock theater.\n\nFilm\n\nIn the book In the Nick of Time: Motion Picture Sound Serials, William C. Cline wrote, \"Of the characteristics necessary in a heroine, Linda Stirling possessed all — presence, wholesomeness, beauty and versatility — and any single one would have been sufficient in her case.\"\n\nStirling's first role was as a model in The Powers Girl in 1943 and her first role in a serial was the title character in The Tiger Woman (1944). She was featured as the heroine in Zorro's Black Whip (1944).\n\nAfter her marriage, she essentially retired from films to raise a family, although she later appeared in occasional episodes of television shows, beginning in 1952.\n\nLater years\n\nAfter her career as an actress ended, and her children had grown, Stirling enrolled at UCLA, eventually earning a BFA, an MA, and finally a PhD in English literature at the age of 50. With her degree in hand, Stirling began a new career as a teacher of college English and Drama in the 1960s at Glendale College in Glendale, California between 1967 and 1990.\n\nIn her later life, Stirling sought to distance herself in the classroom from her Hollywood past, but still remained active on the film convention circuit until the last years of her life. She also appeared in a 1990 documentary on Republic Pictures, the studio where she did the bulk of her work.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1946, she married Republic screenwriter Sloan Nibley. They had two sons.\n\nDeath\n\nStirling died of cancer in Studio City, Los Angeles, California in 1997.\n\nRecognition\n\nStirling was one of the original winners of the Golden Boot Awards in 1983 for her contributions to western cinema."
