        "text": "A welcoming new house for it's residents! Thankyou for sharing G&S Vastgoed 😊 Name of the project \"De IJ-Loods\" Design is a visionary concept. A designer can already see the result of a project in his mind's eye. Even if it's just on that retina: the building, complex, office, residential area is already there. At that moment, all kinds of things can be brushed up, sawn off, added, raised, fitted. In the design phase, you can't help but communicate creatively. In the communication between two parties, the most fruitful question is: how do you envision that? Everyone involved has a result in mind. And all those results need to consolidate into one optimal result as quickly as possible. Good communication in this phase is the adequate articulation of a vision. ‘Business is social, so we like to connect relevant people with exciting projects’ Bron credits die bouwen aan nieuwbouw voor morgen: G&S Vastgoed VolkerWessels Vastgoed Woonstichting Lieven de Key CKSA\n\nA very important factor to consider in every project and can not be overlooked.
