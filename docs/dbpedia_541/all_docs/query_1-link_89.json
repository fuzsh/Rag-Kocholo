        "text": "York County President Judge Stephen Linebaugh ruled Wednesday that York City Councilman Michael Helfrich can keep his post despite his felony convictions.\n\nWhat that means statewide has yet to be determined.\n\nHelfrich, who pleaded guilty to two felony counts of possession with intent to deliver in 1991, was elected to council in November.\n\nAttorneys for York Mayor Kim Bracey argued in a complaint filed shortly afterward that Helfrich's crimes should prohibit him from serving in office.\n\nThe state constitution bars those convicted of \"infamous crimes\" from serving in public office, and state courts have ruled several times that infamous crimes include felonies and crimes of deception.\n\nBut according to Linebaugh's decision, those cases were based on the understanding that infamous crimes involved \"falsehood\" or \"affecting the public administration of justice.\"\n\nDrug crimes, such as Helfrich's, do not fit that standard, Linebaugh wrote.\n\n\"Drug crimes are not the same sort of crime as embezzlement, bribery or perjury,\" he wrote. \"Drug crimes are certainly not crimes of falsehood.\"\n\nLinebaugh's ruling acknowledged that his decision differed from existing case law.\n\n\"This Court declines to follow what some would argue is the current position of the (state) Supreme Court,\" he wrote.\n\nHelfrich, who received the decision via fax machine in his attorney's office Wednesday morning, said he had been pacing the room and trying to digest the news.\n\n\"It certainly seems like the fact that the public knew who they were electing and knew about my past - that I was honest about my past and that the will of the voters was to still have me in office - seems to be a key to his decision,\" Helfrich said.\n\nHelfrich spoke with the York Daily Record/Sunday News about his convictions prior to the 2011 primary, and fliers funded by his opponent, former Councilwoman Toni Smith, publicized the issue. Helfrich detailed his past drug use under oath during a hearing held on the dispute in April.\n\nNearly four months passed before Linebaugh issued the decision, but Helfrich said he had no expectations ahead of time.\n\n\"I thought from the beginning that this was not in my hands,\" he said. \"I trusted that the proper decision would be made. And in this case, I'd say I greatly agree with the decision.\"\n\nReached for comment Wednesday, Bracey said that she had not yet read the decision and was not prepared speak about it. City Solicitor Don Hoyt was unavailable throughout the day.\n\nSmith said she was not surprised by the decision. But the city should appeal, she said.\n\n\"The mayor has to appeal,\" Smith said. The Supreme Court has the authority rule statewide and has ruled in the past that felonies are infamous crimes, she said.\n\nHelfrich said he did not expect the city to file an appeal. He would not speculate about how he would react were an appeal to be filed.\n\n\"I think for right now I want to catch my breath,\" he said. \"I can now get on with the work of figuring out ways to stimulate the economy of York and reduce taxes without any shadow or question over my head.\"\n\nJudge in Helfrich case: These specific crimes aren't 'infamous'\n\nIn a 35-page ruling issued Wednesday that allows York City Councilman Michael Helfrich to keep his seat, York County President Judge Stephen P. Linebaugh did not say felony drug crimes are not always infamous crimes.\n\nThe judge did say that Helfrich's particular felony drug convictions were not infamous crimes.\n\nLinebaugh then dismissed the complaint seeking to have Helfrich removed from office.\n\nIn his final opinion, Linebaugh analyzed the matter, delving into what is an infamous crime under established case law and the Pennsylvania Constitution. He also took note of Helfrich's character and the will of the people of York.\n\nIn the legal analysis, Linebaugh found that Helfrich's specific drug convictions were not infamous crimes under any case law dating back to 1842, when the state had no drug crime laws.\n\nHe agreed with the state Supreme Court that an infamous crime that would bar someone from office included the obvious - \"treason, felony ... forgery, perjury, subordination of perjury ... and other offenses ... which involve charges of falsehood and affect the public administration of justice.\"\n\nThe judge noted that Helfrich's criminal background was widely publicized well before the primary. And that after Helfrich lost in the primary, he mounted a successful write-in campaign for the general election, resulting in more articles about his crimes.\n\n\"In the present case, it is the will of the people of York that Mr. Helfrich, whose crimes and convictions were well-publicized and known, serve on city council,\" Linebaugh said.\n\nLinebaugh also evaluated whether Helfrich's crimes \"are within a classification inconsistent with 'commonly accepted principles of honest and decency.'\" He compared that with the Supreme Court's findings that former Wrightsville Mayor Stephen Rambler's extortion conviction was \"quite obviously 'inconsistent with commonly accepted principles ...'\"\n\nElected in 2006, Rambler was ousted from office in 2008 because of 1996 conviction for soliciting sexually explicit photographs through swinger magazines and then demanding $50 from responders to keep him from publicizing the pictures.\n\nLinebaugh said the Supreme Court found Rambler's actions \"akin to 'swindling, cheating and other crimes of a kindred nature.'\"\n\nLinebaugh also acknowledged Helfrich's community service background, a history of volunteerism dating back to 1983 and awards from the county and city for his work on the Codorus Creek.\n\n-RICK LEE, Daily Record/Sunday News\n\nHelfrich ruling difficult to apply\n\nWednesday's ruling from York County President Judge Stephen Linebaugh could set precedent in cases statewide, but it could be difficult to apply, said Michael Dimino, an associate professor of election law at Widener Law School.\n\nThe decision hinges on two important questions, Dimino said. The first is whether the court should defer to the legislative classification of a crime - felony or otherwise. In that matter, Linebaugh concludes, rightly in Dimino's opinion, that the answer is no.\n\nJust because the legislature determines a crime to be serious doesn't resolve the matter for Constitutional purposes, Dimino said.\n\n\"If there was some big tough on crime movement and they made every crime on the books a felony, not every crime would be an infamous one,\" he said.\n\nThe second question is whether a drug offense should constitute an infamous crime. Linebaugh concludes that Helfrich's crime - under the specific circumstances that it was committed - does not. But such a narrow ruling could be overturned by an appellate court, Dimino said.\n\n\"I don't know that it's wrong,\" he said. \"I think that a higher court should take a look at it, and that's going to be difficult.\"\n\nBecause it is so specific to Helfrich, Linebaugh's decision creates no rule to govern future cases, Dimino said. That disserves the public, he said.\n\n\"If you - if any court - makes a rule (about) what it means by infamous crimes, they should make some kind of rule that can be administered by people, whether it's people trying to run for office, people deciding who to vote for, people deciding to bring these kinds of actions (or) judges who are supposed to enforce them.\"\n\n-EMILY OPILO, Daily Record/Sunday News\n\nHelfrich's crime, plea and sentence\n\nOn Jan. 23, 1991, Michael Helfrich said, he was hanging out in a house in the 200 block of Roosevelt Avenue with several people who were doing acid.\n\nInside the house, with Helfrich, was a man who was selling acid and a friend who was buying, Helfrich said.\n\nThe buyer had become so high that he was \"burning a pile of money and saying (the) baby his girlfriend was pregnant with was the second coming of Jesus,\" Helfrich said.\n\nAccording to Helfrich, the buyer offered to give his car to the seller so that he could drive to Harrisburg to catch a flight.\n\nHelfrich said he intervened and offered to drive the seller in the car instead. Helfrich and the seller were arrested as they left the home.\n\nHelfrich pleaded guilty to two counts of felony possession with intent to deliver LSD and psylosibin mushrooms and misdemeanor possession of marijuana.\n\nAt the time, Tom Kearney, now the York County District Attorney, represented Helfrich. According to a footnote in President Judge Stephen P. Linebaugh's ruling Wednesday on Helfrich's legal right to remain in office, Helfrich said he did not know the LSD and mushrooms were \"to be delivered to a third party and ... stated that the 2,000 portions of LSD could have been for (the 'seller's) personal use.\"\n\nFollowing is the exchange between Judge John H. Chronister, Helfrich and Kearney.\n\nChronister: \"From the amount, you would assume that (it was for delivery), wouldn't you?\"\n\nHelfrich: \"But he eats a lot.\"\n\nChronister: \"Nobody eats 2,000 ....\"\n\nHelfrich: \"Trust me. Trust me.\"\n\nKearney: \"This gentleman might, your honor.\"\n\nChronister sentenced Helfrich to time served - 45 days - to 23 months in prison for the felonies and 30 days probation for the marijuana.\n\nSee details, reaction below from York Daily Record reporters Emily Opilo and Rick Lee, along with comments from social media.\n\nRead the decision:"
