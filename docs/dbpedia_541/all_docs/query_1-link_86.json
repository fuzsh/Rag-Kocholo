Residents were ordered to hang a lantern outside of their homes at nightfall. Even then, urban lighting was installed as a public safety measure, allowing residents to leverage illumination to avoid being attacked or mugged. Baltimore was the first city...\n\nRead More\n\nThe central thesis for the Blueforce IoT and shared situational awareness software platform began to form in 2008 after a meeting with a US DoD special operations commander who described a problem he was experiencing; one that we had heard several years prior during the early days of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).
