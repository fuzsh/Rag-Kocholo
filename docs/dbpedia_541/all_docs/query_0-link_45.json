        "text": "Helfrich River Outfitter Inc\n\nMEET THE HELFRICH TEAM!\n\nKen Helfrich\n\nOUTFITTER / OWNER\n\nI was raised along the banks of the McKenzie River in Oregon. As a kid I spent a lot of time exploring and fishing small streams. My family had boys’ fly-fishing camps Read More\n\nthat I would participate and work in during the summers. I started helping my dad as a swamper on the Middle Fork of the Salmon trips when I was 13. I started guiding as soon as I was able to get a guides’ license. Being on a river has always been a passion of mine. Coming from a river running and fishing family, I was able to learn river skills at a young age. My life experiences running rivers has been spectacular. Hard to believe that I have been working on these astonishing rivers for over 55 years.\n\nI always enjoy sharing my knowledge with my crew and seeing them develop into great guides. My wife Sherill has always been supportive of my lifestyle as a guide and Outfitter. She has helped me continue to take on the challenges of running a business. We made the move to Idaho and love living close to our Idaho operations. Our daughter Kelsey grew up close to the river as I did and along with her husband Kidd, taking our family business into the next generation.\n\nThrough years of hard work, I am very proud of our successes of carrying on the Helfrich tradition of great service and running great river trips. We continue to have a fabulous crew of loyal and dedicated guides and employees. We love our returning guests who become some of our closest friends. I am a Blessed Man.\n\nSherill Helfrich\n\nRIVER MOM\n\nHi, I am Sherill Helfrich, often referred to as the river mom, the glue or the rock of the Helfrich clan and crew. Kenny and I have been married since 1980 and we are the Read More\n\nproud parents of Kelsey and grandparents to our adorable Miss Fallon and Miss Quinn. I am also happy to be Kidd’s “mom”!\n\nI grew up in Junction City, Oregon and spent a lot of time on the river with my family. Thanks to my Dad, he taught me to fly fish and love the outdoors. I knew that when I first met Kenny and found out that he had a drift boat and loved to fish that he was a real catch!\n\nI enjoyed a 31year career as a Lane County Oregon Land Use Planner. I have been “retired” since 2008 and love spending time as part of the HRO team by doing a lot of behind the scenes work, meeting our clients both before and after their river trips and spending more time on the river.\n\nWhen I’m not working, nothing is better than family time, running rivers, fly fishing and exploring the beauty of Idaho and Oregon. I also like gardening and working on building and remodeling projects.\n\nI have been so blessed to be involved in our family business and I especially enjoy being able to join my family, clients and crew on the river. The best benefit has been the opportunity to meet our wonderful clients, many of whom have become dear friends as well.\n\nPlease give me a shout if you ever have questions about any of our trips or if you want a woman’s perspective about spending time on the river. I am always happy to help with any questions or needs that you may have to help you prepare for your upcoming river trip with Helfrich River Outfitter.\n\nKelsey Helfrich\n\nOUTFITTER / OWNER\n\nI feel so lucky to have been born into the Helfrich Family. As a fourth generation guide in Idaho and fifth generation in Oregon, the river is in my blood. Read More\n\nAs the managing partner in the business, I love dedicating my time to furthering this amazing company that my family has dedicated their lives to since 1922. I get to spend my time working alongside my parents, my husband and some of my best friends as we all working together towards the common goal of providing the best experience we can for our guests. Running a boat and the opportunity to introduce people to the beautiful rivers of the Northwest is a true passion for me.\n\nI grew up along the banks of the McKenzie River in Oregon and have been in a boat since before I could walk. As I grew, so did my love of the river and the outdoor lifestyle. When I was 2 years old I got to go on my first trip on the Middle Fork of the Salmon and at 5 I went on my first big commercial over-night trip on the Main Salmon. Growing up, I spent most of my time in the summer, tagging along on McKenzie trips with my dad as a swamper on the pontoon. At the age of 12 I graduated up to running my own raft down the Wild and Scenic Section of the Rogue River followed soon after by the Main Salmon Canyon and the Middle Fork of the Salmon. I got my first Oregon guides license at the age of 16 and started guiding paddle rafting trips on the Upper McKenzie. Being an outfitters kid, I was raised learning the whole business, both on the river and working in the office. I guess you can say I have been training to be an outfitter my whole life.\n\nWorking on the river made for an awesome summer job throughout high school and college. Following in the footsteps of my Granddad Dave, I went to the College of Forestry at Oregon State University. I graduated from OSU in 2007 with degrees in Forestry Recreation Resource Management and a minor in Cultural and Geologic Studies of the Pacific Northwest. After graduation I had more time to expand my guiding career, both on the river and in the office. Being out of school also gave me lots of time to spend skiing in the winters and living in Park City.\n\nIn 2009 I met Kidd Youren and soon knew that he was the man I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. Kidd started working on the Middle Fork with our crew in 2011 and quickly proved himself as a great boatman, guide and leader on all of the rivers that we run. Kidd and I got married in September of 2013 at the Eagle Rock Lodge on the McKenzie. Kidd and I love guiding together and make a great team.\n\nIn January of 2017 Kidd and I welcomed a beautiful baby girl into the world. Little Miss Fallon Elery Helfrich-Youren changed out lives in ways we didn’t even know we wanted. Fallon shares her middle name, Elery, with her Great-Great-Granddad Prince Helfrich, giving her yet another connection to the river. Fallon took her first boat ride at three months old, on the day of my Granddad Dave Helfrich’s celebration of life on the McKenzie. In her first year of life she got to experience lots of adventures including multiple overnight river trips and at 8 months old Fallon went with her Great-Gran TerBear and I on a 4-day steelhead fishing drift boat trip on the Rogue River. It won’t be long and Fallon will be tagging along, working on river trips, just like I did.\n\nIn 2022 we were blessed with another wonderful little girl named Quinn Sterling Helfrich-Youren who has blessed our lives and completed our family. Quinn, like her sister has already logged many river miles and loves being on the water. Both of our girls are lucky to have not only an extensive family history with the Helfrich side, but with the Youren side as well.\n\nKidd, Fallon, Quinn and I live in Salmon Idaho and are so excited to continue building a life for ourselves. It is so nice living close to my parents and many of our guides/friends. We get to spend lots of time together on the river and love all of the fun outdoor activities that we can do together as a family. We feel so blessed to be carrying on Helfrich Family legacy as our girls spend time on these amazing rivers as the sixth generation of the Helfrich family floating rivers.\n\nLearn more about Kelsey: https://www.helfrichoutfitter.com/usfs-frankly-speaking-newsletter-outfitter-corner-kelsey-helfrich/.\n\nhttps://www.helfrichoutfitter.com/women-of-america-outdoors-kelsey-helfrich/\n\nKidd Youren\n\nOUTFITTER / GUIDE\n\nI started guiding for Helfrich River Outfitters about a year after I met Kelsey, the love of my life and the mother of my two beautiful daughters, Fallon and Quinn. Read More\n\nI had never worked on a river crew, I had never rowed a boat and I really didn’t even know the difference between an oar and a paddle. But with great teachers and mentors like my father-in-law Ken Helfrich, his dad Dave and my wife Kelsey, I was able to learn the tricks of the trade.\n\nI was born into and raised in the outfitting industry. My dad, Dusty Youren, was a hunting outfitter in Idaho, Nevada, Utah and British Columbia. He was also a 5th generation Idaho rancher and a true all-round cowboy. So I grew up being around a lot of hunting, the outdoors, horses and rodeos. I rode my first horse the day after I was born and went to my first cougar tree before I could walk. I had the opportunity to help my parents run a ranch on the Nevada Utah Border, 120 miles from the nearest town. As well as my dad’s hunting area in British Columbia. I guess you could say I had a childhood that prepped me to be an outfitter and outdoorsman.\n\nI bought my first hunting area and became an outfitter when I was 19 years old. When all my friends were going off to college and getting 9 to 5 jobs, I had been saving my money from rodeos, training horses and guiding. I used that money and with a little help from my dad and brother Harry was able to buy a hunting area on the Middle Fork of the Boise River in Idaho. Harry and I still take bear and cougar hunters on that area when I am not on the river.\n\nI always had a passion for rodeo, I would go to rodeos with my dad as a really young boy and as soon as I was old enough to swing a rope and sit a horse I entered up anywhere I could. I started out team roping and them moved onto calf roping, saddle bronc and bull riding as well. I ended up going to Nationals in team roping after winning the Alberta Finals, as well as placing in the Canadian Finals. I also made it to the Silver State Rodeo in Nevada for bull riding. After a few years of braking more bones than I can remember, I finally decided that I am not going to make a career out of rodeo like a lot of my family had before me. I still like to rope any chance I get but for the most part my rodeo career is over.\n\nMy reality tv career started in 2012 and has continued with two different reality tv shows. Our first show was called Way Our West and aired on TruTV as Lionsgate’s first reality TV show. After a few years of that show, we moved on to History Channel’s hit TV show Mountain Men and still continues today.\n\nMy family has been running cows and hunting in Idaho sense they moved here in 1864 and after 6 generations not much has changed. I guess people are intrigued by our way of life and our unique adventures. I never thought I would be a TV star but it has been a fun and interesting experience.\n\nI live an amazing life that keeps me outdoors and with my family. I love what I do and wouldn’t trade it for anything. Even though I am just getting started and have a lot of years and experiences yet to live, I am filled with lots of memories and fun exciting stories to tell. If you ever want to hear any of them just ask.\n\nLook forward to having you in my boat.\n\nSADIE KING\n\nOPERATIONS MANAGER / GUIDE\n\nI was born and raised in Idaho and grew up with a passion for the state’s wild places. My education brought me to the Frank Church Wilderness in 2013 where I Read More\n\ngot to live, learn and work at a research station on the Middle Fork’s largest tributary for 3 months. This experience left me with an infatuation with the area and a desire to live and work in the Frank. I started working on the river in 2014 and I love being a guide, I enjoy the physical place so much but I also think the more you know about a place the more you feel connected to it. Because of that, talking about the history, flora and fauna, and geomorphology to the people we take down the river is something I loved to do.\n\nMy husband, Blake who drives the Sweep Boat, and I spent our falls up the tributaries to the Middle Fork working hunting ranches. As much as we love the seasonal lifestyle we decided to build a home and start a family. We had a little girl Halloween of 2022. I had been guiding for Helfrich and transitioned from guide to office manager, then operations manager. Helfrich is a great place to work for many reasons, one being how family oriented they are. Blake is still running the sweep boat and I get to bring our baby girl to work with me. It is very special to get to continue in an industry that I have been a part of for so long! If I don’t see you on the river I am sure you will get a few emails from me!\n\nLearn more about Sadie: https://www.helfrichoutfitter.com/6802-2/\n\nKris Belozer\n\nTRIP LEADER / GUIDE\n\nMany of our clients know and love Kris Belozer; a great guide and amazing boatman that will always keep you smiling with his exceptional sense of humor. Kris has been Read More\n\na valuable part of the Helfrich River Outfitters Family since 2010. Known for more than just a few laughs, his dedication to the “Helfrich Way” and his great attitude are remarkable. Guests love fishing with Kris and guides love working with him. Kris is the type of leader who leads by example and doesn’t quit until the job is done. Kris has been in the business a long time. He started his legacy at age 6, helping his dad Jon, an outfitter on the Deschutes River in Oregon, on trips for Belozer’s Whitewater Fishing. After rowing a gear boat and learning the river, he moved up to a drift boat at age 10. (yes, you read that right, age 10).\n\nBy the time he tagged along with Helfrich River Outfitters on the Middle Fork at age 19, he was already an accomplished boatman, fisherman, and kayaker. Kris has guided on the Deschutes, Middle Fork of the Salmon, Main Salmon, Rogue, and Owyhee Rivers, in addition to exploring rivers by kayak in Oregon, Idaho, Washington, Montana, California, and South America.\n\nThere is certainly more to come for Kris and we are so excited to have him as a key part of our team. Starting this season, Kris will be managing operations for our new set of Middle Fork launches and second crew. With the help and support of our rockstar guides, Kris will be in charge of the day to day activities on and off the water pertaining to his set of trips.\n\nLucky for us, Kris also comes as a package deal with his awesome wife and adorable kids Kolter and Perry Jo. In 2017 we were ecstatic to welcome his new wife Jordan into our HRO family and recently the couple had their first son, Kolter Finn, who has already been stacking his river resume. Like his father, we expect great things from this little fisherman. With a nod to the next generation, we want to congratulate Kris on his many accomplishments. His commitment to providing a great experience, his work ethic and unique, lovable character have set him apart over the years. We’ve watched Kris grow into a truly phenomenal person, father and guide. We are proud to announce his promotion to Middle Fork Manager and look forward to being a continued part of Kris’ river legacy, career and family for years to come.

As a full time guide for HRO, I run trips on the Helfrich Crew Read More\n\nin both Oregon and Idaho for their entire season and I fill in the rest of the year guiding for myself and other hunting outfitters as well. I start out my season running one-day fishing trips on the McKenzie River in Oregon before heading to Idaho for the summer. I work in Idaho on the Middle Fork of the Salmon River as a drift boat fishing guide with the occasional rafting trip mixed in. In August I head back to western Oregon, running my own salmon fishing operation on the Columbia River out of Astoria. These trips are run in my jet sled and offer the same full service type of trips that we provide at HRO. For the fall season, I am a lead guide on Rogue River for the Helfrich Outfitter steelhead fishing operation. For the remainder of the year I run own guide service on Oregon’s coastal rivers, bays, and also bird hunting in the wheat fields of Central Oregon with my two bird dogs, Garrin and Hardy.\n\nI met Kelsey and the Helfrich family while Kelsey and I were going to school at Oregon State University. We had the same major, Recreation Resource Management in the College of Forestry. Both of us will tell you that we couldn’t have made it through college on time, or have had as much fun, without each other. From forestry classes to swing dancing, Kevin and Kelsey are a great team and could make any class or project fun.\n\nAs a guide, I really just enjoy showing people how good of time we can have out there. It doesn’t matter if you are a complete beginner or world travelled angler, I will always work hard to ensure that you not only have a good day of fishing but a fun day on the river as well.\n\nTim Gunderson\n\nTRIP LEADER / GUIDE\n\nI often say that I have the perfect life. I retired in 2020 after 30 years of teaching mathematics and geology to high school and junior Read More\n\ncollege students. I began guiding the same year I began teaching and hope to continue guiding for many more years. Part of my retirement plans include a new pursuit—birding. (Read Tim’s Article about Birding on the Middle Fork: https://www.helfrichoutfitter.com/birding/\n\nI grew up camping, boating, and fishing the lakes of Minnesota. My parents instilled a love of all things outdoors in me and my two brothers. Annual vacations out west only enhanced my love of mountains and rivers and in 1983 I followed that love of the west to my new hometown Read More\n\nof Burley, Idaho. I wasn’t lucky enough to be born in Idaho, but I’m darned sure going to die in Idaho.\n\nI moved to Idaho with a degree in drafting and a few years of experience in construction. After four more years of construction, I returned to school and earned a B.S. in Mathematics Education and later a Masters of Natural Science in Geology from Idaho State University in Pocatello. 1990 was an important year for me. That is the year that I began my teaching career at Burley High School and the year I kicked off my boating career. The two jobs go hand in hand together and I still love watching my students and guests learn and expand their knowledge, in the classroom or on the river.\n\nMy boating career started on the Main Salmon River, tagging along on a trip to help out and learn the routine. By the second day I was hooked, and I haven’t missed a season of guiding on the Main Salmon or Middle Fork since. I worked for Warren River Expeditions for 20 years before starting on the Helfrich River Outfitters crew in 2011. In 1994, while guiding on the Main Salmon I met my best friend, Marilyn on a Salmon River trip and we were married a year later on the river. We enjoy many outdoor adventures together both on and off the river. We raised two kids and have four granddaughters! When I’m not teaching or guiding, I can also be found chasing elk with my muzzleloader, target shooting, hiking, camping, and traveling.\n\nI love working on the Helfrich Crew! I can’t imagine a better river trip than that offered by Helfrich River Outfitters. I feel fortunate to work with such a great group of people. As a geology teacher, I love talking about rocks and river canyons, especially on my favorite river, the Middle Fork of the Salmon!

Read More\n\nWhether navigating a large boat through the rapids, leading a string of mules through a high meadow, or flying to the far reaches of the wilderness in a small plane, I feel at home.\n\nI have come to appreciate the many different aspects of a river trip, I can enjoy cooking a hot meal in a beautiful setting as much as floating down the river. Helping people feel comfortable and have a good experience in a different environment is important to me.\n\nWhen I am not in the backcountry I live in the community of North Fork, Idaho. The woman I love also enjoys a similar lifestyle. We are building a home together on the banks of a free flowing river. I am looking forward to the next river trip!\n\nZOE GRUMBACH\n\nGUIDE\n\nI am originally from San Francisco, raised by two parents who love backpacking, camping, and all things mountains. We took a trip down the Middle Fork as a family in 2019, Read More\n\nand I was instantly hooked by the stunning scenery, remoteness, and peace of the Idaho wilderness. I returned the next summer as a swamper, and then worked in Aspen, Colorado, guiding the Roaring Fork, Arkansas, and Colorado Rivers. In the off-season I attend Colorado College, and when I’m not in school I’m usually skiing or climbing. I love Colorado, but there is nothing that compares to the Middle Fork, and I can’t wait to be back!

Some say I’m lucky and that would be spot on! Fly fishing became an interest of mine when my dad first handed me a rod, I remember playing with the cats in the front yard when I would tie a toy mouse at the end to practice my casting. Rowing came right along with that, going duck hunting, fishing or rafting my parents always gave me the opportunity to “get on the sticks.” My childhood was incredible and I have some very special folks to thank for that.\n\nA little more about myself, I grew up in Springfield, Oregon and was an avid outdoorsman and athlete. I attended Montana State University Billings where I obtained my Criminal Justice degree back in the spring 2018. I was able to play collegiate baseball where I was a pitcher. Since graduation I have been focusing more of my free time looking for shed antlers, playing golf, or hunting. I’m still jumping from state to state so haven’t found the right place to call “home,” yet\n\nI started “swamping” for my grandfather, Dean, when I was 10 years old. I swamped for a handful of trips every year until I turned 16 and was able to be an employee for my mom’s rafting company so I did that for a year. At 17 I was able to get my Idaho guides license and haven’t missed a season since. In 2019 my grandfather sold our side of the family business to Ken and Kelsey and they gave me the opportunity to come join the fun. Since then I have worked the Middle Fork and the Rogue for HRO and have loved every second of it. The guides I get to work with, the clients, and the experience we get to share is phenomenal.\n\nMy friends and I look forward to sharing a river experience with you and your group or family! See you on the river!\n\nCole Henson\n\nGUIDE\n\nI was born and raised in Macon, GA, started my river guiding career on the Nolichucky River as a whitewater guide in 2007, and have been guiding all over the West ever Read More\n\nsince. Once I moved out west and began to experience the mulit-day aspect of floating, I fell in love with the River all over again. There is no better feeling than being in the bottom a river canyon, flowing at the pace of the water for days on end. The River is home for me, and it would be my pleasure to share that space with you. Let’s go boatin’!!\n\nLogan Warren\n\nGUIDE\n\nI grew up in a river outfitting family in Salmon, ID, spending most of my summers floating the local rivers with my parents Dave and Thyra Warren along with my little sister Read More\n\nTeagan. My parents owned a whitewater rafting company called Warren River Expeditions with two permits on the Middle Fork and Main Salmon rivers. As an outfitters kid, you get put to work, helping out around the shop and on the river at a very young age. Lucky for me it also gave me the opportunity to grow up on the water and tagging along on lots of river trips. In the spring of 2020, I graduated from the University of Idaho with a degree in Wildlife Resources. During my years at the university, I was also able to play for the University of Idaho’s hockey team. When I’m not on the river, in class, or on the hockey rink, I like to spend my time skiing and kayaking as much as I can. I did my first trip with the Helfrich crew when I was 15 years old and haven’t missed a season since.\n\nCatie Stukel\n\nGUIDE\n\nI grew up in Idaho fly fishing, camping, and boating with my family. Two summers ago I swamped my first Middle Fork trip, and immediately knew that I wanted to Read More\n\nbe a guide one day. Last summer I started rowing a gear boat, and by the end of the season I got my guide license and was rowing guests. I am so excited for another season of rowing on the Middle Fork, and can’t wait for the long days full of sunshine, swimming, and great company. When I am not on the river I am a student at Dartmouth College and ski patroller at Winter Park Resort.

There’s just nothing better than spending days floating down a river Read More\n\nwith canyon walls hovering above and nights sleeping in the fresh air under the stars. Experiences like this filled my childhood because my parents wanted to spread their love for the outdoors to my brother and I.\n\nGrowing up in Utah, I spent my winters ski racing and summers mountain biking, hiking, camping, and rafting. I remember asking my ski coach, “What do you do for work during the summers?” He told me he was a river guide, and that intrigued me. I started college at Montana State University where I majored in Exercise Science and Psychology and also started river guiding in the summers. I spent the next four summers guiding on the Yampa Canyon and the Gates of Lodore on the Green River. I fell in love with seeing families, especially kids, feel the freedom the outdoors brings out in people.\n\nI’m also known as Safety Officer Mel on the river. I wanted to make the move to Idaho and guide longer trips, so I got a job on the Middle Fork. Spending summers in the Frank Church Wilderness is the best, and I look forward to exploring more of Oregon in the Fall! I spend my winters ski patrolling in Montana. When I’m not in the mountains or on the rivers, you can find me traveling in my camper or flying to other countries. See you on the river!\n\nAndrew Greiner\n\nGUIDE\n\nMy name is Andrew Greiner. I was born and raised in Oregon and went to school at the University of Montana. After college I moved into my career of guiding and Read More\n\nnow call Salmon, Idaho my home. I originally started working in the backcountry of the Frank Church Wilderness, packing and guiding hunts for several years before I started boating commercially. It only took one trip down the Middle Fork and I was hooked and have been running full seasons ever since. Whether I’m boating through whitewater in the Spring, swimming and fishing in the Summer, or guiding hunters in the Fall, being out in the beautiful Middle Fork country is about as good as it gets! I consider myself very lucky to be able live and enjoy this area and I can’t wait to share it with you.\n\nERIC RICHINS\n\nGUIDE\n\nI’m lucky to say I’ve loved and respected Idaho’s great outdoors my whole life and there’s nothing I enjoy more than seeing people smile out there. I was introduced Read More\n\nto boating on our wonderful rivers and lakes early on by my parents and decided I wanted to be a guide on my very first river trip down the mighty Salmon. During my first summer off college, I started guiding rivers in Idaho, Montana, and Washington and ran rivers as far as Costa Rica and Chile. Some summers I led expeditions as a WIlderness River Ranger in the Frank Church and Bob Marshall Wilderness areas for the Forest Service. After earning both Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in freshwater biology I taught biology, ecology, resource management, and biostatistics for the University of Montana and Salish Kootenai College. Now when I’m not on the Middle Fork Salmon I spend time with my beautiful wife and our three labradors, we own and operate a charter fishing boat on Lake Mead and Lake Mohave. You’ll find me in my element out there on the river and I look forward to making sure its a trip of a lifetime\n\nLANIE GALLAND\n\nGUIDE\n\nHowdy! I was born and raised in north Georgia where my family encouraged (and joined) barefoot exploration of the outdoors, complete with as much dirt, water, and Read More\n\nbelly-laughing as possible. My dad taught me to fly fish fresh and saltwater at a very early age, and everything sprouted from there. After college, I moved to the west coast, spending several years at the ocean for school before moving to the mountains of Truckee, where I extensively studied the genetics of fisheries and forests. After losing several years of fishing (wading) to an injury, I was ecstatic to get back on the water, guiding in Oregon, Montana, and Mongolia before joining the awesome Helfrich crew.

From 2011 onward I’d always wanted to be a sweep boat captain. The outdoors are a place I cherish whether it’s guiding river trips, skateboarding, snowboarding, skiing, kayaking, hunting or paddling big water with friends. I’m a seasonal full-time instructor for Sun Valley during the winter. Luckily, the Frank Church Wilderness is where I’ve called home my entire life for the warm season and I’m proud to continue running Middle Fork trips with Helfrich. I like providing an outstanding experience through extensive customer service and putting guests’ needs first. Also enjoy playing music and will play around the campfire.

From a young age I’ve had a profound calling to fishing and the excitement that comes from catching fish, as well as the solidarity and beauty of where many of these fish live. Through fishing I have also found a passion for running rivers in all forms of water craft whether it be drift boats, rafts or jetboats.\n\nI am lucky to get the opportunity to live a life where I can have a career as a guide. Working with Helfrich is a pleasure and I look forward to meeting all the wonderful people that will be coming down the river with us.\n\nCharlie Steele\n\nGUIDE\n\nHi, my name is Charlie. Just like many of the others, I fell in love with the river at a young age. The first time I rafted The Salmon River was at the age of 4. From then on Read More\n\nI wanted rivers to be a part of my lifestyle. 2022 was the year I first started guiding at the age of 20. It’s hard to express my gratitude and love for The Salmon River’s clean water and healthy environments. I tell myself guiding isn’t a job; it’s a privilege. When not on the water, I love to bike, ski, fish, and basically do anything outside. I am also a commercial pilot and flight instructor. Hope to see ya on the rio!

Bend was the perfect place to find easy access to a plethora of famous trout Read More\n\nfishing and white water streams. By age 18, he was working in a fly shop, and guiding on the Lower Deschutes. While he’ll say he moved to NE Oregon for college, the truth is he moved to the wilder part of Oregon to elude the crowds and find endless outdoors pursuits. With 5 months of steelhead fishing, and remote trout streams with trophy sized fish, there were many professors asking where he was. He often finds his way home each spring to make an appearance during the Deschutes River Salmon Fly hatch, before heading to the the Grande Ronde, Middle Fork Salmon, and back to the Grande Ronde. When not on the water, Austin is generally tying flies, backpacking, or out bird hunting for chukars. The whitewater, the people, the reward of catching big fish in wild and beautiful places all keep him coming back each spring as the rivers begin to run.\n\nDALLY RATCLIFF\n\nGUIDE\n\nI grew up in Cottonwood Idaho.

I have a four legged fishing companion named Ivory that enjoys fishing, her favorite species of fish are the ones on the end of my string.\n\nI have been fortunate to work on amazing fisheries which include, the Yellowstone river, the Goodnews River in Alaska, as well as Hells Canyon here in idaho where I operated 30’ jet boats and chased 9 foot sturgeon. Fly fishing is my passion, that has inundated my life for the last twelve years. Fishins Good, fishins great.\n\nCONOR DAVIS\n\nGUIDE\n\nConor was born and raised in the Wood River Valley. He grew up ski racing in both Alpine and Nordic disciplines. After High school he got into backcountry skiing and competed Read More\n\nprofessionally on the Freeskiing World tour for seven years. He then became a Program Director for the Sun Valley Ski Education Foundation and pioneered their “Big Mountain and Backcountry” program. In the Offseason, Conor spends most of his time at his cabin in Stanley, Idaho with his huskies, Misha and Avalanche. He loves the access to the outdoors from his backyard and does it all: SCUBA diving, mountaineering, climbing, hiking, biking, paragliding/speedflying, surfing, boating, skiing, snowmobiling, fishing, slacklining, one-wheeling, cooking, gardening, and birdwatching are some of his favorite ways to spend time.\n\nHogan Hernandez\n\nGUIDE\n\nBorn and raised in small-town Sisters, I found my passion for the outdoors in the mountains and on the rivers of Central Oregon. I was first introduced to river trips and guiding Read More\n\nthrough my high school’s outdoor program and was blown away that people get paid to do something like floating through river canyons and cooking incredible meals in the outdoors.\n\nOnce in college, I made it my mission to get on the river as much as possible – the best solution was working hard towards becoming a guide. I graduated from the University of Oregon with a degree in Journalism/Public Relations and Mandarin Chinese and guided out of Bend, Oregon before heading back to school each fall.\n\nI’ve been lucky enough to spend the past six years learning, rowing, and falling in love with rivers all over Oregon and parts of Idaho. After a couple of years, summers just weren’t enough… I extended my seasons by picking up work in early April guiding geology trips on the elusive yet stunning Owyhee River. In addition, I’ve spent the past few falls running a gear boat for a fly fishing company down the Grande Ronde River in Eastern Oregon; which is where I learned the joy of successful trout and steelhead fishing. After my first trip down the Middle Fork of the Salmon with friends in 2019, I just knew I had to find my way back to such a rugged, challenging, beautiful, and inspiring place. It’s the kind of river that lives in your dreams!\n\nI am looking forward to sharing more incredible river experiences with all Helfrich guests! Off the river I enjoy cooking big meals for all my friends, hanging with my dog, fishing, painting, traveling to warm places in the off-season, skiing, and working at my local mountain in the Elkhorns, and of course challenging my boating skills on new rivers.\n\nAARON LIEBERMAN\n\nGUIDE\n\nI hail from rural Southwest Oregon, where the Rogue and Applegate Rivers meet, and grew up rafting and kayaking the Rogue, Deschutes, Klamath, and many other rivers Read More\n\nof southwest Oregon and Northern California. Not surprisingly, my passions always have always been rooted in the outdoors and rivers, the places they take you and things they give you.\n\nI started guiding roughly 15 years ago now, and still think of myself as a guide, though I spend the vast majority of my time these days working as the Executive Director of the Idaho Outfitters & Guides Association (IOGA)—a statewide nonprofit representing and advocating for licensed outfitters and guides, and committed to the conservation and enhancement of quality outdoor recreation experiences on Idaho’s lands and waters (and Salmon!).\n\nIn between where I started and where I am, my love of rivers and exploration has taken me across continents and through cultures. I spent a year studying in Germany, another in England, and half a year in Tunisia, and have dual degrees in Political Science and German, with a minor in Arabic (though I’ve yet to find a functional application for the latter two in outfitting, guiding or running IOGA).\n\nBut I’ve never found a place I love more than Idaho, nor people I love more than my fellow guides and outfitters who also gave their hearts to it.

I was born and raised in Oregon and I have lived in Eugene all but 6 months of my life. I bought my first Read More\n\ndrift boat when I was a senior in high school and soon after began guiding. After high school I attended the University of Oregon and lettered 3 years in track while I was there. Running alongside Steve Prefontaine through college, I got 3rd place in PAC steeplechase with best showing. After college I became a health and physical education teacher and continued teaching for 31 years, coaching numerous sports. Being a teacher went hand in hand with guiding and gave me summers off to work on the river. Even with school and teaching, I started guiding at the age of 20, floating the Rogue for the first time that year and then started guiding on the Middle Fork of the Salmon at the age of 27 alongside Kenny, working for his dad, Dave. I have a wonderful wife, Diane and son Matt. I really like being a sports fan, tying flies, skiing and hunting but fishing is my favorite hobby.\n\nJohn Morton\n\nGUIDE\n\nI grew up fly fishing and boating the high desert rivers of Central Oregon. From my hometown of Sisters, I spent my early years honing my skills on the Metolius, Read More\n\nDeschutes, Crooked, and McKenzie rivers with dreams of guiding for a living. That dream finally came to fruition when I began guiding in 2012. I have taken many different paths in life, from ranching to becoming a metal fabricator, to getting my pilot’s license, and have always returned to working on the river as my primary passion and drive. My favorite part of being a river guide is getting to bring people into the wilderness and cultivate a bond between the crew and our guests. We get to know each other’s stories on a deeper level as well as create lasting friendships and river stories of our own. When I am finished guiding with the Helfrich Crew in the fall, I try to find carpentry and metal work jobs through the winter as well as ski and ride my snowmobile as much as possible. I am incredibly grateful to be the newest member of the Helfrich crew and can’t wait to share my experience with you.\n\nTaylor Wilcox\n\nGUIDE\n\nTaylor is a second generation river guide, who grew up next to the Potomac River in Maryland.

I spend every fall exploring 3rd world countries on the back of a motorcycle, then winters in Alta, UT care takeing a cabin and skiing every day, before kite surfing each spring in the Dominican Republic, and making my way to the Middle Fork each summer.” Taylors years of experience on the Middle Fork and his great sense of fun and adventure are a welcome additon to the Helfrich Crew.\n\nEmerald Lafortune\n\nGUIDE\n\nI grew up in Northern Idaho with two parents who loved taking us on the river and getting us outside. I graduated from the University of Montana before Idaho called me Read More\n\nhome. I currently live in Salmon, Idaho where I enjoy fishing, skiing, hiking, and small-town life. Most of the year I am in the non-profit sector working to help connect youth across the US with winter sports as part of the Share Winter Foundation, but every summer I return for a few trips of my favorite work — river and fly fish guiding. I’ve been a guide in Idaho for a decade now on rivers from the Middle Fork to the Owyhee to Hells Canyon of the Snake, and have my fingers crossed for a few decades more.\n\nEARL WAGNER\n\nGUIDE\n\nHello there, I’m Earl. I was born and raised in Wisconsin. Growing up I enjoyed the popular pastime of cheese. I found my true love when my father would take me on hunting Read More\n\ntrips to the western states. I decided to become a hunting guide in the Frank Church Wilderness, gaining a passion for the Middle Fork of the Salmon River drainage along the way. One day while riding stock along the river trail I came upon some pretty girls fly fishing along the bank. I started thinking that playing in the waves in the hot summer sun sounded better than swatting flies off a horse’s behind. Now I have the best of both worlds. I still chase big game through the mountains in the fall and winter but now I spend my summers floating and fishing, all in the greatest place on earth! But I do miss the cheese.\n\nMike Boyd\n\nGUIDE\n\nI knew I wanted to be a guide at an early age. I was fortunate to get a start when Rough Country Outfitters in Wyoming took a chance on a very eager, very green Read More\n\nPennsylvania kid. So off I went in 1990, packing horses and guiding fishing and big game hunts in the wilds of Wyoming.\n\nAfter 7 seasons in Wyoming the lore of steelhead got the best of me and off to the Pacific Northwest I went. We had steelhead in the Great Lakes, which where almost the demise of my college career as I spent more time in waders with a fly rod than in class. But, I always wanted to catch the real deal. Oregon it was. I started guiding the Deschutes in ’98. Ultimately owning and operating my own outfitting business on the Deschutes for 8 seasons. Along the way I had the opportunity to guide a bunch of the premiere Oregon fisheries for trout and steelhead. In the falls I would guide waterfowl hunts as well. Winters found me working in the ski industry.\n\nI still guide the Deschutes, it is home, and a token appearance during the salmon fly hatch is fun. But the stories about the boating and fishing from guide buddies that would go to Idaho and work for the Helfriches on the Middle Fork got the best of me. I contacted Ken and I got my shot to work for this amazing crew. Idaho and the Middle Fork will get in your blood and keep calling you back.\n\nNow it’s Idaho for the summer, Rogue for the fall, and ski patrolling at Mt Bachelor for the winter. Not a bad schedule, amazing rivers and boating to skiing pow.\n\nGeorge Butts\n\nGUIDE / SWEEP DRIVER\n\nI was born and raised in Challis Idaho and was fortunate to grow up in a family that enjoys the outdoors. My parents started taking all of us rugrats floating on rivers at an early Read More\n\nage. We all loved being on the water. When my oldest brother got old enough, he got a summer job on Idaho’s Middle Fork of the Salmon River. He first took me along on a trip in the summer of 1998 and I enjoyed it so much I had to keep coming back. With a little luck, I eventually graduated high school and enrolled at Boise State University where I got my degree in economics. I later got a job on the Helfrich Crew, working with Ken, Kelsey, and Kidd, running multiple rivers throughout the west and driving the sweep boat on the Middle Fork.\n\nJohn Payne\n\nGUIDE\n\nHey, I’m Jon Payne, or better known as ‘JP’. I grew up in Olympia, Washington, and currently reside in Eugene, Oregon. I learned to fish as soon as I was able to hold a pole. Read More\n\nTying the fishing line to a favorite stick was my first rod. Growing up in Puget Sound allowed me to fish whenever I wanted. Prowling streams on the Olympic Peninsula was a favorite activity growing up, as was learning to row a drift boat. As I got older, the Drift boat became a tool to get down the river and to fish out of. After moving to Eugene in 1997 the drift boat became a toy to play on the McKenzie River. After 17 years in the Bar/Tavern business and fishing for fun in all my spare time; I finally was able to become a guide and dedicate myself to my passion in 1999.\n\nI began working for Helfrich River Outfitters in 2006 and I now guide the Middle Fork and Main Salmon, Rogue, and McKenzie Rivers for HRO. My first Middle Fork trip was in 2002 and I’m excited for many more seasons to come! I also guide on John Day, Alsea, Siuslaw, Umpqua, Elk, Sixes, Willamette, and Santiam Rivers. In my downtime, I continue to pursue my ardor for fishing and drift boats. I have named all my drift boats “Miss Kay” in honor of my grandmother, who let me row a boat as soon as I was able. I spent hours and hours rowing my Grandma Kay around Puget Sound.\n\nJim Juza\n\nGUIDE\n\nThe first time I made money in my drift boat I was 13 years old. That was August of 1965. I don’t remember what I was paid, but day wages for guides was in the $35-45 Read More\n\nrange at the time. I think I got about half of that. I got my first Oregon guides license on my 18th birthday Sept. 16, 1969. A fellow from ODFW came to our house and gave me an oral exam. The only thing I remember about that test was trying to name the fins on a fish. Knowing how to row a boat did not seem to be important. I first worked for Dave Helfrich in the boys camps in 1967. I worked for Dick on his river camp in 1968 and did the Rogue, running the camp boat for Dick in August of that year. I ran a drift boat on the Owyhee in May of 1969 with Prince, Dave and Leroy Pruitt. That was the first trip that Dave ran his pontoon. Prince baked his first loaf of dutch oven bread on the river that trip. He had done a practice loaf at home so knew it could be done. I guided the McKenzie until 1993 and the Rogue from 1979 to 1994. I started guiding the MF in 1980 and am still guiding there today. I have guided the Owyhee, John Day, Main Salmon and a few other great rivers as well. Out of all of them, the Middle Fork of the Salmon is my favorite. I believe there is no other river that offers as much. We have the scenery, wildlife, fishing, Indian cultural sites and occidental sites. The Middle Fork is also in the middle of the largest Wilderness in the Lower 48. I see something new every time I float the MF. My other occupations over the years include driving semi-trucks and building logging roads. I raise cattle on our ranch in Salmon and worked for the Idaho Dept. of Fish and Game capturing and collaring deer and elk. I have captured a couple thousand deer and a couple hundred elk, a few bighorn sheep and some antelope. I kept track of about 325 collared animals each winter. I grew up on the McKenzie River. I moved to Salmon in 1983 and married Lois Blackadar March 22, 1986. We have 2 sons and a daughter and 5 grandchildren. I feel fortunate to be a fishing guide. We get to be with people when they are at their best. On vacation! I believe that we provide the best vacation experience possible.

I went off to Montana for college and began Read More\n\nmy guiding career in West Yellowstone where I worked for two seasons. Guiding in Montana grew my appreciation for the rivers and fishing that I had left in Oregon. The uncrowded rivers of Oregon and the diversity of the fishing soon brought me back to the Eugene area. I began guiding with the expectation of being able to fish every day, but I quickly learned that the customers and the relationships developed is what guiding is really about. I now guide full time, based out of the Eugene area and work on the McKenzie, Rogue and Middle Fork of the Salmon with Helfrich River Outfitters. I also run my own Oregon guiding operation as well on rivers including the McKenzie and the Umpqua. In my free time, I enjoy bird hunting with my two German Wirehaired Pointers, Frank and Murphy.\n\nSaydee Brass\n\nADVERTISING INTERN\n\nMy name is Saydee.

My folks introduced me to river living at a young age on family trips, and it’s been a deciding factor in many of my life choices since.\n\nMy relatively short guiding career has taken me from the Rogue River in Oregon to the beautiful branches of the Salmon River in Idaho, which I now call home in the summertime. Guiding is a job, but spending my summer months in The Frank Church Wilderness makes it feel like a privilege. In the off-season, I live in Bellingham Washington pursuing a degree in Natural Resources and GIS through Oregon State, and spend what funds I have left traveling to kayak on new rivers around the world. When not on the river I love to ski, fish, and ride mountain bikes out my back door in the North Cascades and beyond. Hope to see you out there!\n\nMelissa Nolan\n\nGUIDE\n\nI was born and raised in Buffalo, Minnesota. I spent my days haunting every lake, pond, and creek I could find. I learned from an early age the kind of peaceful sanctuary Read More\n\nthat nature holds and sought it out at every turn. You could find me running through the woods or holed up in a tree and always racing my toothpick boats down the gutter in a thunderstorm.\n\nI moved to Riggins, Idaho in 2020 to become a raft guide on a whim after hearing about it from my uncle and immediately fell in love. I started out as a day trip guide then began running multi-day trips on the lower gorge of the Salmon and the Snake River in Hells Canyon. I had planned for only a season but am continually drawn back and each season I fall deeper in love with the Salmon River and the wild beauty that surrounds it. The lessons from the river and its people are plentiful and there is not a day I don’t walk away with a new lesson to remember and a new memory to tuck away.\n\nBob Morton\n\nGUIDE\n\nBob is our trusty bus driver that transports guests from the take out at the confluence of the Middle Fork and the Main Salmon, back to Salmon at the end of the trip.

Blaine-o is out on the Middle Fork!\n\nI began life in the big-suburbs, got my degree, and wore a tie for a while… Read More\n\nBut, horsemanship, white and clear water boating, hot springs, big game hunting, and seasonal-outdoor pursuits called me to Idaho.

Hope you find your peace, pleasure, and psychiatry on the river y’all!\n\nTrafford Turkiewicz\n\nGUIDE\n\nGrowing up in Portland, Oregon, I was never far from the outdoors. Whether I was fishing the Sandy River for Steelhead or snowboarding on Mt. Hood, I couldn’t wait to get into some kind of adventure. Read More\n\nIn 2019 I moved to Bozeman, Montana to get a degree in Environmental Engineering at Montana State University.

Some highlights of college have also included playing in the local music scene with my band and studying abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina in the Spring of 2023.\n\nMy passion for fishing led me to guide on the headwaters of the Salmon River in 2020, where I have spent the past four summers. Although my job is to teach and guide clients into fish, the knowledge and life skills that clients have shared in return are invaluable to me, and I am looking forward to what the Middle Fork has in store!\n\nCasey Burley\n\nGUIDE\n\nAs a native of Salmon, I grew up exploring the mountains and rivers with my father and twin brother.

This experience further deepened my commitment to preserving the natural beauty of our region.\n\nToday, I am dedicated to sharing my love for the outdoors and my knowledge of the environment with others, ensuring that future generations can also enjoy the pristine wilderness of Salmon."
