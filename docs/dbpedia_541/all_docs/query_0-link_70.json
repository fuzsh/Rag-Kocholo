        "text": "From Shalin:\n\n“Our hiking group visit on 5/31/2018 went exceptionally well.\n\nAngelia gave the group an excellent green building tour and introduced the Healing Cage to the group.\n\nThere were eighteen people instead of the twelve we had expected. They all went on the hike except one gentleman who had undergone surgery two weeks before. He still wanted to come to Summer Star so he stayed inside the Trailhead House and checked out our library and the gallery.\n\nI actually went out on the trail along with the whole group. We walked the short trail first, and then we walked the easy trail. It was a comfortable day with a light spring breeze. John and Mary were so wonderful to be with. They had such positive energy, and we all had great fun together. The group kept thanking me and Rick for opening up the place for them. We saw a pileated woodpecker in the woods on a huge old tree trunk not too far from where we stood. We saw two pink lady slipper flowers – very pretty!”\n\nBelow are some quotes and pictures from the event:\n\nThe hiking group had such an AWESOME experience at Summer Star yesterday. The foundational philosophy of your vision and your staff’s enthusiasm are encouraging (to say the least) for all of us and hope you continue on your journey.\n\nPlease thank Rick and Angelia for all that they contributed to our outstanding experience.\n\nKeep on “Rocking” your vision, Shalin. You are an inspiration to us all.\n\nAll the best,\n\nRock ON!\n\nJohn & Mary…..and the entire Sutton Senior Center hiking group.\n\n– John Helfrich\n\nDear Shalin,\n\nThank you very much for the wonderful time our group spent at the Sanctuary on Thursday, May 31st.\n\nYour peacefulness and vision is impressive. I came away feeling very thankful for the experience.\n\nIt is amazing gift that you share.\n\nLooking forward to a snowshoe adventure at the Sanctuary come winter.\n\nHeartfelt thanks\n\n-Adrienne Gordon"
