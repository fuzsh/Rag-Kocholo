        "text": "By:\n\nTuesday, August 6, 2024 | 6:01 AM\n\nYear 2 appears to have greeted Nick Keefer with more structure and the feeling of a greater sense of eagerness among his lot of 80-plus football players.\n\n“We have great kids here, and they are always ready to go to work,” said Keefer, the coach at Hempfield. “We were together four days a week since Jan. 4. We had our mini-camp and increased our 7-on-7 (tournaments). We had over 70 kids at every workout.”\n\nLarge participation numbers are important at large programs such as Hempfield’s, especially when you’re back to being part of the largest classification again.\n\nHempfield was bumped up to Class 6A after two years in 5A, meaning longer road trips and less room for errors in the team’s quest to win again.\n\nKeefer is trying to unleash a tougher mindset among his group.\n\n“I grew up in Belle Vernon, and we’d go to DQ Park and play pick-up (basketball),” Keefer said. “I don’t think kids even play pick-up anymore. It’s about man vs. man and winning your matchup. That’s what we’re trying to teach here.\n\n“Legendary (softball) coach Bob Kalp always used to say, win the day. I’m not worried about who we play in Week 5 or Week 8. I am concerned with getting better each day. Plus, it’s not like our schedule was any easier last year.”\n\nThe Spartans finished 1-9, with their lone win coming in Week Zero, 45-6 over Greensburg Salem. They were 0-5 and finished last in the Big East Conference.\n\nHempfield opens at North Hills, then hosts Franklin Regional in Week 1 before the 6A conference presents games against North Allegheny, Central Catholic, Canon-McMillan, Norwin, Seneca Valley and Mt, Lebanon.\n\nGateway is the Week 9 matchup.\n\n“We have to be ready to play, no doubt,” Keefer said. “Everyone is going to be good. If we’re not ready and don’t take it seriously, it’s going to show.”\n\nDom Detruf returns to play quarterback, a more experienced junior who guides the offense as a drop-back passer who threw for 1,006 yards after taking over as the starter.\n\nDetruf has been dealing with myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart likely caused by a mid-summer viral infection. More medical tests were planned to determine if he could return to football.\n\n“Dom is so mature, he’s like a 30-year-old,” Keefer said. “He’s like another coach out there. He started half the season and earned the job. He did some 7-on-7 this year so he’s had more reps.”\n\nDetruf is one of 20 returning letterwinners.\n\n“We have more experience with a lot of guys,” Keefer said. “We’re not just going into the fire. I think they are more ready.”\n\nDetruf is looking to develop chemistry with more receivers.\n\nOne of his main downfield targets graduated in Keiran Lippman, but leading receiver and senior Mitchell Bitar returns after catching 26 passes for 295 yards.\n\nJunior Jack Kopas also shows promise as a receiver.\n\nJunior Brayden Gerst and senior Rogan Katchur are running backs, with senior Reddik Katchur another pass-catching target, along with senior Owen Buchholz, who is back from a thumb injury, and junior Nick Marquis.\n\nThe Katchurs are twin brothers.\n\n“We might have five or six kids with 12 more catches,” Keefer said. “We’re going to rotate a lot of kids (on offense). There are a lot of 1 and 1-As at receiver.”\n\nThe top returning rusher is Rogan Katchur, who gained 238 yards.\n\nA new addition who also could have an impact, particularly on defense as a nickel linebacker, is senior Aidan Allison, a speedy transfer from Greensburg Central Catholic.\n\nAllison, who has an offer from Division II Millersville, also could end up playing running back or slot receiver.\n\n“He can play anywhere,” Keefer said.\n\nJunior Brock Heisler (6-3, 240) will join junior Jake Hornyak, sophomore Jack Wiederstein (6-0, 300) and junior Declan Pillatzki on the offensive line.\n\nHornyak, Keefer said, has been a vocal leader in the offseason.\n\nSenior Jack Humes will be the tight end, while senior Ethan Zontek returns from a knee injury and will look to help the offense.\n\nHeisler, who has an offer from Penn, and Humes make a formidable bookend pair at defensive end.\n\nHempfield will switch from a 3-4 defense to a 4-2-5, with Gerst and junior Jake Morgan at linebacker.\n\nKeefer wants to build a defense that can slow down the run. The less big chunks of yardage allowed, the better.\n\nHis brother, Zach Keefer, is the defensive coordinator.\n\n“I am such an offensive guy,” Nick Keefer said. “But we have to be able to stop people, too.”\n\nMarquis, Buckholtz, junior Henry Mutschler, Reddick Katchur and Allison should hold down the secondary unit.\n\n“I think we have some attitude on defense,” Keefer said.\n\nAnother player to watch is sophomore Terrance Vaughns Jr. (WR/DB), the son of former Uniontown basketball standout Terrence Vaughns.\n\nHempfield\n\nCoach: Nick Keefer\n\n2023 record: 1-9, 0-5 in Class 5A Big East Conference\n\nAll-time record: 304-342-13\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nDate, Opponent, Time\n\n8.23 at North Hills, 7\n\n8.30 Franklin Regional, 7\n\n9.6 at Kiski Area, 7\n\n9.13 North Allegheny*, 7\n\n9.20 Central Catholic*, 7\n\n9.27 at Canon-McMillan*, 7\n\n10.4 Norwin*, 7\n\n10.11 at Seneca Valley*, 7\n\n10.18 Mt.
