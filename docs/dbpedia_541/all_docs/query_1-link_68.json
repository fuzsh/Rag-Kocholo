In the evenings, often we would walk to a secluded and magical place. Following a path that led us through the woods and up Asticou Hill, we entered Thuya Garden.",

        "text": "The American writer Annie Proulx understood this simultaneity, this past/present awareness, when she wrote in her novel Postcards that “the laborers’ vision and strength persists after the labor is done.”^1 Sustaining a property like Thuya asks for a paradoxical approach. Preserving both the intangible and tangible efforts of those whose previous contributions created this place is essential. Thuya’s contemporary caretakers ensure the past remains, often using modern practices to solve problems that arise. Change ensures the original inheres.\n\nThe following quote from architect Peter Zumthor, whose own works are frequently described as timeless, gives us a glimpse into the desire to create spaces that sustain us.\n\nEvery time I imagine a garden in an architectural setting, it turns into a magical place. I think of gardens I have seen, that I believe I have seen, that I long to see, surrounded by simple walls, columns, arcades or the facades of buildings – sheltered places of great intimacy where I want to stay for a long time.^2 —Peter Zumthor\n\nHow does Gus’s story take us to this secret garden tucked into a hillside on Mount Desert Island? As one of the laborers who constructed Thuya’s simple walls, Gus and other workers made landscape designer Charles Savage’s sketches for a fence surrounding the garden a reality.^3 The fence would be both artistic and practical—hungry deer must be kept out and visitors invited in. Two large entrance gates carved from local cedar would welcome visitors. Designed by Savage, they were carved and constructed by Gus.\n\nHaving completed studies in landscape design and civil engineering, as well as service in the Civil War, Joseph Curtis planned the first house he’d build on his new property. A man of comparatively modest means and unpretentious tastes, Curtis differed from some of his wealthy contemporaries who were building enormous summer cottages on the island, many of them in Eden (now Bar Harbor). Asticou, on the other hand, was attracting artists and intellectuals seeking a less ostentatious lifestyle.\n\nCurtis, in his early forties and not yet married, decided a log cabin would suit his needs. He asked Captain Augustus Savage, a local resident from whom he had rented rooms in Asticou, to build it. The cabin, completed in 1881, was the first of four dwellings Curtis owned on the property. Curtis and Savage became friends. This association between residents, one year-round and the other seasonal, would result many years later in Curtis’s friendship with Captain Savage's grandson Charles.\n\nThuya Lodge 2021, photos by John Meader.\n\nBy the early 1900s, Curtis’s intimate knowledge of the hillside had prompted him to apply his design and engineering skills there. Married now, with a wife and son, he sited Thuya Lodge to capture both stunning water views and cooling summer breezes. He planted a small orchard and discovered a spring that provided water for the house. He designed and oversaw construction of the Asticou Terraces—a path with a series of granite steps that wound down the hillside to the road (Peabody Drive) and ultimately led to Asticou Landing on the harbor. Today, visitors often park just off Peabody Drive and walk the quarter mile path up the hillside, frequently stopping to admire the views and rest in the rustic lookouts that Curtis nestled into the landscape.^5\n\nAdvertising brochure for the Asticou Inn and Cottages, circa 1880’s, courtesy of Northeast Harbor Library.\n\nGus would have been in his late teens then, home for the summers but returning to Hebron Academy for the school year. Was he at the dinners that his older sister Emily describes in her diary? She doesn’t mention which of her brothers and sisters were present, but remembers the Curtises visiting the Phillips house (aka Phillips Cottage): “Sometimes in the fall Mr. Curtis and his son Henry used to come up to our house for their suppers. They liked my mother’s cooking and said so. I was around and helped what I could.”^6 Fresh venison, fish hash, and clam chowder, along with her homemade baked goods, were some of Cora’s favored dishes.\n\nCurtis’s collection of walking sticks, preserved at Thuya Lodge, conjures up the vision of a trim, bespeckled man and his son navigating the path up Asticou Hill after a home cooked meal, perhaps fish hash or a good chowder, and holding small lanterns to light their way. Curtis’s son Henry predeceased him in 1918.\n\nFrom those first years on Mount Desert Island (MDI) until his health declined in the mid-1920s, Curtis enthusiastically embraced his time spent on MDI. An energetic and talented man, he worked on clients’ design projects, wrote articles and books, and furthered his vision for his hillside retreat. Curtis died on May 27, 1928, leaving the management of the estate in the hands of Charles Savage.\n\nSeveral years before he died, Curtis had asked Charles to be the sole trustee of the Asticou Terraces Trust after his death. Ownership of his estate would go to the town of Mount Desert and Charles would manage the trust, preserving the property, trails, and Curtis's final home, the arts-and-crafts-style cottage named Thuya Lodge. Per Curtis’s wishes, Charles would open them all for visitors to enjoy in 1931.^7\n\nCharles Savage was twenty-five years old when he began to carry out Curtis’s wishes. During the three years between Curtis’s death and the opening of the Lodge, the rustic simplicity and arts-and-crafts-style interior of the Lodge were carefully preserved. With establishing a library in the upstairs rooms in mind Savage began collecting rare books on botany and landscape design.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 40s, visitors to Thuya Lodge walked up the Asticou Terraces, often pausing, as Curtis intended, to rest in one of the rustic shelters and take in the harbor view. Arriving at the Lodge, they were greeted by a hostess who welcomed them in for conversation and tea. Sometimes the hostess, like Gus’s future daughter-in-law (the author’s mother), worked at the Asticou Inn in the mornings and at the Lodge in the afternoons. Before guests left, the hostess would invite them to sign the guest book.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Savage hired local workers to convert the upstairs bedrooms into a botanical library. He envisioned a comfortable space for visitors who wished to read and research. With help from friends and summer residents, Savage had collected both rare and contemporary books on botany, horticulture, and landscape design. By 1954 the new library was open and visitors were welcomed upstairs for the first time.\n\nAfter more than ninety years, today’s docents carry on many of these traditions. Visitors are invited to explore the house and library, and to examine the simple, yet comfortable, furnishings and construction details, such as the several fireplaces that would have kept Curtis and Henry comfortable on chilly evenings. “Do you let people stay overnight here?” is a common question the docents are asked. “No, unfortunately not.” It wasn’t until the late 1950s that Thuya Garden was created.^8\n\nIn one of life's unexpected turns, the dismantling of Beatrix Farrand’s Reef Point Gardens in Bar Harbor was the catalyst for the physical creation of Charles Savage’s Thuya Garden. Farrand, a practicing landscape architect, had envisioned sharing her seaside specimens with students interested in garden design. She would teach them, for example, which Rhododendrons were suited to Maine’s cold winters and how both tall and dwarf White Spruces were striking elements integrated into a designed landscape. Her plans abruptly changed in the mid-1950s. She chose to demolish her gardens, but her years of experimentation and labor would not be lost. When Savage, not only a gifted and largely self-taught landscape designer but also a Reef Point board member, heard about her decision, he was determined to salvage Farrand’s plants. He would find a home for them in Asticou, integrating them into two new gardens he already had in mind. One of them was Thuya Garden (the other was Asticou Azalea Garden). Soon hundreds of Farrand’s specimens, bought with Savages’s own money and the financial assistance of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., were dug up at Reef Point and transported to Asticou by his cousin Gus Phillips and other local workers.^12\n\nSavage had been considering garden designs for the Thuya property for years, rendering some of the details in color sketches. He envisioned a small English border-style garden at home in Thuya’s natural surroundings. Just as Curtis had integrated rustic lookouts into the hillside Terraces years earlier, Savage designed simple shelters with comfortable seating for the new garden. Curtis’s spring would be protected by a wellhouse pavilion.\n\nIt was Savage’s vision for a pair of large cedar gates with hand-carved panels that gave Gus the opportunity to demonstrate more than his talent for carpentry. The cousins discussed the individual panel designs—twenty-four for each gate. Almost all would depict a local plant or animal—a fiddlehead, a jack-in-the-pulpit, a rabbit, a frog, etc. Visitors to the garden would be greeted by an entrance that was both functional and artistic. Gus agreed to take on the carving project and the construction of the gates that would house the panels. Savage would carve two additional larger panels out of mahogany to identify Thuya Garden and Thuya Lodge. All fifty panels would be set into the gates. As Gus carved away in his workshop, many relatives and friends found excuses to seek him out there. Crossing the threshold into the shop, they were greeted by the spicy sweet fragrance of cedar shavings and chips. Lingering became a habit.\n\nBy the early 1960s, Gus was carving the gates’ panels. As an owl, a rabbit, a pitcher plant and more were coming to life, Gus found himself burdened with many other responsibilities and little time for rest. He, and his wife Mary, also worked part-time for their Savage relatives who owned the Asticou Inn. Gus often took on carpentry projects for summer neighbors. A significant part of their yearly income was derived from renting out their large, shingle-style house for the summer season. Each spring they moved into their small house located behind the Phillips House. When their 5 children were young, the family’s vegetable farm truck carried their belongings to the little house. By the 1960s, Gus’s Rambler made the trips back and forth. During the summer days, Mary donned her gray uniform and starched white apron and walked to her own big house, where she spent the day as the housekeeper for the family that rented there. On top of all this, Mary and Gus were caring for Mary’s elderly and ailing mother who now lived with them. The year 1960 ended with the death of Gus’s brother Luther on Christmas Eve.\n\nPath and road maps of Mount Desert Island, 1975 edition, by Augustus “Gus” Phillips, courtesy Northeast Harbor Library.\n\nIn the 1960s, Mount Desert Island’s population increased more dramatically each summer season. In 1968, Acadia National Park recorded 2,303,300 visitors.^18 Although the island’s Gilded Age was now a memory, the descendants of earlier rusticators and cottagers continued to return for the season and maintained friendships with many of the island’s year-round residents. At the same time, a boom in tourism led to vacationers booking shorter stays at motels with names like The National Park, The Sunny Side, and The Anchorage.^19 A new generation of seasonal residents began renovating some of the historic cottages and secured land for new houses. Gus found these tourists eager to buy postcards and maps.\n\nThree of Gus’s Post Cards of Mount Desert Island and Acadia National Park\n\nLocal businesses, as well as the Acadia Corporation that services the national park, kept Gus hopping as he delivered their orders for thousands of postcards and hundreds of maps. Frequently, he recorded sales to local and seasonal residents. Among them was Admiral Samuel Eliot Morison, a summertime neighbor in Northeast Harbor. Morison, a Harvard historian and Pulitzer Prize winning author wrote many books, including The Story of Mount Desert Island. He placed an order for 3,000 postcards.\n\nBy this time Gus had photographed Thuya’s gates and parts of the garden and terraces. He had the images published as postcards. Gus’s recorded sales indicate that the Thuya shots were popular. Because his jumbo-size postcards of Hebron Academy had sold well, he had both regular and jumbo-sized cards of Thuya’s hand-carved gates printed. Another postcard shows a visitor admiring one of the summer border garden beds. The woman is Gus’s wife Mary. Gus continued his practice of including his wife in a photo whenever she would acquiesce. One can just hear her saying, “‘Gustus, be quick! I’ve got work to do.”\n\nEver since Joseph Curtis tended his hillside acres over 100 years ago, caretakers have preserved what makes Thuya, well, Thuya. It is the dedication of those who keep returning to this place, as well as the delight of those who discover it for the first time—as visionaries, as laborers, as visitors—that elevates Thuya from an ordinary to an extraordinary landscape. Maintaining Thuya requires the labor of a gifted, creative group of caring individuals. At Thuya it’s easy to step away from our busy lives for a few minutes or, as Peter Zumthor says, “stay for a very long time.” One more greeting from Gus can be read by visitors before they step into Thuya Lodge. To the left of the entrance door is a large map with an overview of the Thuya property that he completed in 1973.\n\nPhotographer’s Notes—John T. Meader\n\nIn the summer of 2021 I visited Thuya Garden and Lodge for the first time. Winding up the narrow road that climbs the hillside from Peabody Drive I marveled at the beautiful forest of cedars and pines growing between ledge outcrops highlighted with lichens and mosses. It’s easy to see why Joseph Curtis was enthralled by this landscape, it draws you in. My approach at shooting the garden on that warm August day was threefold. First, I wanted to recreate Gus’s shots from the 1960’s to see how the garden compares to what Gas saw through his lens nearly 60 years ago. Second, I wanted to capture the craftsmanship of the lodge, fences, and gates, many of which Gus had a hand in creating. Finally I wanted to study the delicate balance of colors and forms created by the blossoms and plants so carefully maintained by today’s skilled and knowledgeable gardeners. The images throughout this entry will hopefully give a visual sense of the dedication and hard work required to maintain this garden which was first conceived in the mind of Charles Savage many years ago.\n\nFurther Reading and Viewing\n\nBaldwin, Letitia.
