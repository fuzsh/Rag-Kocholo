        "text": "Robert “Bob” John Gorz passed on January 11th, 2021 at 64 years of age following an arduous battle with covid-19. Bob was born in Chicago on April 21, 1956. He was the first born son of Ann and the late Casimir Gorz. Bob was also the dear brother of the late Roseann Nowak, Theresa Wolf (the late Steve Wolf), James (Fran) Gorz, Maryann (William) Fudacz, and Margaret (Bud) Podrazik. Bob was the beloved father to Keith, Mark, and Jaime (Jake) Gorz. Bob attended Bogan high school where he met the mother of his children Linda Avila (Carlos), and they raised their family in Frankfort, IL. Following a separation from the mother of his children, Bob became the loving partner to Chris Schowerer and was looked up to by her daughters Heather (Doug) and Heidi (Brandon). Bob was also a ‘grandfather’ to Heather’s children: Jason and Michael as well as his grand dogs: Shelby and Teddy. Bob loved to travel to his vacation home in Branson, Missouri to see live headliner musical shows. He adored hiking and taught his children from a young age to hike various trails all over the state of Illinois. Bob loved country and western music and was rarely seen without his signature cowboy hat. Family games were a staple in the Gorz household, where Bob taught his children how to lose graciously and boast generously when you won. Bob was an active member of the Knights of Columbus where he was a 4th ranking brother within the group. He loved being a knight and was often seen serving his church: St. Boniface Catholic church in Monee, IL or St. Paul the Apostle Catholic Church in Peotone, IL. Bob will always be remembered for his generous heart, loving personality, and sarcastic humor. Bob will be missed by so many. May God embrace his gracious soul in heaven.\n\nA memorial visitation will be held at St. Paul the Apostle Catholic Church in Peotone on Saturday, January 23, 2021 from 9:30 a.m.-11:00 a.m. with a memorial funeral mass being celebrated at 11:00 a.m., Father Roger Kutzner officiating. Due to the global health pandemic (COVID-19) the wearing of a face covering will be required to enter the church and social distancing must be observed.
