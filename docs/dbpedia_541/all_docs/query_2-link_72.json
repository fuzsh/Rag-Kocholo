        "text": "Tamberlane is a webcomic about a clumsy bat and her very human baby...\n\nThe animal citizens of Treehollow have discovered a small, strange creature wandering alone in the forest: a human child! And they have no idea what it is. Clearly much too young to be on her own, it’s anyone’s guess how this mysterious being, named Tamberlane, ended up in their town of Treehollow.\n\nFostered by Belfry, the accident-prone bat, and guided by a colorful cast of animal characters, Tamberlane’s mysteries continue to unfold. But questions burn in everyone’s minds: who, and what, is she? And could she have something to do with the far-off and unspeakable taboo, Abroad?\n\nUpdates every Wednesday.\n\nRated PG-13 for themes of xenophobia and childhood neglect.\n\nSpecial Thanks to Long-Standing Patrons\n\nPatrons who have pledged for at least 12 consecutive months are added to the list below! Thank you so, so much for your unending enthusiasm!\n\nWant to have your name on here too? Get started on Patreon!"
