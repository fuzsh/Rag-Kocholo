I think you will find them both interesting and fun...\n\nHmmmmmm....\n\nHISTORY OF ERIE COUNTY CHAPTER XV. BENCH AND BAR. THE OLD ERIE COUNTY BAR.\n\n…Francis Drake Parish was a man of Puritanical stripe. He was honest, conscientious, faithful, and zealous in his profession and in every good work. He possessed a moral firmness that could not be excelled; a man of good acquirements and legal abilities; a man who hated iniquity and despised meanness; a strong religionist, a temperance tetotaler [sic], and a strong abolitionist when that outspoken sentiment meant personal and professional unpopularity. Mr. Parish had the courage to avow his sentiments in this regard even in the face of an excited and howling mob.\n\nThis man was a native of New York State, born in the year 1796. When twenty-four years old he came to Columbus, O., where he read law, and where, in 1822, he was admitted to the bar. In the same year he came to Sandusky City and commenced practice, which he continued until the year 1852 when he retired from the hard work of the profession on account of a bronchial affection. In 1875 he left Erie county and removed to Lorain county, where he died a short time ago.\n\nLucas Selkirk Beecher was born in New Haven county Conn., on the 31st of March, 1798. At the age of about thirteen years he was maimed by the loss of a leg. When about eighteen years old, with his parents he became a resident of Genesee county, N. Y. The early education of Mr. Beecher was received at the common schools and at the village academy. After coming to reside in Genesee county he taught the village school. Later he entered the office of Hopkins and Beecher at Canaseraga, where he studied the law until the year 1824, when he was admitted to the bar, after which he began the practice at Williamsport, Pa. Two years later in the year 1828, Mr. Beecher came to Sandusky, where he formed a law partnership with Hon. Elentheros Cooke.\n\nNo sooner had our subject become fairly established in professional business at this place than a terrible misfortune befell him; he became totally blind. After a time under the invitation of kind friends he went to the City of New York for treatment, hoping that his eyesight might be restored, which, in a measure, was accomplished—sufficiently to allow him to resume his practice and read and write a little.\n\nReturning after some months to Sandusky Mr. Beecher formed a copartnership with John F. Campbell, who also subsequently became totally blind, and was obliged to retire from the profession. Mr. Beecher then associated himself with Pitt Cooke, and subsequently Cuyler Leonard, and finally in 1853 with his son, John T. Beecher, which latter firm continued until the death of its senior member in the year 1882.\n\nDisabled as he was, when just entering upon the threshold of successful practice, nevertheless, he rose to a height which enabled him to easily maintain his position as a leader in this most difficult of all professions. We take pride in rendering this tribute of regard to the memory of a man so deservedly honored by the profession as an example of the success which can be achieved by…\n\nHISTORY OF ERIE COUNTY OHIO - With Illustrations and Biographical Sketches of Some of Its Prominent Men and Pioneers. - Edited by Lewis Cass Aldrich - Syracuse, N.Y. - D.

This is a pic of what remained of the old Methodist-Episcopal church following a fire that occurred there in the very late 1920s.\n\nFortunately, when the fire took place it was not being used as a church anymore. Due to a decrease in congregation numbers in the early 20s the congregants had either transferred to the First Congregational or the Evangelical & Reformed church.\n\nThis photo shows the back part of the structure. Obviously, the steeple was ruined. The entire church was thereafter razed and the Standard Oil Company of Ohio established a filling station on the site. Many Vermilionites knew the site as Fulper’s Auto Parts.\n\nCurrently, the entire site is vacant and is owned by the city of Vermilion. Unfortunately some think of it as a parking lot. The property is worth beaucoup bucks.\n\nA ROSE BY ANY OTHER NAME…\n\nI was an air traffic controller stationed at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michigan. One morning we picked up a Montana National Guard passenger aircraft. Instead of identifying the plane by its five-digit tail number, its pilot radioed, \"Selfridge Approach, this is Pig Sty One.\"\n\nAs we were taught to refer to aircraft by whatever call sign the pilot used, the controller thereafter called the craft \"Pig Sty One.\"\n\nJust after touching down, the pilot contacted the tower.\n\n\"Selfridge,\" he said, \"our call sign is not 'Pig Sty One.' It is 'Big Sky One,' and we have the governor of Montana on board!\"\n\nLOCAL ANNOUNCEMENTS: After giving it much thought this link has been \"put-down\". During the last year most of the folks who used to use this page as a bulletin board have acquired their own and, consequently, no longer need this forum from \"Views\". I have, however, kept links (in the links section) to Larry Hohler's \"Hope Homes\" in Kenya - and to Bette Lou Higgins' Eden Valley Enterprises sites. They are historically and socially relevant projects. I suggest that you visit these sites on a regular basis to see \"what's shakin'\".\n\nPay particular note to the \"Hope Homes\" page during the next few months / years. They are constantly improving the lives of their youngsters and those around them. This is an exciting project accomplished by exciting people.\n\nAlthough this Vermilion High School Class of 1959 reunion is over classmates may want to stay connected with each other through organizerROGER BOUGHTON.
