        "text": "And last, but certainly not least, we present the final project in our series of three sister school initiatives: Vogel Elementary in the Seguin ISD. These before and after shots don’t fully capture the excellence of this project. The impeccable craftsmanship and attention to detail speak volumes. When you partner with The Garland Company, Inc., you receive more than just a polished product; you gain a family that cares about your well-being for the long haul. Our customers are at the heart of everything we do every day. It’s incredible knowing that the students attending these schools don’t have to worry about the roof over their heads. At Garland, we’re not just taking care of roofs; we’re protecting the lives and education of the world’s future leaders! #SchoolRenovation #ImpeccableCraftsmanship #AttentionToDetail #TheGarlandCompany #CustomerFirst #FutureLeaders #QualityRoofing #CommunitySupport #SeguinISD #VogelElementary #BuildingExcellence #EducationMatters #RoofingSolutions #PartnerWithTheBest #LongTermCare\n\nEvery time I step into my class at Arizona State University, I'm met with a wave of energy, potential, and the possibilities of the industry's future. Thanks to Dr. Tony Lamanna 's invitation, I've had the privilege of teaching Building Enclosure Management for three consecutive semesters. Tony has also gathered colleagues like Marcus Myers, Jesse Pruitt, and James Murphy who, by day, lead in their respective roles in the construction industry. By night, they teach various subjects that center on their passion and expertise. Together, we're more than just educators; we're torchbearers, passing down tools, insights, and experiences we wish we had when we were starting out. For me, it's a pledge to the industry that raised us. It's a way of saying, \"Thank you, and here's to the next generation.\" Students, keep your spirits high and your aspirations higher. And always remember - our industry is about crafting stories, as much as it is about constructing buildings. Your story is just beginning. #ASU #BuildingForTheFuture #Construction #fieldverified ---\n\nThe news about #lakeforestcollege just keeps getting better. The methodology used to determine these rankings speaks highly to our mission, what we value, and what we do best. Student outcomes account for 70 percent of each school’s overall score, which is based on the impact a degree from Lake Forest College has on graduates’ salaries versus similar colleges as well as our graduation rates and the length of time it takes students to pay off the net price of attendance. In other words, a Lake Forest College education is of exceptional value.\n\nOne of the primary reasons I chose LFC was its value proposition. Comparing a college degree to owning a car, employers prefer candidates with reliable transportation because it increases their likelihood of punctuality. In contrast to media and societal messages advocating for luxury (like a Lamborghini) to secure employment, a practical choice, such as a Honda Civic, suffices. The fundamental guideline is to avoid spending beyond your anticipated first-year post-graduation income. This ensures that your monthly expenses will only have max 15% allocation for student loan payments. Then it will be easier to allocate 10% for a car, and 20% for living costs, remain within 45% of your income— a Debt-to-Income ratio (DTI) that most lenders consider financially comfortable. This principle isn't about fortune-telling but recognizing that financial patterns can be predicted. By adhering to this model, you can avoid both overpaying and underpaying for your college education, setting the stage for successful financial management. #college #education #scholarships #firsttimehomebuyer #VAHomeLoanSpecialist #FHAHomeLoans #lakeforestcollege\n\nAs we prepare to welcome back employees to the Hilltop next week, we've been thinking about the legacy of mentorship that exists among the faculty at Hackley. Click the link below to read about the \"Legacy of Learning\" on the Hilltop, a feature that first appeared in our summer edition of the Hackley Review. #HackleySchool #HackleyHilltop #WeAreHackley #HackleyReview\n\nIt's finally here.... I'm pleased to announce a new and exciting chapter for Built Environments - North Carolina! Many already know that I have joined forces with Jarrett Davis to offer a new and even bolder brand of building science. Our new Carolina testing facility is bigger, better, and full of ideas! Expect many new announcements in the coming months! Though I'll still have a major presence in Minnesota, my immediate focus now involves enclosure performance in hot, humid coastal environments. These initiatives will only grow in the coming years. Along the way, we'll tackle (and develop) new products, new approaches, and new ways of thinking about the built environment. #buildingscience #northcarolina #buildingenvelope #buildingenclosure #buildingproducts #materialsscience #materialscience #researchanddevelopment #research #letsdothis"
