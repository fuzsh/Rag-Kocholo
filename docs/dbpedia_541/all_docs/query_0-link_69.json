        "text": "Keith Helfrich Sergeant Major, US Army (Ret.)\n\nVeterans Charity Ride to Sturgis 2017 Mentor\n\n“Hero’s Ride of a Lifetime” Recipient 2016\n\n​“Veterans Charity Ride (VCR) took me under their wing at a time when I was in a dark place. VCR helped to show me that there is help, and that life could be good again. VCR is an organization that is there for the veterans, and continues to stay in contact and help veterans.”\n\n“Returning as a Mentor for Veterans Charity Ride to Sturgis 2017 is an honor for me. I want to give back to other veterans as much as they, and VCR have given to me. I would love to help every veteran, but if I reach out to just one and change their life, as mine was changed, that would be rewarding and make the experience of being a returning mentor worthwhile.”\n\nKeith Helfrich joined the Army in 1986 as an 11B (Infantryman), after three years he competed in the Best Ranger competition and tried out for Special Forces. After two years of training Keith was assigned to 10th Special Forces as an operator 18B (Special Forces Weapons Sergeant). Keith was promoted and worked as an 18F (Special Forces Assistant Operations and Intelligence Sergeant) and finally as an 18Z (Special Forces Operations Sergeant). Keith had the privilege to lead the most elite soldiers onto the battlefield as a Team Sergeant and as a Sergeant Major. His combat experience includes Operation Just Cause, Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm, Operation Provide Comfort II, Bosnia, and Iraq.\n\nKeith was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for his contribution in a combined operation with three Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha (SFOD-A) units during Operation Iron Fist. It was a joint Iraqi/U.S. raid on Salman Pak which was a stronghold for insurgents. Command was expecting high casualties on the U.S. side. The raid lasted over 10 hours with house-to-house fighting. The operation resulted in the capture of over 100 insurgents and the enemy surrendering the town of Salman Pak to U.S. troops. Keith’s planning and execution of the operation as the ground commander and his maneuvering of teams resulted in no friendly casualties.\n\n​\n\nKeith served four tours in Iraq. In 2012, after 26 years of service, he was medically retired with a 100% disability after sustaining his last injury."
