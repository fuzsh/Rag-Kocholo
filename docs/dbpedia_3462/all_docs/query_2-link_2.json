        "text": "Evidence of human impact on the vegetation obtained from pollen diagrams at sites in the process of neolithisation is often difficult to detect. Apart from aspects like site function and occupation intensity, methodological aspects play a considerable role. In the Rhine-Meuse delta in the Netherlands, neolithisation is documented at the Final Mesolithic sites Hardinxveld-Giessendam Polderweg and Hardinxveld-Giessendam De Bruin and the local Early Neolithic sites of Brandwijk-Kerkhof and the Hazendonk, covering the period of 5500–2500 cal. b.c. The off-site core from Hardinxveld-Giessendam De Bruin supports earlier results that human influence on the vegetation at Hardinxveld is restricted and difficult to distinguish from natural vegetation disturbance. Human impact is more easily recognisable in the diagrams of Neolithic phases at Brandwijk-Kerkhof and the Hazendonk that show evidence of both domestic animals and cereals. Continuing neolithisation and also research methodology, including the location of the pollen cores, may play a role in this. It is tested whether the use of a new pollen sum excluding extra-regional taxa increases the visibility of human impact. Keywords: Neolithisation, Human impact, Pollen sum, Palynological methodology, Mesolithic, Swifterbant culture.\n\nThis study presents an integrated archaeobotanical analysis of human impact at the Dutch Neolithic wetland site the Hazendonk (4000–1800 cal BC). The analysis included pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs and macroremains from on-site sample columns and macroremains and wood from refuse layers. The various remains provide evidence of disturbance of both dryland and wetland vegetation, information on crop cultivation and food plants, and indications of selection of wood for artefacts. The integrated approach provides results that would not have been obtained by the analysis of one of the sources alone. Keywords: integrated archaeobotany, human impact, food plants, selective use of wood, non-pollen palynomorphs See for more information about this site appendix 3 of Sowing the seed: https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/14033\"\n\nBrandwijk-Kerkhof (ca. 4600 to 3630 cal B.C.) is a Neolithic site, located on a river dune in the Dutch Rhine/Maas river area. The natural vegetation and human impact upon it have been investigated by analysis of pollen and macroremains from four cores that are located at increasing distances up to 20 m from the site. The relationship between the strength of human impact on the vegetation and the distance of the cores from the river dune has been investigated as well. The results show that the natural vegetation on top of the river dune consisted of deciduous woodland, while in the surrounding wetlands alder carr and eutrophic marsh vegetation dominated. Human impact of limited strength resulted in more open and disturbed vegetation. There is no correlation between the strength of the evidence of human impact in the pollen diagrams and the distance of the cores from the river dune. The evidence for presence of crop plants from the cores is compared with evidence from the excavation. The first presence of crop plants from ca. 4200 B.C. onwards corresponds with data from other Dutch wetland sites. Large-scale local crop cultivation cannot however be demonstrated. Keywords: pollen analysis, botanical macroremains, human impact, neolithisation, crop cultivation, Swifterbant culture\n\nThis article presents an overview of the current evidence on the process of Neolithisation in the Dutch wetlands. Over the years, several models have been proposed with different perspectives on the timing and pace of the process: a long transition, an early short transition, and a late short transition. The applicability of any of these models is, of course, dependent of the evidence. In this article, we briefly discuss recently obtained data from the Netherlands on vegetation disturbance (woodland clearing), soil disturbance (tillage), cereal cultivation, animal husbandry, and the use of ceramics. The data discussed involve palynological, sedimentary, micromorphological, archaeobotanical, zooarchaeological, as well as lipid analyses. Hence, it is concluded that from the mid fifth millennium cal. BC onwards, various aspects of a more \"Neolithic lifestyle\" become apparent in the archaeological record, including cereal cultivation on a structural, but small-scale basis in wetland environments. However, despite the \"gradual\" tendency that can be observed, the evidence is as yet inconclusive with regard to any of the models, due to persisting limitations of the datasets, potential regional variability, and aspects of scale. A new project, the Emergence of Domestic Animals in the Netherlands (EDAN), aims at a better understanding of animal husbandry through aDNA and isotope analyses, within a framework of statistical chronological modelling. We expect this project to enhance the debate greatly.\n\nThis paper aims to gain a better understanding of the neolithisation process in the Netherlands after the arrival of the Linearbandkeramik Culture, focussing on local crop cultivation at Neolithic wetland sites of the Swifterbant Culture and Hazendonk Group. The debate of the past 30 years questions whether crop plants were cultivated locally in the exploitation area of wetland sites, or whether they were brought in from elsewhere. Which crop plants were introduced in the wetlands, when they were introduced and where they came from is investigated, based on published evidence from three main regions. The main crop plants introduced were emmer wheat and naked barley. Details of the introduction process are available only for the southern region. The complex discussion of botanical and non-botanical criteria supports local crop cultivation in most regions.
