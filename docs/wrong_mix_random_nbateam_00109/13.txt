Pope Francis vows clergy sex abuse 'must never happen again'

Pope Francis vowed the Catholic Church will never cover up clergy sex abuse and demanded priests who have raped and molested children to turn themselves in.

USA TODAY

Dozens of Texas Roman Catholic clergy members were accused of sexual abuse of minors since 1950.

All 15 Catholic Dioceses in Texas released lists of names of clergy members accused of "credible" claims of sexual abuse of minors. The Diocese of Fort Worth released a list late last year and the other 14 released lists Thursday.

The Ordinariate of the Chair of St. Peter and the dioceses made the decision to release the names back in September 2018. Officials had four months to compile each list.

Each bishop released a statement with each list.

It is estimated there are 8.5 million Catholics and 1,320 Catholic parishes in Texas, making compiling each list "a major project," an October statewide news release said.

The Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops has a list of contact information for victim assistance coordinators for each diocese in the state on its website.

"After contacting the appropriate civil authorities and law enforcement, please report any allegation of abuse to the local diocesan Victim Assistance Coordinator," the website reads.

The website includes a link to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services abuse hotline website and its phone number — 1-800-252-5400.

Here's a roundup of the lists released so far by Texas dioceses:
