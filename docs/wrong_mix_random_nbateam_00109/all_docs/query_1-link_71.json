        "text": "A Texas Legend... and an American Heritage\n\nIn 1964 the State of Texas, City of Waco and private benefactors partnered to collect and preserve the history and heritage of the legendary Texas Rangers for future generations.\n\nIn 1968 a small museum dedicated to the Texas Rangers opened on the banks of the Brazos River through the efforts of the State of Texas/Texas Department of Public Safety, City of Waco and Waco Chamber of Commerce. Today, it has grown into an historical center operated as a department of the City of Waco and has welcomed more than 4.5 million visitors from around the world.\n\nMission\n\nTo collect, preserve and disseminate knowledge of the Texas Rangers, a legendary symbol of Texas and the American West; to document Texas Rangers past and present.\n\nFort Fisher was constructed in February 1837 by order from William Fisher, Secretary of War for the Republic of Texas. It was a humble collection of quickly constructed shelters on the banks of the Brazos River for the purpose of housing a small company of Texas Rangers. After only a few months, it was decided that this location was too remote for the Rangers to provide adequate service and was abandoned. The original site of Fort Fisher is unknown, being described only as being “near the springs of the Brazos” by a Waco Indian camp.\n\nThe current site of Fort Fisher Park was chosen because of its proximity to the newly constructed I-35. In 1968, the Texas Ranger Museum and Texas Rangers Company “F” headquarters opened in the Park as an educational attraction to tell the story of Texas through the history of the Rangers. The Museum building was not based on any actual known Fort but was supposed to represent a vision of a fort on the Texas frontier.\n\nThe Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum’s mission is to collect, preserve, study and exhibit artifacts, artwork and archives relating to the Texas Ranger service while permanently documenting the service of the Texas Rangers past and present. More than four million people have visited the museum since its doors were opened."
