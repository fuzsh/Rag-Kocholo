Though we are the newest university press in North Texas (following SMU Press and TCU Press), we have quickly become a leading press with the most titles in print (more than 300) and published (15 to 16 each year). We are fully accredited members of the Association of American University Presses. Our books are distributed and marketed nationally and internationally through the Texas A&M University Press Consortium.\n\nThe University of North Texas Press is dedicated to producing the highest quality scholarly, academic, and general interest books for the Dallas-Fort Worth-Denton metroplex, state, national, and international communities as part of an outreach activity. As a part of the largest and most comprehensive research university in North Texas, UNT Press holds to the philosophy that university presses should be on the cutting edge of publishing and thus is not adverse to the different and unusual in its publishing agenda. We are committed to serving all peoples by publishing stories of their cultures and their experiences that have been overlooked. We seek to nurture the development of writers by publishing first books and by publishing poetry and short story collections. We strive to advance understanding and appreciation of the historical, intellectual, scientific, and cultural milieu through our publications. Through sales, advertisements, and reviews of UNT Press books nationally and internationally, we strive to enhance and support the University of North Texas as an academic presence in education and community life.\n\nAdditionally, UNT Press distributes three scholarly journals: Journal of Schenkerian Studies, Military History of the West, and Theoria.\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\n\nMailing Address:\n\nUNT Press\n\n1155 Union Circle #311336\n\nDenton, TX 76203\n\nShipping Address:\n\nLibrary Annex\n\n941 Precision Dr.\n\nDenton, TX 76207\n\nPhone: 940-565-2142\n\nRon Chrisman, Director\n\n[email protected]\n\nAmy Maddox, Managing Editor\n\n[email protected]\n\nJoe Alderman, Marketing Manager\n\n[email protected]\n\nLexy Cosmann, Administrative Assistant\n\n[email protected]"
