He raises questions about “official” history—what is overlooked and why, and the biases held by those interpreting it. Cyrus uses a range of materials including musical equipment, food, plant life, and used clothing, but transforms them into densely layered objects that refer to Southern material culture. \n\nThe artworks depicted here were acquired by the Modern following Cyrus’s solo exhibition in spring 2022. In these mixed media works, the artist specifically references the Dallas-Fort Worth area’s Trinity River basin. This sprawling zone of central and north Texas has a rich musical legacy including western swing, blues, Tejano, jazz, rock ’n’ roll, and country western. These works specifically examine the contributions of Fort Worthian multireedist and composer Julius Hemphill (1938–1995). Cyrus draws on the relationship between the land and the musical cultures born from it, a connection that stems from the concept of “alluvial soil,” a phrase coined by William Ferris in the book “Blues from the Delta.” The term describes the material sediment, including clay, gravel, and alluvium, that spills over and deposits onto the banks of flooded rivers and is rife with fertile possibilities, both agricultural and cultural. Exploring our area’s landscapes, natural and manmade, Cyrus’s works dive into the poetic layers, histories, and mythologies of a region bifurcated and shaped by the Trinity River. \n\nPlan your visit to see these works, on view now! As we prepare our upcoming special exhibition, “Surrealism and Us: Caribbean and African Diasporic Artists since 1940,” admission to the Modern is half-price every day except for Fridays and Sundays, when admission is free. \n___ \nArtwork credits in first pinned comment.\n#JamalCyrus #Sculpture #MixedMedia #DFWArt\".",
