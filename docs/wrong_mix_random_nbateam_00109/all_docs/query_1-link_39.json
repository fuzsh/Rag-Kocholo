This special First Friday features a runway show presented by Fort Worth Fashion Week. \n \n“The Future” fashion runway show starts at 7 pm and is a first-of-its-kind collaboration, as Texas universities come together in Fort Worth to showcase the future of fashion. Watch as aspiring fashion designers unveil their designs on the runway with special guest host NBC 5 News Anchor, Evan Anderson. Reserved seating is available for purchase. Learn more about the fashion show at the link in bio. \n \nAs always during First Fridays, tasty light bites and specialty drinks will be available for purchase by Café Modern. Featured items on the menu include hummus with tapenade and a cheese and charcuterie box. For a more elevated and intimate dinner experience, enjoy a sit-down meal at Café Modern’s indoor or patio dining areas!  \n\nMake plans before the fashion show to join the complimentary 20-minute docent-led tour at 6:30 pm focusing on artworks in “Surrealism and Us” by Elliot and Erick Jiménez, Ja’Tovia Gary, and Kenny Rivero.  \n___ \nPhoto by Agnieszka Mojsiewicz (@agnieszkam_photography); Model La Cora Robinson (@iamlacorazon) \n@fortworthfashionweek @cafemodernfw @nbcdfw @visitfortworth @visitafortworth \n#ModernFirstFridays #FortWorthFashionWeek #TheModernFW #VisitFortWorth #TexasToDo #DFWArt #FortWorthArt\".",
