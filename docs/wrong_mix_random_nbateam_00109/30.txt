Assignee(s): UNASSIGNED

Law Firm: No Counsel

Application No., Date, Speed: 17540893 on 12/02/2021 (866 days app to issue)

Abstract: A combination leash and pet toy includes a hollow casing having an exterior surface formed of an FDA-approved rubber similar to that of conventional chew toys. Extending from the casing interior is a spring-biased cord having a swiveling bolt-snap connector at a distal end for coupling with a pet collar. The connector can removably seat within a cavity that is enclosed with a locking lid when the device is being used as a toy. Accordingly, the device may be used as a conventional dog leash by coupling the snap connector to a pet leash. To convert the device to a toy, a user places the snap connector within the cavity and secures the lid to the casing. The casing can then be safely chewed or carried by a pet or tossed by the pet”s owner as with a conventional pet toy.

Abstract: System and methods for event prediction during drilling operations are provided. Regression data associated with coefficients of a predictive model are retrieved for a downhole event during a drilling operation along a planned path of a wellbore. The regression data includes a record of changes in historical coefficient values associated with prior occurrences of the event. As the wellbore is drilled over different stages of the operation, a value of an operating variable is estimated based on values of the coefficients and real-time data acquired during each stage. A percentage change in coefficient values adjusted between successive stages of the operation is tracked. An occurrence of the downhole event is estimated, based on a correlation between the percentage change tracked for at least one coefficient and a corresponding change in the historical coefficient values. The path of the wellbore is adjusted, based on the estimated occurrence of the event.

Law Firm: Banner Witcoff, Ltd. (3 non-local offices)

Application No., Date, Speed: 17822865 on 08/29/2022 (596 days app to issue)

Abstract: An event processing system may identify duplicate events and prevent one or more of the duplicate events from being processed. The event processing system may determine the duplicate events, which are not permitted to be processed more than once, and allow these duplicate events to be processed exactly once. The event processing system may allow events, which are permitted to be processed more than once, to be processed without determining whether the events are duplicate events. If a main data center of the event processing system fails, a backup data center may take over instantly event processing from the main data center and may prevent events that have been processed by the main data center from being processed. Multiple data centers may work together and process events in an active-active mode by offering the exactly once processing as well as removing any duplicate events from upstream systems.

System and method for writing data to tape and reading data from tape using a restful interface

Patent No. 11961541

Inventor(s): Doug Burling (Plano, TX), Jeff Leuschner (Wylie, TX)

Assignee(s): Quantum Corporation (San Jose, CA)

Law Firm: No Counsel

Application No., Date, Speed: 18107246 on 02/08/2023 (433 days app to issue)

Abstract: A system ([b]200[/b]) for at least one of writing data to tape media ([b]204[/b]) and reading data from the tape media ([b]204[/b]) includes a client application ([b]202[/b]); and a RESTful interface ([b]212[/b]) through which the client application ([b]202[/b]) transmits a request to at least one of write data to the tape media ([b]204[/b]) and read data from the tape media ([b]204[/b]) to a REST daemon ([b]214[/b]), the RESTful interface ([b]212[/b]) being integrated with a SCSI interface ([b]210[/b]). The REST daemon ([b]214[/b]) subsequently passes the request on to a data mover ([b]208[/b]), which opens a second RESTful interface ([b]220[/b]) with the client application ([b]202[/b]). The client application ([b]202[/b]) then sends the request to the data mover ([b]208[/b]) via the second RESTful interface ([b]220[/b]). The data mover ([b]208[/b]) then performs the request by moving the data between the client application ([b]202[/b]) and the tape media ([b]204[/b]), with the data never landing on primary storage during such movement.

Application No., Date, Speed: 17511818 on 10/27/2021 (902 days app to issue)

Abstract: A memory apparatus and method of operation are provided. The apparatus includes memory cells connected to word lines including at least one edge word line and other data word lines. The memory cells are arranged in strings and are configured to retain a threshold voltage corresponding to data states. The strings are organized in rows and a control means is coupled to the word lines and the strings and identifies the at least one edge word line. The control means programs the memory cells of the strings in particular ones of the rows and associated with the at least one edge word line to have an altered distribution of the threshold voltage for one or more of the data states compared to the memory cells of the strings not in particular ones of the rows and not associated with the at least one edge word line during a program operation.

Abstract: A plurality of memory programming the memory cells to at least one programmed data state in a plurality of program-verify iterations. In each iteration, after a programming pulse, a sensing operation is conducted to compare the threshold voltages of the memory cells to a low verify voltage associated with a first programmed data state and to a high very voltage associated with the first programmed data state. The sensing operation includes discharging a sense node through a bit line coupled to one of the memory cells and
