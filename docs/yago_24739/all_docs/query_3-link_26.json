        "text": "Since 1989, Constance Campbell Trainee Travel Awards have helped defray travel costs to scientific meetings and conferences for recipients. The first recipients of the awards were announced at the 33rd Mini-symposium on Reproductive Biology; see previous winners and their respective scientific findings below. These awards are provided through the Constance Campbell Memorial Fund, established in memory of Constance Campbell by her husband Dr. Jack Davis, family, friends and colleagues.\n\nCampbell cared deeply about student research. She did her postdoctoral training with CRS founding director Neena Schwartz, PhD, at the University of Illinois at Chicago. In 1974, Campbell was hired as an assistant professor in the Northwestern Department of Biological Sciences, where her research focused on the relationship between the environment and sexual and other behaviors. Campbell administered the undergraduate honors program and served as a preceptor in the Program for Reproductive Biology that preceded CRS. The program launched the first Minisymposium in Reproductive Biology in 1980 with Campbell's enthusiastic participation. That same year she was promoted to associate professor and granted tenure, however, lost her battle with cancer the following year.\n\nSupport this fund"
