        "text": "A popular way to discover the Höri is a circular walk across the peninsula, which takes up to four hours and is organised by the local culture and guest office. The hike takes Lake Constance holidaymakers through the original meadow, forest and hilly landscapes of the Höri. One destination, for example, is the Schiener Berg. This is the local mountain on the Höri peninsula and, at 715 metres in height, is classified as a pre-Alpine upland and moorland region. A large network of trails provides access to the Schiener Berg, which lies in the middle of the nature reserve of the same name. The reserve is in turn home to the Schiener Berg fauna-flora habitat and parts of the Untersee bird sanctuary and is a refuge for many species of birds. And, of course, we shouldn’t forget Lake Constance itself. In our hotel you will find the perfect place to recharge your batteries after the hike. And if you’re looking for no-frills accommodation to spend the night, our budget rooms might be just the thing for you.\n\nAll themed hikes at a glance"
