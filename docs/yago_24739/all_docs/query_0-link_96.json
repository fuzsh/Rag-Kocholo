        "text": "Alexander Charles Vasa (Polish: Aleksander Karol Waza; 4 November 1614 – 19 November 1634) was the fifth son of King Sigismund III of Poland and his wife Constance of Austria.\n\nDuring the election of 1632 he supported his brother Vladislaus IV Vasa. After his voyage to Italy and Germany in 1634, Alexander supported the movement for the war with Ottoman Empire but died before he had any significant influence on the events. He died from smallpox in Lwów or in the village of Wielkie near Warsaw on 19 November 1634."
