Magdalena might rely to much on her brother creating a rift with the Inner Austrian Habsburgs. Constance with her strong Catholicism may face the same problems her brother faced in Bohemia OTL.\n\nWhat about the other Italian ladies that were considered for Rudolf II - Giulia d'Este (whose relative Cardinal d'Este pushed her forward), Margherita of Savoy (OTL duchess of Mantua, vicereine of Portugal - pushed forward by her stepuncle (by blood) Felipe III) and her uncle (by marriage) Albrecht VII of Austria) or Eleonora Gonzaga (OTL Holy Roman Empress to Ferdinand II). Maria de Medici was also considered for Rudolf, but by the time Matthias becomes emperor she's already queen of France. Although, I could see her pulling a Leonor of Portugal and choosing Matthias over Henri if given the choice to be a queen or an empress.\n\nI might be a bit overdramatic, but I think hornet's nest is an understatement.\n\nI'd completely agree with that sentiment. It's kind of why I think a marriage with Constance would be hard. A marriage to Maria Christina or indeed to anyone before about 1610 also seems difficult given the internal conflicts within the family during Rudolf's reign. My understanding is that it's what killed his chances with Magdalena. So although a German bride would be preferable I'm not sure one could be arranged. I only originally included Eleonora as an Italian because her family was pushing her for a Habsburg marriage, albeit to the Spanish branch but I'm warming to the idea of Margherita. But you'd have to overcome Charles Emmanuel's rapprochement with France which happened OTL about the time Matthias would be marrying (Treaty of Bruzolo was 1610). Still if Eleonora de' Medici takes her place as wife of Francesco it could potentially avert two succession struggles. So maybe when Henry IV dies Charles Emmanuel chooses to reorient with Matthias.\n\nAnyways suppose Matthias and Margherita have a son, maybe Karl after her father (I doubt he'd use Ferdinand, Maximilian, Leopold, Rudolf or Albert as he wasn't on great terms with them). I could see Matthias and Melchior Klesl manage to engineer young Charles' election to the thrones of Bohemia and Hungary, with suitable concessions of course, made easier by the prospect of Ferdinand of Styria or, god forbid Philip of Spain (as nephew of Matthias) succeeding. But the Imperial Election is a tougher nut to crack. Does Albert stand, does he make way for Ferdinand. They won't elect young Charles especially as it would allow too much power to devolve to the Protestant Electors during his minority. There's also the issue of a Regency for Upper and Lower Austria and I assume also Tyrol (I would guess Matthias would grant it to his son just as son as his brother Maximilian is dead). So would it inevitably lead to a continued struggle within the House of Habsburg?\n\nAs someone who is VERY interested in the Thirty Years' war era I find the idea of Matthias having male issue fascinating. Unfortunately it wouldn't make much difference in regards to Bohemia. Rudolf and Matthias gave away the farm to the Protestant Estates to get support in their Brother's Quarrel (read the Letter of Majesty for example; it went even further than the Edict of Nantes!) and any successor is going to fight tooth and nail to get it back. If it's not Ferdinand II then it's Matthias' son (Maximilian III maybe?). Rudolf and Matthias were pretty flexible religiously but that era of Renaissance compromise was ending. Now this doesn't mean the Thirty Years' war is inevitable; just the Bohemian revolt. if the Bohemians chose someone else/someone else accepts the throne, then the war might be limited to just the Lands of Saint Wenceslas. Of course, flip side we could just as easily see the Protestant Union decide to fully support the Bohemians and mobilization, making the war even worse and open for foreign intervention.\n\nEither way the earliest any marriage could take place would be after June 1608, when Matthias and Rudolf divided the Habsburg Monarchy and the former became King of Hungary. So any son would be at most nine (assuming a 1610 birth as earliest and Matthias dying on schedule in 1619). The only time hat an Emperor died with an underage heir was in 1657, when Ferdinand III left his seventeen-year-old son Leopold I as his heir. That resulted in the longest post Golden Bull interregnum in Imperial history, 14 months. Here the Electors couldn't leave an interregnum of eight years. Sense there was an understanding that one had to reach their majority to be eligible for election, no chance of electing Matthias' son early. Even if Albrecht stands for election (not guaranteed sense he was seen as much to Spanish during the OTL crises around Rudolf II and Matthias' succession) his health collapsed in late 1620 and died in July 1621, meaning another election would potentially take place two years later. Then there's the Dutch complications. The twelve years' truce was expiring and Spain was gearing up for round two with the Netherlands. If Albrecht is Emperor he could drag the Empire into the Eighty Years' war. The Electors aren't going to want to risk it. In which case Ferdinand of Styria is the best candidate. This leaves us with an almost identical repeat of 1440s and 1450s: we have an Emperor (1400s Friedrich III 1620s Ferdinand II) from the junior Styrian branch of the Habsburgs whose likely unable to support the governance of the Empire or his dignity with his meager resources and an underage legitimate successor-heir (Ladislaus 1400s Max III, for lack of a name, in 1620s) ruling the rest of the realms (Hungary, Bohemia and Upper/Lower Austria). This divided succession opens the door for the Protestants to demand greater concessions and place the Austrian and Styrian branches off each other. This scenario could be an even worse mess than OTL. In a way we're lucky that Matthias died childless.\n\nThis is basically what I was thinking. Matthias isn't going to be able to marry before 1609 and by then there aren't many candidates. The Brother's Quarrel has poisoned the well in Germany so it may have to be an Italian. I go back and forth on which one, I'm back to thinking Eleonora as more likely given the about face Charles Emmanuel would have to make, though given Matthias' relationship with Spain I suppose Charles Emmanuel doesn't have to make peace with Philip to wed his daughter. I suppose if he was smart he'd wed her to Matthias as soon as Henry IV dies to try to neutralize the Imperial side, anticipating a loss of French support.\n\nI think the Bohemian Estates would be happy with Matthias' son if they thought they could take advantage of a Regency. The only other options are more rigidly Catholic Habsburgs or the election of another candidate which would mean open rebellion. At the same time I think that increases the probability of a fractured Regency, ie a different Regent/Regency Council in the different realms he rules (Bohemia, Hungary, Austria proper, possibly Tyrol). Matthias can do his best to set it all up before he dies, and certainly the death of his brother Maximilian may make things a little easier but its going to be hard to ensure a smooth transition. I imagine his wife be she Margherita or Eleonora would get some position, Klesl probably has a place in Austria proper maybe also Bohemia, Tyrol will be fought over if his son gets it at all. I suppose Maximilian III may try to leave it to his nephew Ferdinand, though such a will would, I think, be in contravention of the terms of the will of Ferdinand I which partitioned Austria in the first place and against the prerogatives of Matthias as Emperor and head of the House. But Spain would probably rather see further Austria go to Ferdinand, or maybe as OTL to Leopold, as they need it's ruler on their side to ensure the security of the Spanish road.\n\nI guess Ferdinand is probably elected Emperor. I'm skeptical that Albert would throw his hat in the ring not just for the health reasons but because he's already stepped back, it would be hard to reassert his position in the family and the Empire now, even more so with his younger nephew Ferdinand waiting in the wings. Although ironically I could see Klesl/Matthias' wife pushing his candidacy with the expectation that he'd die soon and they could then have Matthias' son elected. Anyways Ferdinand seems more likely but as you said he has no power base, so I wonder it that means he leans more heavily on his brother in law Maximilian of Bavaria and the Catholic League, which would probably not end well. In that case Matthias' son could be supported by the Protestant side, if he continues toleration in Bohemia, which I agree would remain a powder keg. One thing I was wondering was if Matthias' son and/or his Regents would look to outside support against Ferdinand II. Seems like both sides would be angling for a deal with Sigismund or Wladyslaw in neighboring Poland. Given that Wladylsaw is Ferdinand's nephew would he take the Styrian side? Spain's more likely to want to back Ferdinand especially if his son marries the Infanta Maria Anna but on the other hand if Matthias Jr controls Further Austria could he cut a deal with Spain, give them Alsace in exchange for a fat dowery for Maria Anna and their support in the next Election? If they can't come to such an understanding does that open the door for the Bohemian branch to seek an understanding with France? Cut a deal with the Dutch?\n\nI guess Ferdinand's son wouldn't stand much of chance against Matthias' in the next Election. The latter would be an Elector after all, while the former has only the meager territories of Inner Austria. Though a hardline Catholic position could net him the votes of the Ecclesiastical Electors but it's still likely 4-3 in favor of Matthias' son unless a third party jumps in and gains some support from one or more of the three Protestant Electors. So yeah, I guess it's probably just as messy as OTL though I would think, or at least hope, a war on the scale of the 30YW could be avoided. It's interesting in a way because the board is all set, the pieces in place but the birth of a son in the last few years before Matthias' death upends everything. Still messy but in a completely different way as OTL, and given how large the 30YW looms in our history that's saying a lot.\n\nI think the Bohemian Estates would be happy with Matthias' son if they thought they could take advantage of a Regency. The only other options are more rigidly Catholic Habsburgs or the election of another candidate which would mean open rebellion. At the same time I think that increases the probability of a fractured Regency, ie a different Regent/Regency Council in the different realms he rules (Bohemia, Hungary, Austria proper, possibly Tyrol).

But Spain would probably rather see further Austria go to Ferdinand, or maybe as OTL to Leopold, as they need it's ruler on their side to ensure the security of the Spanish road.\n\nAs to a possible successor - Matthias having a son changes the Onate Treaty, doesn't it. Which means we might see the Spanish saying that they should get Further Austria/Bohemia/Hungary by dint of being the children of Matthias' oldest sister, Anna of Austria. Granted, I don't see pious dolt Felipe III making such a move, but it might be brought up.\n\nI guess Ferdinand is probably elected Emperor. I'm skeptical that Albert would throw his hat in the ring not just for the health reasons but because he's already stepped back, it would be hard to reassert his position in the family and the Empire now, even more so with his younger nephew Ferdinand waiting in the wings.

Cut a deal with the Dutch?\n\nSorry for the double post, am on my phone ATM\n\nWladyslaw might be Ferdinand's nephew, but he's not necessarily going to have any love for the family. His stepmother/aunt hated him, because he blocked the succession of her own kids to the Polish throne, among other reasons (one was apparently a rivalry between her and her eldest sister that she transferred to Wladyslaw).\n\nAs to the Spanish, they might marry Maria Ana off elsewhere - particularly if the age-gap is too large to be comfortable between her and Max III/Mats Jnr. Emperor Constantine made a good suggestion of Spain marrying her off to the elector/duke of Bavaria, so as to diversify the Spanish portfolio of alliances/marriages. Another option is she still marries OTL Ferdinand III, but the match is considerably lower - he's a mere archduke here, not the future emperor (unless Ferdinand II is elected as Mats' successor)"
