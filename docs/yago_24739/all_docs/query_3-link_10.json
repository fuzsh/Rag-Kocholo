        "text": "Constance V (2 June 1516 - 6 March 1567), also sometimes called Constance of Navarre, was Queen of Genovia from 1558 to 1567, Holy Roman Empress, Queen consort of Germany, Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia by marriage to Ferdinand I, Archduchess of Austria by marriage to Frederick VI and Regent of Spain from 1540 to 1552. She inherited the Genovian throne through her niece Marie. Her personal motto was vivamus vitae plenissima, id est, semel tibi ago ('live life to the fullest, it is only once you live') in addition to her husband's motto of fiat iustitia, et pereat mundus ('let justice be done, though the world perish').\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nConstance was born on 2 June 1516 to the 16-year-old Princess of Relante Anna. She was her eldest daughter. Constance was mainly raised at her grandfather's court and occasionally her uncle's court in Sicily. She had 3 siblings, Richard, Anne and Isadora. Anna wrote to her brother-in-law Eustace about Constance, telling him \"I gave birth on 2 June. My baby, who I have named Constance, will grow into the most intellectual princess in Genovia and will follow in my footsteps.\"\n\nIn 1524, her grandmother died. Her grandfather, Richard V, sent Anna's family into sanctuary in Caligra. Constance didn't like being in sanctuary. The family was let out in 1526. Constance was then sent to Sicily to attend to her uncle Frederick's wife Sophia. She returned in 1528, and was quickly married off 2 years later.\n\nFirst Marriage[]\n\nIn 1529, Constance became of age. Many suitors asked for her hand, but were only singled down to two: Ferdinand of Austria and Frederick of Austria, both brothers and 13 years Constance's senior. Ferdinand was married, but wanted to annul his marriage to the Hungarian-Bohemian Princess Anne in order to marry Constance. Frederick disliked marriage, but he was pulled into it by his family, the Habsburg's, in order to gain more political influence. Both were valuable offers to Constance.\n\nOn 4 August 1529, Constance chose Ferdinand to be her husband. The Pope rejected Ferdinand's request for an annulment for his marriage to Anna of Bohemia and Hungary, and instead Constance was married to Frederick on 4 October 1530. Constance and Frederick disliked each other greatly, and both were unfaithful. Frederick began an affair with Napolesian Princess Millica of Napolist whilst Constance and Ferdinand began an affair shortly after she was married to Frederick. Upon marriage to Frederick, Constance became an Archduchess of Austria, and they had two children: Blanche of Genovia and Eleanor of Genovia, both were married to the grandsons of Ferdinand respectively. Frederick died in 1557, leaving Constance a widow.\n\nAccession[]\n\nConstance was still second-in-line to the throne when her brother Richard ascended the throne as Richard VI. Constance's niece Marie then ascended the throne after Richard's death. Genovia was then split, with Marie ruling Western Genovia and Rose of Majorca ruling Eastern Genovia. During the first few months of Marie's reign, the Genovian Nobility had to deal with the power of the regency, which had gone to Constance's sister-in-law Maria. Constance wanted to be regent for her niece, so she fought against Maria for it. Maria won the regency, and Constance was named heir to Marie, evaluating her rank to Princess of Genovia. Marie I eventually died in 1558, and Constance was declared Constance V of Genovia, officially Constance V of Western Genovia. In 1561, Rose of Majorca abdicated and Constance became Queen of Eastern Genovia, uniting the two countries once more.\n\nSecond Marriage and Holy Roman Empress[]"
