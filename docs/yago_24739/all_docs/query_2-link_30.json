        "text": "Überlingen, Germany, on Lake Constance (Bodensee), is easy walking, biking or driving distance to several highlights of the region — two of its islands, the “Flower Island” of Mainau and the “Garden Island” of Reichenau, wineries of the area and a few surprises in nearby small lakeside villages, all with the view of the Swiss and Austrian Alps in the background.\n\nLake Constance — or Bodensee as it is known to its bordering countries of Switzerland, Austria and Germany — is unique politically because there are no borders on the lake. Its management is shared equally by Switzerland, Austria and Germany, a situation that exists nowhere else in the world.\n\nTechnically, this means that being on the water is to be in no country, kind of a strange concept.\n\nLike the lake, The Bodensee Wine Region transcends the borders of Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Though there are land borders between the three countries, the Bodensee Wine Region is also, in a sense, borderless. This is the only wine region in the world that consists of three different countries.\n\nTo learn more about Bodensee wines, I cycled the path along the lake to the medieval village of Meersburg. The two-year old Vineum Bodensee (Wine Museum) — the “house for wine, culture and history” is a sensory experience, engaging the senses of sight, sound, touch, smell and taste through the\n\ndifferent rooms with the last room being the Winomat where I tasted three wines, one from each country. In the room with the flasks for smelling the different aromas found in wine, it was fun to test and see how good I am (or not) at identifying the different aromas. Being a traveler, I loved the world of wine room and its interactive map with every county in the world where wine is made, and their wine bottles displayed on the wall.\n\nAfter the Vineum Bodensee, a slow wander through Meersburg led me past the medieval castle and the baroque Neues Schloss (new castle) in upper town, with innumerable photo opportunities of the lake and the Swiss Alps, and down to lower town, with its waterfront restaurants. At the end of the pier, I inspected the various characters on the Magic Pillar sculpture by Peter Lenk, the infamous sculptor of delightfully controversial sculptures, who is a Bodensee native and resident.\n\nFollowing up on the wine tasting at the Vineum Bodensee, I visited Weingut Kress in Uberlingen, one of the wines featured in the Wine Museum. Twenty years ago, the current owners (Kristin and Thomas Kress) purchased it and improved the quality of the wine, eventually winning many awards, including\n\nthe award of Best Wine in the World at the prestigious Lyon International Competition in 2017. On the first day, I tried (and subsequently bought) their sparkling wines and many of their whites (Muller- Thurgau, Chardonnay, Kerner, Riesling) and then decided to return another day for the reds. On that\n\nsecond visit, I told the charming and humble Kristin that it felt like my second home!\n\nThe next day, I bicycled to the town of Sipplingen to go to a rather special post office. This is a family enterprise where the postmaster also runs a gift shop at the front, which sells schnapps made by her husband. Where else can one buy homemade schnapps in a post office?\n\nNine kilometers past Sipplingen is the village of Bodman, home of Peter Lenk, where studies and copies of many of his sculptures fill his gardens. On another visit, I would be sure to go during open hours in the hopes of hearing more of the stories of the individuals featured in the sculptures, a fact appreciated by some locals and disliked by others!\n\nAnother day was a car ride to the island of Mainau, known as “the island of flowers,” which is a haven for conservation and sustainable environmental practices, under the stewardship of the family of Swedish Count Bernadotte, who still owns the island. After walking the 25 acres of flowers, including\n\nsome of the one million tulips, and taking photos of the many lake views, I visited the café, which features menu items made using Mainau’s own produce, and bought a loaf of their own bread to take home.\n\nHaving seen the vegetables from Reichenau in the outdoor market belong my window in Uberlingen, I made the hour-long drive to the “The Garden Island” of Reichenau. Though it may be famous as a World Heritage site because of the Abbey of Reichenau, I was more interested in its vegetables and fish.\n\nThere are only a few roads on the small island, making it easy to see it all. And though there are roadside stands, I was happy to know that several farmers still use the honour system, leaving their produce outside their door in bins, with a box beside it where people can just leave money in exchange\n\nfor whatever they take.\n\nFor my lunch, I stopped at Georg’s Fischerhütte, whose proprietor still catches the fish served in the restaurant. I ordered the platter of filets of zander, felchen and saibling, forellen, the most famous fish of the Bodensee.\n\nÜberlingen itself is the jewel of the “German Riviera” with its beautiful, flowered waterfront and its path, its spa and health benefits, and its quality of life and being. I was lucky to be there for the annual tradition of the Schwertletanze, the Sword Dance, whose roots are verified back to 1646. It is tied to Fassnacht, another proud tradition of Uberlingen which takes places at Carneval, a good reason to return in March!\n\nAnd after daily excursions to the other sites of Bodensee (Lake Constance), it was lovely to end each day with a glass of Kress wine, sitting on the steps of the ferry plaza and watching the sunset over the lake."
