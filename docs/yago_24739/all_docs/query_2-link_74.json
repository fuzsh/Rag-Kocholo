        "text": "I am delighted to share a selection of wedding photos from Anthony & Corinna’s Lake Constance wedding. Anthony and I met when I worked in Australia 7 years ago. I have always kept in touch with him since leaving and I was delighted when he messaged me asking if I would photograph his wedding at Lake Constance.\n\nI headed out from Manchester and spent the first night at Oktoberfest in Munich with the groom and his good friends who had made the trip from Australia, USA and Amsterdam. I think that proves how much of a top couple Anthony and Corinna are.\n\nI then drove through Germany and across the border into Austria and Lake Constance. The Sentido Seehotel AM Kaiserstrand sits right on the water on Lake Constance with stunning panoramic views over the foothills of the Swiss Alps and the southern German lakeside region – a truly stunning venue for a wedding.\n\nOutdoor Ceremony looking out to Lake Constance\n\nThe weather was beautiful for this wedding and the bride and groom wanted to get married outside. The bride was wearing a dress from Honeymoon Brautmoden and had her make up done by Marina Bohler. The groom prep was fun filled with a pre wedding tequila and plenty of drinks. The groom was wearing a custom made suit from Xuits, Germany. After a short while it was time for the ceremony where their good friend Marvin conducted the intimate and heartfelt service. Which was full of tears, laughter and alcohol – perfect for any wedding.\n\nA boat cruise on Lake Constance for reception drinks\n\nAfter the ceremony the guests were treated to reception drinks on a boat on Lake Constance, along with pretzels and Pimms this was perfect for everyone to catch up and spend time together celebrating the marriage of the lovely bride and groom.\n\nBefore long it was time for speeches, these were back at the Seehotel looking out over Lake Constance. Anthony had three best men and they all gave great speeches about different parts of his life.\n\nParty on Lake Constance\n\nThe Seehotel is a fantastic venue on Lake Constance and for the evening party we headed to the building that is literally on the water. Before long everyone was having a great time with plenty of alcohol and dancing. Just after first dance it was time for me to join in with the celebrations. The whole day was fantastic and I am so grateful to be a Lake Constance wedding photographer. Thank you Anthony and Corinna and all your friends and family who made the trip to Lake Constance to celebrate this wedding.\n\nNatural, relaxed & unobtrusive wedding photography at Lake Constance"
