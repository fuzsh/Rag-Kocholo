        "text": "Sigismund III Vasa (Polish: Zygmunt III Waza, Lithuanian: Žygimantas Vaza; 20 June 1566 – 30 April 1632) was King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1587 to 1632 and, as Sigismund, King of Sweden and Grand Duke of Finland from 1592 to 1599. He was the first Polish sovereign from the House of Vasa. Religiously zealous, he imposed Roman Catholicism across the vast realm, and his crusades against neighbouring states marked Poland's largest territorial expansion. As an enlightened despot, he presided over an era of prosperity and achievement, further distinguished by the transfer of the country's capital from Kraków to Warsaw.\n\nMore information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigismund_III_Vasa\n\nKing of Poland\n\nGrand Duke of Lithuania:\n\nReign: 19 August 1587 – 30 April 1632\n\nCoronation: 27 December 1587\n\nPredecessor: Anna Jagiellon and Stephen Báthory\n\nSuccessor: Władysław IV\n\nKing of Sweden\n\nGrand Duke of Finland:\n\nReign: 17 November 1592 – 24 July 1598\n\nCoronation: 19 February 1594\n\nPredecessor: John III\n\nSuccessor: Charles IX\n\nBorn: 20 June 1566.
