Following Marie Louise's death the Duchy passed to Carlos II (Duke of Lucca)Carlos II (Duke of Lucca) whose grandfather Ferdinand had been Duke of Parma before it was overrun by France in 1796.\n\nAn interesting article on the \"Royal Romance\" of Marie Louise with her first husband Emperor Napoléon I, her second husband Adam Adalbert von Neipperg and her third husband Count Charles de Bombelles 19.2 Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria 1791 1847 Count Adam Adalbert von Neipperg 1775 1829 Adam Adalbert was firstly married to Countess Theresia von Pola and their first born son Count Alfred von Neipperg (1807-1865) was married to Princess Marie of Württemberg. Their fourth born son Count Erwin Franz von Neipperg (1813-1897) was a great grandfather to Count Joseph Hubert von Neipperg.\n\nAdam Adalbert was promoted to the rank of General in the Austrian Army and was in the forefront of defeating the French. He lost an eye from a sabre wielded by a Frenchman at the Battle of Neerinden in 1793.\n\nThe children of Marie Louise and Adam Adalbert were born before their marriage and were given the name \"Montenuovo\".\n\nAn interesting article on the \"Royal Romance\" of Marie Louise with her first husband Emperor Napoléon I , her second husband Adam Adalbert von Neipperg and her third husband Count Charles de Bombelles. 19.2 Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria 1791 1847 Count Charles de Bombelles 1785 1856 An interesting article on the \"Royal Romance\" of Marie Louise with her first husband Emperor Napoléon I , her second husband Adam Adalbert von Neipperg and her third husband Count Charles de Bombelles. 19.21 Emperor Napoléon II of the French 1811 1832 Napoléon was created Duke von Reichstadt on 22 July 1818 by his grandfather Emperor Franz I of Austria\n\nA long article on the Duke von Reichstadt 19.22 Countess Albertina von Neipperg 1817 1867 Conte Luigi di Santivale 1799 1876 19.23 Count Wilhelm Albrecht von Neipperg (1st Fürst von Montenuovo) 1819 1895 Countess Juliana Batthyány de Nemet-Ujvár 1827 1871 Wilhelm Albrecht was created Count Montenuovo by his grandfather Emperor Franz 1 of Austria and Fürst (i.e. Prince) von Montenuovo by his cousin Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria on 20 August 1864.\n\nAn interesting article on Wilhelm Albrecht, it mentions Wilhelm Albrecht was born two days after the marriage of his father Count Adam Adalbert von Neipperg to Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria. Unfortunately, various sources show dates which don't accord with the statement in the article.\n\nThe article above mentions Wilhelm Albrecht became mentally unbalanced after the death of his wife and became a patient in what was stated to be the most famous insane asylum or sanatorium in the world at Doebling.\n\nAs an aside this is the same asylum that Princess Louise of Belgium (wife of Prince Philip of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) was first incarcerated as a result of her love affair with Géza Mattachich. 19.231 Princess Albertine von Montenuovo 1853 1895 Count Zygmunt Wielopolski 1833 1902 19.232 Prince Alfred Adam von Montenuovo (2nd Fürst von Montenuovo) 1854 1927 Countess Franziska Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau 1861 1935 Prince Alfred von Montenuovo was appointed first Obersthofmeister (equates to Lord High Steward or High Court Chamberlain) of the Imperial Court in 1909 and as such was head of the imperial court and household. In this role he was responsible for the funeral arrangements of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Este and his wife Duchess Sophia von Hohenberg following their assassination in 1914. Because of the morganatic nature of their marriage royal personages from other countries were not invited to the funeral which at the time caused heavy criticism of Prince Alfred von Montenuovo. 19.2321 Princess Juliane von Montenuovo 1880 1961 Count Dionys Draskovich von Trakostjan 1875 1909 19.2321 Princess Juliane von Montenuovo 1880 1961 Prince Karl zu Oettingen-Oettingen und Oettingen-Wallerstein 1877 1930 19.23211 Countess Maria Draskovich von Trakostjan 1904 1969 Duke Albrecht of Bavaria 1905 1996 See 18.15113 19.2322 Princess Marie von Montenuovo 1881 1954 Count Franz von Ledebur-Wicheln 1877 1954 19.2323 Prince Ferdinand Bonaventura von Montenuovo (3rd Fürst von Montenuovo) 1888 1951 Baroness Ilona Bss Solymossy de Loós et Egervár 1895 1988 A newspaper article in 1949 said that Prince Ferdinand Bonaventura von Montenuovo was responsible for the funeral arrangements of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Este and his wife Duchess Sophia von Hohenberg following their assassination in 1914. The article goes on to say that because of the morganatic nature of the marriage of Franz Ferdinand there would be no state funeral and royal personages from other countries were not invited to the funeral. I'm reasonably confident the article is incorrect in referring to Prince Ferdinand Bonaventura as being responsible for the funeral arrangement it is more likely the arrangements was undertaken by his father Prince Alfred von Montenuovo 19.2324 Princess Franziska von Montenuovo 1893 1972 Prince Leopold von Lobkowicz 1888 1933 19.233 Princess Marie von Montenuovo 1859 1911 Count Anton Apponyi de Nagy-Appony 1852 1920 Count Anton (or Antal in some sources) was a brother to Count Ludwig Apponyi de Nagy-Appony (1849-1909) grandfather of Countess Géraldine Apponyi de Nagy-Appony ( 19152002) wife of King Zog I of Albania. 19.24 Countess Mathilde von Montenuovo 1822 1822 19.3 Emperor Ferdinand Karl of Austria 1793 1875 Princess Maria Anna of Savoy 1803 1884 See 47.26 - 1848 was a year of revolution and Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg (1800-1852) engineered the abdication of Ferdinand Karl on 2 December 1848. Felix of Schwarzenberg also induced Ferdinand Karl's brother Archduke Franz Karl the heir to the Austrian throne to forego his rights in favour of his son Franz Joseph.\n\nThe formal abdication of Ferdinand Karl and renunciation by Franz Karl to the throne of Austria and succession by Franz Joseph.\n\nSome uncomplimentary articles on Ferdinand Karl following his death. 19.4 Archduchess Marie Caroline of Austria 1794 1795 19.5 Archduchess Caroline Ludovika of Austria 1795 1799 19.6 Archduchess Marie Leopoldine of Austria 1797 1826 King Pedro IV de Alcántara of Portugal (Emperor of Brazil) 1798 1834 See 12.4 - Brazil was demanding independence from Portugal and Pedro was proclaimed Emperor of Brazil (as Pedro I) on 12 October 1822. He also succeeded to the throne of Portugal on the death of his father and as he didn't want to leave Brazil he abdicated the Portuguese throne in favour of his daughter Maria on 29 April 1826. Pedro also abdicated the Brazilian Throne on 7 April 1831 in favour of his son Pedro II in order to return to Portugal to fight for the restoration of his daughter Maria to the throne of Portugal.\n\nMarie Leopoldine died of a miscarriage having had seven previous births on an annual basis from 1819 to 1825. One newspapaer reported she died in consequence of premature accouchement.\n\nPedro IV died of tuberculosis 19.7 Archduchess Marie Clementine of Austria 1798 1881 Prince Leopoldo of Bourbon-Two Sicilies 1790 1851 See 37.O 19.8 Archduke Joseph Franz of Austria 1799 1807 19.9 Archduchess Marie Caroline of Austria 1801 1832 King Friedrich August II of Saxony 1797 1854 See 26.63 - Friedrich August died from a carriage accident. His carriage overturned at Brenbuchel, situated between Munich and Dresden resulting in him being thrown out onto the road and one of the horses kicked him in the head. 19.J Archduke Franz Karl of Austria 1802 1878 Princess Sophie of Bavaria 1805 1872 See 18.9 - 1848 was a year of revolution and Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg (1800-1852) engineered the abdication of Franz Karl's brother Emperor Ferdinand Karl of Austria on 2 December 1848. Felix of Schwarzenberg also induced Franz Karl who was the heir to the Austrian throne to forego his rights in favour of his son Franz Joseph. 19.J1 Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria 1830 1916 Duchess Elizabeth \"Sisi\" in Bavaria 1837 1898 See 18.K4 - Franz Joseph succeeded his uncle Ferdinand (who had been forced to abdicate) as Emperor of Austria in 1848.\n\nElizabeth was assassinated in Geneva by an Italian anarchist, Luigi Luccheni, who stabbed her with a shoemaker's file (some sources mentions it was a knife). Luigi was given a life sentence for the murder and committed suicide in his prison cell in 1910.\n\nNewspaper articles in 1903 were reporting on the extreme conditions in which Luigi Luccheni was being held and speculated (rightly as it turned out) that he would become a raving maniac.\n\nA report on the wedding of Franz Joseph and Elizabeth 19.J11 Archduchess Sophie of Austria 1855 1857 19.J12 Archduchess Gisela of Austria 1856 1932 Prince Leopold of Bavaria 1846 1930 See 18.152 19.J13 Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria 1858 1889 Princess Stephanie of Belgium 1864 1945 See 14.23 - Crown Prince Rudolph committed suicide after killing his eighteen year old mistress Baroness Maria Vetsera in Mayerling.\n\nThere were newspaper reports in 1953/1954 of court actions taken by an individual Robert Pachmann.\n\nPachmann took his case to the Vienna Court in 1953 claiming that he was the son of Crown Prince Rudolph and Maria Antonietta of Austria (Tuscany Line) who he reckoned were secretly married on New Years day 1880 before Rudolph's \"official\" wedding in May 1881 to Princess Stephanie of Belgium.\n\nPachmann also claimed that Rudolf continued to visit Maria Antonietta on the French Riviera after his marriage to Stephanie and it was there in 1883 that she gave birth to Robert and she died a few months.\n\nPachmann told the court that as a baby he was secretly brought to Vienna and cared for by Heinrich and Mare Pachmann, who substituted him for their own son who had died.\n\nAlthough Pachmann said he had \"complete documentary proof\" that he was the only legitimate son of Rudolf , in late 1954 the appeals court upheld a previous verdict that the case be rejected for lack of proof.\n\nA report on the marriage of Rudolph and Stephanie . 19.J131 Archduchess Elisabeth \"Erzsi\" of Austria 1883 1963 Prince Otto of Windisch-Graetz 1873 1952 Otto was a younger brother to Prince Karl of Windisch-Graetz.\n\nOtto's grandfather Weriand (1790-1867) was created Fürst zu Windisch-Graetz (Line II) on 18 May 1822. Weriand's elder brother Alfred (1787-1862) having been created Fürst zu Windisch-Graetz (Line I) on 24 May 1804.\n\nElisabeth had to renounce her succession rights to the Austria throne in order to be given permission to marry Otto.\n\nA report on the wedding of Elisabeth and Otto.\n\nIt was alleged in 1903 that Elisabeth had found her husband Otto alone with a Czech actress and shot and killed the actress's butler and then did the same to the actress. However in 1933 it was reported the actress Marie Zieglerova was still alive after having been shot through the lung by Elisabeth some thirty years earlier.\n\nOtto filed for divorce in 1919 on account of her succession of affairs apparently with navel officers. 19.J131 Archduchess Elisabeth \"Erzsi\" of Austria 1883 1963 Leopold Petznek 1881 1956 Archduchess Elisabeth was known as the Red Archduchess on marrying Leopold Petznek who was a leftist politician.\n\nIt was reported in 1927 that Elisabeth and Leopold Petznek had married three years earlier although all sources I have come across shows they married in 1948.\n\nA short newspaper article in 1929 on Elisabeth and two of her children Prince Ernst of Windisch-Graetz and Prince Rudolph of Windisch-Graetz. The article however refers to Elisabeth as a niece of Emperor Franz Joseph whereas she is in fact his granddaughter. 19.J1311 Prince Franz Joseph of Windisch-Graetz 1904 1981 Countess Ghislaine d'Arschot Schoonhoven 1912 1997 19.J13111 Princess Stephanie of Windisch-Graetz 1939 2019 Dermot Blundell-Hollinshead-Blundell 1935 2009 Stephanie was an artist and the Web Site illustrating her work can be found here.

She spent the remaining 60 years after the death of her husband locked up a chateau outside Brussels.\n\nFor a treatise on Mexican Monarchy please click here.\n\nMexico was ruled by Spain from early 1500 until Mexico obtained its independence in 1821.

Franz Ferdinand formally renounced the rights of succession of his descendants on 28 June 1900 and he and Sophie were married on 1 July 1900.\n\nAs a consequence of her morganatic marriage Sophie suffered the indignity by court etiquette of not being able to be at the side of her husband at formal court occasionsf.\n\nFranz Ferdinand and Countess Sophia were assassinated at Sarajera by a Serbian student Gavrilo Princip who was a member of the Bosnian nationalist movement.\n\nGavrilo Princip along with his accomplices were tried in October 1914 and five were sentenced to death. Gavrilo escaped the death penalty as he was just under 20 years of age when he committed the crime and instead was sentenced to the maximum of 20 years in jail.
