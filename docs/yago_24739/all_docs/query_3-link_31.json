        "text": "Scene ⌜4⌝\n\nSynopsis:\n\nJohn’s victories and his capture of Arthur lead the French to despair and Constance to wild grief. Pandulph, predicting Arthur’s death and the hatred of John that will inevitably ensue, encourages the Dauphin to invade England and claim the throne as Blanche’s husband.\n\nEnter ⌜King Philip of⌝ France,⌜Louis the⌝ Dauphin,\n\nPandulph, Attendants.\n\nKING PHILIP\n\n1367 So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,\n\n1368 A whole armada of convicted sail\n\n1369 Is scattered and disjoined from fellowship.\n\nPANDULPH\n\n1370 Courage and comfort. All shall yet go well.\n\nKING PHILIP\n\n1371 5 What can go well when we have run so ill?\n\n1372 Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?\n\n1373 Arthur ta’en prisoner? Divers dear friends slain?\n\n1374 And bloody England into England gone,\n\n1375 O’erbearing interruption, spite of France?\n\nDAUPHIN\n\n1376 10 What he hath won, that hath he fortified.\n\n1377 So hot a speed, with such advice disposed,\n\n1378 Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,\n\n1379 Doth want example. Who hath read or heard\n\n1380 Of any kindred action like to this?\n\nKING PHILIP\n\n1381 15 Well could I bear that England had this praise,\n\n1382 So we could find some pattern of our shame.\n\nEnter Constance, ⌜with her hair unbound.⌝\n\np. 111\n\n1383 Look who comes here! A grave unto a soul,\n\n1384 Holding th’ eternal spirit against her will\n\n1385 In the vile prison of afflicted breath.—\n\n1386 20 I prithee, lady, go away with me.\n\nCONSTANCE\n\n1387 Lo, now, now see the issue of your peace!\n\nKING PHILIP\n\n1388 Patience, good lady. Comfort, gentle Constance.\n\nCONSTANCE\n\n1389 No, I defy all counsel, all redress,\n\n1390 But that which ends all counsel, true redress.\n\n1391 25 Death, death, O amiable, lovely death,\n\n1392 Thou odoriferous stench, sound rottenness,\n\n1393 Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,\n\n1394 Thou hate and terror to prosperity,\n\n1395 And I will kiss thy detestable bones\n\n1396 30 And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows,\n\n1397 And ring these fingers with thy household worms,\n\n1398 And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust,\n\n1399 And be a carrion monster like thyself.\n\n1400 Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smil’st,\n\n1401 35 And buss thee as thy wife. Misery’s love,\n\n1402 O, come to me!\n\nKING PHILIP 1403 O fair affliction, peace!\n\nCONSTANCE\n\n1404 No, no, I will not, having breath to cry.\n\n1405 O, that my tongue were in the thunder’s mouth!\n\n1406 40 Then with a passion would I shake the world\n\n1407 And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy\n\n1408 Which cannot hear a lady’s feeble voice,\n\n1409 Which scorns a modern invocation.\n\nPANDULPH\n\n1410 Lady, you utter madness and not sorrow.\n\nCONSTANCE\n\n1411 45 Thou art ⌜not⌝ holy to belie me so.\n\n1412 I am not mad. This hair I tear is mine;\n\np. 113\n\n1413 My name is Constance; I was Geoffrey’s wife;\n\n1414 Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost.\n\n1415 I am not mad; I would to heaven I were,\n\n1416 50 For then ’tis like I should forget myself.\n\n1417 O, if I could, what grief should I forget!\n\n1418 Preach some philosophy to make me mad,\n\n1419 And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal.\n\n1420 For, being not mad but sensible of grief,\n\n1421 55 My reasonable part produces reason\n\n1422 How I may be delivered of these woes,\n\n1423 And teaches me to kill or hang myself.\n\n1424 If I were mad, I should forget my son,\n\n1425 Or madly think a babe of clouts were he.\n\n1426 60 I am not mad. Too well, too well I feel\n\n1427 The different plague of each calamity.\n\nKING PHILIP\n\n1428 Bind up those tresses.—O, what love I note\n\n1429 In the fair multitude of those her hairs;\n\n1430 Where but by chance a silver drop hath fall’n,\n\n1431 65 Even to that drop ten thousand wiry ⌜friends⌝\n\n1432 Do glue themselves in sociable grief,\n\n1433 Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,\n\n1434 Sticking together in calamity.\n\nCONSTANCE\n\n1435 To England, if you will.\n\nKING PHILIP 1436 70 Bind up your hairs.\n\nCONSTANCE\n\n1437 Yes, that I will. And wherefore will I do it?\n\n1438 I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud\n\n1439 “O, that these hands could so redeem my son,\n\n1440 As they have given these hairs their liberty!”\n\n1441 75 But now I envy at their liberty,\n\n1442 And will again commit them to their bonds,\n\n1443 Because my poor child is a prisoner.\n\n⌜She binds up her hair.⌝\n\np. 115\n\n1444 And father cardinal, I have heard you say\n\n1445 That we shall see and know our friends in heaven.\n\n1446 80 If that be true, I shall see my boy again;\n\n1447 For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,\n\n1448 To him that did but yesterday suspire,\n\n1449 There was not such a gracious creature born.\n\n1450 But now will canker sorrow eat my bud\n\n1451 85 And chase the native beauty from his cheek,\n\n1452 And he will look as hollow as a ghost,\n\n1453 As dim and meager as an ague’s fit,\n\n1454 And so he’ll die; and, rising so again,\n\n1455 When I shall meet him in the court of heaven\n\n1456 90 I shall not know him. Therefore never, never\n\n1457 Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.\n\nPANDULPH\n\n1458 You hold too heinous a respect of grief.\n\nCONSTANCE\n\n1459 He talks to me that never had a son.\n\nKING PHILIP\n\n1460 You are as fond of grief as of your child.\n\nCONSTANCE\n\n1461 95 Grief fills the room up of my absent child,\n\n1462 Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,\n\n1463 Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,\n\n1464 Remembers me of all his gracious parts,\n\n1465 Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;\n\n1466 100 Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?\n\n1467 Fare you well. Had you such a loss as I,\n\n1468 I could give better comfort than you do.\n\n⌜She unbinds her hair.⌝\n\n1469 I will not keep this form upon my head\n\n1470 When there is such disorder in my wit.\n\n1471 105 O Lord! My boy, my Arthur, my fair son,\n\n1472 My life, my joy, my food, my all the world,\n\n1473 My widow-comfort and my sorrows’ cure!She exits.\n\np. 117\n\nKING PHILIP\n\n1474 I fear some outrage, and I’ll follow her.\n\nHe exits, ⌜with Attendants.⌝\n\nDAUPHIN\n\n1475 There’s nothing in this world can make me joy.\n\n1476 110 Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale,\n\n1477 Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;\n\n1478 And bitter shame hath spoiled the sweet ⌜world’s⌝\n\n1479 taste,\n\n1480 That it yields naught but shame and bitterness.\n\nPANDULPH\n\n1481 115 Before the curing of a strong disease,\n\n1482 Even in the instant of repair and health,\n\n1483 The fit is strongest. Evils that take leave\n\n1484 On their departure most of all show evil.\n\n1485 What have you lost by losing of this day?\n\nDAUPHIN\n\n1486 120 All days of glory, joy, and happiness.\n\nPANDULPH\n\n1487 If you had won it, certainly you had.\n\n1488 No, no. When Fortune means to men most good,\n\n1489 She looks upon them with a threat’ning eye.\n\n1490 ’Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost\n\n1491 125 In this which he accounts so clearly won.\n\n1492 Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?\n\nDAUPHIN\n\n1493 As heartily as he is glad he hath him.\n\nPANDULPH\n\n1494 Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.\n\n1495 Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit.\n\n1496 130 For even the breath of what I mean to speak\n\n1497 Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,\n\n1498 Out of the path which shall directly lead\n\n1499 Thy foot to England’s throne. And therefore mark:\n\n1500 John hath seized Arthur, and it cannot be\n\n1501 135 That, whiles warm life plays in that infant’s veins,\n\np. 119\n\n1502 The misplaced John should entertain an hour,\n\n1503 One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.\n\n1504 A scepter snatched with an unruly hand\n\n1505 Must be as boisterously maintained as gained.\n\n1506 140 And he that stands upon a slipp’ry place\n\n1507 Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up.\n\n1508 That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall.\n\n1509 So be it, for it cannot be but so.\n\nDAUPHIN\n\n1510 But what shall I gain by young Arthur’s fall?\n\nPANDULPH\n\n1511 145 You, in the right of Lady Blanche your wife,\n\n1512 May then make all the claim that Arthur did.\n\nDAUPHIN\n\n1513 And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.\n\nPANDULPH\n\n1514 How green you are and fresh in this old world!\n\n1515 John lays you plots. The times conspire with you,\n\n1516 150 For he that steeps his safety in true blood\n\n1517 Shall find but bloody safety, and untrue.\n\n1518 This act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts\n\n1519 Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,\n\n1520 That none so small advantage shall step forth\n\n1521 155 To check his reign but they will cherish it.\n\n1522 No natural exhalation in the sky,\n\n1523 No scope of nature, no distempered day,\n\n1524 No common wind, no customèd event,\n\n1525 But they will pluck away his natural cause\n\n1526 160 And call them meteors, prodigies, and signs,\n\n1527 Abortives, presages, and tongues of heaven,\n\n1528 Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.\n\nDAUPHIN\n\n1529 Maybe he will not touch young Arthur’s life,\n\n1530 But hold himself safe in his prisonment.\n\nPANDULPH\n\n1531 165 O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,\n\np. 121\n\n1532 If that young Arthur be not gone already,\n\n1533 Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts\n\n1534 Of all his people shall revolt from him\n\n1535 And kiss the lips of unacquainted change,\n\n1536 170 And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath\n\n1537 Out of the bloody fingers’ ends of John.\n\n1538 Methinks I see this hurly all on foot;\n\n1539 And, O, what better matter breeds for you\n\n1540 Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge\n\n1541 175 Is now in England ransacking the Church,\n\n1542 Offending charity. If but a dozen French\n\n1543 Were there in arms, they would be as a call\n\n1544 To train ten thousand English to their side,\n\n1545 Or as a little snow, tumbled about,\n\n1546 180 Anon becomes a mountain. O noble dauphin,\n\n1547 Go with me to the King. ’Tis wonderful\n\n1548 What may be wrought out of their discontent,\n\n1549 Now that their souls are topful of offense.\n\n1550 For England, go. I will whet on the King.\n\nDAUPHIN\n\n1551 185 Strong reasons makes strange actions. Let us go.\n\n1552 If you say ay, the King will not say no.\n\nThey exit."
