        "text": "User Licenses\n\nCloud software providers like Sage Intacct commonly charge customers based on the number of users. Adding multiple users with full software access can quickly increase your annual subscription cost, so it’s important to determine who will need full and limited access to control your costs.\n\nBusiness User: Users with full, unlimited access rights to all applications. Can be restricted based on permissions assigned by an Administrator.\n\nEmployee User 10 Pack: User with limited access rights, including read-only access to the Dashboard and the ability to enter/approve expense reports, timesheets, and/or purchase requisitions.\n\nBusiness Entities\n\nYour first legal business entity is included with the core financial management bundle. A business entity is defined as an independent set of balanced accounting books with tax reporting capabilities.\n\nWhile additional legal entities cost an extra fee, the annual subscription cost is minimal compared to the functionality it provides for multi-entity businesses. Organizations with large numbers of entities, or entities with limited transaction volumes, have options for special pricing. Sage Intacct makes managing financials for multiple entities, locations, and currencies easy.\n\n→Visit our demo center to see these features and modules in action.←\n\nImplementation Cost\n\nHow much can you expect to spend on a Sage Intacct implementation? For every $1.00 you spend on your Sage Intacct annual subscription, you can expect to pay $1.00 – $1.5 on your Sage Intacct Implementation with Cargas. So, if an average annual software subscription starts at $15,000, you can expect to spend $15,000 – $22,500 for your implementation cost.\n\nWhat affects the range of the implementation cost? The extent to which you’re integrating or customizing the solutions, the system you’re migrating from, and the state of your GL and data will determine if you are at the low or high end of the implementation range.\n\nWith Cargas as your software partner, the average Sage Intacct implementation takes about 90 days, or three months, to complete. Cargas has developed a tried-and-true, six-step process for quick and successful implementations.\n\nDiscover the intricacies of Sage Intacct pricing and delve into the details of our six-step implementation process by exploring our blog.\n\nPartner Solutions & Integrations\n\nYou may want to pair third-party tools with Sage Intacct to enhance the power of your accounting solution. Customers have some flexibility to control the costs of partner solutions and integrations. To start Sage Intacct quickly, you can wait to invest in partner solutions, integrations, and modules. Still, it’s important to factor these add-ons into your Sage Intacct budget for long-term planning.\n\nOur Top Sage Intacct Integrations article highlights fourteen of the best add-ons that save time and boost productivity.\n\nOngoing Costs\n\nBecause Sage Intacct is a cloud-based software, it uses a subscription model for pricing. Rather than paying for the software outright, companies pay a monthly fee based on required modules and users. Software and service costs may change over time, but any increase in price goes towards evolving the software. Sage Intacct receives four significant updates yearly, so the solution is constantly innovating.\n\nThe Sage Intacct subscription cost includes:\n\n24/7 operations, upgrades, and enhancements\n\nAward-winning US-based support\n\n15GB of storage (5GB of data/transaction storage and 10GB of file storage)\n\nCompanies should also budget for expanded support and ongoing training, education, and other professional services. As Sage Intacct evolves and businesses invest in new technology, team members must learn the ropes and keep their product knowledge fresh.\n\nWhether companies want to invest in a care plan for additional support or attend educational events like Sage Transform, it’s important to consider all additional costs when budgeting for Sage Intacct."
