        "text": "This is Information Sheet 61 (INFO 161). It details how to register a company with us and the things you need to keep in mind.\n\nStep 1 - Is a company right for you?\n\nStep 2 - Choosing a company name\n\nStep 3 - How will your company operate?\n\nStep 4 - Understand your obligations as a company officeholder\n\nStep 5 - Get consent from officeholders, members and occupiers\n\nStep 6 - Registering your company\n\nStep 7 - After your company is registered...\n\nStep 1 - Is a company right for you?\n\nYou need to decide if a company suits your needs or if you should use a different business structure. Business.gov.au has a great 'Help me decide' tool that can help you work out the business structure that will best suit your needs and what registrations you should consider.\n\nA company is its own legal entity and lets you conduct business throughout Australia. You can also make use of other privileges, such as corporate tax rates or limited liability.\n\nRegistering a company is different to registering a business name. For more information, see your business structure.\n\nYou can also register different types of companies, including:\n\nnot for profit or charitable organisations,\n\nregistrable Australian bodies,\n\nspecial purpose companies, or\n\ncorporate collective investment vehicles (CCIV)\n\nStep 2 - Choosing a company name\n\nThere are a few things you should consider when choosing a company name.\n\nA company's name cannot be identical to an existing name\n\nYou can only use a name that is not identical to an existing company or business name. Use our check name availability search to see if the name you want is available.\n\nIf you are the holder of an identical name, you may be able to register the name for the company in some cases:\n\nBefore May 2012, it was possible for multiple businesses with the same name to exist as long as they were registered in different states and territories. This is no longer possible under ASIC's national register. You won't be able to register a company name if an identical name already exists.\n\nYou can only use certain characters in a company's name\n\nThe following characters are accepted:\n\nCharacters\n\nCharacters\n\nCharacters\n\nCharacters\n\n0-9\n\n$\n\nspace\n\n:\n\nA-Z\n\n%\n\n.\n\n;\n\na-z\n\n*\n\n,\n\n\" \"\n\n@\n\n&\n\n?\n\n'\n\n#\n\n=\n\n!\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n_\n\n-\n\n|\n\n()\n\n{}\n\nSome terms are restricted\n\nSome words and phrases cannot be used without the approval of a government minister. Some examples include:\n\n'bank'\n\n'trust'\n\n'Royal'\n\n'Incorporated'\n\nYou can't use words that could mislead people about a company's activities. This includes associations with Australian government, the Royal Family, or any ex-servicemen's organisations.\n\nWe may also refuse a name if it's considered offensive or suggests illegal activity. See company name availability to learn more about company names and restricted words.\n\nReserving a company name\n\nIf you aren't ready to register your company but want to make sure a name is available, you can apply to reserve it (Form 410).\n\nIf we approve your application, we will reserve the name for two months. If you wish to extend this period, you'll need to apply to reserve the name again.\n\nWe will not reserve a name for a long period as this prevents other people from using the name to conduct business.\n\nCheck existing trademarks or names\n\nEven if we reserve or register a name for you, a company with a similar trademark or name may take action against you. It is your responsibility to be aware of any similar names or trademarks that may affect your name. Visit the IP Australia website to search for existing trademarks.\n\nA company's name must show its legal status\n\nA company must show the liability of its members and status in its name. For example:\n\nif a company's members' liability is limited to the amount unpaid on their shares, the name must end with 'Proprietary Limited'\n\nif the members' liability is unlimited, the company name must end with 'Proprietary'.\n\nBelow is a list of approved abbreviations that can be used in a company's name:\n\nFull word\n\nAbbreviation\n\nand\n\n&\n\nAustralian Business Number\n\nABN\n\nCompany\n\nCo\n\nCoy\n\nNo Liability\n\nNL\n\nAustralian\n\nAust\n\nAustralian Company Number\n\nACN\n\nLimited\n\nLtd\n\nNumber\n\nNo\n\nProprietary\n\nPty\n\nTo display a different name, you can register it as a business name. For example, Apples Pty Ltd. can register 'The Apple Fruit Store' as a business name. This means it can trade as 'The Apple Fruit Store' and display it on all its signage.\n\nStep 3 - How will your company operate?\n\nBefore registering, you will need to decide how your company will be governed. Your company can be governed by:\n\nreplaceable rules\n\nits own constitution, or\n\na combination of both.\n\nReplaceable rules\n\nReplaceable rules are in the Corporations Act and are a basic set of rules for managing your company. If a company doesn't want to have a constitution, they can use the replaceable rules instead.\n\nUsing replaceable rules means your company does not need a written constitution. This means you don't have the expense of keeping it updated as the law changes.\n\nConstitution\n\nA company can also have a written constitution instead of using replaceable rules. Companies must keep a copy of their constitution with their company's records. See constitution and replaceable rules for more information.\n\nSpecial rules for sole director/member proprietary companies\n\nIf a proprietary company has just one officeholder, they don't need to follow replaceable rules or have a constitution. If another director/member is appointed, then replaceable rules automatically apply to the company. This can be changed to a constitution at a later date.\n\nShare structure\n\nA proprietary company must have no more than 50 non-employee shareholders and be either:\n\nlimited by shares, or\n\nbe an unlimited company that has share capital.\n\nA proprietary company must not conduct any activity that requires disclosure to investors. They may only offer shares to members of the company or employees/subsidiaries of the company.\n\nStep 4 - Understand your obligations as an officeholder\n\nIf you're an officeholder of a company, you must follow the requirements in the Corporations Act. This includes meeting your legal obligations , which includes:\n\nensuring company details are kept up to date\n\nmaintaining company records and details on the register\n\npaying the appropriate lodgement fees and annual review fees as required.\n\nOfficeholders are ultimately responsible for a company's adherence to the Corporations Act.\n\nSee your company and the law for more information.\n\nCompany directors are required by law to apply for a director identification number (director ID). Once you have a director ID, it will be unique to you forever.\n\nFind out more at our Director identification number page.\n\nStep 5 - Get consent from officeholders, members and occupiers\n\nYou must get written consent from the people that will fill these roles:\n\nDirector (must be over 18)\n\nSecretary (must be over 18)\n\nMember (every company must have at least one member).\n\nAt least one director and secretary of a proprietary company must ordinarily reside in Australia.\n\nAt least two directors of a public company must ordinarily reside in Australia.\n\nGet the consent of the owner of your registered office address\n\nIf your registered office does not belong to the company (e.g. it's your accountant's office), you must get their written permission to use the address.\n\nYou don't have to send copies of your written consent to us, but you do need to keep these with your records. You must also set up a register to record details of the members of your company.\n\nStep 6 - Registering your company\n\nAustralian Government Business Registration Service\n\nYou can register a company using the Australian Government's Business Registration Service (BRS). BRS combines several business and tax registrations in one place, making it even easier to start a business.\n\nRegister your company online\n\nContact a private service provider (PSP)\n\nYou can choose to register a company through a private service provider (PSP). This could be your accountant, your solicitor, or another business that provides online services with ASIC. They will usually charge a fee for their services above what ASIC would charge.\n\nFind out more about private service providers.\n\nOnline exceptions\n\nSome company types are unavailable to register online, including:\n\na company with unlimited liability,\n\na company with the individual share value more than four decimal places (e.g. 0.00042),\n\na company limited by shares that is registering as a CCIV,\n\na company that requires lodgement of a Form 207Z Certification of compliance with stamp duty law, 208 Notification of details of shares issued other than for cash or 379 Request to suppress residential address or change residential and/or alternative address,\n\na public company, with the Australian Company Number (ACN) as the company name and where the company is ruled by a constitution,\n\nwhere a company officeholder place of birth causes an error,\n\nwhere a company address is not accepted by ASIC, and/or\n\nwhere an applicant is facing other extenuating circumstances.\n\nIf you wish to register one of the above company types, you need to request to register via paper.\n\nHow to submit a request to register via paper\n\nIf you believe you meet the above criteria, please send us an online enquiry and include the following details:\n\nyour proposed company name and type,\n\nthe exception applicable to your registration,\n\nyour transaction reference number (if known), and\n\nany error message you received (if known).\n\nWe'll consider your request and where appropriate, send you a copy of the form.\n\nOnce we've processed your application\n\nOnce we've processed your application, we will:\n\ngive the company an ACN (which you can use to apply for an ABN)\n\nregister the company, and\n\nsend you a certificate of registration.\n\nWe'll also send you a corporate key, which is a unique number for your company. You will need your corporate key to create an account online and update your details.\n\nStep 7 - After your company is registered...\n\nAfter your company is registered, make sure:\n\nthe company's name is on display wherever the company conducts business and is open to the public\n\nthe company's ACN/ABN is displayed on any documents the company publishes\n\nthe company's details are kept up to date\n\nRelated links\n\nChecklist for registering a company\n\nRunning a company\n\nChanges to your company\n\nClosing your company\n\nDirector identification number\n\nImportant notice\n\nPlease note that this information sheet is a summary giving you basic information about a particular topic.
