INTERNATIONAL VALUE ADDED RESELLER AGREEMENT Agreement #: ------------------------ Effective Date: Jan. 12, 2000 ------------------------ THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into effect as of the date shown above, by and between Selectica, Inc. (\"SELECTICA\"), with its principal offices at 2880 Zanker Road, Suite 101, San Jose, CA 95134. and Company (\"VAR\"): SAMSUNG SDS CO., LTD. ---------------------------------------- with its principal offices located at 707-19 Yoksam-Dong, Kangnam-Go ---------------------------------------- Seoul, Korea, 135-080 ---------------------------------------- Telephone Number: 82-2-3429-3425 ---------------------------------------- Fax Number: 82-2-3429-411 ---------------------------------------- Company Contact Name: Weon K. Lee ---------------------------------------- Company Contact Email Address: Lwk@samsung.co.kr ---------------------------------------- RECITALS The parties to this Agreement wish to enter into a non-exclusive, non-transferable agreement pursuant to which VAR will purchase and/or market certain of the proprietary Products (\"the Products\") developed and manufactured by SELECTICA. Therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions contained in this Agreement, SELECTICA and VAR agree as follows: 1. APPOINTMENT 1.1 SELECTICA appoints VAR, and VAR accepts appointment as an authorized, non-exclusive Value Added Reseller of the Products listed on EXHIBIT B hereto (the \"Products\"). This appointment authorizes VAR to distribute Products directly to end-user customers only within the Territory. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Territory\" shall mean Korea. VAR must obtain prior written consent from Selectica for any distribution outside of the Territory. VAR can recommend resellers in Korea to resell Selectica products. Selectica may approve a reseller if it meets certain criteria (e.g., such potential resellers do not represent competitive products/companies and have the expertise to resell and support Selectica products). If Selectica approves such reseller, VAR may execute a reseller agreement directly with the reseller with terms and conditions no less restrictive than those contained in this Agreement. VAR may not execute any reseller agreements with any reseller not previously approved in writing by Selectica. 1.2 Although SELECTICA may, from time to time, publish suggested list prices of the Products, VAR has the right to determine its own resale prices unilaterally. No SELECTICA representative has any authority to require VAR to charge a particular resale price for the Products or to otherwise inhibit VAR's pricing discretion. VAR will promptly report any attempt to do so to SELECTICA's management in writing. 1.3 SELECTICA reserves the right, during the term of this Agreement and thereafter, to market products that are the same as or similar to those products that are the subject of this Agreement, in the same geographical areas serviced by VAR, either directly or indirectly through independent agents, dealers, developers, distributors, value added resellers, system integrators and Original Equipment Manufacturers' without obligation or liability to VAR. 2. LICENSE GRANT As part of the appointment under Section 1.1, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Selectica grants VAR (i) a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use and distribute internally the Products for internal testing and development purposes and for demonstration and support of End Users (the \"End-User License\"); [*] - CERTAIN INFORMATION IN THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION. CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED WITH RESPECT TO THE OMITTED PORTIONS. <PAGE> 2 (ii) an exclusive, non-transferable license to distribute and sub-license the Products directly or indirectly through VAR's distribution channel to End Users in the Territory pursuant to the terms and conditions of an End User license agreement that contains terms and conditions substantially similar to those set forth in the End Use Agreement which is attached as Exhibit C (hereinafter the \"End User Agreement\"). 3. FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS 3.1 Products Fees. VAR shall pay Selectica, for the Products that VAR is purchasing pursuant to this Agreement the amount set forth in Exhibit B. Such fees for the purchase of the Products set forth in Exhibit B shall be non-refundable. 3.2 Internal Use License. VAR shall pay Selectica, for each of the Products that it uses or distributes for internal purposes within the scope of the rights set forth in Section 5(a)(i) of this Agreement, the amounts set forth in Exhibit G. 3.3 Payment Terms. The payments to Selectica from VAR for the Products listed on Exhibit B and the Internal Use License shall be paid upon the execution of this Agreement. 3.4 Taxes, Fees, and Documentation. VAR agrees to pay, and to indemnify and hold Selectica harmless from, any sales, use, excise, import or export, value added or similar tax, not based on Selectica's net income, as well as the collection or withholding thereof, including penalties and interest, and all government permit or license fees and all customs, duty, tariff and similar fees levied upon the delivery of the Products and other deliverables, and any costs associated with the collection of any of the foregoing items. VAR shall be responsible for obtaining, at its expense, all required import licenses, permits or other governmental orders. If a resale certificate or other certificate, document or other evidence of exemption or payment or withholding of taxes by VAR is required in order to exempt the distribution or licensing of the Products from any such liability or to enable Selectica to claim any tax exemption, credit, or other benefit, VAR will promptly furnish such certificate or document to Selectica. 4. VAR RESPONSIBILITIES In consideration for being appointed an authorized VAR of the Products, VAR assumes the following responsibilities: 4.1 Maintain a sufficient number of trained and knowledgeable sales personnel who are able to explain in detail the differences between the Products and competitive products, and who can effectively market the Products and provide support for the Products to all of the VAR's end-user customers. 4.2 Make reasonable efforts to maintain at lest one SELECTICA certified technical resource on staff at all times. 4.3 Upon end-user customer request at the point of sale, explain and demonstrate the Products and instruct the customer on the setup and installation. 4.4 Display, demonstrate, and represent the Products fairly and make no representations concerning SELECTICA or its products that are false, misleading or inconsistent with those representations set forth in the promotional or other materials that are supplied by SELECTICA. 4.5 Assure that the Products are sold to end-user customers only in complete and appropriate packaging which includes an SELECTICA warranty and limitation of liability statements, license agreement and/or other materials as specified by SELECTICA. VAR shall require each End-User to execute the End User Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit C. 4.6 Promptly report to SELECTICA all suspected defects in the Products. 4.7 Prevent the unauthorized reverse engineering, decompilation and reverse analysis of the products by VAR personnel and agents and use reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized reverse engineering decompilation and 2 <PAGE> 3 reverse analysis by VAR customers.

The provisions of this Section shall not be construed to expand the scope of VAR's rights set forth in Section 5(a), nor to require VAR to seek or obtain registrations of any kind whatsoever, in any portion of the Exclusive or Nonexclusive Territories, to protect the Intellectual Property Rights of Selectica. 5.

VAR shall pay a minimum annual maintenance fee at an amount as shown in EXHIBIT A for all term years except year one. All maintenance fees received from VAR (not directly from end-user) for VAR's end-user customers' annual maintenance shall be credited against VAR's annual program maintenance fee. The annual program maintenance fee only covers the development system(s) associated with the VAR Program as listed in EXHIBIT A. Any additional products purchased by VAR for internal use will be charged a separate maintenance fee as defined in Exhibit A. Such maintenance fees will be included with each product order, prorated based on the upcoming anniversary date of this Agreement. Renewal maintenance fees will be billed annually on the anniversary date of this Agreement. The maintenance fees must be kept current in order to remain in the VAR Program. 5.3 Maintenance to End User: VAR shall pay SELECTICA certain maintenance fees as defined in EXHIBIT A for all products purchased by end-users where VAR is providing first line support. VAR is required to provide first level support for year one for each customer, at a minimum. SELECTICA agrees to provide second line support to VAR provided that VAR is current with respect to maintenance fees as defined in section 5.2. VAR will receive minor upgrades, updates, software problem fixes, periodic reports on software problems, and other maintenance support for the products that VAR is then entitled to pass on to end-users. The annual maintenance fee covers only the Products VAR is licensed to resell. First year maintenance fees are required for each customer and are paid at the time of initial order. Subsequent renewal will be on each anniversary of the maintenance effective date. The maintenance effective date is defined as the date that SELECTICA ships product to VAR for a given customer. For year two and onward, SELECTICA agrees to contract with end-user for maintenance and support, if requested. 3 <PAGE> 4 by VAR or end-user. In such cases, end-user will be billed SELECTICA's standard maintenance and support fee as detailed in EXHIBIT A. Selectica shall have no obligation to support: (i) altered or damaged Software or any portion of Software incorporated with or into other software; (ii) Software that is not the then current release or immediately previous sequential release which is aged six (6) months or more since the issuance of the successive release; (iii) Software problems caused by Company's negligence, abuse or misapplication, use of Software other than as specified in Selectica user manual or other causes beyond the control of Selectica; or (iv) Software installed on any hardware that is not supported by Selectica.

Transfers control or ownership of all or part of the VAR, whether directly, indirectly, voluntarily or involuntarily; b.
