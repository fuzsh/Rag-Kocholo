        "text": "The Project:\n\nOrgan Recovery Systems (ORS) is a medical device manufacturer that provides organ preservation products and services. ORS purchased Arena Solutions software to document product designs and manufacturing processes. ORS needed an implementation leader who could define, create, and configure the new documentation system. This individual had to be familiar with document control software and understand the material and engineering structure of part numbers and drawings. All documentation had to be transitioned from external subcontractors to the new in-house system and reviewed for accuracy.\n\nThe Results:\n\nThe document control system was successfully implemented and current products were fully documented online within our six month timeframe. Now all departments can access documentation whether they are in the office or remote. Yvette was very knowledgeable, and had a good understanding of how the software structure supported development and manufacturing activities. Without direction, she could look at a product, a drawing package, and create a bill of material with the appropriate documentation. She is candid in her observations of the strengths and challenges she sees when collaborating. Her candor helps break through otherwise difficult challenges as people try to work together to get a task done.\n\nThe Project:\n\nShibley and Partners, LLC is a management consulting firm that helps employees transition in times of change. The firm uses effective stakeholder management, comprehensive training, and communication programs to achieve results for their clients. Shibley and Partners needed a learning specialist and instructional designer to produce an e-learning version of existing in-person training materials within a short timeframe. Course materials needed to be designed from an end-users perspective in easy to absorb sections. Additional requirements were: strong project management skills, the ability to come up to speed quickly, work remotely, meet tight deadlines and be organized, reliable, and self-directed.\n\nThe Results:\n\nThe e-learning training modules were created and delivered to the client by the deadline. The client was very pleased with the results and Shibley and Partners was happy working with Yvette. They felt Yvette had superior training expertise, created a solid working relationship, brought a lot of good ideas to the table, and had the ability to push back when needed. They were impressed with Yvetteâ€™s ability to jump into a project with an unfamiliar subject matter, and loved that she could come up to speed quickly and start working immediately."
