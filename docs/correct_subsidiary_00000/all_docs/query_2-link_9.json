        "text": "Japanese industrial giant Hitachi Ltd. announced today that it was acquiring GlobalLogic Inc., a privately held digital engineering services company based in Silicon Valley for $9.6 billion. The purchase price values the company’s shares at $8.5 billion, more than three times what they were worth just three years ago, with $1.1 billion allocated to paying off its debt. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Partners Group, the two largest shareholders in GlobalLogic, each stand to net $3.8 billion from the sale.\n\nHitachi made the acquisition to strengthen the digital portfolio of Lumada, its digital solutions business focused on what it calls “social infrastructure”, which includes sectors such as rail, energy, and healthcare. Lumada sees itself as an engine of value creation for its customers and partners focused on insights derived from data. In turn, GlobalLogic, with its 20,000 strong workforce possessing deep capabilities in software product engineering and vertical industry knowhow, is seen as a growth engine for Lumada.\n\nThe deal is yet another sign that software is becoming central to the strategy of non-software companies. Businesses that harness software successfully can realize massive gains in productivity, which will then lead them to strong competitive positions.\n\nAll companies must recognize the shift in the sources of value creation toward software and position themselves to take advantage of it. Those that compete as software companies will win and those that don’t will lose. Software is fast becoming a necessary core competence.\n\nAt its essence, software is codified knowhow. If a company has distinctive knowhow, something it knows how to do better than its competitors, it can codify this into software and scale it with digital platforms, allowing it to capture a disproportionate return on investment. In today’s data-driven world, coupled with machine learning algorithms, new knowhow—whether about customers, products, or operations—is increasingly derived from data, as Hitachi has recognized. This new knowhow can then be fed back into a company’s run-time systems. In short, it’s even more important to become a software company.\n\nMaking this shift isn’t easy. First and foremost, it requires the ability to envision a software-driven future. It demands both vertical industry and domain knowhow, as well as modern software development capabilities. Most established companies quickly learn that they do not possess the capabilities needed to reinvent themselves. So, instead, they must look to more capable tech partners to help them on their digital journeys as they build core competence in software. In fact, GlobalLogic CEO Shashank Samant has indicated that he sees his company’s mission as not just building software products, but rather building an internal software company for its partners. (Disclosure: GlobalLogic has sponsored an event I run at the University of California, Irvine)\n\nHitachi’s acquisition of Global Logic is the continuation of a trend that was pioneered by GE, which envisioned becoming a premier digital industrial company as well as a top five software company, and also includes Siemens and pure-play software company C3 AI. Together, these examples provide vivid evidence of the importance of software capabilities to traditional industrial sectors. As the Wall Street Journal has put it: Remember Hitachi? It’s A Software Company Now.\n\nIt’s a far cry from the company I recall from my childhood, when our home air conditioners and VCRs were made by Hitachi. It’s a software-driven world."
