When first setting prices, you can configure the program’s Selectica Playbook, which allows you to set rules for product and deal pricing. Next, the system’s product catalog gives your sales team all the information for your products’ pricing, packaging, availability, etc and lets your team generate deals with the help of a program wizard. Each time a salesperson selects an item to quote, the program ensures that your rep is choosing the right add-ons and options for the product. Once the quote is completed, you can quickly send your quote to the customer through the program and have customer-specific deals sent for approval.\n\nAbout Selectica\n\nSelectica was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in San Mateo, CA. The company launched its IPO in 2000 and is on NASDAQ as SLTC. Selectica’s programs are used by companies globally and are responsible for closing billions of dollars each year.\n\nSelectica CPQ Key Features"
