        "text": "by Chris Brook on Thursday March 7, 2024\n\nContact Us Free Demo Chat\n\nLearn about what a Software as a Service, or SaaS, company is and why it may make sense for your organization in this week’s Data Protection 101, our series on the fundamentals of information security.\n\nA SaaS company is a company that hosts an application and makes it available to customers over the internet.\n\nWhat is SaaS?\n\nSaaS stands for Software as a Service. This infers that the software sits on a SaaS company’s server while the user accesses it remotely. This definition can apply to a lot of software companies in this day and age, obviously.\n\nThe SaaS Business Model: How a SaaS Company Works\n\nA SaaS company maintains servers, databases, and software that allow the application to be accessed over the internet — most likely by web browsers. Users can access the software from almost any device.\n\nSaaS customers usually pay a subscription fee— often monthly — to access the application. Some subscriptions are based upon how much data needs to be stored, the number of users who will access the application, or the level of technical support desired.\n\nExamples of SaaS Companies\n\nSaaS companies can handle just about every business function. Some of the more popular types of SaaS applications available include:\n\nCustomer resource management or Customer Relationship Management (CRM) — These applications allow SaaS customers to manage customer information and track sales through their pipeline.\n\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) — This is a system of many SaaS applications most suited for big organizations.\n\nAccounting and invoicing — Some SaaS companies focus on billing and invoicing services. Others offer a full range of financial tracking and reporting services.\n\nProject management — Software can help collaborators communicate and stay on track.\n\nWeb hosting and ecommerce — Remote servers can handle everything a business needs in its online presence.\n\nHuman resources — SaaS companies can offer tools to track employee hours, manage payroll, schedule and manage the hiring process.\n\nData management — SaaS products can help analyze and secure a company’s data.\n\nMany B2B companies offering software applications like marketing automation, Email marketing, social media marketing, sales automation, and more. These companies can also be divided into different categories of SaaS, such as multi-tenancy vs single-tenancy.\n\nWhile many large technology companies are not \"SaaS companies\" they often offer SaaS products, such as Google Workspace, Google Cloud, and Adobe's creative cloud.\n\nBlog Post\n\nWhy Managed Security Services?\n\nBenefits of SaaS Companies\n\nA SaaS company’s major selling point is how much more efficient it is to use their centrally managed applications rather than installing software onsite. This means SaaS customers can realize the following benefits:\n\nCost savings — Most SaaS companies charge a subscription fee that helps spread out the cost of the application over time. SaaS customers have lower initial costs because they don’t need to invest in expensive hardware to host the applications as they offer cloud services.\n\nLow-effort updates — SaaS companies maintain the software and update it when needed. SaaS customers do not need to install any software or install patches and updates.\n\nMobility — In theory, SaaS customers can access to their systems from any device or location. This is very useful for workforces that are not confined to a central location or office.\n\nIT expertise — SaaS companies invest in the IT needed to troubleshoot and maintain applications so their customers don’t have to. Also, SaaS companies have the resources to maintain system reliability and data security better than customers with limited IT budgets.\n\nScalability — If a SaaS customer needs to expand capacity or add users, it doesn’t need to purchase new hardware or install new software. A SaaS company can increase capacity quickly with cloud technology and cloud storage, but it most likely will come at an increased subscription fee.\n\nRisks of SaaS Companies\n\nA great promise of SaaS companies is that they can handle infrastructure and maintenance so their customers don’t have to. That means a third party will be responsible for basic business functions. That entails some risk.\n\nPricing — While system flexibility is a key feature of SaaS companies, their contracts may not be so flexible. Having SaaS services on demand can be costly. Scaling back to less expensive options or cancelling the contract may not be allowed. And upgrading capacity or access could come at a steep price increase.\n\nDowntime — Being able to use a SaaS application and accessing the data depends on the reliability of a third party. The SaaS company's downtime could be your downtime.\n\nSecurity — Data security is in the hands of a third party. There are SaaS companies that don’t comply with security standards and aren’t transparent about security. Also consider that allowing users remote access with any device can increase convenience and vulnerability to unauthorized use.\n\nSolvency — A crucial aspect of the SaaS customer’s business depends on the SaaS company staying in business. If the vendor goes out of business, access to the SaaS service and data could be cut off. In the best-case scenario, the SaaS customer needs to find a new SaaS company and migrate the data.\n\nAggressive Sales Team / Marketing Team - Depending on the company some SaaS software companies will have aggressive sales teams trying to upsell users.\n\nCustomer Services - Again depending on the company some SaaS software providers will have limited customer service offerings.\n\nBest Practices for Choosing a SaaS Company\n\nSaaS companies work very hard at making their applications easy to use for users. And they try to make it just as easy to purchase their SaaS products. Perhaps too easy. Slow the process down and consider some best practices for choosing a SaaS company:\n\nFind out what happens when you are no longer a customer. Can you get your user data back in a standardized format easily?\n\nTest customer support. Just how good is it when you’re a paying customer? How focused is the company on customer relationships and customer experience (you can even ask about customer retention rates).\n\nGet as much training and migration help as possible. Or use it as leverage in negotiations.\n\nFind out what is the backup plan. Nothing is bulletproof. There will be downtime. Have a plan for when the system is unavailable.\n\nLook for data vulnerabilities. Speaking of vulnerability, does the SaaS company offer strong defense against hackers and data breaches?\n\nUnderstand the prices. Look for hidden fees and what kind of usage will trigger a higher subscription tier.\n\nMake sure your systems are compatible. The promise of SaaS is functionality on any device used anywhere. But does the application really work with all browsers or phones?\n\nSaaS companies can provide needed business services at a low cost. Due diligence will help ensure the user experience matches expectations and promises.\n\nOnce You Find a SaaS Company\n\nEven if you find the perfect solution, there is a chance you won’t use it to its full potential. For complicated software, there is often a learning curve. There are a number of steps to take for each new tool your company uses.\n\nUtilize educational materials — Most SaaS products have tutorials, knowledge bases and other material to help users get the most out of the product.\n\nSpeak with the onboarding team — The next level is to get on a call or video conference with a rep(s). Make sure key members of your team are there, too.\n\nConsider third-party setup — Some SaaS tools are so complicated, having an outside contractor set everything up is ideal. The company may also offer this service.\n\nGet the team onboard — The right tool paired with education and ample communication will make adoption easier, but all change takes effort to make it successful.\n\nRe-evaluate use at regular intervals — After a few months, it’s a good idea to see if the software is doing what you hoped it would. This is a good, regular practice for every tool your company uses.\n\nSaaS companies can provide needed business services at a low cost. Due diligence will help ensure the user experience matches expectations and promises.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is an example of SaaS?\n\nAn example of a SaaS solution is Microsoft 365. Users can access all of the functionality of the suite of Microsoft applications from any location that has an Internet connection. There’s no need to install and maintain software on their local computer. The mobile workforce makes extensive use of SaaS solutions to access necessary applications from anywhere in the world.\n\nWhat is SaaS in simple terms?\n\nSoftware as a Service or SaaS is a cloud delivery model that offers customers access to a fully-supported software application through an Internet connection. The cloud service provider is responsible for supporting all aspects of the application with the exception of user data. A SaaS solution is an excellent way of adding functionality to an IT environment without the capital costs of purchasing and maintaining hardware.\n\nWhat was the first SaaS company?\n\nSalesforce is generally regarded as the first company to offer its customers a SaaS solution. The company was founded in March 1999 and is credited with delivering the first SaaS product developed specifically to be distributed over the Internet. Previously, companies had experimented with providing online access to software originally developed to be distributed via CD-ROMs.\n\nHow many SaaS companies are there in the USA?\n\nAccording to Statista, as of 2022, there are over 17,000 SaaS companies in the United States. This number greatly exceeds the second place countries of Canada and the United Kingdom which both have around 2,000 SaaS companies.\n\nIs Amazon a SaaS company?\n\nAmazon is not, strictly speaking, a SaaS company. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive cloud platform that provides a wide range of solutions including SaaS offerings. AWS also offers customers Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions that address virtually any business requirement\n\nChris Brook\n\nChris Brook is the editor of Digital Guardian’s Data Insider blog.
