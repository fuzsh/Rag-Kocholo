(\"Selectica\"), targeted to create RSM - a Risk Score Model for FFIC. Selectica intends to provide the appropriate Advanced Configurator Engine (ACE) product set for this application, assist FFIC staff to develop the application (includes actual hands-on development of specific sections), and train FFIC personnel for continuing long-term application maintenance. Refer to the detailed functional specifications attached for any further information. The acceptance criteria is identified in the Requirements List which is Appendix C to this document. Pilot implementation scheduled for October 18th, 1999, is a fully functioning Risk Scoring Model with interfaces to reference data, a populated knowledgebase (KBS) and the GUI screens. Specific deliverables for this engagement are listed in the \"Deliverable\" section in this document. The phase from the Pilot to nationwide implementation will be a treated as a separate project and will include monitoring of the deliverables from a pilot operation in the North West region and additional functional enhancements that may be identified during the pilot development phase. A separate statement of work, functional specification, and a work/project plan for this phase is planned as a task in the Pilot project plan. BACKGROUND FFIC's Commercial business is focused around selling insurance policies for the Target Middle Market (\"TMM\") for the various coverages such as General Liability, Auto, Workers Compensation, and Umbrella coverage. As part of its Operational Efficiency strategy, FFIC now needs to provide a Risk scoring mechanism, focused first on the intranet access for its underwriters (FFIC employees), then integrated with its producers (the brokers who are their major revenue channel), and finally for direct sales on FFIC's e-Commerce program. SCOPE FFIC envisions RSM as a risk score advisor for its employees, targeted in this first phase, towards its internal underwriters nation wide. FFIC currently identifies the necessity to generate segmental analysis for a maximum of 10 states at any given point. FFIC also identifies that in the current phase any adjustment and segmental analysis for California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Alaska and standard states will need to be supported. This capability will be extended to other states if additional time becomes available in the development plan. The detailed functional specifications contain the specifics for this capability. SECURITY MODEL The Portal security logon mechanism will be used to gain access to the TMM site, which is passed on to RSM. The current phase will allow the model to validate a user through the portal system which is used to identify the user with the RSM system. The users do not have hierarchical access rights assigned inside the system. All the Risk Scores generated by any valid user will be accessible by all the users of the system. USER INTERFACE The user will gain access to the Application via the standard FFIC browser through a link on the TMM home Site. The user interface will adhere to the current TMM Home Site standards. The mockup of the user interface is contained in the Functional Specifications. The navigation is designed with the minimum amount of refreshes of the screen which will enable and enhance the speed of operation covering categories of questions, results and links to service specifications. The User will be allowed to exit to the TMM home site. - Page 4 - <PAGE> 33 RSM PROPOSAL PREPARED FOR FIREMAN'S FUND INSURANCE COMPANY For Post Pilot of Phase I, based on the feed back received from the user group, changes may be identified which may require a redevelopment of part of the user interface. Any identified changes will be processed via the Change Control process identified later in this document. KNOWLEDGE BASE The Knowledge base (\"KBS\") is the core business model developed using the Ace Model builder tool. Maintenance and enhancement of the model will be accomplished via the Ace Model-builder tool. It will support extracted data for the parameter and rules/constraints from the Selectica database which will be developed and populated for the RSM project only. These products suite is available to FFIC according the Annual maintenance contract agreed to on June 24th, 1999. DEPLOYMENT Deployment environment is at FFIC Computer's hosting site in Novato, California. The platform for deployment will be dual-CPU PII 450-500 MHz machines with 512MB of memory, 3x9 Hot pluggable, Raid controlled disk drives. Disaster Recovery will be supported via standard tape backup of the databases and drive images. Support will be provided by FFIC for daily operations and Selectica support will be provided as agreed to in the contract dated June 24, 1999. QUOTER The Ace Quoter implementation will be done on a DB2 database on a Windows NT platform by 10/18/99. This implementation requires engineering development effort by Selectica to support DB2. The implementation on the AIX DB2 platform will be done by 01/14/2000. The additional engineering work by Selectica has been agreed to in the contract dated June 24th, 1999. DATABASE REPOSITORY The application will connect to a DB2 database for data required for developing the Knowledge base parameters and rules/constraints for the four lines of businesses. This DB2 database will be developed as part of the RSM project. This database will have tables populated from various sources. CUSTOM \"PLUG INS\": \"Plug Ins\" is additional functional piece of program written in JAVA language, which is referred to the Ace Enterprise server as an external entity. These \"plug in\" components are executed on the server only. o Generic data retrieval \"plug in\" needs to be developed to fulfill all FFIC Runtime Database search requirements. This piece of program is developed and integrated by FFIC. The rest of the \"plug in\" o Quote Lock \"plug in.\" o Search ability required across quote cart container and quote container. o Copy quote functionality needs a plug-ins / stored procedure to be developed. BACK END SYSTEM INTEGRATION No Back End integration is required in this Phase as we are not integrating into any legacy systems. The data, which is part of the RSM system, are part of the DB2 Quote repository, in a meta data format, is available for FFIC for any further process they may seem appropriate. No interface with any FFIC systems/applications are required for the Pilot phase. OUTPUT REPORTS Segmentals for all the policies accepted needs to be generated as reports in HTML format and an output of them will be stored in a PDF format as a blob field in a DB2 database. Support will be - Page 5 - <PAGE> 34 RSM PROPOSAL PREPARED FOR FIREMAN'S FUND INSURANCE COMPANY provided to extract information from the meta data to monitor the pilot risk assessments and for model verification. FACTORS AFFECTING DEVELOPMENT ASSUMPTION, CONSTRAINTS, AND DEPENDENCIES The purpose of this section is to document internal and external factors that will affect the project plan and its execution. Proper steps will be taken to ensure that all assumptions are fulfilled, dependencies addressed and that expectations are properly set that take into account the project's constraints. ASSUMPTIONS Selectica assumes that FFIC will be available to assist with all the service knowledge required to deliver the scope of work defined in this document. Selectica will provide access to the software components produced by Selectica required during the engagement. Selectica also assumes that FFIC will provide any other hardware or software required to successfully execute this project. Selectica also assumes that FFIC will make available all related documentation and any associated resources, throughout the course of this engagement, and that FFIC management will provide timely decisions, essential for the completion of the deliverables on time. Software: o ACE Enterprise, Ace Quote Server, Ace Studio and ACE Enterprise Manager software o Windows NT 4.0 (with service pack 4), HTTP server (IIS) o Servlet engine (JRUN 1.2.2) o DB2 Hardware (for development) may include but is not limited to: o 1 server to host the http server, and the ACE Enterprise server. Hardware (for production) may include but is not limited to: o 1 server to host the http server, and the ACE Enterprise server. To ensure that the application will be deployed on the AIX platform Selectica requires FFIC to provide the deployment hardware at their premises at San Jose at least 3 months prior to the actual deployment, i.e.: latest by 31/09/99. Selectica also assumes that FFIC will provide resources for the creative design, navigation and flow and content of the RSM application HTML pages. Selectica will assist in the review and adaptation of these HTML templates to the RSM knowledge base and engine. CONSTRAINT The functionality mentioned in the deliverables will have to either work within or work around the limitations of the environment. These include browser capabilities, product capabilities, interface capabilities etc. Selectica suggests that the testing environment be restricted to Netscape 4.x and Internet Explorer 4.x (JavaScript 1.2 compliant versions only) on Windows NT, 95 and 98 platforms. DEPENDENCIES In order for the development process to be successful, Selectica personnel will work closely with FFIC personnel during the complete period of engagement. Logistically, most of the development work is envisioned at FFIC premises. Other tasks such as but not limited to engineering development, UDF / plug-in development, application and navigation flow design and reviews may be done at Selectica premises as necessary.
