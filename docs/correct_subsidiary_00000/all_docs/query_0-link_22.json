        "text": "Companies have a duty to preserve evidence that may be relevant to a pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation. Complying with this duty requires the institution of “litigation holds” and the suspension of routine document retention/destruction policies. Failure to do so can result in expensive and time-consuming sanctions. However, it can be difficult to determine when litigation is reasonably foreseeable.\n\nDuty to Preserve\n\nCorporations rely on litigation holds to satisfy the duty to preserve information that may be relevant to a pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation.1 A properly crafted litigation hold identifies custodians and data stewards of relevant information and outlines procedures to preserve such information.2 To be effective, the litigation hold must be implemented as soon as the duty to preserve is triggered. It’s not always clear what triggers a litigation hold.\n\nThe courts have consistently held that the duty to preserve information is not triggered by the “mere existence of a potential claim or the distant possibility of litigation”.3 Instead, courts apply an objective standard, “asking not whether the party in fact reasonably foresaw litigation, but whether a reasonable party in the same factual circumstances would have reasonably foreseen litigation”.4\n\nIn the arena of litigation holds, one thing is crystal clear – the filing of a complaint and the subsequent service of the summons triggers a defendant’s obligations.5 However, the duty can “also extend to that period before the litigation, when a party reasonably should... anticipate litigation”.6\n\nDuty to Preserve Can Extend to Non-Parties\n\nGenerally, the duty to preserve information does not apply to entities that are not a party to the litigation,7 except in situations where there is a “special relationship or special circumstance” involving the non-party or when the non-party enters into an agreement to preserve information sought to be obtained.8 While no clear criterion or criteria has emerged for what constitutes a “special relationship” or “special circumstance”, courts consider whether the non-party has a significant interest in the case.9\n\nAs any litigator knows, a violation of the duty to preserve, even by a non-party, can result in negative consequences for the aligned party. Specifically, the court can impose spoliation sanctions ranging from excluding the related evidence to giving the jury adverse inference instructions.10\n\nIn imposing sanctions, the court considers the non-party’s relationship with the aligned party and a balance of hardships between the litigating parties. Specifically, the analysis focuses on the following factors:\n\n• Culpability of the aligned party in the breach (eg, complicity or knowledge of the nonparty’s breach).\n\n• Ability of the aligned party to control the non-party.\n\n• Steps taken by the aligned party to attempt to preserve the evidence destroyed by the non-party.\n\n• The extent that any negative judgment will be borne by the non-party (eg, whether the non-party indemnifies the aligned party).\n\n• The degree of involvement between the non-party and aligned party; and\n\n• The importance of the evidence to the opposing party.\n\nEvidence Held by Related Corporate Entities\n\nThe duty to preserve can also extend to documents and electronically stored information (ESI) held by a non-party corporate affiliate of the party from whom discovery is sought (ie, a sister corporation, parent, or subsidiary). Under Fed R Civ P 34, a party must produce documents in its possession, custody or control upon request.11 This could include materials and information possessed by a corporate affiliate which is not a named party in the action.12 In such instances, the court examines the corporate party’s “control” over the requested information.\n\n“Control” is construed broadly as the “legal right, authority, or practical ability to obtain the information sought upon demand”.13 In making this determination, courts consider the following factors:\n\n• Commonality of ownership of the corporate entities.\n\n• Exchange or intermingling of directors, officers or employees of the corporations.\n\n• Exchange of documents between the companies in the ordinary course of business.\n\n• Any benefit or involvement by the non-party corporation in the transaction at issue.\n\n• Involvement of the non-party corporation in the litigation.\n\n• The corporate party’s marketing and/or servicing of the non-party company’s products; and\n\n• The financial relationship between the companies.14\n\nAnalysing the above factors, courts have found that documents possessed by a non-party subsidiary corporation were within the control of the parent corporation, a party to the litigation. In situations where a parent corporation is sued, and its subsidiary is in possession of relevant information, a litigation hold could be needed, and the best rule of thumb may be to issue a litigation hold to the relevant subsidiary.\n\nCourts have also held that documents held by a non-party parent entity were within the subsidiary’s control. For example, in Ferber v Sharp Electronics Corp, the court held that the defendant, who allegedly infringed the plaintiff’s patent, had constructive control of information possessed by its Japanese parent corporation, a non-party to the action.15 In this case, the court determined that the subsidiary has some control over the documents sought. However, this outcome is uncommon, since a subsidiary would generally have no power over its parent company.16 So, in situations where a subsidiary is sued, and its parent is in possession of relevant information, a litigation hold is generally not needed (although there are exceptions).\n\nAs to subsidiaries of the same parent , some courts have found that “sister companies” in a corporation have control over documents held by the non-party sister corporation.17 In situations like this, the requirement of a litigation hold will likely depend on the degree of interrelationship between the sister corporations and the relevance of the information held by the non-party sister entity, but in general, a litigation hold is also generally not needed.\n\nSummary\n\nGiving the fact-specific nature of the triggering event for a litigation hold, (which would result in the duty to preserve information, using a litigation hold), and given the uncertainty about what entities are subject to a litigation hold, parties should carefully consider the decision on instituting litigation holds as soon as litigation is reasonably foreseeable (or soon after litigation has been instituted). Indeed, for added safety, defendant corporations could even consider obtaining a short opinion of outside counsel on the issue, to serve as added insurance, if challenged.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 Micron Tech Inc v Rambus Inc, 645 F.3d 1311, 1321-22 (Fed Cir 2011); see also Hynix Semiconductor Inc v Rambus Inc, 645 F.3d 1336 (Fed Cir 2011); Zubulake v UBS Warburg LLC, 220 FRD 212, 216-18 (SDNY 2003).
