Within ten (10) days of acceptance by Escrow Holder of such Supplemental Deposit, Escrow Holder shall notify Licensor and Licensee by issuing a copy of the Attachment B. (b) Replacement Deposit. \"Replacement Materials\" replace the existing Deposit defined by Attachment B(s). Licensor will submit any Replacement Materials accompanied by an Attachment B.

Escrow Holder will destroy or return to Licensor all materials that are replaced by the Replacement Materials. 4. DEPOSIT INSPECTION. Upon the receipt of the Initial Deposit materials and any Deposit Changes, Escrow Holder will visually match the listed items on the Attachment B to the labeling of such materials. Escrow Holder shall not be responsible for verifying the contents or validating the accuracy of Licensor's labeling. Acceptance of the Deposit will occur only when Escrow Holder concludes that the Deposit Inspection is complete; which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld. 5. LICENSE REGISTRATION ACCOUNT. Following the execution of this Agreement and the payment of the set-up, deposit and registration fee to Escrow Holder, Escrow Holder shall open a \"Registration Account\" for Licensee. The opening of the Registration Account means that Escrow Holder shall establish an account ledger in the name of the Licensee and that Licensee shall receive renewal notices as provided in Section 7. Unless and until Licensor makes an Initial Deposit of Materials with Escrow Holder, Escrow Holder shall have no obligation to Licensee except as defined by this section. 6. DEPOSIT OBLIGATIONS OF CONFIDENTIALITY. Escrow Holder agrees to establish a receptacle in which it shall place the Deposit (meaning the Initial Deposit, Supplemental Deposits and Replacement Deposits to the extent then applicable) and shall put the receptacle under the control of one or more of its officers, selected by Escrow Holder, whose identity shall be available to Licensor and Licensee at all times. Escrow Holder shall exercise a professional level of care in carrying out the terms of this Agreement. (a) Escrow Holder acknowledges Licensor's assertion that the Deposit shall contain proprietary data of Licensor and that Escrow Holder has an obligation to preserve and protect that confidentiality. (b) Escrow Holder may duplicate the Deposit only as necessary to preserve and safely store the Deposit, and to provide copies thereof, as authorized herein, to Licensee. Escrow Holder shall reproduce on all copies of the Deposit made by Escrow Holder 36 <PAGE> 37 any proprietary or confidentiality notices contained in the Deposit originally deposited with it by Licensor. (c) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, Escrow Holder agrees that it shall not divulge, disclose, otherwise make available to third parties, or make any use whatsoever of the Deposit, or of any information provided to it by Licensor in connection with this Agreement, without the express prior written consent of Licensor. This obligation will continue indefinitely notwithstanding termination of this Agreement. 7. TERM OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement will have a term consistent with the term of the License Agreement. In the event that the renewal fees are not received within thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date, Escrow Holder shall so notify Licensor and Licensee of the thirty (30) day expiration period. If the renewal fees are not received within the subsequent thirty (30) days, this Agreement will expire without further notice and without liability of Escrow Holder to the parties of this Agreement. Licensee has the right to pay renewal fees and other related fees. In the event Licensee pays the renewal fees and Licensor is of the opinion that any necessary condition for renewal is not met, Licensor may so notify Escrow Holder, and Licensee in writing. The resulting dispute will be resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution process defined in Section 12. 8. EXPIRY. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, upon non-renewal or other termination of this Agreement, all duties and obligations of Escrow Holder to Licensor and Licensee will terminate. Thereafter, if Licensor requests the return of the Deposit, Escrow Holder shall return the Deposit to Licensor, but only after all outstanding invoices and the deposit return fees are paid. If the fee(s) are not received by the anniversary date of this Agreement, Escrow Holder shall, at its option, destroy or return the Deposit to Licensor. 9. FILING FOR RELEASE OF DEPOSIT BY LICENSEE. Upon notice to Escrow Holder by Licensee (in the form of an affidavit or declaration by an officer of Licensee) of the occurrence of a release condition as defined in Section 24 of the License Agreement, and payment of the filing for release fee, Escrow Holder shall so notify Licensor by certified mail with a copy of the notice from the Licensee. If Licensor provides contrary instruction within ten (10) working days of the mailing of the notice to Licensor, Escrow Holder shall not deliver the Deposit to the Licensee except as provided below. (a) \"Contrary instruction\" means the filing of an affidavit or declaration with Escrow Holder by an officer of Licensor stating that a Release Condition has not occurred, or has been cured. Escrow Holder will send a copy of the affidavit or declaration by certified mail to the Licensee who is filing for the release of the Deposit materials. Upon receipt of contrary instruction, Escrow Holder shall not deliver a copy of the Deposit and shall continue to store the Deposit until otherwise directed by Licensor and Licensee jointly, or until resolution of the dispute pursuant to Section 1.12. 37 <PAGE> 38 10. RELEASE OF DEPOSIT TO LICENSEE. Release conditions are those conditions specified for release of escrow in Section 24 of License Agreement. (a) If after following the procedure in Section 9, Escrow Holder does not receive contrary instruction from Licensor, Escrow Holder is authorized to release the Deposit, or if more than one Licensee is registered to the Deposit, a copy of the Deposit, to the Licensee filing for release following receipt of any fees due to Escrow Holder. 11. CONDITIONS FOR USE FOLLOWING RELEASE. Following a release as provided in Section 10, Licensee shall have the non-exclusive right to use the released material as and only as authorized by Section 24 of the License Agreement. Additionally, Licensee shall be required to maintain the confidentiality of the released materials and technology in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement. 12. DISPUTES. In the event of a dispute as to which this section applies, Escrow Holder shall so notify Licensor and Licensee in writing. Such dispute will be settled by arbitration (which arbitration shall be binding and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction for purposes of this Agreement only) in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Licensor and Licensee will each select one arbitrator and a third arbitrator will be selected unanimously by the two arbitrators selected by the parties. If the two arbitrators selected by the parties are unable to select the third arbitrator within ten (10) days of the appointment of the two arbitrators, the parties consent to the selection of the third arbitrator by the AAA administrator. 13. INDEMNIFICATION. Licensor and Licensee agree to defend and indemnify Escrow Holder and hold Escrow Holder harmless from and against all claims, actions and suits, whether in contract or in tort, and from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs, charges, penalties, counsel fees, and other expenses of any nature (including, without limitation, settlement costs) incurred by Escrow Holder as a result of performance of this Agreement except in the event of a judgment or arbitration decision which specified that Escrow Holder acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct. 14. AUDIT RIGHTS. Escrow Holder agrees to keep records of the activities undertaken and materials prepared pursuant to this Agreement. Licensor and Licensee will be entitled at reasonable times, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to Escrow Holder, during the term of this Agreement to inspect the records of Escrow Holder with respect to this Agreement.

GENERAL. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Escrow Holder may act in reliance upon any written instruction, instrument, or signature reasonably believed to be genuine and may assume that any person giving any written notice, request, advice or instruction in connection with or relating to this Agreement has been duly authorized to do so. Escrow Holder is not responsible for failure to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement due to causes beyond its control. (a) This Agreement is to be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. (b) Except for the License Agreement, this Agreement, including the Attachments and Addenda hereto, constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof, and will supersede all previous communications, representations, understandings, and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties. Licensor and Licensee acknowledge that Escrow Holder has no knowledge of the terms and conditions contained in the License Agreement and that Escrow Holder's only obligations shall be as set forth herein or in any other writing signed by Escrow Holder, Licensor and Licensee. (c) If any provision of this Agreement is held by any court to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or severed from this Agreement to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. 17. FEES. All service fees will be due in full at the time of the request for service. Renewal fees will be due in full upon the receipt of invoice unless otherwise specified by the invoice. For the purpose of annual renewal fees the effective date of this Agreement will be the anniversary date.

Selectica is responsible for the development and deployment of the car configurator in the Virtual Center and managing the project resources for the configurator tool. Selectica's responsibilities include the Harvest Database schema design and implementation, addition of models to the configurator, the maintenance of the configurator tool and addition of new configuration capabilities. The following are the major functions supported in the BMW Virtual Center: 1. THE CAR CONFIGURATOR: The E-46 car configurator allows users to configure the BMW cars as set forth in Exhibit 1. online on the BMW Web site. The configurator allows users to correctly pick exterior and interior colors, packages and trim and other options, guiding customers through appropriate and available choices, based on previous selections. The customer will be presented the MSRP pricing. Selectica will deploy the ACE Enterprise software to facilitate the configuration process. 2. STORE AND RESTORE: Once a car configuration is complete, the user is able to save the configuration and retrieve it at a later date to work on it further. Selectica will deploy the ACE Quote Server that handles the saving and retrieval of configuration quotes. This functionality is required to enable the Lead Transfer System of the BMW Virtual Center. 3. HARVEST DATABASE SCHEMA DESIGN: In order to effectively maintain the BMW Virtual Center for configuration of all models, the data for all the models will need to exist in a central repository. This repository is called the \"Harvest Database\". Selectica will design the Harvest Database to include any information that is required by the Virtual Center configurator. 4. LEAD TRANSFER SYSTEM (PICK A RETAILER): This functionality will permit prospective customer leads generated on the Virtual Center to be transferred to BMW, or any BMW designee, or to its Centers and Affiliate Centers. 5.
