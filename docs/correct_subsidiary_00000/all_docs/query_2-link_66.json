        "text": "Genpact's story began in 1997 as a business unit within General Electric with 20 employees and a vision. As a pilot project running GE Capital's back-office services operations, our goal was to enable outstanding process efficiencies and deliver operational effectiveness. We did that and more.\n\nWe built the infrastructure for the business brick by brick in cities across India. And we hired and trained tens of thousands of young people, creating unprecedented employment opportunities for women, too.\n\nOver the next eight years, we managed a wide range of processes across GE's financial services and manufacturing businesses around the world. And we embedded GE's Lean and Six Sigma capabilities into our core principles and work for clients.\n\nJanuary 2005 became our next major milestone. We spun off from GE to become an independent company, enabling us to bring our operational skills and technology expertise – in finance and accounting, in particular – to more businesses and geographies.\n\nJust two and a half years later, we completed a successful IPO, listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol G. The combination of process, analytics, technology, and operations became central to our work. By 2010, we'd grown our global footprint, increasing our employee base by 33% and adding sites in six new countries.\n\nAt the time, we also launched our Smart Enterprise Processes (SEP℠) methodology, a rigorous, scientific approach for delivering impact for clients that soon won awards and earned a patent. We also continued to move our solutions to the cloud with our business-process-as-a-service strategy to give clients' operations greater speed and scale.\n\nFrom then on, our center of gravity and senior leaders' locations moved steadily westward, matching our growing cadre of clients and their decision-makers. We built a significant presence in Europe and the US and made New York City the home of our key corporate office.\n\nNovember 2012 welcomed a new phase of growth. It started with a clearer definition of our solution portfolio and an updated approach to managing client relationships while continuously enhancing our business and industry experience and related talent base.\n\nBy 2015, digital technologies had become fundamental to our work. We introduced clients to our Lean Digital approach, combining our Lean Six Sigma DNA with our innovative technical capabilities to help businesses reach digital's full potential.\n\nGenpact Cora, our AI-based digital business platform, took our commitment to helping clients accelerate their transformation initiatives to the next level. Launched in 2017, the platform offers businesses access to modular and flexible digital technologies that tackle challenges end to end.\n\nIn addition to our organic growth, we have bolstered our capabilities with strategic acquisitions over the years. This includes:\n\n2011: Akritiv Technologies, a provider of cloud-based order-to-cash solutions\n\n2017: AI specialist Rage Frameworks\n\n2017–2022: Cementing our commitment to transforming the experience economy, we acquired:\n\n2017: TandemSeven, a digital customer experience consulting firm\n\n2019: Rightpoint, a digital consultancy company\n\n2020: Something Digital, an ecommerce agency\n\n2022: Hoodoo Digital, a digital experience consultancy specializing in Adobe solutions\n\n2018: Barkawi Management Consultants expanded our supply chain expertise\n\n2021: Enquero brought additional data, cloud technologies, and analytics strength\n\nWe have a long history of helping our global talent stay up to speed with the latest technologies and skills. In 2018, we introduced employees to Genome, a collective intelligence learning platform that brings together people's skills and knowledge from across the business so everyone can learn from their latest experiences. In 2020, during the pandemic, we opened parts of the platform to the public to support people's needs for professional resilience.\n\nIn 2022, we refocused our core service sets on our data-tech-AI and digital operations services. We also reinforced our purpose – the relentless pursuit of a world that works better for people – by fortifying our sustainability services with technology and helping businesses turn their environmental, social, and governance commitments into competitive advantage.\n\nWith the rapid spread of AI technologies and opportunities for enterprises, Genpact set a new vision for the future: to empower clients through applied AI solutions that drive unparalleled outcomes.\n\nWe're realizing this vision thanks to our innate curiosity and profound business and industry knowledge, plus our startup mentality and close connection to our clients."
