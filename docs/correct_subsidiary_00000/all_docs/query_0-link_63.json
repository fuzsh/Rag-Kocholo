(the Annual Meeting), at Churchill Downs Racetrack, 700 Central Avenue, Louisville, Kentucky, and any adjournments thereof. This solicitation is being made primarily by mail and at the expense of the Company. Certain officers and directors of the Company and persons acting under their instruction may also solicit proxies on behalf of the Board of Directors by means of telephone calls, personal interviews and mail at no additional expense to the Company. The Proxy Card and this Proxy Statement are being sent to shareholders on or about May 3, 2012.\n\nVoting Rights\n\nOnly holders of record of the Companys Common Stock, no par value (Common Stock), on April 13, 2012, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. On that date, 17,337,968 shares of Common Stock were outstanding and entitled to vote. Each shareholder has one vote per share on all matters coming before the Annual Meeting. The shareholders of the Company do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Under the Companys Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and the applicable provisions of Kentucky law, abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted in determining the number of votes required for the election of a director or passage of any matter submitted to the shareholders. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.\n\nIf the enclosed Proxy is properly executed and returned prior to the Annual Meeting, the shares represented thereby will be voted as specified therein. IF A SHAREHOLDER DOES NOT SPECIFY OTHERWISE, THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THE SHAREHOLDERS PROXY WILL BE VOTED: (I) FOR THE ELECTION OF THE NOMINEES LISTED BELOW UNDER ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; (II) FOR THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSE COOPERS LLP AS THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012; (III) FOR APPROVAL OF THE PERFORMANCE GOALS FOR AND MAXIMUM AWARDS PAYABLE TO ROBERT L.

Please refer to the instructions on your proxy card or the information forwarded by your bank, broker or other holder of record. The Internet and telephone voting facilities will close at 11:59 p.m. E.D.T. on June 13, 2012.\n\n1\n\nRevocation of Proxy\n\nA proxy may be revoked at any time before the shares it represents are voted by giving written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company at 700 Central Avenue, Louisville, Kentucky 40208, and such revocation shall be effective for all votes after receipt or by delivery of a properly executed, later-dated proxy, including an Internet or telephone vote, or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting.\n\nImportant Information Regarding Delivery of Proxy Materials\n\nWhat is Notice and Access?\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted amendments to the proxy rules that change how companies must provide proxy materials. Under these rules, often referred to as the notice and access model, companies can elect to make materials available to shareholders using either the notice only or full set delivery options. A company may use either option for all of its shareholders or may use one method for some shareholders and the other method for others.\n\nWhat is the Full Set Delivery Option?\n\nUnder this option, a company continues to provide all proxy materials as it did prior to the change in the proxy rules. Materials may be provided in paper form and sent via mail or, if a shareholder has previously elected, may be provided in electronic form and sent via e-mail. In addition to delivering materials to shareholders, the Company is obligated to post all proxy materials on a publicly available website and provide information to shareholders about how to access that website.\n\nIn connection with its 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Company has elected to use the full set delivery option. Accordingly, each shareholder will receive the Companys proxy materials by mail or, if previously agreed to by a shareholder, by e-mail. These proxy materials include the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, proxy statement, proxy card and Annual Report. These materials are also available at http://www.churchilldownsincorporated.com/proxy.\n\nWhat is the Notice Only Option?\n\nUnder this option, a Company posts all of its proxy materials on a publicly available website. Instead of delivering proxy materials to shareholders via mail or e-mail, the Company delivers a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. This notice includes, among other matters: (i) information on the date and time of the annual meeting of shareholders and items to be considered at such meeting; (ii) information regarding the website where the proxy materials are posted; and (iii) various methods by which a shareholder may request paper or electronic copies of the proxy materials. If a shareholder requests paper copies of proxy materials, these materials must be sent to the shareholder within three (3) business days via first-class mail.\n\nWill the Company Use the Notice Only Option in the Future?\n\nAlthough the Company has elected to use the full set delivery option in connection with the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, it may choose to use the notice only option in the future. By reducing the amount of materials that a company needs to print and mail, the notice only option provides an opportunity for cost savings as well as conservation of natural resources. However, many companies that have used the notice only option have also experienced a lower participation ratemeaning that fewer shareholders voted in these companies annual elections. The Company plans to evaluate the future possible cost savings as well as the possible impact on shareholder participation as it considers future use of the notice only option.\n\n2\n\nAs a Shareholder, What Do I Need to Do?\n\nIf you would prefer to continue receiving paper copies of proxy materials if the Company elects to use the notice only option for future annual meetings, please mark the Materials Election box on your proxy card (or provide this information when you vote telephonically or via the Internet).\n\nAs noted above, if the Company elects to use the notice only option, it must provide paper copies via first class mail to any shareholder who, after receiving the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, nevertheless requests paper copies. So, for example, even if you do not check the Materials Election box now, you will still have the right to request delivery of a free set of proxy materials upon receipt of any Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in the future. Because first class postage is significantly costlier than bulk mail rates and because each such request must be processed on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis, the cost of responding to a single request for paper copies is likely to be significantly greater than the per shareholder cost the Company currently incurs in delivering proxy materials via bulk mail. Accordingly, requests for paper copies could significantly undermine or eliminate expected cost savings associated with the notice only option.\n\nBy developing in advance a database of shareholders who would prefer to continue receiving paper copies of proxy materials, the Company would be able to use the full set delivery option for these shareholdersusing bulk mail to deliver the paper copieswhile using the notice only option for other shareholders. Company management believes this would significantly reduce the number of requests for paper copies that the Company would need to process on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis and would position the Company to better capture cost savings should it elect to use the notice only option in the future. We appreciate your assistance in helping us develop this database through the proxy card, telephonic and Internet voting processes.\n\n3\n\nSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial\n\nOwners and Management\n\nThe following table sets forth information as of April 13, 2012 (except as otherwise indicated below) regarding the beneficial ownership of the Common Stock by the only persons known by the Company to beneficially own more than five percent (5%) of the Common Stock, each director of the Company, each named executive officer (as defined in Executive Compensation-Summary Compensation Table herein), and the Companys directors and executive officers as a group. Except as otherwise indicated, the persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all of the shares of Common Stock shown as beneficially owned by them. The percentage of beneficial ownership is calculated based on 17,337,968 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of April 13, 2012. We are not aware of any pledge of our Common Stock or any other arrangements the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of our Company.\n\nName of Beneficial Owner\n\nAmount and Nature Of\n\nBeneficial Ownership(1)(2) Percent of Class\n\nThe Duchossois Group, Inc.

Currently the Board of Directors is comprised of eleven (11) directors, with four (4) directors in Class I, three (3) directors in Class II and four (4) directors in Class III. The Company has a mandatory retirement age policy with regard to directors, which provides that a person is not qualified to serve as a director unless he or she is less than seventy (70) years of age on the date of election. However, the Board believes that it is important to monitor overall Board performance and suitability and, pursuant to the policy, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Board may waive the effective date of mandatory retirement. There are no directors in Class I that will have met the mandatory retirement age at the Annual Meeting.\n\nThe Company is a party to a Merger Agreement dated as of June 23, 2000, as amended (the Merger Agreement), between the Company and Duchossois Industries, Inc. (currently known as The Duchossois Group, Inc.), under which certain subsidiaries of the Company were merged into certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of Duchossois Industries, Inc. (the Merger). The Merger was approved by vote of the Companys shareholders at a Special Meeting of the shareholders on September 8, 2000. Pursuant to a Stockholders Agreement between the Company and Duchossois Industries, Inc., as part of the Merger, Duchossois Industries, Inc. designated three (3) individuals for appointment and election to the Board of Directors. The Stockholders Agreement provides that those individuals, Mr. Richard L. Duchossois, Mr. Craig J. Duchossois and Mr. Robert L. Fealy (or substitute designees reasonably acceptable to the Company), would be nominated to serve as directors of the Company, being allocated as equally as possible among the three classes of directors, for vote of the shareholders of the Company at the annual meeting of shareholders at which each respective class is then submitted for vote by the shareholders. In 2000, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Mr. Craig J. Duchossois to serve as a member of Class I, Mr. Richard L. Duchossois to serve as a member of Class II and Mr. Robert L. Fealy to serve as a member of Class III. Mr. Craig J. Duchossois, Mr. Richard L. Duchossois and Mr. Robert L. Fealy have each been subsequently re-elected to the Board of Directors.\n\nAt the Annual Meeting, the four (4) persons named in the following table will be nominated on behalf of the Board of Directors for election as directors in Class I. The Nominating and Governance Committee has recommended, and the Board has approved, the nomination of these persons. All of the nominees currently serve as members of Class I and have agreed to serve if re-elected. With each shareholder having one vote per share to cast for each director position, the nominees receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected. The biographical information for our directors below includes information regarding certain of the experiences, qualifications, attributes and skills that led to the determination that such individuals are qualified to serve on the Board of Directors.\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE INSTRUCTED, IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE PERSONS NAMED IN THE PROXY TO VOTE THE SHARES REPRESENTED THEREBY IN FAVOR OF THE ELECTION OF THE CLASS I DIRECTORS NAMED BELOW.\n\n7\n\nNominees for Election as Directors\n\nName, Age and\n\nPositions with\n\nCompany\n\nPrincipal Occupation(1)\n\nand Certain Directorships(2)\n\nClass ITerms Expiring in 2015\n\nLeonard S.

The current policy provides that a person is not qualified to serve as a director unless he or she is less than seventy (70) years of age on the date of election. However, the Board believes that it is important to monitor overall Board performance and suitability and, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Board may waive the effective date of mandatory retirement. Each director shall become a Director Emeritus upon the expiration of his or her current term following the date on which he or she is no longer qualified for election due to age, provided the effective date of such mandatory retirement has not been waived.

Pollard retired from the Board of Directors as of June 16, 2011.\n\n(2) The Churchill Downs Incorporated 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan allows directors to defer receipt of all or part of their retainer and meeting fees in a direct account that gives several investment options. Mr. Brodsky elected to have all of his director fees for 2011 deposited into an investment account under the Churchill Downs Incorporated 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan.\n\n(3) The Churchill Downs Incorporated 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan also allows directors to defer receipt of all or part of their retainer and meeting fees in a deferred share account until after their service on the Board has ended. This account allows the director, in effect, to invest his or her deferred cash compensation in Company Common Stock. Funds in this account are credited as hypothetical shares of Common Stock based on the market price of the stock at the time the compensation would otherwise have been earned. Hypothetical dividends are reinvested in additional shares based on the market price of the stock on the date dividends are paid. All shares in the deferred share accounts are hypothetical and are not issued or transferred until the director ends his or her service on the Board. Upon the end of service, the shares are issued or transferred to the director. In 2011, Craig Duchossois, Mr. Fealy, Mr. Harrington and Mr. McDonald deferred all of their 2011 directors fees into a deferred share account under the Churchill Downs Incorporated 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan. The grant dates for the deferred shares was the first business day of the first month after the quarter end. As of December 31, 2011, Mr. Fealy had 6,708.155 deferred shares, Mr. Craig Duchossois had 1,086.032 deferred shares, Mr. Richard Duchossois had 2,445.791 deferred shares, Mr. Harrington had 4,686.195 deferred shares and Mr. McDonald had 3,431.739 deferred shares under the Plan.\n\n(4) On June 16, 2011, each non-employee director received a grant of restricted stock units, in the amount of $25,000 based upon the closing price of a share of the Companys stock on that date, that vest upon the earlier of (i) the anniversary of the grant date of such units or (ii) the day immediately preceding the annual meeting of shareholders of the Company next occurring after the grant date of such units. At the time a director ceases being a director of the Company, the Company will issue one share of common stock for each vested restricted stock unit owned by such director. As of December 31, 2011, each non-employee director had 787 vested restricted stock units and 583 unvested restricted stock units that will vest on June 14, 2012.\n\n14\n\nCorporate Governance\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for providing effective governance over the Companys affairs. The Companys corporate governance practices are designed to align the interests of the Board and management with those of our shareholders and to promote honesty and integrity throughout the Company.\n\nDuring the past year, we continued to review our corporate governance policies and practices and compare them to those suggested by various authorities in corporate governance and the practices of other public companies. We have also reviewed guidance and interpretations provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ.\n\nCopies of the current charter, as approved by our Board, for each of our Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees and a copy of our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Conduct for Employees and Code of Ethics for Principal Financial Officers are available on our corporate website, http://www.churchilldownsincorporated.com under the Investors heading.\n\nShareholders may send communications to the Companys Board of Directors addressed to the Board of Directors c/o Churchill Downs Incorporated, 700 Central Avenue, Louisville, Kentucky 40208. Any correspondence addressed to the Board of Directors in care of the Company is forwarded to the Board of Directors without review by management.\n\nBoard Leadership Structure\n\nOn June 16, 2011, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, Robert L. Evans, assumed the combined roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. While the Board believes that many factors influence the decision of whether the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer positions should be separate or combined and that these factors must be re-evaluated as the needs of the Company evolve, currently the Board of Directors believes that combining such roles is an efficient and effective leadership structure. The Chief Executive Officer is the director that is most familiar with the diverse business operations of the Company and is best situated to lead discussions on the important matters affecting the Company. In addition, this structure creates a firm link between the Companys management and its Board of Directors, and fosters clear accountability, effective decision making and alignment on corporate strategy. To assure effective independent oversight, the Board has adopted a number of governance practices, including: having a lead independent director (see below for a description of the lead independent director role), executive sessions of the independent directors after each Board meeting and annual performance evaluations of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer by the independent directors.\n\nNo less frequently than once every two years the Board will appoint a lead director from among its independent directors. On June 16, 2011, G. Watts Humphrey, Jr. was appointed as the lead independent director. The lead independent directors authority and responsibilities include: (i) presiding over all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including the executive sessions of the independent directors, (ii) serving as liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors, (iii) approving meeting agendas, schedules and information sent to the Board, (iv) the ability to call meetings of the independent directors, and (v) ex officio status on each committee of the Board that the lead independent director is not already a voting member.\n\nOversight of Company Risk\n\nAs part of its responsibility to oversee the management, business and strategy of the Company, the Board of Directors has overall responsibility for risk oversight. While the Board of Directors as a whole performs certain risk oversight functions directly, such as its ongoing review, approval and monitoring of the Companys fundamental business and financial strategies and major corporate actions, the majority of the Board of Directors\n\n15\n\nrisk oversight functions are carried out through the operation of its committees. Each committee oversees risk management within its assigned areas of responsibility, as described below in the discussion of committee responsibilities. The Audit Committee is primarily responsible for overseeing the Companys risk assessment and risk management practices, as well as its compliance programs. The Compensation Committees responsibilities include oversight of the risks associated with the Companys compensation policies and practices, as well as its managerial development and succession plans. The Nominating and Governance Committee oversees the risks related to the Companys corporate governance structure and processes.\n\nShare Ownership Guidelines\n\nThe Board expects all directors to display confidence in the Company by ownership of a meaningful amount of the Companys stock. As a result, each director is expected to own shares of the Companys stock with a fair market value equal to five (5) times the directors annual retainer. Each director who was serving as such on the date of adoption of the ownership guidelines (March 15, 2007) will have five (5) years from such date to meet this requirement and each director appointed or elected since such date will have five (5) years from the date of appointment or election to the Board to meet this requirement. Initial compliance was measured in March of 2012, the five (5) year anniversary date of the adoption of the ownership guidelines (for directors in office on March 15, 2007) and each director was in compliance with the policy. Each directors continuing compliance with the ownership guidelines will be measured in the year he or she stands for re-election and will be considered as one of the criteria for nomination by the Nominating and Governance Committee. Deferred shares acquired by directors under the Churchill Downs Incorporated 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and restricted stock units granted as director compensation may be included for purposes of measuring compliance with the Companys share ownership guidelines.\n\nBoard Meetings and Committees\n\nFive (5) meetings of the Board of Directors were held during the last fiscal year. All directors attended at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the meetings of the Board of Directors and the meetings of the committee(s) on which they served in 2011. The Company encourages its directors to attend the Annual Meeting each year. All directors attended the Companys Annual Meeting held on June 16, 2011.\n\nThe Board has determined that all of the directors of the Company are independent directors, as defined under NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2), except Robert L. Evans.\n\nAs required by the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board of Directors currently has four (4) standing committees: the Executive, Audit, Compensation and the Nominating and Governance Committees. No Director Emeritus serves on any Board committee.\n\nExecutive Committee\n\nThe Executive Committee is authorized, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Companys Amended and Restated Bylaws, to exercise the authority of the Board of Directors between Board meetings. The members of the Executive Committee are G. Watts Humphrey, Jr., who serves as Chairman, Michael B. Brodsky, Robert L. Fealy, and R. Alex Rankin. The Executive Committee does not meet on a regular basis, but instead meets as and when needed.\n\nThe Executive Committee did not hold any meetings during the last fiscal year.\n\n16\n\nAudit Committee\n\nThe primary purposes of the Audit Committee are to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibility in monitoring managements conduct of the Companys financial reporting process and overseeing the Companys risk assessment and risk management practices. Under its charter, the Audit Committee is generally responsible for monitoring the integrity of the financial reporting process, systems of internal controls and financial statements and other financial reports provided by the Company to any governmental or regulatory body, the public or other users thereof, as well as overseeing the processes by which management assesses the Companys exposure to risk and evaluating the guidelines and policies governing the Companys monitoring, control and minimization of such exposures. The Audit Committees responsibilities are as follows:\n\nThe officers of the Company responsible for risk assessment and risk management functions report directly to the Audit Committee on a periodic basis, such as the Companys internal auditor presenting its audit plan annually, and on a case by case basis as necessary.\n\nThe members of the Audit Committee are Daniel P. Harrington, who serves as Chairman, R. Alex Rankin, and Darrell R. Wells. The Companys Board of Directors has determined that all members of the Companys Audit Committee are independent as defined under NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2) and Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nFour (4) meetings of the Audit Committee were held during the last fiscal year. The Audit Committee reviews the adequacy of its charter on an annual basis.\n\nThe Board of Directors has determined that Daniel P. Harrington, who is independent as defined under NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2) and rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, is an audit committee financial expert as defined by regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nCompensation Committee\n\nResponsibilities of the Compensation Committee\n\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors operates under a written charter and is comprised entirely of directors meeting the independence requirements of NASDAQ. The Board established the Compensation Committee to discharge the Boards responsibilities relating to compensation of the Companys chief executive officer and each of the Companys other executive officers. The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for decisions relating to all compensation plans, policies and perquisites as they affect the chief executive officer (CEO) and other executive officers.\n\n17\n\nDuring 2011, the Compensation Committee was composed of four (4) independent directors, as defined by the NASDAQ listing standards, including three (3) Non-Employee Directors as defined in Rule 16b-3 of the rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Currently the members of the Compensation Committee are Leonard S. Coleman, Jr., who serves as Chairman; Craig J. Duchossois; James F. McDonald; and Darrell R. Wells. The Committee has created a special Subcommittee comprised of three Non-Employee Directors for the purposes of approving any stock grants or other stock related transactions to officers or directors of the Company, as required under Rule 16b-3. In addition, this Subcommittee is comprised only of outside directors as defined by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) and is responsible for approving all performance standards for officers for any pay program intended to qualify as performance based compensation under this section of the Code. The members of this special Subcommittee are Mr. Coleman, Mr. McDonald and Mr. Wells.\n\nSix (6) meetings of the Compensation Committee were held during the last fiscal year. Members of management attended each meeting. The agenda for each meeting was determined by the Chairman of the Compensation Committee with managements input prior to each meeting.\n\nThe Compensation Committees responsibilities are as follows:\n\n18\n\nThe Compensation Committees charter reflects these responsibilities, and the Compensation Committee and the Board periodically review and revise the charter.\n\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\n\nNone of the directors who served on the Compensation Committee at any time during the last fiscal year were officers of the Company or were former officers of the Company. None of the members who served on the Committee at any time during fiscal 2011 had any relationship with the Company requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. Finally, no executive officer of the Company serves, or in the past fiscal year has served, as a member of the compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions) of any entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving on the Committee.\n\nCompensation Risk Assessment\n\nThe Committee performed an assessment of whether risks arising from the Companys compensation policies and practices for all employees during 2011, including non-executive officers, are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Committee determined that the Companys compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\nNominating and Governance Committee\n\nThe Companys Nominating and Governance Committee operates under a written charter and is responsible for establishing the criteria for and reviewing the effectiveness of the Companys Board of Directors. In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee provides oversight with regard to the Companys programs for dealing with business ethics and other governance issues.\n\nPursuant to the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines and its Policy on Board Composition, the Nominating and Governance Committee determines criteria regarding personal qualifications needed for Board membership and the Committee considers, reviews qualifications and recommends qualified candidates for Board membership. In doing so, the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews the composition of the Board to identify skill sets and qualifications which are represented in order to determine which ones are needed. In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews the Companys strategic plan to determine its needs with regard to Board composition. While the Company does not have a formal policy on diversity for members of the Board of Directors, the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines and its Policy on Board Composition specifically provide that diversity of race and gender, as well as general diversity of backgrounds and experience represented on the Board of Directors are factors to consider in evaluating potential directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee sometimes employs an outside consultant to identify nominees with the skill sets, experience and backgrounds that suit the Companys needs.\n\nA candidate for the Companys Board of Directors should possess the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity and values and be committed to representing the long-term interests of the Companys various constituencies. In considering a candidate for nomination as a member of the Board, the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider criteria such as independence; occupational background, including principal occupation (i.e., chief executive officer, attorney, accountant, investment banker, or other pertinent occupation); level and type of business experience (i.e., financial, lending, investment, media, racing industry,\n\n19\n\ntechnology, etc.); diversity in race and gender; number of boards on which the individual serves; and the general diversity of backgrounds and experience represented on the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee periodically reviews the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines and its Policy on Board Composition and recommends changes to the Board. It also evaluates the performance of the Board as a whole and provides feedback to the Board on how the directors, the committees and the Board are functioning. Finally it evaluates Board of Director practices at the Company and other well-managed companies on an annual basis and recommends appropriate changes to the Board and/or its practices.\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee receives and considers issues raised by shareholders or other stakeholders in the Company and recommends appropriate responses to the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider recommendations for director candidates submitted by shareholders. Such questions, comments or recommendations should be submitted in writing to the Nominating and Governance Committee in care of the Office of the Secretary at 700 Central Avenue, Louisville, Kentucky 40208. The Nominating and Governance Committee, in having adopted criteria to be considered for membership on its Board, considers such candidates applying such criteria and follows the recommendation process noted above. Recommendations by shareholders that are made in accordance with these procedures will receive the same consideration as recommendations from other sources.\n\nThe members of the Nominating and Governance Committee, each of whom is independent as defined by the NASDAQ listing standards, are R. Alex Rankin, who serves as Chairman, Leonard S. Coleman, Jr., and Richard L. Duchossois.\n\nTwo (2) meetings of the Nominating and Governance Committee were held during the last fiscal year.\n\n20\n\nProposal to Ratify the Appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the\n\nCompanys Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2011\n\n(Proposal No. 2)\n\nOn March 8, 2012, the Companys Audit Committee selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) to serve as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2012. PwC has served as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm since the Companys 1990 fiscal year.\n\nAlthough the Companys Amended and Restated Bylaws do not require that the Companys shareholders ratify the appointment of PwC as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, the Board of Directors is submitting the appointment of PwC to the Companys shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting. If the appointment is not ratified, the Companys Audit Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Companys Audit Committee, in its sole discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.\n\nRepresentatives of PwC are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be available to respond to appropriate questions and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so.\n\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE RECOMMEND THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012.\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE INSTRUCTED, IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE PERSONS NAMED IN THE PROXY TO VOTE THE SHARES REPRESENTED THEREBY IN FAVOR OF THE PROPOSAL TO RATIFY THE APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012.\n\nAudit Fees\n\nThe audit fees incurred by the Company for services provided by PwC (i) for the year ended December 31, 2010, were $963,300 and (ii) for the year ended December 31, 2011, were $865,000. Audit fees include services related to the audit of the Companys consolidated financial statements, the audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, involvement with registration statement filings, statutory audits and consultations related to miscellaneous Securities and Exchange Commission and financial reporting matters.\n\nAudit-Related Fees\n\nDuring 2011, the Company incurred $104,390 in fees for assurance and related services performed by PwC that were reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Companys financial statements that are not reported in the preceding section.\n\nTax Fees\n\nTax fees incurred by the Company for services provided by PwC (i) in 2010, were $ 35,700, and (ii) in 2011, were $0. Tax fees include services related to tax return preparation for a related entity, tax consultation and tax advice.\n\n21\n\nAll Other Fees\n\nAll other fees incurred by the Company for services provided by PwC relate to the use of Comperio, PwCs accounting research software, which amounted to $1,500 in each of 2010 and 2011. The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with maintaining PwCs independence.\n\nThe Audit Committee has adopted a policy of evaluating pre-approval of services provided by the independent auditors on a case-by-case basis. The Audit Committee pre-approved all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditors in 2011.\n\nProposal to Approve the Performance Goals and Maximum Awards Payable\n\nUnder the Incentive Compensation Plan\n\n(Proposal No. 3)\n\nThe Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, its President and Chief Operating Officer and its Executive Vice Presidents, and certain other key employees designated by the Compensation Committee, are eligible to receive an annual cash incentive bonus under the Churchill Downs Incorporated Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan (1997) (the ICP or Incentive Compensation Plan). The Compensation Committee establishes various performance goals, the attainment of which entitles the participating employee to receive an annual bonus award. The amount of the award is a function of the participants base salary.\n\nAt its meeting in March 2012, the special Subcommittee of the Compensation Committee, which Subcommittee is comprised of members who are both non-employee directors for the purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and outside directors as defined by § 162(m) of the Code, established certain objective performance goals pursuant to which the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Robert L. Evans; the Companys President and Chief Operating Officer, William C. Carstanjen; the Companys Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, William E. Mudd; and the Companys Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Alan K. Tse; may receive a bonus award for fiscal year 2012 under the Incentive Compensation Plan if the performance goals applicable to each such executive officer are achieved. The performance goals set by the special Subcommittee of the Compensation Committee include the attainment of a pre-tax income target for the Company.\n\nThe special Subcommittee of the Compensation Committee has established certain additional objective performance goals related to individual performance for Mr. Evans, Mr. Mudd and Mr. Tse and has established certain additional objective performance goals related to both operating unit and individual performance for Mr. Carstanjen, in all cases related to the achievement of strategic initiatives and the improvement of core functional capabilities and business operations the specific details of which the special Subcommittee of the Compensation Committee has determined to be confidential business information, the disclosure of which would adversely affect the Company and its business. At the conclusion of the year, the special Subcommittee will make a determination whether the performance goals have been attained. The ultimate bonus award to be paid under the Incentive Compensation Plan will be determined by the extent to which each participating executive achieves each of the applicable performance goals established by the special Subcommittee of the Compensation Committee. The special Subcommittee of the Compensation Committee retains the discretion to reduce any award, notwithstanding the attainment of the applicable performance goals, based upon its determination of Mr. Evans, Mr. Carstanjens, Mr. Mudds, and Mr. Tses performance in meeting the applicable performance goals.\n\n22\n\nThe maximum dollar amount of bonus that may be awarded for each of Mr. Evans, Mr. Carstanjen, Mr. Mudd and Mr. Tse under the performance goals established by the special Subcommittee of the Compensation Committee are as follows:\n\nMr. Evans\n\n$ 1,100,000\n\nMr. Carstanjen\n\n$ 697,500\n\nMr. Mudd\n\n$ 588,000\n\nMr. Tse\n\n$ 348,000\n\nAny bonus earned for 2012 performance under the Incentive Compensation Plan will be payable on or prior to March 15, 2013. Under current U.S. tax law, the Company may deduct the amount of the bonus award paid to Mr. Evans, Mr. Carstanjen, Mr. Mudd and Mr. Tse to the extent that the deduction is not otherwise limited under Code §162(m). Under Code §162(m), compensation paid to any covered employee in excess of $1,000,000 in any taxable year is not deductible by the Company except to the extent such amount constitutes qualified performance-based compensation. Qualified performance-based compensation is compensation paid solely on account of the attainment of one or more performance goals if:\n\nAt the Annual Meeting, shareholders will be asked to approve the material terms of the performance goals and the maximum awards established by the special Subcommittee of the Compensation Committee for fiscal year 2012 for the payment of incentive compensation to Mr. Evans, Mr. Carstanjen, Mr. Mudd and Mr. Tse under the Incentive Compensation Plan. A vote in favor of this proposal will result in, subject to the satisfaction of Code §162(m), (i) the compensation payable to Mr. Evans, Mr. Carstanjen, Mr. Mudd and Mr. Tse under the Incentive Compensation Plan qualifying as performance-based compensation under Code §162(m), and (ii) the availability to the Company of a tax deduction in the amount of the compensation received by Mr. Evans, Mr. Carstanjen, Mr. Mudd and Mr. Tse pursuant to this annual incentive bonus. No bonus awards will be paid under the Incentive Compensation Plan if the Companys shareholders do not vote in favor of this proposal.\n\nApproval of the proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares casting votes in favor of or opposed to the proposal.\n\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS VOTE TO APPROVE THE PERFORMANCE GOALS AND THE MAXIMUM AWARDS PAYABLE AS ESTABLISHED BY THE SPECIAL SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION TO MR. EVANS, MR. CARSTANJEN, MR. MUDD AND MR. TSE UNDER THE CHURCHILL DOWNS INCORPORATED AMENDED AND RESTATED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN (1997).\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE INSTRUCTED, IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE PERSONS NAMED IN THE PROXY TO VOTE THE SHARES REPRESENTED THEREBY FOR THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE PERFORMANCE GOALS AND THE MAXIMUM AWARDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION TO MR. EVANS, MR. CARSTANJEN, MR. MUDD AND MR. TSE UNDER THE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN.\n\n23\n\nProposal to Approve the Performance Goals for\n\nPerformance-Based Awards under the\n\nChurchill Downs Incorporated Executive Annual Incentive Plan\n\n(Proposal No. 4)\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn March 8, 2012, the Board of Directors adopted the Churchill Downs Incorporated Executive Annual Incentive Plan (the Executive Annual Incentive Plan) to be effective January 1, 2013, subject to the approval of the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. The Executive Annual Incentive Plan is a cash-based incentive plan that is intended to replace the Companys Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan (1997). In order to qualify certain performance-based awards under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), the Company is asking its shareholders to approve the material terms of the performance goals under which performance-based awards are made under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan. The summary of the Executive Annual Incentive Plan contained in this proposal is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the plan which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Exhibit A.\n\nPurpose of Proposal\n\nThe Executive Annual Incentive Plan is designed to promote the Companys success and enhance its value by linking the interests of its participants to those of its shareholders and by providing participants with an incentive for outstanding performance. The Executive Annual Incentive Plan is further intended to provide flexibility in its ability to motivate, attract, and retain executive officers upon whose judgment, interest, and special efforts the Companys business is largely dependent.\n\nSection 162(m) of the Code limits the Companys federal income tax deduction for compensation paid in a taxable year to an individual who, on the last day of the taxable year, is (i) the principal executive officer or (ii) among the three highest compensated executive officers (other than the principal executive officer or the principal financial officer), i.e., the covered employees. Qualified performance-based compensation is not subject to this deduction limit and is thus fully deductible if certain conditions are met. One of these conditions is shareholder approval of the material terms of the performance goals under which the compensation is paid.\n\nQualification under Section 162(m) of the Code will allow the Company to treat otherwise performance-based compensation as being fully deductible for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Company seeks shareholder approval with respect to the material terms of the performance goals related to certain awards under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan.\n\nMaterial Terms of the Performance Goals\n\nThe material terms of the performance goals consist of (i) the class of employees eligible to receive awards under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan, (ii) the business criteria on which the performance goals are based, and (iii) the maximum dollar amount of incentive awards that can be paid to a participant in any calendar year.\n\nClass of Eligible Employees\n\nThe executive officers of the Company comprise the class of employees eligible to receive awards under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan. There are four individuals currently eligible to participate in the Executive Annual Incentive Plan.\n\nBusiness Criteria on Which the Performance Goals are Based\n\nThe business criteria on which the performance goals may be based under the Incentive Compensation Plan shall be based on one or more of the following business criteria (which may be determined for these purposes\n\n24\n\neither by reference to the Company as a whole or by reference to any one or more of its subsidiaries, operating divisions or other operating units): stock price; total shareholder returns; sales or revenues (whether in general, by type of product or service, or by type of customer); gross earnings; pre-tax income; operating income; earnings before interest and/or taxes; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and/or amortization; operating cash flow; free cash flow; net income; earnings per share; return measures (including pre-tax or after-tax, before or after depreciation and amortization) relating to return on assets, capital, investment, equity, sales or revenue; economic profit; economic value added; cost reductions and savings; productivity; market share; wagering handle; customer attendance measures; customer or employee satisfaction; financial ratios as provided in credit agreements of the Company and its affiliates; working capital targets, including net working capital, inventory, accounts payable, and accounts receivable measured in absolute terms or as turnover metrics (e.g., relative to sales or cost of goods sold, including number of days); completion of acquisitions of business or companies; completion of divestitures and asset sales; achievement of specified legislative or regulatory outcomes; completion of other material projects or any variation or combination of the preceding business criteria.\n\nMaximum Amount of Cash Incentive Awards that can be Paid to a Participant in any Calendar Year\n\nThe maximum aggregate amount with respect to cash incentive awards that may be paid under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan in any calendar year to any individual participant is $5,000,000.\n\nAdministration; Amendment and Termination\n\nThe Executive Annual Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may at any time amend or terminate the Executive Annual Incentive Plan (and the Compensation Committee may at any time amend the Executive Annual Incentive Plan), except that no termination or amendment may reduce the amount of a bonus payment that has been determined by the Compensation Committee to be due and payable, but has not yet been paid without the participants consent. No amendment to the Executive Annual Incentive Plan will be made without the approval of the shareholders to increase the amount of any bonus payable beyond the amount determined pursuant to the plan documents.\n\nVote Required\n\nIn order for this proposal to be adopted by the shareholders, at least a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy by the shareholders entitled to vote on the matter must be voted in its favor.\n\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE PERFORMANCE GOALS FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS UNDER THE EXECUTIVE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN.\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE INSTRUCTED, IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE PERSONS NAMED IN THE PROXY TO VOTE THE SHARES REPRESENTED THEREBY IN FAVOR OF THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE PERFORMANCE GOALS FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS UNDER THE EXECUTIVE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN.\n\nProposal to Approve the Amendment to the\n\nChurchill Downs Incorporated 2007 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan\n\nand Re-approval of Material Terms of Performance Goals Under Section 162(m) of the Code\n\n(Proposal No. 5)\n\nOverview\n\nThe Board of Directors adopted the Churchill Downs Incorporated 2007 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan) on March 15, 2007. On March 8, 2012, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the\n\n25\n\nBoard of Directors approved the amendment of the 2007 Plan described in this proposal, subject to shareholder approval. If approved by the stockholders, the amendment will increase, by 1 million shares, the number of shares of the Companys common stock available for issuance under the 2007 Plan.\n\nThe 2007 Plan is the only equity incentive compensation plan under which the Company is granting equity incentive awards, such as stock awards, to directors, officers and other employees. Approximately 237,438 shares remained available for issuance under the 2007 Plan as of March 8, 2012. This remaining amount is insufficient to meet the Companys equity compensation requirements during 2012 and beyond.\n\nWhy You Should Vote For the 2007 Plan Amendment and Re-approval of the Material Terms of the Performance Goals Under Section 162(m) of the Code\n\nThe Board of Directors believes that the 2007 Plan is important to the long-term success of the Company. The purpose of the 2007 Plan is to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified officers, members of the Board who are not employees (Nonemployee Directors) and key employees. The 2007 Plan is also intended to provide compensation that will be tax deductible by the Company without regard to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nThe 2007 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Awards made to Nonemployee Directors will be approved by the Board. Awards made to the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will be approved by the Compensation Committee. The 2007 Plan provides the Compensation Committee flexibility to design compensatory awards that are responsive to the Companys needs. Subject to the terms of the 2007 Plan, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine the terms of each award. The Committee may delegate to one or more officers of the Company the authority to grant awards to participants who are not directors or executive officers of the Company. The Committee must fix the total number of shares that may be subject to grants made under this delegation.\n\nThe Company believes its usage of the 2007 Plan illustrates its commitment to best practices in equity compensation, prudent use of these limited resources and the promotion of a strong alignment with shareholder interests.\n\nThe Company manages its use of equity incentive awards carefully and has maintained a reasonable run rate. The Compensation Committee carefully monitors the Companys total dilution, run rate and equity expense to ensure that it maximizes shareholder value and exercises prudence by granting only such number of equity awards as deemed necessary to attract, reward and retain employees. Run rate, a means of measuring annual stock dilution, shows how rapidly a company is deploying its shares reserved for issuance under its equity compensation plans. Run rate is defined as the number of shares subject to equity awards issued in a fiscal year as a percentage of the Companys weighted average shares outstanding. The higher the run rate, the greater the dilution. In the last three fiscal years, the Companys average annual run rate has been 2.8%, which is slightly below the median run rate of other companies of similar size in the same Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) industry group (Hotels, Restaurants and Leisure) and considerably lower than the 5.81% run rate used by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) to assess such companies.\n\nThe Companys equity overhang is substantially lower compared to similar companies. Overhang is an analysis of potential dilution to shareholders from the equity being transferred to employees via equity incentive plans. Overhang is defined as (i) stock awards and option awards outstanding and (ii) shares remaining available for grant as a percentage of the Companys weighted average shares outstanding. As of December 31, 2011, the Companys overhang was approximately 6.1% which is significantly below the median overhang of other companies of similar size in the same GICS industry group (Hotels, Restaurants and Leisure) of 13%. Upon approval of the amendment to the 2007 Plan, the Companys overhang will be 11.9%, which is still lower than such comparable companies as described above.\n\n26\n\nSection 162(m) of the Code limits publicly-held companies to an annual deduction for federal income tax purposes of $1 million for compensation paid to their covered employees. However, performance-based compensation is excluded from this limitation. The 2007 Plan is designed to permit the Compensation Committee to grant awards that qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of satisfying the conditions of Section 162(m). In order for the Company to be able to continue to have the flexibility to pay performance-based compensation that meets the requirements of Section 162(m) after the five-year anniversary of the initial approval of the 2007 Plan, the Company is also seeking re-approval of the material terms of the Section 162(m) performance goals under the 2007 Plan. The material terms of performance-based compensation are (i) eligibility for awards, (ii) individual grant limits on awards and (iii) the business criteria that can be used as performance grants for awards.\n\nThe amendment of the 2007 Plan will not be effective unless and until approved by shareholders. Participation and the types of awards under the 2007 Plan are subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee and, as a result, the benefits or amounts that will be received by any participant or groups of participants if the amendment of the 2007 Plan is approved are not currently determinable. Based on its historic compensation practices, the Company expects that a range of 20 to 30 persons annually will receive awards under the 2007 Plan.\n\nSummary Description of the 2007 Plan\n\nA description of the provisions of the 2007 Plan is set forth in question and answer format below.\n\nWho may participate?\n\nEmployees of the Company and its subsidiaries and Nonemployee Directors may be selected by the Compensation Committee to receive awards under the 2007 Plan. Approximately 3,300 employees and 10 non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the 2007 Plan.\n\nAre there limits on grants to individual participants or other grant limits?\n\nYes. No participant may receive awards during any one calendar year representing more than 300,000 shares of Common Stock or more than 7,500,000 performance units. A performance unit is defined in the plan document as a bookkeeping entry that records a unit equivalent to $1.00 awarded pursuant to the plan. If the amendment is approved, in no event will the number of shares of Common Stock issued under the plan upon the exercise of incentive stock options exceed 2,630,000 shares. Stock awards other than stock options will be counted against the maximum number of shares to be issued under the 2007 Plan in a 2-to-1 ratio. These limits are subject to adjustments by the Compensation Committee as provided in the 2007 Plan for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and other similar transactions or events.\n\nWhat types of awards may be granted?\n\nAwards under the 2007 Plan may be in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted share units, performance shares or performance units.\n\nUpon what terms may options be awarded?\n\nStock options entitle the optionee to purchase shares of Common Stock at a price equal to or greater than the fair market value on the date of grant. Options may be either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options, provided that only employees may be granted incentive stock options. The option may specify that the option price is payable (i) in cash, (ii) by the transfer to the Company of unrestricted stock, (iii) with any other legal consideration the Compensation Committee may deem appropriate or (iv) any combination of the foregoing. No stock option may be exercised more than ten (10) years from the date of grant. Each grant may specify a period of continuous employment or service with the Company or any subsidiary that is necessary before the stock option or any portion thereof will become exercisable and may provide for the earlier exercise of the option in the event of a change in control of the Company or similar event.\n\n27\n\nUpon what terms may stock appreciation rights be granted?\n\nStock appreciation rights represent the right to receive an amount, determined by the Compensation Committee and expressed as a percentage not exceeding 100%, of the difference between the base price established for such rights and the fair market value of the Companys Common Stock on the date the rights are exercised. The base price must not be less than the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date the right is granted. The grant may specify that the amount payable upon exercise of the stock appreciation right may be paid by the Company (i) in cash, (ii) in shares of the Companys Common Stock or (iii) any combination of the foregoing. Any grant may specify a waiting period or periods before the stock appreciation rights may become exercisable and permissible dates or periods on or during which the stock appreciation rights shall be exercisable, and may specify that the stock appreciation rights may be exercised only in the event of a change in control of the Company or similar event. The Committee may grant tandem stock appreciation awards in connection with an option or free-standing stock appreciation awards unrelated to an option. No stock appreciation right may be exercised more than ten (10) years from the date of grant and each grant of a free-standing stock appreciation right must specify the period of continuous employment or service that is necessary before the free-standing stock appreciation right or installments thereof may be exercisable.\n\nUpon what terms may restricted stock be awarded?\n\nAn award of restricted stock involves the immediate transfer by the Company to a participant of ownership of a specific number of shares of Common Stock in return for the performance of services. The participant is entitled immediately to voting, dividend and other ownership rights in such shares, subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee to not include any of such rights during the restriction period. The transfer may be made without additional consideration from the participant. The Committee may specify performance objectives that must be achieved for the restrictions to lapse. Restricted stock must be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of Code Section 83 for a period to be determined by the Committee on the grant date and any grant or sale may provide for the earlier termination of such risk of forfeiture in the event of a change of control of the Company or similar event.\n\nUpon what terms may restricted share units be granted?\n\nAn award of restricted share units granted under the 2007 Plan represents the right to receive a specific number of shares at the end of a specified deferral period. Any grant of restricted share units may be further conditioned upon the attainment of performance objectives. The grant may provide for the early termination of the deferral period in the event of a change in control of the Company or similar event. During the deferral period, the participant is not entitled to vote or receive dividends on the shares subject to the award, but the Compensation Committee may provide for the payment of dividend equivalents on a current or deferred basis. The grant of restricted share units may be made without any consideration from the participant other than the performance of future services.\n\nUpon what terms may performance shares and units be granted?\n\nA performance share is the equivalent of one share of Common Stock, and a performance unit is the equivalent of $1.00. Each grant will specify one or more performance objectives to be met within a specified period (the performance period), which may be subject to earlier termination in the event of a change in control of the Company or a similar event. If by the end of the performance period the participant has achieved the specified performance objectives, the participant will be deemed to have fully earned the performance shares or performance units. If the participant has not achieved the level of acceptable achievement, the participant may be deemed to have partly earned the performance shares or performance units in accordance with a predetermined formula. To the extent earned, the performance shares or performance units will be paid to the participant at the time and in the manner determined by the Compensation Committee in cash, shares of the Companys Common Stock or any combination thereof.\n\n28\n\nWhat is the section 162(m) exemption?\n\nCode Section 162(m) prevents a publicly held corporation from claiming income tax deductions for compensation in excess of $1,000,000 paid to certain senior executives. Compensation is exempt from this limitation if it is qualified performance-based compensation. Stock options and stock appreciation rights are two examples of performance-based compensation. Other types of awards, such as restricted stock, deferred shares and performance shares, that are granted pursuant to pre-established objective performance formulas, may also qualify as performance-based compensation, so long as certain requirements are met, including the prior approval by shareholders of the performance formulas or measures.\n\nWhat are the performance objectives?\n\nThe 2007 Plan provides that grants of performance shares, performance units or, when determined by the Compensation Committee, options, restricted share units, restricted stock or other stock-based awards may be made based upon performance objectives. Performance objectives applicable to awards that are intended to be exempt from the limitations of Code Section 162(m) are limited to specified levels of or increases in the Companys or subsidiarys return on equity, earnings from continuing operations, earnings from continuing operations before interest and taxes, earnings per share from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), net earnings per share, diluted earnings per share, total earnings, earnings growth, return on capital, cost of capital, return on assets, return on investment, return"
