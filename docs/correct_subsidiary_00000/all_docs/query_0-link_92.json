BUSINESS\n\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the\n\nmeaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section\n\n21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Predictions of future\n\nevents are inherently uncertain. Actual events could differ materially from\n\nthose predicted in the forward-looking statements as a result of the risks set\n\nforth in the following discussion and, in particular, the risks discussed below\n\nin Item 7 under the caption \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial\n\nCondition and Results of Operation--Factors that May Affect Operating Results.\"\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a leading provider of e-business infrastructure software products\n\nthat enable business-to-business, business-to-consumer and business-to-employee\n\nsolutions. Our software products enable businesses to link internal operations,\n\nbusiness partners and customer channels in real time. Our software products\n\nallow multiple distinct applications, web sites, databases and other content\n\nsources to be integrated and managed within a common framework. Our products\n\nalso enable enterprises to extend their information technology infrastructures\n\nand business processes across the Internet to conduct all forms of electronic\n\nbusiness using the Internet: business-to-business, business-to-consumer and\n\nbusiness-to-employee. Our core technology, known as The Information Bus(TM) or\n\nthe TIB(TM), is software that enables enterprises and users to automatically\n\ntransmit, receive, filter and personalize digital information in real-time. The\n\nInformation Bus also facilitates real-time, two-way communications between\n\napplications across distributed computer networks and mobile information\n\ndevices such as hand-held computers, pagers and digital cellular phones. Our\n\nproducts are currently in use by over 1,000 companies in diverse markets such\n\nas telecommunications, manufacturing, energy, financial services and Internet\n\nportals.\n\nDriven by accelerating competition and the increasing demands of customers,\n\nmany enterprises today are seeking to expand and improve the scope, speed and\n\nefficiency of their business processes by using the Internet to become e-\n\nbusinesses. A company conducting e-businesses engages in one or more of the\n\nfollowing activities:\n\nIntegrates internal systems and business processes. Integrating business\n\nsystems is the foundation of e-business. Integrating applications and databases\n\nlets enterprises become more efficient by automating routine business\n\nprocesses.\n\nExtends its systems and processes to employees, customers and partners. When\n\nan enterprise becomes automated, it is important to maintain the human element\n\nby extending its processes to customers, partners and employees. Portals give\n\nusers personalized displays that let them monitor and interact with the\n\ninformation, processes and transactions that are processed by the systems\n\nconnected to the portal.\n\nConnects its systems and processes with other businesses. Another\n\nfundamental aspect of e-business is the connection that it enables between\n\nenterprises. The interconnection and cross-company process automation of B2B\n\ncommerce brings buyers and sellers together, enabling the real-time, \"straight-\n\nthrough\" processing of transactions.\n\nOur solution allows multiple computer applications and platforms to\n\ncommunicate in real-time across the Internet and intranets. The TIB technology\n\nfacilitates the distribution of information and the integration of business\n\nprocesses by connecting each application to the network through a single\n\ninterface, instead of linking each application directly to all others. The\n\nbenefits of the TIB technology are realized through our integrated suite of\n\nsoftware products. These products provide support for a broad range of key e-\n\nbusiness technologies such as eXtensible Markup Language, or XML, an emerging\n\nstandard for sharing data over the Internet, and related XML, e-commerce\n\nframeworks, such as RosettaNet.\n\n3\n\nOur objective is to establish the TIB technology as the leading software\n\nsolution for e-business infrastructure. The core elements of our strategy\n\ninclude promoting the widespread adoption of our technology, pursuing a license\n\ndriven business strategy, leveraging our vertical market expertise,\n\ncapitalizing on the presence of Reuters, our major stockholder, in the\n\nfinancial services industry, expanding our international presence and\n\ncontinuing to enhance our technology and products.\n\nThe TIB Products\n\nOur product set includes literally dozens of applications and technologies\n\nthat solve very fine-grained technical challenges. To present these products as\n\neasily-understandable business solutions, we package them in product lines that\n\naddress each of the key challenges mentioned above. All of our products can be\n\nsold as individual pieces to solve specific technical challenges that a\n\nbusiness may be facing, but the emphasis of our sales efforts is to sell them\n\nas a complete solution that solves an entire business problem. Our four product\n\nlines are:\n\n. TIBCO ActiveEnterprise(TM), an Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)\n\nplatform that lets applications talk to each other in real-time and\n\nautomates business processes.\n\n. TIBCO ActivePortal(TM), a portal infrastructure platform that lets people\n\ninteract with systems and information using the Web and wireless devices.\n\n. TIBCO ActiveExchange(TM), a B2B Integration (B2Bi) platform that lets\n\nbusinesses automate transactions and processes with other companies.\n\n. TIBCO Extensibility(TM), a platform that lets businesses efficiently\n\nmanage XML documents and business objects, as well as the rules that\n\ndefine those documents and objects.\n\nTIBCO ActiveEnterprise\n\nIntegrating all of the disparate applications, databases and business\n\nprocesses that it takes to make an entire company run is complex. Turning a set\n\nof disconnected applications and sub-processes into a cohesive system, however,\n\ncan dramatically improve the way a business works. TIBCO ActiveEnterprise does\n\nthis by performing the following functions:\n\nApplication-to-Application Communications: TIBCO ActiveEnterprise routes\n\ninformation through businesses by connecting enterprise applications and\n\ninformation sources. It enables real-time communications among CRM, ERP and e-\n\nprocurement applications, databases and mainframes, and even home-grown and\n\nlegacy applications and information sources.\n\nBusiness Process Automation: TIBCO ActiveEnterprise automates complete\n\nbusiness processes by automating electronic tasks and managing the workflow of\n\ntasks performed by people.\n\nSystem Monitoring and Management: TIBCO ActiveEnterprise lets businesses\n\nremotely monitor and manage hardware and software assets to help them keep\n\ntheir systems up-and-running 24 hours a day.\n\nTIBCO ActivePortal\n\nBy giving customers, suppliers, and employees the ability to interact with\n\nsystems through portals, businesses can improve loyalty and retention. TIBCO\n\nActivePortal lets businesses do this by performing the following functions:\n\nAggregation of Content & Services: TIBCO ActivePortal aggregates content and\n\nservices from a wide range of sources and gives users access to it through a\n\nsingle convenient interface.\n\nAnytime, Anywhere Access: TIBCO ActivePortal lets users retrieve information\n\nand interact with systems not only through the Web, but also through wireless\n\ndevices such as pagers, WAP-enabled phones and PDAs. It also delivers real-time\n\nalerts to users based on predefined events.\n\n4\n\nUser Management and Personalization: TIBCO ActivePortal lets companies\n\ncontrol which information and services are available to each user, and lets\n\neach of those users create their own custom interfaces. This enables businesses\n\nto efficiently target communications at individual users, and lets users create\n\ntheir own most efficient means of interacting with the business.\n\nTIBCO ActiveExchange\n\nThe first benefit of B2B integration is improving the execution of existing\n\nbusiness processes. The second benefit is doing entirely new things by\n\nautomating interactions with other businesses, making those interactions more\n\ndynamic and collaborative. TIBCO ActiveExchange lets businesses do both by\n\nperforming the following functions:\n\nAutomating Business Processes with Partners: TIBCO ActiveExchange automates\n\nbusiness processes between companies such as the placement of a purchase order,\n\nthe return of excess inventory, or the act of updating a catalog entry. The\n\nbasic building block of this functionality is the secure exchange of documents\n\nover the Internet, but the automation of the process by which those documents\n\nare exchanged is where the most benefit is found.\n\nEnhancing Interaction with Partners of All Sizes: TIBCO ActiveExchange lets\n\nbusinesses establish process-based relationships with other large enterprises,\n\nand also lets them interact with smaller partners in basic business document\n\nexchange-oriented relationships. This lets them efficiently expand their\n\nnetwork of trading partners to include companies of all sizes around the world.\n\nEnsure the Security of B2B Interactions: TIBCO ActiveExchange provides\n\nsecurity mechanisms that help ensure the security of interactions, and supports\n\nmany leading standards and data formats.\n\nTIBCO Extensibility\n\nOne of the benefits of integrating all of a businesses' applications and\n\ndata sources is that it enables the business to more efficiently manage\n\nbusiness documents because business documents are now shared resources on the\n\nnetwork instead of inaccessible objects maintained by specific applications in\n\ntheir own data format. TIBCO Extensibility gives businesses the tools they need\n\nto efficiently and securely manage these shared and publicly accessible\n\ndocument formats, including XML and related formats and standards such as CXML,\n\nXML Schema, SOX and RosettaNet.\n\nServices\n\nProfessional Services\n\nOur professional services offerings include a wide range of consulting\n\nservices such as systems planning, architecture and design, custom development\n\nand systems integration for the rapid deployment of our TIB products. We offer\n\nprofessional services with the initial deployment of our products, as well as\n\non an ongoing basis to address the continuing needs of our customers. Our\n\nprofessional services staff is primarily located in Palo Alto, London and\n\nSydney, enabling us to perform installations and respond to customer demands\n\nrapidly across the Americas, Europe and Asia. As of November 30, 2000, our\n\nprofessional services group consisted of 145 employees, including individuals\n\nwith domain expertise in the telecommunications, energy and other industries.\n\nMany of our professional services employees have advanced degrees and/or\n\nsubstantial industry expertise in systems architecture and design. We expect\n\nthat the number of service professionals and the scope of the services offered\n\nwill increase as we continue to address the expanding e-business infrastructure\n\nneeds of large organizations.\n\nWe also have relationships with resellers, professional service\n\norganizations and system integrators, including Deloitte Consulting, Accenture,\n\nCap Gemini/Ernst & Young, KPMG and Sapient, to cooperate in the\n\n5\n\ndeployment of our products to customers. These relationships help promote our\n\nTIB products and provide additional technical expertise to enable us to provide\n\nthe full range of professional services our customers require to deploy our\n\nproducts.\n\nMaintenance and Support\n\nWe offer an array of software maintenance and support services to our\n\ncustomers. Our support organization provides services seven days a week,\n\ntwenty-four hours a day. We have a worldwide support organization with key\n\noperations centers in Palo Alto, Cambridge (Massachusetts), Chapel Hill, London\n\nand Sydney to ensure global coverage for our customers. These centers provide\n\nthe infrastructure for our around-the-clock call centers and hotline support.\n\nWe offer a range of support packages that allow our customers to choose the\n\nlevel of support that fits the needs and budgets of their organizations.\n\nCustomers also have access to on-site support which is charged on a time and\n\nmaterials basis.\n\nTraining\n\nWe provide training for customer personnel at our main office in Palo Alto\n\nand in training centers in Cambridge (Massachusetts), Oxford and Sydney as well\n\nas at customer locations. We also provide training for our professional\n\nservices partners to enhance their effectiveness in integrating our products.\n\nIn addition, we develop custom education programs to address the specific needs\n\nof individual customers and partners.\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales\n\nWe currently market our software and services primarily through a direct\n\nsales organization, complemented by indirect sales channels. As of November 30,\n\n2000, our direct sales force included 78 commissioned sales professionals\n\nlocated in twenty-one U.S. cities and in eighteen locations internationally\n\nacross North America, Latin America, Europe, Australia and Asia. We have\n\nestablished distribution and licensing relationships with several strategic\n\nhardware vendors, database providers, software and toolset developers, systems\n\nintegrators and implementation consultants. We have also developed alliances\n\nwith key solution providers to target vertical industry sectors, including\n\nenergy, telecommunications, manufacturing and Internet portals.\n\nUnder the terms of our license agreement with Reuters, we generally cannot\n\nsell our products directly into the financial services market. Accordingly, we\n\ngenerally sell our products to companies in the financial services industry\n\nthrough third-party distributors and systems integrators. Reuters is the\n\npreferred distributor of our products in that market. The distribution\n\nrelationship with Reuters, a global news and information group, accounted for\n\n15%, 19% and 8% of our total revenue in fiscal 1998, 1999 and 2000,\n\nrespectively.\n\nMarketing\n\nWe utilize a wide variety of marketing programs which are intended to\n\nattract potential customers and to promote TIBCO Software(TM) and its brand\n\nnames. We use a mix of market research, analyst updates, seminars, direct mail,\n\nprint advertising, trade shows, speaking engagements, public relations,\n\ncustomer newsletters, and web site marketing in order to achieve these goals.\n\nOur marketing department also produces collateral material for distribution to\n\npotential customers including presentation materials, white papers, brochures,\n\nand fact sheets. We also host annual user conferences for our customers and\n\nprovide support to our channel partners with a variety of programs and training\n\nand product marketing support materials.\n\n6\n\nProduct Development\n\nWe have been granted a perpetual, royalty-free license to the underlying TIB\n\nmessaging technology as it existed on December 31, 1996. We have concentrated\n\nour product development efforts since then both on enhancing this licensed\n\ntechnology and on developing new products. We expect that most of our\n\nenhancements to existing products and new products will be developed\n\ninternally. However, we will evaluate on an ongoing basis the acquisition of\n\nexternally developed technologies for integration into our product lines.\n\nWe expect that a substantial majority of our research and development\n\nactivities will focus on enhancing and extending our TIB products.\n\nHistorically, our products development efforts were focused on creating our\n\ncore product solutions. Our development focus has now shifted to expanding the\n\nnumber of available TIB/Adapters,(TM) by which applications are connected to\n\nthe TIB environment, and developing additional packaged integration solutions\n\nfor specific markets.\n\nAs of November 30, 2000, there were 239 employees in our research and\n\ndevelopment organization. We expect that we will continue to commit significant\n\nresources to product development in the future. To date, all product\n\ndevelopment costs have been expensed as incurred.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe market for our products and services is extremely competitive and\n\nsubject to rapid change. While we offer a comprehensive suite of application\n\nintegration solutions, we compete with various providers of more limited\n\napplication integration products including IBM, New Era of Networks, Mercator,\n\nSeeBeyond, Iona, Vitria and CrossWorlds. We believe that of these companies,\n\nIBM has the potential to offer the most complete set of products for\n\napplication integration. We also compete in certain product areas with e-\n\nbusiness connectivity companies such as WebMethods and other emerging\n\ncompanies. We expect additional competition from other established and emerging\n\ncompanies. In addition, we may face pricing pressures from our current\n\ncompetitors and new market entrants in the future. We believe that the\n\ncompetitive factors affecting the market for our products and services include\n\nproduct functionality and features; quality of professional services offerings;\n\nperformance and price; ease of product implementation; quality of customer\n\nsupport services; customer training and documentation; and vendor and product\n\nreputation. The relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the\n\nspecific customer environment. Although we believe that our products and\n\nservices currently compete favorably with respect to such factors, we may not\n\nbe able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential\n\ncompetitors.\n\nMany of our current and potential competitors have longer operating\n\nhistories, significantly greater financial, technical, product development and\n\nmarketing resources, greater name recognition and larger customer bases than we\n\ndo. Our present or future competitors may be able to develop products\n\ncomparable or superior to those we offer, adapt more quickly than we do to new\n\ntechnologies, evolving industry trends or customer requirements, or devote\n\ngreater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than\n\nwe do. Accordingly, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets,\n\nor competition may intensify and harm our business and operating results. If we\n\nare not successful in developing enhancements to existing products and new\n\nproducts in a timely manner, achieving customer acceptance or generating higher\n\naverage licensing prices, our gross margins may decline, and our business and\n\noperating results may suffer.\n\nOur license agreement with Reuters does not prohibit Reuters from providing\n\nenterprise infrastructure software products and services in competition with\n\nus. Reuters currently sells our products to financial services companies and\n\ncreates products based on the TIB technology specifically for financial service\n\ncompanies. In addition, pursuant to the license agreement, Reuters has access\n\nto the source code for our products. Although Reuters currently does not create\n\nTIB-based products designed for general use in all markets, if Reuters were to\n\ndecide to begin providing information integration products and services in our\n\nmarkets, we would face additional competition for customers in these markets.\n\n7\n\nProprietary Technology\n\nOur success is dependent upon our proprietary software technology. We\n\nlicense the patents for the TIB technology underlying some of our TIB products,\n\nincluding TIB/Rendezvous(TM), from Reuters. Consequently, we can assert\n\ninfringement of these products only through Reuters or with the consent of\n\nReuters. While we have pending patent applications, we do not currently have\n\nany issued patents and rely principally on trade secret, copyright and\n\ntrademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements to protect our\n\ntechnology. We also believe that factors such as the technological and creative\n\nskills of our personnel, product enhancements and new product developments are\n\nessential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. We\n\nenter into confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees,\n\ndistributors and customers, and limit access to and distribution of our\n\nsoftware, documentation and other proprietary information. Nevertheless, the\n\nsteps we have taken may fail to prevent misappropriation of our technology, and\n\nthe protections we have may not prevent our competitors from developing\n\nproducts with functionality or features similar to our products. Furthermore,\n\nthird parties might independently develop competing technologies that are\n\nsubstantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. In addition,\n\neffective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited\n\nin certain foreign countries. If we fail to protect our proprietary technology,\n\nour business could be seriously harmed.\n\nAlthough we do not believe our products infringe the proprietary rights of\n\nany third parties, third parties may nevertheless assert infringement claims\n\nagainst us or our customers in the future. Furthermore, we may initiate claims\n\nor litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights\n\nor to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Litigation, whether\n\nresolved in our favor or not, would cause us to incur substantial costs and\n\ndivert our management resources from productive tasks, which could harm our\n\nbusiness. Parties making claims against us could secure substantial damages, as\n\nwell as injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our\n\nability to license our products in the United States or abroad. Such a judgment\n\ncould seriously harm our business. If it appears necessary or desirable, we may\n\nseek licenses to intellectual property if we believe that our technology\n\npotentially infringes on such technology. We may not, however, be able to\n\nobtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and the terms\n\nof any offered licenses might not be acceptable to us. The failure to obtain\n\nnecessary licenses or other rights could seriously harm our business. As the\n\nnumber of software products in our industry increases and the functionality of\n\nthose products further overlaps, we believe that software developers may become\n\nincreasingly subject to infringement claims. Any such claims, with or without\n\nmerit, would probably be time consuming and expensive to defend, and could\n\nseriously harm our business. We are not aware of any currently pending claims\n\nthat our products, trademarks or other proprietary rights infringe upon the\n\nproprietary rights of third parties.\n\n\"TIBCO\", \"Information Bus\", \"TIB\", \"TIBCO ActiveEnterprise\", \"TIBCO\n\nActivePortal\", TIBCO ActiveExchange\", \"TIBCO Extensibility\", \"TIB/Adapters\",\n\n\"TIB/Rendezvous\" and \"TIBCO Software\" and the names of our products are our\n\ntrademarks or tradenames.\n\nEmployees\n\nAs of November 30, 2000, we employed 934 persons, including 298 sales and\n\nmarketing, 239 in research and development, 129 in finance and administration\n\nand 268 in professional services and technical support. Of our 934 employees,\n\n140 were located in Europe, and 75 in Australia and Asia. We believe that our\n\nrelationship with our employees is good.\n\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur principal administrative, sales, marketing and service development\n\nfacilities are located in an approximately 92,000 square foot building and an\n\napproximately 96,675 square foot building, each in Palo Alto, California. We\n\nhold these buildings pursuant to leases which expire in 2005 and at the end of\n\n2010, respectively. In addition, we lease field support offices in 41 cities\n\nthroughout the world. The field offices range from small executive offices to a\n\n19,448 square foot facility. Lease terms range from month-to-month on\n\n8\n\ncertain executive offices to eleven years on certain direct leases. Because our\n\nprofessional services are generally performed at the client site, field\n\nfacilities are generally small. Field facilities are generally used for\n\nperiodic meetings, training and administration and by account managers. We have\n\nfield facilities in Atlanta, Georgia; Bethesda, Maryland; Brussels, Belgium;\n\nCalgary, Canada; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Chapel Hill, North Carolina;\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina; Chicago, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Dallas, Texas;\n\nDenver, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Dusseldorf, Germany; Houston, Texas;\n\nIrvine, California; Lima, Peru; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Melbourne,\n\nAustralia; Memphis, Tennessee; Mexico City, Mexico; Miami, Florida;\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota; Munich, Germany; New York, New York; Orlando, Florida;\n\nOslo, Norway; Ottawa, Canada; Paris, France; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Rome,\n\nItaly; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington;\n\nSingapore, Singapore; Seoul, Korea; Stockholm, Sweden; Sydney, Australia;\n\nTaipei, Taiwan; Tokyo, Japan; Toronto, Canada and Woy Woy, Australia. We are\n\ncontinually evaluating the adequacy of existing facilities and facilities in\n\nnew cities, and we believe that suitable additional space will be available in\n\nthe future on commercially reasonable terms as needed.\n\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nWe are not party to any material legal proceedings.\n\nITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS\n\nNo matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth\n\nquarter of fiscal 2000.\n\n9\n\nPART II\n\nITEM 5.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n\nOF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve\n\nrisks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those\n\nanticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors,\n\nincluding those set forth below in \"Factors That May Affect Operating Results\".\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated\n\nfinancial statements and related notes that appear beginning on page F-3.\n\nWe are a leading provider of e-business infrastructure software products\n\nthat enable business-to-business, business-to-consumer and business-to-employee\n\nsolutions. We are the successor to a portion of the business of Teknekron\n\nSoftware Systems, Inc. Teknekron developed software, known as the TIB\n\ntechnology, for the integration and delivery of market data, such as stock\n\nquotes, news and other financial information, in trading rooms of large banks\n\nand financial services institutions. In 1992, Teknekron expanded its\n\ndevelopment efforts to include solutions designed to enable complex and\n\ndisparate manufacturing equipment and software applications--primarily in the\n\nsemiconductor fabrication market--to communicate within the factory\n\nenvironment. Teknekron was acquired by Reuters Group PLC, the global news and\n\ninformation group, in 1994. Following the acquisition, continued development of\n\nthe TIB technology was undertaken to expand its use in the financial services\n\nmarkets.\n\nIn January 1997, our company, TIBCO Software Inc., was established as an\n\nentity separate from Teknekron. We were formed to create and market software\n\nsolutions for use in the integration of business information, processes and\n\napplications in diverse markets and industries outside the financial services\n\nsector. In connection with our establishment as a separate entity, Reuters\n\ntransferred to us certain assets and liabilities related to our business and\n\ngranted to us a royalty-free license to the intellectual property incorporated\n\ninto some of our current software products. Reuters also assigned to us at that\n\ntime license and service contracts primarily within the high-tech manufacturing\n\nand energy markets, including contracts with NEC, Motorola, Mobil and Chevron.\n\nOur software products enable businesses to link internal operations,\n\nbusiness partners and customer channels in real time. Our software products\n\nallow multiple distinct applications, web sites, databases and other content\n\nsources to be integrated and managed within a common framework. Our products\n\nalso enable enterprises to extend their information technology infrastructures\n\nand business processes across the Internet to conduct all forms of electronic\n\nbusiness using the Internet: business-to-business, business-to-consumer and\n\nbusiness-to-employee. Our core technology, known as The Information Bus or the\n\nTIB, is software that enables enterprises and users to automatically transmit,\n\nreceive, filter and personalize digital information in real-time. The\n\nInformation Bus also facilitates real-time, two-way communications between\n\napplications across distributed computer networks and mobile information\n\ndevices such as hand-held computers, pagers and digital cellular phones. Our\n\nproducts are currently in use by over 1,000 companies in diverse markets such\n\nas telecommunications, manufacturing, energy, financial services and Internet\n\nportals.\n\nDuring fiscal 1998, we expanded our product development activities and\n\ncontinued to invest in creating a product marketing organization, engaging in\n\nadvertising programs to build our corporate brand identity. We also built our\n\ndomestic and international direct sales force and created a general and\n\nadministrative infrastructure. During the second half of fiscal 1998, we began\n\ninitial shipments of our TIBCO ActiveEnterprise products, to companies such as\n\nPageNet, Philips Medical, Compaq and 3Com. We also formally introduced our\n\nTIBCO.net product and service offering for creating and managing e-business\n\nactivities, and generated revenue from Yahoo! and Netscape for enabling their\n\nstock quotation services. During fiscal 1999, we added approximately 200 new\n\ncustomers for our TIBCO ActiveEnterprise and TIBCO.net products, and we\n\nstrengthened our position in our key vertical markets--telecommunication,\n\nInternet portals, manufacturing, energy and financial services. New customers\n\nincluded AT&T, AltaVista, AOL/Netscape, Procter and Gamble, SAP, Philips,\n\nEnron, Chemdex, FT.com, Ericsson, Siemens, Williams Communications\n\n13\n\nand Sprint. We also established and strengthened strategic relationships with\n\nleading companies aimed at providing complementary business to business e-\n\ncommerce and Internet solutions. These companies included Ariba, Cisco Systems,\n\nOracle, Sun Microsystems, SAP, Yahoo! Portal Software, AvantGo, Deloitte\n\nConsulting, Selectica, i2 Technologies, Siebel Systems, and Sybase. We also\n\nreleased the TIB/PortalBuilder, a product for the creation and management of\n\nportals. During fiscal 2000, we continued to focus on strengthening our\n\nposition in our significant vertical markets and our relationships with major\n\nsystem integrators such a KPMG, Cap Gemini/ Ernst & Young and Deloitte &\n\nTouche. We also introduced our TIBCO ActiveExchange product suite, which is\n\nused to more dynamically and collaboratively automate interactions among\n\nbusinesses. In addition, we added more than 300 new customers during fiscal\n\n2000, including such industry leaders as Agilent, El Paso Energy, Schering\n\nPlough, Enron Corporation, and The Limited.\n\nOur revenue in fiscal 1999 and 2000 consisted primarily of license and\n\nproduct fees from our customers and distributors, including from Reuters\n\npursuant to our license agreement with it, both of which were primarily\n\nattributable to sales of our TIBCO ActiveEnterprise product suite. In addition,\n\nwe receive fees from our customers for providing project integration services.\n\nWe also receive revenue from our TIBCO.net customers. Revenue from these\n\ncustomers is a combination of fixed service charges, a percentage of the\n\nadvertising fees generated from their TIBCO.net-enabled web pages and a charge\n\nfor each user visit to these web pages. We also receive revenues from our\n\nstrategic relationships with business partners who embed our products in their\n\nhardware and networking systems as well as from systems integrators who resell\n\nour products.\n\nWe recognize license revenue when a signed contract or other persuasive\n\nevidence of an arrangement exists, the software has been shipped or\n\nelectronically delivered, the license fee is fixed or determinable, and\n\ncollection of the resulting receivable is probable. When contracts contain\n\nmultiple elements wherein vendor specific objective evidence exists for all\n\nundelivered elements, we account for the delivered elements in accordance with\n\nthe \"Residual Method\" prescribed by SOP 98-9. Any maintenance revenue included\n\nin these arrangements is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.\n\nRevenue from subscription license agreements, which include software, rights to\n\nfuture products and maintenance, is recognized ratably over the term of the\n\nsubscription period. Revenue on shipments to resellers, which is generally\n\nsubject to certain rights of return and price protection, is recognized when\n\nthe products are sold by the resellers to the end-user customer.\n\nWe recognize service revenue as the services are performed or on the\n\npercentage-of-completion method of accounting, depending on the nature of the\n\nproject. Under the percentage-of-completion method, revenue recognized is that\n\nportion of the total contract price equal to the ratio of costs expended to\n\ndate to the anticipated final total costs, based on current estimates of the\n\ncosts to complete the project. To the extent that these arrangements include\n\nlicense fees, such fees are recorded as license revenue based on the\n\npercentage-of-completion ratio. If the total estimated costs to complete a\n\nproject exceed the total contract amount, indicating a loss, the entire\n\nanticipated loss would be recognized currently.\n\nOur distributors generally pay us negotiated royalties on their sales of our\n\nproducts. Reuters distributes our products to customers in the financial\n\nservices market segment. Through December 2001, Reuters must pay us product\n\nfees based on a percentage of the revenue it derives from the sale of licenses\n\nand maintenance for our products. Under our license agreement with Reuters,\n\nminimum guaranteed product fees were $16 million in calendar 1999 and $18\n\nmillion in calendar 2000 and are $20 million in calendar 2001. We recognized\n\n$18.3 million in fees from Reuters in fiscal 2000. We will recognize revenue in\n\nthe amount of these guaranteed product fees ratably over the contractual\n\nperiod. In any period where actual product fees exceed the minimum guaranteed\n\nproduct fees for the year, the actual product fees and cumulative minimum\n\nguaranteed product fees will be recognized as revenue.\n\n14\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial\n\ninformation as a percentage of total revenue:\n\nYear Ended\n\nNovember 30,\n\n------------------\n\n2000 1999 1998\n\n---- ---- ----\n\nRevenue:\n\nLicense revenue....................................... 72% 59% 33%\n\nService and maintenance revenue....................... 28 41 67\n\n--- --- ---\n\nTotal revenue....................................... 100 100 100\n\n--- --- ---\n\nCost of revenue.........................................\n\nStock-based compensation.............................. 1 1 1\n\nCost of revenue....................................... 24 38 52\n\n--- --- ---\n\nGross profit............................................ 75 61 47\n\n--- --- ---\n\nOperating expenses:\n\nResearch and development..............................\n\nStock-based compensation............................. 8 3 2\n\nOther research and development....................... 23 28 28\n\nSales and marketing...................................\n\nStock-based compensation............................. 13 4 4\n\nOther sales and marketing............................ 37 34 29\n\nGeneral and administrative............................\n\nStock-based compensation............................. 1 1 3\n\nOther general and administrative..................... 7 9 8\n\nAcquired in-process research and development.......... 1 3 --\n\nAmortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles..... 4 1 --\n\n--- --- ---\n\nTotal operating expenses............................ 94 83 74\n\n--- --- ---\n\nLoss from operations....................................

Revenue from Reuters accounted for 8%, 19% and 15% of our\n\ntotal revenue in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 respectively. In fiscal 2000 and\n\n1999, revenue from Reuters of $20.8 million and $18 million, respectively,\n\nconsisted primarily of product fees on its sales of our products under our\n\nlicense agreement with Reuters. In fiscal 1998, revenue from Reuters consisted\n\nprimarily of maintenance and consulting fees for services we performed for\n\nReuters. In fiscal 1998, Cedel Global Services accounted for 17% of total\n\nrevenue.\n\nLicense Revenue\n\nLicense revenue was $181.6 million, $56.9 million and $17.5 million in\n\nfiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. License revenue increased $124.7\n\nmillion, or 219%, from 1999 to fiscal 2000. This increase\n\n15\n\nwas due primarily to the increased volume of sales from a broader suite of\n\nproducts. License revenue increased $39.4 million, or 225%, from fiscal 1998 to\n\nfiscal 1999. This increase was due primarily to the increased volume of sales\n\nof our TIBCO ActiveEnterprise products. License revenue was 72%, 59% and 33% of\n\ntotal revenue in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increases in\n\nlicense revenue as a percentage of total revenue reflect our strategy of\n\npursuing a license-driven business model, the increasing acceptance of our\n\nproducts in key vertical markets and the expansion of our relationships with\n\nsystems integrators which effectively leverages our direct sales of software\n\nproducts. We believe that license revenues will grow in absolute dollars and\n\nwill increase slightly as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal 2001.\n\nService and Maintenance Revenue\n\nService and maintenance revenue was $70.2 million, $39.5 million and $35.3\n\nmillion in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, representing increases of\n\n$30.7 million, or 78%, from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000 and $4.2 million, or\n\n12%, from fiscal 1998 to fiscal 1999. Service and maintenance revenue was 28%,\n\n41% and 67% of total revenue in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. These\n\nincreases were primarily a result of additional maintenance revenue related to\n\nthe growth in license revenue. We believe service and maintenance revenue in\n\nfiscal 2001 as a percentage of total revenue as license revenue continues to\n\nincrease as a percentage of total revenue.\n\nCost of Revenue\n\nCost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and third party contractor\n\nand associated expenses related to providing project implementation services,\n\nthe cost of providing maintenance and customer support services, and royalties.\n\nThe majority of our cost of revenue is directly related to our service revenue.\n\nCost of revenue, excluding stock based compensation charges, was $61.5 million,\n\n$36.6 million and $27.7 million in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively,\n\nrepresenting increases of $24.9 million, or 68%, from fiscal 1999 to fiscal\n\n2000 and $8.9 million, or 32%, from fiscal 1998 to fiscal 1999. Cost of revenue\n\nwas 24%, 38% and 52% of total revenue in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998,\n\nrespectively. The increases in cost of revenue in absolute dollars in fiscal\n\n2000 and 1999 resulted from increased service and maintenance revenue and the\n\ndecreases as a percentage of total revenue were due primarily to increases in\n\nlicense revenue as a percentage of total revenue.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related\n\ncosts associated with the development of our TIBCO ActiveEnterprise, TIBCO\n\nActiveExchange, and TIBCO ActivePortal product suites. Research and development\n\nexpenses, excluding stock based compensation charges, were $57.9 million,\n\n$27.5 million and $14.8 million in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively\n\nrepresenting increases of $30.4 million, or 111%, from fiscal 1999 to fiscal\n\n2000 and $12.7 million, or 86%, from fiscal 1998 to fiscal 1999. These\n\nincreases were due primarily to increases in our development staff as we\n\ncontinued to expand the product suites and upgrade the performance of existing\n\nproducts. Research and development expenses were 23%, 28% and 28% of total\n\nrevenue in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. We believe that continued\n\ninvestment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic\n\nobjectives and, as a result, expect that spending on research and development\n\nwill continue to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2001.\n\nSales and Marketing Expenses\n\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related\n\ncosts of our direct sales force and marketing staff and the cost of marketing\n\nprograms, including advertising, trade shows, promotional materials and\n\ncustomer conferences. Sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock based\n\ncompensation charges, were $92.2 million, $33.1 million and $15.2 million in\n\nfiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, representing increases of $59.1\n\nmillion, or 178%, from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000 and $17.9 million, or 117%,\n\nfrom fiscal 1998 to fiscal 1999. These increases resulted primarily from the\n\ncontinued expansion of our domestic and international direct sales force in\n\norder to sell our expanding suite of products. Sales and marketing expenses\n\n16\n\nwere 37%, 34% and 29% of total revenue in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998,\n\nrespectively. We intend to continue to increase staff in our direct sales\n\norganization and to develop product marketing and branding campaigns and,\n\naccordingly, expect that sales and marketing expenditures will continue to\n\nincrease substantially in absolute dollars for fiscal 2001.\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and\n\nrelated costs for general corporate functions, including executive, legal,\n\nfinance, accounting, human resources and information technology. General and\n\nadministrative expenses, excluding stock based compensation charges, were $18.5\n\nmillion, $8.2 million and $4.0 million in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998,\n\nrespectively, representing increases of $10.3 million, or 125%, from fiscal\n\n1999 to fiscal 2000 and $4.2 million, or 104%, from fiscal 1998 to fiscal 1999.\n\nThese increases were primarily a result of increased staffing and associated\n\noperational costs related to building our general and administrative\n\ninfrastructure. We believe that general and administrative expenses will\n\nincrease in absolute dollars and remain relatively stable as a percentage of\n\ntotal revenue for fiscal 2001 as we develop our infrastructure to support a\n\nrapidly growing global company.\n\nStock-based Compensation\n\nIn connection with the grant of stock options to employees and non-employee\n\ndirectors during fiscal 1998 and 1999, we recorded aggregate unearned\n\ncompensation of $22.8 million, representing the difference between the deemed\n\nfair value of our common stock at the date of grant and the exercise price of\n\nsuch options. Such amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders' equity\n\nand is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable option and is shown\n\nby expense category. We expect to amortize $3.3 million, $1.9 million,\n\n$0.8 million and $0.1 million of unearned stock-based compensation in fiscal\n\n2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense\n\nrelated to employees and non-employee directors was $5.5 million, $5.7 million\n\nand $4.8 million in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock options granted to\n\nconsultants is recognized as earned using the multiple option method as\n\nprescribed by FASB Interpretation No. 28, and is shown by expense category. At\n\neach reporting date, we re-value the stock-based compensation using the Black-\n\nScholes option pricing model. As a result, the stock-based compensation expense\n\nwill fluctuate as the fair market value of our common stock fluctuates. In\n\nconnection with the grant of stock options to consultants prior to the\n\nCompany's initial public offering, we recorded stock-based compensation expense\n\nof $34.8 million, $3.5 million and $0.3 million in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998,\n\nrespectively. As of November 30, 2000, we expect to amortize stock-based\n\ncompensation expense of $6.6 million in fiscal 2001, assuming no change in the\n\nunderlying value of our common stock.\n\nWe recorded aggregate unearned compensation of $34.9 million in connection\n\nwith the acquisition of Extensibility Inc. related to unvested options that\n\nwere assumed as well as stock that was issued as part of the consideration for\n\nthe acquisition, which is being held in an escrow account. This amount is\n\namortized over the vesting period of the options and the stock, and is shown by\n\nexpense category. We expect to amortize $18.8 million, $4.3 million, $0.5\n\nmillion and $0.1 million of unearned stock compensation related to the\n\nExtensibility acquisition in fiscal 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to the unvested portion of options\n\nassumed and restricted stock granted in connection with the acquisition of\n\nExtensibility was $11.2 million in fiscal 2000.\n\nIn fiscal 2000, the Company recognized $5.4 million as stock compensation\n\nexpense related to the employer portion of payroll taxes due as a result of\n\nemployee exercise of non qualified stock options.\n\nAcquired In-process Research and Development\n\nManagement estimated that $2.3 million of the purchase price of\n\nExtensibility Inc. in fiscal 2000 and $2.8 million of the purchase price of\n\nInConcert, Inc. in fiscal 1999 represented acquired in-process research and\n\n17\n\ndevelopment that had not yet reached technological feasibility and has no\n\nalternative future use. Accordingly, these amounts were immediately charged to\n\nexpense upon consummation of the acquisitions.\n\nDevelopment projects which had not reached technological feasibility and had\n\nno future alternative uses, were classified as IPRD. The value of IPRD was\n\ndetermined by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once\n\ncommercially viable, discounting the net cash flows back to their present value\n\nand then applying a percentage of completion. If the projects are not\n\nsuccessfully developed, the sales and profitability of the combined company may\n\nbe adversely affected in future periods.\n\nAmortization of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles\n\nAmortization of goodwill and other acquired intangibles was $10.5 million\n\nand $0.5 million in fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. Goodwill and other\n\nacquired intangibles of $68.0 million recorded in connection with the\n\nacquisition of Extensibility in August 2000 are being amortized over their\n\nuseful lives of two to five years. During the fourth quarter of 1999, $31.2\n\nmillion of goodwill and other acquired intangibles were recorded in connection\n\nwith the asset purchase of InConcert. These items which are being amortized\n\nover their estimated useful life of 5 years.\n\nOther Income, Net\n\nOther income, net includes interest and other miscellaneous income and\n\nexpense items. Other income, net was $24.9 million, $2.1 million and $1.1\n\nmillion in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase in fiscal\n\n2000 was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income due to higher\n\naverage cash and investment balances following the successful completion of our\n\nfollow-on offering in March 2000 and realized gains on equity securities,\n\noffset by losses on certain investments in emerging companies. The increase in\n\nfiscal 1999 was due primarily to interest income earned from our investments\n\nwhich increased significantly as a result of the money raised in connection\n\nwith our initial public offering in July 1999. As a result of current market\n\nconditions, we may incur additional charges on our investments in emerging\n\ncompanies in the future.\n\nIncome taxes\n\nIn fiscal 2000, a $1.9 million provision was recorded for federal, state,\n\nand foreign taxes. At November 30, 2000, we had net operating loss\n\ncarryforwards of $2.4 million and $0.8 million excluding stock compensation\n\ndeductions, and $429 million and $209 million including stock compensation\n\ndeductions, for federal and California, respectively, which expire through 2020\n\nand 2005, respectively. We also had available tax credit carryforwards of $4.5\n\nmillion and $1.5 million for federal and California, respectively, which expire\n\nthrough 2020. In the event of a change in ownership, as defined under federal\n\nand state tax laws, the utilization of these carryforwards could be subject to\n\ncertain limitations in future years.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nIn March 2000, we completed a follow-on offering of 4,775,750 shares of our\n\ncommon stock at $106.00 per share. Net proceeds to us aggregated approximately\n\n$481 million (net of underwriters' commissions and of issuance costs of $1.1\n\nmillion). In July 1999, we completed an initial public offering of 27,485,001\n\nshares of our common stock at $5.00 per share. Net proceeds to us aggregated\n\napproximately $123.5 million (net of underwriters' commissions and offering\n\nexpenses of $13.8 million).\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2000 was $37.6 million\n\nresulting from our net loss, non-cash charges of $70.6 million, and by a net\n\nchange of $8.1 million in assets and liabilities. Net cash used by operating\n\nactivities in fiscal 1999 and 1998 was $9.7 million and $11.8 million,\n\nrespectively, resulting primarily from our net losses.\n\n18\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $374.8 million, $103.8 million and\n\n$8.2 million in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Net cash used in\n\ninvesting activities in fiscal 2000 was related primarily to the purchase of\n\nshort-term investments. Net cash used for investing activities for fiscal 1999\n\nrelated primarily to the purchase of short-term investments and to the\n\nacquisition of InConcert, Inc. Net cash used in investing activities in 1998\n\nwas primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment, principally\n\ndesktop and network hardware and software, and the investment of surplus funds\n\nreceived from the issuance of our capital stock.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998,\n\nrespectively, was $495.9 million, $126.5 million and $12.4 million. Cash\n\nprovided by financing activities was primarily the result of net proceeds from\n\nthe sale of our common stock in fiscal 2000 and 1999 and our preferred stock in\n\n1998.\n\nAt November 30, 2000, we had $582.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and\n\ninvestments. We anticipate continued growth in our operating expenses for the\n\nforeseeable future, particularly in sales and marketing expenses and, to a\n\nlesser extent, research and development and general and administrative\n\nexpenses. As a result, we expect to use our cash resources to fund our\n\noperating expenses and capital expenditures, and additionally, to fund\n\nacquisitions or investments in complementary businesses, technologies or\n\nproduct lines. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and\n\ninvestments, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for\n\nworking capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn December 1999, the SEC issued SAB No. 101, \"Revenue Recognition in\n\nFinancial Statements.\" This bulletin summarizes certain SEC's views in applying\n\naccounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. to revenue recognition in\n\nfinancial statements. Based on the SEC's timeline for implementing SAB 101, the\n\nCompany would be required to comply with the guidelines in the fourth quarter\n\nof fiscal year 2001. The Company is currently evaluating SAB 101 and does not\n\nexpect its implementation will have a material effect on its financial\n\nposition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nFACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS\n\nThe following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future\n\noperating results and could cause actual events to differ materially from those\n\npredicted in forward-looking statements related to our business.\n\nWe have a history of losses and we expect future losses, and if we do not\n\nachieve and sustain profitability our business will suffer and our stock price\n\nmay decline.\n\nAlthough our revenue has increased in recent quarters, we may not be able to\n\nsustain our growth or obtain sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain\n\nprofitability. We incurred net losses of approximately $25.0 million, $19.5\n\nmillion, and $13.0 million in fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998 respectively. As of\n\nNovember 30, 2000, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $62.0\n\nmillion.\n\nWe have invested significantly in building our sales and marketing\n\norganization and in our technology research and development. We expect to\n\ncontinue to spend substantial financial and other resources on expanding our\n\ndirect sales and marketing activities and developing and introducing\n\nenhancements to our existing products and new software products. As a result,\n\nwe need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.\n\nWe expect that our research and development expenses and our general and\n\nadministrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars. We\n\nintend to continue to increase staff in our direct sales organization and to\n\ndevelop producing marketing and branding campaigns and accordingly, expect that\n\nsales and marketing expenditures will continue to increase substantially in\n\nabsolute dollars for the foreseeable future.\n\n19\n\nOur future revenue is unpredictable, and we expect our quarterly operating\n\nresults to fluctuate, which may cause our stock price to decline.\n\nPeriod-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good\n\nindication of our future performance. Moreover, our operating results in some\n\nquarters may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors.\n\nIn that event, our stock price would likely decline. As a result of our limited\n\noperating history, our new business strategy and the evolving nature of the\n\nmarkets in which we compete, we may have difficulty accurately forecasting our\n\nrevenue in any given period. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in\n\nthis section, a number of factors may cause our revenue to fall short of our\n\nexpectations or cause fluctuations in our operating results, including:\n\n. the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products or services\n\nby our competitors;\n\n. the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures\n\nrelating to the expansion of our operations; and\n\n. The capital and expense budgeting decisions of our customers.\n\nIn addition, our quarterly operating results have historically been subject\n\nto variations throughout the year due to a general slow-down in our sales in\n\nthe summer months, particularly in Europe. Specifically, we generally\n\nexperience relatively lower revenue in our third fiscal quarter. These seasonal\n\nvariations in our operating results may lead to fluctuations in our results of\n\noperations from quarter to quarter throughout the year.\n\nThere can be no assurance that any of our customers will continue to purchase\n\nour products in the future.\n\nWe do not have long-term contracts with any of our customers. There can be\n\nno assurance that any of our customers will continue to purchase our products\n\nin the future. As a result, a customer that generates substantial revenue for\n\nus in one period may not be a source of revenue in subsequent periods.\n\nOur licensing and distribution relationship with Reuters places limitations on\n\nour ability to conduct our business.\n\nWe have a significant relationship with Reuters for licensing and\n\ndistribution. Our relationship with Reuters involves limitations and\n\nrestrictions on our business, as well as other risks, described below.\n\nReuters has access to the intellectual property used in our products, and\n\ncould use the intellectual property to compete with us. We license the\n\nunderlying TIB messaging technology incorporated into some of our important\n\nTIBCO ActiveEnterprise products from Reuters. We do not own this technology.\n\nReuters is not restricted from using the TIB technology to produce products\n\nthat compete with our products, and it can grant limited licenses to the TIB\n\ntechnology to others who may compete with us. In addition, we must license all\n\nthe intellectual property and products we create through December 2011 to\n\nReuters. This will place Reuters in a position to more easily develop products\n\nthat compete with our product offerings.\n\nWe must rely on Reuters and other distributors to sell our products in the\n\nfinancial services market, and they may not be successful in doing so. Under\n\nour agreements with Reuters, we are restricted from selling our products and\n\nproviding consulting services directly to companies in the financial services\n\nmarket and major competitors of Reuters, and from using the TIB technology we\n\nlicense from Reuters to develop products specifically for use by these\n\ncompanies. Accordingly, we must rely on Reuters and other third-party resellers\n\nand distributors to sell our products to these companies.\n\nSubstantially all of our revenue from sales in the financial services\n\nmarket, excluding sales to Cedel Global Services, consists of product fees paid\n\nto us by Reuters. Although Reuters is the preferred distributor of our products\n\nin the financial services market and is required to pay us guaranteed minimum\n\nproduct fee\n\n20\n\npayments until the end of 2001, Reuters has no contractual obligation to\n\ndistribute our products to financial services customers. Reuters and other\n\ndistributors may not be successful in selling our products into the financial\n\nservices market, or they may elect to sell competitive third-party products\n\ninto that market, either of which may adversely affect our revenue in that\n\nmarket.\n\nOur relationship with Reuters restricts our ability to earn revenue from\n\nsales in the financial services market. Under the license agreement, Reuters is\n\nrequired to pay us product fees based on a percentage of its revenue from sales\n\nof our products in the financial services market, excluding products that are\n\nembedded in any Reuters products. These product fees may be materially less\n\nthan the product fees we could obtain from other distributors or resellers in\n\nthe financial services market. In addition, when we sell our products into the\n\nfinancial services market through third-party distributors other than Reuters,\n\nReuters receives a share of our license revenue.\n\nOur license agreement with Reuters imposes practical restrictions on our\n\nability to acquire other companies. The license agreement places no specific\n\nrestrictions on our ability to acquire companies with all or part of their\n\nbusiness in the financial services market. However, under the terms of the\n\nlicense agreement, we are prohibited from bundling or combining our products\n\nthat are based on licensed technology with an acquired company's products and\n\nservices and then selling the bundled or combined products directly to\n\nfinancial services companies. This prohibition could prevent us from realizing\n\npotential synergies with companies we acquire.\n\nThe market for e-business infrastructure software may not grow as quickly as we\n\nanticipate, which would cause our revenues to fall below expectations.\n\nThe market for e-business infrastructure software is relatively new and\n\nevolving. We earn a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our e-\n\nbusiness infrastructure software, including application integration software,\n\nand related services. We expect to earn substantially all of our revenue in the\n\nforeseeable future from sales of these products and services. Our future\n\nfinancial performance will depend on continued growth in the number of\n\norganizations demanding software and services for application integration, e-\n\nbusiness and information delivery and seeking outside vendors to develop,\n\nmanage and maintain this software for their critical applications. Many of our\n\npotential customers have made significant investments in internally developed\n\nsystems and would incur significant costs in switching to third-party products,\n\nwhich may substantially inhibit the growth of the market for e-business\n\ninfrastructure software. If the market fails to grow, or grows more slowly than\n\nwe expect, our sales will be adversely affected.\n\nOur acquisition strategy could cause financial or operational problems.\n\nOur success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our\n\nproduct offerings in response to changing technologies, customer demands, and\n\ncompetitive pressures. To this end, we may acquire new and complementary\n\nbusinesses, products or technologies. We do not know if we will be able to\n\ncomplete any acquisitions or that we will be able to successfully integrate any\n\nacquired business, operate them profitably, or retain their key employees. For\n\nexample, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of\n\nInConcert, Inc. in November 1999 and the acquisition of Extensibility, Inc. in\n\nSeptember 2000. Integrating InConcert, Extensibility or any other newly\n\nacquired business, product or technology could be expensive and time-consuming,\n\ncould disrupt our ongoing business, and could distract our management. We may\n\nface competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established\n\ncompanies with greater financial resources. In addition in order to finance any\n\nacquisitions, we might need to raise additional funds through public or private\n\nfinancings. In that event, we could be forced to obtain equity or debt\n\nfinancing on terms that are not favorable to us and, in the case of equity\n\nfinancing, that results in dilution to our stockholders. If we are unable to\n\nintegrate InConcert, Extensibility or any other newly acquired entity, products\n\nor technology effectively, our business, financial condition and operating\n\nresults would suffer. In addition, any amortization of goodwill or other assets\n\nor other charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could harm our\n\noperating results.\n\n21\n\nOur investment strategy could cause financial or operational problems.\n\nAs of November 30, 2000 we had invested $23.0 million in companies with\n\ncomplementary technologies or products or which provide us with access to\n\nadditional vertical markets and customers, and we plan to continue making such\n\ninvestments in the future. The companies in which we invest are often at early\n\nstages of development, and no public market exists for their securities at the\n\ntime of our investment. These investments may not result in any meaningful\n\ncommercial benefit to us, and our investments could lose all or a significant\n\npart of their value. Moreover, in certain circumstances, these investments\n\ncould subject us to restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n\nWe might have to take actions, including, buying, refraining from buying,\n\nselling or refraining from selling securities when we would otherwise not wish\n\nto, in order to avoid registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could cause investors to lose all or\n\npart of their investments in our stock.\n\nThe stock market in general, and the stock prices of technology companies in\n\nparticular, have recently experienced volatility which has often been unrelated\n\nto the operating performance of any particular company or companies. If market\n\nor industry-based fluctuations continue, our stock price could decline\n\nregardless of our actual operating performance and investors could lose all or\n\npart of their investments.\n\nThe rapid growth of our operations could strain our resources and cause our\n\nbusiness to suffer.\n\nOur ability to successfully offer products and services and implement our\n\nbusiness plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and\n\nmanagement process. We are increasing the scope of our operations and we have\n\nrecently increased our headcount substantially, both domestically and\n\ninternationally. Our growth has placed and will continue to place a significant\n\nstrain on our management systems, infrastructure and resources. We expect that\n\nwe will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls,\n\nreporting systems and procedures. We will also need to expand, train and manage\n\nour workforce worldwide. Accordingly, we believe that general and\n\nadministrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars.\n\nFurthermore, we expect that we will be required to manage an increasing number\n\nof relationships with various customers and other third parties. Failure to\n\nexpand any of the foregoing areas efficiently and effectively could interfere\n\nwith the growth of our business as a whole.\n\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy.\n\nThe primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal,\n\nmaintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields. Our\n\ninvestment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and\n\nlimits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue, issuer or type of\n\ninvestment. The maximum allowable duration of a single issue is 2.5 years and\n\nthe maximum allowable duration of the portfolio is 1.3 years.\n\nAt the end of fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, we had an investment portfolio of\n\nfixed income securities totaling $401.9 million and $76.1 million, excluding\n\nthose classified as cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds. Our\n\ninvestments consist primarily of bank and finance notes, various government\n\nobligations and asset-backed securities. These securities are classified as\n\navailable-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value\n\nwith unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of\n\nstockholders' equity. Unrealized losses are charged against income when a\n\ndecline in fair market value is determined to be other than temporary. The\n\nspecific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities\n\nsold.\n\nThe investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in\n\nvalue in the event market interest rates increase. If market interest rates\n\nwere to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 basis points (approximately\n\n15% of current rates in the portfolio) from levels as of November 30, 2000, the\n\nfair market value of the portfolio would decline by approximately $5.2 million.\n\n22\n\nWe develop products in the United States and sell in North America, South\n\nAmerica, Asia and Europe. As a result, our financial results could be affected\n\nby factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic\n\nconditions in foreign markets. A majority of sales are currently made in U.S.\n\ndollars, however, a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less\n\ncompetitive in foreign markets.\n\nITEM 8.

F-7\n\nF-1\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS\n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\n\nTIBCO Software Inc.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the\n\naccompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\n\nposition of TIBCO Software Inc. and its subsidiaries at November 30, 2000 and\n\nNovember 30, 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for\n\neach of the three years in the period ended November 30, 2000 in conformity\n\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management;\n\nour responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based\n\non our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with\n\nauditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which\n\nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\n\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit\n\nincludes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and\n\ndisclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles\n\nused and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall\n\nfinancial statement presentation.

This publish and subscribe technology, know as The Information\n\nBus or \"TIB,\" permitted the integration of disparate information from various\n\ndata sources and its distribution across a variety of networks and platforms\n\nwithin these banks, financial institutions and stock exchanges.\n\nTeknekron was acquired by a subsidiary of Reuters Group PLC (\"Reuters\"), the\n\nglobal news and information group, in 1994, and the underlying technology\n\nrights owned by Teknekron were assigned to Reuters.
