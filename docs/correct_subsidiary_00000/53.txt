About Selectica CPQ

Selectica CPQ simplifies the sales process so that your sales team can easily generate price quotes more quickly and efficiently. When first setting prices, you can configure the program’s Selectica Playbook, which allows you to set rules for product and deal pricing. Next, the system’s product catalog gives your sales team all the information for your products’ pricing, packaging, availability, etc and lets your team generate deals with the help of a program wizard. Each time a salesperson selects an item to quote, the program ensures that your rep is choosing the right add-ons and options for the product. Once the quote is completed, you can quickly send your quote to the customer through the program and have customer-specific deals sent for approval.
