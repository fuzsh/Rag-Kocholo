        "text": "I am truly sorry for your loss. I would first like to Express my heartfelt gratitude for Mr. Doyle's service. I didn't know Mr. Doyle but I thought your family would appreciate this. My name is John R. Doyle, I'm 41 from Lansing Michigan. My Grandfather, also John R. Doyle, passed away several years ago. He was also a veteran of WWII. While doing a little research online about some battles my grandfather was in I stumbled across your beloved John R. Doyle. What really caught my attention was your John R. Doyle's birthday! December 18th... This also happens to be my date of birth!!! But more importantly, I read about your John. I am quite proud to share the name of heroes like Your John and my grandfather John. It was quite amazing to learn about your hero! Thoughts, prayers and Love from a stranger with the same name and birthday!!!\n\nSincerely, John R. Doyle\n\nJack was such a sweet, kind and gentle man. He was a joy to sit and visit with. He was so intelligent and our conversations always filled my brain and my heart. I’ll miss him! Jack and Christine were both very special people and what a blessing that they found each other. Sending lots of love and hugs to all of the Doyle children, grandchildren, family and friends.\n\nIt was a pleasure to have been Jack’s colleague in the Chemistry Department for many years. He was an excellent teacher and he was the research director for many students who did their PhD work in inorganic chemistry. His wry sense of humor enlivened many conversations. And his pronounced Boston accent\n\n(alpher and betar) was quite a contrast to Chris’s gentle Charleston speech. Condolences to the family for losing both parents this year.\n\nI knew Jack for almost 4 years. In that time he and I spent a great deal of time talking about his time in the military and also history in general. He had a great sense of humor and wit that always made me crack a smile. He was good man and would apologize profusely if he was ever rude. Honestly I would be upset too if someone as loud as I am entered my room waking me or interrupting my books on tape...He always had snacks and was very generous with him. Jack was my friend and I will miss him dearly\n\nJack Doyle was a treasure in this life. Jack knew a little bit about EVERYTHING and a very great deal about extremely complex science. He was a gentleman who always said thank you and apologized within a few minutes about being justifiably grumpy. He was generous, kind and loved to tell a good story. He was a boy who grew up in a big city, studied hard, enlisted in the Navy and then shared his brilliance in the Pacific Theater of WWII. Not only Jack appreciated the life stories of others and read constantly even when his eyes let him down. He has missed his beautiful wife greatly in these last 6 months. I will always miss Jack but I will never forget knowing him and I will always be grateful that our life paths crossed.\n\n\"Eternal Father, strong to save,\n\nWhose arm doth bond the restless wave,\n\nWho bids the mighty ocean deep\n\nIts own appointed limits keep;\n\nO hear us when we cry to Thee\n\nFor those in peril on the sea.\n\nUpon the terrace dark and rude,\n\nAnd bid its angry tumult cease,\n\nAnd give for wild confusion peace;\n\nO hear us when we cry to Thee\n\nFor those in peril on the sea\"\n\nYour good friend and nurse,\n\nSarah"
