        "text": "For James William Softley, known to everyone as Jon, death occurred suddenly but peacefully in his sleep at his home at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, on 25th February. He was in his 95th year and up to the time of his death had been his usual active and energetic self.\n\nA native of the north west Jon was educated in Liverpool. Qualifying in dentistry at Liverpool Dental Hospital, he remained on the staff there before being appointed to the Chair of Prosthetics at Kuala Lumpur in 1937.\n\nFollowing the Japanese occupation of Malaya and Singapore Jon was captured and spent the rest of the war in the notorious Japanese civilian prison of Changi.\n\nJon's spirit was not cowed by his capture and he was famous for his many schemes to make the lives of his fellow detainees more bearable.\n\nTypically, Jon's spirit was not cowed by his capture and he was famous for his many schemes to make the lives of his fellow detainees more bearable. These schemes were very diverse, extending from civil engineering improvements to water and sewage services, to constructing and changing spectacles. His efforts were acclaimed by the other prisoners. On being released at the end of the war, Jon returned to Liverpool in 1946 to an appointment in the orthodontic department at the city's Dental Hospital, later taking over as head of the department. It was while at Liverpool that he met and married his wife Gwynneth.\n\nThe early 1950's saw the institution of Regional Orthodontic Consultants and Jon was appointed, in 1953, to be Regional Consultant of Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire, being only the third Regional Consultant to be appointed.\n\nHe made his headquarters at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, where he became renowned for his skill as an orthodontist, being responsible for many advances in this discipline.\n\nA long-time member of the BSSO and the European Orthodontic Society, he became President of the BSSO in 1958 and also contributed to the Anglo/Scandinavian Study Group.\n\nRetiring in 1972, Jon and Gwynneth settled in Padstow, Cornwall, where he indulged two of his great pleasures, sailing and gardening. After many happy years in Padstow, Jon and Gwynneth moved to Moreton-in-Marsh in the Cotswolds to be nearer their family and although he gave up sailing continued gardening and played bridge with a group of friends in Moreton.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Gwynneth, daughter Wendy, his son Michael and his grandchildren.\n\nMalcolm Savage\n\nTony Doyle died peacefully in the Alexandra Hospital, Cheadle on 11 February at the age of 62 of melanoma.\n\nHe was educated at De La Salle College, Salford and at the University of Bristol where he obtained his BDS in 1963. As a student he had taken a royal Air Force Cadetship, and followed this with a 3-year short service commission after qualification. Much of his service life was spent on the Persian Gulf where he was based at both Bahrain and Oman, providing a flying dental service to outlying stations. It was here that he learnt to sail, a love which stayed with him for the rest of this life, owning boats at Bridlington and Plymouth in later years.\n\nAfter leaving the RAF he took an assistantship in Cambridge where he met his wife Susan, getting married in April 1968. While on honeymoon in Gibralter he realised the potential for opening a dental practice there and returned to do so with the willing cooperation of other local dentists. He had many interesting patients, expatriates from Spain and Morocco, passengers and crew of passing ships and of course, the local population.\n\nBecause of the closure of the border with Spain at that time he found Gibralter a little restrictive and moved from the sunny Mediterranean to the icy north by taking a post in the Norwegian School of Dental Service at Trondheim. Here he saw at first hand the use of supervised personal fluoride programmes and this further developed his interest in preventative dentistry. It was in Trondheim that he indulged his love of skiing, with many subsequent holidays in Norway and Sweden.\n\nHe returned to England in 1970 and took a post in the school dental service in Staffordshire. It was here that his children Elisabeth and Edmund were born. It was during this period that he obtained further diplomas at Birmingham University and the Royal College of Surgeons.\n\nIn the 1974 reorganisation of the NHS he obtained the post of area dental officer in Rochdale. Here in an area of high disease rates he vigorously promoted dental health education programmes and established a first rate dental service for the handicapped. He was an early user of epidemiological surveys and pioneered the use of 'Survey Plus' in the North West.\n\nAlways a traveller, he found his last resting place at Glenamaddy County Galway.\n\nIn 1989 he obtained his MDS at Bristol University and from 1995, until his retirement in July 1999, he was dental advisor and specialist in dental public health to Bury and Rochdale.\n\nNever one to stand still, Tony then worked as community dentist for Burnley Health Care NHS Trust providing excellent clinical services to the people of Nelson and great support to his community colleagues.\n\nTony was a kind and cheerful man, loved and respected by his many friends and colleagues, many of whom progressed in their careers because of his support and encouragement. Always a traveller, he found his last resting place at Glenamaddy County Galway.\n\nWilliam Erskine Crosland"
