        "text": "Madeleine,\n\nI have been through every muster rolls and rosters of the 15th Maine but and did not find anything pertaining to Edward Doyle. I did find a whole bunch of other Doyle's listed on the Maine's muster rolls such as John, James, Robert, and Thomas Doyle. Looking at the Maine's 15th unit history it dose not seem that they were on any sort of expedition the furthest the went was Texas and Louisiana and up the Mississippi. I read John McCluskey actually had a retirement and per his resignation and actually he and a handful where in the same retirement in 1862. I just think he decided on a vacation.\n\nHere is some information on Edward Doyle, he is buried here https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/122567265/edward-doyle\n\nThe only thing after finding the Maine Civil War index cards which is not on any genealogy site was this Edward H. Doyle and it looks like he had a short enlistment. This is also shows him with the 24th Maine Infantry. and this guy was born in Ireland so probably not your guy.\n\nHi Elliot,\n\nThank you so much for reading my question and for your reply. I know there are no civil war records about my great-great grandfather; I've spent quite a bit of time at the Maine State archives looking for records. He is not the same person as Edward H. Doyle from Pittston. Unfortunately, both Edward and Doyle are pretty common names. I don't know why there aren't any records.\n\nDespite the lack of records, I am sure he was in the civil war. It was a known fact in his family. Family lore is that he came home early because of sickness and apparently it was so awful that when the draft went in, he paid for substitutes for his two brothers. I have been able to find records to substantiate the substitutes for the brothers. Also, the American Legion puts a veterans marker on his grave every year in Fort Fairfield.\n\nI don't think these individuals went to Nicaragua for a vacation. They were from Northern Maine and for Edward at least, he had never been south of Maine. It would have been an outlandish choice for a vacation for folks in the 1800s in Maine, let alone in the middle of a war. It's possible it was some kind of business proposition but I think it's also possible/likely they resigned from the 15th Maine to do some other sort of work for the government. John McCluskey was a colonel and I believe he had signed up for 3 years. It seems odd he would resign after only 9 months in the middle of a campaign in New Orleans. I don't know enough about civil war history to know if it would be unusual for a colonel to resign after only 9 months but I know they were very patriotic and the unit was comprised of many men from Aroostook County Maine so it seems odd that the colonel would leave these men.\n\nThank you again! It's a very puzzling problem . . . . Madeleine\n\nMadeline,\n\nI can see your point regarding Nicaragua, Colonel John McCluskey had been in the military and at war and at the height of the civil war he was reaching retirement age. He may have been asked to resigned based on a military law that was broken and instead of facing a court-martial he resigned peacefully. I'm positive that even tough he signed up for a three year enlistment that those circumstances could be broken especially if their was any misconduct within the ranks, or possible he was not fit too lead the position he was put into.\n\nPleas follow this link to view a copy of the General Orders #26 pertaining to his Court-martial proceedings starting on page #37 dated May 10th 1862.\n\nhttps://memory.loc.gov/service/lawlib/law0001/2012/201200203998867/201200203998867.pdf\n\nYou might find this read interesting please copy and paste link. My assumptions where correct he was court-martialed which means he resigned or retired early after he was cleared of the proceedings. https://catalog.archives.gov/id/1808230\n\nRecord Group 153:\n\nRecords of the Office of the Judge Advocate General (Army), 1792 - 2010\n\nSeries:\n\nCourt Martial Case Files, 12/1800 - 10/1894\n\nFile Unit:\n\nMcCluskey, John -- Colonel, Maine - 15th Infantry\n\nARC Identifier:1808230Agency-Assigned Identifier:II-895Search Identifier:siCourt Martial Army McCluskeyHMS/MLR Entry Number:PC29 15A\n\nCopy 1:Preservation-Reproduction-ReferenceContact(s):National Archives at Washington, DC - Textual Reference (RDT1)\n\nNational Archives Building\n\n7th and Pennsylvania Avenue NW\n\nWashington, DC 20408\n\nPhone: 202-357-5385\n\nFax: 202-357-5936\n\nEmail: Archives1reference@nara.gov\n\nHi Elliot, thanks for all of this additional research. The information about the court-martial is fascinating, especially the description of what Colonel McCluskey was accused of doing. I had read in a regimental history of the 15th how sad they were when their banner fell overboard but the history did not mention that their colonel was accused of throwing it over! I think you are right that it explains why McCluskey resigned from the 15th Maine. McCluskey was also in the Mexican American war so he probably had seen a lot.\n\nI remembered one additional piece of information. According to his membership card for the Freemasons (available at www.mainemason.org under the genealogy tab), Edward was \"a farmer, lumberman and a sutler in the army.\" Do you think it would have been possible that Edward and John went to Nicaragua to import coffee or something like that as part of a sutler business?\n\nMy info comes from an old news article (from the 1940s or 50s) in the Caribou Maine Aroostook Republican newspaper. the author, Milton Lufkin, was an amateur historian who researched all of the civil war veterans of Caribou, Maine. Milton Lufkin knew the Doyles and worked on their farm for a while. The article says that Ned Doyle was under the command of Colonel McCluskey for a short while and then went to Nicaragua. I also have a letter from Edward's son, another Edward, that said his dad was in the army in the south, came home early on account of sickness, and paid for substitutes for his brothers. This is all the info I have.\n\nthanks again for all of your help. Madeleine\n\nDear Ms. Blake,\n\nThank you for posting your request on History Hub!\n\nWe also located the series Carded Records Showing Military Service of Soldiers Who Fought in Volunteer Organizations During the American Civil War in the Records of the Adjutant General's Office, 1762 - 1917 (Record Group 94) that may include files for John McCluskey and Thomas McCluskey. Additionally, we located Regimental and Company Books of Civil War Volunteer Union Organizations, 1861 - 1867 in Record Group 94 that include Regimental and Company Books of the 15th Maine Infantry Regiment. Plus, we located Muster Rolls of Volunteer Organizations During the Civil War, Mexican War, Creek War, Cherokee Removal, and Other Wars, 1836 - 1866 in Record Group 94 that may include muster rolls of the 15th Maine Infantry Regiment. We also located Letters Received, 1805 - 1889 in Record Group 94 that may have correspondence regarding these individuals if they were acting on behalf of the War Department. For information about these non-digitized records, please contact the National Archives at Washington, DC - Textual Reference (RDT1) via email at archives1reference@nara.gov.\n\nWe note that you located a source identifying Edward Doyle as a sutler. Sutlers were civilian vendors authorized to operate a store on or near a military camp, post, or fort. See Post Sutler-Historical Background from the National Park Service and the article “Sutlers” by Richard H. Holloway from the Virginia Center for Civil War Studies at Virginia Tech for more information about their functions. We searched the National Archives Catalog and located 91 record series in various record groups related to sutlers in the 1860s.For information about these non-digitized records, please email RDT1 at archives1reference@nara.gov. .\n\nNext, we located Despatches from U.S. Consular Officers, 1789 - 1906 in the General Records of the Department of State (Record Group 59) that includes Despatches from U.S. Consuls in San Juan del Norte, Nicaragua, 1851-1906 and Despatches from U.S. Consuls in San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua, 1847-1881 which may include information regarding the activities of US citizens in Nicaragua if they went to a consulate for assistance. These files have been digitized and may be viewed online through the Catalog. We also located Despatches from U.S. Ministers to Central America, 1824-1906 in Record Group 59, which have also been digitized and are available online. Next, we located United States Consular Records for San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua, 1855 - 1916 in the Records of the Foreign Service Posts of the Department of State (Record Group 84).

Best of luck with your research!\n\nHi Jason,\n\nthank you so much for all of this information. It will be exciting to follow up on all this.\n\nIf you have a chance, I have one additional question. Is there a record series for people who got import licenses in the 1860s? I was thinking that if someone tried to import products from Nicaragua, they might need a license, or at least there might be a tax paid. I was thinking that this might be another source of information or possible records.\n\nThank you again for your help, I really appreciate it! Madeleine\n\nDear Ms. Blake,\n\nThank you for posting your follow-up request on History Hub!\n\nWe searched the National Archives Catalog and located 12 series related to Maine AND import in the 1860s and 4 series related to Maine AND license in the Records of the U.S. Customs Service (Record Group 36) that may contain some relevant information. We also located 2 series related to Maine AND import/export in the 1860s in the Records of the U.S. Coast Guard (Record Group 26). These records have not been digitized.
