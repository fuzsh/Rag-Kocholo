        "text": "John David Doyle of Schertz, Texas and 1958 graduate of Northside High School (John Marshall) entered into eternal rest on March 22, 2023, at the age of 82.\n\nJohn originally born in McAllen, Texas on April 14, 1940, to Robert E Doyle and Mildred Irene Hearn Doyle moved to San Antonio in 1942 after his mothers’ passing to assist his great uncle Joe Doyle with his dairy farm during WWII. During this time his father met and married Mildred Stuebing.\n\nAt the age of 14 John began his working career at Handy Andy as a bagger. With his strong work ethic, he continued working through high school.\n\nJohn found his calling to the United States Navy in 1962 where he served 5 years and received the Good Conduct Award. Upon leaving the US Navy, he attended San Antonio College and Southwest Texas State. John’s career led him to Kelly Air Force Base, where he received additional training that made him eligible to join the Federal Aviation Administration. John continued his life in FAA for 45 years, serving throughout Texas to locations at College Station, Alice and Corpus Christi.\n\nIt was in Alice, Texas that he was introduced to the woman who would become his wife, Mildred Ruth Doyle, his partner in life for 37 years, until his passing.\n\nJohn was a kind and thoughtful soul who will be missed and remembered by the many lives he touched. He was an adoring, loving Husband, Father, Grandfather, Brother and Uncle who cherished his family. He was a selfless and giving person. His generosity was deeply felt by family and friends. When you met John, you were greeted with a sincere hug and the warmest hello. In his presence, you knew that you were important and welcomed. Besides spending time with his family and friends, John had a passion for the outdoors. He loved hunting and fishing. He enjoyed working with his hands on around the house projects and working on cars. John was known to be a great cook and a master at the BBQ pit. No one who met John was safe from his life lesson stories and adventures, and his willingness to give advice. His stories evolved into his pride of being a grandpa. His joy was evident in his eyes when he was graced with being called Paw-Paw. John will be carried in our hearts by the memories that he has given us.\n\nProceeded in death by his parents and sister. John is survived by his beloved wife Mildred Ruth; sister Eileen, and brother Robert; daughter Deborah Brewer and husband Steve; stepson Christopher Setliff and wife Catherine; three grandchildren Jade, Jacelyn, and Katherine; six nieces and nephews and many friends."
