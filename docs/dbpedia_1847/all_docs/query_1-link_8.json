He was a frequent visitor of the Winona Woods walking path with his trusty steed, Fergus (golden retriever). Not only was John a great story teller but he was also very crafty and creative. He was a very proud Irish Catholic but even prouder of his greatest accomplishment, his family.\n\nCalling Hours will be held Friday, November 17, 4-7pm at the funeral home (570 Kings Highway So.). Friends are invited to meet the family Saturday, November 18th at 1:00pm at St. Kateri at Christ the King Church for his Memorial Mass. Interment Private Holy Sepulchre Cemetery.
