        "text": "Vice Adm. James Henry Doyle, commander of the Amphibious Task Forces that carried out the landing at Inchon and the later evacuation of nearly 200,000 soldiers and civilians from Hungnam in the Korean War, died Monday at the Naval Regional Center in Oakland, Calif. He was 83 years old and lived in San Francisco.\n\nAdmiral Doyle, a much-decorated officer, saw action in the Pacific in World War II and was in charge of submarine demolition in Coronado, Calif., before being recalled to the Far East for action.\n\nHe commanded Gen. Douglas MacArthur's amphibious transports, which moved 1,000 miles from Japan to put the First Cavalry Division ashore on the east coast of Korea at Pohang in July 1950. Army and Navy officers said at the time that Admiral Doyle and his staff had performed a ''superhuman task'' and the ''fastest staging in the history'' of amphibious warfare, completing the operation within 12 hours.\n\nTwo months later, Admiral Doyle oversaw the Inchon landing on the Korean west coast, near Seoul. The move was General MacArthur's counterstroke to cut off the North Korean Army and retake the South Korean capital. Two Weeks of Evacuation\n\nBut by December 1950, General MacArthur was forced to redeploy and ordered the evacuation of American and South Korean units from northeast Korea.\n\nFor two weeks in freezing weather and under heavy enemy fire, Admiral Doyle supervised the evacuation of 105,000 soldiers, 91,000 Korean civilians, 17,500 vehicles and 350,000 tons of supplies and equipment.\n\nAdmiral Doyle was born in Jamaica, Queens, and graduated from the Naval Academy in Annapolis in 1920. He earned a doctor of jurisprudence degree at George Washington University Law School in 1929 and did some of his on-shore service in the Judge Advocate General's Office.\n\nHe also served with the United States military staff at the fledgling United Nations. Admiral Doyle won the Legion of Merit, a Silver Star, the Distinguished Service Medal and numerous campaign decorations. After his retirement in 1953, he practiced law in Austin, Tex., and was active in civic affairs before moving to San Francisco in 1979. He is survived by two sons, Vice Adm. James H. Doyle, U.S.N., retired, of Bethesda, Md., and John Doyle, an Oakland lawyer; a sister, Mary Lesser of Garden City, L.I.; three grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.\n\nA service was scheduled for Thursday in the Naval Academy chapel in Annapolis, to be followed by burial in the Naval Academy cemetery."
