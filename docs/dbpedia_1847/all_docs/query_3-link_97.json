        "text": "LAURA TINGLE, PRESENTER: So John Doyle, this is a bit complicated. This is an autobiographical memoir of Roy Slaven, as dictated to his friend, you, in which you feature as a major character written about in the third person.\n\nJOHN DOYLE, COMEDIAN AND WRITER: Well, yeah, that's not bad. It was just a case of, I've been aware of Roy's voice, having sort of created Roy's voice. So it wasn't such a difficult thing to do to put Roy in the context of us as kids.\n\nSo I chose a particular year in which Roy could tell his story in which myself and my friends would be sort of characters in his world.\n\nSo it was a way of telling the story of 1967 in Lithgow, which I concede is from a distance would not seem to be an incredibly interesting story, but it was to me.\n\n'67 was a pretty amazing time for kids in Lithgow. There was the arrival of television. So we had the influence of the counter culture in the United States, the summer of love that was happening and you had the explosion of pop music generally coming out of London, the United Kingdom and there we were in Lithgow feeling part of it because we were united through television, to a lesser extent radio, but certainly television was the thing that had the big impact.\n\nLAURA TINGLE: Do you grieve that world doesn't really exist anymore, not just the world of those schoolboys but that world itself?\n\nJOHN DOYLE: It was a deeply sectarian world then. Hard to imagine it these days and mercifully that aspect of the world has gone.\n\nBut in certainly Lithgow, and I suspect most Australian society at the time, there were two groups of citizens. There were Catholics and there were publics and we, as Catholics, were pretty well inculcated into a sort of, we were a large cult I suppose but we had a deep mistrust for publics. Publics had no morality at all, Laura, they weren't to be trusted.\n\nThere was only one true way and that was through the prism of the church. Now that has gone completely.\n\nThe innocence has gone as well, Laura and the other thing that has gone is mucking around in the bush. Not having, parents would allow you to disappear in the morning and not appear, not reappear until it was dark - not concerned about where you might be or what you might be up to. That certainly has changed as well.\n\nLAURA TINGLE: Some of the most fascinating parts of the book were actually Roy Slaven's observations of John Doyle who Roy portrays as a crawler and a nerd and Roy observes, \"Doyle attacks life like he attacks the new ball, with fear, panic and trepidation. I think he needs me.\" How weird is it to write about yourself and where do those reflections come from?\n\nJOHN DOYLE: I think there's probably a kernel of truth to that, Laura. Certainly, fear and panic. That rings true.\n\nNerd? Not sure about the nerd bit. Crawler, sure. We were, we were always troubled by getting the strap or getting the cane. It was wielded by the De La Salle Brothers. They were pretty swashbuckling in the way they used the strap. You couldn't get away with it today. So we lived in fear and panic and that was the truth of the matter.\n\nThe best way to slip through the cracks and to avoid punishment was to just be very shy and timid and do your work and try to stay unnoticed.\n\nLAURA TINGLE: Obviously you stayed shy and timid all this time. Thanks for talking to us tonight.\n\nJOHN DOYLE: Absolute pleasure, Laura. Thank you for your interest."
