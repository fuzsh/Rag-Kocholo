        "text": "John Michael Doyle, 63, Rockford, passed away after a courageous battle with cancer on Sunday, May 12, 2024. He died peacefully in his home, surrounded by his loving family. He was born on May 14, 1960, in Midland, Michigan, the son of Ronald and Bernice (Goodreau) Doyle. John married the love of his life, Jackie Roy, on May 18th, and they were together for 39 years. John was a proud family man, who was a devoted husband, father, and grandfather. He graduated from Cardinal Stritch College with a degree in business and worked as a supervisor for over 19 years at Viatris. He was a faithful member of St. James Catholic Church where he served as a Communion Minister. He was a member of the Knights of Columbus and an avid Bears fan. John had a generous spirit, a love for food and travel, and the ability to make others laugh with his humorous quips. He will be deeply missed by his friends, family and all who knew him.\n\nSurvived by his loving wife, Jackie; his daughter, Justina (Juan) Doyle Vazquez; his son, Jared (Carlos) Torres-Doyle; his granddaughter, Josefina Doyle Vazquez; his brother, Craig Doyle; his brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, Bill (Tina) Roy, Frank (Maria) Roy and Steve Stormer; his nieces and nephews, Kara, Corina, Wil, Westin, Katie, Celina, Finn and Roman. Predeceased by his parents, his father-in-law and mother-in-law; his sister-in-law, JoAnn Stormer."
