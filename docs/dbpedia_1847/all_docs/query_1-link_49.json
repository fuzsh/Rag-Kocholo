        "text": "John Joseph Doyle Jr., 75, formerly of Ocala, passed away on Saturday, March 2, 2013 at the Macclenny Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. John was born in New York, NY on August 12, 1937 to the late John (Sr.) and Iris Doyle and grew up in New Haven, CT. He was a multi-sport athlete and graduate of Notre Dame High School in West Haven, CT. Upon earning his baccalaureate degree from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, John began his family life in Wallingford, CT.\n\nSeveral years later, his career lead him to Savannah, GA and Milwaukee, WI. He then settled in Florida for the last 29 years of his life. After living and working in the greater Orlando and Boca Raton areas, John retired to Ocala, where he was an active member of Ocala West United Methodist Church.\n\nJohn applied his business acumen to a career of financial, insurance, and risk-management planning. He found his highest personal reward when he could be there for people at their time of need or at the attainment of their long-term goals. He received great pleasure from his involvement with the Optimist Club, the Jaycees, and other community service organizations.\n\nJohn appreciated solid education and spirited conversation. He was an avid fan of all things Notre Dame. He thoroughly enjoyed good music, good dancing, good food, and good company. Most of all, John was a dedicated husband, devoted father, and well-loved family member.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Imogene Lord Doyle; sons John Doyle (Michelle Campbell) of Valrico, FL, William Doyle (Susan Smith) of Jacksonville, Gerald Doyle (Shirley) of Macclenny, and Brian Doyle of Jacksonville; stepchildren Peggy King (Wilner Labady) of Orlando, Kathi King (Rob Wilcox) of Golden, CO, Janet King (J Morley) of Lafayette, CO and Michael King of Aurora, CO; and by numerous extended family members and friends.\n\nA funeral service will be conducted at a later date by the Trail Branch Primitive Baptist Church in Cochran, GA. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made in John’s name to either the Alzheimer’s Association (www.alz.org) or Community Hospice of Northeast Florida (4266 Sunbeam Rd., Jacksonville, FL, 32257, www.communityhospice.com). Forbes Funeral Home of Macclenny is in charge of arrangements."
