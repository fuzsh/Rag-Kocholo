A reception for attendees will follow in the church basement. Visitation will be from 3-6 p.m. Sunday at the Hamilton Funeral Home.

Following the service and Marshall reception, interment is scheduled in the Worthington Community Cemetery at 2:15 p.m. A reception at the First Lutheran Church in Worthington (1200 4th Ave, Worthington, MN 56187), will follow the graveside service at 3 p.m. on Monday.\n\nJohn Doyle Jr. died Tuesday, April 30, 2024, under the care of Avera Hospice with family by his side, at the Avera Morningside Heights Care Center in Marshall.\n\nJohn Byron Doyle Jr. was born on Nov. 30, 1932, in Bellingham. He was the son of John Byron and Clara Sophia (Harwick) Doyle. John grew up in Madison, and graduated there with the high school class of 1950. He went on to continue his education at Concordia College Moorhead, graduating in 1955.\n\nOn Nov. 17, 1962, John was united in marriage to Bonavieve “Bonny” Johnson at First Lutheran Church in Worthington. John soon enrolled at Mankato State College, where he completed his 2nd Bachelor of Science degree in 1964 majoring in Social Studies.\n\nJohn worked as a welfare caseworker and bank teller before finding his passion as a teacher. He spent over 30 years teaching social studies. Minneota Public Schools was his first position and then 24 years at the Marshall Middle School. He was proud to be a part of the new middle school concept in education that began in Marshall in 1969. Gov. Rudy Perpich honored him with the 1988-89 Excellence in Integrating “Agriculture in the Classroom” Teaching Award.\n\nIn his retirement, John worked as a Walmart greeter for 17 years, a GED educator, and sensory panelist for the Research and Development department of Schwan’s Food Company for 12 years.\n\nJohn was involved in just about everything. He enjoyed people and spent many hours visiting and sharing the company of a wide network of both family and friends. His passion for helping others naturally led to his teaching career, but it also fostered roles in many other areas. John was always passionate about his faith and active in his churches. He assisted at Grace Lutheran Church in Mankato and with the Luther League at Saint Paul’s Lutheran Church in Minneota, facilitated Bible studies at both St. Stephen Lutheran Church and First Lutheran Church in Marshall.\n\nOver the years, John also donated his time and talents as a 4-H leader and to the Jaycees, the Masons, Order of the Eastern Star, Sons of Norway, Marshall’s City Planning and Zoning Committee, Marshall City Council, the board of Advanced Opportunities, and he was past president of the Lyon County Historical Society. John enjoyed singing for more than 43 years with the Marshall Area Men Chorus, later known as the Southwest Minnesota Men’s Chorus. He especially enjoyed having his son and grandsons in the chorus also. In whatever spare time was left, John enjoyed cooking, reading, especially westerns, attending local sporting events, traveling across the United States and attending musical events.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 61 years, Bonny Doyle of Marshall; daughter, Karlyn (Tom Warnemunde) Doyle of St. Joseph; daughter-in-law, Angela Doyle of Walnut Grove; 4 grandchildren, Jocelyn (and Adam) Kleeberger, Jared Doyle (fiancé Lexie Vande Hoef), Jasmine Doyle (special friend Colton Crowell), Jacob Doyle; 3 great-grandchildren, Brielle, Layla, and Levi Kleeberger; brothers-in-law, Gary (Char) Lundborg, James Lovestrand, nieces, nephews, other relatives, and many friends.\n\nJohn was preceded in death by his parents; son, Sean-David Byron Doyle (in 2021); and sisters, Patricia “Patti” Lundborg and Karen Lovestrand.\n\nArrangements by\n\nHamilton Funeral Home\n\nMarshall, Minnesota\n\n507-532-2933\n\nwww.hamiltonfh.com"
