        "text": "_________________________________________________\n\nYoung Sergeant Pilots Arrive Safely Overseas\n\n(By HAROLD FAIR.) London, May 21, 1941 – (CP) — A contingent of young sergeant pilots from Canada's training fields, including Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders and Americans, stretched the stiffness out of their sea legs today after joining the throngs of Canadian fliers who preceded them here.\n\nSize of this latest contingent of Commonwealth Air Training Plan graduates was not made public. It was merely said they were all sergeant pilots.\n\nDuring the crossing by convoy from an Eastern Canadian port, they sighted no Nazi submarines nor aircraft. But they had a spell of bad weather and looked down grimly into the water at one drifting piece of ship wreckage that reminded them of Hitler's undersea warfare.\n\nAmong the Canadians were Howard Clark of Toronto, Raymond Goudreau of Quebec City, Omer Levesque of Mont Joli, Que.; D. Chapman of Vancouver, J. J. Doyle of Glace Bay, N.S.; H. R. McDonald of Edmonton, Bill Munn of Regina, J. F. Lambert of Winnipeg, George McClusky of Kirkland Lake, N. J. Ogilvie of Ottawa and Sid Ganon of Montreal.\n\nAdjutant of the voyage was stocky Bert Johnson of Windsor, Ont., who joined Royal Canadian Air Force headquarters in England as official photographer.\n\nAmong the Australians who received final training in Canada was Peter Kingsford-Smith, nephew of the late Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith, famous trans pacific flier. Four United States youths were in the group. They were Harry Garvin of New York City, Edwin Davis of East Orange, N.J.; James Walker of Corpus Christi, Tex., and J. B. Spangler of Bethlehem, Pa. \"They can leave us here as long as they want and you can't say too much for English hospitality,\" said Howard Clark. Looking wistfully into the sky as a flight of R.A.F. bombers roared over, he remarked: \"Boy, look at that formation. I'd sure like to be with them.\" Goudreau and Levesque said England was \"swell.\" Goudreau added, smiling: \"They ask us to speak French just to see what it sounds like.\"\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n23 July 1943 - Doyle (second guy from the left on wing) and his 417 Squadron mates.

PILOTS IN OLD COUNTRY FOR NEW DUTIES\n\nConvoy Reaches Britain Without Sighting Enemy Ships\n\nEAGER FOR ACTION\n\nLondon, May 22, 1941 — (CP Cable) — The latest group of Royal Canadian Air Force flyers — all sergeant pilots — has reached Great Britain safely, it was announced yesterday.\n\nOver the broad expanse of a famous Royal Air Force reception depot, the scores of young Canadians, latest graduates of the Commonwealth air training plan, roamed happily, regaining their land legs.\n\nThe convoy that brought them from Canada sighted neither Nazi submarines nor aircraft during the crossing. Only highlight commented on by the flyers was a spell of bad weather.\n\nThey saw evidence of Germany's sea warfare when they passed a piece of wreckage.\n\n\"They can leave us here as long as they want and you can't say too much for English hospitality,\" said Howard Clark, of Toronto. Looking wistfully into the sky as a flight of R.A.F. bombers roared over, he remarked: \"Boy, look at that formation. I'd sure like to be with them.\"\n\nEngland \"Swell\"\n\nRaymond Goudreau, of Quebec City, and Omer Levesque, of Mont Joli, Que., said England was \"swell.\" Goudreau added smiling: \"They ask us to speak French just to see what it sounds like.\"\n\nThe flyers crowded around Flying Officer Bert Johnson, former Windsor Daily Star photographer, when they saw him with his camera. Adjutant on the voyage, Johnson joined R.C.A.F. headquarters in England as official photographer.\n\nThe arrivals included D. Chapman, Vancouver; H. R. McDonald, Edmonton; Bill Munn, Regina; J. F. Lambert, Winnipeg; George McClusky, Kirkland Lake; N. J. Ogilvie, Ottawa; Sid Gannon, Montreal, and J. J. Doyle, Glace Bay, N.S.\n\nPeter Kingsford-Smith, nephew of the late Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith, famous Australian flyer, was among a contingent of Australian and New Zealand pilots who accompanied the Canadians.\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nItaly 1944 - F/O Bill Burgess, F/L Bill Pendelton & P/O Jack Doyle -\n\nApparently unhappy with the food, these pilots are \"debriefing\" the squadron cook.\n\n________________________________________\n\nDoyle's WW2 Claims - Dogfight Over Anzio\n\n\"ON March 29,1944, 417 Squadron took off from Marcianese to patrol the Anzio beachhead. I was leading Blue Section; F/L \"Topsy\" Turvey led Red Section. I was flying AN-R, JG 240.\n\nWe arrived on patrol, and our controller reported that 20 enemy aircraft were coming into the beachhead from the northeast. Both Red and Blue Sections saw the Me 109s and FW 190s crossing the coast to the north of Anzio. When they turned south to dive on Anzio, we turned to engage them. Topsy's section took on the top cover, and my section took on the others.\n\nI picked a 109 passing in front of me at about 175 yards, laid on deflection, and gave him a three-second burst. I could see strikes, he started to belch out a lot of black smoke, and down he went. People on the ground confirmed the crash.\n\nI had begun to attack a 190 when I was attacked by another, who set me afire. My No. 2, Cam Everett, took him off my hands. The fire went out, and I continued after my enemy through some flak. Through it all, I was hit four times and wounded in the back, right shoulder, head and face, and right side and leg.\n\nRegardless, I continued to chase the 190, firing burst after burst into him. I saw strikes and black smoke coming from him before my ammo ran out. My gun camera indicated he was probably destroyed.\n\nMy engine was running rough, and I was out of ammo, so I headed for the airstrip at Nettuno. As I descended for a forced landing, the engine quit! I landed very quickly. The fuselage, which had been hit behind my armor plate, right behind my head, broke off, and I skidded to a stop.\n\nAs I was being loaded into an ambulance, the American engineering officer who was in charge of the airstrip thanked me profusely for not landing on the PSP (perforated steel planking) and messing up his runway. As if I had any desire to! With my wheels up, I would have wrapped myself up in it.\"\n\nFrom SPITFIRE by Robert Bracken (recommended read)\n\nJack Doyle in Rome. June 12, 1944\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nI have no info on kill number 2.\n\nIt's possible that the \"probable\" mentioned above is it\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nDoyle's IAF missions :\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nOther sources give him credit for a Spitfire kill while with the IAF as well\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n23 September 1952 - Seems the RCAF did not frown too heavily on pilots who went to fight (illegally) for Israel in 1948. Some (ie- John McElroy) came back and reenlisted in the RCAF after the war. Here Doyle poses by a Sabre while a member of 421 Squadron based out of St. Hubert, Quebec."
