He was on the air in Western Oregon for 40 years.\n\nHe died this week at the age of 93, just a day and a half short of his 69th wedding anniversary with his wife, Betty.\n\nDoyle gave many people their first jobs in television news, and he mentored reporters and anchors who went on to great success over the years.\n\nDoyle reported the \"rough draft of history\" on many events that still stand large in Oregon history, like\n\n\"Power was going off all over, and trees were down. Everything was just falling apart in just a very short period of time,\" Doyle\n\nNo public memorial service is planned.\n\nKVAL News is working on a retrospective on Doyle's career."
