        "text": "John Doyle Young, 93, of Sioux City passed away Friday, November 11, 2022 surrounded by his family at his home.\n\nVisitation, with the family present, will be Friday, November 18, 2022 from 5-8 p.m. Rosary at 5 p.m. and Vigil Service beginning 7 p.m. at Meyer Brothers Colonial Chapel on Stone Park Blvd. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 10:00 a.m. Saturday, November 19, 2022 at St. Boniface Catholic Church. Those wishing to join virtually may do so by following this link: https://youtu.be/7zU0Ltql0Ok. Burial will follow at Calvary Cemetery with Military Honors. Online condolences may be given at www.meyerbroschapels.com.\n\nJohn was born November 12, 1928 in Reece, Kansas, the son of Oren Edward and Virginia Rose (Edwards) Young. He graduated from Sioux City East High School and enlisted in the United States Army at age 17. While stationed in Japan during WWII, John received a letter from his older sister, Winna Jean Young. She wrote, “I have just the right girl for you”. Upon his return, John met Mary Hupke and a one-year courtship followed. On December 31, 1949, he was united in marriage to the love of his life at St. Boniface Catholic Church. Over the years they were blessed with seven children. Mary preceded John in death on January 18, 2019.\n\nJohn worked for Sioux City Washer, Interstate Air Conditioning, and Bekins Furniture Store, before starting his own business, J. Young Appliance. All three sons were fortunate to have worked alongside their father. At the age of 79, John retired and the business continues to flourish today with his son, Mike Young, at the helm.\n\nJohn had many passions, was deeply devoted to his family, and freely gave his time to others. Early on, he enjoyed fishing and hunting with his brother-in-law and best friend, Howard Simmons. As his family grew, his interests turned to mastering the craft of woodworking and remodeling. He was proud of all the renovations he made to their house, transforming it into a beautiful home to raise their children. Later, John lent his talents to the game of golf and incredibly scored, not one, but three holes-in-one. Foremost, his mother’s Christian values were ever present as he embraced his Bible. John was a longtime active member of St. Boniface Parish, alongside his wife, where he served as a Eucharistic Minister.\n\nHe will be deeply missed by his children: John (Jeanette) Young, Toni Jones, Cheryl (Thomas) Fox, Monica (Michael) Berkes, Michael (Jacquine) Young, James (Joyce) Young, Theresa (Scott) Chamberlain, and additionally, Barbara (Allen) Boes; 28 grandchildren; 55 great-grandchildren; and sister-in-law, Margie Young.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; wife, Mary; siblings: Oren J. Young, Winna Jean (Jim) Dolphin, Robert L. Young, Audrey Irene (Howard) Simmons, and James E. Young; son-in-law, Thomas Jones; great-grandson, Tyler Ard; niece, Barbara Young (in infancy); and nephews, Roger Simmons and Joel Simmons.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to Hospice of Siouxland or Trinity Heights Queen of Peace Chapel Fund.\n\nEmbrace your sweet Mary, the love of your life, while dancing at Jesus’ feet. Let your love and wisdom continue to shine down, our beloved father, sweet grandpa and rock."
