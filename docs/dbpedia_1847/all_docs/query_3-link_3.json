He was facing the right way, the last round of a clip in the breech and three dead Germans in front of him. His name was Duff. After all is over - and the remainder of the Empire is understandably irritated with Ireland - I hope these countless Duffs, from both the North and the South, and in all three services, will be remembered.\n\n(Brigadier Nelson Russell, Commander 38 (Irish) Brigade, 1942-44)"
