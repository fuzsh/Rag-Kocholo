        "text": "Dr. John “Jack” Joseph Doyle, beloved husband of Noreen (Connolly) Doyle, died peacefully in Pittsburgh on August 15, 2023, at the age of 74. The son of the late Honorable Robert A. and Frances P. Doyle, he is survived by his siblings Kathy (Mike) Cosgrove; Sally Reagor; Tom (Joyce); Mary (Steve) Taylor; Alice (Mike) Yochum; Ray (Deb); and Trish (John) Burton. He is also survived by Michael (Patty), Tom, Peggy, Sean, and Paul (Alicia) Connolly and Mary (Tom) Zajac, Christie(Kevin) Graves, in addition to numerous nieces, nephews, great-nieces, great-nephews, and dear friends. Jack grew up in Carrick and graduated from St. Basil’s High School before obtaining a BS in Chemistry from Georgetown University and an MD from the University of Pittsburgh in 1971. He performed his medical internship and residency in Neurology at “University Health Center Hospitals of Pittsburgh”, under the tutelage of Dr. Henry B. Higman. He stayed at the University of Pittsburgh as an Assistant Professor beginning in 1978, rising to chief of the Division of Neurology at Western Penn Hospital in 1983. He left to complete a clinical EEG and EMG fellowship at the University of Minnesota, where he stayed on as faculty and became Medical Director of the Adult Neurology clinic. He returned to the University of Pittsburgh in 1996 and became director of the Neurology Resident Clinics in 2000. He served as Chief of the Division of General Neurology from 2005-2022, and Director of the Neurology Residency Program from 2006 to 2018. His honors and career accolades are numerous, marked by his excellence as a diagnostic physician and later a highly decorated teacher. Cherished by his many patients and residents, he was named the teacher of the Year at Western Penn and often earned the Residents’ Award for Excellence in Teaching. In 2010, he was awarded the highly coveted A.B. Baker Award by the AAN for Excellence in Teaching, followed by the AAN Program Director’s Recognition Award in 2016, awarded to only one program director nationwide. He was often honored within UPMC for both his dedication to teaching and leadership in the field of medical education. Additionally, Dr. Doyle was named one of the Best Doctors in Pittsburgh every year from 2016-19. His work as Director of Neurosciences for UPMC neurology residents left a lasting impact, as notes and remembrances poured in over the past few days. One resident encapsulated the overwhelming sentiment: “Thank you for mentoring and guiding all of us during residency. You and all your guidance made us the doctors and successful humans we are.” Jack was a consistent and cherished presence at gatherings, holidays, and milestones, he enjoyed being surrounded by loved ones and both guiding and witnessing the accomplishments of the next generation. He will be dearly missed by all who knew and loved him. Family and friends will be welcomed at Laughlin Cremation & Funeral Tributes 222 Washington Road, Mt. Lebanon on Friday 1-4 & 6-8 PM.
