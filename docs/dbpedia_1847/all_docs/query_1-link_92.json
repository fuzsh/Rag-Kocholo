        "text": "John A. Doyle\n\nSeptember 20, 1934 - December 7, 2022\n\nJohn A. Doyle was born on September 20, 1934, in Cassopolis, Michigan to the late John and Florence Doyle. From there his family moved to Laporte, Indiana and finally settled in Michigan City, Indiana.\n\nHe had two main passions in life, taking care of his family and his civil engineering and land surveying business. In October of 1955 he met his mentor Donald C. Ford when he applied for a job. Later, Mr. Ford colluded with his wife’s grandmother and made it possible for him to attend college (Although he was unaware of Mr. Fords part in the plot until much later.) John graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Civil Engineering in 1961 from Indiana Technical College. Prior to his attendance at college, he had worked as a member of the survey crew for the City Engineer of LaPorte, Indiana and in the same capacity for the construction of the cross-country Standard Oil pipeline. Those experiences led to his teaching first year courses in both the Civil Engineering and Land Surveying programs during the last two years of college.\n\nIn 1962 he established the first phase of his business as an associate firm with Donald C. Ford, Engineers, and Land Surveyors until he incorporated John Doyle & Associates as an independent entity in 1973. He was a Registered Civil Engineer and Land Surveyor in both Indiana and Michigan.\n\nDuring his 60 years in business, he has had an impact on everyone’s lives who visits or lives in northwestern Indiana. He may have planned and designed the roads you drive on and the storm and sanitary sewer systems you use. There is a chance that the design of the subdivision you live in, or the shopping centers you visit may have been a project in which he was involved. Even the bridge you cross, the highway interchange you drive on, or the grocery store parking lot you park in may have been the product of his pencil. His eldest daughter use to joke that you can park your boat, build your home in a subdivision, and flush your toilet because of her dad.\n\nThis is especially true for the Town of Trail Creek Indiana, where John served as consulting engineer from 1968-2021. He was the City Engineer for the City of LaPorte, IN from 1961-1962, the City Engineer for the city of Michigan City, IN from 1969-1972. From 1972-1984 he was a principal in the firm of United Blacktop Pavers. He continued working until 2 weeks prior to his death on December 7, 2022.\n\nAround 1967 Mel Fath began planning the construction of New Durham Estates in Westville, IN and selected John Doyle & Associates at random from the phone book. That was the beginning of a lifelong friendship between the two men and their wives, Jean Anne, and Thelma. Mel and John talked every morning for over 40 years until Mel’s death in 2020.\n\nHe enjoyed old cars, Indy and NASCAR car racing, Stroh’s beer, the Green Bay Packers, (sometimes the Chicago Bears) and Jim Beam with soda and the “fur bearing beast(s)” in his home. He was an honest and loyal man who inspired loyalty in others, especially Darryl Wright and Jeff Swanson who have worked for him for over 20 years.\n\nJohn leaves behind his wife of 66 years, Jean Anne, his daughters Eileen and Kate, his “favorite” nephew Tom Doyle, his dog Cooper, grand dogs Morgan and Thumper and grand kitties Blossom and Hermes.\n\nIn lieu of flowers the family requests donations be made to the Michigan City Salvation Army or the Humane Society of your choice.\n\nVisitation will be at the Ott/Haverstock Funeral Chapel at 418 Washington Street, Michigan City, Indiana on December 13, 2022, from 4-8pm, and on December 14, 2022, from 11am-1pm. John loved a good story, and the family would like nothing more than to hear your memories of him during visitation hours, in writing and/or on the tribute wall on the Ott/Haverstock website (www.otthaverstock.com). The burial will be private. There will be no service"
