        "text": "22 years after he was shot down and tortured in Iraq, John Nichol returns to enemy territory to find a new generation of fearless fighter pilots in action over Afghanistan\n\nWe were running from the target area; the Tornado was doing 600mph, just 50ft above the desert, as we screamed out of the danger zone.\n\nWe had just completed our attack run on the giant Ar Rumaylah airfield in South-East Iraq – our bombing mission had been a failure and we were heading home dejected, tails between our legs, wondering what our mates would say about making a cock-up of our very first war operation.\n\nThe question became academic; a heat-seeking surface-to-air missile slammed into the right-hand engine. It was like being hit by an express train. As the titanium-laced missile warhead exploded, the 30-ton jet was blasted sideways like a leaf in the wind.\n\nAs the sand loomed towards my cockpit I screamed at my pilot to fight for control; if we hit the ground, only one thing was certain – we would die.\n\nMy pilot managed to wrest back control of the jet, and, still wallowing dangerously, we struggled away from the deadly desert floor. Just then, a radar-guided anti-aircraft gun opened up on us.\n\nThe engine was on fire, the on-board computers were out of action, and one of our own missiles had ignited and was now acting like a welder’s torch, steadily cutting off the right-hand wing. The warning panel had lit up like a Christmas tree and the sirens were screaming in my headset.\n\nLooking back, I could see that the tail of the jet had disappeared in a furnace of flames, which were now marching steadily towards my seat in the rear cockpit of the aircraft. I keyed the transmit button on the radio: ‘Ejecting, ejecting.’\n\nThe phone call came as I walked the dog on a balmy summer afternoon last year; the caller’s number showed as ‘unknown’ and there was silence on the line. I was about to hang up when a voice crackled faintly: ‘Please hold, you have a call from Afghanistan.’\n\nSeconds later, the dulcet tones of an old RAF friend echoed across 3,500 miles. ‘Hey, JN, why don’t you get your backside out here to Afghanistan – come and see how things have changed since your time, and how the RAF war-fights these days.’\n\nIt was a worrying and unwanted invitation; my last excursion into hostile territory had ended in disaster. In fact, it nearly cost me my life.\n\nIn 1991, alongside my pilot John Peters (JP), I was involved in the first Gulf War to evict Saddam Hussein’s invading forces from occupied Kuwait. On the first day of the operation our Tornado jet was blasted out of the sky by a surface-to-air missile. We were captured, beaten and paraded on television, provoking worldwide condemnation of Saddam’s brutal regime and leaving one of the enduring images of that war. During my subsequent seven-week ordeal in Iraq, there were many times when I thought I might die – and two occasions when I very nearly did.\n\nSo, as our forces prepare to withdraw from Afghanistan, I am not too ashamed to admit that the invitation to return to a war zone aroused a real sense of trepidation. As a civilian friend asked in astonishment: ‘Why would you want to go out there? You nearly died last time!’\n\nBut perhaps only those from a military background would understand; I was immensely proud to have been asked to return to the front line. My own war had lasted a mere seven weeks and at its conclusion I firmly believed we had done the right thing, that our mission had been a success. This generation has been fighting in Afghanistan for more than ten years and plans are well under way to bring them all home; I was eager to discover how they will look back on their role in their war.\n\nThere was no doubt I was heading towards the danger zone – it was the dead of night, the RAF TriStar aircraft was blacked out and the crew were wearing body armour.\n\nEven on board the aircraft heading towards Camp Bastion – the British military fortress in the middle of the Helmand desert – the signs of a new generation at war were on display. One of the military ‘in-flight’ magazines carried a story of a recent awards ceremony I’d attended in London where troops had been honoured for their courage and dedication in Afghanistan; it had been a beer-filled night of celebration.\n\nBut the magazine also had a page entitled ‘In Memoriam’ listing those who had recently made the ultimate sacrifice in the war-torn country that I was heading towards.\n\nDespite my initial trepidation, and nearly 17 years after I left the RAF, it felt good to be back in the heart of the military environment. There was a homecoming comfort in the reams of barbed wire, the orange glow of sodium lights and the clatter of helicopters. And within minutes of landing I’d slipped back into the easy banter of military life.\n\nHowever, while much of the humour and camaraderie of the RAF I’d joined in 1981 remains, I would discover that in every other respect, it is a completely different organisation today.\n\nThe first indication of this change came during my visit to the Tornado squadron at Kandahar Airfield, some 100 miles east of Camp Bastion, where Squadron Leader Joe Doyle and Flight Lieutenant Guy Gibbons of IX (Bomber) Squadron gave me a guided tour.\n\nTo say that the aircraft I crewed as a navigator has changed beyond all recognition is a monumental understatement: it still looks the same, but that’s where any similarities end. At the start of my Gulf War in 1991, we were proficient in deploying three types of weapon – all of them ‘dumb’, or ‘non-precision’. Guy and Joe showed me a giddy array of guided weapons and electronic sensors that gave them, and their commanders on the ground, an astonishing overview of the battlefield and the means of destroying anything from a reinforced bunker to a single insurgent.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, their Tornado is now equipped with an incredible self-defence system designed to mitigate the threat from surface-to-air missiles. Looking in awe at this incredible capability, I did pause to wonder if I would have had the capacity to master it all, or rather more wryly, if it might have saved me from being shot down.\n\nThis modern RAF is very different to the one I joined in 1981. We never expected to go to war; we were a Cold War air force, flying aircraft designed to deliver nuclear Armageddon. It is fair to say that ‘my RAF’ was surprised by the call to arms for the war against Iraq.\n\nOur Tornado jets were painted green and black to provide camouflage for our low-level dash across the German plains. The logistics of repainting them all the colour of sand took months to complete.\n\nAs a young airman joining my first unit, my sergeant had ordered me to go to the local military supplies shop to buy, with my own money, some decent boots and a rucksack. Ten years later, the day after landing in the Gulf in green flying suits, my boss told me to go to the local tailor, who would quickly run up a few sand-coloured flying suits. At least the RAF was paying this time.\n\nThe modern crewrooms I saw in Kandahar are very different to the one I inhabited in Bahrain in 1991, where overflowing ashtrays littered every surface and a thick pall of smoke filled the air. And there was always a healthy supply of chilled beer – to be consumed after landing of course.\n\nToday, all that has changed, but perhaps the greatest difference I discovered was in the skill and preparedness of the men, and women, who now fly these amazing machines.\n\nSitting in a briefing room with Joe and Guy, sharing a brew, I was amazed at how the military mind-set had evolved since my days as a young Tornado navigator. Twenty-nine-year-old Guy’s take on his role as a military pilot in the modern world was a revelation. Aged only seven when I had been shot down, the images of my war were fixed in his head and he was determined to fly those jets.\n\nJoining the RAF in 2005, he has known nothing other than war-fighting, and although a relatively junior pilot, he had already cut his teeth flying combat operations over Libya before deploying to Afghanistan.\n\n‘I joined an organisation knowing I would go on operations – almost looking forward to it,’ he told me. I knew exactly what Guy meant. No one wants to kill, or to be killed, but it is what we sign up to do and conflict is a brutal reality of our modern world.\n\nBut there is another side to their new world. Passionate and confident, Guy described the feeling of wanting to ‘make a difference’, of watching Misrata in Libya burn, of knowing Benghazi was next.\n\n‘We needed to do something and it was humbling to influence what was happening. That’s what I joined the Air Force for and I can’t think of anything else I would rather do with my life.’\n\nThe notion of ‘making a difference’ had never entered my head when I wandered into the RAF recruiting office aged 16 – I simply wanted a job.\n\nAnd the young generation who have replaced me in the ranks are a different breed in ability and training. The airman who showed me the surveillance and intelligence systems had been a barrister before joining the RAF; his sergeant told me that this young man had recently carried out ‘life-saving analysis’ of intelligence material.\n\nThe military policeman, a relatively junior corporal, who took me on a security patrol of the base, was armed not only with a pistol, rifle and machine gun, but also with a degree in criminology.\n\n‘Ejecting, ejecting!’ It was a call I could never have imagined making when I joined up in 1981; now, as the inferno blazed inside my Tornado, the only chance of survival was to pull that handle. As the straps tightened and ejection-seat rockets fired, it was as though a giant hand had dragged me from my perch by the shoulders and tossed me like a rag doll into the centre of a hurricane.\n\nAmid the roar of the rockets, the tumbling and falling, there was a ‘crack’, my parachute opened; I hit the ground like a sack of potatoes. Just a few hours earlier, I’d been part of a band of brothers, excited, proud and eager to prove ourselves. My brothers were now heading home to safety; I was standing in the middle of the enemy’s desert. I was very alone, and very afraid.\n\nUnder a hail of bullets, I was captured and dragged off to Baghdad. And now I really was in trouble. My time in the Iraqi interrogation centre was one of brutality, pain and fear. It started with good old-fashioned beatings and I could actually smell them before they fell on me. A group of soldiers punched and kicked me to the ground. Blood flowed from my nose, thick and grimy on my teeth. They would stop when they were bored or exhausted. Or I would die."
