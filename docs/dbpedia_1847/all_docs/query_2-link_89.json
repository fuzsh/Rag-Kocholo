        "text": "Dublin Port’s Emergency Story\n\nLDF veteran – Oliver Joseph Doyle\n\nAs part of our newest project on Dublin Port during the Emergency (1939 – 1946) period we met today and interviewed Oliver Joseph Doyle from Stella Gardens, Irishtown, Dublin.\n\nOliver who is 98, worked as a iron moulder, but during the Emergency he served with the Local Defence Force (LDF). He first served with an infantry unit based in the RDS before transferring to an anti-aircraft unit in Ringsend.\n\nThe anti-aircraft positions around Dublin were vital to the defence of Dublin Port. Oliver told us that his father, Mathew Doyle, also served with the Maritime Inscription and LDF in Dublin Port.\n\nThank you to Lucan Lodge Nursing Home for facilitating our meeting today."
