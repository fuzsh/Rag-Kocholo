        "text": "With the support of the Directorate for Higher Education and Skills (HK-dir)’s NOTED program, the Faculty of Education and Arts at Nord University, Norway and the Faculty of Education at Queen’s University, Canada, in cooperation with local schools in the Nordland, Trøndelag, and Ontario regions, have joined to establish the CANOPY Project (Canada-Norway Pedagogy Partnership for Innovation and Inclusion in Education). This partnership aims to address, from a holistic and international perspective, the most pressing issues currently facing the education sector to better prepare the next generation of teachers. Connecting educational research, classroom experience, student mobility, and institutional management, CANOPY will develop global competencies in pedagogy, research, and training through international collaboration.\n\nFounded in 1841, Queen’s is one of Canada’s leading universities with an international reputation for the outstanding academic quality of its students and faculty. We were recently voted #1 one in Canada among international undergraduate students in the International Student Barometer. Queen’s University takes an inclusive approach and offers learning beyond the classroom; this experience includes the most clubs per capita of any Canadian University as well as a robust international exchange program with more than 220 partners.\n\nRated one of the 5 great university towns in the world by the BBC, Kingston is a charming mid-sized city of some 120,000 people that combines the cultural, social and artistic benefits of a larger city with the tranquility and intimacy of a small town.\n\nThe city is scenically located in the beautiful Thousand Islands region of Eastern Ontario, where Lake Ontario empties into the majestic St Lawrence River, and is conveniently located within three hours of Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa by road or rail, and is only half an hour from the US border. Kingston is also accessible via air, with flights arriving and departing from the Norman Rogers airport.\n\nHome to Canada’s first prime minister, Kingston’s rich history is alive in beautiful 19th century limestone architecture and over 20 museums and national historic sites.\n\nThe city also boasts a large number of restaurants, with over 100 in a 9 block radius downtown. There are lots of different cuisines on offer, and the eateries are close to live entertainment venues including the K-Rock Centre (home of the Kingston Frontenacs hockey team), Confederation Park, and Market Square, which regularly see live music, sports, and cultural events throughout the year. Annual events include Chili Fest, Movies in the Square, Limestone City Blues Festival, Feb Fest, Music in the Park, and much, much more.\n\nFind out more about Kingston."
