        "text": "For Daniel Clark (B.S. ’60), one of his most impactful periods occurred as a Fine Arts and Fine Arts Education student at Teachers College. In honor of his memorable time at the College and his nearing centennial birthday, Clark is making a planned gift to TC that will establish the Daniel G. Clark Endowed Scholarship for students in the Art and Art Education program.\n\n“TC is a cherished part of my roots. Graduating from TC was the fulfillment of my hopes for a steady life and career in America,” explained Clark, a Scotsman with dual citizenship to the U.S. who is striving to pay forward the help he received by ensuring future art students can benefit from a TC education. “Today, art has gone in many [directions]. I believe that TC will show them the right way.”\n\nScholarships like this support a diverse and talented group of students who are committed to art education. It enables students to better focus on their academic journey and enter their art professions with less financial burden.\n\nClark traveled to the U.S. to attend TC—a decision that would inform the trajectory of his life. In 1956, Clark worked in book and magazine layout design at McGraw-Hill. After graduating from the College in 1960, he went on to become an associate professor at the College of Staten Island (CSI), a college within the City University of New York (CUNY).\n\nWhile at CSI, he published an essay titled “Toward Understanding In Art,” which was well-received in New York and London, England.\n\n“It could be said that TC gave me the extra authority to write about art education,” said Clark, who remembers the support he received from TC faculty members, such as the late Arthur R. Young, during his studies. He recalls a note that Young, who taught contemporary art, wrote to Clark: “These papers are a pleasure to read—and not because your thinking appears to coincide with mine—they are a pleasure because of the involvement in art which they express.”\n\nIn addition to working in academia, Clark also worked as a picture librarian at the New York Public Library in 1962. Now retired, Clark’s membership to the College’s Grace Dodge Society gives special meaning to his life after losing his wife in 2020.\n\n“From my point of view, sixty-two years after graduation from TC, and the isolated age of 99, I have a family again.”\n\nLearn more about making a planned gift to TC or becoming a Grace Dodge Society member here."
