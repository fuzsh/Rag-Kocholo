        "text": "Biography\n\nCiaran comes to the Department of Classics at NUIG for his second postdoctoral project on 'Intentional Obscurity and \"Divine Speech\" in Early English Texts', funded by the Irish Research Council Individual Postdoctoral Research Fellowship scheme. His first project, 'Obscurity and Textual Concealment in Early Medieval England' (2017-2020), was funded by The Leverhulme Trust's Early Career Postdoctoral Research Fellowship, and was hosted by Queen's University Belfast\n\nIn this time, Ciaran has published his first monograph ‘Charms’, Liturgies, and Secret Rites in Early Medieval England (Boydell, 2018), and is now working on publishing a second, provisionally entitled O Ineffabile: Intentional Obscurity in Early Medieval England. His second book seeks to reconsider the nature of early medieval ‘gibberish’ writing in the context of biblical, Patristic, and medieval hermeneutic and exegetical traditions and interests in obscurity. He is also co-editing a collection of essays, entitled Creating Knowledge in the Early Medieval Book: Practices of Collecting and Concealing, with Dr Sinead O'Sullivan (QUB), and he has published on various aspects of early medieval history, literature, and manuscript studies.\n\nHaving obtained BA Hons (English & Philosophy) and MA (Medieval Studies) degrees at Queen's University Belfast, Ciaran completed his PhD in the University of Kent (Centre for Medieval and Early Modern Studies) in 2015 on 'The Liturgy of “Charms” in Anglo-Saxon England’ (supervised by Dr Helen Gittos), which formed the basis of his first book."
