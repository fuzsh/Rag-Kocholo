Below you will find details of Oxonians who have competed in Olympic and Paralympic Games, listed by athlete, medal type and year.\n\nThis list may not be definitive and we would be delighted to hear from you regarding other Oxonians who need to be included. For some athletes from many years ago, we are struggling to identify the Oxford college they attended â€“ can you help? We also invite any stories to help bring these names and achievements to life.
