        "text": "Brent Belzberg, LLD\n\nBrent Belzberg formed TorQuest in 2002 following the 2001 sale of Harrowston, Inc., a publicly traded private equity fund he founded in 1992.\n\nPrior to that Mr. Belzberg restructured multi-billion dollars of debt for a family holding company.\n\nMr. Belzberg has more than 30 years of executive management experience in finance, acquisitions, corporate restructuring, and operations.\n\nMr. Belzberg served as chairman of Mount Sinai Hospital and its Foundations Board of Directors from 2012 to 2020. Prior to that he was chairman of Mount Sinai Hospital Foundations Patient Safety and Quality Committee from 2006 to 2010, and chairman of the Resource Committee from 2003 to 2006. He previously held directorships at CIBC where he chaired the Management Resource Committee, and its Risk Committee; held directorships at O&Y REIT; and Four Seasons Hotel. He has been a director of many of the TorQuest Partners portfolio companies, and currently serves as a Director of Sinai Health System. He is a member of the Investment Advisory Committee of the University of Toronto.\n\nMr. Belzberg received a B.Comm. (Honours) from Queen's University in 1972, and a J.D. from the University of Toronto in 1976. He received the Arbor Award from the University of Toronto, the Canada 150 Commemorative Medal from the Senate of Canada, and the Sovereign’s Medal for Volunteers from the Governor General. Most recently, in December 2018, Mr. Belzberg was awarded the Order of Canada as a Member (C.M.) for his work as a business leader and philanthropist.\n\nDavid Bottrill, LLD\n\nIt’s undeniable that the merits of diversity lay at the heart of David Bottrill’s vast discography. With artists like Peter Gabriel, Smashing Pumpkins, Tool, Muse, I Mother Earth, Crown Lands and Rush, David’s work spans genres and generations, lending to a sound that is both familiar and progressive. He’s cultivated the aggressive hard-rock palette of bands like Stone Sour, Godsmack, and Coheed and Cambria, while maintaining a connection to other ends of the spectrum with artists like Elsiean and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.\n\nWith three Grammy Awards and the success of millions of copies sold worldwide, David has produced and mixed career-defining albums that have established paradigms and redefined genres. “I prefer to work on music that has a strong identity and shows elements of originality,” David states, “genre isn’t really important.” It’s this focus on identity and potential that inspires David to push artists to curate the best of themselves and make music that defines who they are in that moment. And yet, even in their individuality, each album that David works on distinctly shows his fingerprint. David spent 20 years living in the UK, followed by a term in New York, but has settled back in Toronto, Canada, for the time being, to be closer to his hometown. Despite his roots, David still spends much of his time working with artists in various international locations.\n\nSince 2009, David has also sat on the board of directors for Make Music Matter, a non-profit that uses music and socially conscious art to help heal trauma in marginalized communities around the world and Indigenous communities at home in Canada. Through Make Music Matter, David has found an outlet for his experience, truly helping better the lives of others and bringing awareness to the community at large.\n\nRt. Hon.

NourbeSe Philip was born on the island of Tobago in the “huddled hunchbacked hills” of Woodlands, Moriah, where the blue of sky and ocean often appears as one. She studied at the University of the West Indies, Mona, Jamaica and took graduate degrees in political science and in law at Western University London, Ontario. She practised law for seven years in the space-time of Toronto where she still lives as an unembedded poet without ambition, essayist, novelist, playwright, reader and thinker. Her first collection of poetry, Thorns, was published in 1980. A further four books of poetry have followed including the seminal She Tries Her Tongue; Her Silence Softly Breaks and Looking for Livingstone: An Odyssey of Silence.\n\nHer published fiction includes the young-adult novel Harriet’s Daughter, a now-classic work that navigates the adolescent friendship between two girls of Caribbean background living in Toronto, while her dramatic work includes Coups and Calypsos, produced in both London and Toronto in 1996. Her essay collections, including her most recent, BlanK, are in the tradition of the socially and politically engaged poets, novelists and artists of the Caribbean. Alongside her poetry they articulate a powerful and decades-long engagement with issues generated by the destructive legacies of colonialism in both the Caribbean and Canada, even as they display a lifelong concern with the possibilities afforded by language to interrogate and remake these legacies.\n\nZong! As told to the author by Setaey Adamu Boateng, first published in the US and Canada in 2008, takes its title and subject from the massacre on board in the slave ship Zong in 1781, when the captain ordered that some 150 enslaved Africans be thrown overboard to their deaths so that the ship’s owners could claim insurance monies. Zong!, the poem, is a conceptually innovative, genre-breaking epic, which explodes the legal archive as it relates to slavery, and creates an anti-narrative lament that stretches the boundaries of the poetic form. It remains a haunting lifeline between archive and memory, law and poetry.\n\nAmong her awards are numerous Canada Council and Ontario Arts Council grants, including the prestigious Chalmers Award (Ontario Arts Council), the Canada Council’s Victor Martyn Lynch-Staunton Award (Outstanding mid-career artist), as well as the Pushcart Prize (USA), the Casa de las Americas Prize (Cuba), the Lawrence Foundation Prize (USA), the Arts Foundation of Toronto Writing and Publishing Award (Canada), and Dora Award finalist (drama, Canada).

E.) designation; the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Medal; the Canadian Association of Black Lawyers’ Pathfinder Award; and the McGill Principal’s Prize for Excellence in Teaching.\n\nDaniel Christmas, LLD\n\nDaniel Christmas, a lifelong resident of the Mi’kmaw community of Membertou, has been active in a number of international, national, provincial and local organizations in a range of fields including Aboriginal and treaty rights, youth, justice, policing, education, health care, human rights, adult training, business development and the environment.\n\nHe is the first Mi'kmaw individual to be appointed to the Senate of Canada and sits as an independent and made sure to open a constituency office, a step not normally taken by those appointed to the upper house. Senator Christmas reasoned that he wanted to ensure he was available year-round, in his community, for those with questions, concerns, ideas, and issues.\n\nSenator Christmas is also a consultant with Membertou Quality Management Services, providing services to a number of Mi’kmaw organizations. He has served with or chaired many provincial and national boards, advisory committees, and organizations.

This work then contributed to a Supreme Court of Canada ruling (Simon v. The Queen, 1985) in a case associated with a 1752 treaty concerning hunting rights, which recognized the validity of the treaty and confirmed that it continued to provide a right to hunt for Mi'kmaw peoples.\n\nSenator Christmas' priorities for his time in government include using his experience and position to assist the federal government in rebuilding its relationships with the Indigenous peoples of Canada. He was the Senate sponsor of Bill C-68, which proposed amending the Fisheries Act to require the government to consider any adverse effects a decision made under the Act may have on the rights of Indigenous peoples of Canada. Senator Christmas also plans to press for the involvement of Indigenous peoples in major energy sector projects and for more work to be done against sexual exploitation and modern slavery.\n\nSenator Christmas has been active in a number of international, national, provincial, and local agencies in a wide range of fields, including Indigenous and treaty rights, justice, policing, education, health care, human rights, adult training, business development, and the environment.\n\nSenator Christmas spent his time with the Membertou First Nation focusing on how to recover from a financial situation close to bankruptcy, with 95% unemployment, eventually resulting in the recovery of the community to a profitable status with a ten-fold growth in labour force and revenue.\n\nEvelyn Forget, DSc\n\nEvelyn L Forget is an economist whose research has been dedicated to ensuring that everyone has access to the tools and resources they need to live full lives. She has advocated for a basic income guarantee that would offer financial support to those living below the poverty line, without shame and without making resources conditional on meeting arbitrary regulations.\n\nBorn and raised in Scarborough Ontario, she first came across the idea of a basic income guarantee as a psychology undergraduate at Glendon College when she accidentally found herself in an economics class trying to fulfill a university requirement. One day, her economics professor came to class with a story about a massive Canadian social experiment on guaranteed income then underway. She was so intrigued that she changed her major to economics and nothing was ever the same again.\n\nProfessor Forget went on to do a PhD in economics at the University of Toronto, and then moved to Winnipeg where she was Professor of Economics at the University of Manitoba until 2000. She published many books and articles in various areas of economics, but poverty was always central to her analysis. In 2000, she was hired as Professor of Community Health Sciences at the University of Manitoba. Anyone working in healthcare recognizes very quickly that we spend a lot of time and money treating the effects of poverty in our healthcare system. Our Emergency Departments are full of people who have lived hard lives, showing the effects of poor housing, inadequate diets and poor working conditions at far too young an age.\n\nProfessor Forget’s research into this important and too-often neglected aspect of health policy has transformed international research, and helped move discussion from the political margins to serious policy consideration. She has advised policymakers and researchers around the world. Her work has received international media coverage, and featured in a documentary that opened at the Geneva International Film Festival and Forum on Human Rights in 2018.\n\nProfessor Forget has received many awards and prizes from academic societies. She is Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, past president of the History of Economics Society and an Officer of the Order of Canada. Her most recent books are Basic Income for Canadians: from the COVID-19 emergency to financial security for all (Lorimer and Co., 2020) and (with Hannah Owczar) Radical Trust: Basic Income for Complicated Lives.\n\nHelen Humphreys, LLD\n\nHelen Humphreys is the award-winning author of four books of poetry, nine novels, and six works of creative non-fiction.

The OIB Development Corporation (OIBDC) was formed in 1988 under Louie’s leadership. As CEO, he has developed over eleven successful on-reserve, OIB-owned\n\nbusinesses and five joint ventures in pursuit of economic self-sufficiency for the community.\n\nFor over 30 years, Chief Clarence Louie has been a champion for the Osoyoos Indian Band’s working culture, inspiring generations not only within the ban but around the world with his message about self-empowerment through employment, hard work, and community building. Louie is quoted widely in media and is a highly sought-after speaker for his strong and straightforward views on the link between economic development and First Nations self-reliance. Known for doing business in a modern First Nations context, Chief Louie wants to build an ‘indigenous economy’ where First Nations business people and leaders not only participate in the mainstream of Canada’s business economy, but more and more, take a stronger leadership position to shape environmentally and socially responsible outcomes that still feed the bottom line.\n\nAs Chief, he negotiated settlement of three specific land claims with the B.C. government, the settlement of more than 1,000 acres of lease land development, and the expansion of the OIB reserve by hundreds of acres of land. In 2000, Louie joined the Governor General of Canada on a leadership tour, and in 2001, he was appointed to the board of Aboriginal Business Canada, becoming chair in 2007.

She was born near Churchill Falls, Labrador; however, in the early 1960s, her family and community was relocated to Sheshatshiu, Labrador with the promises of a better, more easier life. By the time they expressed a desire to return, development of Churchill Falls and the creation of the Smallwood Reservoir had destroyed the traditional hunting grounds off which they lived. Her campaigns have inspired countless to advocate for legal and environmental rights, both in Canada and internationally.\n\nTshaukuesh's high profile work began with leading the Innu community's campaign against NATO's low-level flying and bomb testing on Innu land in the 1980s and 1990s. She stayed the course despite going to jail with nine others as a result of their actions. She then moved on to a role as a key respondent in a legal case related to the \"colour of right\", in which a judge held that the Innu could occupy a Canadian Forces base in Goose Bay, Labrador.\n\nOne of Tshaukuesh's primary goals has always been to pass along what she learned from her elders and own experiences to others. She has taught people from around the world about Innu culture for over two decades, often during multi-day or multi-week canoe trips and walks in the Mealys Mountains and surrounding bush during summer and winter.\n\nHer book, Nitinikiau Innusi: I Keep The Land Alive (2020), was composed based on her diaries from 1987 to 2016 and describes in detail her day-to-day life and thoughts on Innu politics, culture, land, and history.\n\nAlexis Puentes, LLD\n\nAlexis Puentes is a multiple Latin Grammy/Grammy/Juno winning singer-songwriter/producer/musician, born Alexis Puentes in Artemisa, Cuba. He was immersed in music at a very young age, joining his father’s (guitarist and teacher Valentin Puentes) group of 24 guitarists. Alex then went on to study electric and upright bass and touring and recording nationally and internationally. His sound is the unique confluence of tradition and global influences in articulate arrangements that convey emotions through melody and lyric.\n\nThough raised in Artemisa, an hour outside of Havana, Alexis Puentes’ artistry is as far-flung as the place he has set- tled and lived for over ten years: Smithers, BC, 14 hours north of Vancouver. His music at once incorporates his Cuban roots and is a unique amalgam of styles from funk, pop to soul. Collaborating with peers ranging from Nelly Furtado and Jason Mraz to Ron Sexsmith and Jim Cuddy to Pablo Milanes and Lionel Garcia.\n\nA forward-thinking, indie-minded artist, Alex has amassed a steadily growing following among critics and fans, garnering over 20 awards and nominations to his name, including a Grammy Award and 4 Latin Grammys and two Junos Awards. Over the course of 8 albums Alex has explored and expanded on his Cuban and international influences. Uplifting and bright to soulful and philosophical, his songs will speak to the listener though melody as well as lyrics. In 2022 Alexis Puentes’ 8th studio release, Mendó, won a Grammy for Best Latin Pop Album where he won as artist, producer and engineer.\n\nOvercoming obstacles of politics and cliché, Alex’s music rises above commonly held notions of Cuban music and makes a space to understand more about bringing together different genres to create something new, about being accepted on your own terms and forging a path for others to follow. His journey has included being at the forefront of independent artists entrepreneurs, concurrent with raising a family of three wonderful children.\n\nRomek (Robbie) Waisman, LLD\n\nRomek (Robbie) Waisman was born in 1931 in Poland. He was raised in a very close family and community according to the traditions of the Orthodox Jewish faith.\n\nWhen the Nazi army invaded Poland in September 1939, Waisman was to stay with friends who were not of the Jewish faith. He soon returned to his family, but was relocated to his city's Jewish ghetto in 1941. He was subsequently put to work in the city's munitions factory for two years, but was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp in 1944. The camp was liberated by the American military in April 1945; however, the children of the camp were required to stay for an additional three months given many had become orphans and had no homes.\n\nIn 1949, after time spent in various French villages where the Buchenwald orphans were housed with families, Waisman chose to emigrate to Canada, first to Calgary, then Saskatoon where he met his wife, and finally Vancouver in 1978.\n\nIn 1983, charges were laid against a public school teacher in Alberta for spreading antisemitism in his classes. This incident caused Waisman to reflect on his experiences during the Holocaust and to confront the threat of Holocaust denial. He chose to take an active role in Holocaust education, speaking to the public at various events and publishing a book, \"None is Too Many\". He became highly involved in the work of the Vancouver Holocaust Centre Society, serving as its Treasurer, Vice-President, and President since the 1980s.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Waisman became involved in work with Indigenous communities and acted as a key figure in conversations between the Canadian Jewish Congress and the Assembly of First Nations, eventually traveling across British Columbia and to the Northwest Territories to speak to residential school survivors about shared experiences of persecution, violence, and ongoing trauma. Waisman was declared an honorary witness by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2011 and has spoke alongside its Chairman, Justice Murray Sinclair, in a summit on historical trauma and injustice in 2012. Having survived the horrors of the Holocaust and discovered the importance and healing power of sharing one’s painful experiences, he became involved in helping residential schools survivors find the strength to speak up about the horrors they experienced and the impact these have had on their lives and families. Together with TRC head Justice Murray Sinclair, Waisman traveled the country for two years, meeting with many of the estimated 80,000 surviving residential school students to share his story and to listen to theirs.\n\nWaisman made a crucial recommendation that was adopted by the commission. The Holocaust survivor told Sinclair that he had not been able to speak about his wartime experiences to his own children — and that it wasn’t until they overheard him speaking later to school groups that they learned what he had gone through. “Based on that, when we go to a community, we bring all the [residential school] survivors in and we always make a point to bring their children in so that when the survivors are talking to us, the children are hearing them,” Sinclair told the Jewish Independent. “That proved to be an exceptionally strong piece of advice for us to open the lines of communication within families. From the perspective of residential school survivors, often the most important process of reconciliation that they wanted to engage in, that they needed to engage in, was to apologize to their own families for how they behaved after residential schools and to be given an act of forgiveness by their children, their spouses, their family members,” he said.\n\nDaniel Bader, LLD\n\nDaniel Bader, President and CEO of Bader Philanthropies, is a respected corporate leader, entrepreneur, and philanthropist, whose leadership of the Bader Foundation has transformed the lives of some of society’s most vulnerable.

Around this same time, he began a series of CBC radio interviews with host David Suzuki that continued periodically into the 1990s. In 1994, he became editor of SkyNews, Canada’s national astronomy magazine. When the Discovery Channel began broadcasting in Canada in 1995, he reported on significant astronomical events for over a decade.\n\nAmong his numerous awards are the New York Academy of Science’s Children’s Book of the Year, the Royal Canadian Institute’s Sandford Fleming Medal and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific’s Klumpke-Roberts Award.
