Subsequent to that confidential notice and after a minimum 15-day period in which the filer may respond to the notice, the Commission shall send a Notice of Delinquency (\"NOD\") to the filer and to the filer's appointing authority, or the majority leaders of the two houses of the Legislature if the filer is a State elected official or legislative staff.\n\nSubsequent to the issuance of an NOD, the Commission may initiate an enforcement proceeding against the filer. Any individual determined to have knowingly and willfully violated the provisions of Public Officers Law ยง 73-a may be subject to a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $40,000.\n\nNotices of delinquency are publicly-available records of the Commission and may be requested by clicking the 'Records Request' link in the footer of the website."
