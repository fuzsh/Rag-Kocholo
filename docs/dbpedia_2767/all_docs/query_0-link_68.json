Without children of her own, she dedicates the Barrett Fellowship to success of future generations. Sandy came from a family of modest means in Quincy, Michigan. While her family encouraged her to extend her education, they were unable to pay for her attendance.

All four of us graduated from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, from there we went on to different colleges. My sister Gloria and I were the only ones to follow in our father’s footsteps by attending Michigan State College. He was a Michigan Agricultural College in the Poutry Division alongside his friend John Hannah in the 20’s. Gloria was a student there for one year when she met and married All-American football star Don McAuliffe, Class of ’53. I graduated in June 1954 with a BA degree in Education and Speech Therapy. My first employer was the Kent County School System in Grand Rapids where I was a speech therapist and audiologist. My son-in-law, Steve Garvey, is a graduate on MSU class of 1971 from the School of Education. Now we look forward to seeing our youngest grandchild becoming a Spartan in 2017. My purpose in endowing the College of Education is to provide funds for a student striving to earn a teacher’s degree. I would like the selected student to be able to enjoy the campus environment, grow intellectually and build a Spartan mindset of perseverance.”\n\nGive Now to the Larry and Maxine Beckman Endowed Scholarship in Education\n\nThe Denzil M. and Mary Jean Bell Endowed Scholarship in Education\n\nAbout Denzil and Mary Jean Bell\n\n“Playing teacher” was a favorite childhood activity for Mary Jean. As a high school student she taught vocal music at several country schools. During her Albion College day she taught special needs students and enrichment classes after school and during the summers. Handbells, All-City Choir, Junior Choir at church, and serving as church organist were highlights of her pre-teaching experiences. Certification as a K-12 Vocal Music Teacher offered many fulfilling opportunities in Battle Creek, Charlotte, Niles, and Summerfield Schools. Denzil earned his Bachelor of Science Degree from MSU in 1968 in Biology and Physical Science. He credits his high school counselor’s dedication with his receiving his college degree. After graduation from high school, Denzil was working without any real plans to attend college. Had it not been for a call from his counselor, who had submitted his records for consideration, he would not have been awarded the four year tuition and fees scholarship that made his college education possible. That dedication is what led him to pursue a career in education.\n\nDenzil started his career as a science and math teacher with the Battle Creek Public Schools’ Northwestern Junior High where Mary Jean taught Music. They always joked that they met “in Junior High” when they were both adults. Before starting their family, Denzil and Mary Jean both earned their Master of Arts Degree from MSU in 1972, Mary Jean in Education and Denzil in Higher Ed. Administration. Denzil took a position with Kellogg Community College where he established the college’s first Placement Office. He spent 6 years at KCC as Placement Director and Personnel Director before returning to K-12 Education as Assistant Principal with the Charlotte Public Schools in 1977. In 1986 he became an Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations with the Cassopolis Public Schools eventually assuming the superintendency before relocating as the Assistant Superintendent for Business with the Bedford Public Schools in 1988. Denzil retired after 32 years in education in June of 2000. After retirement he started his own consultant business assisting schools with building programs. During this second career he also represented the architectural firm of Hobbs + Black in the capacity of business development. Mary Jean retired in June of 2004 having completed 24 years of teaching music ranging in ages pre-K through 12th grade. The Bells spent their retirement traveling , serving in many volunteer organizations and in their local church congregation and reveling in the role of grandparents. Both the Bells’ children attended MSU. Son, Matthew earned his BS in Chemical Engineering. Daughter, Catherine spent three semesters at MSU before completing her nursing studies at Mercy College of Toledo. Both Matthew and Catherine were members of the Spartan Marching Band while on Campus and the family continued to enjoy MSU Football and Basketball. Denzil and Mary Jean were always grateful for the education they received at MSU and for the career opportunities that education provided them. Their bequest to the university honors their careers and seeks to provide for future generations of teachers to enjoy the same meaningful career while contributing to the education of the generations after them.\n\nGive Now to The Denzil M. and Mary Jean Bell Endowed Scholarship in Education\n\nGlenn D.

They cherish their time there. Beverley’s experience was in the 1960’s when she earned a Master’s Degree in Kinesiology. She is an avid fan of MSU basketball. Max’s association with MSU started in 1938 when his father joined the faculty in the Department of Agricultural Chemistry. He was two years old at the time so some of his earliest memories include MSC scenes. For example, he remembers when the Farm Lane Bridge over the Red Cedar River was a noisy steel structure that connected the campus with the college’s farm just on the south side.\n\nMax grew up on a farm in Ingham County and graduated from Okemos High School. He went on to earn two degrees in agriculture and one in education at MSU. He taught briefly in a secondary school in Indiana and a community college in Michigan. He then taught at Western Michigan University for more than thirty years before retiring.\n\nBeverley grew up in Tuscola County and graduated from Unionville High School and then from Central Michigan University. Her teaching experience includes time at Marshall Public Schools, Kalamazoo College and White Pigeon Public Schools. She was instrumental in getting girls basketball started in St Joseph County prior to Title 9 and to a much larger scale after that law was implemented. She coached basketball and track at White Pigeon for a number of years. Her work gained her induction in the White Pigeon Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nOne of her main interests after retiring is art. She has attended many painting workshops and classes which has enabled her to produce art that has been juried into the Sturgis Open Door Art Gallery.\n\nMax and his brother bought a farm near Sturgis in 1960 and he and Beverley purchased an adjoining farm in 1968. This farm became their residence and they have lived there ever since. Max, his brother and a partner have operated Benne Farm, Inc. since 1960.\n\nThey both received aid when they were pursuing their college careers and are now at the point where they can and want to help some new students in need of assistance.\n\nGive to Max and Beverly Fund\n\nAnn Marie Bolger Memorial Scholarship in Student Affairs\n\nAbout Ann Bolger\n\nAnn Bolger served as Director of Residence Life at Michigan State University for a short time, but left a lasting impact on the organization, students, and the University. Her commitment to and trust in students and staff enabled a vast transformation in Residence Life. As a result of her leadership, Residence Life’s “core” reflects commitment to student learning, leadership development, ethical decision-making and multiculturalism.\n\nHer impact extended beyond Michigan State University into the profession of student affairs where she was a leader in the Association for College and University Housing Officers and the American College Personnel Association. Numerous faculty, professionals, and leaders throughout the country considered Ann a friend, gentle critic and mentor. In addition, her dynamic leadership changed the campuses she worked at throughout her career, including the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, the University of California at Davis, Chapman University and Macalester College.\n\nAnn will be remembered locally and nationally as a loving mother, visionary leader, educator, student advocate, and change agent. The spirit of the scholarship and the selection criteria resonate with Ann’s unending belief that students matter, that students have much to teach others, and that creativity in student affairs requires strength of character.\n\nGive Now to the Ann Marie Bolger Memorial Scholarship\n\nFor information on how to apply for this scholarship please visit Graduate Student Endowed Scholarships/Fellowships\n\nDr. Cassandra L.

Brehm\n\nThis endowment is a gift from Dr. Shirley Brehm in loving memory of her mother, Margaret Schmidt Brehm. Margaret was born in 1903 in Cadillac, Michigan, one of three children of William and Louise Schmidt. While Margaret did not have the opportunity to pursue a college education as a young woman, she held the highest regard for higher education and at the age of 68 received an undergraduate degree from Central Michigan University. Margaret and her husband, Frank, were married in 1923 and lived in Flint until finally settling in Osceola County in Michigan. Frank worked as a farmer and Margaret taught school. They raised three children – Shirley, Durwood and Roger. Margaret encouraged her children’s interest in education beyond high school. Dr. Brehm credits her academic and professional career in higher education to her mother, who supported her academically, emotionally, and spiritually.\n\nDr. Shirley Brehm received three degrees from Michigan State University – bachelors in elementary education in 1948; a master in teacher education in 1955; and a Ph.D. in curriculum in 1964. Shirley was able to attend MSU as the result of a 4H scholarship and because she worked a variety of jobs to get through school. Later she worked as a teacher, consultant with the Conservation Department, and as a professional Girl Scout. After receiving her master’s degree, Dr. Brehm was hired by the College of Education as an instructor in science education and, for about three years, served as the sole female member of the college faculty advisory council.\n\nDr. Brehm served as a professor in the Teacher Education Department from 1955 to 1988 and primarily taught science education to elementary education students. Her career at MSU allowed her the opportunity to travel extensively and she spent considerable time overseas during her tenure as an MSU professor. Her travel included trips to Nicaragua, Okinawa and other locations in Japan and England.\n\nThe scholarship recognizes the impact Dr. Brehm had on the MSU College of Education and in turn, the force behind her success – her mother – Margaret Schmidt Brehm.\n\nGive now to the Dr. Shirley H. Brehm Endowed Scholarship in Teacher Education\n\nJere E. and Arlene Pintozzi Brophy Endowed Fellowship in Education\n\nAbout Jere and Arlene Brophy\n\nJere and Arlene Brophy learned the value of endowments from their own lives. Jere won the St. Mel High School scholarship from Loyola University, Chicago in 1958, and received his bachelor’s degree in psychology from the Honors Program of Loyola in 1962. He was then awarded a fellowship from the University of Chicago where he received his PhD in Human Development and Clinical Psychology. Jere and Arlene were able to get married while he was in graduate school, in part because of his fellowship.\n\nArlene Pintozzi Brophy received her bachelors degree in education with high honors from the University of Texas. After working in MSU’s College of Education with student teachers, she realized that her main interest was in children experiencing difficulties at school. She completed a masters degree in social work at MSU, and became a school social worker for many years.\n\nIn 1956, Jere and Arlene met at Marillac Social Center in Chicago where they both started working while in high school. Marillac was a settlement house operated by the Daughters of Charity, Catholic sisters who were social workers. Marillac was located in a changing neighborhood of the city, and Jere and Arlene worked there during the civil rights movement. Marillac greatly influenced Jere and Arlene to appreciate the importance of social justice. This experience gave them inspiration and motivation to strive to be the best they could be, and to help those less fortunate through the helping professions, Jere as a psychologist and Arlene as a social worker. Jere and Arlene went their separate ways when they were in college, but after a short time, they were both eager to get back together, and were married in 1963. On the day of their wedding, the entire wedding party went back to Marillac House to celebrate their marriage with the sisters and staff.\n\nAfter Jere completed his PhD Program, he devoted his life’s work to furthering knowledge in education and psychology. Jere did post doctorate work at the University of Chicago, and then spent spent eight years at the University of Texas. He came to Michigan State University in 1976 as Professor and Senior Researcher in the Institute of Research on Teaching (IRT). He served as Co-Director of the IRT from 1981 to 1994, and, in that capacity, convened scholars to share their works-in-progress through the “Invisible College” prior to the annual meetings of the American Educational Research Association. At MSU, Jere held the position of University Distinguished Professor, which is the highest faculty distinction in the university.\n\nJere’s honors and awards are among the most prized in the fields of education and psychology. He received the 2007 E. L. Thorndike Award from Division 15 of the American Psychological Association. This award, signifying a career of distinguished contributions to knowledge, theory and practice in educational psychology was very special to Jere because it was recognition from his peers. Jere was elected as Fellow in the American Psychological Association, the International Academy of Education, the American Psychological Society, and the American Educational Research Association. He was also a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Palo Alto, California during 1994-95 when he was on a sabbatical. He was elected to the National Academy of Education and was recognized with an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Liege, Belgium in 2004. He served on the editorial boards for many of the most prestigious journals in the field of education.\n\nJere was a prolific author who wrote over 300 articles, chapters and books. Jere’s work was as well known to practitioners as scholars. His research on effective teaching, classroom management, and student motivation influenced both theory and practice with lucid and incisive thought and writing. Later he applied these ideas to the construction of social studies curriculum and received the Award for Exemplary Research in Social Studies from the National Council on Social Studies. MSU dean Carole Ames said that it’s hard to imagine an undergraduate or graduate student in education or psychology who has not encountered Jere’s work.\n\nJere was known by colleagues as a generous mentor who warmly welcomed inquires, paid careful attention to their writings and ideas, and offered helpful commentary and encouragement. They cherished his friendship, his genuine interest in other people, his laid back manner and his sense of humor; he was always ready for a good chuckle. As an adviser to graduate students, Jere created a safe place where they could stretch their thinking, take intellectual risks and grow as professionals. The College of Education at MSU aspired to be the best education school in the country, and Jere embodied this special vision and spirit. When asked to serve on the Michigan Department of Education Social Studies Task Force, Jere graciously agreed and contributed long hours and substantial thought to development of the state’s first social studies assessments. He brought honesty, integrity, genuineness, brilliance, gentle encouragement and authenticity to the field of education. Jere devoted himself to bringing light to the problems of education. He was a great scholar, and he had a sense of what was practical in the classroom. He was known for his eagerness to share his knowledge with teachers, students and colleagues always with a sense of respect and humility. He had a special gift for making that knowledge useful to each audience with whom he spoke.\n\nArlene’s career paralleled Jere’s in their shared commitment to the achievement and well-being of elementary and secondary school students. As a school social worker, Arlene worked with elementary and high school students who had learning, emotional and social difficulties. She facilitated elementary and high school groups on grief, divorce, addictions and peer relationships. She taught parenting skills and assisted parents to facilitate their children’s school success. She worked with teachers, school administrators and community resources to provide support for students and families. Arlene enjoyed working in the school environment, and felt that through her work as a social worker, she had achieved her life long goal of helping others.\n\nAfter Arlene retired, she contributed to the MSU community as a member of the Board of the MSU Community Club (MSUCC), serving as President in 2005-06. She chaired the Volunteers for MSU, a group that is part of the MSUCC that volunteers facilitating MSU student groups in the Service Learning Program. She also served on the Board of the Community Volunteers for International Programs (CVIP), which is also affiliated with MSU.\n\nJere was a avid reader who read several books every week. He enjoyed music, and spent many evenings reading and listening to music. He followed the games of several sport teams especially the Chicago White Sox. During the MSU hockey season, Jere spent many Friday evenings at Munn arena with family members watching the Spartans play hockey. Arlene spent her free time reading, cooking, and playing bridge. The most precious time for Jere and Arlene were family gatherings with their children and grandchildren, and time spent together in northern Michigan hiking in the woods and watching sunsets over Lake Michigan. Jere and Arlene’s relationship that started at Marillac House when they were young became more endearing over the forty-six years they were married. Having those years together, a close knit family and work that they felt passionate about gave both a desire to give back. Their hope is that this fellowship might enable a graduate student at MSU to find within Jere and Arlene’s story a path for dedication to high achievement, a desire to create and further knowledge in education and to value integrity and generosity to others.\n\nGive now to the Jere E. and Arlene Pintozzi Brophy Endowed Fellowship in Education\n\nFor information on how to apply for this scholarship please visit Graduate Student Endowed Scholarships/Fellowships\n\nFrederic Julian Brown Endowed Lecture in Rehabilitation Counseling\n\nAbout the Frederic Julian Brown Endowed Lecture in Rehabilitation Counseling\n\nThis lecture will honor Frederic Brown and provide an annual opportunity for the rehabilitation community in Michigan, along with the faculty and students from the Rehabilitation Counselor Education Program at Michigan State University, to gain additional knowledge and perspectives on issues of strong current interest to the field of rehabilitation and rehabilitation counselor education and training.

Ms. Buckwick died February 12, 1995 and left a bequest initially funding the Angeline Buckwick Endowed Scholarship.\n\nAccording to her family, Angeline Buckwick was a teacher right from the start. She taught her three younger siblings both classroom and life lessons. She was the first in her family to attend college, and she worked hard to pay her way. After graduating in 1953, Ms. Buckwick accepted a position with the Lansing Public Schools, where she stayed for her entire career.\n\nHer students and co-workers loved Angie. Her principal remarked, “She was an outstanding first grade reading teacher and was a pleasure to have on the staff as she was always cooperative and helpful.”\n\nAngie was active outside the classroom as well, and used these activities as opportunities to broaden her students’ view of the world. One of her favoritethings to do was to take her children on field trips to the 4-H Children’s Garden at MSU. She would also take a couple of children with her each time she attended an MSU Travelogue program.\n\nA former student of Angie’s shares her memories: “Ms. Angie Buckwick was everything a teacher should be. She was at once gentle and firm. She taught with passion and compassion. My mind still holds snippets of lessons and stories, poems and songs, activities and philosophy put there by Ms. Buckwick. Her impact on my life is beyond measure. At a time when people are quick to criticize teachers and schools, we would do well to remember the example of Miss Buckwick.”\n\nWhen Angie died suddenly in 1995, her will stipulated that money was to go to MSU to support scholarships for future teachers. Thus, the Angeline Buckwick Endowed Scholarship in Elementary Education was created. To date, five students have benefited from the scholarship.\n\nA bench in the 4-H Garden bears a quote that exemplifies Angie’s philosophy of teaching and captures her legacy. “You must do something to make the world more beautiful.” Angeline Buckwick did that every day she taught.\n\nGive Now to the Angeline Buckwick Endowed Scholarship\n\nGlenn and Thelma Buell College of Education Endowed Scholarship\n\nAbout Glenn and Thelma Buell\n\nGlenn and Thelma Buell were married in 1920.

As a female, Betty Lou was not considered a “candidate” for college, so took no science or math courses in high school. With encouragement from the town fathers, successful businessmen who recognized Betty Lou’s work ethic, she successfully applied to MSU. Working for a year after high school as a telephone operator, Betty Lou was able to earn enough for a two year retailing course.\n\nStruggling with college courses due to her limited education, Betty Lou engaged her roommate as a tutor. In spring of her freshman year, she began working 30-40 hours a week, work that continued the rest of her college career. As a sophomore, Betty Lou was recognized with a financial award for the one who worked the hardest for an education. This enabled her to enroll in the College of Education.\n\nBetty Lou maintained a 3.5 GPA, earned her degree debt free, and enjoyed a wonderful college life. The work ethic, dedication and balance she learned through her experience at MSU have contributed to her rich and happy life. She would thus like to enable a student from similar rural roots, with the same strong will and devotion, to attend the College of Education.\n\nGive Now to the Charles H. and Betty Lou Awrey Carscallen Endowed Scholarship in Teacher Education\n\nSonja L.

He believes these teachers and coaches are critical to the success of the public school system, which so directly determines the well-being of our society. Dr. Clark came to Michigan State University as a freshman from Kansas in 1963. He was awarded three degrees from Michigan State University — his B.A. in Elementary Education in 1967, his M.A. in 1968, and his Ph.D. from the Department of Educational Administration in 1977.\n\nGive Now to Michael A.

In his travels, Bob met hundreds of prospective students and alumni and was universally loved, respected, and admired for his professionalism, enthusiasm, and friendliness. In his doctoral studies, Bob was the recipient of scholarships to support his work and this scholarship, established in Bob’s name, is our way of honoring Bob’s life and paying forward the kindness and generosity of those that came before him.\n\nThe Coneybeare Family Endowed Scholarship Fund\n\nAbout the Coneybeare Family\n\nMarge’s parents, Ross and Jean Coneybeare, were immigrants from Canada and Scotland, respectively, who never graduated from high school. Nonetheless, they truly understood the value of education and steadfastly encouraged Marge and her sisters to go to college. Marge became a freshman at Michigan State University in 1956 and became the only member of her family to graduate from college. She has established the Coneybeare Family Endowed Scholarship Fund in honor of her parents and with love for her sisters, Lorna, Rachel, and Jean. After leaving MSU, Marge received a Bachelors of Education degree from the Chicago Teachers College, a Masters in Education from Western Michigan and, later, a PhD in Education from University of South Carolina. For many years, she taught gifted and talented students in Bedford County (VA) public schools. Marge was named 1992-1993 “Teacher of the Year” at Thaxton Elementary School, where she also served as vice principal. Previously, Marge taught in Chicago, IL and Augusta, GA. She enjoyed being an educator. While a student at Michigan State University, Marge worked at the Christian Science Reading Room, in a residence hall kitchen and at one other job. Plus, she received scholarships that helped pay for room, books and tuition. She was active in the “Org,” an organization for Christian Science students on campus. She credits Michigan State University for giving her self-confidence and a successful career as a teacher. She had a lot of fun there too. For these reasons, Marge is pleased to give aspiring young teachers an opportunity to attend the University by establishing The Coneybeare Family Endowed Scholarship Fund.\n\nGive Now to The Coneybeare Family Endowed Scholarship Fund\n\nThe William F. and Harriette C. Cook Endowed Undergraduate Scholarship for the Study of Literacy\n\nAbout William and Harriette Cook\n\nLiteracy is very important to William F. Cook, who received a Bachelors degree in 1957 from the College of Business in Economics, and Harriette C. Cook, who received a Bachelors degree in 1957 from the College of Communication Arts and Sciences in Speech and Threatre. They come from families in which both mothers were educators, Mr. Cook’s mother going from teacher to middle school principal, and later serving as a school board member. Personally, William Cook’s interest in literacy is heightened by the fact that he has faced a life-long reading problem caused by dyslexia, has served on the board of directors of the Montcalm County Adult Reading Council, and has worked as a tutor with students. As a result, Mrs. Cook has an appreciation for those who deal with literacy. Both Harriette and William Cook are 1957 graduates of Michigan State University and have been interested in and supportive of the University since their graduation. They are hopeful the scholarship funds they provide will facilitate a remedy for the pervasiveness of illiteracy through their support of the education of well-qualified literacy professionals.\n\nGive Now to The William F. and Harriette C.

Crane Scholarship\n\nJeanie Saldeen Crosby and Margaret Douglas Saldeen Endowed Scholarship in Elementary Education\n\nAbout Margaret Douglas Saldeen and Jeanie Saldeen Crosby\n\nI decided to create a scholarship to honor my mother, Margaret Douglas Saldeen, who was my first teacher and also the reason that I became a teacher. My mother began her teaching career in the rural school district of Gratiot County, Michigan in the 1940’s. She graduated from Central Michigan University with a teaching certificate after 2 years of schooling (my how things have changed). She lived at home on the farm with her parents and began teaching in a one room school house where she taught all grades K-8. She loved her work and put in many long hours to see that all the children learned and that they also enjoyed it. She taught all grade levels and all subjects including music and art. She would arrive early in the morning to put the wood or coal in the stove to start the fire to heat the room, which was especially important during the winter!! At the end of the day she had to do everything to close it down, including any cleaning. However I’m pretty sure she had the children help with the cleaning duties. When I asked her how she was able to teach all the subjects to all the children she explained that the older children always helped teach the younger ones, under her guidance of course. She knew each child’s family very well and that helped her in many ways, including discipline. She was responsible for all social events at the school as well. One year she had her younger brother dress up as Santa Claus. He came to school very early with her and hid by the stove for several hours as he waited for the Christmas Party. He told her later that he about cooked in his Santa costume, and in the future he would just come in time for the party.\n\nIn June of 1945 she married my father just before he went into the Army Air Corps for WWII. Since he was going away into the service soon after they married, she continued to live at home and teach, as he was stationed all over the country. However my father found out that it was possible for her to join him on these bases, so he sent her a letter that has become famous in our family. Basically he asked her which was more important to her, the teaching contract or the marriage contract. Because it was wartime and no one was ever sure they would come home alive, my mother finished that fall semester and then joined him wherever he was stationed in the United States. There was always the possibility that he would be sent overseas and then she would have come home and continued teaching. As it turned out my Father was never sent overseas and so she was able to be with him most of the time until the war was over.\n\nAfter the war my dad finished his Agricultural Engineering degree at Michigan State and took a job in Battle Creek, Michigan. Three years later I was born. My mother became a full time mom and housewife. We moved to Beverly Hills, MI when I was in first grade. By the time I was in fourth grade my mom was a substitute teacher for the Birmingham Public Schools. She never was a full time teacher again as she was too involved in bringing me up and many other family activities. She was my Brownie leader, and was always helpful with homework and encouraging me to practice my music. However, she continued to teach her whole life. She was active in many church activities both with youth and women’s circles. She tutored her niece’s children in Florida when all 3 boys were having trouble in school. After my parents moved to Henry Ford Village in Dearborn, she taught square dancing and ran the dances there for many years. She taught me many card games as I was growing up and many family members learned them from her as well. She was a lifelong learner and a lifelong teacher and a great role model for me in so many ways. My mother was an active and vibrant person who loved life and her family.\n\nShe would be so proud to know that there is a Scholarship in her honor. When she was in college money was very scarce in her family as she was one of 8 children. She came home to Ithaca on the weekends so she could work at the local Kroger store to help earn money for her tuition. Various family members helped her with whatever they could so that she could earn her teaching certificate. I know that she considered teaching as a way to help children become all that they could be. This scholarship will hopefully help someone else achieve their dream of becoming a teacher so that they can help the children of the future.\n\nAs I grew up hearing many stories from my mother about her experiences when she was a teacher they inspired in me the desire to be a teacher as well. Also our family came to many homecoming and other events at MSU as my dad, my uncle, and several cousins were MSU Alumni. So by the time I was in my senior year of high school I knew I wanted to be a teacher and I wanted to go to MSU. My mother felt that I should at least look at another college so we went to visit Central Michigan for a day. At the end of that day I had satisfied her wish that I look at another school and I said now I know I want to go to MSU!! So I enrolled as an Elementary Education major and began my freshman year. Sometime during that year I thought that it was not a good idea to become a teacher just because of the influence of my mother so I dropped out of Education and became No Preference. I took some time to decide what I wanted to do with my life. It didn’t take me long to realize that I wanted to be a teacher, not just because my mother was one, but because I was genuinely interested myself. So I came back to Education, a decision I have never regretted. In my senior year at MSU I was accepted into a program that allowed me to teach on an American Air Force Base in England. That was the opportunity of a lifetime and began my interest in global education.\n\nAfter I graduated I immediately began work on my Masters and also got a temporary teaching job for the last 10 weeks of the school year in Okemos, MI. Although I had done very well in my student teaching experience, I was not prepared to take over a 4th grade classroom where discipline had gone out the window. It was then I learned the importance of a supportive principal and school counselor, and some very valuable lessons on classroom management. At the end of that school year I married and move to the Flint, MI area where I taught K for 3 ½ years. Finally we were able to move back to the East Lansing area, and I was hired to teach 4th grade in the East Lansing Public Schools where I taught for 26 happy years. I taught at Central Elementary School, which is now the MSU early childhood center, MacDonald Middle School for one year, and finally Pinecrest Elementary School. I retired from East Lansing Public Schools in 2001 with 30 years of teaching. My husband and I moved to Illinois where I taught one year in a public school and then finished my teaching career with 9 years at Roosevelt University teaching in their College of Education. I retired in 2011 from Roosevelt and have been happily enjoying my retirement. I am very proud to serve on the MSU College of Education Alumni Board.\n\nAs I think back on my teaching career I realize that I have been very fortunate to have a career that was both rewarding and enjoyable. I know that I have helped many students in my years of teaching, both at an elementary and at the University level. I feel that I have changed many lives for the better. Teaching is a career that is both a great responsibility and a great privilege. As I enter this new phase of my life I find that I want to help others to become teachers. My parents were not wealthy, nor are my husband and I. Yet through hard work and savings we are now in a position to help others. As I considered the criteria for this scholarship I pondered the areas that are important to me. Rural Education is important because of my mother and my father who was an agricultural engineer. Global education is important to me because of my own experiences. I am married to a man who is African American and so helping minorities achieve their goals is important to me. I love teaching math and so the STEM areas of teaching are important to me. In short I began to realize that I had a lot of areas in teaching that were important to me. Yet mostly I just wanted to help anyone who had the passion to become a great teacher, no matter what area of expertise they were interested in, and who could benefit from my help.\n\nSo, to each scholarship winner, I hope this has let you know a little bit about Margaret and Jeanie. My hope for you is that you find your teaching career as meaningful and enjoyable as did my mother and I. My mother and father are both gone now, my mother passed away in 2007 and my father in 2012. But speaking for them and for my husband and myself, congratulations on being selected for this scholarship. I look forward to meeting you and getting to know you both now and in the future. I hope that you will touch the lives of the children you teach in a positive way, and I hope that your life is enriched by all the experiences you will have in your career.\n\nMy best to you,\n\nJeanie Saldeen Crosby\n\nGive Now to Jeanie Saldeen Crosby and Margaret Douglas Saldeen Endowed Scholarship in Elementary Education\n\nThe following is an excerpt that my mother, Margaret Douglas Saldeen, wrote about her early experiences in teaching in a country school. I have included this excerpt so that you might understand how much my mother loved her profession of teaching.\n\nA Country School Teacher by Margaret Saldeen\n\nJeanie Saldeen Crosby and her mom, Margaret Douglas Saldeen\n\nIn June 1938 I had completed a 2 year course at Central State Teachers College (now CMU), and had my Certificate to start teaching in a one room country school. I had no car so my father offered to drive me to see what was available.\n\nMy first encounter was at a big old fashioned farm-house, the home of a rural school director. The teacher was supposed to live with them and walk the one and a half miles to school. The house was dreary…heavy dark wood, narrow windows, etc. My heart sank!! (Our house was always bright and cheery).\n\nMy father saw my dismay and on the way to the next director, he made me an offer. He would sell me his car at payments of $50.00 a month, and I could stay at home with free room and board. I loved my home and this was the best offer I could ever have.\n\nThe next director, at the Wheeler School, was very direct. They’d had no discipline and many problems at school. So, “Could I spank them?” My father quickly said, as if the question was ridiculous, “Of course she can.” (He said this as he knew I felt there were better ways than spanking to discipline). His answer was, “OK, you can have the job, but you must get through every page of those textbooks- no half or three quarters as they had done before”. I was to get $80.00 a month to do the janitor work. I had close to 30 wonderful students, including several gentle hardworking Mexican migrant children for a couple of months. There were no discipline problems and they finished their textbooks with my 8th graders testing higher than the town students.\n\nIt took a lot of planning to cover all 9 grades. They learned not only their subjects, but how to treat others, good manners etc. When one class was in session the others would be reading, writing or studying quietly at their seats until their class was called. One year I had a little handicapped boy in a wheelchair. His older sister took care of his physical needs. He showed so much joy at learning the action words etc. The other children learned to appreciate their own abilities and were kind and helpful. It was much like the Mainstream program we have today, a win-win situation.\n\nA rural school teacher had to plan monthly PTA meetings. The students put on plays, recited poetry etc. had a Box Social or an outside speaker. One Christmas I hired my brother to be Santa Claus. He had to come out of a make believe fireplace on the cue “Down thru the Chimney with good St. Nick” He had to hide behind that fireplace in my red snowsuit for 2 hours. He came out on cue but I’m sure he was the reddest-faced, hottest Santa anyone had ever seen.\n\nFor two years we had a Mrs. Miles from MSU who helped us with our Music and Art. Once a year we had a County Music Program at the Ithaca Gymnasium. I was chosen to lead it. There were 500 4th thru 8th graders in front of me and their parents behind me. I thought they did well. The next summer I attended Summer School and took a Music course as I was working towards my Degree. I asked the Prof. for some help on conducting. She found I was not only leading with my hand but was keeping time with my feet and considerable fanny motion. She laughed and taught me to lead without entertaining all those fathers!!!!!! In music we made a Rhythm Band which was a great pride to them. Their Art work kept the windows and walls decorated.\n\nA rural teacher also had to lead or find leaders for both Boys and Girls 4H Clubs. Our Clubs won prizes at the County Fair. Our 7th and 8th graders entered an Essay Contest and won a set of Britannica encyclopedias for the school.\n\nMost of our students had never been out of our County so with a couple of other teachers we organized a 3 bus trip to GreenField Village in Dearborn, MI. It was a great thrill for them. Later we did a Sugar Mill trip, a Hay ride at a nearby farm and a Bobsled ride.\n\nA couple times a year on lovely warm days we’d take our pads and pencils outside, look up at the sky and put our dreams on paper. I wish there were more space so I could share some of our fun experiences with you. These were great kids.\n\nCriteria for Jeanie Saldeen Crosby and Margaret Douglas Saldeen Endowed Scholarship in Elementary Education\n\nRecipients shall be undergraduate or post B.A. internship (fifth) year students enrolled in the College of Education pursuing elementary teacher certification.

She courageously devoted the majority of her life to understanding, advocating, and legislating for individuals with learning disabilities. She was the very first honored and awarded recipient of the National LDA’s Voulnteer of the year award. She worked endlessly to secure the LDA of Michigan as a productive and vibrant organization. Flo was quite content working behind the sences making sure everyone and everything was cared for. One of the key activities each year was a conference held at the Kellogg Center on the campus of Michigan State University. The MSU fifth year Special Education interns were vital to the success of that conference. The students volunteered to cover all aspects of the day, from welcoming participants to facilitating sessions. Flo valued the young teachers and their talents offered to students in special education programs across the state of Michigan. She valued education, as a former Special Education Teacher herself, and always supported continued education. in this sense, her endowment will continue to help generations of educators working in the field. Although humble and demure, Flo is no less than one of our greatest contributors to the Learning Disabilities Association of America. She was a Hero, and will be eternally missed.\n\nGive Now to LDA of Michigan Flo Curtis Special Education Endowment\n\nMarian A. Dammon Scholarship\n\nAbout Marian A. Dammon\n\nMarian A.

Dressel Expendable Scholarship in the College of Education\n\nThe longer tribute will give a true but dry image of a hardworking, dedicated man. To give a more personal sense of who he was, I, his daughter, will try to add a bit more. He had a massive intellect but was generally quiet until he had something worthwhile to say. Except when it was inappropriate, he constantly peppered his conversation with perfectly timed puns and humor. He read voraciously, and it seemed to be at the speed of light, while still retaining all that he read. As a father, he was generous and gentle, but ifhe said a quiet and firm “no”-discussion was ended and the limit set. He was the most patient of teachers, but he couldn’t cook or bake. He was good at fixing electrical/mechanical things or at least taking them apart and seeing how they ran -to him they were another puzzle to solve. He was just not good at the baking of my poor sister’s birthday cake when my mother was gone. But he tried … a great Dad.\n\nAnother perspective from a friend and colleague is from a letter of reference written about Dr. Dressel in his early years as a boss: “When he considered a proposal ‘half-baked’ or ‘ill considered’, as some of them were, he said so, but usually in private rather than in an open meeting.” The colleague went on to describe his “cool judgment and … dependability” but then ends his letter of recommendation with the statement “Most of his puns are absolutely inexcusable.” For those that knew Paul Dressel, you’d see the twinkle in his eye as he looked for the person that caught the obscure pun he threw in during a conversation. THAT was Paul Dressel and probably why he saved that letter of recommendation from 1948.”\n\nDr. Paul L. Dressel (1910-1989) served at Michigan State College and Michigan State University, where he distinguished himself with the final title of Professor of University Research. In 1940, after spending six years as a faculty member in the Department of Mathematics, Dr. Dressel became the Director of the Orientation Office. From this administrative base, he was responsible for establishing and directing the Board of Examiners (later the Office ofEvaluation Services) and the first university Counseling Center in response to the needs of the many GI’s returning from war and needing services as they utilized the GI bill. In 1959, again responding to the needs of an emerging university, he organized and directed the Office of Institutional Research at Michigan State.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Dressel was a strong supporter of the residential college concept and was instrumental in the development of the three residential colleges at this institution. Also, Dr. Dressel helped to establish the Educational Development Program in 1963 and was involved in drawing up the proposal that secured the funds from the Ford Foundation to support this program. Throughout the years, Dr. Dressel had served on many committees that were outside the scope of his assigned administrative responsibilities. These included a broad spectrum from The Committee on the Future (1959), the first Committee on the Education of Women (1961) to Committee on Higher Education (1973-74).\n\nMSU as well as other universities utilized his reputation as an authority in higher education across the country and beyond. In his role as scholar and a leading authority in higher education, he gave unselfishly of his time in the training and developing of emerging professionals.\n\nHe authored many books and publications, including College To University: The Hannah Years at Michigan State, 1935-1969, Handbook of Academic Evaluation, and Administrative Leadership, a staple in postsecondary administrative practice. Dr. Dressel also co-authored or edited several books in the areas of evaluation, curriculum development and college teaching, institutional research, and higher education administration. In 1970, he was president of the American Association of Higher Education, which was a primary voice for higher education faculty and administrators for over 30 years. His administrative writings and innovative practice influenced higher education graduate programs in Michigan and nationally.\n\nGive Now to the Dressel Education Graduate Fund\n\nThe Marvin O. and Peggy Savage Dunn Endowed Scholarship in Early Elementary Education\n\nAbout Marv and Peggy Savage Dunn\n\nMarv & Peggy both earned teaching certificates from MSU in the 1970s. Marv majored in Interdisciplinary Social Studies and was certified to teach grades 6-12. Later he earned an M.S. in Family Studies from MSU’s College 0f Human Ecology. He used his degrees to teach high school for 30 years in Owosso, MI, mostly teaching U. S History and Psychology. Peggy had a double major in Child Development and Teaching through the Colleges of Human Ecology and Education, and was certified to teach preschool-6th grade, with a ZA Endorsement as a Preschool-3rd grade Specialist. She later earned an M.S. in Child Development from the College of Human Ecology. She taught preschool through second grades for 31 years in Pinckney, MI and Okemos, MI. Throughout their careers both maintained a strong commitment to Public Education and a belief that intervention is most helpful in the early years of a child’s education. They also grew to realize that the best teachers were not necessarily those who had the highest grade point average. Instead, oftentimes it appeared that the teacher who had struggled a bit in school was better able to identify with and help students who were also having difficulties with learning. This scholarship is intended to help that teacher candidate who has not received financial help based on high academic achievement, but who demonstrates creativity, empathy and enthusiasm for teaching as identified by his or her peers, professors, and/or supervising teachers during their junior and senior years.\n\nGive Now to The Marvin O. and Peggy Savage Dunn Endowed Scholarship in Early Elementary Education\n\nThe Thelma Dunn Hansen Scholarship Endowed by Marvin O. Dunn and Peggy Savage Dunn\n\nAbout Thelma Dunn Hansen\n\nThis scholarship is named in honor of Marv’s mother, Thelma Dunn Hansen, a lifetime educator and faculty member of the MSU College of Human Ecology (now the Human Development and Family Studies Department, College of Social Science). Thelma was widowed in 1950, when she was 29 years old with a baby and a preschooler. She returned to MSU to earn her Masters degree and began her MSU teaching career at that time. This scholarship is meant to help a student who finds him or herself in a similar situation of earning a degree while parenting and supporting a family.\n\nGive Now to The Thelma Dunn Hansen Scholarship Endowed by Marvin O.

The Dykstra family draws upon MSU from the past, present, and future. In 1968, Dr. James W. Perry, Colleen’s father, began the lineage of MSU graduates when he received his doctorate degree in education. Timothy and Colleen earned bachelor’s degrees in finance and education, respectively, from MSU in 1976. Their son, Matthew, will be graduating in Spring of 2005, with a degree in human resources. Leah, their daughter, is currently working toward her degree in special education at Michigan State and plans to attain her bachelor’s in 2007. Daughter, Melissa, a high school senior, has recently been accepted as a future Spartan for Fall of 2005 and says, only half jokingly, that she dreams in green and white.\n\nMichigan State University has given much to our family and we would like to give back by establishing this scholarship fund to advance the research on mild impairments. Preference will be given to applicants whose research facilitates greater understanding or awareness among K-12 educators of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominately Inattentive Type, commonly referred to as ADHD-I. At this time, it is a relatively little known neurological ailment which often goes undiagnosed and therefore, untreated. If this “quiet” and “camouflaged” disorder is recognized early on, then treatment for it can head off a multitude of problems in the future.\n\nThe Dykstra Family Research Endowment in Education has been established to, ultimately, provide teachers with the knowledge to help identify those children who may suffer from ADHD-Inattentive Type. The Dykstras believe that the classroom teacher can play a key role in making this happen and help children who suffer from this disorder grow into balanced and successful adults.\n\nGive Now to Dykstra Family Research Endowment in Education\n\nFor information on how to apply for this scholarship please visit Graduate Student Endowed Scholarships/Fellowships\n\nJennie E.

Through their own journey with special education and their son, founders Fredi and Romina Bello identified a need for sensory rooms in schools. It was evident that this tool could provde a safe space to address students with autism who may be overstimulated in the classroom and allow them the opportunity to focus on sensory needs and return to their learning environment with the goal of being engaged in learning. To date, Fredi The Pizzaman Foundation has donated over $100,000, and equipped over 60 schools in Michigan with sensory-motor equipment. In addition, they have completed sensory rooms in two michigan stadiums. With the continued support of generous donors and the many families impacted by autism, the Foundation has a goal to equip sensory rooms in all Michigan Schools. In honor of the teachers and students the Foundation has worked with over the years, Fredi and Romina Bello have established the Fredi The Pizzaman Foundation for Autism Scholarship in Special Education. The goal of the scholarship is to encourage future teachers to promote inclusivity in the classroom for students with autism. Throughout the Bello’s education journey with their own child, they encountered teachers that were particularly focused on the integration of students with autism in general education classes. The scholarship is intented to encourage and empower students who have demonstrated a passion for the field of special education and motivate future special needs educators with an inclusive student-centered philosophy.\n\nChip & Jean Frentz Education Scholarship\n\nAbout The Chip & Jean Frentz Education Scholarship\n\nGive Now to the Chip & Jean Frentz Education Scholarship\n\nClark and Lani Ford Endowed Scholarship in Math and Science Education\n\nAbout and Lani Ford\n\nClark and Lani Ford spent their careers as professors at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.
