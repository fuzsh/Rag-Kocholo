Harry Frankland and Rose (nee West) Frankland\n\nYounger twin brother of John Ashlin Frankland.\n\nThe family moved to Penrith as Alfred’s father became the Vicar of Dacre in the Lake District. In WWI his father served in France as an Army Chaplain. On hi return in 1923 he became Vicar at Hesketh in Cumberland.\n\nBoth boys attended the preparatory Rossall School, Carlisle Grammar School and then St Bees School as a boarder.\n\nDr Alfred William Frankland, known as ‘Bill’ to many who knew him personally attended The Queen’s College, Oxford after winning a scholarship in 1930 , where he read medicine and upon leaving, went to do clinical work at St. Mary’s Hospital, London.\n\nBachelor of Medicine\n\nOccupation Doctor\n\n1939/11/08 - Enlisted\n\nRoyal Army Medical Corps\n\nService\n\n1939 to 1941 Bill was placed at Tidworth, Wiltshire and attached to the Royal Warwickshire Regiment.\n\n1941 - Married Pauline M Jackson at Amersham, Buckinghamshire\n\nLate 1941 - After a swift course in tropical medicine Bill was transported on a two month voyage to Singapore.\n\nPosted to 32 Company Tanglin Military Hospital, Singapore\n\n1942/02/15 - Singapore surrendered to the Japanese\n\n1942/04/10 - WO417/2, Casualty List No.794.

The brutality included beatings by the guards, one of which knocked Bill unconscious.\n\nKnowledge of the Allied progress was learned from a secret radio, so the prisoners knew the war had ended before the Japanese guards, but they still had to be very careful. Radio’s carried the death penalty in the camps.\n\nLiberated Blakang Mati, Singapore\n\nRepatriation\n\n1945/08/21 - Left Blakang Mati for Singapore.

By 1946 he had returned to St Mary’s Hospital.\n\n1945/09/27 - WO417/9, Casualty List No. 1869. Previously reported on Casualty List No. 1019 as Prisoner of War now Not Prisoner of War. Previous Theatre of War, Malaya.\n\nPost War\n\nby\n\nThe Anaphylaxis Campaign\n\nThroughout his life, Dr. Frankland worked to improve the lives of others and became a pioneer for allergy research. The Campaign is proud to have had Dr Frankland’s support since it was founded in 1994.\n\nHe had many achievements which benefited so many people globally, including bringing the pollen count to public attention and working as an assistant to Alexander Fleming, who famously discovered penicillin.\n\nIn 1946 Dr Frankland returned to the Allergy Department at St. Mary’s Hospital. It was there that he responded to an advertisement for a part-time role in the Department of Allergic Disorders with The Wright-Fleming Institute. There he worked in special clinics focusing on seasonal hayfever and Dr Frankland and his colleagues undertook a series of trials that proved that antihistamines neither helped nor increased pollen asthma (Frankland and Gorrill, 1955).\n\nIn 1962 he became Director of the Allergy Department at St Mary’s and undertook research into insect allergy and latex allergy, amongst other related conditions.\n\nFor over 50 years, Dr Frankland spearheaded research into allergic conditions and made significant contributions to a number of organisations, including the British Allergy Society and The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Even after turning 100, Dr Frankland continued to work and even commented on clinical papers for the Campaign.\n\nKnown as the Grandfather of allergy, Dr Frankland continued to publish and participate in scientific debate well past his 100th birthday, and was made an MBE for allergy research at the age of 103.\n\nDr Frankland died aged 108 on 2nd April 2020 .\n\nHe will be deeply missed by everyone at The Anaphylaxis Campaign and their thoughts are with his loved ones at this difficult time.\n\nLynne Regent, Chief Executive Officer of the Anaphylaxis Campaign, says:\n\n“All of us at the Anaphylaxis Campaign will miss Bill very much. He was a great supporter of our charity and took his role as Honorary President very seriously. He was always ready to help us in our work to provide accurate meaningful information to those with severe allergies . He also retained a lovely sense of humour and curiosity which was great to witness. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family.”\n\nRonnie Taylor:- I would also like to add my own personal thanks to Dr Frankland who has helped my condition. Having been hospitalised with Pleurisy, it was later established that the initial infection was most likely caused by hayfever which I got every year especially while travelling the Moselle in Germany with the grape vines, our favourite holiday destination. Since then I now take a hayfever tablet every day and my hayfever is now under control. - My own personal thanks to Dr Frankland’s work in allergies.\n\nInformation\n\nThe Anaphylaxis Campaign\n\nLiberation Questionnaire - COFEPOW\n\n‘Fight the Good Fight’ by John Bloom"
