        "text": "His Majesty King Edward VII. The King was an alumnus of both Oxford and Cambridge having matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1859 and transferred to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1861. His Majesty was an early pioneer of British ice hockey and played several prominent games while the Prince of Wales – prior to the establishment of the Oxford-Cambridge Ice Hockey Varsity Match – which attracted significant interest to the sport in Great Britain.\n\nIn the winter of 1895, Edward, Prince of Wales, organised and captained a team from Sandringham House, his personal household. On 15 February 1895, the Prince of Wales’s Sandringham team played a team from the House of Commons on the lake at Buckingham Palace and in doing so Prince Edward brought together a number of alumni from both Oxford and Cambridge. The Commons team included future British Prime Minister Arthur Balfour, Victor Cavendish – who would later become the eleventh Governor General of Canada – and Lord Stanley, the sixth Canadian Governor General and namesake of the famed Stanley Cup. In addition to Edward VII, there were three Oxford alumni and five Cambridge alumni between the two teams. Five days after the Prince’s victory over Lord Stanley and the commons, the 1895 Oxford-Cambridge Varsity Match was held at the lake at Blenheim Palace.\n\nWhile the Prince’s time at Oxford preceded the official formation of OUIHC, as an Oxford and Cambridge alumnus, an early pioneer of the sport, and an advocate for the Varsity Match, he is the namesake of the Oxford-Cambridge Varsity Match Trophy.\n\nSir Francis James Wylie, Balliol College 1888. Born in Bromley, Kent, Sir Wylie graduated from St Edward’s School and attended Glasgow University before he received a scholarship to Balliol College where he received a First in Classics in 1888. Though of slight build, he rowed in the Balliol eight whilst at Oxford, was elected to the Vincent’s Club and Leander, and competed on Oxford’s 1895 Varsity Match winning team (6-1 over Cambridge), which was played on a frozen lake at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. Sir Francis was elected a fellow of Brasenose College in 1892 where he was a professor of English Literature. Thus, he competed as a professor (rather than a student) in the 1895 bandy match and was responsible for four of Oxford’s six goals. In 1903, Wylie became the first Warden of Rhodes House for the newly instituted Rhodes Scholarship, acting as the Chief Executive Officer of the Rhodes Trust and Secretary to the Trustees, a position he held until 1931. During the latter years of his tenure, he was knighted by His Majesty King George V (1929). The Oxford History Faculty’s Wylie Prize for the best Final Honours School essay on American history was named in his honour and continues to be awarded.\n\nThe Rt. Rev. Philip Mercer Rhinelander, DD, Christ Church College 1895. Born in Rhode Island, Rhinelander graduated from Harvard University in 1891 and later competed for Oxford alongside Sir Francis James Wylie in the first recorded ice hockey Varsity Match held in Britain (at Blenheim Palace) and was one of the three scoring players in this match. Of the men known to have participated in the 1895 match, Rhinelander was the only non-British player. After returning to the United States, Rhinelander attended Harvard University where he earned the degree of Doctor of Divinity. In 1911, he became the seventh Anglican Bishop of Pennsylvania (1911-1923) and played a key role in the creation of the Washington National Cathedral, where he served as a Trustee.\n\nSir Cecil William Noble Graham, Trinity College 1895. Sir Cecil was a member of the 1895 bandy team and scored one of Oxford’s six goals. Soon after finishing his degree Graham moved to India. He was a Member of the Imperial Legislative Council of India from 1909-1912 and was made a knight bachelor in 1911 at the Delhi Durbar. Sir Cecil was an accomplished athlete; in addition to playing ice hockey he rowed for Trinity College, captained the Calcutta Rowing Club, and was a member of the Calcutta Polo Club teams which won the Indian Polo Association Open Championship in 1908 and 1909. In 1920, Sir Cecil was a member of the International Olympic Committee for Horse Polo.\n\nDr Wilburt Cornell Davison, MD, Merton College, 1913 Rhodes Scholar from New York. While studying medicine at Oxford, Davison became a protégé of Sir William Osler, who profoundly shaped his thinking about many aspects of medical education. After completing a clinical clerkship at Johns Hopkins, Davison volunteered with the American Red Cross on a typhus commission in France and Serbia (1914-1915), and served as a Captain in the medical corps of the US Army’s Allied Expeditionary Force (1917-1919). After the war, Davison returned to Johns Hopkins University, rising rapidly to assistant dean, and left in 1927 to found the Duke University School of Medicine. “Dave”, as he was known to his friends and colleagues, was heavily involved in the planning and directing of the medical school, and was known to don overalls to help the labour crew as construction progressed. He assembled the school’s faculty and served as Dean and Pediatric Chairman for 34 years, during which time the school trained over 1,800 physicians and a veritable army of other healthcare workers. An author of over 200 scientific papers, he helped establish loan funds for rural medical students and was a pioneer in establishing hospital insurance in the United States.\n\nThe Rev. Canon Kenneth Elder Taylor, OBE, ED, DD, Oriel College, awarded the Rhodes Scholarship in 1918, but deferred until 1920. Taylor, a goaltender, was instrumental in reviving ice hockey at Oxford University in the wake of the First World War. He captained the 1920 team and was responsible for the reconstitution of the team as the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club in 1921. Winning the Varsity Match against Cambridge in 1921 (27-0), 1922 (7-1), and 1923 (3-0), Taylor also won the inaugural 1923 Spengler Cup in Davos, Switzerland. Taylor later served in the Canadian Chaplain Service during the Second World War and was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1945 for his wartime service. In 1947, Taylor became the principal of the Anglican Theological College at the University of British Columbia. He was made a Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1949 by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands in recognition of his wartime services in the Netherlands.\n\nEdward Pitblado, The Queen’s College, 1920 Rhodes Scholar from Manitoba. Pitblado was captain of the OUIHC for their Varsity Match win over Cambridge in the 1923 season (3-0), and led the team to victory in the inaugural 1923 Spengler Cup in Davos, Switzerland. As part of the 1923-1924 European tour, the OUIHC played several Olympic ice hockey teams, including the British Olympic hopefuls. Following the OUIHC’s victory over the British team, Pitblado was selected to play as a forward on the British Olympic ice hockey team. Pitblado and the British Olympic team won the bronze medal at the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France. He was instrumental in the founding of Ducks Unlimited and was president of the Manitoba Law Society from 1965 to 1966.\n\nThe Rt. Hon. Lester Bowles Pearson, PC, OM, CC, OBE, St John’s College 1921-1923. A scholar, statesman, soldier, prime minister, Nobel laureate, and diplomat, Pearson attended Oxford on a Massey Foundation Scholarship following his service with the Royal Flying Corps during World War I. He joined Kenneth Taylor’s Oxford University ice hockey team and was a skilled defenceman. He had a distinguished political career following the completion of his studies at Oxford and was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1935 in recognition of his ‘advisory services to International and Inter-Imperial Conferences and Royal Commissions in the Dominion of Canada’. He served as Canadian Ambassador to the United States 1944-1946, was a Member of Parliament for Algoma, Ontario 1948-1968, and President of the United Nations General Assembly, 1952. In 1956 he used the world’s first, large-scale United Nations peacekeeping force to de-escalate the Suez Canal Crisis in Egypt, earning him the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize. He served as the 14th Prime Minister of Canada (1963-1968) and Chancellor of Carleton University 1969-1972. He was also a capable athlete, and played semi-professional baseball as part of the Guelph Maple Leafs. A scholarship has been established in his memory at St John’s College; the first recipient of the Lester B. Pearson Graduate Scholarship was, by chance, a member of the Oxford women’s ice hockey team. The Pearson Cup trophy is also awarded annually to the MVP of the current Men’s Blues team.\n\nThe Rt. Hon. Roland Michener, PC, CC, CMM, OOnt, CD, KStJ, QC, FRHSC(hon), Hertford College, 1919 Rhodes Scholar from Alberta. A skilled lawyer, politician, and diplomat, Michener competed for the OUIHC alongside his lifelong friend, Lester B. Pearson. After graduating, he founded the prominent Toronto law firm Lang Michener in 1924, and later served as a member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the Toronto riding of St David (1945-1948). He entered federal politics as a Progressive Conservative member of Parliament (MP) for Toronto St Paul’s (1953-1962), where he served as Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada (1957-1962). Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson appointed Michener high commissioner to India (1964) and ambassador to Nepal (1965-1967); finally, it was upon Pearson’s recommendation that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II appointed Michener Governor General of Canada (1967-1974). As Governor General, he inaugurated the Order of Canada and was a champion of sport and fitness, establishing the Roland Michener Trophy for the Juvenile “AAA” hockey championship in Ontario. His fondness for jogging also earned him the nickname “Canada’s Jogging Governor General”. Under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau he signed the War Measures Act into law during the October Crisis, and was awarded the Royal Victorian Chain by Queen Elizabeth in 1973. He later served as Chancellor of Queen’s University (1974-1980) and as secretary general of the Rhodes Foundation.\n\nClarence S. Campbell, MBE, QC, Lincoln College, 1926 Rhodes Scholar from Alberta. Campbell captained the OUIHC during the 1928-1929 season and won the Varsity Match against Cambridge in 1929 (1-0). After graduating from Oxford, he worked as a lawyer and was an NHL referee in the 1930s. Campbell enlisted in the Canadian Infantry Corps Armoured Division during the Second World War, and held the rank of lieutenant colonel and subsequently major. He was a skilled lawyer and prosecuted former Nazi officials for crimes against humanity in the immediate post-war years. In 1945, he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire and was appointed King’s Counsel in 1948. He served as the third president of the NHL from 1946 to 1977, and was honorary chairman of the NHL from 1977 until his death in 1984. In 1967, the NHL trophy for the Western Conference playoff championship was named the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl in his honour. Campbell remained a strong supporter of the OUIHC and rallied the alumni to donate funds when the Club was struggling in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe Hon. George F. G. Stanley, CC, CD, KStJ, GCLJ, DPhil, FRSC, FRHistS, FRHSC, Keble College, 1929 Rhodes Scholar from Alberta. As a member of the OUIHC, Stanley defeated Cambridge in the 1929 (1-0) and 1931 (5-1) Varsity Match, and helped Oxford win the 1931 Spengler Cup. While in Oxford he wrote a classic work on Western Canadian history and the Riel rebellions, and later served as deputy director of the Canadian Army’s historical section during World War II. After the war, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, served as President of the Canadian Historical Society, and held professorships in history at Mount Allison University, the University of British Columbia (where he held the first Chair of Canadian History in the country), and at the Royal Military College of Canada. He designed the Maple Leaf Flag in 1964, which replaced the Canadian Red Ensign, and served as the 25th Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick (1981-1987).\n\nCommander Charles Herbert Little, Royal Canadian Navy, CD, FRCGS, Brasenose College, 1930 Rhodes Scholar from Ontario. Little, a goaltender, captained the OUIHC in the 1932-1933 season and was one of the most committed of the club’s leaders since Ken Taylor. He helped lead Oxford to three consecutive Varsity Match wins over Cambridge in 1931 (5-1), 1932 (7-0), and 1933 (1-0), won the Spengler Cup twice (in 1931 and 1932), and was awarded a Full Blue (first introduced for ice hockey in 1933). Before leaving Oxford, he donated a silver cup for an intercollegiate ice hockey competition in the hopes of strengthening the sport at the university and ensuring the longevity of the club. The first competition for the Little Cup was held in 1933, but with the closure of the Oxford ice rink in 1934, the competition ceased and the cup was returned to Little. Little returned to Canada after completing his degree and served as the director of the Naval Intelligence Service of Canada during the Second World War. He was an accomplished historian and was appointed to the Order of Isabella the Catholic by the Government of Spain for his research on the Spanish exploration of British Columbia in the eighteenth century. In March 2000, Little returned to Oxford with his teammate Hugh Whitney Morrison as guests of honour at the Men’s Blues Varsity Match, won by Oxford 4-2 and covered in the New York Times. He generously rededicated the Little Cup, which is now awarded annually.\n\nHugh Whitney Morrison, BA, MA, Merton College, 1930 Rhodes Scholar from Alberta. While earning his BA (Hons.) in Language and Literature at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Hugh had a love of baseball and golf, and had been a star of his high school’s rugby team. In University he played inter-faculty hockey, quarterbacked an inter-faculty football team, and was the sports editor of the University’s newspaper. At Oxford, his 1931-1932 ice hockey team was comprised entirely of Rhodes Scholars, was limited to nine players, and all players except one were Canadians. Oxford that year, with Hugh playing left wing, played 26 games, beat Cambridge in the 1931 Varsity Match (5-1), and went on to win the 1932 English and European (Spengler Cup) championships. Hugh had a long and storied career in media, starting with Lord Beaverbrook’s London Evening Standard, then the Toronto Daily Star, and before and after the war with the CBC. During World War II he worked for British West Indies Airways in Trinidad, and he retired from Humber College in 1983 after 11 years of teaching. In March 2000, Hugh returned to Oxford with his former teammate Charles Herbert Little, of Ottawa, as a guest of honour at the Men’s Blues Varsity Match, won by Oxford 4-2. Hugh wrote about the game and his memories from 1931/32 in the New York Times.\n\nJames Elliot Coyne, OM, The Queen’s College, 1931 Rhodes Scholar from Manitoba. He was awarded a Full Blue as captain of the OUIHC during the 1933-1934 season. He also won the Spengler Cup in 1932 and three consecutive Varsity Matches against Cambridge in 1932 (7-0), 1933 (1-0), and 1934 (4-2). He served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War, and was Governor of the Bank of Canada from 1955 to 1961. His younger brother, John, would also play for the OUIHC and was responsible for its revival following the Second World War. His niece, Deborah Coyne, founded the Oxford women’s team (OUWIHC) in the 1980s.\n\nJohn McCreary “Jack” Coyne, DFC, CStJ, QC, The Queen’s College, 1940 Rhodes Scholar from Manitoba. Coyne deferred his scholarship to join the Royal Canadian Air Force in which he served for the majority of the Second World War. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1945. When Coyne came to Oxford in 1946, he, together with Gordon Blair, re-established the OUIHC. He was made a Commander of the Most Venerable Order of St John in 1978 and served as legal counsel for the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. Coyne was the younger brother of Bank of Canada Governor and OUIHC alumnus James Coyne. His daughter, Deborah (photo: right), came to Oxford in the 1980s and was the founder of Oxford women’s ice hockey. His daughter, Barbara, went to Cambridge and was a member of the Cambridge University Women’s Ice Hockey Club (CUWIHC).\n\nDr Ramsay Gunton, CM, DPhil, MD, FRCPC, University College, 1946 Rhodes Scholar from Ontario. Gunton was part of the early post-war OUIHC and served as president of the club in 1947 and as team captain in 1948, capturing the Varsity Match win against Cambridge in both years. Dr Gunton was one of the first cardiologists to develop the cardiac catheterization technique in Canada. He served as the president of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada from 1986 to 1988. He headed the Toronto General Hospital’s Department of Therapeutics and was chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of Western Ontario. The Western Ontario research chair in cardiology is named in his honour.\n\nThe Hon. Allan Emrys Blakeney, PC, OC, SOM, QC, FRSC, The Queen’s College, 1947 Rhodes Scholar from Nova Scotia. After completing a law degree at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Blakeney arrived in Oxford to study politics, philosophy and economics (PPE). As a member of the OUIHC he saw consecutive Varsity Match wins over Cambridge in 1948 (5-2) and 1949 (4-3), before returning to Canada where he was called to the bar in Saskatchewan in 1951. In 1960, he was elected to the provincial legislature as a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (now the New Democratic Party, or NDP), where he served terms as Saskatchewan’s minister of health, education, and finance, under the governments of Tommy Douglas and Woodrow S. Lloyd. When Premier Lloyd expanded universal health insurance coverage to include medical care provided by doctors in 1962, 90% of doctors went on strike. As health minister at the time, Blakeney successfully negotiated with physicians to keep the new system, which was extended to all Canadians by 1966. He was thus instrumental in the creation of North America’s first publicly funded universal health care system (Medicare). As leader of the provincial NDP, Blakeney later served as Premier of Saskatchewan (1971-1982), and played a key role in the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982.\n\nNicholas deBelleville Katzenbach, Balliol College, 1947 Rhodes Scholar from New Jersey. As a navigator in the United States Army Air Corps in World War II, his B-25 Mitchell Bomber was shot down over the Mediterranean Sea and he spent two years in Italian and German prisoner of war camps, including Stalag Luft III, the site of the “Great Escape”, which he assisted in. After finishing at Princeton and Yale Law School, he came to Oxford from 1947-1949, where he helped the OUIHC to Varsity Match victory (4-3) over Cambridge in 1949. He later served as the US Attorney General (1965-1966) and U.S. Under-Secretary of State (1966-1969), and played a crucial role in the drafting and passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nHarry Chester Butterfield, University College, 1949 Rhodes Scholar from the Colony of Bermuda. One of three Bermudians to ice for OUIHC during the 20th century. He was the son of Sir Harry Durham Butterfield, and like his father attended McGill University where, unlike his father, he fell in love with ice hockey. He was a member of the Bermuda Race Relations Advisory Council from 1966-1976. The Council initially encouraged the passage of the Race Relations Act which was finally enacted in 1969 and prohibited racial discrimination in employment, housing, and services. Following the enactment of the 1969 Race Relations Act, the Council was in charge of investigating allegations of discrimination. Butterfield also served as the President of the Bermuda Bar Association from 1985 until his death in 1987.\n\nH. Ian Macdonald, OC, KLJ, Balliol College, 1952 Rhodes Scholar from Ontario. With his record of 135 goals between 1952-1955, Macdonald remains the leading scorer of the OUIHC. Notably, Macdonald holds the record for most goals scored against Cambridge in a Varsity Match with 9 (29-0 in 1955). He served as the President of York University (1974-1984) and Chairman of Hockey Canada (1987-1994), responsible for Canada’s Olympic and World Championship hockey programme.
