Arthur Lakes (21 December 1844 ? 21 November 1917) was a notable geologist, artist, writer, teacher and minister. He captured much of his geological and palaeontological field work in sketches and watercolours. He was a part-time professor at what later became the Colorado School of Mines when he sent a fossilized vertebra specimen (from the Morrison Formation of Dakota, U.S.) to Othniel Charles Marsh at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History in 1877. He was then employed by Marsh as a field worker to seek other fossils. These fossils and sites are recorded in his artwork. He worked for O.C Marsh from 1877-1880. During this time, he also worked as a teacher at what is now the Colorado School of Mines and as a clergyman. When he retired from fossil hunting, he went on to work for the U.S. Geological Survey.
