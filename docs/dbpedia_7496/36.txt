A giallo is a genre of Italian film thriller / horror and often contains slasher, crime fiction, psychological thriller, psychological horror, sexploitation, and, less frequently, supernatural horror elements.

History[]

From the 1960s to the 1980s (and most prominently in the 1970s) a handful of Italian filmmakers turned out horror and suspense films that nodded to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, but which were on the whole more lurid, ratcheting up the levels of gore and nudity. “Giallo” literally means “yellow,” in reference to the yellow covers common to the sensationalistic Italian pulp novels these movies clearly resemble.
