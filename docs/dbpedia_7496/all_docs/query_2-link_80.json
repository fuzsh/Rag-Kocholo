        "text": "In the cinematic niche known as the Italian giallo film, Mario Bava is father and Dario Argento is king. And Lucio Fulci is the gifted but misanthropic prince who ruins family dinners with his nihilistic rants.\n\nSo where does that leave Sergio Martino? For if there’s a fourth member of the royal family, it has to be Sergio.\n\nHis five gialli—THE STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH, THE CASE OF THE SCORPION’S TAIL, ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK, the incredibly titled YOUR VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM AND ONLY I HAVE THE KEY, and the grindhouse classic TORSO—count among the best the genre offers. Made in uninterrupted succession from 1971 to 1973, these five films reveal their director’s remarkable breadth of visual style and storytelling ability.\n\nYet Martino’s gialli receive scarcely a small fraction of the ink dedicated to maestros Bava, Argento, and Fulci. Why is he so overlooked? I think it’s because his body of work in the genre, as a whole, is difficult to deconstruct and discuss.\n\nMartino biographer Kat Ellinger said as much in her audio commentary for Arrow Video’s 2018 blu-ray release of TORSO by pointing out that there are no overt stylistic or thematic threads running through Martino’s work. His films are simply (yet complicatedly) excellent gialli that do not appear, in the absence of prior knowledge, to have been directed by the same person.\n\nIn comparison, Argento, Bava, and Fulci are easier to write about. Argento’s films tend to favor style and feature epic, set-piece kills that are staged with the auteur’s unique flair for gruesome beauty. The camera work and editing are pre-digital bravura, and the imagery tends toward the stark and vivid. Bava, meanwhile, is the master of painterly shot compositions and can tie a story together, thematically and visually, through color. Fulci’s gialli are dreamlike, full of dread and drifting toward inevitable doom. The director presents a grim view of humanity, and his films part ways with the viewer on the bleakest of notes.\n\nMartino’s giallo output offers no such easy summary. Therefore, we have to assess the films one at a time. In the interest of brevity, I will discuss only his final three gialli in depth. Of his first two, THE STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH is a kinky thriller with a smart, twist-filled script that best approximates what 1940s and 1950s readers would have experienced when absorbed in the lurid “giallo” detective novels of the time. The second, THE CASE OF THE SCORPION’S TAIL, is closer to a conventional crime thriller that nevertheless offers clever deceptions and the outrageous, implausible story turns that make the genre so much fun. Now onto the rest:\n\nALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK (1972)\n\nFor his follow-up to THE CASE OF THE SCORPION’S TAIL, Martino moved in a starkly different stylistic direction that recalls Bava’s use of garish colors and surreal lighting, but he does so with his own flair.\n\nThe plot concerns Jane (Edwige Fenech), a mentally fragile woman who believes she is being followed by a dagger-wielding assassin (Ivan Rassimov). Her boyfriend (George Hilton), sister (Nieves Navarro), and neighbor (Marina Malfatti) each insists on “helping” Jane in opposition to the others, until she no longer knows who to trust.\n\nALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK is filmed in soft-focus and employs a mix of deep colors and overexposed white light to create a dreamy, disorienting effect that symbolizes the protagonist’s deepening confusion and paranoia. The depth-of-field is shallow, blurring backgrounds and foregrounds as the action plays out in the middle. Leaves, branches, reeds, and even hanging beads are placed between the camera and the actors to emphasize that the truth is obscured and, like the characters, resides somewhere between the extremes.\n\nPart of what renders Martino’s gialli elusive, from a standpoint of analysis and discussion, is that they do not fully embrace the genre. ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK owes more to ROSEMARY’S BABY than to Argento’s THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE, the film that inspired the hundreds of gialli produced in Italy and elsewhere throughout the 1970s. It’s equal parts devil-cult movie and “neurotic-female” horror, both popular sub-genres at the time. Ultimately, ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK is a giallo by virtue of the murder-mystery aspect and the body count, though one wonders if Martino (and screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi) incorporated those elements out of commercial necessity. Most of the kills occur off camera and feel perfunctory (just a splash of blood here and there), as if Martino was more enthused about the other components of the story.\n\nYOUR VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM AND ONLY I HAVE THE KEY (1972)\n\nThe evasiveness of Martino’s fourth giallo merely begins at the title; the film as well provides a difficult access point for viewers. There’s no introductory murder scene featuring a black-gloved killer, or glamorous travelogue shots of Venice or Rome. Rather, we are greeted by a long sequence of cringe-inducing humiliations endured by multiple characters at a debauched party inside a crumbling villa.\n\nWhat’s more, we soon realize YOUR VICE lacks a protagonist (of the type viewers latch onto). Every character is a villain, from Luigi Pistilli’s drunken, abusive novelist to Edwige Fenech’s manipulative, conniving vixen to Anita Strindberg’s cat-mutilating, hysterical housewife. The maid, Brenda (Angela La Vorgna), is the only sympathetic character, but she hardly qualifies as a protagonist because, well, spoiler alert. It’s a giallo.\n\nAnd that’s what makes it tricky to analyze, because it’s also not a giallo. Yes, there are kills and a mystery of sorts, but even more so than in ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK, those elements feel shoehorned.\n\nYOUR VICE is at heart a non-supernatural gothic horror film about an alcoholic writer, his humiliated wife, their miserable marriage, and his dead mother who casts a pall over their entire existence. There’s also a (metaphorically) haunted dress and a sinister black cat who does not get along with Strindberg’s character very well.\n\nI’m convinced that Martino is subtly mocking his audience. Not only are the giallo-style kills scenes shoehorned (though well shot and much gorier than those in ALL THE COLORS), the reveal of the killer—SEMI-SPOILER WARNING—comes just over an hour into the movie and is only peripherally connected to the main story. Only upon second viewing are you even likely to recognize the killer’s face, so minor is the character. It’s as if the director had said, “You want a body count and a flimsy plot about superficial characters? Here you go. Now let’s get back the Gothic horror story I was telling.”\n\nStylistically, YOUR VICE couldn’t be more different from ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK. Here the focus is crisp and the colors naturalistic, and in contrast to the earlier film’s abundance of hazy white light and lens flare, the action in YOUR VICE takes place in the dark, with the exception of one outdoor set-piece. Like each character’s motivations, the film’s text lies in the shadows … and emerges as your eyes adjust to repeated viewings.\n\nTORSO (1973)\n\nA series of brutal slayings rocks a university in Perugia, Italy, prompting a group of students to seek refuge in a remote countryside villa … only to discover the killer is not going to give up the chase so easily.\n\nWhereas Martino’s earlier giallo plots are built around troubled relationships and bourgeois foibles, TORSO is pure slasher-movie material: beautiful young college girls, about whom we learn little, are stalked and murdered by a masked psycho. The kill sequences are quite violent, and the actresses’ clothing falls off with regularity. Yes, his prior films featured copious nudity, but those scenes were generally story relevant, and those characters had other duties besides stripping.\n\nIt’s as if the director had capitulated to audience demands for lurid content and then delivered it with mean-spirited panache. Given that this film takes place not in the sophisticated cosmopolitan centers of Rome, Venice, or Milan but rather out where the audiences who craved such exploitation fare actually lived, it’s plausible that Martino is once again satirizing his primary consumers. They are on display as peripheral characters in TORSO and are represented, one-and-all, as leering rubes.\n\nOnce more, Martino reinvents his approach to giallo filmmaking. The pace and energy are ramped up through quick cutting and hand-held camerawork, and the kill sequences take center stage. The emphasis is on pulsing suspense, and the climactic “final girl” stalk-and-chase sequence between the killer and star Suzy Kendall is ripped from a horror film.\n\nIn contrast with YOUR VICE, most of which takes place in a single setting, TORSO is in constant motion, tracking its story from set to set and location to location.\n\nThere are a few threads that tie Martino’s gialli together. The first is the repeated casting of George Hilton, Edwige Fenech, Anita Strindberg, and Ivan Rassimov (until TORSO). The second is the recurring “neurotic female” trope. The third is shots of eyes in extreme close-up, though that flourish is hardly unique to Martino in Italian genre cinema.\n\nThat’s not much fuel if the finish line is understanding Martino’s gialli as a single body of work. Watch any two classic films by Bava, Argento, or Fulci, and the third becomes immediately recognizable as that director’s work. Martino’s versatility meanwhile, instead of being celebrated, earns him the label of “journeyman.”\n\nAlso, he tended to mash up genres. His first effort, THE STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH, is pure giallo, but onward he stirred many outside elements into his plotlines in equal or sometimes greater measure than the giallo components. Two years after TORSO he directed SUSPICIOUS DEATH OF A MINOR, a film that mashes three genres: poliziottesco (cops and criminals), giallo, and slapstick comedy. No wonder this guy is hard to pin down.\n\nThough TORSO is one of his less substantive gialli in terms of character depth, it is a crowd pleaser, especially for those of us whose gateway to giallo cinema was slasher movies. If Martino’s other four entries had featured the same levels of graphic violence, scantily clad college girls, and horror-style suspense, he would probably be more widely recognized as one of the genre’s greats. Even if, at the same time, we’d be losing out on films that are more diverse and, ultimately, rewarding.\n\n***\n\nMy informal, very personal, highly-subject-to-change ranking of Martino’s gialli, from favorite to least favorite (though I like them all):"
