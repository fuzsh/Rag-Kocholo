        "text": "~~~~~\n\nMore about Deep Red, without spoilers, from A. W. Kautzer, The Movie Aisle (edited for length and clarity):\n\n“Argento has created an angry film with conflicting, almost contradictory viewpoints. Deep Red seems to want to focus on counterpoints: progressive vs. conservatism, feminism vs. masculinity, homosexuality vs. homophobia. All play out in the film in a very modern way.\n\n“Argento shows the unfiltered bigotry of characters in stark contrast to the progressive forward-thinking ones. These counterpoints play out in the background, never really becoming plot points but rather adding to the ambiance of the piece.\n\n“As directed by Argento the film is an amazing piece of horror mystery as there has been. The director’s camera constantly roving as the killer. Macro photography that details the killer’s charms and keepsakes.\n\n“The work here still feels fresh almost forty-five years later. There is a sense of playful confidence to the work, a master knowing how an audience will react and subverting that. There is an ornateness to the set pieces that recalls Hitchcock but never feels like he’s aping the master’s style. In all Argento’s work, especially, Deep Red, he feels like he’s digested cinema and style and he’s truly processed it, to come up with his own style.\n\n“Deep Red is the filmmaker at the top of his game before the dream logic took over his work. The story is still grounded in a world with normal conventions of the Giallo Film. To put a blunt point on the matter Deep Red is, in fact, the best “Giallo Film” ever produced. Its strict adherence to the rules and form of the genre brings something out in Argento’s direction and writing.\n\n“There is a focus to Deep Red that isn’t present in his later work. The film is layered with subtext in a way that still works today. The direction is uniformly terrific, with as much style and thought given to even the smaller scenes that separates it from its peers.\n\n“It is fitting that this earmarks the end of a moment in Argento’s career. He would return to Giallos of course. A year later in fact. But Suspiria is a new form of Giallo, with the adding of the supernatural element that is only hinted at and flirted with in Deep Red. Much of his later work (post-Suspiria) within Giallo becomes an outright nightmare, hinging on dream logic and the supernatural more than reality."
