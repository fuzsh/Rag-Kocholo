        "text": "As promised, I do have some things to say about Mario Bava‘s early giallo movies. For the uninitiated, giallo is Italian for the color yellow. It also is the term used for the pulpy mystery digests which were popularized by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore and derives from the predominantly yellow covers of their books. In this sense, the term encompasses everything from the whodunnits of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Dame Agatha Christie, to the horror/thrillers of Thomas Harris and Caleb Carr.\n\nThe movie term however, especially outside of Italy, has become synonymous with a certain type of film: the artsy erotic/thriller/horror film which took its cue from Alfred Hitchcock and was pioneered by Mario Bava and later popularized by director Dario Argento. In the beginning, there were specific guidelines that most of the big directors followed, like a checklist: the titles tends to either mention random animal names or feature numbers (this was the beginning of the body count concept in slasher films) or both! Usually the protagonist is a foreigner (i.e. non-Italian) who witnesses a crime and ends up being so moved by the experience that they try to sleuth out who the perpetrator is. This villain tends to be a faceless anonymous killer with some perverse mania and his more often than not female victims’ graphic and artful demises are usually sexualized in some way.\n\nThe circuitous plotline usually follows the wannabe detective going on a tour of the local sites like a travelogue film, on a quest to solve the case as they struggle with the admonishment of the ineffective police and their hair raising near misses with the killer. The ending usually has a twist of some sort that doesn’t always pay off, but can be amusing at the very least.\n\nMany critics complain that the genre is misogynistic and glorifies violence against women. Many of the directors and writers dispute this claim saying that men are also victims in their films and that for a horror filmmaker to incite fear in the viewer they must sympathize with the person being pursued or attacked and women tend to incite the most sympathy and concern. Also, some of the most insidious villains in giallo films turn out to be women, so… you decide.\n\nMost of these tropes were established in Bava’s first forays into the genre: La ragazza che sapeva troppo (1963, The Girl Who Knew Too Much), and Sei donne per l’assassino (1964, Blood and Black Lace). The former is a sort of spoof, the title being a play on the Hitchcock film The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934/1956). To me it comes off as a variation on Jane Austen‘s Northanger Abbey. Nora Davis (Drowson, in the alternate US cut, Evil Eye) a fanciful young girl who spends her days reading lurid pulp detective stories, finds herself in the midst of a real life crime story. Everyone tries to dismiss her account of having witnessed a murder as fantasies brought on by the distress of the unexpected death of her elderly aunt upon her (the girl’s) arrival into Rome from the US, and her choice of entertainment. The big difference here is that she really does get involved in a true crime. This movie is often cited as the first real giallo film.\n\nI really love this film. It’s funny and dark all at once and has a thrilling murder mystery, as well as a farcical romance. Italian-American actor John Saxon, who may be known to American genre fans from his appearances in Black Christmas (1974) and Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), is the male lead, Dr. Marcello Bassi, who tries throughout the film to court young Nora, with disastrous results.\n\nIn an interval between The Girl Who Knew Too Much and Blood and Black Lace Bava filmed I tre volti della paura (1963, Black Sabbath), a portmanteau film with three individual stories, with an eye towards the American market. It was filmed in color and Hollywood Horror icon Boris Karloff was procured to emcee, as he did in the Thriller television series, introducing each segment and even staring in one of them, The Wurdalak. I have covered this all in a previous post so I won’t go into great detail here. What is significant is that the installment, The Telephone was Bava’s first real attempt at the stylized color thriller, which he fine-tuned to perfection in Blood and Black Lace. The untampered with Italian edit has some of the tropes which would become de rigueur in giallo films: a gorgeous woman presented déshabillé being stalked by a mysterious killer. An illicit affair (between the two females), salacious behavior (the protagonist’s past as a call girl), and a little bit of a twist near the end. Unlike the other installments of the film, The Telephone was presented without the use of colored filters, giving it a very realistic, if somewhat stylized, look. Bava would explore both of these visual styles in Blood and Black Lace.\n\nAfter the success of Black Sunday and Black Sabbath, Bava was given creative control over Blood and Black Lace. A German/Italian production, the backers apparently expected a black & white, Edgar Wallace type krimi, and Bava gave them so much more, a Technicolor bloodbath emphasizing some of the more prurient aspects of the mystery and presenting highly stylized and murder scenes with a focus on eroticizing the transgressive act. The story takes place in a fashion house where the diary of a recently murdered model is discovered by a colleague, causing a ruckus as many suspects attempt to get their hands on it to see if their own secrets are revealed therein. One of them, however, is willing to kill for it, and models start dropping like flies as the hunt for the faceless killer plays out like a whodunnit gone awry. The film is beautiful to watch as every scene is beautifully staged in exquisite, lush Eastman color. The general scenes appear in a normal, if visually heightened, mise-en-scène, and the more mysterious or even straight up violent scenes are filmed using colored filters giving them an almost psychedelic feel.\n\nThe movie, like Bava’s previous efforts, pushed the envelope of what was permissible, or at least what had been seen up to that point in film. The murders were elaborately staged and somewhat gruesome for the time period. One woman has her face pressed onto a glowing hot furnace, and another is killed with a spiked medieval gauntlet. In fact, the latter scene made such an impression, that in Denmark the film is known as The Iron Hand in the Night of Horror.\n\nThis was also one of the first films that emphasized a body count, with the literal English translation of the title being ‘Six Women for the Murderer”. For me though, what makes this such a great movie is the look. It is so beautiful to look at. The colors are so lush, and are used in a very interesting way, much like director Dario Argento would later do with Suspria (1977). Colored filters or even just colored rooms and mannequins give the film a very distinct and artful look, and apparently, his cinematographer had a lot to do with that.\n\nAlthough a lot of Bava’s creative success relies on his knowledge of old school visual effects and his uniquely artistic eye for composition, the fluidity of the camera work in his early films also owes a lot to cinematographer Ubaldo Terzano. Unfortunately, Terzano took umbrage at the fact he felt unacknowledged for his contribution to Bava’s films and parted ways with him after this film and his influence is conspicuously absent from Bava’s remaining filmography, which although still artful, never quite looked as lush or as lovely as the earlier films with Terzano.\n\nLastly, I would be remiss in not mentioning the score by Carlo Rustichelli, the main theme of which has a jazzy noir feel to it, that fits perfectly with the vibe of the film. It gets used a lot in the movie, to the chagrin of some reviewers, but I love the theme, so I don’t mind.\n\nInitially panned for it’s unprecedented violence and (according to critics) “wooden acting”, Blood and Black Lace has fared better in posterity, becoming a major influence on the development of the giallo movie genre, inspiring the likes of Dario Argento, et al. Bava went on to make his own idiosyncratic gialli throughout the 70s with varying success. I have seen some like 5 bambole per la luna d’agosto (1970, Five Dolls for an August Moon), featuring the delicious damsel in distress of many a giallo: Edwige Fenech, or the truly bizarre Il rosso segno della follia (1970, Hatchet for a Honeymoon). But more on those in the next installment…"
