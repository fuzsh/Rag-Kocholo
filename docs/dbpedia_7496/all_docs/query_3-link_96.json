        "text": "Last Updated on March 16, 2024 by Amber T\n\nCelebrated genre and Giallo maestro Dario Argento is the subject of a new documentary retrospective, Dario Argento Panico, with Deadline reporting today that Shudder have acquired streaming rights for the U.S., Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nDirected by Simone Scadfi, Dario Argento Panico celebrates the life and work of the mastermind behind Suspiria, Deep Red, Phenomena, Opera, Tenebrae and so very much more. The doc made its world premiere at Venice Film Festival earlier this year, and will hit Shudder on February 2, 2024.\n\nAccording to Deadline, the full focus of the film will be:\n\n“…an insightful journey through the life and legacy of the legendary Italian filmmaker, revealing his profound impact on horror and his lasting influence on cinema. It was in the secluded ambience of hotel rooms that Argento crafted his greatest cinematic creations, seeking solace from the outside world to delve into his nightmares. Now, he finds himself in a hotel room to return to the very setting that ignited his creative fervor to conclude his latest script and participate in an intimate interview, all while being followed by a film crew documenting his life for a movie about his illustrious career.”\n\nDario Argento Panico will feature exclusive interviews with the man himself, as well as with fellow genre titans Guillermo del Toro, Gaspar Noé and Nicolas Winding Refn."
