        "text": "Welcome back to Horror 101, a series of articles where we explain horror movie legends and their lore. For beginners, the confused, or just those who need a refresher, these articles are for you.\n\nIn this giant-size edition of Horror 101 that opens our year of lectures-that-aren’t-really-lectures, I delve into the subgenre all the Letterboxd cool kids have been talking about. Where did all these black gloves and knives come from? What’s a Dario Argento? You don’t know what it means, and at this point, you’re too afraid to ask. That word most people dread having to explain without spilling into rambling: giallo.\n\nI was like you once, soft, uninitiated. Now my brain has been replaced with a hard drive made exclusively of the best of Italian horror (at the very least the most stylish ones). So today, you’ll learn everything giallo, how it came to be, and why it matters.\n\nWHAT IS GIALLO?\n\nAn extremely popular subgenre of horror that sprung out of Italian cinema in the 1960s, an exact definition of giallo usually comes with a lot of qualifiers and moving parts that make it hard to explain concisely. The simplest definition? Giallo (plural gialli) is a very stylized subgenre that fuses thriller and horror, usually set in Italy and focused on a sometimes erotic and always extremely violent murder mystery.\n\nPredating the slasher genre as we know it, many giallo plots tend to converge on a familiar path: someone witnesses a murder—or more broadly, anything they weren’t meant to see (cult conspiracies, ill-gotten treasures, etc., etc.), and sets off a chain of very grisly killings by the person or people trying to keep it a secret.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGialli generally skews the traditional murder mystery formula, as they’re rarely cut and dry, and often subvert the conventional detective story with sudden revelations and twists in the case’s development (logically inconsistent as they may be). The mystery killer is usually given a big reveal in the finale, as well as an explanation of their motives, which may or may not come in the form of a long speech or series of flashbacks. Slap an evocative sentence-long title on it, and boom. Giallo!\n\nEven then, this is a bit narrow to encapsulate the massive scope of giallo and doesn’t touch on the stylistic elements that make the subgenre. Why it looks the way it does is just as important as when and where it came from.\n\nWHY DOES GIALLO LOOK THE WAY IT DOES?\n\nThe directorial greats of giallo tended to depict their mysteries with luscious technicolor, hot palettes, and employing some very uncommon camerawork with plenty of zooms and close-ups. Sometimes it evokes sheer terror, sometimes it stuns the senses, but it’s always incredibly stylish, and makes for beautiful cinema.\n\nGiallo’s very vibrant and saturated colors, love of grotesque close-ups (especially on eyeballs), and odd camera angles are easy to write off as a byproduct of the psychedelic boom that enthralled films of the 60s and 70s. But in reality, directors like Argento and Bava derived a lot of inspiration from the surrealist and German expressionist art movements that came before them. The former claims Luis Bunuel as one of his more prominent muses, and homages to Bunuel and Dali’s Un Chien Andalou can be found in more than a few of his films as a result.\n\nIn a way, giallo’s style doesn’t bridge the gap between the real and the surreal as much as it demolishes the gap altogether; framing unconventional crime stories through a lens of even less conventional presentation leaves the boundaries of realism very fuzzy, and creates a one-of-a-kind look that trades off verisimilitude for a gorgeous visual language.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWHY IS IT CALLED GIALLO?\n\nSurprisingly, the name doesn’t come from cinema, but rather from literature. In the late 1920s, Italian localizations of English crime-thriller novels and American pulp detective stories came into fashion throughout Italy. Printed by publisher Mondadori in a signature yellow cover, and giallo being the Italian word for yellow, giallo became synonymous with cheap murder mystery stories packaged in dime novel bindings.\n\nFilm scholar Ian Olney points out in his book Euro Horror that as Mondadori expanded into publishing original fiction, a literary style known as the “anti-detective story” cropped up alongside it; this type of novel often decentralized the focus from a hero detective solving the case to showing readers the more sensual and chaotic aspects of a crime spree, with the mystery really only pulling together in the final chapters.\n\nOlney believes early giallo filmmakers like Bava intentionally presented their mysteries similarly to the anti-detective stories. Audiences and critics then saw the similarity and popularized giallo as shorthand, explaining how the word became a catch-all for the films to this day.\n\nWHAT WAS THE FIRST GIALLO FILM?\n\nIt is generally agreed that the genre’s father, Mario Bava, made the first giallo film with The Girl Who Knew Too Much back in 1963.\n\n…That being said, if you go into it expecting the much crazier sights and sounds of giallo as we know it, it will come up pretty short; for me, it just feels too much like the conventional murder mysteries of the era. Barring some slightly expressionist strains in Bava’s directing, I doubt most uninitiated would even recognize The Girl as giallo when put up next to its genre descendants like Torso or Don’t Torture A Duckling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMovie historian Fabio Melelli asserts that an even better example would be the film he followed The Girl up with, 1964’s Blood and Black Lace. I’m hard-pressed to agree considering this one contains all the elements most associated with the genre and feels a lot more like a true beginning. The tradition’s roots may have taken hold with The Girl Who Knew Too Much, but it flowered its colorful, blood-stained petals with Blood and Black Lace.\n\nIndeed, Mario Bava is undoubtedly the most important of all of these filmmakers for making the genre what it is. He’s followed closely in influence only by Dario Argento, whose fame would go on to break out of giallo stardom into being one of the most acclaimed horror directors of all time.\n\nArgento is possibly the most prolific giallo artist, putting out a whopping 16 gialli in his career, some of which would go on to be critical and cult darlings. Argento’s Suspiria is undoubtedly the most popular giallo of all time despite its debated status (more on that later), followed only by the beloved Deep Red.\n\nLucio Fulci’s contributions to the genre made him the proverbial bad boy of giallo, a lord of gore often lambasted for the shocking amounts of violence in his films. Regularly making it to the Video Nasties list in the U.K. meant nothing to him; I mean, are you truly a devoted filmmaker if you don’t catch a few charges in the process of making your films?\n\nBava, Argento, and Fulci formed the big three, often collaborating and considering each other good friends. Despite their often disparate styles, the crew went on to make a catalog of gialli that would change the horror landscape forever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nARE THERE AMERICAN GIALLO FILMS?\n\nGiallo’s influence outside of Italy manifested early on in regular appearances in American grindhouses, being served in dubbed forms alongside the rest of the cinema junk food in the U.S. (And who doesn’t love junk food?).\n\nAs Italian and American horror cohabitated, American filmmakers began to take pages from their European cousin’s playbooks. The most notable aspect of mystery killers stalking their victims and brutally dispatching them became a popular story in the slasher subgenre’s formative years. This resulted in the creation of not only slashers, but some infrequent and very well-made American gialli as well.\n\nBrian DePalma’s Dressed to Kill is probably the most notable since it saw some solid commercial success, and its story hits all the classic giallo beats. The John Carpenter penned Eyes of Laura Mars, and even more surprisingly, William Friedkin’s ultra-controversial Cruising has been labeled by some as a part of the genre too. We would only see more explicit homages in the following decades as giallo’s time in the spotlight inevitably passed.\n\nWHY DID GIALLO FALL OUT OF FASHION?\n\nLike many film trends, giallo was always living on borrowed time. As tastes changed in 80s and 90s cinema, gialli were soon subsumed by the supernatural and slasher films that became more popular in America. This reverberated into European horror fans’ tastes, with Italian audiences losing interest in black-gloved killers and contrived mysteries favoring the quick and dirty ultraviolence of Western monsters like Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees.\n\nOne major contributing factor to giallo’s gradual dip in popularity was that many of its greatest creatives left it behind to focus on other styles of film. Bava and Fulci were never ones to be pinned down to a single genre. Argento has long been maligned by critics for the slow decline in quality of his giallo works; however, his foray into supernatural horror saw him dip in and out of the genre regularly and deliver unexpectedly good gialli like The Stendahl Syndrome and Dark Glasses reliably late into his career.\n\nUnfortunately, the sun has set on giallo as a popular trend, but that still hasn’t stopped it from echoing through pop culture. Films like Adam Brooks’ and Matthew Kennedy’s The Editor still pay tribute to the genre decades later, as do the works of Argentinian director Luciano Onetti with modern gialli like Deep Sleep and Abrakadabra.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven midrange box office hits like James Wan’s Malignant borrow from the giallo greats, partaking in their aesthetic, presentation, and off-kilter plots. That is to say, if you couldn’t restrain giallo by country, how could you ever think to restrain it by time?\n\nIt’s giallo now, giallo forever.\n\nWHAT GIALLO SHOULD I WATCH FIRST?\n\nNow, there is no correct answer to this.\n\nBut in my humble opinion, Opera. It is Opera. Aesthetically, performance-wise, the mystery of it, the film synthesizes into an exceptionally fun time. It returns to the surrealist origins of giallo through Argento’s direction in a delightful way. Opera also has one of my favorite shots in all of horror (you’ll know what it is when you see it). Watch it.\n\n…But I am nothing if not thorough, so here are some case-by-case recommendations for other giallo you can watch first based on what you like.\n\n• Watch Blood and Black Lace first if you want to get the quintessential giallo experience. It is the genre codifier, and not for no reason. Bava’s camerawork in this is inhumanly smooth, the lighting and framing is an evergreen class in setting the tone of a film, and the mystery killer here is quite possibly the scariest in the genre just for how brutal and rough every attack feels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n• Watch Deep Red first if you care mainly about the cinematography and brutal kills because it is amazing on a technical level. Still, if you care about the mystery killer’s reveal, you might be disappointed: it’s easy to figure out before the movie has even really begun if you have working eyes. That being said, it has the best soundtrack of all gialli, and is mandatory viewing just for that, so you will have to watch it eventually.\n\n• If you want a bay of blood in your giallo film watch…well, A Bay of Blood. It’s very, very nasty, and the very meanspirited voice and characters make it a satisfying precursor to the slasher genre. I know a lot of people out there consider this the ur-slasher, and I agree. Most of the 80s slasher filmmakers owe Mario Bava a lot for their style.\n\n• If you gravitate towards the more crime-drama aspects of giallo and like a very investigative crime film, you can’t go wrong with Death Walks on High Heels. It makes for a very engaging mystery, and it manages to do that while staying comprehensible! Try The Psychic if you want something similar but with more of a slow-burn pace.\n\n• And if all you care about is an insane ending, go with Four Flies on Grey Velvet. Seriously, you will never be able to predict that final scene.\n\n…SO. IS SUSPIRIA GIALLO?\n\nOh right, the “more on that later” is “more on that now”.\n\nSome only consider films giallo if they’re straightforward, Italian murder mystery stories with no supernatural elements. Others are more neutral and consider it giallo as long as it contains the spirit of the genre, allowing it to bend rules and tonal borders. Even Fangoria put out an article last summer with a pretty bold title fighting against its classification as such.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat being said, even films like Deep Red touch the supernatural: that film’s plot is incited by a legitimate psychic reading a crowd and accidentally finding the killer. Psychic phenomena are such a staple of giallo that there’s even a proper term for giallo with more supernatural elements: giallo-fantastico, coined by film scholar Kim Newman.\n\nSo yes, I would say Suspiria is giallo. It is a very conventional giallo mystery with some grisly murders, and until the supernatural elements show up, it’s indistinguishable from its contemporaries.\n\n***\n\nA special thanks to writers Ian Olney, Arrow Film’s own Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, and also everyone involved in Federico Caddeo’s wonderfully informative documentary All the Colors of Giallo.

While most of the action takes place on the asphalt as psychotic hillbillies chase their prey down in trucks and slashers hide in the backseat of their target’s cars, both killers and victims alike need somewhere to stay on long nights. You need a place to lay your head down. You need a hotel.\n\nAnd because Horror Press always has the concerned traveler in mind, we’ve reviewed some classic horror movie hotels and motels and rated how nice they’d actually be to stay in.\n\nWe’re factoring in four key qualities and rating them on a scale of 1 to 10:\n\nThe quality of the staff and management\n\nThe cleanliness and comfort of the rooms\n\nThe amenities available to guests\n\nOh, and most importantly, how cool I am with dying here (abbreviated as H.C.A.I.W.D.H?).\n\nBecause…it’s a horror movie hotel, you’re probably going to die there.\n\nWe’ll be beginning with the most unpleasant and working our way up to the best. Unsurprisingly, we start with…\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRATING HOTELS IN HORROR\n\nTHE KAHIKI PALMS MOTEL (THE DEVILS REJECTS)\n\nEven before the brutal torture and murders that took place here, the Kahiki Palms Motel wasn’t a sight for sore eyes when pulling off the highway. It’s got many of the same problems the Bates Motel has (more on that later), and the place is completely filthy even before the Firefly’s step foot in it.\n\nBeyond that, you’re in the middle of Texas cooking in the heat, with no AC and an ice machine that has definitely got sand in it. No bueno. The exterior looks cool at least, just stop and take some photos out there without actually checking in.\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 1/10\n\nROOMS: 1/10\n\nAMENITIES: 1/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 1/10\n\nSEVEN DOORS HOTEL (THE BEYOND)\n\nThe Seven Doors Hotel is smack dab in the southern United States, in a woody and almost swampy part of Louisiana, near New Orleans but sitting directly over one of the seven gates to hell. It’s in disrepair, like many of the others on the list, but that’s nothing a little tender care and love from the new management can’t fix!\n\nJust kidding, this place is unfixable.\n\nYou should never stay at a hotel being run out of desperation. The owner, Liza, is hard up on cash and willing to put up with some supernatural nonsense to try and turn a profit, but she’s in way over her head. Some people just don’t have the heart or brains for hospitality, let alone hospitality when there’s some Lovecraftian black magic going on. An abundance of zombies and a possessed dog put this pretty low on the list of voluntary stays, especially when there aren’t any good views of nature to make up for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteer clear of this weird antebellum health hazard if you can, although a one-night excursion might be your only choice if the state of Airbnb in New Orleans is as terrible as it is everywhere else.\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 3/10\n\nROOMS: 5/10\n\nAMENITIES: 3/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 3/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOVERALL RATING: 3/10\n\nBATES MOTEL (PSYCHO FRANCHISE)\n\nLet’s get all the iterations of this place out of the way, since they’re pretty much the same: they’re kind of sleepy, fairly dusty, and completely underserviced given they don’t get much business. The biggest highlight of staying here is that beautiful house out back, and you don’t even really get to enjoy that outside of seeing Norman pace in the window. Sorry, seeing Mother pace in the window. There’s a difference.\n\nAssuming you are not a woman Bates falls in love with or someone investigating him, you’re pretty safe; after all, it’s just him. But it’s also just him running the motel. He is fairly nice when he isn’t consumed by a homicidal persona but remember: all it takes is one of his mental breakdowns happening during the night for him to be in a mumu walking around with a kitchen knife while the front desk phone is left ringing. Next thing you know, you’re waiting for room service while he’s cleaning up the remains of some private detective off the floor. You’re alive, but you’re also waiting for a cold, probably poorly cooked burger.\n\nStaff and management get two points since it’s technically one guy with two personalities, but that’s being generous.\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 2/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nROOMS: 4/10\n\nAMENITIES: 3/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H.?: 6/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 4/10\n\nTHE HOTEL CORTEZ (AMERICAN HORROR STORY: HOTEL)\n\nI’m not staying here, there’s like eight different ways you could die and none of them are good! Why would I ever—wait was that Lady Gaga?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSTAFF AND MANAGEMENT: 10/10\n\nROOMS: 6/10\n\nAMENITIES: 6/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 1/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 6/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHE YANKEE PEDDLER INN (The Innkeepers)\n\nI like Ti West’s directing, but I’m not going to Connecticut to sleep in a tough queen bed with a scratchy quilt. It could be worse, as we’ve seen with previous entries on this list, but it could also be better. Claire and Luke seem like pretty reliable employees, and as long as you don’t go around swinging crystal pendulums and disturbing the traumatized ghosts, you should be fine. 6’s across the board, I guess?\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 6/10\n\nROOMS: 6/10\n\nAMENITIES: 6/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 6/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOVERALL RATING: 6/10\n\nTHE DOLPHIN HOTEL (1408)\n\nThere is only one room in the hotel that is technically haunted, but we have to assume you’re getting that one because it’s kind of the whole premise of the movie. In which case, you have a 99% chance of dying in a horrible way, and you don’t get any rest or relaxation as the spirits haunting Room 1408 pump your brain full of harrowing illusions.\n\nIt’s not a very safe space for people wrestling with trauma or suffering from pre-existing mental health issues, but I guess what a haunted house is? Our protagonist, Mike, does manage to escape in the end (at least, one of the four endings this film has, I haven’t seen the others), but unless you have a bottle of 151-proof in your luggage to torch the place, you’re ironically kind of cooked.\n\nStaff seemed nice when they aren’t letting you walk to your death, it’s got a good view, and you’ll at least have something interesting to write about if you make it out of there.\n\nEditor, don’t even think about it.\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 7/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nROOMS: 7/10\n\nAMENITIES: 7/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 1/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 6/10\n\nTHE OVERLOOK HOTEL (THE SHINING, DOCTOR SLEEP)\n\nA scary giant hedge maze, snow-blanketed exteriors, and a high-quality turn-of-the-century architectural experience. Good lord, it even has high vaulted ceilings and clean-cut interior design. There are even opportunities to go skiing nearby. The Overlook gets a bad rap for being the site of a bunch of gruesome killings, but in their defense, your honor, the hotel was just evil. All that other stuff happened because the vibes were off.\n\nIs it possible to rehabilitate the place like the Torrance family tried? Not at all. Will you die if you stay there? Absolutely. Is it kind of worth it, cause the place is just so gorgeous? I’m not here to make that judgement for you, but you know you only get to travel so many times in your life, you might as well make the last one a bang.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can always count on the management and other guests to be particularly friendly, helping you out of pickles like getting locked in a pantry. They enable your bad habits too, of course, but at least you’ll have company once you’ve frozen to death out there. Who knows, they might even put you in one of their cool time paradox photos!\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 8/10\n\nROOMS: 8/10\n\nAMENITIES: 6/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 6/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOVERALL RATING: 7/10\n\nTHE GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL (TWIN PEAKS)\n\nThis is objectively the right answer, no? The entire Great Northern Hotel is gorgeous with its rich, dark, wood interiors, lit warmly and designed with comfort in mind. It’s serene, has a beautiful look to it, and if you’re not Dale Cooper, your chances of getting shot in the stomach are zero to none!\n\nAnd sure, the Horne Family that runs it is, on occasion, embroiled in scandal. And MAYBE Benjamin Horne is an irredeemable piece of garbage who wants to tear down the Ghostwood forest. And MAYBE he also owns a combination casino and brothel that he frequents. And MAYBE he’s partially responsible for the murder of a young woman who may or may not have been tortured to death by a demon/spirit/tulpa/doppleganger/Lynchian nightmare but…I mean, look at it! Tell me you wouldn’t want to stay there! Stop trying to take this away from me!\n\nAt least the Great Northern doesn’t have fish in its percolator.\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 2/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nROOMS: 10/10\n\nAMENITIES: 10/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 10/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 8/10\n\nAdvertisement"
