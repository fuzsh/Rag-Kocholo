        "text": "From classic horror films to aestheticization in the digital age We live in an era in which any artistic manifestation receives aesthetic and conceptual influences from other fields, or from its past «I». Transversality, revision and homage have come to stay, and cinema is no stranger to this reality. While it is true that the new digital technologies allow us to revisit previous places, themes and aesthetics, but with a different result-due to the change of the means and tools used-, in the end, when we are in front of the screen, we recognize the heritage of those who, for more than a century, have contributed to creating the art of cinema. This thematic line has infinite ways or ramifications to deal with, but in this case we will address the influence, in current audiovisual productions-including in fantasy and horror films-of the aesthetic and expressive contributions around the cinematography that the Giallo introduced in his film contributions. It will be taken for this, as a notable example for the analysis, the work of Darío Argento and that of Mario Bava and other creators of this subgenre. In the same way, the work in the photography and art direction of these films and, in particular, the cinematographer Luciano Tovoli in the film Suspiria (1977) will be examined.\n\nIn the first part of the paper the author briefly revisits two of the most important traditions that stand behind the contemporary conceptualizations of affect: the Deleuzian tradition and the Lacanian one. Having pointed to the most important features of the two lines of thinking affect, as well as to certain difficulties that arise within them, the author proceeds to offer his own simple conceptual model that would be operative in thinking about film experience. The model involves feeling, emotion and affect as three distinct phenomena; the concept of \"ex-spectator\" is introduced in order to account for the crucial difference between emotion and affect. In the second part of the paper, the model is tested against the later films by Quentin Tarantino. The films are presented as \"affective\": by skilfully operating with \"reflective images\" they are able to deconstruct the subject of the ex-spectator into the split-but-real, affected self of the true spectator.\n\nIn Michelangelo Antonio’s L’Eclisse (1962), Cold War Rome is conceived of as a sequence of controlling frames from which the camera seeks liberation. In the opening sequence a reversed picture frame vies with an electric fan in a modernist flat to convey the grueling endgame of a long-term love affair in terms of the conflict between traditional and contemporary art media. This paper examines the film’s contribution to an understanding of the emotional necessity behind contemporary art’s rejection of the past and the birth of new media in 1960s Italy.\n\nIn this paper, I argue that Indian independent filmmaker Pankaj Rishi Kumar's documentary In God’s Land (2012) blends animation and live-action to illuminate the destructive nuances of postcolonial literary scholar, Rob Nixon's notion of slow violence. In turning to cinema, I also suggest that In God’s Land’s “aesthetic strategies” further eco-film scholarship’s recent interests in animation, which have tended to highlight the mode's \"feel good affect.\" I draw attention to In God's Land's hybrid of dark, discordant animation spectacle interspliced in the documentary live-action to articulate the potential of eco-animation outside of this affect. Ultimately, the film not only draws attention to animation’s non-playful affect—its potentials and dilemmas, but I also suggest that reading such a film adds postcolonial understandings of cinema beyond the Western/Japanese center on with eco-animation scholars have so far focused."
