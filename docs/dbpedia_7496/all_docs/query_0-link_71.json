        "text": "Below are some of the best Italian directors ever. Click on their pictures to discover more about them.\n\nA Brief History of the Giallo\n\nGiallo, a unique genre of film, has its roots deeply embedded in the cultural and cinematic history of Italy. The term “giallo,” Italian for “yellow,” originally referred to a series of cheap paperback mystery novels with yellow covers that were popular in post-WWII Italy. This genre of film, however, transcended its low origins to become a distinct cinematic style known for its blend of mystery, thriller, and horror elements, characterised by stylised direction, vivid colours, and often a psychological edge.\n\nThe evolution of giallo can be traced back to the early 1960s. It was Mario Bava, a cinematographer turned director, who is credited with creating the first true giallo film, “The Girl Who Knew Too Much”. Bava’s work, particularly “Blood and Black Lace”, set the standards for the genre: a high-style approach to lighting and colour, a focus on graphic violence, and a tendency towards baroque or rococo settings. These elements became the hallmark of giallo films, influencing many directors who followed.\n\nThe 1970s saw the peak of the giallo movement, with directors like Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci becoming prominent. Argento’s “The Bird with the Crystal Plumage” was a commercial success and is often considered one of the best giallo films ever made. His later works, like “Deep Red” and “Suspiria”, though veering towards supernatural horror, retained key elements of giallo and pushed the boundaries of on-screen violence and stylistic visuals. Lucio Fulci, another key figure, also contributed significantly to the genre with films like “A Lizard in a Woman’s Skin” and “Don’t Torture a Duckling”.\n\nThe influence of giallo can be seen in the work of later filmmakers outside Italy, contributing to the development of slasher and crime thriller genres in Hollywood. Directors like John Carpenter and Brian De Palma have cited giallo films as an influence on their work. The genre’s emphasis on visual style, narrative twists, and psychological depth left a lasting impact on international cinema.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a renewed interest in giallo films, with contemporary directors drawing inspiration from the genre’s distinct style and themes. This revival has led to the production of films that pay homage to the classic giallo style, blending it with modern sensibilities."
