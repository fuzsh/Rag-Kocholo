        "text": "I believe we have lots of giallo-fans on this board so I opened new topic to discuss these great films, dvd releases, music etc.\n\nI’ve collecting giallos for few years now and I believe I’ve seen about 30 film so far, my favorite films are: What have you done to Solange?, All the colours of the Dark, Spasmo, Death walks at High Heels, Bird with Crystal Plumage, Killer must Kill Again… among others.\n\nAnd to those who doesn’t know what “giallo” means, here’s the link to wikipedia:\n\nLike SW’s and italian crime films I also like the Giallo genre.\n\nI just recently began collecting them.\n\nMy small collection this far:\n\nBird with the crystal plumage.\n\nCat O’nine tails.\n\nCold eyes of fear.\n\nProfondo Rosso.\n\nPhenomena.\n\nSuspiria.\n\nThe Black belly of the Tarantula.\n\nTenebre.\n\nThe girl who knew too much.\n\nThe case of the Scorpions tail.\n\nThe Strange vice of Mrs.Wardh.\n\n[quote=“Dorado, post:4, topic:520”]The version of Profondo Rosso I have is from Platinium Media Corporation it runs 123 min.\n\nAnd I would agree with you that Phenomena and Suspiria belongs more to the horror genre.\n\nOf the ones I have seen Tenebre and The Black belly of the Tarantula are my favorites.[/quote]\n\nSuspiria is not a giallo that’s for sure, but Phenomena can be considered as one and it sometimes is.\n\nAnyway I love giallos, porbably my second favourite genre after spaghetti westerns\n\nI love Giallo’s, especially some of the Sergio Martiono ones, one of my favourites is Massimo Dallamano’s “WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO OUR DAUGHTERS”\n\nI especially like giallo’s with crime elements (i know there are crimes taking place but i think you know what i mean :))\n\nSergio Martino is also one of my favorite directors, to bad he only did one SW. I have not seen any of his giallos yet, but I have ordered two “The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh” and\n\n\"The Case of the Scorpion’s Tail\"\n\nHe also made the two best films in the italio-postapocalypse genre “2019 After the Fall of New York” and “Hands of Steel”\n\n[quote=“Dorado, post:8, topic:520”]Sergio Martino is also one of my favorite directors, to bad he only did one SW. I have not seen any of his giallos yet, but I have ordered two “The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh” and[/quote]Both great films, it’s a pity noshame dvd have slowed down because they were putting out some great releases.\n\nI’ve Fairly recently begun collecting some of these films too. So far i have;\n\nTHe Killer Must Kill Again\n\nStrip Nude For Your Killer\n\nA White Veil For Mariale\n\nYour Vice Is A Locked Room and Only I have The Key\n\nAll The Colours Of The Dark\n\nSpasmo\n\nThe Strange Vice Of Mrs Wardh\n\nCrimes of The Black Cat\n\nThe Night Evelyn Came Out Of The Grave\n\nHatchet For The Honeymoon\n\nLove On A Razor’s Edge (the imdb has this listed as a giallo but i’m not quite sure if it is)\n\nCold Eyes Of Fear\n\nI also have Bay of Blood, Lisa and the Devil and The Whip and The Body, though i’m unsure as to whether they are actually more horror films.\n\nMy favourites would have to be “Strange Vice Of Mrs Wardh” and “The Night Evelyn Came Out Of The Grave” (Anthony Steffen in an unusually manic performance!). There are definitely quite a few others i’ll be getting, though, for the life of me, i just can’t get into the Argento stuff for some reason ???\n\nI felt same way about Argento but I have started to like some of them recently. Bird with Crystal Plumage is a A-grade giallo and Tenebre is worth checking too (and has a good soundtrack). I also liked Stendhal Syndrome which was much better than I expected.\n\nBy the way, I’ll recommend you to see What Have You Done to Solange? Great film!\n\n[quote=“Bill san Antonio, post:14, topic:520”]I felt same way about Argento but I have started to like some of them recently.

And i did see Stendhal Syndrome (but for a “girly” reason(!)), and it was OK.\n\nI’ll look out for “What Have You Done To Solange” though. Am i right in thinking that it starrs Fabio Testi?\n\n[quote=“Dorado, post:8, topic:520”]Sergio Martino is also one of my favorite directors, to bad he only did one SW.
