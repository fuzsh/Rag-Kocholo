        "text": "What: Circular feature celebrating Nobel Prize winners, all of whom worked at the city‚Äôs university.\n\nWhere: Stadtfriedhof (city cemetery) in G√∂ttingen.\n\nG√∂ttingen is a university town in central Germany. Not only will I find a memorial to Nobel Prizes, I‚Äôm here also to acknowledge my academic training. I spent many years studying physics and astronomy, and while I‚Äôm no longer active in science research, I enjoy the search and discovery of the final resting spots for scientists whose work formed a significant part of my education. Visiting their graves provides direct historical connection to ‚Äúacademic predecessors‚Äù; to go beyond the abstraction of simply learning their names and contributions to science, the gravestones belong to real people with keen minds, family lives, and all too human imperfections.\n\n45 Nobel Prize laureates have been or are connected with the Georg-August-Universit√§t G√∂ttingen as of posting (2018). That‚Äôs a phenomenal number, as this single institution accounts for 8 per cent of all Nobel Prizes (585 as of 2017).\n\nHighlights\n\nNobel Rondel\n\nMax BORN\n\nOtto HAHN\n\nMax von LAUE\n\nWalther NERNST\n\nMax PLANCK\n\nOtto WALLACH\n\nAdolf WINDAUS\n\nRichard ZSIGMONDY\n\nDirections\n\nNobel Rondel\n\nWhile the Chinese already knew about gunpowder since the 9th-century AD/CE, Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel (1833‚Äì1896) figured out how to stabilize and invent dynamite in the second half of the 19th-century. Safer demolition with stable explosives meant a big fortune for Nobel, and in his final will, he aside funds and instituted prizes to award the highest distinctions in chemistry, literature, medicine/physiology, peace, and physics.\n\nNear the southern wall of Stadtfriedhof cemetery in G√∂ttingen in an open-air round structure, the Nobel Rondell honours eight Nobel Prize laureates: Max Born, Otto Hahn, Max von Laue, Walther Nernst, Max Planck, Otto Wallach, Adolf Windaus, and Richard Zsigmondy. The Nobel Rondel was designed by Hans Otto Arnold and unveiled to the public in 2006; a description of the ‚ÄúNobelrondell‚Äù in German is provided here. The eight Nobel Prize laureates have their own respective (red) plaques in the round, and there‚Äôs room for more in the future. Each plaque provides in German a short history of each laureate and their contributions. Gravestones for each of the laureates are in various spots throughout the cemetery.\n\nFrom the heady days of undergraduate physics, I remember the impact of having learned the contributions by Planck and Born to quantum-physics and -mechanics, and by von Laue to solid-state physics.\n\nBack to list\n\nMax Born\n\nMax Born (1882‚Äì1970) shared the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics with Walther Bothe (1891-1957). Born was lauded for ‚Äúhis fundamental research in quantum mechanics, especially for his statistical interpretation of the wavefunction‚Äù:\n\nIn Niels Bohr‚Äôs theory of the atom, electrons absorb and emit radiation of fixed wavelengths when jumping between orbits around a nucleus. Bohr‚Äôs theory provided a good description of the spectrum created by the hydrogen atom, but needed much more to describe spectra from heavier atoms and molecules. Following Werner Heisenberg‚Äôs initial work around 1925, Max Born contributed to further development of quantum mechanics, and also proved that Erwin Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs wave equation could be interpreted as giving statistical (rather than exact) predictions of physical variables.\n\nOn Born‚Äôs gravestone is an equation which may look odd; for me, the innocuous-looking equation was a dramatic change in thinking. In classical mechanics, p and q represent macroscopic quantities for momentum and position, respectively, which means the equation [p,q] = pq-qp is equal to zero. The quantum mechanics version of this equation, however, is not equal to zero. In quantum mechanics, the Born commutator with momentum-operator P and position-operator Q acting on wavefunctions is written as:\n\nThis ‚Äúquantum condition‚Äù with a very small but non-zero value points to the development of Heisenberg‚Äôs uncertainty principle.\n\n(Max Born was the maternal grandfather of English-Australian actor and singer Olivia Newton-John.)\n\nBack to list\n\nOtto Hahn\n\nOtto Hahn (1879‚Äì1968) was awarded the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the experimental discovery of induced nuclear fission of heavy elements. After absorbing a thermal neutron, a uranium atom splits apart into fast-moving lighter elements, a small number of free neutrons, and gamma-ray radiation.\n\nThe discovery of the neutron in 1932 provided a powerful new tool for investigating atoms. When Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman irradiated uranium with neutrons in 1939, they created barium, which was far too light an element to be a decay product of uranium. Otto Hahn‚Äôs long-time colleague, Lise Meitner, and her nephew, Otto Frisch, tackled the problem from a theoretical standpoint and proved that the uranium nucleus had been split. This phenomenon called ‚Äúfission‚Äù proved to be a critical step in the development of atomic weapons and nuclear energy.\n\nLise Meitner should also have been credited with the Nobel Prize for her work and contributions to the discovery; see this Brain Pickings post.\n\nBack to list\n\nMax von Laue\n\nMax von Laue (1879‚Äì1960) was awarded the 1914 Nobel Prize in Physics ‚Äúfor his discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by crystals‚Äù:\n\nA phenomenon known as ‚Äúdiffraction‚Äù occurs when light waves pass through small, tightly spaced openings in a screen. In 1912, Max von Laue came upon the idea that X-rays passing through crystals might create similar patterns; the crystal‚Äôs structure would act like openings in a screen. With subseequent confirmation, experiments demonstrated that X-ray radiation could also be described as waves and that diffraction patterns could be used to determine the structures of crystals.\n\nWith the discovery of ‚ÄúR√∂ntgen rays‚Äù or X-rays by Wilhelm R√∂ntgen (for which he would be awarded the 1901 Nobel Prize in Physics), von Laue‚Äôs work was the early development of crystallography which is the study of the structure and properties of crystals.\n\nBack to list\n\nWalther Nernst\n\nWalther Nernst (1864‚Äì1941) was awarded the 1920 Nobel Prize in Chemistry ‚Äúin recognition of his work in thermochemistry‚Äù:\n\n‚ÄúDuring chemical reactions, atoms and molecules regroup and form new organized clusters. In most cases chemical reactions are not complete without an ensuing chemical equilibrium that depends on the temperature. In almost all chemical reactions heat is released or absorbed. In 1912 Nernst was able to formulate the Third Law of Thermodynamics to calculate chemical equilibria on the basis of heat exchange by studying conditions and reactions at very low temperatures.‚Äù\n\nBack to list\n\nMax Planck\n\nMax Planck (1858‚Äì1947) was awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics ‚Äúin recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta‚Äù:\n\nWhen a blackbody is heated, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the blackbody has a spectrum corresponding to the temperature of the blackbody and not to its composition. Calculating the form of the spectrum using then-known physical laws gave an unreasonable result called the ‚Äúultraviolet catastrophe‚Äù; radiation at high-frequencies became infinite. Planck solved this problem in 1900 by introducing the theory of ‚Äúlight quanta‚Äù; that radiation consists of discrete ‚Äúpackets‚Äù with specific energies determined by a new fundamental constant called Planck‚Äôs constant.\n\nWhat Planck determined was massive to physics:\n\n‚Ä¢ In 1905, Albert Einstein hypothesized that radiation with energy, E, was directly proportional to frequency, f, with the Planck constant, h as proportionality constant:\n\nUsing this hypothesis, Einstein predicted the photoelectric effect which was verified in 1914-1916 experiments by Robert Millikan. For the photoelectric effect, Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, and Millikan was awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\n‚Ä¢ The Planck law of blackbody radiation is an equation determining the spectral energy density of radiation emission at every wavelength for a specified temperature; see here and here. Using this equation, the first estimates of the value of h were derived with experimental data on blackbody radiation at the time.\n\n‚Ä¢ The term ‚Äúphoton‚Äù referring to an individual quantum or packet of light was coined in 1926 by chemist Gilbert N. Lewis.\n\nInscribed at the bottom of Planck‚Äôs stone marker is the value of the Planck constant:\n\nThe constant is a very small number, and the physical units are Watt times seconds squared, or Joule times seconds. Why the constant is labeled h and not p might be left as an exercise to the reader.\n\nYears later, I would have the privilege of working as a research scientist for a short time at an astronomy institute and the foundation, both of which bear Planck‚Äôs name.\n\nBack to list\n\nOtto Wallach\n\nOtto Wallach (1847‚Äì1931) was awarded the 1910 Nobel Prize in Chemistry ‚Äúin recognition of his services to organic chemistry and the chemical industry by his pioneer work in the field of alicyclic compounds‚Äù:\n\nTerpenes are a large and varied group of hydrocarbon compounds existing in many fragrant substances found in nature, including turpentine and other essential oils. In the 1880s Wallach studied these substances and developed methods for extracting different terpenes from mixtures. He showed many substances were mixtures of a small number of terpenes and terpenes could be altered from one to another. Wallach‚Äôs work became significant within the chemical industry where essential oils are used in perfume and food.\n\nBack to list\n\nAdolf Windaus\n\nAdolf Windaus (1876‚Äì1959) was awarded the 1928 Nobel Prize in Chemistry ‚Äúfor the services rendered through his research into the constitution of the sterols and their connection with the vitamins‚Äù:\n\nCholesterol is an important component in the body‚Äôs cells and plays a major role in several biochemical processes. During the 1920s Windaus studied the composition of cholesterol and closely related substances called sterols, and established the sterols‚Äô relationship with bilic acids. Windaus also found that another sterol, ergosterol, had the ability to cure rickets, a disease caused by vitamin-D deficiency and characterized by bone weakness. He was able to show vitamin D formed out of ergosterol under the influence of ultraviolet light.\n\nBack to list\n\nRichard Zsigmondy\n\nRichard Zsigmondy (1865‚Äì1929) was born in Vienna; obtained his doctorate in chemistry from the University of Erlangen in 1889; and became Professor and Director at the University of G√∂ttingen‚Äôs Institute for organic chemistry from 1909 to 1929. He was awarded the 1925 Nobel Prize in Chemistry ‚Äúfor his demonstration of the heterogenous nature of colloid solutions and for the methods he used, which have since become fundamental in modern colloid chemistry‚Äù:\n\nIn chemistry, very small particles which are finely dispersed in another substance are called colloids. Colloid particles can be so small that they cannot be observed in a regular microscope; that is, the sizes of colloid particles can be smaller than visual wavelengths*. In 1902 Zsigmondy helped develop the ultramicroscope which uses light scattering; the viewing angle is perpendicular to the direction of illumination. Zsigmondy used the ultramicroscope to show the heterogeneous structure of colloids which contain very small particles with a range of sizes.\n\nBack to list\n\nDirections\n\nFrequent express and regional trains stop in G√∂ttingen on the corridor between Hannover and Kassel. From G√∂ttingen Hauptbahnhof (main train station), walk from the station to stop ‚ÄúBahnhof/ZOB‚Äù to catch bus 61 (direction ‚ÄúHetjershausen‚Äù) or bus 62 (direction ‚ÄúGro√ü Ellershausen‚Äù) for the 5-minute ride to stop ‚ÄúStadtfriedhof‚Äù. From bus stop ‚ÄúMarkt‚Äù in the city centre, catch bus 31 (direction ‚ÄúKauf Park‚Äù), bus 32 (direction ‚ÄúKauf Park‚Äù), bus 61 (direction ‚ÄúHetjershausen‚Äù), or bus 62 (direction Gro√ü Ellershausen) for the 6-minute ride to stop ‚ÄúStadtfriedhof.‚Äù The local transport authority is the G√∂VB G√∂ttinger Verkehrsbetriebe.\n\nBack to list\n\n* Visual-light or -radiation is typically in the wavelength range 400 to 800 nanometres (0.4 to 0.8 micrometres). Human eyes are most sensitive to light at 555 nanometres (‚Äúgreen‚Äù) under average daylight conditions."
