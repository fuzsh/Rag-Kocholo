He always preferred the term X-rays – from the mathematical designation for something unknown – as no one understood what these remarkable rays actually were.\n\nResearchers worldwide could experiment on X-rays as Röntgen refused to patent his findings, convinced that his inventions and discoveries belonged to the world at large. X-ray radiation became a powerful tool for physical experiments and examining the body's interior.\n\nThe first Nobel Prize in Physics 1901 was awarded to Röntgen for his discovery of these \"remarkable rays\".\n\nIllustration: Ola Skogäng. \n\n#NobelPrize #physics\".",
