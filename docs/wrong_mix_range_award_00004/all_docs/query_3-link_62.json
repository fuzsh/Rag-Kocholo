        "text": "On my list and map, I placed the museum‚Äôs location as a ‚Äúpossible‚Äù to visit in the city. If I had time, I‚Äôd swing by and have a look, appealing to my fondness for science and the history of science.\n\nMany arrive in W√ºrzburg to visit the Residenz UNESCO world heritage site. On a daytrip from Frankfurt am Main, I duly visited the Residenz, and easily completed my initial visit requirements, as I knew I would. That‚Äôs when my inner voice (a.k.a., the spirit of B.Sc. ‚Äô90) reminded me insistently the museum was ‚Äúsimply and conveniently‚Äù on the return walk to the city‚Äôs central train station to fully complete my visit requirements.\n\nI walked north from the Residenz, and followed the signs into the building for the R√∂ntgen-Ged√§chtnisst√§tte (R√∂ntgen Memorial) where X-rays were discovered. Standing inside the former laboratory space, I‚Äôm surrounded by artifacts, books, papers, tubes, equipment, and photographs.\n\nI also feel a part of my undergraduate physics education has come full circle.\n\nThe X Factor\n\nIn 1895, Dr. Wilhelm Conrad R√∂ntgen was physicist on staff with the Institute of Physics at the University of W√ºrzburg. R√∂ntgen carried out experiments to study cathode rays (negatively-charged electrons) using various kinds of cathode tubes which were readily available at the time. A cathode or negative terminal and an anode or positive terminal are fused within a glass tube that is evacuated or filled with a rarefied gas. With the two terminals connected in a high-voltage electrical circuit, the cathode is heated and electrons generated from the cathode race to the anode. The experimental apparatus was lightly shielded with black cardboard, but R√∂ntgen noticed barium platinocyanide screens placed about 3 metres from the apparatus emitted a faint green glow. Further tests revealed the glow or fluorescence was caused by a previously unknown kind of radiation emanating from the apparatus, penetrating through the glass and cardboard, before striking the light-sensitive screens farther away. R√∂ntgen deduced the new radiation was produced from inside the glass tubes: high-speed electrons striking the metal anode was producing highly energetic ‚Äúrays‚Äù. For simplicity, he called the new radiation ‚ÄúX-rays‚Äù (‚ÄúX-Strahlen‚Äù) to distinguish the finding simply from other known types of rays.\n\nR√∂tgen‚Äôs discovery date was 8 November 1895, and things from here progressed quickly.\n\n‚Ä¢ 22 December 1895: he produced one of the world‚Äôs first X-ray image: the left hand of his wife, Anna Ludwig R√∂ntgen. With shock upon seeing the image, she reportedly said: ‚ÄúI have seen my death‚Äú.\n\n‚Ä¢ 28 December 1895: R√∂ntgen submitted to the Physical-Medical Society of W√ºrzburg a manuscript titled, ‚ÄúOn A New Type of Rays (Preliminary Communication)‚Äù, describing experiments and discovery.\n\n‚Ä¢ 31 December 1895: The manuscript was published within the 1895 annual report for the Physical-Medical Society of W√ºrzburg.\n\n‚Ä¢ 23 January 1896: Upon invitation by the Society, R√∂ntgen gave his only public lecture about his discovery. During the lecture, R√∂ntgen produced an X-ray image of anatomist Albert von K√∂lliker‚Äôs left hand. Amazed by what he saw, K√∂lliker suggested the new rays be named ‚ÄúR√∂ntgen rays‚Äù to which the lecture audience responded with enthusiastic applause.\n\n‚Ä¢ February 1896: Eder and Valenta published a book with various X-ray images to show the world the utility of these ‚Äúnew rays‚Äù and to show what kinds of objects were opaque or transparent to the rays.\n\n‚Ä¢ R√∂ntgen chose not to patent his finding, allowing others to experiment and explore. By 1896, X-rays had already found uses in the medical community; e.g., diagnosis of broken bones, preliminary treatment of cancer, radiography of blood vessels (angiography).\n\n‚Ä¢ 12 November 1901: The Nobel Society awarded to R√∂ntgen the first-ever Nobel Prize in Physics for the groundbreaking discovery. By this point, R√∂ntgen and his family had already been at the University of Munich for a year.\n\nIt‚Äôs very easy to take for granted how important an role X-rays plays in contemporary society; medical imaging is an obvious and critical diagnostic tool in modern medicine. With the discovery at the end of the 19th-century, the ‚Äúnew‚Äù X-rays meant a whole new way of looking forward into the 20th-century, particularly looking ‚Äúinside‚Äù objects without invasive rupture or unnecessary damage. What are ‚ÄúX-rays‚Äù in the English-speaking world are called ‚ÄúR√∂ntgen rays‚Äù (R√∂ntgenstrahlen, R√∂ntgenstrahlung) in the German-speaking world.\n\nR√∂ntgen Memorial in W√ºrzburg\n\nThe 1878 building at R√∂ntgenring 8 once housed R√∂ntgen‚Äôs laboratory within the former Institute of Physics as part of the old University of W√ºrzburg. The building survived for the most part bombing during World War 2, and underwent reconstruction in the late-1970s for present-day use by the University of Applied Sciences W√ºrzburg-Schweinfurt. The non-profit registered association R√∂ntgenkuratorium W√ºrzburg e.V. coordinated and built a memorial where X-rays were discovered. The R√∂ntgen-Ged√§chtnisst√§tte (R√∂ntgen Memorial) opened in 1985, and the association updated the memorial in 2015. The European Physical Society (EPS) recognized the R√∂ntgen memorial as an ‚ÄúEPS Historic Site‚Äù in 2016.\n\n8-minute video in English about the R√∂ntgen Memorial, by R√∂ntgenkuratorium W√ºrzburg e.V (1990).\n\nR√∂ntgen report, 1895\n\nR√∂ntgen, W.
