        "text": "The discovery of the x-ray marks the start of medical imagery for diagnostic purposes. The ability to look inside a living body revolutionized the way we look at medicine and human anatomy. To cite an example: in the former German Empire, up to 120,000 people died of tuberculosis by the end of the nineteenth century. Mass x-ray examinations, which were in part mandatory until 1983, played a crucial part in the identification and control of this illness. Nowadays it is difficult to imagine arriving at a diagnosis without any pictorial evidence of the medical findings.\n\nLife expectancy is increasing worldwide due to better nutrition and improved medical care. However, a new “Anthropocene” sickness is becoming a problem: obesity. In OECD countries, every second person is overweight; every sixth person is obese."
