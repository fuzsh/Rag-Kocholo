        "text": "Nobel was a chemist, engineer, inventor, and entrepreneur who held 355 patents and is best known for his discovery of dynamite. In his will, Nobel specified that his fortune was to be dedicated to prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace “to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.” In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank, Sweden’s central bank, established the prize in economic sciences in memory of Nobel. The first Nobel Prize was awarded to Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, in 1901, for his discovery of X-rays.​​​​​​\n\n​​​​The award ceremonies are held annually on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death, in the Swedish capital, Stockholm. The Nobel Peace Prize award takes place in the Norwegian capital, Oslo. The Nobel Prize continues to encourage scientists, researchers, writers, and peace advocates in their work. The Nobel Prize is broadly considered to be the most prestigious award in the world."
