        "text": "This year's Nobel prize in physics has been awarded to two researchers for their work with light and matter at the most fundamental level.\n\nSerge Haroche of France and David Wineland of the US will share the prize, worth 8m Swedish kronor (Â£750,000; $1.2m).\n\nTheir \"quantum optics\" work on single photons and charged atoms has opened up a whole new field of study in physics.\n\nIt could lead to advanced modes of communication and computation.\n\nThe Nobel citation, external said the award was for \"ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems\".\n\nLight and matter, when the minuscule scales of single particles are reached, behave in surprising ways in a part of physics known as quantum mechanics.\n\nWorking with light and matter on this level would have been unthinkable before the pair developed solutions to pick, manipulate and measure photons and ions individually, allowing an insight into a microscopic world that was once just the province of scientific theory.\n\nTheir work has implications for light-based clocks far more precise than the atomic clocks at the heart of the world's business systems, and quantum computing, which may - or may not - revolutionise desktop computing as we know it.\n\nBut for physicists, the import of the pair's techniques is outlined in a layman's summary on the Nobel site, external: they preserve the delicate quantum mechanical states of the photons and ions - states that theorists had for decades hoped to measure in the laboratory, putting the ideas of quantum mechanics on a solid experimental footing.\n\nThose include the slippery quantum mechanical ideas of entanglement - the seemingly ethereal connection between two distant particles that underpins much work on the \"uncrackable codes\" of quantum cryptography - and of decoherence, in which the quantum nature of a particle slowly slips away through its interactions with other matter.\n\nThe prize is the second in quantum optics in recent years; the theory behind decoherence formed part of 2005's Nobel physics prize citation, external.\n\n\"I was walking with my wife going back home and when I saw the... Swedish code, I realised it was real and it's, you know, really overwhelming.\"\n\nProf Sir Peter Knight of the UK's Institute of Physics, said: \"Haroche and Wineland have made tremendous advances in our understanding of quantum entanglement, with beautiful experiments to show how atomic systems can be manipulated to exhibit the most extraordinary coherence properties.\"\n\nThe Nobel prizes have been given out annually since 1901, covering the fields of medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, peace and economics.\n\nSpeculation had been rife, in light of the discovery of the Higgs boson announced in July, that Peter Higgs or his colleagues may have been in the running for the prize, but historically the prizes tend to honour discoveries after a period of years.\n\nThe first-ever Nobel prize in physics was awarded to Wilhelm Roentgen of Germany for his discovery of X-rays, and with this year's winners the total number of recipients has reached 194.\n\nOn Monday, the 2012 prize for medicine or physiology was awarded to John Gurdon from the UK and Shinya Yamanaka from Japan for changing adult cells into stem cells, which can become any other type of cell in the body.\n\nThis year's chemistry prize will be announced on Wednesday, with the literature and peace prizes to be awarded later in the week."
