        "text": "Biography\n\nBorn on March 27, 1845 in Lennep, Germany\n\n1862 – Expelled from technical school in Utrecht, Netherlands\n\n1865-1869 Completed PhD at the University of Zurich. Thesis: Studien über Gase [Studies on gases]\n\n1870 – Appointed assistant to prominent physicist August Kundt (1839-1894); moved to Würzburg with him\n\n1872 – Married Bertha Ludwig with whom he fathered no children. The pair adopted a daughter\n\n1874 – Lecturer at the university of Strasbourg\n\n1879 – Chair of physics at the university of Giessen\n\n1888 – Chair of physics at the university of Würzburg\n\n1895 – Studied cathode rays, leading to the discovery of X-rays on November 8, 1895 and the first human radiograph (the hand of his wife, Bertha) on December 22, 1895 – ‘Hand mit Ringen‘\n\n1896 – Published his findings as Ueber eine neue Art von Strahlen [On a new type of rays]\n\n1900 – Chair of Physics at the university of Munich, where he remained the rest of his life\n\n1901 – Received the first ever Nobel Prize in Physics. Röntgen donated the 50,000 Swedish krona reward for research research at the University of Würzburg.\n\nAwards: Rumford Medal (1896); Matteucci Medal (1896); Elliott Cresson Medal (1897); Barnard Medal for Meritorious Service to Science (1900); Nobel Prize for Physics (1901);\n\nDied on February 10, 1923 from colorectal cancer. All his personal and scientific correspondence was destroyed after his death in accordance with his will.\n\nMedical Eponyms\n\nRöntgen rays (1895)\n\nRöntgen made a ground-breaking discovery which would change the landscape of clinical medicine forever the Röntgen rays, or X-rays.\n\nRöntgen’s discovery was based on cathode rays, which had been the subject of investigation by fellow physicists Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894) and Philipp Lenard (1862-1947). Cathode rays became the centre of attention of research in the latter half of the 19th century, when the photoelectric effect was first demonstrated, by passing a high voltage through a vacuum-pumped tube with a heated filament.\n\nOn November 8th 1895, Röntgen was experimenting with cathode rays, and sealed one such discharge tube in a cardboard box. On passing current through the tube, he noticed that a nearby plate covered on the one side with barium platinocyanide was lighting up fluorescently. The cardboard box was completely impenetrable to light, and so Röntgen hypothesized that another type of ray, termed X-ray, must be emitted.\n\nThis discovery took the scientific and medical world by storm. Within weeks X-rays were being applied to both diagnostic and therapeutic medicine. The speed with which this ‘new discovery’ was taken up is quite astonishing. In an age without social media, smartphones and live-streaming; news of the discovery rapidly spanned the globe.\n\n\"Is it light?\" \"No.\" \"Is it electricity?\" \"Not in any known form.\" \"What is it?\" \"I don't know.\" And the discoverer of the X rays thus stated as calmly his ignorance of their essence as has everybody else who has written on the phenomena thus far. Röntgen. Interview with HJW Dam April 1896: 413\n\n1896 – In June, six months after Röntgen’s discovery, Leopold Freund (1868–1943) of the University of Vienna effected the first cure of skin cancer in a 5 year-old patient by means of X-rays generated by a Hittorf tube\n\n1905 – The German radiological society [Deutsche Röntgengesellschaft eV] was founded by Heinrich Albers-Schönberg\n\nOther eponyms\n\nRöntgenbild: the German term for “X-ray film” to this day\n\nRöntgengesellschaft: the German radiological society\n\nRöntgen unit: the original measure of radiation exposure; now replaced by the Gray unit\n\n6401 Röntgen: an asteroid measuring 7.9km discovered in 1991. Takes 1600 days to orbit the sun\n\nICE 884 Röntgen: German high-speed train involved in a de-railing accident killing 101 people. The name was removed following the accident\n\nRoentgenium (2004): Synthetic chemical element with symbol Rg and atomic number 111 created in 1994 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research and eponymously attributed to Wilhelm Röntgen by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 2004\n\nControversies\n\nRöntgen, who today is widely described in literature as a modest man, more intereseted in his scientific enquiries than in the publicity that was associated with them, was despised by fellow german physicist Philip Lenard. Though it is recognized that Röntgen used a Hittorf-style vacuum tube on the night of his famous discovery, Lenard claimed that the discovery was made with one of his own tube designs.\n\nLenard himself was an early member of the Nazi party, and a staunch anti-semite, central in the purging of the german scientist field of Jews (including the likes of Einstein). Röntgen, though not Jewish, was considered to have been friendly to Jews, and as such the Third Reich assigned credit for the discovery of X-rays to Lenard.\n\nThere were however some key differences in the experimental setup between the two colleagues, which meant that Röntgen was correctly attributed the eponymous discovery. Lenard, hoping to demonstrate the photographic effects of cathode rays, used a tube wrapped in zinc (relatively impermeable to X-rays), and a plate coated in keton (inorganic substance which does not fluoresce in the presence of X-rays).\n\nRöntgen on the other hand chose his setup to be with a cardboard casing, and a Barium Platinocyanide (organic substance) plate- reportedly as he was still waiting on the arrival of his order of keton! This difference however meant, that the subtle X-rays emitted were able to penetrate the cardboard casing, and cause the plate to fluoresce!\n\nMajor Publications\n\nRöntgen WC.
