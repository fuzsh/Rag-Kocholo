The Adventures of Abney & Teal is a British-Canadian mildly surreal children's television programme which uses a mixture of 2D and CGI animation based on the works of writer and illustrator Joel Stewart. The show, which follows the adventures of two friends, is set on a series of small islands on a lake in a park in an unnamed city. The show was first broadcast on CBeebies in the United Kingdom in September 2011, and is produced by Ragdoll Productions.
