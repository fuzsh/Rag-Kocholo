        "text": "Top of the list is The Clangers - absolutely perfect children’s television. Gentle and imaginative, the Clangers inhabit a world which kids immediately respond to and their whistling language is amazingly comprehensible. There’s often a moral to each tale in the new series narrated by Michael Palin, pitched at an ideal level for younger children. “Everyone worked together, so that everyone could be together.” The 2015 stories are written by Daniel Postgate, the son of Oliver Postgate - the creator of the original series plus other gems from the 50s through to the 70s such as Noggin the Nog, Ivor the Engine and Bagpuss. Oh, to have the imagination to create such fantastic stories for children.\n\n2. The Adventures of Abney and Teal\n\nAgain a gentle show, and mildly surreal. I enjoy the dynamic between the pair of animated rag dolls. Abney (the male character) is often anxious and provides porridge for everyone, meanwhile Teal (the female character) is adventurous, energetic and excitable. Together they invent brilliant games, often helped by Bop - a gender neutral creature who lives in the lake. Even though in one episode Bop has babies it isn’t entirely clear s/he is female. Interesting. Music is provided by Toby Dog, who always plays the same song - but that same song can be any kind of music you like. Incredibly, this isn’t irritating and it’s a good reflection of how kids play.\n\n3. Hey Duggee\n\nHey Duggee is a favourite in our family - my husband has been known to watch an episode on his own in the evening; “Have you seen The River Badge - it’s Apocalypse Now?” This Bafta award winning series is written by comedians so there are jokes aplenty for grown ups, without those jokes crowding out the funniness for kids. Character-wise, I feel it always helps when they’re animals…. somehow you can identify with all of them without thinking ‘boy/girl’ so strongly. But thumbs up here for characters who include a clever girl who wants to know everything about everything (octopus Betty), a whimsical boy who wears glasses and loves splashing (crocodile Happy - who lives with his adoptive elephant parents by the way) and a gentle rhino called Tag. It’s a completely brilliant show which provides real laughs - so important for kids, especially maybe those quiet children who need an outlet for their feelings and may not get to dissipate them through wild play.\n\n4. Maddie’s Do You Know?\n\nWe have only just been introduced to this excellent show, but it’s set to become a regular. Presenter Maddie explains how things work and how they’re made - from day turning to night, to cranes, crayons, and popcorn. Animations are mixed in with Maddie’s smiley explanations, alongside lots of clever cameras. It’s pitched at a good level for any child over four I think. My children were transfixed and I learnt some new facts too - bonus. I suspect that from now on, when I’m asked “How does it work?” I will often be turning to Maddie for help….\n\n5. Apple Tree House\n\nLive action children’s shows can often be a little weird/stilted/unfunny but this is a good one. Filmed on the real Devons Estate in East London, the cast of children were drawn from auditions from the local area, and it feels like a rarity in that the characters and their world will be recognised by many children who live in diverse neighbourhoods in towns and cities. The positive focus on friendships and neighbours on an inner city estate is sadly still an unusual view - hopefully programmes like this will change that.\n\nKatharine Bosman lives in London and is the mother of two children. She spent ten years working for a social justice campaigning organisation, and is energised by where parenthood is taking her."
