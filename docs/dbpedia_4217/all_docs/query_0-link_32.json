        "text": "Younger viewers will be charmed by the loveable antics of the Twirlywoos while the delightful humour will appeal to all age groups.\n\n— Kay Benbow, Controller, CBeebies\n\nSilly, fun and full of surprises, Twirlywoos is made by children’s TV specialists Ragdoll Productions and devised by Anne Wood (Teletubbies, In the Night Garden, The Adventures Of Abney And Teal) and Steve Roberts (Dipdap) and is narrated by Linda Bassett. Combining stop-frame animation and live action sequences set in the real world, the series uses fun and laughter to encourage pre-schoolers to think for themselves and gain confidence in their perceptions of the world.\n\n“The team at Ragdoll has produced a show that is brilliantly funny and entertaining, but underpinned with a strong educational element,” says CBeebies Controller Kay Benbow. “Younger viewers will be charmed by the loveable antics of the Twirlywoos while the delightful humour will appeal to all age groups.”\n\n“Television that makes children smile is so valuable and I’m proud to be part of CBeebies’ wonderful tradition of making children, and parents, smile,” says Ragdoll’s Anne Wood. “Twirlywoos is the latest in a long line of distinctive programming from Ragdoll and we hope it is imbued with the same sense of fun as its predecessors.”\n\nIn close collaboration with Early Years specialist Professor Cathy Nutbrown, Twirlywoos explores a different age appropriate concept in each episode, such as ‘over’, ‘underneath’ and ‘through’.\n\nTwirlywoos is produced by Ragdoll Productions in association with DHX Media. The producer is Chris Wood, lead creative Steve Roberts and is devised and executive produced by Anne Wood. Michael Towner is the executive producer for CBeebies. The stop frame animation has been produced by leading UK animation studio Mackinnon and Saunders."
