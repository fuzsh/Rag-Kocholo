        "text": "Abbey Home Media is releasing The Adventures of Abney and Teal â€“ Faraway Island on 9th September 2013. Ms C and Mr K miss a lot of their favourite shows now that they are both in school full time. So they were both over the moon when I gave them the disc!\n\nIt is about two animated rag dolls named Abney and Teal who live in a park, in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the big city. Abney lives in a hut at the base of a tree. Teal sleeps in the branches of the tree. They share their island home with a group of friendly and hilarious characters, and together they are always ready for an adventure.\n\nMy children love both main characters as they are funny and always having a lot of fun adventures. This DVD comes with stickers and Ms C started pasting them on her face to be silly. Mr K is so happy to watch it and constantly laughs at their silly actions. There are 8 episodes from series 1. This show is aimed at 3 to 6 years old. Each episode lasts about 11 minutes which is seems like an appropriate length of time. My children totally enjoy it. It is not much of an educational program but more like a relaxing and fun short show to watch for the kids. As a parent, I would buy this DVD, as it helps to relax the children after a long day in school.\n\nDisclosure: We received the sample for the purposes of writing this review, however, all thoughts and opinions remain our own."
