        "text": "I've been thinking about doing a top 10 list of my own since those seem to go over well, but haven't known what to start. My kids just gave me the idea for this one! These aren't necessarily listed in order of popularity, but are definitely the top ten preferred. This show is a recent discovery at our house; we found it while we had a free week's trial of Starz. We didn't keep the channel, but the littlest two loved the show. Currently they've been watching episodes of it off of YouTube until we can find an alternative. We're hoping to try out the Brit Box package soon, and I hope it's also on there. This is a cute and gentle show from the BBC (more specifically their children's channel, CBeebies) about a corduroy cat (I think?) named Abney and a ragdoll named Teal who live on an island in a community park. Also on the island is a creature named Neep (who appears to be a turnip), a furry manatee-like creature named Bop (who blows bubbles and drinks lake water out of a china teacup), and several differently sized wooden comma-shaped creatures called Poc-pocs. There's also accordion-playing Toby Dog, who always plays the same cheerful little tune for a multitude of occasions. This program isn't overly stimulating, which I appreciate (especially in the evenings) and has a nostalgic feel."
