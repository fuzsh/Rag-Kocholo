        "text": "CBeebies is the brand used by the BBC for programming aimed at encouraging \"learning through play in a consistently safe environment for children aged 6 or under\" and providing \"high quality, mostly UK-produced programmes\".\n\nThe name is used to brand the free-to-air domestic British channel, and is used for international variants supported by advertising, subscription or both. The channel was first launched on 11 February 2002.\n\nThe channel has won a number of awards. At the BAFTA Children's Awards, it won awards in 2002 and in every year between 2004 and 2009, including \"Best Pre-school Live Action Series\" in 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2008. It has also won \"Best Schools Programme – 0–6 years\" awards (or equivalent) from the Royal Television Society from 2002 to 2005. CBeebies is one of the most watched channels in the UK. CBeebies HD officially launched on 10 December 2013.\n\nHistory[]\n\nthe CBeebies channel was launched with CBBC, on 11 February 2002. The domestic CBeebies channel broadcasts from 6am to 7pm each day - a result of the channel sharing bandwidth with the channel BBC Four on the Freeview platform. The station was joined later on by an audio counterpart, CBeebies Radio, which broadcast for three hours each day on the radio station BBC Radio 7, however since the station was rebranded as BBC Radio 4 Extra this obligation has ceased. Later on they launched a weekly publication 'CBeebies Weekly'.\n\nSince 27 March 2013, CBeebies has been carried by the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS), sharing a channel with BFBS Extra.\n\nThe international CBeebies channel is advert-free and wholly owned by BBC Worldwide. The first international launch for the CBeebies channel was in India in May 2007, although the channel was withdrawn at the end of November 2012 due to \"commercial considerations\".\n\nThe channel is available in the Republic of Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong, Poland, Indonesia, Mexico, Africa, Australia and the United States (in Spanish only). In March 2011, the on demand version of the network was launched in the US and is available on Xfinity.\n\nManagement[]\n\nIn the UK, CBeebies is operated by the BBC Children's division and part of BBC North. The division is also responsible for CBBC and overall strategic responsibility for all of the BBC's domestic services for children rests with the Director of Children's, Joe Godwin (since late 2009). The direction of the domestic CBeebies channel itself rests with Kay Benbow, the current Controller of the channel and responsible for commissioning all CBeebies content across BBC television, online, interactive TV, and radio. She took over from the first controller Michael Carrington in 2010.\n\nInternationally, CBeebies is owned by BBC Worldwide, who operate the brand.\n\nProgramming[]\n\nLittle Kids offers a mix of mostly UK-produced entertainment and educational output designed to encourage learning through play. These goals are realised through a range of programmes about simple science, natural history, music and movement, storytelling, make up and make do, puzzle programmes and animation. The channel's schedule is deliberately the same every weekday, with a different schedule at weekends, so that children can know what is on instinctively. The schedule also includes signed programmes, shown in the UK between 14:00 and 17:00 on weekends.\n\n64 Zoo Lane\n\nYoko! Jakamoko! Toto!

Each week, your little ones will have a chance to learn a dance move, a new skill, learn fun facts, make a craft or Watch Cartoons. Best of all, you and your little ones can join in the club by sending in your pictures and videos, which may be featured on the show or in our online galleries. We want to see all of the fun things you and your family will be doing this summer. It’s the club that never closes!\n\nThe Let's Go Club Cartoons\n\nMonday: Fireman Sam: What Goes Up, Oakie Doke and the Treasure Hunt and Pingu's Hide and Seek\n\nTuesday: Noddy and His Money, Spider's Song and Hairy Jeremy: The Big Fight\n\nWednesday: Philbert Frog and the Dinosaur, Charlie Chalk: The Mountain that Moaned and Funnybones: Shake, Rattle and Roll\n\nThursday: William's Wish Wellingtons: Ancient William, Monty the Dog Goes to School and The Little Polar Bear: The Mission\n\nFriday: Postman Pat Follows a Trail, Barney's Treasure Hunt and The Raggy Dolls: When in Rome\n\nFuture Generations[]\n\nFuture Generations: Small People was a charity programme for Children in Need, put together by the BBC in 1998 as a sort of sequel to the great success of the previous year's Perfect Day charity single.\n\nThe programme was dedicated to the BBC's vast output of children's programmes and featured five-year-old Scott Chisholm, dressed in 1950s-style school uniform, walking round various children's programmes past and present, sometimes interacting with the characters. It was first shown on 1 December 1998, within the Children in Need charity programme.\n\nThe promotion was not meant to be like Perfect Day, but instead reminding the viewers of what their license fee was paying for. The following year, a similar promotion was created entitled Shaggy Dog Story. This promotion featured a collection of BBC comedians and was used to represent the diverse range of comedic output.\n\nThere are many popular children’s programmes featured in the Future Generations trail. To refresh your memory, or to be introduced to characters you have never met before, here is more detailed information on the original programmes, and their characters.\n\nThe Best BBC Children's TV Characters - Ever![]\n\nThe Lowry called Here's one we Made Earlier, which tells the story of the BBC's children's television broadcasting over the past 90 years and the vote between classic characters such as Bagpuss, Postman Pat, Teletubbies, Bob the Builder and Rastamouse.\n\nFrom the earliest children’s programmes of the small screen, Muffin The Mule, Andy Pandy and Bill and Ben; through the iconic programmes of the 60s and 70s, The Magic Roundabout, The Clangers and Mr Benn; the worldwide success stories of Bob the Builder and the Teletubbies; to the favourites of the new millennium, In the Night Garden and Shaun the Sheep; the shortlist will evoke memories and spark debate for every generation.\n\nBBC's children’s TV characters\n\nfrom Future Generations: Small People

In the UK, links are pre-recorded rather than broadcast live, as is the case on sister channel CBBC. They were originally pre recorded from studio TC0 at BBC Television Centre in London, however moved out in 2008 to Teddington Studios, and returned briefly in 2010. From September 2011, the links have been based at the BBC's Northern base at MediaCityUK in Salford, Manchester, following the move of the BBC Children's department there. International variants feature broadcast links produced either in the corresponding country, or from a central base.\n\nStorytimes[]\n\nWhile the lunchtime story is usually read by one of the regular presenters, the final show of each day, the \"Bedtime Story\" is read by a guest storyteller, including well known actors, comedians, and past presenters of BBC children's television. Some notable storytellers in this slot have included Simon Pegg, David Hasselhof, Lulu, Damian Lewis, and Floella Benjamin. In an unusual move, James Bolam appeared on \"Bedtime Story\" in costume and in character as Grandpa from Grandpa in My Pocket, not as himself.\n\nSongs[]\n\nThe UK channel utilises song and music as a presentational device, often using them to teach basic knowledge or to herald the start of a stranded segment:\n\nWhat's the Day?\n\nThe Bedtime Song\n\nThe Birthday Song\n\nOther ventures[]\n\nCBeebies website[]\n\nThe CBeebies website coincided with the launch of the UK channel in February 2002 and showcases a child friendly site with activities themed to all CBeebies programmes, past and present, with games, songs and print-outs featuring for nearly all shows. The UK version also features links to CBeebies iPlayer, a child friendly version of the BBC iPlayer featuring CBeebies programmes only, to CBeebies radio player and a dedicated micro site containing advice for raising children and toddlers called CBeebies Grown-ups, which was relaunched in 2011.\n\nFun Games\n\nNursery Rhyme Collage Maker\n\nSplat Art\n\nColour Mix Cottage\n\nAndy Pandy's Snap\n\nAngelmouse's Balloon Game\n\nVisit Balamory\n\nBarnaby Bear's Fairy Footprints\n\nPlay with Beebie\n\nBeebie's Farm Adventure\n\nLittle Cook's Snap Game\n\nBaking Bread Game\n\nBill and Ben's Hide and Seek\n\nBits and Bobs' Snap\n\nTrug along with Bits and Bobs\n\nApple Antics\n\nBoo's Puzzles\n\nFling a Fish\n\nBrum's Rescue the Gold\n\nCBeebies Screensaver\n\nClick-a-pic\n\nClifford's Tug of War Game\n\nCome Outside's Farm Game\n\nDotty's Snap\n\nSink or float\n\nGrow your tomatoes\n\nFimbles Hide and Seek\n\nBubble Paint\n\nHelp the Fimbles\n\nFireman Sam's Race Game\n\nKoala Brothers' Post Game\n\nLittle Robots' Fixing Game\n\nPainting Game\n\nPicture Perfect\n\nPostman Pat's Letterbox Trail Game\n\nRubbadubbers' Surfing Game\n\nThe Shiny Show Quiz\n\nLittle Bo Peep\n\nPainting Game\n\nAnimal Parade\n\nTubby Custard Bubbles\n\nHead, Shoulders, Knees and Toes\n\nWhat Tinky Winky took next\n\nWho spilled the Tubby Custard?\n\nHide-and-seek\n\nAnimal Sounds\n\nMusical Voice Trumpets\n\nSkip, March and Dance\n\nMagic Colouring\n\nLaa-Laa's Book\n\nWe all fall down\n\nNoo Noo Tidies Up\n\nTeletubby Jigsaws\n\nTikkabilla Jive\n\nTikkabilla's Clock Game\n\nTweenies Fancy Dress\n\nTweenie Submarine!\n\nGo Bat-Fizz!\n\nBella's stall\n\nDot-to-dot numbers!\n\nFetch and Spell\n\nPainting Game\n\nCounting Game\n\nTweenies Snap Game\n\nYoho Ahoy Music Fun\n\nStories\n\nAngelmouse's Favoruite Tale: The Lion and the Mouse (Narrated by Michael Underwood)\n\nBeebie and the Tortoise\n\nLittle Cook's Flower Fairy Story\n\nLittle Cook's Farmyard Story\n\nEeny Meeny Miny Moe\n\nThe Painting Elves\n\nThe Enormous Turnip\n\nThe Missing Pencil\n\nThe Butterfly Trail\n\nThe Wishing Tree\n\nNoddy's Favourite Tale: Jack and the Beanstalk (Narrated by Michael Underwood)\n\nOakie Doke's Favourite Tale: Robin Hood (Narrated by Michael Underwood)\n\nPaddington's Favourites Tale: Sleeping Beauty (Narrated by Angellica Bell)\n\nPostman Pat's favourite Tale: Cinderella (Narrated by Angellica Bell)\n\nKevin the Spaceman (Narrated by Nick Mercer)\n\nJackson's favourite Tale: The Blue Cow Story (Narrated by Nick Mercer)\n\nJelly's favourite Tale: Little Red Riding Hood (Narrated by Angellica Bell)\n\nStarship Tweenies!\n\nJangles the Clown\n\nDot-to-dotman\n\nPenelope Pink the Pop Princess!\n\nWebster's Story\n\nWilliam's Favourite Tale: The Three Little Pigs (Narrated by Bob Golding)\n\nBooty's Favourites Tale: The Princess and the Pea (Narrated by Sinead Rushe)\n\nPrint & Colour\n\nAlice, Archie, Buster, Frank, George, Josie, Mitzi, Ned, Penny and Sammy\n\nAndy Pandy, Looby Loo and Teddy\n\nAngelmouse, Flying Angelmouse, Angelmouse and his friend Quilly and Little Petal\n\nAnimals, Booty and Cutlass\n\nAquarium, Dot to Dot and Spot the Difference\n\nBaby Pom from Fimbles, Fimbo, The Fimbles and Florrie and Little one\n\nBack-To-Front, Lucy, Princess, Claude, Hi-Fi, Dotty and Sad Sack\n\nBaz, Dylan and Molly\n\nBeebie in the Flowers, Beebie at the Beach and Beebie on the Swing\n\nBen, Bill, Bill and Ben, Gnome, Rose, Scamper, Slowcoach, Thistle and Weed\n\nBig Ears, Noddy, Noddy's car, PC Plod, Sly and Tessie Bear\n\nBinka, Tango and Suki\n\nBits, Bobs and Trug\n\nBlue Cow, Jackson and Jelly\n\nBob the Builder, Bob on Wheels, Wendy, Spud, Pilchard and Lofty\n\nBoo, Growling Tiger, Laughing Duck and Sleeping Bear\n\nBrum and Brum in the City\n\nCharlie Chalk, Charlie's house and Lewis T.
