        "text": "Something Special is a colourful, fun programme, shown daily on CBeebies, featuring the much loved presenter Justin Fletcher, together with his alter-ego Mr Tumble. The show encourages children to explore the world around them and incorporates the use of Makaton; a recognised form of communication using signs and symbols, as well as rhymes and songs, to encourage and develop language in a fun and exciting way.\n\nGolden Bear will be launching the full new collection of Something Special this autumn which is available to buy at Tesco. The exciting new Mr Tumble toys and accessories, inspired by the hit CBeebies show, are sure to impress and can be seen at this year’s Christmas in July!\n\nToday had been a fun and stressful day. Having to host the Something Special Twitter party game along with UKMumsTV.\n\nEvery child will know Britain’s best-loved children’s entertainer Justin Fletcher MBE, – also known as Mr Tumble! Now he has launched Justin’s World. It is a new range of apps for pre-school children. Both of my children adore him and still watch Mr Tumble, Justin’s House and Jollywobbles! This coming Thursday, I am hosting the #SomethingSpecialParty. My children can’t wait to play with the toys!\n\nAbbey Home Media is releasing The Adventures of Abney and Teal – Faraway Island on 9th September 2013. Ms C and Mr K miss a lot of their favourite shows now that they are both in school full time. So they were both over the moon when I gave them the disc!\n\nSomething Special is a colourful, fun programme, shown daily on CBeebies, featuring the much loved presenter Justin Fletcher, together with his alter-ego Mr Tumble. The show encourages children to explore the world around them and incorporates the use of Makaton; a recognised form of communication using signs and symbols, as well as rhymes and songs, to encourage and develop language in a fun and exciting way.\n\n64 Zoo Lane is about a girl named Lucy, who lives next door to a zoo at 64 Zoo Lane. Every night when she goes to bed, the giraffe comes to take her to the zoo to meet all the animals and tell her a story! In this DVD, there are 9 episodes which are from Season 4 (2012-2013). Ms C loves to sing the opening theme but her pronunciation is not very good. It sounds like she is singing 60 floor 60 floor zoo lane…..\n\nRecently, I reviewed Lion Speedy Sauce. It is a book written by Carrie and David Grant who are from the creators of hit CBeebies series Pop Shop. It is part of a brand new range of six energetic picture books, all about making music! It is illustrated by Ailie Busby and the book is suitable for ages 3 to 7. It is published by Egmont Books Ltd.\n\nThis week, they have launched a brand new app, Jump Up and Join In! Based on their six energetic picture books, Juji is about making music, jumping up and joining in. It is aimed at children aged 4 to 8 years old, this interactive app has a huge range of musical activities for parents and children to enjoy together including an interactive e-book and a rip-roaring sing-along.\n\nWe had a fab time meeting Mike the Knight at Warwick Castle. I would like to thank HIT Entertainment Ltd who organised the trip and Warwick Castle for providing the event. This is our children’s first visit to the glorious Warwick castle and to learn about medieval history, magic, myth and adventure. It only took us 50 minutes to reach the castle from Lichfield.\n\nWe are a big fan of the Cbeebies channel because it is age appropriate for my kids and the shows are entertaining. My children love to watch Mister Maker, Grandpa In My Pocket and a lot more. We first got to know Cloudbabies last year in May 2012 when they first showed it on Cbeebies. Now both of my children are in full time school, they missed their favourite Cbeebies shows.\n\nMister Maker Volume 5 was out on DVD last week 3rd June. It is yet another brilliant craft time with him. In this DVD, there are 5 episodes and each are over 19 minutes. There are over 20 art and craft ideas making a wobbly egg, ice cream cone, 3D ships, worms in a can etc. We are big fans of the Cbeebies channel and my children love to watch Mister Maker whenever it is on. We are delighted to get this for review.\n\nAfter watching Mister Maker, both children like to try out one of Mister Maker’s ideas. Today, we made the ice cream cone game! It is very simple and we are suppose to make it in a minute. With two young children, this is unrealistic as we took at least 10 minutes of craft time.\n\nLion’s Speedy Sauce is a book written by Carrie and David Grant who are from the creators of hit CBeebies series Pop Shop. It is part of a brand new range of six energetic picture books, all about making music! It is illustrated by Ailie Busby and the book is suitable for ages 3 to 7. It was released on 3rd June 2013 and published by Egmont Books Ltd.\n\nAbadas is a CBeebies show screened every day Monday to Friday at 9.05am. It is about Hari the hippo, Ela the fox and Seren the bat who live in a pop-up book under Ben’s bed. There is an educational element to the show in that it helps children to learn new vocabulary that corresponds with objects they are likely to come across in childhood. It also helps to organise their talk to re-tell a story in its correct sequence. Questions are asked and answered which helps children confirm what they have learned.\n\nWhen I asked my son to watch this DVD, he replied he had watched it on Cbeebies. I was totally unaware of the show as it is shown at 8am in the morning. At that time, normally I am still tidying the rooms.\n\nWe first found out about Olly the Little White Van last year because we read that it is voiced by one of the children’s favourite Cbeebies stars, Justin Fletcher (Something Special, Justin’s House and Mr Tumble). I must admit that we only occasionally watch the CITV channel and Olly the Little White Van would probably have passed us by if it had not been for Justin."
