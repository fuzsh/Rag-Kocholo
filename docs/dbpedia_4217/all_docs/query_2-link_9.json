        "text": "Theres a lot of junk on CBeebies (Same Smile, i can cook and lets celebrate etc...), but every now and again something phenomenal comes along. Like Dirt Girl, Tinga Tales, Waybuloo, Pablo and Yoko! Jakamoko! Toto! and the latest is The Adventures of Abney and Teal which has totally blown me away.\n\nIf your kids havnt seen The Adventures of Abney and Teal yet its on every day at 5.45, be there!\n\nCbeebies is blantantly politcally correct and sometime i just have turn it off as i would rather my kids didn't watch it.\n\nI am all for learning about other cultures but not at the expense of our own.\n\nWinter lights festival !\n\nI mean come on ffs it f'ing xmas and no matter how many do-gooders want to change it ain't happening!\n\nMay I suggest you try the CBBC or CITV channel as it is a slight step up in age group and probably more suitable for you if you are now finding cbeebies a bit young\n\nOf course its going to be lower budget than the likes of top gear etc.\n\nAlright mumsnet, calm down\n\nIt isn't?!\n\nI mean the production standards of some of the shows are tosh. Lots of them have large sections of repeated footage, which the producers would probably insist is what kids want but is just actually laziness.\n\nthey repeat the footage because young kids WANT to watch it again also.\n\nB@\n\nThey have stopped making night garden because of the cost i believe...the production on waybuloo is fantastic - getting kids to interact with cgi animations must be a nightmare.\n\nThey make something called Abney and Teal now. Similarities are instantly obvious but it uses stop-motion puppets. We like it - something Womble-esque about it too.\n\nFor me is has to be Peppa and Ben & Holly's Little Kingdom. Both if which inject a sprinkle of adult humour too.\n\nAnd anything to dance around to, pretty much.\n\nThe Real Reason Why TV Is Bad for the Kids\n\n- http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/turn-tv/201110/the-real-reason-why-tv-is-bad-the-kids\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics just released their updated TV guidelines for children ages 2 and under. In their statement, they discourage all TV viewing for children in this age group. Part of the justification for their recommendation is that TV viewing reduces parent-child communication.\n\nI can sit down and watch most kids TV with my daughter. The only exception being ZingZillas. I absolutely HATE it.\n\nIt's like Muppets meets Planet of the Apes. Except not as good as that.\n\nThe Real Reason Why TV Is Bad for the Kids\n\n- http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/turn-tv/201110/the-real-reason-why-tv-is-bad-the-kids\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics just released their updated TV guidelines for children ages 2 and under. In their statement, they discourage all TV viewing for children in this age group. Part of the justification for their recommendation is that TV viewing reduces parent-child communication.\n\nI wish it reduced parent-child communication. If my daughter is watching TV alone, she'll shout a running commentary to who ever's nearest.\n\n'Daddy, Postman Pat just got licked by a cow!'\n\n'Daddy, Jess is in the helicopter!'\n\nSurely these programmes make kids more stupid?\n\nOr is that why the youths of today get into hallucinating drugs because they no longer get that feeling from Tellytubbies?\n\nSo say paediatricians who most likely were at work 8-8 when their kids were growing up and never really participated in their own kids development.\n\nPeppa Pig genuinely makes me laugh sometimes and my lad loves The Adventures of Abney and Teal just as much as he loves his Duplo and cars.\n\nOctonauts is brilliant, and has amazing theme music.\n\nPeppa Pig is very well observed, so can be appreciated by adults. Ben and Holly's Little Kingdom is made by the same people and is pretty funny.\n\nIn the Night Garden is pretty good. The score is very good, in particular. The Apney and Teal one, whatever it's called, is made by the same people."
