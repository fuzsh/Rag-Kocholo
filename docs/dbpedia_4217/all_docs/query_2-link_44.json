        "text": "When John Crane followed me on Twitter I really couldn't believe it, I checked, double checked and triple checked that it was the official John Crane Twitter account, after all why would they be following me!!? A new blogger, fresh on the scene, not a lot of experience, not established but John Crane was following me!! I tweeted a thanks for following message to John Crane, and that my friends is where it all began. Fast forward a few weeks and me and Spud was given the opportunity to review a Sqij Box set.\n\nThe Sqij Box is from John Crane's own brand collection - Tidlo Timeless Toys and is suitable for 2+ years, we was sent the large box that contained 16 pieces and a idea sheet.\n\nJohn Crane have been around for over a quarter of a century.

John Crane caters for all ages including items that are suitable for 0+.\n\nSqij Blox are beech wood blocks sandwiched with foam layers meaning a variety of models can be made either by copying designs from the idea sheet included with the set or by simply using your imagination.\n\nSpud used the idea sheet to copy some idea's as seen in the images above and below.\n\nSqij Blox helps with spatial awareness and hand to eye co-ordination. Spud like a majority of children loves using his imagination, he created this space monster in the image below from using the Sqij Blox.\n\nJohn Crane was established in 1984 as a family business, It was the start of a long & fruitful relationship with wooden toys.
