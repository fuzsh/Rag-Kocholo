        "text": "fifimcq Â· 04/04/2012 11:07\n\nI was marking an essay yesterday which was discussing gender socialisation referring to research conducted in 1972 (40 years ago!) which criticised books for having mainly male main characters. This reminded me how surprised I often am at the blatant sexism in programming on Cbeebies. The plethora of active male main charaters (Mike the Knight, Tommy Zoom, Kung Fu Tom, Justin (in 300 programmes) and many many others) is quite startling in comparison to Rosie (from Everything is Rosie) who is nice but VERY girly. Then I watched an episode of Dirt Girl, in which the girl is the main character and got a bit excited, only to be left jaw open when her water tank had a leak and she got Scrap Boy to fix it!\n\nHave the last 40 years of attempts at equality meant nothing for under 5's television? I find it incredible and genuinely shocking that girls are still given messages that they should be in support roles and that boys are the ones having all the fun and adventures! But am I being unreasonable?\n\nI dont really know. My wee one watches cbeebies and a few other channels. She enjoys some of the programs you mentioned. Most kids programmes seem to focus on either education or empathy, I've never really noticed sexism, but I've never looked for it.\n\nThere are characters such as Millie (umizoomi), olive (the ostrich), ruby (max and ruby), Dora (the explorer), madeline and Kim possible that all have (I think) strong female roles.\n\nI think that as adults we can sometimes overthink kids tv, it's there to entertain or to teach in some cases. But I agree you may have a point.\n\nYANBU as the male characters you have described are the protagonists of the show, where as the older females have more of a presenter type role. It is not to say that these shows are specifically aimed at boys/girls as my DD loves Mike the Knight and Tommy Zoom, however there is definitely a lack of female led shows.\n\nAs a side note, I was shocked when (quite recently) I found out Pipppin was a girl, I was convinced it was a boy !\n\nI agree with the OP. We tend to only watch in the morning, so we get (or got - the schedule seems to have changed in the last few days) Koala Brothers, Postman Pat, Bob the Builder - with strong, active male characters and stereotyped women sidekicks.\n\nSometimes it stays on long enough to get Charlie and Lola, ZingZillas and Tweenies (but not if I can help it). Yes, there are a mix of male and female here. But Lola is the helpless female always needing help from her stronger, cleverer older brother. With Zingzillas and Tweenies, I find that because the characters aren't human, they rely even more heavily on stereotypes to indicate which gender they are - the girls wear skirts and have bows in their hair, for e.g.\n\nit's a bit better where the programmes are CBeebies own productions - the presenters are a good mix and not so stereotyped. But I think the harm is in the depiction of everyday life in the cartoons and other narrative-type shows - women always have a very rigidly-defined role and it's never centre stage.\n\nThinking about it though - in the 80s we had John Craven telling us the news, Tony Hart telling us how to draw (ably assisted by a revolving sequence of much younger women - I particularly disliked Margot, for reasons I cannot now remember), Johnny Ball telling us how interesting maths was - all connected by Philip Schofield in the broom cupboard, occasionally subbed by another bloke. And there was Dungeons and Dragons, which was also quite famous five-ish (Sheila cared, Hank was brave).\n\nWhat I can't remember much about is the stuff I watched at a younger age - Smurfs had the smurfette, though. What about Bagpuss and Bod - can't remember.\n\nPigeon Street was quite good though, with Long Distance Clara the lorry driver!\n\nYANBU, in fact I wrote an essay about the very study you're talking about.\n\nIt's not about labelling boys programs and girls programs, its about the characters. Even though shows might have female characters, main characters are overwhelmingly male. The male characters tend to be the active ones, the ones who have the adventures, who make decisions, whilst the female ones follow their lead and rarely have the limelight all to themselves.\n\nI have to say, reading about it all for my essay opened my eyes an awful lot.\n\nAnd Smurfette was distinctive for being a female. Apparently the only thing about her personality worth commenting on. And one woman in an entire village full of men?!\n\nI haven't paid much attention to CBeebies, but I have noticed that Male presenters do all sorts of stuff (garden, see wild animals, make stuff) and the main female led show is about, er, cooking.\n\nAlso, can't remember the name of the show, but some Saturday morning thing I saw a couple of years ago on the Beeb and it was two male presenters and a woman and - surprise surprise - the blokes were 'naughty boys' and the woman was the sensible 'older sister' who was always tutting and having to sort things out. That really annoyed me! Why can't girls be naughty and cheeky too!\n\nI was a member of the Dennis the Menace fanclub and I still have my badge!"
