        "text": "Over the past few months we have been treating Ethan to children’s magazines as we have discovered he loves the stickers in them. So I was very interested to review the First Friends Magazine which is aimed specifically at toddlers.\n\nFirst Friends Magazine is designed to inspire and entertain 2 – 4 year olds. It features well-loved characters from the world of children’s books and entertainment and is published by award-winning pre-school publisher, Redan Publishing Ltd.\n\nThis first edition of First Friends Magazine is all about parties and comes with a Very Hungry Caterpillar tea set and also includes the first part of a collectable Elmer height chart and a Spot first words poster.\n\nThere are a whole host of characters included in this issue of First Friends Magazine including\n\nSpot The Dog\n\nELMER\n\nWoolly and Tig\n\nThe Very Hungry Caterpillar\n\nAbney and Teal and\n\nThe Gruffalo.\n\nThis gives the First Friends Magazine a lovely mix of children’s favorites.\n\nThe First Friends Magazine is full of activities that can be completed with your toddler. Including stores, colouring, drawing, spot the difference and lots of sticker placements.\n\nEthan loved the stickers and they were the perfect size for him to handle and place in the correct position.\n\nEthan also loved the colouring pages.\n\nMy Verdict\n\nI loved that every page had and activity, perfect for its toddler audience.
