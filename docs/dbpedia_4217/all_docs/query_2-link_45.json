        "text": "YABU to not like Bluey.\n\nI do agree that a lot of CBeebies is shit. But given that it has no adverts, and itâ€™s mostly vaguely educational it seems like the best of a bad bunch.\n\nMy 5 year old has decided heâ€™s into Pinocchio and Friends. Now that really is appalling.\n\nBiff and Chip are in a whole load of school early reading books. That's where that comes from.\n\nBluey is amazing though, so I can't take that post seriously at all.\n\nI donâ€™t â€˜getâ€™ number blocks. I fear I have the mathematical ability of a two year old ðŸ˜‚\n\nBluey just leaves me cold, itâ€™s fine, itâ€™s not awful or anything but I donâ€™t get the love. Sorry!\n\nWell as you say, you're hardly the target audience! My kids like or have liked a lot of the programmes, and learned things from watching them, so I'm a fan by extension.\n\nMy 5yo likes Vida the Vet, Waffle (they actually watch this at school!), and Biff, Chip and Kipper (gets some of the books from school).\n\nMy 2yo likes Supertato.\n\nBoth of them like Bluey (and so do me and DH!).\n\nI'd say you were right there.\n\nOP, I really couldn't stand it, thank God DS is at school now.\n\nEven worse... when eldest was 2 she loved Mr Bloom and the vegetables (Mr Bloom's Nursery). Don't look it up, it will give you nightmares.\n\nMaybe mine need to grow into it. Only 3 and 1. But they surely ARE the target audience. 1 year old likes moon and me which I love as well, I feel like Iâ€™m tripping when I watch it with her ðŸ¤£\n\nCBeebies is for children up to 7 - as well as older children with SEN - so not everything will be primarily aimed at toddlers. They often tend to show programmes targeted more at older children in that group earlier in the morning and then in the evening, with the baby and toddler stuff more prevalent whilst the older ones will be at school.\n\nIt's standard with any channel that shows a wide variety of programmes that not everybody will like every show: it's not like Sky Golf (if that exists?!) that golf fans will love pretty much all of and almost everybody else will hate!\n\nI donâ€™t think itâ€™s shit at all!\n\nIn fact, much, MUCH prefer it over YouTube and Ms Rachel. I resolve to never have either of those two on in our house!\n\nYou get a YABU just for besmirching Bluey. But as others say, thereâ€™s Numberblocks and Hey Duggee for great viewing that donâ€™t bore adults. Colour/Alphablocks are eye catching for the kids as well. Bing is irritating but at least thereâ€™s plenty of episodes.\n\nWaffle can be yeeted to the moon though.\n\nFor me, the lack of adverts and the knowledge that everything will be appropriate outweighs a lot of the tedious programmes (like Waffle). Balamory is one of my 4 year old's favourite programmes even though it was on decades ago.\n\nI watch some of these with my grandson. Some are good, a lot are terrible (sorry I can't remember the names)\n\nOut of curiosity, what is meant to be so amazing about Bluey? It's ok, a cute enough wee blue dog, but I don't get the adulation."
