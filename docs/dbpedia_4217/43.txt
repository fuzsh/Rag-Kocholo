The Adventures of Abney and Teal has been one of those CBeebies programmes that both my children have always enjoyed, although we often miss it being on around bath time. So this DVD from Abbey Home Media is a great idea containing lots of lovely episodes including Faraway Island.

Abney and Teal live on an island in the middle of a lake,in the middle of a park, in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the big city. They share their island home with a group of friendly and hilarious characters, and together they are always ready for an adventure.

Featuring 8 episodes:

Faraway Island

The Porridge Party

The Star Stick

The Storm

Stuck

The Radio

The Poc-Poc Hunt

The Train

The DVD is released on 9th September 2013 and can be purchased from all good DVD stockists.

For more information can be found on the Abbey Home Media.
