The Meland Foundation derives its name from a place, a spirit, and a family.

The Place: Meland, hardly a village, but a cluster of houses in the countryside of southern Norway, with small farms, close to the fjords. Here lived hardy, rustic people with a great spirit.

The Spirit: The spirit of Meland derived from a love of home and family infused with a faith that would reach out to do impossible things on their behalf. That spirit drove them to work long and hard, to journey long distances, and to face the hazards of land and sea in all kinds of weather sustained by a deeply religious faith.
