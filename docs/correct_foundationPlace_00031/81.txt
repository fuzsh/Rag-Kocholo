Have you throught through what would happen if everyone across your company had access to redirecting payments from your largest customers to another bank account, for example their own? Does your organisation have a structured approach to how digital identities are provisioned, reviewed and offboarded and does it align with the risk exposure that the company is willing to tolerate? In this webinar P√•l Myren of ZTL, Anna-Karin √òstlie from Kantega SSO and Andy Fernandez from HYCU, Inc. discuss the importance of strong digital identity access management routines and share examples of how companies can reduce exposure to unintentional business risks and improve their compliance position with a well thought through approach to IAM. https://lnkd.in/d6Exz587 Marit Collin Frode Standal Jon Espen Ingvaldsen, PhD Simen Burhol Elias Brattli S√∏rensen Ksawery Buczkowski Dave Rosenlund Skule Johansen Mari Helene Fuglem Erik Tur√∏y Midtun Gl√∏er Langslet Espen A.
