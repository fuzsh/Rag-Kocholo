Faithful to Our Mission and Members

At the Sons of Norway Foundation, we are driven by a sense of purpose: to share and preserve Nordic heritage, to positively affect our membersâ€™ lives, and to make Sons of Norway communities better places to live. Since 1966, staying true to this purpose, we have been supporting our members through scholarships and cultural exchange opportunities, providing disaster relief to members in need, and funding community programs that celebrate Norwegian heritage and culture.

A donation to the Sons of Norway Foundation is a contribution to the positive impact we make through community, youth, educational, and cultural projects.
