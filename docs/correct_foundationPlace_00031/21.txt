Over the years Norway’s savings banks have always donated a percentage of their profits to the local communities in which they have operated. Sparebankstiftelsen DNB is continuing to pursue this tradition.

The foundation is the second largest owner of Norway’s largest financial group, DNB, and use the dividend for philanthropic purposes. Since we were founded in 2002, the foundation has contributed more than NOK 8 billion towards philanthropic purposes.

What do we contribute to?

The foundation’s main contributions are providing grants to projects supporting children and young people.

The grants are mainly awarded to organisations, based on applications. We receive more than 7000 applications annually through our digital application system. Approximately 40 percent of the applications receive grants. The board of the foundation decides all allocations of funds.

We award grants to projects throughout Norway, but the foundation’s Statutes stipulate that when allocating grants, reasonable consideration should be given to the national origins of such funds, which is Eastern Norway. Thus, over time, at least 75% of the foundation’s allocations and investments will go to our geographical core area: Østfold, Oslo, Akershus, Oppland, Buskerud, Vestfold and Telemark, and Ringsaker municipality in Hedmark. Furthermore, we also fund initiatives of national importance.

In addition to grant making, the foundation makes non-profit investments by buying art that is deposited in Norwegian museums, as well as string instruments that are lent to leading Norwegian musicians. The foundation also runs the culture house Sentralen in Kvadraturen in Oslo.

Moreover, in 2016 the foundation entered into an agreement to purchase Amedia, Norway’s largest publisher of local media titles, and established the Amedia Foundation as owner of the media group. The foundation was established to ensure long-term and stable ownership of Norwegian local newspapers.

The capital basis

The foundation’s capital, is the result of almost 200 years of well-managed banking operations, and originates from the Gjensidige NOR Sparebank, which later on merged with DNB to form the DNB Group.

The foundation was formed in 2002 when Gjensidige NOR Sparebank was converted into a limited liability company. The bank’s core capital was converted into shares and the authorities decided that any capital not in the possession of external owners should be owned and managed by a foundation.

The foundation’s capital consists of the accumulated profits that have resulted from the savings bank’s operations ever since Christiania Sparebank was established in 1822.

Our two objectives:

– To be a long-term owner of DNB.

– To preserve the traditions pursued by Norway’s savings banks, of donating a percentage of its profits to charitable causes.
