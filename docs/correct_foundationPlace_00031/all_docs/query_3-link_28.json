        "text": "Students want more and faster feedback on the texts they write. A research project in secondary school suggests that students can write better texts if they receive feedback from a computer program based on artificial intelligence.\n\nWritten by Ann-Kristin Johansen, Østfold University College\n\nAt Østfold University College (HiØ), researchers are working on developing an artificial intelligence program to help students write good texts, and the first prototype has already been tested on secondary school students at three different schools in Halden.\n\nIn collaboration with teachers at the pilot schools, the researchers developed a writing process for pupils on the theme of heroes. The pupils were asked to write a text about who they consider to be a hero and argue why. Based on the text they entered into the computer program, they received individual feedback in return. The actual writing process consisted of the students working on three drafts of the text and receiving feedback between each round, with the last draft being submitted to the teacher for a final assessment.\n\n- It was designed as a writing process where students wrote their texts through multiple drafts and received feedback from the technology,\" explains Irina Engeness, professor and dean at the Faculty of Teacher Education and Languages at HiØ.\n\nThe testing of secondary school students is part of the project \"Artificial intelligence (AI) for assessment for learning (AfL) to strengthen learning and teaching in the 21st century\" (AI4AfL). The project has received NOK 12 million in funding from the Research Council of Norway and is run by HiØ in collaboration with Volda University College, Halden Municipality and Hypatia Learning AS.\n\nThe university, the municipality and Hypatia Learning are cluster partners in the Cluster for Applied AI.\n\nSuch clear differences\n\nWhile some of the classes that participated in the writing process were allowed to use the new computer program in their text work, the other classes were to work without this help and instead give each other feedback along the way using the assignment criteria. The preliminary results indicate that the choice of method had a different impact on the final grades the students received.\n\n- \"At all three schools, the classes that participated in the writing process using the new technology have improved their grades from the first draft to the final version,\" says Engeness, who is leading the project.\n\nIn the classes that did not have access to the program, there were also changes in grades during the process, but not to the same extent. The researchers found that students who used the technology were more involved in the discussions about the feedback and how to further develop their texts in line with the feedback.\n\n- \"We saw that they used the feedback provided by the technology as a starting point for the conversations, and from a pedagogical perspective, the discussions in these classes were more content-rich. At the same time, we saw that the students in the other classes that didn't use the same technology were unsure of how to give each other feedback,\" says Engeness.\n\nThe quality of the feedback that students receive on schoolwork generally varies widely, according to the researchers.\n\n- \"Some students find that they only receive feedback such as 'write more', but they don't necessarily understand what else they should write,\" says Siv Gamlem, a professor at Volda University College.\n\nGamlem's research includes assessment and feedback and says it is important that students receive feedback as an integral part of the writing process. The preliminary findings from the project also confirm this.\n\n- With this program, we want to give all students an equal opportunity to develop their work,\" she says and adds:\n\n- Through this program, they will receive input on the content of the text and what they should write more about. This will help them to develop knowledge and understanding of their own writing process and to write their own texts.\n\nReceived significantly more feedback\n\nAfter the writing process, the students were interviewed about what it was like to participate.\n\n- \"The students who used the computer program said that they really appreciated the feedback they got from it,\" says Engeness.\n\nThe students who did not get to use the new technology had a slightly different experience of the writing process.\n\n- They stated that it was not easy to participate and found it difficult to find the right form of feedback to give and what to focus on. As a result, they became very cautious with their feedback,\" she explains.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the project so far shows that the students who used the technology also received the most and most varied feedback. This finding is not unexpected.\n\n- \"It will not be possible to give all students this type of feedback integrated into a writing process if it is done by only one teacher,\" says Gamlem.\n\nThrough the technology, each student received as many as 30-40 pieces of feedback on each draft. According to the researchers, the teachers involved expressed concern prior to the workshop that the computer program would give students too much feedback. However, this was not the case.\n\n- \"When we interviewed the teachers afterwards, they were surprised at how carefully the students took in all the feedback. At the same time, they said that they would never be able to give the same amount to each student as they received through the program,\" says Engeness.\n\nHowever, the researchers note that there are individual differences between students, and that care must be taken not to give too little or too much feedback. Students must be both able and willing to use the feedback they receive on their work.\n\nWill work on improving the concept\n\nThe students who participated in the project stated that they liked the design of the program and found the quick response positive. They also expressed that it was positive to work in a process where they could improve their texts in several rounds.\n\nHowever, the amount of feedback the program provides is one of the things the researchers will now continue to work on towards the completion of prototype 2 of the program.\n\n- \"We need to find a solution to how much feedback should be given so that it is motivating and not too much. We know that students who don't perform well will receive a lot of feedback that highlights mistakes, and this can be demotivating,\" says Gamlem.\n\nShe emphasizes that they must ensure that feedback is given in a type and amount that contributes to further development in the students' text work.\n\n- \"If they get too much, they won't be able to use it, which is why it's been important for us to interview the students participating in this experiment. We need to make sure that all students receive feedback that motivates them to develop and helps to improve their work,\" she says.\n\nNo new Chat GPT\n\nThe development of the computer program is in full swing, in parallel with the rather intense debate surrounding Chat GPT and similar services based on artificial intelligence. The researchers behind the multi-million euro project AI4AfL emphasize that they are not working on a separate Chat GPT version.\n\nExcept for the fact that the program they are now developing is based on AI technology, it has little in common with Chat GPT.\n\n- These are completely different products. Chat GPT is a product that produces a text for the user, while in our case it is about taking an essay or text that the student writes and providing feedback on it. Only the AI technology behind these software products is similar.\n\nThis is according to Associate Professor Hasan Ogulat the Faculty of Information Technology, Engineering and Economics at HiØ.\n\nAccording to Ogul, the first prototype of the program, which focuses on syntactic errors, makes little use of AI technology. The second prototype that will now be developed based on, among other things, the results of the testing done among school students, will make greater use of AI technology because it is about analyzing and understanding the actual meaning of the texts.\n\n- It is important for us to emphasize that we are not developing another Chat GPT technology. The educational perspective is absolutely essential to the technology we are developing. It should offer precise and useful feedback on student submissions that can be addressed in the next draft. Such a writing process can be embraced by students as a good approach to understanding what it means to create a good essay,\" Engeness explains.\n\nStrengthens the teacher as a guide\n\nAfter testing the first prototype on secondary school students, the researchers have a comprehensive data set that will be analyzed and used to develop prototype 2. This will be tested on the same students during the fall in a workshop where they will work on both syntax and content. During the test project, the researchers collected film material showing the students at work and how teachers give feedback on their writing. They also collected a large number of essays in three versions from each participating student.\n\nThe data will be analyzed from both a pedagogical and a technological perspective. In prototype 2, the researchers hope to strengthen the program so that it can work even better for teachers from a guidance perspective.\n\n- \"We are all former teachers, and we know how difficult it is to collect data on students to find out what they are struggling with. This tool provides specific info about each student that the teacher can use to understand what the student actually needs,\" Gamlem points out.\n\nAt the same time, she emphasizes that the program cannot replace the role of the teacher.\n\n- It's important to remember that there's one thing that students need that they don't get from technology, and that's emotional support. If you see students struggling, as a teacher you can show that you see them and offer both academic and emotional help and support. This program will give the teacher time and opportunity to use their skills and knowledge in a different way,\" she says.\n\n- When a new technology has suddenly become a topic of conversation around the dinner table in a thousand homes, you get chills when you're in the middle of it yourself\n\nChatGPT has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. The technology is so impressive that many experts are alarmed - but Microsoft's Norwegian team is optimistic.\n\nThe famous language assistant is developed by the company OpenAI, with strong support from the giant Microsoft. In January this year, Microsoft announced that through its third billion-dollar investment in OpenAI, it plans to introduce the technology behind ChatGPT across its consumer and enterprise products and introduce new categories of digital experiences.\n\n- \"We renewed this partnership because we have a shared ambition to accelerate the development of artificial intelligence, and to do this in a responsible way that democratizes artificial intelligence as a new technology platform,\" comments Jon Jahren, Director Azure Cloud & AI at Microsoft Norway. The company is a member of the Cluster for Applied AI.\n\nIn the long term, OpenAI's artificial intelligence can be built into several of Microsoft's products, such as Word, PowerPoint and Outlook. In addition, Microsoft is in the process of implementing ChatGPT in its search engine Bing, which could seriously challenge Google's position in this area.\n\nLike communicating with a human being\n\nIn simple terms, ChatGPT is a language model that makes you feel like you are communicating with a human, not a machine. Jahren believes it has become a \"talking point\" among both experts and the general public precisely because no other artificial intelligence (AI) model has so far been as good as ChatGPT at understanding and generating text.\n\n- ChatGPT has proven to be a great way to demonstrate the usefulness of such language models to a wide audience. Here, new user groups can immediately increase productivity, acquire new knowledge, or express their creativity,\" he points out.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 14, the latest version of the language model was launched, called GPT-4. This is the most powerful model to date and can solve more difficult tasks with better precision than its predecessor, GPT-3. In addition, GPT-4 produces more user-friendly answers.\n\nExperts call for a pause in development\n\nThe performance of the latest version of ChatGPT is simply so impressive that more than 500 of the most influential technology experts in the world have signed a letter of concern to OpenAI and its peers asking them to pause the development of the AI technology until adequate security measures are in place. In this regard, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has confirmed that they have not yet started training GPT-5.\n\nJon Jahren believes the world has only seen a taste of what is to come through ChatGPT. That's why Microsoft is also concerned that developments in artificial intelligence take place in a responsible way.\n\n- Our strategy in this area has not come overnight. There have been decades of research from Microsoft and across the industry. We believe AI has the potential to solve some of humanity's biggest problems, helping people become more creative and more productive,\" says Jahren.\n\nHe adds:\n\n- We should move forward with hope for innovation and optimism, while holding ourselves accountable to do so in a safe way for all those affected by this.\n\nArtificial intelligence in the future\n\nAlthough development has been very rapid in recent years and language models such as ChatGPT both amaze and frighten, Microsoft's Norwegian cloud director sees no reason to demonize the situation.\n\n- Artificial intelligence has the potential to dramatically improve how people create, work and communicate. \"Since Microsoft's founding vision is to help people solve real-world challenges and achieve more, it's only natural that AI will be an important technology for us,\" he emphasizes.\n\nJahren admits that both he and his colleagues were taken aback by the breadth of ChatGPT's reach and the engagement the technology has generated.\n\n- When a new technology has suddenly become a topic of conversation around the dinner table in a thousand homes, you get chills when you are in the middle of it yourself. Developments in artificial intelligence have been fairly steady for decades, but we expect a \"boost\" both in adoption by existing customers and in startup environments like the one Smart Innovation Norway represents. A lot will happen here in the years to come!\n\nSee what Jon Jahren had to say about developments in artificial intelligence when he visited AI+ 2023:\n\nNorway's leading experts in artificial intelligence have established a new competence center, and Smart Innovation Norway is a natural partner.\n\nThe new national competence center has been named Nemonoor. The aim is to help enable private and public sector organizations to adopt artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n- Artificial intelligence is referred to as one of the most important technological developments of our time. To maintain a competitive business sector in the future, it is important to use artificial intelligence for the benefit of customers, says Kjell Reidar Mydske.\n\nHe is the CEO of Smart Innovation Norway, which has built up Norway's largest business cluster in artificial intelligence, the Cluster for Applied AI. This is an industry cluster for companies that use AI (artificial intelligence) in a business context.\n\nGiving business access to the experts\n\nMydske is proud of the position that Smart Innovation Norway has built up in AI in a national and international context, which makes them a natural part of the Nemonoor initiative.\n\n- Here, companies get access to the national team in artificial intelligence, he says, pointing out that it is easier for companies to test the potential of their business in AI when you have a competence center that is closely linked to the business community.\n\n- \"Because we have a broad European network and good knowledge of clusters, the public funding system and key players at home and abroad through our work in the Cluster for Applied AI, Smart Innovation Norway is responsible for the network and ecosystem in Nemonoor,\" explains Mydske.\n\nThe establishment of the new competence center is also a further reinforcement of the renowned Halden environment. One of the knowledge companies in the network is the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE), which is also one of the initiators of the new center.\n\nNemonoor is a service provider that will find funding and support businesses with very specific resources. The center will also connect actors at both national and European level who can benefit from each other.\n\n- AI has never been more talked about, discussed or utilized than now. Therefore, it is increasingly important for companies, organizations and businesses to understand and exploit the potential of the technology, says Nemonoor coordinator Eirik Andreassen in Digital Norway, one of the other actors behind the competence center.\n\nSee photos from the launch at Rebel in Oslo (click on the images for a larger version):\n\n- The timing is good\n\nMachine learning models cut emissions on construction sites. Computer vision streamlines maintenance and improves the quality of Norwegian road fences. Image recognition technology gives fish farmers better tools to monitor activity in cages.\n\nThese are just some examples of applications of artificial intelligence in Norwegian business today.\n\n- There has never been such a short path from research to application in any field. So much is happening, and it's exciting. Now everyone can use a little bit of artificial intelligence, even if they don't know how to program.\n\nSo says Inga Strümke. She is a researcher at the Norwegian Open AI Lab at NTNU and SimulaMet with artificial intelligence as her field of expertise.\n\n- We are still at an early stage of development. No one knows the extent of how technology will affect society and the world we live in. It presents many opportunities, but also a number of challenges,\" she points out.\n\nStrümke believes the timing for Nemonoor is good.\n\n- In Norway, we have a high level of trust, a high degree of digital maturity and lots of data. There are many opportunities to learn from each other and build bridges. It is important to have openness and more collaboration across the board to do this in a good way,\" she says.\n\n- AI could cut global emissions by a fifth\n\nThe consortium behind Nemonoor consists of some of the leading artificial intelligence communities in Norway;\n\nNORA/UiO, Norway Health Tech, NTNU, SINTEF, Digital Norway, Smart Innovation Norway, Institutt for Energiteknikk (IFE) and Ålesund Kunnskapspark (ÅKP).\n\nMorten Dalsmo is Executive Vice President of SINTEF Digital. He points out that there is a crying need in the business community for access to resources that deal with artificial intelligence.\n\n- The business community has a lot to offer when it comes to sharing data and expertise across industries and sectors,\" he begins, adding:\n\n- Artificial intelligence has the potential to reduce global emissions by a fifth by 2030. At SINTEF, we are committed to connecting industry to the research front and ensuring that artificial intelligence is adapted to multiple application areas.\n\nHåkon Haugli, Director of Innovation Norway, is also clear that the potential for sharing in Norwegian business is huge.\n\n- Nemonoor is a fantastic connection box between different businesses and industries. Then it's up to participants to go into it with the good questions and willingness to share. If they do, then this is a great initiative,\" he says.\n\nCloser to European developments\n\nNemonoor is a European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH, pronounced \"eddi\") and is partly funded through Norway's membership in the EU's seven-year DIGITAL program. This means that the services are provided free of charge or at a reduced price.\n\nAccording to Andreassen, Europe is currently undergoing a major resource boost when it comes to artificial intelligence. The EU has currently committed to the creation of 136 EDIHs in all EU Member States.\n\nAndreassen explains that Europe has the world's highest density of researchers, but the world's lowest proportion of start-ups.\n\n- This is an indication that we are failing to transfer the knowledge that exists in research environments and clusters to industry,\" Andreassen says and adds:\n\n- The technology should be made so accessible that everyone can use it. That's where we need to go.\n\nHaugli also highlights the importance of being connected to the European arena:\n\n- It provides enormous added value if we are able to make use of this position. That we manage to position Norway internationally as an exciting country when it comes to the use of artificial intelligence.\n\nStrümke is clear that understanding and knowledge of what artificial intelligence actually is and how it can be used will be particularly important if Norwegian businesses are to be good at using the technology.\n\n- I also wish we had more political leadership in this field, but now there is actually self-coordination. It's an attempt to solve problems together - and that's fantastic,\" she concludes.\n\nFACT BOOK:\n\nNemonoor is a brand new national center that will build the competence and capacity of private and public enterprises to use artificial intelligence.\n\nNemonoor consists of eight partners from research, academia, innovation, networks and test centers:\n\nDigital Norway\n\nNORA - Norwegian Artificial Intelligence Research Consortium/UiO\n\nNorwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)\n\nNorway Health Tech\n\nSINTEF\n\nInstitute for Energy Technology (IFE)\n\nÅlesund Kunnskapspark (ÅKP)\n\nSmart Innovation Norway\n\nDue to its broad European network and its good knowledge of cluster operations and public funding, Smart Innovation Norway's business cluster Cluster for Applied AI will be a key contributor to Nemonoor.\n\nThe center offers its services to businesses in the fields of:\n\nProduction\n\nHealth\n\nCommunities\n\nEnergy\n\nNemonoor is a European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH) and is funded by the EU.\n\nEuropean Digital Innovation Hubs (pronounced \"eddi\") are a key instrument of the EU's new seven-year DIGITAL program.\n\nNorway has been granted two EDIHs, Nemonoor and Oceanapolis.\n\nAs a skills broker, Hermund Arntzen Dale has first-hand knowledge of how research can help companies solve their challenges.\n\nCompetence Broker is a free tool for developing business in Viken through research-related projects.\n\nFor several years, Smart Innovation Norway has represented one of seven brokers in Viken county. Hermund Arntzen Dale has recently taken on the role and is already well underway with both outreach activities and guidance of companies.\n\n- Well suited as a competence broker\n\nThe aim is for business to develop through research-based innovation by helping business actors to identify areas where research can contribute to further growth.\n\nDale gets high praise as a skills broker from Violette Yi Qin, project coordinator for Skills Broker in Viken.\n\n- We believe Hermund is a good fit for the role due to his work experience, educational background and personality. He has worked in various industries within energy and technology and has a good understanding of the public funding system both through academia and work in industry. The fact that he has work experience as an entrepreneur, we think is very positive - then you can forge closer ties with an important part of the companies, which is the main goal of competence brokerage. In addition, he is friendly and motivated, which we think is a success factor for being a good competence broker in Viken,\" she says.\n\nThe key tasks of a competence broker are to help companies identify problems that can be solved with research, find relevant partners and the right expertise in the research community, and find funding schemes that can co-finance the project.\n\n- My background means that I have good knowledge of the public funding system, and that I know the needs and challenges of early-stage companies. I also find it very fun to tackle challenges in the business community and look at the opportunities that exist to develop new solutions while working with my areas of interest, which are technology, climate and the environment,\" says Dale.\n\n- To become more profitable than they are today\n\nThe competence brokerage scheme is funded by the Viken County Council's Forregion programme, which aims to mobilize increased use of research as an innovation tool.\n\nBased on the Research Council's three priority areas of sustainable transition and value creation, commercialization from research, and regional development, competence brokers have been established within urban, urban and regional development, health and care, climate, energy and environment, and technology.\n\nDale offers his expertise and advice in technology together with Per Olve Tobiassen from SpinOn AS in Kongsberg.\n\n- The service is initially aimed at enterprises with little or no research experience. The premise is that development should take place through research. Together we will identify the problem and potential of the business, with the aim of creating returns and new jobs. We will simply find solutions that are more profitable than they are today,\" Dale explains.\n\nSkills brokers exist in every county and the community works across municipal and county boundaries.\n\n- I can easily connect them with the right competence broker in the right field and geographical location. The others do the same for me. In this way, we have a nationwide reach and, in practice, no limitations,\" says Dale.\n\nNeed for guidance\n\nMost research and development (R&D) projects rely on funding schemes to be realized. And it is start-up companies that often have the opportunity to try out new ideas in response to changes in the market.\n\nUnfortunately, figures from the Research Council show that small and early-stage companies are the most likely to have their applications rejected.\n\n- Young companies naturally do not have experience in writing project applications, and many do not spend enough time on formulating themselves correctly or responding to what the call for proposals actually asks for. It can therefore be useful to get guidance from a competence broker when writing applications,\" says Dale.\n\nThe offer aims to give companies experience in R&D. The FORREGION Business Project support scheme is therefore central. Under this scheme, companies can receive up to NOK 200,000 for their research project.\n\nCompetence brokers also provide guidance on other funding schemes at the Research Council of Norway, the Regional Research Fund and other actors. However, competence brokers do not provide guidance on writing applications to Innovation Norway (IN)'s funding schemes because they have their own supervisors.\n\n- We work closely with IN and can, however, refer to relevant personnel who can be of good help to the company, Dale explains.\n\nShort route to skills and networks\n\nThe \"competence broker\" function was awarded to Smart Innovation Norway since the company already works with business, development, innovation, applied research, technology and clusters.\n\nRead more about Smart Innovation Norway's two other business clusters:\n\nNCE SMart Energy Markets\n\nCluster for Decommissioning and Repurposing\n\nDale has access to Smart Innovation's entire network and all the knowledge of its employees. This puts him in a particularly good position to assist Viken's business community.\n\n- The way we work on a daily basis at Smart Innovation is not very different from the typical day-to-day work of a competence broker. We share and use methods such as facilitating workshops, uncovering needs, mapping competencies and identifying potential, so I have a short path to competencies other than my own,\" he explains.\n\nExperience so far shows that the free skills brokerage offer has great potential to become known among business stakeholders.\n\nA large part of Dale's job will therefore be to conduct outreach activities both directly to innovation environments, companies and individuals, and by being present at trade fairs, conferences and other meeting places where these actors participate.\n\n- An important task will be to motivate innovation and development. Not everyone sees their own potential, but with my knowledge and network, I see opportunities where others do not. Nevertheless, it is crucial that the will to innovate comes from within, and another important part of my job will be to be realistic and make the right recommendations for further development,\" he says.\n\nPractical information\n\nThere is no application process for using a competence broker, nor is there any cost associated with the service.\n\nInterested parties can contact Hermund Arntzen Dale by e-mail or phone +47 909 68 284.\n\nIt is very nice to be able to welcome such an exciting and creative company as mTabs in the Cluster for Applied AI! The company thinks in new ways when it comes to digital surfaces, and has for many years worked with simulations and synthetic data. mTabs AS was established in December 2021 and had its first year in 2022, but the founders have extensive experience both with the services they provide and with collaboration within various ecosystems. We look forward to many great collaborations in the future!\n\nMarianne Bjerkman, Cluster Leader in the Cluster for Applied AI\n\nThis summer, the company mTabs became a cluster partner in the Cluster for Applied AI.\n\nTrond-Atle Bokerød is a storyteller, founder and CEO of the company, and tells us more about how mTabs works in a short interview.\n\nWhat do you do in mTabs and what is your role?\n\nMedia, marketing and metaverse are three of the areas mTabs works in.\n\nMedia: with a main focus on living storytelling through film\n\nMarketing: How is your digital visibility? Are you reaching your goals and are your potential customers finding you?\n\nMetaverse: The internet of the future is coming, where the internet will be experienced rather than scrolled/browsed. We are creating digital twins and complex simulations that enable communication on a whole new level.\n\nmTabs has a wide range of expertise in media, marketing and metaverse. We also have a unique expertise in technology, which makes us an ideal partner for larger companies that want help with development, digitalization and innovation.\n\nIn addition to being storytellers, we at mTabs are pioneers in the development of the metaverse, or the internet of the future. We create complex simulations and digital worlds (digital twins) that enable communication on a whole new level.\n\nAs a storyteller, my role is to find the right story for every situation and convey it accurately. Stories are an important part of everything I do, whether it's artificial intelligence training or traditional communication needs. Being a storyteller is also being a problem solver, and I have developed a skill set that helps me in many situations where challenges arise, often with a high degree of innovation.\n\nWe create complex simulations and digital worlds (digital twins) that allow for a whole new level of communication\n\nTrond-Atle Bokerød, mTabs\n\nWhat are your objectives for the future?\n\nIn 2023, mTabs will strengthen its position in media, marketing and metaverse. To do this, we are now establishing offices in Iceland and Sweden. Iceland has a strong gaming technology community, which will be useful for us in our work with digital twins and the development of metaverse. Gothenburg in Sweden, on the other hand, is a center for innovation in the Nordic region, making it a natural place for mTabs to establish itself. With branches in Iceland and Sweden, mTabs will be even better positioned to continue to develop and grow in its three focus areas.\n\nDo you have a success story or an exciting project you would like to highlight?\n\nWe have two projects that together show the breadth of what we do.\n\nCase 1: Kållandsö:\n\nThe Kållandsö project uses a digital twin to explore different stages of destination development. We have created a \"game\" where entrepreneurs can experiment with different variables and see how they affect each other. The goal of the project is to strengthen competitiveness and drive digital transformation for local SMEs by building a smart and sustainable destination. AI controls the variables and gives the user a new experience every time they play/simulate.\n\nCase 2; Norske Skog Saugbrugs\n\nNorske Skog Saugbrugs wants to make itself more attractive to the labor market and employees and show its presence. The project \"Folka på Saugbrugs\" shows employees at Saugbrugs and what they do, as well as how the company makes high-quality magazine paper and innovates with new products. The content is collected on a dedicated website and then shared on social media, with specially created content for each channel. Saugbrugs has also invested heavily in film production, creating unique footage of the entire production line using new filming methods.\n\nOur production is template-based, which makes it transferable to other companies. First up is Ny Plast, which is working with Smart Energy to think sustainable and green while escalating their production of plastics. This is a unique opportunity for other companies to follow Ny Plast's example and increase their own production in a sustainable way.\n\nOur templates are managed by AI to optimize your workflow.\n\nWhy do you choose to become partners in the Cluster for Applied AI and what is your current or potential place in the AI ecosystem?\n\nAs a partner in the Cluster for Applied AI, we want to expand our network and have a meeting point for competence development in AI. We see an increasing use of AI in our own production and daily work, and want to learn more about methods, processes and how other companies are starting to develop and implement AI. By joining a cluster, we can also contribute with our own knowledge and experience, and have the opportunity to share experiences and communicate with other companies on how we can benefit from AI. In this way, we can see ourselves as an active part of the AI ecosystem and help share knowledge and expertise with other companies.\n\nWho: Trond-Atle Bokerød\n\nCompany: mTabs AS\n\nRole: Storyteller, CEO, Founder\n\nLinkedin: Trond-Atle | LinkedIn\n\nThe current close ties between the UK and Norway in many areas provide a basis for further cooperation, and Smart Innovation Norway's networks and areas of expertise are both interesting and relevant.\n\nThis was the conclusion of UK Trade Commissioner Chris Barton after visiting Smart Innovation Norway at Remmen.\n\nHe was in Norway to get to know and learn from companies, partners and projects that the British Embassy in Oslo works closely with and that are engaged in technology and innovation of interest to the UK.\n\nSmart Innovation Norway, eSmart Systems, Batteriretur, Paxster and NORA (Norwegian Artificial Intelligence Research Consortium) were among those visited by the Trade Commissioner and the Embassy's traveling party.\n\n- Great potential for increased cooperation\n\n- The work being done at Smart Innovation Norway is interesting to us in many different ways,\" said Barton.\n\nThe UK is among the world's leaders in innovation, tech and artificial intelligence (AI), but is looking for further growth to further contribute to the development of society both commercially and in terms of services in health, education and energy.\n\n- What specific cooperation opportunities do you see between the UK and Smart Innovation Norway?\n\n- Both parties are leading the way in reducing the carbon footprint, where artificial intelligence, technology and smart solutions are incredibly important. I am happy to say that we are already working together in these areas, but there is still a lot of potential,\" Barton said.\n\nThe Trade Commissioner also pointed to artificial intelligence as a hugely important factor in health.\n\n- Artificial intelligence has great potential to increase the quality and reliability of healthcare services and make a difference from a preventive perspective,\" he said.\n\nDecommissioning, CI and energy\n\nThe UK and Norway have for many years already had a good and broad cooperation in areas such as trade, investment, politics and society. One field that is new to Smart Innovation Norway is decommissioning.\n\n- \"We launched our DECOM cluster in April last year, and several of our cluster members and stakeholders are already collaborating with UK companies on decommissioning. This can clearly be expanded,\" says CEO Kjell Reidar Mydske.\n\nMany of the companies in Smart Innovation Norway's incubator and three business clusters want to focus more on exports, and in this respect it is a positive signal that the UK Trade Commissioner for Europe is coming to Norway and prioritizing getting to know the Halden environment better.\n\nIn addition to Smart Innovation Norway, the Halden community consists of the Institute for Energy Technology, Østfold University College, eSmart Systems and Halden Municipality.\n\n- It shows that we are a leading player in our fields, and it is especially our expertise in artificial intelligence that makes us noticed internationally,\" says Mydske.\n\nHe used the visit to encourage the Trade Commissioner and the Embassy to participate in Smart Innovation Norway's arenas with the aim of increasing cooperation.\n\n- And then we hope to take some companies on a study visit to the UK to look at the opportunities for export and learning. That would be very exciting,\" says Kjell Reidar Mydske.\n\nREAD ALSO: Role of AI and IoT in a Renewable-Powered Future\n\n- Much of the development is happening in the UK\n\nNorway has several advantages when it comes to using artificial intelligence. Among other things, we have recognized research, innovation and education environments, a high degree of digitization in the public sector, and a large and good data base, which is a prerequisite for artificial intelligence.\n\nNORA (Norwegian Artificial Intelligence Research Consortium) is a gateway for international actors to these factors, and the UK is a priority partner for NORA.\n\n- \"A lot of the development in artificial intelligence is happening in the UK. They also have a lot of exciting companies that use artificial intelligence in many different areas,\" says Klas Pettersen, CEO.\n\nHe is keen to strengthen existing ties with the British, and an important partner is The Alan Touring Institute, a British organization similar to NORA.\n\n- In December we are organizing a conference together, and we want to strengthen our ongoing student exchange. It is also important for us to establish new research collaborations and look at how we can use research results in industry for the benefit of societal development, business and industry,\" says Pettersen."
