        "text": "Documentation in software development is not exactly the greatest of joys for many teams. Nevertheless, the documentation of a software product must of course be as complete and comprehensive as possible. The app AutoPage has set out to take much of the pain out of manual documentation work for teams. It makes it possible to automatically create Confluence pages directly from Jira on which the current contents of the processes are documented. In this post, we’ll go through the initial setup of AutoPage step by step. Once you have done these things, your team can use Jira as usual – with the difference that the further development is now automatically mapped in Confluence.\n\nIn the modern software world, it is absolutely impossible for development teams to always consider every single security angle. And therefore they have to face the inescapable reality that their code is vulnerable. The question is how the team deals with identified vulnerabilities. A new feature set in Jira helps them document, manage, prioritize and efficiently handle security issues in a centralized way.\n\nFlowDingo is not just any task management app. The result of a collaborative development effort between Seibert Media and Kantega SSO, the core of FlowDingo’s design is enabling teams to order tasks in a workflow, and then provide a visual overview of that flow within a ticket. It helps Jira users track the myriad of dependencies between an issue’s tasks. Now available for download in the Atlassian Marketplace, we think you’ll enjoy the functionality of an app that integrates many of the features of a full project management tool, without all the fuss. And it’s right within your Jira!\n\nRequesting things from your HR department can be quite time-consuming and annoying. Who do you need to contact if you want to go on a workation? Or how do you book the pool car that your company provides for its employees? We’ll show you how we Seibert Media do this through our Service Desk in Jira Service Management.\n\nNo matter whether you need access to the new software, want to request a well-deserved holiday or would like to reset your password – all of these service requests will need to be handled by your IT team. To fulfil your request as quickly and efficiently as possible, good Service Request Management is needed. In this blog article, you will find out what exactly this is and which best practices have emerged.\n\nFrom ideation in Jira Product Discovery (Beta) to delivery with Jira Software and support via Jira Service Management, Atlassian’s Jira suite offers a powerful collection of interconnected tools to help teams do their best work. Now Atlassian has released a tool that helps with all of this: Jira Product Discovery. This new tool is designed to help product managers and their teams prioritise and collaborate on product ideas in a structured way.\n\nFor countless software, IT and business teams in tens of thousands of companies, Atlassian products are virtually essential for survival. But they’re not the only tools these teams use, of course. All of these systems produce vast amounts of data – and organisations need ways to turn that data into the right insights to drive good decisions. To support data-driven decision-making, Atlassian last year introduced a feature set called Atlassian Analytics, which has now outgrown the beta stage and is available in the cloud enterprise plans for Jira Software, Jira Service Management and Confluence.\n\nModern IT teams strive to effectively support the company’s business processes by offering their services and tasks in the form of standardised services. The keyword is: IT Service Management, or ITSM for short. In the transformation towards ITSM, teams can fall back on a number of supporting concepts. In this context, the ITIL framework has established itself as a de facto standard that helps to establish ITSM according to a systematic approach. What is behind it?\n\nWe are seeing seismic shifts in the field of artificial intelligence these days. AI is poised to significantly change the way people work, and it has the potential to dramatically accelerate that work. Atlassian has been using machine learning to improve the user experience of its products for some time. Examples include personalised search results or recommendations when people are mentioned. At the recent customer and user conference Team ’23, Atlassian presented the new generation of AI technologies that are now being implemented in all Atlassian cloud products. This article shows you the possibilities.\n\nAt Seibert Media, we offer support for all our clients. To ensure they get the best service they can, our IT Service Management team has set up a robust system to make sure nothing falls through the cracks and our clients are helped as quickly and efficiently as possible."
