        "text": "1. ren IT-lidenskap Letizia Jaccheri The Little Doormaid www.letiziajaccheri.org Kantega Day 31st August 2016\n\n2. The doormat woman has a Degree in Physics, but she insists that she doesn’t understand a lot about bank accounts, she lets her husband deal with it, or her dad, or someone else.\n\n3. DOORY OPENER has only one precise and quantifiable goal on her mind: she has to save the anti-garbage algorithm. By rescuing it, she will not only save humanity from the garbage but also her doormat friend Sissi from the fear common to the doormat women, the fear of never being good enough. … Central element of the story is that LITTLE DOORMAID and DOORY OPENER are the same person, just like Donald Duck and Paperinik.\n\n4. One of her friends has developed an algorithm that is capable of eliminating all of the garbage from Earth. Sissi, the friend, caring mother, great intelligence and also great doormat woman is not aware of the geniality of her invention, so DOORY OPENER has to arrive in time to save her friend and the algorithm before someone steals it and invades the world with garbage.\n\n5. Through the other application, she concentrates on IVA AGGRESSI’s moves, a pandemic menace for all the women on earth. IVA AGGRESSI drives on the A4 motorway, directed to Turin, with a doormat young man inevitably by her side always agreeing with what she has to say, the anti- garbage algorithm must be destroyed. IVA AGGRESSI is 55,2 km from the target - Duca degli Abruzzi Avenue.\n\n6. DOORY OPENER goes back home in Livorno. In the elevator she lays the sleepy child on the floor, she changes her clothes, walks inside the house, gives Betta an aspirin and puts her in bed. The mission has lasted an hour because her dorky grey mobile phone rings. It’s Uncle Doormaid, his meeting has terminated so he calls her back. LITTLE DOORMAID tells him not to worry, Betta is feverish but she is in bed sleeping, the situation is under control. She can stay home; after all she hadn’t anything important to do today.

Med seg har hun spennende prosjekter og forskere som viser hvordan de har tatt i bruk sosial innovasjon, roboter og kunstig intelligens\n\n10. PhD student Sofia Papavlasopoulou"
