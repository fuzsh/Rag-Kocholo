        "text": "Use color, and more, to spice up your Gantt charts.\n\nChances are your company has several Jira projects going on at any given time, and each project team may have unique ways of handling tasks, managing time, assigning resources, etc. This is fine, on a project-to-project basis. But what happens when you want to view all those projects together, in a single Gantt chart? Suddenly, all those small differences don’t play well together — or, at least, they never used to.\n\nStructure.Gantt Slice-based Configurations change all that, by allowing you to create custom rules for specific sets of issues. So, if Project A uses different link types than Project B, that’s no problem. Or if Team A tracks progress differently from Team B, just add a unique configuration slice for each, and Structure.Gantt will handle the rest.\n\nOverride Existing Configuration Rules\n\nConfiguration slices enable you to override the overarching Gantt chart configuration for select issues. You can set unique configurations for work estimates, progress calculations, manual scheduling, dependency and link types, resource assignment, and task settings. You can create as many configuration slices for these as you need – so if some teams use manual scheduling, while others use automated scheduling, that’s perfectly fine. If some projects assign tasks to specific individuals, while others assign them to entire teams, no problem! If different parts of your company use different link types for dependencies, Structure.Gantt will put them all together.\n\nCustomize to your heart’s content. Just keep in mind that the behavior and appearance of each issue can only be configured by a single slice, and slices are run from top to bottom. So if your first slice sets up manual scheduling for all issues in Project A, while your second slice turns off manual scheduling for Epics, Epics from Project A will still be manually scheduled. If you want them automatically scheduled, you would need to reorder your slices.\n\nAdd Some Color\n\nWe’ve received lots of requests from users who want to assign unique colors to different projects, color-code their charts by assignee, or who firmly believe Epics should always be purple (for example). That all sounded great to us – so we made it happen. Now you can set a unique color for each slice. Go ahead and set unique colors for each project, make Epics purple, or just add a splash of color for the fun of it!\n\nOr, if you want to, you can stick with the default colors. We won’t judge.\n\nOmit Issues\n\nOne of the most useful features of the new Slice-based Configurations is the ability to completely remove issues from your Gantt chart. There are several reasons you may want to remove issues. Perhaps you want to remove data from a specific project or team. Or maybe you want to declutter your chart by removing small sub-tasks that don’t impact your schedule. Whatever the reason, simply create a new configuration slice and change its configuration to “Do Not Show.” The selected issues will be omitted from your Gantt chart and will have no impact on your timeline.\n\nA Few Other Exciting Changes\n\nWe’re obviously pretty excited about the new feature, but there are some other big changes in Structure.Gantt 1.3 worth noting:\n\nMultiple Link Types – Structure.Gantt now supports multiple link types per dependency type. So if some teams use “Blocks” while others prefer “Depends On” link types, they can play nicely together now!\n\nFilter by Resource – You can now filter your structure and Gantt chart by a specific resource, making it easier than ever to visualize workloads, resolve conflicts, and avoid overloading a particular resource.\n\nCopy Configurations – Creating new configurations just got a lot easier. Now you can start with an existing configuration, copy it, and customize it for a specific need – without losing the original configuration.\n\nWe packed more enhancements into this release (check them all out in our Release Notes), but you’re probably eager to check it out for yourself. Update Structure.Gantt today.\n\nA Few Final Notes\n\nStructure.Gantt 1.3 and above requires version 5.1 of Structure for Jira, and we recently addressed a few customer-reported issues in Structure.Gantt 1.3.1.\n\nStructure.Gantt 1.3 and above and Structure 5.0 and above remain Data Center approved.\n\nFinally, as you probably know, Structure.Gantt has been a free Structure extension since its introduction in February 2018. However, that will change when we introduce Structure.Gantt 2.0 — planned for sometime in Q2 2019.\n\nNot to worry: We are offering Structure.Gantt 1.x customers the opportunity to extend their free software license for 2 years, including free maintenance. To learn more about this offer and sign up for your free license, visit our Free License Request Page.\n\nIt’s an exciting time for us at ALM Works: We’re launching Structure Cloud at Atlassian Summit 2019 in Las Vegas.\n\nRecently, Igor Sereda, ALM Works founder and CEO, sat down with Ryan Spilken of The Adaptavist Atlassian Ecosystem Podcast to talk about the launch of our newest product: Structure Cloud. With this new product, we are bringing many of the features and capabilities of Structure for Jira to Jira Cloud users for the first time.\n\nA little background...\n\nStructure for Jira is one of the leading Jira apps available on the Atlassian Marketplace. It’s used by more than 4,000 of Atlassian’s customers worldwide.\n\nStructure Cloud helps project managers that work with Atlassian Cloud visualize, track and manage progress across Jira projects and teams. It does this with adaptable, user-defined issue hierarchies, presented in a familiar spreadsheet-like view of Jira issues.\n\n“With Structure, I eliminated the use of Excel for program management at my last company. Thankfully, I convinced my new employer to let us use it on Jira Cloud. I don’t know how I would have gotten along without it.\"\n\n-Mike Hayes, Program Manager, Motor Trend\n\nAnd cloud hosting is a great option for businesses using Jira. Since its inception, Jira Cloud has gone from zero to 75% of Atlassian's 50,000 customers and it now has data centers around the world.\n\nJira Cloud provides immediate access to software updates and new features; it offers optimized performance and elastic scale via AWS; and, of course, it cuts out the hassle of managing and maintaining servers.\n\nHere's the full interview...\n\nHere’s the full transcript of Ryan’s interview with Igor Sereda:\n\nRyan Spilken: We’ve got some big news from one of our close friends and partners, ALM Works, and here to join us to share that news is ALM Works’ CEO, Igor Sereda. Igor, thank you so much for joining us.\n\nIgor Sereda: Thanks for having me.\n\nRyan: Always a pleasure to see you, sir. Your most successful product is Structure. Tell us a little bit about what Structure is before you tell us about this cool news.\n\nIgor: Sure. Structure for Jira helps Atlassian’s largest customers visualize, track and manage multiple projects and teams, so it’s all about visibility and making decisions. We support that with a central feature that we introduced, a user-configurable, adaptable hierarchy of issues.\n\nRyan: And this is shown in what’s called a structure, which is a visual representation of the data that’s all in your Jira instance?\n\nIgor: Yes, exactly. We introduced this concept of a structure, which acts like a container where you can define the scope of the work, the issues that you are interested in, and then add some automation, add some rules, formulas, columns. Basically, create your own workspace where you can effectively see what’s happening, see some data, drill down into minor details where needed. That’s where the hierarchy plays out and then acts upon that data.\n\nRyan: Awesome. To this point, Structure has been a massive success but it’s only been on Server and that brings us to what we’re here to talk about today. Do you want to do it? Go ahead.\n\nIgor: So at this coming Summit, in April in Las Vegas, we’re going to be launching Structure Cloud. That has been a long time coming. It is very important for us, it’s an important release. We’re hoping to expand what we are able to do and basically have big plans for this.\n\nRyan: You say that Structure Cloud was a long time coming. How long did Structure Cloud take you to develop?\n\nIgor: So, we started about a year and a half ago. Actually, Atlassian has been pushing all the marketplace vendors very hard to create Cloud versions of their apps. We were planning for the market, trying to understand what it means for the whole project. Because, frankly, it’s a whole new system. Although it’s named the same and the ideas are the same, technically it’s different and, actually, we need to think about it as a next step.\n\nRyan: So, what kind of challenges did the team run into when making the next step in the Structure evolution?\n\nIgor: Speaking for most Atlassian app vendors, all of them run into this challenge of the APIs that are available for Jira Cloud or other Atlassian cloud products, they are less powerful, naturally, than the APIs that are available for Server. The apps run in the same process so they can access much more of the product’s functionality. We have features in Structure Server, like bulk cloning or walking some issues through a workflow. They would not be possible in Jira Cloud, at least not in the same way, so we had to find a way around that.\n\nFor us, it took so long because we had to make a serious investment in building the infrastructure. I’m probably pitying myself but it was like creating a whole new product from scratch. We started with research, with selecting technologies that would run our own cloud system, that will be able to scale and support large installations in a scalable manner, so we can grow as our customer base grows. And I hope that will pay us back sooner than later!\n\nRyan: Well, I think that it’s almost a shoo-in with the popularity of Structure Server, there are going to be Cloud users who are certainly interested. One thing that we talk about a lot on the podcast, that we joke about almost at this point, is, well, that’s a feature that’s on Data Center, or that’s a feature that’s on Cloud but it’s not on Server. So, does Structure Cloud have any neat little bells and whistles that our listeners should hear about that’s different from Structure Server?\n\nIgor: We are going to release Version 1. Version 1 is pretty much what we had in Structure Server Version 1. And the current version of Structure Server is 5.3. [So Structure Cloud is] pretty basic [for now]. That’s because we spent most of our time just building the system. The plan is to build new features pretty quickly during this year - and if not catch up with Structure Server, at least move all important features there. Automation, all the formulas, those are the cornerstones of Structure’s flexibility and power.\n\nHaving said that, there are some things that will be possible only on Structure Cloud. We caught on early on and that was one of the reasons we decided we needed to do that. For example, we could connect to multiple Jira [systems] and actually aggregate data and give visibility throughout the whole company, or maybe multiple companies, if that’s the case.\n\nRyan: Wow, that’s actually really, really interesting. That opens a very wide door for you.\n\nIgor: I hope so.\n\nRyan: I’m certain that it will. This is awesome. Congratulations on the big news. I hope all our listeners who are heading to Summit stop by the ALM Works booth and give Igor and Eugene and the whole ALM [Works] team, give them a hard time for us here at the podcast. We always look forward to seeing them and hanging out. But Igor, before we let you go, what’s next? What’s ALM [Works] got on the burner that we should know about?\n\nIgor: We are focused on this release right now: Structure Cloud Version 1. We’ll get it done, [then] we have a pretty aggressive backlog road map based on the backlog for [Structure] Cloud itself. We’re going to move our Gantt chart [solution], Structure.Gantt, to cloud as well. We’re going to start coding soon after the Version 1 release. We’re also releasing a new version of the Structure.Gantt for [Jira] Server. Version 1.4 will have special support for Agile [teams], so it’s going to be a sort of Agile Gantt chart.\n\nRyan: Agile Gantt. You heard it here first.\n\nIgor: And then we’ll follow with features that work around resource management - resource leveling, constraint scheduling where we can actually help teams manage their time in the company, their availability.\n\nApart from that, we have this experimental idea that we’re going to be trying out at Summit. So if you’re there, please stop by and take a look at our predictive CFD [Cumulative Flow Diagrams] charts that will help people basically think about planning based on [historic] evidence in your Jira, without much analysis.\n\nRyan: Well Igor, thank you so much for your time today, we really appreciate you stopping by Adaptavist Live, and we look forward to seeing you at Summit. Thank you for sharing this news with us. And catch you in Vegas - well, I won’t, but Matthew and Brenda will be there, so you can say hi to them!\n\nIgor: Ryan, thanks a lot, it’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nConclusion\n\nLooking ahead, we’re very excited to see Structure coming to Jira Cloud - and to potentially see many more teams using our tools to manage and oversee their Jira projects.\n\nIf you’re interested in Structure for Jira Cloud (or Server or Data Center), you can find it on the Atlassian Marketplace. Ask your Jira administrator to install a free 30-day evaluation.\n\nIn the meantime, if you’re attending Atlassian Summit 2019 in Las Vegas, drop by our booth to see Structure Cloud for yourself! You can even request a meeting with us before you head to Vegas.\n\nWhen Henry Gantt first published his bar charts in the early 1900s, they were considered to be state-of-the-art. By listing tasks on a vertical axis and then showing the schedule for completing those tasks on a horizontal axis, project managers were able to help their teams more easily visualize the overall project at-a-glance. For wartime and industrial-age projects, the Gantt chart became a popular tool for ensuring massive projects were completed on time and on budget.\n\nProject, program and portfolio managers (collectively referred to as project managers) have pushed the evolution of the Gantt Chart over the last 100 years. From laboriously redrawing the chart each time the schedule changed, to the first software versions that allowed project managers to more easily add additional related information like project completion percentages, task assignments and the relationship between tasks.\n\nGantt charts also became a common tool to help project managers easily explain the status of important projects during board meetings. Management became skilled at reading Gantt charts and noticing “tent-pole” tasks that were extending project deadlines and troublesome “pre-reqs” that were causing delays. Unfortunately, Gantt charts sometimes told only part of the story and project managers were left trying to explain important details without having the necessary data readily available.\n\nKanbans and Waterfalls\n\nIn 2001, seventeen software development practitioners developed and published their Agile Manifesto.\n\nWhile the benefits of iterative and rapid development had been around for decades, the Agile Manifesto brought the concept of Agile software development to the mainstream.\n\nThe Agile Manifesto is rooted in four stated values:\n\nIndividual interactions over process and tools.\n\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation.\n\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation.\n\nResponding to change over following a plan.\n\nAs you can imagine, the only message many project managers paid attention to was, “no process, no plan, no documentation.” And the thought of losing those three control points caused them to break out into a cold sweat. Their livelihood was rooted in controlling projects. Even the Project Management Institute (PMI) highlighted “control” as one of its five phases of professional project management.\n\nRegardless of the early resistance from project managers, Agile methods started to take hold. At first, it was a grassroots effort using Scrum meetings and Kanban boards covered by a rainbow of sticky notes.\n\nOver a period of a few years, project managers started seeing elements of Agile creep into their project management software.\n\nHowever, a large percentage of project managers couldn’t figure out an effective way to incorporate Agile methods into their five-phase, waterfall approach to managing projects. How can the scope change when the CIO has already signed the requirements document?\n\nWhat followed was a period where confusion and conflict reigned in software development shops all over the world. Project managers were continuing to develop plans and schedules and reports based on a waterfall approach and software development teams were holding their own scrum meetings, creating Kanban boards, resisting documentation requests and recommending scope changes during development and testing phases.\n\nFortunately, as collaborative software developers like Atlassian came up with better ways to present data in a hybrid (Waterfall/Agile) way, project managers started to adapt.\n\nThey began to realize they could still create and assign tasks, they could still have a high-level schedule in place and they could still follow a general software development lifecycle (SDLC).\n\nAdditionally, they started to see the benefits they could realize by following an Agile approach. Best practices started to evolve very quickly at this point in time and project managers started demanding even more integration from their tools. But it was proving difficult to find the right mixture of Gantt-like visualization and Agile flexibility.\n\nAgile Gantt is the Next Evolutionary Phase\n\nAs Agile user stories, sprints, scrum meetings, and Kanban boards grew in popularity, the once-favored Gantt chart got lost in the mix. Because it had limited contextual data, it lost some of its magic.\n\nThen ALM Works and a handful of other vendors created the next evolution in Gantt technology, Gantt apps built for Jira.\n\nBuilt on Structure for Jira, one of the leading Jira apps on the Atlassian Marketplace, Structure.Gantt gives you the best of both worlds — a Gantt-style project timeline with dependencies and resource allocation highlights, purpose-built for Jira.\n\nAgile Gantt is an Inflection Point in the Industry\n\nInflection points that impact entire industries are rare. However, there is no question Agile Gantt is a true inflection point in the field of professional project management. Gantt charts have always been an outstanding way to visualize entire projects. From the work breakdown structure (WBS) to assignments to scheduled completion dates, the Gantt view is superior.\n\nStructure.Gantt has taken the foundational benefits of a Gantt chart and revolutionized the manner in which Agile teams will view, manage, interact and revise their project plans. In short, it is simply the new, best way to manage software development projects using an Agile methodology. Sophisticated, integrated and flexible.\n\nStructure.Gantt Offers Evolutionary Functionality\n\nStructure.Gantt 1.4 takes things to a new level. The most exciting new capability tightly couples the Gantt chart with sprint planning.\n\nIn an Agile environment, tasks are often assigned to a specific sprint, vs. a specific date. In Structure.Gantt, project managers can now use sprint dates for manual scheduling of tasks - so tasks can be scheduled to begin and end based on sprint dates.\n\nAnd of course, because it is built on top of Structure, project managers gain all the benefits of an elegant Gantt presentation, including work breakdown structures, estimates, timelines, progress bars, dependencies, and more.\n\nWhat’s more, since teams are often assigned several tasks that all need to be completed during a sprint but in no specific order, managing the workload for those teams has long been outside the reach for traditional Gantt charts.\n\nStructure.Gantt solves this problem too, with our new fixed-duration task management feature. As tasks are assigned, the workload for each task is divided evenly across its duration, allowing project managers to quickly identify and address overloads or opportunities within each sprint.\n\nAdjusting the dates for a fixed-duration task (or the sprint it’s assigned to) will not affect its work (that can be adjusted separately in the Task Details panel or in Jira itself).\n\nOf course, no Gantt solution could truly be called Agile if it required a ton of work to build a useful chart (we’ll leave that kind of chart-building to those old-school PMs!). Using the new Agile Gantt Chart template tool, project managers can create charts with Agile Planning enabled in just a few seconds. These charts can be customized to display the hierarchy that best fits their business needs:\n\nStories only\n\nStories beneath Epics\n\nPortfolio (requires Atlassian Portfolio to be installed) - with Initiatives above Epics\n\nSimply put, this is the answer project managers have been waiting for. They’ve realized there are significant benefits in using hardened tools like Gantt charts as well as new Agile methods like sprints. By fully integrating with Jira’s Agile features, Structure.Gantt evolves into something entirely new, while maintaining the already understood principles most project managers rely on to get their work done.\n\nAgile Gantt is the Evolution You’ve Been Waiting For\n\nStructure.Gantt provides project managers with the opportunity to continue to embrace the scheduling realities that are imposed on their projects by business-related deadlines, market competition, and budgetary constraints.\n\nAt the same time, it provides them with the necessary tools to get the most out of an Agile methodology. In fact, the manner in which Structure.Gantt integrates data from standard Jira data sources will become the new normal. Project managers will increase efficiency, reduce errors and improve overall product quality while experiencing the maximum power of the old and the new blended to perfection.\n\nWith Structure.Gantt you get the best of both worlds. Agile Gantt driven portfolio management, built on a Jira foundation. The evolution is complete.

Innovative and globally positioned, the company from Bruchsal in Baden-Württemberg relies on Atlassian solutions such as Jira, Confluence and Jira Service Desk in order to advance the digitization of knowledge and processes.\n\n“From the very beginning, I was convinced that we, as SMEs in every sector, must take advantage of digitization. As a comparatively small company, we are a speedboat - and we have to tackle such issues early.\"\n\n- COO CYNORA Michael Bächle\n\nCOO CYNORA Michael Bächle\n\nBefore implementing the Atlassian tools, there was OneNote, Excel and a lot of email for communication and project control. Michael Bächle, COO, realized early on that this rather classic-looking setup was unsuitable for the digital future of the company. After all, factors such as transparency, collaboration, business intelligence based on real-time data, and digital project and task management are inevitably missed out. In a nutshell, SMEs, in particular, can profit in many ways from the challenge of digitization. Just as this story will show.\n\nDigitization of processes and knowledge at CYNORA\n\nExamples from the project:\n\nResearch project management: Previously handled in OneNote, they now use an integrated system of Jira and Confluence, with links to in-house databases. For this purpose, a new app has been developed: the Resource Manager for Jira. Find out more below.\n\nEmployee care: Jira Service Desk along with additional tools for managing business travel and training requests. The ultimate goal is the gradual transformation to a fully-digitized service organization.\n\nTracking internal SW development: Jira and Bitbucket\n\nQM: Confluence intranet and draw.io for the mapping of the company processes\n\nSecurity lessons and eLearning: Confluence and the Stiltsoft App Course and Quizzes\n\nContact and employee directory: Confluence with Linchpin User Profiles\n\nCommunication: Confluence is used for:\n\nAn intranet and knowledge platform\n\nBlogging/microblogging\n\nCollaboration and project spaces\n\nMeeting Notes\n\n“Long-term success is largely ensured by the fact that new concepts are quickly integrated into internal processes and organizations are constantly evolving. This is the only way to gain an advantage in a highly competitive environment.\"\n\n- COO CYNORA Michael Bächle\n\nA short overview: CYNORA & demicon\n\nCYNORA is a leader in TADF (Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence) technology. The focus of the company is on highly efficient OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) systems. With a multidisciplinary team of more than 110 TADF experts, CYNORA has developed a robust IP portfolio with more than 150 granted patents and expects to reach 1,000 patents and patent applications in the next 2-3 years. CYNORA works closely with its customers in materials and device development.\n\nAs an Atlassian Platinum Solution Partner, demicon GmbH is one of the largest technical consulting teams and one of the leading Atlassian full-service providers in the DACH region. With locations in Stuttgart, Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich, they support their customers throughout Europe in digitizing their project management and business processes. This includes consulting, conception, training, support, configuration, managed AWS hosting as well as custom software development and license sales.\n\nAs an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner, they also create a highly available and scalable IT infrastructure with optimal system performance in the Amazon Web Services Cloud (AWS). This includes individual consulting, architecture and development of cloud infrastructures, as well as migration, automation and scalable hosting.\n\nSME digitization successfully staged\n\nScope and requirement workshop\n\nThe clear definition of goals is indispensable for the success of a project. This not only includes concrete goals to be achieved in the short and medium term, but also a more long-term vision. The successful cooperation of CYNORA and demicon GmbH was able to build on this foundation right from the start. After an essential requirement workshop to kick off, there were periodic feedback sessions with decision makers and continuous feedback across all stages of implementation.\n\n“It's refreshing to work with a company that wants to go iteratively. We are dealing with processes that affect the whole company. And yet we get results quickly. We try our ideas in a timely manner and everyone involved learns a lot. It's great that there is no fear of mistakes or feedback. It is true that holistic progress can be continuously developed.\"\n\n- Christoph Thomas, Digital Solution Agilist at demicon GmbH\n\nVision: No paper no pain\n\nAt CYNORA, it was clear from the outset that they wanted to digitize as many processes in the company as possible, while at the same time focusing on planning and collaboration on a new project and knowledge base. After the evaluation, it quickly became clear that this trend-setting approach, with as little paper, Excel and e-mails as possible, could be optimally achieved with Jira, Jira Service Desk and Confluence.\n\nConfluence, which was rolled out as a central knowledge platform, should serve as a cockpit for daily work. In order to combat mass notifications and CC emails in collaboration and projects, Confluence was not even connected to the mail server for notifications. In order to ensure an optimal user experience and an intuitive information architecture, the App Refined Theme for Confluence was used. This makes it easy to provide out-of-the-box Confluence with a suitable corporate design.\n\nChange: C-level, stakeholders and decision makers\n\nIn every change project, there is always the challenge of questioning established structures. Often companies, especially those that have been successful in the market for a long time, find it difficult to do so. That is only too understandable since superficially all numbers are correct. In times of digital disruptions, however, the certainties of the past are on shaky ground. Against this background, the willingness to change at C-level is absolutely critical to success. Using the example of CYNORA, it becomes clear what a positive impact it has when decision makers such as COO Michael Bächle are among the relevant drivers. An important piece of advice: Always identify stakeholders early and get them on board.\n\nEmployees in focus, create acceptance\n\nEven though the digitization project was actively promoted by the management from the outset, it was always important to keep the focus on rolling out the tools in a step-by-step manner. A clear recommendation: Pay close attention to the fact that in each case very concrete measures are taken, which offer the employees an added value for their daily work. Change projects have a far greater chance of succeeding if uncompromisingly open communication and a user-centered approach is pursued.\n\nCultural and process change\n\nInevitably, implementing these new tools will also change collaboration in a company. This starts with the collaborative use of Confluence, Jira & Co. and echoes the way employees communicate with each other on a daily basis. Therefore, it is only appropriate to equate the digital transformation with a \"cultural journey\". It should be understood that tools for agile and collaborative work do not automatically make a business agile and improve collaboration. The change of the corporate culture towards a more open system must be taken one step at a time and is usually a challenge for all participants. However, one that turns out to be extremely rewarding in the end.\n\nOnce all the stakeholders are on board, it is worthwhile to visualize and clearly document the existing processes. In this project, this was done using the Confluence app draw.io. In the holistic approach of demicon, process analysis and consulting with a sense of proportion was carried out in this step in order to digitize only the really lived processes.\n\nApp spotlight: Resource Manager for Jira\n\nAt CYNORA, new and innovative projects are constantly being initiated in research. This ranges from materials research to the construction of devices to testing molecules and measuring their properties. Such projects require certain resources including personnel, equipment, and laboratories. These must be predictable according to prioritization and dependencies on the individual tasks. A control on the basis of people/time is therefore not sufficient.\n\nBecause no existing add-ons from the Atlassian Marketplace provided an appropriate solution, a custom extension of the software was developed according to a proof of concept (PoC). The new Resource Manager for Jira app now allows resource planning to be done on a time-by-thing basis instead of time-based resources. A process can always require several resources, even at specific points over its duration.\n\nWith the help of appropriate dashboards, all research tasks can be approved by the Steering Committee and the results reviewed. The result: real-time controlling and sustainable planning for research project management.\n\nPlease contact us if you would like to know more about the Resource Manager for Jira.\n\nWhat's next? An outlook without emails\n\nIt is important to realize that digital transformation is not a project that starts today and will be completed tomorrow. Also with regard to acceptance by the employees, gradual development of the digital tools on an ongoing basis is absolutely necessary.\n\nAt CYNORA, the next steps on this path are already planned. Other software tools are to be integrated, and the management of the research projects should be further developed. The resource management app developed by demicon is also undergoing continuous development.\n\nIn addition, a number of other processes are still waiting for their paperless equivalent in Jira and Jira Service Desk. It is clear that the goal of daily business processes and research and project management without many emails cannot be achieved overnight. But: only those who set out on the path can achieve it.\n\n“My recommendation is to work with experts right from the start and achieve quick success. With Christoph Thomas from demicon GmbH, we have had a true Atlassian professional at our side right from the start, who has guided us to the goal with know-how and circumspection and accompanied us in the continuous development.\"\n\n- COO Michael Bächle\n\nAtlassian apps in action\n\nMany of the tasks necessary for a digital transformation can be managed using just Atlassian tools, including Jira, Jira Service Desk and Confluence. In practice, however, there is hardly an Atlassian toolchain without extensions (apps) from the Atlassian Marketplace. For every scenario, small and large helpers can be found here. These apps are developed and deployed by third-party vendors. With over 3,000 partly similar and very different solutions, the right selection in the \"app jungle\" requires good orientation. As an Atlassian Platinum Solution Partner, demicon has the experience necessary to make the right choice for their clients. In addition, they are partners with many of the mentioned manufacturers and therefore have a direct line.\n\nExamples of the apps used by CYNORA:\n\nJira and Jira Service Desk\n\nStructure for Jira by ALM Works\n\nStructure.Gantt by ALM Works\n\neazyBI Reports and Charts for Jira by eazyBI\n\nScriptRunner for Jira by Adaptavist\n\nRefined for Jira Service Desk by Refined\n\nExtension for Jira Service Desk by Deviniti\n\nJSU - Utilities Suite for Jira by beecom\n\nKantega SSO, SAML / Kerberos for Jira by Kantega SSO\n\nConfluence\n\nKantega SSO, SAML / Kerberos, Confluence by Kantega SSO\n\nRefined for Confluence by Refined\n\nComala Canvas for Confluence Server by Comalatech\n\nLinchpin User Profiles by // SEIBERT / MEDIA\n\nMicroblogging for Confluence by // SEIBERT / MEDIA\n\nPolls for Confluence by Mohami\n\ndraw.io Diagrams for Confluence by // SEIBERT / MEDIA\n\nSelecting the right apps to use is not always easy.

Reach out to ALM Works to learn more via: info@almworks.com\n\nBuilding upon the integration Adaptavist and ALM Works created between ScriptRunner and Structure, we are happy to share a collection of Structure-specific scripts in the Adaptavist Library.\n\nHere’s some background: ScriptRunner allows you to automate manual work that can take up a fair bit of time, and do it without introducing human error.\n\nFor example, we recently had the opportunity to work with a customer who wanted to share the power of Structure from one business group to 50+ groups in his company. Instead of manually recreating the structures he’d already built, we worked with him to write a series of ScriptRunner scripts, which allowed him to replicate the structures across all the business groups by altering just one element of his Structure Automation Rules (in this case, the “project =” portion of the Inserter JQL).\n\nThis accelerated the rollout of Structure to the rest of the company’s project managers since each PM now had proven, tailored-for-them structures to work with. This also made it easier for them to conceptualize the power of Structure in a very tangible and relevant way. Through this roll-out process, they were able to get started with relevant, personalized structures with little-to-no effort, easily seeing what Structure could accomplish as they added additional custom structures.\n\nFurthermore, the scripts served as an easy way to reset any (or all) of the structures that were built, since they could easily be copied, deleted or recreated at the press of a button.\n\nHere’s how we did it.\n\nWe first took an existing structure and worked with our customer to identify the essential elements that he wanted to share with the other groups.\n\nNext we looked at how he wanted to extend this further. In this particular case, he wanted to tie each Team to a Project. So we created a list to iterate through.\n\nThen we used the Structure-scripts in the Adaptavist Library to build a single master script for this use-case, turning his structures into templates if you will.\n\nWe then tested his script on our own testing instance to make sure it worked as expected. Once everyone was satisfied with the work and testing, we rolled it into the customer’s production environment.\n\nNow he has means to build and roll out more structures as new Teams and Projects get added to the company portfolio, or to share useful structures with the entire organization without needing everyone to manually rebuild them.\n\nThere’s more: The folks over at Adaptavist have written a deeper dive blog post about the Structure scripts in the Library with a few excellent use-cases of their own. We will continue working with them in the coming months to add new Structure-specific scripts to their library as each of us uncovers new customer use cases for ScriptRunner & Structure.\n\nIf you have script ideas you’d like to share, or if there are Structure/ScriptRunner uses cases you’d like to explore, you can reach me via email. I’d love to hear from you.\n\nCheck out the Structure scripts in Library for yourself.\n\nWhat Every Organization Wants to Know\n\nAs a project manager, you field questions all day. Leadership asks, “When will I see a return on our investments?” Stakeholders ask, “What can we do right now to help improve outcomes later?” When you manage portfolio-level projects, answering these questions accurately can easily eat up your week.\n\nStructure for Jira helps by collecting all of your project data in one place – across all the contributing teams and backlogs in Jira. Now it can use that data to help you predict completion dates, per project and per team.\n\nStructured Predictions Provides Answers\n\nIn the age of Agile, one of the major problems for large-scale project planning is that not all of the requirements (normally contained in user stories) are known ahead of time. Agile teams create user stories through the grooming process, just in time for the next sprint. Structured Predictions uses the data in a structure to develop team profiles that predicts how many additional stories a team is likely to generate before they are in Jira, anticipates team performance, and estimates target completion dates for each team.\n\nLet’s see what that looks like. Imagine we have a structure that represents an initiative the organization is trying to deliver by a certain date. It has a bunch of epics per contributing team, and those epics may or may not be groomed into stories. Here’s a snippet of what that structure might look like:\n\nAll the data from all the teams are in one place for the initiative, but it doesn’t answer the question, “when will it be done?” To get that answer, let’s connect Structured Predictions to our structure. Here is what we get:\n\nPredicted Completion Dates by Team with ALM Works Structure for Jira\n\n1. Historical Cumulative Flow Diagram\n\nThis section of the graph shows the historical cumulative flow diagram (CFD) of past workflow transitions and ticket inventory to the current day. The \"Y\" axis of the CFD shows the number of issues and the \"X\" axis shows the dates. The points on the graph show the date at which an issue was in a specific workflow state. Areas of the graph representing different states are color-coded.\n\nBlue—work that is still to do (in the backlog)\n\nYellow—work that is in progress\n\nGreen—work that is done\n\nBy plotting all of the issue transitions for the project, the graph shows a historical representation of project progress. The slope of each workflow state represents the rate at which work is being created and completed for a project. See the section \"Reading Cumulative Flow Diagrams\" below for more information on how to assess project history and health.\n\n2. Predicted Stories\n\nThe steep cliff in the \"To do\" area of the graph at the line labeled \"Today\" (see 4) is the result of the Structured Predictions algorithm predicting the number of additional stories to be added to the project. The predicted stories are added to the known project scope (the scope that is defined in Jira) at the current date, \"Today\".\n\n3. Estimated Completion Dates\n\nThe completion date is predicted by running the team's performance model (described above) against the remaining scope defined in Jira plus the additional scope predicted by the algorithm for the team.\n\n4. Today and Target Lines\n\nThe Today line represents the transition point of the graph from a traditional, historical cumulative flow diagram to a predictive cumulative flow diagram. The portion of the graph to the right of the Today line represents the simulated future for each team working on the delivery. Teams that are predicted to finish after the Target date (which you provide during configuration) are flagged in red in the Metrics table to the right of the graph.\n\n5. Team Metrics\n\nThe Metrics section breaks down the key stats by team. There are six columns of data for each team, which provide some visibility into the underlying data that informs the predictions. This includes throughput by team, estimated future scope creation, and predicted completion dates by team.\n\nSelecting a team in the metrics table changes the graph to show the predicted cumulative flow diagram (PCFD) for that team only. Here we have selected Team T32, and the graph now shows only that team’s performance for the initiative managed by our structure:\n\nSimulate Future Initiatives Using Your Historical Data\n\nStructured Predictions uses the team performance data identified by the structure you’ve connected to it. But what if you are starting a new initiative and no stories have been defined and no work has been done yet? If you have an epic level scoping of the initiative, you can still use Structured Predictions to supply end dates, by team. It will then use historical data about those teams to simulate the completion of the new, planned initiative.\n\nLet’s say you have a structure that contains only epic level requirement definitions for each contributing team:\n\nNone of these epics have any defined stories, and no team has done any work for the initiative yet. Using a historical structure to supply the team performance data, here is what a 100% simulated initiative looks like using Structured Predictions:\n\nHere we see which teams are predicted to generate the majority of scope, what throughput each team is likely to achieve, and what date they might complete their work. We recommend using this data to inform the conversation about what targets dates they can realistically set. Once those target dates are set, Structured Predictions can be used to track against those dates and take action early in the SDLC to mitigate risks.\n\nHow Do I Get Structured Predictions?\n\nStructured Predictions is a solution from ALM Works that includes software and expert consulting services. Our team’s expertise is essential to ensure your configuration and usage will deliver the best possible projected delivery dates. It’s available via the ALM Works solutions team.\n\nOur solutions group will walk you through:\n\nReview and support to help you optimize your Jira configuration for the best possible predictions\n\nTraining for your key users\n\nProcess integration support specific to your SDLC\n\nIf you’re interested in Structured Predictions, contact the ALM Works solutions team via email at solutions@almworks.com. We’ll be happy to discuss your unique requirements and pricing.\n\nBackground\n\nThose of you who are familiar with our flagship product, Structure for Jira, know that we offer some optional capabilities in the form of Structure extensions. These are optional apps that you may install and use together with Structure, or not, depending on your needs. For example, Structure.Pages adds Confluence integration to Structure. Introduced in 2016, it’s useful in any organization that uses Confluence and Jira (and Structure). But if you don’t use Confluence, you aren’t going to be interested.\n\nIn February 2018, we introduced our newest extension for Structure called Structure.Gantt. As the name implies, it’s a Gantt solution for Jira that runs on top of Structure. When we introduced it, we announced that it would initially be free, given that it was a comparatively new Gantt solution for Jira. We also suggested that it would not be free forever. That day has arrived.\n\nIn addition, there are two major new features in 2.0, which we think you’re going to want to know about.\n\nNo Longer Free\n\nSince its introduction, we have continued to invest in Structure.Gantt — continuously adding new capabilities while also enhancing many of the early features. We have also uniquely tailored our Gantt solution to the world of agile SDLCs.\n\nNow, with the introduction of Structure.Gantt 2.0, we have taken things to yet another level. One that we feel makes our Gantt offering for Jira uniquely competitive — and one that warrants a fair price that will enable us to continue investing in its development.\n\nWe believe you will agree.\n\nEven so, to make the free-to-paid-app transition a bit easier for our existing customers, we offered them a two-year extension for their free Structure.Gantt licenses. Within a day or two of the release, customers who registered for the free 2-year license will receive instructions via the ALM Works Service Desk ticket that they opened when they registered.\n\nSo what will Structure.Gantt cost? Well, the full price list for Structure.Gantt 2.0 will be available via the Atlassian Marketplace the day that we release version 2, but here’s a preview:\n\nJira Users Server Price Data Center Price 50 $550 $550 100 $1,000 $1,000 10,000 $4,800 $6,000\n\nNote: Unfortunately, Structure.Gantt is not yet available for Jira Cloud. However, work has recently begun on a Cloud version. Stay tuned.\n\nAbout Those Important New Features\n\nThere are two very important new features in Structure.Gantt: Resource Leveling and Baselines. Both have been in high demand from our existing users.\n\nResource Leveling\n\nIn A Guide to the Project Management by the Project Management Institute, resource leveling is described as \"A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource limitations with the goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply.\" Pretty simple, right?\n\nSoftware developers and other project team members frequently contribute to more than one project — simultaneously. And those commitments change — frequently. Keeping track of these changing one-to-many/resources-to-projects relationships is tricky, to say the least.\n\nFor those organizations that use Jira to help track these things, being able to visualize resource allocation is super helpful for project managers. Structure alone (without the Structure.Gantt extension) enables you to see what’s happening on a spreadsheet-like canvas where your columns can contain resource-related data expressed in text, number, and wiki markup form.\n\nLike other Gantt solutions, Structure.Gantt enables you to visualize resource allocation on a Gantt chart. In version 2.0 you’ll also be able to auto-calculate the schedule changes needed to resolve over allocation and see the impact to your timelines.\n\nStructure.Gantt Highlights Area Where Overallocation Exists\n\nStructure.Gantt Resource Leveling Automatically Adjusts the Schedule\n\nYou can learn more about Resource Leveling by having a look at our Structure.Gantt documentation.\n\nBaselines\n\nAnother oft-requested new feature has been Baselines. Baselines allow you to visually compare the project schedule as it looks today with the way it looked at some point in the past.\n\nThis means you can visually compare the current project timeline to a previously saved snapshot, or compare one view of the project with another (e.g., the project manager's view to the development team's view).\n\nThe new Baseline feature Structure.Gantt 2.0\n\nBy creating a snapshot of the Gantt chart at a particular moment in time, and then placing it alongside the current chart, you can see at a glance which tasks are behind or ahead of a reference schedule — and how that impacts the project's timeline.\n\nYou can learn more about Baselines by having a look at our Structure.Gantt documentation.\n\nNew Pricing for Structure.Pages\n\nOn a related note, we are using this opportunity to announce important pricing changes for Structure.Pages as well — we are reducing its price significantly (by 50% at most user tiers).\n\nWhy? When we released Structure.Pages, we felt it was a powerful Structure extension for large organizations that use both Confluence and Jira (and Structure) extensively. However, we have come to believe it can also be very useful for smaller organizations that may use these tools less extensively.\n\nThe new pricing makes Structure.Pages more affordable for these organizations (and the larger ones, too).\n\nNext Steps\n\nTo learn more about Structure.Gantt, visit its page on the Atlassian Marketplace. If you want to be notified about the forthcoming release of Structure.Gantt 2.0, you can select “Watch app” on that page. Alternatively, you can send a note to gantt@almworks.com and ask us to notify you.\n\nTo learn more about the new pricing for Structure.Pages, visit its page on the Atlassian Marketplace."
