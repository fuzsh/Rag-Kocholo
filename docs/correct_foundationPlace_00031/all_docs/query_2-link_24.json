        "text": "At AI+, Ida Ryland and Dharshini Tharmarajan will share insights on how Computas has helped clients create business value with generative AI in their keynote “From hype to applied AI – Real AI examples from Norwegian businesses”.\n\nComputas, a Nordic IT and AI solutions provider, pioneered applied artificial intelligence in Norway. Today the employees have developed a strong expertise not only on AI, but also cloud technology, big data and application development. The company delivers value-adding solutions benefiting the public for both the public and private sector, and their expertise lies especially in public administration, health, energy and logistics.\n\nOur interdisciplinary teams offer the expertise required throughout the digitization process. We work closely with our customers to develop tailor-made solutions with high usability.\n\nIda Ryland, CTO Computas Trondheim\n\nComputas was established in Norway in 1985, initially as a subsidiary of Det Norske Veritas (now DNV GL) working with AI. Today the company is 100% owned by its 350 employees, and has offices in Oslo, Trondheim, Malmø, Copenhagen and Bucharest.\n\nWatch the video about the story of Computas – which also gives an overview of AI’s history\n\nHow do you use AI in the company?\n\nTell us about a recent AI-related success story from your company or an exciting project you are working on.\n\nWe are working on several interesting AI-projects for our customers, many of them using generative AI. For example, Computas recently helped a company streamline sales orders that come in by email. This customer received many orders on a daily basis that employees had to manually enter into their system. With the help of generative AI, we could take unstructured data from these emails (for example name of customer, ordered products, number of items, delivery information etc.), structure it using a LLM, and automatically enter the structured data into their order system. This now saves the customer hours of manual labour.\n\nAnother interesting case we are currently working on is helping a customer responsible for maintenance of critical infrastructure. They want to use generative AI to recognize patterns and abnormalities from video content, which could give them automatic notifications on equipment malfunction or maintenance needs.\n\nWhat goals does the company have for the future?\n\nWe want people to experience Computas as a company that takes part in creating meaningful solutions for people, for society and for customers – in a way that creates excitement! Digitalization and AI is an important part of the solution, and we want to help our customers succeed with innovative, efficient and ethical use of AI.\n\nWe are coming to AI+ as a platinum sponsor for the second year in the row and are very excited! Last year’s conference was great, and we have big expectations for this year as well. We do this because AI is more relevant than ever. Not only do we want to share our expertise and experience, we are also eager to learn from others that we’ll meet at AI+!\n\nComputas is a platinum sponsor at AI+ 2024.\n\nRecent AI+ news"
