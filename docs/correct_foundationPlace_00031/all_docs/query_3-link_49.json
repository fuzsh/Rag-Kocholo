        "text": "When German lighting manufacturer, CYNORA, realized they needed to move beyond their old project management solutions of Excel and email, they asked Atlassian Platinum Solution Partner, demicon GmbH, to help them create a fully-digital solution that would meet the unique demands of every team. Their solution: a carefully-configured integration of Jira, Confluence, and a variety of marketplace apps, including Structure and Structure.Gantt.\n\nCYNORA is a classic hidden champion of the German middle class with nearly 125 employees. Innovative and globally positioned, the company from Bruchsal in Baden-Württemberg relies on Atlassian solutions such as Jira, Confluence and Jira Service Desk in order to advance the digitization of knowledge and processes.\n\n“From the very beginning, I was convinced that we, as SMEs in every sector, must take advantage of digitization. As a comparatively small company, we are a speedboat - and we have to tackle such issues early.\"\n\n- COO CYNORA Michael Bächle\n\nCOO CYNORA Michael Bächle\n\nBefore implementing the Atlassian tools, there was OneNote, Excel and a lot of email for communication and project control. Michael Bächle, COO, realized early on that this rather classic-looking setup was unsuitable for the digital future of the company. After all, factors such as transparency, collaboration, business intelligence based on real-time data, and digital project and task management are inevitably missed out. In a nutshell, SMEs, in particular, can profit in many ways from the challenge of digitization. Just as this story will show.\n\nDigitization of processes and knowledge at CYNORA\n\nExamples from the project:\n\nResearch project management: Previously handled in OneNote, they now use an integrated system of Jira and Confluence, with links to in-house databases. For this purpose, a new app has been developed: the Resource Manager for Jira. Find out more below.\n\nEmployee care: Jira Service Desk along with additional tools for managing business travel and training requests. The ultimate goal is the gradual transformation to a fully-digitized service organization.\n\nTracking internal SW development: Jira and Bitbucket\n\nQM: Confluence intranet and draw.io for the mapping of the company processes\n\nSecurity lessons and eLearning: Confluence and the Stiltsoft App Course and Quizzes\n\nContact and employee directory: Confluence with Linchpin User Profiles\n\nCommunication: Confluence is used for:\n\nAn intranet and knowledge platform\n\nBlogging/microblogging\n\nCollaboration and project spaces\n\nMeeting Notes\n\n“Long-term success is largely ensured by the fact that new concepts are quickly integrated into internal processes and organizations are constantly evolving. This is the only way to gain an advantage in a highly competitive environment.\"\n\n- COO CYNORA Michael Bächle\n\nA short overview: CYNORA & demicon\n\nCYNORA is a leader in TADF (Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence) technology. The focus of the company is on highly efficient OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) systems. With a multidisciplinary team of more than 110 TADF experts, CYNORA has developed a robust IP portfolio with more than 150 granted patents and expects to reach 1,000 patents and patent applications in the next 2-3 years. CYNORA works closely with its customers in materials and device development.\n\nAs an Atlassian Platinum Solution Partner, demicon GmbH is one of the largest technical consulting teams and one of the leading Atlassian full-service providers in the DACH region. With locations in Stuttgart, Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich, they support their customers throughout Europe in digitizing their project management and business processes. This includes consulting, conception, training, support, configuration, managed AWS hosting as well as custom software development and license sales.\n\nAs an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner, they also create a highly available and scalable IT infrastructure with optimal system performance in the Amazon Web Services Cloud (AWS). This includes individual consulting, architecture and development of cloud infrastructures, as well as migration, automation and scalable hosting.\n\nSME digitization successfully staged\n\nScope and requirement workshop\n\nThe clear definition of goals is indispensable for the success of a project. This not only includes concrete goals to be achieved in the short and medium term, but also a more long-term vision. The successful cooperation of CYNORA and demicon GmbH was able to build on this foundation right from the start. After an essential requirement workshop to kick off, there were periodic feedback sessions with decision makers and continuous feedback across all stages of implementation.\n\n“It's refreshing to work with a company that wants to go iteratively. We are dealing with processes that affect the whole company. And yet we get results quickly. We try our ideas in a timely manner and everyone involved learns a lot. It's great that there is no fear of mistakes or feedback. It is true that holistic progress can be continuously developed.\"\n\n- Christoph Thomas, Digital Solution Agilist at demicon GmbH\n\nVision: No paper no pain\n\nAt CYNORA, it was clear from the outset that they wanted to digitize as many processes in the company as possible, while at the same time focusing on planning and collaboration on a new project and knowledge base. After the evaluation, it quickly became clear that this trend-setting approach, with as little paper, Excel and e-mails as possible, could be optimally achieved with Jira, Jira Service Desk and Confluence.\n\nConfluence, which was rolled out as a central knowledge platform, should serve as a cockpit for daily work. In order to combat mass notifications and CC emails in collaboration and projects, Confluence was not even connected to the mail server for notifications. In order to ensure an optimal user experience and an intuitive information architecture, the App Refined Theme for Confluence was used. This makes it easy to provide out-of-the-box Confluence with a suitable corporate design.\n\nChange: C-level, stakeholders and decision makers\n\nIn every change project, there is always the challenge of questioning established structures. Often companies, especially those that have been successful in the market for a long time, find it difficult to do so. That is only too understandable since superficially all numbers are correct. In times of digital disruptions, however, the certainties of the past are on shaky ground. Against this background, the willingness to change at C-level is absolutely critical to success. Using the example of CYNORA, it becomes clear what a positive impact it has when decision makers such as COO Michael Bächle are among the relevant drivers. An important piece of advice: Always identify stakeholders early and get them on board.\n\nEmployees in focus, create acceptance\n\nEven though the digitization project was actively promoted by the management from the outset, it was always important to keep the focus on rolling out the tools in a step-by-step manner. A clear recommendation: Pay close attention to the fact that in each case very concrete measures are taken, which offer the employees an added value for their daily work. Change projects have a far greater chance of succeeding if uncompromisingly open communication and a user-centered approach is pursued.\n\nCultural and process change\n\nInevitably, implementing these new tools will also change collaboration in a company. This starts with the collaborative use of Confluence, Jira & Co. and echoes the way employees communicate with each other on a daily basis. Therefore, it is only appropriate to equate the digital transformation with a \"cultural journey\". It should be understood that tools for agile and collaborative work do not automatically make a business agile and improve collaboration. The change of the corporate culture towards a more open system must be taken one step at a time and is usually a challenge for all participants. However, one that turns out to be extremely rewarding in the end.\n\nOnce all the stakeholders are on board, it is worthwhile to visualize and clearly document the existing processes. In this project, this was done using the Confluence app draw.io. In the holistic approach of demicon, process analysis and consulting with a sense of proportion was carried out in this step in order to digitize only the really lived processes.\n\nApp spotlight: Resource Manager for Jira\n\nAt CYNORA, new and innovative projects are constantly being initiated in research. This ranges from materials research to the construction of devices to testing molecules and measuring their properties. Such projects require certain resources including personnel, equipment, and laboratories. These must be predictable according to prioritization and dependencies on the individual tasks. A control on the basis of people/time is therefore not sufficient.\n\nBecause no existing add-ons from the Atlassian Marketplace provided an appropriate solution, a custom extension of the software was developed according to a proof of concept (PoC). The new Resource Manager for Jira app now allows resource planning to be done on a time-by-thing basis instead of time-based resources. A process can always require several resources, even at specific points over its duration.\n\nWith the help of appropriate dashboards, all research tasks can be approved by the Steering Committee and the results reviewed. The result: real-time controlling and sustainable planning for research project management.\n\nPlease contact us if you would like to know more about the Resource Manager for Jira.\n\nWhat's next? An outlook without emails\n\nIt is important to realize that digital transformation is not a project that starts today and will be completed tomorrow. Also with regard to acceptance by the employees, gradual development of the digital tools on an ongoing basis is absolutely necessary.\n\nAt CYNORA, the next steps on this path are already planned. Other software tools are to be integrated, and the management of the research projects should be further developed. The resource management app developed by demicon is also undergoing continuous development.\n\nIn addition, a number of other processes are still waiting for their paperless equivalent in Jira and Jira Service Desk. It is clear that the goal of daily business processes and research and project management without many emails cannot be achieved overnight. But: only those who set out on the path can achieve it.\n\n“My recommendation is to work with experts right from the start and achieve quick success. With Christoph Thomas from demicon GmbH, we have had a true Atlassian professional at our side right from the start, who has guided us to the goal with know-how and circumspection and accompanied us in the continuous development.\"\n\n- COO Michael Bächle\n\nAtlassian apps in action\n\nMany of the tasks necessary for a digital transformation can be managed using just Atlassian tools, including Jira, Jira Service Desk and Confluence. In practice, however, there is hardly an Atlassian toolchain without extensions (apps) from the Atlassian Marketplace. For every scenario, small and large helpers can be found here. These apps are developed and deployed by third-party vendors. With over 3,000 partly similar and very different solutions, the right selection in the \"app jungle\" requires good orientation. As an Atlassian Platinum Solution Partner, demicon has the experience necessary to make the right choice for their clients. In addition, they are partners with many of the mentioned manufacturers and therefore have a direct line.\n\nExamples of the apps used by CYNORA:\n\nJira and Jira Service Desk\n\nStructure for Jira by ALM Works\n\nStructure.Gantt by ALM Works\n\neazyBI Reports and Charts for Jira by eazyBI\n\nScriptRunner for Jira by Adaptavist\n\nRefined for Jira Service Desk by Refined\n\nExtension for Jira Service Desk by Deviniti\n\nJSU - Utilities Suite for Jira by beecom\n\nKantega SSO, SAML / Kerberos for Jira by Kantega SSO\n\nConfluence\n\nKantega SSO, SAML / Kerberos, Confluence by Kantega SSO\n\nRefined for Confluence by Refined\n\nComala Canvas for Confluence Server by Comalatech\n\nLinchpin User Profiles by // SEIBERT / MEDIA\n\nMicroblogging for Confluence by // SEIBERT / MEDIA\n\nPolls for Confluence by Mohami\n\ndraw.io Diagrams for Confluence by // SEIBERT / MEDIA\n\nSelecting the right apps to use is not always easy.
