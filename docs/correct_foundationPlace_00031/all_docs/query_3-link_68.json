        "text": "Ama Dablam Expedition\n\nTrekking to Everest Base Camp is a wonderful opportunity to honor Everest, the King of the Himalayas, and enjoy the classic view from Kallapather. Combining the Ama Dablam expedition with an Island Peak climb offers a unique perspective of Everest from its summit, providing a rewarding and memorable climbing experience.\n\nThe standard climbing route uses the Southwest Ridge, with a typical plan of three high camps: Camp One (5600m), Camp Two (5900m), and Camp Three (6200m), with Base Camp at 4500m. Camp Three lies on the ridgeâ€™s shoulder, just below and to the left of the final steep snow climb to the summit. In some years, Camp 2.7 is set up, hidden in a narrow corner on the Southwest Ridge between Camps Two and Three. Most climbers summit from Camp Two and do not establish Camp 2.7.\n\nClimbing Ama Dablam from South-west Route Camps:\n\nBase Camp (4600m/15092ft):\n\nAma Dablam Base Camp is one of the most significant grassy base camps in Nepal. It is rare to find such a favorable landscape at 4600 meters. Climbers often play volleyball and soccer at the camp to stay warm and enjoy the beautiful site. Base Camp will be set up here for almost 45 days during both the spring and autumn seasons. In the middle of the camp, you will have excellent views of Ama Dablam, Thamserku, Taboche, and Kongde.\n\nAma Dablamâ€™s camp is generally sunny due to its location; the sun rises early and stays late into the day. There are about 7-10 climbing teams each spring and fall season. The camp provides high-quality facilities for climbers, and we arrange climbing permits based on the climbing season. Our guides and staff are always ready to establish various departure dates as requested by climbers.\n\nCamp One (5700m/18,800ft) â€“ 5hrs:\n\nThe trek from Ama Dablam Base Camp to Camp One is mostly a hiking trail, with a short section of easy rock scrambling that is about 100 meters long. The trail ends near Camp One at a slope of 60 degrees. Along the way, you will encounter large rocks and climb a simple fourth-class section without fixed ropes. You will quickly learn that there are very few places to pitch a tent on Ama Dablamâ€™s Southwest Ridge, requiring coordination and sharing among climbers. There is space for only about 6-7 two-person tents and 6-7 single tents.\n\nCamp Two (5950m/19,521ft) â€“ 3hrs:\n\nThe move from Camp One to Camp Two is the most technical part of the route. You start the day by scrambling and climbing along a fourth-class level rock ridge around several peaks and gendarmes, gaining only 300 meters/1000 vertical feet. The exposure is significant, with large drop-offs on both sides of the ridge. The climbing is beautiful, with excellent quality rock.\n\nAt the end of the level ridge, you will climb the Yellow Tower for 6 meters, rated as French fourth class, British Severe, and North American YDS 5.5. Above the Yellow Tower, you will arrive at Camp Two on small ledges. Camp Two feels like a real high mountain camp, with exposure on all sides. Be careful when using the bathroom.\n\nCamp Three (6200m/20,341ft) â€“ 2hrs:\n\nThe climb from Camp Two to Camp Three transitions to mixed ice and snow terrain. This section also has fixed ropes along the entire distance. You will have great views of Ama Dablam Base Camp, Kusum Kanguru, and Kantega. It is now time to cross the infamous Mushroom Ridge at 6150 meters/20,300 feet. Looking up at Camp Three (6300 meters/20,800 feet), with the Dablam above, some strong climbers push for the summit from Camp Two.\n\nHowever, Touch The Himalaya will always set up Camp Three before the summit attempt. This section of the mountain is at high risk for avalanches, so minimizing time spent at this camp or bypassing it is essential. For clients not feeling strong enough to push from Camp Two, we typically spend about six hours here before starting the summit push. The route from the Yellow Tower to Camp Three is nearly 55 degrees of slope almost the entire way.\n\nSummit (6812m/22349ft) â€“ 10hrs:\n\nSummiting from Camp Three and returning to Camp Two takes most climbers around 10 hours. The summit day on Ama Dablam is an extraordinary one. Two straightforward pitches of dramatic yet firm snow ice (40 degrees or more) are climbed to the Dablamâ€™s side. When near the Dablam, you reach a fluted snowfield (30-50 degrees) that leads you to one of the worldâ€™s most stunning summits. The view from the top offers the best seat in the house to see the Khumbu, the center of high-altitude climbing. You are rewarded with panoramic views of Lhotse, Nuptse, Mount Everest, Cho Oyu, Pumori, Shishapangma, and Makalu.\n\nAccommodation during the Ama Dablam Expedition\n\nThe Ama Dablam Expedition is a 25-day journey. This expedition package includes three nights in a selected hotel in Kathmandu with breakfast. However, meals in Kathmandu are not covered.\n\nYou will spend 21 nights in the trekking regions. We provide five nightsâ€™ accommodation in rooms with attached bathrooms at Phakding, Namche (3N), and Lukla. Additionally, you will stay in standard rooms at Tengboche (2N) and Dingboche (2N) for a total of four nights. The remaining 12 nights will be spent in tented camps. All accommodations are on a twin-sharing basis.\n\nWe provide all camping equipment, including tents (dining, toilet, sleeping), tables and chairs, mattresses, and sleeping bags.\n\nMeals while climbing Ama Dablam\n\nDuring a high-altitude expedition like Ama Dablam, it is crucial to have nutritious, tasty, and hygienic food. We ensure you receive three meals each dayâ€”breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We select the best available lodges/teahouses/hotels that offer fresh, hygienic, and nutritious local or international meals.\n\nYou can choose from a variety of traditional, local, Asian, and Western cuisines. However, as you ascend, food choices become limited and more expensive.\n\nWe highly recommend consuming garlic soup and other liquids such as green tea, lemon tea, hot lemon, and ginger tea.\n\nPlease avoid dairy, alcoholic, and caffeinated items during the expedition, as experts recommend avoiding them for high-altitude adventures.\n\nOur expedition team includes experienced and highly qualified cooks and kitchen helpers at Base Camp and other camps. We provide kitchen and dining equipment for all camps.\n\nMeals (except breakfast) in Kathmandu are not included in the expedition package. In Kathmandu, you can enjoy a wide variety of Nepalese and international cuisine at fine dining restaurants, snack bars, and pubs.\n\nBest Seasons for Ama Dablam Expedition\n\nEquipment List for Ama Dablam Expedition 2024\n\nThe following gear is essential for the Ama Dablam Expedition.

Travel insurance is mandatory for this expedition. All members must provide a copy of their comprehensive travel insurance policy certificate to Touch The Himalaya, before starting the trek. The policy must cover medical and emergency repatriation, including helicopter rescue and evacuation expenses up to the highest expedition altitude.\n\nWe can recommend insurance companies based on previous client experiences, but we do not sell insurance policies. We may refuse expedition members who lack sufficient or proper travel insurance.\n\nExpedition members should send detailed insurance information after booking the expedition. In emergencies, we will use this information for quick and effective rescue operations and medical transfers.\n\nMake sure your insurance company covers the cost of mountain rescue services up to the highest expedition altitude. Verify with the insurer that helicopter rescue is included up to the highest altitude (6,000m) before purchasing the policy.\n\nPassport and Visa\n\nAll foreigners, except Indians, require a visa to enter Nepal. Most nationals can obtain an on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport or immigration checkpoints along the Nepal-India or Nepal-China border.\n\nFor a visa application, you need a passport with at least six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and visa application fees. The current cost is USD 50 for a 30-day stay.\n\nCitizens of China and SAARC countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives) are eligible for free visas. Citizens of certain countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Cameroon, Somalia, Liberia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Palestine, and Afghanistan, may not receive an on-arrival visa and should contact their local Nepalese embassy.
