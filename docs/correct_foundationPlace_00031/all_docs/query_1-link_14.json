        "text": "Howâs Life?\n\nNorway performs well in many dimensions of well-being relative to other countries in the Better Life Index. Norway outperforms the average in jobs, work-life balance, education, health, environmental quality, social connections, civic engagement, safety and life satisfaction. These assessments are based on available selected data.\n\nMoney, while it cannot buy happiness, is an important means to achieving higher living standards. In Norway, the average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is USD 39 144 a year, more than the OECD average of USD 30 490 a year.\n\nIn terms of employment, about 75% of people aged 15 to 64 in Norway have a paid job, above the OECD employment average of 66%. Some 77% of men are in paid work, compared with 73% of women. In Norway, 1% of employees work very long hours in paid work, below the OECD average of 10%, with 2% of men working very long hours in paid work compared with 1% of women.\n\nGood education and skills are important requisites for finding a job. In Norway, 82% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education, higher than the OECD average of 79%. However, completion varies slightly between men and women, as 82% of men have successfully completed high school compared with 83% of women. In terms of the quality of the education system, the average student scored 497 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). This score is higher than the OECD average of 488. On average in Norway, girls outperformed boys by 22 points, well above the average OECD gap of 5 points.\n\nIn terms of health, life expectancy at birth in Norway is around 83 years, two years higher than the OECD average of 81 years. Life expectancy for women is 85 years, compared with 81 for men. The level of atmospheric PM2.5 – tiny air pollutant particles small enough to enter and cause damage to the lungs – is 6.7 micrograms per cubic meter, below the OECD average of 14 micrograms per cubic meter. In Norway, 98% of people say they are satisfied with the quality of their water, higher than the OECD average of 84%.\n\nConcerning the public sphere, there is a strong sense of community and high levels of civic participation in Norway, where 96% of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in time of need, more than the OECD average of 91%. Voter turnout, a measure of citizens' participation in the political process, was 78% during recent elections, higher than the OECD average of 69%. Social and economic status can affect voting rates; voter turnout for the top 20% of the population is an estimated 81% and for the bottom 20% it is an estimated 76%.\n\nWhen asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10, Norwegians gave it a 7.3 grade on average, higher than the OECD average of 6.7.\n\nFor more information on estimates and years of reference, see FAQ section and BLI database.\n\nKey Findings\n\nHaving a job brings many important benefits, including: providing a source of income, improving social inclusion, fulfilling one's own aspirations, building self-esteem and developing skills and competencies. In Norway, about 75% of the working-age population aged 15 to 64 has a paid job. This figure is higher than the OECD employment average of 66%.\n\nUnemployed persons are defined as those who are not currently working but are willing to do so and actively searching for work. Long-term unemployment can have a large negative effect on feelings of well-being and self-worth and result in a loss of skills, further reducing employability. In Norway, the percentage of the labour force that has been unemployed for a year or longer is currently at nearly 0.9%, lower than the OECD average of 1.3%.\n\nThe wages and other monetary benefits that come with employment are an important aspect of job quality. Norwegians earn USD 55 780 per year on average, more than the OECD average of USD 49 165.\n\nAnother essential factor of employment quality is job security, in terms of expected loss of earnings when someone becomes unemployed. This includes how likely you are to lose your job, how long you are likely to remain unemployed and how much financial assistance you can expect from government. Workers facing a high risk of job loss are more vulnerable, especially in countries with smaller social safety nets. In Norway, workers face an expected 2.8% loss of earnings if they become unemployed, lower than the OECD average of 5.1%.\n\nFor more information on estimates and years of reference, see FAQ section and BLI database.\n\nBetter Policies for Better Lives\n\nAttracting migrant workers to rural areas\n\nIn Norway, regions face a challenge in building an infrastructure for expatriates. One example is the coastal county of Møre and Romsdal, where the largest town, Ålesund, has 45 000 inhabitants. Specialised in shipbuilding supplying the oil industry, local firms report a continuous shortage of engineers and other tertiary-educated workers, and is therefore interested in attracting new families.\n\nThe lifestyle in rural Norway suits some labour migrants but not others. Departure in the initial year is high. The county reports that if the migrant or family stays more than one year, they are likely to remain over time. Female labour migrants generally arrive single but settle if they find a partner. Male migrants tend to bring their families; once their children are in school, retention is high.\n\nThe Ålesund Chamber of Commerce in partnership with regional businesses and local authorities created an international school as a non-profit foundation. The Norwegian state pays 85% of the cost of the school, so tuition is a fraction of the cost of private schools in Oslo. The county has also pushed the municipal services in rural towns to be more proactive with new migrants, going out to welcome them upon arrival, identify their needs and help them. For spouses who arrive without employment, local firms are active in trying to identify possible employment for them.\n\nMore Resources\n\nHow's Life?: Measuring Well-being OECD Job Quality Database\n\nKey Findings\n\nA well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money. Norwegians can expect to go through 18.4 years of education between the ages of 5 and 39, similar to the OECD average of 18 years.\n\nGraduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market. In Norway, 82% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education, higher than the OECD average of 79%.\n\nBut graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. In 2018, PISA focused on examining students' reading ability, skills in maths and level in sciences, as research shows that these skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school.\n\nThe average student in Norway scored 497 in reading literacy, maths and sciences, above the OECD average of 488. The best-performing school systems manage to provide high-quality education to all students.\n\nBetter Policies for Better Lives\n\nFacilitating access to early childhood education and care\n\nNorway has implemented a number of reforms to help parents from low-income families put their children in kindergarten, giving young children better access to early childhood education and care (ECEC). The 2004-09 reform first introduced a regulation lowering fees by 35% across all kindergartens by 2014. Between 2004 and 2012, participation of 1-5 year-olds in ECEC increased markedly.\n\nIn 2015, a new regulation brought fees down to a maximum of 6% of family income for low-income families, reducing fees for families in need, while higher-income families paid the maximum fee. This was coupled with the right to 20 hours of free kindergarten per week for 3-5 year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nThese changes have not yet been fully evaluated, but it has been observed that the number of years in kindergarten is associated with children’s scores on literacy tests in first grade. Among children with at least four years of kindergarten, only 15% scored low, compared to nearly 40% of children with between 0-2 years in ECEC. The availability of free 20 hours per week of ECEC increased the participation of minority-language children by 15% and has already led to better results on mapping tests in the first and second grades compared to those who did not take part in the programme. These early results suggest that outcomes will continue to improve for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nTraining school leaders\n\nNorway introduced a leadership training and development programme in 2009 to improve the effectiveness of school leaders. The programme provides training to school leaders, with priority to those who have been in their position for less than two years. The training focuses on five key areas: pupils’ learning outcomes and learning environment, management and administration, co-operation and organisational development, development and change, and the leadership role. Based on experience and on evaluations of the programme, there is now greater involvement among school providers/owners and organisations of school leaders, greater integration of skills training, and more knowledge-sharing among participants.\n\nMore Resources\n\nHow's Life?: Measuring Well-being\n\nKey Findings\n\nThe quality of our local living environment has a direct impact on our health and well-being. Outdoor air pollution is one important environmental issue that directly affects the quality of people's lives. Despite national and international interventions and decreases in major pollutant emissions, the health impacts of urban air pollution continue to worsen, with air pollution set to become the top environmental cause of premature mortality globally by 2050. Air pollution in urban centres, often caused by transport and the use of small-scale burning of wood or coal, is linked to a range of health problems, from minor eye irritation to upper respiratory symptoms in the short-term and chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer in the long-term. Children and the elderly may be particularly vulnerable.\n\nPM2.5 – tiny particulate matter small enough to be inhaled into the deepest part of the lung – is monitored in OECD countries because it can harm human health and reduce life expectancy. In Norway, PM2.5 levels are 6.7 micrograms per cubic meter, much lower than the OECD average of 14 micrograms per cubic meter and lower than the annual guideline limit of 10 micrograms per cubic meter set by the World Health Organization.\n\nAccess to clean water is fundamental to human well-being. Despite significant progress in OECD countries in reducing water pollution, improvements in freshwater quality are not always easy to discern. In Norway, 98% of people say they are satisfied with water quality, one of the highest in the OECD, where the average is 84%.\n\nBetter Policies for Better Lives\n\nNorway leads the world in sales of electric vehicles\n\nThanks to assertive policy actions, Norway has the world’s highest percentage of sales of electric vehicles. In 2015, nearly 25% of cars sold were battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. High sales of electric vehicles must be seen in the context of Norway’s heavy taxes on vehicle purchases and fuels. The country’s high registration taxes are broadly based on vehicle emissions performance.\n\nThe Norwegian support scheme for electric vehicles, which began in 1990, includes road and congestion toll exemptions, free parking, zero VAT and access to dedicated bus lanes at given times. The first co-ordinated, nationwide roll-out of public charging infrastructure began in 2009-2010. By 2010, 2 800 new normal charging points were installed. Over the next five years, national government subsidies for public charging installation and operations were gradually devolved to local authorities. By 2016, more than 1 000 fast or “semi-fast” charging stations had been built, and more than 7 500 public charging points were in operation.\n\nDespite having already implemented the above policies for more than a decade, the growth in Norway’s sales shares of electric vehicles are a very recent and unforeseen phenomenon. The long-time lag may stem from the limited choice of models initially on offer, the slow improvement of the characterisics and cost competitiveness of electric vehicles, and delayed consumer response to embrace vehicles when they were initially introduced. Given the ongoing cost gap between electric and conventional cars and limited access to recharging infrastructure, the boom in Norway’s electric vehicle market would have not taken off without the government’s robust support policy.\n\nMore Resources\n\nHow's Life?: Measuring Well-being OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050\n\nKey Findings\n\nMost OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. Life expectancy at birth for the whole population in Norway stands at 83 years, two years above the OECD average of 81 years. Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher health care spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors).\n\nWhen asked \"How is your health in general?\" 75% of people in Norway reported to be in good health, more than the OECD average of 68%. Despite the subjective nature of this question, answers have been found to be a good predictor of people’s future health care use. Gender, age and social status may affect answers to this question.\n\nBetter Policies for Better Lives\n\nPrimary care in Oslo\n\nSeveral initiatives are underway in Oslo to respond to the challenge of meeting evolving primary health care needs.\n\nOslo has a GP-run, 32-bed, urgent care unit with the aim of avoiding admission to hospital for patients with a known diagnosis. The urgent care unit runs in parallel to a primary care emergency service (PCES) that runs a Clinical Decision Unit (CDU). Here, patients can stay up to 24 hours before decision to admit or to send home must be taken. Around 20% are admitted; Oslo municipality estimates that this figure would be around 80% without the CDU. Oslo's emergency primary care unit also offers emergency social services such as arranging accommodation for homeless individuals or counselling for victims of assault. Around 23 000 contacts per year are made, signalling a huge demand. Finally, Oslo has an innovative unit where elderly can self-refer for nursing care. Patients often self-refer for social care and occasionally for clinical care as well (for example when they have flu-like symptoms). The unit is nurse run and patients can be referred onward for specialist clinical care if needed. This has proved popular and anecdotal evidence states that patients who have been once are reassured by its presence and tend not to overuse.\n\nAccelerating diagnosis\n\nNorway's Oslo University Hospital has greatly reduced the waiting time for breast cancer diagnosis to lessen patient levels of anxiety and uncertainty. The hospital used design-driven innovation methods to identify logistical and organisational inefficiencies and improve workflow. Previously women had to wait up to 12 weeks to find out if their tumour was malignant or benign. The waiting time has since been reduced by 75% (or 48 hours).\n\nMore Resources\n\nHow's Life?: Measuring Well-being"
