        "text": "22.06.2023 | Press release\n\nThe industrial AI company Intelecy has raised 3.5 mill USD in an investment round led by Yara Growth Ventures, and with participation from GC Rieber, Aidiom and Investinor.\n\nFrom left: Bertil Helseth (CEO and founder at Intelecy), Jon Øyvind Eriksen (Board Chair at Intelecy), Anna Olsson (Chief Commercial Officer at Intelecy), Stian Nygard (Investment Director at Yara Growth Ventures) and Ulf Berg (SVP Portfolio Development at Yara Growth Ventures)\n\nIntelecy provides a no-code AI platform, specifically tailored for industrial engineers and plant operators, eliminating the need for manual coding. By utilizing the platform, process engineers can rapidly create AI models to optimize processes that reduce waste, emissions, energy consumption and costs. Intelecy serves customers in the chemicals, energy, food and beverages, mining and minerals, and utilities industries.\n\n- Intelecy has developed exciting AI solutions for production and process optimization. We have received very strong recommendations from Intelecy’s industrial customers. Yara invests in Intelecy since we consider it a strategic priority to participate in the development of AI for the industry, says Ulf Berg, SVP Portfolio Development in Yara International ASA and chair of the board at Yara Growth Ventures.\n\nIntelecy is satisfied with having Yara as a new lead investor\n\n- Yara is the world’s leading crop nutrition company, and a global provider of environmental and agricultural solutions. We consider the investment from Yara Growth Ventures a great validation of our vision, which is to help factory workers make industrial production more sustainable by optimizing production, reducing waste and energy consumption, and eliminating harmful emissions, says Bertil Helseth, CEO and founder of Intelecy.\n\nThe industrial group GC Rieber also joined the investment round. GC Rieber is a customer of Intelecy and uses AI to optimize and digitalize the production of nutraceuticals.\n\n- Our local factory workers use Intelecy to optimize the production of high-end Omega-3 concentrates and develop critical digital skills as part of the process.

We are very impressed by the ease-of-use of the Intelecy solution, says Fredrik Harloff, CIO at GC Rieber.\n\nAdvances in AI represent a huge value-creation potential for the process industry. But many AI projects still fail. Industry leaders often cite a lack of talent as the critical barrier to adopting AI.\n\n- We invest because Intelecy helps solving the skills gap in manufacturing by enabling the existing workforce to use AI, says Jon Øyvind Eriksen, CEO at Aidiom and the chair of the board at Intelecy.\n\nInvestinor increased its ownership stake in Intelecy\n\n- At Investinor, we’re investing in the businesses of tomorrow, and few sectors hold as much promise as artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Intelecy is well-positioned to meet the growing demand for intelligent and sustainable manufacturing solutions”, says Investment Manager Egil Garberg at Investinor.\n\nThe Intelecy solution combines a user-friendly no-code interface with a secure two-way real-time data communication between the factory production systems and advanced machine learning algorithms for continuous optimization and predictive maintenance.\n\nThe investment round was co-led by the AI investor Aidiom and Investinor, Norway’s largest venture capital investor. The new funding will be used to strengthen marketing, sales and product development. Erkki Altonen, CEO of Yara Growth Ventures, and Egil Garberg, investment director of Investinor, join the board of directors.\n\n- We look forward to benefit from Erkki’s and Egil’s extensive experience and network, says Bertil Helseth, CEO and founder of Intelecy.\n\nContact information\n\nAnna Olsson\n\nChief Commercial Officer at Intelecy\n\nPhone: +47 982 22 841\n\nEmail: anna.olsson@intelecy.com\n\nIngvild Hollerud Helseth\n\nHead of Communication at Intelecy\n\nPhone: +47 958 12 253\n\nEmail: ingvild.hollerud.helseth@intelecy.com\n\nAbout Intelecy\n\nIntelecy is an innovative SaaS company that was established with one clear goal: enabling sustainable production within the industry.
