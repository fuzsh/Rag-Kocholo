Since 1966, staying true to this purpose, we have been supporting our members through scholarships and cultural exchange opportunities, providing disaster relief to members in need, and funding community programs that celebrate Norwegian heritage and culture.\n\nA donation to the Sons of Norway Foundation is a contribution to the positive impact we make through community, youth, educational, and cultural projects."
