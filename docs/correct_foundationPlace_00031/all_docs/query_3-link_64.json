        "text": "We have an early start with a short flight to STOL airstrip at Lukla. The Tenzing- Hillary Airport in Lukla was established by Sir Edmund Hillary to help access the Everest region and the Sherpa people. It is a picturesque flight with marvellous views of the Eastern Himalaya. Once at Lukla we are immediately presented with views of huge peaks surrounding the village, offering a glimpse of what is to come. Our crew assembles and we head downhill towards the Dudh Kosi, a raging river that flows from the highest peaks. The broad and well-marked trail meanders around fields of potatoes and buck-wheat, passing through small villages and rows of dahlia trees to our first overnight private eco campsite at Ghat, the site of our service program. Walking time: approximately 2 hours\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nThis morning we will start our Community Project for the next 3 days at a nearby school. There will be many roles to undertake at the school. A local crew will be on hand to divide the roles and work together as a team. This is a wonderful way to give something back to the Sherpa people of the region and a hands on way to help a community in need.\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nToday we bid farewell to our new friends in the community of Ghat and cross and re-cross the thundering glacial river, named \"Dudh\" (milk) Kosi (river) because of its colour. Sections of today's walk are through pine forest and cleared areas reveal terraced fields and a variety of crops. We pass small groups of donkeys and yaks carrying trading goods and trek-gear along the trail. Spectacular mountain peaks unfold above us and seem to hover above the tree-line as they rise above the deep river valley. Shortly after leaving camp we cross the Kusum Khola, a tributary stream to the Dudh Kosi, and the peak of Kusum Kangru (6369 m) (19,107 ft) can be seen to the East, at the head of the valley. Further along the trail, across the valley to the North-West, Nupla (5885 m) (17,655) and Kongde Ri (6093 m) (18,279) rise above the forested ridges. At a turn of the trail, Thamserku (6808 m) (20,424) rises majestically, seemingly from the river floor. We will see our first Mani walls today. These stone structures are a compilation of many stone tablets, each with the inscription \"Om Mani Padme Hum\" which translates to \"Hail to the jewel in the lotus\", and is mantra (chant) venerated by Buddhists and Brahmans alike. Buddhists will walk to the left of these Mani Walls and chortens, but you may notice that people of the lowlands who have no knowledge of Buddhism do not follow this practice. The allure of the mountains is hard to resist, but we must be patient, as it is very important to acclimatise slowly and thereby fully appreciate our time at higher altitude. Today's walk is not a long one, but a very important day for acclimatizing. Walking time: approximately 4 - 5 hours\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nThis morning we cross the green/aqua waters of the Dudh Kosi and pass through the gates of the Sagamartha National Park. The establishment of this national park is a significant attempt to stem the use of fire-wood in the area. Self-contained trek groups must use only kerosene fuels for cooking, a philosophy we follow everywhere in Nepal, whether we are in a national park or not. Tea-houses and lodges are encouraged to use kerosene, yak dung or electricity but unfortunately continue to use mostly fire-wood for cooking, heating and for hot water for trekker's showers. This practice continues to deplete the forests. We follow the river course to the confluence of the Dudh Kosi and the Bhote Kosi and cross a spectacular high bridge before commencing our ascent to the village of Namche Bazaar, the Sherpa \"capital\" of Nepal. It is a tough climb as the trail passes through forest of pine to a vantage point that provides our first view of Mt Everest. The trail continues to climb and meander to Namche and the sight of this prosperous village spread within a horse-shoe shaped valley opposite the beautiful peak of Kongde Ri is worth every step. After lunch you may wish to peruse the Tibetan trader's stalls or the Sherpa shops in search of a bargain. Overnight in Permanent campsite above Namche village Walking time: approximately 4 -5 hours\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nOur trek will start with an incline to Syangboche airstrip and along the ridgeline towards Everest View Hotel. We are welcomed with magnificent views of the surrounding mountains including Everest, Lhotse, Thamserku, Khangtega, Ama Dablam and many more. After a quick break, we continue towards Khumjung and visit Sir Edmond Hillary’s famous “Schoolhouse in the clouds.”This school was the first in the entire Khumbu region being built in 1961 with the help of the Sir Edmund Hillary and the Himalayan Trust. The school originally opened with only two classrooms but has since expanded to cater for over 350 students. We descend and follow the trail for approx 25 minutes to our new exclusive campsite at Kyangjuma. For those who are feeling the early effects of altitude can opt for a shorter acclimatization walk of around 2 hours directly from Namche to Kyangjuma. Overnight: Private eco-campsite Walking time: approximately 4 - 5 hours\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nThe walk to Pangboche is one of the most spectacular trekking days in Nepal. The trail meanders easily around the ridges and Everest can be clearly seen on the horizon ahead before we descend through splendid rhododendron forests for lunch. After lunch we cross the Dudh Kosi and begin the ascent to the top of a long ridge which flows from the summit of Kantega. Our trail takes us through pine and rhododendron forest, and, as this is a devout Buddhist region, the wildlife is unharmed and not too shy. As a result there is a possibility that we may see Himalayan Thar, Musked Deer or pheasants in the forest and around our campsite. As we approach the ridgeline we pass through a traditional gateway and around a chorten before cresting the ridge onto a wide grassy meadow at the monastery village of Thyangboche. The monastery was re-built with the assistance of Sir Edmund Hillary after it was destroyed by fire in 1989. The views of the Everest massif, as well as all the other major peaks of the area are astounding. After a rest and visit to the monastery we head downhill to our private eco campsite at Pangboche. Walking time: approximately 5 hours\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nThe early morning mountain views from the monastery are outstanding. Everest, Lhotse and Nuptse are at the head of the valley, their line of sight flanked by Tawatse on one side, and Ama Dablam on the other. Almost directly above us are Kantega and Thamserku. Completing a 360-degree panorama of mountains are Khumblia and Kongde Ri which encircle us from across the valley. From Thyangboche we head down to cross the Imja Khola before an easy climb along a wide, open trail to the small village of Pangboche (3901m). We may take a slight detour to visit the Pangboche Gompa - the oldest monastery in the Khumbu, said to be over 300 years old. The views of Ama Dablam, one of the Himalaya's most stunning peaks, are spectacular. Continuing on, we cross the river again and trek up to Dingboche, situated just beneath the impressive Ama Dablam. Walking time: approximately 5 hours\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nToday we make our way up the ridge high in a sheltered valley. We may see climbing expeditions on our arrival in the base camp as Ama Dablam is one of the world’s most beautiful mountains. It means “Mother’s necklace”; the long ridges on each side like the arms of a mother (Ama) protecting her child, and the hanging glacier thought of as the dablam, the traditional double-pendant containing pictures of the gods, worn by Sherpa women. We have lunch in the Base camp and walk back to Pangboche along the main trail in the afternoon. A lot of up and down on this section, with another crossing of the Imja Khola on a steel suspension bridge. Overnight private eco campsite in Pangboche. Walking time: approximately 6 hours\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nIf clear the mountain views from Thyangboche monastery on our way through are outstanding. Everest, Lhotse and Nuptse are at the head of the valley, their line of sight flanked by Taweche on one side and Ama Dablam on the other. Almost directly above us are Kantega and Thamserku. Completing a 360 degree panorama of mountains are Khumblia and Kongde Ri which encircle us from across the valley. It is a comfortable day’s walk, with time to explore these unique and more traditional villages. As we near the villages we pass through terraced fields that are home to a brightly colored pheasant, the Daphne Pheasant, the national bird of Nepal. Overnight private eco camp site at Portse Tenga. Walking time: approximately 5 hours\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nLeaving Namche we descend through the forest towards the Dudh Kosi, and continue our return journey crossing and re-crossing the river. It will seem like a long time since we ascended through the villages on our first days of the trek, as we have witnessed many stunning views on our trek into the highest mountain range in the world. Retracing our steps along the valley, we pass through a variety of settlements and forests before a gentle climb to Lukla. We savour our final mountain sunsets of the trek as we complete this exhilarating journey. Our last evening of the trek is a perfect time to celebrate a successful journey and say thanks to the team, especially the porters who will return to their villages from here. Overnight lodge. Walking time: approximately 7 - 8 hours\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nRetracing our steps along the valley, we pass through a variety of settlements and forests before a gentle climb to Lukla. We savour our final mountain sunsets of the trek as we complete this exhilarating journey. Our last evening of the trek is a good time to have a small party for all the team, especially the porters who will return to their villages from here. There is usually lots of music, dancing and singing and if we are lucky, one of the superb cakes that our Nepali chefs are renowned for. Walking time: approximately 8 hours\n\nMeals: B,L,D"
