NOTE: The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.2023-12-299.8CVE-2023-4675\n\niletisim@usom.gov.trgrackle -- grackleGrackle is a GraphQL server written in functional Scala, built on the Typelevel stack. The GraphQL specification requires that GraphQL fragments must not form cycles, either directly or indirectly. Prior to Grackle version 0.18.0, that requirement wasn't checked, and queries with cyclic fragments would have been accepted for type checking and compilation. The attempted compilation of such fragments would result in a JVM `StackOverflowError` being thrown. Some knowledge of an applications GraphQL schema would be required to construct such a query, however no knowledge of any application-specific performance or other behavioural characteristics would be needed. Grackle uses the cats-parse library for parsing GraphQL queries. Prior to version 0.18.0, Grackle made use of the cats-parse `recursive` operator. However, `recursive` is not currently stack safe. `recursive` was used in three places in the parser: nested selection sets, nested input values (lists and objects), and nested list type declarations. Consequently, queries with deeply nested selection sets, input values or list types could be constructed which exploited this, causing a JVM `StackOverflowException` to be thrown during parsing. Because this happens very early in query processing, no specific knowledge of an applications GraphQL schema would be required to construct such a query. The possibility of small queries resulting in stack overflow is a potential denial of service vulnerability. This potentially affects all applications using Grackle which have untrusted users. Both stack overflow issues have been resolved in the v0.18.0 release of Grackle. As a workaround, users could interpose a sanitizing layer in between untrusted input and Grackle query processing.2023-12-227.5CVE-2023-50730\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.com\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.com\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.comhonor -- com.hihonor.phoneserviceSome Honor products are affected by incorrect privilege assignment vulnerability, successful exploitation could cause device service exceptions.2023-12-297CVE-2023-51431\n\n3836d913-7555-4dd0-a509-f5667fdf5fe4honor -- magic_os Some Honor products are affected by signature management vulnerability, successful exploitation could cause the forged system file overwrite the correct system file2023-12-297.3CVE-2023-23436\n\n3836d913-7555-4dd0-a509-f5667fdf5fe4honor -- magic_uiSome Honor products are affected by buffer overflow vulnerability, successful exploitation could cause code execution.2023-12-299.3CVE-2023-51434\n\n3836d913-7555-4dd0-a509-f5667fdf5fe4honor -- magic_uiSome Honor products are affected by incorrect privilege assignment vulnerability, successful exploitation could cause information leak.2023-12-297.1CVE-2023-51435\n\n3836d913-7555-4dd0-a509-f5667fdf5fe4honor -- nth-an00Some Honor products are affected by signature management vulnerability, successful exploitation could cause the forged system file overwrite the correct system file.2023-12-297.3CVE-2023-23431\n\n3836d913-7555-4dd0-a509-f5667fdf5fe4honor -- nth-an00Some Honor products are affected by signature management vulnerability, successful exploitation could cause the forged system file overwrite the correct system file.2023-12-297.3CVE-2023-23432\n\n3836d913-7555-4dd0-a509-f5667fdf5fe4ibm -- aspera_consoleIBM Aspera Console 3.4.0 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

Prior to version 23.11.4.1, the `put` method in `mindsdb/mindsdb/api/http/namespaces/file.py` does not validate the user-controlled name value, which is used in a temporary file name, which is afterwards opened for writing on lines 122-125, which leads to path injection. Later in the method, the temporary directory is deleted on line 151, but since we can write outside of the directory using the path injection vulnerability, the potentially dangerous file is not deleted. Arbitrary file contents can be written due to `f.write(chunk)` on line 125. Mindsdb does check later on line 149 in the `save_file` method in `file-controller.py` which calls the `_handle_source` method in `file_handler.py` if a file is of one of the types `csv`, `json`, `parquet`, `xls`, or `xlsx`. However, since the check happens after the file has already been written, the files will still exist (and will not be removed due to the path injection described earlier), just the `_handle_source` method will return an error. The same user-controlled source source is used also in another path injection sink on line 138. This leads to another path injection, which allows an attacker to delete any `zip` or `tar.gz` files on the server.2023-12-229.1CVE-2023-50731\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.com\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.com\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.com\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.commisskey -- misskeyMisskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform.

Prior to version 1.10.11, when handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup, FreeSWITCH is susceptible to Denial of Service due to a race condition in the hello handshake phase of the DTLS protocol. This attack can be done continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP encrypted calls during the attack. If an attacker manages to send a ClientHello DTLS message with an invalid CipherSuite (such as `TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL`) to the port on the FreeSWITCH server that is expecting packets from the caller, a DTLS error is generated. This results in the media session being torn down, which is followed by teardown at signaling (SIP) level too. Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable FreeSWITCH servers for calls that rely on DTLS-SRTP. To address this vulnerability, upgrade FreeSWITCH to 1.10.11 which includes the security fix. The solution implemented is to drop all packets from addresses that have not been validated by an ICE check.2023-12-277.5CVE-2023-51443\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.com\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.comsourcecodester -- simple_student_attendance_systemA vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Simple Student Attendance System 1.0.

This could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or other related malicious activities. An attacker need to be authenticated on the application to exploit this vulnerability. The issue is fixed in version v2.3.7 of iris-web. No known workarounds are available.2023-12-224.6CVE-2023-50712\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.com\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.comffcss -- ffcssffcss is a CLI interface to apply and configure Firefox CSS themes. Prior to 0.2.0, the function `lookupPreprocess()` is meant to apply some transformations to a string by disabling characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. However, due to the use of late Unicode normalization of type NFKD, it is possible to bypass that validation and re-introduce all the characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. The `lookupPreprocess()` can be easily bypassed with equivalent Unicode characters like U+FE4D (?), which would result in the omitted U+005F (_), for instance. The `lookupPreprocess()` function is only ever used to search for themes loosely (case insensitively, while ignoring dashes, underscores and dots), so the actual security impact is classified as low. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.2.0.
