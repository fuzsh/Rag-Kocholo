        "text": "Foundation Locations / Construction Layout\n\nMany municipalities require foundation location plans for setback verification in order to obtain building permits or certificates of occupancy on new construction. We are familiar with the requirements in most cities and towns in Strafford, Belknap and Carroll counties, including Dover, Rochester, Alton, Barrington, New Durham and Wolfeboro, and other nearby areas.\n\nStake it out\n\nIt is important to stake the layout of proposed construction prior to doing any work. It would be a very costly mistake to place a foundation before checking required zoning setbacks and regulations!"
