        "text": "4. Sami culture\n\nIf you follow in the footsteps of the Frozen heroines and head north of Fjord Norway, the region that most resembles Arendelle, you end up in Northern Norway eventually. This is the land of the Sami, Norway’s reindeer herding indigenous population. The filmmakers of Frozen 2 collaborated with the Sami on elements in the film that draw on their culture, including details for the Northuldra characters who Anna and Elsa meet in the enchanted forest. Frozen 2 is also the first time in history that an international Disney movie will get a Sami language version.\n\nAs you can imagine, there are plenty of options to experience the unique Sami culture in Northern Norway. There are actually more than 200,000 reindeer in Norway and yes, there is such a thing as reindeer sledding! Apart from being dragged through the thick snow by your own personal Sven, you can stay in a cosy lavvo tent, try traditional Sami food and visit a Sami festival or museum.\n\n5. Joik music\n\nJoik is traditional Sami music – a tradition that is very much alive today. Fans of Frozen were introduced to joik already in 2013, as the opening song of the soundtrack was composed by Sami musician Frode Fjellheim.\n\nThere is so much more to discover in the world of joik, however. Get a quick introduction to the past, present and future of Sami music.\n\n6. Say hello to the snow!\n\nIn Norway, winter without snow is like Frozen 2 without Olaf the snowman. Snow is what makes the winter season so special. It brightens up the shorter days and provides the foundation for a never-ending supply of winter activities – downhill and cross-country skiing of course, but also lots of fun things to do without skis, like tobogganing, ice skating, snowshoe hiking, ice fishing and sleigh riding.\n\nIf you have never built your own snowman like Olaf before, this is your chance.\n\n7. The fjords: Fairytale surroundings\n\nFrozen 2 may not have the same focus on the fjord landscape of Arendelle as the first film, but it is still the starting point of the adventure.\n\nIn many ways, Arendelle looks like a quintessential fairy-tale setting, complete with a grand castle in lush surroundings. Much of it is inspired by Bergen, Norway´s second largest city, one of numerous places in Fjord Norway where you can experience a little bit of fairy-tale magic in real life.\n\nWith more than 1,000 fjords and even more fjord villages around the country, the most difficult thing to decide is where to start. If you are a fjord novice, take our crash course on the Norwegian fjords.\n\n8. Akershus Fortress\n\nArendelle castle would definitely have looked completely different if it wasn’t for the Akershus Fortress in Oslo. Located right in the centre of the Norwegian capital, the building goes back to 1299, when king Håkon V started its construction. It was modernised and converted into a royal residence in the 16th century.\n\nToday, you can join a guided walking tour to learn more about the medieval castle.\n\n9. Medieval stave churches\n\nAnother example of how deeply Norway has influenced the Frozen films is the Arendelle chapel, where Elsa’s coronation takes place in the first movie. The Disney artists who created the chapel were heavily inspired by Norway's stave churches. During the Middle Ages, these elaborately carved wooden churches were a common sight in many parts of northwest Europe. Today, only around 30 stave churches remain, most of which are located in Norway.\n\nRead all about the Norwegian stave churches.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into the Norwegian folklore that inspired the Frozen films, some of the best places to visit are the many folk museums around the country. Revel in everything from handicraft and folk costumes to art exhibitions.\n\nMany folk museums are open-air museums which are just as interesting for architecture buffs as they are for Disney fans. Walk around historical Norwegian buildings including the typical wooden cottages with turf roofs. At some folk museums, like the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History in Oslo and the Maihaugen Museum in Lillehammer, you can also experience medieval stave churches."
