        "text": "Tromsø, town, northern Norway. It is located on two islands, Troms (Tromsøy) and Kval (Kvaløy), just west of the mainland. Because Tromsø is located well north of the Arctic Circle, the sun is visible continuously from late May to late July. The town was established about 1250 and received its town charter in 1794. By the end of the 19th century, it had become a major Arctic trade center from which many Arctic expeditions originated. During World War II it served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. Tromsø has Norway’s major Arctic fishery, sealing, and shipping facilities, and local industry deals mainly with storing and processing fish. It is known for the Institute of Meteorology; the University of Tromsø, founded in 1969 and home to the Center for Sami Studies; and the Auroral Observatory, which was built in 1928 with grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Norwegian Polar Institute. The Tromsø Museum contains maritime exhibits and Norwegian and Sami folklore displays. Pop. (2007 est.) mun., 64,492."
