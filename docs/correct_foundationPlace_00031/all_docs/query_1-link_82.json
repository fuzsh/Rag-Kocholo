        "text": "With this Act, Norway is one of the first countries in Europe moving from soft law to hard law in making responsible business a legal requirement for companies.\n\nSHARE:\n\nOperating ethically is becoming a “must-have”. Companies are required to adopt measures to identify, cease, prevent, mitigate and publicly account for negative actual and potential human rights impacts. Measures relate to a company’s complete value chain, including indirect suppliers.\n\nThe Norwegian Transparency Act\n\nThe Transparency Act - Forbrukertilsynet entered into force on 1 July 2022. The Act places three main duties on companies:\n\nDue diligence: The duty to carry out due diligence to identify and assess actual and potential adverse impacts on human rights and decent working conditions in companies and their supply chains.\n\nReport on due diligence: The duty to publish an annual account of the due diligence process by 30 June each year.\n\nRight to information: The duty to respond to requests from the public on how a company addresses actual and potential adverse impacts on human rights and decent working conditions.\n\nDNV can guide your business on meeting the requirements of the Transparency Act\n\nWith our:\n\nLocal knowledge combined with global reach; and\n\nDeep specialists on human rights and decent working conditions who can assist you with human rights due diligence.\n\nWe can provide:\n\nGap analysis on your company’s compliance with the Act and preparations for upcoming EU directives.\n\nHuman rights due diligence, including a review of policies and procedures.\n\nAdvice on human rights due diligence and follow-up of your suppliers and sub-contractors.\n\nAdvice on annual reporting on the Act.\n\nSystems to comply with the information duty.\n\nDigital systems to help you effectively comply with the Act.\n\nTraining around the Transparency Act and similar laws in Europe, including on human rights and decent working conditions.\n\nIn-country audits where negative risks or impacts have been identified.\n\nDNV can help you comply with all three duties of the Act\n\n1. Due diligenceWe assist companies with:\n\nCompanies must undertake human rights/social due diligence assessments in the company and through all levels of their supply chain.\n\nApplicable since July 1st 2022.\n\nGap analysis of compliance with the Act.\n\nDue diligence assessments of human rights risks in your company and value chain (based on OECD’s responsibility wheel).\n\nReview of your company policies, including human rights policies and ethical guidelines.\n\nReview of your supplier management, including supplier Code of Conduct, prequalification procedures and contract forms.\n\nPractical steps and systems to monitor and follow up with your supply chain regularly, including digital solutions to collect the right information.\n\n2. Report on due diligenceWe assist companies with:\n\nPublic statement to be published on company website explaining how the company is undertaking social due diligence.\n\nThe statement shall cover as a minimum:\n\na general description of the company's organization, operating area, guidelines and routines for handling actual and potential negative consequences for basic human rights and decent working conditions;\n\ninformation about actual negative consequences and significant risk of negative consequences that the business has uncovered through its due diligence assessments;\n\ninformation about measures that the business has implemented or plans to implement to stop actual negative consequences or limit significant risk of negative consequences, and the result or expected results of these measures.\n\nTailor made reporting formats for your annual company disclosure of due diligence under the Act.\n\nHow to collect the right information/data for the annual disclosure, including digital solutions.\n\nHow to undertake the annual reporting.\n\nTraining of key staff on reporting and digital systems.\n\n3. Right to informationWe assist companies with:\n\nUpon written request, any person has the right to information from an enterprise regarding how the enterprise addresses actual and potential adverse impacts pursuant to Section 4. This includes both general information and information relating to a specific product or service offered by the enterprise.\n\nSetup of website for the reception of requests from the public.\n\nSystems to handle and respond in time to requests from the public, including a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\n\nSimilar laws in Europe\n\nA similar act entered into force from January 2023 in Germany: The new Supply Chain Act (bundesregierung.de). The EU is following this with the Corporate Sustainable Due Diligence Directive (CS3D) which will expand requirements for transparency with reporting requirements starting from 2025. These laws share a common approach and requirements – based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) and the OECD guidelines for responsible business – to make meaningful attempts at creating transparency in the supply chain. Companies * reporting properly on the Transparency Act are thus better prepared for the EU directive reporting\n\nAsk our specialists\n\nHeidi Solheim Nordbeck (Heidi.Solheim.Nordbeck@dnv.com)\n\nTransparency Act, human rights due diligence & risks\n\nHeidi is a Senior Sustainability Consultant in DNV’s Sustainability team in Høvik, Norway.\n\nShe leads consulting projects related to ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) compliance in the energy and maritime sectors, and supports clients across sectors on compliance with the Norwegian Transparency Act and upcoming EU directives in this area.\n\nHeidi has 20 years of international experience from advisory and consultancy services within human rights, climate change and decent working conditions from civil society, the public sector, the UN International Labour Organization and the European Free Trade Association.
