        "text": "Olve has 15+ years of full-stack/distributed systems development and has recently joined Disruptive Technologies Research AS - powering the IOT sensor revolution\n\nThe last five years he has led the transition of the product line from an on premise model to the use of micro-services with continuous delivery, message queueing and monitoring, to containerization and service discovery, contributed extensively to the migration of the product line from on-premise installations to cloud services, and with optimization and load balancing of live video broadcasts.\n\nProfessor of philosophy at the University of Agder. Einar Duenger Bohn was born (1977) and raised in Vormsund, Norway. He has a BA in psychology and philosophy and an MA in philosophy from the University of Oslo. He got his PhD in philosophy from the University of Massachusetts Amherst (2009). His current interest in artificial intelligence (and artificial life) is growing exponentially, and very soon it will be the only thing he is interested in. Right now he is obsessed with the question whether it is possible to create artificial consciousness, and what the answer to that question tells us about our own consciousness and moral thinking. He greatly fears the singularity without the systems being conscious and morally aware. Bohn also has a theory of the meaning of life according to which it's in accordance with the meaning of life to develop as much technology as we can, as long as it's for the better for all. Bohn considers himself a modest transhumanist.\n\nEinar Duenger blogs at http://www.einarduengerbohn.com/edb/\n\nI have worked with software development since 1996, mostly creating web based systems. During my career I have worked both as a consultant and in product companies, in roles spanning from backend developer to management consultant.\n\nAfter trying pure non-technical roles I have found that I enjoy the technical part of software development too much to let it go. These days I try in my work to mix programming assignments with coaching and speaking, helping teams improve their processes and programming skills.\n\nI am currently employed as Technical Principal at Valtech Sweden. My job description includes working as a solution architect, training, speaking, helping our sales team with technical sales, and a bit of development.\n\nThese days I prefer to program in Clojure, but I’ve also written a lot of Python and Ruby over the last 8 years. And of course, as anyone exposed to web development, I have also written my share of JavaScript.\n\nAs I have done quite a lot of server setups, I’ve become quite proficient with DevOps technologies such as Docker, Ansible and Terraform.\n\nI was lucky enough to get started as a Smalltalk developer at IBM, which exposed me early on to what was to be called Agile methodologies. It was only later when I was introduced to Extreme Programming when I realized that we had been doing things differently.\n\nHaving started practicing XP in 2001, I have been very involved in the agile community, and was one of the founders of the Agila Sverige conference in 2008. I still believe that agile methodologies are necessary for a successful product development, but I am also quite disillusioned by what the industry has made out of it. After doing a number of consultancy gigs as an agile coach, I now much prefer to work in development teams, and focusing on actually building something.\n\nIf given a choice, I like to work with Open Source technologies. I run Linux on all my computers, and prefer Arch Linux on the desktop and Debian on servers.\n\nMarcus blogs at https://www.marcusahnve.org\n\nMy name is Damian and I am a Principal Technical Consultant for Lumagate; my motto and mantra is focused on “Making incredible software incredibly simple.”; I am also proud to be recognised as a Microsoft MVP since 2011 and Cisco Champion since 2014. I love learning and sharing, I can be found blogging at www.damianflynn.com, tweeting under the alias @damian_flynn, and have published a number of white papers, technical articles and webinars. I co-authored on multiple books, including “Microsoft Private Cloud Computing (Sybex)”, “Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V Installation and Configuration Guide (Sybex)”, and “Microsoft System Centre: Building a Virtualized Network Solution (MS Press)”. I am a regular presenter at many international and community events, including the original and re-resurrected MMS; Expert’s Live and TechDays. Additionally, I have contributed as a content author and technical reviewer for many of the System Centre, and Cloud focused Microsoft Certification Courseware's.\n\nI am currently focused on Cloud Technologies in the Converged Datacentre, with perspective on Automation in “Dev/Ops” scenarios, leveraging declarative configuration with Software Defined Infrastructure to deliver Infrastructure as Code, realized through Templates, Containers and Desired State; on both Linux and Windows Stacks.\n\nDamian blogs at https://www.DamianFlynn.com"
