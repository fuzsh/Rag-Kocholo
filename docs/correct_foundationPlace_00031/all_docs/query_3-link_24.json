        "text": "We transfer to the airport for the short flight to the STOL airstrip at Lukla. This was the airstrip built by Sir Edmund Hillary and his friends to service the Everest Region when he began his work of building schools and hospitals for the Sherpa people. It is a memorable flight, with marvellous views of the Eastern Himalaya. At Lukla we are immediately impressed by the scale of the huge peaks that surround the village but this is only a foretaste of what is to come. Our crew assemble and we head downhill towards the Dudh Kosi, a raging river that flows from the highest peaks. The river earns its name \"Dudh\" (milk) Kosi (river) because of its colour. The broad and well-marked trail meanders around fields of potatoes and buck-wheat and passes through small villages, as we pass rows of tree dahlia to make our way to our private eco camp at Ghat.\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nToday we cross and re-cross the thundering glacial river, named \"Dudh\" (milk) Kosi (river) because of its colour. Sections of today's walk are through pine forest and cleared areas reveal terraced fields and a variety of crops. We pass small groups of donkeys, yaks and dzopko carrying trading goods and trekking gear along the trail. A dzopko is a yak-cow crossbreed while a yak is a full-blood long haired male, more commonly found at higher altitudes. Spectacular mountain peaks unfold above us and seem to hover above the tree-line as they rise above the deep river valley. Shortly after leaving camp we cross the Kusum Khola, a tributary stream to the Dudh Kosi, and the peak of Kusum Kangru (6369 m) can be seen to the East, at the head of the valley. Further along the trail, across the valley to the North-West, Nupla (5885 m) and Kongde Ri (6093 m) rise above the forested ridges. At a turn of the trail, Thamserku (6808 m) rises majestically, seemingly from the river floor. We will see our first Mani walls today. These stone structures are a compilation of many stone tablets, each with the inscription \"Om Mani Padme Hum\" which translates to \"Hail to the jewel in the lotus\", and is mantra (chant) venerated by Buddhists and Brahmans alike. buddhists will walk to the left of these Mani Walls and chortens, but you may notice that people of the lowlands who have no knowledge of Buddhism do not follow this practice. The allure of the mountains is hard to resist, but we must be patient, as it is very important to acclimatise slowly and thereby fully appreciate our time at higher altitude. Today's walk is not a long one, slow down, and enjoy every step of the way. Overnight private eco camp.\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nThis morning we cross the green/aqua waters of the Dudh Kosi and pass through the gates of the Sagamartha National Park. The establishment of this national park is a significant attempt to stem the use of fire-wood in the area. Self-contained trek groups must use only kerosene fuels for cooking, a philosophy we follow everywhere in Nepal, whether we are in a national park or not. Tea-houses and lodges are encouraged to use kerosene, yak dung or electricity but unfortunately continue to use mostly fire-wood for cooking, heating and for hot water for trekker's showers. This practice continues to deplete the forests. We follow the river course to the confluence of the Dudh Kosi and the Bhote Kosi and cross a spectacular high bridge before commencing our ascent to the village of Namche Bazaar, the Sherpa \"capital\" of Nepal. It is a tough climb as the trail passes through forest of pine to a vantage point that provides our first view of Mt Everest. The trail continues to climb and meander to Namche and the sight of this prosperous village spread within a horse-shoe shaped valley opposite the beautiful peak of Kongde Ri is worth every step. After lunch you may wish to peruse the Tibetan trader's stalls or the Sherpa shops in search of a bargain. Overnight: eco-lodge\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nOur trek will start with an incline to Syangboche airstrip and along the ridgeline towards Everest View Hotel. We are welcomed with magnificent views of the surrounding mountains including Everest, Lhotse, Thamserku, Khangtega, Ama Dablam and many more. After a quick break, we continue towards Khumjung and visit Sir Edmond Hillary’s famous “Schoolhouse in the clouds.”This school was the first in the entire Khumbu region being built in 1961 with the help of the Sir Edmund Hillary and the Himalayan Trust. The school originally opened with only two classrooms but has since expanded to cater for over 350 students. We descend and follow the trail for approx 25 minutes to our new exclusive campsite at Kyangjuma. For those who are feeling the early effects of altitude can opt for a shorter acclimatization walk of around 2 hours directly from Namche to Kyangjuma. Overnight: Private eco-campsite\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nWe descend through splendid rhododendron, Himalayan blue pine and Birch forests to Phungi Tenga. From there we cross the Dudh Kosi and begin the ascent to Thyangboche Monastery. This is one of the largest and oldest monasteries in the region and follows the oldest Nyinmapa Sect. This monastery has been standing more than 100 years and has been visited by trekkers and expedition members from all over for good luck and blessings from the lama. We continue and cross Imja River and ascend a wide open trail to our campsite at Pangboche. private eco-campsite\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nAn important acclimatisation/rest day today with the option of hiking high up to the ridge overlooking the village, or perhaps up to Chhukung Village. We spend the day exploring or relaxing and taking in the mountain scenery. Excellent views of Nuptse, Lhotse, Chhukung Peak and Imja Tse (6189 m) are had from both in the valley or from the ridge above the camp. Massive glaciers drape beneath cliffs that soar up to 3,500 metres in this dramatic valley. It is from here that we will prepare to make our first crossing of a high pass, the Kongma La at 5300 meters. Overnight private eco camp.\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nThis will be a big day as we ascend to the Kongma La pass amid the crags of this outlying ridge from nearby Nuptse. From the pass we descend steeply to the Khumbu Glacier which we cross, clambering up the moraines on the far side to reach the meadow by the Italian high altitude research pyramid where we plan to camp the night. The difficulty of today's trek should not be underestimated, particularly in snow conditions where the trek across the glacier at the conclusion of the day can be quite exhausting. Our camp is at the village of Lobuche. We enjoy spectacular views of Pumori and Nuptse. The hill above the town affords fine sunset views of Nuptse. Overnight lodge (please note that single supplements cannot be guaranteed at Lobuche during peak periods).\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nWe trek over rocky moraine towards the settlement of Gorak Shep. We are high, among the glaciers and peaks of the world's highest mountains. At the junction of two large glaciers and nestled in an amphitheatre of peaks, this location is spectacular. Pumori (7145 m), Lingtren (6697 m), Nuptse (7745 m) and of course Everest (8848 m) surround us. The air is clear and the sun is strong but as the sun sets it becomes very cold. Sunsets here can be stunning. In the afternoon there is the option to trek to Kala Pattar or you may prefer to just sit back, relax and take in the mountain scenery. Kala Pattar is not a Nepali name but a Hindi name and translates to \"black rock\". From these black rocks atop the hill the views are spectacular. Most eyes are locked on the mass of Everest, its rocky buttresses immediately before us. Overnight lodge (please note that single supplements cannot be guaranteed at Gorak Shep during peak periods).\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nThe views today are magnificent as we leave the Everest watershed and enter that of Cho Oyu, the sixth highest mountain in the world. The crossing is hard work, involving a steep scramble up rock boulders and then a walk across the gently ascending, snow-covered glacier that caps the pass. However, the views of the route ahead, and of the glacier itself, are breathtaking. We descend steep boulder strewn slopes to the Gokyo valley below. This is a valley of turquoise lakes and great glaciers. For the first (and steepest) part of the descent there are discernible paths that zigzag down the mountainside – slippery in snow! The ground then levels out and the path all but disappears as we hop across a field of boulders. Finally we climb a gentle slope to the top, from where its all downhill (for today at least!), following a narrow river valley all the way to its base where we overnight at Thagnak, a small Sherpa settlement nestled beneath great rock walls, just a stone's throw from the Ngozumba Glacier. Overnight lodge.\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nAn early start offers the best opportunities to really appreciate the magnitude and enormity of the surrounding Himalaya. Today there will be an option of either ascending Gokyo Ri (5483m) or walk alongside Nepal’s largest glacier, the Ngozumpa glacier to Ngozumba Tsho, known amongst locals as the 5th Lake. Both offer spectacular views with the latter considered as Nepal’s best as it looks towards the western cwm of Everest and other 8000m+ peaks. The 5th lake is a local favourite away from other tourists, a truly spectacular experience and viewpoint seen by not many. Gokyo Ri is the classic postcard view of snow capped mountains and vibrant turquoise waters of Gokyo Lake completing a picturesque scene. Just like the 5th lake, you will be surrounded by Cho Oyu (8153m), Gyangchung Kang (7922m), Lghotse (8501m), Makalu (8475m), Cholatse (6440m), Taweche (6542m), Kantega (6685m), Thamserku (6808m), Lobuche (6145m) and Mt Everest (8848m). Although further from Everest than Kala Pattar, the traditional viewing point, we are positioned to see more of the mountains and enjoy a more relaxed environment. Your guide will leave it to the group to unanimously decide between Gokyo Ri and the 5th Lake for today’s expedition but we assure you that neither will be a compromise.
