For 2014–2022 and Q1-Q2 2023 where contributions were hedged to mitigate currency risk exposure, these have been expressed using the rates applicable to the hedge agreement.\n\nFuture contributions (for pledges made prior to the June 2020 donor pledging conference): non-US$ Direct Contribution and Matching Fund pledges for Q3-Q4 2023 and for years 2024 and beyond are expressed in US$ equivalents using the applicable forecast rates from Bloomberg as at 30 June 2023 or using the rates applicable to any hedge agreement in place.\n\nFuture contributions (for pledges at the June 2020 donor pledging conference): non-US$ Direct Contribution and Matching Fund pledges for Q3-Q4 2023 and for years 2024 and beyond are expressed in US$ equivalents using the spot rates from Refinitiv as at 30 June 2023 or using the rates applicable to any hedge agreement in place.\n\nIFFIm contributions\n\nReceived contributions: non-US$ contributions for 2000-2022 and Q1-Q2 2023 are expressed in US$ equivalents as confirmed by the IBRD (World Bank)\n\nFuture contributions: non-US$ Direct Contribution and Matching Fund pledges for Q3-Q4 2023 and for years 2024 and beyond are expressed in US$ equivalents using the applicable forecast rates from Bloomberg as at 30 June 2023 or using the rates applicable to any hedge agreement in place.\n\nFor signed contribution agreements: contributions are expressed in US$ equivalents using the exchange rates at the time of signing the respective donor grant agreements\n\nFor contribution agreements not yet signed: contributions are expressed in US$ equivalents using the applicable spot rates from Refinitiv as at 30 June 2023\n\nDue to IFFIm’s nature as a frontloading vehicle, yearly contributions paid into IFFIm can differ significantly from yearly proceeds transferred to Gavi.\n\nWhile IFFIm grants are irrevocable and legally binding, they are subject to a Grant Payment Condition that can potentially reduce the amount due by the donor in the event that a Gavi-supported programme country is in protracted arrears with the International Monetary Fund. Since 29 June 2021, there is no longer any reduction applied, as all countries from the reference portfolio have cleared their arrears with the IMF."
