It’s challenging to stay in the forefront of such rapid development!\n\nIn 2024, we’ll shine a light on how to control the use of foundation models (like ChatGPT) and other AI tools that challenge the way we work. For example: How will the EU’s AI Act affect businesses and public services?\n\nNornir is an IoT- and AI operator facilitating the real-time movement, usage, and leverage of data, through their core offering – Nornir HIVE. Having acquired Norwegian BMS (battery management system) company Appollo at the start of 2023, Nornir has made the Norwegian Building Maintenance industry the focus of its go-to-market strategy.\n\nAccording to founder and CEO Pål K. Levang, the BMS (no; FDVU, forvaltning, drift og vedlikehold) industry is ripe for innovation and is the ideal market for Nornir HIVE to focus on as they unleash their technology.\n\nPål continues stating that today’s FDVU systems are plagued with manual processes, static data, and vendor lock-in. All of which he, Nornir and the daughter company, Appollo, plans to eradicate.\n\nWe are already working with big and exciting customers through Appollo, Oslobygg, being chief among them – one of Norway’s largest real estate companies. Oslobygg is very open to innovative solutions to traditional problems, and we have already started rolling out AI-driven processes in their BMS value chain.\n\nWorking with forward-leaning organizations like Oslobygg is invaluable, according to Pål.\n\n– Having Oslobygg as a client grants us credibility and puts our technology to the ultimate test, as no one has stricter demands regarding data security and operational integrity.\n\nA short presentation of the company\n\nNornir is something as rare as a Norwegian deep tech company, founded, funded, and run by Norwegians in Norway. That doesn’t stop us from being diverse where it matters, on the inside, with a 50/50 gender split across more than eight nationalities.\n\nWe are passionate about seeing our technology facilitate the solutions of tomorrow and strive to continue to be pioneers in the field of AI-driven networks.\n\nHow do you use AI in the company?\n\nWe use AI to build semantic networks of devices, software, and otherwise “dumb” nodes, linked by bi-directional linking, communication, and semantic services. This allows us to smartify existing infrastructure, which again can lead to benefits – like in the case with Oslobygg – automation of labour-intensive processes, securing data integrity, eliminating vendor lock-in and much more.\n\nTell about a recent success story from your company or an exciting project you are working on.\n\nA good example of “smartifying existing infrastructure” is the project we have underway with KfiO at Nordberg kirke in Oslo. Here we have an ongoing pilot project where we’re utilising our HIVE in combination with a set of temperature sensors and “dumb” actuators to smartify their existing heating system. The HIVE will utilize temperature data from the strategically placed sensors to control the existing heating system’s actuators in true real-time. As the pilot progresses, we can use machine learning to add data from the church’s calendar, weather reports and more to make the system even smarter. A solution that could save the church tens, if not hundreds, of thousands in heating costs in the coming winters.\n\nWhat goals does the company have for the future?\n\nShort-term, we aim to be a leading system provider within the Norwegian BMS (FDVU) vertical, both in the private and public sectors. And we wish to do this with key clients and partners.\n\nLong-term, Nornir has great plans for the HIVE and the underlying technology that includes-, but also goes beyond the scope of Appollo, BMS and Norway. With time, we will roll out our technology, with key partners, in new verticals and markets – while also expanding our portfolio of offerings.\n\nWhy do you sponsor the AI+ conference?\n\nWe are sponsoring the AI+ conference as we see it as a vital forum to meet key people, clients and partners within the AI space.\n\nSmart Innovation Norway has a good history of facilitating valuable relationships, which is why we are a part of their cluster and events such as this one.\n\nFacts about the company:\n\nName of business: Nornir (& Appollo)\n\nNumber of employees: 20\n\nLocation: Oslo\n\nIndustry: Smart City operator & BMS (FDVU) system\n\nBriefly about the product/service: https://nornir.io/\n\nSimula Consulting was founded for a main reason; bringing the fruits of technological research to society, and the ambition of CTO Omar Richardson is for Simula Consulting to become the go-to organisation for the most complex problems in tech.\n\nThe 2020-founded R&D consultancy company focuses on products and services in deep tech and AI.\n\nSimula Consulting harnesses AI to solve its customers’ problems. An AI-driven underwater fish separator prototype, built by the Simula Consulting team in collaboration with local partners, achieved excellent results in classifying and catching fish when deployed last summer.\n\nThe device uses computer vision to separate the indigenous Atlantic salmon from the invasive pink salmon, a species not wanted in Norwegian river ecosystems.\n\nReceiving international acknowledgement for the novel product and its good results, Simula Consulting’s work contributes to biodiversity.\n\nLearn more about Simula Consulting below.\n\nA short presentation of the company\n\nMy name is Omar Richardson, CTO of Simula Consulting. We are an R&D consultancy company that focuses on products and services in deep tech and AI. We aim to push beyond the state of the art by incorporating cutting-edge technologies into business-ready products and services. A subsidiary of Simula Research Laboratory, we were founded in 2020 and have grown rapidly.\n\nHow do you use AI in the company?\n\nWe harness AI to solve our clients’ most challenging problems. This can be either essential tasks that fall outside the core business or transforming how employees reach their goals. For me, deep tech really comes to life when you sit down with domain experts and work out what the innovation looks like together. You know you’ve made a difference when enabling something that wasn’t even considered possible before.\n\nTell about a recent success story from your company or an exciting project you are working on.\n\nMy team and I are building an AI-driven underwater fish separator that uses computer vision to distinguish between the indigenous Atlantic salmon and the invasive pink salmon, a species that has increasingly been wreaking havoc on the Norwegian river ecosystem in the last ten years. Our collaboration with local partners resulted in a prototype deployed in the summer of 2022 and did a fantastic job in classifying and catching fish. It has been incredibly exciting to work on and rewarding to see the international recognition it received for its beneficial impact on biodiversity.\n\nWhat goals does the company have for the future?\n\nMy ambition is for Simula Consulting to become the go-to organisation for the most complex problems in tech. We were founded on one of the core values of the Simula group: bringing the fruits of technological research to society. I believe that our relentless team of data scientists and engineers, supported by the excellent research units in Simula Research Laboratory, are in a key position not just to bring value to our customers but advance technology as a whole.\n\nWhy do you sponsor the AI+ conference?\n\nI believe that technology serves society and that it is our duty to do whatever we can to ensure it stays that way. The AI+ conference is one of the main platforms in Norway to share knowledge, have open discussions and connect with people on AI. It is vital to support such initiatives so that we can keep making conscious decisions about where technology should go.\n\nFacts about the company:\n\nName of business: Simula Consulting AS\n\nNumber of employees: 15\n\nLocation: Oslo\n\nIndustry: ICT\n\nBriefly about the product/service: Cutting-edge deep tech development and AI consultancy"
