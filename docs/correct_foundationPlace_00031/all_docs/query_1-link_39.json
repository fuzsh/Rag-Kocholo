        "text": "Well-qualified candidates at all degree levels and in all fields of study who plan to pursue a career in education will be considered. However, preference will be given to applicants in English, American studies, social sciences, and humanities. Applicants should have a demonstrated interest in teaching, an ability to work well both independently and as part of a team, and the maturity, flexibility, and resourcefulness necessary for doing well in a foreign educational environment.\n\nApplicants who are recommended for final consideration may be contacted by the U.S.-Norway Fulbright Foundation to set up a brief online or telephone interview.\n\nNorway is an excellent place to live, study, and teach. With a strong public emphasis on knowledge and learning, Norway's generously funded and publicly accessible system of higher education and research is the backbone of Norwegian intellectual development, creativity, and innovation. A good introduction to Norway can be found here. In addition, Statistics Norway has a wealth of information in English on many topics.\n\nThe vast majority of higher education institutions in Norway are public. There is a single national admissions process for undergraduate study at public colleges and universities as well as some private institutions. In accordance with European standards the years of study for a bachelor’s, master’s and Ph.D. degree are three, two and three respectively. In-depth information about higher education in Norway can be found here.\n\nPublic primary and secondary schools are free in Norway. For more information about K-12 education in Norway, click here.\n\nNorwegian institutions of higher education and research offer many opportunities for international students to take classes and conduct research. English is used almost as a second language in Norway, and the international environment in most research and higher education institutions means that competence in Norwegian is not a requirement.\n\nETAs receive student affiliation at their host universities and may take classes provided that doing so does not interfere with their assignment.\n\nAs they provide valuable insight into strength of the applicant, three recommendations, otherwise known as the ETA reference forms, are mandatory.\n\nExcellent writing skills are a prerequisite for all ETA grants in Norway and should be clearly demonstrated throughout the application.\n\nGiven the populations ETAs in Norway work with, applicants should address their experience and skills in academic writing and in working with university and/or high school students.\n\nApplicants are advised to list all relevant experience in the Extracurricular Activities & Achievements and/or Professional Experience sections of the application."
