At that time, we sold portfolios of defaulted loans and entered into ongoing sales agreements for defaulted loans (so-called forward flow agreements) in all countries where Komplett Bank operates. The clean-up of the balance sheet enabled us to reduce credit risk in the bank, and through this work, we are now in a much better place to position ourselves for growth going forward. At the beginning of 2022, we carved out a new strategy with a clear goal of repositioning the bank for profitable growth, with a focus on improving risk-adjusted margins and significantly increasing efficiency and scalability. During the past year, we started delivering on this plan. The first step was to reduce the management team from ten to six members with clearer and more defined areas of responsibility that would enable the overall management team to implement and deliver results of the new strategy more effectively. Together, we have gained a good understanding of how to build a future-oriented company, and we have set ambitious goals to be a modern and cost-effective niche bank that is positioned for the exciting growth opportunities we see ahead. In the second half of the year, we started seeing very good results from the many initiatives we put in place to increase new sales and grow the loan portfolio, resulting in a strong balance sheet growth of approximately 30% during the period, while managing to keep the margins relatively stable. In addition, we are already seeing results from the structural measures we have implemented to reduce costs. At the same time, we see potential for significant further efficiency gains: Technology simplification is one of the strategic initiatives that is now being implemented to improve scalability and reduce costs. We are well underway in transferring the business to a more efficient IT platform, which will eventually result in a significant reduction in IT infrastructure costs. We expect this process to take 12 months. The tragic war in Ukraine has contributed to increased macroeconomic uncertainty throughout 2022. This uncertainty has spilled over into the household economy for most people, and many have experienced increased prices on groceries, electricity, and most notably, higher interest rates on loans. This global macroeconomic situation is likely to persist in 2023, which will affect consumer liquidity and spending patterns. In 2022, we established a strategic action plan which we gradually implemented throughout the year. In 2023, we will gradually reap the benefits of growth and increased efficiency before scalability will truly be manifested in 2024 8 Letter from the CEO\n\nHowever, we see positive prospects for growth and increased profitability this year. The prospects are based on the bank having a well-diversified loan portfolio of 10 billion Norwegian kroner, a continued strong inflow of loan applications, profitable operations, and exposure to a robust Nordic market for consumer financing. We are by no means at the end of an exciting journey. Not even at the beginning of the end, but we are probably at the end of the beginning. It has been tough, but there has been great understanding for the changes that have been made. It has impressed me. I am very proud of the commitment of our talented employees. It will prove to be a real asset in the coming months and years. Komplett Bank is currently a bank with a solid capital base that provides good support for our growth strategy. I look forward to continuing the journey towards a more profitable and cost-effective niche bank. Øyvind Oanes, CEO Komplett Bank today has a solid foundation that provides good support for our growth strategy.

Statement of corporate governance Good corporate governance is a key priority for the Board of Komplett Bank. The Bank seeks to maintain high standards for corporate governance which it considers to be an important prerequisite for long-term value creation. As a Norwegian public limited company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange, Komplett Bank is subject to requirements in accordance with the Accounting Act 3-3b as well as the Oslo Stock Exchange’s “Ongoing obligations for listed companies” regarding the annual statement of principles and practices for corporate governance. The Bank follows the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance (the “Code”), adopted by the Norwegian Committee for Corporate Governance (NUES) on 14 October 2021. The Code is built on the “follow or explain” principle, which means that companies applying the Code may deviate from individual regulations but must then provide an explanation for the deviation. Komplett Bank’s management and Board conduct an annual review of the Bank’s principles and practices relating to corporate governance. This report explains Komplett Bank’s principles for corporate governance, and how the Bank complies with the Code. There are no significant discrepancies between the Code of Practice and Komplett Bank’s practice. 2. Operations Komplett Bank may, within the framework of the legislation that applies at any given time, perform all transactions and services that are common or natural for banks to perform. This is stated in the Bank’s articles of association, which are available at www. komplettbank.no. Komplett Bank primarily offers unsecured financing to private individuals who qualify after a specific credit assessment. Komplett Bank also follows a growth strategy based on geographical distribution in the Nordic region and has launched its loan products aimed at the private market in Norway, Finland and Sweden.

Komplett Bank has also prepared several guidelines that will guide the Board, management and employees in their daily work, as well as contribute to building trust and credibility internally and externally. These include guidelines for ethics, anti-corruption and money laundering, data security and whistleblowing. Corporate governance at Komplett Bank is designed to achieve the Bank’s strategic goals and at the same time safeguard the Bank’s values and ethical guidelines. An organisational structure has been established with clearly defined areas of responsibility that facilitate the overall management of the Bank. The Bank’s goals, strategies and risk profile are described in the annual report for 2022, together with an account of the Bank’s work related to ESG responsibility 3. Share capital and dividends The Board of Directors of Komplett Bank continually assesses the Bank’s capital situation considering regulatory requirements, the Bank’s goals, strategy and the desired risk profile. Komplett Bank aims to have a total capital adequacy ratio of 21.6%, including a common equity Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio of 18.1% to provide room for manoeuvre to achieve the Bank’s financial targets. Komplett Bank had at 31 December 2022 an equity of NOK 1,953.3 million. In accordance with established calculation rules for capital adequacy for financial enterprises, Komplett Bank’s total capital adequacy was 23.6%, while the common equity Tier 1 capital adequacy was 20.5%. The requirement for common equity Tier 1 capital is 17.6%, and the Board considers the Bank’s capital position to be satisfactory. Komplett Bank’s Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy to ensure that the Bank has sufficient capital to grow in selected markets in accordance with the Bank’s strategy. Surplus capital will be distributed to the shareholders in the form of dividends. Komplett Bank paid its first dividend in 2021 of NOK 0.42 per share, a total NOK 78.5 million.

Komplett Bank / Annual Report 2022 15\n\nBoard authorisations At the annual general meeting on April 7th, 2022, three authorizations were given to the board with defined purposes. Each of the authorizations were voted on separately. Ǵ Authorization to increase the Bank’s share capital by up to 4 million NOK in connection with the Bank’s employee option scheme was granted at the Annual General Meeting on April 7, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the authorization has been partially used. The authorization is valid until the Bank’s Annual General Meeting held in 2023, but not beyond June 30, 2023. Ǵ Authorization to issue eligible capital approved as additional core capital and/or eligible loan approved as supplementary capital for up to 200 million Norwegian kroner. The authorization is valid until the ordinary general meeting held in 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the authorization has not been utilized. Ǵ Authorization to purchase own shares for up to 5 million NOK to optimize the Bank’s financial structure. The authorization is valid until the Bank’s ordinary general meeting held in 2023, but no later than June 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the authorization has not been used. 4. Equal treatment of shareholders and transactions with associates The Board of Directors and the management of Komplett Bank emphasise that all shares in the Bank must be treated equally and that they must have the same opportunity to exert influence. Komplett Bank has one share class, and each share allows one vote. The Bank’s transactions in own shares are made on the stock exchange or in some other manner at the stock exchange price. In the event of increases in the share capital, the Bank’s existing shareholders have a pre-emptive right. Any deviation from this pre-emptive right must be justified in a stock exchange announcement related to the capital increase. There were no such cases during 2022. Komplett Bank has established, as a supplement to the board instructions, guidelines for transactions with related parties. This means, among other things, that transactions with related parties must be carried out at arm’s length and on market terms. For not insignificant transactions between the Bank and related parties, an independent valuation must be obtained which must be made known to the shareholders. As of December 31, 2022, Komplett Bank had no such agreements. Komplett Bank has had a longstanding commercial and strategic partnership with Komplett Group based on a collaboration agreement between Komplett AS and Komplett Bank ASA. The agreement involves intellectual property rights, marketing collaboration, and other services. There is also an agreement for product collaboration related to the Bank’s credit card with an associated benefits program. The agreement was renewed in 2018 for a duration of 5 years. The partnership has also included an agreement with Komplett AS for the development of a solution for integrating the Bank’s products for purchase financing (POS) into the Komplett group’s point-of-sale solutions. In Q4 2022, the Bank reached an agreement with Komplett Group to exit the POS financing partnership. This is a result of the jointly developed POS product no longer meeting expected returns, as well as progress in the Bank’s strategic repositioning. The Bank and Komplett Group have also agreed to terminate the agreement related to the use of the Komplett brand. As a result of the above, the POS product will be discontinued and the royalty fee agreement will be terminated effective from May 1, 2023. Komplett Bank will be launched under a new name in May 2023. The Bank’s products are implemented with all their core functionality as part of the trading platforms for komplett.no and komplett.se. All transactions with related parties are carried out on similar terms and conditions as if they had been entered into between independent parties. For more information on transactions with related parties, see note 21 in the annual report for 2021. 5. Shares and negotiability Komplett Bank’s shares are listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange with the ticker “KOMP” and are freely tradable. The articles of association do not contain any restrictions related to owning, trading or voting for the Bank’s shares. 6. General Assembly Through the General Assembly of Komplett Bank, the shareholders exercise the supreme authority in the Bank. According to the articles of association, the Annual General Meeting must be held each year by the end of April.
