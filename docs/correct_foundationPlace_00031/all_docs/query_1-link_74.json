        "text": "The University of Southern Maine Foundation announced that it has received a $50,000 pledge from Norway Savings Bank, a leading mutual banking and financial services company headquartered in Norway, Maine. The Bank’s commitment represents a five-year sponsorship that will support the completion of the McGoldrick Center for Career & Student Success, now under construction on the University of Southern Maine (USM) Portland Campus and scheduled to open this coming September.\n\nThe McGoldrick Center Sponsorship Program offers employer partners like Norway Savings Bank exceptional visibility, brand recognition, and promotional opportunities in the center of USM’s Portland campus transformation. Norway Savings is sponsoring the Student Government Association Office, on the third floor of the new McGoldrick Center, where a plaque will designate the Bank as a “Founding Sponsor.” Sponsors enjoy a variety of benefits aimed at amplifying connections between employers and USM.\n\n“The University of Southern Maine is an incredible resource for its students, staff, faculty, alumni and the community at large,” said Dan Walsh, Norway Savings Bank’s president and CEO. “We’re pleased to assist with the construction of the McGoldrick Center, which will greatly benefit the USM community and greater Portland for years to come.”\n\nAinsley Wallace, president and CEO of the University of Southern Maine Foundation, added, “Norway Savings Bank has been an important longtime partner to the University and we are very pleased that they will have a prominent presence when we open the new McGoldrick Center this fall. The Bank’s dedication to the growth and betterment of Maine communities aligns them perfectly with the Center’s goal of connecting our students to the business community in impactful, equitable, and mutually beneficial ways. We are deeply grateful for their partnership and their generous support.”\n\nThe new McGoldrick Center will serve as the Portland campus crossroads, where students, faculty, alumni, and employers can connect and collaborate. The Center’s second floor will be home to USM’s expanded Career & Employment Hub, where the employer community intersects with students in the academic community. The third floor of the Center is dedicated to cultivating student leadership opportunities and connections with spaces set aside for USM’s Student Government Association, Diversity Center, and more.\n\nWith dining facilities, meeting and conference rooms, student activity rooms, and the expanded Career Hub, the Center is among the most environmentally sustainable buildings on USM’s transforming Portland campus. It is a three-story, 42,000 square-foot space that is sustainably designed to achieve LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) Silver certification. It will overlook the new campus quad, named the “Bean Green,” and sits adjacent to Portland Commons, the first residence hall on USM’s Portland campus."
