        "text": "Depending on the season, you will either have a free day to explore Kathmandu's bustling streets and significant landmarks or embark on a bus ride to Ramechap, a small town that operates flights to Lukla, the gate way trekking in the Everest region. Overnight: Radisson Hotel or Private eco-camp *NB: Domestic flights to/from Lukla may operate from Manthali Airport, Ramechap during spring and autumn trekking seasons (March to May and October to December). This is determined by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal and dates are subject to change. Your leader will brief you on flight arrangements locally.\n\nMeals: B\n\nWe have an early start with a short flight to STOL airstrip at Lukla. The Tenzing-Hillary Airport in Lukla was established by Sir Edmund Hillary to help access the Everest region and the Sherpa people. It is a picturesque flight with marvelous views of the Eastern Himalaya. Once at Lukla we are immediately presented with views of huge peaks surrounding the village, offering a glimpse of what is to come. Our crew assembles and we head downhill towards the Dudh Kosi, a raging river that flows from the highest peaks. The broad and well-marked trail meanders around fields of potatoes and buck-wheat, passing through small villages and rows of dahlia trees to our first overnight campsite at Ghat. Overnight: Exclusive eco-comfort camp\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nToday we cross and re-cross the thundering glacial river, named \"Dudh\" (milk) Kosi (river) because of its colour. Sections of today's walk are through pine forest and cleared areas reveal terraced fields and a variety of crops. We pass small groups of donkeys and yaks carrying trading goods and trek-gear along the trail. A dzopko is a yak-cow crossbreed while a yak is a full-blood long haired male, more commonly found at higher altitudes. Spectacular mountain peaks unfold above us and seem to hover above the tree-line as they rise above the deep river valley. Shortly after leaving camp we cross the Kusum Khola, a tributary stream to the Dudh Kosi, and the peak of Kusum Kangru (6369 m) can be seen to the East, at the head of the valley. Further along the trail, across the valley to the North-West, Nupla (5885 m) and Kongde Ri (6093 m) rise above the forested ridges. At a turn of the trail, Thamserku (6808 m) rises majestically, seemingly from the river floor. We will see our first Mani walls today. These stone structures are a compilation of many stone tablets, each with the inscription \"Om Mani Padme Hum\" which translates to \"Hail to the jewel in the lotus\", and is mantra (chant) venerated by Buddhists and Brahmans alike. Buddhists will walk to the left of these Mani Walls and chortens, but you may notice that people of the lowlands who have no knowledge of Buddhism do not follow this practice. The allure of the mountains is hard to resist, but we must be patient, as it is very important to acclimatise slowly and thereby fully appreciate our time at higher altitude. Today's walk is not a long one, and you will be eager to press on. Slow down, and enjoy the journey. Overnight: Exclusive eco-comfort camp\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nThis morning we cross the green/aqua waters of the Dudh Kosi and pass through the gates of the Sagamartha National Park. The establishment of this national park is a significant attempt to stem the use of fire-wood in the area. Self-contained trek groups must use only kerosene fuels for cooking, a philosophy we follow everywhere in Nepal, whether we are in a national park or not. Tea-houses and lodges are encouraged to use kerosene, yak dung or electricity but unfortunately continue to use mostly fire-wood for cooking, heating and for hot water for trekker's showers. This practice continues to deplete the forests. We follow the river course to the confluence of the Dudh Kosi and the Bhote Kosi and cross a spectacular high bridge before commencing our ascent to the village of Namche Bazaar, the Sherpa \"capital\" of Nepal. It is a tough climb as the trail passes through forest of pine to a vantage point that provides our first view of Mt Everest. The trail continues to climb and meander to Namche and the sight of this prosperous village spread within a horse-shoe shaped valley opposite the beautiful peak of Kongde Ri is worth every step. After lunch you may wish to peruse the Tibetan trader's stalls or the Sherpa shops in search of a bargain. Overnight: eco-lodge\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nOur trek will start with an incline to Syangboche airstrip and along the ridgeline towards Everest View Hotel. We are welcomed with magnificent views of the surrounding mountains including Everest, Lhotse, Thamserku, Khangtega, Ama Dablam and many more. After a quick break, we continue towards Khumjung and visit Sir Edmond Hillary’s famous “Schoolhouse in the clouds.”This school was the first in the entire Khumbu region being built in 1961 with the help of the Sir Edmund Hillary and the Himalayan Trust. The school originally opened with only two classrooms but has since expanded to cater for over 350 students. We descend and follow the trail for approx 25 minutes to our new exclusive campsite at Kyangjuma. For those who are feeling the early effects of altitude can opt for a shorter acclimatization walk of around 2 hours directly from Namche to Kyangjuma. Overnight: Exclusive eco-comfort camp\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nThe walk to Pangboche is one of the most spectacular trekking days in Nepal. The trail starts with a gradual descent through rhododendron and pine forests as we approach a suspension bridge to cross the Dudh Kosi. We start our climb through pine forests to the top of a long ridge which flows from the summit of Kantega. If we are lucky, we may come across local wildlife including the Himalayan Thar, Musked Deer and the vibrant Danphe Pheasant, the national bird of Nepal. A traditional gateway and chorten welcomes us to the village of Thyangboche. From the steps of the Monastery we will be rewarded to a clear view of Everest between Nuptse and Lhotse as well as Peak 38, Shartse and Ama Dablam. Thyangboche is considered the spiritual heart of the Khumbu Valley and the monastery was re-built with the help of Sir Edmund Hillary after being decimated by a fire in 1989. We continue down hill to Deboche for lunch before making our final push to Pangboche. Overnight: Exclusive eco-comfort camp\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nWe are gaining altitude and it is important that we move at a slow, steady pace. The slopes are quite barren now as we move above the tree line. Views of different peaks, such as Cholatse and Lobuche, unfold before us in this contrasting and spectacular landscape. We move up the Dhugla Ridge and onto moraine towards the Khumbu Glacier. Rock cairns can be seen, many of which are dedicated to the memory of climbers attempting the high mountains of the area, including Everest. The temperatures drop here as we are more exposed amongst this glacial moraine. We enjoy spectacular views all day today of Pumori and Nuptse. The hill above the town affords fine sunset views of Nuptse. Overnight eco lodge (please note that single supplements cannot be guaranteed at Lobuche during peak periods).\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nWe trek alongside the Khumbu Glacier as the path winds over the rocky moraine towards the settlement of Gorak Shep. We are high, among the glaciers of the world's highest peaks. Following our arrival at Gorak Shep we have an early lunch before we commence our trek to Everest Base Camp. In the pre monsoon season many expeditions can be seen at base camp and this excursion is one of the highlights of the trek. Overnight lodge (please note that single supplements cannot be guaranteed at Gorak Shep during peak periods).\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nKala Pattar is not a Nepali name but a Hindi name and translates to \"black rock\". From these black rocks atop the hill the views are spectacular. Most eyes are locked on the mass of Everest and its rocky buttresses immediately before us. Many of the famous ascent routes are quite clear. Below us the Khumbu Glacier snakes towards the icefall and Western Cwm. We can see the area where expeditions set their base camp but the original site was at Lake Camp, now known as Gorak Shep. Take a look in every direction and soak it in. The view south and our route out is particularly beautiful. In the afternoon we make the return trek to our exclusive eco-comfort camp at Dingboche, soon after setting off we reach the site of a row of cairns to Sherpa climbers who died on Everest, before we continue to the small settlement at Tugla. Our path on an old lateral moraine takes us to the sheltered village of Dingboche and our permanent camp. To the east at the head of the Imja Khola valley sits the pyramid peak of Imja Tse (6189 m). This afternoon we can walk up the ridge behind Dingboche for sunset views of Nuptse, Lhotse and Chhukung Peak.\n\nMeals: B,L,D\n\nIf the weather is clear, the mountain views as we approach Namche Bazaar are outstanding. As we approach the end of our trek, we have time to peruse the tibetan shops for souvenirs or even wander the Sherpa capital and relax with a coffee. Leaving Namche we descend through the forest towards the Dudh Kosi, and continue our return journey crossing and re-crossing the river. It will seem like a long time since we ascended through the villages on our first days of the trek, as we have witnessed many stunning views on our trek into the highest mountain range in the world. We exit Sagarmatha National Park and reach Monjo for our overnight camp. Overnight: Exclusive eco-comfort camp\n\nMeals: B,L,D"
