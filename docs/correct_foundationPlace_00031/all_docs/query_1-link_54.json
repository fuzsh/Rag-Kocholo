        "text": "Screen City was established in 2013 in Stavanger, Norway. From 2017 it will be presented as Screen City Biennial in close collaboration with local and international art institutions and organizations. The Biennial presents a new platform that works to explore uses of the moving image in contemporary artistic practice.\n\nFor the 2017 Screen City Biennial edition titled Migrating Stories, Stavanger harbor – its architectonic position in the landscape and its surroundings – will be an important focus for production and presentations of the art. The Biennial will present moving image artworks from a broad range of international artists in dialogue and conjunction with the urban sphere and context in the city of Stavanger.\n\nScreen City Biennial is produced by Art Republic – Norway. Art Republic is a platform dedicated to digital art & public space. Inspired by the encounters between art and new technology, and the contemporary expression constantly being born through this meeting point. Art Republic consults, curates and produce projects that seek new approaches towards expanded cinematic experiences. Art Republic empowers research & projects dedicated to the creation of new exhibition & distribution models for the moving image, and enforcing the line of art-tech entrepreneurship.\n\nSource: screencitybiennial.org"
