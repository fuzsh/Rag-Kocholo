        "text": "The Nobel Peace Center is the museum about the Nobel Peace Prize. The permanent installations tell the story of Alfred Nobel and the Nobel Peace Prize laureates and their engaged and groundbreaking work.\n\nLocated in the heart of Oslo, Norway, the Nobel Peace Center is a place where you can experience and learn about the various Nobel Peace Prize laureates and their activities as well as the remarkable history of Alfred Nobel. It also serves as a meeting place where exhibitions, discussions and reflections related to war, peace and conflict resolution are in focus. The center combines exhibits and films with digital communication and interactive installations, and has already received acclaim for its modern design and use of state-of-the-art technology. The British architect David Adjaye, the American designer David Small and a number of other artists have contributed to making the center an exciting reason to visit Oslo.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Center is located in an old train station building from 1872, close to the Oslo City Hall and overlooking the harbor."
