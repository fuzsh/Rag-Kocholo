        "text": "Catalogues\n\nThe National Library of Poland provides a broad range of information services based on the catalogues of its own collections, union catalogues, and Polish and foreign information resources. Intensive work is underway on retroconversion of the traditional card catalogue – i. e., its transfer to electronic format. Since 1997 the main online catalogue has been using INNOPAC software. The data in the catalogue are encoded in the Unicode standard, owing to which the National Library may cooperate with the European Library – a portal for searching the content of most of Europe’s libraries.\n\nBibliographic activity\n\nThe National Library of Poland performs the duties of the national bibliographic agency, and at the same time the national centre of information on library documents. It compiles and publishes both the print-on-paper and the electronic version of the current and retrospective national bibliography, and special bibliographies: a bibliography of Polish bibliographies and a bibliography of library science.\n\nThe current national bibliography is composed of “Przewodnik Bibliograficzny” [Bibliographic Guide], which registers books, “Bibliografia Zawartości Czasopism” [Index to Periodicals], “Bibliografia Wydawnictw Ciągłych” [Bibliography of Serials], “Bibliografia Wydawnictw Ciągłych Nowych, Zawieszonych i Zmieniających Tytuł” [Bibliography of Serials – New, Suspended and Changed Titles”], and ‘‘Polonica Zagraniczne” [Foreign Polonica], as well as the “Bibliografia Dokumentów Elektronicznych” [Bibliography of Electronic Documents] published since 2001, and the “Bibliografia Dokumentów Kartograficznych” [Bibliography of Cartographic Documents] covering data since 2002.\n\nTwo statistical reports prepared at the National Library of Poland are helpful in defining the situation of the book and libraries in Poland: the official statistics of Polish publishing generated on the basis of the data registered in the current national bibliography and published as the annual “Ruch Wydawniczy w Liczbach” [Polish Publishing in Figures], and the annually published “Biblioteki Publiczne w Liczbach” [Public Libraries in Figures]."
