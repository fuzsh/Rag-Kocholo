        "text": "Most significant for CED itself is the Hector Hodler Library, one of the world’s largest collections of books and archives about Esperanto and planned languages. Hodler, the Swiss founder of the Universal Esperanto Association (UEA), died at the age of just 33 in 1920, and his widow donated his collection of three to four thousand items to UEA. This library remained in Geneva and grew under the curatorship of Hans Jakob until 1962. From then on, for 60 years it was located at the headquarters of UEA in Rotterdam, where it constantly expanded with the influx of new publications and came to occupy more and more space, until it was moved to a special fire-resistant set of shelves on the ground floor of the building.\n\nIn 2022, following an agreement with the Austrian National Library, about 5% of the Hodler Library (including about 800 archive boxes with documents pertaining to the history of UEA itself) was transported to Vienna for professional preservation. Most of the collection, however, remained in Rotterdam, and a working group led by CED sought a solution that would ensure the collection’s future and its accessibility for researchers. In 2023, through a new agreement with the National Library of Poland, the remaining collection – comprising about 7 tons of books, pamphlets, magazines and newsletters, posters, audio materials, tourism leaflets and many other items – was shipped to Warsaw. After drying and chemical treatment for mould and mildew, the long work of cataloguing this historical treasure began. In the future, researchers will be able to search the contents by means of the National Library of Poland’s online catalogue and to consult the physical materials on site.\n\nTo explore the Hodler collection in the Austrian National Library in Vienna, search for the label V75. That part of the collection can also be consulted in person in Vienna."
