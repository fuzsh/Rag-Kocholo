Starting June 4th, interlibrary loan service (also called “van delivery”) is temporarily suspended until further notice. This service allows patrons to request items from libraries throughout the state and have those items sent directly to their home library for pickup. This means, effective immediately, we cannot request any books or items from another library for you until the van delivery service resumes, and that could potentially take months. This pause affects all participating Maine Libraries. The Maine State Library’s contract with the current van delivery expires this month. While we do not have an exact timeline available yet, we anticipate the transition to a new delivery provider to impact most of the summer. We will share updates a soon as they are available.\n\nGOOD NEWS: ILL IS SCHEDULED TO START TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3RD *******************************************\n\n************************************************************************************************************************************************\n\nhttps://login.librarypass.com/?library=library&domain=librarypass.com\n\nAccess to thousands of digital comics, graphic novels, and manga from 100+ library-friendly publishers — without holds, wait lists, or limits.
