        "text": "Polish Alphabet Book\n\nIconic Polish Works on Posters by Young Artists\n\nJune 12 – July 31, 2024\n\nPoster - Opening ceremony\n\nHow to define modern national culture in 44 works? To select the ones that have become an international brand of the country? Will it be The Witcher, Solaris or The Pianist? Only words are not enough – experimental posters of eleven young Polish artists try to find answers and ask their own questions.\n\nThe exhibition features 44 works that were created in Poland after 1918 and gained international fame or are typical of the work of authors, whose renown crossed national boarders. From literature, through music, visual arts and film, you will find famous names, like Agnieszka Holland, Stanisław Lem, Andrzej Wajda, Olga Tokarczuk, Robert Konieczny, Tomasz Bagiński, Andrzej Sapkowski, Alina Szapocznikow, Roman Ingarden, Magdalena Abakanowicz, Wilhelm Sasnal, Jerzy Grotowski, Krzysztof Penderecki, Wisława Szymborska, Czesław Miłosz, Krzysztof Kieślowski. No less interesting, however, are the posters of young Polish artists, who translate their works into a symbolic graphic language. They are a tribute to another phenomenon: the Polish poster school. There is also a reading corner with a selection of books dedicated to certain personalities.\n\nThe Klementinum Gallery\n\nTuesday to Sunday, 10 a.m. – 6 p.m.\n\nAdmission free\n\nVasil Bykav - 100\n\nJune 20 – August 31, 2024\n\nOpening ceremony\n\nThe exhibition on the occasion of the 100th birthday anniversary of a Belarussian writer features his works and their translations from the collections of the Slavonic Library, as well as original letters, photographs and personal objects.\n\nVasil Bykav (19. 6. 1924 – 22. 6. 2003) was and still is one of the most important and most read Belarussian writers, both in his country and abroad. For the Belarussians, he remains the great moral authority. Films, theatre plays and also a ballet were made based on his literary works. Most of his novels were translated in Czech. As an opponent of the Lukashenko´s régime, he spent the last years of his life mostly abroad. On the invitation of Václav Havel, he lived several months in Prague.\n\nThe exhibition has been organised by the Skaryna Educational Association and the National Library of the CR – Slavonic Library.\n\nKlementinum, 1st floor (gate A)\n\nMon - Fri 9 am - 7 pm\n\nAdmission to the exhibition for the NL registered users and those with a one-day Admission Ticket in the NL Opening Hours\n\nNL readers entrance free\n\nThe Graduates of the Department of Fine Arts, UMPRUM - Academy of Arts, Architecture & Design\n\nJune 27 – July 4, 2024\n\nThe display presents final works by this year graduates from the Department of Fine Arts, of the Academy of Arts, Architecture & Design in Prague. Graduates from five studios represent contemporary approaches to various artistic media from painting, sculpture, through installation, to video and film. Through their placement, the individual works try to highlight the historical character of usually inaccessible space of the former reading room of the Technical Library at the Klementinum.\n\nKlementinum, Hall No. 101, 1st floor (gate B)\n\nMon - Sat 10 am - 6 pm\n\nNL readers entrance free"
