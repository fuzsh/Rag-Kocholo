Among them are many precious, unique masterpieces by early printers in Italy, France, Germany and the Low Countries.\n\nThe Library has created the electronic catalogue of the sixteenth-century publications by converting old hand-written catalogues of the Imperial Public Library to machine-readable form. It comprises 36 202 bibliographic records of three kinds: most of these records are brief descriptions, some of them are expanded or full scientific descriptions, displayed in the RUSMARC format.\n\nThe quality of the information reflects the cataloguing standards for early printed books.\n\nThe catalogue records represent work in progress which may be edited and added.\n\nThe Rare Books Department's collection of incunabula is largest in Russia.

Newly-received information on items from the 1st Cadet Corps Library, held in other libraries, helps to expand the coverage of the database.\n\nThe Books in West European Languages Published in Russia between 1701 and 1800 is a database created by converting data from the printed Union Catalogue of Foreign Language Books Published in Russia during the 18th Century to an electronic format. This includes descriptions for documents published both by Russian printers and by publishing firms that used foreign printing facilities. The NLR (Rossica collection) holds 60% of the documents listed in the printed catalogues.\n\nThe compilers prepared some descriptions when viewing the book at first-hand. The database contains 2200 records for books, pamphlets, periodicals, as well as decrees, manifestos and other government publications with title-page or title information. The database includes material in various fields of knowledge and in many European languages: Latin (scientific writings and belles-lettres, mainly verses and speeches on different occasions); German (works on mathematics, philosophy and linguistics, travel writings, etc.); French (fiction, books on natural sciences and history, generally published in the second half of the 18th century), Italian (libretti, presentation verses and speeches on different occasions), Greek and Polish (textbooks, presentation verses and speeches on different occasions), and some others.\n\nThe electronic catalogue of the Publications in Yiddish from Collections of the Asian & African Literature Department was launched in 2006.

Records of music scores, maps (see Cartographic Materials) and newspapers are excluded from the database.\n\nPlease note!\n\nThe catalogue will only find records that are written on guide cards.\n\nThe guide cards devide the catalogue into separate sections for easier search. A typical section comprises about 50 cards, each one numbered sequentially. The catalogue search identifies the guide card, which is at the beginning of each section.

Volume eight is still in course of preparation and will be published soon.\n\nThe catalogue describes not only our Library's collections but also holdings of 1202 organizations from 41 countries. Catalogue records were compiled from a wide range of external sources, including domestic and foreign libraries, book chambers, museums, archives, universities. The compilers made maximum use of electronic and printed catalogues, bibliographic indexes, bibliographic resources on the Internet and so on.\n\nToday the Library continues to add records to the catalogue.

It has been a long process creating the catalogue. In the early stages of the work, the catalogue described our Library's eighteenth-century collections. Later, catalogue records were compiled from a wide range of external sources, including libraries, museums, archives, universities. At present, the catalogue contains details for over 20,880 books, held in the National Library of Russia and in 166 other major Russian, Ukrainian, CIS countries and Baltic institutions. In 2006, the database was supplemented with descriptions of 5049 imperial decrees and manifestos available in the NLR. The similar printed union catalogue did not contain these data.\n\nThe quality of the information reflects the cataloguing standards for early printed books. The catalogue is regularly updated.

Periodical publications of an organization or learned society may be searched by the name of the organization.\n\nThe database Russian Journals/Serials of the First Quarter of the Ninteenth Century. A Description of the Content was compiled between 1995 and 2006 in preparation for the Union Catalogue of Russian Journals/Serials (1801-1825) (vols.1-3).\n\nThere was a need of experts in literature, history, bibliography for search for individual works included in journals published during the reign of Alexander I. In response, compilers of the Russian Journals/Serials of the First Quarter of the Ninteenth Century placed the local database, describing the content of 84 journals from this period on the site of the National Library of Russia. This resource, containing over 29 thosand entries, enables users to search by author/editor, by title, year of publication, geographical index. The records correspond to the text of three printed volumes, but a name index is represented in a more simplified form.\n\nAll other details about journals (a full bibliographic description of an item, its creation story, its censorship story, list of literature, a location in libraries etc) you can find only in the ptinted catalogue.\n\nThe union electronic catalogue Russian Newspapers (1703 - 1917) was created as a result of co-operative efforts of the three libraries: the National Library of Russia (NLR) in Saint Petersburg, the Russian State Library (RSL) and the State Public Historical Library (SPHL) in Moscow. Descriptions of newspapers from the collections of these libraries form the basis of the catalogue. They enriched by entries for newspapers, held at the Scientific Library of Federal Archives (SL FA), the Sverdlov Regional Universal Scientific Library named after V.

It resulted in a list of the newspapers in the Roman alphabet, provided for the attention of readers.\n\nThe list represents the most accurate copy of the card Catalogue of Yiddish Newspapers: even the notes of cataloguers on cards are retained as far as possible. The notes also reflect differences in versions of bibliographic descriptions of various newspapers. If necessary, information from the catalogue is confirmed in the notes by the word \"sic\". At this stage of the work, reconciliation of the newspaper holdings was done only for selected items.\n\nThe list is presented in two versions. The first is the Alphabetical Index of titles, provided with numbers and notes. For each title, it gives the dates and place of its publication and issues available in the NLR. The Geographical Index is arranged alphabetically by the place of publication, then by title. It is incomplete as compared with the title index, since the place of publication is not always included in the catalogue entry. The geographic list shows only the titles of newspapers and years of publication.\n\nThe Union Catalogue of Publications in Finno-Ugric contains bibliographic details for publications in Finno-Ugric languages, covering Ingrian, Lappish, Karelian, Udmurt, Khanty, Komi, Mansi, Mari, Mordvin, Sámi, Udmurt, Veps.\n\nThe catalogue records for pre-revolutionary publications (printed before 1917) were compiled from a range of external sources including National Libraries of Republics of Karelia, Komi, Mariy-El, Mordovia, Udmurtia, as well as the National Library of Finland at the Helsinki University and the Institute for the Languages of Finland.\n\nThe catalogue lists every publication in Ingrian, Lappish, Khanty, Mansi or Veps, held in the National Library of Russia.
