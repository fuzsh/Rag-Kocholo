        "text": "The German National Library now collects digital music\n\nLicense: Punctum, Stefan Hoyer\n\nThe German National Library's collection of online publications currently encompasses more than 16 million titles, including e-books, university publications, journals, daily newspapers, sheet music, audio books, digitised works and websites.\n\nAnd digital music has now been added to the list! The new workflow has been live since June 2024 and the first music audio files have already been successfully imported. The metadata standard DDEX ERN 4.3 is used for deposits.\n\nMore (only available in German)\n\n4 million tables of contents\n\nBildmontage: Stephan Jockel, DNB\n\n4 million digitised tables of contents consisting of 9 million pages are now available through our catalogue and metadata services. They are accessed more than 16,000 times a day.\n\nAll tables of contents can be searched using the fulltext search function; they make our media collection more visible and easier to access. They are also used in automated subject cataloguing processes.\n\nWork on digitising the tables of contents is still ongoing. By the end of 2024, there will be 5 million freely accessible tables of contents available for use.\n\nMore (only available in German)\n\nThe German Exile Archive mourns the loss of Dr. Ruth K. Westheimer\n\nFoto: DNB/Sylvia Asmus\n\nThe famous US-American sex therapist died on 12 July 2024 at her home in New York City at the age of 96.\n\nHer life story was part of the exhibition “Child emigration from Frankfurt” in 2021. She generously supported the Exile Archive with information, interviews and material.\n\nWe are grateful for the encounters with this impressive personality and mourn this great loss.\n\nMore\n\nFrank Scholze re-elected Chair of CENL\n\nPhoto: Alexander Paul Englert\n\nFrank Scholze, Director General of the German National Library, has been confirmed in his position as Chair of the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL). The elections to the Executive Committee took place at the 38th CENL Annual General Meeting at the National Library of Poland in Warsaw. Frank Scholze has chaired CENL since 2021. Since then, the CENL Secretariat has also been located in the German National Library.\n\nMore (only available in German)\n\nDepartment of User Services and Collection Management has a new head\n\nPhoto: Philipp Reichelt\n\nSusanne Theile became Head of the Department of User Services and Collection Management on 1 July 2024. The 48-year-old architectural engineering graduate and librarian succeeds Jörg Räuber, who retired at the end of January 2024 after more than 49 years of successful work for the DNB. Along with her role as department head, her work mainly focuses on the strategic development and management of the cross-location department and the development and implementation of strategies, services and tools in the areas of storage logistics, digital cultural education, automation and digitisation. From 2014 on, Susanne Theile was the Director of the \"Georgius Agricola\" University Library at TU Bergakademie Freiberg. Besides being in charge of the library, she also planned and designed its new building."
