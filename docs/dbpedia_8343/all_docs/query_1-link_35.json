        "text": "European Heritage sites are milestones in the creation of todayâ€™s Europe. Spanning from the dawn of civilisation to the Europe we see today, these sites celebrate and symbolise European ideals, values, history and integration.\n\nSince 2013, these sites have been selected for their symbolic value, the role they have played in European history and activities they offer. These sites bring the European Union and its citizens closer together.\n\nThe uniqueness of the European Heritage label\n\nThe European Heritage Label has some differences compared to the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nEuropean Heritage sites bring to life the European narrative and the history behind it.\n\nEuropean Heritage sites focus on the promotion of the symbolic European values and the significant role these sites have played in the history and culture of Europe. They also offer valuable educational activities, especially for young people.\n\nEuropean Heritage sites can be enjoyed singly or as part of a network. Visitors can get a real feel for the breadth and scale of what Europe has to offer and what it has achieved."
