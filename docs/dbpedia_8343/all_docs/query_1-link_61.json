The exhibition intends to point out common memory and identity of Europe and to commemorate sites that symbolize important ideas and values. From 2015, the Olomouc Premyslid Castle and Archdiocesan Museum are the only Czech holders of the European Heritage Label.\n\nThe display is organised by the National Library of he CR in association with the National Heritage Institute, the latter being the national coordinator of the Label in the Czech Republic. The European Heritage Label is part of the European programme Creative Europe.\n\nGround floor – gate A\n\nOpen: Mon–Sat, 9 am – 7 pm\n\nAdmission CZK 10 (free for the NL registered readers)\n\nRelated by Choice / Subcarpathian and Ruthenian Inspiration and Challenges in Czech Literature\n\nNovember 1, 2018 –January 19, 2019\n\nInvitation - Opening ceremony - Photogallery\n\nThe exhibition on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the establishment of Czechoslovakia presents a selection of Czech and partly also Slovak professional and fiction literature, illustrated publications and guides, inspired by Subcarpathian Rus´ and the life of its inhabitants.

Kryl, V. Merta, J. Hutka, V. Třešňák etc. In totalitarian times, their music was mostly disseminated unofficially, sometimes even illegally, and yet they have succeeded in influencing several generations of listeners. The Czech folk singer-songwriters were independent on official communication channels, they were free and not afraid to tell truth in times when it was not safe. They don´t conceal their opinions even today.\n\nThe exhibition is organised by the National Library of the CR and Galén Publishing House in association with the Czech Centre of International PEN Club, the Library of Václav Havel, and Seznam.cz.
