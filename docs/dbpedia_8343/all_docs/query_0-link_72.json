All of our subscriptions offer unlimited, multi-user access and continued growth and are delivered on the Ebook Central platform built for research.\n\nMany libraries utilize subscription as an affordable base of foundational content tied to patron outcomes, and over time they leverage usage and user behavior statistics to inform their acquisition decisions. ProQuest subscriptions are designed to work better together with our other flexible purchase models, such as Demand-Driven Acquisition, Short-term Loans, Access to Own, and Perpetual Archive—to meet both budget and patron demand."
