        "text": "Dear colleagues\n\nTo those who were able to attend the 2023 Conference of Directors of National Libraries in Rotterdam – thank you. I look forward to an equally enjoyable event this year in Brisbane.\n\nI write today on behalf of myself and CDNL Vice-Chair Leslie Weir seeking nominations for the second CDNL Vice-Chair position. Information on the role and requirements can be found in the CDNL Statutes.\n\nA number of members have already expressed interest in stepping into this role, which is very satisfying. However, I encourage all members interested in nominating to do so formally via email to cdnl@nla.gov.au.\n\nWe plan to hold an election for the Vice-Chair position during the CDNL Annual Meeting on Thursday, 03 October 2024, during the 2024 IFLA Information Futures Summit. This means we will need your nominations no later than 5pm Australian Eastern Standard Time, on Thursday 26 September 2024.\n\nMarie-Louise\n\nDr Marie-Louise Ayres | Director-General | she/her/hers\n\n02 6262 1390 | mayres@nla.gov.au | National Library of Australia\n\nChair: Conference of Directors of National Libraries – cdnl@nla.gov.au\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nI write to invite you to register for the 2024 CDNL Annual Meeting, in Brisbane, Australia on 3 October 2024. Registrations will close on Friday 30 August.\n\nRegister for CDNL and professional tour of National Library of Australia here.\n\nI request that each individual attendee complete the registration form to assist with catering and other function requirements.\n\nIFLA Information Futures Summit\n\nOur CDNL meeting will follow the IFLA Information Futures Summit in Brisbane, which runs from 30 September to 3 October 2024. Early bird registration for the Summit closes Monday 17 June 2024. I hope to see many of you at this wonderful opportunity to ‘be stronger together’.\n\nCDNL – 3 October\n\nThe October 2024 CDNL will run as an in-person event only. The event – as with Conference membership – is open to chief executives of all national libraries.\n\nWe will be meeting at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre (BCEC), the same location as the IFLA Summit.\n\nOur theme for 2024 will be Leading Libraries through Cyber Security Disasters. We have colleagues from two national libraries joining us to speak about what these disasters require of us as leaders. We will also hear from an Australian expert, to speak to the demands of leadership in an increasingly complex cyber security environment. We will share an agenda in coming weeks.\n\nAs there are no membership fees for CDNL, we are unable to offer bursaries or other financial assistance to participants.\n\nProfessional tour of the National Library of Australia\n\nOn Friday 4 October – the day after CDNL – the National Library will offer a professional tour of our building and operations in our national capital, Canberra.\n\nAustralia is a big country! For those planning to travel to Canberra, please bear in mind that flight time Brisbane-Canberra is around 1 hour, 40 minutes (950km).\n\nCanberra is not an international airport, so you will need to exit Australia via another city– return to Brisbane, or fly out via Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or Perth.\n\nFor a return flight and accommodation for one night, you can expect additional costs upwards of AU$1000.\n\nFormal invitations\n\nWe can provide formal invitations for named individuals for the purposes of note verbales and visa applications. We have registered CDNL as an official Government meeting with our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but cannot assist further with visa applications.\n\nElection\n\nDuring the October Annual Meeting, we will hold an election for the role of Vice-Chair. CDNL has two Vice-Chair roles; one is occupied by Leslie Weir from Libraries and Archives Canada and the other is vacant.\n\nIn the next few weeks, we will call for nominations for this role. For your convenience, the CDNL Statutes provide an overview of the Committee, including the roles and responsibilities of its members and officers.\n\nFuture online meeting\n\nI had hoped to host an online meeting earlier this year, but this has not proved possible. I now expect to schedule an online meeting for early 2025.\n\nCall for expressions of interest for attendance and speakers will be sent in due course.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nMarie-Louise\n\nDr Marie-Louise Ayres | Director-General | she/her/hers\n\n02 6262 1390 | mayres@nla.gov.au | National Library of Australia\n\nChair: Conference of Directors of National Libraries – cdnl@nla.gov.au"
