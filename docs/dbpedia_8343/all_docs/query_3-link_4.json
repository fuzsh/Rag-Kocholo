        "text": "This text examines the impact of moral rights to non-disseminated works on the permissibility of libraries to digitise collections in which such works are embodied. Of fundamental importance in this respect is the author’s moral right of disclosure, consisting of the right to decide on the first making available of a work to the public. The article presents the genesis and development of the system of copyright, inter alia in Poland, which, in relation to the author’s economic rights, may be described as proprietary, which justifies the use of the notion of propertisation of copyright. However, the essence of the copyright system includes the expiration of rights to the economic exploitation of a work as it passes into the public domain, thereby enabling its digitisation by a library. To a limited extent, cultural heritage institutions also enjoy the right to use materials that are outside of the scope of the public domain, although their digitisation is subject to substantial limitations. Protection of the author’s economic rights is not, however, the only factor in the construction of these restrictions. They also result from the legal system’s recognition of moral rights, which include the right of disclosure (right of divulgation). This article discusses the phenomenon of the institutionalisation of moral rights, followed by their theoretical conceptualisation, resulting in the formation of two models in continental legal systems: a monistic one, in which moral rights belong to the content of copyright, and a dualistic one, in which they are derived from the protection of personal interests. The normative approach in force in Poland, starting from the first, pre-war copyright law, is based on the latter concept, which is a result of its author’s being inspired by French legal thought. As a result, a dualistic model was adopted in Poland, which assumes that the moral rights of authorship are inextinguishable and subject to be exercised after the death of the author by the author’s relatives. Moreover, it was the intention of the pre-war legislator to protect moral rights to arbitrarily old works, which meant that works created in the period before the existence of copyright protection were also covered. Such an approach was maintained in both the subsequent copyright law of the 1950s and the one in force today. This has a substantial impact on the permissibility to digitise unpublished material, significantly limiting the scope of the public domain, which is the primary source of objects made available digitally by cultural heritage institutions. Consequently, this article discusses the need to amend the copyright law by either shaping moral rights in a manner characteristic of monistic systems or changing the normative shape of the author’s right of disclosure to remove doubts concerning the permissibility of digitising unpublished material that is not the subject of author’s economic rights. Although this article focuses on the matter described above from the perspective of libraries, the points made herein apply to other types of cultural heritage institutions engaging in digitisation activity relating to their collections, i.e. archives and museums, collectively referred to as the GLAM sector.\n\nThe analysis of the library of Piotr Wolfram, a bachelor of laws educated in Prague, Padua, and Bologna, professor of the Kraków Academy, participant of the Council of Constance, and the collector of Peter’s Pence in Poland, reveals the tools which he used in building his career, surprisingly brilliant for a son of a burgher. The degree to which his library was typical for the period – library understood not only as a collection of codices but also a collection of texts – has been evaluated through the analysis of the popularity of individual works among the Kraków bar. The very presence of works by Italian lawyers in the collection does not unambiguously point to Italian intellectual education, as some Italian commentaries were included in the canon of literature taught at European universities. It has been determined that a clear indication of Wolfram’s Italian formation is provided by such texts as Apostillae to Francesco Zabarella’s commentary on the Liber Sextus or rhetorical texts by Italian authors – Bolognese university speeches or a letter by Petrarch yet unidentified in the catalogue of manuscripts of the Jagiellonian Library. In comparison to the library of Mikołaj Kicki, a lawyer with similar educational background (law studies in Bologna and Padua), Piotr Wolfram’s collection is rather lim¬ited, as it lacks some significant collections of canon law or most of the 13th-century commentaries on the Decretales. It mostly com¬prises legal dictionaries, concordances, repertories, and indices. The library is tailored to a practitioner rather than a creative com¬mentator of law, but the presence of rhetorical Italian texts makes it stand out from other contemporary libraries of Polish lawyers.\n\nIn 1945, book collections located in the Recovered Territories received the status of abandoned collections. The organised action of securing and taking them over by the state saved most of them from destruction and deliberate devastation. However, subsequent actions, consisting in repartitioning them, led to the dispersion of pre-war provenance sets. This also affected the incunabula of the former Marian Gymnasium (Marienstiftsgymnasium) in Szczecin. The school operated under this name in the years 1869–1945, but it was the continuation of the ducal Pedagogium founded in 1543. Its pride was the library (Bibliothek des Marienstifts–Gymnasiums zu Stettin), which at the end of the 19th century had over 34,000 volumes, including books, manuscripts, musical items, coins and cartographic materials. It is estimated that at the beginning of the second decade of the 20th century it collected at least 69 volumes printed in the 15th century. The first dispersion of the group took place in 1912, when four of them were sold to a library in Berlin. The surviving items were dispersed after 1945, among others, as a result of an official action to use the secured collections.\n\nThe purpose of the article is to investigate the newspapers from Halychyna from the period of independent Ukraine on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the fund of the Vasyl Stefanyk National Scientific Library of Ukraine in Lviv. Research is based on the general scientific principles of objectivity, systematicity, causality and historicism. Among the concrete scientific methods applied are historical and descriptive, analytical, problem-thematic, structural and typological. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was also used when processing the obtained results of the research. The scientific novelty of the research results lies in the fact that, for the first time in the history of Ukrainian press studies, editions stored in the fund of the Vasyl Stefanyk National Scientific Library of Ukraine in Lviv of newspapers from Halychyna from 1991–2021 have been analyzed. Conclusions. The scientific disclosure and processing of the library’s fund will provide an opportunity for modern researchers to create an objective and reliable picture of the past, to deepen the scientific study of the problems of the national historical heritage, and the repertoire of domestic periodicals."
