        "text": "1 Introduction\n\nThe history of libraries organizing (meta)data about their items is—perhaps—as old as the concept of libraries. The appearance of different media for the storage and transfer of human knowledge is correlated with the evolution of techniques and artifacts for encoding library metadata. A significant recent iteration of such an interplay is visible with the advent of information and communications technology and the accompanying attempt to implement cataloging techniques that draw upon the potentialities of such systems. Linked Data (LD) is the technology that embodies the current trends in metadata organization [2]. Linked Data is essential for the Semantic Web paradigm.\n\nLD is based on the endeavor to represent data using shared vocabularies for both individuals, their characteristics, and the relation between individuals. Such a metadata vocabulary references unique web identifiers (URI) in a machine-readable way that allows linkage to semantically related resources from other datasets. Modeling a certain dataset using linked data facilitates data integration between institutions and certain operations with the dataset, including knowledge discovery, enrichment, and visualization. The basic standards for such data models are RDF, OWL, SKOS, and SWRL [4].\n\nThere are two main reasons for libraries’ move towards linked data technologies. First, library resources are usually of different kinds, such as books, manuscripts, journals, drawings, etc. The meaning of such artifacts is intrinsically connected to the spatial and temporal contexts in which they are inserted, as well as other individuals to which they are linked, including author information, and other referred publications. Second, there is a trend of making institutional resources available and accessible for expanded collaboration possibilities. The advantages of linked data can be levered proportionally to the richness and interoperability of a given resource’s metadata.\n\nCommitment of Jagiellonian University (JU) and especially Jagiellonian Library (JL) to linked data is visible from its integration with the Europeana portal (https://europeana.eu/). Europeana—Europe’s digital cultural heritage platform integrating more than 3000 institutions—already offers access to more than 600.000 documents from the JL. The search and access of such documents depends on the metadata provided by the partner institution. Among the metadata elements currently provided by the JL, there is information about the type of item, subject, creation date, and language of the document.\n\nOn the one hand, the current metadata integrated into the Europeana portal can provide a powerful representation of the given document. On the other hand, there is a set of elements that, if present, would significantly enrich the given representation, and thus enhance the advantages of linked data. Such enrichment possibilities are especially present in the case of subtypes of manuscripts, e.g., in letters with information about the sender and receiver, or in historical documents with descriptive information about their history (Regest).\n\nGiven the prospects of a richer representation of manuscript metadata, the Jagiellonian Library supports the development of a standard for such a task. The main pillars of this endeavor are the inclusion of the detailed description format developed at the JL, the preservation of the possibility of integrating with Europeana, and the ability to integrate with the Kalliope system (catalog managed by German libraries). This paper describes the work in progress towards developing such a standard. In Sect. 2, we present the description format developed at JL (The Knowledge Matrix), and two related data models: Europeana’s EDM and Kalliope’s EAD. Sect. 3 then compares them, highlighting their points of compatibility and incompatibility. Sect. 4 concludes the paper.\n\n3 Comparison of metadata schemes\n\nDespite the differences between EAD and EDM, propositions exist on how to map elements from one standard to the other. Hennnicke et al. [3], for example, demonstrate how an archival finding aid encoded in EAD-XML format can be represented using an RDF-based model such as EDM. Furthermore, the extensive report by Rockenbauer et al. [8] summarizes the requirements and procedures for mapping mandatory EDM fields with the EAD standard. Drawing on the advancements presented by such works, Tab. 2 compares TKM, EDM, and Kalliope’s EAD as a guideline for the development of a standard for representing manuscripts’ metadata by the JL.\n\nThe first column of Tab. 2 presents the concept from the current TKM model, while two others present the respective EAD and EDM elements. Some elements are represented in the same way in both standards, for example, “Title”, “Description”, “Physical Extent”, “Subject”, “Identifier”, “Creation date”, “Language”, and “Current location”. Another case of mapping is when the representations are slightly different, but can be unproblematically mapped, such as (1) “Place of origin”, (2) “Custody history”. (3) “Other editions” and (4) “Person graphically represented”. In the case of (1), EDM has no element for encoding the place of origin, the place is connected with the object by the affirmation that the object has merely been in this place. Regarding (2), EAD allows for the representation of provenance linking a text explaining the history with a link to the given institutions (URI) holding the document, while EDM only allows for texts. In the case of (3), in EDM editions are separate objects reciprocally linked with the version properties, while in EAD information about editions are encoded in text format. Finally, for (4), EAD encodes it as a reference to a person, while EDM as a representation (that is not necessarily graphical).\n\nThe last set of concepts is those whose mapping cannot be made one to one, but need multiple elements from one standard to be mapped to multiple elements from the other. The most important of those concepts is “Interaction with a person”. This concept includes subconcepts such as “Creator”, “Sender”, “Receiver”, “Issuer”, etc. While the specification of the interaction with a person can be easily made in EAD by changing the role attribute, it is more difficult in EDM, which is limited by the three above-mentioned options. One clear example of such a difficulty is the pair “Sender” and “Receiver”. While the sender of a letter can be approximated to the creator of the letter, it is not necessarily the same as referring to the creator of an academic work. The receiver, on the other hand, can be considered as a mere person to whom the letter has come in contact (edm:hasMet), without acknowledging the intentionality of the letter. Another option for the “Receiver” would be mapping it as a contributor, which can be to some extent accurate, but is a different concept of, e.g., a co-author. Thus, in the case of “Interaction with a Person” the decision of how to map it has to be made based on the given dataset and the institution’s expectations.\n\nAnother concept in this subset is “Type of document”. Examples of possible types of documents are “Letters”, “Historical documents” or “Diary entries”. For EAD the representation of such types is clear, even allowing for a controlled id for each kind of type. EDM, on the other hand, offers three properties that are related to type. One of them is edm:type, which is an obligatory field for EDM with possible values “TEXT”, “VIDEO”, “SOUND”, “IMAGE” and “3D”. For manuscripts, the standard values would be “TEXT”. Another property is dc:type, which refers to a term from a controlled vocabulary that describes the nature or genre of the item, e.g., a book or a letter. Finally, edm:hasType is supposed to be a super-property of the former, encapsulating also material information about the object. In most cases edm:type and dc:type will have to be used, although on a case by case basis edm:hasType can also be implemented.\n\n“Material information” is another problematic concept to map. In EAD it is possible to describe different aspects of the material, such as its preservation state, works of restoration visible in the object, its state of preparation (e.g., if it is a draft), etc. EDM offers dcterm:medium as a description for the material carrier of a document, e.g., paper. A thorough manuscript standard should build upon the possibilities of EAD for representing material information.\n\nFinally, it is worth highlighting that the set of elements present in the comparison table is not exhaustive. The rationale for constructing such a table is to make it agnostic to the content of the manuscripts, to avoid the need for a thorough study of the object before collecting metadata. However, the table still fulfills the minimum requirements for the highest level of integration to both Kalliope and Europeana and provides rich metadata for computationally aided research in the field of cultural heritage."
