        "text": "Access Text\n\nIntroduction\n\nWelcome to the Library of Congress Treasures Exhibit QR Code Tour pages. These pages are for in-person visitors who would benefit from access to exhibit text on a digital device while walking around the exhibit.\n\nExhibition Introduction\n\nThe Library of Congress preserves collective memories representing entire societies as well as intimate records of important moments and rites of passage in individual lives. The inaugural exhibition in the David M. Rubenstein Treasures Gallery draws from the Library’s rich Americana and international holdings in more than 450 languages and in forms created across time and continents. Collecting Memories marks the ways and the means by which cultures preserve memory.\n\nThis exhibition juxtaposes voice recordings, moving images, scrolls, diaries, manuscripts, prints, photographs, maps, books, and so much more to inspire us to consider the connections and divergences among individual memory, collective memory, and recorded history. Collecting Memories explores how cultures may guide and honor memory, memorialize the past, assemble knowledge of the known world, create collective histories, recall the events of the day, or recount a life.\n\nDynamic moving images and sounds of treasured collections envelop the Gallery. They are a testament to the astounding range of what is here at the Library, while signaling that the collections themselves continue in a perpetual state of expansion.\n\nThe circular table at the exhibition’s center gives visitors direct interaction with a sampling of collection items and underscores a fundamental tenet of this remarkable institution: the Library of Congress collects, preserves, and serves its collections to you. Each station at the table provides an opportunity to watch and listen to a select collection items. Additional information about the contents of the interactive table are provided below.\n\nUsing QR Codes\n\nQR codes are located in the upper corner of the label rail, closest to the entrance.\n\nScan the QR code using the camera on your phone, tablet, or other personal device. A web page with the text description of each exhibit will open.\n\nThe QR codes are three-inch by three-inch squares.\n\nOn the floor directly below each QR code are two parallel, eleven-inch marker strips perpendicular to the exhibit cases and digital interactive table. One end of each strip is about two inches from the base of the case, just in front of the label rail.\n\nStart Your Tour\n\nYou can also use the list of links below to explore the exhibit descriptions. This list moves through the exhibits around the room starting to the right.\n\nGallery Orientation\n\nWhen you enter the rectangular room, you will be standing in front of an exhibit overview panel.The entrance is on the short side of the rectangle. The walls of the room display video of content from the Library of Congress collection along with related audio content. The room contains 4 2-sided, rectangular exhibit cases. Two cases run parallel with the long side of the room to your right and left. There is a gap between the cases. A circular table, in the center of the room, has objects that can be explored using touch and audio content.\n\nTo get started, go around this panel about 7 feet to the right or left and scan the QR code in the corner of the display that is closes to the entrance.\n\nInteractive Table\n\nThe circular interactive table allows you to interact with content from the Library collection. Each station at the table presents different content described below. Work your way around the table to experience it all.\n\nCuneiform Facsimiles Label\n\nAFRICAN & MIDDLE EASTERN DIVISION\n\nSumerian cuneiform tablets, between 2200 and 1900 BCE. Disbursement of skins (no. 11), Balanced account (no. 32), School exercise tablet (no. 02)\n\nCuneiform tablets represent one of the earliest known writing systems in the world, originating in ancient Sumeria. The thirty-eight tablets at the Library of Congress date from the reigns of Gudea of Lagash (214–2124 BCE) to Shalmanassar III (858–824 BCE) during the New Assyrian Empire (884–612 BCE). These tablets were acquired in 1929 from art dealer Kirkor Minassian as part of a collection illustrating the development of writing and book arts in the Middle East.\n\nKirkor Minassian Collection\n\nExhibit Item(s)\n\nSchool exercise tablet (no. 2) - The circular shape indicates this tablet was used by a student scribe. Practice tablets were left unfired, the intention being to reuse them.\n\nDisbursement of skins (no. 11) - This three-column tablet likely tracks accounting information. The reverse side states, “grand total of 574 cow hides,” followed by the word “disbursed.”\n\nBalanced account (no. 32) - This tablet tracks an account of barley. The first five lines describe the receipt of “29 gur” of barley. Five individual expenditures add up to 29, leaving a balanced account.\n\nScroll\n\nPRINTS & PHOTOGRAPHS DIVISION\n\nBarbara Carrasco. Pencil sketch for L.A. History: A Mexican Perspective, 1981\n\nTo retell the history of Los Angeles, the artist wove scenes—from prehistory to the city’s imagined future—through the flowing tresses of la Reina de los Ángeles (the Queen of Los Angeles). Carrasco included such notable figures as folk hero Joaquin Murrieta Carrillo, the city’s first Hispanic and first Black mayor; Bridget “Biddy” Mason; slain journalist Ruben Salazar; and United Farm Workers founders César Chávez and Dolores Huerta. For Carrasco: “This was my chance to show what I wish was in the history books.”\n\nMural photograph, 2017.

Soundies—forerunners to today’s music videos—were short 16-millimeter films played on a visual jukebox called a Panoram. Thousands of soundies were produced in the 1930s and 1940s, many of which feature Black performers in their only recorded on screen performance. Hot Chocolate features a phenomenal jitterbug routine by the Lindy Hoppers.\n\nDigital restoration provided by KINO Classics\n\nBook\n\nRARE BOOK & SPECIAL COLLECTIONS DIVISION\n\nL. Frank Baum, with illustrations by W.W. Denslow. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, 1900\n\nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz is one of the best-known stories in American literature. The Library of Congress has declared the work to be “America’s greatest and best-loved homegrown fairytale.” The book had a powerful effect on the American imagination. Its evocative use of the forces of nature and memorable characters—including Dorothy, the Scarecrow, The Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion—still invite children of all ages to look for wonder in the world around them.\n\nVeterans History Project\n\nOral History Excerpt: Kimberly Mitchell, U.S. Navy, War on Terrorism\n\nAdopted as an infant from a Vietnamese orphanage in 1972 by an American airman and his wife, Kimberly Mitchell embarked on a 17-year career with the Navy as a Surface Warfare Officer. After working on issues of warrior and family support and transition policy, she chose to leave the military in 2012 to help found the Dixon Center for Military and Veterans Services, and has gone on to serve in numerous leadership roles at organizations supporting veterans in transition.\n\nKimberly M.

He was sent to Korea for occupation duty. As the platoon leader of an all-Black unit, he was captured by the Chinese in November 1950. He escaped, made it back to Seoul, and rejoined the fighting. Wounded by enemy machine-gun fire in March 1951, Takahashi saw his wartime service come to an end.\n\nGene J. Takahashi Collection, Veterans History Project, American Folklife Center (AFC/2001/001/10309)\n\nOral History Excerpt: Elia Astrid Ortega, U.S. Army, Vietnam War\n\nArmy First Lieutenant Elia Ortega was initially drawn to the romantic vision of military nursing presented to her by recruiters—and their promise that she would not be sent to Southeast Asia unless she volunteered. After spending a year in California nursing patients wounded overseas, she was shocked to receive orders to go to Vietnam. Ortega describes how memories of service can be shaped by tough experiences.\n\nElia Astrid Ortega Collection, Veterans History Project, American Folklife Center (AFC/2001/001/81751)\n\nOral History Excerpt: Raffi Armen Bahadarian, U.S. Marine Corps, Iraq War\n\nHis parents brought him from Lebanon to America to escape the horrors of war, but Raffi Bahadarian grew to love his new country so much he was willing to serve in its armed forces. He signed up with the Marine Corps Reserves and was called up to fight in Operation Iraqi Freedom, joining the First Marine Division to be among the first U.S. soldiers into Baghdad.\n\nRaffi Armen Bahadarian Collection, Veterans History Project, American Folklife Center (AFC/2001/001/21418)\n\nAudio Records\n\nNATIONAL AUDIO-VISUAL CONSERVATION CENTER 1/11\n\nEurope’s Society Orchestra, James Reese Europe, conductor. “Too Much Mustard,” 1914\n\nBandleader James Reese Europe gained international fame as music director for the dance team of Vernon and Irene Castle, with whom he toured the U.S. and Europe.

The registry is a list of sound recordings deemed “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant” by the Library of Congress\n\nNATIONAL AUDIO-VISUAL CONSERVATION CENTER 4/11\n\nPaul Whiteman Orchestra with vocalist Bing Crosby. “If I Had a Talking Picture of You,” 1929\n\nPaul Whiteman was the most popular and influential American bandleader of the 1920s. In addition to filling concert halls and ballrooms across the country, Whiteman’s Victor records were always big sellers. Whiteman is credited for discovering and promoting talent such as Bing Crosby—providing vocals on this record—and Bix Beiderbecke, a jazz cornetist, among many others. This song’s lyrics celebrate the arrival of talking pictures.\n\nImage: Bain News Service, Prints & Photographs Division\n\nNATIONAL AUDIO-VISUAL CONSERVATION CENTER 5/11\n\nDorothy Thompson. Commentary on the Nazi invasion of Poland, 1939\n\nJournalist Dorothy Thompson spent most of the 1920s and early 1930s in Europe, covering politics and culture in print, interviewing subjects as varied as Sigmund Freud and Adolph Hitler. In the late summer of 1939, she made daily broadcasts analyzing the last days of peace and first days of war in Europe.

Lipsky, recorder. The Old Foghorn from Kewaunee Lighthouse, 1972\n\nFor 72 years, the Kewaunee foghorn guided ships through the thick fog on Lake Michigan. Its call became a regular part of life in Kewaunee, averaging more than six and a half hours of sound per day in 1959. Professor James Lipsky recorded 31 minutes of the Kewaunee foghorn during a visit to his hometown. He captured sounds of the foghorn, diesel train, and car ferry horn—all things that no longer exist in Kewaunee. This recording was added to the National Recording Registry in 2005.\n\nImage: Kewaunee Pierhead Lighthouse, U.S. Coast Guard External\n\nNATIONAL AUDIO-VISUAL CONSERVATION CENTER 11/11\n\nFunky Four Plus One More. “Rappin and Rockin the House,” 1980\n\nThe Funky Four Plus One More were a groundbreaking group formed in the early days of hip hop in the Bronx. As performers, they achieved many “firsts.” They were one of the first hip hop groups to secure a record deal, the first group with a female MC (Sha Rock), and they were the first hip hop act to appear on national television, performing on Saturday Night Live. Despite their early success, the group was short lived, disbanding by 1983.\n\nImage: MoPOP permanent collection External.
