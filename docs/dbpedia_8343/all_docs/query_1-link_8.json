        "text": "The article discusses manuscript books – collections of public life materials created in the 17th and 18th centuries in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, now located in Poland. They were created mainly by nobles and by chancellery clerks and officials employed at magnates’ and state dignitaries’ courts as an expression of the interests of collectors or documentary and historiographical concerns, and sometimes also as support for public activity. They contained various materials related to conducting, documenting and recording public life. The present overview is based on an identification of copies and on the information contained in printed and online manuscript catalogues and inventories. The number of surviving manuscripts of that type can be hypothetically estimated at ca. 400–500 copies, with ca. 100 copies identified in Poland. Their largest collection is held in the Radvilos Archives, part of the Central Archives of Historical Records in Warsaw, with single copies scattered acros...\n\nResearch interest in the Łaski family of Korab coat of arms resulted in an array of interesting works and several times more postulates and research queries. Studies from the turn of the 19th and 20th century need to be updated and completed. This concerns both the factual issues and interpretational ones. In his article the author undertakes to accomplish these postulates in relation to the period of education and peregrinations of three representatives of the family from Łask: Hieronim, Jan and Stanisław, sons of Jarosław and Zuzanna of Bąkowa Góra and nephews of chancellor and primate Jan Łaski. Apart from reconstructing some events, the author reinterpreted the preserved source material and juxtaposed the results with the previous state of research. This resulted in identifying some inaccuracies reproduced for decades or statements unconfirmed by any sources which are deep rooted in the historiography.\n\nIn the Jelenia Góra department of the State Archives in Wrocław is stored a small part – consisting of 60 archival units – of the current records (Registratur) of the Prussian State Library in Berlin (Preußische Staatsbibliothek) from the years 1939–45. It is a remnant of the office of the Berlin library: catalogue and acquisition departments which operated in the foothills of the Karkonosze mountains in the last months of the Second World War. The first main group of files contain correspondence regarding the mandatory copy (5–14, 23, 24, 27, partly 25 and 28). Along with the transfer of the acquisition department to Jelenia Góra, correspondence regarding the mandatory copy was sent as well. Files preserved in Jelenia Góra can be divided into three groups: concerning the official prints from 1936–1944, correspondence with the military authorities, bulletins and newspapers published in prisoner-of-war camps. The second main group consists of files illustrating the process of obtaining by the Berlin library of manuscripts and prints during the war apart from the mandatory copy (numbers 15–22). These files can be divided into two categories: correspondence with civil institutions as well as military and police authorities of the German state. The aim of this article is firstly to present the archival fonds “Prussian State Library Department in Jelenia Góra” and to indicate its historical value; secondly, to discuss issues that complement our knowledge on the Berlin library’s war activities in the field of acquisition; thirdly – perhaps most importantly – to show clues for further archival searches.\n\nThe text provides a highly detailed catalogue description of the twelfth-century collectar from the Cistercian Abbey of Ląd (Poland), preserved today in Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Until 2016 the manuscript was regarded in Poland as lost (during World War II). The appendix describes the newly discovered manuscript and presents a sample description template that will be utilized in the catalogue. Moreover, the article describes other objectives of the recently launched project \"Liturgica Poloniae.\" The grant, financed by the Ministry of Education and Science within the National Program for the Development of Humanities (2022–2027), conducted at the Institute of Art, Polish Academy of Sciences, aims to meticulously catalogue approximately 110 liturgical manuscripts copied until ca. 1300, currently held in Polish and foreign repositories. The absence of a comprehensive publication addressing this objective and the inadequacies of existing catalogues necessitate a detailed examination of Polish liturgical codices. Utilizing advanced technologies, the project will provide reliable information about Polish liturgical manuscripts. The resulting English-language catalogue will offer extensive details on bindings, scripts, musical notations, materials used, ornamentation, provenance, dating, and, notably, a specific description of liturgical content tailored to each genre. The catalogue will be published in open access and distributed to major libraries. The catalogue intends to facilitate global research on Poland’s national heritage, correct misdated or misidentified manuscripts, and aid specialists in Polish history in interpreting liturgical sources.
