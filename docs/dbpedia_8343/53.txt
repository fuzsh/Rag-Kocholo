Patrimonium is a joint project between Poland’s two largest libraries, the National Library of Poland in Warsaw and the Jagiellonian Library in Krakow. The aim of this project is to digitize their most valuable collections and put them online on a single platform.

For this project, the two institutions have opted for various scanners such as CopiBook (A2 format), Quartz A1 HD and Quartz A0 HD (A1 and A0 large-format book scanners) and CopiBook V-Shape scanners.

By 2020, when the three-year project was nearing completion, one million items had been digitized, including manuscripts, antiquarian books, newspapers, periodicals, maps, prints, sheet music, printed ephemera, postcards and photographs.

The digitized collections were then published on Poland’s digital library, known as POLONA.

The National Library of Poland is now the largest digitization center in Poland, and one of the most important in Europe.
