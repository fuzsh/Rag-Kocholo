The redevelopment and modernization of the National Library of Poland in Warsaw

At SOKKA we designed the reception desks, new furnishing, and wayfinding system for the modernization of the National Library of Poland in Warsaw. Together with the architects from KONIOR Studio, who were responsible for the architectural part of the modernization, we decided to keep the modernist character of the building but make it more user-friendly, ergonomic, and ecological.

As industrial designers, we gave dated and damaged furnishings a much-needed update, which not only improved the aesthetics of reading rooms but made them more ergonomic and comfortable for the readers. All bespoke furnishings were made to measure, and each reader’s desk gained its own lamp which was designed exclusively for the project.

The building received also a brand new wayfinding system inspired by the original black and gold signage. We decided to use Zaluski font, which was specially designed for the National Library of Poland. Much to say, the modernized library gained new life and became one of Warsaw’s hottest spots for studying.
