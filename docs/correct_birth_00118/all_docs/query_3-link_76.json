Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrena De Niro is Robert De Niro's oldest daughter.\n\nDrena De Niro, born on September 3, 1971, is the oldest of De Niro's children. She is not biologically his daughter but was adopted by the actor at 5 years old after her mother Diahnne Abbott's marriage to him in 1976. She then took on his surname.\n\nShe began her career as a model before dabbling in DJing and fashion consulting. At age 25, she made her acting debut in the 1996 film \"Grace of My Heart.\" She has since starred in \"Joy,\" \"Hands of Stone,\" and \"A Star is Born,\" the last of which also starred her late son Leandro De Niro Rodriguez.\n\nDrena, now 51, made De Niro a grandfather when she and her then-boyfriend, artist Carlos Rodriguez, welcomed their son in 2003. In July 2023, Drena announced that Leandro had died at the age of 19 but did not reveal his cause of death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaphael Eugene De Niro is the actor's oldest biological child.\n\nDe Niro and Abbott welcomed their son, Raphael Eugene De Niro on November 9, 1976. (De Niro's marriage to Abbott later ended in 1988.)\n\nWhile Raphael, now 46, did not pursue a career in Hollywood, as a broker at luxury real estate company Douglas Elliman, he has helped stars like Renée Zellweger and Kelly Ripa find their dream homes in Manhattan.\n\nAccording to his website, in 2004 he founded the De Niro team within the firm and, as of 2011, he has sold $600 million in properties since getting his broker's license, per the New York Times.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2020, he was married to Claudine De Matos and welcomed three children together, per Page Six.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAaron Kendrick De Niro stays out of the spotlight.\n\nAfter his divorce from Abbott, De Niro began dating \"Miami Vice\" actor and model Toukie Smith in 1988.\n\nThe couple welcomed twin sons Aaron Kendrick De Niro and Julian Henry De Niro, who were conceived by in vitro fertilization and delivered by a surrogate mother, on October 20, 1995. The couple separated the following year.\n\nIt's not known what Aaron, now 27, is up to these days as he stays largely out of the spotlight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJulian Henry De Niro is Aaron's twin brother and pursuing an acting career.\n\nJulian Henry De Niro, Aaron's twin brother, was also born on October 20, 1995.\n\nJulian has pursued a career in acting and made his film debut in 2016's \"In Dubious Battle,\" alongside James Franco and Selena Gomez. In 2022, he portrayed a young Barack Obama in Showtime's anthology television series, \"The First Lady.\"\n\nAs of 2023, he has been starring in \"The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window\" on Broadway at The James Earl Jones Theater alongside Rachel Brosnahan and Oscar Isaac.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElliot De Niro is a Special Olympics tennis star.\n\nIn 1997, the \"Meet the Parents\" actor married American socialite Grace Hightower and a year later they welcomed a son together, Elliot De Niro, on March 18, 1998.\n\nDe Niro shared Elliot's autism diagnosis in 2016 while advocating for the inclusion of the controversial documentary \"Vaxxed\" at the Tribeca Film Festival, of which he is a co-founder.\n\n\"Grace and I have a child with autism and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined,\" he said at the time per People, speaking about his son's diagnosis for the first time.\n\nElliot, now 25, is known for his skills as a tennis player, having competed in the Special Olympics, the world's largest sports organization for children and adults with intellectual disabilities. In 2018 he was featured in ESPN's \"Special Olympics: 50 Game Changers\" series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHelen Grace De Niro was previously De Niro's youngest child.\n\nDe Niro and Hightower initially split in 1999, one year after Elliot's birth, and fought for custody of him in court.\n\nHowever, their divorce was never finalized and in 2004, they renewed their wedding vows, according to People. On December 23, 2011, their second child together, a daughter named Helen Grace De Niro, was born via surrogate. Helen is now 11.\n\nDe Niro and Hightower separated for good in November 2018 after two decades of marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGia Virginia Chen-De Niro is the latest addition to the family.\n\nOn April 3, 2023, the actor welcomed daughter Gia Virginia Chen-De Niro with his partner, Tiffany Chen, 45. He shared the news while speaking to Entertainment Tonight Canada to promote his new movie, \"About My Father.\"\n\nWhen ET Canada's Brittnee Blair mentioned De Niro's six children, the two-time Oscar winner corrected her, saying: \"Seven, actually. I just had a baby.\"\n\nHe then shared the details on \"CBS Mornings\" with Gayle King the following week, revealing his daughter's full name and a photo of the newborn in a striped pink sleepsuit.\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement"
