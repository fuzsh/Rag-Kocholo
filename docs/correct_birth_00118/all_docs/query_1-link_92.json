        "text": "Even more than the Liberty Bell, the Rocky steps are Philadelphia’s Statue of Liberty.\n\nFor generations, millions a year have climbed the 72 steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. They have stood in the footprints of Rocky Balboa, impressed into the museum’s stone. And they have raised their hands toward the sky in victory, just as Stallone did.\n\nWe’re not gonna lie: It’s fun.\n\nBut there’s more to Philly movie and TV history than just the Rocky steps — and the Rocky statue by the Rocky steps. Weirder things. Goofier things. Easter eggs that even many of the city’s residents don’t know.\n\nYou can visit all of them, in an underground daytrip that connects the oddball parts of Philadelphia film history.\n\nMafia hangouts for Robert De Niro. Twelve Monkeys headquarters, where Bruce Willis feared the world would end. The mannequin from \"Mannequin.\" The b-ball court from \"Fresh Prince of Bel Air,\" where a couple of guys who were up to no good … started making trouble in the neighborhood.\n\nAnd, of course, Rocky’s house. And multiple versions of Adrian Balboa’s grave.\n\nHere’s your guide to the lesser-known shooting locations and secret monuments of Philadelphia film and TV history.\n\nPlay hoops at the basketball court from 'Fresh Prince of Bel Air'\n\nRoberto Clemente Playground, 1800 Wallace St., North Philly\n\nWill Smith may have been West Philadelphia born and raised.\n\nBut that’s not where you’ll find the basketball court visible on the credits of the Philly native’s star-making turn in the ‘90s sitcom “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air” — the court by the school where the fictional Fresh Prince once spent most of his days chillin’ out, maxin', relaxin', all cool.\n\nThe actual basketball court stands in a tony neighborhood at the inside edge of North Philly.\n\nThe hoops court at Fairmount’s Roberto Clemente playground could use a fresh coat of paint, maybe a new net. But it’s a peaceful place, next to a densely planted community garden. Certainly not where you expect to meet a couple of guys “up to no good.” Or make your mom scared enough to send you to a mansion in California.\n\nSo feel free to shoot some b-ball outside of the (Laura Waring) school, just as Will Smith did.\n\nBut also: If you’d rather go where the real Will Smith might have played ball, go two blocks away from his high school, Overbrook High School in West Philly. The courts at Tustin Playground, at 5901 W. Columbia Ave., were recently renovated and dedicated to the memory of another renowned Philadelphian, Kobe Bryant.\n\nVisit the mannequin from 'Mannequin'\n\nSouth Fellini, 1507 E Passyunk Ave., southfellini.com. Open Thursday to Sunday.\n\nStop us if you’ve heard this one before: An ancient Egyptian blonde finds her spirit trapped in a department store mannequin … a mannequin that comes to life only in the presence of a weirdly eager window-dresser with a spotty résumé and a habit of being naked at the wrong times.\n\nThe 1987 movie “Mannequin” is as famous for its ludicrous plot as its oddly compelling charm. And the mannequin in question, Emmy, has become the most enduring Kim Cattrall role that wasn’t \"Sex and the City.''\n\nAnyway, \"Mannequin'' was shot in Philly. And the owners of a local clothing shop, South Fellini, announced in 2019 that they’d managed to get hold of one of the actual \"Mannequin'' mannequins from a former crew member on the film.\n\nKim Cattrall said on Twitter she doubted it was real. In response, South Fellini co-owner Tony Trov invited her to come down and see for herself.\n\nYou also can decide: Emmy stands tall in the South Passyunk store, wearing a \"Mannequin\"-themed shirt also for sale.\n\nBut also: Go to the Center City Macy’s at 1313 Chestnut St. to hang out in the former Wannamaker’s store where \"Mannequin\" \"was filmed. At noon and 5:30 p.m. each day from Monday to Saturday, the store plays an organ concert on the same organ where Cattrall danced to Alisha’s immortal song, “Do You Dream About Me?”\n\nDrink at the 'It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia' bar. Kind of.\n\nMac’s Tavern, 226 Market St., macstavern.com.\n\nIs it just a coincidence that Mac’s Tavern is located next door to a cheesesteak shop called Sonny’s?\n\n“It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” about a terrible South Philly Irish bar, is probably the most famous show ever set in Philadelphia. But you won’t find Paddy’s Irish Pub in South Philly, nor anywhere else really. The bar’s interior is a soundstage in Los Angeles, while the building used as its exterior is a three-story warehouse in L.A. used exclusively for film and TV shoots.\n\nBut then there’s Mac’s.\n\nMac’s is a dim and sparsely decorated neighborhood bar in Old City. There are cheesesteaks and hot chicken sandwiches, and a notable profusion of taps from local brewery 2SP. You won’t find the words “It’s Always Sunny” anywhere inside it.\n\nBut Mac’s is the closest you’ll get to an “It’s Always Sunny” bar: It’s owned by two of the show’s stars, Rob McElhenney and Kaitlin Olson. Pictures of the gang adorn its walls. And so do banners for Wrexham, the Welsh soccer team McElhenney co-owns with Ryan Reynolds.\n\nOn a July Friday during the SAG-AFTRA strike, you might even find McIlhenney there during a Wrexham match. But the bar did not advertise this visit. After all, Mac’s is just a Welsh soccer bar with cheesesteaks. And Rob is just the owner. Stop by for a pint.\n\nBut also: There is in fact an old Irish bar called Paddy’s Pub in Philadelphia, just two blocks from Mac’s at 228 Race St. Paddy’s does in fact sell “It’s Always Sunny” T-shirts, and proclaims itself the inspiration for the show. Take note, however, that the cigarette-friendly Paddy’s is more smoky than sunny.\n\nSee the birthplace of the apocalypse at 12 Monkeys Headquarters\n\n2802 Kensington Ave., formerly Phil’s Appliances\n\nIn Terry Gilliam’s \"12 Monkeys,\" Bruce Willis travels back in time to prevent the end of the world — an apocalypse begun with a deadly virus purportedly released by an ecoterrorist group called the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.\n\nTheir headquarters was in Kensington: a corner store home until recently to a shop called Phil’s Appliances. The storefront looks much as it did in the movie, an ominous green-painted portal facing out from the blade of a flatiron wedge.\n\nDepending on when you show up, the surrounding neighborhood may look as if the virus already has been released.\n\nThe shooting location for \"12 Monkeys'' headquarters is now the center of the opioid epidemic in Philadelphia. Kensington’s sidewalks fill with the afflicted, whose upper bodies may list forward at 90 degrees in the characteristic stance of those who've ingested a heady cocktail of xylazine — horse tranquilizer — and fentanyl.\n\n“Everybody shut up and listen to me,” yelled a man outside the shop with the air of a prophet. “Everyone listen!”\n\nBut no predictions came.\n\nNearby: Around the corner at 1818 Tusculum St. is the location of the first house where Rocky Balboa lived with Adrian in the first \"Rocky\" movie — the sort of humble place where a boxer might get his start. But if you visit now, be respectful. Someone else lives here now, with their own dreams.\n\nExperience Delancey Place, the most filmed block in Philadelphia\n\n2000-2100 Delancey Place, Philadelphia\n\nIn the ritzy neighborhoods just blocks from Rittenhouse Square sits a street that looks like aspirational Anycity, U.S.A. — a placeless and timeless loveliness that seems to house a life that Supreme Court justices and child psychologists might lead.\n\nThat is the 2000 block of Delancey Place, the most filmed residential block in Philadelphia, a broad and generously tree-lined street of stately brick whose townhouses cost millions and are not often for sale. This life can be had only in the movies.\n\nBruce Willis lived here in \"The Sixth Sense'' (2006 Delancey) a few doors from Dan Aykroyd in ''Trading Places'' (house number 2014).\n\nDelancey Place is the setting of Reese Witherspoon and Paul Rudd’s antics in 2010 rom-com “How Do You Know” — the same year Neil Patrick Harris lived at 2037 Delancey in “The Best and The Brightest,” and the same year Jimmy Smits lived across the street at 2036 as a Supreme Court justice in the TV show “Outlaw.”\n\nA fictional Jeff Daniels lived on this street. So did Samuel L. Jackson’s psychologist in “Split.” Around the corner, at 2108 Spruce St., is the home of Sean and Dorothy Turner in M. Night Shyamalan series “Servant.”\n\nIt is dizzying, the density of this life that isn’t real.\n\nNearby: Or you can stop by Rittenhouse Square, the other most-filmed block in Philly. We won’t recount it all, except to say it’s where Eddie Murphy whizzes around on a skateboard at the beginning of “Trading Places.”\n\nEat and drink at mob hangouts from 'The Irishman'\n\nVilla di Roma, 936 S. Ninth St., villadiroma.com; Friendly Lounge, 1039 S. Eighth St.\n\nMartin Scorsese’s South Philly mob flick “The Irishman” took full advantage of the fact that history runs deep in Philly’s Italian Market.\n\nFriendly Lounge, whose exterior is depicted in the movie, was in fact open in the 1950s as a steakhouse frequented by Sinatra … and probably some mobsters.\n\nThe Lounge is smoke-filled, but quite friendly these days. But it was founded by a loan shark and rumored mob underboss named John \"Skinny Razor\" DiTullio. DiTullio swore his nickname came from the skinny lapels he favored. Others, including published mob informant Ralph Natale, thought different.\n\nMuch more prominent in \"The Irishman\" was Villa di Roma, a popular red-sauce Italian haunt depicted as a place where mob business happened. Villa's been open in the Market since the 1960s, and if the mob liked to stop by back in the day, they probably had good taste in meatballs — not to mention stiff Manhattans. Bring cash. Eat well. Take an Uber.\n\nBut also: One of the more famous scenes in “Rocky” happened at the Italian Market near Washington Avenue, during an unplanned moment: A sidewalk fruit vendor threw Stallone an orange as he jogged past, and he caught it. The scene, of course, ended up in the movie. And you can still buy oranges at the Italian Market. Please don’t throw them at anybody.\n\nWatch a local wrestling at 'The Wrestler' arena\n\n2300 Arena, 2300 S. Swanson St., 2300arena.com.\n\nThe most memorable scene in 2008’s “The Wrestler” involves Mickey Rourke taking a staple to the chest.\n\nThat could only happen in South Philly, and it did — at 2300 Arena. There, you can still watch local wrestling under the bright lights, amid the din of only the real fans. A revamped 2300 Bar, under construction as of our visit in August 2023, is promised to be ready by the time Wrestlemania hits Philly.\n\nBut wrestling events at the arena may hit closer to home. The calendar in 2023 includes a Major League Wrestling Fury Road event featuring former WWE star Gene Snitsky: an old warrior on the wrestling circuit, well past his days on the national TV stage, retired for years but straining for a return.\n\nWill he find glory at the 2300?\n\nBut also: For more gritty realism, punch the bag at Creed’s gym in “Creed.” Kensington’s Front Street Gym at 2076 E. Clearfield St. is the real thing, a die-hard survivor still at work training the boxers of tomorrow. A membership is $25; spectators can show up to an amateur fight night.\n\nClimb the 'Hustle' steps\n\nTop of the hill at Dupont and Silverwood streets, Manayunk, Philadelphia\n\nThe Rocky Steps are easy. But have you climbed the “Hustle” steps?\n\nThe 2022 Adam Sandler vehicle gets a lot right about Philly — though it’s hard to imagine a 76ers employee driving 40 minutes from South Philly to Manayunk each morning to make a basketball player climb hills and stairs.\n\nThat said, if you make the grueling climb up the hill and then the old steps at Dupont and Silverwood, the same way as “Hustle” co-star and Spanish basketball player Juancho Hernangomez, you’ll be treated to one of the more stunning views of the city, looking down on the Gothic Spire of St. David’s.\n\nNinety-six steps. Take that, Rocky stairs.\n\nGet married at the ballroom from 'Silver Linings Playbook'\n\nBallroom at the Ben, Franklin Residences, 834 Chestnut St., finleycatering.com.\n\nThe climactic scene in David O. Russell’s “Silver Linings Playbook,” a very Upper Darby movie based on a novel by Matthew Quick of South Jersey, features Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence dancing in a fancy-pants ballroom to the mild dismay of judges.\n\nPerhaps you feel your love story is similar to theirs? Are you damaged people, who literally and metaphorically found your footing together?\n\nWell, if you’ve got money and lots of friends, you and a minimum of 150 people can celebrate your love at the Ballroom at the Ben, inside luxury apartment building The Franklin Residences in Center City.\n\nBut if you’re just a looky-loo, like the rest of us, building staff inform us that walk-ins often can be accommodated in their desires to peek at the ballroom where Cooper and Lawrence cut a rug. Come Friday or Saturday afternoons only.\n\nVisit the grave of Adrian Balboa\n\nLaurel Hill East Cemetery, 3822 Ridge Ave., laurelhillphl.com.\n\nThe actress who plays Adrian Balboa in \"Rocky,\" Talia Shire, is very much alive.\n\nBut Adrian is \"buried'' at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Northwest Philadelphia, next to her brother, Paulie. Her gravestone was first planted in the 2006 film “Rocky Balboa.” Her brother joined her in the 2013 film “Creed.”\n\nThe granite prop stones, made for each movie, were kept at the cemetery rather than thrown away, and now gather moss … and many visitors.\n\nEach stone has become the site of small memorials to others. On Adrian’s gravestone, someone has begun leaving behind pairs of glasses: some dusty, some new. Paulie’s hand-painted stones bear testament to Herb “Gritty” Hagan, lost to the world in 2020.\n\nOn an online memorial board, the depth of some people’s feelings become more clear.\n\n“You were as much an inspiration to me as Rocky and taught me what a real partner and devoted love should look like,\" wrote one Rocky fan on findagrave.com.\n\n“Now I have my own Adrian and think of you often,” he wrote.\n\nMore Adrian memorials: A perhaps stranger memorial to Adrian can be found only online. For decades, the site of the pet shop where Adrian worked in “Rocky,” at 2146 Front St., was an actual pet shop called J & M Tropical Fish.\n\nThat building was demolished in 2017. But ever since, Philadelphians have refused to let Adrian’s pet store die. Graffiti has repeatedly marked the location as J & M Tropical Fish. And online, movie fans continue to leave reviews.\n\n“BAD JUST BAD,” reads a June 2023 Google review for the long-demolished J & M Tropical Fish. “ADRIAN WAS THE WORKER AND THERE WAS A DOG CALLED BUTKUS BUT SHE SOLD IT TO SOME BUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”\n\n“The assistants name was Adrian,” reads another. “Very shy.”"
