        "text": "The Birds mural by Mateusz Odrobny & Ana Mill Image credit: The Guardian\n\nIf it's Friday we must be back in London.Every Friday I take a virtual walking tour ‘above ground’ on the London Underground. Using my Tube guide & my fitbit® device, my goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day roughly following along the Underground route, reporting back here on Fridays with my findings We're currently following the Central Line. Here are the previous days. This is Day 59\n\nJust when I thought I couldn’t walk another step along the route covered by the Central line, I find out from my pal with the googly eyes that the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock hails from these here parts! Born above his father’s greengrocer’s shop at 517 High Road in Leytonstone, Hitchcock is the area’s most famous son but don’t tell that to David Beckham who grew up in the area too.\n\nWhile Hitchcock’s boyhood home was knocked down years ago, in its stead there’s a gas station—sorry— petrol station and a nice blue plaque.\n\nNearby on the High Road, a pair of artists covered a building with birds to honor Hitchcock. You can see the building at the top of the page. Odronby even managed to paint a portrait of Hitchcock within the eye of the biggest bird.\n\nDavid Beckham slept here.\n\nimage credit: London Loves Business\n\nYou can still stop by Beckham’s old house at 155 Norman Road.\n\nThe area also features blocks of flats named in the great director’s honor; Marnie Court and Topaz Way, plus there’s an actual Hitchcock Lane. Not much to look at. Disappointing? Here in California up in Bodega Bay, where Hitchcock filmed The Birds, the church and school remain but little else is recognizable. A small cafe calls itself The Birds Cafe, inside there are a couple of photos but the staff has no idea about any of it. Was this cafe used in the movie, you ask, wondering if you’ve missed something. What happened to the Tides restaurant? They don’t know. Or care. They look at you like you might be a little crazy for asking where did Tippi Hedrin take the little motorboat out.\n\nIt’s too bad time can’t stand still like it does in the movies; it would make paying homage much easier. At least there’s a plaque! Here in Los Angeles at the home where F. Scott Fitzgerald died, there’s not even that!\n\nMy photo of the Hollywood apartment where F. Scott Fitzgerald died.\n\nIt was the home of his mistress, gossip columnist Sheila Graham.\n\nThere is no plaque.\n\nAnd there are some lovely mosaics (17 in all) just up ahead on the walls outside the Leytonstone Station, depicting scenes from his life and his films. Four Hitchcock classics I’ve nabbed. I bet you don’t need me to identify the movies for you!\n\nImage credit: GuidedWalksinLondon.co.UK\n\nimage credit: CNN\n\nimage credit: theHitchcockZone.com\n\nDone with the Hitchcock home town tour? Not quite. Up ahead on the fringes of Epping forest is the Sir Alfred Hitchcock Hotel. What does it have to do with Hitchcock? Did he stay there, eat there, shoot a film there? None of the above as far as I can see but for some reason they have license to use his name. I wonder how that works in England. Do they need permission from the estate, do they need to pay some sort of licensing fee?\n\nimage credit: AlfredHitchcockHotel.com\n\nThat’s got me curious. If you were going to name a hotel—or a pub, a restaurant, whatever, is there a famous person you’d name it after? I’m debating between the Redford Inn and the Gosling Arms.\n\nInstead of heading off to the Snaresbrook Station, instead I’ll check in to the Sir Alfred Hitchcock hotel for the night and mull over my decision. I have a feeling I’ll be sleeping with the light on.\n\nThe Sir Alfred Hitchcock Hotel\n\n147 Whipps Cross Rd, London E11 1NP\n\n+44 20 8530 3724\n\nCounting the Fitbit steps\n\nDay 1-58: 404,090 steps/177.15 miles\n\nDay 59: Leytonstone . 11000 steps/4.9 miles\n\nTotal Imaginary Miles to Date 415,090 steps/182 miles\n\nBaker Street Station—Sherlock Holmes was there\n\nBaker Street Station The main thing my husband wanted to see in London was London ... as Sherlock Holmes saw it. So our first move, like any fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's creation was to take a double decker bus to Baker Street. As it turns out I read the map upside down or sideways or maybe it was backwards but we found ourselves in Putney at the bridge. Very much in the wrong direction. Over half an hour by car, which we didn't have. We wound up taking the tube back in the right direction which delivered us to the Baker Street Station. The station is one of the original stations opened when the Metropolitan Railway—the world's first underground railway—was built in 1863. While we don't immediately think of Sherlock dashing out on the tube, he very well could have and in fact the rail, train etc is alluded to in several dozen Sherlock stories. The Baker Street station is situated on the very block where Sherlock lived at 221B Baker Street. Or should I say th\n\nBrad Pitt: I knew him well. (Okay, that’s a lie. But I did know him!)\n\nI only worked on a couple of movies during my short-lived career as a production coordinator. By a couple, I mean two. Literally two. The Favor was one of those movies, a film most of you will have never heard of even though it starred Elizabeth McGovern, Bill Pullman and Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt was just a beautiful young man back then, only twenty four, with the beginnings of a resume; some small parts in episodic tv, nothing noteworthy. The director cast him based on some footage his agent had sent from LA up to our location production office in downtown Portland. It was from the as yet unreleased Thelma & Louise ; my boss had seen the video clip and trilled that he was delicious. And we all knew that instead of flying up from LA, he’d driven up in the cutest little sports car with Juliette Lewis by his side. Brad played Elliot, an artist and Elizabeth McGovern's love interest, Emily, who runs an art gallery. The film is called The Favor because Emily's friend\n\nAbove Ground on the London Underground—Day 46: White City\n\nIf it's Friday we must be back in London. Every Friday I take a virtual walking tour ‘above ground’ on the London Underground. Using my Tube guide & my fitbit® device, my goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day roughly following along the Underground route, reporting back here on Fridays with my findings. Here are the previous days . This is Day 46. Today we’re walking from the Ealing Broadway underground station to White City. The trek is 4.2 miles which should clock in at just about 10,000 steps. Back in 1908, the area was transformed from Shepherd’s Bush farm land into the location for the Franco-British exhibition and the 1908 Summer Olympics. Called the white city because of the white cladding of the ornate exhibition buildings, the area was used for the Japan-British exhibition in 1910, the Latin-British exhibition in 1912, and finally the Anglo-American exhibition in 1914 when WWI put an end to it. After that the White City was left to fall into disrepair and ult"
