        "text": "Update (May 10, 2023 at 10:00 a.m.): Robert De Niro knows what he’s doing when it comes to fatherhood.\n\nPage Six asked the actor whether he was “surprised” to become a father again at 79, while he was at the premiere of his film About My Father on Tuesday night. “No,” he said. He was not surprised. “How you could not plan that kind of thing?”\n\nThe original article continues below.\n\nIt’s nice to have seven of something. Deadly sins. Days in a week. Dwarves who each have a single personality trait. When it comes to quantities of things, you can’t really do better than seven.\n\nSo how lucky is Robert De Niro that he recently welcomed his seventh child into the world? The news was revealed a bit off the cuff. In an interview with ET Canada, the topic of fatherhood rightfully arose. De Niro’s new movie is called About My Father, so reporter Brittnee Blair went to lob a softie, prefacing a question with, “I know you have six kids,” to which De Niro said, “Seven, actually. I just had a baby.”\n\nThis is news! He had been Bobby “Six Kids” De Niro to the wider public until this week. ET Canada followed up with his reps, who confirmed the recent birth but did not reveal who the mother is. Page Six and other outlets report that his girlfriend, Tiffany Chen, was recently showing.\n\nDe Niro, who is 79, had the other six kids with three women over the course of 35 years. His eldest is Drena, 51, whom De Niro adopted when he married her mother, Diahnne Abbott, in 1976. De Niro had Raphael, 46, with Abbott as well. He had twins Aaron and Julian, 27, with model-actor Toukie Smith, and then had two children with his second ex-wife, Grace Hightower: Elliot, 25, and Helen, 11.\n\nCongrats to De Niro on helping to bring a new life into the world, and congrats to all of De Niro’s kids for finally having enough siblings to start a water polo team.\n\nTelevision\n\nEverything We Know About The Bear Season 3\n\nAll episodes of the Emmy-winning series hit Hulu on Wednesday, June 26, at 9 p.m. E.T.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe 32 Best True-Crime Documentaries to Binge Right Now\n\nFrom murders to cults to miscarriages of justice, the best true-crime documentaries have it all. Your next watch is waiting.\n\nMovies\n\nAmy Adams Hears the Call of the Wild in Nightbitch\n\n“When people ask me what the movie is about, I’m like, ‘It’s about motherhood and rage,’” says director Marielle Heller in this exclusive first look. “And you either get that or you don’t.”\n\nHollywood\n\nSharon Stone Is Pro–Kevin Spacey, Anti–Men Asking Before They Kiss Her\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the actor doubled down on her support of Spacey in the midst of an ongoing sexual misconduct trial and shared her thoughts on gender: “I think we should want men to flirt with us,” she said."
