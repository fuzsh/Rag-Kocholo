        "text": "Between his last name and his mafia filmography, it's no surprise that Robert De Niro is considered one of the most famous Italian-Americans of all time.\n\nLesser known is the actor's connection to Ireland, which goes far beyond his role in the 2019 crime drama 'The Irishman'. It turns out that the Irish have just as much of a claim to the Hollywood legend - aside from his dual US-Italian citizenship, that is.\n\nDe Niro's little-known Irish heritage received greater attention with Netflix's release of 'The Irishman'. Yet another mobster collaboration between the actor and fellow Italian-American icon, director Martin Scorsese, De Niro played the titular role of the Irish-American gangster Frank Sheeran.\n\nTo get the best of Irish history, culture, and folklore sent straight to your inbox, sign up for our FREE newsletter.\n\nLike Sheeran, who was born and raised in Pennsylvania, De Niro's Irish ancestry is paternal. His mother's side seemingly has neither Italian nor Irish heritage, so both of these come from his father, abstract expressionist painter Robert De Niro Sr.\n\nRobert Sr was solidly half and half - his father was born to Italian immigrants while his mother was Irish on all sides. Recent research by amateur genealogist Jim McNiff ironically ties his maternal ancestry to both Co Tipperary in Ireland and Tipperary Hill in Syracuse, New York.\n\nDe Niro (Jr, the Oscar winner) has tried to stay connected to his father's roots in both countries. He became an Italian citizen in 2006 and has previously spoken about visiting Ireland in the past.\n\nThe actor said he went hitchhiking around the island in his youth and wound up on a ferry to the Aran Islands. Yet as for tracking down living relatives, he claimed it was easier in Italy than in Ireland.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nInside Maureen O'Hara's love-hate relationship with The Quiet Man director who reportedly punched her\n\nTom Brady's Irish roots: the NFL player's fascinating family backstory\n\nA-list celebrities you didn't know have Irish roots\n\nWhat American Dreams are made of: the Irishman behind the Oscar statuette"
