Hinchey Catskill Interpretive Center in Mount Tremper to attend an event that was closed to the public.\n\nIn the midst of all the hoopla this week, the governor debuted a new $5 million ad campaign promoting the Catskills that will run in New York City and up and down the East Coast this summer.\n\nThe subway ads feature Bethel Woods Center for the Arts in Bethel; Lake Wawaka in Middletown; Zoom Flume in East Durham; OPUS 40 in Saugerties; the Roscoe Company in Roscoe; and Hanford Mills Museum in East Meredith.\n\nAbove: A subway poster for the Roscoe Beer Co. in the Sullivan County town of Roscoe, one of six ads that will promote the Catskills region in the NYC public transit system this summer. To see all six posters, click here.\n\nThe television ad promotes Hunter Mountain’s Zipline Tour; the Birthplace of American Fly Fishing in Roscoe; the World’s Largest Kaleidoscope in Mount Tremper; Bethel Woods Center for the Arts; and Rocking Horse Ranch in Highland. To see all the ads, see the top of this story or click here. Click here to see the TV commercial promoting the Catskills.\n\nAbove: A television ad promoting the Catskills that will air this summer on east coast TV stations. Via Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office.\n\nCuomo used the Catskills Challenge yesterday to announce that the state will nominate Bethel Woods and the historic Woodstock Festival grounds to the State and National Registers of Historic Places.\n\nHe also used the occasion to take credit for a slew of various grants that are coming to the Catskills this year, which include $223,000 in Smart Growth Implementation Grants, 500,000 in Local Assistance grants and improvements to various campgrounds. For a breakdown of the grant money, see the bottom of this article.\n\nThe governor’s gambit worked: Newspapers nationwide carried stories about the Catskills yesterday after the Associated Press wrote about De Niro’s appearance at Bethel Woods. From ABC News:\n\nRobert De Niro is conjuring the legacy — and the stand-up jokes — of comedians like Rodney Dangerfield, Henny Youngman and Milton Berle while praising the natural beauty of New York's Catskills region.\n\nCuomo’s media team put together a highlight reel of Catskills Challenge events, which you can see below:\n\nGrant money coming to the Catskills, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office\n\n$223,000 in Smart Growth Implementation Grants:\n\nTown of Prattsville – $53,683 for a pavilion at Conine Field Recreation Area;\n\nMountain Top Arboretum – $24,875 for a project to improve safe entry to the facility;\n\nVillage of Tannersville – $20,500 for a main street visitor information kiosk project;\n\nTown of Andes – $64,500 for the historic andes hamlet secondary water source project;\n\nTown of Shandaken – $28,450 for improvements to town parks, solar lighting and landscaping; and\n\nCatskill Center for Conservation and Development – $30,992 for the Catskill Interpretive Center Interior Design.\n\nThere will also be $500,000 in Local Assistance grants coming to the Catskills:\n\nA Comprehensive Park Recreation Plan to compile and update previously developed plans in the Catskills to produce an integrated plan for economic development and infrastructure improvements to enhance tourism and recreation in the Catskill region;\n\nImproved mountain bike trails, hiking trails, parking and access to Forest Preserve lands;\n\nExpansion of the Summit Stewards Program, to place stewards on mountain tops in the Catskills to teach visitors how protect the fragile mountain top environment;\n\nNew signage to identify trails and paths, in addition to new education kiosks;\n\nMajor Parking Improvements at Overlook, Prediger, Roaring Kill, Platte Clove, Kaaterskill Falls, and Giant Ledge\n\nOn Friday, July 1, Cuomo’s office issued news of more money coming to state parks in the Catskills region:"
