        "text": "Dave Portnoy is the man who created the sports and pop culture blog Barstool Sports. Portnoy, also known as El Presidente, hosts the \"One Bite\" pizza review, the most famous pizza review on the planet. Most importantly Dave Portnoy is papa to Famous Miss Peaches, a young Pitbull Dave rescued earlier this year.\n\nDuring the pandemic Dave Portnoy started the Barstool Fund which has raised more than $41 million dollars for struggling businesses across America. One of those businesses is right here in Saratoga Springs, New York. Portnoy kicked off this past weekend at the business he helped save, the Parting Glass Pub.\n\nThe 2024 season is underway at Saratoga Race Course and throughout the summer weeks the Spa City will see an influx of racing enthusiasts, tourists and celebrities. Dave Portnoy was in town and his first stop was the Parting Glass Pub on Lake Avenue.\n\nIn the spring of 2023 ESPN Radio 104.5 The Team reported that Dave Portnoy had purchased a home in Saratoga. Portnoy's Saratoga spot sits trackside, on the Oklahoma Training Track, on 5th Avenue. This is the same street where celebrity chef Bobby Flay once purchased a home.\n\nWith massive renovations to the 5th Avenue home, track season underway and more pizza places to review it's a sure bet Dave Portnoy will be back to the capital Region. The big question remains is when will Miss Peaches arrive? Here is a picture of the 5th Ave home before Portnoy bought it."
