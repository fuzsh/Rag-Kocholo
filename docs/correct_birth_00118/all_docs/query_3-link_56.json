        "text": "Robert De Niro is reflecting on how he's changed as a parent, from having older children to his baby daughter, Gia, who recently celebrated her first birthday.\n\nWhile promoting the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City on TODAY June 4, the 80-year-old Hollywood legend was asked by Craig Melvin what he's like as a dad.\n\n\"I’m OK,\" he said bluntly, then breaking out into laughter with the TODAY co-hosts.\n\nAl Roker chimed him, asking De Niro how he is as a dad now compared to when he was raising his older kids.\n\n\"Ask the older ones,\" the famed actor answered. \"Nothing is perfect in life as we all know, and my older kids, when they're older, they’re more critical. When they’re young like the baby, that’s pure joy, so I’m enjoying that.\"\n\nThis comes just days after the Oscar winner, who welcomed daughter Gia with girlfriend Tiffany Chen in April 2023, revealed what his little girl did for her first birthday.\n\n\"She had a little cake, it was very nice, sweet,\" he told \"Entertainment Tonight\" in a May 31 interview, noting that it was her first time having cake.\n\nThe Hollywood legend, who first became a father in 1976, noted that Chen is a far more hands-on parent than he is. “I’m there, I support my girlfriend,” the actor explained. “But she does the work. And we have help, which is so important.”\n\nDe Niro added that he enjoys “all” aspects of fatherhood.\n\n“With a baby it’s different to with my 11-year-old. My adult children. My grandchildren. It’s all different,” he shared.\n\nDe Niro has been married twice.\n\nHe shares daughter Drena and son Raphael with his first wife, Diahnne Abbott, to whom he was married from 1976 to 1988. In 1997, De Niro tied the knot with his second wife, Grace Hightower. They welcomed two children, Elliot and Helen, and divorced in 2018.\n\nDe Niro shares his other kids — Julian, Aaron and Gia — with two women he dated.\n\nThe father of seven told TODAY's Hoda Kotb in June 2023 that he's learned a lot from his kids.\n\n“Well, I have certain awareness,” he said. “When you’re older, you have awareness of certain things in life, dynamics, everything, family dynamics. It’s just, you can’t avoid learning some things, and then how you can deal with those, manage them.\"\n\nRead on to learn more about De Niro's kids.\n\nDrena De Niro\n\nIn 1976, De Niro adopted his first wife’s daughter, Drena De Niro, according to IMDb.\n\nDrena De Niro spoke about her famous family, and her upbringing in the public eye, in an interview with Avenue in 2011.\n\n“I came from a really creative bunch of people. My grandparents were painters, my mother (Diahnne Abbott) is a great actress. So, to me, I didn’t really see things the way the public saw stuff. It was just a group of wonderfully crazy, talented people who love each other, and who are doing the best they can,\" she said.\n\nDrena De Niro has made a name for herself in Hollywood as an actor and model. She played Paulette Stone in \"A Star Is Born,\" Anita in \"When They See Us,\" and Cindy in \"Joy.\"\n\nHer son, Leandro De Niro Rodriguez, died in 2023.\n\nRaphael De Niro\n\nIn 1976, De Niro and Abbott welcomed their son, Raphael Eugene De Niro. Raphael De Niro works as a broker at the New York City real estate firm Douglas Elliman, per the firm's website, where he founded the De Niro team.\n\nRaphael De Niro married his first wife, Claudine De Niro, in 2008, according to People. He remarried in 2020, wedding Hannah Carnes De Niro, the New York Post reported.\n\nJulian Henry and Aaron Kendrick De Niro\n\nFollowing his divorce from Abbott, De Niro was linked to former model, actor and restauranteur Toukie Smith (he gets a mention in her New Yorker profile). Their twin sons, Julian and Aaron De Niro, were born in 1995.\n\nAn actor, Julian De Niro played a young Barack Obama in \"The First Lady.\"\n\nElliot De Niro\n\nIn 1998, De Niro welcomed his son Elliot De Niro with his second wife, Grace Hightower.\n\nAt the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival, De Niro revealed his son has autism, according to People.\n\n“Grace and I have a child with autism and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined,” De Niro said.\n\nDe Niro told ESPN in 2019 that he decided to put Elliot in tennis lessons. Although De Niro said his son \"wasn’t crazy about it, at times,” he said that Elliot really came into the sport and started to love it over time.\n\n“His mother was good at pushing (him), and wanting him to be physical and work out,” De Niro shared.\n\n“He has realized, ‘Oh, I can accomplish this. I can do this,'\" Hightower added. \"It has helped him socially.\"\n\nHelen Grace De Niro\n\nIn 2011, De Niro and Hightower welcomed their daughter, Helen.\n\nThe couple split in 2018. “Grace and I have two beautiful children together. We are entering a period of transition in our relationship which is a difficult but constructive process,” De Niro said in a statement at the time, according to People. “I honor Grace as a wonderful mother and ask for privacy and respect from all as we proceed to develop our roles as partners in parenting.”\n\nGia Virginia Chen-De Niro\n\nGia is De Niro’s youngest child, welcomed in April 2023 with girlfriend Tiffany Chen. But like most of his other kids, Gia has been kept out of the public eye.\n\nIn fact, De Niro’s fans didn’t even know that he had a seventh child until the actor told ET Canada that he was in fact, a dad of seven.\n\n“Seven, actually. I just had a baby,” he said.\n\nDuring a June 2023 appearance on TODAY, De Niro talked about his life at home with Gia and said he's been \"very happy\" with how things have been going so far, adding that Gia has been sleeping \"great.\"\n\nHe also told Rolling Stone in December 2023 that he plans on teaching his daughter both Chinese and English.\n\n“(She's) half-Chinese,\" the \"Cape Fear\" star said. \"I want to try to teach her Chinese and show her nursery rhymes in English and Chinese. I’m trying to have her learn both.”\n\nIn January 2024, De Niro also talked about parenting his little girl when he did an interview withAARP The Magazine.\n\n“It’s great,” De Niro said about being a father again at 80.\n\n“Everything that I’m consumed with or worried about just goes away when I look at her. It’s wondrous,” he continued.\n\n“When she gets older — who knows? But that very sweet way she has of looking at you, taking you in, thinking and watching and observing ...” added the actor, growing teary-eyed.\n\nDe Niro later opened up about life with his daughter in a February 2024 interview with People, where he called Gia an \"adorable\" and \"sweet\" baby.\n\n“[When I] look at her, everything else goes away. So it’s a great joy and relief to just be with her in the moment,\" he said.\n\nAs for how his other kids feel about Gia, the dad of seven said they really warmed up to the new edition of the family.\n\n“The kids all get a big kick out of her,” he said. “The grandkids even. She’s their aunt— (and) they’re about to be teenagers!”"
