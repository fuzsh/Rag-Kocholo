        "text": "Robert De Niro has revealed the name of his newborn daughter, as he shared his first photo of her.\n\nDuring Thursday’s episode of CBS Mornings, Gayle King revealed some new details that DeNiro has shared with her about his newborn. The TV host’s remarks came two days after the 79-year-old actor announced that he welcomed his seventh child.\n\nKing went on to present the photo of the newborn baby, who had black hair and was wearing a light pink onesie. She then revealed that the child was born on 6 April and that her full name is Gia Virginia Chen-De Niro.\n\nShe said that De Niro and his partner, Tiffany Chen, are “over the moon” about the newest addition to their family.\n\nAccording to King, she had asked De Niro if his new baby was “planned”. In response, he told her “yes” and said that both he and his partner “wanted her”. She emphasised how “psyched” and “excited” De Niro was about having another child.\n\nDuring an interview with ET Canada on 8 May, De Niro first revealed that he was a father again, as he opened up about parenthood while promoting his latest comedy film, About My Father.\n\nWhen interviewer Brittnee Blair said, “I know you have six kids,” the actor corrected her and responded: “Seven, actually. I just had a baby.”\n\nWhile at the premiere of About My Father on 9 May, he first noted to Page Six that the pregnancy was planned. “How you could not plan that kind of thing?” he said.\n\nAfter De Niro announced the news, his co-star for his new movie, Kim Cattrall, appeared to reveal the identity of his child’s mother.\n\nSpeaking to Extra at the premiere of About My Father, Cattrall said: “God bless him, his significant other. Tiffany is such a beautiful woman. She came to the set once with her family and watched filming, and she was gorgeous and sweet. I’m happy for both of them.”\n\nAlong with his newborn daughter, the Meet the Fockers star has six other children from previous relationships.\n\nDe Niro and his first wife, Diahnne Abbott, are parents to one daughter, Drena, 51, and one son, Raphael, 46. He welcomed his twins, Julian and Aaron, 27, with ex-girlfriend Toukie Smith in 1995. He also shares his 25-year-old son, Elliot, and 11-year-old daughter, Helen Grace, with ex-wife Grace Hightower."
