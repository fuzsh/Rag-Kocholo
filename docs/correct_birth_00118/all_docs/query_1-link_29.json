An original member of the Nantucket Wine Festival team, Mark has worked for the festival in various capacities since it was founded in 1997, most recently as Ambassador and Community Liaison. Other community service includes the Dreamland Theatre Advisory Board, 2-time Chair of The Nantucket Historical Association Festival of Trees, and 2023 Honorary Co-Chair of the Theatre Workshop of Nantucket Gala. Presently, Mark works with his wife Beth English in their wine shop, Current Vintage, celebrating its 16th season on Easy Street.\n\nBETH ENGLISH\n\nBeth is the founder of Current Vintage, a wine, clothing & home store entering its 16th year in downtown Nantucket.
