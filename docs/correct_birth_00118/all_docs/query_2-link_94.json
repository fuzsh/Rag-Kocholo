        "text": "The mob boss of the movies, Robert De Niro, is getting his very own convention in honor of his 80th birthday later this year.\n\nThe “Goodfellas” icon will be commemorated at the Tribeca Film Festival — an event that he founded in 2002 — with a three-day celebration.\n\nWhile the 79-year-old’s birthday is actually on Aug. 17, the festivities will go down from Sept. 29 until Oct. 1 at New York City’s Spring Studios.\n\nThe party has been nicknamed “De Niro Con” and will feature movie screenings, panels, musical concerts, film set re-creations and more — all pertaining to De Niro’s lifelong Hollywood career.\n\nThe full lineup has yet to be announced.\n\nThe “Godfather Part II” star and several of his past cast mates will take part in the convention.\n\nA private party at De Niro’s famed eatery Tribeca Grill was held on Wednesday night to recognize this year’s film festival.\n\nManhattan Mayor Eric Adams even attended the lavish bash and granted the Big Apple native a key to the city, in recognition of his support for the arts.\n\n“From ‘Mean Streets’ and ‘Taxi Driver’ to ‘Raging Bull’ and ‘Goodfellas’, Robert De Niro’s work remains an iconic part of New York City, as much as he is himself,” the politician, 62, said at the gathering, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nHe then went on to rattle off De Niro’s many achievements, such as winning two Academy Awards and starring in, directing and producing over 140 projects.\n\n“Despite his success, Robert has never forgotten his roots as a lifelong New Yorker, co-founding the Tribeca Festival and helping revitalize and re-energize our city after 9/11,” Adams gushed. “Thanks to him, New York City will continue to be the place to film, produce and make television and movies for years to come.”\n\nIn addition to De Niro’s girlfriend Tiffany Chen, 45, a medley of celebrity pals and collaborators attended the illustrious soirée, including Martin Scorsese, Matt Damon, Zazie Beetz, Mark Ruffalo, Brendan Fraser, Dianna Agron and Debra Messing.\n\nThe “Casino” director, 80, also spoke at the swanky get-together, saying a few kind words about his longtime friend.\n\nScorsese told the crowd: “Bob’s a visionary — he saw the potential for massive resurrection of this part of the city.”\n\n“Tribeca Festival is an indomitable institution and a beacon, and Tribeca itself is the most vibrant, alive location,” he said. “It’s the place to be and will continue to grow. It’s amazing he did all of this without having the keys until now so there’s more to come!”"
