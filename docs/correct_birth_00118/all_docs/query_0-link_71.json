        "text": "Former President Donald Trump has a running mate in the 2024 election: Ohio U.S. Sen. JD Vance.\n\nThe 39-year-old has earned recent fame after a successful bid for congress as well as his public loyalty for Trump. But Vance first landed on people’s radars with his memoir, the bestseller “Hillbilly Elegy,” which was published in 2016 as Trump was first running for president.\n\nYou can find the book in your local libraries and bookstores (or online), but you may recall there was a 2020 film adaptation with some big Hollywood names attached. And if you want to get inside the mind of the possible future vice president, you can stream it right now.\n\nWhat is ‘Hillbilly Elegy’?\n\nBased on JD Vance’s bestseller, it follows a former Marine from southern Ohio and current Yale Law student (based on Vance) on the verge of landing his dream job. A family crisis forces him to return to the home he’s tried to forget, as he navigates the complex dynamics of his Appalachian family, including his volatile relationship with his mother Bev (Amy Adams), who’s struggling with addiction. He’s also fueled by memories of his grandmother Mamaw (Glenn Close), who raised him, as he learns to embrace his family’s indelible imprint on his own personal journey.\n\nDirected by Oscar-winner Ron Howard (“A Beautiful Mind,” “Apollo 13″) the film chronicles the highs and lows of a family’s three colorful generations through their unique struggle.\n\nWho’s in the movie?\n\nActor Gabriel Basso plays JD Vance. Basso previously appeared in the films “Alabama Moon,” “Super 8,” and “The Kings of Summer.”\n\nBut the movie mostly focuses on the strong female leads. It stars Oscar nominees Amy Adams (as Beverly “Bev” Vance, JD’s mother) and Glenn Close (as Bonnie “Mamaw” Vance, JD’s grandmother).\n\nAdams has six Academy award nominations for performances in “Junebug,” “Doubt,” “The Fighter,” “The Master,” “American Hustle” and “Vice.” Close has eight nominations for her work in “The World According to Garp,” “The Big Chill,” “The Natural,” “Fatal Attraction,” “Dangerous Liaisons,” “Albert Nobbs,” “The Wife” and “Hillbilly Elegy.”\n\nSunny Mabrey (born in Gadsden, Alabama) stars as young Bonnie “Mamaw” Vance.\n\nHow can I stream ‘Hillbilly Elegy’?\n\nThe movie is currently streaming on Netflix.\n\nDid critics like it?\n\nNo, not really. The movie has a 25% percent positive critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The consensus says, “With the form of an awards-season hopeful but the soul of a bland melodrama, ‘Hillbilly Elegy’ strands some very fine actors in the not-so-deep South.” The Audience Score is higher, though, with more than 2,500 ratings giving it an average of 82%. But critics mostly took “Hillbilly Elegy” to the woodshed, trashing the modern exploration of the American Dream about three generations of an Appalachian family that still eked out the Oscar nom for Close.\n\nVanity Fair referred to it as “a Hollywood grotesque.” Vox opened with the headline, “Everything about Netflix’s ‘Hillbilly Elegy’ is awful.” “‘Hillbilly Elegy’ Is Laughably Horrendous in Every Way,” said Collider.\n\nSo why the adverse reaction? AL.com’s Lawrence Specker wrote, “The book became a sensation and that sensation in turn generated a deep, slow-burning backlash worthy of a Hatfield-McCoy feud. Yes, the metaphor is an obvious and cheap stereotypical shot — but there was no way Howard’s project wasn’t going to be greeted with fusillades of rhetorical buckshot from one side or the other.”\n\nIt made Hollywood history, sort of...\n\nClose joined a very short list of actors to earn both an Oscar nomination and a Razzie nomination for the same performance. In fact, Close marks only the third person to accomplish the feat, following Amy Irving in 1983′s “Yentl” and James Coco in 1981′s “Only When I Laugh.”\n\nOscar-winners are no stranger to the Razzies, formally known as the Golden Raspberry Awards. Sandra Bullock, Nicolas Cage, Halle Berry, Robert De Niro, Faye Dunaway, Julia Roberts, Al Pacino and others have earned the distinction as Razzie nominees and/or winners, some even accepting their “award” in person. John Travolta even won Worst Actor for his work in two movies he filmed in Alabama.\n\nClose did not win either prize. Youn Yuh-jung (”Minari”) won the Oscar that year, while Maddie Ziegler (“Music”) brought home the coveted Razzie."
