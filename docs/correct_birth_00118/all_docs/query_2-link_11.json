        "text": "Robert De Niro is an American actor.\n\nBiography[]\n\nRobert De Niro was born in Greenwich Village, New York City, New York. His father was of Italian and Irish descent, and his mother was of English, German, French, and Dutch ancestry.\n\nHis first major film roles were in Bang the Drum Slowly and Mean Streets, both in 1973. In 1974, he played the young Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II, a role that won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nHis critically acclaimed, longtime collaborations with Martin Scorsese began with 1973's Mean Streets, and earned De Niro an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Jake LaMotta in the 1980 film Raging Bull. He was also nominated for an Academy Award for his roles in Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976) and Cape Fear (1991). In addition, he received nominations for his acting in Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter (1978) and Penny Marshall's Awakenings (1990). Also in 1990, his portrayal as Jimmy Conway in Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas earned him a BAFTA nomination.\n\nHe has earned four nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor â€“ Motion Picture Musical or Comedy: New York, New York (1977), Midnight Run (1988), Analyze This (1999) and Meet the Parents (2000). De Niro directed A Bronx Tale (1993) and The Good Shepherd (2006). He has received accolades for his esteemed career, including the AFI Life Achievement Award and the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nRobert De Niro auditioned for the role of Sonny Corleone in The Godfather. He was given the role of Paulie Gatto, but was traded to the film The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight for Al Pacino.[1][2]\n\nHe was the first actor to win an Academy Award speaking mainly a foreign language; in Part II Vito spoke almost entirely in Sicilian dialect.\n\nHe portrayed gangster Al Capone in the film The Untouchables (1987).\n\nDe Niro starred as Frank Sheeran in the 2019 Martin Scorsese bio crime film, The Irishman, that also co-star Al Pacino as the leader of the Teamster Union, Jimmy Hoffa.\n\nNotes and references[]\n\n[]"
