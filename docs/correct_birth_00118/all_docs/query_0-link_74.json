It‚Äôs unclear how old he was nor is it known how he died.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm deeply distressed by the passing of my beloved grandson Leo,‚Äù De Niro said in a statement to NBC News. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre greatly appreciative of the condolences from everyone. We ask that we please be given privacy to grieve our loss of Leo.‚Äù\n\nLeo was the son of Drena De Niro, 51, the actor‚Äôs oldest child. Drena is the daughter of Robert De Niro‚Äôs first wife, Diahnne Abbott. The ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù star adopted Drena in 1976, according to People. Drena has appeared in ‚ÄúJoy,‚Äù ‚ÄúA Star Is Born‚Äù and the miniseries ‚ÄúWhen They See Us.‚Äù Leo also had a part in ‚ÄúA Star Is Born.‚Äù\n\nDrena said in a statement to NBC News about the loss of her son: ‚ÄúIt is with immeasurable shock and and sadness that we say goodbye to our beloved son Leo. We thank you for the outpouring of love and support and ask that we are given privacy at this time to process this inconsolable grief.‚Äù\n\nShe also mourned Leo in an Instagram post July 2.\n\n‚ÄúMy beautiful sweet angel . I have loved you beyond words or description from the moment I felt you in my belly,‚Äù she captioned a photo of him.\n\n‚ÄúYou have been my joy my heart and all that was ever pure and real in my life . I wish I was with you right now. I wish I was with you . I don‚Äôt know how to live without you but I‚Äôll try to go on and spread the love and light that you so made me feel in getting to be your mama.\n\n‚ÄúYou were so deeply loved and appreciated and I wish that love alone could have saved you üòûI‚Äôm so sorry my baby , I‚Äôm so sorry @carlosmare üò¢üíî. Rest in Peace and Eternal Paradise my darling boy.‚Äù\n\nRobert De Niro, 79, recently expanded his own family. In May, he revealed he had welcomed his seventh child, a girl named Gia.\n\n‚ÄúI just had a baby,‚Äù he told \"Entertainment Tonight Canada\" without divulging any further details.\n\nDe Niro said fatherhood comes with plenty of challenges."
