        "text": "If you’re a movie buff, or just so happen to really enjoy Robert De Niro’s overall vibe, the Tribeca Festival in June is capping off with a tribute to the legendary actor and producer.\n\nFrom June 14-16, the Festival is hosting De Niro Con, which will include set recreations, costume exhibits, behind-the-scenes chats, screenings, and anything that could be tangentially related to De Niro—you'll find it all there.\n\nRECOMMENDED: The 101 best New York movies of all time\n\nThe three-day festival will also include the De Niro Is an Icon: An Exhibit & Immersive Film, a career-spanning gallery that features more than 300 curated items from De Niro's personal collection, including annotated scripts, rare photos, props, and other film-related memorabilia from the 80-year-old’s illustrious career.\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to experience a sort of highlight reel of De Niro’s films, a six-screen, 20-minute immersive movie will weave some of De Niro’s characters into one big narrative masterpiece.\n\nAll the fun and chaos is set to happen on the convention floor, which will have areas for photo ops, set recreations, costume displays and even a De Niro impersonator contest, so make sure you choose your favorite De Niro character and flex your costume making skills if you decide to partake. If you happen to look exactly like Robert De Niro, that's even better.\n\nDe Niro, who is a New York City native, has been in so many iconic films that have shaped the trajectory of American culture—Goodfellas, Casino, Taxi Driver, and A Bronx Tale are just a few—that he is one of very few people who actually does deserve his own three-day convention. He's also one of the founders of the Tribeca Festival, which was created in 2002 to help revitalize Downtown Manhattan following the 9/11 attacks. Now, the prestigious film festival draws approximately 150,000 attendees each year.\n\nThere will be plenty of programming and screenings throughout the convention's duration. The convention will kick off on the evening of June 13th, with a screening of the original The Bronx Tale, a play written by Bronx native Chazz Palminteri and later adapted by De Niro for the big screen. The following day will include screenings of Analyze This, The Godfather Part II, Silver Linings Playbook, and others. On Sunday, June 16, De Niro will host a conversation with his son, JR, that will center themes of family, art and film. There will also be plenty of meet and greets, trivia and panels, including one that discusses the costumes used in De Niro's films led by costume designer Aude Bronson-Howard and dresser Monica Ruiz Ziegler.\n\nPerhaps the most iconic event, though, will be a The De Niro Hero Sandwich competition, in which local sandwich shops will compete to see who can make the best De Niro, which has become a New York deli staple. That's happening on June 16th at Spring Studios' Roof Terrace. To check out the full programming schedule, check out the convention's website."
