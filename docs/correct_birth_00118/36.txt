Robert De Niro was seen spending some quality time with his son Julian in New York City, just over a week after he confirmed the birth of his seventh child.

While stepping out for lunch with his 27-year-old, whom he shares with 70-year-old ex-girlfriend Toukie Smith, the actor, 79, wore a light grey polo shirt, black zip-up jacket and a pair of matching slacks.

The two-time Academy Award winner completed his laid-back ensemble with a grey face mask, blue baseball cap and black tennis shoes.

Julian, who walked down the sidewalk alongside his father's side, sported a maroon t-shirt, charcoal grey sweatpants, black high top Converse sneakers.

The duo were seen chatting away after grabbing a bite to eat as they enjoyed the warm spring weather.

On Thursday, Robert revealed to CBS Mornings' host Gayle King via a phone call that his newborn's name is Gia Virginia Chen-De Niro.

He and partner Tiffany Chen's baby girl was born on Thursday, April 6, weighing 8 pounds, 6 ounces.

'This baby is planned,' Robert said, adding that they both wanted the baby and are 'over the moon.'

'She was brought here by love,' Gayle said Robert told her in their phone call.

The legendary star shocked the world when he revealed he had 'just had a baby' after Tiffany, who is believed to be 45 - was seen with a baby bump in March.

Gayle revealed that she had interviewed Robert earlier this month with Sebastian Maniscalco about his new movie About My Father.

During the interview, she asked him a question if his kids ever said he was embarrassing him, to which he responded: 'All the time.'

After news broke of his exciting new addition, Gayle called him to ask why he did not tell her about his newborn earlier, to which he said it didn't come up in the interview.

The follow-up came after he announced the surprising new addition to his family, telling ET Canada: 'I just had a baby.'

Robert revealed his happy news in a new interview, after he was asked by a reporter what it was like to be a father of six children. That is when he said he did not have six, but rather seven children, then shared that he recently welcomed a new child into his life.

He did not share the name of the baby or the gender at the time of the interview.

They were photographed holding hands in July 2021 and in March of this year she appeared pregnant when leaving Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica, California.

His rep confirmed to DailyMail.com that De Niro did not make a mistake and that he does indeed have seven children.

The Godfather actor has six other other children; Drena, 51, and Raphael, 46 with his ex-wife Diahnne Abbott, Elliot, 25, and Helen, 11, with ex-wife Grace Hightower, and twins Aaron and Julian, 27, with former girlfriend, Toukie Smith.

Tiffany and Robert are thought to have first met in 2015 when they worked on the film The Intern together.

The film also starred Anne Hathaway as a workaholic CEO, with Robert working at her company as a senior intern.
