        "text": "May 7 is celebrated as the birth anniversary of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. It is known as Pachishe Boisakh in West Bengal. Tagore - the poet, novelist, essayist, philosopher and musician - is part of the everyday life of an average Bengali. He was born on this day in Kolkata (then known as Calcutta) in 1861. Rabindranath Tagore is best known for his contribution to the field of Bengali literature and politics. His poems, short stories, songs (referred to as Rabindra sangeet), plays and novels are still revered and analysed in different fields of art.\n\nHe was the first non-European to receive the Nobel Prize (1913) for his contribution to world literature.\n\nThis year, the world is celebrating the 163rd birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore. He penned more than 2,000 songs and several novels, dance dramas and short stories. Some of Tagore's best works are Gora, Gitanjali, Rakta Karabi, Ghare Baire, Shesher Kobita, Raja O Rani, Tasher Desh, Dena Paona and Shanchayita.\n\nThe official handle of Nobel Prize posted a tribute for Tagore on this day, saying he received the prize \"because of his profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse\".\n\nTagore started writing short stories at the age of 16. His first short story was released in 1877. He wrote many stories between 1891 and 1895. The famous short stories written by him include Kabuliwala, Kshudita Pashan and Atithi.\n\nTagore penned the national anthem of India (Jana Gana Mana) as well as Bangladesh (Amar Shonar Bangla).\n\nSeveral events are organised across West Bengal to celebrate Rabindranath Tagore's birth anniversary. These include dramas, songs, recitals and many localities.\n\nA champion of social reform and universal humanism, Tagore's works advocate for harmony, empathy, and the celebration of diversity.\n\nAs a philosopher, Tagore's ideas on education continue to provoke thought and inspire discourse, leaving an indelible mark on modern Indian thought.\n\nClick for more trending news"
