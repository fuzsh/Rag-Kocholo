        "text": "The Nobel Prize is an award given annually for outstanding achievement in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine or physiology, literature, and economics, and for the promotion of peace.\n\nIt is widely considered one of the most prestigious awards in these fields.\n\nEach specific award is referred to with the name of the field it was awarded in, as in the Nobel Prize in Physics. The Nobel Prize awarded for the promotion of peace is popularly called the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nRecipients of the prize are known as Nobel laureates (or, less commonly, Nobelists). They receive a medal and a sizable cash prize.\n\nThe recipients are chosen by an international committee based in Sweden, with the exception of the peace prize, which is awarded in Oslo by a committee of the Norwegian parliament.\n\nThe prize is named after its founder, Alfred Nobel, who established the prizes in his will to be awarded to “to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.”\n\nThe Nobel Prize is named after Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, inventor, and entrepreneur. He is best remembered for establishing the Nobel Prize and for inventing dynamite (among many other things).\n\nThe Nobel Prizes were established in 1901 but first awarded in 1910. Nobel’s will dictates that the awards be given out in his native Sweden, with the exception of the peace prize, which is awarded in Norway.\n\nThe economics prize was not one of the original prizes stipulated by Nobel’s will. It was established 1968 with private funds and is formally called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.\n\nNotable winners of the Nobel Prize include Marie Curie (the first Nobel laureate to win twice—for physics in 1903 and for chemistry prize in 1911), Albert Einstein (physics; 1921), Martin Luther King, Jr. (peace; 1964), and Malala Yousafzai (peace; 2014), among many others.\n\nWhat are some terms that often get used in discussing the Nobel Prize?\n\npeace\n\nphysics\n\nchemistry\n\nmedicine\n\nphysiology\n\nliterature\n\neconomics\n\nlaureate\n\nThe Nobel Prize is widely regarded as one of the most prestigious honors in the world. The Nobel Peace Prize is the best known of the prizes."
