        "text": "(PDF) (DOC) (JPG)October 14, 2011\n\n(MAHWAH, NJ) – Lecturer at New College, University of Toronto Kathleen O’Connell will speak at Ramapo College on Thursday, November 10 at 7 p.m. in the Trustees Pavilion (Room 1) under the auspices of the Asia Society, New York and the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies of Ramapo College.\n\nO’Connell will discuss “Rabindranath Tagore; the Poet as Educator and Environmentalist.”\n\nIndian poet, writer, artist and thinker Rabindranath Tagore won Nobel Laureate in 1913 for literature as the first Asian Nobel Laureate and was a singular “cultural icon” that embodied and articulated an integrated conception of human culture.\n\nThrough his works that included poetry, philosophy, and painting, Tagore projected a vision of human life that stemmed from the cultural of his native Bengal and embraced humanity as a whole.\n\nO’Connell will explore how and why his work-particularly as it pertains to education and the environment-may become more widely known and more accurately appreciated worldwide.\n\nO’Connell teaches courses on Rabindranath Tagore and Satyajit Ray at New College, University of Toronto. Her writings on Tagore have been included in journals, encyclopedias, as book-chapters and in conference volumes.\n\nHer works include “Rabindranath Tagore: The Poet as Educator and Bravo Professor Shonku.” She also co-edited “Rabindranath Tagore: Facets of a Cultural Icon’ issue and Rabindranth Tagore: Claiming a Cultural Icon.”\n\nThe presentation, made possible through a grant from the Asia Society, is free and open to the public. For more information or to reserve a seat, please call 201.684.7409.\n\nO’Connell’s talk, as well as one being held on Monday, November 7 on “A Transnational Fascination: the Indian Nobel Prize Winning Writer Rabindranath Tagore in Discourse with Albert Einstein and Martin Buber,” will be held in conjunction with Rabindranath Tagore: The Last Harvest. Comprised of Tangore’s artwork, it is on view at the Asia Society Museum through December 31, 2010. The exhibition is curated by Dr. Sivakumar of Visva Bharati University and is co-organized by the National Gallery of Modern Art, Ministry of Culture, Government of India and Asia Society Museum, New York.\n\nFor media inquiries, contact Anna Farneski, assistant vice president, Marketing and Communications, 201.684.6844.\n\n###\n\nAbout Ramapo College\n\nRamapo College of New Jersey is the state’s premier public liberal arts college and is committed to academic excellence through interdisciplinary and experiential learning, and international and intercultural understanding.
