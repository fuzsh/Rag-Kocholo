        "meta_description": "On December 10, 1913, Rabindranath Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his book ‘Gitanjali’ and became the first non-European to receive it. Rabindranath Tagore was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Tagore modernised Bengali art by rejecting rigid classical forms and resisting structural linguistics. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke about topics ranging from political to personal. Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are his best-known works, and his short stories and novels were acclaimed for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation.His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's Jana Gana Mana and Bangladesh's Amar Shonar Bangla. n",
