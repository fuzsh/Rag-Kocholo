        "text": "There’s been a great deal of excitement over Bob Dylan winning the 2016 Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nIt’s rare for artists who have achieved widespread, mainstream popularity to win the coveted prize. And although Nobels often go to Americans, the last literature prize to go to one was Toni Morrison in 1993. Furthermore, according to The New York Times, “It is the first time the honor has gone to a musician.”\n\nBut as Bob Dylan might croon, “The Times, they are mistaken.”\n\nA Bengali literary giant, who probably wrote more songs than him, preceded Dylan’s win by over a century. Rabindranath Tagore, a wildly talented Indian poet, painter, and musician, took the prize in 1913.\n\nThe first musician (and first non-European) to win the Nobel Prize for literature, Tagore possessed an artistry—and lasting influence—that mirrored Dylan’s.\n\nBengal’s own renaissance man\n\nTagore was born in 1861 into a wealthy family and was a lifelong resident of Bengal, the eastern Indian province whose capital was Kolkata (formerly Calcutta). Born before the invention of film, Tagore was a keen observer of India’s emergence into the modern age; much of his work was influenced by new media and other cultures.\n\nLike Dylan, Tagore was largely self-taught. And both were associated with non-violent social change. Tagore was a supporter of Indian independence and a friend of Mahatma Gandhi‘s, while Dylan penned much of the soundtrack for the 1960s protest movement. Each was a multitalented artist: writer, musician, visual artist and film composer. (Dylan is also a filmmaker.)\n\nThe Nobel website states that Tagore, though he wrote in many genres, was principally a poet who published more than 50 volumes of verse, as well as plays, short stories, and novels. Tagore’s music isn’t mentioned until the last sentence, which says that the artist “also left… songs for which he wrote the music himself,” as if this much-loved body of work was no more than an afterthought.\n\nBut with over 2,000 songs to his name, Tagore’s output of music alone is extremely impressive. Many continue to be used in films, while three of his songs were chosen as national anthems by India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, an unparalleled achievement.\n\nToday, Tagore’s significance as a songwriter is undisputed. A YouTube search for Tagore’s songs, using the search term “Rabindra Sangeet” (Bengali for “Tagore songs”), yields about 234,000 hits.\n\nAlthough Tagore was—and remains—a musical icon in India, this aspect of his work hasn’t been recognised in the West. Perhaps for this reason, music seems not to have had much or any influence on the 1913 Nobel committee, as judged by the presentation speech by committee chair Harald Hjärne. In fact, the word “music” is never used in the prize announcement. It is notable, however, that Hjärne says the work of Tagore’s that “especially arrested the attention of the selecting critics is the 1912 poetry collection ‘Gitanjali: Song Offerings.’”\n\nDylan: All about the songs\n\nIt may be that the Nobel organization’s downplaying of Tagore’s significance as a musician is part of the same thinking that has long delayed Dylan’s receiving the prize: uneasiness over subsuming song into the category of literature.\n\nIt’s rumoured that Dylan was first nominated in 1996. If true, it means Nobel committees have been wrestling with the idea of honouring this extraordinary lyricist for two decades. Rolling Stone called Dylan’s win “easily the most controversial award since they gave it to the guy who wrote ‘Lord of the Flies,’ which was controversial only because it came next after the immensely popular 1982 prize for Gabriel García Márquez.”\n\nUnlike Tagore’s Nobel announcement, in which his songs were an afterthought, the presentation announcing Dylan’s award made it clear that aside from a handful of other literary contributions this prize is all about his music. And therein lies the controversy, with some saying he shouldn’t have won—that being a pop culture icon who wrote songs disqualifies him.\n\nBut like many great literary figures, Dylan is a man of letters; his songs abound with the names of those who came before him, whether it’s Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot in “Desolation Row” or James Joyce in “I Feel a Change Comin’ On.”\n\nWhy not celebrate Bob by being like Bob and reading something unfamiliar, great and historically important? Tagore’s “Gitanjali,” his most famous collection of poems, is available in the poet’s own English translation, with an introduction by William Butler Yeats (who won his own Nobel in literature in 1923). And YouTube is a great repository for some of Tagore’s most celebrated songs (search for “Rabindra Sangeet”).\n\nMany music lovers have long hoped that the parameters of literature might be writ a bit larger to include song. While Dylan’s win is certainly an affirmation, remembering that he’s not the first can only pave the way for more musicians to win in years to come.\n\nImage by Cherishsantosh on Wikimedia licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0."
