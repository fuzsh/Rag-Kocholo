        "text": "5 Best Poems of Rabindranath Tagore\n\nRabindranath Tagore, a legendary writer and poetic philosopher born in Calcutta, India, in 1861, holds a revered place in the world of literature. His remarkable contributions earned him the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, making him the first non-European to receive such an esteemed honor.\n\nTagore was a prolific writer who excelled in both Bengali and English literature, exploring various genres with his exceptional talent. His diverse skills encompassed poetry, novels, short stories, essays, plays, education, spirituality, lyrics, composition, and singing, showcasing his versatility and brilliance.\n\nOne of Tagore’s most celebrated works is “Gitanjali: An Anthology of Poems,” a gift of labor that resonates with humanity worldwide. The anthology captures the essence of his profound thoughts and emotions, touching the hearts of countless readers.\n\nEven in his late sixties, Tagore ventured into the realm of visual arts, producing an astounding collection of 2,500 paintings and drawings before his passing. His creativity knew no bounds, and his artistic expressions were as mesmerizing as his written masterpieces.\n\nTagore’s lyrical compositions extended beyond the realm of literature and were adopted as national anthems by two nations. “Jana Gana Mana” became India’s national anthem, while “Amar Shonar Bangla” became the anthem of Bangladesh. Additionally, Sri Lanka’s national anthem, “Namo Namo Matha,” was both written and composed by Tagore, at the request of his beloved Sri Lankan student, Ananda Samarkun, who later translated the lyrics into Sinhala.\n\nWe proudly presents the five best poems from the treasure trove of literature left behind by this unparalleled literary genius:\n\nUnknown date\n\nShameela Yoosuf Ali\n\n5 Best Poems of Rabindranath Tagore\n\nBorn in 1861 Calcutta, India, the legendary writer and poetic philosopher, Rabindranath Tagore won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913. He was the first non-European to receive such an honour.\n\nTagore wrote in Bengali and English, experimenting various genres of literature.\n\nTagore was a poet, novelist, short-story writer, essayist, playwright, educationist, spiritualist, lyricist, composer and singer.\n\nWith an extraordinary repertoire, showcasing an incredible combination of talents, Tagore was way ahead his time.\n\nTagore’s Gitanjali: An Anthology of Poems is a celebrated gift of labour to the whole of humanity.\n\nIn his late sixties, Tagore became fascinated with the visual arts, creating 2,500 paintings and drawings before his death.\n\nIn addition, his lyrical compositions were chosen by two nations as their national anthems: India’s ‘Jana Gana Mana’ and Bangladesh’s ‘Amar Shonar Bangla’.\n\nSri Lanka’s national anthem, ‘Namo Namo Matha’ was both written and composed by Tagore. He did it at the request of his favourite Sri Lankan student at Santiniketan, Ananda Samarkun, who later translated the lyrics into Sinhala.\n\nDESIblitz brings you the best five poems out of the treasure collection of literature of this unsurpassed literary genius.\n\n1. ‘Where the Mind is Without Fear’\n\nWhere the mind is without fear and the head is held high;\n\nWhere knowledge is free;\n\nWhere the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;\n\nWhere words come out from the depth of truth;\n\nWhere tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection:\n\nWhere the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;\n\nWhere the mind is lead forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action–\n\nInto that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.\n\nThe superlative poem, titled ‘Where the Mind is Without Fear’, talks about the boundless power of human knowledge, valour of standing by the truth, and the essence of true freedom.\n\n2. ‘Leave This’\n\nLeave this chanting and singing and telling of beads!\n\nWhom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut?\n\nOpen thine eyes and see thy God is not before thee!\n\nHe is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground\n\nand where the pathmaker is breaking stones.\n\nHe is with them in sun and in shower,\n\nand his garment is covered with dust.\n\nPut off thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil!\n\nThe poem ‘Leave This’ addresses the hypocrisy within our hearts in the name of religion. In our pursuit of God, we truly seem to be running away from Him.\n\n3. ‘Let Me Not Forget’\n\nIf it is not my portion to meet thee in this life\n\nthen let me ever feel that I have missed thy sight\n\n—let me not forget for a moment,\n\nlet me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams\n\nand in my wakeful hours.\n\nAs my days pass in the crowded market of this world\n\nand my hands grow full with the daily profits,\n\nlet me ever feel that I have gained nothing\n\n—let me not forget for a moment,\n\nlet me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams\n\nand in my wakeful hours.\n\nWhen I sit by the roadside, tired and panting,\n\nwhen I spread my bed low in the dust,\n\nlet me ever feel that the long journey is still before me\n\n—let me not forget a moment,\n\nlet me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams\n\nand in my wakeful hours.\n\nWhen my rooms have been decked out and the flutes sound\n\nand the laughter there is loud,\n\nlet me ever feel that I have not invited thee to my house\n\n—let me not forget for a moment,\n\nlet me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams\n\nand in my wakeful hours.\n\nThis exquisite piece of poetry, ‘Let Me Not Forget’ expresses the melancholic emptiness behind missing the beloved. The lines are beautiful yet they carry spasms of distress.\n\n4. ‘Last Curtain’\n\nI know that the day will come\n\nwhen my sight of this earth shall be lost,\n\nand life will take its leave in silence,\n\ndrawing the last curtain over my eyes.\n\nYet stars will watch at night,\n\nand morning rise as before,\n\nand hours heave like sea waves casting up pleasures and pains.\n\nWhen I think of this end of my moments,\n\nthe barrier of the moments breaks\n\nand I see by the light of death\n\nthy world with its careless treasures.\n\nRare is its lowliest seat,\n\nrare is its meanest of lives.\n\nThings that I longed for in vain\n\nand things that I got\n\n—let them pass.\n\nLet me but truly possess\n\nthe things that I ever spurned\n\nand overlooked.\n\nThe ‘Last Curtain’ converses about the vulnerability one feels at the time of death.\n\nThe actual treasures one can take to the grave are none but his deeds of good.\n\nThe unrivalled poem conveys the message that what matters more at death, are the things that are least considered by man.\n\n5. ‘Freedom’\n\nFreedom from fear is the freedom\n\nI claim for you my motherland!\n\nFreedom from the burden of the ages, bending your head,\n\nbreaking your back, blinding your eyes to the beckoning\n\ncall of the future;\n\nFreedom from the shackles of slumber wherewith\n\nyou fasten yourself in night’s stillness,\n\nmistrusting the star that speaks of truth’s adventurous paths;\n\nfreedom from the anarchy of destiny\n\nwhole sails are weakly yielded to the blind uncertain winds,\n\nand the helm to a hand ever rigid and cold as death.\n\nFreedom from the insult of dwelling in a puppet’s world,\n\nwhere movements are started through brainless wires,\n\nrepeated through mindless habits,\n\nwhere figures wait with patience and obedience for the\n\nmaster of show,\n\nto be stirred into a mimicry of life.\n\nFreedom is the soul of every country, community and civilisation. Tagore’s poem, ‘Freedom’, seems to be penned exclusively for the independence struggle of India.\n\nIt matches up with every battle a person struggles with for both freedom and autonomy from oppression and control.\n\nRabindranath Tagore introduced new prose and verse structures into Bengali literature, releasing it from its traditional shackles.\n\nHe lives among us even to this day through his works of eloquent, poetic prose and his comprehension of the human psychology."
