        "text": "The New Orleans Pelicans agreed to bring back veteran Emeka Okafor on a second 10-day contract after his impressive performance in Monday's win over the Detroit Pistons.\n\nOkafor, 35, started for the first time since April 2013 in Monday's win and he held his own against Detroit star center Andre Drummond, finishing with eight points and seven rebounds in 14 minutes.\n\nOkafor was out of the league for nearly five years after suffering a herniated disc in his neck before signing a 10-day deal to join the Pelicans on Feb. 3. The team announced his second deal on Wednesday and it doesn't expire until after Feb. 25.\n\nTeams are only allowed to sign players to two 10-day contracts during the regular season. If New Orleans wants to keep him around after Feb. 23, it will have to guarantee his contract through the rest of the season.\n\nNew Orleans needed frontcourt help after losing All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins to a season-ending injury, and Okafor brings energy and veteran leadership to the team's bench.\n\nIn three games with the Pelicans, Okafor is averaging 5.0 points and 5.7 rebounds.\n\nWill Guillory can be reached at wguillory@nola.com or 504.258.5344.
