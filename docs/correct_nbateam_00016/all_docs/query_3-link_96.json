        "text": "Life is uncertain. I'm just making sure to leave some doors--and\n\nwindows--open. --Emeka Okafor, Connecticut center\n\nThe coach has a standing invitation to his players: Visit my\n\noffice every day, Jim Calhoun tells them. Stop by and say hello.\n\nTell me about your schoolwork or your family. Tell me your\n\ntroubles, or tell me what you just ate for lunch. ¬∂ Like small\n\nchildren called home to bedtime, Calhoun's players have regularly\n\nfound their way to his deskside in the basement of Gampel\n\nPavilion, and they have relished the love. In the fall of 2001,\n\nhowever, freshman Emeka Okafor arrived from Houston, and when he\n\nwould dutifully make the trip to Calhoun's suite he was decidedly\n\nill at ease, shifting about like a man with sore feet.\n\n\"He was perfectly polite,\" says assistant coach George Blaney, a\n\nwitness to those visits, \"but he clearly viewed the situation as\n\na waste of time. Everything in his attitude said, What is it you\n\nwant? I don't have time for this chitchat.\"\n\nHis family, his friends and his coaches shrug and explain that\n\nEmeka (pronounced ee-MECC-a) is just different. By the simple\n\nnumbers he is Connecticut's 6'9\", 252-pound junior center, the\n\nnation's leading shot blocker (4.7 per game) and a rebounding\n\nforce (11.2 per game) with a rapidly developing offensive game.\n\nOkafor is the reason to predict that Calhoun's Huskies will win\n\ntheir second national title in six years. \"You're talking about a\n\nunique combination of talent, intelligence and toughness,\" says\n\nVillanova coach Jay Wright.\n\nBut simple basketball numbers are only the beginning of what\n\nmakes Okafor unique. He is also a gifted and tenacious student\n\nwho will complete his UConn degree (with a major in finance, a\n\nno-nonsense discipline) in May, just three years after enrolling,\n\nand currently carries a 3.7 GPA. He has neither tattoos (\"Too\n\npermanent,\" he says), piercings (\"Ouch!\") nor the requisite BMOC\n\nSUV. When Janice Wilbur, the school's substance abuse-prevention\n\ncoordinator, needs a high-profile face to lecture freshmen on the\n\nevils of sex and drugs on campus, she hits Okafor on her speed\n\ndial. \"He's different from any other basketball player,\" says\n\nHuskies guard--and potential first-team All-America--Ben Gordon.\n\nNone of this is new. When Okafor was a fourth-grader in Houston,\n\nhe brought home a B on his report card and was so crestfallen\n\nthat he dissolved in tears. \"What child cries over a B in the\n\nfourth grade?\" asks his father, Pius. Five years later, when\n\nEmeka was playing on the city champion freshman basketball team\n\nat Houston's Bellaire High, he carried his books to the bench to\n\nstudy--in uniform--while resting a sore knee. Whenever his first\n\nAAU coach, orthodontist George Schudy, would use an uncommon\n\nword, Emeka would interrupt and ask him to define it. Among his\n\nhigh school friends were the nerdy kids who took honors-level\n\ncourses and were generally shunned by athletes. Okafor's friends\n\nwere more foresighted than he was. Says Brandon Lepow, a high\n\nschool teammate who is now a junior at St. Edwards University in\n\nAustin, \"We were always telling him, 'You're going to the NBA.\n\nJust focus on basketball.'\"\n\nSoon enough, Okafor was working on his game with equal passion.\n\nIn the spring of his senior year he looked hard at his long,\n\n220-pound body in the mirror, concluded \"I'm skinny,\" and began\n\nworking out every morning with former Houston Phi Slamma Jamma\n\nforward Michael Young, who is a personal trainer. He didn't miss\n\na day for nearly six months and arrived in Storrs, Conn., at a\n\nbuff 240.\n\nThere, his obsessive discipline--in athletics and\n\nacademics--continued. He spooked Gordon, his freshman roommate,\n\nwho would awaken in the small hours and find their dorm room\n\nilluminated by a desk light or computer, as Okafor toiled away at\n\nassignments. \"He has this inhuman willpower to get things\n\nfinished,\" says Gordon. During that same freshman year, in order\n\nto more quickly accumulate credits toward a swift graduation,\n\nOkafor took the final exam in a business calculus course without\n\ntaking the course, simply by reading the textbook. \"It's called\n\n'testing out of the course,'\" says Ted Taigen, Connecticut's\n\nfaculty adviser for men's basketball. \"Most people are afraid to\n\ndo it because while they may get a passing grade for the credit,\n\nthat grade may not be high and it will hurt their GPA.\" Okafor\n\ngot a B, the lowest grade on his transcript. This he catalogs\n\nwithout emotion. \"It wasn't worth my time to take the entire\n\ncourse,\" he says. \"And realistically, my GPA isn't going to be\n\nthat important.\"\n\nNot unless NBA scouts start checking report cards. It will be a\n\nshock if Okafor doesn't leave UConn after this season--degree in\n\nhand--to play pro ball. He works overtime on his game, trying to\n\nrefine his offense in exhausting sessions with senior walk-on\n\nJustin Evanovich. \"All I'm doing is rebounding and feeding, and I\n\nget tired before he does,\" says Evanovich.\n\nFor now, Okafor dismisses all NBA talk. \"That's so far down the\n\nroad,\" he says. Instead he's chosen to wrap his ample wingspan\n\naround this year and treasure it. \"When I talk to freshmen, I\n\ntell them, 'College is the last stop before reality hits,'\" he\n\nsays. \"Life is simple here. It's carefree. What I want this year\n\nis a ring. And some good memories to take with me. That's simple\n\nenough.\"\n\nOkafor's story begins far away, in the eastern Nigerian town of\n\nEnugwu-ukwu, where Pius Okafor was born in 1951. Pius was one of\n\nsix children of Anakwuo Okafor's second wife (his first wife had\n\nborne him four others), and he was 16 years old when Nigeria was\n\nriven by a civil war that would cost more than one million lives,\n\nmost by war-induced starvation. His family lived in a Biafran\n\nrefugee camp for much of the 30-month conflict (his father died\n\nthere), and when Pius joined the rebel Biafran army at 17, he did\n\nso willingly. \"I wanted something to eat,\" he says. \"And there\n\nwas no food in the refugee camp.\" He was assigned to a primitive\n\nmedical unit--once he worked in vain to save his wounded best\n\nfriend's life--but several times was handed a rifle and told to\n\nfight. After the war ended in 1970 with Biafra's surrender, he\n\nspent four years working as a tax collector until a cousin begged\n\nhim to seek a better life in the United States. After his cousin\n\ninformed him of the affordable tuition, Pius applied for\n\nadmission to Grambling, in Louisiana, and was accepted.\n\nAfter one semester at Grambling, Pius moved to Houston. There,\n\nwhile pumping gas at night, he earned a degree at Texas Southern\n\nUniversity in 3 1/2 years. (Like son, like father.) In 1980 he\n\nreturned for a visit to Nigeria and met his wife, Celestina. They\n\nwere married in Houston in September 1981; one year later their\n\nonly son was born and named Chukwuemeka Ndubisi.\n\nPius raised his family while chasing degrees the way he had once\n\nchased food: first an M.B.A. in 1982 and six years later a\n\nmaster's in accounting. From 1990 to '92 he worked for Phillips\n\nPetroleum in Bartlesville, Okla. The family moved back to Houston\n\nin '92, but three years later Pius started taking courses that\n\nwould help him gain acceptance to pharmacy school. Since '97 he\n\nhas lived most of the year in Kansas City, pursuing a doctorate\n\nin pharmacy at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. (The 5'7\"\n\nCelestina, who is a registered nurse, and Emeka's sister, Nneka,\n\n5'8\" and a high school senior, remain in Houston; Pius, 6'3\",\n\nvisits every three weeks.) He resides two blocks from the urban\n\ncampus in a tiny studio apartment that, if upgraded, would be\n\nspartan. The bed rubs against a couch, which rubs against the\n\nkitchen table. He has only what he needs. A battered 19-inch\n\ntelevision sits in a cabinet. \"I have my TV, I have ESPN Full\n\nCourt,\" says Pius. \"I never miss a game.\"\n\nEmeka prospered slowly on the basketball court. He was moved to\n\nBellaire's varsity only in the middle of his sophomore year, and\n\neven when he was invited to national shoe-company-sponsored camps\n\nbetween his junior and senior years (as are hundreds of\n\nprospects), he was not a high-profile recruit. \"I don't think\n\nanyone could have predicted back then that he would become the\n\nplayer he's become,\" says Texas coach Rick Barnes, who had just\n\ntwo scholarships to hand out in Okafor's senior year and did not\n\nrecruit him.\n\nSays Calhoun, \"I saw him at Nike camp in the summer before his\n\nsenior year. He was devoid of any offensive game, but he kept\n\nblocking shots. I loved his quickness off the floor.\"\n\nIn his senior year Okafor, who ranked in the top 10% of his class\n\nand boasted a 1,310 SAT score, decided he wanted to go to\n\nStanford, but Stanford never made him an offer. The Ivies were\n\ninterested, but Okafor wanted better basketball. Arkansas,\n\nGeorgia Tech, Vanderbilt and Rice were aggressive. Calhoun stayed\n\ninterested and then in April saw Okafor in an all-star game in\n\nPittsburgh, during which he had 26 points, 12 rebounds and 10\n\nblocks. He had made huge strides and suddenly many schools were\n\nsniffing around. After the Pittsburgh game Calhoun called Storrs\n\nand talked to assistant Karl Hobbs (now coach at George\n\nWashington). Okafor had been a project. Now he was a must-get.\n\n\"If we lose this guy,\" Calhoun told Hobbs, \"it's going to be an\n\nincredible loss.\"\n\nOkafor measured his options. \"I knew they won the championship in\n\n1999,\" he says of the Huskies. \"I knew they were building to win\n\nanother one. Coach Calhoun told me I'd get 15 to 20 minutes a\n\ngame, and more if I earned it. I came back and told my dad, 'I\n\nthink this is a good fit for me.'\"\n\nHis decision made, Okafor arrived in Storrs for Calhoun's summer\n\ncamp. He kept getting better. Blaney, the former head coach at\n\nHoly Cross and Seton Hall, got his first look at the incoming\n\nfreshman in an evening pickup game. He went to Calhoun's office\n\nand stuck a Post-It on the coach's desk. It read: EMEKA. OH MY\n\nGOD. Caron Butler of the Miami Heat, who played one season with\n\nOkafor, says, \"He's got attributes you can't teach.\"\n\nOkafor averaged 30 minutes a game as a freshman and got 19 points\n\nand 15 rebounds in a nationally televised victory at Arizona.\n\nLast year he doubled his scoring from eight points a game to\n\nnearly 16. \"He came here mature, and he's gotten more mature,\"\n\nsays Connecticut senior point guard Taliek Brown. \"Everything is\n\nserious. Straight business.\" Okafor will need only one course in\n\nthe spring to graduate. In the fall semester he is enrolled in a\n\nspecial business course that allows an invited group of seniors\n\nto invest a small portion of the university's endowment. \"This\n\nclass could come in handy next year,\" says Okafor, as he sat\n\nwatching instructor Pat Terrion pull up stock charts from the\n\nInternet.\n\nNext year, of course, Okafor will be investing his own money, not\n\nUConn's. There is a consensus that he'll be a lottery pick and\n\nthat the team that gets him will immediately benefit from his\n\npro-ready rebounding and shot-blocking skills. \"He could make a\n\ndefensive impact in our league today,\" says one NBA general\n\nmanager. Okafor's offense, by contrast, is mechanical, in need of\n\nrefinement. \"He has to get better,\" says another NBA front office\n\nexecutive. If that observer knew Okafor better, he would realize\n\nthat pursuit of that improvement is assured.\n\nOn a mid-autumn afternoon Okafor played in pickup games at aging\n\nGuyer Gym for 90 minutes with his teammates. When they left and\n\nUConn's mighty women took the floor, Okafor walked to an adjacent\n\ncourt with Evanovich and began his drills. Short jumpers were\n\nfollowed by longer ones, and then by post moves. Occasionally\n\nOkafor pierced the air with a baritone curse, then reschooled\n\nhimself with baby jumpers nearer the hoop. He worked for 30\n\nminutes on lefthanded moves alone. Then he stopped for a water\n\nbreak. \"People are proud of me,\" he said, after pulling a long\n\nslug from a bottle. \"But I can't be proud of myself. I have to be\n\nblunt. I have to be harsh.\"\n\nOkafor dropped the bottle and walked back onto the court. When\n\nthe workout began, sunlight had poured through dusty skylights.\n\nNow it was nearly dark. He snatched a ball and pounded it twice\n\non the floor, not nearly finished for the day.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPH BY JEFFERY A.
