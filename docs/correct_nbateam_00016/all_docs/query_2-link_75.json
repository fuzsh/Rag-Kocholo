        "text": "Emeka Okafor trades post-game text messages this season with buddies such as Alex Cooper and Zach Johnson, fifth-year senior offensive linemen with whom he started his career at the University of Houston.\n\nThese are high times for the Cougars, who are 10-0, ranked and headed toward a conference title.\n\nOkafor's missing out on that, but that's OK. Coming up on the end of his college football career, the 6-foot-5, 325-pound senior from Sunnyvale is a starter for the first time after transferring from UH to Texas Tech.\n\n\"It's been a real blessing,\" Okafor said this week. \"I'm glad I stuck through it to play, and I'm glad I got the opportunity to play at a Big 12 university and a talented (team), so it's a really good deal for me.\"\n\nOkafor earned a bachelor's degree at the U of H, then took advantage of the NCAA's graduate-transfer rule to spend his final season of eligibility at Tech. He barely played for seven games, other than serving as a massive body on placement-kick protection.\n\nHis big break came Oct. 26 at Oklahoma when Baylen Brown tweaked a knee. Instead of being a one-day stopgap, though, Okafor's started each of the last three games at right tackle. Brown missed only one game, but Okafor hasn't given up his spot.\n\n\"We thought he could help us with depth,\" Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury said, \"and he's just gotten better and better each week and really solidified that offensive line. He gives us some more size that we were lacking once Justin Murphy went out. I can't say enough good things about his effort and how he's progressed.\"\n\nIn effect, Okafor's bumped out Tony Morales, who'd started five games in a row at right guard. Last week, line coach Lee Hays went with a first-time pairing of Brown at right guard and Okafor at right tackle.\n\n\"He's done great,\" Brown said. \"He knows what he's doing. He's a big guy, so he'll move people around. I like playing next to him, and I'm comfortable with him next to me.\"\n\nOkafor played in 36 games as a backup at Houston. But when the Cougars fired head caoch Tony Levine and hired Tom Herman after last season, Okafor realized he knew a lot more coaches at Tech than the new crew at U of H.\n\nHe was in position to jump, having finished school. He just needed an invitation.\n\n\"There were a lot of changes (at Houston),\" he said. \"Every year, we changed coaches: O-line coaches, OCs (offensive coordinators). I wanted to be with people I'm familiar with. That's why I wanted to come here and try my hand.\"\n\nTech coaches Kingsbury, Hays, Eric Morris, David Gibbs, Zac Spavital, Chad Dennis and Brett Dewhurst all knew Okafor from their overlapping time in the Cougars' program.\n\n\"It made the transition (to Tech) really, really, really easy for me,\" Okafor said.\n\nThat's true not only from the standpoint of seeing familiar faces but hearing familiar calls.\n\n\"He's a senior, and the system was the same,\" Hays said, \"because he goes back to coach Kingsbury when he was a coordinator there. So the calls and all that stuff, as far as play calls go, were the same for him. So it wasn't that big an adjustment for Emeka.\"\n\nOnce he decided to leave Houston, Okafor looked at nearby Lamar. He called Hays to see if his former line coach suggested any other destinations.\n\n\"I really didn't expect Tech to give me an offer,\" he said, \"but when he (Hays) told me, my mind was pretty made up after that.\"\n\nHays describes Okafor as \"a phenomenal young man\" and \"a really nice kid.\" One challenge is getting him to flip the switch and get mean on game day.\n\nHowever, Hays said he's pleasantly surprised with what Okafor's done at tackle, considering he's a more natural guard.\n\nHe's come along just in time, though, both in his development and filling a hole for the Red Raiders.\n\n\"I'm glad I got the opportunity,\" he said. \"It's a little bit later than I would have hoped, obviously. I think I've gotten a little bit better every week.\"\n\ndon.williams@lubbockonline.com\n\n• 766-8734\n\nFollow Don on Twitter\n\n@AJ_DonWilliams\n\nName game\n\nTexas Tech tackle Emeka Okafor said he's no relation to the former NBA player of the same name who went to Houston Bellaire.\n\n\"'Emeka Okafor' is like 'John Smith' here,\" the Tech player said. \"It's very popular back in Nigeria.\"\n\nTech's Okafor said he is a distant cousin to former Texas defensive lineman Alex Okafor, but not to former Tech tackle Mickey Okafor. Everyone just assumed as much five years ago when Mickey was playing for the Red Raiders and Emeka visited Lubbock as a recruit.\n\n\"I was wearing my letterman jacket,\" Okafor said, \"and everywhere I'd go, 'Oh, you're related to Mickey, huh'? This happened probably 10 times coming into the city. I was, 'Who's Mickey?' I got up here and watched the spring game and lo and behold, we have the same name.\n\n\"But no relation, no.\"\n\nNext career\n\nTech lineman Emeka Okafor got his undergraduate degree from Houston in sociology. The graduate classes he's taking at Tech are in interdisciplinary studies with a focus in history and sports science.\n\nHe plans to teach history and coach."
