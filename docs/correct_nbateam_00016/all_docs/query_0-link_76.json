        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — As Emeka Okafor walked the course at the Wachovia Championship, golf fans stopped the Charlotte Bobcats forward to congratulate him on winning the NBA's Rookie of the Year award.\n\nEven Tiger Woods made a point to offer well wishes.\n\nOnly then did Okafor realize just what the award meant.\n\n\"I think I underestimated the value of how people would react to it,\" Okafor said Wednesday after the official award presentation. \"We went out to dinner last night and people were yelling, 'Hey, Rookie of the Year! That's great!' and today on the golf course everyone was cheering for me.\"\n\nSo which was cooler — the award or meeting Woods?\n\n\"I have to go with the award,\" Okafor grinned. \"Sorry, Tiger.\"\n\nBut the greatest pleasure has been the reaction from the Charlotte fans, who are still lukewarm when it comes to embracing the NBA and their hometown Bobcats. After feverishly supporting the Hornets during most of their 14-year tenure, fans tuned out professional basketball after the Hornets fled to New Orleans.\n\nIt's put pressure on Okafor, the No. 2 overall pick in the NBA draft, to carry Charlotte's expansion team and give the city something to be proud of.\n\nWinning top rookie honors was a huge step, coach Bernie Bickerstaff said.\n\n\"For all of us, the city, the organization and Emeka especially this is a tremendous honor,\" Bickerstaff said. \"It was not an easy selection because of the quality of talent in this rookie class.\n\n\"I wanted it to happen for Emeka because he was a very professional young man who had presence and a routine and it was really special.\"\n\nOkafor became the first former college player to win the award in four years. Cleveland guard LeBron James and Phoenix center Amare Stoudemire, who both jumped from high school to the NBA, were the last two winners of the rookie award.\n\nMemphis forward Pau Gasol, who won in 2002, played professionally in Spain before coming to the NBA.\n\nOkafor led all rookies in scoring (15.1 points a game) and rebounding (10.9 rpg) and was second in his class behind Atlanta's Josh Smith in blocks (1.71). He also ranked second in the NBA with 3.8 offensive rebounds a game.\n\nHe ended his season with 47 games in double figures in points and rebounds.\n\nOkafor received 77 of the 126 first-place votes from a media panel. He finished with 514 points while Chicago Bulls guard Ben Gordon was second with 433 points.\n\nGordon, the No. 3 pick in the draft, won the NBA's Sixth Man award Tuesday.\n\nOkafor said the head-to-head battle with his college roommate for the rookie award was sometimes uncomfortable for the two friends.\n\n\"Ben and I are not too big on individual awards,\" he said. \"We really didn't want to bring it up and I think when asked about it, we were both just aware of each other.\"\n\nBut both of them ending the season with their own individual awards made it worth it.\n\n\"It's a great thing. Ben and I shared dorm rooms and a dream and (an NCAA) championship,\" Okafor said. \"For us to be able to get an award each, it's just a nice storybook ending.\""
