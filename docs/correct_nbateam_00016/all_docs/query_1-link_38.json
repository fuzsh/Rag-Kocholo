        "text": "LaMelo Ball – Guard\n\nBaller in name, baller in nature. LaMelo has created 23.1 points per game and has an assist-per-game average of 8.0.\n\nBall was the third overall pick in 2020 and since entering the court in 2021, he has already become a team hero. He was the first Hornet to enter the All-Rookie First team in 16 years, and the first Rookie of the Year winner in 16 years.\n\nMany fans suggest we are currently in the LaMelo Ball era of the Hornets.\n\nWe haven’t had such a boost since the 2014 Drafts. In that season the Hornets picked up Noah Vonleg, Nicolas Batum, Jeremy Lamb, and Jeremy Lin.\n\nBy the end of 2015, our stats had improved to 48 wins over 34 losses. This was the biggest win in Franchise history.\n\nIn 2016, we were points away from the playoffs, which shows just how intense that boost was.\n\nLaMelo may bring us to the playoffs this year. But so far we might be repeating history.\n\nJames Bouknight – Guard\n\nBouknight has been on the team for 1 year and was picked 11th in the drafts. So far he hasn’t made a real impact having played for 6 minutes maximum in a game.\n\nEvery game that Bouknight has played, ended in a loss.\n\nTerry Rozier – Guard\n\nRozier has also played in 100% losing games. Having been on the team for 7 years, there isn’t really an excuse for these failures. He’s been scoring 21.7 points per game with 5 assists per game too.\n\nRozier was picked 16th overall in the drafts, showing another high-potential player going to waste.\n\nNick Richards – Center\n\nThe losing streak continues with Richards. His last 5 games have also been major losses.\n\nMark Williams – Center\n\nWilliams is a rookie player but has been consistently brought onto the team mid-game. Williams played for around 17 minutes scoring an average of 7 points per game. That’s roughly 2 points every minute.\n\nWilliams is doing very well as a defensive player, as his blocks and steals have slowed down his opponents. The Hornets would do well to re-train Williams into a Guard.\n\nJalen McDaniels – Forward Center\n\nMcDaniels is a dramatic player for the Hornets but his 10.6 points per game haven’t been enough to pull Charlotte out of their losing streak.\n\nBryce McGowens – Guard\n\nMcGowens is a Rookie, but his time on the team has been monumental. Of his 5 latest games 2 of them were wins – a rare sight for this team. These wins correlate with the team’s trust in McGowen’s shots.\n\nAgainst Huston, McGowen scored 10 points with a 75% Field Goal percentage, a 66.7% 3-Point percentage, and a 66.7% Free Throw percentage. He has similar stats against Atlanta, suggesting McGowens is wasted as a guard.\n\nDennis Smith Jr. – Guard\n\nSmith is another guard with high field goal percentages, suggesting the Hornets are incorrectly prioritizing guards over forwards.\n\nTheo Maledon – Guard\n\nMaledon is another player who has seen a win in their last 5 games, this time against Oklahoma. Granted, Maledon didn’t add much to the game, but his 4 assists were greatly appreciated.\n\nCody Martin – Forward\n\nMartin is one of the few real forwards on the Hornets. You might think the team is saving all of their good forwards and not sharing the spotlight, but like everyone else, Martin hasn’t seen many wins.\n\nHis average points per game is a measly 5, much worse than many of the guards.\n\nKelly Oubre Jr. – Forward Guard\n\nOubre is the exception to the rule. This forward is carrying the team with 20.2 points per game. Of his last 5 games, three of them were wins – that isn’t a coincidence. Injury has reduced his playtime, which in turn has reduced the Hornet’s changes in the season.\n\nGordon Hayward – Forward\n\nHayward has an average of 13.4 points per game, but even a claim like that hasn’t led to a recent win.\n\nAlso…\n\nThe other players on the team include JT Thor, Kai Jones, Mason Plumlee, and P.J. Washington. They are all forwards, but none have achieved more than 3 points per game."
