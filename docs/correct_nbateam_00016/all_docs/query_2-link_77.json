        "text": "But Stanford vows not to back down from the Huskies' big man. SPOKANE, Wash. — Emeka Okafor plays basketball as if he's on a pogo stick.\n\nConnecticut's 6-foot-9 center is a shot-blocking machine, swatting away shots, altering others and intimidating nearly everybody who dares to take the ball near the Huskies' hoop.\n\nStanford hasn't encountered a player quite like Okafor this season. The fourth-seeded Cardinal need to find the right mix of when to attack and when to stay away from Okafor when they take on No. 5 Connecticut in the second round of the South Regional today.\n\n\"It's easy to say you're going to go inside and not worry about it,\" Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said. \"Okafor gets in people's heads. You see guys make extra fakes and shuffle their feet. That doesn't do anyone any good. You have to play your game.\"\n\nIn today's second game, 13th-seeded Tulsa (23-9) faces No. 5 Wisconsin (23-7) in the Midwest Regional.\n\nOkafor got BYU out of its game in the opening round. He blocked seven shots in the Huskies' 58-53 victor controlled the middle.\n\nBut the Cardinal (24-8) insist they won't shy away from taking the ball to the hoop against the Huskies (22-9).\n\n\"We have to attack him. He can't block all our shots,\" Stanford forward Josh Childress said. \"We have to go at him strong and hope to get fouls on him.\"\n\nWOMEN GER UNDER WAY: Four straight home victories will put Tennessee in the Final Four.\n\nThe top-seeded Lady Vols open the NCAA tournament today against No. 16 seed Alabama State at their very own Thompson-Boling Arena in Knoxville, right on campus.\n\nWin that, and the Vols play for a partisan crowd again.\n\nThe team's following two games in the Mideast Regional would also be in Knoxville, meaning they'd never have to leave the comfort of home until heading to Atlanta for the national semifinals.\n\n\"It doesn't get any more exciting than this,\" Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said. \"Our team started thinking about this last spring\" after losing to national champion Connecticut at the 2002 Final Four.\n\nUConn - the No. — seed in East - begins defending its title tomorrow, also at home, facing Boston University. It will be the Huskies' first game since their 70-game winning streak ended with a loss to Villanova in the Big East tournament final.\n\nThe top seed in the Midwest, Duke, also plays its first-round game tomorrow, against Georgia State. LSU, No. — in the West, plays Southwest Texas State at Eugene, Ore., today.\n\nSubregional hosts Colorado, Georgia, New Mexico, Old Dominion, Purdue and Stanford also play today, as the 64-team field begins the whittling process.\n\nTennessee (28-4), which lost to LSU in the Southeastern Conference tournament final, is bidding to win its seventh national title but first since 1998.\n\nTV RATINGS DOWN: With the nation's attention on the war in Iraq, TV ratings for the first evening of NCAA tournament coverage dropped more than 20 percent from last year.\n\nCBS Sports' broadcast at 7:15 p.m. Thursday night drew a 5.2 overnight rating, down 29 percent from 2002. The 9:45 p.m. game's overnight rating was 4.7, a 15 percent decrease."
