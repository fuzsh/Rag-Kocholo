        "text": "A professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Hornets play in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The franchise, originally known as the Bobcats, joined the NBA in 2004 as the league’s 30th franchise.\n\nThe team’s original owner was Robert L. Johnson, an American media mogul who became the first African American majority owner of a major professional sports team in the United States. Although the Bobcats featured talented young players such as Rookie of the Year center-forward Emeka Okafor and forward Gerald Wallace, the team was not an early success. It finished with a losing record and in last or second-to-last place in its division in each of its first five seasons in the NBA.\n\nIn 2006 basketball great Michael Jordan, a native of North Carolina, became minority owner and general manager of the team. In 2010 he took over majority ownership of the Bobcats. Charlotte finished the 2009–10 season with the first winning record in franchise history. The team made the play-offs for the first time but was eliminated in the first round. Over the next few seasons the Bobcats’ play declined steeply; in the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, the team won only 7 of its 66 games. The Bobcats rebuilt and bounced back in the 2013–14 season, posting a winning record and qualifying for the play-offs."
