        "text": "It’s no secret around the NBA the relationship between fans and the New Orleans Pelicans has been shaky at best. There is a lot of heartbreak involved. Time and time again, our hopes are built up and smashed by a combination of bad luck and bad decisions. For a lot of fans, they feel like […]\n\nThe last remaining Hornet from the Pre-Demps era and the first guy he acquired are gone. Rashard Lewis is soon to follow\n\nWe introduce a new piece called “Doing Dealer Dell.” Today we will assess a variety of things going around Dell’s head and around the league.\n\nWith each passing game that the margin between wins and losses widens, the reality that the Hornets aren’t under-performing sets in for me. Worse yet, Gordon’s return probably won’t fix anything considering the likely timing of it. Regardless, my spirits remain high.\n\nThis week our writers focus on whether or not Okafor is the best active Hornet, Ayon’s playing time, the Kaman situation, and Eric Gordon.\n\nEmeka Okafor and Monty Williams talk about the Hornets loss last night to Sacramento and how they can improve in the future, and also Gustavo Ayon’s development. Squeaky Johnson demonstrates a sweet piece of practice equipment. Plus, it’s autograph signing day at Hornets practice.\n\nMason looks beyond the simple box score stats to examine the strides that Emeka Okafor has taken towards improving his offensive ability in a season when his scoring is needed more than ever.\n\nThis week’s New Orleans Hornets Beat tackles Gordon’s knee, Okafor’s contract, trades, and ownership. Plus, The New Orleans Hornets announced today that they have picked up the option for the 2012-13 season for guards Xavier Henry and Greivis Vasquez.\n\nAnd… We’re Back!! It’s been a tough couple of months for Hornets fans, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. Gone are franchise cornerstones Chris Paul and David West and their patented pick and pop. Instead, the Hornets will rely less on star power and more on teamwork, toughness, and intensity. The […]\n\nWith the news that the lockout ended, I started getting back into looking at stats and whatnot from last year. One thing I noticed, which I’m guessing a lot of us probably suspected, is that Chris Paul didn’t bring his usual excellence to crunch time last season. His numbers were down drastically from the previous […]\n\nNew Orleans Hornets center Emeka Okafor is the 71st ranked NBA player, according to ESPNâ€™s team of basketball writers. ESPN recently asked every NBA writer they have at their disposal to rank every single NBA player in the game. Ryan and I both participated, and the results have been tallied and announced gradually both on […]\n\n(This is in the spirit of Holly MacKenzie’s very nice piece over at Hardwood Paroxysm, only I’m doing 36 things I miss because the Hornets have six players and there are six of them. Don’t you get it? It’s science.) It’s Thursday morning. Roughly 8am. I shouldn’t be awake yet. Last night as I sat […]\n\nPrior to his injury in February, many Hornets fans were arguing that Emeka Okafor was playing at an All-Star level. His numbers decreased dramatically after his injury (11.1 PPG, 10.1 RPG, 60% field goal vs. 8.7, 8.2, and 52%) and he had a horrible showing in the postseason against the Lakers. Because of that, some […]\n\nEvery team has a bench, and on that bench there may just be the next superstar . . . but it’s likely that the backup just hasn’t been exposed as not being worthÂ theÂ role ofÂ backup . . . As I sit here at Highland Coffees in Baton Rouge with my ladyfriend and the guy that chose […]\n\nThe facts about the proposal that the league made to the players last week have started to trickle out and surprisingly the owners are not going for the death blow that most experts assumed that they would try to deliver to the players. While NBAPA President Derek Fisher claimed that he was “disappointed” in the […]\n\nAs we all know, the 2010 Free-agency was the most-action packed free-agency in history. LeBron permanently destroyed his reputation to join Bosh and Wade in Miami. Carlos Boozer went to Chicago. Amar’e decided he had had enough sun and went to the Big Apple. We saw Teams overpay players drastically. (coughTorontocough) Then there’s the 2010 […]\n\nNow that the Hornets season is finally over, we can take a step back and really look at what a roller coaster ride it has been. Over the last 10 months or so everything has shifted; from the roster to the coaches. From the front office personnel to the owner. But perhaps even more important […]\n\nThe Hornets handled the Pacers without much issue tonight, handing out a 108-96 drubbing (Box Score) that was actually a twenty-five point lead before the Hornets scrubs came in and let the Pacers cut it to pieces.Â If I was a Hornets sub, I wouldn’t want to be near Monty’s office tonight.Â He looked royally […]\n\nThe Hornets lost to the Celtics 89-85 in a high energy affair that saw the previously red-hot Chris Paul miss every shot. David West and Marco Belinelli combined for 55 of the Hornets 85 points, but that wasnâ€™t enough to overcome a third quarter collapse and some interesting calls. Marco Belinelli took three of the […]"
