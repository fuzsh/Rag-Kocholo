Lucas and Nathan, the two best basketball players in Tree Hill, North Carolina, meet Okafor, the second overall selection in the 2004 NBA draft, who gives them advice on playing in the league.\n\nONE TREE HILL is having a sensational season. It is television's fastest-growing returning show and regularly ranks #1 in its time slot in The WB's core demographics of young women. The series also stars Hilarie Burton, Bethany Joy Lenz, Paul Johansson, Sophia Bush, Barbara Alyn Woods, Barry Corbin, Craig Sheffer and Moira Kelly.\n\nONE TREE HILL is from executive producer and show creator Mark Schwahn, executive producers Mike Tollin, Brian Robbins, Joe Davola and Mark Perry for Tollin/Robbins Productions and Warner Bros.
