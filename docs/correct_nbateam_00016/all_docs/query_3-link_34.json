        "text": "Forget the fact that he hasn't played in an NBA game in over three years. And forget that he's 33 years old and was forced to retire after suffering a herniated disc in his neck. Emeka Okafor — a former No. 2 overall pick (2004) and Rookie of the Year — wants to play in the NBA again.\n\n\"He's probably five or six months away (from returning),'' Okafor's agent Jeff Schwartz told ESPN. \"He's been working hard rehabbing. For some guys that means one thing. To Emeka, who understands his body as well or better than some trainers that have worked with him, it means something else. He's healthy. He feels great, but he's a perfectionist, and he wants everything to be right.''\n\nAlthough Okafor never quite reached All-Star status during his nine NBA seasons, he was a top-tier big man during his time with the Charlotte Bobcats and New Orleans Hornets, averaging double-doubles year after year. His last NBA stop was Washington (2012-13), where he averaged 9.7 points and 8.8 rebounds in 26.0 minutes with the Wizards.\n\nAccording the report from ESPN, when (or if) he's NBA ready, Okafor intends to join a team that is contending for a championship. Of those contenders, Golden State Warriors general manager Bob Myers said he had a \"conversation\" with Okafor earlier this summer and \"will monitor\" his progress."
