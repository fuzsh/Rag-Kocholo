        "text": "The Charlotte Bobcats and New Orleans Hornets finalized the trade involving their 26-year-old star centres on Tuesday.\n\nAs reported Monday, Charlotte sent Emeka Okafor, who fell into disfavour with head coach Larry Brown, to New Orleans for injury-prone Tyson Chandler.\n\nThe Bobcats wanted to divest themselves of Okafor's long-term contract, while the Hornets needed to unload Chandler's $11.8-million US salary to avoid luxury tax payments.\n\n\"Our intention this summer was to improve our team, and this trade is definitely a positive move in that direction,\" Hornets general manager Jeff Bower said. \"Emeka is one of the premier centres in the NBA, with all-star calibre scoring and rebounding averages throughout his career.\n\n\"His potential to improve is endless once you put him on the court running with Chris Paul.\"\n\nOkafor has averaged 14.0 points, 10.7 rebounds, 1.9 blocked shots and 34.0 minutes in 330 NBA appearances (326 starts) since he was drafted second overall by the Bobcats in 2004.\n\nCharlotte signed him to six-year, $72-million US contract last July 29, but Brown often questioned the fire in his belly.\n\n\"I wanted him to have a passion and work on his game,\" Brown said. \"I think he made unbelievable progress in that regard.\n\n\"When we had an exit meeting this past season, he told me he was going to do that. He was going to work on his game.\n\n\"This was a basketball decision. I had nothing to do with Emeka.\"\n\n\"Emeka is a great kid,\" Brown noted. \"But we all felt that, with the way Tyson plays — with his quickness and his ability to handle the ball and his length — that was something that was very important to us [and] that was the overriding factor.\"\n\n'Fills a need that we obviously have'\n\nAt seven-foot-two, Chandler is four inches taller than Okafor, but he is recovering from off-season surgery on his left toe.\n\nNew Orleans traded Chandler to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Feb. 17, but the transaction was rescinded because he failed a physical.\n\nChandler has averaged 8.2 points, 9.0 rebounds, 1.4 blocks and 28.0 minutes in 537 games (364 starts) since he was selected second overall out of high school by the Los Angeles Clippers in the 2001 NBA draft.\n\nLos Angeles promptly traded his negotiating rights and Brian Skinner to the Chicago Bulls for Elton Brand.\n\n\"We're getting a young kid who is long and athletic and can play multiple positions and fills a need that we obviously have,\" Brown said.\n\nChandler is slated to make $11.8 million US next season, plus he retains a $12.7-million US option for 2010-11."
