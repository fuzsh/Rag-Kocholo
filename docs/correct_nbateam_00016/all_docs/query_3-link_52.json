        "text": "UConn plans to honor the 2003-04 men's basketball national championship team prior to the contest against Xavier on Jan. 28 at the XL Center in Hartford.\n\nThe iconic team will be honored on the court and inducted into the Huskies of Honor in a special ceremony on the 20th year anniversary of their run.\n\nJim Calhoun led this squad to a 33-6 overall record and won the 2004 Big East Tournament before their NCAA NCAA championship. UConn achieved their second title by beating Georgia Tech 82-73 at the Alamodome in San Antonio. Since the Yellow Jackets defeated the Huskies in an early season game, UConn's national title win was also a form of revenge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe Huskies won their first four tournament games by an average of 17.5 points before besting Duke in a one-point contest in the Final Four.\n\nOf course for any team to win a title, the squad has to have some stars and UConn certainly had a few.\n\nHusky legend Emeka Okafor headlined this group and became the Big East Player of the Year and NABC National Defensive Player of the Year. The Final Four's MOP became the No. 2 overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nHis teammate Ben Gordon was selected one pick after Okafor, then Charlie Villanueva was drafted No. 7 overall in the 2005 NBA Draft. Hilton Armstrong was a lottery pick (No. 12) in the 2006 draft, while fellow Huskies Josh Boone and Marcus Williams would also have successful NBA careers.\n\nThe '04 UConn team will be the second full men's team to be inducted into the Huskies of Honor following the 1998-99 national champions who were also inducted on the 20th anniversary of their run."
