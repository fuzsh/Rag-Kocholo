        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nA dominant inside force, especially under the defensive glass. A premier rebounder and shot-blocker who's extremely active and powerful under the basket. Has a high motor and is a quiet leader. Doesn't make many mistakes with the ball. Lacks much of a shooting stroke (especially on free throws) and struggles to create his own shot effectively. Not much of a passer. Has been injury-prone and somewhat inconsistent throughout his career."
