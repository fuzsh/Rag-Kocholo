        "text": "Emeka Okafor was only supposed to be out until like December, but then he just disappeared. Thought we would be hearing something out him the next season but nada.\n\nBut earlier this week, Ben Standig of CSN Mid Atlantic wrote that Okafor will try to make a comeback for the first time since 2012-13.\n\nMan, the years go by fast. That was 3 seasons ago. And since Okafor was born on September 28, 1982 (age 33), he will be 34 before next season starts. Here's part of the piece:\n\nThe basic plan: Join a \"contending team\" in December or January as Okafor works on his conditioning. The 6-foot-10 center suffered a herniated disc in his neck while with the Wizards.\n\n\"He's probably five or six months away,'' Schwartz told MacMullan. \"He's been working hard rehabbing. For some guys that means one thing. To Emeka, who understands his body as well or better than some trainers that have worked with him, it means something else. He's healthy. He feels great, but he's a perfectionist, and he wants everything to be right.''\n\nGood thing the Wizards moved him when they did. They really made out on that deal for Marcin Gortat who has been a rock. Wizards gambled and did well on that deal.\n\nIt would be great to see him make a comeback. Hard to see it happening here but I will keep an eye on him to see where he might land.\n\nJordan Crawford\n\nhttp://www.rotoworld.com/player/nba/1742/jordan-crawford\n\nJordan Crawford is participating in the Pistons mini camp in the hopes of securing a roster spot.\n\nCrawford spent last season playing in China, where he led the CBA with an average of 43.1 points per game. \"I won player of the week as a point guard in Boston, so I don’t know about this two-guard thing you’re going to label me as,\"\n\nAfter getting traded by the Wizards, he went to Boston and then GSW.\n\nHere was his last NBA game with GSW. He score 41 pts in 41 mins on 16 for 28 shooting for a TS .650\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201404160DEN.html\n\nYou heard the man. He says he is a PG.\n\nVideo interview\n\nhttp://www.freep.com/story/sports/nba/pistons/2016/06/08/detroit-pistons-jordan-crawford/85603030/\n\nYi Jianlian\n\nFuture generations will look back, with a mix of awe and horror, on August 17, 2016, as the day when everything changed. Yi Jianlian is (almost) back, heading to the Lakers for a reported $8 million, one-year deal.\n\nhttps://theringer.com/yi-jianlian-los-angeles-lakers-nba-why-cbd8b2ff6ec6#.p09bqdfph\n\nYi hasn’t played in the NBA since 2012\n\nhttp://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-ln-yi--20160817-snap-story.html\n\nChris Singleton\n\nhttp://hardwoodparoxysm.com/2015/07/07/chris-singleton-nba-orlando-summer-league/\n\nVesely signed a two year deal with fenerbahce but has an out clause after one year.\n\nIt would be fun to see Okafor, Crawford and Singleton return."
