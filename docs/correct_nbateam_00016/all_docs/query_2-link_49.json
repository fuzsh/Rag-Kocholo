Better than Dwight. Obviously, I was wrong. He still is a good defensive player, but he's still a 6,10 center on a good day.Anybody know why his game hasn't progressed?",

        "text": "Emeka is what he is: a Poor Man’s Ben Wallace-in-his-prime.\n\nA lot of top 3 picks turn out far worse. Emeka was a very safe pick, and in that regard he has not disappointed. Most of us Charlotte fans miss him a lot this year.\n\nHe will never have great handles. It just isn’t within his ability. He is just not a fluid guy when it comes to offense.\n\nHow can you imply he needs to learn better rebounding? Have you checked his numbers????\n\nSee what I wrote to GregOden08 above. Not every number 1 or 2 pick becomes a star. Emeka is a high quality player.\n\nThe8thDeadlySin,\n\nI largely agree. Emeka needs to be around good scorers.\n\nOkafor has occasionally shown hints of a solid, catch-and-shoot 12-footer from the baseline. But I don’t think that it has quite “taken”. The less time with the ball in his hands on a scoring attempt, the better.\n\nSadly, Tyson Chandler makes Okafor look like Kevin McHale. The Bobcats have more success with Nazr Mohammed at Center. He at least has some half-decent offensive skills."
