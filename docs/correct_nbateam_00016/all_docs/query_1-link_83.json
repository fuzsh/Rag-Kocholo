        "text": "CHARLOTTE N.C. -- Emeka Okafor and Ben Gordon spent three years at Connecticut fighting over Pop Tarts juice boxes and other assorted sweets. Gordon had the goods and as his roommate Okafor believed he could help himself.\n\nThe battles between the two best friends didn't end when they moved on to the NBA -- Okafor as the No. 2 overall pick to the Charlotte Bobcats Gordon one selection later to the Chicago Bulls.\n\nWhen Okafor won his second rookie of the month award earlier this season he sent Gordon a text message that said \"2-to-1.\" Gordon who had just one rookie award replied by telling Okafor not to bother him until the Bobcats had a winning record.\n\n\"We might as well be married\" Okafor said of the feuding. \"All that time we spent together it's like brothers a sibling thing.\"\n\nTheir latest contest will continue until the final day of the NBA regular season Gordon and Okafor are in a neck-and-neck race for rookie of the year honors with opinions varying across the league as to who deserves the award.\n\nOrlando's Dwight Howard the No. — pick in the draft is expected to grab some votes. But most believe it will be a fight to the finish between Okafor the cornerstone of the expansion Bobcats and Gordon the sparkplug off Chicago's bench.\n\nLeBron James who won the award last year gives the edge to Gordon.\n\n\"I just think the impact that Ben has had on the Bulls and getting them to the playoffs for the first time since Michael Jordan retired is impressive\" James said. \"He's done it off the bench and he's so vital to that team. If I had a vote I'd pick him.\"\n\nOkafor heads into the weekend leading NBA rookies in scoring average (15.4) rebounding average (10.9) and minutes played per game (35.9) and is second in blocked shots per game (1.7).\n\nHe's also reached double figures in scoring and rebounding in 46 games. Elton Brand had 42 double-doubles when he tied Steve Francis for the rookie title in 2000.\n\nGordon is second among rookies in scoring at 15.1 per game. But he's scored at least 10 points in the fourth quarter a league-high 21 times this season including the 22-point flurry he scored last month to beat Okafor and the Bobcats.\n\nNow the two find themselves in the center of a raging debate between their coaches and the voters.\n\n\"Emeka has been pretty consistent but Ben is the only one leading the league in one essential stat -- double-digit fourth quarters\" said Chicago coach Scott Skiles. \"I suppose it's going to come down to Who have you seen play the most?\n\n\"I don't know how you could deny the way Ben has factored into a winning record. However Emeka didn't choose to go to an expansion team.\"\n\nCharlotte coach Bernie Bickerstaff doesn't think the voting should even be close because he says playing on an expansion team with a shaky supporting cast makes Okafor's numbers more impressive than what Gordon has done for a playoff-bound team.\n\n\"Emeka had to be thrown into the fire. The consensus going into the year was we would be lucky to win nine games and he has had a lot to do with it\" Bickerstaff said of his Bobcats who had 17 wins heading into this weekend. \"But this thing is supposed to be based on individual performance isn't it? I vote for Emeka.\"\n\nThe Bobcats are trying to get Okafor the award with a catchy \"Got Mek?\" campaign blitz. All eligible voters were sent imitation milk cartons listing Okafor's stats and reasons to pick him for the award.\n\nIt also poked fun at Okafor's competition with the phrase \"No Bull no Magic just Mek.\"\n\nThe Bulls meanwhile sent voters a lunchbox that promoted all four of their current rookies and didn't single out Gordon. The campaign called \"Bulls Fource\" included a DVD T-shirt and brochures detailing each player's season.\n\nOkafor has tried to downplay the personal importance of winning the award the past few weeks. But as he hits the homestretch he's finally willing to reveal his desire to take the trophy away from Gordon.\n\n\"I want it\" he emphatically said after his 17 points and 11 rebounds in Wednesday night's victory over Atlanta assured the Bobcats of not ending the season with the worst record in the NBA.\n\n\"Every rookie wants it but there's only so much I can do. You guys try to make it seem like Ben and I are on the phone every night talking 'Hey man you're gonna get it.' It's not like that. If he gets it I'll be happy for him and if I get it he'll be happy for me. But I'm competitive so if I don't get it I will be disappointed.\"\n\nLast month Gordon was making his case for why he should earn the award. These days he is focusing more on the Bulls than one-upping Okafor.\n\n\"At this point in the season I'm more concerned about how I can help my team advance and get a better position in the playoffs\" he said. \"So that's the last thing I'm really thinking about. I'm just really focused on us playing our best basketball going into the playoffs.\"\n\nThis story appeared on Page C8 of The Standard-Times on April 17 2005."
