        "text": "There’s no debate when it comes to Emeka Okafor and Jameer Nelson. They’re unanimous All-Americans.\n\nThe leaders of Connecticut and Saint Joseph’s topped the Associated Press men’s college basketball All-America team Tuesday, the first time since 1985 more than one player was chosen by every voter.\n\n“It is hard to express just what it means to be recognized as one of the best players in the country,” Okafor said. “Individual recognition like this is really a reflection of the great teammates and coaches that I am fortunate to work with every day.”\n\nOkafor, a 6-foot-10 junior center, and Nelson, a 5-11 senior guard, earned a perfect 360 points by being picked on all 72 first-team ballots by the same media panel that votes on the weekly poll.\n\nEach member selected three All-America teams, with players receiving points on a 5-3-1 basis.\n\nKansas University junior Wayne Simien was a third-team selection.\n\nLawrence Roberts of Mississippi State was third with 308 points, while Josh Childress of Stanford had 235. Ryan Gomes of Providence completed the first team with 208.\n\nIn 1985, four players were unanimous choices: Patrick Ewing of Georgetown, Chris Mullin of St. John’s, Wayman Tisdale of Oklahoma and Keith Lee of Memphis State. But only 10 people voted then.\n\n“This is obviously a testament to both players to be unanimous selections,” Saint Joseph’s coach Phil Martelli said. “That is a lot of respect to be shown, and in neither case was it about hype. These two deserved it.”\n\nNelson, the Atlantic 10 player of the year, led the Hawks to a 27-0 record and No. 1 ranking before they lost to Xavier in the quarterfinals of the conference tournament. It was the longest such run since UNLV entered the 1991 NCAA tournament undefeated.\n\nNelson is the first All-American for Saint Joseph’s, and he leaves as the school’s career scoring leader with more than 2,000 points. He averaged 20.6 points, 5.0 assists and 4.6 rebounds, while shooting 49 percent from the field, 39 percent on three-pointers, and 80 percent on free throws.\n\nHe and Delonte West were considered the best backcourt in the nation, and their defense was praised as much as their offense.\n\nNelson is “the greatest player to ever wear a Saint Joe’s uniform,” Martelli said.\n\nOkafor collected a hat trick of awards in the Big East. He was the player of the year, defensive player of the year, and the league’s scholar-athlete for the second year in a row.\n\nHe averaged 18.1 points, 11.7 rebounds and a nation-leading 4.3 blocked shots while shooting 60 percent from the field. Okafor, who will graduate in May, missed three games, including two in the Big East tournament, with back spasms related to a small stress fracture.\n\n“He’s does so many things that don’t appear on a stat sheet,” Huskies coach Jim Calhoun said. “With his defensive presence, he changes the game more than any player in college basketball.\n\n“Both Jameer’s and Emeka’s teams are in the Sweet 16, and they have won 59 games between them already. Obviously, Jameer’s the best guard in America, and Emeka’s the best big guy in America. They are the two best players in America, and this is a terrific honor for both kids.”\n\nFrom 1986-03, there was a total of only seven unanimous selections: Walter Berry of St. John’s (1986), David Robinson of Navy (1987), Christian Laettner of Duke (1992), Glenn Robinson of Purdue (1994), Tim Duncan of Wake Forest (1997), Elton Brand of Duke (1999), and Jason Williams of Duke (2002).\n\nOkafor, Connecticut’s first All-American since Richard Hamilton in 1999, and Nelson are the only players on the first team still in the NCAA Tournament. Mississippi State and Stanford lost in the second round; Providence was ousted in the first round.\n\nRoberts, a 6-9 junior who received 49 first-team votes, was the Southeastern Conference’s player and newcomer of the year. He transferred this fall from Baylor after that program’s problems, which included the murder of a teammate.\n\nMississippi State won its first SEC regular-season title since 1991, and Roberts averaged 17.1 points and 10.2 rebounds. He is Mississippi State’s first All-American since Bailey Howell in 1959.\n\nChildress, the Pac-10 player of the year and Stanford’s first All-American since Casey Jacobson in 2001, missed the first nine games of the season while recovering from a stress fracture in his left foot. The 6-8 junior swingman averaged 15.8 points and 7.5 rebounds, helping the Cardinal get to 26-0 before losing their last game before the conference tournament. He had 34 first-team votes.\n\nGomes, a 6-7 junior forward, joined Okafor as a unanimous all-Big East selection after averaging 18.6 points and 9.3 rebounds. He is the Friars’ first All-American since Marvin Barnes in 1974. He had 24 first-team votes.\n\nOkafor and Nelson were on the preseason AP All-America team, along with Ike Diogu of Arizona State (an honorable mention pick Tuesday), Rickey Paulding of Missouri, and Raymond Felton of North Carolina."
