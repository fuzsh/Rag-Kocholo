        "text": "One player who might have been a possibility was former Detroit forward Josh Smith, who was released by the Pistons and signed with Houston this week. Miami could consider current free agents Jermaine O’Neal and Emeka Okafor if they still want to play, and Andrei Kirilenko might become available if he continues refusing to report to Philadelphia. Andray Blatche, 27, would be worth a look, but he currently is playing in China and will not be able to return to the NBA until March.\n\nThe Mavs are among the teams that have kept tabs on Emeka Okafor, who last played in 2012-13, as he recovered from a herniated disk in his neck. He plans a midseason return, and Stein reported this summer that nearly half the league had registered interest.\n\nLast I heard, a number of teams had reached out to Okafor’s camp to express interest but it sounds like he won’t be available for another few weeks since he’s reportedly still dealing with some neck issues. He could be someone that joins a team after the start of the season.\n\nThe list of pursuers for the defensive-minded center, according to NBA front office sources, includes LeBron James’ Cleveland Cavaliers as well as LeBron’s old friends in Miami. But I’m likewise told that Okafor is unlikely to sign anywhere until midseason as he continues to recover from his herniated disk. Said one source: “He’ll be in high demand when he’s back.”"
