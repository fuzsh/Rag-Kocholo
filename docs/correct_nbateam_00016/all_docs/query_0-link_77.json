        "text": "Mild-mannered Emeka Okafor rarely raises his voice. Yet there was the Charlotte Bobcats big man in December, pounding his fist into his palm in a heated exchange with coach Sam Vincent at the end of practice.\n\nThree months later, Okafor asked for a meeting with Vincent after his playing time diminished.\n\nShortly after Vincent's rocky first year ended with a disappointing 32-50 record, Bobcats managing partner Michael Jordan fired the rookie coach and replaced him with Hall of Famer Larry Brown.\n\nThe move might be the reason why Okafor was sitting at a podium in front of a Bobcats' banner Tuesday, a week after he agreed to a six-year, $72 million deal to remain in Charlotte.\n\n\"When the Bobcats hired him, it showed me they were committed to making the franchise better,\" Okafor said without directly answering whether he'd have re-signed if Vincent was still in charge. \"Hiring Larry Brown, an elite coach, you have to take notice of that.\"\n\nOkafor was full of energy as he discussed the prospects for playing for the 67-year-old Brown, who is beginning his record ninth NBA head coaching job.\n\n\"Larry Brown, he brings a certain dynamic and insight to the game that would make most teams better,\" Okafor said. \"I think he's a perfect fit for us. Our team is young. We are hard working and he can give us that discipline and those little insights to the game that will take us to the next level.\"\n\nThe 6-foot-10 Okafor was the expansion team's first draft pick in 2004.\n\nFOURTH STOP: Kwame Brown hopes to be the latest player to resurrect his career with the Detroit Pistons.\n\nThe Washington Wizards drafted the 6-foot-11 center No. 1 overall out of high school in 2001, but he was tagged as an underperformer early in his NBA career, and he has played for three teams in seven seasons, averaging just 7.5 points and 5.7 rebounds.\n\n\"The past is the past,\" Brown said during a conference call Tuesday. \"I'm not going to disrespect my new teammates or my organization by making excuses. I have a chance to write a new legacy for myself.\"\n\nPistons president of basketball operations Joe Dumars has built a perennial contender with key players cast off by other teams, most notably Chauncey Billups, Rasheed Wallace, Ben Wallace and Antonio McDyess."
