        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Pondering whether a close loss in their NBA debut was a moral victory for the expansion Charlotte Bobcats, Emeka Okafor did his best cheerleader impersonation.\n\n\"I guess you see those movies where everyone is like, 'Yeah! At least you guys were in there!' \" he said, arms in the air and mock glee in his voice. \"I guess I'd rather lose the way we did then get blown out.\n\n\"But I want to win.\"\n\nThat might take awhile.\n\nThe Bobcats marked the NBA's return to Charlotte after a two-year absence with an entertaining and hard-fought 103-96 loss to the Washington Wizards on Thursday night.\n\n\"We showed our stuff. We showed we're going to fight and play hard and try to win every night,\" said Okafor, the No. 2 pick in the NBA draft.\n\nReplacing the Hornets after they moved to New Orleans in 2002, the Bobcats are expected to struggle mightily this season.\n\nStill, they were in this one late as they tried to become the third consecutive expansion team to win its NBA debut, following Vancouver and Toronto (1995).\n\nThe effort impressed Washington.\n\n\"They played really hard and have a lot of key components -- it was kind of hard to call them an expansion team,\" said Antawn Jamison, who led the Wizards with 24 points. \"They've got some talented guys ... they will get a lot of upsets.\"\n\nCharlotte coach Bernie Bickerstaff seemed disappointed.\n\n\"We weren't good enough tonight,\" he said. \"It wasn't because we lacked or didn't want it. Some of them may have wanted it too bad. I don't know whether any of them had stage fright.\"\n\nActually, it was just poor execution in the final quarter, when youth and inexperience were obvious.\n\nThe game was tied at 85 when turnovers and poor shot selection allowed the Wizards to go on a game-deciding 9-0 run.\n\nMelvin Ely lost the ball while dribbling, and Eddie House foolishly fouled Juan Dixon as he made a Washington layup. It was a three-point swing after Dixon's free throw, and the Bobcats appeared to unravel after that.\n\nHouse missed a 3-pointer and Steve Smith missed consecutive shots as the Wizards built a 94-85 lead with 4:14 to play.\n\nCharlotte still had chances, sending Tamar Slay to the line trailing 96-90, but Slay missed both free throws and the Bobcats couldn't make a basket after Okafor battled for the rebound.\n\n\"They made shots and we didn't,\" House said. \"That will come. I think we did all right for a group that hasn't been together very long.\"\n\nUnlike the Hornets' first game in 1988, when they received a standing ovation after a 40-point loss, most of the sellout crowd of 23,319 was long gone by the end. Even NBA commissioner David Stern filed out before the final buzzer. It left one seemingly drunk fan standing alone, clapping loudly as he shouted, \"OK, Bobcats, you rule!\"\n\nGilbert Arenas added 19 points for the Wizards, Jarvis Hayes had 17, Dixon 15 and Larry Hughes scored 14.\n\nOkafor led Charlotte with 19 points and 10 rebounds. Primoz Brezec and Smith scored 15 each, Gerald Wallace had 11 and Jason Kapono and Ely had 10 apiece.\n\nNot everything went smoothly during the opener.\n\nThe sound system in the aging Charlotte Coliseum -- where the Bobcats will play this year as their new $265 million arena is being finished -- wasn't sharp, making team owner Bob Johnson's pregame speech to the crowd difficult to hear.\n\nTraffic outside the Coliseum was backed up three hours before the game, preventing thousands of fans from arriving in time for the 7 p.m. tipoff. When four fans holding courtside tickets finally made it in midway through the first quarter, they claimed Johnson and rapper Nelly were sitting in their seats.\n\nAnd some things were the same as always, like the rousing cheers reserved for pro wrestler Ric Flair, a beloved Charlottean.\n\nNotes: Nelly, an investor in the Bobcats, seemed the logical choice to either sing the national anthem or perform at halftime. He did neither. Instead, his songs played over the loudspeaker during breaks as he sat courtside next to Johnson. ... Jamison, a Charlotte native, typically has a large contingent of family and friends in the stands, but requested only 20 tickets for the opener. ... Smith and Brevin Knight, the only veterans on Charlotte's team, were unanimously elected team captains following the morning shootaround."
