Okafor is joined by Jason Gardner of Arizona, Kirk Hinrich of Kansas, Josh Howard of Wake Forest and Brandin Knight of Pittsburgh in rounding out the Wooden All-American squad.\n\nOkafor is the fifth Husky to earn Wooden All-America status in the past ten years, joining Donyell Marshall (1994), Ray Allen (1995 &amp; 1996), Richard Hamilton (1998 &amp; 1999) and Caron Butler (2002).\n\nOkafor leads the country with 4.7 blocked shots per contest this season and he is currently No. 7 in the nation in rebounding at 11.2 per contest.
