        "text": "A long distance ago, while studying at UCONN during the 04 title run, I routinely thrust myself upon campus big man Emeka Okafor. Eating alone? Not for long. Walking somewhere? A 5'7\" sidekick emerged. I grilled him as to who his favorite player was - Bill Russell. How he felt about entering the pros - \"It's going to be fun.\" I made sure Emeka knew that out of 14 million teams on the worldwide web, I held a top 100 fantasy team. He seemed genuinely interested in my lineup: \"Man, that sounds solid, how'd you get all those players?\" Clearly we were equally talented, albeit in different ways and with different pays.\n\nHe was picked 2nd in the NBA draft by the pencil-thin Charlotte Bobcat expansion team. Early in his rookie year, he recognized me in the crowd at a Celtics game. I was sure that autograph I pilfered from him would be of value as he ascended to Bill Russell status with his new team. Didn't happen. While Okafor's stats were adequate, the wins didn't come and before long he was a journeyman center for the Hornets and Wizards. His 9 year career ended in 2013, seeing no titles and no all star appearances. Nor that did that of Ben Gordon, a good scorer who failed to make a pro roster in 2015. Yet the lesser of these UCONN talents was Charlie Villanueva, who still plays in Dallas as of 2016. How is this? My opinions:\n\n1. Villanueva had a more unique skillset as a 3 point shooting big.\n\n2. He made a great first impression in the league with that 48 point game early on.\n\n3. He benefits from lower mileage on his body as a reserve player.\n\n4. He may have had more love for the game. A rumor is that Bobcats personnel believed Okafor did not have a great desire to play the game every day.\n\nNow for the Linked-In sell: I'm the Chuck Villanueva on your company's roster. I'm well-rested and hungry from being undervalued in the proverbial draft, I have a unique skillset with a desire to be there and make things work. Alumnus unite, network amongst the thousands, give Ed Alberts that \"one shining moment\" of net-cutting glory (or in my case, 30k-earning human services glory or anything else that pays a borderline living wage). Before I take my talents to Canada or something. Please.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBoy I can't wait for all the responses I'll get with these 2200 connections. I remember a line about the WNBA from the show Family Guy... \"What does the fan say?\" And they show one fan. Come on Linked-Out, prove you are more useful than Josh Boone at the foul line. If you want more great content for readers like you, at least throw a Like my way."
