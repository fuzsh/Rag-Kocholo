        "text": "Rocky Widner/Getty Images\n\nFeeling recovered from the neck injury that kept him away from the court for three years, Emeka Okafor is looking to return to the NBA.\n\nContinue for updates.\n\nOkafor Prefers to Sign with a Contender\n\nMonday, Aug. 8\n\nOn Monday, ESPN.com's Jackie MacMullan reported Okafor is working out in hopes of making a comeback. It could be a while until the free-agent center is in position to make his comeback, though.\n\nNoting the big man wants to join \"a contending team,\" his agent, Jeff Schwartz, told MacMullan that Okafor still has a long way to go:\n\nHe's probably five or six months away. He's been working hard rehabbing. For some guys that means one thing. To Emeka, who understands his body as well or better than some trainers that have worked with him, it means something else. He's healthy. He feels great, but he's a perfectionist, and he wants everything to be right.\n\nThe 33-year-old last played for the Washington Wizards in 2012-13. In 79 games, he averaged 9.7 points, 8.8 rebounds and one block per contest.\n\nIn September 2013, doctors discovered Okafor had a herniated C4 cervical disk in his neck, and he hasn't stepped onto an NBA court since. Despite his lengthy layoff, Okafor could be in demand for playoff contenders down the road.\n\nOver his nine-year NBA career, Okafor has averaged 1.9 blocks per 36 minutes, per Basketball-Reference.com. According to NBA.com, the Wizards were one point better defensively per 100 possessions with Okafor on the court.\n\nHe's unlikely to find a new home before the start of the 2016-17 regular season. Especially if he's six months away from a possible return, a team is unlikely to take the risk of signing him now.\n\nConsidering both his age and time away from the league, his value as a rim-protector has dwindled. In the middle of the season, though, Okafor—assuming he's healthy—could be a strong addition to a team looking to bolster its frontcourt depth."
