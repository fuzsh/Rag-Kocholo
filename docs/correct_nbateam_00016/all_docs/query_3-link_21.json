        "text": "When Emeka Okafor boarded the team bus following UConn's 76-67\n\nwin over Georgia Tech in the national championship game on April\n\n5, the first thing he wanted to know was where his video camera\n\nwas. All eyes had been fixed on the Huskies' elegant 6'9\" center\n\nsince the season began in November, yet in his finest hour all\n\nOkafor wanted to do was look around and appreciate the view. That\n\nsuch humility would emanate from a superstar was not lost on\n\nUConn coach Jim Calhoun. \"He's the epitome of what we want in\n\ncollege athletics,\" Calhoun says. \"I don't think you're going to\n\nsee the likes of Emeka Okafor come around for a long, long time.\"\n\nOkafor's three-year career at Connecticut (he will forgo his\n\nsenior season and enter the NBA draft) is worth remembering, but\n\nhis junior year was unforgettable. Despite being saddled with a\n\nstress fracture in his back for much of the year, Okafor averaged\n\n17.6 points, 11.6 rebounds and 4.1 blocks per game. He was at his\n\nbest when it mattered the most, scoring all of his game-high 18\n\npoints in the second half of UConn's comeback win over Duke in\n\nthe national semifinals and finishing with 24 points and 15\n\nrebounds against the Yellow Jackets in the championship game.\n\nThose accomplishments alone would make Okafor worthy of being\n\nnamed SI's Player of the Year, but of course there is one more.\n\nOkafor carries a 3.76 GPA, and next month he will receive his\n\ndegree in finance, having earned it in just three years.\n\nOkafor's performance on the season's final weekend elevated him\n\njust enough in a tight, two-way race with Jameer Nelson, Saint\n\nJoseph's sensational senior point guard. Nelson's statistics and\n\naccomplishments this season were impressive: He led the Hawks\n\n(30-2) to the first undefeated regular season by any team since\n\n1990-91, by averaging 20.6 points and 5.3 assists per game. But\n\nno player did more for his team on both ends of the floor than\n\nOkafor. One of the the Huskies' biggest weaknesses was their\n\nperimeter defense, but with Okafor manning the paint, UConn led\n\nthe nation in field-goal-percentage defense (.369).\n\nAs an interior presence who demanded constant attention, Okafor\n\nenabled his freshman frontcourtmates, Josh Boone and Charlie\n\nVillanueva, to prosper inside while ensuring that sharp-shooters\n\nlike Rashad Anderson and Ben Gordon got clean looks on the\n\nperimeter. Okafor's selflessness inspired a team-first culture\n\nthat helped the Huskies win the Big East tournament despite his\n\nmissing three games with back pain and stay close with Duke while\n\nhe sat on the bench for most of the first half because of foul\n\ntrouble.\n\n\"To be at the point I am right now is just crazy to me,\" Okafor\n\nsaid during the Final Four. \"Sometimes I'm like, Wow, I'm lucky.\"\n\nCollege basketball is equally lucky to have had a player like\n\nhim.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: DAVID E. KLUTHO Okafor put Georgia Tech away in the final with 24 points and 15 rebounds."
