(Charlotte, North Carolina-AP) Jan. 14, 2005 - Charlotte Bobcats forward Emeka Okafor is telling students that books and not athletics opened the door to the NBA for him.

Okafor talked to about 300 high school students at a screening of the movie "Coach Carter." He says his success is based on taking his education seriously.

He told the students his academic skills attracted college coaches who said they could improve his basketball skills. Okafor was the Number Two overall pick in the NBA draft. He graduated in three years from Connecticut with a 3.8 grade point average in finance.

The Bobcats hosted the invitation-only screening of "Coach Carter." The movie is based on real-life basketball coach Ken Carter, who benched his entire team when they didn't meet his academic standards.

Okafor has pledged $10,000 to help tsunami victims in southeast Asia and eastern Africa. Okafor says he's giving the money to the relief organization UNICEF.
