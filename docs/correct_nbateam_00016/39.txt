NBA[]

On April 16, 2004, Emeka declared for the 2004 NBA Draft, which meant forgoing his senior year in college. He managed to receive his undergraduate degree in Accounting/Finance in three academic years. During the draft, Okafor was selected with the 2nd overall pick by the Charlotte Bobcats; the 2nd pick was originally owned by the Los Angeles Clippers. He was the first pick for the Bobcats because this draft was the Bobcats first official draft.

Charlotte Bobcats (2004-09)[]

The 2004–05 NBA season was a successful campaign as Okafor coped well with the pressures of being the star rookie on an expansion franchise. Highlights of the season included recording 19 straight double-doubles from November 21 through January 1, and finishing seventh among Eastern Conference forwards in NBA All-Star Game fan balloting with 408,082 votes, by far the highest number garnered by any rookie in 2005.

On June 24, 2005, the Bobcats picked up the option for the fourth year on Okafor's contract, as he has quickly established himself as the face of the franchise, and a solid player for years to come. Okafor finished his rookie season with 44.7% field goal percentage and per-game averages of 15.1 points, 10.9 rebounds (ranked 4th in the league), and 1.7 blocks.
