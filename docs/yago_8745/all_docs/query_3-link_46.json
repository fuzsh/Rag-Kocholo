        "text": "This weekend found me watching two movies that couldn’t be less alike. Their only commonality is their running time – excessive.\n\nI’ll take on the newest first, Deadpool and Wolverine. Its reviews were all over the map. Michael Phillips gave it a scathing pan and a single star. The gist of his column was that this flic embodies exactly what is killing decent, modestly budgeted films – bloated, mindless slogs through non-stop violence aimed at teenage boys.\n\nThe Times, and my friend, Tom, were much kinder. The Times gave it a full four stars, and Tom found it laugh out loud funny, as did his fellow audience of teenage boys.\n\nI doubt I’d have gone to see it, but my friend, Tim, was eager to do so, and I’m always eager for his company, so I put on my Captain America t-shirt, and off we went. My reaction was closer to Phillips’, though I’d give it another half star. I like Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, and I found the first Deadpool movie amusing, but this one is a long, hollow shell encrusted with satire and snarky irony. Instead of a plot, you get an endless series of battles to the death between two characters who cannot die, and hundreds of their foes who can. Since the principals are immortal, their clawings and stabbings at each other are impossible to care about. What kept me awake were the occasional flashes of wit, and the odd sword flying at me in 3D IMAX. Ah well, I’d watch worse to spend time with Tim.\n\nThe other picture was The Green Years, from 1946. My mother took me to see it at the Avalon when it came out. I was eleven and didn’t like it much. I came away thinking it was way too long, and there was a scene that upset me greatly. Someone gets his leg caught in a railroad track as a locomotive bears down on him – never a favorite plot point of mine.\n\nWhat I was too callow to appreciate then was what a festival of strong supporting actors it contained. Turner offered it last week, and this time I couldn’t stop watching it. It’s from a best seller by A. J. Cronin who had a string of them made into movies in the 30’s and 40’s, including Hatter’s Castle, The Citadel, and Keys of the Kingdom.\n\nThe Green Years is basically a soap opera, but the screenplay preserves many of the novel’s tasty situations and turns of phrase. This time around, I noticed it was by Robert Ardrey. I was a college classmate of his seriously handsome son, Ross. But I digress.\n\nVictor Saville is a decent director, (and who can do anything with Tom Drake?), but for me, the real credit for the success of the picture must go to the casting director, Benny Thau. He drew on a small army of solid supporting actors, cast many of them against type, let them out for a run from their usual confines, and they reward him handsomely.\n\nThau was at MGM forever. He outlasted Louis B. Mayer, Dory Shary, and just about everyone else on the lot. He worked with Garbo. He worked with Elvis. Actors loved him, and he loved them back. His casting couch was notorious, and his mistresses are said to have included Greer Garson.\n\nFor the young lead in the first half of “Green,” Thau chose Dean Stockwell. Stockwell never played cute as did. say, Jackie Cooper. He had an adult’s acting chops right from the start. His scenes with Gladys Cooper are a believable joy because of his restraint. Unfortunately, at the midpoint, he grows up to be that bland cypher, Tom Drake.\n\nWith that exception, (since they were at the studio, better to have gotten some charisma and gone with Robert Walker or Van Johnson), Thau cast every role smartly, and for maximum effect. Gladys Cooper is a treat in an earthy part, far from her usual imperious patricians. Just watch her, stripping off petticoat after petticoat to find the material that becomes the boy’s ghastly green flowered suit. And watch Stockwell’s eyes and hands as they lie together in the dark, and she disabuses him of his grandfather’s legends. They work magic together.\n\nRichard Haydn too gets let off his usual leash of prissy sissy to play perhaps the best part he was ever given, the disillusioned but caring schoolmaster. He seems grateful to behave on screen like an actual adult from this planet. Sadly, the next year it would be back to the rote mincing snippery in Sitting Pretty.\n\nSelena Royle gets a chance to shine, as does Jessica Tandy, especially in the chocolate box scene,, and Hume Cronyn does well as a penny pincher straight out of Dickens.\n\nThe star of the proceedings is not the young man beset by adversity, but his mellow, drunken grandfather. For once in his career, Charles Coburn is given a lead and he makes the most of it. I’m glad Thau didn’t go with Charles Laughton, or Cecil Kellaway, who had already portrayed such characters. Coburn’s specialty was wittily acid patriarchs, and it’s a gratifying surprise to see him get down and dirty. For this he was nominated but for a supporting Oscar, despite having more screen time than anyone, and being the character who holds the story together.\n\nLike Deadpool and Wolverine, it goes on too long, but the adult me found much to enjoy in The Green Years.\n\nIt’s been a good while since I’ve written here. Nothing in my placid life seemed to justify a blog. What follows, then, is a meandering miscellany intended to keep my hand in.\n\nThere was, of course, our political roller coaster, about which I have plenty to say, but nothing that hasn’t been said already, many times over. It was certainly a popular topic on Facebook. One fellow posted so much vitriol that at last I had to unfriend him. He was a student of John’s, so I hated to do it, (to say nothing of how it feeds my vanity to have a large number of friends), but each day, his snide mockery of people I respect made me feel bad. He had to go.\n\nLosing a virtual friend was compensated by gaining two actual friends, neighbors who stopped to admire the garden and stayed to chat. Possessed of wit and charm, they encouraged me to drop in for a glass of wine. I knew they were serious the next day when a bottle of good wine and a sweet note appeared at my door. It seems this geezer still has it.\n\nThen there was the exasperating ending of this season on Professor T. The writers killed off my favorite character, played by the beauteous and talented Emma Naomi. It’s such a cliche to have the grim reaper nip an endearing romance in the pre-nuptial bud. This is becoming a predictable and unwelcome staple of detective series.\n\nEmma Naomi\n\nI was so annoyed that I felt like writing the station to vent my displeasure. What a treat it had been to look at Naomi’s pretty and expressive features. Her eyes and slight smile conveyed that she knew what you were up to but didn’t especially mind.\n\nEmma Naomi is just the sort of girl I had crushes on all the way through college. Yes, I had straight crushes until I finally sorted out the life I actually had to live.\n\nShe’s still there to be savored in Bridgerton where again she’s my favorite character. I heartily wish her the fulfilling career she deserves. Let’s get that slyly seductive face up on the big screen.\n\nOne of my very favorite films has always been Carnival in Flanders or, in the original French, La Kermisse Heroique. Thanks to a striking poster, I now know the Swedes called it Hertigen onskar Natikvarten.\n\n“Carnival” is beautifully acted, especially by its illustrious lead, Francoise Rosay, wife of the gifted director, Jacques Feyder. It is also brilliantly designed by Lazare Meersen whose sets echo many fine old Flemish paintings. Full justice is done to these clever sets by the shrewd cinematography of Harry Stradling who, after a number of films with Feyder, had great success in America, culminating, to my mind, in his powerful work on A Streetcar Named Desire.\n\nI mention these contributors to the whole because each brings a sensibility that sharpens the enjoyment of this delicious movie. I must note one more, the costume designer, Georges Benda. His cunning outfits, particularly for the women, are both apt and amusing.\n\nOnce, as I was leaving England, I found a DVD of “Carnival.” I snapped it up, but back in the states, I discovered it could only be played in Europe. Fudge.\n\nI had to have the poster when it was offered at auction, but what came turned out to be too big for my changeable frame, unlike previous Swedish posters, which I love for their graphics. I thought I’d just store it away and take it out to admire from time to time, but gradually I decided it deserved a frame of its own, despite my lack of wall space.\n\nI went with Lois to Michael’s, where we have great confidence in the woman who heads the framing department. The poster excited her, and she offered a number of suggestions, some, of course, more costly than the poster itself. I pondered the lot until Lois gave her usual sensible advice, “Which will bring you joy?” Naturally, it was the most expensive of them all.\n\nA week or so later, Tim, renowned in the region for his expert hanging of anything, went with me to pick up both that frame and a much smaller one of a piece of sheet music for “It’s Magic,” the one song I’d like my friends to play after I’m gone. Ann knew how much I liked it, and imported it from London.\n\nMagical Doris.\n\nThe girl who waited on us looked at my name and said, “Did you teach at Washington High?” I did. She grew quite animated and said, “I didn’t have you, but my best friend did. He still talks about how much he loved your class. He bought your book! Do you mind if I take your picture? He’ll be so excited.” I didn’t mind; in fact, it made my day.\n\nOnce home, I helped Tim move some tables and bric-a-brac away from the wall where the poster would hang, and what should we discover but a small dead mouse. Hmmm.\n\nI’d been afraid that the large frame would overwhelm the space, and I hated to lose any of the desert scene on the walls. By positioning it off to the side and nestled by a palm tree, Tim found the perfect spot for it. It looks as though it always belonged there.\n\nWelcome to my lair, “Hertigen.” By any name, you have a place in my home and my heart.\n\nIf the course of true love never did run smooth, it is particularly perilous in two movies I saw this weekend. Both were worth watching.\n\nOn the spur of the moment, Darlene and I decided to go see The Fall Guy because of its leads, Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt. My hopes of seeing Gosling shirtless were met soon and often. The film is an ode to stunt men, and demands so prolonged and strenuous a suspension of disbelief, that it’s best not even to try. One example may give you the idea. Gosling expertly steers a power boat through a hail of bullets, facing away from the wheel with his hands tied behind him.\n\nIt’s like that throughout, so I just sat back and gave in to the nuttiness. The picture works because A) the stunts are ingeniously entertaining, and B) the core of the film is a compelling romance between a couple whose chemistry made it impossible for me not to root for them. This wacky opus is securely grounded by what goes on, even unspoken, between Blunt and Gosling. It’s in the eyes. The plot is non-stop frantic mayhem, but they make it work so well that your questions just evaporate.\n\nOn the other hand, The Hit Man is a model of logical plotting, loosely based on actual events. The premise is a natural. A nerdy philosophy teacher is moonlighting for the police who value his technical expertise. They attempt to forestall murders by using a cop as a fake hit man. One night, a snafu leads the police to pressure our timid hero (deliciously played by Glen Powell), to step in for the errant and unavailable cop. Released from being himself, he proves so resourceful and effective that his successes outstrip his predecessor. Any possible improbability is overcome by a realistic screenplay and smart dialogue.\n\nSo far so good, but what Hit Man has in common with Fall Guy is its engaging love story, played by an ultra charismatic Powell and Adria Arjona. She tries to hire him to rid her of an abusive husband, and Powell, instantly smitten, dissuades her, much to the annoyance of the police who, listening on a wire, hoped to entrap her.\n\nGlen Powell and Adria Arjona\n\nGary, Powell’s character, adopts a different look and manner for each potential client, researching what type of hit man would most entice and convince each new potential perp (with most amusing results). This time, his sexy commanding “Ron” proves so alluring that they melt into a very steamy affair. Then her husband is killed. You aren’t sure who’s responsible, and you don’t really care. The suspense of the final scenes had me on the edge of my rocker. Powell is quite a find. He’s so good here that his future as a leading man seems assured.\n\nBoth of these films happily rewarded me with characters to care about and actors to ensure that I did.\n\nBecause I have kept every playbill from every play, concert, and recital I’ve ever attended, I can tell you exactly when it started, (July of 1955, when my dad took me to the Blackstone to see John Forsythe in Teahouse of the August Moon), and when it stopped, (December 16 of 2018, when I went with Ann and Tim to see A Midsummer Night’s Dream at Chicago Shakespeare).\n\nSince then, thanks to the pandemic, nothing – nothing until last night when George invited Lois and me to see a revival of Angel Street at a small but enterprising local theater, Beatniks.\n\nThe “Angel Street” playbill.\n\nWhat a treat to start a new envelope in which to nestle the playbill. Six years is an eternity away from one of life’s great pleasures. George is a good friend, and I’d have accompanied him to see almost anything – well, maybe not Cats. Angel Street was the American title of Patrick Hamilton‘s thriller, Gaslight. In 1938, it ran for six months in London. On Broadway, in 1941, it ran for three years and launched the careers of Vincent Price and Judith Evelyn as the ill fated couple.\n\nBeatniks seats fifty, cozily and comfortably. While we waited to enter, a fellow about my age sat down at a piano in the lobby and dashed off a dramatic version of “Body and Soul.” I moved to the piano and told him it was my favorite song and he’d done well by it. He seemed surprised that anyone would remember it. He tried to stump me with song after song, but I knew them all. “You know what you need?,” I said, “a tip jar.”\n\nThere are no bad seats, though the best leg room is in the front row, where you are practically onstage. They’d done well with the set, and the costumes were apt. This was opening night, so a few lines were flubbed, but on the whole, it was quite a decent effort. Kaylie Phillips made a pert, pretty, and saucy maid of Nancy, and Sandy Stotts was especially good as a much more loyal servant. Rip Johnson, who created Beatniks, made a merry meal of the detective, as Leo G. Carroll must have eighty three years ago.\n\nThe leads were enjoyable, particularly in their most intense confrontations, and my only note, had I been directing, would have been to the actress playing Mrs. Manningham. I’d have told her not to rush, but to slow down and savor her lines, especially her final speech to her husband, toward which the whole play has been building. It’s a gem, for which the audience has been waiting, and she should not be afraid to milk it a bit.\n\nThe program acknowledged George and his stepdaughter as donors. His late wife, Karen, was fond of the company, which had taken pains to accommodate her as she became less mobile.\n\nBeatnicks is an amateur troupe, but an agreeable one that takes pride in its work. They entertained me and never embarrassed themselves. It was grand to be back in a theater.\n\nMany of my dreams are about getting lost – really quite a lot of them. Last night, for a while, that’s where I thought my dream was headed, but then it swerved into something lovely that I was grateful to be dreaming.\n\nJohn and I were attending a fund raising function for the restoration of the Paramount theater, in Hammond, Indiana, where John had once taken me to see Fame, one of the last films shown there before it closed. He shared my love of those old palaces, and we were happy at the prospect of the Paramount rising again.\n\nThis dream had something going for it that I particularly liked. John was not just a silent observer as he had been in so many dreams before. No, in this one, he was more of a presence, actually talking to me.\n\nThe presentation ended, and we filed out onto the street to wait for our ride. In the dream, this was Greg, my masseur, who seemed to have forgotten us. I tried to call him, but John spotted people he knew, and crossed the street to chat with them. He came back to tell me they would drive us home. He was smiling and in a very good mood.\n\nWell, my dreams are never without plot complications, and I realized I’d left my back prop in the theater. I’ve had back issues for fifty years, and this prop is not something I dared leave behind. I used to lug around an attaché case filled with several heavy books to support my back in soft or iffy chairs. In time, the ever resourceful Mickey measured the angle of my back and used balsam wood to create a much lighter and more manageable prop for me. In any case, my forgetfulness meant that everyone would have to wait while I went back to retrieve it.\n\nMy back prop.\n\nHere’s where my dreams normally go really south. The theater was deserted now, and the main entrance was closed. I had to walk around the building in hopes of finding another way in. I was able to push open a door, but immediately found myself stumbling over a maze of construction. I managed to get back into the auditorium, but by this time, I was worried about how annoyed John might be.\n\nJust then,he was at my side. He had followed me in, not wanting me to get lost. He took my arm and smiled at me with a look of deep affection and amused forbearance. I felt safe, and loved, and I knew everything would be alright. For once, I was sorry to wake up.\n\nJohn and I stopped at a gas station on our way to work. I filled the tank, but took too long to pay. That was my first mistake – the first of many that day. John was impatient, because of his graduation day responsibilities, and drove off, leaving me with the bicycle. Why was it even in the car? Well, cycling to work was to be my punishment for dawdling.\n\nA mist of rain made the streets slippery and dangerous. The bike was old and stiff to pedal. I don’t know why we kept it (For emergencies, I suppose, though it was almost an emergency in itself). As I crossed a vast, six way intersection, pedaling and sweating, I thought, “If only this were one of my stupid dreams, Then I could wake up and be done with it.” But this was real life, so on I pedaled.\n\nTeachers’ aides had set up a buffet table in the lunchroom. I spied a few nibbles of interest, including a plate of salmon slices. I chose a few, and took up the large salt shaker, but the lid came loose and spilled a mountain of salt, rendering all the salmon (except mine) inedible. Nearby faculty members glared at me, and a business teacher called out, “You jerk!” The day was not improving. As I scurried away, again I thought, “If only this were a dream, I could wake up and none of this would have happened,” but no, this was real.\n\nI headed off to the graduation site with a friend. The air had turned cool, and the wind was up. I’d brought two jackets, and lent one to my friend. Now I realized that in my hurry to get away from the debacle at the buffet, I’d left the other jacket in the lunchroom. My obliging friend tried to hand me his, but I grabbed at it awkwardly, and a strong gust carried it off down the street.\n\nMy clumsiness was costing me. I began to shiver. What a stupid day, and what a stupid me. Too bad this was reality, and not a dream from which I could awaken. At least, I’d worn two shirts, though they were short sleeved, and I’d neglected to button the outer one which suddenly blew off. Now I’d be ill dressed at the graduation, antagonizing students and parents alike.\n\nWould this wretched day never end, and before it did, how many more missteps and humiliations lay ahead? If only . . . but this was real life.\n\nAnd then I woke up.\n\nI recently attended a memorial service where a pastor assured the assembled mourners that, unless we had said aloud “I accept Jesus as my savior,” we were doomed to the fires of Hell. He was serious, (though wildly inappropriate), but I couldn’t take him so. I’m an optimist, always have been and hope to remain one. That said, 2024 is testing me sorely. It’s only Spring, but already I’ve lost two close friends, and a cherished cousin. Another friend of long standing has been given just six months to live, and a confidant of over six decades is losing the ability to retrieve words.\n\nThese people are and were witnesses to my life. As they leave, they take with them a mental record of what it meant to be me. Their loss pushes me to ponder my own mortality. How many years, days, moments do I have left? What part of my body will falter and betray me?\n\nUnhelpful thoughts, to be sure, but here I am, the remains of a marriage – a happy marriage, left to steer this awkward tandem of a life single-handedly. How I miss us. I miss who I was with John, with all of them.\n\nBut – on that other hand, it is Spring. All around me is renewal, and my world turns a vivid green. Ample rains and unaccustomed warmth conjure early arrivals of tulips, lilacs, daffodils, azaleas, and crab trees robed in pink and white.\n\nLast evening, with sunlight to spare for hours, Luke came by to pot the treasures Lois and I found at Elzinga’s nursery: lush, bushy begonias of deep red, fiery orange, yellow, salmon and apricot; midnight purple petunias with paint spatters of white, robust geraniums of red, white and violet; purple and scarlet fuschia; giant orange marigolds, and an indigo Martha Washington geranium with all its petals lined in icy white.\n\nAn example of what keeps me centered in a time of loss.\n\nEvery side of my house is in bloom, making it difficult to entertain dark images of mortality. I’ll deal with them next winter. Thank God for Spring!\n\nThe Chicago Symphony is a jewel in the city’s crown. Founded one hundred and thirty five years ago, it is the equal of any orchestra in the world. That is not merely hometown boosterism, as any music critic will attest.\n\nSince its beginning, only ten men have been its principal conductor. Theodore Thomas held the baton for sixteen years, beginning in 1889. His successor, Frederick Stock, led the symphony for the next thirty-seven years, a record run. During World War II, Belgian refugee Desire Defauw took charge. I can’t speak to the talents of these first three maestros, never having heard their work, even in recordings.\n\nIt is through recordings only that I know (and admire) the next two leaders, Artur Rodzinski and Raphael Kubelik. Each held the position only briefly.\n\nWith the arrival of the incomparable Fritz Reiner in 1953, I was old enough to attend concerts and judge first hand the fire and burnished steel that Reiner wrought from the orchestra. I have his entire output with the CSO on vinyl and CD. What a magnificent legacy! In his hands, the group became a world class organization.\n\nJean Martinon, in my opinion, cooled things down considerably. Under him, from 1963 to 1968, there was feathery sweetness, for much of the French repertoire, but where was the implacable power for which the orchestra had become known in the Reiner decade?\n\nNext was Georg Solti, and for twenty-two years, beginning in 1969, the ship was righted again. Concerts, tours, and recordings shimmered with renewed excitement. I was in the audience more frequently now, leaping to my feet with pride and admiration.\n\nDaniel Barenboim took over for fifteen years when Solti retired in 1991. I admired Barenboim more as a soloist than as a conductor.\n\nThen, in 2010, we were lucky enough to secure Riccardo Muti for thirteen beautiful years. It was an era of gorgeous sound, but he did not suffer fools or distraction gladly. He could silence an audience with a withering glance. We loved our Muti, and so did the orchestra, especially when he stood with them on a picket line during a strike.\n\nNow there is to be an eleventh conductor, Klaus Makela from Finland. I’ve done my best to research him and, after watching numerous video interviews, I’m impressed and encouraged. Makela is only twenty-eight, but he displays the wisdom and experience of a much older man. He speaks knowingly and excitedly about the needs and missions of an orchestra, and the crucial bond of trust between players and conductor.\n\nKlaus Makela photo © Marco Borggreve / Oslo Philharmonic\n\nHis demeanor is warm, informal, and charismatic. It’s beside the musical point that he’s also a hunk, but how will it hurt to have such a handsome gent on the podium? Klaus is unmarried, but scarcely a monk, judging by the withdrawal from a recent concert by a female pianist with whom he had been in a relationship. Ah well, unless you’re like Bogie and Bacall, workplace romance is seldom a good idea.\n\nMakela seems likely to do what he can to reach out to a young audience, and commission new works. At the same time, he waxes eloquently and reverently over the classical canon.\n\nTo sample his approach, I’m listening to his recordings of all seven of Sibelius’ symphonies. My father knew I loved Sibelius, and on Christmas in 1962, (Yes, my long term memory is still intact), he delighted me with the gift of all seven, conducted by Akeo Watanabe with the Japan Philharmonic. I practically wore it out. I haven’t heard that set in many years (It languishes in the basement with a boatload of vinyl albums), so I can’t really compare the two interpretations. What I can report is the color, and clarity, and passionate precision that Makela brings to his countryman’s masterworks.\n\nI wish Klaus the best. I hope he settles in and sticks around at least as long as I do.\n\nJust this week, Hagar the Horrible deliberately came late so he could miss some of the opera. Dustin‘s father complained about having to go to Swan Lake. It happens all too often in the comic strips, the stereotype of the philistine husband, the culture hating spouse – as though it were part of being a real man.\n\nDustin’s father reviews Swan Lake.\n\nI used to think, why don’t they just let the music wash over them and enjoy it. But no. that would be gay, something still taboo in the funny papers – better to resist all culture and fall asleep. Well, this week, you could call me Phil, for even though unintentionally, I did just that, and I was joined by the husband of a friend. We were real men – the philistines.\n\nThe music did indeed wash over us – and put us to sleep. Perhaps in my case, it was the hearty meal of tender lamb shank I’d enjoyed at Rivers. More likely, it was what they played, not an opera but Mozart’s Requiem. Without a fat lady to rouse me, I surrendered to the somnolent solemnity of sound, and closed my eyes.\n\nI understand why Lyric does this. They used to put on a season of eight operas, but since the pandemic, they’ve cut back to seven, and one of the evenings is no longer an opera but something more economical, requiring no sets or costumes. I understand, but I wish they wouldn’t. In the time left to me, I want to see as many operas as I can.\n\nAt intermission, my friend, Mike, confided that he too found the requiem the perfect music for napping and had dozed off. In any case, it filled Lyric’s coffers. The place was sold out. I didn’t see an empty seat, and extra chairs were crammed into every box.\n\nAh well, I’m assuming my slumbers were a one time aberration. You can tell Helga that whenever Hagar plays truant, I’ll be happy to warm his seat."
