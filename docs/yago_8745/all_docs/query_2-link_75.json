        "text": "Hyphenation for 'francoise'\n\nShowing how to split the syllables of 'francoise'.\n\nSyllabification or syllabication is the separation of a word into syllables, whether spoken or written. The written separation is usually marked by a hyphen when using English orthography (e.g., syl-la-ble) and with a period when transcribing in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). For presentation purposes, typographers may use an interpunct, or a special-purpose \"hyphenation point\".\n\nAt the end of a line, a word is separated in writing into parts conventionally called \"syllables\" if it does not fit and if moving it to the next line would make the first line much shorter than the others. This can be a particular problem with very long words. Word processing has automated the process of justification, making syllabification of shorter words often superfluous.\n\nFrançoise (French: [fʁɑ̃swaz]) is a French feminine given name (equivalent to the English Frances or Italian Francesca) and may refer to:Anne Françoise Elizabeth Lange (1772–1816), French actress Claudine Françoise Mignot (1624–1711), French adventuress Françoise Adnet (1924-2014), French figurative painter Françoise Ardré (1931-2010), French phycologist and marine scientist Françoise Arnoul (1931–2021), French actress Françoise Atlan (born 1964), Moroccan singer Françoise Balibar (born 1941), French physicist and science historian Françoise Ballet-Blu (born 1964), French politician Françoise Barré-Sinoussi (born 1947), virologist and Nobel Prize winner Françoise Basseporte (1701–1780), French painter Françoise Bertaut de Motteville (c. 1621–1689), French memoir writer Françoise Beaucournu-Saguez (1936–2000), French entomologist Françoise Bertin (1925-2014), French actress Françoise Boivin (born 1960), Canadian politician Françoise Bonnet (born 1957), French long-distance runner Françoise Bourdin (1952–2022), French novelist Françoise Briand (born 1951), French politician Francoise Brun-Cottan (born 1944), French-American voice actor Françoise Castex (born 1956), French politician Françoise Chandernagor (born 1945), French writer Françoise Claustre (1937–2006), French archaeologist Françoise d'Amboise (1427–1485), Carmelite nun Françoise d'Aubigné, marquise de Maintenon (1635–1719), morganatic second wife of Louis XIV of France Françoise d'Eaubonne (1920–2005), French feminist Françoise de Graffigny (1695–1758), French writer Françoise David (born 1948), Knight of the National Order of Quebec Françoise de Cezelli (1558–1615), French chevalier and war hero Françoise de Foix (c. 1495–1537), mistress of Francis I of France Françoise Dior (1932–1993), French neo-Nazi Françoise Dolto (1908–1988), French doctor and psychoanalyst Françoise Dorin (1928–2018), French actor, comedian, novelist, playwright and songwriter Françoise Dorléac (1942–1967), popular French actress Françoise Dubois (born 1947), French politician Françoise Ducros, Canadian civil servant Françoise Dunand (born 1934), French Egyptologist and archaeologist Françoise Dupuy (1925–2022), French dancer and choreographer Françoise Dürr (born 1942), former tennis player Françoise Faucher (born 1929), French film actress Françoise Foning (1949–2015), Cameroonian businessperson and politician Françoise Forton (1957–2022), Brazilian actress Françoise Gilot (1921–2023), French born painter Françoise Giroud (1916–2003), French journalist, screenwriter, writer and politician Françoise Grossetête (born 1946), French politician Françoise Hardy (1944–2024), French singer, actress and astrologer Françoise Héritier (1933-2017), French anthropologist Françoise Lebrun, French actress Françoise Macchi (born 1951), French former alpine skier Françoise Mallet-Joris (1930-2016), Belgian writer Françoise Matraire (19th century), printer Françoise Mbango Etone (born 1976), track and field athlete Françoise Meltzer (born 1947), professor of religion Françoise Mouly (born 1955), Paris-born French artist and designer Françoise Prévost (c. 1680–1741), French ballerina Françoise Robertson, actress Françoise Rosay (1891–1974), French actress Françoise Sagan (1935–2004), French playwright, novelist and screenwriter Françoise Thom (born 1951), French historian and Sovietologist Françoise Yip (born 1972), Canadian actress Ghislaine Marie Françoise Dommanget (1900–1991), French actress Jeanne Françoise Julie Adélaïde Récamier (1777–1849), French socialite Louise Françoise Contat (1760–1813), French actress Marie Françoise Sophie Gay (1776–1852), French author"
