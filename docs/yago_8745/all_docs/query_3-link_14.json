        "meta_description": "French postcard, early 1930s.\n\t\n\t<b>Françoise Rosay</b> (1891 - 1974) was the grand old lady of French cinema. Her most famous parts were in <i>La kermesse heroïque</i> and <i>Pension Mimosas</i>, both by her husband Jacques Feyder. \n\t\n\tFrançoise Rosay was born in Paris as the illegitimate daughter of the actress Marie-Thérèse Chauvin, aka Sylviac, and count François Louis Bandy de Nalèche. Her father only recognized her in 1938. At the Paris Conservatory Rosay completed her theatre training with Paul Monet. In 1908 she had her stage debut at Théâtre-Libre and played on various stages hereafter. Her first screen performance Rosay had in 1911 in an adaptation of Falstaff by Henri Desfontaines, but few films followed in the next years, including a bit part in Les Vampires (1916). The tide radically changed when she married film director Jacques Feyder in 1917. Three years after her eldest son Marc was born; Paul and Bernard would follow. From 1921 to 1941 Rosay played in almost all important films by Feyder; in the late 1910s she had already played in various shorts by him. In Gribiche (Feyder 1926), a touching melodrama, she probaby had her first lead as a rich American woman who adopts a Parisian working class boy (Jean Forest). Next followed the Franco-German coproduction Le bateau de verre (Constantin David, Jacqueline Milliet 1927) with André Nox and Eric Barclay, Madame Recamier (Tony Lekain, Gaston Ravel 1928), and the comedy Les deux timides (René Clair). \n\t\n\tIn the late 1920s-early 1930s the Feyder-Rosay family resided in Hollywood, where Feyder shot The Kiss (1929) and the German version of Anna Christie (1931) with Garbo, and Daybreak (1931) and Son of India (1931) with Ramon Novarro. Rosay played Marceline Day’s mother in the orientalist romance The One Woman Idea (Berthold Viertel 1929). When sound set in, Rosay played in various French and German versions of American films by MGM and Paramount, intended for the European market. These included the French versions of Let Us Be Gay (Soyons gais,  Arthur Robison 1930), The Trial of Mary Dugan (Le procès de Mary Dugan (Marcel de Sano 1930), and His Glorious Night (Si l’empereur savait ça, Feyder 1930). She also had a part in the German and the French version of the Buster Keaton sound comedy Parlor, Bedroom and Bath, called Casanova wider Willen (Edward Brophy 1931) and Buster se marie (Claude Autant-Lara, Edward Brophy 1931). At Paramount Rosay played in the mélo The Magnificent Lie (Berthold Viertel 1931), in which she was a French actress who becomes the idol of a blinded soldier (Ralph Bellamy), who is tricked in believing that a saucy music-hall singer (Ruth Chatterton) is the actress. Other French versions of American films were La chance (René Guissart 1931) starring Marie Bell, Jenny Lind (Arthur Robison 1932) starring Grace Moore, and Quand on est belle (Robison 1932) with Damita again.     \n\t\n\tReturned to France, Rosay had an intense career in French cinema of the 1930s. She was princess Marie in La femme en homme/The Woman Dressed as a Man (Augusto Genina 1931), Madame Edwige in Le petit café (Ludwig Berger 1931), and the Queen in Echèc au roi (Léon d’Usseau, Henri de la Falaise 1931). She was Madame Husson in the Maupassant adaptation Le Rosier de Madame Husson (Dominique Bernard-Deschamps 1932), followed by Coralie et Cie (Alberto Cavalcanti 1933), La pouponnière (Jean Boyer 1933), Tout pour rien (René Pujol 1933), L’abbé Constantin (Jean-Paul Paulin 1933) and Vers l’abîme (Hanns Steinhoff, Serge Véber 1934).  She also played in the German version of Vers l’abîme: Die Insel (Steinhoff 1934).  In 1934 Rosay had a small part as bar owner in Feyder’s Le grand jeu, starring Marie Bell and Pierre-Richard Willm. In 1935 followed Marie des angoisses (Michel Bernheim), Marchand d’amour (Edmond T. Gréville), Le billet de mille (Marc Didier), and Rémous (Greville). \n\t\n\tIn 1935 Rosay played perhaps her most famous part, that of the clever wife of a Flemish mayor, whose city is invaded by the Spanish army. In Feyder’s film La kermesse heroïque/Carnival in Flanders, all local men cowardly hide, while the women stay, conquer the foreigners with their wit and charm and eventually make them go away. Right wing nationalists in Holland, Flanders and elsewhere were not very happy with the film. Rosay also played in the German version, Die klugen Frauen (1936). Immediately after this film Rosay played another memorable part, that of the pension keeper Louise Noblet in the contemporary drama Pension Mimosas (Feyder 1936). Louise and her man foster a boy whose father is in prison. Once grown up, the boy has became as delinquent as his father was, but Louise still helps him until affairs run out of hand. In 1936 Rosay had the title role in Marcel Carné’s film Jenny, typical for the poetic realism in French cinema of the late 1930s. Rosay plays a madam who doesn’t want her daughter to know. Until the war Rosay prolonged her highly active career: Le secret de Polichinelle (André Berthomieu 1937), The Robber Symphony (Friedrich Feher 1937), Un carnet de bal (Julien Duvivier 1937), Le fauteuil 47 (Fernand Rivers 1937), Drôle de drame (Carné 1937), Ramuntcho (René Barberis 1937), Les gens du voyage (Feyder 1938) and Feyders German version Fahrendes Volk, Le ruisseau (Maurice Lehmann 1938), Le joueur d’échecs (Jean Dréville 1938), Serge Panine (Charles Méré, Paul Schiller 1938), Elles étaient douze femmes (Georges Lacombe 1940), and Paix sur le Rhin (Jean Choux 1940). Next to Fahrendes Volk Rosay also played in three other German films: Die letzten Vier von Santa Cruz (Werner Kingler), shot at the Canarian Islands, Mein Sohn, der Herr Minister (Veit Harlan 1937), and Die Hochzeitsreise (Karl Ritter 1939). Striking is that Rosay played her most famous parts not in her twenties (as often happened in Hollywood), but in her forties, contradicting the cliché about the lack of interesting parts for older actresses.\n\t\n\tDuring the German occupation of France, Rosay first worked for the resistance while still acting, then had a narrows escape when the Germans invaded the south in 1942. She rejoined her husband in Switzerland, where Rosay taught at the Conservatory of Geneva and worked for an antifascist radio station. Her French comeback was in 1946 with the female lead in Feyder’s criminal drama Macadam. It would be their last professional collaboration; Feyder died in 1948. She was devastated but continued working. Until her death Françoise Rosay continued to have leads but also smaller parts in French, Italian, British and American films, such as Saraband for Dead Lovers (Basil Dearden 1948), Donne senza nome (Geza von Radvanyi 1950), September Affair (William Dieterle 1950), Maria Chapdelaine (Marc Allégret 1950), L’auberge rouge (Claude Autant-Lara 1951), La reine Margot (Dréville 1954), Interlude (Douglas Sirk 1957), Die Gans von Sedan (Helmut Käutner 1959), etc. In 1969 Françoise Rosay, regarded the grand old lady of French cinema, was awarded a lifetime award as best actress, the Etoile du Crystal. Her memoirs were published as La traversée d'une vie in 1974. The same year Rosay died at Montgeron, at the age of 82, after a career of sixty years.\n\t\n\tSources: German and French Wikipedia, CinéArtistes and IMDB.",
