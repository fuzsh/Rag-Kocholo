        "text": "TB: This week we are going to cover SEPTEMBER AFFAIR (1950), a Paramount production that features two of David Selznick’s top performers– Joseph Cotten and Joan Fontaine. This is the third and final film we’re discussing as part of our “impossible love” theme. In some ways it is like INTERMEZZO, since again we are dealing with a musician in Europe; and again, we have a single woman falling for a married man. Feelings are reciprocated, and the affair is more frankly presented, despite the production code being enforced.\n\nJL: SEPTEMBER AFFAIR has more of a story than INTERMEZZO, with the longer running time developing it more substantially, even if it is less innovative and stylish. However, I do consider INTERMEZZO the superior production, but what works against INTERMEZZO a bit is the condensation of events.\n\nTB: Yes, totally agree. INTERMEZZO has no substantial subplots, no padding and the events are not at all drawn out…which works against it a bit. Mainly because it’s so condensed and “efficient” that it doesn’t allow us to linger on the characters or other parallel concerns in the periphery. Probably because Selznick was anxious to make Bergman a Hollywood star, so the focus has to be on her almost exclusively. But with something like SEPTEMBER AFFAIR and its longer running time, we are treated to a more luxurious story, with all the trimmings.\n\nTB: What do you think about Walter Huston’s participation in this film? He doesn’t appear on screen, but we hear him.\n\nJL: I had heard Walter Huston’s 1938 recording of “September Song” many times, being a frequent CD track of mine. It was a song that made my grandmother cry although most modern listeners may find it icky. The main titles of SEPTEMBER AFFAIR feature just the melody, but then the entire song is heard later as a 78 rpm that our two stars, Joan Fontaine’s Manina and Joseph Cotten’s David, listen to at a Naples restaurant. We hear lyrics like “those precious days I spend with you” which signal that nothing lasts forever.\n\nTB: Because of this film, Huston’s recording became a hit again. Interestingly, Huston died in April 1950, and this film did not receive its premiere in Italy until August. It would not reach American screens until early 1951.\n\nJL: I believe SEPTEMBER AFFAIR had been filmed in the autumn of 1949, over a year after the modest but critical success of Fontaine’s previous romance drama, LETTER FROM AN UNKNOWN WOMAN. We can compare both films, as well as compare SEPTEMBER AFFAIR along with Audrey Hepburn’s ROMAN HOLIDAY (with its Italian scenery especially), the combo of LOVE AFFAIR and AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER (in certain parts but not as a whole), DODSWORTH (with a non-singing Walter Huston tinkering with playful projects in Italy like Cotten’s David here) and, of course, David Lean’s duo of SUMMERTIME (i.e. the man is married and the lady a spinster who fears she is over the hill). Yes, I did feel a little déjà vu watching this.\n\nTB: Yet, it works so well. Cotten is not a traditional leading man but the relaxed, unforced chemistry between Cotten and Fontaine works to the story’s advantage. We start to believe that they are finding comfort in knowing each other, avoiding the troubles of their previous lives– her life as a much-in-demand pianist; and his life with a wife back home (Jessica Tandy) that he may no longer love. In addition to the chemistry between the leads, we have all this wonderful Italian ambience that takes us into a whole new realm with them.\n\nJL: A little note on Charles B. Lang and Victor Milner’s cinematography, a key selling point. There is an interesting shot early on with our love birds in Naples that reminds me of the key reason some of these scenic films were shot in black & white. You can just barely, very barely, tell that they are in a studio setting against a back-screen scenery view which, in color, would have been way too obvious.\n\nThanks to all of the pleasing gray tones, it blends in nicely with the actual you-are-there shots interspersed that moviegoers at the time would have just assumed it was all shot in Italy rather than Hollywood. This is also why the Technicolor ROAD TO BALI is so disappointing in comparison to the monochromatic ROAD TO RIO because you are more convinced that Hope and Crosby are traveling internationally in the earlier film rather than between Paramount studio interior “tropics.”\n\nTB: True. We should point out, however, that much of SEPTEMBER AFFAIR is filmed outdoors. So while might have been California substituting as Rome, we are led to believe this is a much more “realistic” drama. Plus the editor cuts to on-location shots whenever possible, which also creates more authenticity in terms of the setting.\n\nJL: We later see the center of Florence in travelogue fashion, followed by Robert Arthur and Jessica Tandy’s characters arriving by cab with familiar Florence buildings in the background. The second shot is actually a studio one with rear projection, but the mastery of the editor (I am assuming Warren Low and/or his assistant) in matching these together is absolutely brilliant that only we avid movie buffs can catch the difference.\n\nTB: Let’s discuss the more romantic elements of the plot. This is what I would call an upper class soap opera. Did the basic love story work for you, as it did in INTERMEZZO, or did you find it all a bit contrived? I did like the fact that the plane they missed had crashed, so they had this perfect opportunity to just disappear together and live that forbidden life together, if for only a little while. With all their previous cares and responsibilities pushed to the side. Again, it works for me, due to the easy rapport of Fontaine and Cotten, whom I feel genuinely liked working together on this movie.\n\nJL: Honestly, it took me a while to warm up to these two stars together even though I like each of them individually. Joan Fontaine gave some excellent performances in her career, even though I hate to admit that I always favored sister Olivia de Havilland over her in the acting skills and kinda wish Fontaine pursued writing and some other career like Jackie Collins, sister of that Joan. She operates at her very best when up against sinister characters, as in REBECCA with Judith Anderson and the equally unhinged Lawrence Olivier, so that she must prove herself and we the viewers root for her to succeed. Yet when the co-star isn’t giving her much challenge, like Joseph Cotten here, she isn’t quite as exciting to watch.\n\nJL: There is a certain Saturnian persistence to many of Fontaine’s characters, eager to climb the mountain at all costs, that needs to be tapped into. I absolutely love the scene of her playing piano in the concert hall with great passion and emotion (regardless if she is any good at piano playing off screen) but less so many of her scenes with Cotten…and I feel very guilty in this because romantic movies are all about you wanting the couple to be together regardless whether or not “they were meant to be.”\n\nTB: Interesting. I agree that the concert hall scenes are very well staged and they are a highlight of the film. Ironic, given that some of these scenes mean she is separated from her new lover and back to her life as an independent-minded artist. However, there’s an important scene earlier in the film where she does play for him. So that later, when they are separated, we might infer she is still “playing for him.”\n\nJL: Sometimes certain relationships on screen are ones that we are only supposed to support half-way rather than all of the way. Maybe that was the point of William Dieterle’s direction? One important scene that happens early in the characters’ relationship involves them laying in their swimsuits. Joan closes her eyes when kissing him and, while she may have been thinking about somebody else when he kissed her, the way she does it suggests a woman who wants to cherish this very moment like some precious image in a necklace locket.\n\nJL: Cotten fiddles with her hair (a very touching moment) but only fleetingly glances at her when he does it and this suggests he is too distracted. Then she herself abruptly jumps up to have a swim, a move that totally ruins the initial effect she was achieving of wanting the cherished moment to last.\n\nTB: So did you buy the plane crash twist? Or did you feel it was too far-fetched?\n\nJL: The plot twist is a novel idea that isn’t tried often enough in rom-coms: prolong your time together because of a newspaper story suggests that the two of you died in a plane crash, thus giving you the option of either starting up a “second” life or at least getting more time to be together before the truth is revealed.\n\nYou may not get away with it as easily today in this modern age of instant communications as back then, especially with our leads both pretending to be “dead” in America while still managing to purchase a Florence villa together. Yet this film doesn’t ignore the improbabilities and this is why Françoise Rosay’s role as a piano teacher Maria Salvatini is so very important. She not only aids their deception with an important bank transfer but keeps reminding them that this deception won’t last long.\n\nTB: And of course, it doesn’t last. It can’t really last, because of the production code. But also because these are fundamentally decent people. So they may want to escape their pasts, but ultimately they have to return to their former lives to feel a sense of completion.\n\nJL: The 5th of September, David’s son David’s birthday and the day or two before they visit Michelangelo’s David, is an important turning point in the story. Manina sports her glasses that attract him even more to her. It also indicates to both of them that they must now “focus their sights” on the practicality of continuing a second life built of romantic deceptions when the first life has yet to be settled. When David and Manina meet up with a slightly drunk younger American soldier (Jimmy Lydon) at a cafe, David gives him romantic advice that “you can’t be in love with two women at the same time”, which prompts an interesting reaction from Manina that impacts her decisions later.\n\nTB: Yes. This is a very simple, but very powerful scene. The casual viewer may not realize this will signal a change in Manina’s attitude, but of course, it does. Let’s discuss David’s wife a bit since she plays an important role in his life, even if she is largely backgrounded in the narrative.\n\nJL: You get a sense that David’s wife Catherine, played by Jessica Tandy, still loves him despite saying she doesn’t after 18 years of marriage. She tells her lawyer “I should have given him his freedom” (and it is the greatest act of love to set one free rather than in bondage). Intriguingly she already knows about her husband being seen with Manina in Italy before his “death,” even if she gets the face mistaken at first and doesn’t recognize the real woman upon their first meeting. David Junior (Robert Arthur) is also involved and, when he learns his father is still alive, initially says he wishes his father was dead.\n\nTB: The son is not exactly pleased that his father “survived” the plane crash. And that is a sort of family drama that isn’t fully explored, but we get a sense of their relationship.\n\nJL: After these two visit Florence and Manina, after Maria initially puts on a charade for them, the storyline starts to stretch a bit. Yet this is Hollywood fluff and I accept it according without too much nitpicking. I also understand better why Cotten plays David in such an easily distracted manner because it is important that David not learn the truth of his family’s visit too early. The romantic couple are roughly the same age but Manina is the one who acts older and wiser. David is still a fifty year old “boy” tinkering with his engineering stuff, even in his sketch book during their final plane voyage back to the states.\n\nWas Catherine’s observation about him drifting in regards to the romance in their marriage or just a preoccupation with his career? (David Senior reminds me a bit of Robert Ryan’s George Leslie in ABOUT MRS. LESLIE also being more “married” to his career than either his wife or Shirley Booth, his home away from home romantic partner.)\n\nTB: Yes, great comparison. SEPTEMBER AFFAIR, like ABOUT MRS. LESLIE, is a Hal Wallis production at Paramount. And there are similarities in the two stories.\n\nJL: Plus we have interesting visuals late in the game that add to other interesting visuals. When David reunites with Catherine, they are in a dark room shown mostly in silhouette. A lot of interesting psychological interpretations can be made here, suggesting that maybe they don’t need any illumination because what they have together can penetrate the darkness. Obviously this is a different, but potentially more important and more long lasting, relationship than that of David/Manina.\n\nJust when you think we are getting a happy ending, this story has one more trick up its sleeve. Remember that “September Song” is not a tune of forever lasting. On the plus side, Manina conquers her fear of flying the friendly skies so you know she can take another leap of faith forward.\n\nSEPTEMBER AFFAIR may currently be viewed on YouTube."
