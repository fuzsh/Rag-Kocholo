        "text": "WITH a plot linking a moody young man fighting an urge to kill, his loving wife and an extremely imaginative psychiatrist, the British have concocted a snug, tautly-strung little thriller called \"Stop Me Before I Kill!\"The Columbia release, directed and produced by Val Guest, with a small cast headed by Ronald Lewis, Claude Dauphin and Diane Cilento, opened yesterday on the circuits. The perfect title would have been \"The Full treatment,\" the title of the novel that author Ronald Scott Thorn and Mr. Guest have adapted. To say more would be to spill the beans.As it opens, Mr. Lewis and Miss Cilento are belatedly honeymooning on the French Riviera. The young husband, who has been confined to a hospital for a head injury, is a shaky, trigger-tempered chap who mixes loving embraces with murderous impulses. Enter, now, Mr. Dauphin, as a vacationing, plain-spoken psychiatrist.The three return to London, and the husband becomes a surly patient of the older man. The story now shapes up as one of those case histories where murder is prevented and love reaffirmed in the nick of time. And there are no complaints, for the dialogue has a nice, cutting edge, the tempo and photography are crisp and the picture seems ready to slope off in suspenseful familiarity. But not quite. After the best scene of all (a carbolic couch session, where the camera, from the patient's viewpont, restlessly whips around the doctor's office), the story flip flops to a surprising new plane. If the ending is a bit too comfortably melodramatic and neat, most spectators should be kept guessing, along with the bewildered young hero.As the handsome, agonized husband, Mr. Lewis is altogether convincing. And so are the lovely Miss Cilento and Mr. Dauphin. Francoise Rosay, as the latter's mother, looks in all too brieflyâ€”as usual these days. The principal backgrounds, in and around Cannes, are fetching and for once a plot doesn't bask in Riviera radiance.Mr. Guest's package is a small one, but trim and adroitly tied. The contents are worth waiting for.\n\nSTOP ME BEFORE I KILL! screenplay by Ronald Scott Thorn and Val Guest, from Mr. Thorn's novel, \"The Full Treatment\", directed and produced by Mr. Guest for Falcon Films: presented by Columbia pictures. At neighborhood theatres. Running time: ninety-three minutes.Alan Colby . . . . . Ronald LewisDr. Prade . . . . . Claude DauphinDenise Colby . . . . . Diane CilentoMadame Prade . . . . .
