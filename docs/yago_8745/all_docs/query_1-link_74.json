She is the daughter of Paul Aschar, an entrepreneur of Swiss origin, and Léontine Lamolle, a stay-at-home mother. Françoise has two older brothers, Marcel and Henri, and a younger sister, Simone. She grew up in a wealthy family, attending the best educational establishments in Paris. Françoise Rosay’s artistic journey began at the Théâtre Antoine, where she met the director Jacques Feyder, who later became her husband. Together, they had a daughter, Françoise Feuillère, who also became a great French actress.\n\nThis family of artists distinguished themselves in French cinema from the 1920s to 1940s, known for their leading roles in several renowned films. Françoise Rosay is today considered one of the emblematic figures of French cinema. She died on March 28, 1974 in Montgeron, leaving a legacy of unforgettable cinematographic works. Its genealogy is marked by a lineage of talented artists, having contributed to the influence of French culture both on theater stages and on cinema screens."
