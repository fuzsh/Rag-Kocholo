        "text": "IT is a weird and sardonic sort of humor that Claude Autant-Lara is tossing around in his most recent French motion picture to be brought to this side, \"The Red Inn.\" And it is a funny but impious sort of prelate that the great comic actor, Fernandel, plays in this prickly farce contrivance that came to the Fifth Avenue Cinema yesterday.Scene of this stinging Gallic boutade is a nineteenth-century country inn where a fearsome mine-host and his good wife are engaged in a slightly ghoulish trade. Bluntly, it is their practice to murder their infrequent guests, purloin their small possessions and bury their bodies in the woods. Pickings are few in their fastness, and they have become rather hardened to their trade. They have also become rather frantic about the wherewithal to carry on.Imagine, then, their delight and confusion when there descend upon them, all in one cold night, a poor organ-grinder, (whom they murder), a stage-coach full of trusting passengers and—most inconvenient and disconcerting—an amiable mendicant monk!This is the arch situation Jean Auranche has rigged to permit Autant-Lara and Fernandel to play a macabre joke—the joke being in that the presence of the monk keeps the hosts from their grim trade. For, furthermore, during the evening, the wife of the innkeeper tells the monk of her murderous achievements and intentions by way of confessional. And this frightful secret, lodged squarely with the poor monk, whose lips are sealed, makes for a night of comic horror as he tries to prevent the pending doom.Possibly this weird confusion of the farcical and the grotesque with a frank slash of satire on religion was a bit too involved to engineer to a smooth and consistent flow of humor. There are times when the joke gets somewhat grim and the kidding around with sacred symbols looks a bit like deliberate blasphemy. This could prove highly distasteful and agonizing to the devout.Possibly, too, Autant-Lara and M. Aurenche were not just the boys to handle a subject as raucous and strangely insensitive as this. They formed the team that gave us \"Devil in the Flesh,\" that ironic tale of tortured lovers, and that could be more in their line.Even so, the predominant performance of Fernandel as the monk achieves some delicious character clowning whenever he gets in the clear. His wonderful turn of disposition when he hears the confession of Françoise Rosay, who plays the wife of the inn keeper, is a screamingly comic thing to see, and his frenzied efforts to save himself and others from midnight murder are brilliantly droll.Mme. Rosay is rich, too, as a lady who can be tough when murder is afoot but who shows a serene and pious nature when it is a matter of setting by her soul. As the inn keeper, Carette makes a brigand of wonderful viciousness, and the daughter of these two middle-aged scoundrels is played neatly by Marie Claire Olivia.Others in the cast are good in quaint roles. The settings and the atmosphere are fine. The English subtitles do a fair job of translating the sly French dialogue.\n\nTHE RED INN, written by Jean Aurenche; directed by Claude Autant-Lara.
