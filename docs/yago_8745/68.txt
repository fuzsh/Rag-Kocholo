Françoise Rosay , pseudonym of Françoise Bandy de Nalèche (Paris, April 19, 1891 – Montgeron, March 28, 1974), was a French actress.

It was cinematographic and theatrical interpreter with a remarkable dramatic temperament. Daughter of art, he made his debut on the stage in 1908 and, after trying also the activity of lyrical singer, he stated definitively as an actress of prose.

Later, married to director Jacques Feyder, he moved to the cinema, mainly playing films directed by the husband including The heroic event (1935) where he gave the best proof of his talent. He also had significant roles in films directed by other directors, such as René Clair in The two shy (1928), Marcel Carné In Jenny, queen of the night (1936), E Julien Duvivier in Dance carnet (1937).

Theatrical setting actress according to the best French school, Rosay has built characters of character with a great flair, while sometimes indulging in the ease of its interpretative resources. After the Second World War, the film activity did not prevent her from returning frequently to the theater both in Europe and in the United States.
