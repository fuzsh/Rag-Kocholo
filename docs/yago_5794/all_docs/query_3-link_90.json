They were told to make ready, join hands &c., when the Squire commenced. Every thing went smooth until that fateful question, do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife, &c, was propounded the young gentleman. The thing was new to him, and he was not sure that he meant to go so far as that, but his Great Grand- mother who had accompanied the twain to see it done right, was bound to have them hitched, so she yelled out at the top of her voice, Say yes! say yes! When it came the young ladys turn to answer, she was equally undecided, and the old lady had to come to her assistance also. The Squire finally got them spliced, and the groom, not having a surplus of the filthy lucre, began to negotiate for credit, with the Squire, when the old lady again coming to his assistance, agreed to pay for the ceremony in baskets, just as soon as she could make them. The financial part settled, the loving pair started out to see the sights. They took the middle of Main street and proceeded to the East end of town, arm in arm with their faithful dorg following close at their heels. Stopping at the corner of Broadway and Main, Dan slipped his arm around Janeys neck, drew down her head and planted a smacking buss on her cherry lips, to the infinite amusement of the boys who were gathered on the corner. But Dan was oblivious to all this. He looked triumphantly around at the boys, and then another buss from Janeys pouting lips, exclaiming, we dont care s dod-darn, do we sweety. That night some wicked cuss stole the dorg, and the next morning Dan and sweety were on the street in by no means so amiable a mood. The dog was found however, and the last we saw of the happy pair, they were wending their way up Morgantown street, happy as too cooing doves. Such is life.\n\nGenius of Liberty, Uniontown, PA, Thursday, March 3, 1870, Vol. III, No. 8, page 3, column 8\n\nContributed by Roy Lockart\n\nDelila GILER married George VERNON\n\nMARRIED\n\n— On the 12st inst., by Rev.
