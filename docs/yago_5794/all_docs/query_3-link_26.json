        "text": "The portrait gallery showcases many of the photographs and portraits of the Cahoon family and other early Bay Village residents.\n\nIn the Victorian era, technology was going through rapid developments, including the new process of photography. With the introduction of albumen prints, photography and portraiture was now cheap enough to become commercially available to the middle class. Instead of spending time and money to sit for an artist to paint a single portrait of their loved ones, families could now take a short afternoon trip to one of many photography studios.\n\nCleveland had many studios during this time, including the “Studio of Photographie, M. M. Udell,” at 11 & 13 Euclid Avenue. The back of one of their cabinet cards, pictured here, features an ornate advertisement for the studio. The portraits of the Cahoon brothers are some examples of cabinet cards (Frame #25).\n\nPhotography had also progressed far enough that cameras could be taken outside of the studio. In fact, a photographer could come out to document important events such as wedding anniversaries and family reunions. Rose Hill’s portrait gallery showcases many of these photographs, such as Joel and Margaret Cahoon’s golden wedding anniversary in 1881 (Frame #10).\n\nBesides photographs, other types of portraits are seen here. Before commercially available photography a few early Dover residents sat for more traditional portraits such as Joel and Margaret Cahoon when they were a young couple (Frames #5 and #6). Large hand-drawn crayon copies of photographic portraits are also on display, likely made so that the portraits could be framed and hung on the walls rather than kept in a photo album.\n\nPortrait Gallery Key: To read about a particular portrait or photograph, click on the frame number and title below. Or start from the beginning with Emma Hackett Cahoon’s portrait."
