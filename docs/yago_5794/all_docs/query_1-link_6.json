        "text": "A 1969 graduate of Allegany High School, “Francie” went on to obtain her undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Maryland at College Park, and her Law Degree from the Columbus School of Law at Catholic University. She has the distinction of being recognized three times as one of Maryland's \"Top 100 Women\" by the Daily Record, the leading Maryland business and legal journal.\n\nWhile serving as Maryland's First Lady from 1995 through 2001, she spearheaded the development of a 464-page reference book entitled, Women of Achievement in Maryland History. Published in 2002 and financed entirely with private funds, this book chronicles the contributions of 365 Maryland women to the state’s social, political and economic order from the beginning of the state’s history to the present time.\n\nOn June 24, 2004, former First Lady Frances Hughes Glendening's official portrait was unveiled at Government House in Annapolis.\n\nFrom 1985 through early 2006, Francie worked at the Federal Election Commission in Washington, DC, as a legal and policy advisor to a Commissioner. Since August of 2006, she has served as the Chief Executive Officer of Jobs for America’s Graduates—District of Columbia, Inc. (JAG-DC), a private, nonprofit organization that works with DC public school students who are at-risk of not realizing their potential by helping them graduate successfully into careers and/or further education or training. She also teaches classes on women in politics as well as women in leadership at the University of Maryland in the James MacGregor Burns Academy of Leadership which is part of the University’s School of Public Policy.\n\nFrancie remains a leading advocate of the arts, hospice care, suicide prevention and women’s rights and serves on the Executive Committee of the Maryland Women's Heritage Center and the Women Legislators of Maryland Foundation in addition to chairing the Board of Directors for the Olney Theatre Center for the Arts."
