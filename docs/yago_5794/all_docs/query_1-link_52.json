        "text": "In October 1996, he entered into the York Art Association’s 26th Open Juried Exhibition and became the first person ever to receive all three awards – First Place in Oil/Acrylic Category, Best of Show and the Invitational Group Exhibition Award held in April of 1998. The distinguished jurors for this exhibit were Leslie C. Ehrin, Director, Corporate Art consultant and Painting Manager for the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and Nora E. Klorfine, Chairman, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Art Sales and Rental Gallery, who immediately invited him to show his work in their gallery. In June 1999 and again in June 2002, Scott was one of five artists selected to receive “The Rottler Award for Excellence in the Visual Arts” which included a Group Exhibit at the York Art Association the following year.\n\nOut of 1,200 entries, Scott’s painting was one of 87 works chosen for Exhibit III, Works by Contemporary Maryland Artists 2000 in the Conservatory Room, Government House, Annapolis, MD. This exhibition was sponsored by First Lady Frances Hughes Glendening as part of the “Celebration for the Arts in Maryland”.\n\nScott was chosen by “The Artist’s Magazine” as a Finalist in the Still Life Category in the 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006 (2) Art Competitions. In the 2001 Art Competition, he was included in their 2002 Limited Edition Wall Calendar. Scott also won Honorable Mention in the Still Life Category in the 2004 Art Competition, which was featured in their December 2004 issue. In the Artist’s Magazine’s Special 20th Anniversary Issue, January 2004, Scott was named in their feature article “On the Rise” as one of twenty artists to watch and who are destined to be masters painters of the future. Later in their August 2004 issue, a five page feature article “Handing Over the Keys” by Scott Royston was published. Although Scott has been a part of many articles in various artist magazines, Scott has since gone on to publish “Fine-Tuned Drawing with a Paint Brush”, International Artist Magazine, December/January 2007 Issue No. 52, “Masterstrokes”, Oil Painter of America Brushstrokes Members Newsletter, Summer 2007, Volume 17, Issue 2, and “Painting Classical Floral Still Lifes with Skill and Understanding”, American Artist, November 2008, and many others.\n\nIn 2005, Scott was one of the top ten finalists in the International Artist Magazine’s Challenge 29: Still Life and Florals Competition. In 2006, he was also one of the top ten Finalists in the magazine’s Challenge 32: Flowers and Gardens Competition.\n\nIn April 2002, Scott was approached by Mr. Henry H. Nixon, Executive Director, and Ms. Hannelore Schreiber, Vice President, of the York Symphony Orchestra. They chose one of his Floral paintings to hang at all concert performances and various locations in York, PA during the 2002-2003 Symphony Season, be on the cover and included in their Program reaching over 20,000 subscribers, and to be auctioned with the winning announced on April 12, 2003 at the end of the Symphony Season.\n\nIn November 2004 Scott was presented with the AAPL Medal of Honor plus Award in the Oil & Polymer Awards Category of the 76th Grand National Exhibition of the American Artists Professional League at the Salmagundi Club in New York, NY.\n\nSince November 2001, Scott has been an associate member of the Oil Painters of America. In August 2004, Scott was invited to become an associate member of the International Guild of Realism and in their first annual juried exhibition held March 2005 at the Pan American Art Gallery, Dallas, TX, was awarded Best Still Life for his oil painting. In 2005, he became an associate member of the Arnot Art Museum.\n\nMore recently in May 2006, Scott won the People’s Choice Award, Merit Award for Still Life and the Jury’s Top 50 Award at the Salon International 2006, International Museum of Contemporary Masters, Greenhouse Gallery, San Antonio, TX. There were participants from 42 states and 15 countries in this juried exhibition. He was also invited to participate in their International Masters of Fine Art held in October 2006."
