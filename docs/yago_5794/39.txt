ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) â€” Gov. Parris Glendening's marriage has officially ended, just short of its 25th anniversary.

In a brief statement, Glendening said he received a divorce decree Monday. He had been separated from Frances Hughes Glendening since July 2000.

"We wish each other well, and each remain dedicated to careers in public service," Glendening said.

Frances Hughes Glendening issued a statement thanking Marylanders and Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend for supporting her work as first lady. Mrs. Glendening, a lawyer for the Federal Election Commission, has promoted mental health programs, women's issues and literacy, among other causes. The Glendenings have a 21-year-old son.
