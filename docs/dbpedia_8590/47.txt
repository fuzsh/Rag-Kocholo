After years of reselling and rebranding gear from other networking vendors, Dell now is acquiring its own networking company.

Dell announced today that it was acquiring privately-held networking vendor Force10 Networks. Financial terms of the deal are not being publicly disclosed. In a call with analysts, Dell executives were questioned as to why the acquisition price is not being made public. Brad Anderson SVP, Enterprise Product Group at Dell, noted that Force10 is a private company and the deal would be closing within the next few months.

According to Force10, they are a $200 million company based on the last 12 trailing months worth or revenue.

Anderson noted during the analyst call that networking is the next key piece for Dell in growing out its enterprise strategy. Dell currently has its PowerConnect networking portfolio which includes wired gear that is OEMâ€™ed from Juniper and Brocade. Dell entered into an OEM partnership with Juniper at the end of 2009 for Juniper MX routers, SRX services gateways and EX switching gear.
