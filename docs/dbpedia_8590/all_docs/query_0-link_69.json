About this Guide 33 Related Documents For more information about the Deli Networking MXL 10/40GbE Switch 10 Module, refer to the following documents: Dell Networking OS Command Reference Dell Quick Start Guide Dell Networking OS Release Notes 34 About this Guide 2 Configuration Fundamentais The Dell Networking operating system oommand line interface (CLi) is a text-based interface you can use to configure interfaces and protocols. The CLI is structured in modes for security and management purposes. Different sets of commands are available in each mode, and you can limit user access to modes using privilege levels. In the Dell Networking OS, after you enable a command, it is entered into the running configuration file. You can view the current configuration for the whole system or for a particular CLI mode. To save the current configuration, copy the running configuration to another location. For more information, refer to Save the Running-Configuration. 01 NOTE: You can use the chassis management controller (CMC) out-of-band management interface to access and manage an I MXL Switch using the CLI. For information about how to access the CMC to configure an MXL Switch, refer to the Dell Chassis , Management Controller (CMC) User's Guide on the Dell Support website. Topics: Accessing the Command Line CLI Modes The do Command Undoing Commands Obtaining Flelp Entering and Editing Commands Command Flistory Filtering show Command Outputs Multiple Users in Oonfiguration Mode Accessing the Command Line Access the OLI through a serial console port or a telnet session. When the system successfully boots, enter the command line in EXEC mode. telnet 172.31.1.53 Trying 172.31.1.53... Connected to 172.31.1.53. Escape character is Login: username Password: Dell> CLi Modes Different sets of commands are available in each mode. A command found in one mode cannot be executed from another mode (except for EXEC mode commands with a preceding do command (refer to The do Command section). You can set user access rights to commands and oommand modes using privilege levels; for more information about privilege levels and security options, refer to the Privilege Levels Overview section in the Security chapter. The CLI is divided into three major mode levels: Configuration Eundamentals 35 EXEC mode is the default mode and has a privilege level of 1, which is the most restricted level. Only a limited selection of commands is available, notably the show commands, which allow you to view system information. EXEC Privilege mode has commands to view configurations, clear counters, manage configuration files, run diagnostics, and enable or disable debug operations. The privilege level is 15, which is unrestricted. You can configure a password for this mode; refer to the Configure the Enable Password section in the Getting Started chapter. CONFIGURATION mode allows you to configure security features, time settings, set logging and SNMP functions, configure static ARP and MAC addresses, and set line cards on the system. Beneath CONFIGURATION mode are submodes that apply to Interfaces, protocols, and features. The following example shows the submode command structure. Two sub-CONFIGURATION modes are important when configuring the chassis for the first time: INTERFACE sub-mode is the mode in which you configure Layer 2 and Layer 3 protocols and IP services specific to an interface. An interface can be physical (Management interface, 10 Gigabit Ethernet, 40 Gigabit Ethernet, or synchronous optical network technologies [SONET]) or logical (Loopback, Null, port channel, or virtual local area network [VLAN]). LINE sub-mode Is the mode in which you to configure the console and virtual terminal lines. Â© NOTE: At any time, entering a question mark (?) dispiays the avaiiable command options. For exampie, when you are in CONFiGURATiON mode, entering the question mark first iists ali availabie commands, inciuding the possibie submodes. The CLI modes are: EXEC EXEC Privilege CONFIGURATION INTERFACE TEN GIGABIT ETHERNET FORTY GIGABIT ETHERNET INTERFACE RANGE LOOPBACK MANAGEMENT ETHERNET MONITOR SESSION NULL PORT-CHANNEL VLAN IP IP ACCESS-LIST STANDARD ACCESS-LIST EXTENDED ACCESS-LIST LINE CONSOLE VIRTUAL TERMINAL MAC ACCESS-LIST MONITOR SESSION MULTIPLE SPANNING TREE PROTOCOL GVRP PROTOCOL LLDP PER-VLAN SPANNING TREE RAPID SPANNING TREE ROUTE-MAP ROUTER OSPF ROUTER RIP SPANNING TREE Navigating CLI Modes The Dell Networking OS prompt changes to indicate the CLI mode. The following table lists the CLI mode. Its prompt, and Information about how to access and exit the CLI mode. Move linearly through the command modes, except for the end command which takes you directly to EXEC Privilege mode and the exit command which moves you up one command mode level.

To disable a command and remove it from the running-config, enter the no command, then the original command. For example, to delete an IR address configured on an interface, use the no ip address ip-address command. 01 NOTE: Use the help or ? command as described in Obtaining Help. The first bold line shows the assigned IP address, the second bold line shows the no form of the IP address command, and the last bold line shows the IP address removed.

To enable Layer 2 protocols, use the no disable command. For example, in PROTOCOL SPANNING TREE mode, enter no disable to enable Spanning Tree. Obtaining Heip Obtain a list of keywords and a brief functional description of those keywords at any CLI mode using the ? or help command: To list the keywords available in the current mode, enter ? at the prompt or after a keyword. Enter ? after a prompt lists all of the available keywords. The output of this command is the same for the help command. Dell#? start capture cd clear clock configure copy --More-- Start Shell Capture Packet Change current directory Reset functions Manage the system clock Configuring from terminal Copy from one file to another Enter ? after a partial keyword lists all of the keywords that begin with the specified letters. Dell(conf)#cl? class-map clock Dell (conf)#cl Enter [ space] ? after a keyword lists all of the keywords that can follow the specified keyword. Dell(conf)#clock ? summer-time Configure summer (daylight savings) time timezone Configure time zone Dell (conf)#clock Entering and Editing Commands Notes for entering commands. The CLI is not case-sensitive. You can enter partial CLI keywords. - Enter the minimum number of letters to uniquely identify a command. Eor example, you cannot enter cl as a partial keyword because both the clock and class-map commands begin with the letters âcl.â You can enter do, however, as a partial keyword because only one command begins with those three letters. The TAB key auto-completes keywords in commands. Enter the minimum number of letters to uniquely identify a command. The UP and DOWN arrow keys display previously entered commands (refer to Command Flistory). The BACKSPACE and DELETE keys erase the previous letter. Key combinations are available to move quickly across the command line. The following list describes these short-cut key combinations. Short-Cut Key Action Combination CNTL-A Moves the cursor to the beginning of the command line. 40 Configuration Eundamentals Short-Cut Key Combination CNTL-B CNTL-D CNTL-E CNTL-F CNTL-I CNTL-K CNTL-L CNTL-N CNTL-P CNTL-R CNTL-U CNTL-W CNTL-X CNTL-Z Esc B EscF Esc D Action Moves the cursor back one character.

For example: When you are In EXEC mode, the UP and DOWN arrow keys display the previously-entered EXEC mode commands. When you are In CONFIGURATION mode, the UP or DOWN arrows keys recall the previously-entered CONFIGURATION mode commands. Filtering sho. Command Outputs Filter the output of a show command to display specific Information by adding | [except | find | grep | no-more | save] specified_text after the command. The variable specified_text is the text for which you are filtering and it IS case sensitive unless you use the ignore-case subÂ¬ option. Starting with the Dell Networking OS version 7.8.1.0, the grep command accepts an ignore-case sub-option that forces the search to case-insensitive. For example, the commands: show run | grep Ethernet returns a search result with instances containing a capitalized âEthernet,â such as inter face GigabitEthernet 0/0. show run | grep ethernet does not return that search result because it only searches for Instances containing a nonÂ¬ capitalized âethernet.â show run | grep Ethernet ignore-case returns instances containing both \"Ethernetâ and âethernet.â Configuration Fundamentals 41 The grep command displays only the lines containing specified text. The following shows this command used in combination with the do show stack-unit all stack-ports pfc details | grep 0 command. Dell(conf)#do show stack-unit all stack-ports all pfc details | grep 0 stack unit 0 stack-port all 0 Pause Tx pkts, 0 Pause Rx pkts 0 Pause Tx pkts, 0 Pause Rx pkts 0 Pause Tx pkts, 0 Pause Rx pkts 0 Pause Tx pkts, 0 Pause Rx pkts 0 Pause Tx pkts, 0 Pause Rx pkts 0 Pause Tx pkts, 0 Pause Rx pkts (T) I NOTE: The Dell Networking OS accepts a space or no space before and after the pipe. To filter a phrase with spaces, underscores, or ranges, enclose the phrase with double quotation marks. The except keyword displays text that does not match the specified text. The following example shows this command used in combination with the do show stack-unit all stack-ports all pfc details | except 0 command. Example of the except Keyword Dell (conf)#do show stack-unit all stack-ports all pfc details | except 0 Admin mode is On Admin is enabled Local is enabled Link Delay 45556 pause quantum stack unit 1 stack-port all Admin mode is On Admin is enabled The find keyword displays the output of the show command beginning from the first occurrence of specified text. Example of the find Keyword Dell(conf)#do show stack-unit all stack-ports all pfc details | find 0 stack unit 0 stack-port all Admin mode is On Admin is enabled Local is enabled Link Delay 45556 pause quantum 0 Pause Tx pkts, 0 Pause Rx pkts stack unit 1 stack-port all The no-more command displays the output all at once rather than one screen at a time. This is similar to the terminal length command except that the no-more option affects the output of the specified command only. The save command copies the output to a file for future reference. 0 1 NOTE: You can filter a single command output multiple times. The save option must be the last option entered. For 1 example:Dell# command | grep regular-expression \\ except regular-expression | grep other- I regular-expression \\ find regular-expression \\ save. Multiple Users in Configuration Mode Dell Networking OS notifies all users when there are multiple users logged in to CONFIGURATION mode. A warning message indicates the username, type of connection (console or VTY), and in the case of a VTY connection, the IP address of the terminal on which the connection was established. For example: On the system that telnets into the switch, this message appears: % Warning: The following users are currently configuring the system: User \"<username>\" on line consoleO 42 Configuration Fundamentals On the system that is connected over the console, this message appears: % Warning; User \"<username>\" on line vtyO \"10.11.130.2\" is in configuration mode If either of these messages appears, Dell Networking recommends coordinating with the users listed in the message so that you do not unintentionally overwrite each other's configuration changes. Configuration Fundamentals 43 3 Getting Started This chapter describes how you start configuring your system. When you power up the chassis, the system performs a power-on self test (POST) during which the route processor module (RPM), switch fabric module (SFM), and line card status light emitting diodes (LEDs) blink green. The system then loads the Dell Networking operating system. Boot messages scroll up the terminal window during this process. No user interaction is required if the boot process proceeds without interruption. When the boot process completes, the RPM and line card status LEDs remain online (green) and the console monitor displays the EXEC mode prompt. Eor details about using the command line interface (CLI), refer to the Accessing the Command Line section in the Configuration Fundamentals chapter.

Serial Console A universal serial bus (USB) (A-Type) connector is located at the front panel. The USB can be defined as an External Serial Console (RS-232) port, and is labeled on the chassis. The USB is present on the lower side, as you face the I/O side of the chassis, as shown. Getting Started Serial Console 46 Getting Started External Serial Port with a USB Connector The following table list the pin assignments. Table 2. Pin Assignments USB Pin Number Signal Name Pini RTS Pin 2 RX Pin 3 TX Pin 4 CTS Pin 5, 6 GND RxD Chassis GND Accessing the CLI Interface and Running Scripts Using SSH In addition to the capability to aocess a devioe using a console connection or a Telnet session, you can also use SSH for seoure, protected communication with the device. You oan open an SSH session and run commands or script files. This method of connectivity is supported and provides a reliable, safe communication meohanism. Entering CLI commands Using an SSH Connection You oan run CLI commands by entering any one of the following syntax to connect to a switch using the preconfigured user credentials using SSH: ssh username@hostname <CLI Command> or echo <CLI Coinmand> | ssh admin@hostname The SSH server transmits the terminal commands to the CLI shell and the results are displayed on the screen non-interactively. Executing Local CLI Scripts Using an SSH Connection You oan execute CLI commands by entering a CLI script in one of the following ways: ssh username@hostnaine <CLIscript.file> or cat < CLIscript.file > | ssh admin@hostname The script is run and the actions contained in the script are performed. Following are the points to remember, when you are trying to establish an SSH session to the device to run commands or script files: There is an upper limit of 10 concurrent sessions in SSH. Therefore, you might expect a failure in executing SSH-related scripts. Getting Started 47 To avoid denial of service (DoS) attacks, a rate-limit of 10 concurrent sessions per minute in SSH is devised. Therefore, you might experience a failure In executing SSH-related scripts when multiple short SSH commands are executed. If you Issue an interactive command in the SSH session, the behavior may not really be interactive. In some cases, when you use an SSH session, when certain show commands such as show tech-support produce large volumes of output, sometimes few characters from the output display are truncated and not displayed. This may cause one of the commands to fail for syntax error. In such cases, If you add few newline characters before the failed command, the output displays completely. Execution of commands on CLI over SSH does not notice the errors that have occurred while executing the command. As a result, you cannot identify, whether a command has failed to be processed. The console output though is redirected back over SSH. Boot Process After you follow the Installation Procedure in the Getting Started Guide, the switch boots up. The switch with the Dell Networking OS version 8.3.16.1 requires boot flash version 4.0.1.0 and boot selector version 4.0.0.0.

You must configure the system using the CLI. Configuring a Host Name The host name appears in the prompt. The default host name is Dell. Host names must start with a letter and end with a letter or digit. Characters within the string can be letters, digits, and hyphens. To create a host name, use the following command. Create a host name. CCNFIGURATICN mode Getting Started 49 hostname name Example of the hostname Command Dell (conf)fhostname R1 R1 (conf)# Configuring a Unique Host Name on the System While you can manually configure a host name for the system, you can also configure the system to have a unique host name. The unique host name is a combination of the platform type and the serial number of the system. The unique host name appears in the command prompt. The running configuration gets updated with the feature unique-name command. It also overwrites any existing host name configured on the system using the hostname command. To create a unique host name, use the following command. Create a unique host name. CONFIGURATION mode feature unique-name Example of the feature unique-name Command Dell (conf)#feature unique-name FN2210STW000000000022(conf)# FN2210STW000000000022(conf)#no feature unique-name Dell(conf)# Accessing the System Remotely You can configure the system to access it remotely by Telnet or SSH. The switch has a dedicated management port and a management routing table that is separate from the IP routing table. Accessing the Switch Remotely Configuring the system for Telnet is a three-step process, as described in the following topics: 1 Configure an IP address for the management port. Configure the Management Port IP Address 2 Configure a management route with a default gateway. Configure a Management Route 3 Configure a username and password. Configure a Username and Password Configure the Management Port IP Address To access the system remotely, assign IP addresses to the management ports. 1 Enter INTERFACE mode for the Management port. CONEIGURATION mode interface ManagementEthernet slot/port slot: the range Is 0. port', the range Is 0. 2 Assign an IP address to the interface. INTERFACE mode ip address ip-address/mask 50 Getting Started ip-address', an address in dotted-decimal format (A.B.C.D). mask: a subnet mask in /prefix-length format (/ xx). 3 Enable the interface. INTERFACE mode no shutdown Configure a Management Route Define a path from the system to the network from which you are accessing the system remotely. Management routes are separate from IP routes and are only used to manage the system through the management port. To configure a management route, use the following command. Configure a management route to the network from which you are accessing the system. CONFIGURATION mode management route ip-address/mask gateway - ip-address', the network address in dotted-decimal format (A.B.C.D). - mask: a subnet mask in /prefix-length format (/ xx). - gateway: the next hop for network traffic originating from the management port. Configuring a Username and Password To access the system remotely, configure a system username and password. To configure a system username and password, use the following command. Configure a username and password to access the system remotely. CONFIGURATION mode username name [access-class access-list-name] [nopassword | (password | secret | sha256- password} [encryption-type] password [dynamic-salt]] [privilege level] [role role-name] - name: Enter a text string upto 63 characters long. - access-class access-Jist-name: Enter the name of a configured IP AOL. - nopassword: Allows you to configure an user without the password. - password: Allows you to configure an user with a password. - secret: Specify a secret string for an user. - sha256-password: Uses sha256-based encryption method for password. - encryption-type: Enter the encryption type for securing an user password. There are four encryption types. â > 0 â input the password in clear text. â > 5 â Input the password that is already enorypted using MD5 encryption method. - 7 â input the password that is already encrypted using DES encryption method. â > 8 â Input the password that Is already encrypted using sha256-based encryption method. - password: Enter the password string for the user. - dynamic-salt: Generates an additional random input to password encryption process whenever the password is configured. (D NOTE: This option is applicable only In full switch mode. Getting Started 51 privilege level: Assign a privilege levels to the user. The range is from 0 to 15. role role-name: Assign a role name for the user. Dell EMC Networking OS encrypts type 5 secret and type 7 password based on dynamic-salt option such that the encrypted password is different when an user is configured with the same password. Â© NOTE: dynamic-salt option is shown only with secret and password options. In dynamic-salt configuration, the length of type 5 secret and type 7 password is 32 and 16 characters more compared to the secret and password length without dynamic-salt configuration. An error message appears if the username command reaches the maximum length, which Is 256 characters. Configuring the Enable Password Access EXEC Privilege mode using the enable command. EXEC Privilege mode is unrestricted by default. Configure a password as a basic security measure. There are two types of enable passwords: enable password stores the password in the running/startup configuration using a DES encryption method. enable secret is stored in the running/startup configuration in using a stronger, MD5 encryption method. enable sha256-password is stored in the running/startup configuration using sha256-based encryption method (PBKDE2). Dell Networking recommends using the enable sha256-password password. To configure an enable password, use the following command. Create a password to access EXEC Privilege mode. CONFIGURATION mode enable [password | secret | sha256-password] [level level] [encryption-type] password - level: is the privilege level, is 15 by default, and is not required - encryption-type: specifies how you are inputting the password, is 0 by default, and Is not required. - 0 Is for inputting the password in clear text. â > 5 Is for inputting a password that is already encrypted using an MD5 hash. Obtain the encrypted password from the configuration file of another Dell Networking system. You can only use this for the enable secret password. - 7 is for inputting a password that is already encrypted using a DES hash. Obtain the encrypted password from the configuration file of another Dell Networking system. You can only use this for the enable password. - 8 is to input a password that is already encrypted using sha256-based encryption method. Obtain the encrypted password from the configuration file of another device. Configuration File Management Flies can be stored on and accessed from Â© NOTE: Using flash memory cards in behavior, inciuding a reboot. various storage media. the system that have Rename, delete, and copy files on the system from EXEC Privilege mode. not been approved by Dell Networking can cause unexpected system 52 Getting Started Copy Files to and from the System The command syntax for copying files is similar to UNIX. The copy oommand uses the format copy source-file-url destination-file-url. Â© I NOTE: For a detailed description of the copy command, refer to the Dell Networking OS Command Line Reference Guide. To copy a local file to a remote system, combine the file-origin syntax for a local file location with the file-destination syntax for a remote file looation. To copy a remote file to Dell Networking system, combine the file-origin syntax for a remote file looation with the file- destination syntax for a local file location. Table 3.

You may not copy a file from one looation to the same location. When copying to a server, you can only use a hostname If you oonfigured a domain name server (DNS) server. CD NOTE: If all of the following conditions are true, the Portmode Hybrid configuration is not applied, because of the configuration process for server ports as switch ports by default: The running configuration is saved in flash. The startup configuration is deleted. The switch is reloaded. The saved oonfiguration is copied to the running configuration. To avoid this scenario, delete the switch port oonfiguration from the running oonfiguration before copying the saved configuration to the running configuration. Example of Copying a File to an FTP Server The bold flash shows the looal location and the bold ftp shows the remote location.

Dell Networking recommends ooping your running-configuration to the startup-configuration. The system uses the startup-configuration during boot-up to configure the system. The startup-configuration is stored in the internal flash on the lOM by default, but you can save It to a USB flash device or a remote server. The commands in this section follow the same format as those commands In the Copy Flies to and from the System section but use the filenames startup-config and running-config.

Save the running-configuration to the startup-configuration on the Internal flash of the primary PPM. Then copy the new startup- config file to the external flash of the primary PPM. EXEC Privilege mode copy running-config startup-config duplicate Dell Networking OS Behavior: If you create a startup-configuration on an PPM and then move the PPM to another chassis, the startup- configuration is stored as a backup file (with the extension .bak), and a new, empty startup-configuration file is created. To restore your original startup-configuration in this situation, overwrite the new startup-configuration with the original one using the copy startup- config. bak startup-config command. Â© NOTE: When you load the startup configuration or a configuration file from a network server such as TFTP to the running configuration, the configuration is added to the running configuration. This does not replace the existing running configuration. Commands in the configuration file has precedence over commands In the running configuration. 54 Getting Started Viewing Fiies You can only view file information and content on local file systems. To view a list of files or the contents of a file, use the following commands. View a list of files on the internal flash. EXEC Privilege mode dir flash: View a list of files on the usbfiash. EXEC Privilege mode dir usbfiash: View the contents of a file in the internal flash. EXEC Privilege mode show file flash://fiJeuame View the contents of a file in the usb flash. EXEC Privilege mode show file usbfiash://filename View the running-configuration. EXEC Privilege mode show running-config View the startup-configuration. EXEC Privilege mode show startup-config Example of the dir Command The output of the dir command also shows the read/write privileges, size (in bytes), and date of modification for each file.

The system stores files on the internal Flash by default but you can configure the system to store files elsewhere. To view file system information, use the following command. View information about each file system. EXEC Privilege mode show file-systems The output of the show file-systems command in the following example shows the total capacity, amount of free memory, file structure, media type, read/write privileges for each storage device in use. Dell#show file-systems Size(b) Free (b) Feature Type Flag; s Prefixes 2143281152 2000785408 FAT 3 2 USERFLASH rw flash: 15848660992 831594496 FAT 3 2 USBFLASH rw usbflash: - - - network rw ftp: - - - network rw tftp: - - - network rw scp: You can change the default file system so that file management commands apply to a particular device or memory. To change the default directory, use the following command. Change the default directory. EXEC Privilege mode cd directory You can change the default storage location to the USB Flash, as shown. File management commands then apply to the USB Flash rather than the internal Flash. The bold lines show that no file system is specified and that the file is saved to an USB Flash.

To transfer files to an external server, use the copy source-file-url http://host[:port]/file-path command. Enter the following source-file-url keywords and information: To copy a file from the internal FLASH, enter flash:// followed by the filename. To copy the running configuration, enter the keyword running-config. To copy the startup configuration, enter the keyword startup-config. To copy a file on the USB devioe, enter usbflash:// followed by the filename. In the Dell EMC Networking OS release 9.8(0.0), HTTP services support the VRF-aware functionality. If you want the HTTP server to use a VRF table that is attached to an interface, configure that HTTP server to use a speoific routing table. You can use the ip http vrf command to inform the HTTP server to use a speoifio routing table. After you configure this setting, the VRF table is used to look up the destination address. (T) I NOTE: To enable HTTP to be VRF-aware, as a prerequisite you must first define the VRF. You can specify either the management VRF or a nondefault VRF to configure the VRF awareness setting. When you speoify the management VRF, the copy operation that is used to transfer files to and from an HTTP server utilizes the VRF table corresponding to the Management VRF to look up the destination. When you speoify a nondefault VRF, the VRF table corresponding to that nondefault VRF is used to look up the HTTP server. However, these changes are backward-compatible and do not affect existing behavior; meaning, you can still use the ip http source- interface command to oommunioate with a particular interface even if no VRF is configured on that interface (]) I NOTE: If the HTTP service is not VRF-aware, then it uses the global routing table to perform the look-up. Getting Started 57 To enable an HTTP client to look up the VRF table corresponding to either management VRF or any nondefault VRF, use the ip http vrf command in CONFIGURATION mode. Oonfigure an HTTP client with a VRF that is used to connect to the HTTP server. OONFIGURATION MODE DellEMC(conf)#ip http vrf {management | <vrf-name>} Upgrading and Downgrading the Deii Networking OS 01 NOTE: To upgrade the Dell Networking OS, refer to the Release Notes for the version you want to load on the system. Verify Software images Before instaiiation To validate the software image on the flash drive, you can use the MD5 message-digest algorithm or SHA256 Secure Hash Algorithm, after the image is transferred to the system but before the image is installed. The validation calculates a hash value of the downloaded image file on system's flash drive, and, optionally, compares it to a Dell EMC Networking published hash for that file. The MD5 or SHA256 hash provides a method of validating that you have downloaded the original software. Calculating the hash on the local image file and comparing the result to the hash published for that file on iSupport provides a high level of confidence that the local copy is exactly the same as the published software image. This validation procedure, and the verify {mdS | sha256} command to support it, prevents the installation of corrupted or modified images. The verify {mdS | sha256 } command calculates and displays the hash of any file on the specified local flash drive. You can compare the displayed hash against the appropriate hash published on iSupport. Optionally, you can include the published hash in the verify {md5 | sha256 } command, which displays whether it matches the calculated hash of the indicated file. To validate a software image: 1 Download Dell EMC Networking OS software image file from the iSupport page to the local (FTP or TFTP) server. The published hash for that file displays next to the software image file on the iSupport page. 2 Go on to the Dell EMC Networking system and copy the software image to the flash drive, using the copy command. 3 Runtheverify {md5 | sha256} [ f lash : / / ] img-f ile [hash-value] command. Eor example, verify sha256 flash://FTOS-SE-9.5.0.0.bin A Compare the generated hash value to the expected hash value published on the iSupport page. To validate the software image on the flash drive after the image is transferred to the system, but before you install the image, use the verify {md5 | sha256} [ flash://] img-file [hash-value] command in EXEC mode. md5: MD5 message-digest algorithm sha2 56: SHA256 Secure Hash Algorithm flash: (Cptional) Specifies the flash drive.
