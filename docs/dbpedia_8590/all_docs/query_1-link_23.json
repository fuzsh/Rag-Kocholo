Tines ingests your vulnerability alerts then deduplicates the alerts, enriches them with information from across your architecture, creates a ticket in your system with all the information, then, when complete, runs a final scan to confirm remediation. Together, Tines and Tenable offer visibility into vulnerabilities and the ability to remediate them effectively.\n\nThis integration is built and supported by Tines.\n\nResources:\n\nContact Support\n\nWebsite\n\nTufin\n\nThe Tufin integration with Tenable analyzes user-selected network segments for asset vulnerabilities with existing access containing the service/protocol that makes them a candidate for exploitation. Vulnerability information from Tenable Vulnerability Management and Tenable Security Center is made available in the vulnerable asset profiles in Tufin that are used to determine the patches that are required to remediate. The context provides users with the ability to design mitigating controls or initiate access change requests to prevent the exploitation of a vulnerable and accessible asset.\n\nThis integration is built and supported by Tufin.\n\nResources:\n\nContact Support\n\nTufin\n\nVector0\n\nVector0's DarkWave Attack Surface Management platform integrates with Tenable Vulnerability Management to provide customers with a holistic view of all assets and vulnerabilities discovered by Tenable Vulnerability Management. In addition, DarkWave routinely checks customers' Tenable Vulnerability Management instance for new and changed data and leverages that to automatically mark items as remediated, resurface vulnerabilities that have been reintroduced, and even automates the reduction of false positives. Combining that data with DarkWave's asset discovery, monitoring, and scanning technology further enhances customers' view of their overall attack surface, allowing them to make strategic decisions that will significantly impact their overall security posture.\n\nThe integration is built and supported by Vector0.\n\nResources:\n\nContact Support\n\nWebsite\n\nVisium\n\nVisium’s Integration with Tenable enables context-based threat awareness benefits of CyGraph – quickly and intuitively understand threats, root causes and mitigation steps in real-time. The CyGraph API connector for Tenable automatically and continuously ingests Tenable data displaying critical information to save money and protect digital reputations. By combining CyGraph with the asset, and vulnerability information from Tenable, users are better able to assess relationships between nodes and applications for risk monitoring and mitigation.\n\nThis integration is built and supported by Visium.\n\nResources:\n\nContact Support\n\nWebsite\n\nVulcan Cyber\n\nVulcan Cyber integration with Tenable enables users to focus on remediation and get fix done. Vulcan Cyber's remediation intelligence prioritizes the vulnerabilities that matter to your business and attaches the remedies and fixes needed to mitigate the threat. Then, the platform orchestrates and measures the rest of the remediation process with integrations and inputs into patch and ticketing systems & tools, while allowing full visibility, monitoring, and tracking capabilities. The Vulcan Cyber ExposureOS is designed to help information security teams aggregate, correlate, prioritize, and remediate exposure risk across all attack surfaces, from one platform.\n\nThis integration is built and supported by Vulcan Cyber.\n\nResources:\n\nContact Support\n\nWebsite\n\nTry Vulcan\n\nW@tchtower\n\nW@tchTower integrates with Tenable Security Center to bring your vulnerability data into The W@tchtower Platform, relate it to other key information like IOCs and make it available in interactive investigation tools, incident tickets, workflows and dashboards. With W@tchTower and Tenable together, you can readily prioritize vulnerability patching according to the threats you are currently facing.\n\nThis integration is built and supported by W@tchtower.\n\nResources:\n\nContact Support\n\nWebsite\n\nXM Cyber\n\nXM Cyber's integration with Tenable Vulnerability Management extends the power of Tenable Vulnerability Management's ecosystem by providing the critical assets that are defined in XM Cyber APM, and the choke points XM Cyber APM exposes. At the same time, XM Cyber APM's Vulnerability Management module is enriched with Tenable's vulnerabilities.\n\nThe integration between XM Cyber and Tenable Security Center offers CxOs powerful and effective visibility along with compliance validation and controls, to secure and monitor Tenable Security Center.\n\nThis integration is built and supported by XM Cyber.\n\nResources:\n\nContact Support\n\nWebsite"
