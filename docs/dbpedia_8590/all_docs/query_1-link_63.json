LARGE DEMANDS for long-term credit and capital have accompanied the continued growth in economic activity this year. Business financial needs have been particularly strong, as expenditures for plant and equipment have risen to record levels and funds available from operations have been no greater than last year. Demands for credit to finance construction and purchase of homes and construction of community facilities by State and local governments have also been large. Long-term credit demands are largely met through investment of the long-term savings flowing to financial institutions such as life insurance companies, pension funds, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, and commercial banks. To meet the sharp rise in demands for long-term credit in 1955, many institutions supplemented their inflows of loan repayments and new savings by borrowing or by reducing their holdings of cash and Government securities. The flow of new savings to financial institutions has increased moderately in 1956, but supplementary funds have been more difficult and more costly to obtain. Declining prices of Government securities have increased the expense of obtaining funds through further sales of such securities. This increased cost, together with other restraints on credit expansion exercised by the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Home Loan Bank System, has tended to limit the growth in long-term credit and to relate it more closely.to the growth in longterm savings. BOND YIELDS WN. 1954 1955 1956 NOTE.—Series are from Moody's Investors Service. Corporate yields are weekly averages of daily figures; State and local yields, Thursday figures. Latest figures are for week ending Dec. 1, 1956. Reflecting the pressure of current and prospective demands for credit and the limited availability of credit supplies, long-term interest rates have risen and other borrowing terms have become more restrictive. Yields on outstanding corporate and municipal bonds have increased substantially, as the chart shows, and the increase in costs of new borrowing has been even greater. Rising interest rates have stimulated the direct flow of individuals' savings into capital markets. Purchases of corporate and municipal securities by individuals this year have been greater than in 1955, and have represented a larger share of their additions to financial asset holdings. Use of credit by individuals has declined, however, as borrowing to finance expenditures on homes and durable goods has been less than in 1955. 1277 1278 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • DECEMBER 1956 Restraint in individuals' spending and borrowing and increases in their financial investment have partially offset pressures on commodity and credit markets arising from business expenditures for plant expansion. INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS The flow of new long-term savings to financial institutions has expanded moderately this year. From January through September the increase in these savings, as measured by the growth in reserves of life insurance companies and pension funds, savings capital of savings and loan associations, and savings and time deposits at banks, amounted to $12.3 billion. This increase was about $600 million more than in the comparable period of 1955. Insurance and pension fund reserves and savings capital of savings and loan associations increased at a slightly faster rate than last year, and there was little change in the rate of growth in deposits at mutual savings banks. Expansion of savings and time deposits at commercial banks was much SELECTED TYPES OF SAVING NET INCREASE, JANUARY THROUGH SEPTEMBER Billions of dollars COMMERCIAL BANK SAVINGS AND TIME DEPOSITS MUTUAL SAVINGS BK.

Recently, the maximum permissible rates of interest payable by insured commercial banks on savings and time deposits were raised by joint action of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The increase becomes effective January 1, 1957. Moderate growth in the flow of savings to institutions has been more than offset by reductions in funds from other sources that were utilized by financial institutions in 1955. Last year, with credit demands rising and a large volume of earlier commitments to be fulfilled, many institutions supplemented the inflow of new savings by selling Government securities or by borrowing. Institutional demands for supplementary funds added to the pressure of other loan demands on the banking system and the capital markets in 1955. Insurance companies, for example, increased their lending on business securities and mortgages by arranging temporary financing of mortgage acquisitions through repurchase agreements with commercial banks. Mortgage companies borrowed heavily from commercial banks to carry portfolios until funds became available from permanent lenders. Savings and loan associations increased their borrowings from the Federal home loan banks and reduced their balances held in these banks. To supply funds, the Federal home loan banks, in turn, increased their borrowings from security markets. As economic activity, stimulated by the expansion in credit, pressed increasingly against productive capacity during 1955, the Federal Reserve System acted to restrain inflationary pressures by limiting the reserve funds supplied through open market opera- 1279 CAPITAL MARKETS IN 1956 tions and by increasing the cost of member bank borrowing. The Federal Home Loan Bank System also acted to restrain growth in mortgage debt by limiting the extent of borrowing by its member associations. In addition to these restraints on further expansion of credit, financial institutions have encountered increased market resistance in obtaining funds through sales of United States Government securities. Corporate purchases of Government securities in 1955 offset in large part sales by commercial banks and other financial institutions. There has been a marked shift in corporate demand for Treasury issues this year. Nonfinancial corporations reduced their holdings of Government securities by an unusually large amount in the first half of 1956, and have added only moderately to their holdings since midyear. Although the Federal Government has reduced the publicly held debt outstanding by a substantial amount this year, prices of Government securities in all maturity ranges have declined. Reflecting the reduced availability and increased cost of supplementary funds, many financial institutions have exercised increasing selectivity and moderation this year in lending and in commitments of future funds. In the first nine months of 1956, savings and loan associations limited the expansion of their mortgage portfolios to $3.5 billion, about the same increase as in their savings capital, and reduced their indebtedness to the Federal home loan banks. In the comparable period of 1955, the increase of $4.5 billion in their mortgage holdings exceeded the net inflow of savings capital by more than one-third. Sales of Government securities by life insurance companies were large in the early months of 1956, as these companies sought funds to meet rising business loan demands and to fulfill commitments made earlier. In recent months both the reduction in Government security holdings and the expansion in portfolios of mortgages and business securities have been smaller. Commercial banks also made substantial reductions in their holdings of Government securities in the first half of the year. Since midyear their holdings have increased somewhat, while loan expansion has moderated. LONG-TERM CREDIT DEMANDS Further increases in business demands for long-term credit and capital this year have been accompanied by continued large demands for financing residential construction and construction outlays of State and local governments. Business financial needs have been reflected in a record volume of security flotations and large increases in bank loans and commercial mortgages. Expansion in home mortgage debt, while less than in 1955, has been substantially greater than in any other year since World War II. Financing of toll-highway construction has declined further, but the volume of State and local government bond issues for most other programs has continued large. Business. A record volume of expenditures for new plant and equipment this year has increased business requirements for both working capital and long-term funds. Early in the year, credit demands were augmented by the need for funds to finance large additions to inventories and to make heavy tax payments on 1955 incomes. Continued rise in capital outlays since midyear has sustained business demands for external funds. The initial impact of business credit demands this year was heavier on commercial banks than on capital markets. Corporate liquidation of Government security holdings in the early months of 1956 was much larger 1280 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • DECEMBER 1956 than in 1955, and many companies obtained their external financing through bank loans rather than security issues. Although earlier surveys had forecast substantial increases in business expenditures for new plant and equipment this year, the net change in outstanding securities in the first quarter of 1956 was little greater than a year earlier, as is shown on the chart. Expansion of business loans at commercial banks, in contrast, was more than two and one-half times as great as in the first quarter of 195 5. With demands for long-term funds moderate, yields on corporate bonds declined somewhat in early 1956, while rates on short-term bank loans were maintained. Successive surveys of business spending plans confirmed the magnitude of the increase expected this year in capital outlays by manufacturing companies, and indicated a substantial upward revision in proposed IUSINESS I0M0WING N«t change, billiont of dolldri SECURITY ISSUES 1955 1956 NOTE.—Quarterly changes in commercial and industrial loans at all commercial banks and Securities and Exchange Commission estimates of net change in outstanding corporate securities. spending by public utility companies. This revision was of marked significance for capital markets, since utility expansion customarily is financed to a greater extent through sales of securities than are capital outlays by other industries. The impact of business spending plans on capital markets was increasingly evident by late winter, as the volume of security flotations, of announcements of prospective flotations, and of commitments for future borrowing from institutional lenders increased rapidly. Yields on corporate securities rose sharply from early March through late April, then stabilized at these higher levels until early July. Business financial pressures have not moderated significantly since midyear. Plant and equipment expenditures have continued to rise, and financing of customers through accounts receivable has increased, as is usual in the second half of the year. In some manufacturing industries, such as metals and metal products, short-term financing needs were reduced somewhat in summer and early fall by a decline in the rate of inventory accumulation. Recently there has been a resumption of borrowing by these industries. Internal sources of funds have not kept pace with the continued rise in business outlays. Funds from operations have been no larger than in the first half of the year. While depreciation allowances have increased further, corporate profits have been lower in the second half and dividend payments have increased. Reductions in liquid asset balances and increases in short-term borrowing earlier in the year reduced corporate liquidity by mid1956 to the lowest point in the postwar period. Decreased liquidity and the need to provide for future tax payments have limited further financing from these sources. Business needs for external financing, particularly CAPITAL MARKETS IN 1956 1281 for long-term funds, have therefore resecurity flotations this year has been for new mained strong since midyear, and flotations capital; the volume of flotations for refundof securities have been in record volume. ing purposes has been relatively small.

Many investors are willing to accept a lower return on State and local government securities than on alternative longterm investments because the interest paid on them is exempt from Federal income taxes. In recent years these bonds have yielded from % to 1 percentage point less than corporate securities of comparable quality. A marked widening of the differential reduces the attractiveness of the taxexemption feature, however. With strong business demands for credit reflected in rising yields on corporate securities, State and local governments have had to adjust the terms offered on their obligations in order to compete for available long-term funds.

Latest figures are for week ending Dec. 1, 1956. The rise in municipal yields has not been continuous throughout the year, as can be seen on the chart. In February, in June, and again in October, concentrations of new issues were greater than capital markets could absorb readily. As the volume of current issues and announcements of prospective flotations mounted, dealers' inventories of unsold securities increased, and yields were subsequently adjusted upward in order to complete the distribution of issues. For many large-scale construction projects, the timelag between authorization of the project and inception of construction is relatively long, and the timing of financing can be adjusted to take advantage of shortterm fluctuations in market conditions. Each sharp rise in interest costs this year has therefore caused temporary postponement of some borrowing. As the volume of flotations diminished and dealers' inventories of securities declined, pressure on yields abated. Intensification of demands for long-term capital throughout the economy during 1956 has carried yields to higher peaks in each upswing and has moderated subsequent declines. By mid-December, yields on State and local government bonds were about onethird above those at the beginning of 1956. Residential construction. Expenditures for residential construction have been relatively stable during 1956, at a level about one-tenth below the record set in 1955, but much higher than in any previous postwar year. The number of new dwelling units started has declined more than housing expenditures, for rising building costs and a trend toward construction of more expensive houses have moderated the decline in dollar volume of housing outlays. Continued high levels of expenditures for new and older houses have been reflected in continued strong demands for mortgage 1283 CAPITAL MARKETS IN 1956 money. Home mortgage debt increased $8V2 billion in the first nine months of the year, one-seventh less than the record growth in the comparable period of 1955, but more than one-fourth larger than in 1954. Conventional loans have accounted for a larger share of the expansion in home mortgage debt this year. The net growth in conventional loans outstanding has been as large as in 1955, while financing through mortgages insured or guaranteed by the Federal Government has been smaller than last year. Government-underwritten financing is still large, however. As is shown on the chart, the net growth from January through September in Government-underwritten loans outstanding was much greater than in most recent years. The increased proportion of conventional mortgage loans this year reflects changes in the availability of resources among lending institutions as well as institutional responses to competitive demands for long-term capital. In the latter part of 1954, institutional lenders made commitments for a large volume of lending on Federally underwritten mortgages. Fulfillment of these commitments in 1955 required sales of United States Government securities and extensive resort to supplementary credit, obtained largely from commercial banks and the Federal home loan banks. Since late 1955 supplementary credit has become less readily available, the cost of obtaining funds through sales of Government securities has increased, and yields on alternative investments have risen. Interest rates on mortgages guaranteed or insured by the Government are fixed by law or regulation. Although alignment of these rates with yields on alternative investments is made by the market through a discounting process, the range of adjustments is limited and adjust- KOME MORTGAGE DEBT NET INCREASE, JANUARY THROUGH SEPTEMBER Biiiiont of dollars OOVCRNMENTUNDERWRITTEN LOANS 1952 19S3 1954 1955 1956 NOTE.—Quarterly net changes in total home mortgages are Federal Reserve estimates adjusted to annual data of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Government-underwritten loans are based on Veterans Administration and Federal Housing Administration data; conventional loans are derived. ments tend to lag behind the rise in other rates. As a result, lenders have been increasingly reluctant this year to lend or to make commitments for future loans on Federally underwritten mortgages. Large acquisitions of these mortgages by financial institutions in late 1955 and early 1956 reflected in part the fulfillment of loan commitments and repurchase agreements made earlier. Since the spring of this year, both acquisitions of Federally underwritten mortgages and commitments for future acquisitions have declined. No comparable decline has occurred in either lending or commitments for conventional mortgages, the terms of which can more easily be adjusted to current market conditions. In early December, the Federal Housing Administration increased maximum permissible interest rates on insured home mortgages. This action, effective December 4, raised the FHA rate on home mortgages to 5 per cent from 4Vi per cent, the rate that had prevailed since May 1953. United States Banking Organization Abroad UNITED STATES BANKS conduct business abroad through correspondents, branches, and subsidiary institutions. A bank's choice among these various facilities depends principally upon relative advantages in terms of its own organization and type of business as well as conditions in the countries in which it intends to operate. \"Foreign banking\" and \"foreign financing\" corporations are special types of subsidiary institutions, chartered in the United States, through which a United States bank may conduct activities abroad separately from its operations in this country. These corporations may also serve as intermediaries through which United States banks may participate with other banking as well as with nonbanking interests in certain phases of foreign and international business. These corporations, which appeared as early as 1901, have filled limited but special overseas needs of American banking. State bank participation in these corporations has always been contingent upon authority provided by State laws, and since the Banking Act of 1933 State banks which are members of the Federal Reserve System have also been subject to the same provisions, in this respect, as national banks. In 1916 Section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act was amended to authorize national banks to invest in stock of State chartered corporations engaged in foreign banking, provided such corporations agreed to operate in accordance with limitations prescribed by the Federal Reserve Board. In 1919 the Edge Act amended the Federal Reserve Act by addition of Section 2 5 ( a ) . This amendment authorized the Board to charter corporations engaged in foreign banking and other foreign financial operations and made such corporations subject to regulation by the Board and their stock eligible for purchase by national banks. Federal charter thus was made available for corporations that engage in foreign banking or foreign financing, provided they meet certain legal requirements. Their stock could be held by United States banks as well as by other investors. In practice, only a few corporations formed by or with the participation of United States banks have availed themselves of this Federal charter; most have been formed under State laws. Organization of such State and Federally chartered corporations reached a peak between 1916 and 1920, a period of great expansion of the foreign trade of the United States. In recent years there has been renewed interest in such institutions. The Board of Governors has issued a revised Regulation K, effective January 15, 1957, which applies to Federal corporations NOTE.—This article was prepared by Frank M. Tamagna of the Board's staff and Parker B. Willis of the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and is based upon an internal study made for a System Committee by Parker B. Willis. Staff members of the Board and various Federal Reserve Banks assisted in the preparation of this article—in particular, Glenn M. Goodman, Charles H. Bartz, and John M. Poundstone of the Division of Examinations, Frederic Solomon of the Legal Division, and John J. Hurley of the Division of Bank Operations. The authors wish to acknowledge the cooperation received from interested banking institutions. 1284 UNITED STATES BANKING ORGANIZATION ABROAD chartered under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, and also (with certain exceptions) to State chartered corporations in which member banks participate under Section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act. The new regulation, the text of which appears on pages 1301-11 of this BULLETIN, reaffirms and clarifies the separation of deposit banking and other financing functions that has been part of the regulation since it was first issued in 1920. Under the revised regulation, a foreign banking corporation may conduct deposit business, accept drafts or bills of exchange, and make loans related to foreign business. Subject to specific permission of the Board, it may also invest in stock of other corporations engaged in foreign banking activities. Such a banking corporation is not permitted to issue, underwrite, sell, or distribute securities, or to issue its own obligations except promissory notes due within one year and evidencing borrowing from banks. On the other hand, a foreign financing corporation is not authorized to receive deposit accounts or to accept drafts or bills of exchange, but may finance itself by the issuance of debentures, bonds, and other such obligations, and, upon application to the Board, may obtain general advance permission to make certain kinds of investments in other foreign corporations not engaged in banking business. Neither a foreign banking nor a foreign financing corporation may engage directly or indirectly in domestic United States business. Revised Regulation K defines the conditions and limitations under which a foreign banking or financing corporation might carry on business in the United States which is \"incidental to its international or foreign business.\" It prescribes acceptance, loan, and borrowing limitations, amount and 1285 form of reserves against deposits, and other operating procedures and limitations for banking and financing corporations. UNITED STATES BANKING ABROAD Most United States banks that conduct foreign business rely on correspondent banks to handle their overseas transactions. Under this system, a United States bank has an arrangement with a foreign bank, either directly or through another domestic bank, under which the two banks act as agents for each other. Banks that have or intend to develop substantial foreign business often supplement their correspondent relationships by establishing representatives' offices in selected foreign cities. A representative's office is a means of establishing better relations with foreign markets and closer ties with local banks in those markets. Wide use of the correspondent system reflects the tradition and nature of the unit banking system of the United States, as well as the fact that most United States banks do not have sufficient foreign business to justify establishments abroad. A few of the largest institutions, handling about two-thirds of the foreign commercial banking business of the United States, have developed their own overseas banking organizations. While these banks have usually chosen a direct branch organization for this purpose, in some instances they have established foreign banking corporations— chartered in the United States—to supplement their foreign branch operations or to serve other special needs. In comparison with the correspondent system, a direct organization has certain advantages—such as the prestige attached to the name of the United States bank, direct relations with prospective foreign customers, and closer contacts with conditions abroad. On the 1286 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • DECEMBER 1956 other hand, direct operations in foreign markets may deprive the United States bank of some foreign correspondent business. By and large, foreign branches and foreign banking corporations perform the same transactions in the markets in which they operate. As compared with a branch, a banking corporation has some disadvantages, such as smaller loan limits, but it also offers some advantages. A banking corporation may be more flexible than a branch in meeting particular or changing conditions in foreign markets. For instance, it can acquire controlling or minority interests in a foreign bank, thus holding shares jointly with local investors, which a foreign branch cannot do. A foreign financing corporation, on the other hand, may conduct abroad certain investment-type activities that are not permitted to a United States bank. Both types of foreign corporations—that is, banking and financing—may facilitate closer cooperation between United States and foreign banks and foster the use of American and foreign capital for financing trade and investment overseas. EARLY ACTIVITIES Before enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, national banks did not have the power to establish branches, either at home or abroad, although several States allowed banks incorporated under their laws to do so. The operation of foreign branches was confined to a few \"private\" (unincorporated) banks and one or two State banks, and these conducted only a relatively small amount of foreign business. Also, there was no specific provision in the law authorizing national banks to accept drafts, which at that time were the primary instruments for financing international trade. The first foreign branch of a United States banking institution is believed to have been established in London in 1887 by JarvisConklin Mortgage Trust Co., New York. When this institution closed in 1893, its London branch was taken over by North American Trust Company, New York. In 1897 Guaranty Trust Company of New York opened its London office, which it still maintains. In 1901 International Banking Corporation was organized under Connecticut law and soon established branches in London, Asia, and other parts of the world. Various banks and insurance companies held interests in this corporation from time to time before it was acquired by The National City Bank of New York in 1915. Branches in London and Paris were established in 1906 by Farmers Loan and Trust Company, New York, and in 1912 by Equitable Trust Company, New York; the latter succeeded to the London branch of the North American Trust Company. Another branch in London was opened in 1913 by Empire Trust Company, New York. A foreign banking corporation, Continental Banking and Trust Company, was organized in 1913 under the laws of West Virginia and conducted business through offices in New York and Panama until dissolved in 1922. Thus, by 1914 four United States banks incorporated and doing a regular banking business in New York and two foreign banking corporations operating primarily abroad had a total of 26 branches in foreign places. On the whole, United States banks played a minor role in foreign financing in this period, and most of our foreign trade was financed in sterling by London banks. One reason may have been that, in the early period of the national banking system, United States banks were hard pressed to service domestic trade and investments and found UNITED STATES BANKING ORGANIZATION ABROAD little incentive ta provide the special credit requirements of the export business. By 1900, as this nation offered more manufactured goods in the world market, the composition of trade between the United States and Europe began to change. The partial shift in exports from food and raw materials to manufactured products created complex and diverse problems for marketing and financing these products and gave rise to demand for improved foreign banking facilities. The National Monetary Commission, reporting in 1911 on the need for banking reform, specifically pointed to the absence of United States banking institutions in foreign countries as one of the weak points of our financial structure, and concluded that the organization of such banks was necessary for the development of our foreign trade. The Federal Reserve Act, passed on December 23, 1913 included provisions authorizing national banks to accept drafts and to establish foreign branches when approved by the Federal Reserve Board. This change in powers and the strength resulting from establishment of the Federal Reserve System facilitated the rapid expansion of foreign branches by United States banks which accompanied the growth of our foreign trade and the transformation of the United States into a creditor nation during and after World War I. PROVISIONS IN FEDERAL RESERVE ACT Section 25 of Federal Reserve Act. Section 25 of the original Federal Reserve Act authorized the establishment of branches abroad by national banks having capital and surplus of not less than $1 million, conditional upon application to and approval by the Federal Reserve Board. The National City Bank of New York 1287 was the first national bank to use the new power to establish foreign branches. It opened a branch in Buenos Aires in 1914 and followed with other branches in Latin America. In 1917 The First National Bank of Boston established a branch in Buenos Aires to serve New England wool and hide industries, and later opened a branch in Havana to finance the sugar trade. Amendment of Section 25 in 1916. Shortly after passage of the Federal Reserve Act, discussions were revived with regard to the desirability of permitting United States banks to participate in foreign subsidiaries. One of the points made was that small banks could not individually take advantage of the provisions governing foreign branches, but that by uniting with other banks they could participate in foreign business through establishment of foreign banking corporations. Participation in such corporations was made possible by an amendment of Section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act. This amendment (approved on September 7, 1916) authorized national banks with capital and surplus of $1 million or more to invest up to 10 per cent of their capital and surplus in the stock of corporations \"principally engaged in international or foreign banking, or banking in a dependency or insular possession of the United States, either directly or through the agency, ownership, or control of local institutions in foreign countries, or in such dependencies or insular possessions.\" This amendment related to corporations \"incorporated under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.\" However, no provision was made for Federal chartering of such corporations and, in practice, the amendment remained applicable to corporations incorporated under State laws. Investment by a national bank in this type 1288 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • DECEMBER 1956 of corporation was made subject to permission by the Federal Reserve Board. The amendment provided that, in order to have its stock eligible for purchase by a national bank, the corporation should \"enter into an agreement or undertaking with the Federal Reserve Board to restrict its operations or conduct its business in such manner or under such limitations and restrictions as said Board may prescribe.\" Corporations that have entered into such an agreement or undertaking have become known as \"agreement corporations.\" The National City Bank of New York and and The First National Bank of Boston were among the first banks to have their own foreign banking corporations under this provision. Other national banks became stockholders of similar corporations, and some of them subscribed to the extent permitted by the amendment. Act of September 17, 1919. As part of a series of measures to maintain a high level of exports from the United States, legislation was enacted after World War I to facilitate long-term borrowing by Europeans through the placement of securities with private investors in the United States. The Act of September 17, 1919 amended Section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act to provide that until January 1, 1921 any national bank, with the permission of the Federal Reserve Board, could invest up to 5 per cent of its capital and surplus in the stock of corporations engaged in \"international or foreign financial operations\" necessary to facilitate American exports. No corporations of this type were formed or owned by member banks. The Edge Act. The Act of December 24, 1919, commonly called the Edge Act for Senator Edge of New Jersey, added Section 25(a) to the Federal Reserve Act. This section authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to charter corporations \"for the purpose of engaging in international or foreign banking or other international or foreign financial operations . . . either directly or through the agency, ownership, or control of local institutions in foreign countries . . . and to act when required by the Secretary of the Treasury as fiscal agents of the United States. . . .\" The Federally chartered corporations to be organized under the Edge Act were required to have a minimum capital of $2 million, with the controlling interests held by United States citizens, and were made subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. Regulation K, first issued by the Board in 1*920, distinguished between \"foreign banking\" (the creation of bankers' acceptances and receipts of deposits) and \"foreign financial operations\" (investmenttype operations, such as the issuance of their own obligations or the selling of foreign securities with their guaranty). Corporations chartered by the Board under these provisions are commonly referred to as \"Edge corporations.\" The discussions and debates that led to passage of the Edge Act reflected the American tradition of opposition to concentration of power. One question raised at the time was whether the proposed Act would encourage monopoly or branch banking in the United States. Sponsors of the Act pointed out its safeguards, including the limitations on activities of Edge corporations in the United States. In a further attempt to allay misgivings and emphasize the limitations, the authorization for the corporations to engage \"principally in international or foreign banking\" was changed, first by the Senate and then by the House, by striking out the word \"principally\" as the bill passed through 1289 UNITED STATES BANKING ORGANIZATION ABROAD Congress. Agreement and Edge corporations have been permitted a certain flexibility of operation that has helped United States banks to meet foreign competition and to engage in activities which, while customary in foreign markets, are unnecessary or unusual within the United States. FOREIGN OFFICES The number of foreign offices operated by United States commercial banks and foreign banking corporations expanded rapidly between 1916 and 1920 and reached a peak in the latter year. The number of foreign offices was reduced by the depressions of the early twenties and the thirties as well as by uncertainties in the ensuing years. World War II led to the closing of a number of branches abroad, but renewed interest in the foreign field has led to expansion of branches abroad in recent years.

The largest number is now represented by direct branches of United States commercial banks. Currently three national banks (First National City Bank of New York; First National Bank of Boston; Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, San Francisco) and four State banks (Chase Manhattan Bank, Bankers Trust Company, Guaranty Trust Company, and Hanover Bank, all in New York) engage in banking abroad through direct branches. Seven foreign banking and financing corporations are maintained by United States banks. First National City Bank of New York and First National Bank of Boston each operate one State chartered agreement corporation—International Banking Corporation and First of Boston International Corporation, respectively. Bankers Trust Company and J. P. Morgan & Co., Incorporated (both in New York) also operate agreement corporations—Bankers Company of New York, and Morgan & Cie. Incorporated. Chase Manhattan Bank, in New York, is associated with two Edge corporations: The Chase Bank, which it wholly owns, and the American Overseas Finance Corporation, which it established in 1955 jointly with four other banks having substantial foreign business. Bank of America NT & SA owns Bank of America, New York, an Edge corporation.1 FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES The passage of legislation related to foreign subsidiaries of United States banks and the growth of foreign trade and investment resulted in a rapid expansion of foreign banking and financing corporations during World War I and in postwar years. Altogether, 18 corporations were organized between 1919 and 1929, of which 15 were established under State charters and operated under agreements with the Board and three were chartered by the Board under Section 25 (a) of the Federal Reserve Act. The organization and activities of selected foreign banking corporations during this period are described on pages 1292-95. Most of the corporations formed in these early years represented the combined interests of various United States banks, some 1 Table 1 on p. 1296 lists branches of United States banks and banking corporations as of Nov. 30, 1956. Table 2 lists agreement and Edge corporations currently engaged in active operations. Table 3 lists former corporations whose operations have been discontinued. For a comparative analysis of international activities of United States banks and of banks of different nationalities, see the article \"United States Banks and Foreign Trade Financing\" in the Federal Reserve BULLETIN, April 1955, pp. 357-67. 1290 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • DECEMBER 1956 of them were jointly owned with foreign participants, and a few were wholly owned subsidiaries of leading banks in New York and Boston. Most of these corporations conducted a general foreign banking business, and their branches were located throughout Latin America, in the Far East, and in important European cities. Sixteen of these corporations had been liquidated by the early thirties or absorbed by other corporations or by banks, which in many cases took over some of the offices and continued part of the business of the former institutions. In addition to the two remaining corporations, only two agreement and three Edge corporations have been established since 1930 and continue operations at the present time. The experience of foreign banking corporations in these early years was not as successful as had been hoped, and a number of the corporations which had set up establishments abroad closed with losses to shareholders. Some corporations did not open foreign branches, but directed their business to foreign correspondents. Other corporations did not develop or maintain a sufficient volume of foreign business to warrant their existence. Nevertheless, the experience of these years was reflected in additional foreign facilities, some improvement in banking practices, and recognition of the problems and hazards involved in foreign financing. A number of explanations have been advanced for the experience of foreign banking corporations in this period. The beginnings of many of these corporations coincided with the decline in foreign trade during the economic crisis of 1920-21, and their difficulties were continued by the instability of world prices in later years. Too great reliance on untested techniques, together with shortages of experienced personnel, contributed to unsuccessful operations, which in turn affected attitudes toward this type of institution. At the same time, leading United States banks expanded their own foreign departments, thus providing to a greater extent the credit and related facilities that international business required. These developments tended to reduce the need for some of the special functions of the corporations. Also, there was some feeling during the 1920's that foreign markets could be satisfactorily serviced and financed through their own local institutions. In the last analysis, there was some doubt among American bankers whether the additional business obtained by direct operations abrbad would compensate for the loss of business received from foreign correspondent banks. The depression of the 1930's and widespread systems of exchange and trade controls diminished foreign trade and interest in foreign banking. World War II further reduced the number of establishments abroad and temporarily precluded interest in foreign expansion. CURRENT OPERATIONS In recent years the growth of United States trade and investments overseas, together with the gradual liberalization and stabilization of foreign currencies, has resulted in renewed interest in foreign banking. New Edge corporations of the banking and financing types were formed in 1949 and 1955, and older Edge and agreement corporations have shown a tendency to expand their operations. The First National Bank of Boston has operated its affiliate, First of Boston International Corporation, since 1918, and has channeled part of its business with its direct UNITED STATES BANKING ORGANIZATION ABROAD branches in Latin America and its foreign correspondents there and elsewhere through the affiliate. Bank of America NT & SA of San Francisco has operated its affiliate Bank of America, New York, for similar purposes since it was established in 1949. Unlike First of Boston International Corporation, however, Bank of America, New York, maintains four branches and other facilities abroad and holds minority participation in three foreign financial institutions—IberoAmerika Bank A.G. (Bremen), Descuento Agricola S.A. (Mexico D.F.), and Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited (Bombay). First of Boston International Corporation and Bank of America, New York, have their principal offices in New York, which they regard as important for the conduct of their foreign business. This preference for New York, rather than for the centers in which the parent institutions are located, arises in large part from the flow of commercial and financial business through that city, and in part from the prevailing view, in the United States and overseas, that a New York office is essential for efficient service in the handling of international transactions. Since the transfer of its foreign branches to the parent institution in the mid-twenties, the International Banking Corporation— foreign affiliate of First National City Bank of New York—has conducted limited banking business and has served primarily administrative purposes, such as holding stock of other institutions. In September 1955 it acquired the business of the Bank of Monrovia, previously operated by the Firestone rubber interests in Liberia, and formed a new institution with a similar name under Liberian law. Unlike other foreign banking corporations, Morgan & Cie. Incorporated—affiliate 1291 of J. P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated—conducts all dealings with the public through its Paris office. The Corporation does a general banking business and, in effect, serves as a branch in Paris of the New York parent institution. Since the early fifties, The Chase Bank (owned by the Chase Manhattan Bank) has shifted its activities from commercial banking to direct investments, principally of a development nature. In 1955 it established a Canadian company, Arcturus Investment & Development Ltd., for the purpose of making investments in foreign countries. In another phase of its activity, The Chase Bank holds the stock of a foreign fiduciary affiliate, The Chase Manhattan Executor and Trustee Corporation Limited, London, formed in 1930, which conducts the trust work of the London branch of Chase Manhattan Bank and a limited amount of trust work in Canada. Bankers Company of New York performs the same functions for Bankers Trust Company, holding the stock of Bankers Trustee and Executor Co., Ltd., in London, which was organized in 1938. This arrangement is used to permit these banks to offer in England trust services, which can only be performed by English corporations. The Guaranty Executor and Trustee Company Limited, established in 1925, performs the same services in London for its stockholder, Guaranty Trust Company of New York. Because of the provisions of the Banking Act of 1933 prohibiting member banks from purchasing stock except in certain limited cases, member banks may acquire shares of foreign fiduciary affiliates only through foreign banking corporations. A foreign financing corporation, American Overseas Finance Corporation, was organized in 1955 by Chase Manhattan Bank, 1292 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • DECEMBER 1956 New York, Chemical Corn Exchange Bank, New York, First National Bank of Boston, Mellon National Bank and Trust Company, Pittsburgh, and National Bank of Detroit. It is the first private institution of this type organized to assist United States manufacturers and exporters by providing intermediate and longer term credit on terms longer than those normally extended by commercial banks. The growth of activities of American banks in the foreign field since the end of the war has progressed with the gradual stabilization of the world economy. The increased interest of United States banks in a wider range of foreign activities tends to fill certain gaps in the financial facilities available to United States businessmen, and to strengthen the banks' relations with financial institutions in foreign countries. NOTE ON FOREIGN BANKING CORPORATIONS, 1915-30 Foreign banking corporations have been formed for a variety of purposes, have operated in various ways, and have experienced diverse problems. In most cases these corporations have been organized by banks, State and national, in New York, Boston, and other important financial centers. Several of the corporations have been wholly owned subsidiaries. In most instances, however, the initiating banks have invited their correspondents to join in the enterprise, and so banks in many sections of the country have participated in varying degrees in both capital and management. Sometimes one or more New York banks have joined with banks located in a particular area of the United States having common interests in trade relations with a particular part of the world. At least one corporation was formed as the result of a community of interests between United States and foreign financial groups. The initiative in forming corporations has not always come from the large financial centers; on occasion it has come from banks in an area concerned with financing particular internationally traded commodities. United States banks have used these affiliated corporations to expand foreign banking activities in several ways. In some cases the corporations established foreign branches or acquired participation in or control of foreign banks with branches, which later were converted into direct branches of the parent bank. Many direct branches currently in operation were developed in this way. In other cases the parent bank has shared business with foreign correspondents and overseas branches with an affiliate: this has been the practice of First of Boston International Corporation and Bank of America, New York. Seventeen corporations established under State charters have operated under agreements with the Board. Thirteen of these have been liquidated or absorbed by other corporations or by banks, and the imporant parts of their business or branches were continued by successor institutions. The majority of the corporations were established in the years 1917-22, although two of the four State corporations active today were not established until 1931 and 1941. Only six Edge corporations have been established. Three were formed in the 1920's and were liquidated after five or more years of operation. Other corporations were proposed in this early period and some of these went through early stages of organization, but were not completed. The UNITED STATES BANKING ORGANIZATION ABROAD three Edge corporations currently active were formed in 1930, 1949, and 1955. Operations of selected corporations. The past operations of foreign banking corporations show the diversity of functions for which they have been used. The banking business of three of the most important corporations that operated in the years between 1915 and 1930 was taken over and continued by United States banks. International Banking Corporation was established in 1901. It was acquired in 1915 by National City Bank of New York, which used it until 1930 as the channel for a broad foreign banking business. In 1924 the Corporation acquired the business of Asia Banking Corporation, which had absorbed part of the activities of Park Union Banking Corporation when it was liquidated in 1922. International Banking Corporation also participated in organizing or was a stockholder in several of the foreign banking corporations established during the 1920's. The stock of two subsidiaries of National City Bank—International Finance Company and Bank of Haiti—was in 1930 concentrated in the Corporation to simplify management. Since that time the Corporation has been used for administrative purposes to a large extent. International Banking Corporation, as noted earlier, was the first American banking institution to establish a system of foreign branches. The charter granted by Connecticut in 1901 was broad in scope. The Corporation was organized principally to develop and service American trade with China and the Philippine Islands, but it soon expanded and established branches in other parts of Asia. Subsequently, branches were established in Panama as an aid to the United States Government in connection with the construction 1293 of the Panama Canal. After becoming affiliated with National City Bank it established a number of branches in Latin America, in Spain, and at additional points in the Far East. Most of these branches were eventually transferred to National City Bank and thus became direct branches of that bank, now First National City Bank of New York. Mercantile Bank of the Americas was the earliest of the banking corporations established with participation of member banks of the Federal Reserve System. It was chartered under Connecticut law in 1915, having been sponsored initially by two private banking firms—Brown Brothers and J. & W. Seligman, and Guaranty Trust Company. Later a number of national and State banks joined in the ownership of this bank. Mercantile Bank of the Americas created a number of affiliated corporations under State charter and gained control of some existing foreign banks, in addition to establishing a few direct branches. The bank operated on the theory that since countries differ as regards banking laws, currency, and customs, a separate institution should be formed to operate within each country. These institutions were under joint American and local management. Mercantile Bank developed an extensive business, including usual banking operations as well as related activities to facilitate trade and development abroad. The decline in value and volume of South American exports after the crisis of 1920, however, led to reorganization of the bank in 1922 as Bank of Central and South America, which continued operations on a reduced scale. When this bank was liquidated in 1925, the Latin American branches were acquired by Royal Bank of Canada. 1294 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • DECEMBER 1956 French American Banking Corporation was established in New York in 1919 and at that time was owned half by Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris and half equally by First National Bank of Boston and National Bank of Commerce, New York. It was particularly concerned with the development of trade relations between the United States and France and her colonies. When National Bank of Commerce merged with Guaranty Trust Company, the Guaranty assumed its share in ownership. United States banks' interest in this corporation continued until 1947, when they sold their holdings to Banque de l'lndochine, Paris. This led to the termination of the agreement with the Board of Governors, but the Corporation continues its activities in New York under foreign ownership. Equitable Eastern Banking Corporation was created by Equitable Trust Company, a New York bank, in 1920, with the participation of several banks on the Pacific Coast. The Corporation, formed for the purpose of handling the Equitable's Far Eastern banking business, opened branches in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Tientsin. Its major business was dealing in silver bullion and Hong Kong dollars, although it also conducted foreign trade financing. After acquisition of Equitable Trust Company in 1930, Chase National Bank continued the operation of these offices as branches of its affiliate, The Chase Bank, until developments following World War II forced their closing. International Acceptance Bank was organized under New York State laws in 1921 by a group of private financiers (led by Paul M. Warburg) and banks (First National Bank of Boston and others); its shares were ultimately distributed in the United States and Europe. This Bank conducted acceptance business and developed a large volume of general banking business, becoming one of the largest foreign banking corporations. It established a representative's office in London, and acquired stock in three trade and finance subsidiaries here and abroad. In 1929 stockholders agreed to exchange their holdings for stock of Bank of Manhattan Company of New York, which thus became the sole owner and eventually absorbed the business of the Acceptance Bank. Corporations for administrative purposes. Foreign banking corporations have been established as holding companies for special administrative purposes. Among these were International Finance Company (formerly Citibank of New York in France S.A.) and Bank of Haiti, both owned by National City Bank, and The Chase Bank, owned by Chase National Bank. Before the income tax convention between France and the United States, foreign banks in France were taxed on the basis of that proportion of earnings considered by the French fiscal authorities to have accrued from operations of the banks' offices in France. In order to meet this tax problem, National City Bank set up a subsidiary (Citibank of New York in France, later renamed the International Finance Company) to operate a Paris office. Similarly, Chase National Bank acquired control of a branch in Paris, formerly belonging to the Equitable Trust Company, through The Chase Bank. Bank of Haiti was formed by National City Bank of New York in 1925 to acquire and hold the stock of Banque Nationale de la Republique d'Haiti, whose activities, since its opening in 1922, had been under the supervision of National City Bank. Banque Nationale was bank of issue and fiscal agent for the Haitian Government, and it operated a system of branches in UNITED STATES BANKING ORGANIZATION ABROAD Haiti. In 1930 International Banking Corporation acquired the stock of Bank of Haiti and in 1935 sold Banque Nationale to the Haitian Government. Other corporations. Federal International Banking Corporation, whose principal office was in New Orleans, was formed in 1920, chiefly at the initiative of banks in cottongrowing States. Its objective was to secure more adequate credit facilities for the export of cotton, tobacco, and lumber. The Corporation was liquidated in 1925. National Shawmut Bank, Boston, together with other Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and 1295 New York banks, organized The Shawmut Corporation in 1919 for the purpose of handling business with foreign correspondents. With the decline in foreign banking in the early 1920's, the other banks withdrew and The Shawmut Bank took over the foreign business and turned the Corporation to operations in the domestic money market —buying and selling acceptances and investments. The Corporation requested the Federal Reserve Board to cancel its agreement in 1929; it discontinued its active operations in 1934, and was completely liquidated in 1944.

Commitments to extend additional credit to these lenders declined $270 million to $794 million. The major portion of the $59 million increase in loans was a $37 million increase to mortgage companies secured by the pledge of real estate mortgage loans owned by the borrowers. The decline in commitments to extend additional credit largely reflects the expiration of an unused commitment to one institution. The foregoing information was obtained by a special survey of all types of credit extended by commercial banks to real estate mortgage lenders. Results of earlier surveys have been published in the September 1956 and earlier Federal Reserve BULLETINS.

No change was made in the maximum 1 % rate payable on time deposits of less than 90 days. The maximum rates of interest payable by member banks are contained in the Supplement to the Board's Regulation Q, the revised text of which is as follows: SUPPLEMENT TO REGULATION Q Pursuant to the provisions of section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act and section 3 of its Regulation Q, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System hereby prescribes the following maximum rates 1 of interest payable by member banks of the Federal Reserve System on time and savings deposits: (1) Maximum rate of 3 per cent.—No member bank shall pay interest accruing at a rate in excess of 3 per cent per annum compounded quarterly,2 regardless of the basis upon which such interest may be computed,— (A) On any savings deposit, (B) On any time deposit having a maturity date six months or more after the date of deposit or payable upon written notice of six months or more. (C) On any Postal Savings deposit which constitutes a time deposit. (2) Maximum rate of 2% per cent.—No member bank shall pay interest accruing at a rate in excess of V/i per cent per annum, compounded quarterly,2 regardless of the basis upon which such interest may be computed,— (A) On any time deposit (except Postal Savings deposits which constitute time deposits) having a maturity date less than six months and not less than 90 days after the date of deposit or payable upon written notice of less than six months and not less than 90 days. (3) Maximum rate of 1 per cent.—No member bank shall pay interest accruing at a rate in excess of 1 per cent per annum, compounded quarterly,2 regardless of the basis upon which such interest may be computed,— (A) On any time deposit (except Postal Savings deposits which constitute time deposits) having a maturity date less than 90 days after the date of deposit or payable upon written notice of less than 90 days. Corporations Doing Foreign Banking or Other Foreign Financing Under the Federal Reserve Act The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, effective January 15, 1957, revised Regulation K which relates to Corporations doing foreign banking or other foreign financing under sections 25 or 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act. This revision clarifies and makes more specific the rules applicable to such Corporations, particularly the rules relating to their activities in the United States. The text of the revised regulation is as follows: 1 The maximum rates of interest payable by member banks of the Federal Reserve System on time and savings deposits as prescribed herein are not appplicable to any deposit which is payable only at an office of a member bank located outside of the States of the United States and the District of Columbia. 2 This limitation is not to be interpreted as preventing the compounding of interest at other than quarterly intervals, provided that the aggregate amount of such interest so compounded does not exceed the aggregate amount of interest at the rate above prescribed when compounded quarterly. REGULATION K SECTION 1. SCOPE AND APPLICATION OF REGULATION This regulation is issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (hereinafter called the \"Board of Governors\") under authority of the Federal Reserve Act. It applies to corporations organized under section 25(a) of that Act (U.S.C., title 12, sees. 611-631) for the pur- 1301 1302 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • DECEMBER 1956 pose of engaging in international or foreign banking or other international or foreign financial operations, and to the extent specified in section 11 of this regulation, to corporations having an agreement or undertaking with the Board of Governors under section 25 of the Act (U.S.C., title 12, sees. 601-604). Pertinent portions of those sections are printed in the Appendix to this regulation. SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS For the purpose of this regulation, unless the context otherwise requires— (a) \"Corporation\" when spelled with a capital \"C\" means a corporation organized under section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act. (b) \"Banking\" means the business of receiving or paying out deposits, or accepting drafts or bills of exchange. (c) '*Banking Corporation\" means a Corporation which is engaged in banking. (d) \"Financing Corporation\" means a Corporation which is not engaged in banking except to the extent that it is required by the Secretary of the Treasury to act as fiscal agent of the United States. A Corporation in existence on July 1, 1955 is a Banking Corporation if it was engaged in banking on that date, or a Financing Corporation if not so engaged on that date. (e) \"Abroad\" means in one or more foreign countries or dependencies or insular possessions of the United States. (/) \"Goods\" includes wares, merchandise, commodities and any other tangible personal property (other than money). (g) \"Persons\" includes any individual, and any corporation, partnership, association or other similar organization.

(i) \"Capital and surplus\" means (1) paid in and unimpaired capital and (2) surplus. SECTION 3. ORGANIZATION, CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND OWNERSHIP (a) Articles of association and organization certificate.—Any number of natural persons, not less than five, desiring to organize a corporation under section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act shall (1) enter into articles of association (see Form F. R. 151, which is suggested as a satisfactory form of articles of association); (2) make an organization certificate on Form F. R. 152, which is made a part of this regulation; and (3) forward the articles of association and the organization certificate to the Board of Governors. The articles of association shall specify in general terms the objects for which the Corporation is formed, and may contain any other provisions not inconsistent with law which the Corporation may see fit to adopt for the regulation of its business and the conduct of its affairs. Each person intending to participate in the organization of the Corporation shall sign the articles of association and the organization certificate and shall acknowledge the execution of the latter before a judge of some court of record or notary public, who shall certify thereto under the seal of such court or notary. (b) Name.—The name of the Corporation is subject to the approval of the Board of Governors, and a preliminary application for that approval may be filed with the Board of Governors on Form F. R. 150, which is made a part of this regulation. The name shall in no case resemble the name of any other corporation to the extent that it might result in misleading or deceiving the public as to its identity, purpose, connections or affiliations, and in the case of an application with respect to a Financing Corporation the name shall also comply with section 10(c)(2). The name of any Corporation hereafter organized shall so far as practicable indicate the nature of the business contemplated, and shall include the word \"international\", \"foreign\", \"overseas\", or some similar word. No Financing Corporation hereafter organized will be permitted to have the word \"bank\" or \"banking\", or any similar word, as part of its name. (c) Authority to commence business.—After the articles of association and organization certificate have been filed with and approved by, and a preliminary permit to begin business has been issued by, the Board of Governors, the association shall become and be a body corporate, but none of its powers, except such as are incidental and preliminary to its organization, shall be exercised until the Board of Governors has issued to it a final permit to commence business. Before the Board of Governors will issue its final permit to commence business, the president, cashier or secretary, together with at least three of the directors, must certify (1) that each director is a citizen of the United States; (2) that a majority of the shares 1303 LAW DEPARTMENT of capital stock is held and owned by citizens of the United States, by corporations the controlling interest in which is owned by citizens of the United States, chartered under the laws of the United States or of a State of the United States, or by firms or companies the controlling interest in which is owned by citizens of the United States; and (3) that of the authorized capital stock specified in the articles of association at least 25 per cent has been paid in in cash and that each shareholder has individually paid in in cash at least 25 per cent of his stock subscription. Thereafter the cashier or secretary shall certify to the payment of the remaining installments as and when each is paid in, in accordance with law. (d) Amendments to articles of association.—The articles of association may contain provisions relative to the procedure whereby amendments thereof may be effected in any manner not inconsistent with section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, other applicable law, and this regulation. No amendment of the articles of association shall become effective unless and until it shall have been approved by the Board of Governors. (e) General requirements as to capital stock.—No Corporation may be organized under section 25(a) with capital stock of less than $2,000,000. The par value of each share of stock shall be specified in the articles of association, and no Corporation will be permitted to issue stock of no par value. If there is more than one class of stock, the name and amount of each class and the obligations, rights, and privileges attaching thereto shall be set forth fully in the articles of association. Each class of stock shall be so named, or so described in the stock certificates by which it is represented, as to indicate as clearly as possible its character and any unusual attributes. (/) Citizenship of shareholders.—(1) In order to insure compliance at all times with the requirements of section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act relating to the United States citizenship of those who hold, own, or control a majority of the shares of capital stock of a Corporation, such stock shall be issuable and transferable only on the books of the Corporation, and no issue or transfer of stock which would cause a violation of such requirements of law or of related provisions of this regulation shall be made upon the books of the Corporation. The board of directors of the Corporation, acting directly or through an agent, may, before making any issue or transfer of stock, require such evidence as in their discretion they may think necessary in order to determine whether or not the issue or transfer of the stock would result in such a violation. The decision of the board of directors in each such case shall be final and conclusive as to, and not subject to question by, any person. (2) If at any time a change in the status of the holder of any shares of a Corporation causes a violation of the requirements of section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act relating to the United States citizenship of those who hold, own, or control a majority of the shares of capital stock of a Corporation, the board of directors shall, when apprised of that fact, forthwith serve on the holder of the shares in question a notice in writing requiring such holder within two months to transfer such shares to a person then eligible to acquire such shares. When such notice has been given by the board of directors, the shares of stock so held shall cease to confer any right to vote or to participate in dividends thereafter declared; and the right to vote and to receive dividends shall resume only after, and only with respect to votes cast and dividends declared after, the shares have been transferred as required above. If on the expiration of two months after such notice the shares shall not have been so transferred, the shares shall promptly be sold at public or private sale by the Corporation, as agent for and for the account of the ineligible holder, to a person then eligible to acquire such shares. In the event such shares cannot be sold for a reasonable price and within a reasonable time at such a public or private sale, the shares will, with the approval of the Board of Governors, be forfeited to the Corporation. (3) The board of directors shall prescribe in the by-laws of the Corporation appropriate rules for the registration of the shares of stock in accordance with the terms of the law and these regulations. The certificates of stock issued by the Corporation shall contain provisions sufficient to put the holder on notice of the terms of the law and regulations defining the limitations upon the rights of ownership and transfer. SECTION 4. BANKING CORPORATIONS AND FINANCING CORPORATIONS A Banking Corporation (a) shall not issue or have outstanding any debentures, bonds, promis- 1304 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • DECEMBER 1956 sory notes or similar obligations except promissory notes due within one year evidencing borrowing from banks or bankers, and (b) shall not engage in the business of issuing, underwriting, selling or distributing securities, except to such limited extent as the Board of Governors may, upon application of the Corporation, exempt activities of the Corporation's branch or agency in a foreign country with respect to obligations of, or obligations unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the national government of such country. A Financing Corporation shall not engage in banking except to the extent that it is required by the Secretary of the Treasury to act as fiscal agent of the United States. The Board of Governors may grant permission, subject to such conditions as it may prescribe, for a Banking Corporation to change to a Financing Corporation, or for the reverse. SECTION 5. OPERATIONS ABROAD (a) General.—Except as otherwise provided by law or by this regulation, a Corporation may exercise abroad, through branches or agencies established with the approval of the Board of Governors or through correspondents or other agents, not only the powers specifically set forth in the law or by this regulation and those incidental thereto, but also such powers as may be usual in the determination of the Board of Governors in connection with the transaction of banking in the case of a Banking Corporation, or other financial operations in the case of a Financing Corporation, in the place in which the Corporation is transacting business. As indicated in section 6(e) (2), the activities of a Financing Corporation abroad are limited by the requirement that it shall not, by its activities abroad, engage or participate, directly or indirectly, in certain activities in the United States. (b) Branches.—With the prior approval of the Board of Governors, a Corporation may establish branches or agencies abroad. SECTION 6. LIMITED OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES (a) General.—A Corporation shall not carry on any part of its business in the United States except such as shall be incidental to its international or foreign business. It may not engage in the United States in the business of acting as trustee, or in a like fiduciary capacity, or act in the United States as registrar or in any similar capacity with respect to the servicing in the United States of any security issue distributed therein; but it may act as paying agent in the United States with respect to securities issued by a \"foreign state\" as defined in section 25(b) of the Federal Reserve Act or by a corporation chartered by such a foreign state and not qualified under the laws of the United States or any State (or the District of Columbia) to do business in the United States. A Corporation may not establish any branch in the United States, but with the prior approval of the Board of Governors may establish agencies in the United States for specific purposes, but not generally to carry on the business of the Corporation. Funds of a Corporation not currently employed in the international or foreign business of the Corporation in accordance with other provisions of this regulation, if held or invested in the United States, shall be only in the fo"
