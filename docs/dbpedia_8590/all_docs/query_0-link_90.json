        "text": "Boomi is a business unit acquired by Dell in 2010 that specializes in integration platform as a service (iPaaS), API management, Master Data Management and data preparation.[2][3][4] Boomi was founded in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, and first launched its services in 2007.[5][6]\n\nHistory\n\nBoomi was founded in 2000, beginning with \"configuration-based\" integration. Its technology allows users to build and deploy integration processes using a visual interface and a drag and drop technique. This interface remains one of the key elements of the current Boomi platform. The company was named after Bhūmi, the Hindu goddess representing Mother Earth.[7]\n\nIn 2007, Boomi released the technology now known as \"AtomSphere,\" an Integration Cloud. AtomSphere kept the visual, point and click interface for building integrations and can be managed through a browser-based UI.[8]\n\nOn November 2, 2010, Boomi announced its acquisition by Dell.[9]\n\nIn March 2017, Boomi acquired cloud-development platform company ManyWho.[10]\n\nIn December 2019, Boomi acquired Unifi Software.[11][12]\n\nIn February 2020, Boomi released its Integration Center of Excellence (ICoE) service.[13]\n\nAs of March 2020, Boomi has approximately 1,300 employees and 11,000 customers.[14]\n\nOn May 2, 2021, It was announced that Francisco Partners and TPG Capital had entered into a definitive agreement with Dell Technologies to acquire Boomi.[15]\n\nPlatform\n\nBoomi provides an integration platform as a service (iPaaS), which enables the connection of applications and data sources.[16] It is a low-code development platform.[17] The platform provides API, lifecycle management and event-driven architecture features for cloud integration.[18] This includes an API Proxy, API Gateway and API Developer Portal.[18]\n\nThe platform also supports event-driven architectures.[18] Boomi's EDA partners include Dell EMC and Solace as well as vendors specializing in message brokers, event meshes, streaming and pub/sub technology.[18] The platform also offers integrations for Amazon SQS, Microsoft's Azure Service Bus services and Pivotal's RabbitMQ.[18]\n\nAfter Boomi acquired Unifi Software, Boomi incorporated data discovery, catalog and preparation tools into its platform, and continues to offer Unifi as a stand-alone product.[2][1]\n\nIn August 2019, Boomi’s iPaaS was authorized by FedRAMP.[19]\n\nBoomi's platform is currently being used by the American Cancer Society, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Gilead Sciences, International Justice Mission, Novartis, Sky Group and University of Technology Sydney.[20][21][22][23][24]\n\nThe ICoE service run by Boomi provides reusable frameworks and industry guidelines for integration.[13]\n\nReferences"
