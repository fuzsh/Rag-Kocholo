        "text": "Part XIV\n\nReality...\n\nHere is Reality; No one likes reality. It is much easier to live in an illusion, such as the United States, than face reality. The problem with this is that reality does not change, nor does it forgive. It is a constant, and will reassert itself at some point. With or without your knowledge or understanding. And it does not matter if you are ready for it or not, because if you are living in an illusion, when reality kills you, you will not even be aware of the how and the why. But you will be just as dead, and just as unprepared.\n\n\"Tyranny has no enemy so formidable as the pen.\" William Cobbett\n\n\"None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.\" Goethe\n\n\"If a nation values anything more than freedom, it will lose its freedom; and the irony of it is that if it is comfort or money that it values more, it will lose that too.\" Somerset Maugham\n\n\"As nightfall does not come at once, neither does oppression. In both instances there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged. And it is in such twilight that we all must be most aware of change in the air - however slight - lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness.\" Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas\n\nHere is some reality; food has two purposes: It can either sustain life, or kill you. Food can serve no other purpose than these two. It is impossible.\n\nIn this regard, there is no nutrition in canned food. So, given this fact which you can confirm by studying the many books on health and nutrition available, what is the purpose of canned food? Right; profit. It serves no other function. Certainly, it serves no purpose in sustaining life.\n\nThus, when you buy all of your food in a multi-national profit center known as a \"supermarket\", what, exactly, are you doing to yourself and your family?\n\nLet me list the major components of food found in supermarkets (perhaps you should start paying attention to the labels); processed white sugar (probably the single largest component); processed white flour (probably number two); processed fats; processed plastics (every artificial ingredient is a derivative, as far as I know, of oil, which means plastic; after all, this is by far the cheapest way to create a saleable product); pork (you would be surprised, and shocked, at how much pork is used in foods, most always under different names. For instance, marshmallows are made from a base of pork lard.); and, of course, chemicals. Let us never forget chemicals.\n\nAnd of the \"stuff\" (I dont know what it is, but it is not \"food\", so stuff seems appropriate) not affected above, how about irradiation to prolong the shelf life? Most spices are this way now, and, I am sure, many other foods as well, including most so-called \"fresh\" fruits and vegetables. Not to mention what has been done to the meat with hormones and drugs for the animals. I have a couple of friends who took a Geiger counter into a supermarket a while back. They wont eat anything out of one any longer (they didnt believe me).\n\nOne of the things most amazing to me is our \"belief\" that something labeled as food is actually food because of the taste, rather than as a matter of nutrition. I watch people ending their lives in great pain, crippled in mind and body, and recognize that there, except for the Grace of God, go I. And I know that what has happened is because we have trusted others to look after our well-fare, and then allowed those others to do so for their own economic interest. And I also know that those others, the ones at the top of the food chain, so to speak, understand exactly what they are doing, the pain they are causing, and the needless early deaths that are the result of their economic warfare.\n\nSo, once you begin to understand, the command to be separate from \"them\" is not a racial command; it is for health and for wealth. You can not feed the beast through profits on the food he produces for profit and be either healthy or wealthy. This, my friends, is a scientific fact, which you can confirm with very little study. The problem is that most writers, counselors and advisors will not put it in this way. They will tell you to buy your food carefully, and study the labels, maybe from a health food store (which is in business for profit), but no source I know of will give you a complete picture. First, they probably do not understand most of the picture because they learned enough to make some money so why continue, and second, because this information is not palatable to most, and they do not want to offend their customers. It limits sales, particularly of books.\n\nLet me give you another look at Scripture from my view point. At the beginning of Part X, I quoted Scripture, about food. In Scripture, we are given a list of foods we may eat. We can have faith, without further study, that this list of food, without alteration from man, and this includes hybridization, is beneficial for our bodies. Given a few other facts, such as direct from the ground to us and without being in cold storage for 30 or 60 days before it reaches our \"store\" and without the addition of chemicals, additives and irradiation.\n\nIn other words, natural foods without the profit motive having been added in.\n\nBut then we are told of other foods that we can not eat. Oh, we can, of course, if we wish to. Like mushrooms. I know, Scripture says nothing about mushrooms, but it does speak of fruits and other things that are good, and it does not mention fungus, like mushrooms. What can we deduce from this?\n\nWell, if foods that are good for us are beneficial, then other \"things\" put on this earth for other purposes are not beneficial for us to eat. That means we can gain nothing from eating them. Nothing. And after having seen the writings on the studies done with pork, and how our bodies can not digest pork, I begin to understand. Eating those other \"things\" is no different than eating poison, because if there is no benefit, under His Law in the eating, then it is safe to assume, vengeance being His, that there is a decided down side to doing the eating. I think that our reduced life span and the great pain I see many people in as their years advance is all of the warning I need.\n\nThese are the things that the \"churches\" should be teaching us, and this is the first reason I left the Catholic church. As I began to learn some of the essential facts about health, and how they corresponded so closely with Scripture, I started to wonder what was wrong with this picture. I attended a Catholic school when I was young, went through confirmation, Communion, learned the Catechism well, served Mass, and generally did all of the things that good Catholic boys are supposed to. Except, I never learned one thing about His Law and the reasons for it. Not one thing. Oh, there was prattle about the Ten Commandments, but no real teaching of the essential nature of the law. (After learning this, when I finally found out that even the Ten Commandments had been altered by the Roman Church, I wasnt really that shocked.)\n\nWhat can we deduce from this? Religion are a work of man. Not that hard to figure out, really. What is the most wealthy organization on the face of the earth? Probably the Roman Catholic church, or religion, if you will. All of these \"religions\" will take one or two pieces of Scripture and concentrate on it, telling you, if you will listen, that this is the key to heaven, and it is the most important part of Scripture. And pass the offering plate, please. (Ive asked, but I have never gotten an answer; What, then, is the least important part of Scripture?)\n\nOn the other hand, Christianity has nothing to do with Religion. As I said before, the Bible is a book of science; His Science. The science of economics, of nutrition, of government, of nurturing the land, of... well, pretty much of everything that is essential for us to live a long, prosperous life. In other words, Christianity, through Scripture, is a way of life, and not a religion. And this is what your choice comes down to, you can not live a full, clean, prosperous life among the heathen. You must congregate with those of like mind.\n\nSo, once again, we find that the answer comes down to you. You must want to learn. You must be willing to study. You must be willing to change, or the studies will stop, and stop fast!\n\nAnd let me make one point here that is necessary at this time: Your life is going to change. Probably, it is going to change dramatically. There is no way to avoid this truth. If you had the understanding that I do of economics, you would see as clearly as I do this fact of life. The only thing for you to decide is if you and your family are to be the agents of that change, or if you are going to let other, outside forces bring the change to you. Because change you will.\n\nAre you worried about your children being able to attend college? Why? What is taught in colleges today? What real life skills are taught in schools today? Do your children really need to learn how to prosper in a credit world? A credit world is an illusion; it is an aberration, which does not exist in the real world. It depends upon the predation of the earth and of those who work and produce from the earth for the survival of the system. History has proven time and time again that these types of systems only exist for short periods of time. America is no longer a producer, and we are told time and time again that we can survive as a service and information nation. But this is true only as long as the true producers of real food and real material wealth do not catch on to the lie that is known as the Federal Reserve Note.\n\nThe United States is now the largest debtor nation on the face of the earth, by a large margin. The United States has, by far, the largest imbalance of trade in history. This is the reason for the new international reserve currency, the Euro. More on this later. All of these things again bring us to the illusion that is known as the United States.\n\nCOMMENTS:\n\n[APFN NOTE] Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen (Former longtime Senator form Texas) During the Waco hearings had to take the \"OATH of TESTIMONY\" before the committee after a heated discussion. The first video about Waco provided by Dr. Gregg Sali & Ken Fawcett had a researcher providing documented proof that the Secretary of the Treasury did not take the \"OATH OF OFFICE\" to the United States of America. He takes an \"Oath of Officer\" to the \"International Monetary Fund\" (IMF). This researcher further states that all Treasury takes that Oath. This would include the BATF and the IRS. Thousands of people have seen that video. I have not seen any follow-up to the fact or fiction to the above. APFN@netbox.com\n\nPlease be advised that the information above is true. Simply stated, there is NO OATH of Office for \"Secretary of Treasury\", and the reason why there isn't will become clear after reading the material that follows. What you will find is an appointment as \"Governor\" of The Fund and The Bank, which is all under the UNITED NATIONS Monetary and Financial Conference dated July 22, 1944. (See: 22 USC 286, 22 USC 286a(a)(b)(c)(d), 22 USC 286c, 22 USC 286d, 22 USC 286e, etc.) The title, \"Secretary of Treasury\" exists under PRETENSE of name only. From the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents for the Administration of William J. Clinton for Monday, February 1, 1993, Volume 29 - Number 4, page 113, you will find the following:\n\nSubmitted January 28\n\nLloyd Bentsen, of Texas, to be U.S. Governor of the International Monetary Fund for a term of 5 years; U.S. Governor of the International Bank For Reconstruction And Development for a term of 5 years; U.S. Governor of the Inter-American Development Bank for a term of 5 years; U.S. Governor of the African Development Bank for a term of 5 years; U.S. Governor of the Asian Development Bank; U.S. Governor of the African Development Fund; and U.S. Governor of the European Bank For Reconstruction And Development.\n\nNo where is there to be found any \"appointment\" to \"Secretary of Treasury\".\n\nOfficers of the United States are required pursuant to 5 USC 3331 to subscribe to an Oath of Office, to file an Officer Affidavit pursuant to 5 USC 3332, and an Employee Affidavit pursuant to 5 USC 3333.\n\nSince some of those on your list may not have the ability to receive attachments, I have assembled here a few excerpts from several monograms on related subject matter that will reveal some of the more important elements. The thing to keep in mind while reading the following material is that the ENTIRE governmental structure as ordained and established by the Constitution FOR the United States of America (1787) has been SUBJUGATED and OVERTHROWN economically: (This is incorrect; the fact is that the United States corporate governemnt is the majority stock holder in the IMF. You may want to think about that; a government owning stock in a bank? Remember when I told you that the UNITED STATES was not a government? It is a corporation; corporations are formed for profit. Follow the money. Remember Part II. - David)\n\nArticle I, Section 10 of the Constitution for the United States of America declares that, \"No State shall make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.\" The emergency, subjugated, compact \"state of Washington\" is a party to the compact and the officer writing the ticket is the \"charging agent\" of the compact state. We now have a series of problems arise, as Article IV, Section 27 of the \"Constitution of the State of Washington\" (1889) states that ALL PROCESS shall be, \"The State of Washington,\" and all prosecutions shall be conducted in ITS name and by ITS AUTHORITY. The fact that the \"state of Washington\" is a party to various \"compacts\" and its use of SDR's (Federal reserve notes) means that the REAL PARTY OF INTEREST is NOT in the courtroom, and the process is NOT under its AUTHORITY. The Federal Reserve note is valued to SDR's by international organizations, not by Congress. (Technically correct, but missing the one real piece of information necessary to understand; Federal Reserve notes are valued because everyone has to have them to repay debts, for which their property is held as collateral. When this state of affairs is altered, and when Federal Reserve notes are no longer the \"reserve currency\" needed to repay debts, things will alter quickly and radically, and the real value of Federal Reserve notes will become apparent. - David)\n\nThe emergency, subjugated, compact \"state of Washington\", as the extended territory of the United States, is raising revenue and collecting FORCED CONTRIBUTIONS for and on behalf of FOREIGN PRINCIPALS, and is in fact and law, pursuant to the rule of instrumentality, the ALTER-EGO of \"The Fund\" (IMF) and \"The Bank\" (World Bank) - both of which are under the direction and control of the alien, corporate \"Governor\", a.k.a., the \"Secretary of Treasury\" who is paid by the United Nations, through its fiscal depository agent, the Federal Reserve. (Actually, the United States Treasury is now the banking apparatus for the IMF. - David) Additionally, the \"charging agent\" is receiving emoluments or remuneration from agents of a foreign principal. IF he has an Oath of Office, as required by Article VI, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution and the domestic laws made in pursuance thereof, such as 4 USC 101, he would necessarily be in felony breach of that oath. One cannot serve TWO masters. Cinema 5, Ltd. vs. Cinerama Inc., 528 F.2d 1384.\n\nFurther, much of the so-called \"federal\" funding received by the \"state of Washington\" through the Governor thereof, for and on behalf of the Criminal Justice Training Commission through which all law enforcement personnel must qualify, is administered under the Crime Control Act of 1973 and amendatory acts, by the Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno, who is the permanent representative of INTERPOL which is based in Lyons, France. Under Article 30 of the INTERPOL Constitution and regulations, agents of INTERPOL are required to renounce their allegiance to their respective Countries and State and are therefore EXPATRIATES. The Attorney General is NOT paid by the United States, but rather receives emoluments or remuneration from \"The Fund\" and \"The Bank\". The alien, corporate Governor of \"The Fund\" and \"The Bank\", Robert Rubin, is the ALTERNATE representative of INTERPOL. See: Memorandum of Understanding, U.S. Government Manual 1996/97, pg. 351.\n\nBecause the \"Treasury of the United States of America\" was DISSOLVED upon the creation of the INDEPENDENT TREASURY, by Act of Congress on May 29, 1920 (41 Stat. Chapter 214, pg. 654), neither Ms. Reno or Mr. Rubin are Officers of the United States of America. They can't be, because no viable treasury exists, one of the basic requirements of a sovereign nation. They are not paid pursuant to the Constitution for the United States of America and the domestic laws made in Pursuance thereof.\n\nThe United States REDUCED its character and capacity to that of an ALTER-EGO and PRIVATE PARTY when it became a voting share stockholder in International Organizations such as The Bank and The Fund -- UN operations (22 USC 286e). Other organizations, such as the \"Nature Conservancy\" (IUCN) organizations, and the individuals who are members of the organizations, associations and corporations, have REDUCED their characters and capacities. An artificial entity is NOT a Citizen and cannot be extended the Liberties, Rights, Privileges, Immunities and Powers of the Citizen, and when working in \"collaboration\" with or under the direction, control, or financial assistance of such International Organizations -- they become AGENTS of FOREIGN PRINCIPALS and POWERS. The Constitution for the United States of America DOES NOT DELEGATE the Power to any Public Office to create or grant such entities special privileges, immunities or franchises, nor does the Constitution for the United States of America authorize those in Public Office to INDIRECTLY commit acts which are DIRECTLY PROHIBITED. (No, but the Constitution does directly authorize Congress \"exclusive jurisdiction\" in Washington, DC, and they can do whatever they wish. This means that nothing is prohibited, and it can not be said to be un-Constitutional. Further more, this is an accurate picture of the real United States, and if anyone thinks that the King is going to give up this pot of gold without a struggle, or return freedom to those with no understanding easily, well, they have a shock coming. Everyone talking about restoring Constitutional government to America is actually providing support for exactly what they say they dislike so much. I hope you understand what I mean. - David)\n\nThose operating under the United Nations Organizations direction, control, subsidy, or financial assistance, are unlawfully within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States of America and the several States of the Union. Public Law 330, 69 Stat. 624, makes it a FELONY for ANY PERSON to accept or hold a public office or to be employed by any agency of the government who advocates the overthrow of our constitutional and Republican Form of Government in the United States, or belongs to an organization that advocates overthrow. A \"de facto\" government cannot lawfully contract or obtain dominion over property, nor are commingled \"chameleon\" like characters and capacities allowed in law and it has been determined that NO OBEDIENCE is due to such entities. Texas vs. White, 74 U.S. (7 Wall) 277. (Whew! A real mouthful, except... It is not \"them\" who violated His Laws; it is we who contracted with them. So, who is at fault? - David)\n\nThe violation of \"The Code Of Ethics For Government Service\", Public Law 96-303, 94 Stat. 855, would be obvious and appropriately applied against those who devised and conjured into existence the various \"environmental programmes\" and \"strategic plans\" -- IF -- they really were in \"Government service\" of the United States of America. The United Nations is, however, a separate entity conjured into existence through certain known, unauthorized and unconstitutional acts and omissions and by certain corrupt and profligate FACTIONSwhose interests and agenda wasadverse and diametrically opposed to the ordained Constitution for the United States of America, and the Laws made in Pursuance thereof, and to the necessary Law of Nations (The so-called Law of Nations is actually International Law under Maritime Jurisdiction, and is really Roman Church Law. - David). All of the United Nations officers, employees and agents are required to \"EXPATRIATE\" from their nation upon grounds that the United Nations and its sister International Organizations, such as The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, claim EXEMPTION from the LAWS OF ANY NATION OR STATE. There is NO ALLEGIANCE to the People or to the Union of several States of the United States of America by the denizens of the International Organizations.\n\nThe concept that the principal is not bound or obligated by the secret agreements of the agent is as old as the fundamental concept that governments are formed and established only by the CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED. It is obvious that the International Organizations, Corporations, Associations and combinations are of aristocratic form and have been historically and presently known for despotism and tyranny. The Constitution for the United States of America, Article IV, Section 4, ONLY SECURES a \"REPUBLICAN FORM\" of governance. The Organizations are UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND UNAUTHORIZED. Likewise, the principal that \"no man can serve two masters\" as applicable as the obvious conflict of allegiance and interest. No officer, employee, or agent of the United States of America is allowed to directly or indirectly act as an agent of a foreign principal, 22 USC 611. Violations are subject to criminal pains and penalties under 18 USC 219, to wit:\n\n\"WHOEVER, being an officer or employee of the United States in the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of government or in any agency of the United States, including the District of Columbia, is or acts as an agent of a foreign principal required to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.\" (See also: 18 USC 951)\n\nIt is to be specifically noted that an \"Agency\" is NOT an integral part of the government, U.S. vs. Strang, 254 U.S. 491, and raises immediate and serious questions and concern as to WHO the \"PRINCIPAL\" and real party in interest is. It is NOT the \"United States\" pursuant to the Constitution for the United States of America and the domestic Laws made in Pursuance thereof. NO, it is The World Bank and The Fund who are the true \"principal\", and it is The World Bank's POLICY that is being implemented by and through the various \"intergovernmental\" (INTERNATIONAL) agencies in accordance with the \"Brady Plan\", and pursuant to the \"Multilateral Economic Assistance Act of 1989\", Public Law 101-167, 103 Stat. 1195, and as specifically declared under the subheading of \"Environmental Concerns\" found as 103 Statutes at Large, pages 1227 and 1228. Further evidence of direct involvement by The World Bank is found in the \"Convention On Biological Diversity\", Articles 21 and 39, Treaty Document 103-20, among others.\n\nFurtherance of the scheme is evidenced by the unlawful debasement of the domestic Coin in 1965 under pretense of \"scarcity\", the disavowing and dishonoring of notes and obligations under Public Law 90-269, 82 Stat. 50, on March 18, 1968, using the same repudiated notes and obligations as a fraudulent security for international letters of credit under Special Drawing Rights Acts such as Public Law 90-349, 82 Stat. 188, June 19, 1968, embezzlement of the intrinsic metals and laying the repudiated debts and loss off on others not signatory parties nor privy to the secret meetings and agreements, all being accomplished and implemented under pretense of such Acts as the \"Par Value Modification Act\", Public Law 94-564, 90 Stat. 2660, October 19, 1976; and further, while inducing and forcing others to aid and abet in the systematic scheme and criminal enterprise, the corporators conspired together and with each other, to breach the domestic duty and perfect obligation to maintain the integrity of foreign and domestic securities and Coin under pretense of Public Law 95-147, 91 Stat. 1227, October 28, 1977; and did in fact continually hold the CITIZENS and THEIR PROPERTY LIABLE and as COLLATERAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPECULATIONS, LEVERAGING, and arbitrary extensions of CREDIT of the corporators of The Fund and The Bank, and their agents.\n\nThe Fund and The Bank and its associations and combinations are claimed and admitted to be the \"instrumentality\", and are fundamentally engaged in activities which are of a \"private nature\", Osborn vs. The Bank Of The United States, 6 L.Ed. (9 Wheat) 204. They are NOT exempt from judicial process in the State Courts, nor from liability under the \"International Organizations Immunities Act\", 22 USC 288-288f, for TORTS or contractual obligations. (And just what \"court\" would you take them to? - David)\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: The Fund and The Bank, its corporators and agents SOLICIT and COLLECT CONTRIBUTIONS, LOANS, MONEY, OR OTHER THINGS OF VALUE, FOR OR IN INTEREST OF FOREIGN PRINCIPALS AND POWERS. (See: 22 USC 611; 26 USC 6103(k)(4); Multilateral Economic Assistance Act of 1993, Public Law 102-391, 106 Stat. 1633).\n\nNO OFFICER, EMPLOYEE OR AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES CAN ACT AS AN \"AGENT OF A FOREIGN PRINCIPAL\" WITHOUT CRIMINALLY VIOLATING FUNDAMENTAL DOMESTIC LAW. The Supreme Law of the Land specifically declares and limits the use of force and taxation to \"the general Welfare and common defence of the United States.\" See: Constitution for the United States of America, Preamble; Article I, Section 8, Clause 1. NONE of the funds solicited or collected through forced contributions of the Internal Revenue Service are returned to the de jure office of \"Treasurer of the United States.\" (See: Public Law 94-564, 90 Stat. 2660, Legislative History, Senate Report 94-1148, pg. 5967; Reorganization Plan No. 26, 15 Federal Register 148; 26 USC 7804(a)). The funds solicited, collected and contributed by the corporators, and all proceeds of the operation, remain in the International Organization's exclusive possession and control. (See: Public Law 102-391,106 Stat. 1633).\n\nThe \"Secretary of Treasury\" is undeniably and admitted to be the \"Governor\" of the International Bank For Reconstruction and Development (The Bank) and the International Monetary Fund (The Fund) 22 USC 286a, and numerous other international organizations, and whose officers, employees and agents owe their PRIMARY ALLEGIANCE to the respective organizations AND TO NO OTHER AUTHORITY. (See: Articles Of Agreement Of The I.M.F., 60 Stat. 1401, et seq., Article IX; Articles Of Agreement Of The Bank, 60 Stat. 1440, et seq., Article VII; Mendaro vs. The World Bank, 717 F.2d. 610; see also Constitution And General Regulations For INTERPOL, Article 30; 22 USC 263a). Under PRETEXT and PRETENSE of \"Reorganization\" (BANKRUPTCY) the position also includes the exercise of the powers of the President under the \"Trading With The Enemy Act\" of October 6, 1917, 50 USC 1, as \"Alien Property Custodian.\" (See: Executive Order 9095, as amended, Executive Order 11281, 31 Federal Register 7215).\n\nThe control of the entire \"essential economic engine\" was relinquished and surrendered to the \"Governor\" of \"The Bank\" and \"The Fund\" under pretense of Reorganization Plan No. 26. (See also: 26 USC 7804(a)). The numerous international agreements were NOT \"made under Authority\" in accordance with the tenor of the commission as expressed in the Constitution for the United States of America, Article VI, Clause 2. The forced CONTRIBUTIONS through the IRS cannot be vindicated as a \"TAX\" under the Constitution for the United States of America, Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, nor under the 16th Amendment, nor under the Law of Nations. The Internal Revenue Service is NOT an Agency of the United States. But . . . if you have a Social Security Number, also known as a \"Taxpayer Identification Number\", YOU have licensed and contracted to trade with the enemy. Social Security is an INTERNATIONAL agreement, and is controlled by the IMF and World Bank -- both UN Organizations. ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, i.e., YOUR LOCAL BANK OR CREDIT UNION -- all of them, are under the EXCLUSIVE direction and control of the \"Governor\" of \"The Fund\" and \"The Bank\" -- the United Nations. Now, would YOU like to have a bank account or a loan?\n\nThey have no money. There are NO\"dollars\" in their (YOUR) accounts and YOU are NOT being PAID AT LAW for YOUR LABOR. A \"dollar\" is a specific weight of metal, either silver or gold; it is NOT paper, unless it is redeemable for the silver or gold Coin. Federal Reserve Notes, also called \"SDR's\" (Special Drawing Rights) are NOT \"dollars\". The fundamental Law of the Land, Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution for the United States of America, as ordained and established, REQUIRES that \"No State shall emit Bills of Credit or make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.\"\n\nWhere is the silver and gold Coin? It will be appropriate to repeat here that \"TYRANNY IS ALWAYS CLOAKED IN COMPLEXITY.\" Afterall, we are speaking here of a \"systematic scheme\" that was given birth in the early 1900's, with the institution of \"elastic currency\" and overseas banking and lending, also known as \"edge banking\". (This is totally incorrect; see the First Bank of the United States in 1792. - David) Shortly thereafter, more paper monetary obligations were circulating abroad than could be redeemed. This in turn created a balance-of-payment problem and, in large part, gave rise to the \"Great Depression\" of the late 1920's. (Again, incorrect. It did lead to the bankrupcy of the United Staes government. More on this a little later. - David) The created economic condition resulted in the passage of: (1) the \"Emergency Banking Relief Act\" of 1933, whereby the gold Coin was TAKEN from the People; (2) the \"Agricultural Adjustment Act\" of 1933, whereby the private Federal Reserve banks' irredeemable (floating) paper was declared to be \"legal tender\" for all debts, and where marketing boards and price controls were started; and, (3) the \"Gold Reserve Act\" of 1934, which created an exclusively controlled Fund where the gold was deposited and held for settlement of international balance-of-payments.\n\nThe \"public lands\" were also \"withdrawn\" from use and settlement during this time and fees were imposed for the use and enjoyment of natural resources (duck stamps, grazing fees, park entrance fees, etc.).\n\nOn June 12, 1934, the Office of President was given statutory authority to enter into EXECUTIVE, INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS without the consent of the Senate. Franklin D. Roosevelt used this new power to negotiate the London Agreement on Gold. The intent of the London Agreement was to \"NATIONALIZE\" (meaning to \"take\") and then to \"INTERNATIONALIZE\" the gold and silver Coin. The agreement could not be implemented because it would destabilize the domestic economy of the United States of America. As a result, Roosevelt sought passage of the \"Gold Reserve Act\" of 1934 to GIVE EFFECT to the London Agreement and other INTERNATIONAL agreements to be made in the future. Section 10(b) of the Gold Reserve Act created the \"Exchange Stabilization Fund\" under the \"EXCLUSIVE CONTROL\" of the Secretary of Treasury. Moreover, any operations or transactions taking place under this clause are \"not reviewable by any other officer of the United States\". The gold taken (nationalized) from circulation during the mid 1930's, was deposited in this Fund. Section 10(b) also declares that whatever is deposited (the term \"deposit\" has very direct meanings under law, and the property becomes the property of the holder of the deposit - David) in the \"Exchange Stabilization Fund\" SHALL REMAIN in the Fund, including any interest or other profits made from its use. THIS ACT PERMANENTLY REMOVED THE GOLD FROM CIRCULATION AMONG THE PEOPLE and CONVERTED IT TO THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF THOSE ENGAGED IN INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS! (Could that be handy for the international banks and the corporations owned by them? - David)\n\nThe \"future\" INTERNATIONAL agreements did not surface until 1945, when the International Bank For Reconstruction And Development (World Bank) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were established as sister International Organizations of the United Nations by the Bretton Woods Agreement. The United States took the gold that it nationalized (expropriated) from the People in the 1930's, and purchased voting share stocks in the World Bank and IMF. The United States was, and is, the LARGEST voting share stockholder in both the World Bank and the IMF. It is absolutely imperative to remember that when a government becomes a stockholder in any corporation, IT WAIVES ITS SOVEREIGNTY, and operates under and according to the corporate charter of the organization. The United States thus became the \"alter-ego\" of \"The Fund\" and \"The Bank\" under the rule of instrumentality.\n\nBy 1965, the balance-of-payments DEFICIT had grown to such immense proportions that Congress had to debase the silver Coin of the United States to pay the international debt. On March 18, 1968, via Public Law 90-269, the United States declared that there were no more funds left for the redemption of their obligations, and a few months later, Congress amended the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, which became the foundation of the \"Special Drawing Rights\" (SDR) accounts in the IMF.\n\nSpecial Drawing Rights (SDR's) are used for many things. It has recently been used to provide funding to implement the Uruguay Round Trade Agreement in the United States, and to pay Mexico's debts after it defaulted on its international balance-of-payments. An SDR is a \"blank check\" written against someone else's account. Technically, an SDR is an \"international letter of credit\" issued by the Secretary of Treasury (a.k.a. the \"Governor\" of the Fund and Bank) in whatever amount he determines. The SDR is then deposited in a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve Bank. The Bank then issues the EQUIVALENT in PAPER FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES. The funds received from the Banks are deposited in the \"Exchange Stabilization Fund\" where they remain at the exclusive disposal of the \"Governors\" of the G-7, that is, the seven corporate \"Governors\" of the World Bank and IMF (United Nations). The International Organizations are NOT obligated to repay the SDR, however, the funds taken out and borrowed from the central banks through the \"system\" become, and are, OBLIGATIONS of the Nation. When an SDR is issued against the United States, the People and businesses feel the effects through INFLATION and the DEPRECIATED PURCHASING POWER of their irredeemable paper money.\n\nAs \"human resources\" and \"institutional units\", the People are held liable for the entire indebtedness, PLUS interest. Simply said, both the initial funds for the loan and the loan payments are collected through forced contributions from the People of the United States through taxation, fees, and other exactions.\n\nPresident Clinton used the International Organizations Act to grant IUCN \"immunity from suit\" on January 18, 1996, via Executive Order #12986. These special privileges and immunities provide the IUCN and its agents with the equivalent of a \"Title of Nobility\" which is prohibited by the Constitution for the United States of America. It is to be noted that the members of IUCN still use FAMILIAR DOMESTIC front names such as \"U.S.\" Forest Service, \"U.S.\" Fish and Wildlife Service, \"U.S.\" Bureau of Land Management, \"U.S.\" Environmental Protection Agency, \"U.S.\" Park Service, and \"U.S.\" NOAA and National Marine Fisheries Service, etc. Much of the public is deceived as to whom the organizations and agents REALLY ARE and what their REAL AGENDA and program IS. The facts and law of the situation indicate that all of these so-called \"U.S. Agencies\" are each, DIRECTED, CONTROLLED, FINANCED AND SUBSIDIZED by AGENTS OF A FOREIGN PRINCIPAL, and have NOTHING to do with the \"United States of America\", as you and I know it.\n\nAs stated in the IUCN's book entitled, \"The Easement As A Conservation Technique\" ....\"Broadly speaking, the need for an approach like that permitted by CONSERVATION EASEMENTS is occasioned by limited OBJECTIVES OF LAND-USE CONTROL, the achievement of which does not require assumption of full proprietary ownership of the land. THIS NEED ARISES FOR GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES WHEN THE OBJECTIVES ARE BEYOND THEIR POWER to impose sufficient restrictions on property WITHOUT COMPENSATION....The United States federal and state constitutions require 'just compensation' to be paid to a landowner whose property has been EXPROPRIATED or condemned for public purposes.\"\n\nThe plans, programs, collaborative projects, etc., are many times referred to as \"INTERGOVERNMENTAL\" activities. The \"Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, Section 8; Money and Finance Act of 1982, Chapter 65; and the International Forestry Act of 1990\" -- ALL OF THESE are examples of \"INTERGOVERNMENTAL\" operations. The media buzzword \"intergovernmental\" has a definition and meaning that is quite different from what it conveys to the mind of most people. The term \"Intergovernmental\" is defined in the Vienna Convention On The Law Of Treaties, Part I, Article 2, Section 1(i) as: \"'INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION' means an intergovernmental organization. \"The use of benign words that have hidden meanings are frequently intended to persuade the ignorant to give their tacit consent.\n\nThe \"strategic plan\" of the International Organizations is a SUBJUGATION PROCESS and is more on the order of the \"unconventional warfare\" operations of the Agency for International Development (USAID), which is misrepresented as being a \"U.S.\" Agency. The A.I.D. is directly connected to The World Bank and International Monetary Fund and oversees and controls THE BANK'S INTERESTS in the host recipient country (THESE ARE U.N. OPERATIONS). It also operates as a paramilitary support unit for U.N. multinational military operations (see: 22 USC 287d) and is sometimes referred to as the \"country team.\"\n\nThe international systematic scheme was devised and stealthily implemented over the course of the last 100 years or more. This scheme is nothing more or less than a ploy to nationalize, then internationalize and expropriate property and rights to property under the guise of \"saving the earth\" and \"endangered species\". Nationalization and expropriation is AGAINST THE LAW OF NATIONS and the declared Public Policy of the United States. Public Law 88-205, 77 Stat. 386, 387, Section 602(e). The INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS are also prohibited by Congress from seriously impairing the economic stability of the United States, Public Law 472, 62 Stat. 137, or adversely affecting production in the United States, Public Law 99-190, 99 Stat. 1306, Section 523. ANY ACTIVITY WHICH VIOLATES THE PUBLIC POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES IS CONSIDERED AS VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE. (See: 54 Am Jur 2d, \"Money\", Section 35).\n\nThe \"Land Acquisition\" program (Act of March 1, 1911, 36 Stat. 961, as amended, Public Law 94-588, 90 Stat. 2949, Section 17) coupled with other Acts such as the \"Endangered Species Act\" (Public Law 93-205, 87 Stat. 884) have been systematically used as an ILLEGAL \"EMINENT DOMAIN\" proceeding, and have been wrongfully and fraudulently used to nationalize, expropriate and internationalize large amounts of valuable property belonging to the Citizens and others. The International organizations under the U.N. have unlawfully and fraudulently used these sequestered private and public lands and natural resources as COLLATERAL in the \"loan portfolios\" of international lending institutions, which are under the direction and control of the alien, corporate \"Governor\" of The Fund and The Bank, Robert Rubin and his predecessors, Lloyd Bentsen and Nicholas Brady (also \"known\" as the \"Secretary of Treasury\"), including, but not limited to, The International Bank For Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-America Development Bank, The African Development Bank, The Asian Development Bank, The African Development Fund, The Export-Import Bank, and their many subsidiary financial institutions.\n\nThe \"Brady Plan\" was devised and implemented to insure and guarantee international lending institutions from losses because of their own cupidity and unsafe and unsound banking practices. Public Law 98-181, 97 Stat. 1153, House Report 98-175, pg. 1906. THE DEBTS AND LOSSES OF THESE INTERNATIONAL AND PRIVATE LENDING INSTITUTIONS (22 USC 286d) WERE PASSED OFF ON THE \"U.S. TAXPAYER.\" As recorded in As recorded in the Congressional \"Hearing Before The Subcommittee On International Economic Policy And Trade\", April 19, 1989, concerning the \"INTERNATIONAL DEBT CRISIS: A REVIEW OF THE BRADY PLAN\", at page 3:\n\n\"In the second place, I don't think the AMERICA TAXPAYER SHOULD HAVE TO ASSUME THE RISK FOR THE COMMERCIAL BANKS. Under the Brady Plan, if the debtor nations default on their reduced loans, the IMF and the World Bank will offset the losses incurred by the commercial banks. BUT AS WE ALL KNOW, U.S. TAXPAYERS CONTRIBUTE 20 PERCENT OF THE FUNDS TO THE IMF AND THE WORLD BANK. So if the debtor nations default on their refinanced loans, THE U.S. TAXPAYERS WILL HAVE TO PICK UP A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE TAB. The taxpayers did not share in the profits in the 1970's made by the commercial banks on their loans to Third World Countries. Why, then, should the taxpayers have to absorb some of the banks' losses?\"\n\nThe \"Plan\" and underlying scheme is meant as a revenue raising measure for FOREIGN PRINCIPALS AND POWERS and to secure international lending institutions and organizations from losses. Such activity has been PROHIBITED since the time of Lord Mansfield, 54 Am Jur2d, \"Money\", Section 35, and is a CRIMINAL ACT under 18 USC 219 & 951. NO OFFICER, EMPLOYEE OR AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES CAN ACT AS AN AGENT OF A FOREIGN PRINCIPAL. The underlying international scheme is not \"for the general Welfare and common defence\", nor is it meant to pay the debts of the United States and is therefore OUTSIDE of the DOMESTIC revenue raising Powers of Congress, Article I, Section 8, Clause 1.\n\nThis is only part of the sordid story. /s/ John R. Prukop\n\nThe above is probably, except for a brief that I saw written by John Nelson, the best description of what the United States really is that I have ever seen, if you look at it from that point of view. And, thus, what it really means to be a United States citizen. The United States is an illusion, and nothing more. It is an integration of self-interest for the profit of a few very rich and powerful men. If this knowledge were general throughout the population, what do you think would happen? Unfortunately, all too few will look.\n\nThis description given above is the refined essence of mans government. Any time you give man the privilege of writing his own law, the above is exactly what happens. Greed, corruption, the accumulation of wealth at the expense of others, all of these things together doom any such attempt. This is why every kingdom, every empire, and every so-called government has failed on this earth. The greed becomes so great, and the thirst for ultimate power becomes so overwhelming, that eventually nothing is left. It is all destroyed, and we start over, each time a little dumber than the time before.\n\nAnd because we are a little dumber each time, the accumulation of power in the hands of the few grows greater with every attempt. Until you have what is planned for today, when every action taken is to be monitored and approved before hand. Where every credit dime possessed by any man or woman on the face of the earth is subject to taxation and confiscation at the whim of any bureaucrat.\n\nIf you are a United States citizen, and if you give allegiance to and participate in what is described above, you are helping to create the beast. The beast is not coming to America; the District of Columbia has been at the fore front in creating the beast ever since 1792. This is why so many of the Kings allies, like German troops, fought in the Civil War on the side of the north. The south, even if they did not realize it, simply wanted shed of the king and his minions, and it was not allowed. The issue was states Rights, and the Rights of the People. Once government is moved away from the people, into a central establishment, the destruction of the people, and the government, is only a matter of time. This is why God's government on earth is built on the People themselves, and why we are given the task of enforcing His Law.\n\nBack in the \"old days,\" when human sacrifice was common and openly praticed, the men in charge knew that the gods they were worshipping were not real. However, to the parents standing in the crowd watching their child killed on the altar or thrown into the flaming mouth of Baal, that god is very real indeed. And the men with the power to select that child, or someone elses child instead, had the power of life and death in their hands. This is called rule by fear, and it is very effective. For reference, see the IRS.\n\nIt loses its effectiveness when the people lose their fear, or when the people become convinced that no matter what they do, no matter how closely they conform to what they think is the law, that their turn is going to come anyway. At that point, fear is no longer a factor. This is why you see judges talk about and being concerned with \"the appearance of justice.\" They know that when the people become fully aware of the arbitrary nature of the law, that it is only a matter of time before the judge's days of privilege and power is done. It is only a matter of time before the people put an end, once again, to another of mans government. That time is approaching in America. The problem that faces us is what do the People of America chose, after the United States government is gone, or a non-factor in the affairs of America. I fear what that answer is. For reference, see men fighting to save the Constitution, and other men fighting for the Constitution.\n\nContact the State Comptroller, and/or Treasury (with this State) official under a freedom of information act, and/or privacy act request, and secure a copy of the agreement that must be enforced in order for this State to act as a withholding agent on behalf of the United States.\n\nDan Meador put this question to test back in 1995 in the State of Oklahoma.\n\nWould that make this State, an instrumentality of the United States?\n\nHerein is the Act of Congress that empowers the United States to enter into equity attachments with the State wherein \"Federal Employees\" toil on behalf of the American Employer, and or an instrumentality thereof.\n\n66 Statute Chapter 940, page 765 Public Law 587 AN ACT\n\nJuly 17, 1952 [S. 1999]\n\nRelating to the withholding for State income Tax purposes, on the compensation of Federal Employees. Withholding of State Income taxes by Federal agencies.\n\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States United States of America in Congress assembled, That where- (1) the law of any State or Territory provided for the collection of a tax by imposing upon employers generally the duty of withholding sums from the compensation of employees and making returns of such sums to the authorities of such State or Territory, and\n\n(2) such duty to withhold is imposed generally with respect to the compensation of employees who are residents of such State or Territory, then the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the President, is authorized and directed to enter into an agreement with such State or Territory within one hundred and twenty days of the request for agreement from the proper official of such State or Territory. Such agreement shall provide that the head of each department or agency of the United States shall comply with the requirements of such law in the case of employees of such agency or department who are subject to such tax and whose regular place of Federal Employment is within the State or Territory with which such agreement is entered into. No such agreement shall apply with respect to compensation for services as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nSec. 2. Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to consent to the application of any provision of law which has the effect of imposing more burdensome requirements upon the United States than it imposes upon other employers, or which has the effect of subjecting the United States or any of its officers, or employers to any penalty or liability by reason of the provisions of this Act. Approved July 17, 1952\n\nMEADOR REPLY\n\nWhen these issues were addressed in 1995 & '96, we were closing ground, but didn't get the banana -- I was allegedly \"indicted\" less than a month after my memorandum proving IRS is Dept. of the Treasury, Puerto Rico & no taxing statute in the Internal Revenue Code reaches the several States was published as legal notice in the Oklahoma City newspaper that sets across the street from the Arkansas-Oklahoma IRS \"district\" office. Maybe that was the straw that broke the camel's back -- \"Time for Meador to take a vacation...\"\n\nAnyway, the whole Cooperative Federalism scheme seems to revolve around the Buck Act (4 U.S.C. 105-111) and the section that authorizes States to enter compacts (4 U.S.C. 112). You will note that there are no implementing regulations for any Title 4 section; Title 4 in the Code of Federal Regulations pertains to the General Accounting Office for the most part. GAO is responsible for resolving all claims of and against the United States, so maybe it is appropriate that GAO regs are in Title 4 CFR.\n\nAnyway, virtually all State taxes (Sorry; not virtually all: ALL. - David) are predicated on Buck Act authority -- income tax, Social Security tax, fuel tax, even sales tax. The Buck Act doesn't apply to the several States, and even if it did, tax promulgated under Buck Act authority, read most liberally, would apply only on insular possessions of the United States which have been properly ceded to the United States. Consequently, State legislatures have made the States respectively vulnerable as when the law is unraveled, none of the State taxes apply to the geographical State except on insular possessions of the United States.\n\nIt's almost amusing that the State becomes the Achilles Heel to bring the whole scheme down once the judicial maze is sorted out.\n\nThe \"compact\" section at 4 U.S.C. 112 pertains to agreements for enforcing criminal law of the States respectively. It was originally 1934 legislation, and was classified in Title 18 of 1934 & '40 editions of the United States Code, but was moved into Title 4 thereafter and has been fraudulently used for such things as agreements pertaining to Social Security, etc., since. The whole Organization of States and other such organizations rest on this section in the Code -- it was the centerpiece behind the Intergovernmental Compacts in 1935 & '37. /s/ Dan Meador\n\nSo the illusion that is the United States extends to the several states, or what people think of as the states, now. There no longer is any taxing authority within the several states because no one is home in the states themselves, and this includes all of the so-called officers of those states. If you stop and think about this, you will see how this will be used to bring America into subjection by an illusion of law; an illusion so far from reality that most will never be aware of what has happened. This change from a number of republics has been going on since 1792, as the King and his minions move to restore the King's authority and privileges.\n\nSorry Hank but the below is totally wrong. We have confirmation from the supreme court administrative personnel that the last Article III non diminished salaried judge died in 1969. True, the courts are article III courts but NOT in a constitutional sense. I have obtained 7 federal judges Form 61. That form makes them civil servants like any other employee of the federal government. Every one including the supreme court judges are NOT, repeat NOT Article III judges. There is no more animal. For proof read the Terry Hatter case where 12 judges sued out as Article III judges. The Appeal court stated that not one of them could claim that, because since 1983 they were under the Social Security Act.\n\nThere are a host of cases below. And by the way I have studied and researched this animal for 20 years and hundreds of thousands of hours compared to the man who only spent two or three years? A court can only have article III powers if the judges have non diminished pay, hold no licenses of ANY kind, hold no social security as they all do as stated in the Judge Hatter case, and file no Form 61's, which they all do. The Tacoma Lumber case unequivocally states that NO U.S. District court is formed under the constitution as an Article III court but are \"inferior courts\" formed under article III and are not constitutional courts in that sense. The Informer\n\nFrom: \"Bruce Edward\" bigmac@adelphia.net Subject: Re: RE; Federal Judges are Private\n\nAs one who has studied the federal court system for literally thousands of hours over several years, here is what I've learned.\n\nAll of the judges on the United States District Courts have been appointed under Art III. However, they have been assigned to courts whose jurisdiction flows only from Art I. All USDC's in the States are legislative courts vested with jurisdiction under Art I. Although the judges were appointed under Art III, Clause 1, they have been \"neutered\" of the \"judicial powers of the US\" that flows from Art III.\n\nThere is only 1 USDC that has been vested by Congress with both Art I and Art III powers. That is the USDC for the District of Columbia. See 28 USC Sec. 88, historical notes. I have 4 cases docketed on the \"law side\" of that USDC where the USA is the defendant.\n\nFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. Their jurisdiction is dependant upon 2 things; what Congress has vested in them and what jurisdiction was invoked by Plaintiff.\n\nThere is no such thing as an Art II court in the federal system. Hope this helps. ICE\n\nSubject: Fw: RE; Federal Judges are Private\n\nJust received....any comments...rebuttal? Haven't verified anything, just passing along for general information...\n\nA court caseX-Status:\n\nNew To All. The Informer gave me parts of the briefs he wrote for a man that subsequently led to the IRS withdrawing the civil case against him after 3 years of not being able to obtain what they wanted under a 2039 summons in court. Mr. Houck is a District court judge and the man's name is XXXX and need not be divulged.\n\nHowever the man was later indicted but the Informer did not participate in the writing of any of the pleadings.\n\nJudges are not under the united states control and are therefore private.\n\nThe Congress (herein after United States), in Cromelin v United States, 177 F 2d 275, when asking for dismissal stated; \"that the judge and the trustee in bankruptcy were not employees of the United States within the meaning of the Act.\" The District court judge agreed and stated; \"I hold further that a federal district judge is not an employee of the United States, nor is his trustee in bankruptcy.\" On appeal the Fifth Circuit upheld. Therefore, all federal judges are private, thereby supporting the private law scenario supra, but are holding themselves out to the people, such as the cross libelants, as belonging to the United States government which is a crime under 18 USC 219 & 912. In a Constitutional sense the judges cannot exert judicial power, see infra.\n\nJUDGES CANN0T EXERCISE ARTICLE III POWER\n\nNo federal court in this country has full Article III Power. For the above, and herein included facts, is another reason the IRS controls the \"judges\" of the courts. An adjudicated fact that supports this reasoning is Hatter v United States, 21 C1. Ct. 786 (1990), wherein 10 federal judges sought relief from Social Security taxes claiming they were Article III judges. The Claims Court dismissed, and they moved to the 'United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, case No. 91-5039. In the decision, Jan. 16, 1992, to remand back to the Claims Court, the court stated that neither the judges nor the court of appeals or district court judges were Article III judges. Ever since the erroneous reading of O'Malley v Woodrough, 307 US 277, which attempts to overthrow Evans v Gore, 253 US 245. Based on Woodrough's actions, IRS says that the Congress can tax every federal judge, inferring all \"judges\" were, and have been, stupid enough and uneducated enough to believe it. Thank you Mr. Houck\n\nFootnote 1. \"We think the holdings are correct .... He is in no sense an agent or employee or officer of the United States. The .judge is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate and paid from the United States Treasury, but in trying cases he is a member of the independent .judiciary and is not under the control of the United States ....\n\nfor proving Evans v Gore principles are still alive and well by citing it, which disqualifies all you \"judges\" from Article III capacity. However, a close reading of the case and the relevant facts therein, reveal that judge Woodrough voluntarily claimed his compensation as \"gross income\" by writing the figure as \"income\" and then signed the form under penalties of perjury stating that the figures were true and correct. Any constitutional objections or protest, following a voluntary act with no evidence of duress are ill founded. Chesebrough v U.S., 193 US 253. So the reasoning was correct ONLY for that particular stupid \"judge\" who voluntarily filed a tax form. Already entered is proof that there never was a true Article III Court, see Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure, Jurisdiction, West's Federal 13 B., Organization of Federal Courts, Judiciary Act of 1789, Ch 1 Sec. 3503 pg 9.2.\n\nThe supposed \"judicial\" Powers of all \"courts\" of this nation, federal, state, county (parish), or municipal are territorial courts, established by \"Congress\" under the \"jurisdiction\" of commercial government. The question now arises; if any judge who is to hear this action, being influenced by the colorable law fiction that he (judge) is required to pay any income tax on his guaranteed salary, then he will believe and rule that everyone is required to produce records and pay an income tax. The foregoing, apparently true by the actions of all judges, then said judge(s) have been directly influenced by the IRS (who he is beholding to) in an adverse manner, proving he is a private administrative judge, Cromelin supra, that violates the spirit of the framers' intent to keep the judiciary free from outside influences. But that only applies to the Supreme Court. But, again, even they pay an income tax.\n\nFootnote 2 \"Certain features of the First Judiciary Act deserve special comment. It was argued in Congress that there was a duty to confer on the federal courts the full judicial power granted by the Constitution. This view was rejected by Congress, and indeed at no time in history has the entire judicial power been vested in federal courts.\" There is a footnote to see Sec. 3526: Entire power never vested.\n\nFootnote 3 \"The United States district court is not a true United States court, established under article 3 of the Constitution to administer the judicial power of the United States therein conveyed The resemblance of its jurisdiction to that of free United States courts in offering an opportunity to nonresidents in a geographical sense of resorting to a tribunal not subject to local influence does not change its character as a mere territorial court.\" Balzac v. People of Porto Rico, 258 US 298, 312. \"In a sense that its jurisdiction is dependent on the will of Congress, the district court is a court of limited, rather than general jurisdiction,...\" 36 A C.J.S.

We, the Heads of State or Government of eight major industrialized democracies and the President of the European Commission, met in Birmingham to discuss issues affecting people in our own and other countries. In a world of increasing globalization we are ever more interdependent. Our challenge is to build on and sustain the process of globalization and to ensure that its benefits are spread more widely to improve the quality of life of people everywhere. We must also ensure that our institutions and structures keep pace with the rapid technological and economic changes under way in the world.\n\n2. Of the major challenges facing the world on the threshold of the 21st Century, this Summit has focused on three:\n\nTo achieving sustainable economic growth and development throughout the world in a way which, while safeguarding the environment and promoting good governance, will enable developing countries to grow faster and reduce poverty, restore growth to emerging Asian economies, and sustain the liberalization of trade in goods and services and of investment in a stable international economy;\n\nTo building lasting growth in our own economies in which all can participate, creating jobs and combating social exclusion;\n\nTo tackling drugs and transnational crime which threaten to sap this growth, undermine the rule of law and damage the lives of individuals in all countries of the world. Our aim in each case has been to agree concrete actions to tackle these challenges.\n\nCombating drugs and international crime\n\n18. Globalization has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in transnational crime. This takes many forms, including trafficking in drugs and weapons; smuggling of human beings; the abuse of new technologies to steal, defraud and evade the law; and the laundering of the proceeds of crime.\n\n19. Such crimes pose a threat not only to our own citizens and their communities, through lives blighted by drugs and societies living in fear of organized crime; but also a global threat which can undermine the democratic and economic basis of societies through the investment of illegal money by international cartels, corruption, a weakening of institutions and a loss of confidence in the rule of law.\n\n20. To fight this threat, international cooperation is indispensable. We ourselves, particularly since the Lyon summit in 1996, have sought ways to improve that cooperation. Much has already been achieved. We acknowledge the work being done in the UN, the EU and by other regional groupings. We welcome the steps undertaken by the G8 Lyon Group to implement its 40 Recommendations on transnational organized crime and the proposals G8 Justice and Interior Ministers announced at their meeting in Washington last December. By working together, our countries are helping each other catch criminals and break up cartels. But more needs to be done. There must be no safe havens either for criminals or for their money.\n\n21. We have therefore agreed a number of further actions to tackle this threat more effectively:\n\nWe fully support efforts to negotiate within the next two years an effective United Nations convention against transnational organized crime that will provide our law enforcement authorities with the additional tools they need.\n\nWe agree to implement rapidly the ten principles and ten point action plan agreed by our Ministers on high tech crime. We call for close cooperation with industry to reach agreement on a legal framework for obtaining, presenting and preserving electronic data as evidence, while maintaining appropriate privacy protection, and agreements on sharing evidence of those crimes with international partners. This will help us combat a wide range of crime, including abuse of the internet and other new technologies.\n\nWe welcomed the FATF decision to continue and enlarge its work to combat money-laundering in partnership with regional groupings. We place special emphasis on the issues of money laundering and financial crime, including issues raised by offshore financial centers. We welcome the proposal to hold in Moscow in 1999 a Ministerial meeting on combating transnational crime. We agreed to establish Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) where we do not already have them, in line with our national constitutions and legal systems, to collect and analyze information on those engaged in money laundering and liaise with the equivalent agencies in partner countries. We agreed on principles and the need for adequate legislation to facilitate asset confiscation from convicted criminals, including ways to help each other trace, freeze and confiscate those assets, and where possible, in accordance with national legislation, share seized assets with other nations.\n\nWe agree on the need to explore ways of combating official corruption arising from the large flows of criminal money.\n\nWe are deeply concerned by all forms of trafficking of human beings including the smuggling of migrants. We agreed to joint action to combat trafficking in women and children, including efforts to prevent such crimes, protect victims and prosecute the traffickers. We commit ourselves to develop a multidisciplinary and comprehensive strategy, including principles and an action plan for future cooperation amongst ourselves and with third countries, including countries of origin, transit and destination, to tackle this problem. We consider the future comprehensive UN organized crime convention an important instrument for this purpose.\n\nWe endorse joint law enforcement action against organized crime and welcome the cooperation between competent agencies in tackling criminal networks. We agree to pursue further action, particularly in dealing with major smuggling routes and targeting specific forms of financial fraud.\n\nWe endorse the Lyon Groups principles and action plan to combat illegal manufacturing and trafficking of firearms. We welcome its agreement to work towards the elaboration of a binding international legal instrument in the context of the UN transnational organized crime convention.\n\nThe origins of the present Group of Eight (G8) leading industrialized democracies lie in the Economic Summit convened by President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France at Rambouillet in November 1975. President Giscard and Chancellor Schmidt of Germany, themselves both former Finance Ministers, were keen to establish an informal forum to discuss world economic issues, building on the 'Library Group' of Finance Ministers from Britain, France, Germany, Japan and the US (named after their meetings in the White House library), which operated during the early 1970s. This original 'Group of Five' were joined by Italy, Canada and the President of the European Commission in 1976-77. This configuration became known as the Group of Seven (G7).\n\nHere is a lesson; it is THEIR credit. Whatever they want to install as controls of and for that credit is their business, and you can not argue any other way successfully. All of the necessary treaties are already in place for the type of control talked about above. Now that you are hearing about these controls simply means that all of the work is done and it is time to initiate action. It is far to late to complain. Besides, IT'S THEIR CREDIT!\n\nUnderstanding this is also important in understanding the so-called income tax. (I have an excellent brief on this available separately if you wish to see it. - David) You can not argue the income tax under the Constitution, because the Constitution has no bearing on the subject. It is a tax which is contracted for, and you must argue on that basis. Also, to avoid it, you must use their laws, which are designed to do just that.\n\nTo give you a further idea of just how impossible it is to change the world, the following is offered.\n\nThis is, indeed, quite an interesting read, albeit lengthy.

On this website is listed every multinational treaty ever entered into since the 1800's. One document entitled :\n\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 17 July, 1998, caught my eye. Due to the intricate wording of this treaty, and due to the fact that I am not an attorney, I realize the importance of many things in here might escape my attention. Just from a cursory browse through it, however, as that is all I have had time for so far, there appears here to be sufficient proof for all to see that the implications of One World Government in the future coming to pass are now no longer able to be denied. I pass this on to you in hopes that either you, or people whom you deem more able can break this treaty down into more understandable pieces that we all can understand. I realize that from a Christian perspective this news is not surprising. However, now is no better time to fall to ones knees and ask for the wisdom with which to make the all important everyday decisions that would cause those around us to be fully aware of whom we serve.....\n\nThis message has been posted to APFN MESSAGE BOARD: To Read Message Board:\n\nhttp://www.InsideTheWeb.com/messageboard/mbs.cgi?acct=mb77532\n\nTo Post a Message:\n\nhttp://www.InsideTheWeb.com/messageboard/mbs.cgi?acct=mb77532#POSTNEW\n\nThe enclosed message refers to a APFN message posted to:\n\nhttp://www.InsideTheWeb.com/messageboard/mbs.cgi?acct=mb77532&MyNum=913211964&P=Yesmessage\n\nPlease print, study and share this outstanding research with as many of your friends as possible. We are all thankful to John Prukop for this report. A true American Patriot! This report is the result of many current postings about Why Waco? Please go to the Message Board and review this information. Soon to be added is the information about Paul Wilshire and his report to Gen. Janet Reno \"The Truth Behind Waco\". Mr. Prukop helped APFN in the distribution of this report. In the first page of this report Mr. Wilshire makes the statement \"The information in this report could get me killed\". It did! In just over a month of giving this report to Gen. Reno, Mr. Wilshire was found dead in his Apt. by Washington Reporter Sarah McClendon. Mr. Wilshire was also representing covert agent Gunther Russbacher in what is called \"The October Surprise Investigation\". Rayelan Russbacher has just filed an E-mail with APFN on this matter. At the time APFN contacted APFN (FAX NETWORK) to help with a 10x10x10 matrix to copy and network \"The Truth Behind Waco\" report. I provided a copy of the report to the U.S. House Judiciary Committee during the Waco hearings. It was never discussed or reviewed in the final report. Mr. Wilshire's death has never been investigated, all his records and files were taken and no one has received any further information. On several interviews I have heard Sarah McClendon on she has never answered any hard questions about the report. If anyone has any further information on this matter please feel free to post to APFN message board or send to APFN@nebox.com and we will spread the word.\n\nSubject: \"Secretary of Treasury\" A.K.A. \"Governor\" of The Fund and The Bank\n\nFrom: \"CCW\" <ccw@wolfenet.com>\n\nTo: American Patriot Friends Network <APFN@netbox.com>\n\nWARNING: 2nd AMENDMENT WILL BE GONE BY JUNE 99...\n\nby Jon Christian Ryter (BAFFauthor@aol.com)\n\nIn a message DotHB forwarded a message in which Devvykidd writes:\n\n\"Americans have the right to defend their family, their life and we know how to do it. We will do it if that's what it comes down to - that's what the Second Amendment is all about. You know it, I know it and the bad guys know it.\" ....Devvy Kidd\n\nAs an individual who has run for Congress (and is acquainted with several of my own acquaintances) Devvy Kidd obviously knows the jeopardy in which the Constitution (and particularly the 2nd Amendment) is in. What you may not know at this moment is that the Justice Department is on a timeline that mandates the abrogation of the 2nd Amendment by next June.\n\nIn writing my latest book, I picked up several key information \"sources\" within the Clinton Administration. One of them is a terrorist specialist in the Justice Department. He and a high ranking department head in the National Institute of Health have provided me with a good deal of information concerning the National ID Card (which Lamar Smith lied to me about in February, 1997) and the abolishment of the 2nd Amendment no later than June, 1999. The Justice Department source, while actively supplying me with information a few months ago, has now become nothing more than my personal \"Deepthroat.\" He will no longer supply new information, but will only confirm or deny information I manage to pick up elsewhere.\n\nTwo of the posts I sent out containing information he supplied were attached to a memo circulated through the Justice Dept asking for information about who could have leaked the data to an author.\n\nIt should be obvious to just about anyone today that the Y2K problem is a manufactured problem. First, no one knows what's going to happen. If you think about it, it is easy to figure out. You have included all of the elements. The introduction of the Euro is the first step to creating a universal global currency. As you likely know, when Jimmy Carter attempted to have GATT ratified (it had already failed in 1974), the government printing office had already printed thousands of new \"dollars,\" believing that global governance would be achieved during his term.\n\nThe problem with creating a global currency has always been the United States. To create a global currency all that is required is a global panic which collapses not only the economies of the industrialized nations, but their currencies as well. The problem for the globalists has never been its desire or determination to do it, but in creating a catalyst that could not be blamed directly on them.\n\nWhen J.P. Morgan instigated the Panic of 1908, it came back to his doorstep almost overnight. When the bankers manipulated the stock market throughout the 1920s and then collapsed the market and the economy in 1929, a good many intelligent writers correctly laid the blame on their doorsteps. This time the globalists have something else to blame - a computer chip.\n\nThey will be blameless this time. The collapse will be blamed on computers that see 2000 as 1900, and through no fault of their own, computers will shut down the economy. There are a few factors that will have great bearing on the severity of the problem: The crisis is being cleverly managed, and the media is doing its part to convince the American people that they will be faced with the loss of electricity, water, gas; and they can expect problems withdrawing funds from banks, etc.\n\nAnd, of course, those things will happen. Because the crisis will be so severe, the government believes there will be a dramatic increase in crime, so they are also preparing for that contingency as well. (Isn't it nice that our government is so concerned about our welfare?)\n\nTo prepare for the crisis, Clinton wrote PDD-39 (which was immediately declared a top secret). As you know, PDD-39 creates a new \"local\" police force out of FEMA. For the better part of 1998, FEMA \"agents\" have been receiving small arms training, and now spend more time on the pistol ranges than either the FBI or the BATF.\n\nOf course, since there are so many \"radicals\" around, Big Brother also realizes that FEMA, the FBI and the BATF may not be enough - even with the American military. Fortunately (according to my Justice Dept source who was responsible for their routing to U.S. military bases) there is not a shortage of UN troops. For the past year they have been coming into the United States in small numbers. They arrive at various military installations. The minute the pass through the front gates of those bases, they simply disappear. And, that is true also of vast amounts of weapons and munitions.\n\nMy source routed a trainload of small arms and munitions to one western base. Before the train arrived, it was diverted... and vanished. When he tried to track it, he was told by his supervisor in the Justice Dept that it was none of his business.\n\n(1) the introduction of the Euro-dollar January 1, 1999,\n\n(2) the government's progress,\n\n(3) how prepared the American people are and the people of the United States, regardless how prepared they think they are, are not prepared for what is planned. Stocking up on food packets and bottled water will not prepare them for what is coming no later than next June.\n\n(4) the behind the scenes machinations of the world bankers.\n\nHere is the real culprit behind Y2K. From documents I picked up for my latest book, Whatever Happened To America?, that include confidential White House memos and Clinton documents that were buried in the National Archives, the timeline of world government has been chronicled.\n\n[Devvy], I know when you were running for Congress, you followed this fairly close. I don't know how much access you have at this time.\n\nWhat should you know about the problem? The obvious first is that it is going to happen and the world has waited too long to fix the problem. As you state in this posting, the problem, Y2K can be solved with a Band-Aid until such time as all of the nation's mainframes can be updated by simply manually keying the year 2000 into those systems that have not been updated. This would solve the Y2K problem temporarily with only a minor interruption.\n\nThe second is that you are probably going to have your life disturbed to some degree and that degree will depend on you and those in your community. In reality, Devvy, it will have nothing to do with any community. The power that is creating the problem requires the problem. Just as that invisible power behind government caused the illegal and fraudulent ratification of both the 16th and 17th Amendments - and the creation of its own central bank in the United States, it has selected not only every President who has sat in the White House since 1912 (at least) - and, it determines precisely what issues will be debated during those election campaigns. Their power extends beyond the elected officials now, and goes directly into the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIt was because of a fear of overpopulation and a demand from the Rockefeller Foundation that abortion be legalized that the Supreme Court ruled on January 22, 1973 that a woman had a right to an abortion. Unknown to you, but on file in Box 1748 in the National Archives are three Supreme Court decisions which have not yet been rendered because the cases have not yet been filed. The first decision will state, when the government attempts to gain access to the medical databases at State level that \"...accessing medical databases does not require a medical license.\"\n\nThis decision, based on the passage of Hillary Clinton's Health Security Act of 1994, was to occur between 1996-98. The second decision which was to grant the government co-ownership of all medical databases was to occur between 1998-2000. And, finally, between 2002-04, the Supreme Court was to rule that all medical databases in the United States will be surrendered to the UN which will become the custodian of all information databases in the world.\n\nAttached to these decisions was the itinerary the government was planning to use to control the free movement of the population of the United States. One thing I would like to stress and that is this: Just remember one thing - those people - patriots or sheep - who will be adversely impacted are also the people who can fix the problem.\n\nDevvy, I am of the opinion that if we are to alter the timeline of the globalists, we need to do it now...or it will be too late. I am not certain exactly what the government has planned for June, 1999 but it is \"last resort\" act if the current plan to incite a revolt in North Carolina (or Tennessee, etc.) with the militia groups they are doing everything to incite fails. My \"source\" will not tell me what is planned (he may not even know), but the \"plans\" he is involved with apparently center on deployments after the incident occurs.\n\nHe did tell me that there is a Delta Force team that is \"practicing\" for a June, 1999 mission which suggest that if the militia groups like the 91st Brigade do not start shooting federal agents, it is likely that the government (in pure Hitler fashion) will use government troops to counterfeit one (like Hitler's burning of the Reichstag in 1933.)\n\nI have been following your writings for some time, and have been greatly impressed with your assessment of the problems this country is facing. Devvy, too bad you failed in your bid to get elected. In fact, I was impressed enough with your determination to fix America that you are one of twelve patriotic Americans to whom I dedicated my new book.\n\nAt this time, I see your posts only because I have been fortunate enough to have them forwarded to me by Dot Bibee. Would appreciate it if you would include me on your primary mail list. BAFFauthor@aol.com Jon Christian Ryter\n\n[MORE INFO. Jon is talking about the Delta Force - and that is the H.R.T. Squad that is in Andrews, NC right now. They are training hundreds of men - even though they only have a hundred or two there at a time because they rotate them every two weeks. They have been in the mountains since July. THINK!!! Stay Alert! ....Dot Bibee]\n\nHow much of the above is absolutely true and correct? I do not know, but I do know Devvy Kidd (her husband is a retired high ranking military officer), and it has been confirmed to me that there is enough truth in the message to cause anyone to initiate preparations for survival. Note the word; survival.\n\nIF WE COULD FACE OUR FEARS\n\nby Shonda P. Wigington (texnat57@gateway.net) Freedom-Lovers International\n\nWe have a crisis in our country today. The crisis I speak about is not the presidential impeachment hearings. It is not the recent rise in hate crimes. It is not the dangers our children face each day as moms and dads across America drop them off at public schools. It isn't the religious persecutions around the world that seem to be untouchable by the separation of church and state that has been planted in our way of life for the past 30 years. It isn't the crowding of prisons due to victimless crimes; nor is it the rising numbers of deadbeat parents. It isn't the breakup of the family, or the lack of role models in the land.\n\nThe crisis isn't campaign finance, or the outrageous amount of taxes we pay each year. It isn't nuclear warheads pointed at different countries around the world; nor is it the rapid destruction of rain forests. It isn't global warming, natural disasters, man-made pollution, or endangered species. It isn't terrorism, war, or slavery. It isn't the federal reserve, international moneychangers, or even welfare reform. It isn't illiteracy, disabled persons, or unemployment. It is not the economy, stupid.\n\nThe crisis we are facing in this country is FEAR. It is knowing that something is wrong and refusing to rock the boat for fear of being labeled a dissident.\n\nI believe that it was Winston Churchill that stated, \"The only thing men have to fear is fear itself.\" Today we have come to understand the meaning of those words all too clearly.\n\nToo many times men and women change the subject rather than face controversial issues. Too many times we tend to give our children the benefit of the doubt rather than offer them advice whether they need it or not. Too many times we defend our public officials simply because we voted for them, rather than hold them accountable to do the job we voted for them to do.\n\nFor too long we have allowed the government access to our pocket-books without saying a word for fear of being labeled a tax-evader. We fear speaking up for our right for fear of the very people who swore to protect those rights. We fear police who harass and intimidate rather than serve and protect.\n\nWe fear arrest at our places of business for failure to I-D eighteen-year-olds who are allowed to die for their country without parental consent but are not allowed to decide whether or not they are responsible enough to drink a beer. We fear arrest for sexual harassment if we ask someone out on a date more than once. We fear being labeled racist if we promote someone of the wrong color, regardless of his or her ability. We fear being labeled stalkers, kooks, or fanatics if we attempt to hold our public officials accountable. We fear being politically incorrect when we speak at a public forum.\n\nYet we don't realize that the chains of slavery are fastened by FEAR. It is fear that keeps man from actively pursuing his natural tendencies regarding life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. When we fear we are more inclined to accept 2nd best, rather than strive to have the best at any cost.\n\nThere was a time when our heroes were admired for the lack of fear they seemed to show. Today, I am ashamed to say societal stature rather than their dissident opinions measure our heroes.\n\nMy heroes are still those of the past who uttered such words as \"Give me liberty or give me death\" or \"They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\"\n\nIf only we could think like those men and have the courage to draw that line in the sand and stand up for our beliefs and control over our own lives as they did. Maybe then we would be able to tip or hats in appreciation of the officer on the streets without fear. We could call our public officials and tell them \"THANK YOU\" rather than complain. We could say to our children, \"Stand up straight. Show respect. THAT is the president of the United States of America coming.\"\n\nIf we could just have the courage to face our fears and look them in the eye and say, \"I'm not backing down. No retreat, no surrender,\" we might then be able to see a glimmer of hope that our children and our grandchildren will not have to wear the chains of slavery our government has forced upon us in the name of Peace.\n\nShonda P. Wigington, President, Freedom-Lovers International 5308 Robinsdale Lane\n\nAustin, Texas 78723 512-933-1950\n\nWhile I certainly do not agree with the entire message, the basis is true. Just as we are told in scripture to have no fear, the same is true today. I stopped paying the beast long ago because I knew he was harming my nation and my people. I then prayed for knowledge and guidance. The knowledge was there, and all I had to do was ask. Since then, I have come to understand how powerful it is to seek knowledge, and to ask Him to supply what you need. I have access to more real knowledge now that I need to learn than was ever conceivable by me before asking.\n\nInhabitant of the Conquered lands wrote: Qualified Taxes The State Agreement\n\nThe Legislative authority of the United State Congress is \"To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District\" (Article 1, section 17), and to \"the Territory or other Property to the United States:\" (Article IV, section 3, clause 2).\n\nThe Congress of the United State under its legislative authority passed Public Law 587 on July 17, 1952; 66 Statute Chapter 940, page 765. An act (Senate bill 1999) Relating to the withholding for State income Tax purposes, on the compensation of Federal Employees.\n\nThis Act was codified in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The implementing regulations are found in Title 26 CFR part 301.6365, 301.6362, 301.6361, under what is known as the \"qualified taxes.\" This program is applicable only to the Federal District.\n\nThe program requires returns based upon a W-4, or 1099. The amazing piece of the puzzle is the definition of the State and Governor. The second part of this puzzle is found in the intentional use of the Annotated code and revised Statutes of the States party to the Constitution to create the fiction of law wherein the State is defined as the District of Columbia.\n\nWhen you read through the revised statutes, and/or the Annotated Code of this State, you will find the statutory recognition of this State being an insular possession, or Territory of the United States, or the \"District of Columbia.\"\n\nIn the Annotated Code of the General Public Laws of Maryland, the State is defined in Tax Property, Title I, DEFINITIONS, GENERAL PROVISIONS., Sec. 1-101. Definitions (u) State:\n\n\"State\" means:\n\n(1) a state, possession, territory, or commonwealth of the United States; or\n\n(2) the District of Columbia.\n\nThe tax imposed upon wages is recognized as a \"qualified tax\" program upon income by the State. This State, is the District of Columbia. The question then, is how can the wage tax, which is the \"qualified tax\" be administered outside the geographical State, which is the District of Columbia?\n\nSimple, by the \"election of the Governor.\"\n\nThe concept that the Governor may \"elect\" to establish this State to be a \"withholding agent\" on behalf of the United States applies to a limited and delineated jurisdiction. In fact the Governor in Question is defined as the Mayor of Washington, D.C.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations Internal Revenue Title 26\n\n301.6365.1 Definitions.\n\n(a) State. For purposes of subchapter E and the regulations thereunder, the term \"State\" shall include the District of Columbia, but shall not include the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any possession of the United States.\n\n(b) Governor. For purposes of subchapter E and the regulations thereunder, the Term \"Governor\" shall include the Mayor of the District of Columbia. [T.D. 7577, 43 FR 59375, Dec. 20, 1978]\n\nWhat needs to be uncovered is this \"written statement of election\" submitted by the Governor. The Constitutions of the States party to the Union, do not authorize officers of the Public Trust to surrender the Sovereignty of the People, or the State to a foreign principal.\n\nThe \"State agreement\" is based upon the statutory fact of a \"qualified State individual income tax\" program for the District of Columbia.\n\nThe \"State agreement\" would be prima facie proof that the Chief Executive Officer of this State does not know geography. Furthermore the application of the \"State agreement\" can only be applicable to \"employees\" of the State known as the District of Columbia.\n\nConfused, you should be at this point. The wage tax collected by the withholding agent at the source of income is apparently a deliberate misapplication of the law. What can be done? Apparently the Courts of the United States, and of this State care nothing for the law. Or could it be the Judges cannot read?\n\nOne thing can be done. A Freedom of Information Act requesting that the \"Governor\" provide the \"documents\" made by the office in connection with the transaction of public business with regards to the election known as the \"State Agreement.\"\n\nThe importance of exposing this \"State Agreement\" would be absolute proof of the existence of this \"Federally controlled State.\" Furthermore, this would be evidence that the \"income tax\" is the \"qualified tax\" which is an imposition upon persons in the service of the District of Columbia as \"State\" employees.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations Internal Revenue Title 26\n\n301.6361.1 Collection and administration of qualified taxes (in part)\n\n(a) In general. In the case of any State which has in effect a State agreement (as defined in paragraph (a) of 301.6361-4) the Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall collect and administer each qualified tax (as defined in paragraph (b) of 301.6361-4) of such State.

Any extension of time which is granted for the making of payment, or for the filling of any return, which relates to any Federal tax imposed by subtitle A (or by subtitle C with respect to filing a return) shall constitute automatically an extension of the same amount of time for making of the corresponding payment or for the filing of corresponding return relating to any qualified tax.\n\n(b) Returns of qualified taxes.

Such declaration shall constitute a return indicating no liability with respect to each qualified tax other than any such tax for which liability is so returned.\n\n(T.D. 7577, 43 F.R. 59365, Dec 20, 1978)\n\n301.6361-4 Definitions.\n\nFor purposes of the regulations in this part under subchapter E of chapter 64 f the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, relating to collection and administration of State individual income taxes-\n\n(a) State agreement.
