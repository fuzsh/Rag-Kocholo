I have not encountered the problem that you describe. Here is a config snippet from one of the VLT pair.\n\ninterface ethernet1/1/25 description \"VLTi Link\" no shutdown no switchport flowcontrol receive off flowcontrol transmit off ! interface ethernet1/1/26 description \"VLTi Link\" no shutdown no switchport flowcontrol receive off flowcontrol transmit off ! vlt-domain 1 backup destination ipv6 fda5:74c8:b79e:1::1 discovery-interface ethernet1/1/25-1/1/26 peer-routing primary-priority 4096 vlt-mac ec:33:d9:9a:90:3a !\n\n``` Dell EMC Networking OS10 Enterprise Copyright (c) 1999-2020 by Dell Inc.

Once powered off, disconnect the power cable from the switch below, Dell S3048-ON. Once both devices are fully powered-off and after ~10 seconds, reconnected the power to the Dell Force10 S4810 optical switch and allow the device some time to fully initialize. This will be indicated by 4 green status lights in the front-right panel of the switch. Once the Dell Force10 S4810 optical switch is initialized, then reconnect the power to the Dell S3048-ON switch and allow the device to fully reinitialize. Again, indicated by 4 green status lights Once both devices are on and initialized, verify the connection status of the trouble devices.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nJames\n\nthanks all for your inputs.\n\nProblem solved. It was a classic Spanning Tree issue coming from another switch. The cause of the Spanning Tree was due to some of my Unifi Wireless AP’s had ‘Wireless Uplink’ turned on. A new feature I think. I had 2 AP’s into the same switch and then they decided to uplink to each other creating a loop. I didn’t have BPDU-Protection turned on at the time. Anyway, this loop caused Spanning Tree to constantly reconverge and when it hit the Force 10’s it caused them to flip between Master and Backup."
