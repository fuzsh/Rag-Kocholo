        "text": "Have a look at Azure Stack HCI\n\nIt's a nice compromise if you only need a few VM's in a client environment and you can build a supported host. Vendors like Supermicro https://www.supermicro.com/en/solutions/azure-stack-hci are very reasonable for this. You can even run Azure Virtual Desktop from it, as long as you have the user M365 licensing and appropriate networking.\n\nWindows licensing is tied to an Azure subscription https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/azure-stack/hci/ on a physical core basis.\n\nWe had, for the time a relatively robust and successful CRM that used an on-site pop3/SMTP system on each of the physical hosts at each site to replicate to each other. The central CRM would reconcile the changes from different offices and send the replicated changes. This worked well for a long time.\n\nWe also had staff emails for each region on the pop3/SMTP system and they'd use Outlook to pull down the emails to the local workstations. We had Exchange at the head office but didn't have enough licenses for the rest of the offices.\n\nWe were coming up to the Xmas holidays and some of the regional managers wanted an out of office to trigger but didn't want to rely on having the Outlook running in order for the rules to trigger. The pop3/SMTP system had the feature that you could trigger an OOO response and you could set it at the user level or system wide. Being the holidays, I set it at the system level and for reasons I can't think why, I also set it at the head office. I think there were some non-exchange accounts for some manufacturing systems we used.\n\nThe next day I get an alert to say disks are full at head office and some of the regions. The CRM had been sending acknowledgement emails back and forth and send re-requests because the OOO email wasn't in an expected format etc. and I had to clear out hundreds and hundreds of thousands of garbage emails. I thankfully had remote access to all the systems and nothing fell over. The CRM ended up not even being out of sync but that took a while to verify.\n\nThankfully, I got companywide Exchange in after that and made sure to never mess with autorespond on the pop3/system in the future.\n\nRe: Why not share via Bitwarden?\n\nI've worked at a number of MSP's before and having an enterprise grade password sharing system is paramount. Ideally you'd have everything authenticating through an individual's identity for each client, but there are just some systems that won't allow it or it's prohibitively expensive for the services cost model.\n\nThe password gets wiped from the systems memory and the password is never shown on screen in clear text. Every access for the password is audited and there is granular control on access for each password, if you need it.\n\nIt also helps you with password rotation with reminders to change passwords etc.\n\nIt isn't completely foolproof, but nothing ever is. I'm not aware of any of the systems that were used ever having a password based breach.\n\nThere is quite a bit of discussion with customers about repatriating services and data\n\nWe've had quite a few discussions with customers about going into Cloud now in Australia and then bringing those services back to New Zealand when the Cloud Platforms are available. This seems to sit well with a lot of customers, and we've had a lot of commitment on the basis of Azure and now AWS committing to build into New Zealand.\n\nI think interestingly that the Virtual Desktop products are one of the hottest tickets of discussion. I had thought VDI was going away, but it has returned with a vengeance, especially with the extended lockdowns we've had and customers moving into further commoditisation of bring your own endpoint options.\n\nNew Zealand has been shown in recent times to be a forward thinking, digital ready market, and I think this is the outcome of this.\n\nI experienced a similar NAT problem about a decade ago\n\nA security engineer installed a new Barracuda appliance at a community college. The next day I get a call out that their SBS server had crashed and no mail was being sent or received and the SBS was generally not serving requests.\n\nWhen I looked at the system, the mail queue had 300k objects and I had to halt all services just to stop things crashing. I did a lot of cleanup, which I won't bore you with the details of. I then investigated wtf happened and it turned out that the Barracuda had NATd all public SMTP delivery to appear as an internal IP to the Exchange server. The problem is that the college had previously put in a SMTP relay configuration that trusted all internal IPs. Some spammers had quickly identified this and smashed it to send out their payloads. The public IP finally got blacklisted and I had to then go through the fun of getting them whitelisted through all the PBLs etc.\n\nSecurity had managed to make the environment worse, but did fix it afterwards.\n\nA company I worked for back in the early 2000s\n\nAcquired a business that was owned by a guy that also owned the local video sex shop and was very relaxed on what could be on systems or openly watched.\n\nThere was a grace period to get people to clear out anything that breached our business policies, but one guy was too far gone and not only kept about half a terabyte on the file server, but would also openly watch it.\n\nWe ended up having to fire the guy after multiple warnings and I don't think he could reconcile that he'd done anything wrong.\n\nI found stuff in folders for months after that.\n\nMobile tech gets old quickly\n\nI can understand the predicament that vendors have with mobile phones as even though the form factors aren't changing that much, the componentry dramatically changes in new phones across 5 (or even 3 years). We have problems keeping spare parts for enterprise IT equipment for that long because of the supply chain changes. You should see how much HPE charge if you want hardware support beyond those periods.\n\nI'd be of the opinion that vendors should allow you to move to a generic Android or customised ROM once support for your device ends, so you can at least continue to receive software updates.\n\nGoing back to the hardware topic, it's possibly an option like what they have done with some OS's to have a long term release version that people can choose to purchase that gives them a longer period of support and parts availability. The question though would be whether it was in anyone's financial interest to do so.\n\nI'm excited about robo-taxis and automated vehicles in general but...\n\nI think somewhere like China had to do it first, for less than ethical reasons.\n\nFirst is the insurance company model, especially in the West, still hadn't got the situation sorted regarding culpability with incidents with automated cars. Second, China has the kind of control that could strong arm any bad PR off the face of the earth, until robo-taxis become the norm and the bugs are tweaked out of it.\n\nI might be just following the trope of China = bad, but like a few developments in the last decade or so, there's had to be an element of Wild West before things become a bit more established and adhere to protocols etc.\n\nI'm really hoping one day to convince my City of residence, Auckland, to invest heavily in automated vehicles, because we are about 20 years behind schedule infrastructure wise.\n\nRe: Reg 'fridge\n\nI actually did my University last year project on this in 2000. It unfortunately wasn't viable back then, but the cost and supply chain/blockchain availability makes it way more viable than it ever was. The other problem back then was the network connectivity and IoT capability. The latter of this article shows this still is in its infancy.\n\nI've worked with a number of power groups using SCADA and even their enterprise industry grade boxes are poor protection wise and so any hope of customer grade being anywhere near protected is a pipe dream.\n\nI imagined a connected kitchen that a) could determine the power requirements for food in microwaves and ovens, b) could actually start cooking food based on your remote commands and c) would give you meal recommendations based on what you had in your house and the expiry dates etc.\n\nI wanted to patent a) but there was already ambiguous submissions that would have contested it.\n\nI quickly read the Libra White Paper\n\nIt is here if you are interested\n\nhttps://libra.org/en-US/white-paper/\n\nI'd say a decent amount of provisions have been made, like the establishment of an independent subsidiary Calibra.\n\nKYC of all users is required, so I'd say the national security risk excuse is bunk. Could it destabilise established currencies in the future? Possibly, but it is supposed to be a stable coin.\n\nThe backing of the currency with assets is something that should help with the coin confidence. https://libra.org/en-US/about-currency-reserve/#the_reserve\n\nTo be honest, I understand the concern about anything associated with Facebook being bad news, but if you think about why they would want this to exist, it's just a really great way of removing the barrier to entry for so many commercial platforms. They could effectively wipe away any currency conversion costs that currently cost them money and hassle. No doubt that they could probably drive analytics on your purchase patterns etc. which will be another revenue stream, but the fact that Visa and Mastercard are already on the Libra consortium suggests this isn't going to be something new to them.\n\nI never understood the position of the 'victim' to have the position on whether to press charges or not. Regardless of the decision, the person did or didn't break a law. Why it matters how Pai thought on the issue should be irrelevant to whether charges should be held. I guess police would prefer to have the backing of the victim as they are able to get co-operation and conviction that way. Does anyone ask the family of a murdered person whether they want the case dropped or not.\n\nI despise Pai and all the self interested groups that have removed Net Neutrality and have had fantasies of making them suffer, but stooping to their level or worse will always come back to bite the other side in the ass. I wouldn't almost counter that they are banking on the over-reactions to justify the means.\n\nHow did they manage to miss this opportunity?\n\nStop Inspiring Sex Traffickers Act (SISTA) - Fight Internet Sex Trafficking Act (FISTA). Nod to Ali-G.\n\nOn a more serious note, places like Australia and New Zealand take a much more pragmatic approach of legalising brothels and escort agencies and aggressively patrol it, rather than forcing it underground. Anyone trying to circumnavigate the rules gets the full force of the law. I believe women (and men) that choose to be involved in the business are vetted to ensure there isn't a coercion underbelly.\n\nI am beyond being surprised that any of the recent legislation coming out of the USA is anything less than a capitalist, oppressor, oligarchical wet dream. Nothing is allowed to hit the Senate or Congress without it being meddled and having cheap shot caveats injected into the legislation. Adding riders is just another unbelievable perversion.\n\nSemantics of a word\n\nThe argument I have seen for this is determining what the word unlimited is. To me, unlimited in the context of internet is unlimited bandwidth. I have been led to believe that the industry wants to use it as unlimited availability. It is an easy assumption to make when you have been on a capped service and move to an unlimited service that there is no cap, meaning you have unlimited availability and bandwidth. I don't know why one would be surprised by this confusion? I guess it gives the ISP's an easy out when they say \"Oh we meant X, not Y\" and then boot people who they perceive are abusing the service, but can still advertise it as just unlimited.\n\nIt also gets interesting when they perceive you to be using a home broadband connection for business services. They can get nasty about that too.\n\nRe: AWESOME!!!\n\nI wish I could agree with you, but I don't. Every project I have to work on as an integrator is hampered by the shortfallings of Hyper-V. People need to remember the following: If your environment is complex or mission criitical and doesn't require multiple hook ins to your DR, storage and other automation products, Hyper-V is not for you. It is good enough for a simple environment that doesn't need in-depth root cause analysis because the available tools (3rd party or Microsoft) are lacking.\n\nIt does a reasonable job regarding VM management, but it still feels at the level of an ESXi 5.0 environment i.e. rough around the edges, but good enough. Expect to spend the amount you saved on licenses and more on getting people to troubleshoot and configure your environment\n\nThis is how I see it going\n\nThe final block will finally be sliced up and exhausted and then we will be on to the exciting game of highest bidder wins. Like carbon credits, the price will go up as the availability decreases and especially ISP's and hosting companies will have to acquire ranges any way they can. I have already been involved in a project where a company had an entire migration to a managed datacentre for their web-servers (some major clients) which was pretty involved, for the princely sum of a /20 range that they owned.\n\nI also know Universities that have so many public IPs that they use public ranges internally so don't be surprised if they suddenly make a quick buck by selling some of those ranges.\n\nThe tipping point is when the price of these ranges changing hands becomes more expensive than just upgrading the infrastructure/using 6to4/etc. The question in my mind is just how quickly these prices go up. If it is reasonably gradual, then the majority will have time to get themselves sorted. If if goes into the stratosphere very quickly, then get out the popcorn because it is going to get interesting.\n\nBeware uninformed customers\n\nI worked for an insurance remediation contractor service in the UK on the IT side. I had to write a number of workflow systems through the CRM system to filter out anything that wasn't a verifiable complaint so it could could be correctly reflected in the reporting system.\n\nPeople would complain because of things like we couldn't replace the model of sink that was manufactured 20 years ago or because we wouldn't repair beyond \"as fit\" (as per your insurance agreement). The majority of the real issues lay down to heel dragging on behalf of the insurer, agreed scope of the work and the customers understanding of that (i.e. it may not have been explained well). Most people don't read the fine print in their insurance and get bitten by it. Just because it was the cheapest insurance doesn't equate to equal coverage to a more expensive one.\n\nI am working on a education VDI deployment\n\non a large greenfield campus. Their preferential vendor was Dell and their core switching is Brocade.\n\nPricing up the Dell Blades was a strange one because the M620 comes with 10G on the LOM. Additional 10GB Broadcom cards were the same price as 1GB cards and that is before the insane discounts that the education sector gets.\n\nThe M1000e was kitted out with 6x IO Aggregators which have QSFP+ on board for a 40GB to uplink. Unless you start spending silly money trying to convert the QSFP+ to optical, you need a SFP+ or QSFP+ capable switch. The one that made sense was the Force10 S2410, but it doesn't exist any more so we had to go for the S4810 which comes in at $30k and then there is the price of the cables. Again education prices made these dramatically cheaper.\n\nWhere it got really expensive was the Brocade MLXe 24 port SFP+ modules. Unfortunately the Brocade MLXe doesn't support 40GB QSFP+, but their top of rack switches, the ICX 6615 does. Also Dell were being really fussy about what they would support, so this became a no go.\n\nSo really, this reiterates what others have said. Switch prices and options are the problem. I am struggling to justify having 96 SFP+ ports on a two-switch redundancy design, but it was really the only option given to us. When the environment is fully kitted out with SANs, uplinks, connections to the Blade Chassis, we will only need to use 4 per blade chassis, 1 per iscsi SAN and maybe 4 to the core.\n\nDatacentres have a different problem, but environments that are smaller really need some smaller switch options to justify 10GB or a reduced price point."
