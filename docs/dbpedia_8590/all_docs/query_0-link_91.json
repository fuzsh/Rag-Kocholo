        "text": "Mr. Tyrone Taylor\n\nI have tried to order a new dell desktop CPU for three weeks usning my Dell Preferred Account. NO ONE has been successful in resolving this and I am tired of speaking with individuals in another country with very strong accents that cannot correct my issues. I have had a Dell account for 16 years and I have never had such deplorable service I am not bigoted by no means, but we need to fix the communication. WE have people in this country who do these same jobs, How come I cannot communicate with them to get my issue solved.\n\nReply\n\nAgreeDisagreeGoodSpam\n\nMr. Donald Johnson\n\nI am a consumer with a professional home-based business. An XPS system was purchased and it did NOT work. A replacement unit was sent and it did NOT work Hours have been wasted by me, to no avail, trying to get answers and fixes. If anything could go wrong with ordering a product, Dell got it wrong starting with everything from placing the initial order to returning the non-working systems. I have never dealt with a company as bad as Dell\n\nDonald Johnson .\n\nReply\n\nAgreeDisagreeGoodSpam"
