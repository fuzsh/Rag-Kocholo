Acquiror shall not assume any Company Options and each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall immediately vest as to 100% of the shares subject to such Company Option, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, and, at the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Option multiplied by (B) the Cash Amount Per Share, less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation and Acquiror shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from such payment made to the holder of a Company Option the amount of withholding for Taxes required to be deducted and withheld as a\n\n10\n\nresult of the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.1(b)(ii). The amount of cash each Company Optionholder is entitled to receive for the Company Options held by such Company Optionholder shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all Company Options held by such Company Optionholder. As soon as practicable following the Closing, Acquiror shall pay, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay to each Company Optionholder the cash (if any and less any applicable Taxes required to be deducted and withheld) required to be paid to any such Company Optionholder pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(ii).\n\n(iii) Company Restricted Stock Units.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the Appraisal Shares) of Company capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (Section 262) shall not be converted into the right to receive cash as provided in Section 2.1(b), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive cash as provided in Section 2.1(b). The Company shall give prompt notice to Acquiror of (i) any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company capital stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the Delaware Law received by the Company, and (ii) Acquiror shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands as permitted by Delaware Law. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Acquiror, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.\n\n11\n\n(c) Purchase Price Adjustment. In the event that the Closing Cash, as reflected in the Closing Cash Balance Sheet, or if audited pursuant to Section 8.3(e)(ii), as reflected in the Audited Closing Cash Amount, is less than the Closing Cash Target, the Cash Amount Per Share shall be reduced by an amount equal to the quotient of (A) the difference between (i) the Closing Cash Target, minus (ii) the Closing Cash, divided by (B) the number of Company Fully-Diluted Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that for all purposes hereof, the Cash Amount Per Share, as so adjusted, shall be rounded down to the nearest 1/10 (one-tenth) of a cent; provided, further, that the difference between the Closing Cash Target and the Closing Cash, as calculated pursuant to clause (A) of this Section 2.1(c) shall under no circumstances exceed $13,000,000.00. For purposes hereof, the Company shall provide to Acquiror, on or prior to the Tentative Closing Date, the calculation of the number of Company Fully-Diluted Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.\n\n(d) Cancellation of Company-Owned Stock. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b), each share of Company Capital Stock held by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.\n\n(e) Adjustments. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Capital Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, all references in this Agreement to specified numbers of shares of any class or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based upon numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading prices therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like change.\n\n2.2 Effects of the Merger.

At and after the Effective Time, Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and directors shall be authorized to execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments, instruments and assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.\n\nARTICLE 3\n\nREPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY\n\nSubject to the exceptions set forth in a numbered or lettered section of the disclosure letter of the Company addressed to Acquiror, dated as of the Agreement Date and delivered to Acquiror concurrently with the parties execution of this Agreement (the Company Disclosure Letter) referencing a representation or warranty herein (each of which exceptions, in order to\n\n13\n\nbe effective, shall clearly indicate the section and, if applicable, the subsection of this Article 3 to which it relates (unless and to the extent the relevance to other representations and warranties is reasonably apparent from the actual text of the disclosed exception), and each of which exceptions shall also be deemed to be representations and warranties made by the Company under this Article 3), and except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof (but only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure set forth in such Company SEC Documents that such information is applicable to the sections of this Article 3, and specifically excluding any risk factors, forward looking statements or any documents referred to or incorporated by reference therein), the Company represents and warrants to Acquiror as follows:\n\n3.1 Organization and Good Standing.
