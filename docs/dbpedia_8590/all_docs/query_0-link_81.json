        "text": "Citation preview\n\nDell Vision. Drive. Stamina. That's where we started. For nearly three decades, Dell has been on an incredible journey, experiencing positive growth on a global scale. Through it all, it's our people — customers, business partners and team members — who keep us moving through the rapidly evolving world of technology. Key moments in our history. Our company history is full of interesting developments. And we couldn't help but pick out a few of our favorite milestones to share:\n\n-\n\n1984 — At the age of 19, Michael Dell found PC's Limited with $1,000 and a game-changing vision for the technology industry.\n\n-\n\n1988 — We complete our initial public offering, raising $30 million and increasing market capitalization from $1,000 to $85 million.\n\n-\n\n1992 — Dell debuts on the Fortune 500, making Michael Dell the youngest CEO on the list. 1996 — Dell.com launches, generating $1 million in sales per day just six months after site is live. 2001 — Dell becomes the No. 1 computer systems provider worldwide. 2005 — Dell tops the list of \"America's Most Admired Companies\" in Fortune magazine. 2010 — Dell is ranked the No. 1 healthcare information technology services provider in the world according to Gartner, Inc.\n\nDell Inc. (formerly Dell Computer) is an American multinational computer technology corporation based in Round Rock, Texas, United States, that develops, sells, repairs and supports computers and related products and services. Bearing the name of its founder,Michael Dell, the company is one of the largest technological corporations in the world, employing more than 103,300 people worldwide.[2] Dell is listed at number 38 in theFortune 500 list.[3] In 2012 it was the third largest PC vendor in the world after HP andLenovo.[4] Dell sells personal computers, servers, data storage devices, network switches, software, computer peripherals, HDTVs, cameras, printers, MP3 players and also electronics built by other manufacturers. The company is well known for its innovations in supply chain management and electronic commerce, particularly its direct-sales model and its \"build-to-order\" or \"configure to order\" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.[5][6][7] Until a few years ago Dell was mainly a pure hardware vendor, but with the acquisition of Perot Systems Dell entered the -very profitable- market for IT services and additional acquisitions in storage and networking systems allow the company to offer complete solutions for enterprise customers compare to their original portfolio of computers only[8] Dell is the sixth largest company in Texas by total revenue, according to Fortunemagazine.[9] It is the second largest non-oil company in Texas – behind AT&T – and the largest company in the Greater Austin area.[10]\n\nOn February 5, 2013 Dell announced a leveraged buyout by founder Michael Dell andSilver Lake Partners, with additional funding from Microsoft. The deal is pending shareholder approval[11][12][13] as of March 2013.[14] History Dell traces its origins to 1984, when Michael Dell created PCs Limited while a student of the University of Texas at Austin. The dorm-room headquartered company sold IBM PC-compatible computers built from stock components. Dell dropped out of school to focus full-time on his fledgling business, after getting about $300,000 in expansion-capital from his family.\n\nlogo for Dell until 1989 In 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the Turbo PC, which sold for $795. [17] PCs Limited advertised its systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers and custom assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options. The company grossed more than $73 million in its first year of operation. The company changed its name to Dell Computer Corporation in 1988 and began expanding globally. In June 1988, Dell's market capitalization grew by $30 million to $80 million from its June 22 initial public offering of 3.5 million shares at $8.50 a share.[18] In 1992, Fortunemagazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.[19] In 1993, to complement its own direct sales channel, Dell planned to sell PCs at big-box retail outlets such as Wal-Mart, which would have brought in an additional $125 million in annual revenue. However, Bain consultant Kevin Rollins persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals, believing they would be money losers in the long run.[20] Growth in 1990s and early 2000s[edit] From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps.[21] Dell attained and maintained the #1 rating in PC reliability and customer service/technical support, according to Consumer Reports, year after year, during the mid-to-late 90s through 2001 right before Windows XP was released. In 1996, Dell began selling computers through its website, and in 2002, it expanded its product line to include televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers. Dell's first acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies. Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999. In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett Packard (the 4th place PC maker), the combined Hewlett Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead. Dell grew the fastest in the early 2000s.[5] In 2003, the company was rebranded as simply \"Dell Inc.\" to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers.[22] In 2004, Michael Dell resigned as CEO while retaining the position of Chairman,[23] handing the CEO title to Kevin Rollins who had been President and COO since 2001. Under Rollins, Dell began to loosen its ties to Microsoft and Intel, the two companies responsible for Dell's dominance in the PC business. During that time, Dell acquired Alienware,[24] which introduced several new items to Dell products, including AMD microprocessors. To prevent cross-market products, Dell continues to run Alienware as a separate entity, but still a wholly owned subsidiary.\n\nHowever in 2005, while earnings and sales continued to rise, sales growth slowed considerably, and the company stock lost 25% of its value that year.[25] Dell faced a lot of flak, when it had to recall 35000 batteries, when its laptops caught fire. By June 2006, the stock traded around $25 USD which was 40% down from July 2005—the high-water mark of the company in the post-dotcom era. 2006 marked the first year that Dell's growth was slower than the PC industry as a whole. By the fourth quarter of 2006, Dell lost its title of the largest PC manufacturer to rival Hewlett Packard. And again in February 2007, Dell became the subject of formal investigations by the US SEC and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York for shortfalls in its projected earnings. Since then, Dell has come a long way. On February 27, 2008, Dell became the first computer company to join The Climate Group, highlighting the company's commitment to environmental leadership, energy-efficiency and carbonneutral operations. It has successfully undertaken various recycling projects in different countries. Dell has been attempting to offset its declining PC business, which still accounted for half of its revenue and generates steady cash flow,[51] by expanding into the enterprise market with servers, networking, software, and services.[52] It avoided many of the acquisition writedowns and management turnover that plagued its chief rival Hewlett Packard.[43] Dell also managed some success in taking advantage of its high-touch direct sales heritage to establish close relationships and design solutions for clients. However, the company was unable to convince the market that it could thrive or made the transformation in the post-PC world, as it suffered continued declines in revenue and share price.\n\nExtra\n\nDell Inc.\n\nThe Dell logo since 2010\n\nType\n\nPublic (pending 2013 buyout)\n\nTraded as\n\nNASDAQ: DELL SEHK: 4331 NASDAQ-100 Component S&P 500 Component\n\nIndustry\n\nComputer hardware Computer software\n\nIT consulting IT services\n\nFounded\n\nAustin, Texas, U.S. (May 1, 1984)\n\nFounder(s)\n\nMichael Dell\n\nHeadquarters\n\n1 Dell Way, Round Rock, Texas, United States[1]\n\nArea served\n\nWorldwide\n\nKey people\n\nMichael Dell (Chairman & CEO)\n\nProducts\n\nDesktops, netbooks,notebooks, peripherals,servers, printers, scanners,smartphones, storages, televisions\n\nRevenue\n\nUS$ 56.94 billion (2013)[2]\n\nOperating\n\nUS$ 3.01 billion (2013)[2]\n\nincome\n\nNet income\n\nUS$ 2.37 billion (2013)[2]\n\nTotal assets\n\nUS$ 47.54 billion (2013)[2]\n\nTotal equity\n\nUS$ 10.68 billion (2013)[2]\n\nEmployees\n\n108,800 (2013)[2]\n\nSubsidiaries\n\nAlienware, Dell Services,Force10, SonicWall, WYSE,SecureWorks, KACE Networks,Exanet, Compellent, AppAssure Software, Quest Software,Make Technologies\n\nWebsite\n\nDell.com"
