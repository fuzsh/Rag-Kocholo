However, this module may be compatible with other models and their software versions.\n\n-S4810(software version 9.2(0.2))\n\nThis module supports the following functionality:\n\nVLAN Creation and Deletion\n\nInterface Configuration\n\nPort Channel Creation and Deletion\n\nConfiguration Updates\n\nFirmware Updates\n\nBecause the Puppet agent cannot be directly installed on a Dell Force10 switch, the agent can be managed either using the Puppet Master server, or through an intermediate proxy system running a Puppet agent. The following are the requirements for the proxy system:\n\nPuppet 2.7.+\n\nTo configure a Dell Force10 switch, the device type specified in device.conf must be dell_ftos. The device can either be configured within /etc/puppet/device.conf, or, preferably, create an individual config file for each device within a sub-folder. This is preferred because it allows the user to run the Puppet against individual devices, rather than all devices configured.\n\nTo run the Puppet against a single device, use the following command:\n\nExample configuration /etc/puppet/device/force10.example.com.conf:\n\nThis module can be used to configure VLANs, interfaces, and port channels on Dell Force10 switch. For example:\n\nThis creates a port channel 128, based on the values defined for various parameters in the above definition.\n\nThis creates VLAN 180 and add TenGigabitEthernet 0/16 and 0/17 interfaces as tagged in the above definition.\n\nCan use require property to maintain order between resource configurations, as below\n\nYou can also use any of the above operations individually, or create new defined types, as required.\n\nFor additional examples, see tests folder."
