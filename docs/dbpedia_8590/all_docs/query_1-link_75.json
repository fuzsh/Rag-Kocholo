        "text": "Attention Hewlett-Packard: Michael Dell thinks that you should stay in the personal computer business.\n\nSpeaking at the Oracle OpenWorld convention on Tuesday, Mr. Dell laid out why his company, Dell Inc., the world’s second-largest maker of PCs, likes what many consider a low-margin business with poor growth prospects. In August H.P., the biggest PC company, announced it was thinking about what to do with its business, including a spinoff or sale.\n\n“There are many reasons to stay committed,” said Mr. Dell, who did not need to mention H.P. to make the distinction to the tech-savvy crowd. He said that 5 percent of the world’s microprocessors go into servers and storage and 95 percent go into PCs. The same is true for disk drives and other components, he said.\n\nThe indication was that the PC business, in itself a low margin affair, gives a big hardware maker steady supply and pricing power for other products. “Give up that scale and you need to raise your prices.”\n\nBesides, Mr. Dell said, “Dell is an end-to-end solutions company,” offering hardware that ranges from the biggest computer servers to low-priced PCs for business and consumers.\n\nIt was a reasonably cogent argument for the PC, but it did ignore a critical fact: The H.P. chief executive who made the announcement about possibly getting out of PCs, Léo Apotheker, lost his job in late September, in part for the bad way he handled its announcement. The new chief executive, Meg Whitman, has said she will look at the business afresh. Apparently Mr. Dell thinks she should keep competing with him.\n\nMr. Dell was introduced by Oracle’s president, Mark Hurd, who used to compete against Mr. Dell as H.P.’s C.E.O. Mr. Hurd had made similar points about the PC business’s enabling supply and pricing power when he ran H.P. On Tuesday morning, however, he was all about Dell, calling it “a great company to work with,” and adding, “we value their access to emerging markets.”\n\nThat may not be all Mr. Hurd values. Oracle is going to great lengths at this conference to portray itself as a comprehensive company something like an enterprise computing version of Apple, designing hardware and software to work together from the start. The most notable gap in Oracle’s own end-to-end proposition is any kind of personal device. In addition, the kind of high-end data center networking that Dell picked up with last year’s acquisition of a company called Force 10 is a critical part of Oracle’s boast that its servers and storage systems are multiples faster than the competition.\n\nIs this something Oracle needs as it continues its seemingly relentless growth? With $62 billion in revenue, Dell seems like a company too big to acquire. But those PCs are so low margin that Dell’s market cap is just $26 billion, including $15 billion in cash on its balance sheet. The net price, though, is still about twice the $5.6 billion that Oracle paid for Sun in 2009."
