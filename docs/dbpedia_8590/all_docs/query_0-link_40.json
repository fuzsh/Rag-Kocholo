While I think almost anyone in IT could get behind the potential cost savings and flexibility gained by a more \"open\" approach to switching and routing (buzzword aside), and while working with Cisco escalation can be a serious pain, some things I appreciate about the Cisco empire as a whole include: solid certification programs, an overall approach of supporting standards while also extending them (basically MIcrosoft but usually without the extinguish step), and escalation support that in the end is there to produce patches and provide assistance when the chips are down, even if that relationship is not as good as it should be.\n\nMy hope therefore would be that competitive initiatives like this drive Cisco to improve the areas where they are poor, while keeping the good things that enterprise-type customers need and will not be easily met by jamming a bunch of NICs in a Supermicro Linux box (hyperbole, but you get what I mean).\n\nThe ongoing developments in network virtualization are another factor that I hope has similar effects.\n\nUpvote\n\n2 (2 / 0)\n\nMay 9, 2013\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#47\n\n[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=24454687#p24454687:oc007rv4 said:\n\nBengie25[/url]\" c007rv4]I'm having a hard time finding info on good examples problems that Openflow solves. I don't doubt it's good, but it's hard to understand how it's supposed to be used if you don't understand the problems it's meant to solve.\n\nHeretofore, each router or switch has its own local control plane as well as forwarding plane. In other words, you have to log in to each switch separately to configure it. Much configuration spans multiple switches, except for a few cases like VTP. Having the control plane and forwarding plane in the same OS can be a problem when you need to upgrade or reload the box -- it stops forwarding. Many Fibre Channel switches will let you reboot the control plane while the forwarding plane keeps on pumping packets. You can have multiple switches or routers sharing some duties for high availability, as with VRRP/HSRP/CARP, but configuration must be done individually on each box, and woe betide anyone whose paired switches are configured differently from one another.\n\nYou can't configure bunches of routers from a central place. Well, vendors sometimes have tools, and you can build your own tools that SSH to each box and change or load configurations and keep configuration in version control, but that's quite crude compared to what we have running on our commodity servers today. What we really need is for all of the knobs to be exposed through standard APIs, so we can treat the hardware network like another part of our Service Oriented Architecture as already are our virtualization and cloud and application stacks. Standards for doing this like OpenFlow are emerging, so different standards-based components can be trivially mixed and matched in a network even easier than today, when even large enterprises often choose to lock themselves in to a single networking vendor.\n\nThe Cisco Nexus series (and, I think, the EX 8200 and EX 9200 from Juniper, albeit incompatible with each other) is a proprietary approach to solving these problems. You usually have a pair of core switches that share one synchronized configuration and act as one virtual chassis -- ports from each show up on both switches, as a sort of single system image. Subsidiary switches show up as attached modules would on a modular router. The fixed configuration boxes are almost certainly cheaper for Foxconn to build for Cisco.\n\nBut that's proprietary. Only Cisco Nexus components work with the Nexus system, and Cisco knows that larger, richer, less price-sensitive organizations need or are using Nexus, so margins are very high as you would expect. Foxconn makes the hardware but the vast majority of the cost is from Cisco's software and support. Imagine that instead of NX-OS, the same hardware with the Broadcom Trident+ 10GBASE ASICs ran a version of Linux and you could install applications locally; that would be something like an Arista switch. Further imagine that the switch ran vanilla Linux and open-vswitch. You could self-support or buy support, but either way improvements and upgrades would always be available freely. That would be something like a Pica8 switch.\n\nWith the SDN stack open, no vendor would have incentive not to add a feature because they need you to buy new hardware or want to segment the market and push you up into their enterprise line where support costs three times as much. The market would be commodified like x86 and margins on hardware would plummet. The networking hardware vendors obviously have the most to lose as the value-add migrates to the software and much of the software will be open-source. With open hardware and open standards Cisco and Huawei can no longer capture the bulk of the value with their proprietary software running on outsourced hardware.\n\nUpvote\n\n4 (4 / 0)\n\nMay 9, 2013\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#48\n\n[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=24454769#p24454769:2gk6r17w said:\n\nSFC[/url]\":2gk6r17w]Uhh, what?

CEF is an optimized tree representation of the entire 32-bit IP space (but trimmed based on actual RIB entries) that facilitates CPU-based routers in efficiently determining next-hop information.\n\nOops!\n\nWhat I'm talking about is actual hardware-based forwarding using merchant silicon switch chips. That goes to your next question regarding the actual hardware they intend for this project, which is not just a server with a bunch of NICs. It's dedicated forwarding hardware, almost assuredly based on one of the usual suspects (Broadcom or Fulcrum/Intel). Look at any number of ToR switches from several vendors and you'll see a common configuration: 48x10GbE and 4x40GbE. These are almost all based on a Broadcom Trident+ chipset (with some exceptions).\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMay 9, 2013\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#50\n\nFacebook is doing itself and others a favor by co-learning, in then open, its way up to where Google is in server farm design.\n\nUpvote\n\n1 (1 / 0)\n\nMay 9, 2013\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#51\n\n[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=24455743#p24455743:2tw2c801 said:\n\nrcxb[/url]\":2tw2c801]I'll assume your switch sales number are accurate, but don't have a rationale for you.

You know ten gigabit and faster Ethernet is the future, though, because Brocade more recently bought Foundry and now reserves the vast majority of its advertising dollars to promote Ethernet and FCoE solutions. I've strongly preferred storage networks converged on Ethernet since 2009 when all of the midrange SAN architectures were based on FC, because I had a highly mature and highly available Ethernet infrastructure, no inherent need to buy a segregated pair of Fibre Channel switches, and no operational silos between networking and storage so no need for a separate administrative domain.\n\nTL;DR: it's likely you're seeing a lot of Brocade Fibre Channel switches along with some Ethernet switches, not just Brocade Ethernet switches.\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMay 9, 2013\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#52\n\nLet's see.

If software is free, that leaves more money for customers to spend on Hardware.\n\nHere we get the reverse.

Except, it's $2,500\n\nThat price omits the uplink module which will add at least another $400, while the TP-Link already includes 4 SFPs.\n\nBesides, do you really think you're making Cisco look good?\n\n\"No! Cisco is only 20X more expensive!!! Not 40X!\"\n\nThe fact is the bigger problem is the fact that IOS is a giant kluge\n\nNo, I can assure you, the absolutely astronomical prices are problem #1.\n\nThe constantly rotating firmware bugs are a significant #2 as well... Gee, do I go with the firmware that mis-reports billions of packet discards, or the one that leaks memory so quickly the switch needs to be restarted every month? Thanks Cisco!\n\nOK so lets talk real world... I happen to work for a Cisco VAR.\n\nThe *standard* Cisco discount is 38% off list price. So a $2500 switch really sells for about $1550.\n\nNow lets compare the two. The TP-Link switch offers 4 SFP COMBO slots. That means they are SHARED with the last 4 copper ports. The Cisco switch provides its SFP slots as ADDITIONAL slots. So a 24 port 3560X is actually 28 ports. In addition, the 3560X does 10Gbe out of those 4 additional ports. The TP-Link doesnt.\n\nThe packet forwarding rate of the TP Link switch is 35.7mpps. The backplane of the TPLink is 48Gbps.\n\nThe packet forwarding rate of the 3560X is 65.5 mpps. The backplane is 160Gbps.\n\nSo lets see, a switch that is less than half the switch of the Cisco and doesnt do 10Gbe, for a *wal-mart* price of $175.00.\n\nYeah apples to apples there.\n\nUpvote\n\n2 (3 / -1)\n\nMay 9, 2013\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#55\n\nYou need to compare switches that are apples to apples to understand where Facebook is going with this. Plus you have to compare \"Data Center\" switches not low cost options sold at Wal-Mart. The Catalyst 3560/3750s don't even qualify as \"Data Center\" switches when larger modern data centers are migrating to 10GbE for Cloud, Big Data, and Virtualization programs.\n\nThe most current DC switches are all running on Broadcom Trident ASICs taking network hardware commoditization into full swing. When comparing Trident based boxes from Cisco, Arista and say Quanta. The price difference is huge. Cisco sells a switch without optics for over $30-40K while Arista sells the same box for about $10K cheaper than Cisco.\n\nCisco Nexus 3064E\n\nhttp://www.cdw.com/shop/products/Cisco- ... 78213.aspx\n\nArista 7050S\n\nhttp://www.myriadsupply.com/product/ari ... 050s-64-r/\n\nQaunta white box\n\nhttp://www.colfaxdirect.com/store/pc/vi ... oduct=1650\n\nRunning an open source operating system on fully commoditized hardware will save you $20-40K per box. When talking massive scale/hyper scale DC these are tremendous savings. The operating system is what locks you into high premium OEM hardware. Even though OEMs are leveraging the same commoditized ASICs, the cost savings are not transferred back to the customer. So if you are technically capable you can load open source networking operating system onto the same hardware just like you would do with Red Hat or SUSE giving you a fully open and extensible solution with huge cost savings.\n\nThere is a bigger secret to the cost savings mix though. The underlying cost of the transceivers which when fully configured can cost more than the switch itself. Short reach SFP+ optics are most commonly priced over $1K each from vendors while that same optic from the same suppliers the vendors use \"Finisar\" sell for around a hundred dollars each. Arista did good by knocking off nearly $1K from their same optics which is 70% cheaper than Cisco but that is still 80% more expensive than direct from Finisar. As you can see if your firm is large enough it may pay off to work directly with ODMs with this open networking solution. Cloud and Big Data environments will immediately realize huge savings.\n\n[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=24451269#p24451269:3q9uni7w said:\n\nTheCrackLing[/url]\":3q9uni7w]\n\n[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=24450989#p24450989:3q9uni7w said:\n\nrcxb[/url]\":3q9uni7w]There's a ton of potential here.

Of course the latter has crap firmware (software) with a crippled and foreign user interface.\n\nWhat switch are you talking about that Cisco charges $10,000 for that is comparable to a 24-port TP-Link switch? I see the 3560X-24T-L that is comparable. Except, it's $2,500, has nearly double the forwarding capacity, supports Layer 3 roles, 50% larger MAC Table(if doing only Layer 2 stuff).\n\nThe fact is the bigger problem is the fact that IOS is a giant kluge that supports doing anything and everything rather decently. But that is a problem for some companies, where they want higher performance in certain ways than others, which they actually are headed towards with the 3560X/3750X and the switch template setups they are doing now.\n\nOf course, none of this even mentions routing, which DCs don't really do much of sides at the core, this is just about the Top of the Rack Switches which DCs are headed towards SDN for, which to me, still seems kind of dangerous and could be a giant risk. So of course a DC switch to people who believe SDN is the next best thing in networking are going to think that stuff needs to be cut from IOS, because for them, it does.

If a company is not satisfied with off-the-shelf routers, they can easily build their own running Linux, BSD, etc, but this was never an option for switches. At worst, switches are black boxes implemented entirely in hardware, and at best, you get managed switches that have some knobs you can tweak (which might or might not be the knobs you're interested in).\n\nThis is how Juniper routers came to be. They took FreeBSD, customised it to work with their hardware (thus creating JunOS), and released it at a much lower price-point than Cisco. They've even been pushing their changes back into the FreeBSD codebase for everyone to benefit from.\n\nUpvote\n\n1 (1 / 0)\n\nMay 9, 2013\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#63\n\n[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=24457885#p24457885:140onz6y said:\n\nrcxb[/url]\":140onz6y]\n\n[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=24456151#p24456151:140onz6y said:\n\njoemonk64[/url]\":140onz6y]The *standard* Cisco discount is 38% off list price. So a $2500 switch really sells for about $1550.\n\nCDW has it listed pretty close to $2,500, I don't know who does and doesn't get those discounts, but if Cisco is going to do screwy pricing, they have to lie in their bed, so $2,500 for the switch it is, plus $400 for the SFP uplinks.\n\nNow lets compare the two. The TP-Link switch offers 4 SFP COMBO slots. That means they are SHARED with the last 4 copper ports. The Cisco switch provides its SFP slots as ADDITIONAL slots. So a 24 port 3560X is actually 28 ports.\n\nOkay, so price out a comparable 20-port Cisco switch and get back to me... I'll be here, holding my breath.\n\nIn addition, the 3560X does 10Gbe out of those 4 additional ports.\n\nNo it doesn't... Not with the uplink module I priced at $400. Looking at CD-W for the 10GbE uplink module, I only see DUAL SFP ports (while the TP-Link has four), and that's selling for $1,700, which is quite a price jump...\n\nBesides, you're accusing me of an unfair bad comparison, and in the middle of it you go out of your way to confuse the specs more and make them less comparable? What bull...\n\nYeah, I have no doubt you do indeed \"work for a Cisco VAR\"...\n\nThe uplink module you priced at $400 has a $500 list price. C3KX-NM-1G. At our standard discount, you would pay $300 for that... so you wanna buy from CDW and pay more? Be my guest...\n\nTry C3KX-NM-10G... four SFP slots, which can be used as two 10GbE and two 1GbE or four 1GbE.\n\nNice little upgrade path there. Start out with 1Gb optics and when ready change to 10Gb optics.\n\nAs far as your attitude... you may be ABC but in a head to head competition I will win every time.\n\nUpvote\n\n-1 (0 / -1)\n\nMay 9, 2013\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#64\n\n[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=24458043#p24458043:1v0gobv0 said:\n\nM.

Especially when you buy it in 3 year increments. Did you know that for every $1000 you spend on a 3 year SmartNet deal you get training credits? Hmmm.... buy maintenance on the gear, get free training... Sounds like a decent trade to me.\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (1 / -1)"
