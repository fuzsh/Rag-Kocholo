This feud was further fueled on November 30, 1994, when Shakur was robbed and shot four times, Biggie was accused of being involved yet there was no evidence. In retribution, the two rappers continuously exchanged disses, that eventually got too personal, including the claim that Tupac slept with Big’s Wife, singer Faith Evans (“Notorious B.I.G” 2011). Subsequently, in 1996 Tupac was shot and killed, this was the start of a war between the two factions, that neither of the sides was ready for.

As in “Hip Hop planet” being able say the truth can sometimes worsen any situation because sometimes what we say can promote violence and whatever happens after is not in our control. The essay is about how hip hop has changed into speaking out the issues that need to be taken care of in order to maintain a proper society. McBride talked about how rappers use violent lyrics to degrade women and gays and because of this it shows how the music has evolved into something entirely different that no one would have ever expected to have changed.

In stating this Brackett is emphasizing the idea that although artists in the West Coast hip-hop scene may convey valid points, their use of “vulgar,” “aggressive,” and “hard-edged” (471) language was a key component in the media concluding “that rap music was neither ‘music’ nor ‘black’” (Samuels 24). The West Coast hip-hop scene was popular in the sense that it had great beats and conveyed a significant message, however the artists aggressive style of delivering these messages unintentionally caused public outcry and critical disapproval of rap as music.

NWA, Eazy-E, and Ice Cube shaped my current musical tastes, my mother would play their albums in the car nonstop. My youth was littered with these guy’s music, in fact, the first time I ever cursed in front of my mother was to one of their songs, and it’s because of the impact their infamous music had on me growing up, that this film affected me so deeply.
