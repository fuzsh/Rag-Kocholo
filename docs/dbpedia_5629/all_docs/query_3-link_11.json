Today, he is recognized as one of the greatest rappers of all time and a respected actor and filmmaker.\n\nMC Ren: The Underrated Wordsmith\n\nLorenzo Patterson, better known as MC Ren, was the unsung hero of N.W.A. Despite being overshadowed by Eazy-E and Ice Cube, MC Ren was a vital part of The individual members of NWA and the group’s success.

Born and raised in Compton, Yella began his musical career as a member of the World Class Wreckin’ Cru before joining N.W.A. in 1987.\n\nAs a member of N.W.A., DJ Yella’s contributions were often overlooked in favor of the more high-profile members of the group. However, his skills as a beatmaker were essential to the group’s success. He was responsible for some of the group’s most iconic tracks, including “Straight Outta Compton” and “Express Yourself.”\n\nAfter N.W.A.’s dissolution, DJ Yella continued to work as a producer and contributed to albums by artists such as Bone Thugs-n-Harmony and Eazy-E.
