        "text": "Why do privileged white people like gangsta rap? “Straight Outta Compton,” the new N.W.A. biopic, led the box office over the weekend, making $56.1 million. It’s tough for that to happen without a lot of white people going. “Straight Outta Compton,” N.W.A.’s classic 1988 album, went platinum. Three times. It’s tough for that to happen without a lot of white people listening.\n\nLike millions of suburban white kids, I was absolutely mesmerized by the likes of Ice Cube and Dr. Dre back in the day (yes, I’m using that idiom self-consciously). Having been born in 1982, N.W.A. was actually a bit before my day, but I’ll never forget the first time I saw a video from Dre’s 1992 masterpiece, “The Chronic.” The song was “Dre Day,” the withering diss track aimed at Dre’s former N.W.A. groupmate Eazy-E.\n\nI was watching something from my own country, and yet it looked like something from another planet — a world totally unrecognizable from my own. The streetscape, the clothes, the dice games, the guns, the 40s, the vintage George Clinton samples, the whining analog synth melodies that were just enough out of tune with the other tracks to sound dangerous . . . it was frightening, confusing and exhilarating.\n\nI was watching something from my own country, and yet it looked like something from another planet — a world totally unrecognizable from my own.\n\nI still listen to “The Chronic” and “Straight Outta Compton” once a year or so, but not without a degree of internal conflict. Now I think I enjoy those records for the magnificent made objects that they are. But no doubt, to my adolescent self it was ghetto porn. Or, more accurately, a kind of armchair ghetto tourism — a way of experiencing the thrill of “otherness” without actually having to be anywhere other than my comfortable home and deal with anyone other than my comfortable family and friends who were all basically like me.\n\nMore gravely, as a consumer, I was at the base of a commercial pyramid that was commodifying and exploiting an image of young black men that stoked white paranoia at a time when politicians were ratcheting up the drug war and the prison industrial complex.\n\nAnd while the music can hardly be blamed for the toxic way in which white people reacted to it, that image — as represented by N.W.A. and its members as solo artists — also undeniably glorified violence, misogyny and homophobia, rather than merely reflecting it, as the movie version of Ice Cube (played by his son O’Shea Jackson Jr.) argues in the trailer for “Straight Outta Compton.”\n\n“Our art is a reflection of our reality,” Movie Cube proclaims, self-righteously. Really, your reality? In a recent Vanity Fair video in which the real Cube reacts to Rap Genius interpretations of his belligerent opening verse from the “Straight Outta Compton” title song (take a moment and wrap your brain around the idea that such a video exists), Cube asserts that he was indeed threatening to literally cook his enemies “in a pot like gumbo.” With a smile and a wink.\n\n“That kind of storytelling, I think, is connected to all these different black traditions — traditions of playing the dozens, where we’re, like, clowning each other and talking about somebody’s mother,” says Chenjerai Kumanyika, professor of communication studies at Clemson University, rapper and someone I like to consult on matters of identity and culture.\n\nKumanyika is similarly skeptical that Cube and Co. were quite as hard as they let on, but points out that self-aggrandizing tall tales — “traditions of fantasy in which you take on a different character,” as he describes them — are common among all marginalized and disadvantaged people. I suppose if you combine a desire for escapism, a desperate search for self-esteem within a broader society that tells you you’re worthless, and a need to “make a friend of horror,” as Colonel Kurtz said in “Apocalypse Now,” you get 80s and 90s gangsta rap.\n\nObviously, such subtleties were lost on me and the millions of other privileged kids who bought those records. On the other hand, I do think the music gave us a very important view into a world that we needed to see — exaggerated or commercialized as that view may have been. I know it set me down a long path of gradually becoming a worldlier, less-cloistered person with empathy for people who’ve had life experiences profoundly different from my own.\n\nI do think the music gave us a very important view into a world that we needed to see — exaggerated or commercialized as that view may have been.\n\nWhen I asked Kumanyika if he buys my notion that gangsta rap played a valuable role in introducing kids like me to a distant but important culture, he turned the question on me: “Why was your life so separate from those worlds that you could only access them through music?”\n\nBecause a legacy of segregation and white supremacy led to me being raised in a community where there were almost no black kids and relatively little poverty, that’s why.\n\n“That’s not your fault,” Kumanyika replied. “You didn’t build the world that you grew up in. But it’s a problem when you’re only interacting with others through this music, which also offers a particular kind of representation of this other culture.”\n\nIndeed, few of us are directly to blame for the systemic racism that resulted in the deplorable conditions of places like South Central Los Angeles in the 80s and 90s, but those us of who benefit from it by dint of our identity are responsible for it, or at least we bear the brunt of the responsibility for fixing it.\n\nWhite people won’t fix racism by feeling too guilty to enjoy black culture. “Straight Outta Compton” and “The Chronic” are amazing records; everyone should listen to them and you can bet I’ll be seeing the movie (on iTunes in a few months — fatherhood). But a great first step toward ending racism is for white people to cultivate a more nuanced, enlightened view of black culture and their relationship to it.\n\nWhat I’m seeing on Instagram, my fellow white people, isn’t a good start. That “Straight Outta Somewhere” meme generator is the Hollywood social media marketing campaign that launched a million jokes, some of them quite funny. But what I don’t like are the gags premised on the contrast between Compton and your overwhelmingly white hometown or your sorority.\n\n[A] great first step toward ending racism is for white people to cultivate a more nuanced, enlightened view of black culture and their relationship to it.\n\nWhile it may appear that you’re the butt of your own joke — because it rests on the premise that you are neither dangerous nor intimidating — it ultimately functions as a display of your own wealth and/or social advantages. The joke flatters you while it makes light of the widespread suffering of poor people of color who are the victims of disenfranchisement, disinvestment, mass incarceration and militarized policing.\n\nThat condition and the culture that springs from it is the reality that N.W.A. — however imperfectly — showed us. Look. Don’t gawk."
