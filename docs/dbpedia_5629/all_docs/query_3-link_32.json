        "text": "Although I’m personally straight outta Omaha, on March 23, 1989 I went to see one of the first big-venue performances by N.W.A., the godfathers of gangsta rap. Their album Straight Outta Compton had already made them an L.A. legend and a national outrage—there was a lot of moralistic clucking about them in the media—and even on a Thursday night in notoriously conservative Orange County, the now defunct Celebrity Theatre was packed with a crowd more racially diverse than you might have expected. Given the group’s reputation, there were extra security guards, metal detectors galore, and everyone had to remove any clothing that flaunted the red and blue “colors” of the warring gangs, the Crips and the Bloods.\n\nWhat I remember most about the show was the whole crowd (yes, even me) joining in an exultant version of the anthem “Fuck tha Police,” and then, a few minutes later, when a fight broke out near the stage, audience members yelling for the police. Pop culture is not without its ironies.\n\nThat night, nobody would’ve guessed that N.W.A. were actually the shock-troops of a radical transformation that would put hip-hop at the very center of mainstream American culture—heck there are now nostalgia FM stations that play gangsta rap. Or that a quarter-century on, they’d be reckoned so important that Universal Studios would release a rousingly entertaining movie, Straight Outta Compton, about this bunch of anonymous young guys who rocketed to fame, perhaps infamy, then quickly splintered under the money-fueled pressures of the music business.\n\nDirected by F. Gary Gray, the film centers on the group’s three most important members: street-smart Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), the diminutive one-time drug dealer who became the group’s front-man; music-smart Dr. Dre (handsome Corey Hawkins) who’s a master of beats; and book-smart Ice Cube (played by his lookalike real-life son O’Shea Jackson, Jr.) whose ferocious—and witty—lyrics defined the group’s outlaw identity. Along with DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr.) and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge), these three are bound by shared experience of their hood with its drugs, poverty, rampant violence, and cops who behave like an occupying army. Watching the LAPD slam them to the ground or hassle them for no reason, you understand why they’d write “Fuck tha Police”—their music is steeped in the hard truths evident all around them—or why, three years later, Los Angeles will explode into the Rodney King riots.\n\nFilled with giddy glee at expressing the taboo, N.W.A.’s music becomes a kind of prophecy. It also becomes a cash cow, leading to alliances with two business partners who they come not to trust, Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) and Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor).\n\nLike most music pictures, Straight Outta Compton is most enjoyable when it’s chronicling its heroes’ rise—discovering their message, conquering the public, throwing increasingly debauched parties. It dips a bit when you reach the split-up and, in particular, the sad, quick, unexpected death of Eazy-E from AIDS complications at age 31. The movie ends before Dr. Dre and Ice Cube—both brilliant pop minds—fully conquer the mainstream. Perhaps the filmmakers assume we know all this. While Dre would shepherd the careers of hip-hop superstars (Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent, Kendrick Lamar) and launch the inescapable Beats headphones, Ice Cube wound up starring in movies, everything from dramas like Boyz n the Hood (he wrote the original song lyrics that gave that film its name) to comedies like Friday and Barbershop.\n\nIt was always part of N.W.A.’s deal that, when people said their lyrics were too violent or incendiary, they would insist they were merely reporting on the world they lived in, just like other journalists. That reportorial notion falls by the wayside in Straight Outta Compton, which was produced, not a little self-protectively by Dr. Dre and Ice Cube—who, despite occasional moments of selfishness or pique, emerge from the movie as decent, likable, hardworking guys. Although it captures the group’s violent, reflexively sexist world—women in the movie tend to be either maternal or topless or both—the movie ignores Dre’s 1991 assault on a female Fox reporter, Dee Barnes, and can’t be bothered to take seriously the charges of race-baiting in Ice Cube songs like “Black Korea.”\n\nWhen the Straight Outta Compton album first hit, it did something that we Angelenos thought pretty much impossible—it put Compton, long invisible, on the map. More important, it turned the city into the exemplar of America’s many poor, terribly policed African-American communities. Indeed, in DJ Quik’s 1992 song “Jus Lyke Compton,” he raps about going from Oakland to San Antonio to St. Louis and seeing that they’re just oppressed as his hometown.\n\nAnd what was true back then remains all too true today, even with Barack Obama in the Oval Office and LAPD’s policy of less confrontational community policing. When I got back from the screening of Straight Outta Compton, I turned on the news and felt like I was still in the theater—they were showing the latest coverage from Ferguson. Except for the new cars and high-quality HD image, I might’ve been watching the Rodney King riots or even the Watts riots, whose 50th anniversary happens to be this week. I don’t know about you, but I find it eerie that a 2015 movie should feel every bit as relevant, and urgent, as the epochal 27-year-old record that provides its title."
