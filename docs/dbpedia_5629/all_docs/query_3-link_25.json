        "text": "Fellow NWA rapper DJ Yella made a solo album called \"One More Nigga To Go\" in dedication to him, and to help raise money for college for his nine kids. Yella reportedly also was the only member of NWA to stay friends with him all the way from beginning to end.\n\nEazy E was the front Man of N.W.A, and although Ice Cube, MC Ren and Dr Dre were primary writers, Eazy would assist Dr Dre and Yella in production and putting the ideas for songs. All of the members in N.W.A contributed equally to the group, and played large roles in the groups success.\n\nBy 1995, N.W.A had considered reuniting after Eazy reconciled with his former N.W.A rap mates Dr. Dre and Marcus Maurice Williams. However, as they were about to work together for the first time since 1989 (when Ice Cube left N.W.A), Eazy was seriously ill and died on March 26, 1995 before a full-fledged reunion could take place. N.W.A would not reunite until 1999 (four years after Eazy's death) when the surviving members, along with Snoop Dogg, recorded a song in memory of him, \"Chin Check\", which can be found in the soundtrack to Ice Cube's movie Next Friday (2000).\n\nThere are at least two theories of how Eazy died of AIDS. Many indicate that he contracted the disease as the result of heterosexual sex, whereas he fathered seven children with six different women. Another theory is, for a while, it was believed that Suge Knight infected Eazy with a needle containing AIDS in attempt to kill him, although Kid Frost (who was signed to Ruthless shortly before Eazy's death) has disputed these claims."
