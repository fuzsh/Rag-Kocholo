        "text": "Straight Outta Compton brought the legendary N.W.A back to into the spotlight. The group is iconic, as are its original members. Dr. Dre (Andre Romelle Young), Ice Cube (O’Shea Jackson), Eazy-E (Eric Lynn Wright) and Arabian Prince (Kim Renard Razel) have had a huge influence on the hip-hop and rap world, and much of their music has sparked intense debate and earned legions of followers with its brutal honesty. It also paved the way for today’s successful hip-hop and rap groups.\n\nN.W.A. ignited careers that have given two of its members incredibly lucrative bank accounts and the ability to live lavish lifestyles, and one thing they seem to have in common is a love of cars. Their garages are stocked with an ever-evolving collection of sweet rides. One glimpse is enough to instill envy into car-lovers everywhere.\n\nThe Cars of Dr. Dre\n\nWhen a person changes cars like they change clothes, it’s hard to pin down what the vehicle du jour is. One thing is certain in the case of Dr. Dre—he has solid, if not predictable, taste in cars. There are a couple he’s been photographed with, and they include:\n\nThe Hummer H2 – Go ahead and say it—a Hummer—yawn. However, when it’s Dr. Dre’s Hummer, it’s tricked out, customized and far beyond the base model. His H2 has added every bell and whistle possible. From the powerful V8 to the DVD-based navigation system, this vehicle is anything but boring. The Hummer is military inspired, created to take on any terrain or road hazard. It also has a roomy interior, luxurious finishes and lots of toys to play with.\n\nRolls Royce Phantom Coupe – In 2012, Dr. Dre was spotted leaving a celebrity hotspot driving a Rolls Royce Phantom Coupe. Was it his? Probably. If not, it’s not because he can’t afford it. The Phantom Coupe features a low-slung body that purrs with power. It possesses a 6.75-litre V12 that can take the driver from 0-60 in 5.8 seconds. Critics have agreed that the Phantom Coupe is an outstanding ride, and all have enjoyed its performance, power and design. The Phantom starts around $440,000, but with a bank account that far surpasses that, Dr. Dre can easily afford as many as he wants.\n\nDr. Dre got behind the Chrysler 300 back in 2011. He has done an ad that features both the vehicle and BeatsAudio. Chances are he has one in his garage since he inspired and approved the audio system design and sound. The commercial was well-received, and it definitely took the interest in this popular car to a new level.\n\nIce Cube’s Collection and the Iconic Impala\n\nPerhaps Ice Cube said it best, “get that car right and it doesn’t matter what you got on or what you wear once you step out of that car.” Ice Cube stands behind the sentiment—over the years he’s owned a car collection that will leave you breathless—who cares what he’s wearing. His sons are reaping the rewards of his hefty bank account as well. One has a Maserati Ghibli, and the other has a four-door Porsche. As for Ice Cube, here are some of his cars past, present and on-screen.\n\nCorvette Stingray – According to an article that came out in Car and Driver, Ice Cube’s current favored ride is the Corvette Stingray. What a ride it is too—it’s sleek, powerful and a lot of fun. Starting around $55,000, you can rest assured that Ice Cube’s is probably worth a bit more than that.\n\nJaguar XJL – Ice Cube was spotted driving with passenger Kevin Hart in a slick, blue Jaguar XJL. The XJL is a supercharged sedan that reeks of luxury, and boasts the performance of a sports car. Some of its best features include an opulent interior, a 5.0-liter V8 engine and an incredibly smooth ride. It’s true that the vehicle was probably for Ride Along 2, but who knows—maybe he added it to his ever-changing collection.\n\nLow-riders and a Classic Impala – Although Ice Cube is constantly seen with low-riders in his videos, he actually prefers more modern cars. No one will forget the 1964 Impala associated with Ice Cube. Featured in It Was a Good Day, it has reached legend status in the rap world. All other Impalas inspire to look and drive like that one.\n\nRap stars and sweet rides are as common a combination as peanut butter and jelly, and these two original members of N.W.A aren’t an exception. One challenge rap stars pose for their fans is keeping up with their most current ride. However, it’s fun to do—because you never know what car will pop up on the streets of LA or in their next video."
