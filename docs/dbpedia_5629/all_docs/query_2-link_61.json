        "text": "I conducted research on the influence that the musical group N.W.A had on society in the late 80’s and as well as their influence on today's society. N.W.A is very well known for having changed the music industry, and they have been a controversial group since their debut album “Straight Outta Compton” was released on August 8, 1988. The album's songs were based on the group members' personal lives. While they did rap about things like drugs and violence, they also rapped about important issues such as police brutality and racism. While it’s been years since the groups debut, a lot of what they had to say is still relevant today."
