The seven communities represented are Bella Vista, Bentonville, Rogers, Lowell, Springdale, Johnson and Fayetteville.\n\nIn addition to commissioning a fully updated brand identity package and expanding the mileage of the Greenway the Alliance has developed a plan for improvements to the maintenance, facilities, and operational infrastructure of the Razorback Greenway.\n\nView the Razorback Greenway Operations and Management Plan."
