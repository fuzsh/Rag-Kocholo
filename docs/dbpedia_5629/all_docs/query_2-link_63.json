        "text": "N.W.A was a hip hop group they started in 1986 and ended 1991. The group was started when Eazy and Dr.Dre found Ice Cube. Ice cube wrote a song called\"Boyz n the hood\" they song made them wanted to form they're own group. While practicing in Eazy's garage Eazy thought they should call them selves N.W.A the others liked it. N.W.A released their first single \"Panic Zone\" on Eazy's record label \" Ruthless records\". In 1988 they recruited Mc Ren that same year they released their debut album \" Straight outta Compton\" which tackled the issues of police brutality, racial profiling and gang violence. The album confronted controversy a real good example is their song \"F-ck tha police\" in 1989 the FBI sent a letter to group. They said they encouraged violence against authorities, this helped N.W.A break into the mainstream. Their album went platinum, Eazy's solo album Eazy duz it went platinum even quicker. They were the hottest thing in hip hop and Eazy was taking full advantage of fame. One day Jerry heller(manger) gave them their checks for $75,000 but there was one thing, the group was'nt officially a group. Jerry said they have to sign contracts, but Ice cube said even if he did'nt sign the contract it's his any ways. Jerry said no he has to, Ice cube quit N.W.A. The group wanted to prove that they could do well with out\n\nIce cube they released their EP \"100 miles and runnin'\" which called out Ice cube on the title track. They dissed each other until N.W.A broke up in 1991. Eazy and Dre fought until Eazy's aids related death in 1995. His friends' made songs that would express their future regrets. N.W.A was fearless and this fearlessness made them legendary. They are legends straight outta compton."
