        "text": "Ice Cube has invited some of his friends to perform with him at the upcoming Bunbury Music Festival.\n\nAnd they are famous ones.\n\nThe rapper will be joined by two members of the legendary group N.W.A., DJ Yella and MC Ren, June 4 at the festival, organizers announced Thursday.\n\nIce Cube is a founding member – along with Dr. Dre, the late Eazy-E and Arabian Prince – of the groundbreaking hip-hop act known for \"Straight Outta Compton\" and \"F--- tha Police.\"\n\nDJ Yella and MC Ren joined after N.W.A. formed in the mid-1980s.\n\nIt's already been a banner couple years for the Compton, California rappers. N.W.A. was back in the cultural spotlight with the commercial and critical success of the biopic, \"Straight Outta Compton,\" in 2015. And they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame earlier this year.\n\nJust days before the hall of fame induction, Ice Cube, MC Ren and DJ Yella were joined by Dr. Dre at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. It was the first time is almost 30 years the surviving members performed together.\n\nOrganizers PromoWest Productions previously announced that Ice Cube would be one of the Saturday headliners for the fifth year of the three-day alt-rock festival, set for June 3-5 at Sawyer Point and Yeatman’s Cove, Downtown.\n\nThe headliners June 3 are The Killers, Mudcrutch and Haim. Deadmau5 will join Ice Cube, Big Grams and Umphrey's McGee June 4. Florence + The Machine will wrap up the event, with help from Of Monsters and Men, as well as Grimes.\n\nLast week, Tears for Fears postponed its summer tour and had to cancel its Bunbury stop.\n\nDaily tickets are now on sale for $89 through Ticketmaster. Three-day passes for the festival sold out April 15.\n\nThe event will bring national, regional and local acts for three days of performances on four stages. Festival hours will be 1 p.m.-midnight Friday and Saturday, and 2-11 p.m. Sunday."
