        "text": "Our thoughts are with all associates and their families who were impacted by the storms across the Northwest Arkansas area on May 26, 2024. While we know many associates have damage to homes and more, we are thankful we have received no reports of associate injuries.\n\nOur number one priority is to support our associates, their families and our community. Please find below information regarding resources. We will continue to make updates available here.\n\nTogether with the Walmart Foundation, we committed an initial $1 million to support immediate relief efforts across Northwest Arkansas. We know the recovery is just beginning, and we will continue to support our associates, families and neighbors for the long-term. Find more information about our community support on the corporate website.\n\nVolunteering & Giving\n\nWe’re launching a Summer of Service, where Walmart and Sam’s Club associates can continue volunteer with local NWA organizations who are supporting recovery or were impacted by the storms themselves.\n\nEach Saturday from July 13 – August 10, local nonprofits are organizing volunteer events that associates can participate in through the Spark Good associate platform. Visit the platform to check out weekly volunteer opportunities and sign up.\n\nWithin the Spark Good associate platform, you can find additional opportunities to donate and volunteer, as well as more details about our food drive for NWA Food Bank. We are collecting food donations at the Walmart Home Office, J Street Building, MLK Building, Layout Center, Walton Whole Health Fitness Center and Sam’s Club Home Office.\n\nHome Damage Support\n\nAssociates who are displaced from their primary home for more than 12 hours may also be eligible for $300 in evacuation assistance. These associates should connect with their people partner to determine if they qualify. The people partner will submit the qualifying associate’s name, WIN and facility number to the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) People Support team to activate assistance.\n\nYou can identify your people partner by visiting your profile in Workday. In the left menu, select \"Job\", then select \"Support Roles\" from the top menu.\n\nAssociates in Critical Need Trust\n\nIf you have experienced significant impacts and meet financial need requirements, you might be able to access support through the Associates in Critical Need Trust (ACNT). Learn more about eligibility and access the ACNT grant application here.\n\nMental Health Support\n\nWe know this is a difficult time for many. As a reminder, you can access your no-cost mental health resources at walmart.lyrahealth.com or call 1.800.825.3555.\n\nAdditional Emergencies\n\nFacilities or associates with additional emergencies should contact the Emergency Operations Center at this number: 479-277-1001. Emergency calls will be handled by a crisis manager."
