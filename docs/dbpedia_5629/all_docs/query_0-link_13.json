Today, we work towards stopping violence and we remember all of the people, the families, and the friends of those who were so violently removed from this world.\n\nWe know that today is just one day that we remember publicly but for those who have lost family and friends to violence, we know that they think about this every minute, every hour, every day, every week, every month and every year.\n\nWe remember today on May 5th but we work daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly towards justice and equality for all people."
