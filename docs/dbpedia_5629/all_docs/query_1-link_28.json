        "text": "Little Rock\n\nComprehensive Academic Medical Center\n\nThe UAMS Little Rock campus is home to five health-related colleges, a graduate school, the UAMS Health Medical Center hospital and clinics, and seven institutes integrating clinical care, research and education. Additional clinical training sites include Arkansas Children’s Hospital, the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System and Baptist Health.\n\nAbout 155 Students Per Class\n\nLarge number of classmates creates a vibrant atmosphere with students from a wide range of backgrounds.\n\nSpecialty Experiences\n\nExtensive experiential and mentoring opportunities with over 900 faculty in 22 clinical departments and numerous subspecialties, 65 ACGME-accredited residency and fellowship programs, and seven basic science departments.\n\nFayetteville\n\nCommunity Setting & Collaborations\n\nMedical students at the UAMS Northwest Regional Campus work with physicians in diverse settings including multiple private practices, UAMS clinics, Washington Regional Medical Center, Mercy Hospital, Arkansas Children’s Northwest, Willowcreek Women’s Hospital, Northwest Health and the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks. Interested students have the opportunity to collaborate with University of Arkansas Biomedical Engineering Seniors as they devise innovative solutions for vexing healthcare challenges.\n\nAbout 20 Students Per Class\n\nSmaller class size creates a tightknit student group, with small rotation teams and significant individual attention from faculty.\n\nPrimary Care Scholars Three–Year M.D. or Four–Year M.D. Track\n\nUAMS Northwest College of Medicine offers two tracks for earning an M.D. degree. The three-year track program is for highly qualified medical students dedicated to entering careers in Pediatrics, Internal Medicine or Family Medicine and begins with clinical training on day one. Students in the traditional four-year track benefit from close mentorship throughout their training and successfully match into the full range of medical specialties.\n\nFayetteville\n\n“The most important thing in my personal and professional life is the connection that I will make with patients as a future physician. I chose the Northwest Campus because of this principle. I knew I would get direct experience with patients and that I would be able to clearly observe how the physician/patient relationship is formed and maintained.”\n\nOlivia Brown\n\nClass of 2024, UAMS Northwest\n\nFayetteville\n\nThe Northwest Campus is home to a nationally recognized community health and research program with more than $70 million in federal grants dedicated to improving health outcomes for all. In 2021, the campus and its work with the Marshallese and other special populations was integral to UAMS receiving the Spencer Foreman Award, the Association of American Medical Colleges’ top honor for community engagement.\n\nLittle Rock\n\nThe Little Rock campus is home to the largest biomedical research enterprise in Arkansas, providing students with myriad research opportunities. Our research teams are recognized for excellence in many areas including cancer, cardiovascular disease, bone research, infectious disease, mental health, biomedical informatics and more.\n\nM.D./MPH\n\nUAMS is among the top five nationally for training a high proportion of medical students in public health, with about one in four pursuing both a medical degree and Master of Public Health. You can work toward a M.D./MPH at both campuses.\n\nM.D./Ph.D.\n\nThe College of Medicine has offered a dual M.D./Ph.D. program for aspiring physician-scientists since 1991. This is available on the Little Rock campus.\n\nM.D./MBA\n\nIn partnership with the highly regarded University of Arkansas – (Fayetteville) Walton College of Business, a dual M.D./Master of Business Administration program is designed to prepare future physician leaders in healthcare. One year of full time coursework will be in person at the University of Arkansas – Fayetteville campus, so the UAMS Northwest Campus may be the best option for students interested in this dual degree."
