        "text": "When talking about controversy in the music industry look no further than NWA. Everything about them reeks of controversy. From the way they were formed to their music.\n\nNWA formed in the late 80's when an admitted drug dealer invested his earning in a record company. Eric Wright AKA Eazy E found Ruthless Records with money gained illegally. With Ruthless Records started up,Eazy E decided to recruit some of his friends. Dr. Dre, Ice Cub, Yella and MC Ren.\n\nIn 1989 the controversial rap group released their debut album, Straight Outta Compton. Straight outta Compton had a vivid description on life in the ghetto and where these rappers emerged. One song on the album was Fuck the Police. It insulted police officers, making claims of police brutality. The CD had some mixed reviews. However, a reviewer for Newsweek acknowledged that Straight Outta Compton \"introduced some of the most grotesquely exciting music ever made.\"\n\nAnother Newsweek reviewer added, \"Hinting at gang roots, and selling themselves on those hints, they project a gangster mystique that pays no attention where criminality begins and marketing lets off.\" Defending the group's stance, original N.W.A. member Ice Cube told Rolling Stone: \"Peace is a fictional word to me.\" \"Violence is reality. . . . You're supposed to picture life as a bowl of cherries, but it's not. So we don't do nothin' fake.\"\n\nRight about now NWA court is in full effect.\n\nJudge Dre presiding in the case of NWA versus the police department.\n\nProsecuting attourneys are MC Ren Ice Cube and Eazy muthafuckin E.\n\nOrder order order. Ice Cube take the muthafuckin stand.\n\nDo you swear to tell the truth the whole truth\n\nand nothin but the truth so help your black ass?\n\nWhy don't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?\n\nFuck tha police\n\nComin straight from the underground\n\nYoung ***** got it bad cuz I'm brown\n\nAnd not the other color so police think\n\nThey have the authority to kill a minority\n\nFuck that shit, cuz I ain't tha one\n\nFor a punk muthafucka with a badge and a gun\n\nTo be beatin on, and throwin in jail\n\nWe could go toe to toe in the middle of a cell\n\nFuckin with me cuz I'm a teenager\n\nWith a little bit of gold and a pager\n\nSearchin my car, lookin for the product\n\nThinkin every ***** is sellin narcotics\n\nYou'd rather see me in the pen\n\nThen me and Lorenzo rollin in the Benzo\n\nBeat tha police outta shape\n\nAnd when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape\n\nTo tape off the scene of the slaughter\n\nStill can't swallow bread and water\n\nI don't know if they **** or what\n\nSearch a ***** down and grabbin his nuts\n\nAnd on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none\n\nBut don't let it be a black and a white one\n\nCuz they slam ya down to the street top\n\nBlack police showin out for the white cop\n\nIce Cube will swarm\n\nOn any muthafucka in a blue uniform\n\nJust cuz I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me\n\nA young ***** on a warpath\n\nAnd when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath\n\nOf cops, dyin in LA\n\nYo Dre, I got somethin to say\n\nFuck the police (4X)\n\nThese rappers lived the life of a thug. They spoke nothing but the truth on how life was lived in Compton.\n\nStraight out of Compton was so controversial, it was granted limited air time.\n\nMTV refused to show the debut video on Straight Outta Compton claiming it was \"glorified violence.\"\n\nControversy to a whole new level\n\nDespite limited air time, Straight Outta Compton sold a million copies. Making all five rappers stars... The F.B.I, officially condemned \"Fuck the Police\" for encouraging violence against law-enforcement officers. The group members were supposedly harassed at a concert in Detroit by the Police.\n\nThe groups lyrics aroused heated controversy. Critics feel NWA glamorizes gang violence. Critics ate up the NWA but that didn't stop them. They still produced great music and controversial music for years. There second CD went off the charts, even though Ice Cube left the group, the group still went on to be very popular and controversial.\n\nNWA brought gangsta rap to the forefront where violent lyrics were prevalent unseen before in mainstream music while it caused many to picket against NWA's music and hip hop in general, it also eventually lead to the acceptance of hip hop's new violent nature, and created the environment for the likes of 2pac's and biggie's deaths the controversial style and lyrics of NWA also caught the attention of suburban kids and rather than hip hop being mostly an African American music, it began the shift to Caucasian kids becoming fans of hip hop. NWA was controversial in many ways, it can be controversy in a negative eye, or you can view there controversy as positive. But no matter which way you look at it. There music style changed the world. They are truly controversy that created cash.\n\nThese guys changed rap forever.\n\nThey were truly the first to bring the \"thug\" lifestyle mainstream. Sure, there 'gangsta' rappers before them, but none of them came nearly as close to making the impact N.W.A. made not just on hip hop, but on overall American Culture.\n\nStraight Outta Compton has to go down as one of the most revolutionary and controversial albums in history. Becker did a fine job going into it, so I don't need to elaborate on it any further.\n\nBut there are plenty of things that made this group controversial though. I mean, take for example what these guys simply did with Los Angeles Raiders clothing. People in the late eighties and early nineties were getting shot over Raiders Starter Jackets. That's a fact, and without the N.W.A. supporting such gear and making it \"cool\" to wear clothing like Raiders logo, do you think that would have ever happened? Of course not.\n\nThat's just one of the many things that made them so controversial... they made violence cool, basically. They made it okay to be thugs, to be anti-law and not give a fuck about other people. Was it right? No, but it was controversial, that's for sure. And it all stemmed from their music.\n\nN.W.A. brought West Coast violence to the forefront and were the first to show everyone how it was living in places like Compton. Nobody knew it was THAT bad, but they brought awareness to it, and while it caused even more harm than it did good at first, in the long run in really paid off because like I said... that part of Los Angeles finally started getting attention and people came to realize just how bad it was and how there needed to be some changes within that community. And while it's not perfect today, it's still much better than it was in the late eighties and early nineties.\n\nAlso, just want to point out that without them, who knows... maybe we never would have gotten movies such as \"Boyz in Da Hood\" or \"Menace 2 Society,\" and maybe would have never gotten artist like 2Pac and Snoop Dogg in the future. They easily, EASILY changed the course of hip-hop and music throughout history. There's absolutely no telling where rap would be today had they never existed.\n\nGreat choice Becker, only problem is that the group broke up way to fast. Sure the members of the group went on and some where controversial still but....\n\nJust throwin' that out there.\n\nNWA is a great choice though. From Straight Outta Compton and Fuck da Police to..... well singles careers. Eazy E did his own thing with Eazy Does it, Dre is now Dre, Cube does family movies, and I haven't really heard much of MC Ren or DJ Yella. They really only had controversy for about four years, so I'm hard pressed to say they are the most controversial musicians in history.\n\nWho cares if they broke up too fast? And Eminem quit making controversial music after like his third CD. I don't really get your point. N.W.A and there controversy changed the rap industry for life. It changed how gangsta rap was perceived and how the city of compton was perceived. There music was real. It was something you didn't hear in 1989. But they kept going at it, and eventually made it work. Them rapping this way opened the door for rappers like Pac and Biggie. They made gangsta rap acceptable.\n\nAlso getting back to the breaking up thing. If it wasn't for NWA people wouldn't have known who Ice Cube was. Eazy E got everyones name out there. NWA was just a stepping stone for bigger things. But without NWA it wouldn't have happened.\n\nThe groups importance multiplied with the release of every solo album. Cubes AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted employed Public Enemy's production team, the Bomb Squad, and introduced New York City listeners to the West Coast sound, known by this point as gangsta rap. \"In 1992 N.W.A. producer and sometime rapper Dr. Dre released the California rap scene's most influential and definitive record, The Chronic; its marriage of languid beats and murderous gangsta mentality resulted in phenomenal sales. Most significantly, it launched Death Row Records and the career of Snoop Doggy Dogg.\n\n\"\n\nYou can say that Ice Cubes and Dre's CD had nothing to do with NWA but I disagree. NWA got there name out there. Made them popular, and those two CD's became a huge success. Thanks to the controversy that was brought forth by Straight outta Compton and *****z4life. It made those lyrics acceptable and ultimately changed the game and opened the door for other hardcore gangsta rappers. What were people listening to in 1989 before Straight Outta Compton? Sure as hell wasn't Gangsta rap. What were most rap fans listening to after the release of Straight Outta Compton? You bet your bottom dollar they were listening to NWA and Gangsta rap.\n\nYou can talk about Ice Cube moving onto children stuff, but people grow up. You can't live the life of a thug forever. Anyways, that still doesn't take away from the fact that he partially changed the game along with other members of the NWA. Without NWA you don't get people like Snoop and Biggie and 2pac. It's just not happening.\n\nWanna talk about controversy? They're still causing controversy 20 years later.\n\nriverfront times said:\n\nThe City of St. Charles School District has suspended a high school teacher for at least one week, reports KMOV, for playing N.W.A.'s \"Fuck tha Police\" during a senior English class. Some students at St. Charles West High School were reportedly disturbed by the lyrics. Straight Outta Compton was released to great controversy way back in August 1988; this week's kerfuffle likely brought a smile to Eazy-E's face up in gangsta heaven.\n\nIt's enough to make N.W.A. fans want to pour one out.\n\nThe teacher was reportedly attempting to show the class how the use of offensive language has changed over time. The district superintendent told KMOV that the exercise would have been more appropriate in a college classroom.\n\nThat assertion has been a matter of some online debate, as the Internets weigh in on whether seventeen-year-olds are mature enough to ponder -- with a social scientist's detachment -- a song that was written before they were born.\n\nIf anything, this latest dust-up shows that some themes just might be timeless.\n\nWitness this New York Times story from 1989.\n\nAnd, closer to home, the celebrated Cissy Lacks case.\n\nIn the mid '90s, Ferguson-Florissant School District teacher Cissy Lacks won a federal lawsuit over her wrongful termination by the school district for, in part, allowing her students to use \"street language\" in the classroom. This from the November 20, 1996 edition of the Riverfront Times:\n\nStudents had written and performed scripts about drugs, gangs and similar topics, using street language freely. Lacks had deliberately refrained from censoring their creative writing, preferring a method that begins with self-expression and trust, and builds until students develop their own critical faculties, realizing that excessive empty language carries no real power.\n\nYou can't be serious with that stuff. Be real man. They were the first rappers to rap about stuff like that. What kind of rap was going on in the late 80's? It sure as hell wasn't gangsta' rap. NWA paved the way for gangsta rap. Like I said in my opening post it brought gangsta rap to the forefront in terms of popularity. It opened the doors for people to adapt to the culture. It ultimately changed the game with one song. They were the first rap group to come out and rap about violence, police brutality, gang stuff and so on.\n\nIf it wasn't for NWA who is to say Tupac and Biggie would've been around? They're both better than NWA as group but Biggie and Tupac were hardly controversial. And if they were it didn't really have any long standing effect on the rap game. They didn't change it. NWA did.\n\nI also want to end it on this note. Even though NWA is the group that is most frequently associated with pioneering gangsta rap. Their lyrics were more violent, they were openly confrontational and more shocking than the established rap acts, featuring incessant profanity. They controversial used the word \"N*****\". Straight outta Compton was the first blockbuster rap album ever produced. That album established west coast hip hop as a vital genre and it also established L.A. as a rival to NYC.\n\nNo matter how you look at it NWA was controversial. Dating to how they formed all the way to their singles careers. You can't tell me that doesn't matter, but it does. NWA put them on the map and if it wasn't for NWA gangsta rap would not have taken off. It helped with Cubes first album, helped establish Eazy E, and even made Dre. NWA are the most controversial men in the music industry and there's no way you can dispute that."
