        "text": "N.W.A (an abbreviation for Niggaz Wit Attitudes also Niggas With Attitude)[5][6][note 1] was an American hip hop group. Its members were Eazy-E, DJ Yella, Arabian Prince, MC Ren, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. It was first managed by Jerry Heller.\n\nThe rap group started in 1986 in Compton, California and lasted until 1991. The group originated gangsta rap and had lyrics unique to gangsta rap that were very explicit, violent, misogynist, sexist, and racist. They made them controversial. Their controversies included being banned from many American radio stations. One of their most controversial songs was \"Fuck tha Police\". The song expressed anger, violence and racism towards police officers. Many people believed that N.W.A glamorized gang violence, street thugs and the violent lifestyle, among many people in Compton.\n\nA biographical movie was made in 2015. It is titled Straight Outta Compton, the title of one of the rap groupâ€™s songs. The movie details the formation, notable actions, and disbandment of N.W.A.\n\nThey made 2 albums, 1 EP, and 7 compilation albums:\n\nStraight Outta Compton (1988)\n\nNiggaz4life (1991)\n\n100 Miles and Runnin' (1990)"
