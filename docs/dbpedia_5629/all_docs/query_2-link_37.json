        "text": "N.W.A. was an American hip hop group from Compton, California. They were among the earliest and most significant popularizers and controversial figures of the gangsta rap subgenre. They are widely considered one of the greatest and most influential groups in the history of hip hop music.\n\nWhy They and Their Songs Rocked\n\nThey helped popularize the gangsta rap genre.\n\nThey created the iconic songs \"Straight Outta Compton\" and \"Fuck tha Police\".\n\nAmong the members were Ice Cube, the late Eazy-E, and Dr. Dre, who all went on to have successful and influential careers.\n\nTheir lyrical content was also good, from revealing the hostile, underprivileged side of American living to protesting systematic racism.\n\nThey are considered as one of the greatest and most influential rap groups of all time.\n\nTheir debut studio album, Straight Outta Compton is a classic.\n\nBad Qualities\n\nTheir lyrics have also brought controversy due to listeners interpreting them as misogynistic or crime and drug-glorifying.\n\nTheir second studio album, Niggaz4Life, has far weaker lyrics and more misogyny than their debut.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nStraight Outta Compton (1988)\n\nNiggaz4Life (1991)\n\nCompilation albums\n\nN.W.A. and the Posse (1987)\n\nGreatest Hits (1996)\n\nStraight Outta Compton: N.W.A 10th Anniversary Tribute (1998)\n\nThe N.W.A Legacy, Vol. 1: 1988â€“1998 (1999)\n\nThe N.W.A Legacy, Vol. 2 (2002)\n\nThe Best of N.W.A: The Strength of Street Knowledge (2006)\n\nFamily Tree (2008)\n\nExtended plays\n\n100 Miles and Runnin' (1990)\n\nSingles"
