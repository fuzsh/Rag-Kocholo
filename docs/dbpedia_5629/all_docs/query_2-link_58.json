        "text": "NWA changed the music game in America with the release of their album “Straight Outta Compton” in 1988. Their music was an expression of the realities of inner city life with songs directly protesting police brutality and racial profiling.\n\nNWA had a great impact on America and gangsta rap as a whole. Their songs were raw, uncensored, controversial – especially for the openly racist United States of the 1980s / 1990s. In fact, the FBI sent a warning to NWA’s distributing company implying that they would take action if the rap group continued to ‘promote violence against law enforcement.’ NWA didn’t care and they continued to perform their song “Fuck tha Police” and make music that commented on the police’s treatment of African Americans.\n\nNWA gained widespread popularity among people from all over America because of their respect for NWA’s passion and honesty. They also genuinely liked the sound. The beats produced by Dr. Dre were exceptional and their lyrics were always made with purpose. People vibed with NWA’s music – even people who didn’t grow up in gang affiliated, “hood” areas such as Compton. NWA is still listened to today because they are classic to gangsta rap. They created a sound that inspired other rap groups / solo artists to make music and create lyrics that challenge the (racist) system in America."
