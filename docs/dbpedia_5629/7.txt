N.W.A. was an American hip hop group from Compton, California. They were among the earliest and most significant popularizers and controversial figures of the gangsta rap subgenre. They are widely considered one of the greatest and most influential groups in the history of hip hop music.

Why They and Their Songs Rocked

They helped popularize the gangsta rap genre.

They created the iconic songs "Straight Outta Compton" and "Fuck tha Police".

Among the members were Ice Cube, the late Eazy-E, and Dr. Dre, who all went on to have successful and influential careers.

Their lyrical content was also good, from revealing the hostile, underprivileged side of American living to protesting systematic racism.

They are considered as one of the greatest and most influential rap groups of all time.

Their debut studio album, Straight Outta Compton is a classic.

Bad Qualities

Their lyrics have also brought controversy due to listeners interpreting them as misogynistic or crime and drug-glorifying.

Their second studio album, Niggaz4Life, has far weaker lyrics and more misogyny than their debut.
