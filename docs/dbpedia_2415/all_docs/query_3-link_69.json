        "text": "Today, Imam-ul-Haq overtook Virat Kohli in the ICC ODI Batsmen Ranking as #2 on the podium, owing to yet another prolific series with the bat against the West Indies: top scorer with 199 runs averaging 66.33.\n\nBefore the Australia ODI series this year, Imam’s career average was 49.30.\n\nBatting averages are the main principle of the ICC Batsman Rankings, so the ICC would say that Imam has enjoyed a more than stellar ODI career since his debut.\n\nIn this list of 18 openers, Imam stands as the seventh most prolific opener in terms of runs, and in terms of average, the fifth most prolific opener.\n\nHowever, the strike rate is where things get messy.\n\nImam’s career strike-rate heading into the Australia ODI series was 80.31, which was better than only Shai Hope, Evin Lewis, Kyle Coetzer, Tamim Iqbal, and William Porterfield in the aforementioned list.\n\nAnd this slow, accumulator approach to an innings of Imam’s akin to a school day that seemed like would never end meant he was always quick to be on the chopping block of the Pakistani cricket fraternity, especially when a new, more promising “ingredient” emerged: Abdullah Shafique.\n\nWhat gave fans more reason to chop him was the fact that it was evident Imam was not bothered to improve his strike rate, hampering not only his potential but more importantly Pakistan’s.\n\nIn Layman’s terms, Imam was overconfident in the eyes of these fans.\n\nFor example, in an interview before the 2019 World Cup, Imam said that he was an “automatic selection” because he averaged 55-56 in ODIs at that time, and was the highest ODI run scorer for Pakistan since he debuted, leading to fans calling him “parchi” (product of nepotism) (reference to him being the nephew of Inzamam-ul-Haq).\n\nThe word “parchi” has long been associated with Imam since his international career. One bad day in the office often led to a chant of this word when he would be fielding at the boundary covers.\n\nAnd I was also weary of Imam’s strike rate.\n\nThe centuries indeed flourished from Imam’s bat often, however, it was mostly at a strike rate far from ideal.\n\nBefore 2022, Imam had 7 ODI centuries, and 5 of them came at a strike rate of 90+, with 3 of them coming against Zimbabwe (one of the weaker Full Member nations) and 1 against England at Bristol, which houses small boundaries.\n\nThe Bristol century was 151 runs at a strike rate of 115.26 to help Pakistan post a total of 358/9. However, the English openers Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow struck 76 and 128 runs at a strike rate of 138.18 and 137.63 respectively, with England eventually chasing down the total with 31 balls to spare, probably making one question Pakistan’s approach to their batting innings.\n\nCricmetric gave Bairstow’s 128 a WPA (Win Probability Added) of 0.408, while Imam’s 151 was given a WPA of 0.248, adding further doubt to the justification in his place in the team.\n\nSo it was certainly up for debate that Imam could have played at a even quicker rate. Or simply Imam at that point in time was unable to play that quick.\n\nFast forward about 3 years later, and the emergence of Shafique discussed earlier may have served as a wake-up call of sorts, as this year, Imam has currently scored 493 runs at not only a mammoth average of 98.6, but also at a significantly improved strike rate of 98.\n\nNot only has his ODI career average shot up to 54.78, but his ODI career strike rate has also crept up to 83.36 as a result to an evident change in his approach.\n\n2022 has so far also been Imam’s best year in terms of dot ball percentage, with just 40.4% currently. His average dot ball percentage before this year was 51.725%, further showing just how much improved of an ODI opener he is gradually becoming.\n\nImam has stated he “hasn’t changed much,” but how true must that be?\n\nWhat may have changed in his technique to allow for what has so far been a tremendous transformation?\n\nTo answer this question, we will compare Imam’s neutral positions and trigger movements against pace and spin from his last ODI in 2021 (against England) and from the final ODI against the West Indies played this Sunday.\n\nNeutral Positions\n\nFor the most part, it does appear that what Imam said in the post-match interview on Sunday does indeed align: he hasn’t changed much. However, there are some changes if one looks closely.\n\nWhat stays intact is his relatively side-on position from his leg stump, a high backlift (though he has brought it down a bit currently, putting him in a better position to play the drive) and a narrow stance that helps generate momentum on slower decks.\n\nHowever, Imam’s upper body-lower body combination has changed.\n\nImam has went from closed entirely to open-chested and close-kneed.\n\nThe open chest gives him a wealth of options but at an opportunity cost of a lower X-Factor stretch (which is the difference between your hip-shoulder separations at the point of initiation of downswing and the point of contact), as Harigovind Sankar discusses in an article on Devon Conway and Nitish Rana.\n\nThis is reflected in a slight drop in his strike rate against medium pace (Imam is yet to face fast pace this year), from 87.6 (his career medium pace strike rate before 2022) to 87.1 so far this year.\n\nHowever, the wealth of options bestowed from his open chested stance has also improved his dot ball percentage noticeably against medium pace, which is currently 46.8% this year in contrast to 49.4% before 2022.\n\nBeing closed-kneed may also allow Imam to be equally adept against both types of swing rather than just in-swing.\n\nYet again, what Imam said holds true for the most part: he maintains the high backlift, the side-on position from his legstump and the narrow stance.\n\nBut once again, his upper body-lower body combination changes, the same transition as his pace neutral position. This can be established by the fact his back shoulder is more visible in 2022 compared to 2021.\n\nBeing open-chested has allowed Imam to be significantly more attacking against leg-spin compared to before 2022.\n\nImam’s legspin numbers before 2022 read as 26|68.4, while this year they are currently 188|115.3 (dismissed only once).\n\nWith legspinners often turning the ball both ways, being open-chested allows the batsman to be able to make last-minute adjustments to unanticipated direction of spin off the bowler’s hand and off the pitch.\n\nIt has also helped Imam drastically improve his dot ball percentage against legspin, from 52% before this year all the way down to 33.7% currently this year.\n\nTrigger Movements\n\nImam’s trigger movement against pace in both 2021 and 2022 consists of a forward press which is then followed by a crouch and the bat being brought down, with it being brought down even more in 2022.\n\nThe forward press and crouch are qualities that aid against the ball swinging away from the batsman.\n\nImam’s trigger movement against spin is nearly identical, except that he crouches down more in 2022, now has a forward press and concludes his trigger movement by opening up his upper body rather than maintaining a closed-chested upper body.\n\nThe forward press and crouch help against away-spin, as the forward press takes his foot against the ball’s spin direction. This is reflected in his current numbers against away-spin: 107|111.5 (dismissed only once) so far this year compared to 31.3|78.5 before 2022.\n\nOnce again, this is also helped by Imam having more scoring options owing to opening up his chest."
