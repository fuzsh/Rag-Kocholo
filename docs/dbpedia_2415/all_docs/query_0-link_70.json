Terrorists kidnapped and killed four men and arsonists burnt at least seven public and private vehicles in the city and also set ablaze several dozen telephone cables in Orangi, rendering thousands of telephones unworkable. Some incidents are cited below KARACHI, Dec. 1 An MQM activist, who was going on a motorcycle with another friend, was shot dead by the police when they did not stop their motorcycle on the orders of a police party. The victim was identified as Naseeruddin Babu his companion fled the scene. The Orangi Town police described Naseeruddin as a terrorist and claimed he was killed in an encounter . SSP West was not available for his comments. TWO ARRESTED Police claimed it arrested two MQM activists after an encounter in Paposhnagar and found two Kalashnikov rifles from their possession. They were identified as Arshad and Wahid. The police claimed that Arshad had set ablaze a Larkana-bound bus on January 27, 1995 at Al Karam Square in which seven passengers were burnt to death. About Wahidullah, the city police claimed that he is an MQM unit chief and had allegedly committed 15 murders. KARACHI, Nov. 2 Orangi, where the police shot dead MQM worker Naseeruddin Babu, remained tense with sporadic incidents of shooting. MQM women activists on Saturday brought out the funeral procession of Naseeruddin Babu claiming that the rangers are not allowing men to attend it. An unidentified bullet-riddled body was found in Defence Phase-VII. The victim could not be identified. This was the second body found in Defence during the last two days. The police suspect both the victims were killed somewhere else in the city and later their bodies were thrown at the Qayyumabad drain in Defence. Public and private vehicles were set ablaze in Liquatabad, Orangi, Korangi, Arambagh and at Nishtar Road. KARACHI, Dec. 4 The worst incident occurred in Orangi Town where three men, who had gone out in search of a missing relative were kidnapped and killed. Police said Mohammad Boota, Mian Khan and Bashir Ahmed, left their Data Nagar house to search for Noor Mohammad who had not returned home. All three relatives were kidnapped and their bullet-riddled bodies were found stuffed in gunny bags in Orangi. Their missing relative Noor Mohammad was also found dead. The charred body of an unidentified man, with his hands tied behind the back, was found stuffed in a gunny bag in Gulshan-i-Iqbal. The victim, according to doctors, was probably killed and later his body was set ablaze. KARACHI, Dec. 5 Wajid Ali Safdar, MQM Orangi Town unit chief, died in a shootout with the police in Orangi his other companions escaped, police claimed. Father of Syed Mazahir Hussain, claimed that Wajid Ali was arrested during a raid on his residence in North Karachi at 1 am on Tuesday and was taken away by rangers and police in front of all the family members. The family claimed that the raiding party had given Wajid Ali a severe beating before taking him away. Relatives claimed that his body had marks of torture, and both legs were broken. Party chief Altaf Hussain severely criticised Wajid s murder and demanded an immediate action against those who were responsible for it. MQM leaders told Dawn that the family of Wajid Ali Safdar was forced to abandon their Orangi house by a PPP activist who allegedly enjoyed the backing of rangers and police. They said two police constables, Murad and Ismail, had been frequently visiting the family in North Karachi to know Wajid s whereabouts. On Monday night when Wajid came to meet his family, the rangers surrounded the apartment and arrested him, the MQM claimed.

Horrifying news are part of disinformation unleashed by the government to arrest and kill more people in the name of violence and terrorism, the committee claimed. It said Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar was on record having predicted in a statement that the month of December would be very important. The committee alleged the Sindh government had embarked on a plan to crush the urban population in the name of killing by Indian agents and terrorists. It said deployment of thousands of law enforcers in the city had exposed the government plan. In another statement, coordination committee Convenor Senator Ishtiaq Azhar condemned the killing of Naeem Ahmad, an MQM activist, who was buried by women in Korangi as men were not allowed to offer his funeral prayer and bury him .

In a statement, the committee said Abdur Rahim Siddiqui, 54, Abdul Aziz Siddiqui, 51, and Abdul Basit Siddiqui, 39, had nothing to do with politics. They are federal government officials, it added. The committee said the raiding party had come to arrest Zafar Siddiqui, the younger brother of Rauf Siddiqui who was out of the country for the last one-and-a-half-year. The committee said the three were subjected to torture at the Gulberg police station. In a statement, MQM chief Altaf Hussain condemned the arrest of Rauf s brothers and asked the President to intervene.

The MQM gave a strike call against an incident in Korangi in which it claimed rangers and police created such a situation which forced the women mourners to bring out the funeral procession of party worker Mohammad Naeem. The Sindh government denied this and said men were also present in large numbers. The second similar funeral was brought out in Orangi on Saturday. A spokesman for the Sindh police described both the incidents as a publicity stunt by the MQM. Sunday s strike remained peaceful except for a stray incident of violence in which a man was shot and killed in Orangi while a private car was set ablaze in Federal B Area. The troubled localities of the city, where MQM supporters are in a majority, remained shut throughout the day. Elsewhere in the city, the strike was either partial or there were no signs of strike at all.

Asked whether Mr Hussain was satisfied with the pace of the talks, Mr Dehlavi said When I am not convinced with the talks, how Altaf Bhai can be satisfied. Before resumption of talks the government ought to take such measures as can improve law and order situation and create an atmosphere of confidence only then a political solution to the Karachi crisis is possible. His attention was drawn to Mr N.D. Khan s reported statement in which he had said if the government s 21 points were accepted, it would lead to restoration of peace and tranquillity in Karachi and the situation of political deadlock would be overcome, the MQM team chief said this statement was nothing but a repeated joke as nowhere in the world a government had asked a political party to accept demands as it was always the government which was at the giving end and not the political party. However, he said, he would be sending the reply of Mr Khan letter tomorrow or day after tomorrow with the hope that the government would take confidence-building measures before resumption of the talks.

The MQM said Javed Raza, a member of Korangi sector committee, his brothers, Khalid Raza and Arif Raza, were arrested on Nov. 1. Despite the fact that the three were not wanted in any case they were kept in various police stations. Finally, they were taken to the Korangi police station, where Javed was booked in 17 cases and his brothers were booked in two cases each, they said. The MQM claimed that on Monday Javed was produced in a special terrorist court by the Korangi police and after the hearing took him with them. But the party claimed that till late Monday night Javed was not brought back to the Korangi police station and feared that he might be killed during a fake attack on a police party as had happened earlier in the case of Faheem Farouqi and three other MQM workers.

In a letter addressed to the leader of the government negotiating team, Mr N.D. Khan, the MQM chief negotiator, Ajmal Dehlavi, has also pressed for a meaningful response to the points raised in his letter of Cot 9 and for an environment of trust to be created to enable us to feel that the administration is genuinely in search of a lasting solution to the problems we have been discussing. The MQM released the text of its letter sent today in reply to Mr Khan s communication of Nov. 15, with copies of the previous correspondence. The MQM letter, sent recalls why the talks scheduled for Sept 26 could not be held. The reason given was the death the previous day of two MQM workers who were tortured by the law-enforcement agents. The MQM negotiating team had in a letter on Sept 25 asked the government to enquire into various incidents which they believed exhibited the worst form of state terrorism against the Mohajir youths. The government side replied on Oct. 5 but, according to the MQM, made patently false and self-serving assertions and did not look into their complaints afresh, objectively and with a compassionate approach . The latest MQM communication is full of grievances that have been raised in their previous correspondence with the government. It accuses the government of adopting delaying tactics and being not sincere to proceed with the negotiations . In its Oct. 9 letter to Mr Khan, the MQM team had raised 11 specific points. They now say that not even one of these points was dealt with by Mr Khan, showing that there is not the slightest indication of any policy decision of the government to realistically solve the crisis in urban Sindh. While in their letter the MQM accuses the present administration for being the most incompetent and corrupt and the present state of economy has been mentioned. The persecution of the opposition and the deprivation of the people of their civic vote by denying them elections to local bodies are some of the other charges levelled. The federal government is accused of flouting provincial autonomy. The government s human rights record has been strongly criticised and the killings of four MQM worker on Oct. 10 is cited as evidence to show that such tragedies have become a frequent routine against which we have constantly protested. The MQM team has rejected Mr Khan s assertion that Altaf group was responsible for genocide of innocent peoples. In the garb of search and siege operations the law enforcement agencies, were guilty of larceny, plunder and other violations. Some of these have been highlighted by human rights organisations, including Amnesty International. Many political leaders, including the Prime Minister s brother, have also criticised the reckless use of state force in Karachi and southern Sindh. The MQM team has claimed that the party s leadership has endeavoured to keep the negotiating process going by calling off or postponing protest strikes on a number of occasions to show their goodwill. But the violence against the MQM supporters continued to show that the government has not the slightest interest in the outcome of the negotiations nor is it sincere in solving the present crisis which threatens the fundamental security of the country. The MQM has said they are willing to present their evidence about extrajudicial killings by government agencies before any impartial international judicial tribunal to test the validity of their grievances and the government denials. The letter makes it clear that there has not been the slightest progress in their talks with the government. The government, the letter said, has used the channel of conducting negotiations while carrying the most cruel and brutal campaign against the MQM and the Mohajir nation. The members of the negotiating team, it said, have been subjected to severe restraints on their movement, and bogus criminal cases have been registered against some of them. The criticism levelled against the MQM of damaging Pakistan s image abroad has been refused. The issue of the supply of lethal weapons to government supporters raised by the MQM and denied by the government is again taken up in the letter. The MQM said the government denial in this respect is unbelievable and the government sponsorship of the Haqiqi terrorists is well recognised . The correspondence released consists of five letters, three from the MQM and two from Mr Khan. The first letter is dated Sept 25 and is the one in which the MQM negotiating team drew the attention of the two killings and the detention of Ms Rais Fatima, Shazia Farooq and several MQM MPAs. The talks scheduled for September 26 did not take place as the MQM wanted the government to urgently deal with the grievances they had raised in the letter. The leader of the MQM negotiating team has emphasised that the suspension of the round to talks is not because of any fault on his party s side. He said Progress has not been made because of continuous state of atrocities, including extrajudicial murders by law enforcement agencies, that have prevented any meaningful dialogue between the participants. The peace that we all seek has alluded us because the pleas by the MQM for a cessation of manifestly unlawful operations by the law enforcement agencies of the state have been contemptuously ignored by the government, the letter said.

If the present wave of arrests and raids does not stop it will on Friday decide what course of action to take. This was stated by Mr Altaf Hussain on Wednesday who condemned the house-to-house search in Orangi and Korangi areas. The MQM leader said the government in pursuance of its racist policies was trying to destroy the rank and file of the MQM so that it could eliminate its vote bank. He described the actions of the government as undemocratic and an abuse of human rights.

Khan received the 13-page letter on December 5. Commenting on the letter, the minister declared it a delaying tactics. There is nothing new in the letter, all the old demands have been repeated , he added. The minister was of the view that first MQM should clarify its position about the latest statement of Altaf Hussain in which Altaf has threatened to change the geography of Pakistan and discuss the matters relating to the national security which was a real concern, said the minister. The minister said that he was summoning the meeting of government s negotiation team to discuss the letter and other relevant issues and to evolve a strategy in the light of the behaviour of MQM team. He reiterated that the talks were un-conditional from the beginning on the very principle of give-and-take and at this stage it will be unfair to attach any condition and this shows their intentions to delay the talks as they are seeking favour for the persons who are involved in unlawful activities , he claimed.

In a joint statement, they said The MQM chief had only talked about the state error let loose against the Mohajirs in Sindh at a meeting. He never talked against the solidarity and territorial integrity of the country. Now the vested interests and the government have started a vilification campaign against the MQM chief and the Mohajirs by calling stark lies, they said adding In fact, as far as the record of dismembering the country is connected, it is the PPP which is responsible for the 1971 tragedy. This example is enough to prove who is against the territorial integrity of the country.

Shahbaz Sharif said that despite the fact that Benazir Bhutto has tried to economically strangulate his family, deploying all the state machinery at her command, his family was not talking about the damage to the business since they were convinced that the salvation of all Pakistanis lies in strengthening of the country. He regretted that as a result of the disastrous economic and political policies of Benazir Bhutto, even the PPP and the people of Pakistan were being pushed towards poverty, backwardness, unemployment, lawlessness and corruption. Shahbaz Sharif said that even at this stage, it was not too late for Benazir Bhutto to realise the gravity of the crises facing the country and the only democratic solution to this crises was holding mid-term elections so that Pakistan could be saved from further economic damage.

He said the opposition wanted the prime minister to set healthy precedents. But, he said, she failed in all respects and plunged the country into a crisis. Because of her failures, he said, the people and the establishment were not willing to tolerate the PPP government any more.

Condemning the six-month imprisonment of women workers on the charges of contempt of court last month, he said it was a slap on the face of all women of the country by a woman prime minister. Nawaz Sharif will not rest unless he forces the looters and plunderers of national wealth to run, the opposition leader said. He said two 70-year-old women were also included among the workers recently sentenced. The government, he added, had shifted them to Multan jail just to torture the dependants of these workers. Calling by name the judge who had given the verdict in the case of Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, he said all these jiyala judges would also be taken to task after the fall of the PPP government.

The prime minister in her hour-long speech expressed serious reservations over the role being played by the print media and said that it has become self-appointed decision-makers of the nation s destiny. Calling upon the media to publish nothing but truth, she said they should differentiate between the national interest and the government. Quoting several instances where the unnecessary criticism and scandalous reporting by the print media severely hurt the national interests, she said the national interest should be held supreme. The government was called upon to save the newspaper industry from imminent disaster by withdrawing sales tax on the import of newsprint. The newspapers owners were thankful to the government for waiving import duty on newsprint. The government was also called upon to clear all outstanding bills of the official advertisements.

On the one side are the democrats with principles, on the other side are the forces of dictatorship which believe in weapons and assassination, Bhutto said. The prime minister also held the West partially responsible for providing an opportunity to the clerics to exploit their cause. While the battle between democracy and dictatorship is shaping up in the Muslim world or in the South, lack of concern by the West for global issues such as freedom in Kashmir and debt repayment and cultural domination was adding fuel to combustible mixture. Bhutto said those who have emerged from the darkness of dictatorship an indirect reference to opposition leader Nawaz Sharif who started his political career by joining a dictatorial government often have mind-set shaped by the forces of tyranny. She said instead of taking satisfaction from a constitutional order, some elements were serving as agent provocateurs by claiming that the president, parliament, judiciary, armed forces and provincial governments were working as hand-maidens of the political government instead of taking on the government in an extra-constitutional manner. She said the political government of today was not facing any intrigue, conspiracy or confrontation from the different organs of the government as these organs were fulfilling their duties according to the constitution.

Altaf Hussain is creating problems in Karachi on Indian instance, Mr Shah told reporters in the federal capital. Accusing India of involvement in incidents of terrorism in Karachi, the chief minister said India has a direct hand in whatever is happening in Karachi. When Altaf Hussain owns known terrorists and claims that they were MQM workers, then I have the right to say that he is involved in terrorism, the chief minister said. The chief minister said the terrorists had changed their strategy and, in sheer desperation, they had now started targeting high-profile personalities or important buildings to harass people. He said the police had unearthed several terrorist gangs and now even the people of Karachi were voluntarily informing the law enforcement agencies about their whereabouts. The chief minister admitted that in certain cases the police had transgressed their powers, but said that the government was taking stern action against all such officials. He said several hundred policemen had been dismissed from service, or suspended or even arrested for committing excesses or for their involvement in crimes.

The minister sounded optimistic about achieving a major investigative breakthrough with the arrest of this probable financier . He said that hectic efforts were also being made to establish the identity of the unidentified body of the second man we believe was the accomplice of the suicide bomber who blew up with the vehicle carrying the explosives . The minister had to face some fairly barbed comments on the matters of security arrangements in Islamabad. He snapped back by saying that he had accepted the responsibility on the first day, adding If my resignation could contribute to the investigations I would have done so without your asking and said nothing however can stop a suicide assassin from achieving his objective . Responding to another question, he said that Egypt s internal battles were being fought on the Pakistani soil but conceded that another contributing factor could have been Pakistan s continued extradition of Egyptians . He also said that an investigation had also been launched to establish the causes for the inordinate delay in the processing of an earlier warning conveyed to the foreign office by the Egyptian authorities. To a question by opposition s Ejaz Shafi, he said that he had accepted FBI s offer of assistance only because we did not have a similar level of expertise in bomb blasts investigations and added I d rather adopt all measures that would help the investigations rather than stand on ceremony .

Prime Minister s Adviser for finance and economic affairs, V.A Jaffarey told a Press conference here on Sunday that measures to mobilise additional resources announced on October 28 and the steps taken to keep a strict control on expenditures would help the government to end the year with a deficit of 4.6 per cent rather than 5 per cent of the GDP fixed in the budget. Mentioning the recent mini run on the foreign exchange accounts, due to mainly, according to Jaffarey, rumours that foreign exchange accounts were being frozen. He said they did not amount too much and the situation was not alarming. The external position has also been strengthened by the fact that we have standby arrangement with the IMF.

After an hour long meeting with the presidents of Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad stock exchanges, the prime minister also ordered immediate release of National Investment Trust (NIT), Industrial Corporation of Pakistan (ICP) and State Life Insurance Corporation (SLIC) funds out of the proceeds of the Privatisation Commission. The committee has been asked to submit its report in two days time after consulting State Bank, NIT, ICP, Employees Old- Age Benefit Institution, Privatisation Commission and SLIC, chief of three bourses later told a Press conference. When asked as to what would be the size of the proposed support fund, he said they had not yet specified the amount. We did not go with an estimate. First we wanted to know whether it could be done, he added. The prime minister also assured that the privatisation of PTC would be completed by March 31 next when 26 per cent shares along with the management would be handed over to the strategic investors.

Mr Shamim Khan said that during the deliberations of last two days the committee had consulted representatives of the NIT, ICP, Employees Old Age Benefit Investment (EOBI), Central Board of Revenue, Privatisation Commission and officials of the insurance wing of the ministry of commerce. He hoped that the measures recommended to the prime minister would rescue the market which plunged to an all time low of 1322 last week. However, Mr Shamim Khan refused to comment on the other demands of the bourse presidents, including the setting up of a support fund for the market. They had also demanded that the government should make legal provisions allowing the EOBI to invest in the share market. Revival of investment allowance, two way convertibility of PTC vouchers into general demand receipts (GDRs) and expeditious privatisation of the Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation were the other demands put forth by the three bourses to the prime minister.

Mr Khuhro was also critical of the statement of Ajmal Dehlavi, leader of the MQM negotiation team, in which he had said that armed struggle is justified. Mr Khuhro also referred to photographs in which only women participated. He said It was part of the MQM campaign to bring a bad name to the government. It was aimed at showing the world that in Pakistan, where a woman is prime minister, owing to police threats to men, women were compelled to do the burial of the dead. The photograph of the funeral procession of a so-called MQM activists, who was wanted in heinous crimes, was in itself contradictory as in the photograph men were clearly seen standing in the funeral procession, he added. The minister said a hysterical situation was created by the photograph and a strike call was given, making life of common man miserable.

She said that the party had been given a mandate by the people and would remain in power for full five years and declared that the PDF government would continue its efforts for the economic uplift of the people. The prime minister said her government was committed to people s welfare and was using all resources to erase poverty and unemployment. Referring to the criticism of the opposition party Ms Bhutto said that her government inherited a bankrupt economy, corruption, Kalashnikov and drug culture, and a bad law and order situation. Ms Bhutto referred to caretaker prime minister Moeen Qureshi s remarks who had admitted that the economy was in shambles but she expressed her resolve to bring the nation out of the crisis.

The sources said the possibility of the government withdrawing a number of cases against the former prime minister and his family to enable legal experts to focus their attention on other cases which have some potential cannot be ruled out. According to the sources, officials dealing with the cases concerned had studied them in detail only to conclude that no action was possible against the accused as no evidence was available to substantiate the charges.

Though Ms Bhutto and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, remained the main target of criticism but he also referred occasionally to Nawaz Sharif. There was not much difference between the official PPP and the opposition PML in corruption and loot and plunder of the country, he said. Mir Murtaza touched all issues and criticised the government on all counts. If voted to power I will nationalise all the industrial units being dished out to the favourites, he said, adding that he would also review all the deals made by the present government with the foreign investors, particularly in the energy sector. Mr Murtaza presenting his case before the people asked whether he had done any wrong by asking Benazir to hold elections in the party, to throw out the murderers of the late Bhutto, to reinstate Begum Bhutto as the chairperson and to keep record of the party funds. The party was not the heritage of anybody it belonged to peasants, labourers and the masses, he said. Benazir Bhutto, he said, had twice got the power but she never think of salvaging her father s honour by reopening his trial. Benazir Bhutto who was not loyal to her father, her mother and her brother how she can be loyal to the masses, he questioned.

But, he ruled out any connection between the existing political scenario and the visit to Pakistan of Moeen Qureshi and a senior World Bank official, Shahid Javed Burki. Murtaza said inflation had broken the back of the common people. The 100 per cent increase in the prices of commodities of daily use had particularly affected the salaried class and daily wage-earners. He claimed that the government had decided to freeze the foreign currency accounts but it could not do so under US threat to stall a $6,000 million IMF approved loan for Pakistan.

Provoked by the remarks of opposition s Chaudhry Zulfiqar, Mr Kharal jumped up from his seat and shot off a volley of serious accusations against the leader of the opposition. Jabbing the air angrily with his fists, the minister said Mian Nawaz had looted national funds by usurping the money from state banks for the expansion of his own industrial empire. He also named four textile mills which he charged had been funded by misusing the prime ministerial office. An equally angry Chaudhry Zulfiqar bounced back into the argument with the sarcastic argument that we know who is a RAW agent because it wasn t Nawaz who admitted helping Rajiv and preventing the disintegration of India, it wasn t us who hijacked a Pakistani aircraft, and we also know which government s interior minister handed over the list of Sikh militants of East Punjab to the Indian government. Although over nine opposition members indulged in Babar bashing, none could match the intensity of the blistering attack launched by Khwaja Asif. Questioning the interior minister s zeal to uncover corruption , he challenged him to investigate the real causes behind the deliberate creation of a diesel crisis by certain people in petroleum business which resulted in the emergency buying of diesel at a much higher rate of 32 cents per litre instead of the contracted rate of 14 cents. He said Gen Babar was only indulging in needless bellicose rhetoric and creating cases which weren t even there. Apart from making a serious criticism of the interior minister s performance, Mr Asif did not spare any opportunity to mock the beleaguered minister.

Mr. Burki said conventional wisdom about Karachi focused on the city s difficult and seemingly intractable ethnic situation. However, he added, a deeper and more informed look at Karachi s socio-economic development in over the last few years would indicate that some segments of the city s population have suffered extreme deprivation because of the profound changes in the structure of the country s economy. He said if we understand the reason why poverty is returning to Pakistan, we will also begin to understand why it has been so difficult to resolve the conflict in Karachi. Opining that the country had reached a point where a programme for action was needed, Mr. Burki suggested a ten-point plan of action First, he said, the government must revive economic growth it should aim to double the gross domestic product between now and the year 2005. This implies a rate of growth of seven per cent a year, and an increase in per capita income of over 4 per cent a year. Second, a serious attention needs to be given to rebuilding the institutions that have either perished or are in a state of serious disrepair. Institutions include the system of administration, the legal and judicial systems, political parties which are needed to intermediate between the rulers and the ruled.. Third, Pakistan needs to put back life into the sector of agriculture which, in spite of all the developments that have taken place in the past, remains the mainstay of the economy. Pakistan, he said, needed a market based agricultural system rather than a system in which, over a long period of time, price and tax distortions have piled upon each other to the point that the real potential of the agricultural sector has been totally camouflaged. The time has come to do away with subsidies on such agricultural inputs as water, seeds and chemicals to allow the farmers to obtain full market prices for their outputs and to have available to them the full option to trade in the domestic and international markets and to allow the state to tax agricultural incomes as it does incomes from any other economic activity. Fifth, the functions of the government should be decentralised so that they respond effectively to the wishes and aspirations of the people. Sixth, a comprehensive programme needs to be formulated to help the women of Pakistan to achieve their economic potential. Women s rights should not be judged inferior to general human rights women should be provided the opportunity to educate themselves, and to enter the work force. Seventh, the state needs to provide for those who cannot meet their basic needs. With the initiation of the zakat, usher and baitul-maal programmes. Eighth, Pakistan needed a system of health insurance that would provide access to health institutions even for those who could not afford them. Such an insurance system can be combined with privately managed pension programmes that would guarantee people with incomes past their working lives. Ninth, he said, a sturdy safety net should be erected to catch the people who are likely to fall into poverty as the economy restructures itself. Pakistan is unique even among the poor countries of the world in not having any formal system that can come to the assistance of the people who suffer losses in jobs or serious declines in incomes that are the inevitable consequences of economic transformation. Tenth, and finally, he said Pakistan could no longer postpone the development of a comprehensive programme for providing basic education, primary health care, and the opportunity to control the size of the family to all the citizens. The Social Action Programme is a step in the right direction but the temptation must be resisted to politicise it by allowing employment opportunities only to loyal political workers. Today, Pakistan needs to create four million new jobs every year in order to accommodate the new entrants to the labour force. This number is well beyond the economy s current capacity. With a highly skewed distribution in incomes which had gotten worse in recent years, he said he would suggest that an economy that had the characteristics of Pakistan needed to see GDP increase at a rate twice the increase in population growth to make a serious difference in the incidence of poverty.\n\nBUSINESS & ECONOMY\n\n=================================================================== 951201 ------------------------------------------------------------------- PM allays fears over forex accounts ------------------------------------------------------------------- Bureau Report ISLAMABAD, Nov. 30 Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said on Thursday her government has no plan to impose foreign exchange control, freeze foreign exchange accounts or use safety deposit boxes. She said under Article 8 of the International Monetary Fund, the government cannot impose controls on foreign exchange. She also denied reports that the State Bank of Pakistan has refused to honour cheques of government departments. The prime minister said the government had enough funds, and there was no need to even touch the safety deposits. Earlier, she told reporters that there was no economic crises in the country, and everything appearing in the Press on this issue was baseless and un-founding. This is a part of malicious propaganda against the government, and these are motivated news by the opposition. The Prime Minister also held the Press responsible for spreading, what she said, irresponsible news without ascertaining the facts. The Press is also responsible for spreading such kind of news.

The dollar s buying and selling rates on the open market were quoted at Rs 36.20 and 36.23, a new post-devaluation low against the official rates of Rs 34.25 and 34.42 to a dollar. They said most of the rumours about the state of the economy and financial position of the government will die in due course as they are not based on hard facts. However, the big gap of Rs 1.81 between the open market and official rates provide a manoeuvring ground to bargain-hunters and speculative forces, which in turn have almost cornered the open market dealings. The currency market is in near-turmoil as it is hard to find dollar even at the asking prices, they added. DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS*DWS 951203 ------------------------------------------------------------------- How real are the fears of bankruptcy? ------------------------------------------------------------------- M.B Naqvi THE PAKISTANI rupee lost 38 paisa in the open market on November 22. The same day the papers told us (a) that the treasury is dishonouring government cheques and (b) the various banks were buying dollars to meet the demand from those who were trying to withdraw from their foreign currency accounts in large numbers. The State Bank had to deny that it had no cash to honour the government cheques. There were other apprehensions and the country was in the grip of rumours of imminent crisis, if not collapse, together with expectations of yet another devaluation by at least three per cent. This was despite the news that the government had, after intensive negotiations with the IMF, managed to clinch a deal for a standby credit of 600 million dollars, repayable over 15 months at higher than usual ESAF rate of interest. How high these rates are has not been disclosed. No doubt the position would remain considerably difficult but it will be manageable. The State Bank expertise in making do with shuffling of credits and liabilities with a dash of short term borrowing should see us through to the end of the second quarter of the current year when the receipt of the second tranche of the standby credit would again lead to relative stability and improved outlook. Many others, while conceding the substance of the foregoing, say that the real crisis lies elsewhere there are three areas of grave concern the first is the budgetary position. The second is balance of payments weaknesses that is truly structural. The third area of grave concern is inflation that is, in real life, shooting beyond 20 per cent, no matter what Statistics Division dishes out (14 per cent?) The budgetary position is truly difficult. Despite the Ads/news of departmental achievements, the stark reality of the tax base being much narrower than need to be can no longer be glossed over. The hiatus between revenues and expenditures is likely to grow rather than contract. The recent (October) measure devaluation, enhancement of regulatory duties, and increased POL prices is sure to cause upsets in all budgetary expectations. But as the critics have said that devaluation step would boomerang The benefit of exports would be much less than losses the economy would incur in terms of cost-push inflation and of course the increase in debt servicing charges. It is now being conceded that the maximum benefit to exports is likely to go as far as 10 per cent and that too would remain operative for about three to four months at the most. The recent rumours of further devaluation show that even this estimate of three to fours months is overly optimistic. Meanwhile the enhancement of regulatory duties and increase in POL prices have led to a wholesale increase in prices of inputs and infrastructure facilities, estimated anywhere from 20 to 30 per cent. This is the real cause of the upset in both the budgetary and balance of payments spheres. The joker in the pack, as always in our case, is inflation. The datumline was 13 per cent inflation before the October steps were taken. What would be the overall effect remains to be seen. As noted many prices have gone up by 20 percent or more as a result. Their overall impact on the indices of the wholesale prices COL and SPI is awaited. While some are alarmed, others are hopeful that the recent spurt in imports is a healthy sign because it indicates that the import of more machinery intermediates and raw materials, as well as agricultural inputs indicate that for the immediate future six months to a year the output is likely to increase. That should prevent inflation rate rising too high. But what about the period between now and the next six months or so? That remains an area of uncertainty and weakness. Should the prices tend to rise faster than the economy managers had hoped they would, the governments ability to do what it is doing trying desperately to keep the expenditures confirm to budgetary allocations would be gravely endangered as the effects of inflation are not always wholly calculable. These can, in severe cases, destabilise the society. But even in moderately high doses working classes ant government employees can suddenly become strident in demanding cost of living increases here and now, upsetting quite a few estimates. That the budgetary excesses would burst the monetary targets, leading to more inflation. Structural Weaknesses The structural weaknesses thus indicated cannot be tackled by ad hoc measures that our governments tend to take. This is not a case of slip here or there. It is far more than deviation from a given target it renders the budget unrealistic. The phenomenon is certainly covered under the rubric of the absence of work ethics and the culture of tax paying. But empty preaching is not the remedy. It is common place to talk of rich farmers not paying tax and that about Rs 200 billion is said to be the realisable potential from this class It is true enough. No less significant is the fact that the well-heeled gentry in industry and trade is not paying its taxes honestly by all estimates, urban rich folk too pay only a small part of what they ought to pay whole sections of small to medium businessmen simply pay nothing. There is the whole raging black market that pays simply nothing. How much is it is anyone's guess 40 percent? 50 per cent? or what? The fact of the matter insofar as expenditure side is concerned, is that the real motto of the successive governments has been borrow, borrow and borrow some more. The development expenditures Islamabad rulers believe, are owed us by world community. Ten policy-makers have boxed themselves in a policy orientation and a mind-set that predicates our being bailed out on foreign friends while we go on consuming far more than we produce. No matter who is responsible for it, it is now clear that this mental habit is now to be broken because those whom we thought would always bail us out are now refusing to do so. Obviously the Press cannot be told the precise details of what precisely happened in the week along negotiations that Mr V.A. Jaffarey, the Finance Adviser to the Prime Minister had conducted with the IMF. Some facts we know the old ESAF and Extended Facility arrangements have broken down and should be treated as having been cancelled a new Standby Credit with some inevitable conditionalities is likely to be approved later this month and there is a prospect that a new ESAF and EFF agreement is likely to be signed for three years beginning with 1996-97. General idea of that agreement's conditionalities can be easily guessed at old ESAF's third year's target will become those of 1996-97 and those for subsequent years can be projected. However, the precise conditionalities that Pakistan has to comply with during 1995-96 remain to be spelled out in detail probably in the shape of one or more dreaded mini-budget and perhaps a more 'realistic' adjustment police for the managed float for the national currency. Mr Jaffarey has given enough details the Fund has forced Pakistan virtually to go back to interrupted ESAF programme targets virtually in to except that it is now given a slight concession in the matter of budget deficit target. Instead of 4 per cent (of GDP) Islamabad is being permitted a deficit of the size of 4.6 per cent. Obviously a lot more pain has to be endured. Why? It also seems the IMF has overlooked the last June's 'deviation regarding not bringing down the maximum import tariffs to the desired 45 per cent in 1995 96, Pakistan will have to bring it down to 35 per cent in 1996-97. Islamabad will also have to live with a higher ($ 2.8 billion) deficit on the current account. Because we cannot balance our books, our secular deficit in the balance of payments however around $ 2.5 billion a year and it is sure to be nudged up to three billion dollars barrier. This is slightly more than the secular deficit on the external trade account, indicating other weaknesses. And this is when Pakistan economy receives development loans and other credits that range from dollars three billion to four billion from Consortium and other countries. This is now an unsustainable position. The period of free lunches has to come to an end, no matter what IMF says. Nobody owes us our development or excessive consumption. Politics underlying the Pakistan-BWI (Bretton Woods Institutions? relationship needs to be studied with greater care. It would seem the country has not been paying adequate attention to the political desires' of the donors World Bank, IMF, US, Japan European Union most others (except perhaps China). The bruising spat we have had this year with the IMF is only a beginning. More should be expected down the road.

Ziauddin ISLAMABAD, Dec. 2 The government has mounted an earnest offensive against what it believes to be rumour-mongering and disinformation campaign in the newspapers about the state of the economy. Mr. V.A. Jafarey, governor State Bank, Mohammad Yakoob, chairman Corporate Law Authority, Shamim Ahmed Khan and Waqar Masood, additional secretary economic affairs in the PM Secretariat appeared on TV together to reassure the nation that the state of Pakistan was not about to go bankrupt. Faced with a resource crunch of the most serious magnitude following an unusually bad first quarter in which the borrowing limit for the whole year (Rs.30 billion) was exceeded by at least Rs five billion to bridge the widening gap between income and expenditures, the government took a series of corrective steps in a totally non- transparent manner that gave rise to a lot of damaging market speculations. While these stories and the stories of diversion of funds from Pakistan to other markets were still circulating, the government went and sealed a foreign bank of high standing on a purely technical matter. This one single step sent a wave of panic among the general public and gave credence to the rumours that the government was about to freeze the foreign bank accounts. It was not any government official, but a newspaper which pointed out in its story on the subject that under Article 8 of the agreement Pakistan had signed with IMF, it cannot do such a thing. So, it can be seen from the above sequence of events that it were not the newspapers that had presented a distorted picture of the economy, but the picture had got distorted by various non- transparent actions of the government. The government undermined its credibility by going back to the IMF within five months of repudiating its programme and also by announcing a mini-budget within four months of the annual budget. Also its action of sealing the Emirates Bank did not do much good to its credibility.

The IMF was closely monitoring the situation in Pakistan after the recent near-collapse of the stock markets and a mini-run on the foreign exchange deposits. Experts associated with the IMF and observing the Pakistan situation do not agree with the Pakistan Government explanation that the press was to be blamed for the present situation. There have been mistakes committed by the Government and they should better admit those mistakes and try to redress them, one expert said. He listed, among others, the lack of firm public commitment by the Government to the restoration of the IMF programme, even after the signing of the standby arrangement, as one such mistake. Other harmful actions of the Government include its failure to control spending and instead reliance on non-bank borrowing like the launching of the Rs 25,000 bonds which experts think was one way of admitting that we are unable to cut our spending but we will borrow money lying under the mattresses of people which otherwise should have gone to the private sector. The statements made by the Prime Minister and some other ministers that the State Bank had unlimited capacity to print money was taken by these experts as another wrong message sent to the market where the inflation is already extremely high. What they are saying by making such statements is that inflation was not a worry and the Government was ready to print as much currency as was needed. The closure of the Emirates Bank was another blunder committed by the Government and experts think a proper message should be sent to the market by not only the Government apologising but also taking some action against those who took the decision.

The market has recovered over 100 points during the last three sessions, which means a recouping of market capitalisation of Rs 18 billion. However, it generally believed that the direction of the market will be clear after the panel set up by the Prime minister finalises it recommendations to aid the market. The recovery was largely led by bank shares, which came in for active short-covering at the lower levels, leading gainers among them being MCB, Bank al-Habib, Metropolitan Bank, Askari Bank, Crescent Bank and Bankers Equity. They were followed by leading synthetic shares, under the lead of Dewan Salman, Dhan Fibre and Pakistan Synthetics and so did cement shares, major gainers among them being Pakland Cement, Dadex, Essa Cement, and Maple Leaf Cement. A smart rally of Rs 15 in PSO led the advance in the energy sector where the current favourite Hub-Power and Shell also showed good gains amid active short-covering. Both PTC vouchers and Telecard were actively traded on news of two- conversion of the GDR for the former and so did blue chips such as Adamjee Insurance, ICI Pakistan, Brooke Bond and Siemens Pakistan in other sectors. Barring modest losses in MNCs such as Philips, Pakistan Elektron, Ciba-Geigy, Wellcome Pakistan, and some others, losses elsewhere were fractional and reflected lack of support. The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, sharply higher by Rs 2.30 on 1.745 million shares followed by Hub-Power, up Rs 1.60 on 1.728 million shares, Dhan Fibre, steady 45 paisa on 926,500 shares, Dewan salman, higher Rs 1.60 on 530,000 shares. The other actively traded shares were led by Faysal Bank, up Rs 1.05 on 440,100 shares, Ebrahim Energy, lower 25 paisa on 179,500 shares, Askari Bank(r), up Rs 4 on 162,000 shares, and PICIC, off 35 paisa on 156,000 shares. There were some other notable deals also. Trading volume totalled 11.587 million shares as compared to 12.476 million shares at the last weekend. There were 335 actives, out of which 179 shares rose, while 97 fell, with 59 shares holding on to the last levels.

The learned Commerce Minister said and the Finance Minister, who also happen to be our PM, baffled economists last week by challenging the opponents claim that the government is going bankrupt. They observed How can the government go bankrupt when we control the Security Printing Press and can print as many currency notes as we like! The government spared the operators of the capital market by not repeating its belief that the market was being manipulated by big players and in turn, the heads of the country s bourses did not mention the lack of investors confidence that stems principally from the government s inability to improve the law and order in Karachi, the country s financial capital, as the major factor in fuelling the bearish fire. Sirjuddin Cassim, the President of KSE, actually was quoted to have gone as far as to assert that law and order situation in Karachi was not the main problem plaguing KSE and that the industrial production had remained unaffected by strike calls. The stock market representatives, if they had mustered the courage, could have easily contested the government s allegation of manipulation by the logic. They could have taken up the vital question of sagging investor confidence , instead of sweeping it under the carpet. Ask any broker, investor, capital market operator, or anyone who is anybody at any of the brokerage houses local or foreign. He would almost invariably cite evaporation of investors confidence again of both local and foreign as the prime reason for the shares slump. Lack of liquidity, taking the second place. While totally ignoring one-half of the reason for the malady, the Sunday deliberations sought to address the other half Liquidity. Incontrovertibly, the steps reported to be taken would put a temporary floor under the market fall. The other recommendations by the exchanges, to which the government gave sympathetic hearing, were also admittedly in the right direction Two-way convertibility of PTC GDRs, reactivation of investor scheme by ICP, correct interpretation of prudential regulations regarding loans obtained on the shares of listed companies, investment of pension funds in stocks, enabling EOBI to invest in shares, withdrawal of tax on bonus shares and treatment of capital gains earned by insurance companies at par with other investors. Many serious analysts are skeptic they believe the 20-month slump has eroded a quarter of the market, which equals around Rs 120 billion. How much of that would the Rs one billion be able to retrieve, is a 64-million dollar question. The institutional buying may spark a short term rally, but once the funds have been saturated, nothing could prevent the bears from re-entering the rings. It is thus that the major problem of the stock market in not liquidity but sentiment. For the genuine long-term investment to be revived, the problem of sagging investors confidence has to be recognised and addressed. Economy must not only be claimed to be improving but must also be seen to be improving. And the same goes for the law and order situation in Karachi and the overall political stability in the country. Confidence needs to be created in the minds of the local investors so that they visualise the market with optimism and can invest with the long-term investment perspective, instead of the short term speculative gains in mind. The foreigner will return when they see rewards more attractive then the risks involved. It will only be then that the stock market will begin to head north. All other quick- fix solutions are not likely to work.

The KSE 100-share index showed a fresh rise of 29.82 points at 1,446.67 as compared to 1,416.85 as base shares attracted good support at the current lows. Most floor brokers believe that the near-term outlook is promising but its directions will largely be set by the recommendations of the panel set up by the Prime Minister to formulate steps to boost the ailing market. Plus signs again dominated the list as blue chips remained in strong demand. But the bulk of the buying was centred around the trend setter, PTC vouchers and Hub-Power, which together accounted for one third of the total volume on heavy covering purchases. Lever Brothers topped the list of big gainers, up Rs 48 followed by Adamjee Insurance and Dadabhoy Insurance, which rose by Rs 12 to 27 respectively. Other leading gainers were led by Telecard, Rafhan Maize, Pakistan Oilfields, and Shell Pakistan, rising by Rs 3 to 7. Bank shares rose in unison on heavy covering purchases at the lower levels, major gainers among them being Askari, Al-Towfeek, Citicorp Al-Faysal, PICIC, Crescent and Union Bank, rising by Rs 2 to 3.25. There were several other good gainers. Big losers were led by Pakistan Gum Chemicals, Frontier Sugar, which fell by Rs 7.50 followed by Universal Insurance and General Tyre. Dreamworld made debut at Rs 9 against its face value of Rs 10 and ended around Rs 7.50 but without any deal. The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, up 60 paisa on 6.115 million shares followed by Hub-Power, firm five paisa on 3.146 million shares, Dewan Salman, steady 30 paisa on 1.021 million shares, and Faysal Bank, up 35 paisa on 878,500 shares. The other actives were led by Fauji Fertiliser, higher 50 paisa on 448,700 shares followed by Dhan Fibre, unchanged on 636,000 shares, LTV Modaraba, higher 60 paisa on 398,000 shares, and PICIC, up Rs 2.85 on 336,500 shares. There were many other notable deals also. Trading volume rose to 22.251 million shares bettering its early July figure of 18 million shares thanks to heavy buying in pivotals. There were 320 actives, out of which 210 shares rose, 61 fell, with 49 holding on to the last levels.

But profit-selling did not assumed an alarming proportions as was reflected by steep decline in the turnover. Only big players rolled positions from one counter to the other to take strong technical positions. The Karachi Stock Exchange index of 100-share fell 19.01 points at 1,427.65 as compared to 1,446.66 on Tuesday, reflecting the weakness of the base shares. Selective buying emerged strong on some of the blue chips counters, lifting their prices substantially higher under the lead of PSO, which spurted by Rs 11 followed by Dadabhoy Cement, which suddenly burst into activity apparently on encouraging corporate news, rising by Rs 15 just in one go. Other prominent gainers were led by Nestle Milkpak, Karam Ceramics, EMCO Industries, Dawood Hercules, Brooke Bond, EFU, Essa Cement and Bawany Air, which rose by one rupee to Rs 2.50. Lever Brothers, which rose by Rs 48 overnight lost more than a half of the gain, falling by Rs 25 followed by Adamjee Insurance, which suffered a decline of Rs 10 on selling at the last four days persistent rise. Among the MNCs, which eased sharply Dewan Salman, Searle Pakistan, Indus Motors, and Highnoon Lab, falling by Rs 2 to 4. Bank shares fell in unison on profit-selling at the inflated levels but big losers among them were Al-Faysal, Al-Towfeek, Bank al-Habib, Bankers Equity, Citicorp, MCB, Crescent Bank and KASB & Co, falling by Rs 1.75 to 3. Other prominent losers were led by leading ICP mutual funds including 8th and 9th, Dadabhoy Insurance, Pioneer Cement, and S.G.Power. The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, unchanged on 3.190 million shares followed by PTC vouchers, easy 60 paisa on 2.584 million shares, Dewan Salman, off Rs 1.20 on 607,000 shares, and Faysal Bank, lower 40 paisa on 397,000 shares.

There were several other good deals also. Turnover figure fell to 13.278 million shares from the overnight 22.516 million shares owing to the absence of leading sellers. There were 338 actives, out of which 212 shares suffered fall, 77 rose, with 49 holding on to the last levels.

Should not the government s word, and written word at that, be its absolute bond? The National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC), fully owned by the federal government, encouraged people, Pakistanis and others, irrespective of nationality, religion, caste or creed, to deposit money with it for (as the very name suggests) national development, upon receipt of which it issued to the depositors bearer certificates of deposit promising to pay the bearer of such certificates the amount invested along with profit (interest) accrued up to the date of maturity, at the rates agreed, upon the mere surrender by the bearers to it of such certificates. Such promises made by the NDFC, on behalf of the Government of Pakistan, were honoured by it until Nawaz Sharif s government assumed power in November 1990. Since then, the NDFC has been ordered by the ministry of finance to renege on the promise it made, not to pay the sums it promised to pay but to pay them less by deducting Zakat on sums deposited with it up to five years ago. It is indeed a matter of great regret and shame that the new government has chosen to act as it has. One presumes that this action has been taken by an irresponsible underling of the ministry oblivious of the impact upon the people of the breaking of the government s solemn undertaking. If this government is to be trusted, its word must be its bond. Will the finance ministry explain its action to the people? No explanation was given. Yet again, it was established that the government s word is not its bond. Most of our finance ministers, Sartaj included, with either nothing in or on their heads, have been no different from the masters or mistresses they have served, all of whom have inevitably assumed unto themselves the powers and arrogance of the Sun King I am the State . Sunday morning, November 26, 1995 A highly nervous clued-up Gujerati stockbroker rang (each time he opens his mouth he makes me promise that I will never divulge his name in print). What s happening? The market is crashing, has already fallen by 30 points. Have you any news from Islamabad? Any heads rolled? My response You should be telling me rather than asking. We both soon found out. On Saturday evening, a stockbroker on his way home from the nearby Stock Exchange, spotted government seals on the doors of Emirates Bank and armed excise policemen guarding them. Telephones buzzed all evening and by morning the citizens were convinced their fears had materialised and the government had started freezing foreign currency accounts. What was to follow was left to experience, foresight and imagination. Naturally, the stock market crashed. There was panic selling. The government financial institutions, managed as they are, could not stem the fall as they were meant to. There were no Morgans, Rothschilds, Sekhsarias, who in days gone by stood in the ring and announced, I will buy whatever whoever is selling. There was a run on our foreign exchange reserves. Dollars were remitted or withdrawn. Dollar notes had to be flown in. The 10 per cent import duty on cash imports, so stupidly imposed in the October budget, was withdrawn. That Sunday morning, the Governor of our State Bank did not know what he should have known the night before that a foreign bank, Emirates Bank (owned by the State of Dubai and whose Board is chaired by a minister of the Ruler s Council), had been sealed by Assistant Collector of Excise Shuja-ud-din. Why? Because the bank relying upon High Court judgements, had refused to pay the excise duty the AC was attempting to extort. The helpless Governor Yaqub rang the equally ineffective Financial Adviser Vaseem Jafarey. They could do nothing. They were frozen. And then the bell clanged and a voice from Dubai boomed and announced, to all intents and purposes, I am the State. (And he was). My bank has done no wrong. My men have abided by your laws. I too can administer justice in my territory as swiftly and cleanly as can you. The message was heard loud and clear, the government apologised, the doors of the bank were immediately unsealed, and Shuja-ud-din and his extortees were told to get lost. However, within the space of that one day enormous damage had been done. Millions of our foreign currency reserves had flown. The fragility of our economy had been exposed. Feeling unsafe and exercising abundant caution, counsel for Emirates Bank, Barrister Mohammad Gilbert Naim-ur-Rahman, filed a constitutional petition in the Sindh High Court. Acting Chief Justice Abdul Hafiz Memon stayed the excise collector s hand till the next date of hearing. American Express and Citibank had earlier obtained such orders from the High Court. Monday, November 27 The run continued. Karachi stocks plunged to an all-time low. The men who rule over us sat in a cabinet and met in Lahore, whereafter Prime minister Benazir, Finance Minister Benazir, minister of State for Finance Makhdoom Shahabuddin and Financial Adviser Vaseem Jafarey left it to the least credible cabinet man, Information Kharal, to speak to the Press. His claim was that vested interests were spreading rumours to cause serious harm to the national economy in order to create panic among the people in general and potential investors in particular, with a view to shaking their confidence in Pakistan s future. But, the danger to our financial health had been warded off. Kharal feels that those who do not like or approve of him and his fellow party people would sabotage themselves to the extent of seeing their own money and savings go down the drain. Who and what is Kharal? Tuesday, November 28 The run continued. Minister of Commerce Ahmed Mukhtar who has extended his field of operation and has been recently dabbling in the field of finance collecting taxes from the textile mill owners and exempting ring spinning frames (SRO dated November 5, 1995) was invited to dinner to address the members of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Not wishing to condemn without hearing as do some others, I went to hear him. We all lost our appetites. He spoke in Punjabi-English. The people talk nonsense, said he. They say the Government of Pakistan is bankrupt, that it cannot pay its employees. Don t they know that we operate the Security Printing Press, that we can always print as much money as we want? A few million dollars may have gone out, but so what? That amount many of us can spend in a couple of evenings in Europe. Wednesday, November 29 I went to the Sindh High Court where the petition filed by Barrister Makhdoom Ali Khan on behalf of Citibank was to be heard by a Division Bench headed by Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed. The government s lawyer was not present, the hearing was adjourned to December 6, and the stay extended. Assistant Collector Shujahuddin was in court, very proud of his having made Emirates Bank lose money and of his having taught them a lesson by sealing the bank. For the lay mind, what is being adjudicated is as follows government had imposed excise duty on loans granted by banks to customers. The customers went to the High Court and obtained stay orders restraining the banks from making payment to the excise authorities. In many cases the orders clearly state that no duty be paid. However, the CBR directed the AC to collect. The banks say the court orders restrain them from making payment. AC Shuja-ud-din says he takes his orders from the CBR which has directed him that all these orders expired six months after they were issued. The banks are in a fix. If they pay, they may be prosecuted for contempt if they do not pay, AC threatens to seal them all. No one in the government bothers to resolve the issue to rein in AC Shuja-ud-din or to apply to the courts for direction. Corrupt, irresponsible officials endowed by non-credible rulers with unrestrained power easily become intoxicated by the power they wield (taqat ka nasha). Such men are as dangerous as swinging monkeys brandishing cut-throat razors. If confidence is to be restored, the government must immediately, repeat immediately, announce (and abide by its undertaking) that FIA and Excise men such as Rehman Malik and Shuja-ud-din and their squads will not enter or seal or take any action against any bank without the express written authority of the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan. No speeches or lesser measures will suffice.

But while the charge of exaggeration cannot be denied in some areas, the fact is the fundamentals of the economy are not as sound or the health of the economy as good as she or her Adviser on Finance V.A. Jafarey claims. Indisputably Pakistan has weathered many an economic storm in its chequered political and economic history, and it may be able to survive one more, but not without some more injury to the economic system and more hardships to the masses. She is also fond of stating how low was the foreign exchange reserve before she came to office again in October, 1993, or how empty was the treasury. But 1993 when we had five governments, including two care- taker set-ups, was the year of excessive political convulsions with their inevitable impact on the economy as prime ministers came and went, or were shot out. Such a year could not become a yardstick for measuring the performance of her government or her successors. Undoubtedly the economic crisis or extreme hardships which the country is facing today are not of her making entirely. Whether it is the sustained inflation, soaring national debt, worsening balance of payments, or the ever-shrinking rupee, it is the outcome of the accumulated bad policies of the past and worse official practices. But what required from her was urgent and comprehensive remedies to repair the vast damage, particularly when she continues as finance minister as well with the help of old advisers and young Turks, who are treated as economic wizards. She has now to come up with adequate, effective and visible economy measures, and cut the public spending substantially. That is what the IMF and the State Bank of Pakistan, too, have been urging the government to do reduce the large budget deficit, restrain the mounting national debt and lower the vicious inflation. This is an area where symbols are as important as the substance. And she and the President should have drastically cut down the expenditure on themselves, reduced the number of their ceremonial foreign visits, their duration and the size of their entourage which in many cases is common for both. They should have avoided more than doubling of their salaries and perquisites, and coming up with unacceptable levels of pensions for them. The government should have sent far fewer delegations abroad when their achievements are so small and their visits are too expensive. And size of the delegations should have been small and surely the new practice of sending delegates to the UN General Assembly every fortnight as if a relay race is on in New York must have been avoided. The people groaning under the impact of rising taxation and mounting inflation, who are exhorted to tighten their belts too often, should be able to see the top people, who control our purse strings, too, are making some sacrifices instead of flying off too often in special planes while PIA complains non- payment of Rs 80 million for such VVIP trips. Now can the Pakistan press be blamed for the foreign exchange reserves sinking within four months from 2,737 million dollars to 1,092 million? Can it be blamed if the public sector banks and DFIs are not able to recover more than 15 per cent of the Rs 80 billion defaulted loans after 28 months, and for the default now rising to Rs 100 billion, due to new political loans? Can the Press be blamed for the domestic debt rising to Rs 797 billion, marking a rise of Rs 93 billion last year and Rs 92 billion the year before an increase of Rs 194 billion within the two years of her government as the State Bank figures show? Along with that the foreign long and medium term debt has risen by Rs 151 billion within two years, making the total national debt Rs 1,465 billion which is a truly crushing burden for it means debt of over Rs 11,100 per capita. The stock exchange crisis is not of the making of the Press either. The index of shares of the Karachi Stock Exchange has been slipping for the last 20 months after it reached its peak of 2,661 in March last year. The reasons were political, monetary, fiscal as well as the endless Karachi killings. The government did not give serious attention to the problem. Gen. Naseerullah Babar instead blamed it on manipulators in the KSE as if share prices in the Lahore and Islamabad exchanges were doing well. And to make matters worse, a 10 per cent tax on bonus shares was imposed under the current budget even when bonus shares mean re-investment which the country desperately needs both to accelerate industrialisation and fight inflation. As a result, the KSE index sunk to 1325 or a half of the peak index on November 29 and bounced back by 100 points within three days after the PM agreed to meet presidents of the three exchanges to discuss the crisis. That shows how an earnest official action, that too at the level of the P.M. can produce results. Moving away from domestic comments on the economy to international perception, was not Pakistan s credit rating by the reputable Moods Investors Service, New York lowered in July last from BA3 to Bl? And was it not Transparency International based in Berlin which rated Pakistan in August as the third most corrupt country in the world after Indonesia and China with its new capitalist futures? The Pakistani delegate Mian Rafi who attended its conference in Manila recently said that on the basis of the quality of the complaints by foreign investors and specialists Pakistan should have been the first country, but since fewer investors had visited Pakistan compared to Indonesia and China, Pakistan came to have the third position among the corrupt. The prestigious annual report The world in 1996 published by the Economist of London, cautions declining foreign exchange reserves may soon provide less than eight weeks-worth of import cover. It says the government will remain highly unpopular and talks of army intervention in 1996. Its other publication Asia through 2000 talks of declining GDP before the end of the century 4 per cent in 1998 and 3.4 in 1999, double digit inflation until 1999, and foreign debt rising from 29.7 per cent now to 35.8 per cent by 1999. This is the kind of situation, along with dismal forecast for the near future when the population will rise to 150 million by 2000, that calls for urgent and adequate official action. Equally imperative is the closing of the gap with the people, and between the government, trade, industry and other economic groups, and a better equation between the big agriculturists and trade and industry. And it so postulates an early and effective end of the Karachi crisis and meeting the basic needs of its people instead of trying to sell them mega-development plans in which they have small faith. It is no use talking of the low foreign exchange reserves of the Nawaz Sharif period and compare that with the present as at that time total foreign exchange deposits of Pakistanis, foreigners and of foreign banks with the State Bank were not 6.5 billion dollars against which the government s reserves now is only 1.1 billion dollars. In such a situation rumours are likely to breed. The solution was for the banks to be enabled to return the dollars of small depositors as they came to get them. Delaying repayment by two or three days aggravated the rumours and promoted a mini-stampede. Meanwhile foreign banks which brought in money from abroad to save their face and help their clients were charged 10 or 11 per cent tax on the cash and that precipitated a new crisis, following the crisis caused by the closure of Emirate Bank in an excise duty dispute which exposed Pakistani banks in the Gulf to retaliatory closure. The PM has now ordered an enquiry into both. But does that not show that small men at lower levels whether in the CBR or FIA have been armed with vast powers and they are ready to misuse them? At a time when coherent and consistent official action is needed there is medley of misdeeds in sensitive areas. And look at the chaos produced by the provincial governments by not paying the dues of federal institutions, like WAPDA and PTC and the Centre withholding their financial dues or deducting the bills from them and the provinces protesting and Sindh overdrawing Rs four billion from the State Bank. Similarly it is her Federal Anti- Corruption Committee which is coming up with grave charges of vast corruption against federal institutions and autonomous bodies and feeling too frustrated as it is blocked from many quarters. Clearly the PM has to look closer home for solutions to her economic problems. And her finance officials have to brief the Press in Karachi also instead of confining it to Islamabad, and Lahore now. Better information and less scolding is what the Press needs.

If the Karachi Stock Exchange is an indicator of the state of health of the economy, then we have a terminally ill patient on our hands. However, we have been assured by that internationally acclaimed capital market analyst, General Naseerullah Babar, that the collapse of the country s equity market is due to the manipulation by a group of stock brokers. Without wishing to cast doubts on the Interior Minister s acknowledged expertise in high finance, I must confess to being puzzled as the president of the Karachi Stock Exchange has recently appealed to the Prime Minister to save the stock market from utter ruin. If the steep and unprecedented fall in share prices is indeed due to manipulation , then who is benefiting and why are stock brokers squealing for help? Actually, asinine statements apart, investor confidence is a fragile thing, based in part on economic and financial fundamentals, but mostly on perceptions of a non-monetary nature. These include non- quantifiable factors like law and order, political stability, confidence in the government s policies an"
