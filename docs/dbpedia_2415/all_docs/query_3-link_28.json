        "text": "After 45 years and more than 30 matches, Pakistan has never lost a cricket test in Karachi. And it took a huge step toward preserving that record Thursday, seizing control of the third and final match of its series against England.\n\nPakistan scored 292 runs for three wickets on the first day of five, including an unbroken partnership of 228 between Inzamam-ul-Haq, who scored 123 not out, and Yousuf Youhana, who followed 124 and 77 in the first two matches — both drawn — with 104 not out.\n\nA massive total, insuring Pakistan against defeat, is possible. The batsmen to come include perhaps Pakistan's brightest young talent, the all-rounder Abdur Razzaq, who scored his first test century — an innings of 100 runs or more — in the drawn second test at Faisalabad.\n\nA first century is a rite of passage for a young test batsman. It confirms his ability to play a long innings against international bowling and to withstand the tension of an approaching target. It wins him a permanent place in the record books — Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, the game's basic reference book, lists every test century. It further underlined the belief that Razzaq, who was 21 on Saturday, would be one of the dominant players of the first decade of the 21st century.\n\nAs yet his career statistics are unimpressive. After 11 test matches for Pakistan, he averages only 24 runs per innings with the bat. His 20 wickets as a bowler have been taken at an average of more than 39 runs each.\n\nThose numbers conceal the ability to make a decisive intervention in a match, changing its direction. His century followed innings of 87 and 72 against West Indies earlier this year.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
