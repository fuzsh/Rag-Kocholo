        "text": "Pakistan won both the Tests, leading 2-0.\n\nA total of 59 Tests have been played by these teams since 1982.\n\nPak has won 23, SL 17 and 19 have been drawn.\n\nIn Pak, 23 Tests have been played. Pak has won 9, SL 6 and 8 were drawn.\n\nIn SL, 27 have been played. Pak has won 11, SL 8 and 8 were drawn.\n\nOn neutral grounds, Pak and SL are tied with 3-3 and 3 were drawn.\n\nComing to individual performances:\n\nBatting:\n\nMost runs (1000 or more):\n\nLed by Sangakkara. Mathews and Karunaratne have the most by current players.\n\nSangakkara has the most centuries (10), followed by Younis and Aravinda with 8.\n\nSangakkara also has the most 50+ scores (22), followed by Younis with 14.\n\nHighest innings (175 or more):\n\nA lot of high scoring here, starting with Younis’s triple century.\n\nIn this series the highest scores were 208* by Saud Shakeel and 201 by Abdullah Shafique. They surpassed the record for Pak in SL by M Hafeez (196).\n\nBatting average (Min 20 innings, 45.00):\n\nHeaded by Sangakkara with Inzamam far behind coming next. Mathews has the best by current players.\n\nBatting strike rate (Min 1000 balls faced, 50.00):\n\nLed by Sarfraz Ahmed followed by Dilshan. Babar Azam is also there from recent times.\n\nBowling:\n\nMost wickets (25 or more):\n\nLed by Herath followed by Murali. Saeed Ajmal has the most for Pakistan. Strangely, P Jayasuriya has the most by current players.\n\nBest innings bowling (6wi or better):\n\nLed by Herath and Imran. Noman’s 7-70 is the best in recent years. It is the best for Pak in SL, surpassing Yasir Shah’s 7-76 in 2022.\n\nBest match bowling (including all 9wm or better):\n\nHeaded by Herath and Imran. No major performances in this series, though there was R Mendis’s 9-for in 2022.\n\nBest bowling averages (Minimum 2000 balls, maximum 35.00):\n\nHeaded by the two Ws, with W Akram at No 1.\n\nThe most economical bowling was by Wasim Akram and Abdur Rehman.\n\nThe best strike rates were by the two Ws again, with Waqar Younis at no 1 this time.\n\nTo be continued.\n\nIt seems unlikely that there will be any bilateral series between India and Pakistan for quite some time. It has already been decided that India will not play Pakistan in the group stages of the World Test Championship.\n\nSo this seems to be a good time to look back at the records of ODIs between India and Pakistan (not just in the World Cup).\n\nOf a total of 132 ODIs between the sides, India has won 55, Pakistan 73, no ties and No Result 4.\n\nIn India: 30 matches; Ind 11, Pak 19.\n\nIn Pakistan: 27 matches; Ind 11, Pak 14, NR 2.\n\nIn Neutral venues: 75 matches; Ind 33, Pak 40, NR 2.\n\nLooking at individual figures:\n\nBatting:\n\n500 or more runs:\n\nHeaded by the older players who had more opportunities to play these matches. Among current players there is Shoaib Malik (1782) and MS Dhoni (1231).\n\nThe most centuries are 5 by Tendulkar, followed by 4 by several others.\n\nThe most 50+ scores are also led by Tendulkar with 21. Next is 16 by Inzamam and Dravid.\n\nHighest innings: 110 and more:\n\nSaeed Anwar’s 194 was a record in all ODIs for several years. The highest score in recent years is RG Sharma’s 140 in the current World Cup.\n\nHighest Averages (Minimum 20 innings, 30.00 and above):\n\nA number of current players such as Kohli are not here as they have not played 20 innings. Dhoni and Shoaib Malik have the highest averages among current players.\n\nHighest Strike Rates (Minimum 500 balls faced, 80.00 and above):\n\nShahid Afridi and Sehwag lead as one would expect. Kohli, Dhoni and RG Sharma have the highest strike rates among current players.\n\nTo be continued:\n\nThere have only been 15 1-wicket victories, and none between 1923 and 1951 and then between 1951 and 1980.\n\nHere is a list of all 1-wicket and 2-wicket victories as on 16 Aug 2021:\n\n1) The first instance was in the Eng v Aus Test starting at the Oval on 11/08/1902, when England won.\n\nThe last wicket partnership was of 15 runs from 248/9 to 263/9 by GH Hirst (58) and W Rhodes (6). The story goes that they planned to get the runs in singles, but they did not have to do this.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n2) SA v Eng at Johannesburg starting on 02/01/1906, won by SA. Partnership of 48 from 239 to 287 by AW Nourse (93) and captain/keeper PW Sherwell (22).\n\n3) Aus v Eng at Melbourne starting on 01/01/1908, won by Eng. Partnership of 39 from 243 to 282 by SF Barnes (38) and A Fielder (18).\n\n4) SA v Eng at Cape Town starting on 01/01/1923, won by Eng. Partnership of 5 from 168 to 173 by AS Kennedy (11) and GG Macaulay (1).\n\n5) Aus v WI at Melbourne starting on 31/12/1951, won by Aus. Partnership of 38 from 222 to 260 by DT Ring (32) and WA Johnston (7).\n\n6) NZ v WI at Dunedin starting on 08/02/1980, won by NZ. Partnership of 4 from 100 to 104 by GB Troup (7) and SL Boock (2).\n\n7) Pak v Aus at Karachi starting on 28/09/1994, won by Pak. Partnership of 57 from 258 to 315 by Inzamam-ul-Haq (58) and Mushtaq Ahmed (20).\n\n8) WI v Aus at Bridgetown starting on 26/03/1999, won by WI. Partnership of 9 from 302 to 311 by BC Lara (153) and CA Walsh (0).\n\n9) WI v Pak at St John’s starting on 25/05/2000, won by WI. Partnership of 19 from 197 to 216 by JC Adams (48) and CA Walsh (4).\n\n10) Pak v BD at Multan starting on 03/09/2003, won by Pak. Partnership of 5 from 257 to 262 by Inzamam-ul-Haq (138) and Yasir Ali (1).\n\n11) SL v SA at Colombo (PSS) starting on 04/08/2006, won by SL. Partnership of 2 from 350 to 352 by MF Mahroof (29) and SL Malinga (1).\n\n12) Ind v Aus at Mohali starting on 01/10/2010, won by Ind. Partnership of 11 from 205 to 216 by VVS Laxman (73) and PP Ojha (5).\n\n13) SA v SL at Durban starting on 13/02/2019, won by SL. Partnership of 78 from 226 to 304 by MDKJ Perera (153) and MVT Fernando (6).\n\n14) Eng v Aus at Leeds starting on 22/08/2019, won by Eng. Partnership of 76 from 286 to 362 by BA Stokes (135) and MJ Leach (1).\n\n15) WI v Pak at Kingston starting on 12/08/2021, won by WI. Partnership of 17 between Roach (30) and Seales (2). Seales had earlier taken his first five-for.\n\nScorecards of the first match in 1902 and the last match in 2021 are here and here.\n\nWe now look at the 17 Tests which ended in a two-wicket victory.\n\nOne of them was actually an one-wicket victory as one batsman had retired hurt and probably would not have batted. This was at Dunedin where NZ had pulled off an improbable win in 1980 (see No 6 above).\n\nThe 1985 match was NZ v Pak at Dunedin starting on 09/02/1985, won by NZ. The 9th wicket partnership (effectively the last wicket) put on 50 from 228/8 to 278/8 by JV Coney (111) and EJ Chatfield (21). Earlier BL Cairns (0) had retired hurt at 217/7 and the 8th wicket fell at 228.\n\nComing back to the list of 14 1-wicket victories:\n\nThe Feb 2019 match saw the highest winning 10th wicket partnership of 78 in Tests as well as in all first-class cricket. The previous Test record was 57 by Pakistan in 1994.\n\nLater in Aug 2019 we had the second highest winning 10th wicket partnership of 76.\n\nThe highest scores in these partnership were 153 by Lara as well as Perera, followed by Inzaman’s 138 and Stokes’s 135.\n\nThe lowest scores by the no 11 batsman include 0 by Walsh in 1999, 1 by Leach in 2019 and several other single-figure scores. Walsh did slightly better in 2000 scoring 4.\n\nLeach made his single run only towards the end of the partnership, which ensured the match would at least be tied when England’s score reached 358.\n\nThe highest score by a No 11 in these matches was 22 by Sherwell in 1906.\n\nYasir Ali was playing in his only Test.\n\nInzamam and Walsh are the only ones to appear twice in these partnerships.\n\nThe highest total here is 362 by England in 2019, and the lowest 104 by NZ in 1980.\n\nThat was an eventful match which saw DL Haynes scoring 55 and 105, being the only opener in all Tests to be last out in both innings. It ultimately led to New Zealand winning a series against West Indies. This was the first time they had won any Test series at home. They had earlier won only against Pakistan in Pakistan in 1969-70.\n\nThe August 2019 win by England also involved one of the lowest first-innings totals by a winning side (and the lowest such total since 1887):"
