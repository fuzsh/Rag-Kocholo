        "text": "All-rounder Imad Wasim has criticized the mindset of the current Pakistan cricket team. He believes their fear of failure is why they struggle against top teams and is one of the reasons for their exit from the T20 World Cup.\n\nThe 35-year-old came out of retirement for the T20 World Cup 2024 but wasn't able to make much of an impact. Pakistan lost to co-hosts USA in Super Over and then suffered a six-run defeat against arch-rivals India. Their hopes of making it Super 8 were quashed as the match between USA and Ireland was washed out.\n\nGet the latest sports betting odds on ICC T20 World Cup 2024 here!\n\nImad responded to criticism from former players, stating that while it is necessary, it should never be personal. He highlighted the importance of analyzing cricket without attacking individual players.\n\n\"When I was on TV as an analyst, I always spoke about cricket. I never did body-shaming or made personal comments,\" he told reporters ahead of the final group match against Ireland. \"I've always maintained that we should never get personal and rather talk about cricket and how it should be played.\"\n\nPakistan's player-turned-pundits have been scathing in their attack against the current team and questioned selection of players like Azam Khan, who is far from peak fitness.\n\nImad also faced severe criticism for his batting approach in the match against India, with Saleem Malik accusing him of scoring slowly to make sure his average remains high. He scored 15 runs from 23 balls as Pakistan failed to chase down a target of 120.\n\n\"I was 100% passed fit by the medical panel after which I played. I've always played cricket with a fighting spirit,\" he added.\n\n\"Yes, I'm responsible for failing to execute so you can talk about that, but please don't talk about other matters. We also have families and people that care for us and support us. It's hurtful to hear some of the things (that have been said).\"\n\n'We used to rule T20 cricket' - Imad Wasim laments\n\nAccording to him, the current Pakistan is talented enough but needs to adopt a fearless approach in all aspects of the game - batting, bowling, and fielding.\n\n\"We compete with the world's best teams. Their mindset has changed over time. We used to rule in T20 cricket,\" he said.\n\nMore: 'PCB needs to course-correct' - Inzamam-ul-Haq fears Pakistan cricket will go the hockey way\n\n\"I think we have moved back a little now. Maybe our mindset [needs a change] - in all three areas. I won't say any one area. If you change the mind of the player, you can achieve things beyond your limits.\n\n\"I always believe in this. You can talk a lot, but it is what it is - today, we are out of the tournament and whatever happens in the next World Cup, whoever plays, however they play, I think if we go with the right approach, the results will be better for us.\"\n\nWhat next for Pakistan cricket team?\n\nPakistan will play their final T20 World Cup group match against Ireland on Sunday, June 16.\n\nThis is the second World Cup in a row, after the 2023 ODI World Cup, that the team has failed to progress to the next stage."
