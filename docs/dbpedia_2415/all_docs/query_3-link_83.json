        "text": "Wrong.\n\nThis was the first post of the thread, but due to manee's bad moderating skills, my post ended up on top.\n\nThe topic is CRICKETER. not BATSMAN.\n\nThis is where Inzamam comes up on top :happy\n\nIdiot! If you go by 'cricketer', then ODI cricket is included (which you say cant be counted since you know you cant fight on that).\n\nSachin is a better fielder, cant compare on bowling as Inzamam has rarely bowled in intl. cricket, Sachin is a better person on the field (sportsmanship, controversies, etc), cant compare them on running between wickets AS INZAMAM IS THE PROBABLY THE WORLD'S WORST RUNNER, etc.\n\nWhere does Inzamam win here on the cricketer count?\n\nsaisrini80 added 3 Minutes and 30 Seconds later...\n\nTell me saisrini, has Sachin taken India to a victory as many times as Inzamam?\n\nSachin is nowhere near Inzamam in that aspect.\n\nPolls also said Harsha Bhogle is the most unbiased commentator. Is that true? Nope.\n\nDid you even read my post about Sachin giving a batsman out above? Seriously, that is not how a professional cricketer of any sort acts.\n\nAnd please don't get me started on his cheating.\n\nI have never heard Harsha that much, so I am not getting into that.\n\nWe have discussed this many times. Inzamam doesnt face as much pressure as Tendulkar faces (Tendulkar faces pressure even in situations where on cricketing terms, its easy). Inzamam might have taken Pakistan to victory more times than Tendulkar, but that DOESNT MAKE HIM A BETTER CRICKETER THAN SACHIN RAMESH TENDULKAR.....\n\nOn his cheating, go ahead and ask people who follow cricket and who have followed Tendulkar to say that he cheated a lot in his cricketing life. See what they say! We dont care what one person (IE. YOU!) feels abt his cheating. We go by what the majority think.\n\nImagine if both players swapped teams. How would they perform in different teams? I know we can't say for sure but I reckon Sachin would struggle for Pakistan regularly as his proneness to \"choking\" would be a huge hinderance to his performance. Pakistanis usually put themselves into poor positions only for a hero to save them!\n\nInzi however, wouldn't perform much different then he would playing for Pakistan. Therefore, I believe both players were extremely good batsmen. Sachin was allowed more freedom due to slightly better team members batting wise, whereas Inzi had little support from his peers. Even if Inzi did come in not under any pressure, he wouldn't bat FAR better than when under pressure.\n\nTherefore, we can safely say Inzi was a superior pressure player and Sachin a better batsmen when both were'nt under any pressure. Then comes the argument that Inzi didn't have to face the kings of reverse swing, Wasim and Waqar!\n\nYou guys seem to be too heavy on your heads about Pakistan cricket. As if Wasim and Waqar were the only best bowlers in international cricket.\n\nNo batsman in Pakistan history has had to face the kind of pressure that Sachin faced from the fans, the crowd and the audience alike. Had he played for Pakistan, his career record would have been much better (the 'took his team to victory' would also have been far better).\n\nsaisrini80 added 1 Minutes and 10 Seconds later...\n\nHe'd face them in the nets\n\nBesides, Tendulkar wouldn't have to face Anil Kumble in a game..\n\nor Javagal Srinath.\n\nOh, you seem to be increasing the value of Srinath and Kumble just to show that Sachin benefitted from not facing them.\n\nYou guys seem to be too heavy on your heads about Pakistan cricket.

Just saying that they were the two best swingers and certainly Wasim was one of the best international bowlers, STANDARD. I'm tryying to say that Inzi benefitted slightly from not facing that pair. Why do you have twist everything I say to make it sound like the crap you speak?\n\nIts funny when an Indian trys to tell others they have their heads too far up their own arses..."
