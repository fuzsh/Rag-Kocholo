        "text": "Over the years One day cricket has evolved, and it has survived through different phases and changes. From neat whites to eye catching color kits, from bright sun light to flood lights, from red to white the authorities has toiled hard to make One Day Cricket grow and make it as interesting for the spectators as they possibly could. But evolution phase has been much faster in the last two decades than ever before. With the change of rulings like fielding restrictions, power plays, flatter pitches and now the use of two new balls and leverage of bowling bouncers, ICC over the years has tried their best to use one day cricket as a source to promote the game further.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt in the fact that ODI cricket is the format for the viewers. With the introduction of T20 cricket and increased popularity of this shortest format of the game, players and boards are more inclined to focus on ODI cricket. There is no one denying the fact that Test cricket remains ultimate TEST of a cricketer, but when we talk about the fan following and viewership, Test cricket stands no chance in comparison to the shorter versions of the game. As a fan of cricket, who does not want to see sixes being hit, fielders diving around to save every possible run, wickets fall down in a hurry and you are sure to get a result in 8 hours time (or even in 4 hours for T20s). Accordingly, the players have changed their methodology to the game. No more would you see players taking their time to settle into a game, there is no time for the old saying; ‘adjusting to the condition’.\n\nODI cricket is considered to be batsmen’s game and nowadays the phrase has changed to ODI cricket is considered to be aggressive batsmen’s game. Then there are views of spectators and viewers; to them ODI is not for slow and sluggish batsmen. To them, hit it or get out should be the order of the day. No more they want to see batters gutting it out to survive, assess matters and play according to the demand of the game. Come on guys, its cricket not baseball. As a fan and follower of cricket I sometimes find it very harsh when batters are criticized for their low strike rates in ODIs, completely ignoring the value of these cricketers in a team’s mold. One such batsman of our era is Misbah-ul-Haq. Although the name can’t be compared with the greats of the game, but his importance to Pakistani team is invaluable.\n\nRenowned, in amongst the Pakistani fans, by the name of “Tuk Tuk” (presumably due to his defense style of batting), Misbah has been under the pump ever since he started his ODI career in 2002. After the retirement of former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq in 2007 Misbah managed to cement his place in a lineup that was full of stroke makers and crowd pleasures. Now at the age of 39 things are far from comfortable for the current leader of the team. Whether it is for his captaincy or his style of batting, Misbah is in the firing range of most experts and fans.\n\nSo how bad is he really to deserve all this? Take a look at his stats first. Since making his debut (in ODIs) in 2002 against Black caps at Gaddafi Stadium Lahore, Misbah has scored 3255 runs in 113 ODIs at a staggering average of over 42. But who nowadays focus on average??? So, his strike rate is 75. It may be of no interest to the viewers but the fact is Misbah-ul-Haq tops the list for highest batting average in the history of Pakistan cricket (Qualification 3000 runs or more). Let’s make a comparison between greats of Pakistan cricket and Misbah to simplify the matters for ourselves. While I believe stats alone can’t really describe the class of a player but stats don really lie. Comparison is restricted to Pakistan Cricket only. To me you can’t really compare batters for different teams statistically simply because of the different conditions and different lineups in which the players play and that can really enhance or diminish their bating records.\n\nSo who are the best Pakistani middle order batsmen in the last say 20 years? Three names comes to my mind for consistency and performance over a long period of time, Inzamam-Ul-Haq, Muhammad Yousaf and Younus Khan. In ODIs middle order position is really critical. To be helpful for your team, you have to play according to the game scenarios. Sometimes when the chips are down you have to bite your way, cut your instinct, neglect shouts of the fans and try to move the game forward. Then in the final period you have to try and get as many as you possibly can. But the most important task for a batter in cricket in to control the game. While people can argue that Afridi controls the game in his own way, real meaning of controlling the game in to know when to attack and when to defend. It means how to be ahead of the game even though if it looks like that your run rate is low. To me Misbah-ul-Haq is an expert in that, in fact, all the Pakistani greats I have mentioned are. It’s like these players have in built calculator that calculates the moves they have to make to win the game.\n\nPlayers Matches (ODI) Runs Average Strike Rate Inzamam 378 11739 39.52 74.24 Muhammad Yousaf 288 9720 41.71 75.10 Younus Khan 252 6985 31.89 75.52 Misbah 113 3255 42.27 75\n\nIf anybody can name a better middle order batsman to have played for Pakistan in the last 15 years I would be very interested to know.\n\nThe real greatness in a player is his ability to win the games for his team. Comparing the stats of all the players in the world we will find out that top players play well when their team wins but the real statement is Team wins when their top players play well. Let’s have a quick glance on stats of these four in matches that their team has won.\n\nPlayers Matches (ODI) Runs Average Strike Rate Inzamam 214 7402 51.04 79 Muhammad Yousaf 160 6265 56.44 78.36 Younus Khan 144 4728 40.06 82 Misbah 72 2193 54.82 77.10\n\nMisbah average jumps up to 88.36 in successful chases for Pakistan. That is second only to Dhoni’s average of 98 in the same scenario (qualification 1000 runs or more).\n\nKeeping in view the stats alone I think it is clear that Misbah-ul-Haq is one of the finest batters Pakistan has produced. As I said earlier stats alone can’t stress the greatness of a player. Misbah’s usefulness to Pakistan cricket is beyond the comparison of stats. He provides our middle order with this calm influence that is so very important for eager players like we have in our lineup. He holds up an end to take the game where players like Afridi, Akmals and Malik can slog their way to popularity. In short he does the donkey work to support his team and just like any other profession there is no admiration for donkey work.\n\nNext is the issue of his captaincy. While I am willing to believe that he is not one of the finest captain in the history of the game but the fact is he hasn’t done the worst job in the world in Odis. Pakistan team has played 38 matches under his captaincy winning 23 losing 14 and 1 washed out game. This gives him the winning percentage of 61% which is not that bad considering the circumstances under which he became the captain of the national side and the need for team to play away from home all the times.\n\nWhatever way you look at it the statistical fact remain that Misbah-ul-Haq is the best ODIs player in Pakistan and is also the best choice to lead the country."
