Amir has taken only 5 wickets at an average of 92. That's both home and away. He is by FAR the worst bowler in the world. The next worst is Mark Wood. He averages 47 with the ball. That's nearly twice as good as Amir.\n\nM.Husnain is only 18/19 years old, is over 6'3 in height and has been recorded at bowling 152 kmh. Even Shoaib Akhter was not that fast at that age. 152 kmh from a 6'3 fast bowler could be more than deadly in English conditions.\n\nThere are no other openers in Pakistan that are better than Iman.\n\nIn the past 2 years since the CT final, M.

He took the wickets of some of the top Australian Batsmen. His average was wayyyy better than Amir too. Bowled with more pace, bounce, swing and accuracy. M.Amir's average is closing in on 100, for the past 2 years. Why is that going to change now?\n\nMohammed Husnain is the future. M.Amir is finished. He himself no longer wants to play for Pakistan. Which is why he has applied for British citizenship, wants to settle in the UK and play full time County Cricket.\n\nThere are no other openers in Pakistan that are better than Iman.\n\nIn the past 2 years since the CT final, M.

We need someone with good record in England and not kid like husnain.amir mostly played in uae dust like pitch.you can't compare amir with husnain.terrible decision by inzamam.\n\nSo why did other bowlers perform better than him on dust pitches? Amir is finished. What happened 2 years ago is irrelevant now. An average of 92 for 2 years means you are done as a bowler.\n\nAmir is not wasim Akram who can swing ball in dust.i hope he will come back otherwise we all regret.there are lots of players who doesn't deserve entry in wc19 if we consider past record.it is useless to talk about past record because uae isn't even our home.the ground in uae should be renamed as ground of dust lol."
