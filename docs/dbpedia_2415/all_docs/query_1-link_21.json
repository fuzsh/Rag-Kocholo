Hussey is yet to even play 50 tests.\n\nSo this equation is suggest that Each players have their different role in the team.You can't compare two players on these basis from different team because they play in different venues against different teams.Though it does give rough ideas but you can't prove your whole point on one stats,and If you do then Start praising Sangakara from now.\n\nTendulkar and Inzamam both batted at 4, and sometimes at 5. You are CLUTCHING at straws. This has nothing to do with Sangakkara, who is a great and very underrated batsman\n\nGrow up guys,there is no logic in comparison of any player with Sachin.Because firstly He is playing his cricket from 16 years of age and sometime you get more troubles when you carry more responsibilities.\n\nActually it still doesn't make any difference to me,I accepted Inzi > Sachin even by formula which Zmario has given Sangakara > Sachin.\n\nIt won't bother me until Sachin drives his Ferrari.\n\nIT DOES NOT MATTER. He played 2 tests, 3 tests at 16. What does that have to do with this? Seriously, YOU ARE MAKING EXCUSES.\n\nEdit:these formula is more useful when you comparing two players from one team who played in same venues against same team.\n\nStill this is Valid but you are just trying to climb moon with this small ladder,nothing else.\n\nNo, its useful, because it shows that Sachin isn't as much of a match-winner at India. But thank you for conceding defeat\n\nReplies in bold.\n\nzMario added 1 Minutes and 15 Seconds later...\n\nBoth Inzi and Sachin play according to the situation of the game, Tendulkar is an opener or top order batsman but Inzi was a middle order batsman. May be thats the reason why he averages less than Sachin\n\nbut guys Don't you think Inzi could have been better than the best if he got some workouts?\n\nSachin batted at 4 for most of his test career... same as Inzamam\n\nInzy opened in 1 test I think, and prehaps Sachin did a couple as well\n\nAnd I think vaiby is sad that I've completely destroyed \"his God\"\n\nSachin has batted at #4 in 198 innings. He has opened once, batted at #5 in 21 innings, and batted at #6 in 19 innings.\n\nSo basically Sachin and Inzamam shared the same type of role - the #4 and #5 position\n\nAlso vaiby, I didn't use a formula. I used the last 50 tests, which is when Sachin and Inzamam are / were in their prime.\n\nAll the stats I have used:\n\nALL TESTS:\n\nInzamam averages 78.16 in games Pakistan have won.\n\nSachin averages 62.11 in games India have won.\n\nSachin isn't a match-winner.\n\nWhen Inzamam scores a 100, there is a 68% chance Pakistan win - or 17 out of 25.\n\nzMario said:\n\n==================================\n\nIndia vs England, Mumbai, March 22, 2006\n\nIndia have to bat out two complete sessions on the final day to draw\n\nthe match and win the series. The score is 75/3, with the most\n\nover-hyped batsman of our generation not out at 34. Predictably, as he\n\nhas done throughout his test career, he gets out. India lose the match\n\nand the series.\n\nPakistan vs England, Lord's, July 17, 2006\n\nPakistan have to bat out one and a half sessions on the final day to\n\ndraw the match. Inzamam arrives at the crease with the scoreboard\n\nreading 116/3. One and a half sessions later, he is still not out at\n\n56. As he has done many times in his career, he has saved a test match\n\nfor his country.\n\n__________________________________________________ __\n\nTendulkar\n\nPronounced: Ten-dul-kar\n\nDefinition: The act of failing a team when your team needs you most and\n\npadding one's statistics with high scores in meaningless matches.\n\nSachin's test match average vs Pakistan before Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis retired = 32.91.\n\nSachin's Career Test Average vs Pakistan: 42.28\n\nSachin's been filling his boots facing the likes of Sami, Rana Naveed, and Mohammad Khalil!\n\nzMario said:\n\nI've also decided to filter only Inzamam and Sachin's last 50 test matches, as this is probably when these 2 were and are at their best.\n\nSachin Tendulkar in his last 50 Tests: averages 47.36.\n\nInzamam-ul-Haq in his last 50 Test Matches: 54.36.\n\nA difference of 7.\n\nShall we explore that further?\n\nInzamam's average in games Pakistan have won in his last 50 Test matches is a BRILLIANT 86.03.\n\nCan you fight that?\n\nSachin's average is 57.88 in his last 50 tests that India have won\n\nPlease show me where I have played around with the stats to get what I want. I can extend that to 100 tests possibly as well, although that would be a less accurate interpretation of the batsmen when they were at their best."
