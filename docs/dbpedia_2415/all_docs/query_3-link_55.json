        "text": "This page uses Creative Commons Licensed content from Wikipedia (view authors).\n\nThe Pakistan cricket team (پاک کرکٹ), nicknamed as Green Shirts, is the national cricket team of Pakistan. Represented by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), the team is a full member of the International Cricket Council, and participates in Test, ODI and t20s cricket matches. Currently Pakistan is ranked number four as per the ICC Test rankings.[1] Pakistan have played 777 ODIs, winning 417, losing 337, tying 6 and with 17 ending in no-result.[2] Pakistan were the 1992 World Cup champions, and also came runners-up in the 1999 tournament and are the current Asian Champions. Pakistan, in conjunction with other countries on the Subcontinent, have hosted the 1987 & 1996, with the 1996 final being hosted at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. The team has also played 63 Twenty20 Internationals, the most of any team, winning 38, losing 23 and tying 2.[3] Pakistan won the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and came runners-up in the inaugural tournament in 2007.\n\nPakistan have played 370 Test matches, with winning 115, losing 101 and drawing 154. The team has the 3rd-best win/loss ratio in Test cricket of 1.13, and the 5th-best overall win percentage of 31.33%.[4] Pakistan was given Test status on 28 July 1952, following a recommendation by India, and made its Test debut against India at Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi, in October 1952, with India winning by an innings and 70 runs.[5] Previously, Pakistani cricketers had competed as a part of the British Indian national team before independence of Pakistan in 1947.\n\nHistory[]\n\nMain article: History of the Pakistani cricket team\n\nSee also: Cricket in Pakistan, History of cricket in Pakistan from 1947 to 1970, History of cricket in Pakistan from 1971 to 1985, History of cricket in Pakistan from 1986 to 2000, and History of cricket in Pakistan from 2001\n\nFollowing the independence of Pakistan in 1947, cricket in the country developed steadily and Pakistan was given Test match status at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference at Lord's Cricket Ground in England on 28 July 1952 following recommendation by India,[6] which, being the successor state of the British Raj, did not have to go through such a process. The first captain of the Pakistan national cricket team was Abdul Kardar.\n\nPakistan's first Test match was played in Delhi in October 1952 as part of a five Test series which India won 2–1. Pakistan made their first tour of England in 1954 and drew the series 1–1 after a memorable victory at The Oval in which fast bowler Fazal Mahmood took 12 wickets. Pakistan's first home Test match was in Dacca in January 1955 against India, after which four more Test matches were played in Bahawalpur, Lahore, Peshawar and Karachi (all five matches in the series were drawn, the first such occurrence in test history[7]).\n\nThe team is considered a strong but unpredictable team. Traditionally Pakistani cricket has been filled with players of great talent but limited discipline, making them a team which could play inspirational cricket one day and then perform less than ordinarily another day. Over the years, competitions between India and Pakistan have always been emotionally charged and provide for intriguing contests, as talented teams and players from both sides of the border elevate their game to new levels to produce high-quality cricket. Pakistani contest with India in the Cricket World Cup have seen packed stadiums and elevated atmospheres no matter where the World Cup has been held.\n\n1986 Austral-Asia Cup[]\n\nMain article: Austral-Asia Cup\n\nThe 1986 Austral-Asia Cup, played in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, is remembered as a famous last-ball victory for Pakistan against arch-rivals India, with Javed Miandad emerging as a national hero.[8] India batted first and set a target of 245 runs, leaving Pakistan with a required run rate of 4.92 runs per over. Javed Miandad came in to bat at number 3 and Pakistan lost wickets at regular intervals. Later recalling the match, Miandad stated that his main focus was to lose with dignity. With 31 runs needed in the last three overs, Miandad hit a string of boundaries while batting with his team's lower order, until four runs were required from the last delivery of the match. Miandad received a leg side full toss from Chetan Sharma, which he hit for six over the midwicket boundary.[8][9]\n\n1992 Cricket World Cup[]\n\nMain article: 1992 Cricket World Cup\n\nAt the 1992 World Cup Semi Final, having won the toss, New Zealand chose to bat first and ended with a total of 262 runs. Pakistan batted conservatively yet lost wickets at regular intervals. With the departure of Imran Khan and Saleem Malik shortly thereafter, Pakistan still required 115 runs at a rate of 7.67 runs per over with veteran Javed Miandad being the only known batsman remaining at the crease. A young Inzamam-ul-Haq, who had just turned 22 and was not a well-known player at the time, burst onto the international stage with a match-winning 60 off 37 balls. Once Inzamam got out, Pakistan required 36 runs from 30 balls, which wicketkeeper Moin Khan ended with a towering six over long off, followed by the winning boundary to midwicket. The match is seen as the emergence of Inzamam onto the international stage.[10][11][12]\n\nThe 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand marked Pakistan's first World Cup victory. It is remembered for the comeback Pakistan made after losing key players such as Waqar Younis and Saeed Anwar and being led by an injured captain in Imran Khan. Pakistan lost 3 of their first 5 matches and were nearly eliminated in the first round of the tournament after being bowled out for 74 runs against England, until the match was declared as a \"no result\" due to rain. Imran Khan famously told the team to play as \"cornered tigers\", after which Pakistan won five successive matches, including, most famously, the semi-final against hosts New Zealand and the final against England.[13]\n\n2007 Cricket World Cup[]\n\nThe 2007 Cricket World Cup was one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history when Pakistan was knocked out of the competition in a shock defeat to Ireland, who were playing in their first competition. Pakistan, needing to win to qualify for the next stage after losing to the West Indies in their opening match, were put into bat by Ireland. They lost wickets regularly and only 4 batsmen scored double figures. In the end they were bowled out by the Irish for 132 runs. The Irish went on to win the match, after Niall O'Brien scored 72 runs. This meant that Pakistan had been knocked out during the first round for the second consecutive World Cup.[14][15][16] Tragedy struck the team when coach Bob Woolmer died one day later on 18 March 2007 in a hospital in Kingston, Jamaica. Jamaican police spokesman, Karl Angell, reported on 23 March 2007 that, \"Mr Woolmer's death was due to asphyxiation as a result of manual strangulation\" and that, \"Mr Woolmer's death is now being treated by the Jamaica police as a case of murder.\"[17] Assistant coach Mushtaq Ahmed acted as temporary coach for the team's final group game of the tournament.[18] Subsequent to his team's defeat and the death of Woolmer, Inzamam-ul-Haq announced his resignation as captain of the team and his retirement from one-day cricket, stating that he would continue to take part in Test cricket but not as captain.[19] Shoaib Malik was announced as his successor.[20] Following his return to the squad, Salman Butt was appointed as vice-captain until December 2007.[21]\n\nOn 23 March 2007, Pakistan players and officials were questioned by Jamaican police and submitted DNA samples along with fingerprints, as part of the routine enquiries in the investigation into Woolmer's murder.[22] Three days after leaving the West Indies for Pakistan, via London, the Pakistan team were ruled out as suspects. The deputy commissioner of Jamaican police. Mark Shields, the detective in charge of the investigation, announced, \"It's fair to say they are now being treated as witnesses.\" \"I have got no evidence to suggest it was anybody in the squad.\"[23] A memorial service was held in Sacred Heart Church, Lahore, for Bob Woolmer on 1 April 2007. Among the attendees were Pakistan players and dignitaries, including Inzamam-ul-Haq, who was quoted as saying, \"After Woolmer's family, the Pakistan team was the most aggrieved by his death.\"[24] After the World Cup ended, serious doubts were raised about the investigation, with increasing speculation that Woolmer died of natural causes. This has now been accepted as fact, and the case has been closed.[25]\n\nOn 20 April 2007, a PCB official announced that former Test cricketer Talat Ali would act as interim coach, in addition to his role as team manager, until a new coach had been appointed.[26] On 16 July 2007, Geoff Lawson, previously head coach of New South Wales, was appointed coach of the Pakistan for two years, becoming the third foreigner to take on the role.[27] In the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, Pakistan exceeded expectations to reach the final but ended as runners-up, after losing the final to India in a nail-biting finish. On 25 October 2008, Intikhab Alam was named as a national coach of the team by the PCB.\n\n2009 ICC World T20[]\n\nOn 21 June 2009 Pakistan won the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, beating Sri Lanka in the final by eight wickets. Pakistan had begun the tournament slowly losing two of their first three matches but after dismissing New Zealand for 99 runs in the Super 8 stage they had a run of four consecutive wins including beating previously unbeaten South Africa, in the semi-final and Sri Lanka.\n\n2011 Cricket World Cup[]\n\nPakistan started well in the ICC Cricket World Cup, which was held in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, after beating Kenya, Sri Lanka(one of the tournament favourites) and narrowly beating Canada. After a huge loss against New Zealand, Pakistan defeated Zimbabwe by 7 wickets.'. One of the highlights of the tournament for Pakistan was when they beat Australia, who were led by 3 brilliant pace bowlers, Brett Lee, Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson. However Pakistan defied the odds and defeated Australia, courtesy of a brilliant bowling display. In the Quarter-Finals they played West Indies. Pakistan were ruthless, as they emphatically beat the West Indies by 10 wickets, due to another brilliant bowling display. In the Semi-Finals on 30 March, Pakistan had a match with its fiercest rival, India. India, due to Tendulkar who was dropped several times, managed 260 after they batted first. Due to a slow chase, Pakistan were 29 runs short as India reached the final (India went on to win the final). Pakistan have never defeated India in an ODI World Cup match to date, losing in all 5 matches contested between the two sides.\n\n2012 ICC World T20 Cricket[]\n\nOn 11 July 2012, Pakistan announced a provisional 30-man squad for the World Twenty20 starting in Sri Lanka on 18 September.[28] The 30-member provisional squad will be pruned to 15 next month. While naming the probables, the selectors refrained from announcing the captain. Mohammad Hafeez, who led Pakistan in their T20I series in Sri Lanka last month, is widely expected to retain his place, especially after the retirement from the T20 game of Misbah-ul-Haq, the Test and one-day captain.\n\nGoverning body[]\n\nMain article: Pakistan Cricket Board\n\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is responsible for all first class and Test cricket played in Pakistan and by the Pakistan cricket team. It was admitted to the International Cricket Council in July 1953. The corporation has been run by former cricketers, professional administrators and trustees, who are often respected businessmen. The Board governs a network of teams sponsored by corporations and banks, city associations and clubs including advertising, broadcasting rights and internet partners.[29]\n\nThe PCB's experiment with the Twenty20 cricket model has also proven popular and hopes to similarly revive popular interest in domestic games, which it did. The PCB also set up major domestic competitions such as the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy and the Faysal Bank T20 Cup.[30]\n\nTournament history[]\n\nWorld Cup World Twenty20 Champions Trophy Asia Cup Austral-Asia Cup Asian Test Championship Commonwealth Games\n\n1975: First Round\n\n1979: Semi Finals\n\n1983: Semi Finals\n\n1987: Semi Finals\n\n1992: Champions\n\n1996: Quarter Finals\n\n1999: Runners Up\n\n2003: First round\n\n2007: First round\n\n2011: Semi Finals\n\n2007: Runners Up\n\n2009: Champions\n\n2010: Semi Finals\n\n1998: Quarter Finals\n\n2000: Semi Finals\n\n2002: First round\n\n2004: Semi Finals\n\n2006: First round\n\n2009: Semi Finals\n\n1984: Third Place\n\n1986: Runners Up\n\n1988: Third Place\n\n1990–91: Did not participate\n\n1995: Third Place\n\n1997: Third Place\n\n2000: Champions\n\n2004: Third Place\n\n2008: Third Place\n\n2010: Third Place\n\n2012: Champions\n\n1986: Champions\n\n1990: Champions\n\n1994: Champions\n\n1998–99: Champions\n\n2001–02: Runners Up\n\n1998: First Round\n\nList of International grounds[]\n\nSee also: List of cricket grounds in Pakistan\n\nStadium City Test matches ODI matches Gaddafi Stadium Lahore 39 57 National Cricket Stadium Karachi 41 46 Iqbal Stadium Faisalabad 24 16 Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium Rawalpindi 8 21 Arbab Niaz Stadium Peshawar 6 15 Multan Cricket Stadium Multan 5 7 Niaz Stadium Hyderabad 5 7 Jinnah Stadium (Gujranwala) Gujranwala 4 9 Bagh-e-Jinnah Lahore 3 0 Sheikhupura Stadium Sheikhupura 2 2 Jinnah Stadium Sialkot 1 11 Ibn-e-Qasim Bagh Stadium Multan 1 6 Pindi Club Ground Rawalpindi 1 2 Defence Housing Authority Stadium Karachi 1 0 Bahawal Stadium Bahawalpur 1 0 Zafar Ali Stadium Sahiwal 0 2 Ayub National Stadium Quetta 0 2 Sargodha Stadium Sargodha 0 1 Bugti Stadium Quetta 0 1 Zahoor Elahi Stadium Gujrat 0 0\n\nPakistan women's cricket team[]\n\nMain article: Pakistan national women's cricket team\n\nThe Pakistan women's cricket team has a much lower profile than the men's team. For all national women's cricket teams, the female players are paid much less their male counterparts and the women's teams do not receive as much popular support or recognition as the men's team. The women's teams also have a less packed schedule compared to men's teams and play fewer matches. The team played it first match during 1997, when it was on tour of New Zealand and Australia and were invited to the World Cup later that year and in the Women's Asia Cup during 2005 the team came third place. During 2007, the team with face South Africa and later in the year travel to Ireland to play in the Women's World Cup Qualifier. The team also played at the T20 England World Cup, the team finished 6th place, beating Sri Lanka and South Africa in 2009.\n\nTeam Colours[]\n\nIn Test matches, the team wears cricket whites, with an optional sweater or sweater-vest with a green and gold V-neck for use in cold weather. The team's official sponsor's have been Pepsi since the 1990s with their logo displayed on the right side of the chest and sleeve with the Pakistan Cricket star deployed on the left in test cricket. Boom Boom Cricket signed a deal with Pakistan Cricket Board in April 2010 to become the kit sponsors of the Pakistan team, the deal ended on the end of 2012 Asia cup.[31]\n\nPakistan's One Day and Twenty 20 kits vary from year to year with the team wearing its famous green color in various shades from kit to kit. For official ICC Tournament's 'Pakistan' is written on the front of the jersey in place of the sponsor logo, with the sponsor logo being placed on the sleeve. However for non ICC tournaments and matches the 'Pepsi' logo feature prominently on the front of the shirt. As always the Pakistan logo is placed on the left chest. An example of the different shades of green Pakistan wears from kit to kit can be seen in the example of the 2010–11 kit which was in the famous lime green color.[32][33] However for the World Cup a new jersey with a dark green to light green fade was introduced in February 2011.[34] The Kit For The World Cup Become Popular Around The World For Its New Design. Minor changes were made to the kit after the World Cup, 'Pakistan' across the shirt was replaced with the 'Pepsi' logo, whilst the World Cup logo was replaced by the 'Boom Boom' but the jersey did not look like as same as the cwc jersey even after only some small changes. logo.[35][36] T\n\nLogo[]\n\nPakistan's Cricket Team's Logo is a star, usually in the color Gold or Green, with the word \"Pakistan\" (پاکِستان) written inside in Urdu, Pakistan's national language.\n\nPersonnel[]\n\nCurrent squad[]\n\nThis is a list of all the players with there forms of cricket in which they play.\n\nKey"
