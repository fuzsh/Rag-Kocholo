Australia isn't the only team that plays cricket. Inzi was a mixed bag against quality pace.\n\nInzi was great against WI throughout the '90s as well. Australia isn't the only team that plays cricket. Inzi was a mixed bag against quality pace.\n\nWhat does Aus have to do with Inzimam's performences against WI?\n\nWhat does Aus have to do with Inzimam's performences against WI?\n\nThe myth being peddled here is that Inzi was no good against good attacks based solely on how he did in Australia when he was gun against WI with Ambrose and Walsh and a pre injury Bishop too.\n\nI voted KP but Inzy at his best just seemed like nothing could go past him. He was not flashy and he definitely underachieved a bit overall but esp in the noughties, sometimes bowling to him felt so impossible.\n\nI just feel KP had more impact innings. I may vote Younis Khan ahead of KP though.\n\nThis is revisionism. Inzi was great against Ambrose and Walsh in WI. Nobody handled them with such disdain. He had a bad series against McGrath once. McGrath barely played in '05 if we're nitpicking. No Asian batsman except Tendulkar and Kohli has done well in SA.\n\nThat is true about Inzy being good against 90s WI. It’s where his aura against pace is backed up.\n\nKP barely got a mention in the CW top 50 batsmen of all time so assumed he would get trounced here but he’s been competitive so far. Could win yet!\n\nInzi also greatly benefitted from the batting era.\n\nPietersen’s 8 and a half year career came exclusively in a batting era and mostly in a strong team. That is particularly fortuitous. Inzy had a fortunate second half of his career but at least played the first half in the 90s. I also feel that Inzy’s home conditions might be seen as a factor in Pietersen’s favour but KP’s away record isn’t great.\n\nI voted KP but Inzy at his best just seemed like nothing could go past him. He was not flashy and he definitely underachieved a bit overall but esp in the noughties, sometimes bowling to him felt so impossible.\n\nI just feel KP had more impact innings. I may vote Younis Khan ahead of KP though.\n\nThat's pretty straight forward I think\n\nYounis would beat KP in a poll here quite comfortably. Pietersen would possibly win if you conducted a worldwide public survey but cricket nerds tend to rate Younis higher out of the two. And before Trundler starts, so do I.\n\nHe hardly played against SA and Australia at home and he was fine when he did. KP benefits greatly from test spam and playing all his tests in a 7 year period. His average flatters him quite a bit imo. Played some great knocks but lots of dross in between too.\n\nSo you are saying AUS tour of Pak in 94, 98, UAE /SL ( neutral ) in 2002 , SA tour to Pak in 97, 04 , 07 didn't happen. That is atleast 15 test imo.\n\nSo you are saying AUS tour of Pak in 94, 98, UAE /SL ( neutral ) in 2002 , SA tour to Pak in 97, 04 , 07 didn't happen.

He had his struggles but it's weird not to mention his record against WI when talking about quality pace, which almost didn't exist in KP's era.\n\nOn careful analysis I have changed my vote to Inzy . Although Pietersen was much better against McGrath/ Steyn , he didn't average 50 even in 1 non- minnow country overseas ( I consider WI a poor side since retirement of Lara)\n\nWhereas Inzy averaged 50 in 4 non- Minnow country ( Sl , IND, WI before Lara's retirement, NZ).\n\nI thought Pietersen must be averaging atleast 50 in SA, NZ , AUS .\n\nHe played like 8 tests against those sides at home.

Doesn’t look tight enough and his risk and reward methods won’t produce the goods as consistently as the most prolific players. Had very good career circumstances and averaged 47. Wasn’t a home bully but his record isn’t great too. Definitely a legend and ATVG with a ton of great knocks but think Inzy is slightly ahead.\n\nKP was my childhood hero but there has always been a theory amongst his biggest fans that he could have averaged 55 if he wanted to and I just don’t buy it personally.
