        "text": "Really? Jadeja over Ashwin? Say it ain't so...\n\nI recently swapped, despite not being a fan of Jadeja's batting. Think he is the slightly more valuable player in Asia because that's where his batting really is all-rounder level, and their bowling is very close there as Jadeja's left arm angle is completely lethal on turning wickets. Ashwin is definitely the better bowler outside Asia but on resume the gap isn't big enough considering Jadeja's better batting and slightly better overall value in Asia. There's a reason they play Jadeja in SENA.\n\nI recently swapped, despite not being a fan of Jadeja's batting.

Jadeja has improved a lot the last couple of years.\n\nI voted Inzamam anyway. For all his problems on fast pitches he did a fair bit more overseas than Jadeja; and while Jadeja is indispensable in Asia, Inzy will still win me some games there.\n\nThink both are slightly overrated but Jadeja has managed an inflated bowling average and a very inflated batting average. Nobody thinks he's a sub-25 bowler but the fat in his batting returns go under the radar. Think he's Pollock level at best and with probably a more linked range. Has hardly anything worth talking about outside Asia.\n\nThink both are slightly overrated but Jadeja has managed an inflated bowling average and a very inflated batting average.

Has hardly anything worth talking about outside Asia.\n\nHe’s averaging 40-50 or something in a very difficult batting era. Yes almost all of it is at 6-7 but that’s mighty impressive. He’s coming in at 150/5 or something silly like that, far too often.\n\nHe’s been key in some extremely vital partnerships, both in and out of Asia\n\nHe’s averaging 40-50 or something in a very difficult batting era.

He missed a lot of highly bowler-friendly tests in SA, England, and the home series against England. RPI on the wrong side of 30. Average of 20 in low-scoring tests. Very decent bat but think his average flatters him a fair bit.\n\nHmmm. He missed a lot of highly bowler-friendly tests in SA, England, and the home series against England.

Very decent bat but think his average flatters him a fair bit.\n\nhe didnt miss a lot of tests in England by any measure once the team realised he was good enough as an all rounder, see reason 1 for the lack of South African tests and he was injured for the last South African series where Ashwin struggled to replicate what he could have offered and that England series\n\nHmmm. He missed a lot of highly bowler-friendly tests in SA, England, and the home series against England. RPI on the wrong side of 30. Average of 20 in low-scoring tests. Very decent bat but think his average flatters him a fair bit.\n\nHe's pretty much only faced high quality attacks and has scored runs just about everywhere he has gone in an era of pretty sporty wickets. His numbers might take a bit of a ding if he had played every away test (whether or not those games were low scoring, due to being better at home), but he is still averaging in the Imran/Miller range away.\n\nShould have a poll between Jadeja and Pollock to find the most grotesquely overrated player on here.\n\nJadeja overrated on cw? He is laughed off in most discussions/comparisons as htb and grotesquely underrated here rather than overrated.\n\nHe's pretty much only faced high quality attacks and has scored runs just about everywhere he has gone in an era of pretty sporty wickets.

Imran and Kapil both better too. I think he's a similar level bat to Shaun Pollock.\n\nAshwin is the better bowler but I think Jadeja is better overall too. Maybe PC should make a thread for that.\n\n\"PC gone mad\" should be the thread title\n\nHe isn't even close to Miller as a batter. Imran and Kapil both better too. I think he's a similar level bat to Shaun Pollock.\n\nI was comparing away averages, not the players on the whole.\n\nI don't think he that far below miller in terms of performances, despite the big talent gap.\n\nPretty decent chance he overtakes Imran, and should beat the rest."
