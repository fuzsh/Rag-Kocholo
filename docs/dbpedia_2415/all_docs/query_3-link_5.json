        "text": "He did score almost 12k runs, and an average just below 40, so he was an excellent ODI player. His running between the wickets hurt him in the shorter form of the game, but he was still an excellent calming influence in the middle order. I'd put him around 5-10 in terms of all time ODI players.\n\nSaeed Anwar is a bit of a different story, because though his record was good, I still would take a couple others over him. In Tests, he was a good opener (especially compared to other openers that Pakistan and India have had since), but in ODIs I prefer Ganguly and Jayasurya above Anwar.\n\nIn Tests, he was clearly the best out of the three. Overall, Inzamam was better in both Tests and ODIs IMO.\n\nInzamam-ul-Haq was one of the best middle-order ODI batsmen of the modern era.\n\nAble to play in just about any way demanded by any situation, he scored runs at a far better rate and quantity than most ever managed.\n\nHad Tendulkar batted in the middle-order more often I think he'd probably have outdone him, but as it is I can't think of too many better middle-order batsmen since 1990. Neil Fairbrother and 1 or 2 others come close, of course.\n\nThis is, obviously, discounting Michael Bevan who was head-and-shoulders above everyone else.\n\nYou ARE joking, aren't you?\n\nGanguly maybe, but Jayasuriya? SRs pretty similar, Anwar's average was a good 5 points higher than Jayasuriya's.\n\nOh, hang on, I forget... ss and ODIs don't mix.\n\nYea, you wouldn't be wrong if you just ignore everything I say about ODIs. I have no defense for Jayasurya > Anwar in ODI, just who I think is better. Also, five points of average doesn't exactly mean all that much, depending on other factors. Look at Lara vs Dravid.\n\nDravid and Lara is an interesting one IMO - and there's not a hell of a lot to decide them. Lara often wins out on that absurd \"the more dominant player must be the better\" thing I've mentioned a few times.\n\nAnyhoo - no, 5 points on average doesn't automatically mean everything, but if you break it down you'll see there are broad truths that apply to both. Anwar was probably a better defensive player, mind.\n\nbut in ODIs I prefer Ganguly and Jayasurya above Anwar.IMO.\n\nJayasuria is an excellent one day player, maybe he is past his now. But he can open the batting, take advantage of the power plays and go on to make hundreds. Just look at this world cup. He is second in the list of most ODI 100's. Plus he has taken nearly 400 ODI wickets. He is the ULTIMATE ODI player.\n\nIf there was one batsman who was totally unconcerned about the reputaion of the bowler he was facing it was Inzy. In fact the better the bowler the better he batted.\n\nIf there was one batsman who was totally unfazed (and looked it) by the dire condition of his team in the match, it was Inzy. He seemed to thrive in crisis situation.\n\nIf there was one batsman who could judge the game situation and go about as if he knew exactly what was required (including the most effortless changing of gears ever) it was Inzy.\n\nIf there was one batsman who never ever looked anything less than effortlessly imperial at the wicket it was Inzy.\n\nNo, I have no doubt whatsoever that he was one of the finest (and relatively most under-rated) one day batsman ever. The only blot was his runningt between the wickets. That too not because he was slow but because he couldnt be rushed with a bat in hand.\n\nI think Inzamam is one of the ten best ODI batsmen ever personally. I don't have a dead-set top ten, but he'd be in there with Sachin Tendulkar, Viv Richards, Michael Bevan, Mark Waugh, Dean Jones, Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, Saeed Anwar etc. Terrific batsman Inzamam... I hope he isn't forgotten because although Mohammad Yousuf may pass him, I don't think Pakistan has had a better batsman in either form of the game (with the exception of maybe Miandad in Tests).\n\nIf there was one batsman who was totally unconcerned about the reputaion of the bowler he was facing it was Inzy. In fact the better the bowler the better he batted.\n\nI don't entirely agree with that. Inzamam struggled against Warne in ODI's a lot IIRC. Warne has gotten him many times and if I recall Inzi looked a bit tentative an uncertain how to play him.\n\nOne thing against Inzy is the accusation that he doesn't perform in big tournaments, an article before the WC highlighted Inzy's terrible record in tournaments and finals which is something that should be taken into consideration when rating him imo, especialy as players like Lara and Hayden have to deal with it anytime their name is mentioned.\n\nNonsense, that, IMO. Pakistan's most recent WC barely got going, so that counts for virtually nothing; and obviously he was poor in WC2003, which, purely and simply, can happen. But there was little wrong with his play in 3 out of 4 WCs, his first 3 being acceptible enough.\n\nIf there was one batsman who was totally unconcerned about the reputaion of the bowler he was facing it was Inzy. In fact the better the bowler the better he batted.\n\nIf there was one batsman who was totally unfazed (and looked it) by the dire condition of his team in the match, it was Inzy. He seemed to thrive in crisis situation.\n\nIf there was one batsman who could judge the game situation and go about as if he knew exactly what was required (including the most effortless changing of gears ever) it was Inzy.\n\nIf there was one batsman who never ever looked anything less than effortlessly imperial at the wicket it was Inzy.\n\nNo, I have no doubt whatsoever that he was one of the finest (and relatively most under-rated) one day batsman ever. The only blot was his runningt between the wickets. That too not because he was slow but because he couldnt be rushed with a bat in hand.\n\nDitto.\n\nTo compare him to Richards and Jones (not to mention Zaheer Abbas) is utterly fruitless IMO.\n\nIt'd be like comparing WG to Barrington.\n\nI wasn't comparing them, rather just saying they'd be in my top ten. As it is, Viv would be number #2 on my list of all time best ODI batsmen (and a contender for #1). Jones... I don't know where he'd rank... but he wasn't as great as Viv.\n\nI wouldn't put them in the same top anything. The game Richards and Jones played was different to the one modern players have played. TBH, Jones did more than anyone to change into what it is today.\n\nI'd never, ever put either in a top 10 with modern ODI players - only in one including players of their day."
