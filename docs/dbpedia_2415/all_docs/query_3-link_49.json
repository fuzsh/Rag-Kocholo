        "text": "Synopsis\n\nT20 World Cup: India's captain Rohit Sharma dismissed former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq's ball-tampering claims after India’s 24-run win over Australia in the T20 World Cup Super 8s. Sharma attributed the reverse swing to natural conditions and emphasized staying calm and simple for their semifinal against England. Arshdeep Singh's key wickets were crucial in India's victory, setting up the semifinal clash.\n\nIndia's captain Rohit Sharma has dismissed allegations made by former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq that the Indian team tampered with the ball to achieve reverse swing during their T20 World Cup Super 8s match against Australia. India emerged victorious against the 2021 T20 World Cup champions Australia by 24 runs in Gros Islet, setting the stage for a semifinal clash against England. Arshdeep Singh's impressive performance, taking three crucial wickets, played a key role in halting Australia's pursuit of the 205-run target.\n\nWhen questioned about Inzamam's comments in a pre-match media interaction, the 37-year-old Sharma brushed off the claims, suggesting that Inzamam should be more open-minded. Sharma explained that the hot sun and dry wicket naturally cause the ball to reverse swing, a phenomenon observed across all teams, not just India. He emphasized that the match conditions were unique and different from those in England or Australia.\n\n\"Sometimes, dimaag kholna jaruree hai,\" 37-year-old Rohit Sharma said in his typical Mumbai style.\n\nWhat Inzamam-ul-Haq had claimed\n\nIn a conversation with a Pakistani news channel, Inzamam accused Arshdeep and the Indian team of ball-tampering, which supposedly allowed the pacer to generate reverse swing in his second spell. Inzamam argued that it was too early for the ball to reverse swing by the 15th over unless it had been tampered with. He called for umpires to be more vigilant.\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\n\"Umpires should keep their eyes open\": Inzamam makes bizarre ball-tampering allegations against Arshdeep Singh\n\nIn the match, India set a target of 205 and managed to restrict Australia to 181/7. At one point, Australia needed 81 runs from eight overs with eight wickets remaining, but they faltered during Arshdeep's second spell, where he took key wickets in the 16th and 18th overs.\n\nInzamam further contended that if Pakistani bowlers had achieved similar reverse swing, it would have caused significant controversy. He asserted that Pakistani bowlers are adept at reverse swing, and if Arshdeep managed it in the 15th over, it indicated deliberate work on the ball. He noted that while it might be expected from a bowler like Bumrah due to his unique action, achieving reverse swing with a specific action or speed suggests the ball had been specially prepared.\n\nRohit Sharma's message for teammates\n\nIndia's captain Rohit Sharma emphasized the importance of staying calm and keeping things simple ahead of their T20 World Cup semifinal against England. Reflecting on past struggles with the fear of failure, Sharma noted that the team aims to treat the semifinal as just another game and maintain a positive, relaxed mindset. He stressed that overthinking in high-pressure situations can be detrimental.\n\nIndia seeks to avenge their 10-wicket loss to England in the 2022 semifinal at Adelaide Oval. Sharma, acknowledging both fear of failure and bad luck as factors in past defeats, expressed confidence in his team’s ability to perform well. He highlighted the importance of playing smart cricket, making good decisions, and maintaining role clarity.\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\n\"Play freely, dont think too much...\": Rohit Sharma's message to India for T20 WC semi-final against England\n\nRohit Sharma shatters 10 records in a single innings against Australia.
