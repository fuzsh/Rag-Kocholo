        "text": "It’s not Mumbai, where the ball doesn’t get higher than the stumps. It’s going to be hard to play here,” thundered Dale Steyn on 7 December in Durban, South Africa, after bowling one of the most hostile One Day International (ODI) spells in the first ODI match (5 December) of the current series against India.\n\nSteyn may just have been playing mind games before the Test series but he was not off the mark either. South Africa remains the final frontier where India have never won a series and not surprisingly, this is one country where Indian batsmen have not been able to dominate a bowling attack for too long. Many of them have done exceptionally well in Australia (Sachin Tendulkar and V.V.S. Laxman) or England (Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid), but none have averaged above 50 in South Africa.\n\n“It’s a combination of factors. More than the well-directed short-pitched stuff, what has worked mostly is the follow-up deliveries. Seam movement and swing has caused more problems than just flat out and out pace,” explains Lance Klusener, the former South African pacer from Durban.\n\nThere seems to be a pattern of batting average dropping significantly in South Africa among India’s modern batting greats. If Mohammad Azharuddin scored at an average of 23.33 in contrast to his overall average of 45.03, Virender Sehwag didn’t do any better at 25.46, in contrast to his overall average of 49.34. Dravid, who carved out a special reputation because of his exceptional away record, had just one great series in 1996-97, which was incidentally his first tour of South Africa. After that, he could score only a half-century in his next 16 innings. A batting average of below 30 (29.71) in South Africa doesn’t do justice to his overall average of 52.31.\n\nThe performance of Dravid’s former teammates like Ganguly (who scored at an average of 36.14 in comparison to his overall average of 42.17) and Laxman (who scored at an average of 40.42 in contrast to his overall average of 45.97) didn’t drop alarmingly but both of them never managed to score a Test hundred in South Africa. Their combined total of 34 innings in South Africa yielded just eight 50s.\n\n“Pitches in South Africa have a balloon bounce. Apart from that, they always have fantastic players at the backward point like Jonty Rhodes, Herschelle Gibbs and A.B. de Villiers. When pace bowlers are bowling just short of length, the only option for you is to play with soft hands and take a single. And, if the single doesn’t come (because of superb fielders), it becomes easier for pacers to put pressure on a batsman,” says W.V. Raman, a former batsman who was part of the team when India toured South Africa for the first time in 1992.\n\nOf course, Tendulkar being Tendulkar is always an exception, but he too got runs at an average of 46.44 while his career average is 53.78. “In 2010, he got two 100s against a quality attack comprising Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel. Sachin’s record improved vastly with those knocks,” Shaun Pollock said last year, speaking to this writer for a book.\n\n“In our country, bounce is steeper than Australia. Also, it nips around a lot. Not only the Indians, but the players from the subcontinent, play 85% of Test matches on decent tracks, so they find (conditions) here a little more challenging,” says Klusener, who played 49 Test matches for the Proteas and is currently coach of the domestic Dolphins team.\n\nKlusener is partly right. Most subcontinental batsmen tend to struggle in South Africa, even modern greats like Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene from Sri Lanka and Inzamam-ul-Haq from Pakistan. Sangakkara’s career average (56.98) takes a massive beating in South Africa (16 innings at an average of 35.75 without a ton), as does his friend and teammate Jayawardene’s (16 innings at an average of 27.87 without a ton) average of 49.56. Arguably Pakistan’s greatest batsman, Inzamam-ul-Haq, too has an almost identical record in South Africa (15 innings at an average of 31.78 without a ton, with a career average of 49.60).\n\n“In Australia, the challenge is extra bounce but the ball doesn’t move that much. In England, it swings a lot and moves around but doesn’t have the same speed or bounce off the pitch. In South Africa, it’s a combination of both which makes batting extremely challenging. Batsmen suddenly have to cover the high bounce along with seam and swing. In a layman’s words, it’s the combo challenge of Australia and England,” says former India opener Aakash Chopra.\n\nIndia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka together have just five wins in 37 Test matches in South Africa, and largely due to the sustained below-par performance of their batsmen.\n\nHowever, calling it a typical subcontinental predicament perhaps won’t be a fair assessment. If you dig deep enough, then it can be safely argued that South Africa is indeed the toughest place for all visiting batsmen. Even West Indies’ Brian Lara and Australia’s Ricky Ponting have failed to average 50-plus in the rainbow nation. The only exception is England’s Andrew Strauss, who has an enviable 50-plus average in South Africa since the latter’s readmission to Test cricket in 1992—17 innings, 826 runs at an average of 51.62 with three 100s.\n\nFormer India coach Madan Lal says tours of South Africa have been the hardest for the Indian team in the last two decades, and it makes him think of the terror of the West Indies tours in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n“You can say that the challenge of playing fast bowling in South Africa is almost similar to what we used to face in West Indies. But we used to have longer tours and lots of practice matches in between. Even the side games against regional teams of Barbados and Jamaica used to have many quality pacers. Even if we lost those practice matches, it used to give us enough practice in getting acclimatized,” says Lal.\n\nThe substandard shows by the Indian batsmen in South Africa over the years also have a lot to do with the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI)’s casual approach while finalizing the tour schedule. That the current tour has been shortened to a two-Test series and just one practice game (that was washed out) is likely to only compound the problems for the visitors. Last time, India didn’t have any first-class games before the Test series and were blown away by South African pacers in Centurion in the first Test match of the series. As the series progressed, India improved and not only won the second Test but were on the verge of an unlikely Test series victory on African soil.\n\n“Every tour will have its own challenges but South Africa continues to have a great supply of fast bowlers. Perhaps Indian teams don’t have too many good or competitive first-class games before a Test series. Other than that you are tested a lot in terms of patience in South Africa. Actually, it’s a combination of many factors,” adds Raman, currently coach of the Tamil Nadu Ranji trophy team.\n\nLal says that as a tour goes on, batting becomes less intimidating. In 1996-97, India were humiliated in the first Test in Durban inside three days but rose to the challenge in the second Test. Lal was the coach of that team, which came very close to a win in Johannesburg in the third and last Test of the series.\n\nOver the years, South Africa have also prepared tracks which are heavily loaded in favour of pacers—they knew India didn’t have a quality pace attack. New Zealand did the same in 2002-03, when Test matches used to finish inside three days. Things changed with the emergence of India’s new pace attack. But it’s only if India consistently possess a fine pace attack that the hosts would be wary of preparing a track that is not fair, and that will make life a little easier for the batsmen.\n\nSo, is there anyone from the visiting team who can reverse the trend ?\n\n“I think Indian captain M.S. Dhoni can change the trend in the current series. He has had a good ODI series and he is very gutsy. He is someone who can play attacking shots and dominate. Although most of the touring batsmen are very talented, it is going to be an acid test for all of them,” says Klusener.\n\nLal and Chopra believe Virat Kohli has the ability to dominate.\n\n“If Virat comes at 60 or 70 for 2, then he will be a different batsman. But if he is forced to face the new ball early in his innings, as Tendulkar had to on countless occasions in South Africa, then it will be very tough for him,” says Chopra. Lal thinks that more than form and confidence, Kohli’s attitude will be a decisive factor. “There are a lot of talented batsmen in this side who can reverse the trend but Virat is our best bet. He is courageous and shows a lot of guts.”\n\nOf course, Johannesburg and Durban are not like Mumbai or Delhi but if India’s new generation of batsmen are able to pass the acid test, Steyn will be forced to eat his words. Else, it will be the same old story for Indian batsmen in South Africa.\n\nVimal Kumar is the author of Sachin: Cricketer of the Century."
