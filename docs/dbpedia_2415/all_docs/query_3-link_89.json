        "text": "Bridgetown, Barbados: Brian Lara was looking for a birthday gift in the shape of a series-levelling victory against India in the third Test from Thursday.\n\nLara, the scorer of 18 Test hundreds - and the world-record 375 - celebrated his 33rd birthday on the opening day.\n\nHe said he was still not fully recovered from an elbow injury sustained last December, but remained committed to the West Indian cause.\n\n\"There is nothing that I would love more than a hundred this week, but I am not fully there yet,\" Lara said.\n\n\"I am now getting gradually back into the game - I am looking to peak soon.\"\n\nIndia, without a series win outside the subcontinent since 1986, lead the five-Test series 1-0 going in to the clash at Kensington Oval, where they have lost six times in seven matches.\n\nMeanwhile, New Zealand all-rounder Dion Nash announced his retirement from international cricket yesterday.\n\nThe 30-year-old, who has been plagued by a hip injury since last year, said he was undecided on whether he will continue playing domestic matches.\n\nNash played 32 Tests, taking 93 wickets at an average of 28.48 and scoring 729 runs at 23.51.\n\nHe also played 81 one-day internationals, taking 64 wickets and scoring 624 runs.\n\nHighest Test scores\n\n375 - B.C. Lara, West Indies v England, St John's 1993-94\n\n365* - G.S. Sobers, West Indies v Pakistan, Kingston, 1957-58\n\n364 - L Hutton, England v Australia, The Oval, 1938\n\n340 - S.T.
