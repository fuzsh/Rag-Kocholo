Here is some evidence to dispel that bullshit, unless I am reading your reading of \"man-of-the-match\" incorrectly.\n\nMan-of-the-Match Tables\n\nOn this page, Sachin has 10 of these awards as of July 18, 2006. Inzamam does not figure on the list.\n\nI will do some Cricinfo research for you, as well, since you seem bent on spewing bullcrap:\n\nvs England (in Manchester, 1990)\n\nvs England (in Chennai, 1993)\n\nvs New Zealand (in Chennai, 1996)\n\nvs Australia (in Chennai, 1998)\n\nvs Pakistan (in Chennai, 1999)\n\nvs New Zealand (in Ahmedabad, 1999)\n\nvs Australia (in Melbourne, 1999)\n\nvs South Africa (in Mumbai, 2000)\n\nvs Zimbabwe (in Kolkata, 2002)\n\nvs Australia (in Sydney, 2004)\n\nvs Australia (in Adelaide, 2008)\n\nSo really, I cannot see where you are getting 2 from?

Really, if you look at the table I posted above you will see that Sachin is in the list of top players with Man of the Matches (by a mile in ODIs, btw). Saying that drawn matches don't count is bullshit. Bowlers win Test matches, not batsmen.

You CANNOT WIN A TEST MATCH IF YOU DON'T TAKE 20 WICKETS.\n\nAs a result, the measure of man of the matches in games won to determine how good a batsman is, in short, pure tripe.\n\nAre you mentally retarded? You go on statsguru, and find all the matches Sachin has got a Man of the Match in?\n\nAnd then you read the qualifications.\n\nFirst of all, the man of the match shows the player who performed the best in a game. The man of the match award for YOU is tripe because Sir Tendulkar only got TWO in his test career in WINS (and not including Bangladesh or Zimbabwe)\n\nThe man of the match shows who was the match-winner in that game. The fact Tendulkar only has two MoMs since 1998 shows that.\n\nAnd heres the statsguru page that shows that. http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru...=1;template=results;type=allround;view=awards\n\nTendulkar is on the THIRD page.\n\nOut of 38 wins Tendulkar has played in, he has only contributed heavily in two.\n\nAnd you call him a team player?\n\nSachin is on the second page\n\nzMario added 1 Minutes and 30 Seconds later...\n\nLets see how Sachin and Inzi have faired aginst 3 of the post potent pace attacks in the world cricket in their backyard.\n\nSachin's Series Average Against Australia in Australia:\n\nhttp://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru...n=2;template=results;type=batting;view=series\n\nInzamam's Series Average Against Australia in Australia:\n\nhttp://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru...n=2;template=results;type=batting;view=series\n\nSachin's Series Avereage Against SA in SA:\n\nhttp://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru...n=3;template=results;type=batting;view=series\n\nInzamam's Series Average Against SA in SA:\n\nhttp://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru...n=3;template=results;type=batting;view=series=series\n\nSachin's Series Average Against England in England:\n\nhttp://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru...n=1;template=results;type=batting;view=series\n\nInzamam's Series Average Against England in England:\n\nhttp://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru...n=1;template=results;type=batting;view=series\n\nThis tells the whole story about who is better.\n\nTendulkar is a CHOKER.\n\nHe cannot handle chasing pressure situations as much as Inzamam. And you know it.\n\nBut since you're so onto Inzamam, get his averages in India (where according to manee has better pitches than Pakistan), New Zealand, West Indies.\n\nI will reply to your post in a moment Pranav.\n\nzMario added 3 Minutes and 58 Seconds later...\n\nYou know Tendulkar is better than Inzamam and the the statistics also show that.We are comparing batsmen according to their over all stats.\n\nFirst, you limited this conversation to only Test matches.\n\nNow, when you are still losing, you say when has he scored in pressure situations.\n\nUsing this way, I can prove many batsmen are better than Sachin.\n\nfor example: I can say that Masakadza (from Zimbave) is better than Tendulkar as he scored a century in his Test debut but Sachin didn't.\n\nIf you better talk about the overall situation & not \"pressure\" or \"tests\" etc. etc. you'll get only one answer. Sachin is a better batsman than Inzimam.\n\nI did not limit this conversation to test cricket you fool.\n\nThat was done by Manee, and as it is, we will be speaking about test cricket, where I feel Inzamam is easily on top of Tendu\n\nHow am I losing? I have shown Inzamam averages MORE than Tendulkar in WINNING situations. That is, Inzamam helps his team win more than Tendulkar.\n\nInsecure Tendu fans have decided to attack that point by saying that is actually the runs scored in loss/draw situations, which is complete bull.\n\nIn an overall situation, which factors second innings scores (when chasing a total, or setting a total in a test), or having 60 runs to win, with just one wicket in hand, Inzamam's the man.\n\nIf you want cheap runs from a guy who can't score when the team needs him to (as often as Inzamam), then please pick Tendulkar.\n\nTendulkar cannot POSSIBLY be referred to as a legend in test match cricket. He has only HEAVILY decided 2 test matches in 34 tests (wins). And please don't give me that crap about how the batsmen around Tendulkar scored runs so he couldn't, I already showed that Inzamam's peers were actually averaging more in wins than Tendulkar's."
