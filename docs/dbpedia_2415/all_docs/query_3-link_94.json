        "text": "News\n\nSports News\n\nCricket News\n\n2023 ODI World Cup Stat Attack: Pakistan and their 31-year wait for the title\n\nThis story is from October 5, 2023\n\n2023 ODI World Cup Stat Attack: Pakistan and their 31-year wait for the title\n\nPakistan holds the record for most wides and no-balls bowled in World Cup matches. They won the World Cup once in 1992. Javed Miandad is the only Pakistani batter with over 1,000 runs in the World Cup. Pakistan has conceded 40 extras or more in five World Cup fixtures.\n\nPakistan haven't tasted ODI World Cup glory since 1992. (AFP Photo)\n\nDid you know that a Pakistani bowler who is one of the all-time greats of the game holds the unwanted record of bowling the most wides and the most no-balls in World Cup matches?\n\nThe men in green haven't tasted ODI World Cup glory since 1992, when they clinched the holy grail of One Day cricket under Imran Khan's captaincy.\n\nThis time around, with the World Cup being played in Indian conditions, Pakistan - who are hands down the most mercurial team in the history of the game - will be strong title contenders. In fact in the last 10 bilateral ODI series that they have played since 2019-20, Babar Azam and co. have won 8.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk here takes a look at Pakistan's journey in the ODI World Cup over the years via individual and team statistics:\n\nPakistan enjoy a winning % of 58.44, winning 45 & losing 32 out of 79 contested - (No Result 2). They have won the World Cup trophy once - by beating England by 22 runs at Melbourne on March 25, 1992.\n\nWasim Akram (33 off 18 balls and 3 for 49) was deservingly named the Man of the Match in the aforesaid final.\n\nPakistan's innings of 261 for six had 59 extras - vs Scotland at Chester-le-Street on May 20, 1999 - an unwanted record in the World Cup. The break-up of extras - wides 33, no-balls 15, byes 5 leg byes 6.\n\nJaved Miandad remains the only Pakistani batter to manage 1,000-plus runs in the World Cup - his tally being 1032 runs (ave 43.32), including a hundred and eight fifties, in 30 innings.\n\nPakistan have conceded 40 extras or more five times in a World Cup fixture - a dubious distinction earned by them. In their semi-final match against New Zealand at Manchester on June 16, 1999, they had conceded 47 in a total of 241 for seven.\n\nImran Khan with the 1992 Cricket World Cup trophy. (Photo by Ben Radford/Getty Images)\n\nJust one World Cup match resulted in a win for the team chasing without a ball remaining. Pakistan (217/9) had defeated West Indies (216) by just one wicket at Lahore on October 16, 1987.\n\nWasim Akram had captured 55 wickets at 23.83 runs apiece in 38 matches, including one five-wicket and two four-wicket hauls - the most by a Pakistani bowler in the World Cup.\n\nInzamam-ul-Haq appeared in 35 consecutive matches between February 23, 1992 and March 21, 2007 - the most by a Pakistani player in the World Cup. Ricky Ponting holds an all-time World Cup record by appearing in 46 matches in succession.\n\nPakistan's Ijaz Ahmed (26 innings) and New Zealand's Nathan Astle (22 innings) jointly share an unwanted World Cup record - five ducks each.\n\nWahab Riaz (54 not out + four for 45) remains the only Pakistani all-rounder to have accomplished the double of a fifty and four wickets in a World Cup fixture - vs Zimbabwe at Brisbane on March 1,2015. The superb all-round performance has earned him the Man of the Match award - his only award till date in ODIs.\n\nWasim Akram had appeared at 29 different grounds - a Pakistani record in the World Cup. Inzamam-ul-Haq played at 28 venues.\n\nMisbah-ul-Haq's age - 40 years 296 days - when he appeared in his last match vs Australia at Adelaide on March 20, 2015 - his last appearance in ODIs. He remains the oldest Pakistani player in the World Cup/ODIs.\n\nSaqlain Mushtaq remains the only Pakistani bowler to take a hat-trick in the World Cup, achieving the feat against Zimbabwe at The Oval on June 11, 1999 - his victims being Henry Olonga, Adam Huckle & Pommie Mbangwa.\n\nWasim Akram bowled 79 no-balls for Pakistan in 38 games - the most bowled by a bowler in the World Cup. Four other bowlers have delivered 25 or more no-balls - Courtney Walsh (33), Javagal Srinath (29), Brett Lee (29) & Henry Olonga (27).\n\nWasim Akram bowled 126 wides for Pakistan in 38 games - the most bowled by a bowler in the World Cup. Besides Akram, two bowlers have bowled 60 or more wides -Shaun Tait (76 in 18 matches) and Heath Streak (69 in 22 matches).\n\n96 extras were recorded in the Pakistan (59 in 261 for six) vs Scotland (37 in 167) game at Riverside Ground, Chester-le-Street on May 20, 1999 - a record for most extras in a World Cup game/ODI. The only other World Cup game to produce 90 extras is between India (39) and Zimbabwe (51) at Grace Road, Leicester on May 19, 1999.\n\nGoogle Doodle marks the kickoff of ICC Cricket World Cup 2023\n\nSaeed Anwar and Wajahtullah Wasti had shared a stand of 194 for the first wicket vs New Zealand at Manchester on June 16, 1999 - a record for any wicket by Pakistan in the World Cup.\n\nShaheen Shah Afridi had produced a career-best 6 for 35 vs Bangladesh at Lord's on July 5, 2019 - the best figures by a Pakistani bowler in the World Cup.\n\nShahid Afridi remains the only Pakistani bowler to bag two five-wicket hauls in the World Cup - 5 for 16 vs Kenya at Hambantota on February 23, 2011 & 5 for 23 vs Canada at Colombo (RPS) on March 3, 2011.\n\nImran Nazir posted 160 off 121 balls vs Zimbabwe at Kingston on March 21, 2007 - the highest individual innings by a Pakistani batter in the World Cup.\n\nStats Courtesy: Rajesh Kumar\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\nââParis Olympics: Indian athletes who finished just shy of the podiumâ\n\nsports\n\nIndia's medal winners at the Paris 2024 Olympics\n\nsports\n\nParis Olympics conclude with spectacular closing ceremony\n\nsports\n\nIndia's Olympic closing ceremony flagbearers since 2008\n\nsports\n\nWrestler Aman Sehrawat becomes India's youngest Olympic medallist\n\nsports\n\nNeeraj gets silver, hockey team bags bronze for India on Day 13\n\nsports\n\nHeartbreak for Mirabai after Vinesh's disqualification on Day 12\n\nsports\n\nVinesh, Neeraj in finals; hockey team suffers heartbreak on Day 11\n\nsports\n\nIndia's most seasoned ODI cricket captains\n\nsports\n\nLakshya Sen, skeet shooters miss out on bronze medals on Day 10\n\nsports"
