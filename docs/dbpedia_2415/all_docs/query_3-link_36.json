        "text": "Are the bowlers really that great? Are the batters really this poor? Is the pitch unplayable? What explains 23 wickets on a single day, the highest in 50 years? A mix of all of the above? Will it be a two-day Test match? While we can discuss each of these issues till the cows come home, lets digress a little and ask a very different question. Had this played out on an Indian pitch, with the spinners picking up the bulk of the wickets, what would be the narrative now? Rank turner, underprepared wicket, substandard pitch – you can keep recycling those tired, old phrases. The truth is that the curator and the staging association would have been shredded to bits, and India accused of doctoring the pitch and damaging Test cricket. Hypocrisy would take centrestage and credit denied where it is due. In South Africa, however, nothing of the sort would happen. No one will accuse the curator. Rather, the batters are the ones who are to blame and the faster bowlers are all exceptional.

Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information. Forms of cricket range from Twenty20 (also known as T20), with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each \"over\" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three to four hours, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string. The earliest known definite reference to cricket is to it being played in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Southern Africa and the West Indies.[1] #snsinstitutions #snsdesignthinkers #designthinking\n\nCRICKET: The fielding team tries to prevent runs from being scored by dismissing batters (so they are \"out\").

It is productive to maintain touch with the game at grassroots level and helps the aspiring cricketers to face-off against some senior names in the game. But, is that really helpful when we look at the impact of team compositions? I have compiled a list of 61 cricketers who made their Indian Team debut in the last 7 years along with few prominent names in International/IPL level, those emerging IPL names, totalling to 86 names, based on their most recent cricket team at the domestic circuit. Check out the names present in each team, as mentioned in the picture appended to the post, and the contribution of talent from each side to the International level.

FOCUS ON THE OPPORTUNITIES. LESSON FROM RICKY PONTING 1. Ricky Ponting scored more than 27000 runs (Tests + ODIs). 2. When it comes to PLACING THE BALL & FINDING THE GAPS, Ricky Ponting has been acknowledged as the Complete Master. 3. While asked about his ability to find gaps, Ponting answered, \"Every Batsman surveys the field before taking the strike, and usually the fielders get imprinted on his mind. He can see every fielder in his mind's eye. But in my head, I don't see the fielders. I see only the gaps.\" ## Our life in many ways is like a game of cricket. We should stop focusing on Obstacles ( the fielders ), and start focusing on opportunities ( the gaps ).\n\nSome of the new Cricket Australia's new player regulations for the 2023-24 season CA's new regulations: 1. Neck guards while batting is enforced from October 1st. 2. It isn't a 6 anymore if it hits the roof on Ethiad/Marvel Stadium - Ball tracking is used to judge if it would have been a six or not 3. Removal of COVID sub 4. In both BBL comps - Third umpire referrals for stumpings will only review the stumping decision and no other methods of dismissal in a bid to minimize delays in play - The fielding captain will need to let the umpire know if they'd like to review another mode of dismissal prior to the stumping review being sent up to the third umpire. 5. In all comps - Players will only be allowed one five-minute window to receive on-field treatment, after which they would be required to leave the field for any further treatment, meaning batters would be required to retire hurt or bowlers unable to complete their over. This doesn't count for the head 6. Umpires will no longer invite fielding captains to bowl slow bowlers when light deteriorates after the minimum overs to achieve a result have been bowled 7. Amending the statement of result in white-ball cricket to include how many balls remaining in the run chase. 8. Mandating an immediate drinks break if a wicket or stoppage occurs in the 10th over of a men's and women's Big Bash match 9. Adjustment to how wides are adjudged so a batter's trigger movements will not increase the width the bowler has to utilize inside the wide lines.
