        "text": "T20 World Cup 2024: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has raised allegations of ball-tampering against Indian pacer Arshdeep Singh following his remarkable performance in the ICC T20 World Cup Super Eights clash against Australia. Inzamam questioned how Arshdeep managed to reverse-swing the ball in the 16th over while defending the target.\n\nUmpires should keep their eyes open: Inzamam-ul-Haq\n\nArshdeep, who has been the joint-highest wicket-taker in the tournament with 15 wickets in six games at an average of 11.86 and an economy rate of 7.41, is tied with Afghanistan's Fazalhaq Farooqi for the most wickets in the competition.\n\n\"Arshdeep Singh, when he was bowling the 15th over, the ball was reversing. Is it too early (for reverse swing) with the new ball? This means the ball was ready for reverse swing by the 12th or the 13th over. Umpires should keep their eyes open (to spot) these things,\" said Inzamam during a talk show.\n\nInzamam's former teammate, Salim Malik, agreed with his views, suggesting that some teams receive preferential treatment. \"Inzy, I always say this, eyes are kept shut when it comes to some teams, and India is one of those teams. I remember in Zimbabwe, when Wasim (Akram) was bowling, he made it wet, and we all were surprised at it; as in how come one side was wet, and when I went and complained, I was fined quite heavily,\" Malik added.\n\nInzamam also remarked that if a Pakistani bowler had reversed the ball in the same manner, it would have sparked significant controversy. \"If it was Pakistani bowlers (reverse swinging the ball), this would have been a big issue (shor mach jaata). We know reverse swing very well, and if Arshdeep can come in the 15th over and start reversing the ball, it means some serious work had been done before.\"\n\nAlso Read: Exploring new match rules amid rain threat for India vs England T20 World Cup 2024 semifinal\n\nHe continued, \"Because for reverse swing... look Bumrah can do it, because of his action; but for some bowlers - their action and their speed, the ball has to be in that perfect condition and prepared well (to reverse). It could be that the wicket was hard and rough, that could be the reason (for the ball getting scruffed up on one side), but these things have to be noticed.\"\n\nBall-tampering accusation against India during 2023 ODI WC\n\nThis isn't the first time a former Pakistan cricketer has accused India of ball-tampering. Last year, during the 2023 ODI World Cup, Hasan Raza alleged that India was given different balls compared to other teams, aiding their bowlers.\n\nAlso Read: Hasan Raza Claims ICC Or BCCI Is Favouring Team India In WC 2023: Know All About Ex-Pak Player\n\nIndia is not the only team facing such accusations in the 2024 T20 World Cup. Earlier in the tournament, former South African fast bowler Rusty Theron accused Pakistan's Haris Rauf of scratching the ball during the Pakistan vs. USA game. The latter half of the USA's innings saw significant reverse swing from the Pakistan seamers."
