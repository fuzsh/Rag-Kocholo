        "text": "Inzamam made 77 on Tuesday as Pakistan slumped to 364-6\n\nPakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has blamed English groundsman Andy Atkinson for producing a dead pitch for the first Test against India.\n\nOver 1,000 runs have been scored so far, with the hosts 364-6 in reply to IndiaÂ¿s 675-5 declared on day three.\n\n\"The curator did not prepare the pitch we asked for,\" Inzamam said.\n\n\"We need hard and bouncy tracks because fast bowling is our strength. Even grassy wickets will not suit us because our bowlers are not seamers.\"\n\nHe added: \"I have always said that I want to play on positive pitches, but this pitch does not suit us and I hope the wickets in the remaining two Tests will be different.\"\n\nAtkinson, who met Pakistan Cricket Board boss Shahrayar Khan on Monday to discuss the problem, admitted lack of time prevented him from preparing the best wicket possible.\n\n\"I am sure there will be better wickets for the remaining Tests at Lahore and Rawalpindi,\" he added.\n\nInzamam, who has scored centuries in both of Pakistan's previous Tests on his home ground, managed 77 on Tuesday before a dubious dismissal to spinner Anil Kumble.\n\nUmpire Simon Taufel gave Inzamam out caught at short leg, but television replays suggested the ball came off pad rather than bat.\n\n\"I can't talk about the dismissal. You saw it on television and can judge for yourself,\" Inzamam told reporters.\n\nAbdul Razzaq will resume his innings on 47 on Wednesday, with tailender Mohammad Sami due to join him.\n\n\"Our total may not look strong enough when you compare it with India's first innings effort,\" Inzamam added.\n\n\"But I'm hopeful of avoiding the follow-on with Razzaq still at the crease.\""
