        "text": "Pakistan’s overall bowling was a major letdown in the tournament as both fast bowlers and the spinners failed to adapt to the conditions. The Pakistan bowlers combined to average 38.97 in the edition, the third-worst among all teams, and leaked 6.32 runs an over, with only Sri Lanka faring worse in that aspect.\n\nIn the absence of Naseem Shah, Shaheen Shah Afridi was unable to pick up his game with the new ball, taking only four wickets in nine games upfront at 50.8 apiece. Though he ended with 18 wickets, his lack of sting hurt the side; between them, Shaheen and Haris Rauf conceded 1,014 runs through the event.\n\nRauf had an economy rate of 6.75 in the tournament and struggled with his lengths for most parts of the tournament. The Pakistan spinners failed to raise their hands as well, as the slower bowlers picked up 12 wickets across the league stage. Vice-captain Shadab Khan, in particular, was insipid, taking two scalps at an average of 118.50 and was dropped during the World Cup as a result as well.\n\n[breakout id=”0″][/breakout]\n\nMorkel joined Pakistan on a six-month contract in June this year, and announced his resignation with immediate effect. His first assignment was the men’s Test tour to Sri Lanka.\n\nThe former South Africa quick was expected to oversee the three-match Test series in Australia from December 14, and the Pakistan Cricket Board is expected to announce his replacement in due course."
