        "text": "Rohit Brijnath: Australia must be the benchmark for success\n\nA new coach and a new captain may not be enough; India's cricket team also needs new desire, says leading Indian sports writer, Rohit Brijnath.\n\nWas it only last spring that Inzamam-ul-Haq wished he was wearing Sourav Ganguly's shoes? Now look where India is. There is only one measure of progress in cricket - how close are you to challenging Australia? And by that simple yet stern standard, India has slipped.\n\nThe calendar is turning on the lives of India's senior players, its fast bowlers are about as consistent as selectors, the coaching selection has just begun and the captaincy debate is decidedly shrill. Sometimes you almost believe India is allergic to excellence.\n\nRahul Dravid once explained that while the end result of a great innings was satisfying, the process was what he enjoyed most. That may be, but after 385 Tests of waiting for India to be the best in the world, this particular process, while a fine adventure, seems frustratingly interminable.\n\nCricket break\n\nAustralian coach John Buchanan, on the cusp of the Ashes tour, confirmed the obvious recently that he has already begun sketching their World Cup 2007 defence. So it should be. If India has a plan, then it is more secret than a papal vote. Greatness must be chased down, but sometimes it appears we are pursuing it in a rickshaw.\n\nThat ragged 'Indian' versus 'foreign' coach debate will resume shortly, though you'd think 'best' is really what matters\n\nIndia last went on a long break after the victorious 2004 Pakistan tour and thereafter its challenge seemed to deflate. It means this break, three months, assumes even greater significance.\n\nAfter some initial lethargy, Tom Moody, Greg Chappell, Mohinder Amarnath and Sandeep Patil have been nominated for the coaching job by a worthy panel and a quick decision is in everyone's best interests. Any coach, Indian or foreign, requires time to converse with selectors, watch academy cricketers, scrutinise fitness reports, understand pitches and attune himself to the most chaotic mindset in cricket.\n\nBut more than that, urgency would suggest intent, a declaration by officialdom that they are as ambitious as their team. That the board president and Jagmohan Dalmiya (though occasionally we confuse them as the same person) called senior players to assess their opinions was, in that context, a particularly good move.\n\nNot rocket science\n\nThat ragged \"Indian\" versus \"foreign\" coach debate will resume shortly, though you'd think \"best\" is really what matters. John Wright has set an impressive standard, for he did not appear to care whether a player arrived from Calicut or Calcutta, refused to coddle superstars, showed a sensible willingness to deflect attention and had a sharper sense of discipline, work ethic, organisation and vision than his predecessors.\n\nCan India afford to carry on with Ganguly as captain?\n\nThis is hardly a job beyond an Indian, but a local passport seems an insufficient qualification. Those who make this about patriotism miss the point, for sport and nations are better for these exchanges of information. Learning cannot be restricted by geography and even England's soccer team is managed by a Swede.\n\nTalk that only Indians understand the culture of the dressing room is fine, except it is the very culture of the dressing room that requires changing. Language is no issue either, for cricket is not rocket science, though we can occasionally make it seem that way.\n\nOf the many attributes the new coach must own, an ability to work with fast bowlers is mandatory. For all its celebrated options, India's bowling lacks thrust, and winning overseas especially is unlikely if the bowling averages remain as inflated as Zaheer (37.64), Ashish Nehra (42.40), Irfan Pathan (33.08), Aji Agarkar (46.66) and L Balaji (37.18). To give it immediate perspective, Glenn McGrath's average is 21.22 and Jason Gillespie's 25.72.\n\nPowerful legacy\n\nBut of all things, the captaincy issue is most contentious and can play havoc with an unsettled team. The six-match ban for Ganguly is a blessing for the Board of Control for Cricket in India since it allows it an opportunity to dilly-dally. But that would be a mistake. Teams cannot be sure of themselves if the men running it are not. It makes India's job easier if they know if Rahul Dravid is a stop-gap leader or a long-term one.\n\nDravid's work ethic as captain might cement India's belief\n\nThe captaincy debate has a tendency to get particularly personal in India, and either you are a critic of Ganguly or a supporter. The left-hander's leadership record is inscribed in indelible ink and he risks only tampering with a powerful legacy.\n\nGanguly's batting should not so much be seen in scores but in his dismissals; simply, he has not been batting well. Most batsmen suffer such hiccups, and Ganguly, braver than we ever thought, is scarcely done. Yet India must ask itself if it can afford to be led by a man straining to regain authority as batsman and captain.\n\nGanguly has brought this team a staggering distance and handing the baton over is no disgrace. There is no good time for changing captains, and while Rahul Dravid appears to own the qualities to lead, eventually proof will lie in demonstration. Still, if Ganguly brought belief to India, then Dravid's work ethic may well cement it.\n\nBut players cannot hide completely behind a stuttering board or leadership uncertainty, for not even officials can be blamed for balls down the leg side or an unsure captain responsible for bats swished aimlessly at balls outside off stump.\n\nEventually accountability and desire must come from the self and men must set individual standards so high that it does not just propel them further but challenges their team mates. Every man must be an example, not find comfort in a 50 scored or a five wickets taken three Tests before. Acceptable form is tenuous in all sports, but only mediocre athletes are consoled by that. The great are in a never-ending search for consistency.\n\nStill, we are optimistic about India's team only because they have given us reason to be. A season ago they displayed a capability for excellence and it is preferable to see that talent as temporarily misplaced rather than view them as a peaked side.\n\nHere are a selection of your comments send so far. If you would like to send a comment about this story you can use the form below.\n\nGood to see an article stressing desire, pursuit of excellence and captaincy as important factors if India is to improve. I'd have thought it was absolutely essential that a foreigner be selected as coach to avoid the downsides that an Indian national carries - regionalism, inability to get senior players to fall in line, etc. At least the perception of this cannot be avoided with an Indian coach. Quite simply, the Aussies are the best, even as coaches. I hope the Indian board does the right thing.\n\nS Chandrashekar, Australia\n\nThe Indian cricket team and council should not waste time in attacking individual players. Rather, they should make way for new leadership, may it be foreign or domestic, that can foster collaboration between the Indian players and inspire them to work as a team so that they may realise their true potential.\n\nAbhay Sagar, Philippines\n\nBeing a long-time supporter of Indian cricket, I do feel an Austrailian coach like Greg Chappell would inject new ideas and discipline into our cricket. Unfortunately, Indian cricketers play one superb game and four bad ones. This lack of consistency has to stop. Forthcoming matches should be all played with strategy and commitment. One or two players cannot turn the match around, it has to be a team effort, so you guys get your finger out and justify the support and faith your fans have had in you for so long.\n\nChandu Solanki, England\n\nThe article is quite an eye opener for our selectors. India should go for a foreign coach especially from Australia. The success of the Australian team has been their mental strength to perform under pressure and in any situation till the last ball. Indian team lacks this but yes we have improved a lot under the leadership of Wright and Ganguly. Ganguly is surely having a bad time but with our support and hard work from his part he sure will get over it.\n\nSunil, Iraq\n\nI think more than a coach, Indian cricketers need to practise constantly. They should behave, believe and practice like professionals. Indian board should have a way of monitoring the practice habits of top 50- 100 Indian cricketers so that they don't fall back. There should be rating within Indian players like who is the best in bowling, batting fielding and also rate wicket keepers, all-rounders. Also Indian cricket board can set up regional training facility so that reach is not far. Vivek\n\nVivek, New Jersey, USA\n\nWell said Sir! A brilliant summary of the stages Indian cricket has gone through and the stage it is currently at. More than the content of your analysis-which is fairly self-evident albeit to those knowledgeable cricket followers, the style in which your writing has conveyed this analysis is brilliant. Your avoidance of soapy metaphors and exaggerated and unworthy synonyms makes your piece an utterly good read. Again well done.\n\nShyam, Australia\n\nI strongly believe that Ganguly should only be selected as a player first. If he is selected captaincy should be a secondary choice. Frankly speaking on his current form, he can not enter the test or one day team, let alone be the captain of the site.\n\nMalik, Canada\n\nVery good article. Firstly India should set an example with the coach selection because in South Asia its all about politics and that should be left out of the game. I am a Pakistani and a very big fan of the Indian team but I think that they should decide on the coach as soon as possible and leave Ganguly as captain because he has worked hard with the Indian team and let him continue.\n\nAqil Yasin, UK\n\nFantastic article. I especially like the reference to Australia as the bench mark for international teams. India have superb players but could maybe try modelling themselves on Australia at bit more as I feel India lack a Michael Clarke or Adam Gilchrist middle order match winner. Give Moody the coach job and keep Sourav as captain, he's got some good cricket left in him yet. I also think giving Dravid the captaincy would just affect his batting and India need him in form.\n\nDaniel Armstrong, England\n\nThere is only one solution - It's time certain section of public and some media people realise that only one thing matters -India winning ,and not a particular player's 50 centuries or 100 half centuries. These individual achievements can never bring fame to any country. One thing that matters is performances that produce result and not individual records. Laxman's 281 and Dravid's great performances are sweetest memories because our country won great victories.\n\nArjun, India\n\nExcellent article. India needs more than just a good coach. As the recent series against Pakistan showed, until and unless India has a quality, penetrative bowling attack, no amount of batting prowess is going to enable it to be a world-dominating team. India is also in dire need of a quality all rounder(s) and a sound wicket keeping batsman. Finally, Ganguly should be selected on the basis of his batting form alone, and not some captaincy mumbo jumbo.\n\nChellury R. Sastry, USA\n\nDear Mr Brijnath, let me congratulate you on your article. I have long felt, from a distance, that the BCCI has consistently shown how immature their organisation is. Politics and the continual sniping amongst its members will never end, till a CEO is handed the day to day running. The millions made from the millions who attend, are quite frankly unaccountable to the ordinary man. The richest board repeatedly shows the poorest application and industry.\n\nDilpesh Amin, Great Britain\n\nWhat an article! From the humour in \"There is only one measure of progress in cricket - how close are you to challenging Australia?\" to the wisdom in \"The great are in a never-ending search for consistency\", this article articulately pins down the thoughts running through the many disappointed fans of Indian cricket. I think that biggest lesson the Indian cricket team and selectors should learn from the spectacular Australians is that performance is a superior measure to brand equity for a player.\n\nNishant Miglani, India\n\nI follow cricket and have been following for a long time now. Indians need to pick the team based on pure merit and the performance of each player over the past season. I guess, they can look at VVS Laxman to lead the side as I feel that he has the style and the brains to take India to the next level. Rahul Dravid is good but I'm not sure if he would be an effective leader. Verdict: Coaching-Tom Moody Captain-VVS LAXMAN Thanks. JG.\n\nJason Gallian, USA\n\nThe answer is for there to be far less cricket played. This will keep both cricketers and supporters fresh in mind and body. Schedules are set with £ in mind, rather than for the good of the game.\n\nAgnello Gomes, UK\n\nI would say Dravid would good captain for the Indian team .\n\nObaid, Afghanistan\n\nIndia should hire a foreign coach, how is it possible for a coach not to be allowed to pick his own side? I don't believe the selectors know or understand the squad as well as the coach. The Indian board is politically discriminatory. Those players at a superior hierarchy will always continue to play. Ganguly a great player, has not performed recently, if he was playing for Australia, captain or not he would be replaced. How can a player like M Kaif with great technical skill not be chosen in the test squad?\n\nK Patel, UK\n\nThe author has hit the nail on the head. BCCI should react quickly -- all kinds of rumours and innuendoes can thus be quashed. Oh why are they so slow. Ganguly still has a lot of cricket left in him and every body realises that who is a true lover of Indian Cricket.\n\nKuldip Shankar., India\n\nBeing an Indian I would rather see a foreign coach, no disrespect to Asian coaches, because it seems when having a foreign coach there's a lot of discipline, the fielding is up to a good standard, fitness is top class, where having an Indian coach where they themselves have never dived to stop a ball what will they teach the players, there's no discipline all politics.\n\nSalim Rehman, London, UK\n\nIndia as a nation has both the quality of players and the desire to dominate test cricket. The national team however lacks the confidence and organisation required to do so.\n\nJames Blackstock, UK\n\nI think coach issue should be settled as quickly as possible, the more time it takes, and more it will prevail uncertainties in the ranks of the board as well as the team. They should be crystal clear who will be their coach way before the Sri Lankan tour. I think this is the right time for BCCI to check how capable Dravid is as far as captaincy is concerned. I am totally agreed with the writer in this.\n\nTufail Khan Khalil, Pakistan\n\nI do not think, promoting India's best batsman Rahul Dravid to captaincy, is a solution. His batting will be under tremendous pressure and I do not think Indian cricket can afford that. We need to think beyond the seniors. I think for tests Mohammed Kaif should be made the captain. For ODIs , Sourav should continue for couple of tournaments more, should be given the chance to go out on a high but then I would highly recommend Yuvraj Singh. Bodhi Dasgupta\n\nDodhi Dasgupta, UK\n\nA well written article. The bottom line is that 'you can only lead a horse to water, you cannot force it to drink'. Any amount of inputs will be useless to a board which does not consult the coach while selecting the team! The BCCI has become a haven for gents whose only aim in life is to feather their own nests. Things will improve only when we un-hinge ourselves from the Sachin/Ganguly complex, after all no one is indispensable.\n\nAnand Singh, India\n\nBetter to retain the captain, acquire a new coach and try to get a good bowling all-rounder to the Indian team. Surely that will raise performances in one day internationals.\n\nK Velauthamurty, Sri Lanka\n\nI want to see Sehwag as captain, because I think he will be a better captain for India.\n\nAbdul Latief, India\n\nNationality should not be an issue in choosing a coach, the objective is to select the best one, the one who will be capable of working with the players for the success of the team. On the issue of captaincy, I feel that Ganguly should be given a chance. He is an exceptional batsman and his record as a captain speaks for itself.\n\nDinesh Singh, Guyana\n\nI think Ganguly should still be the captain of the Indian cricket team even though he has not been in form for last few months. Under his captaincy, the Indian team does well.\n\nPartha Datta, USA\n\nGanguly is a very good and hard working captain. He should not be changed. In cricket up and downs always come - just look at the West Indies. This team has been in the drain for the last five years. It does not matter if India has lost a series, what matters is keeping faith in the players, and keep on looking for young talent to be introduced in the middle.\n\nAbdul Qadeer, USA\n\nI think India should consider giving chances to new players. There are so many talented players in India. In a country of one billion people, we should not depend on any one player. Jagjit Singh Panesar, Canada\n\nWhat India needs is a set of two to three bowlers who can take wickets consistently at around 25 runs per wicket and around 50 balls per wicket, irrespective of the surface and the country they bowl in. Right now what India has is a set of bowlers who are probably the best in India but nowhere near the world standards.\n\nKrishna Dutt, India/U.S.A.\n\nI think this is a very insightful article. In addition to the main points (new coach, new captain, team success ethic), I would add that the team are carrying one or two individuals. Ganguly's loss of form is apparent. However, so is Tendulkar's. I think that India in brimming with talent, but we are not using it and are not pushing our players to achieve the high standards required to be the Number 1 team in world cricket.\n\nNoel Vas, UK\n\nName\n\nYour E-mail address\n\nCountry\n\nComments"
