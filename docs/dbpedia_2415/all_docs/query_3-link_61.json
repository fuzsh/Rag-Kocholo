        "text": "If Misbah and co are to prevent hosts from ruling the roost, then they must rely on their bowlers to deliver\n\nEmmad Hameed June 25, 2016\n\nAfter tasting success in the first few years of gaining Test status, Pakistan had to then wait till the late 70s to register home and away wins in cricket’s longest format.\n\nThe change in fortunes coincided with Imran Khan’s emergence as a strike bowler of excellence.\n\nImran combined with the originator of reverse swing, Sarfraz Nawaz, to help record landmark Test victories in Australia and the West Indies.\n\nAmir advised to stay calm when provoked, says Pakistan team manager\n\nIn England, Pakistan won a Test in the 1982 three-match series under Imran and recorded their first-ever series win at the home of cricket five years later.\n\nFrom 1987 to 2001, Pakistan dominated their away Test encounters against England — wins delivered on the back of outstanding bowling attacks.\n\nThe legendary Imran led from the front as he snared 21 wickets in the 1987 triumph, before the likes of pacers Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Aaqib Javed and spinners Mushtaq Ahmed and Saqlain Mushtaq helped maintain the visitors’ stranglehold for years to come.\n\nThe two Sultans of Swing found England to be a happy hunting ground. Wasim claimed 53 wickets in 14 Tests, while Waqar managed 45 in just 10.\n\nPakistan to wear Edhi foundation logo on kit during England tour\n\nMushtaq — who took match-winning five-wicket hauls in the second innings of the 1996 Lord’s and Oval Tests — claimed 32 wickets in eight Tests there.\n\nSaqlain played a single Test there and claimed five wickets in its second innings to hand Pakistan a dramatic last day win in the 2001 Old Trafford Test.\n\nBut it has become increasingly difficult since then. Pakistan next toured England for a Test series in 2006. The four-match contest was lit up by the batting of Mohammad Yousuf, who scored 613 runs at an average of 90.14, while Younus Khan supported him with 329 runs at 65.80.\n\nHowever, unlike previous years, the bowling was unable to deliver and shorn of their main weapon, Pakistan found going decidedly tougher.\n\nThe series was already lost by the time captain Inzamamul Haq decided to forfeit the final Oval Test after being handed a five-run penalty for alleged ball-tampering. While Pakistan may have gone on to win the Test, having been in a dominant position, the win would only have ended the series 2-1 in England’s favour, instead of the eventual 3-0.\n\nMohammad Amir will not receive hostile reception in England: Imran Khan\n\nThe pick of a woeful bowling bunch was fast-bowler Umar Gul, who claimed 18 wickets at an average of 34.11.\n\nPakistan returned four years later for another four-match series but this time around, the batsmen were unable to duplicate their previous heroics. Three totals below 100 meant the series went down as one of the worst batting performances by Pakistan.\n\nThe bowlers, on the other hand, upped the ante and managed to deliver a win in the Oval Test where the batsmen also found their feet.\n\nMohammad Amir was the destroyer-in-chief as he claimed 19 wickets at an impressive 18.36. Amir was supported well by new-ball partner Mohammad Asif and off-spinner Saeed Ajmal, who both claimed 12 wickets apiece.\n\nThe series, however, was marred by the spot-fixing scandal that saw both Amir and Asif banned from cricket for five years.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nNow donning the hat of chief selector, Inzamam has picked Amir, Wahab Riaz, Imran Khan Senior, Rahat Ali and Sohail Khan as Pakistan’s bowling attack for the tour of England. Leg-spinner Yasir Shah and left-arm spinner Zulfiqar Babar will provide the slow variety.\n\nOut of the lot, only Amir and Wahab have ever played for Pakistan in England — a combined total of eight Tests between the seven bowlers.\n\nAfridi thinks English conditions will test youngsters\n\nHowever, all of them — barring perhaps Sohail — are automatic selections considering their recent bowling form.\n\nIf Pakistan are to shake the obdurate English batters in the four-match series next month, they will need their Test regulars to come up trumps.\n\nSkipper Misbahul Haq will be hoping Yasir can repeat his performances of UAE last year, where he consistently troubled the England batsmen with his leg-spin.\n\nAmir’s return to Lord’s — the ground where he bowled those infamous no-balls and played his last Test five years ago — will provide a compelling side-plot for the series that kicks off on July 14.\n\nThe 24-year-old’s obvious talent and impressive white-ball form aside, Amir is untested in red-ball international cricket since his ban was lifted late last year. However, he has since featured in several ODI and T20I matches, including the Asia Cup and the World T20.\n\nWith the team already in England, the build-up and acclimatisation is under way, and Amir is Misbah’s potential trump card.\n\nEngland will be doubly motivated to defeat Pakistan — they are the only team in the world to have defeated England in their previous series — and if the Men in Green are to prevent the hosts from ruling the roost, then they must rely on their bowlers to deliver.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, June 25th, 2016.\n\nLike Sports on Facebook, follow @ETribuneSports on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation."
