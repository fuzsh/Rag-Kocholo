        "text": "Nothing was ruled out. In the febrile hours after Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer was pronounced murdered on Thursday 22 March, suspects came and went with the tropical breeze. In an antechamber of Kingston's Jamaica Pegasus hotel, Mark Shields, the Deputy Police Commissioner of Jamaica, and the few British reporters squashed beside him sat at the heart of an international sensation: a sporting murder at a World Cup.\n\nIn the windowless room that evening, anything seemed possible. Was Woolmer poisoned? 'It's possible,' Shields said. The work of a hitman? Maybe. Is there more than one murderer? Plausible. Could a match-fixing syndicate have ordered the cricket coach's death? A shrug. At 6ft 6in and with his good looks and natty suits, Shields, the former Scotland Yard officer, was the English copper straight from central casting. He had arrived in Jamaica in 2002 to investigate a shooting and was then appointed Deputy Commissioner, on secondment from the Yard. Now, his responsibility was to find the killer of one of cricket's best-known figures, a former England Test player who had become a coach of international renown.\n\nShields mentioned the arrival of cricket's anti-corruption unit in Jamaica. He suggested that we, the assembled journalists, examined the odds for the game the previous Saturday that had seen Woolmer's Pakistan lose sensationally to Ireland. Pakistan had been 1-20 for their St Patrick's Day Group D World Cup match at Sabina Park. Ireland, 8-1 outsiders, won by three wickets, having dismissed Pakistan for 132 (at one stage, Pakistan were 66 for five).\n\nThe following day, with Pakistan out of the tournament, Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room. It was then that I flew to Kingston to investigate the story. Fact had become rumour. Rumour became fact. One correspondent cited reports from India that Woolmer, 58, had been silenced to stop him revealing details of a match-fixing racket he had stumbled upon. Woolmer had, after all, coached South Africa when their captain, Hansie Cronje, was revealed to have been accepting money to fix matches. DPC Shields asked for the article to be forwarded to him.\n\nOutside, a downpour drenched the Kingston streets. Fresh theories, each more outlandish than the last, were tossed between the reporters. The murderer was an enraged Pakistan fan. It was the cricket mafia. The Pakistan team captain. A terrorist plot by Islamic extremists. An underworld bookmaker who had lost millions.\n\nWho killed Bob Woolmer? Frankly, back then, it felt as if anyone might have murdered him, and that there were many who wanted him dead.\n\nWoolmer's body was found on the morning of Sunday 18 March, in the white-tiled bathroom of room 374, on the 12th floor of the Jamaica Pegasus hotel. He was lying naked on his back, his legs splayed. There was blood in his mouth and vomit on the walls. Woolmer was not a well man. He was taking medication for diabetes and had just lost one of the most important matches of his career. When it was first announced that he had been found dead, it was widely assumed that he had suffered a heart attack, though there were suggestions, too, that he had committed suicide.\n\nOn Wednesday 21 March, Pakistan played Zimbabwe in their last group match. The game was preceded by a minute's silence as a mark of respect for Woolmer and Pakistan's win was dedicated to their late coach. Twenty-four hours after that success, which did little for the victors but enabled Ireland to qualify for the next round ahead of Zimbabwe, came the shock announcement that Woolmer had been murdered.\n\nThe case took its most surreal turn on Saturday 24 March. Shields had called an emergency press conference in the lobby of the Pegasus, shortly before 7pm local time. At the same time, 30 miles away at Montego Bay, the Pakistan team were preparing to board a flight to London. Moments before take-off, something extraordinary happened: team captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, assistant coach Mushtaq Ahmed and team manager Talat Al were asked to step to one side for questioning over alleged 'ambiguities' in their statements. They were released later that night but, as they trooped across the tarmac to the plane, reporters screamed: 'Did you kill Woolmer?'\n\nMeanwhile, back in Kingston, Shield's press conference was chaotic. A teetering pile of dictaphones were placed on the table in front of him.\n\nTwo days earlier he had declared that Woolmer was murdered, the exact cause of death 'asphyxia as a result of manual strangulation'. Now the implication seemed to be that the Pakistan trio were suspects. Shields was especially interested in finding out why Talat had suddenly changed his name to a false one at the Pegasus in the period after Woolmer's death. He mentioned unexplained scratch marks on Mushtaq's face - Woolmer had been found with cuts to the bridge of his nose. Was this evidence of a struggle?\n\nThe Pakistan team eventually left Jamaica that night. But, amid all the gossip of sinister Asian betting syndicates and CCTV footage that would reveal the identity of the killer or killers, their return seemed inevitable. That night, police briefings appeared to indicate that Woolmer's killer may have come from within the Pakistan camp. Soon afterwards, it was reported that three Pakistan officials had gone missing and were now suspects. Reports surfaced of a row between Woolmer and his players on the team bus after the Ireland defeat. Shields suggested Woolmer's killers were not Jamaican gangsters; Yardies used guns or knives.\n\nBut then something changed. During a press briefing two days later, Shields's body language betrayed doubt. He had been '100 per cent certain' that Woolmer was strangled. Now he qualified his conviction to avoid being, as he put it, 'professionally embarrassed'. So was Woolmer murdered or not?\n\nSome Jamaican detectives were, from the start, unconvinced that it was murder. Officers who first entered Woolmer's bathroom on 18 March had concluded, from what they saw, that he was not murdered. There were no marks on him. No sign of a struggle. But their expert consensus was overruled by senior officers. Apparent blunders followed in the forensic investigation. Cautionary protocols were disregarded. Bob's widow, Gill, at home in Cape Town, told friends that she believed 'mistakes were made' by investigators.\n\nIn addition, further evidence indicated that Woolmer's health was worse than previously believed. It has since emerged that Scotland Yard, who were assisting Shields, first raised the possibility that Woolmer was not murdered as early as late April. Yet another 45 days passed before, on 12 June, the Jamaican Constabulary Force announced that Woolmer had in fact died of natural causes. It was not murder. There was no murderer.\n\nSo who was Bob Woolmer? And why, for all his reported charm and amiability, was he caught up in the greatest scandals of modern cricket?\n\nHe was born in Kanpur, India, on 14 May 1948, the son of a cricket-loving father who worked as a civil servant and once captained the United Provinces team in India's domestic championship. The family moved back to England in the mid-1950s settling in Kent, where Woolmer attended The Skinners' School in Tunbridge Wells. He was a talented schoolboy all-rounder, and, at the age of 20, he joined the Kent county staff.\n\nIn 1975, he made his England debut against Australia at Lord's. But in 1977, at his peak, he joined World Series Cricket, Kerry Packer's breakaway competition in Australia, one of six England players who turned out for a World team against sides representing Australia and West Indies. He was banned by the Test & County Cricket Board, along with the other Packer players, and though that punishment was overturned in the High Court he did not play for England again until 1980.\n\nWoolmer played World Series cricket for the money but, unlike the other England players who signed for Packer he was under 30 and, it had been assumed, had a long future ahead of him as a Test player. 'It was a bit of a surprise when he signed up,' says Bob Willis, then England's opening bowler. 'But the contracts were worth about Â£15,000, which was a lot of money at the time. I suspect that he was strongly influenced by Alan Knott and Derek Underwood, who were two of his senior team-mates in the Kent dressing room and also joined.' Woolmer never felt regret. 'Bob loved cricket as entertainment, he loved the fact that Packer wanted to make cricket sexy,' says South African journalist Neil Manthorp, a friend of Woolmer's for 20 years.\n\nOn his return to the England side, Woolmer failed to hold down a regular place and, in 1982, took part in the rebel tour of apartheid South Africa, led by Graham Gooch. (Underwood and Knott were also on the tour.) He earned around Â£50,000 for the tour - good money for a cricketer, in those days - but it was a tour of disgrace and defied the British government's policy of sporting isolation for South Africa. This time, he was banned from playing for England for three years, effectively ending his international career at the age of 33.\n\nWoolmer chased money, but he was no white supremacist. When his playing career was over, he coached a 'Coloured' team named Avendale in Cape Town and was delighted when the township embraced the sport. 'I do believe Bob when he said that if he changed the life of a single child in a township then everything was worth it,' says Manthorp.\n\nWoolmer, who had by now met and married Gill, returned to England in 1987, coaching first at Kent and then, to great success, Warwickshire, who won an unprecedented treble in 1994. Former South Africa Test star Allan Donald, who describes Woolmer as his mentor and called for the World Cup to be abandoned when it was announced that the coach had been murdered, played for that Warwickshire side. 'Dennis Amiss brought him over in 1991 and we clicked immediately,' Donald says. 'Given that he was mainly a batsman, he had an extraordinary understanding of the mechanics of bowling, which helped me enormously. When Dr Ali Bacher, the head of the United South Africa Cricket Board, was thinking about appointing him as national coach in 1994, he asked me what I thought. I told him he had no worries - I didn't have a bad word to say about the man.'\n\nWoolmer became coach of South Africa later that year. 'Taking the job when South Africa was moving from an all-white team to one that integrated both black and white was not going to be easy,' Willis says. In the event, Woolmer turned the country into one of the toughest international teams. At Test level, South Africa were arguably the leading nation behind Australia. In the one-day game, they were ranked number one for several years and would have been strong favourites to win the World Cup final in 1999 had they not lost to Australia in the semi-final after an extraordinary run-out in the final over cost them the game. Woolmer became renowned as one of the game's innovators, one of the first coaches to introduce laptops and computer programs to his players.\n\nBut, in 2000, he again found himself enmeshed in scandal, this time over match-fixing, when Hansie Cronje - who died in a 2002 plane crash - confessed to accepting four bribes from bookmakers. Woolmer had stepped down as coach a year earlier and was not implicated, but he defended Cronje, his great friend, with a vigour that some thought misjudged. 'He [Cronje] would never succumb to such a thing,' Woolmer told officials investigating match-fixing. 'It beggars belief.' Others saw it as evidence of Woolmer's loyalty. Donald says: 'I have never seen a closer bond between coach and captain as that enjoyed by him and Hansie Cronje.'\n\nBut the Pakistan job, which he took in 2004, tested even Woolmer's love of a challenge. 'Coaching Pakistan is cricket's toughest job,' Willis says. 'There's so much political wrangling on and off the pitch that it is almost impossible to get right.'\n\nWoolmer was unable to resist the role, accepting it even against the advice of his wife. 'I was surprised when he took the Pakistan job,' Donald says. 'I had spoken to him not long before when he was working for the ICC [the sport's world governing body] promoting the game in developing countries. He told me then that he was sick and tired of all the travelling around. But coaching was what he loved. His study was piled high with cricket manuals. He was always looking to help his players improve.'\n\nFor the last three years of his life, then, Woolmer had one of the most stressful jobs in sport, managing a gifted and ambitious team but one riven by factions, nepotism and conspiracies. A year before Cronje admitted his crime, two Pakistan players, Salim Malik and Ata-ur-Rehman, had been banned for match-fixing, although Rehman's ban was later revoked and Malik continues to appeal his. The country's President, General Musharraf, is patron of the Pakistan Cricket Board, leading to claims of political influence. In September 2006, following a ball-tampering row at the Oval Test in which Pakistan refused to take the pitch against England and forfeited the match, the board's chairman Shaharyar Khan, who had hired Woolmer, abruptly resigned. Not long afterwards, two of the team's leading players, Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, were suspended from playing after tests revealed they had used the banned substance nandrolone. An appeals committee later overturned their playing bans on the grounds that they had not 'knowingly' taken the drug.\n\nSome of Woolmer's problems with his Pakistan team were more personal. The depth of frustrations between the coach and his captain Inzamam-ul-Haq have only recently emerged. Woolmer felt some of the devout Muslims in his team were more interested in praying than playing. And his own lack of faith perplexed his captain. 'Inzy would ask him, \"Why don't you believe in God?\"' Neil Manthorp says. 'Bob would answer, \"Don't worry about me, I'm very happy.\" But Inzy would say, \"You don't have religion, that's not good. You are a very good coach and we respect you, but you do not have God.\" They would talk for days on such issues.' When news broke that his friend had been strangled, Manthorp's first instinct was that a religious zealot was to blame.\n\nCoaching Pakistan was a brave choice for Woolmer in light of his poor health - he was a diabetic and suffered from high blood pressure. He also had respiratory problems that he sometimes eased by wearing a breathing mask. And the pressure on the night he died had become intolerable. He reached room 374 just after 7.30pm and ordered room service 30 minutes later. Following the Ireland match, he had told the media that he wanted 'to sleep on my future as coach'. But Woolmer could not relax. At 3.12am he emailed Gill expressing his unhappiness. Seven hours and 33 minutes later, his body was found. Although police knew he had diabetes, his close friends fretted over the coughing fits that would leave him gasping for breath and choking so uncontrollably he was brought to the brink of vomiting.\n\n'Something would cause him to cough and agitate all the phlegm inside him,' Manthorp says. 'It was a violent reaction. His eyes would stream and he would struggle to breathe as if he was about to vomit. He loved Thai food, but sometimes it would lead to the violent coughing. Something he ate could easily have triggered it off.'\n\nThe trouble is, police have not revealed what he ate that night in his hotel room. From what we know now, a severe choking fit could explain the symptoms of asphyxia detected by the autopsy as well as the vomit found near his body. Gasping for breath, and sick, the scenario of Woolmer staggering into his bathroom and suffering a seizure is the most plausible explanation yet to emerge.\n\nContrary to reports, Woolmer was not overweight. On the night he died, he was the lightest he had been for a decade. 'He went swimming every morning and had lost 15 kilos,' Manthorp says. 'He was strong and fit.'\n\nIn retrospect, the belief that Woolmer was murdered was based on the evidence of a single autopsy report, which also found signs suggesting a wholly benign explanation for his death.\n\nInitially, Jamaican police said the verdict of a second pathologist was being sought to corroborate the suspicion of murder. But a second opinion was never offered. Why not? Senior officers were, after all, keenly aware of evidence that the island's pathology service had a history of failing correctly to identify cause of death.\n\nShields talked of 'very clear evidence of murder' at the scene that he dared not reveal for prejudicing the inquiry. But the tantalising details of which he spoke never materialised.\n\nOn 16 March, the day before Pakistan played Ireland, guests arrived at the Pegasus for the pre-match cocktail party. There was an uneasy atmosphere. On one side of the banquet room were Pakistan squad members, journalists and team officials. Alone, facing them, sat a middle-aged man with greying hair: Woolmer, whose side had lost their opening match to West Indies three days earlier.\n\nJust after 6pm a group of Irish cricket writers and players joined him. The banter was free and easy. A couple of reporters from Pakistan wandered over. Instantly, the mood soured. An 'astonishingly aggressive' exchange ensued, according to one witness. Afterwards, Woolmer turned to the Irish journalists and accused their Pakistani counterparts of being out to ruin him at the behest of former players Imran Khan and Javed Miandad.\n\n'They're spies for Javed and Imran,' Woolmer said. 'It doesn't matter what I tell them, they go off and write whatever they want to.' Asked about suing under Pakistani libel laws, Woolmer almost spat out his drink. 'You must be kidding. They don't exist. It would take 10 years.' Woolmer never regained his composure, refusing to give interviews, and soon left the room. Twenty-four hours later, during his final night, his effigy was burned outside his apartment in Lahore by fans, enraged by their team's defeat and hostile media reports.\n\nWoolmer's coaching career had reached its lowest point. His desolate expression as he folded away his laptop in near darkness at the end of the match revealed the depth of his despair.\n\nOn returning to the Pegasus, Woolmer headed straight for room 374. He took the lift with Pakistan wicketkeeper Shoaib Malik. They ascended in silence. As the elevator stopped on the third floor, Woolmer stepped aside and uttered his last known words: 'Ladies first.' Big Bob. Always the joker. Generous and genial were the adjectives most often used in his obituaries.\n\nA month after Woolmer's death, the murder investigation spanned three continents: Asia, North America and Europe. Significant developments were reported, but in truth the inquiry was floundering. More than 400 people had been interviewed yet police had not identified a single suspect.\n\nAt the end of April, BBC1's Panorama, watched by 3.4 million viewers, said that the 58-year-old was poisoned before being strangled. But the toxicology report on which these claims were said to be based found nothing. A theory had grown that because there were no marks on Woolmer's body, he must have been rendered helpless before being strangled: surely a man of his strength and size would have put up a fight? Shields suggested that the killer might have used a towel to strangle Woolmer. Tests in room 374 yielded nothing.\n\nConcerns had already been expressed by Scotland Yard. After a three-man team of senior Metropolitan Police detectives returned from Kingston, they sent a review of the Woolmer investigation, along with a list of recommendations, to their Jamaican colleagues at the end of April. Doubts over the autopsy and forensics are understood to have been raised. One reason, it was suggested, why no murderer had been identified was that the elusive strangler never existed.\n\nSerious errors in the crucial days after Woolmer died ensured that a flawed line of inquiry - the murder claim - went largely unquestioned. Antiquated equipment and forensics, hasty decision-making and a lack of reliable evidence compounded the mistake. The CCTV footage of Woolmer on the 12th floor of the Pegasus - the last images of him alive - had to be flown to London to enhance its quality, delaying for weeks the discovery that no one else entered room 374 that night. Scotland Yard was asked to re-examine Kingston's toxicology analysis.\n\nThe crime scene outside room 374 resembled one from the 1950s, its white door smothered in the black smudges of fingerprint dust for days. In the hours that followed Woolmer's death, at least six of the Pakistan team entered the room. In normal circumstances, crime scenes are sealed off immediately to avoid disturbance at the most critical stage of forensic analysis. Did this unwittingly implicate Pakistan team members?\n\nKingston pathologist Ere Seshaiah's initial autopsy report was inconclusive. Toxicology and histology (the study of tissue samples) tests would help determine the cause of death, he said, but he had, however, found a 'very' enlarged heart, a classic symptom of a naturally occurring heart attack.\n\nTwo days later on March 22, Seshaiah told Shields that the death was suspicious. The hyoid, a horseshoe-shaped bone in the neck, was broken - a sign of strangulation. Although Seshaiah had initially missed the broken bone, he now believed that Woolmer had died of asphyxia. The test results that might have challenged his verdict were not yet complete. As the media clamoured for a definitive explanation for the death, which had damaged the reputation of Jamaica during the troubled World Cup, the island's police opted for the spectacular. They opted for murder. It was a decision based on too little evidence, too soon.\n\nSeshaiah's change of mind provided the impetus for a murder inquiry. No second opinion was deemed necessary, despite the medical consensus that broken hyoids indicate strangulation only when 'other factors are present'. One such factor is a mottling of the facial skin. Photographs of Woolmer's face seem to rule this out. There was no mottling. Shields later conceded that the detective's 'sixth sense' had helped indicate murder in the early stages of his investigation. Perhaps Shields, who relished the company of journalists, had been caught up in the glamour and intrigue of what had happened: a dead cricket celebrity at the World Cup in Jamaica.\n\nJamaican pathologists point out that Woolmer's body was stored in a private funeral home rather than a morgue, potentially diminishing the controls over how corpses are stored. Could contamination between Seshaiah's two autopsies explain his leap from inconclusive to a murder verdict in just two days?\n\nQuestions remain over whether the autopsy met international standards. A study from Dundee University, reviewing the autopsy reports on several Jamaican murders, concluded a 'serious deficiency in being able to classify what was or was not murder'. Autopsies that should take several hours were in Jamaica taking on average 20 minutes.\n\nBy early May, there was sufficient concern for the Jamaican police to ask British authorities to evaluate Seshaiah's reasoning. Home Office pathologist Dr Nat Carey was unimpressed. In mid-May, Carey sent a report to Kingston explaining that Woolmer was not strangled. The hyoid appeared intact. A Canadian pathologist corroborated Carey's findings. By now desperate, Jamaican police sought a third opinion. Even before its verdict, they had started discussing how they could announce they had arrived at a murder verdict. On 7 June, the third strangulation expert, a South African, told Jamaican police that Woolmer died of natural causes. A week later the case was officially closed. In hindsight, it all makes sense. It was a simple human tragedy: the tale of a man who died alone in a hotel in a foreign country at his lowest professional hour.\n\nAccording to Manthorp, Woolmer's widow and his sons, Russell and Dale, are adjusting to life without a husband or a father. 'Gill is very rough to be honest,' he told me. 'But she's putting one foot in front of the other. There will be no public criticism of the police. Mistakes were made. Her husband has gone. There is nothing to be gained or achieved by pointing the finger at anyone.'\n\nIn the meantime, it is business as usual for Deputy Police Commissioner Shields. There will be fresh manhunts to occupy him in a country with the world's third highest homicide rate. Some may even turn out to be murder.\n\nÂ· Mark Townsend is crime correspondent of The Observer. Additional reporting by Richard Gillis\n\nThe OSM file\n\nÂ· Woolmer suffered from dangerous coughing fits, which were ignored by the police investigation. Friends say they could be sparked by certain foods: no one has discovered what Woolmer ate on his final evening.\n\nÂ· Scotland Yard officers knew since April that the investigation was flawed and suggested that Woolmer's death was from natural causes 45 days before Jamaican police called off the murder investigation.\n\nÂ· Woolmer's relationship with his team was under increasing strain from religious disputes. The coach was frequently questioned by his captain, Inzamam, over his atheism. They had many anguished discussions about belief."
