        "text": "I created an interactive workbook with Tableau to determine the test batsmen who have had the highest proportion of innings scoring at least m runs after having played n test innings. Below are some screenshots for particular choices of m runs. The data is available from [1]. As expected Bradman comes up on top in many scenarios but it is interesting to see other names that appear up there.\n\n(Click on the above image to go to the Tableau page if you wish to change the parameters. You can also select the “Innings by innings” tab to look up a player’s list of innings.)\n\nBelow we some examples for different m (full-career stats among players who have played at least 20 innings).\n\nm=1: A total of 22 players have had an entire career of 20+ innings getting off the mark each time, with RA Duff (Australia, 1902-1905) the only to play 40 innings (note that JW Burke played 44 innings without a duck, but made 0 not out in one innings).\n\nAngelo Mathews (SL) has managed just 2 ducks in his 154 innings to date.\n\nm=10: Hobbs, Hutton, Kanhai and Sobers stand out here, having played over 100 innings and reaching double figures at least 80% of the time (Hobbs over 86%). Labuschagne, Hetmyer, Handscomb and Head are recent players to feature highly here.\n\nm=25: Bradman starts to distance himself from the rest. Hammond, Smith, Sobers and de Villiers also impress here.\n\nm=50: Smith has matched Barrington’s career figures of 50+ starts. Sutcliffe had 33 50+ scores in his first 64 innings, the same as Bradman.\n\nm=75: Barrington’s numbers are amazing here and Katich is ahead of Kohli, Tendulkar and Lara.\n\nm=100: Smith and Kohli are currently higher than Sangakkara, the highest among recent retirees.\n\nm=125: Only Bradman (6) had more 140+ scores than Labuschagne after playing 23 test innings, equal with Graeme Smith (who had 4 150+ scores in his first 17 innings!).\n\nm=150: Bradman is so far ahead of the rest here. Lara and Sangakkara are just one behind Tendulkar with the most 150+ scores despite almost 100 fewer innings.\n\nm=175: Again Lara and Sangakkara have the same number of 175+ scores (15).\n\nm=200: Kohli is similar to Hammond’s career figures at this stage, with 6 of his 7 double centuries coming within 33 innings between July 2016 and December 2017.\n\nPlease leave any other interesting observations in the comments.\n\nReference\n\n[1] https://data.world/cclayford/cricinfo-statsguru-data\n\nOver the years one day international cricket scores have been on the rise and this post intends to look into this in some detail. We shall restrict ourselves to first innings scores where the team batting first lasted exactly 50 overs. Hence games greater than 50 overs per team long or where a team was bowled out prematurely are omitted. There are 2349 (out of 3945) such matches according to this query on Cricinfo Statsguru and on average 7 wickets fall over the 50 overs. The plot below shows a scatter plot of the scores over time. The red curve shows that mean scores were steady around 225 during the 1980s and have been on the rise since 1990 so that now the mean score is approaching 300.\n\nNote that the first data point in 1974 corresponds to a game that was reduced to 50 overs per side after originally intended to be a 55 over game.\n\nIf we slice the data into eras marked by calendar years of roughly equal numbers of games, the mean score had a slight slow-down in the rate of increase from 2008-2012, then accelerated again in the past five years.\n\nEra Number of matches Mean score batting first 1974-1994 427 229 1995-1999 383 247 2000-2003 368 257 2004-2007 380 267 2008-2012 393 272 2013-2017 398 288 1974-2017 2349 260\n\nThe histograms below show how rarely teams score less than 200 runs in recent times when using the full quota of 50 overs. In fact these days a team is more likely to score over 400 than below 200 if using the full quota of 50 overs!\n\nComparing the distribution of first innings winning versus losing scores we find that the mean scores are 275 vs 236 respectively with sample sizes 1392 vs 901 (34 games had no result and 22 were tied). Restricting to the past five years, the median score batting first for the full 50 overs in winning matches is exactly 300.\n\nInterestingly if we break down the runs scatter plot by team, the trends are not the same across the board. In particular England and South Africa have had more dramatic increases in recent times than the other teams, especially compared with India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and West Indies.\n\nRestricting to the last five years (2013-2017), here are the mean first innings scores for each team based on the match result (assuming they bat the full 50 overs).\n\nTeam Result mean score # matches Afghanistan lost 249 6 Afghanistan won 260 12 Australia lost 295 13 Australia n/r 253 3 Australia won 310 31 Bangladesh lost 263 16 Bangladesh won 275 15 Canada lost 230 3 England lost 282 13 England won 329 22 Hong Kong won 283 4 India lost 282 12 India won 310 27 Ireland lost 244 6 Ireland tied 268 1 Ireland won 289 3 Kenya lost 260 1 Netherlands lost 265 1 New Zealand lost 277 12 New Zealand tied 314 1 New Zealand won 308 27 P.N.G. lost 218 2 P.N.G. won 232 1 Pakistan lost 266 9 Pakistan n/r 296 1 Pakistan tied 229 1 Pakistan won 290 20 Scotland lost 238 6 Scotland won 284 8 South Africa lost 258 7 South Africa n/r 301 1 South Africa won 321 36 Sri Lanka lost 249 15 Sri Lanka n/r 268 2 Sri Lanka tied 286 1 Sri Lanka won 305 22 U.A.E. lost 279 3 U.A.E. won 267 3 West Indies lost 265 10 West Indies won 298 10 Zimbabwe lost 247 9 Zimbabwe tied 257 1 Zimbabwe won 276 1\n\nThe England and South Africa numbers stand out the most here in winning causes. Also Australia has a particularly high average score of 294 in losing causes. Sri Lanka has the largest difference (56 runs) between average winning and losing scores.\n\nEdit: The following shows the mean scores in the 100 matches prior to and after key rule changes (still focusing on first innings 50-over scores). Note that in two of the three cases, the average scores reduced.\n\nRestriction of 2 outside the 30-yard circle in the first 15 overs (’92 World Cup)\n\n03 Jan 88 to 20 Jan 92: 231\n\n12 Feb 92 to 16 Feb 94: 222\n\nIntroduction of Powerplay overs\n\n13 Mar 04 to 30 Jun 05: 267\n\n07 Jul 05 to 08 Sep 06: 267\n\nRemoval of powerplay, fifth fielder allowed outside the circle in the last ten overs\n\n17Aug 14 to 24 Jun 15: 301\n\n10 Jul 15 to 19 Jan 17: 289\n\nNovak Djokovic had a stellar tennis record in 2015, winning three out of the four grand slams (runner-up in the other), the ATP World Tour finals for the fifth time, a record six Masters titles and reached 15 consecutive finals (winning 11 of them) in attaining an 82-6 record (31 wins against top 10 players!!) and US$21.6m for the year.\n\nI noticed that all his losses for the year were to players older than him and I looked up his record against younger players. Here is a list of the players younger than Djokovic who have beaten him in his entire ATP career. The month refers to when the associated tournament started.\n\nErnests Gulbis (Jan 2009)\n\nFilip Krajinovic (May 2010 – Djokovic retired after losing the first set)\n\nJuan Martin del Potro (Sep 2011, Jul 2012 and Mar 2013)\n\nKei Nishikori (Oct 2011 and Aug 2014)\n\nSam Querry (Oct 2012)\n\nGrigor Dimitrov (May 2013)\n\nThat’s right, only six players have had this honour for a total of nine losses. After his loss to Dimitrov at the Madrid Masters he has won 71 of his last 72 matches against younger players, losing only to Nishikori in the 2014 US Open semi-finals. He is currently on a 40-match winning streak and to the end of 2015 his record is 130-9 against younger players (career: 686-146). As a comparison here is the record of Murray, Nadal and Federer against younger players not named Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray or Rafael Nadal.\n\nMurray: 118-19\n\nNadal: 177-17 (including 41 in a row from Nov 2009 to the end of 2011)\n\nFederer: 517-61 (the higher numbers show the clear generation gap)\n\nReference\n\nTennis Abstract: ATP and WTA Match Results, Splits, and Analysis\n\nThe past week saw two low scoring test cricket matches between India and South Africa in Nagpur and Australia vs New Zealand in Adelaide. According to this link, only 3 times since the 1930s has a completed test match (i.e. with a result) had no player make 50 in any of the four innings. Here are some other matches since 1980 where the batting average for the match was at most that of the Nagpur test (14.9 runs per wicket). Some of them may ring familiar for cricket fans.\n\nPakistan 131 & 77 lost to West Indies 218 at Lahore, 1986-7 (HS 75 by Greenidge)\n\nNew Zealand 94 & 6/160 def India 99 & 154 at Hamilton, 2002-3 (HS 39 by Dravid)\n\nPakistan 59 & 53 lost to Australia 310 at Sharjah, 2002-3 (HS 119 by Hayden)\n\nWest Indies 187 & 147 def Zimbabwe 236 & 63 at Port of Spain, 1999-2000 (HS 113 by A Flower)\n\nSL 109 & 101 lost to Pakistan 230 at Kandy, 1985-6 (HS 81 by Mudassar Nazar)\n\nIndia 104 & 205 def Australia 203 & 93 at Mumbai, 2004-5 (HS 69 by Laxman)\n\nWest Indies 136 & 1/98 def Australia 128 & 105 at Port of Spain, 1994-5 (HS 63* by S Waugh)\n\nNew Zealand 307 def England 82 & 93 at Christchurch, 1983-4 (HS 99 by Hadlee)\n\nSouth Africa 235 & 259 def India 100 & 66 at Durban, 1996-7 (HS 80 by Hudson)\n\nAlso only 14 times since 1980 has the top score been less than 66 which was the highest score in Adelaide (one other in Australia when McGrath had match figures of 10/27!).\n\nHere are stats highlights from the two matches:\n\nLowest top score in an Adelaide Test Cricket – ESPN Cricinfo\n\nAshwin’s records and lowest top scores Cricket – ESPN Cricinfo"
