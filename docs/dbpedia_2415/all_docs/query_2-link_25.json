And now a group of investors that includes the CEOs of Microsoft and Adobe has raised $120 million to build Major League Cricket in the United States. Here's a breakdown üëá British colonists brought cricket to the United States at the start of the 18th century, and the sport became popular at colleges like Haverford, Penn, Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, and Columbia. But then a quicker, simpler variation of the sport called baseball came along ‚Äî traditional cricket games are played over five days and require a specially prepared pitch ‚Äî and cricket disappeared from the American conversation. Yet, the opposite happened in other parts of the world. For example, there are more than 1 billion cricket fans in India, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. And the sport‚Äôs biggest star, Virat Kohli, has 256 million Instagram followers, which is more followers than LeBron James (155 million), Serena Williams (17 million), Roger Federer (12 million), Shohei Ohtani (6 million), Patrick Mahomes (6 million), and Tiger Woods (3 million) combined. So now Major League Cricket wants to turn that attention into enterprise value. The US-based cricket league has raised $120 million in funding from people like Satya Nadella (Microsoft CEO) and Shantanu Narayen (Adobe CEO). They play a shortened version of cricket called T20, producing more hits and scoring in games that last just three hours. And in addition to stadium renovations in Texas and North Carolina, MLC investor (and Bollywood actor) Shah Rukh Khan is committing funds as part of a $30 million investment to build a 10,000-seat cricket stadium in the Los Angeles area. But most importantly, USA Cricket awarded Major League Cricket the exclusive license to run a professional T20 league in the United States. That means no other entity can set up a professional cricket league in the United States, effectively providing MLC with a monopoly on investment and fan attention for the sport. And the first Major League Cricket season went well. It lasted less than a month, and there were only 18 regular-season games. But every game was sold out, and the shorter season made it so some of the world‚Äôs best players could compete in the league, which enabled Major League Cricket to sign global broadcasting deals in year one. So while there is unquestionably a long way to go before we consider cricket a legitimate player in the American sports landscape, the seeds have been planted. Major League Cricket already has a built-in fanbase of 60 million-plus people in the United States. They have raised more than enough money ($120 million) to fund the operation for several years at a loss. And with the expat community of South Asian and Indian Americans increasing year-over-year, the future looks bright for MLC.

Strategy Wins Matches: Just like in cricket, where teams devise game plans to outsmart their opponents, successful investors craft strategic investment plans tailored to their financial goals. Whether it's asset allocation, diversification, or risk management, a well-thought-out strategy and team is key to winning in both arenas. 2. Patience is a Virtue: In cricket, batsmen patiently wait for the right ball to hit, while investors patiently wait for their investments to mature and yield returns. Both require the discipline to stay focused and composed even during challenging times. 3. Timing is Everything: Whether it's hitting a boundary at the right moment or entering the market when the timing is favorable, timing plays a crucial role in both cricket and investments. 4. Teamwork and Collaboration: While cricket is a team sport, investing can also benefit from collaboration and teamwork. Seeking advice from financial advisors, consulting with investment professionals, and learning from experienced investors can enhance investment outcomes. 5. Celebrating Victories, Learning from Defeats: Just as cricketers celebrate victories and analyze defeats to improve their performance, investors should celebrate successful investments and learn from losses to refine their investment approach.

It‚Äôs the case for a lot of us who grew up in a middle-class family, where one TV was a luxury and our dads wouldn‚Äôt let us change the channels because god forbid he‚Äôd miss one over. üôà While cricket is about nostalgia for a lot of us, what left me perplexed was the low scores this T20 World Cup season. Naturally, the blame fell on the pitches. It dawned on me that this season was unique because the US was co-hosting the season. It made me question how cricket was gaining attention in the States after all these years. Why now? ü§î Podcaster Joe Rogan was shocked to realize that Cricket (played by 108 countries) could have more viewers than Superbowl (played by just the USA) üòì Cricket's resurgence in America seems tied to financial interests, driven by the influx of South Asian immigrants who bring their love for the sport with them. Introducing a sport the immigrants love will only help with higher ticket sales & increased viewers. üí∏ It's suggested that this could potentially expand cricket's appeal significantly. There is some evidence supporting this claim, as the ICC has observed a rise in new users from the US accessing their digital platforms, jumping from 21% in the previous tournament to 61% in the current one. üíπ However: üëÄ All matches in the US were exclusively aired on a cricket-specific subscription channel, which in turn contributed to limited visibility. üëÄ Despite being one of the top-4 media markets for cricket, the absence of major media conglomerates actively promoting the sport leaves cricket's growth to be largely anecdotal in the US, as compared to basketball / baseball. The needle has been moved to some degree, but there seems to be a longer way to go üåÖ üåü Btw I also write biweekly here about similar stuff, subscribe if you'd like :) https://lnkd.in/gsjbNAbt"
