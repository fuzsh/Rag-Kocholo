        "text": "Just when England's beleaguered bowlers thought matters could not get any worse they now have to prepare for Younis Khan, back after knee trouble, in Pakistan's batting line-up at Old Trafford tomorrow.\n\nEngland had a problem or two anyway with Pakistan's middle order at Lord's. The figures of Mohammad Yousuf (202 and 48) and Inzamam-ul-Haq (69 and 56 not out) speak for themselves. It was the same story in Pakistan last winter (averages of 68 & 107 respectively). Surely Younis cannot make things any worse?\n\nOne glance at the ICC rankings for Test batsmen provides the answer. It is no surprise that Inzamam is at No3, Yousuf at No5 and that England's highest representative is Kevin Pietersen at No10. Where the bad news really lies, though, is that Younis is at No7. In his last 11 Tests he averages over 70, with five centuries.\n\nWhen Michael Atherton asked the former Pakistan opener Ramiz Raja during the first Test how England might best dismiss Inzamam and Yousuf, the response of \"run them out\" was not entirely jocular. England did look rather bereft of ideas. Aside from an early bouncer barrage from Steve Harmison to Inzamam - with short leg and leg gully in position - it was not immediately obvious what plans they had in place for these two fine players.\n\nThere might be a couple of reasons for this. First, at present England do not have an attack accurate enough to carry out a plan. Last summer against Australia they did, and Michael Vaughan and Duncan Fletcher were thus able to devise a cornucopia of innovative field placings to suit where the bowlers were instructed to bowl. They would have had the same plans when England travelled down under in 2002-03, but a combination of injuries and scattergun bowling rendered them impotent.\n\nThere is a danger of that becoming the story of this series too. A bowler needs to be able to propel at least five balls an over into the desired area. Three will not do. Waywardness releases pressure and demands field changes, usually defensive. You feel for the captain, Andrew Strauss.\n\nSecond, the natural manner of subcontinent batsmen is to play wristily, square of the wicket. Therefore field placings are more likely to be conventional slips and gullies. You will not see the \"drive men\" placed almost on the cut strip and at extra cover as they were so successfully for Matthew Hayden last summer.\n\nBizarrely, Inzamam was eventually bowled around his legs by Liam Plunkett in the first innings at Lord's. Attempting that again might prove very costly, although Inzamam does move a long way - slowly - across his stumps and may be susceptible to balls darting back into him. But only if the line is correct, starting just outside off stump. Otherwise he will merrily pick off runs through the leg side.\n\nAs for Yousuf, England know an early yorker can pay dividends. James Anderson produced a pearler, swinging away late, in Cape Town during the 2003 World Cup to dismiss him first ball. But that is a dangerous ploy, as Matthew Hoggard discovered in the second innings when his intended yorker became a juicy leg-stump half-volley, the sort batsmen dream of receiving first ball.\n\nIt is England's stated intention that their fielders capture three wickets in every Test match. That is two catches and one run out. Not any old catches, of course, but stunning efforts where the bowler knows the dismissal is solely down to the brilliance of the fielder. England managed one at Lord's - Paul Collingwood's leaping first-innings effort to get rid of Faisal Iqbal. No run outs, though. Pakistan managed two, including that hen's tooth from Inzy to dismiss Ian Bell in the second innings.\n\nInzamam has a reputation for being involved in, rather than effecting, run outs. But the statistics can be misleading: on only six occasions has he been run out in Tests, and one of those was a highly controversial dismissal last winter as he jumped away from a Harmison throw. In one-day internationals it has happened 39 times, second only in his shuffling sloppiness to Sri Lanka's Marvan Atapattu.\n\nIs there any hope, then? Of course there is. Younis averaged only 30, without a fifty, against England last winter, though he missed the third Test because of a bereavement. He had a miserable stay at Nottinghamshire in 2005. He will bat at three and doubtless he will be in early, because Pakistan's openers are about as adhesive (13 combinations in 19 Tests) as the hands of one of their members, Imran Farhat, who is Teflon personified at slip.\n\nBut sadly for England, Younis is Pakistan's most reliable slip catcher and he will be back there when the hosts are at the crease.\n\nPakistan's big three\n\nInzamam-ul-Haq\n\nAge 36\n\nTests (v Eng) 110 (16)\n\nRuns (v Eng) 8,391 (1,477)\n\nAverage (v Eng) 51.79 (61.54)\n\n100s/50s (v Eng) 25/44 (5/10)\n\nHow outs v England b 5, lbw 1, c 15, run out 3, not out 3\n\nWicket taken by Giles 3, Hoggard 3, Mullally 3, Caddick 2, Cork 2, Malcolm 2, Flintoff 1, Munton 1, Plunkett 1, Pringle 1, Salisbury 1, White 1\n\nYounis Khan\n\nAge 28\n\nTests (v Eng) 44 (4)\n\nRuns (v Eng) 3,555 (262)\n\nAverage (v Eng) 48.04 (32.75)\n\n100s/50s (v Eng) 11/14 (0/2)\n\nHow outs v England b 1, lbw 5, c 2, run out 0, not out 0\n\nWicket taken by Cork 3, Flintoff 2, Hoggard 2, Harmison 1\n\nMohammad Yousuf\n\nAge 31\n\nTests (v Eng) 67 (9)\n\nRuns (v Eng) 5,356 (1,019)\n\nAverage (v Eng) 52.00 (67.93)\n\n100s/50s (v Eng) 17/25 (4/2)\n\nHow outs v England b 2, lbw 2, c 11, run out 0, not out 0"
