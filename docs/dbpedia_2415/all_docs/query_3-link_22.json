        "text": "The West Indies’ first-ever victory in the Cricket World Cup in 1975 marked the beginning of the rise of the One-day format. Over the years, the game has gone through significant changes.\n\nAt first, matches were played with a red ball and each team had 60 overs for their innings. But things changed when the white ball was introduced, reducing the overs to 50 per team. This shift also brought about a change in the teams’ clothing, as they started wearing colorful uniforms starting from the 1992 World Cup.\n\nThis transformation was accompanied by the introduction of game-changing rules like power plays and the use of two new balls per innings. These changes led to a revolutionary shift in the landscape of ODI cricket.\n\nTop ODI cricket batters with the most runs\n\nOver the years, cricket enthusiasts have witnessed the emergence of several remarkable batsmen, such as Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli. Each era has added its own brilliance to the game. As cricket continues to evolve, new players will naturally step up to make their mark in the 50-over format. Amid these changes, a special group has spearheaded the game’s advancement across time. This brings us to an intriguing question: Who truly belongs among the greatest ODI batsmen of all time? Below, you’ll find a compilation of the 10 finest ODI batters ever.\n\n1) Sachin Tendulkar\n\nSachin Tendulkar, famously known as the “Master Blaster,” sits at the pinnacle of ODI run records, holding an astonishing tally of 18,426 runs.

He hammered a total of 2016 fours and 195 sixes, achieving a personal best of 200*, which stands as the inaugural double century in ODI history.\n\nHowever, Tendulkar’s influence extends far beyond mere statistics. He played a pivotal role in propelling India’s dominance in white-ball cricket during the 1990s and was the trailblazer to cross the 10,000 ODI run milestone.
