        "text": "Being thwarted by the world's great cricketers is nothing new for Bangladesh. The nine years since it became the 10th test cricket-playing nation have seen it lose five-day tests that it should have won because of the batting of Inzamam ul-Haq of Pakistan and Ricky Ponting of Australia and the all-around skills of Daniel Vettori of New Zealand.\n\nNor is it too surprising when any team leaves the field defeated by Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka, the most prodigious wicket taker in test history. That, though, is Muralitharan the bowler. Bangladesh's peculiar fate in a one-day international in Mirpur on Friday was to be beaten by Muralitharan the batsman.\n\nVictory looked certain for Bangladesh when its own spin star, Shakib al-Hasan took two wickets in Sri Lanka's 44th over of a 50-over-a-side match. Only two wickets remained. Sri Lanka, chasing 153 to win, had scored only 114.\n\nVictory might reasonably have been claimed as the greatest day in Bangladesh's cricket history. This was a final, admittedly only of a triangular tournament whose other competitor was Zimbabwe, but still a match with a trophy at stake.\n\nStill more important was that Bangladesh had qualified by beating Sri Lanka two days earlier. Its single victory in five-day tests was against the depleted Zimbabwe. Its one-day victories over Australia, Pakistan, India and South Africa have been spectacular one-offs - impressive, but possibly fluky. To beat the same highly rated opponent twice in a row could not be dismissed in the same way.\n\nEnter Muralitharan. He always entertains as a batsman, slugging away cheerfully. His previous record, though, in one-day internationals does not lie. This was his 321st. His highest score in those 320 matches was 27 and his average number of runs per dismissal was six.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
