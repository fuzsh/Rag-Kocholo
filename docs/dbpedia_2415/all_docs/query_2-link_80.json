        "text": "One is probably Pakistan’s greatest captain who out of a sense of duty put off retirement to lead his team on this difficult tour. The other is their highest ever run scorer, a man once banned for life by the Pakistan Cricket Board and carries feeling of injustice that his talents never been fully appreciated.\n\nBut these two very different men, Misbah ul-Haq and Younis Khan, carry the hopes of their nation on this tour. With a combined age of 80, this pair of great survivors face their toughest challenge. Beating England in England would be their greatest achievement and it is impossible to envisage that happening without big scores from these two, regardless of the skills of their fine bowlers. Sri Lanka won here against the odds two years ago thanks in a large part to the experience and talents of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene. Without them this summer they were thumped. Misbah and Younis have become Pakistan’s Kumar and Mahela.\n\nBut a lack of runs over the next month and a failure to cope with the swinging ball will probably be the end and bring calls back home to pension off the these two old timers.\n\nMisbah’s legacy is secure, regardless of the result here. By the end of this series he will be the oldest captain in Test cricket (42 years, 79 days) since Bobby Simpson in the 1970s. He has won more Test matches, 20 from 42 games, than any other Pakistani captain but his feats go beyond mere statistics. He gathered up the shattered pieces of Pakistani cricket after the tragedy of the terrorist attack in Lahore that turned his country into cricket’s no-go zone, and rebuilt the team after the scandals of the Lord’s spot-fix six years ago.\n\nHe did it by building a new team. Gone is the selectorial madness that blighted Pakistan in the past. Shan Masood, the opener, is the only player in the top six at Lord’s today to have not played at least 40 Tests. He also sets the example with his batting and calm mental approach. Misbah averages 56.68 as captain, and only three men have scored more runs after the age of 40.\n\nImran Khan and Javed Miandad, other great Pakistan leaders, could be emotional and lambast their team. But there is a detachment about Misbah. He is measured in his speech and understands personalities as a result of his academic prowess and MBA in human resources.\n\nThis has perhaps been best put to use with the careful handling of PCB politics and keeping Younis happy, which has engendered a mutual respect between the two men from which the team has benefitted. There has been only one hiccup when Younis reacted badly in a television interview to being compared to Misbah as a batsman. “Don't compare me to Misbah-ul-Haq. I've been playing cricket for a long time. But I have big performances, a lot of them, everywhere.” Misbah shrugged it off.\n\nNeither man was on the last tour in 2010. Misbah was seen to be past it and his time had gone as a player. Younis had been banned for life after one of his many run-ins with officialdom. The PCB accused him of “infighting which … brought down the whole team”.\n\nYounis returned for Pakistan first Test series after the scandal with Misbah appointed captain and immediately scored a hundred. Younis is a man with defiance written in to his DNA. “We've seen days when there is no food at home and that acts as motivation. We've got that toughness so that we get life bans, cricket is finished, guys are out four, five years and suddenly return and perform. It is amazing,” he said.\n\nSince Misbah’s appointment Younis has averaged 60.25 and missed only one Test, his longest consistent run in the team. Misbah describes Younis as the “crucial factor” and other players follow his lead, especially on this tour. He has played for five counties and in 32 first-class matches in England averaging 46.75. He started the tour with a hundred at Somerset.\n\nWhen asked after that innings what victory here would mean to him he replied: “It would make me the happy man of the earth.”\n\nHe is unorthodox. Younis's bottom-handed front-of-the-pad technique leaves him relying on his 38 year-old eyes and he lacks a second line of defence. If the ball is moving laterally he will be very vulnerable. But he does not care what others think. ”I don't want to be Inzamam, I don't want to be Miandad, I don't want to be Imran,” he once said. “I want to be Younis Khan. Whatever my style is, however I am, I want to stick to it. What I am, I am.”\n\nMisbah too will change little. It is too late. He hammers spinners (just ask Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid) but this is not the UAE. It is hard to see how he will score off four seamers and because this series will not be played in the furnace heat of the Gulf, Alastair Cook will be able to rotate his quicks much easier. You can bet Misbah will not see much spin.\n\n“I really have to take initiative and come here as captain and batsman also to face this challenge,” he said. “I decided I need to be here in a tough series for Pakistan.”\n\nIt will be tough but with Misbah and Younis there is hope of one final grand farewell."
