        "text": "When new chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq recently announced the list of possible candidates for the all-important series against England, the names of Shahid Afridi and Umar Akmal were amongst the most notable exclusions.\n\nThe former Pakistan Twenty20 captain may well have played his last international game when he unsuccessfully led the side against Australia at the World T20 in India, discarded by the selectors in favour of “younger” players. The reality may, however, be entirely different.\n\nMeanwhile, Umar Akmal seems to have pushed the limits of tolerance of Pakistan’s administrators with his disciplinary issues and duly paid the price for his various misdemeanours by being overlooked forAbbottabad.\n\nOut of favour with the Pakistan selectors and with an uncertain future for various reasons, both players are understandably aiming to further their professional life while looking for more financial opportunities in Twenty20 leagues around the world.\n\nFor now, that has seen the pair land in England alongside another familiar face far more in favour with the PCB.\n\nCAN ‘BOOM BOOM’ BOUNCE BACK?\n\nIn Afridi’s case, his stated goals for playing in such leagues are to improve his fitness and form, with a view to staying relevant for selection in future Pakistan squads. While that aim may not ultimately prove fruitful given the strength of feeling against his position in the side, Afridi’s appearance for yet another year in the Natwest T20 Blast tournament – this time for Hampshire – does point to his popularity with county sides.\n\nWith Northamptonshire last year the all-rounder finished up with the second best batting average (34.5) and the best bowling economy rate (6.44) for his side. He only appeared eight times for Northamptonshire in 2015, but still took 3-14 in the final as Northants lost to Lancashire.\n\nIf his previous records are any indication, perennial crowd favourite ‘Boom Boom’ could yet influence the opinions of the Pakistan selectors if he impresses on the South Coast.\n\nAKMAL OFF TO A FLIER\n\nIn contrast to Shahid Afridi, whose career is in its twilight years, Akmal should have a long career to look forward to. The ‘unfulfilled talent’ label can only take him so far in international cricket and with Inzamam flexing his muscles to establish some order among the national team, Akmal will find it difficult to retain his position in the national setup.\n\nConfined to just the Twenty20 format in the past few years due to questions about his temperament, the 26-year-old batsman will be looking at this summer in England as the perfect way to answer his critics. He is back at Leicestershire, where in 2015 he ended up with the team’s highest average, and has already started with a flourish – an opening knock of 56 off 32 deliveries hopefully a sign of things to come.\n\nAkmal knows his performances will be studied in minute detail by Pakistan selectors and though he may not be on their list for immediate selection, a return to the international side based upon his performances in England could be just a phone call away.\n\nIf the fortunes of the current Sri Lanka side are any indicators, it is quite possible that Pakistan will highly value any runs made in English conditions, which would be welcome news for Umar if he were to build on his solid start.\n\nRIAZ TARGETS FAMILIARITY\n\nThere is a more optimistic outlook for for Wahab Riaz, whose reputation as Pakistan’s fast-bowling ‘enforcer’ has been enhanced a great deal since his confrontation with Shane Watson at the 2015 50-over World Cup.\n\nAlthough his Twenty20 credentials are questionable, he was included in the list of players who will be considered for the upcoming tour of England – but opted to depart early for a seven-match stint with Essex in the Natwest T20 Blast.\n\nWahab is very much an integral part of the Pakistan setup and his outing with Essex is a fantastic opportunity to get used to English conditions and bowling with the Duke ball. If he is able to adapt quickly then Wahab could provide extra bite to the Pakistan bowling attack which will need to be at its best in the UK.\n\nHowever, if Wahab’s first outing with Essex is any guide, then he and Pakistan have some work ahead. Facing Surrey in the T20 Blast, Wahab ended up with a solitary wicket for 40 runs in his four overs, not the best of returns to say the least."
