        "text": "Desmond Leo Haynes of Barbados scored 7,487 Test runs at an average of a tick over 42 for the West Indies. He also managed an impressive eighteen centuries.\n\nAn opening batsman of combative flair, virtually the entirety of Desmond Haynes’ career coincided with the golden era of West Indian cricket. The compact right-handed opening partnership of Desmond Haynes and Gordon Greenidge was a consistent feature in the near immortal 1980s lineup.\n\nHaynes was on the losing side in just one Test series, and didn’t quite make it to the 1995 series at home to Australia, which is widely acknowledged as the moment of the torch finally being handed over. He retiring during the previous spring at the end of a series against England.\n\nCriticism of Haynes:\n\nDespite all those runs and all those hundreds, Desmond Haynes is frequently given a “home bully” label; implying he only performed in the Caribbean.\n\nThis derogatory term is used in a manner that suggests it is definitive of his career and the bottom line. As though the accomplishments should be overshadowed, even ignored almost. That he should essentially not just be given home bully status, but be reduced to home bully status.\n\nThe term also hints that he was a scorer of soft runs and could only prosper when circumstances were in his favour.\n\nThis stat may surprise a few…\n\nInnings in which the player has scored at least a third of the team’s runs in a situation where the team are all out, have just chased a winning total, or declare with the tail exposed:\n\nGreenidge 9\n\nHaynes 9\n\nIf we take a quick look at the immediate surface of Desmond Haynes’ resume, there is plausibly some truth to the home bully accusation.\n\nHaynes averaged a robust 56 at home. But a modest 33.50 overseas. In 38% of his innings at home, he made at least 50 runs. He repeated this feat in 21% of his overseas innings, just over half as much.\n\nLooking a little deeper, the highest Haynes managed to push his away average up to (min. 20 test sample) was 35.44 in 1990. Thus, it’s not as though he suffered a major overseas average hit at the end. And of course, Haynes never had to face his own bowlers, who formulated the finest bowling attack in world cricket (arguably the finest ever in fact) throughout his career; a key factor in the West Indies near unparalleled success in the 1980s.\n\nWas Haynes really that bad away from home though?\n\nDesmond Haynes’ away average of 33.50 looks decidedly underwhelming at first glance. If this is the only piece of data you look at, you would be forgiven for assuming he was a below average batsman away from home.\n\nYou would be forgiven for assuming the home specialist allegations are correct, and that his reputation with many observers as one of the great opening batsmen is dubious.\n\nHowever, isolating an away average can be overly simplistic and lacks contextual awareness. Not least for a cricketer with a very long career like Desmond Haynes. His final away Test came in December 1993. His first away Test came fourteen years earlier. It is true that his away average didn’t suffer a major hit from longevity, but nevertheless, the longer you play, the harder it generally is to sustain solid figures.\n\nBatting longevity can be assisted by a frequent suppliance of flat tracks and modest bowling attacks. Hence a lot of batsmen who featured in the 2000s, the most batsman-friendly period of the post-war era, retired comfortably in their late-30s (Kumar Sangakkara, Younis Khan, Matthew Hayden, Inzamam-Ul-Haq etc). Haynes however generally faced strong bowling attacks towards the end of his career, both home and overseas. Longevity is a prickly challenge for an opener too; facing fresh fast bowling with the new ball as a player with fading reflexes is a big test of technique, resilience and strategy.\n\nFurthermore, a batsman can average less than another batsman away from home overall, but with superior overseas performances and credentials.\n\nFor example, Haynes has attracted comparisons to the recently retired Australian opener, David Warner.\n\nAt home, Warner averaged 2 runs more. Overseas, Haynes averaged a single run more.\n\nBut while Warner’s legacy in Test cricket was a little over criticised following the ill-fated 2019 Ashes when he hardly scored a run all summer, I think Desmond Haynes was a significantly better Test bat than David Warner and certainly superior on the road.\n\nLooking deeply into Desmond Haynes’ away record, the only country where he was completely ineffective was India.\n\nIn Australia, Haynes averaged only 32. But he enjoyed an outstanding tour in 1988/89; something his more celebrated opening partner, Gordon Greenidge, never quite managed. Haynes bludgeoned a ton on a typically fast but also deteriorating Perth track that was supportive enough for Merv Hughes, the no-nonsense fast bowler from Victoria, to claim 8/78.\n\nHaynes then went and displayed some versatility when he conjured up scores of 75 and 143 in the 4th test on a Sydney wicket that was so friendly to spin bowling, Allan Border, considerably more known for his rugged left-handed batting, took 11 wickets in the match. Haynes was the West Indies’ top scorer in both innings. The Barbadian opener also looked destined to complete a third century of the series in Adelaide, before being unfortunately run out for 83.\n\nIt’s also necessary context that Desmond Haynes’ first two Test series in Australia (respective averages of 28 and 21) were brutal assignments for a young cricketer looking to establish himself in the Test game. Opening the batting against the likes of Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Rodney Hogg and Terry Alderman on some spicy and characteristically fast Australian tracks.\n\nMore likely to receive unplayable deliveries than the middle order, opening batters will always have plenty of low-scoring series’ and these are forgivable examples.\n\nSunil Gavaskar is almost unanimously regarded as the greatest opening batsman of the past 50 years; and even he had nine series’ where he averaged 30 or less. To average 60 across a long series in Australia as an opener (Haynes’ feat in 88/89) shouldn’t be ignored because of a mediocre overall average there. It shouldn’t be the only thing recognised when a player has four tours of a country either, but it should gain recognition.\n\nThis isn’t to compare Gavaskar to Haynes. Gavaskar was the better player. But Sunny’s batch of lean troughs highlights the likelihood of volatility that opening the batting brings.\n\nThe number of times some high-quality opening batters post-1970 averaged 30 or less in a series (min. two tests):\n\nGraeme Smith 15\n\nAlastair Cook 13\n\nVirender Sehwag 12\n\nMichael Atherton 10\n\nDesmond Haynes 10\n\nSunil Gavaskar 9\n\nGraham Gooch 8\n\nGordon Greenidge 6\n\nGeoffrey Boycott 6\n\nGary Kirsten 6\n\nMichael Slater 6\n\nReturning to Haynes’ output country by country, in Pakistan, he averaged just 28. But he played two world class knocks there.\n\nDesmond almost single-handedly rescued his men from series defeat in Karachi (1986). Abdul Qadir’s mercurial leg spin got rid of the rest of the top 4 (the considerably esteemed trio of Gordon Greenidge, Vivian Richards and Richie Richardson). The wizard-like pace great Imran Khan then followed up with a vintage spell of reverse swing (6/46).\n\nIn amongst all the commotion, Haynes stood tall and his 88*, coupled with the time he removed (288 balls faced), salvaged a series draw and kept West Indies’ unbeaten run going. The second highest score from a teammate was 32 from Richardson.\n\nAnd if you think that was good, what about Haynes’ hundred on the same ground four years later when no other West Indian made more than 26? Whilst prime Waqar Younis swept through like a knife through butter for 5/73, the battle-hardened Haynes managed 117 tough runs before he was eventually pinned LBW by the equally formidable Wasim Akram who claimed 3/61.\n\nHaynes put together a similar performance a decade earlier in Dunedin, New Zealand. 55 out of a team total of 140 followed by 105 out of a team total of 212 in a tight, controversial and very low-scoring game. This was one of three hundreds orchestrated by Desmond Haynes against the legendary Richard Hadlee in his prime in the latter’s home country; finishing with an average of 45 in Kiwi territory.\n\nHaynes also managed an average north of 40 in England (31 innings sample). While his team tended to have the measure over the English during the 80s and 90s, it is still a place of notorious difficulty for opening batters.\n\nA 24-year-old Haynes made 184 at Lords against Bob Willis, Ian Botham and Derek Underwood on his first England tour in 1980. It would prove to be his highest ever Test score. He had already stamped his mark earlier in the series, top-scoring with 62 in a nervy but successful chase of 209 when the marauding Willis claimed 5/65.\n\nHe had a lean series on the second England tour four years later until the fifth and final Test. The match was in the balance going into the third innings, an unusual situation for that summer. West Indies had a slender 28-run lead. Haynes gritted his teeth and dug out 125, playing the decisive role in handing England a near-impossible chase and thus completing ‘blackwash’. 5–0.\n\nHe managed an average of 46 in a low-scoring series in 1991; having been a consistent contributor on the 1988 England tour also. He scored a half century in three of the four tests in 88’, and a half century in three of the five tests in 91’.\n\nThese are not the performances of a player that should be resigned to a tag with insular connotations. They are performances that convey a high-class test match batter.\n\nThe true definition of a home bully is someone who hardly ever scores tough runs away from home; only managing it when in great form or at the pinnacle of their powers. Haynes frequently scored impressive runs overseas. He couldn’t do it consistently, which is why he wasn’t quite as good as Greenidge, but he proved himself on many an occasion young and old. And as noted before, opening the batting does make consistency more difficult.\n\nHaynes’ solid returns in England and New Zealand are testament to his ability against swing and seam bowling. He had a solid technique; emerging from the school of compact back and across batsmen. Comparable in style to the likes of Richie Richardson, Alec Stewart and Michael Slater. His footwork was quick, but very controlled and precise which is the ideal combination. Comfortable on both feet, he played straight when required and was very adept at the horizontal shots which he played with elegant disdain. His shifts of weight against pace were measured and absolute. He had some footwork problems adjusting against spin in the early days, but improved as his career progressed. Haynes’ attributes were that of a sturdy player against lateral movement with a technique that allowed him to defend and attack efficiently.\n\nThis is why I disagree with the Warner comparison; as Warner struggled almost unrelentingly throughout his career in swinging & seaming conditions which is the litmus test for an opening bat. Getting past the new ball phase, when lateral movement is at its most excessive, is what you trust someone to do when you select them to open the batting.\n\nBesides, do we undervalue tough runs at home?\n\nLike Mahela Jayawardene, the graceful and compact rank turner master from Colombo, Desmond Haynes suffers from a classic tendency in cricket to focus on away records and ignore accomplishments at home.\n\nJayawardene’s extraordinary record in Sri Lanka and Galle (the most spin-friendly track in international cricket) is often overlooked because of his relatively mediocre record outside the subcontinent (average of 32.75).\n\nHe was a tremendous player of spin, averaging a mammoth 70 at Galle. Of all Asian Test venues to host 25+ Tests, only two have sub-30 collective batting averages (Galle and Wankhede). Jayawardene even excelled at home to South African pace attacks. Mahela’s problem was the extra lateral movement outside Asia. He was not exclusively a flat track bully despite frequently receiving this label.\n\nDesmond Haynes averaged more than Gordon Greenidge, Clive Lloyd and Vivian Richards at home. Those are three household names. One of them is almost universally acknowledged as a top 10 test batsman to ever play the game. The other two are considered by many to be knocking on the door of all-time-great status if they aren’t there anyway.\n\nHaynes had twelve Test series at home and was prolific in all but two of them. One was the final series of his career. The other came in 1987 when the high-quality duo of Imran Khan and Wasim Akram ran riot in a series Pakistan were somewhat unfortunate not to win.\n\nIncidentally, Haynes managed to get his own back on Pakistan a few years later, making 143* at Trinidad and 120 at Barbados; both of which came against prime Wasim and Waqar; eighteen months after that special performance in Karachi. Both were important hundreds too. Port-of-Spain was often a dicey surface in the 90s and it proved too tough for both outfits in their respective first innings, as the Windies made 127 and Pakistan could only manage 140 in reply. Desmond proceeded to produce a champion innings of 143*, one of three times he carried his bat during his career (still a joint record in Test cricket), guiding the men from the Caribbean to a comfortable victory. Pakistan’s fourth innings score of 165 would suggest that the pitch didn’t particularly flatten out.\n\nThis ruthlessness was a theme whenever Haynes was batting in the Caribbean. He averaged north of 50 against each of the regular opponents at home. The Australians were brutally punished in 1984 (series average of 94) and they copped some again in 1991 (series average of 52). England didn’t have much success in their attempts to tame him in 1981, 1986 or 1990. Haynes joined Greenidge for a monstrous 296-run opening stand in Antigua in 1983 against India, and the former took control of a fourth innings chase on his home ground (Kensington Oval) at the expense of the same opposition six years later.\n\nOverall, I believe Desmond Haynes’ status as a legendary opening batter is richly deserved and an increase in recognition would be justified. He was exceptional at home, very serviceable away, and a long-serving pillar in a great team."
