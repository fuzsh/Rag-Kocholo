        "text": "CK Nayadu’s 153 (11 sixes included) vs the MCC in 1926, Lala Amarnath’s (and India’s) first test century vs England in 1933, Vijay Hazare’s scoring twin hundreds (145 & 116) vs Australia in 1948, Vinoo Mankad and Pankaj Roy’s 413 run opening stand vs New Zealand in 1956, Subhash Gupte’s (google who he is) 9-102 vs West Indies in 1959, Sunil Gavaskar’s aggregate 774 runs vs West Indies in 1971, Series wins in West Indies and England in 1971, India’s first win on Australian soil in 1977, Sunil Gavaskar crossing 10,000 test runs in 1987, Kapil Dev’s 432nd wicket in 1994, Anil Kumble’s 10-74 in 1999, VVS Laxman’s 281 in 2001, Rahul Dravid’s 233 in 2003/04, Sachin Tendulkar’s 35th test century in 2005, Anil Kumble’s 600th test wicket in 2008, Sachin Tendulkar crossing the 15,000 run mark in 2014.\n\nIndian cricket’s faithful servants have conjured moments which have gone down in its history as path breaking, awe inspiring, and jaw dropping achievements. On the occasion of India playing its 500th test match, it is apt to have a look at how have its fortunes played out in the 84 years that India has been at the international stage.\n\nThe Lord’s in England played host to India’s first ever test match on June 25, 1932 vs England, a match India lost by 158 runs. It took India 20 years from this date, to register its first ever test win (vs England, 1952) and 36 years to register its first ever overseas series win (New Zealand, 1967/68).\n\nWhile India’s domestic competitions were marked by insane run making feats/competitions (Vijay Merchant vs Vijay Hazare being the most prominent), things were a lot different on the international stage where not until the 1983 world cup triumph did India started to weigh itself favorably against all opposition and dispel the oft quoted joke that its batsmen had to be reminded that test matches were not timeless (justifiably so, India’s batsmen scored at 2.40 runs per over up until 1971, better only than Pakistan and New Zealand).\n\nOf the 499 test matches that India has played so far, it has won 129, lost 157, drawn 212 and tied 1. India’s W/L ratio of 0.822 fifth worst in Test history (even below Sri Lanka). While this paints a fairly ordinary picture, it’s important to consider that of the 10 Indian cricketers who have played 100 test matches or more, 7 made their debut after 1989. The emergence of such prolific crop of cricketers has helped considerably improve the performance stats of Indian cricket since then, it’s W/ ratio has been the third best since both the 1990s and the 2000s, after Australia and South Africa respectively. Also, india has won 86 out of its 129 victories from 1990 onwards.\n\nDecade Matches Won Lost Tied Drawn W/L Ratio 1930s 7 0 5 0 2 0.000 1940s 13 0 6 0 7 0.000 1950s 44 6 17 0 21 0.353 1960s 52 9 21 0 22 0.429 1970s 64 17 19 0 28 0.895 1980s 81 11 21 1 48 0.524 1990s 69 18 20 0 31 0.900 2000s 103 40 27 0 36 1.481 2010s 66 28 21 0 17 1.333 Total 499 129 157 1 212 0.822\n\nTable 1: Decade wise Performance Summary\n\nLooking at India’s performance on a decade wise basis provides interesting insight into its performance over the years. Perhaps the most intriguing stat is India’s low W/L ratio in the 1990s, a decade which saw it emerging as the most formidable team to beat at home, but what offsets India’s unbelievable W/L ratio at home (3.4) is its dismal performance in away games (W.L Ratio: 0.07). Beginning form 2000 onwards was the most fulfilling period of Indian cricket when, under Saurav Ganguly’s captaincy, India began to dominate world cricket on the back of both its performance and commerce. The 2000s have also been the only decade where India’s overseas W/L ratio has been greater than or equal to 1.\n\nDecade 1930s 1940s 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s Played 3 5 25 36 34 42 30 47 26 Won 0 0 6 6 11 8 17 21 18 Lost 2 1 8 8 7 9 5 8 3 Drawn 1 4 11 22 16 24 8 18 5 W/L Ratio 0.00 0.00 0.75 0.75 1.57 0.89 3.40 2.63 6.00\n\nTable 2: Performance Summary (Home Matches)\n\nIndia’s subsequent decline in away performances from 2010 onwards is not a typically Indian trait, only 2 teams have had a W/L ratio of more than 1 during this period. Also, the W/L ratio in away matches in the ongoing decade for major test playing nations (excl. Zim and Ban) is .648, which the third worst for any decade after 1990s and 1980s. Filtering the period in consideration to start from 2013, the ratio plummets to.0.421, providing further fuel to the debate on doctoring pitches to gain an undue home advantage.\n\nDecade 1930s 1940s 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s Played 4 8 19 16 30 39 39 56 40 Won 0 0 0 3 6 3 1 19 10 Lost 3 5 9 13 12 12 15 19 18 Drawn 1 3 10 0 12 24 23 18 12 W/L Ratio 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.23 0.50 0.25 0.07 1.00 0.56\n\nTable 3: Performance Summary (Away Matches)\n\nIn any case, what has been the defining feature of India’s performance overall is the gap between its performances at home and abroad, which was the narrowest in the ‘Ganguly Era’ (2000s). That was a decade when India registered match and series wins in Australia, England, West Indies, Pakistan and New Zealand. In fact, had the Sydney fiasco taken a different turn, the decade would have gone by as one where India didn’t lose any rubber outside of the sub-continent (Except New Zealand, 2002/03 and Pakistan 2006), the only such instant in its history.\n\nThis was also a decade where India’s famous batting line up was in its full bloom, and the results showed in the form of India registering scores of 400 plus more often than it did during any other decade (26% of total innings). Easier wickets and better batsmen offer part of the explanation for this number, but there can be no debate around the fact that the 2000s was a decade India achieved the most satisfying results across all performance indicators.\n\nDecade 1930s 1940s 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s Total Innings (Away) 8 15 37 32 56 68 66 100 75 400+ scores 0 0 2 2 9 9 13 26 16 % 0% 0% 5% 6% 16% 13% 20% 26% 21%\n\nTable 4: 400+ innings score frequency.\n\nAt least uptil the emergence of Sunil Gavaskar, India’s chances in a match relied more on the wicket-taking ability of its famous spin quartet than on the run making ability of its Batsmen. This trend has seen a stunning reversal especially post the 1990s (as the table above indicates), and since then the dependability has been reversed.\n\nNevertheless, as most of you would agree, India has produced lesser number of ‘great’ bowlers than its rivals in international cricket (bar New Zealand, Sri Lanka), which is one of the reasons why India has not been able to win overseas on a consistent basis. Fancy this, amongst all Indian bowlers to have taken 200 test wickets, no bowler averages lower than Bishen Bedi’s 28.71. This is the highest (worst, that is!) average amongst all test playing nations, all of which have at least one bowler with an average of less than 23.\n\nTeam Bowler Average India Bishen Bedi 28.71 South Africa Dale Steyn 22.24 Australia Glenn Mcgrath 21.64 West Indies Malcolm Marshall 20.94 Sri Lanka Muttiah Muralitharan 22.72 England Fred Trueman 21.57 New Zealand Richard Hadlee 22.29 Zimbabwe Heath Streak 28.14 Pakistan Imran Khan 22.81\n\nTable 5: Lowest Averaging Bowlers\n\nOne way to ascertain the extent of this dependability is to look at how better/worse off the batting and bowling averages been when compared to the overall averages in the said period. Taking a decade wise look at this trend just goes to prove the hypothesis stated above. There has only been one decade (1990s) where Indian bowlers conceded lesser number of runs than the average yield in that decade. Batting, on the other hand, has seen a tremendous reversal, from scoring terribly less than other batsmen in the 1930s (29%), Indian batsmen have gone ahead of the curve in the 1990s and 2000s. The number for the 2010s presents a challenge, as replacements for India’s retired stellar batsmen look to find their mark.\n\nDecade 1930s 1940s 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s Overall 32.15 35.34 28.54 32.10 31.90 32.09 33.75 34.10 31.51 India 38.40 46.67 35.09 34.14 33.40 36.39 33.46 34.98 34.32 Factor 19% 32% 23% 6% 5% 13% -1% 3% 9%\n\nTable 6: Decade wise bowling efficacy\n\nDecade 1930s 1940s 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s Overall 31.12 34.26 27.38 30.81 30.76 30.45 29.45 32.02 32.30 India 22.04 24.66 26.45 28.06 30.05 32.13 33.10 35.98 33.03 Factor -29% -28% -3% -9% -2% 6% 12% 12% 2%\n\nTable 7: Decade wise Batting efficacy.\n\nIf your average cricket fan is asked to name three of the greatest cricketers that India has produced over the years, the most probable names would be: Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and Sachin Tendulkar. Although Rahul Dravid might replace Gavaskar for the recently born follower, the question is unlikely to bring out any other names beyond these four people.\n\nWithout ever contesting he stature of the players named above, one should also concede that there have been many who have contributed significantly to India’s performances over the years. We shall now take a decade wise look at the most prolific and the most pivotal players in each of them.\n\nFor this exercise, I have followed a very simple arithmetic:\n\nMentioned the most prolific batsman/bowler in a said decade.\n\nCalculate a prolificacy factor, arrived at by dividing his total runs by the number of runs of the next best.\n\nCalculate an efficacy factor, by dividing the average of the most prolific batsman/bowler by the next best.\n\nIn case some other cricketer has a better batting/bowling average (considering a suitable cut-off), that average is considered as the benchmark.\n\nMultiply both the factors to arrive at an overall ‘Value Factor’.\n\nA similar arithmetic has been followed to calculate the value factor for performance in wins, to give a balanced/alternate view of performance value.\n\nHigher the value factor for a player during any decade would mean that the team’s fortunes depended more on his shoulders than anyone else. A high value factor would likely have an adverse effect on the team’s W/L ratio (though it hasn’t been tested).\n\nThe table brings out names that won’t surprise many, those who follow the game would have known that Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar’s name to come up as the most prolific batsmen in their respective decades. What the table demonstrated is the extent to which, these batsmen were better than the next best. From the 1940s onwards, Vijay Hazare, with a factor of 1.58, has been the most prolific batsmen in any decade, followed by Sachin Tendulkar (1.55-1990s) and Sunil Gavaskar (1.22-1970s). Sachin Tendulkar’s score seems all the more remarkable because more players than ever were having an extended run. Rahul Dravid’s factor is also remarkable given the talent around in that decade, and his ability to outshine them is a testament to his value and genius.\n\nDecade Player Name Mtchs Runs Avg Following Batsman Runs Best/Next Best Average Avg Prolificacy Factor Efficacy Factor Value Factor 1930s V.Merchant 6 460 38.33 CK Nayadu 350 D.Hussain 42.33 1.31 0.91 1.19 1940s V.Hazare 13 1095 49.77 R.

His factor of 2.17 is followed by Anil Kumble (1.75-1990s) and Erapalli Prasanna (1.38-1960s). India’s low W/L ratio during the 1980s and 1960s (0.524 and 0.429) is a likely outcome of it’s over dependence on one star performer.\n\nDecade Player Name Mtchs Wkts Ave Following Bowler Wkts Bowler Avg Wkts Factor Ave Factor Overall Factor 1930s Amar Singh 7 28 30.64 M.Nisar 25 M.Nisar 28.25 1.12 0.92 1.03 1940s V.Mankad 13 40 41.65 L.Amarnath 29 D.Phadkar 30.22 1.38 0.73 1.00 1950s S.Gupte 31 134 29.13 V.Mankad 122 G.Ahmed 28.18 1.10 0.97 1.06 1960s E.Prasanna 22 113 27.05 B.Nandkarni 76 S.V’Raghavan 25.17 1.49 0.93 1.38 1970s B.Bedi 48 196 29.79 B.C’Shekhar 180 Kapil Dev 27.73 1.09 0.93 1.01 1980s Kapil Dev 80 272 29.54 R.Shastri 141 R.Binny 33.28 1.93 1.13 2.17 1990s A.Kumble 58 264 27.81 J.Srinath 162 V.Raju 29.79 1.63 1.07 1.75 2000s A.Kumble 74 355 31.03 H.Singh 322 H.Singh 30.31 1.10 0.98 1.08 2010s R Ashwin 36 193 25.20 I.Sharma 155 R.Jadeja 23.71 1.25 0.94 1.17\n\nTable 9: Bowler Value (All Matches)\n\nThe table for wins has some interesting names topping their decades as the most valuable match-winners. Vinoo Mankad replaces Polly Umrigar has the most vital match winner of the 1950s, Umrigar, in turn replaces Chandu Borde as the match winner of the ‘60s. Gundappa Vishwanath replaces Sunil Gavaskar in the 1970s, and Cheteshwar Pujara replaces Virat Kohli in the 2010s.\n\nNone of Gundappa Viswanath’s 14 test centuries were in a losing cause, his replacing Gavaskar shouldn’t be any surprise to those who know this fact. There is a strong case for Dilip Vengsarkar to be counted in the same breath as Gavaskar as well since it was solely on his back that India was winning matches in the 1980s (2.65), briefly during which he was also the most prolific batsman in the world. Sachin Tendulkar had the company of Mohammad Azharuddin and Vinod Kambli as pivotal match-winners which reduced his overall value and similar is the case with Cheteshwar Pujara (2010s).\n\nRahul Dravid’s claim as the momentum changing batsman during the 2000s gets a string boost as he emerges with a high value factor (1.20) especially when seen in the light of the fact that there were other great names (Tendulkar, Laxman, Sehwag) in the fray.\n\nDecade Player Name Mtchs Runs Ave Following Batsman Runs Best/Next Best Average Avg Prolificacy Factor Efficacy Factor Value Factor 1950s V.Mankad 5 563 112.6 P.Umrigar 371 V.Hazare 121 1.52 0.93 1.41 1960s MAK Pataudi 9 705 44.1 A.Wadekar 507 A.Wadekar 63 1.39 0.70 0.97 1970s G.Viswanath 16 1359 50.3 S.Gavaskar 1124 S.Gavaskar 45 1.21 1.12 1.35 1980s D.Vengsarkar 10 895 74.6 S.Gavaskar 547 M.Amarnath 46 1.64 1.62 2.65 1990s S.Tendulkar 18 1362 59.2 M.Azharuddin 1336 V.Kambli 74 1.02 0.80 0.82 2000s R.Dravid 39 3810 74.7 S.Tendulkar 3163 R.Dravid 75 1.20 1.00 1.20 2010s C.Pujara 17 1551 64.6 S.Tendulkar 1421 VVS Laxman 94 1.09 0.69 0.75\n\nTable 10: Batsman Value (Wins)\n\nOverall Player Name Mtchs Wkts Ave Following Bowler Wkts Bowler Avg Wkts Factor Ave Factor Overall Factor 1950s V.Mankad 5 41 13.32 S.Gupte 22 Jasu Patel 11.94 1.86 0.90 1.67 1960s E.Prasanna 6 40 17.83 B.Bedi 25 B.Nandkarni 14.00 1.60 0.79 1.26 1970s B.C’Shekhar 12 86 18.31 B.Bedi 72 E.Prasanna 17.41 1.19 0.95 1.14 1980s Kapil Dev 11 49 18.0 N.Hirwani 29 M.Singh 11.25 1.69 0.63 1.06 1990s A.Kumble 17 126 17.05 V.Raju 57 J.Srinath 18.38 2.21 1.08 2.38 2000s H.Singh 31 175 21.55 A.Kumble 162 A.Kumble 20.07 1.08 0.93 1.01 2010s R Ashwin 18 124 18.20 P.Ojha 78 R.Jadeja 15.59 1.59 0.86 1.36\n\nTable 11: Bowler Value (Wins)\n\nThe bowler charts corroborates the claim Anil Kumble has as the biggest match-winner of the 1990s, his exploits on home surfaces are a stuff of legend and his factor brings it out clearly given that India registered all but 1 of its wins during this period at home. Ravi Ashwin’s exploits at home and against relatively weaker opposition like West Indies has catapulted his numbers (conventional and derived) into the elite league. But a win is a win isn’t it, and winning against weaker opposition is also a characteristic of a strong team.\n\nIndia has come a long way since Lala Amarath registered the first test century by an Indian, its players have broken records, ripped bowling attacks apart and defied them to the brink of them feeling like ripping their gear apart in frustration. While India has established an undeniable reputation as a cricket superpower, it is yet to tick some pivotal boxes which would springboard it as a formidable force wherever it tours/travels.\n\nBut for now, lets celebrate those who have helped us believe in a future of such daring expectations.\n\nHerath has often been compared with Stuart Macgill, the Australian leg spinner who many believe lost out on his true stature in the game, having played all of it in the shadow of that magician Shane Warne. In spite of his talent, he only got to play in 44 tests. What often escapes people’s attention is that in the 16 matches that they played together, Macgill took more wickets than Warne. Anyways, this piece is not about the aforementioned players. Nevertheless, what I do want to bring out by stating the popular comparison of Herath with Macgill is that Herath has carved a legacy of his own, and unlike Macgill, is the chief baggage carrier of his team’s fortunes. He no longer is in the shadow of his greater contemporary Muttiah Muralitharan.\n\nRangana Herath made his international debut in 1999, and is the only active cricketer to have featured in a test match from the previous millennium. What’s remarkable about his career is his resurgence as a top class test bowler post the retirement of Muralitharan and much like what fascinated me about Courtney Walsh, he took on this challenge with a determination that belied his age (31). His career can be divided into two parts, from his debut till Dec 2008, and from Jul 2009 to the present day.\n\nThe way this comparison fans out is truly remarkable, uptil late 2008, Herath had featured in only 14 test matches thanks mainly to Vaas and Muralitharan carrying Sri Lanka’s fortunes on their backs. Post the retirement of both, Herath has emerged as a premier bowler in a side which has not seen bowling of considerable talent come out of its talent bank. Herath has taken 277 wickets from Jul 2009 onwards, and all of his five and ten wicket hauls have come in this phase. Herath’s tally of 277 wickets during this phase is only behind James Anderson and Stuart Broad, but his number of 5-fors and 10 fors are not even approached by any bowler. Herath’s consistency, in terms of wickets/matches ratio (4.82) is bettered only by Ravichandran Ashwin (5.55) and Saeed Ajmal (5.09). Needless to say, Herath has truly been born again.\n\nPeriod Mtch Runs Wkts Avg 5WI 10WM 22 Sep 1999 – 26 Dec 2008 14 1418 36 39.39 0 0 4 Jul 2009 – 30 Jul 2016 57 7861 277 28.37 24 5 Overall 71 9279 313 29.64 24 5\n\nTable 1: Herath Career Split\n\nPlayer Mat Runs Wkts Ave SR 5WI 10WM James Anderson 80 8592 330 26.03 55.8 15 3 Stuart Broad 79 8260 306 26.99 54.3 14 2 Rangana Herath 57 7861 277 28.37 62.1 24 5 Dale Steyn 49 5121 236 21.69 43.5 14 2 Graham Swann 53 6750 221 30.54 60.7 15 3 Mitchell Johnson 52 6258 219 28.57 48.8 10 2 Nathan Lyon 55 6530 200 32.65 62 7 1 Morne Morkel 54 5178 187 27.68 56.3 5 0 Ravi Ashwin 33 4596 183 25.11 51.7 17 4 Peter Siddle 54 5414 179 30.24 60.5 7 0 Saeed Ajmal 35 5003 178 28.1 65.1 10 4 Tim Southee 44 4785 156 30.67 61.8 3 1\n\nTable 2: Top Bowlers (Jul’09-Jul’16) – Min 150 Wickets.\n\nHerath’s impact as Sri Lanka’s pivotal match-winner with the ball is also firmly (and remarkably) established when it is seen that he has taken more than 100 wickets more than the next bowler in matches that Sri Lanka has won since Jul 2009. Not only this, Herath has taken the highest proportion of wickets to total team wickets in this period, with only Dale Steyn giving him some competition in this regard. His average in won matches is also bettered only by Dale Steyn, Ravi Ashwin, and Vernon Philander. What’s worth a mention is that all his 5 career 10-fors have come in matches that Sri Lanka has won, if this doesn’t convey his impact then nothing will ever do.\n\nCountry Wkts Top Bowler Wkts % of team wickets England 819 James Anderson 179 22% Australia 814 Mitchell Johnson 148 18% India 579 Ravi Ashwin 121 21% South Africa 497 Dale Steyn 158 32% Pakistan 476 Saeed Ajmal 80 17% Sri Lanka 399 Rangana Herath 134 34% New Zealand 340 Tim Southee 68 20% West Indies 240 Kemar Roach 34 14% Bangladesh 120 Shakib Al Hasan 35 29%\n\nTable 3: Proportion of team wickets in won matches (Jul’09-Jul’16)\n\nHerath has also developed a knack of picking up wickets a handful at a time.

From Jul 2009 onwards, Herath has taken the most number of wickets in the 3rd and 4th innings of a test match, hence setting up matches for Sri Lanka more often than any other bowler in the world during this period. He is followed in this list by James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann.

But one can safely concur that Herath’s reputation as a test blower will only grow. While his age may shorty begin to challenge his ability, but we’re sure he will find a way to overcome this hurdle too.\n\nSharjah, 22 Apr 1998; India were playing Australia in what was a virtual qualifier for a spot in the final of the Coca Cola Cup. Chasing a target of 276 in 46 overs (238 to qualify for the final), revised from 284 in 50 overs due to a desert costing 4 overs of play. When play resumed after the storm, India were placed at 143/4 in 31 overs, needing 95 runs in 15 overs to qualify for the final, and 131 to win the game (which seemed highly unlikely).\n\nSachin Tendulkar hoisted a slower ball from Kasprowickz for a six in front of the sight screen to end the 32nd over and get India past the 150 mark. He kept batting with relative restraint until about the 38th over, the match equation stood at 60 runs needed off 56 balls for India to qualify for the final. Starting with a straight, almost nonchalant, six off Steve Waugh, Tendulkar produced an awe (and romance) inspiring display of batting which has not been experienced by his fans since then. By the time the dust of that onslaught settled with his dismissal, India had not only cruised past the qualifying score (with 20 balls remaining) but with 34 runs required, looked poised for a win.\n\nBut apart from Tendulkar’s pyrotechnics, there’s something else which will be associated with that great night almost for eternity. It is Anthony William (Tony) Greig’s pyrotechnics played out from behind the microphone. I think it’s a pardonable exaggeration to say that Grieg’s commentary has had a big role to play for the cult status that innings of Tendulkar has acquired over the years. With Greig’s demise on Dec 29, 2012, Cricket lost one of its most avid disciples. He played a key role in making cricket the spectacle (limited overs if only) it is today by promoting Kerry Packer’s World Series cricket.\n\nBut is Tony Greig to be remembered only for his stint behind the microphone? After all, he represented England in 58 test matches, led them in 14, scored almost 3600 runs and took 141 wickets with medium place and spin bowling. I believe Tony Grieg is one of the most under-rated cricketers of his generation.\n\nTony Greig played 58 test matches between a five year period between 1972 and 1977. It is a testament to his abilities as a genuine all-rounder that during his career, he scored the most runs, and took the most number of wickets for any England player after Derek Underwood. What’s even more impressive is that even amongst all test playing nations, only Greg Chappell scored more runs than Greig, and apart from Derek Underwood, only Dennis Lille took more wickets than Greig’s 141.\n\nOne must also remember that Greig was an all-rounder, so in-spite of having played more matches than any other cricketer during his career, he didn’t get the bandwidth of either a specialist batsman or a bowler. So for an all-rounder to be at the top of the batting and bowling charts across any time frame is quite an achievement.\n\nAs far as his batting is concerned, Consistency is the word which describes it best. For one thing, his career average never dropped below 40, which is mighty impressive for an all-rounder. Not only that, Greig was amongst the select few batsmen who averaged more than 50 in test wins during his career span. Although he placed below several batsmen (luminaries, i.e.), but he still had a better average than Doug Walters and Ian Chappell. Also, 3 of his 8 test centuries came in winning causes.\n\n(Among other things, one can’t help but notice that it’s Gundappa Viswanath instead of Sunil Gavaskar who features as the only Indian on this list. In fact, India never lost a test when Viswanath scored a century, but that’s a separate story altogether.)\n\nPlayer Name Mat Inns Runs Ave 100 50 Geoff Boycott 7 12 827 75.18 4 3 Gordon Greenidge 8 15 1015 72.50 5 5 Viv Richards 11 17 1037 69.13 4 2 Greg Chappell 23 38 2133 68.80 8 13 Clive Lloyd 14 22 1312 65.60 5 3 Roy Fredericks 14 23 1227 61.35 4 9 Dennis Amiss 13 20 1002 58.94 3 2 Ian Redpath 15 28 1437 57.48 6 6 Alvin Kallicharran 12 19 968 56.94 2 5 Gundappa Viswanath 9 18 817 54.46 2 4 Tony Greig 17 22 1064 53.20 3 8 Doug Walters 15 23 975 48.75 3 7 Ian Chappell 20 35 1481 46.28 3 8 Rodney Marsh 23 34 1169 38.96 3 5\n\nTable 1: Average in test wins (8 Jan 1972-25 Aug 1977)- min 750 runs.\n\nGreig’s consistency as a batsman is also illustrated by his series by series record. He played a total 15 test series, and in 10 of them he averaged over 35. One must also not forget the runs he scored in ‘tough-rubbers’; most evident is his performance vs Australia in the 1974/75 ashes played down under. The fierce pace of Lillee and Thomson terrified England batsmen throughout the six match series; eventually won 4-1 by Australia. Not only was Greig the highest scoring England batsmen with 446 runs, but was the only England batsman apart from John Edrich to average more than 40.\n\nIn the 1976 Wisden Trophy vs the West Indies, marked by controversy over his comments of making the West Indies ‘Grovel’, Greig was nowhere near the top of the batting charts which was dominated exclusively by three West Indies batsmen (Richards, Greenidge, Fredericks), but notably he was amongst the only England batsmen along with Dennis Amiss, Alan Knott and David Steele to have managed a century against the West Indies’ menacing pace battery.\n\nFor a majority of his career, Greig batted at no.6, and till date he has scored the most runs at this position apart from Steve Waugh, Hashan Tillakaratne and VVS Laxman. Although his average looks a bit mediocre compared to other batsmen on the list, but it must be remembered again that Greig was an all-rounder, and (amongst all-rounders) only Gary Sobers (53.34) averaged more than him at this position whereas Ian Botham averaged only 29.23. That is some class to be at par with.\n\nPlayer Mat Inns Runs Ave 100 50 Steve Waugh 66 79 3165 51.04 6 16 Hashan Tillakaratne 58 74 2843 47.38 7 11 VVS Laxman 52 67 2760 50.18 5 20 Tony Greig 45 67 2741 43.50 7 15 Ian Botham 66 94 2690 29.23 5 14 Gary Sobers 42 57 2614 53.34 8 11 Allan Border 48 63 2556 52.16 6 17 Shiv Chanderpaul 40 49 2528 64.82 7 16 Asad Shafiq 39 56 2420 46.53 8 12 AB de Villiers 40 50 2394 52.04 5 14 Clive Lloyd 40 47 2114 49.16 6 13 Tillakaratne Dilshan 42 52 2087 46.37 5 8 Angelo Matthews 34 51 2044 49.85 4 11\n\nTable 2: Most runs at No.6\n\nGreig is amongst the most prolific all-rounders not only during his time, but in test cricket history as well. Fancy this, Greig is one of the 15 select players to have scored 300 runs and taken 20 wickets in a test series. What’s even more interesting is that he is the only England all-rounder to have breached this double along with Andrew Flintoff; Ian Botham missed the mark by one run but his performance in the concerned rubber (1981 Ashes) is about much more than just the numbers, it uplifted an entire nation, or a team to say the least.\n\nIf we reduce the cut-off to 300 runs and 15 wickets, the list of achievement expands to 34, but Grieg is again the only Englishman to have breached the double twice. The only other players to have bettered Greig’s frequency are Sobers (5), Miller (4), and Botham (3). All, apart from Miller, played a substantial number of matches more than Greig.\n\nAlthough more of a batting all-rounder, Greig bowling was more than useful, none more so than the one instance where he took 13 wickets in a match vs West Indies at port of spain (1972) is the 5th best bowling performance by an England bowler from the 2nd World war to the present day.\n\nApart from his utilities as a batsman and bowler, Greig was also an extremely good fielder as is evident from the number of catches he took (87). At the time if his retirement in 1977, only 5 fieldsmen; Colin Cowdrey (120), Wally Hammond (110), Gary Sobers (109), Ian Chappell (103), Bob Simpson (99) had taken more catches then Greig. Removing the time filter to include all fieldsmen till the present day, Greig’s catches/inns ratio (.813) is amongst the best for a non-wicketkeeper. Only 6 fielders in the history of the game have a better ratio than Greig’s.\n\nPlayer Mat Inns Ct Dis/Inn Eknath Solkar 27 50 53 1.060 Darren Sammy 38 68 65 0.956 Bob Simpson 62 117 110 0.940 Brian Young 35 58 54 0.931 Ross Taylor 69 129 112 0.868 Stephen Fleming 111 199 171 0.859 Tony Greig 58 107 87 0.813 Mark Taylor 104 197 157 0.797 Bruce Mitchell 42 71 56 0.789 Graeme Hick 65 115 90 0.783\n\nTable 3: Catches/inns (Min.50 catches)\n\nAs an all-rounder, Greig stands in absolute elite company when it comes to the difference between batting and bowling averages of top all-rounders across eras. Considering all-rounders having achieved a double 3000 runs and 100 wickets, Greig’s ‘average difference’ (8.23) is bettered only by Gary Sobers, Jacques Kallis and Imran Khan. Now that’s cricketing royalty, because even if we reduce the career runs cut-off to 2000 runs, Greig’s difference is still only bettered by 5 players.\n\nPlayer Matches Runs Bat Av Wkts Bowl Av Ave Diff Gary Sobers 93 8032 57.78 235 34.03 23.75 Jacques Kallis 166 13289 55.37 292 32.65 22.72 Imran Khan 88 3807 37.69 362 22.81 14.88 Shaun Pollock 108 3781 32.31 421 23.11 9.2 Tony Grieg 58 3599 40.43 141 32.2 8.23 Ian Botham 102 5200 33.54 383 28.4 5.14 Richard Hadlee 86 3124 27.16 431 22.29 4.87 Chris Cairns 62 3320 33.53 218 29.4 4.13 Kapil Dev 131 5248 31.05 434 29.64 1.41 Andrew Flintoff 79 3845 31.77 226 32.78 -1.01 Daniel Vettori 113 4531 30.00 362 34.36 -4.36 Ravi Shastri 80 3830 35.79 151 40.96 -5.17 Chaminda Vaas 111 3089 24.32 355 29.58 -5.26 Shane Warne 145 3154 17.32 708 25.41 -8.09 Carl Hooper 102 5762 36.46 114 49.42 -12.96\n\nTable 4: Average difference of All-Rounders (Min.3000 runs and 100 wickets)\n\nTony Greig’s most remembered facet is his enthusiastic calling of cricket action from behind the microphone, so much so that his exploits as a cricketer are easily forgotten. But if there’s one thing that he carried over from his cricketing career to a commentator, and what would make those who didn’t watch him play, believe in his glitter of his career achievements was his passion and persona; providing ample evidence that he was brilliant at whatever he did.\n\nIndependent since the same number of years as India, Pakistan has found it hard to establish itself as a force to reckon with, both politically and economically. The (absolute) homogeneity of the religion of its citizens was both the necessity and the basis on which the nation was founded. The country stands today, it seems, in perpetual wait for relief from gunshots and wounds, for an opportunity to out-do its mighty neighbor (in acceptable spheres) and for a bigger occasion to celebrate and cherish than the 1992 world cup triumph, which to many Pakistanis is the only shining beacon in its otherwise tumultuous history.\n\nBut, there are two spheres where Pakistan can claim to have outdone its mighty neighbor; Music, and till about 1999, Cricket. The first test series between the two nations was held in India in 1952, India won the rubber 2-1 and this was to remain the only conclusive decision in the 3 bilateral rubbers held till 1961, a period in which the two nations drew 13 consecutive matches.\n\nCricketing ties were resumed through India’s 3 test tour of Pakistan in 1978; Pakistan beat India 2-0 thanks largely to the heroics of Zaheer Abbas (whose aggregate of 583 runs was a record for a 3 match series) and Javed Miandad. The baton was then passed on to a certain Imran Khan during India’s second tour to Pakistan in 1982/83. Bowling at humiliating pace throughout, Imran took 40 wickets in the six test series and along with Mudassar Nazar (761 runs) summed up India’s 3-0 defeat. This, coupled with dominating performances in one day matches at Sharjah in the latter half of the decade, meant that Pakistan seemed unbeatable to the average Indian cricket lover.\n\nWaqar Younis only helped further this reputation when he smacked Tendulkar on the jaw at Sialkot in 1989 as India was holding on to draw a historic test series in Pakistan. A bowler of raw pace back then, in 1992, Waqar Younis was a subject of much interest to purists the world-over, amazed as they were at the phenomenon of reverse swing.\n\nTEST MATCHES\n\nWaqar Younis was at his peak as a test match bowler between 15 Nov 1989 and 28 Sep 1994. During this period, Waqar was undoubtedly the most prolific wicket taker in the world, taking 187 wickets in 32 matches; 20 wickets more than the second placed Wasim Akram in almost the same number of matches. Waqar took an astonishing 5.8 wickets per match, comfortably ahead of Wasim (5.4) and Ambrose (5.15). But what’s most amazing about these statistics is Waqar’s unbelievable consistency of bagging wickets by the handful. Waqar was talking a 5-for once every 3 innings, which is way ahead of Wasim (4.3) and Ambrose (5.8). Waqar’s average is only behind Curtly Ambrose (18.71) while his strike rate of 35.4 is clearly ahead of the next placed Wasim Akram (46.6).\n\nPlayer Mat Inns Wkts Ave SR 5WI 10WM Waqar Younis 32 57 187 18.85 35.4 19 4 Wasim Akram 31 56 167 20.46 46.6 13 2 Curtly Ambrose 31 58 159 18.71 51.0 10 3 Merv Hughes 36 66 158 25.99 54.9 4 0 Craig McDermott 34 59 151 26.21 55.4 6 2 Shane Warne 27 48 124 23.62 67.4 6 1 Danny Morrison 27 43 103 32.78 59.1 7 0 Courtney Walsh 31 58 100 28.66 65.7 2 0 Phil DeFreitas 26 46 99 27.58 59.1 3 0 Devon Malcolm 27 49 97 33.73 61.0 5 2\n\nTable 1: Top Bowlers in Test Matches (15 Nov 1989 – 28 Sep 1994)\n\nDuring this period, Waqar was also the most wicket-taker in wins, taking 123 wickets in 15 matches with a jaw-dropping WPM (Wickets-per Match) ratio of 8.2. Curtly Ambrose (98) and Wasim Akram (92) are the next placed bowlers again. His average and strike rate are the best of the lot too.\n\nWaqar also took 13 of career 22 5-fors in these 15 matches. Such a skewed concentration of wickets may show that Waqar peaked very early but while he did, he stood head and shoulders above the others.\n\nPlayer Mat Inns Wkts Ave SR 5WI 10WM Waqar Younis 15 30 123 14.46 28.8 13 4 Curtly Ambrose 15 30 98 14.98 42.3 7 3 Wasim Akram 13 26 92 15.67 36.6 7 1 Merv Hughes 17 34 80 22.65 52.6 1 0 Craig McDermott 15 28 74 22.9 51.8 4 2 Shane Warne 12 24 69 19.85 59.8 3 0 Anil Kumble 8 16 55 19.36 50.3 4 1 Courtney Walsh 14 28 54 24.27 54.4 0 0 Phil DeFreitas 7 14 40 19.85 45.2 2 0\n\nTable 2: Wickets in Wins (15 Nov 1989 – 28 Sep 1994)\n\nDuring his career span, Waqar was amongst the most formidable wicket takers in winning causes. His tally of 222 wickets is bettered only by Glenn Mcgrath (297) and Muttiah Muralidaran (236). His average is also an impressive 18.20, and only Ambrose, Murali, Donald, Kumble and Wasim have a better average but the numbers are packed closely. One thing that stands out for Waqar yet again is his strike rate, which is better than any bowler who took more than 100 wickets in matches won during his career span. Incidentally, Waqar’s strike rate of 43.4 is the second best in the history of cricket (After Dale Steyn) if the cut off is taken at 200 wickets and the fourth best when the cut-off is reduced to 100 wickets.\n\nPlayer Mat Inns Wkts Ave SR 5WI 10WM Curtly Ambrose 33 65 184 15.19 41.9 12 3 Muttiah Muralitharan 29 57 236 16.20 46.2 22 10 Allan Donald 33 64 187 16.79 35.5 14 3 Shaun Pollock 34 67 166 17.19 45.3 9 1 Anil Kumble 23 46 170 17.34 45.2 12 3 Wasim Akram 33 65 188 18.19 41.6 12 2 Waqar Younis 39 78 222 18.20 35.0 14 4 Glenn Mcgrath 59 118 297 19.16 46.9 13 3 Courtney Walsh 33 66 163 19.35 45.8 7 1\n\nTable 3: Wickets in Wins (15 Nov 1989 – 2 Jan 2003)\n\nOne of Waqar’s (and Wasim’s) outstanding abilities was to ball Yorker/full length balls at high speed which resulted in him taking a lot of wickets in the form of a bowled/LBW dismissal. 212 out of this total 373 career wickets came in the form of the two modes of dismissal, a proportion (56.8%) which is only behind England’s Brian Statham (57.1%). Ray Lindwall and Wasim Akram are the other two bowers to take more than 50% of their wickets in this manner. One thing to note in the complete list is that of the 19 bowlers who have a proportion of greater than 40%, few (6) bowled in the 2000s, and even fewer (2) made their debuts in the same decade (Rangana Herath and Matthew Hoggard). Have batsmen today, found a technique to avoid the ball from hitting the timber, or have the bowlers lost the penetrative guile is a matter of deeper analysis.\n\nBowler Bowled/LBW Total Prop Statham 144 252 57.14 Waqar 212 373 56.84 Lindwall 128 228 56.14 Akram 221 414 53.38 Swann 127 255 49.80 Garner 126 259 48.65 Imran 176 362 48.62 Holding 116 249 46.59 Trueman 143 307 46.58 Kapil Dev 199 434 45.85\n\nTable 4: Bowled/LBW wickets (% of total Wickets)\n\nCOMPARISON WITH WASIM\n\nWaqar formed with Wasim Akram, one of the most deadly ad effective fast bowling partnerships of all time. In the 61 matches that they played together, they took almost the same number of wickets, but whereas Waqar took wickets at a better Strike Rate, Wasim outdid him in average, 5-fors and 10-fors. Also note that differences in these parameters are almost negligible as both bowlers were neck and neck in terms of wicket taking abilities.\n\nWaqar Younis Mat Inns Runs Wkts Ave Econ SR 5 10 61 110 6351 277 22.92 3.27 42 17 3 Wasim Akram Mat Inns Runs Wkts Ave Econ SR 5 10 61 109 6016 282 21.33 2.6 49.2 20 4\n\nTable 5: Wasim and Waqar (Matches played together)\n\nIn the 28 matches that they played and won together, there again is little to differentiate between the two. They took almost the same number of wickets, gave away the same number of rune per wicket, and took the same number of 5 and 10 fors. Nevertheless, Waqar comes up trumps when it comes to strike rate, proof positive of the mindset of attacking bowling ingrained into him by his mentor Imran Khan.\n\nWaqar Younis Mat Inns Runs Wkts Ave Econ SR 5 10 28 56 2969 165 17.99 3.15 34.2 10 2 Wasim Akram Mat Inns Runs Wkts Ave Econ SR 5 10 28 55 2902 161 18.02 2.62 41.1 11 2\n\nTable 6: Wasim and Waqar (Matches won together)\n\nA closer look at the numbers of Wasim and Waqar, does bring out one facet that catapults Wasim into the category of all-time greats and Waqar into those who touched and missed; Consistency. Wasim’s numbers did not vary no matter what the opposition and the venue, whereas at least one of the two had to be in Waqar’s favour for him to do well. Breaking the matches they played together by opposition, the difference between Wasim’s highest and lowest average vs an opposition is only 12.21, whereas for Waqar, the difference is 39.06. A similar story prevails when it comes to strike rate as Wasim was at his best against every opposition (difference: 21.3) while Waqar had more choices (difference: 62.5).\n\nWaqar Wasim Waqar Wasim Waqar Wasim Opposition Wkts Average SR India 8 21 48.75 23.76 80.20 53.60 Australia 24 42 34.37 21.66 66.00 52.40 New Zealand 45 48 17.86 16.41 38.90 40.90 West Indies 47 57 23.12 19.64 39.50 42.10 Sri Lanka 48 35 21.27 20.20 36.00 49.30 England 44 37 25.93 28.62 46.10 62.20 Zimbabwe 34 34 21.91 20.11 41.80 47.20 South Africa 14 8 15.14 24.37 27.70 51.70 Bangladesh 13 0 9.69 – 17.70 –\n\nTable 7: Wasim and Waqar (Performance vs Opposition in matches played together).\n\nONE DAY INTERNATIONALS\n\nExcellent as they are in test matches, Waqar’s ODI exploits are a notch above his test performances. To this date, Waqar remains one of the only 4 bowlers to have taken more than 400 ODI wickets (Muralitharan, Wasim Akram and Chaminda Vaas are the others). Waqar’s peak as an ODI bowler was the 7 1/2 year period between 1 May 1990 and 5 Nov 1997. His tally of 243 wickets is comfortable ahead of the second places Wasim Akram (211), his strike rate is bettered only by team-mate Saqlain Mushtaq and only Saqlain, Wasim and Donald have a better average.\n\nPlayer Mat Inns Wkts Ave SR 4W 5W Waqar Younis 141 140 243 22.10 29.0 9 8 Wasim Akram 140 139 212 21.83 34.6 11 3 A Kumble 124 121 167 27.09 39.6 5 2 J Srinath 123 121 158 28.96 40.4 2 2 AA Donald 89 88 150 22.08 32.2 5 2 Aaqib Javed 119 116 138 30.00 42.1 2 4 CEL Ambrose 111 110 136 25.02 43.3 2 2 Saqlain Mushtaq 71 68 133 19.69 27.6 5 4 SK Warne 76 75 129 22.16 33.0 9 1 ST Jayasuriya 136 117 123 33.39 41.0 3 2\n\nTable 8: Top ODI bowlers (1 May 1990 – 5 Nov 1997)\n\nWaqar’s ability to take wickets by the handful is amply reflected in ODIs too. Waqar holds the record for having taken the most 5-fors in ODI history (13), and Muttiah Muralitharan is the only other bowler to have taken 10 or more. Waqar has also taken the most number of wickets (127) in a 4 and 5 wicket haul in ODIs, followed by Murali (112) and Lee (101).\n\nThe opposition Waqar tormented most during his career was the relatively weak New Zealand side, against whom he took 79 wickets in 37 matches. The 5 five-fors he took against them is also a record for the most taken against one opposition in ODIs.\n\nWaqar is one of the most formidable match-winners in ODI history, his tally of 278 wickets in wins is surpassed only by Muralitharan, Akram, Mcgrath, Lee and Pollock.\n\nPlayer Mat Inns Wkts Ave SR 4W 5W M.

Not only has Pakistan won more matches than any opposition (79), but amongst teams which have played at least 20 matches there, Pakistan has the highest Win/Loss ratio (1.975) as well, followed by Australia (1.75) and West Indies (1.00).\n\nWaqar’s 122 wickets at Sharjah remain the most wickets by a bowler on a single ground in ODI history, followed by Wasim (114) at Sharjah and Shakib Al Hasan (94) at the Sher-e-Bangla stadium, Mirpur.\n\nThe author of what is regarded as one of the finest books on cricket (Beyond a Boundary), CLR James was a pioneer in post-colonial literature. The aforementioned book too is not your typical cricket book, James himself described the book’s contents as “neither cricket reminisces nor autobiographical”.\n\nJames’ writings on prominent cricketers of his time (Especially West Indian) were not only a reflection on their style of play, but also a study of the circumstances that shaped its composition and expression. Thrilling stroke play by any West Indian batsman, as per James viewpoint, is not just an array of dazzling strokes but also characteristic of what they’re endowed with in a greater volume than cricketers of other descent/s: The ability to reach the high noon of the craft being practiced, and in days of yore, they did that too bluddy often.\n\nSo, when James writes about Rohan Bholalall Kanhai as ‘the high peak of West Indian cricketing development’, you know he’s talking about a player of exceptional merits: for no ordinary bloke would merit a praise so illustrious.\n\nApart from James, I can recall three eminent cricketers talking about Rohan Kanhai in a similar vein; Richie Benaud considered him one of the greatest batsman the world has ever seen, so did fellow Guyanese Alvin Kallicharran, and Sunil Gavaskar, of all people, named his son Rohan after him. Kanhai’s place in the game’s memoires is perhaps described best by the phrase used in a Bollywood blockbuster (Lagaan, 2001) for its lead protagonist; Lost in the history books. (I’m listening to the theme as I write)\n\nIn a career spanning just shy of 17 years, Kanhai played 79 test matches for the West Indies, enthralling crowds with his inventive stroke play, none more evident than in his famous fall-back hook shot (Pictured above). Amongst many, the most notable factor in Kanhai’s career was his consistency, never in his career did his average go above 49.71, and from his 30th test onwards never did it dip below 46.14.\n\nRohan Kanhai took a while to get going in Test Cricket, and like fellow West Indian Garry Sobers, turned his first test century into a big one vs India. Kanhai, in fact, went a step further: his second hundred was also a double, vs Pakistan. These were to remain the only double centuries he scored in his career, but the full noon of his batting glowed in resplendent fashion against every opposition.\n\nKanhai was at his peak form between 26 Mar 1959 and 9 Mar 1973, a period when his average (53.23) was surpassed only by Graeme Pollock, Ken Barrington and Garry Sobers. Kanhai also scored almost 90 runs (89.76) per test match, only Graeme Pollock (98.1) and Garry Sobers (91.4) scored more than Kanhai. 13 of his 15 career centuries came during this period, bettered only by Ken Barrington (20) and Garry Sobers (19).\n\nPlayer Name Mtch Inns Runs Ave 100 50 Graeme Pollock 23 41 2256 60.97 7 11 Ken Barrington 80 128 6754 59.76 20 35 Garry Sobers 60 105 5485 59.61 19 21 Rohan Kanhai 51 88 4578 53.23 13 21 Tom Graveney 31 47 2292 52.09 7 9 Bob Simpson 46 84 3995 51.21 8 23 Ted Dexter 57 95 4290 49.31 8 26 Doug Walters 38 66 2877 48.76 9 17 Colin Cowdrey 75 125 5363 47.88 17 24 Geoff Boycott 51 89 3620 47.63 10 18\n\nTable 1: Top Batsmen (26 Mar’59 – 9 Mar’73)\n\nKanhai batted at No.3 position for a majority of his career (52 tests), amongst batsmen who have scored atleast 3000 runs at this position, Kanhai is amongst the 12 who have averaged more than 50. Although he is placed 10th in terms of averages, one needs to look closely at how packed the averages are from Hashim Amla onwards (Look and GASP at Sangakkara’s numbers btw!), given especially that the table is led by two Frankensteinians, Don Bradman (103.63) and Wally Hammond (74.78).\n\nPlayer Mat Inns Runs Ave 100 50 Don Bradman 40 56 5078 103.63 20 10 WR Hammond 37 52 3440 74.78 14 4 Viv Richards 45 59 3508 61.54 12 14 Kumar Sangakkara 125 207 11679 60.82 37 50 Brian Lara 45 66 3749 60.46 9 13 Hashim Amla 76 122 6251 56.31 22 27 Ricky Ponting 113 196 9904 56.27 32 43 Kane Williamson 38 70 3443 53.79 11 16 Rahul Dravid 136 219 10524 52.88 28 50 Rohan Kanhai 57 90 4689 52.68 13 20\n\nTable 2: Batting Averages at No.3 (Min 3000 runs.\n\nKanhai had a deeper connection with India apart from just his Parents being its natives. Right from scoring his maiden test hundred against India, Kanhai developed a flavor for the flavorless bowling of India against whom he averaged a whopping 62.70. For batsmen who have scored a minimum 1500 runs against India, Kanhai’s average is bettered by Zaheer Abbas, Garry Sobers, Jacques Kallis, Javed Miandad, Mahela Jayawardene and Shiv Chanderpaul.\n\nPlayer Name Mtch Inns Runs Ave 100 50 Zaheer Abbas 19 25 1740 87.00 6 3 Garry Sobers 18 30 1920 83.47 8 7 Jacques Kallis 18 31 1734 69.36 7 5 Javed Miandad 28 39 2228 67.51 5 14 Mahela Jayawardene 18 28 1822 67.48 6 8 Shiv Chanderpaul 25 44 2171 63.85 7 10 Rohan Kanhai 18 28 1693 62.70 4 7 Matthew Hayden 18 35 1888 59.00 6 8 Clive Lloyd 28 44 2344 58.60 7 12 Kevin Pietersen 16 28 1581 58.55 6 6\n\nTable 3: Top Batsmen vs India (min 1500 runs)\n\nWhile analyzing a cricketer’s numbers, one generally looks for outliers that can be highlighted when compared with other players either within a time frame, or on a standalone basis. But as highlighted before, Kanhai was such a consistent performer throughout his career that there are no sudden peaks or troughs in his form. So, it is apt to highlight this very factor of his play; Consistency which is startling for a career as long as his.\n\nKanhai, like most batsmen of his era, played only against 4 test playing nations during his career, and apart from India (understandable, since India had a spin dominated attack at that time), the difference between his highest and his lowest average is 3.8. Nevertheless, even if the comparison is stretched to all opposition teams, the difference between Kanhai’s highest and lowest average against an opposition for a minimum of 10 test innings batted against each, is only behind Basil Butcher, Ian Redpath, Bob Simpson and Geoff Boycott.\n\nIt is to be considered, however, that for each of batsmen named above, numbers have been calculated after discounting for in-frequent opposition/s, i.e. opposition against which a batsman played less than 10 innings. Kanhai is, in fact, the one of the only four batsmen who didn’t come across an in-frequent opposition in this time period along with Gary Sobers, Colin Cowdrey and Ted Dexter. That he towers above them all in this respect is a remarkable achievement.\n\nPlayer Name High Ave Opp Low Ave Opp Diff Gary Sobers 89.45 Pak 26.91 NZ 62.54 Ken Barrington 79.44 NZ 34.73 WI 44.71 Hanif Mohammad 73.60 Aus 37.30 Eng 36.3 Tom Graveney 66.68 WI 34.90 Aus 31.78 Doug Walters 92.00 WI 36.87 Eng 55.13 Bob Simpson 53.27 Eng 39.20 SA 14.07 Geoff Boycott 51.10 Aus 36.93 NZ 14.17 Colin Cowdrey 72.55 Ind 37.88 Aus 34.67 Ted Dexter 93.60 Pak 38.80 Aus 54.8 Rohan Kanhai 62.70 Ind 41.98 Eng 20.72 Bill Lawry 69.00 Eng 36.48 SA 32.52 Conrad Hunte 64.30 Pak 33.50 Ind 30.8 Basil Butcher 47.66 Ind 40.50 Aus 7.16 Ian Redpath 46.52 SA 33.92 Ind 12.6 John Edrich 63.75 NZ 24.11 Pak 39.64 Ian Chappell 72.66 WI 16.94 SA 55.72 Chandu Borde 82.50 Pak 21.82 Aus 60.68\n\nTable 4: Average Difference – Opposition (30 May’57 – 30 Mar’74)\n\nKanhai was also amongst the most consistent batsmen in both home and overseas conditions, during his career span only Bob Simpson (.41) and Ian Redpath (1.62) had a lower difference between their home and overseas average.

As per that method, a batsman’s career innings are broken down into multiple slices/slabs of 10 innings. His average across those slices is divided with his overall RPI (Runs per Innings, not discounting for not outs) to arrive at what he calls a Slice Performance Index (SPI). Standard deviation of the SPI distribution is then calculated, lower the SD, better the consistency levels.\n\nThe SPI obtained above is divided into the following 5 cohorts/categories, and a percentage of the innings slices with an SPI falling between the 2nd and the 4th category is then considered as the final indicator of consistency.\n\n>.67\n\n.67-.90\n\n.90-1.10\n\n10-1.33\n\n>1.33\n\nConsidering the same time span as in the previous table, Rohan Kanhai with an comes out to be the fourth most consistent batsman (on the basis of slice percentage) after Ian Redpath, Conrad Hunte and Colin Cowdrey as per this exercise. The constant appearance of little appreciated batsmen like Ian Redpath, Conrad Hunte and Basil Butcher again underlines the flavor for numbers over the real substance of the batsman.\n\nKanhai’s SD is also only behind Colin Cowdrey, Conrad Hunte, Ian Redpath and Bill Lawry.\n\nPlayer Name SD <.67 .67<>.90 .90-1.10 1.10-1.33 >1.33 Total Mid 3 Percentage Rank Ian Redpath 0.26 0 4 4 1 0 10 9 90.00% 1 Conrad Hunte 0.26 0 2 4 1 0 8 7 87.50% 2 Colin Cowdrey 0.25 0 5 3 4 0 15 12 80.00% 3 Rohan Kanhai 0.28 0 3 4 4 0 14 11 78.57% 4 Bill Lawry 0.28 0 4 3 3 0 13 10 76.92% 5 Tom Graveney 0.30 0 0 1 4 0 7 5 71.43% 6 Chandu Borde 0.38 0 3 2 2 0 10 7 70.00% 7 Geoff Boycott 0.32 0 1 3 3 0 11 7 63.64% 8 Doug Walters 0.47 0 3 2 0 0 8 5 62.50% 9 Basil Butcher 0.31 0 1 2 2 0 8 5 62.50% 9 Hanif Mohammad 0.40 2 1 2 1 1 7 4 57.14% 11 Ted Dexter 0.39 0 4 0 2 0 11 6 54.55% 12 Gary Sobers 0.42 4 4 3 1 3 15 8 53.33% 13 John Edrich 0.43 0 4 1 0 0 10 5 50.00% 14 Bob Simpson 0.39 0 2 2 0 0 9 4 44.44% 15 Ian Chappell 0.40 3 2 1 1 3 10 4 40.00% 16 Ken Barrington 0.41 0 0 1 3 0 13 4 30.77% 17\n\nTable 7: Consistency Index as per Slice method (30 May’57 – 30 Mar’74).\n\nPlease also note that this table does not convey that batsmen like Garry Sobers and Ken Barrington were not consistent. Consistency, in this case, is closer to what Oxford defines it more than anything else; the quality of achieving a level of performance which does not vary greatly in quality over time.\n\nSobers’ and Barrington’s outlier dominated numbers also mean that they were able to lift their game above their usual levels more often than other players. Kanhai’s appreciation, meanwhile, is that he was able to perform irrespective of the opposition and geography. Not that de didn’t lift his game when it was required (he was involved in 34 century and 85 half century partnerships during his career), but Kanhai was more likely to perform to his customary level more often that his contemporaries, and this is no mean achievement.\n\nCricket enthusiasts have always been engaged in debates on deciding on the best from amongst two or more outstanding batsmen of their respective generations. Although the reader might differ (and digressions are welcome), but I believe that batsmen offer a more diverse study (in contrast). Dominant hand aside, batsmen differ widely across physiological nuances in terms of stance (and head position), back lift, follow through and much more that’s visible more to a technical eye. A comparison of bowlers rests mostly on their numbers, whereas for batsmen, style of play is a factor in equal measure.\n\nThere’s always a dissection of a batsman’s style, apart from his technique and temperament. Or else, pundits would not banter Graeme Smith’s ‘ugly’ batting style while lauding his performances at the same time. On the other hand, Victor Trumper only averaged 39 in tests, but is universally regarded as one of the greatest batsmen to have played the game, mostly on the back of his elegant (and brilliant) style of play. Style, it seems, does matter.\n\nThere was, by universal consent, no better exponent of style across eras than Brian Charles Lara. Any tribute to Lara is futile without a mention of that back-lift and the flourish that followed it. His contemporaries swear by that if a last penny was to be spent on something, it would be to watch Lara bat. Lara batting style, according to Ian Chappell, was a mix, and reminiscent of two swashbuckling West Indies batsmen; Sir Garry Sobers and Roy Fredericks.\n\nIn debates to decide who the better batsman was between Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara, the diminutive Indian usually comes up trumps backed by an inference that he was more consistent than the former. This, I believe, is a grave misconception. For Brian Lara was not all style, there was serious substance that (sadly) made itself evident when few were watching.\n\nTEST MATCHES\n\nBrian Lara’s career can be divided into three phases; Dec’90 to Aug’95, Apr’96-Apr’01 and from Nov’01-Nov’06. His form and numbers were similar in the first and last of these phases, whereas he struggled (as per his standards) during the second one, averaging almost 20 lesser than in each of the preceding and following periods.\n\nBrian Lara averaged 60.96 from his debut till the end of the Wisden Trophy 1995 (Drawn (2-2) series in which he triumphantly topped the batting charts with 765 runs with 3 centuries), keeping a cut off of 1000 runs, his average (60.96) was bettered only by fellow-West Indian Jimmy Adams (62.15). His two record breaking innings of 375 & 501 were also registered in this period. His form fell away post Aug 1995 and he averaged 40.06 and although the world saw flickers of his genius in the 1999 Frank Worrell Trophy, where he single handedly denied Australia a series victory with innings of 213 (Kingston) and 153 (Barbados), the in-consistency of such performances meant that his average (keeping the same cut-off) was placed 26th in the list of averages for that period.\n\nPeriod Mtch Inns No Runs Ave 100 50 6 Dec’90- 24 Aug’95 31 52 2 3048 60.96 7 16 19 Apr’96 – 19 Apr’01 49 89 2 3485 40.06 8 17 13 Nov’01 – 27 Nov’06 51 91 2 5420 60.9 19 15 Total 131 232 6 11953 52.88 34 48\n\nTable 1: Brian Lara Career Break-Up\n\nStarting from the 2001 test series in Sri Lanka where he aggregated a massive 688 runs, which is also the second highest aggregate by a batsman for a 3 match series, Brian Lara commenced on a prolific, but often in vain, run making period which continued right till his retirement. Keeping a 1500 run cut-off for the period, Brian Lara averaged 60.90, only behind Ricky Ponting, Mohammad Yousuf, Rahul Dravid and Jacques Kallis. The next West Indian on the list is Shiv Chanderpaul with an average of 49.40. His run aggregate (5420) is also only behind Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden.\n\nLara also scored 19 of his 34 career centuries in this period, and was scoring a century every 4.8 innings, a rate bettered only by Mohammad Yousuf (4.19) and Ricky Ponting (4.21).\n\nPlayer Name Mtch Inns Runs Ave 100 50 Ricky Ponting 58 101 6181 72.71 24 21 Matthew Hayden 63 114 5916 56.88 22 21 Brian Lara 51 91 5420 60.89 19 15 Rahul Dravid 55 90 5003 64.97 14 25 Justin Langer 58 104 4774 49.21 14 18 Marcus Trescothick 60 113 4754 45.71 12 22 Jacques Kallis 49 86 4604 64.84 15 23 Mohammad Yousuf 40 67 4167 68.31 16 13 Michael Vaughan 53 97 4022 45.19 14 12\n\nTable 2: Top Run Scorers (Nov’01-Nov’06)\n\nThis period also saw West Indies plummet to new lows, the 50 test matches that Brian Lara played in, West Indies lost 29 and won only 7. For Lara to feature on this list is a testament to his genius and a statement on the state of affairs of West Indies cricket. Lara’s average in losses (53.17) is, unfortunately, also the highest in this period followed by Jacob Oram and Mohammad Yousuf. He also holds the record for must runs scored in a match in a losing cause; 351 vs Sri Lanka at Galle (2001).\n\nGeorge Headley once said that he’d be wearing his pads in the dressing room after the toss result, and that a wicket would fall and he’d have to go out to bat. Batting at No.4, Brian Lara is his worthy successor in this regard, especially when seen in light of the fact that West Indies had amongst the lowest average partnership runs for the first 2 wickets major test playing teams in this period. This meant that Lara had to come in early and consolidate. His contribution to the total team score (20.07%) is easily the highest for any batsman, followed by Rahul Dravid and Ricky Ponting.\n\nTeam Total Runs Best Batsman Runs Runs (%) Australia 35501 Ricky Ponting 6181 17.41% England 33797 Marcus Trescothick 4754 14.07% West Indies 27003 Brian Lara 5420 20.07% South Africa 27218 Jacques Kallis 4604 16.92% India 28464 Rahul Dravid 5003 17.58% Pakistan 23599 Mohammad Yousuf 4167 17.66% Sri Lanka 26045 Kumar Sangakkara 4013 15.41% New Zealand 20477 Stephen Fleming 2892 14.12% Bangladesh 14672 Habibul Bashar 2416 16.47% Zimbabwe 9871 Tatenda Taibu 1244 12.60%\n\nTable 3: Top Performing Batsmen (Nov’01-Nov’06).\n\nBrian Lara was also one of the most consistent batsmen in overseas matches. Keeping a cut off of 1000 runs, Lara’s average in overseas tests is a mighty 59.75, only Rahul Dravid, Mohammad Yousuf and Ricky Ponting have a better average than Lara’s. Also, only Rahul Dravid scored more overseas centuries (10) than Brian Lara’s 9.

Also, for players who have scored at-least 1000 runs in centuries, Brian Lara’s average century score (173.2) is only behind Don Bradman, Zaheer Abbas, Stephen Fleming and Virender Sehwag.\n\nPlayer Name Century Runs 100s Average Score Don Bradman 5393 29 185.97 Zaheer Abbas 2158 12 179.83 Stephen Fleming 1585 9 176.11 Virender Sehwag 3996 23 173.74 Brian Lara 5889 34 173.21 Seymour Nurse 1037 6 172.83 Brendon McCullum 2064 12 172.00 Dennis Amiss 1879 11 170.82 Frank Worrell 1530 9 170.00\n\nTable 5: Average Century Score\n\nLara’s relish for big scores translated to huge aggregates in series’ as well.

His first century was a majestic 277 vs Australia at Sydney (Lara named his daughter ‘Sydney’), which is the second highest score for a first career century after Gary Sobers’ 365 vs Pakistan (1958). Lara’s average vs Aus (51.00),for batsmen who scored a min 750 runs against them, is next only to Saeed Anwar, Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman (he just had to figure here, didn’t he!).\n\nPlayer Name Mtch Inns Runs Ave 100 50 Saeed Anwar 8 15 886 59.06 3 5 Sachin Tendulkar 21 39 1859 53.11 7 7 VVS Laxman 16 29 1457 52.03 4 6 Brian Lara 31 58 2856 51.00 9 11 Virender Sehwag 9 18 846 49.76 2 3 Richie Richardson 14 24 1084 49.27 4 4 Rahul Dravid 19 35 1503 48.48 2 8 Michael Vaughan 10 20 959 47.95 4 1 Graham Thorpe 16 31 1235 45.74 3 8 Aamer Sohail 9 17 767 45.11 2 4\n\nTable 7: Averages vs Australia (Dec’90-Nov’06)\n\nDropping the career span filter, Lara’s average comes down to being the 16th highest, but, his 9 centuries against them are joint 3rd highest after Jack Hobbs and Sachin Tendulkar.\n\nLara’s record against England is even more formidable, for batsmen who have scored at-least 750 runs versus England, Brian Lara’s average (62.14) is 6th highest overall, and 3rd highest for West Indies batsmen after George Headley and Viv Richards.\n\nPlayer Name Mtch Inns Runs Ave 100 50 Don Bradman 37 63 5028 89.78 19 12 George Headley 16 29 1852 71.23 8 5 Sid Barnes 9 14 846 70.5 2 4 Mohammad Yousuf 14 24 1499 62.45 6 3 Vivian Richards 36 50 2869 62.36 8 15 Brian Lara 30 51 2983 62.14 7 11 Colin Bland 8 16 858 61.28 2 5 Rahul Dravid 21 37 1950 60.93 7 8 Salim Malik 19 28 1396 60.69 4 9 Garry Sobers 36 61 3214 60.64 10 13\n\nTable 8: Averages vs England\n\nFor a majority of his career Brian Lara batted at No.4, his average (51.25) for batsmen who have scored at least 2000 runs at this position is 15th highest overall and second highest for a West Indies batsman after Sir Everton Weekes (63.62). His aggregate of runs at this position (7535) though, is next only to Sachin Tendulkar, Mahela Jayawardene, and Jacques Kallis.\n\nIt is while batting at No.3 though, that Lara’s numbers find few peers. Keeping the same cut-off as above, Brian Lara’s average (60.46) is next only to Don Bradman, Ken Barrington, Wally Hammond, George Headley, Viv Richards and Kumar Sangakkara.

He was at his peak as an ODI batsman in a 4 year period between 19 Feb 1993 and 12 Jan 1997. Lara topped the charts for aggregate runs and was daylights ahead of the second best Gary Kirsten in terms of batting average.\n\nPlayer Mtch Inns Runs Ave 100 50 Brian Lara 71 70 3495 57.29 11 18 Sachin Tendulkar 85 84 3380 44.47 10 19 Mark Waugh 82 82 3299 43.98 9 20 Saeed Anwar 82 82 3161 43.3 8 15 Aamer Sohail 90 89 3096 35.58 4 21 PA de Silva 88 86 3018 40.24 5 20 Inzamam-ul-Haq 86 82 2644 38.31 2 20 Mohammad Azharuddin 85 80 2633 41.79 0 19 Hansie Cronje 78 75 2494 37.22 2 16 Gary Kirsten 58 58 2425 47.54 7 10\n\nTable 10: Top ODI batsmen (Feb’93-Jan’97).\n\nBrian Lara’s characteristic as a genuine match-winner stamps itself strongly in the one-day format. Lara’s average of 61.82 in ODI wins is second highest for West Indies batsmen (after Ramnaresh Sarwan) and is bettered only by MS Dhoni, Hashim Amla, Virat Kohli, AB De Villiers, and Michael Bevan. That 5 of the 6 batsmen ahead of Brian Lara made their debuts in the relatively free scoring decade of 2000s points to Lara’s exceptional ability to play match-winning innings when scoring was curtailed by an array of quality pace and spin bowlers around the world.\n\nPlayer Mat Inns Runs Ave 100 50 MS Dhoni 150 126 5264 73.11 6 36 Hashim Amla 82 81 4984 68.27 20 24 Virat Kohli 99 95 4995 67.5 21 19 AB de Villiers 125 120 6050 67.22 20 34 Michael Bevan 155 122 4502 65.24 5 32 Ramnaresh Sarwan 79 71 2917 62.06 4 18 Brian Lara 139 134 6553 61.82 16 42 Martin Crowe 61 60 2694 59.86 4 21 Paul Collingwood 92 81 2955 57.94 5 15 Martin Guptill 68 68 3298 57.85 8 21\n\nTable 11: Average in ODI wins\n\nIn an era when Shahid Afridi and Sanath Jayasuriya were tearing apart record books with their frantic and daring stroke play; vs Bangladesh at Kuala Lumpur in 1999, Brian Lara scored the then second fastest ODI century of all time, off 45 balls.\n\nThe majesty of Brian Lara’s stroke play was described best by Tony Cozier in one sentence. While executing a scorching cover drive off Makhaya Ntini en route his 202 vs South Africa at Wanderers in 2003, cozier remarked:\n\n‘Oh Glorious, now that’s the difference between Chanderpaul and Lara, that bat came from above his head and finished up above his head’.\n\nLara’s brilliance put him on a different pedestal altogether, at full flow (or even less than that) Brian Lara made other batsmen look like what Neville Cardus exclaimed for Ranjitsinghji’s batting: ‘Plebeians toiling in the Sun’.\n\nThe year was 1962, 30 since India had gained international status and it had won only 8 out of the 79 test matches that it had played till then. Bad.\n\nOn a tour of West Indies and up against a pair of fearsome fast bowlers in Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith. Worse!\n\nThe tragic death of Philip Hughes from a blow to the head gathered international headlines and sympathy, a little known incident on the aforementioned tour could have also ended on a similarly unfortunate note. India’s skipper Nari Contractor was facing up against the fierce Charlie Griffith in a first class match against Barbados and a rising ball hit him on the back of his skull. Frank Worrell, the West Indies captain, was the first to donate blood for the blood transfusion which ultimately saved Contractor’s life. He didn’t play test cricket again, but for sure was fortunate enough to tell his tale (Contractor is 82, and assuredly heading towards a century).\n\nWest Indian fast bowlers have had a history of causing as much harm to the batsman as to the stumps. The killer jolts they’ve dealt to batsmen has, more than anything else, become their enduring legacy.\n\nBut, something else happened in 1962. The year marks the birth of Courtney Andrew Walsh, who was to remain in the shadow of bulkier contemporaries for the majority of his career much because he didn’t quite fit into the West Indian fast bowler stereotype. Nothing is more representative of Walsh’s persona than this image. Skirting through the crowd on the final day of the Oval Test (2000), Walsh is seen towering over everybody else, and yet somehow appears to be a benign presence.\n\nHe remains perhaps the most underrated West Indies fast bowler ever (disagreements are welcome), despite having breached the following milestones in a glittering 17 year career:\n\nOvertook Malcolm Marshall as West Indies’ highest wicket taker. (vs South Africa at Johannesburg, 1998)\n\nBecame the first West Indian bowler to take 400 test wickets (vs Australia at Port of Spain, 1999)\n\nOvertook Kapil Dev’s tally of 434 test wickets to become the most prolific bowler in Test match History (vs Pakistan at Georgetown, 2000).\n\nBecame the first bowler in Test History to take 500 Test match wickets (vs South Africa at Port of Spain, 2001).\n\nCourtney Walsh’s career can be divided in two parts, from 9 Nov 1984-23 Apr 1993, when he operated exclusively as a second/third change fast bowler for the West Indies, and from 1 May 1993-19 Apr 2001, when he formed along with Curtly Ambrose, one of the most successful new ball partnerships of all time. Walsh’s transition from a change to a strike bowler is absolutely remarkable, considering that he was already 32 years old when handed the new ball. At an age when most fast bowlers are past their prime, Walsh turned his could-have-been-not-so good fate on its head to become one of the leading bowlers in the world till his retirement.\n\nWalsh’s stats reveal a remarkable transition, not only did he take more wickets per match (4.3 as against 3.46), but conceded lower number of runs per wicket, lesser runs per over, and took more than 3 times the number of 5-fors as he did before.\n\nSpan Mtch Wkts Ave Eco S/R 5W 9 Nov 1984 – 23 Mar 1993 58 201 25.17 2.63 57.5 5 1 May 1993 – 19 Apr 2001 74 318 23.98 2.47 58.1 17\n\nTable 1: Walsh career break-up\n\nA more nuanced analysis of his record vs all test playing nations better illustrates the brilliance of Walsh. By using the same break-up as above, Walsh’s numbers across major bowling parameters: Wickets per match, Average and Strike Rate, improved against all test playing nations apart from India (surprising isn’t it?). This given that he had a great tour to India in 1987/88 where he was the highest wicket taker from either sides. Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe have been excluded from this analysis as Walsh didn’t play that much against them, and hence his numbers look either excessively shrunk, or exaggerated.\n\nWickets per match Average Strike Rate Opp. Nov’84- Apr’93 May’93- Apr’01 Diff.

In the 50 matches they opened the bowling in (8 Apr 1994-31 Aug 2000), they took a combined 418 wickets. Walsh was easily the more prolific of the two, claiming almost 50 wickets more than Ambrose. Also, more number of 5-fors and 10-fors add further cement to Walsh’s superiority as a penetrative new ball bowler.\n\nPlayer Name Mtch Runs Wkts Avg Econ 5W 10W Courtney Walsh 50 5174 233 22.2 2.52 11 2 Curtly Ambrose 50 3952 185 21.3 2.27 14 0\n\nTable 4: Walsh vs Ambrose (May’93-Aug’00)\n\nThe one thing that makes Walsh stand out from the rest is his stamina and consistency. As has already been mentioned, Walsh was given the new ball only when he was 32 years old and continued bowling from that position till he retired at 39. Walsh, to this day, is only behind two Australians (Clarrie Grimmett and Shane Warne) in terms of number wickets taken after attaining the age of 35. His average is also only behind Sydney Barnes and Richard Hadlee. If the benchmark is filtered to include only fast bowlers, Walsh is ahead of the second placed Richard Hadlee by daylight. It is a shame that his services to the West Indies team were of so little avail during these years as they won only 10 of the 40 matches they played.\n\nPlayer Name Mtch Runs Wkts Ave Eco 5W Clarrie Grimmett 33 4735 192 24.66 2.16 18 Shane Warne 33 4570 181 25.24 2.97 10 Courtney Walsh 39 3890 180 21.61 2.29 9 Anil Kumble 35 5155 154 33.47 3.03 6 Sydney Barnes 18 2058 139 14.8 2.36 18 Muttiah Muralidaran 23 3531 126 28.02 2.88 10 Richard Hadlee 23 2482 116 21.39 2.63 11 Lance Gibbs 29 3232 100 32.32 1.96 5 Rangana Herath 21 2986 97 30.78 2.8 7 Arthur Mailey 19 3158 93 33.95 3.24 6\n\nTable 5: Top wicket-takers after the age of 35\n\nNot only was Walsh pushing his body and stamina to the limit, he was also bearing the brunt of wicket taking disproportionate to it. From 30 Oct 1997 to 19 Apr 2001, Walsh took almost 32% of all wickets taken by West Indian bowlers. Only Muttiah Muralidaran (35%) took a higher percentage of wickets than Walsh in this period. Among fast bowlers, Walsh is leading by a big margin as Shaun Pollock (25.9%) is a distant second. But there was a certain Allan Donald who operated in tandem with him didn’t he?\n\nCountry Highest Wicket Taker Wkts Team Wkts % West Indies Courtney Walsh 180 591 30.46% Pakistan Saqlain Mushtaq 98 526 18.63% Australia Glenn Mcgrath 171 707 24.19% New Zealand Chris Cairns 102 463 22.03% India Anil Kumble 108 414 26.09% Sri Lanka Muttiah Muralidaran 185 516 35.85% England Darren Gough 112 541 20.70% South Africa Shaun Pollock 191 737 25.92% Zimbabwe Health Streak 71 300 23.67%\n\nTable 6: Most Effective wicket takers (Oct’97-Apr’01)\n\nDennis Waight, the physio of the West Indies team during Kerry Packer’s World Series cricket, once said that if Walsh stops bowling, he’ll never bowl again. Walsh often gave an impression that he could bowl for as long as his captain and the situation demanded. It is only fitting that he bowled the maximum number of balls for any fast bowler, he is followed by Glenn Mcgrath and the indefatigable Kapil Dev. In fact, Walsh bowled an absolutely mind boggling 1, 07,324 balls in top class cricket, easily the most by any fast bowler in history.\n\nPlayer Name Balls Bowled Courtney Walsh 30019 Glenn Mcgrath 29248 Kapil Dev 27740 James Anderson 25185 Shaun Pollock 24353 Chaminda Vaas 23438 Wasim Akram 22627 Curtly Ambrose 22103 Richard Hadlee 21918 Ian Botham 21815\n\nTable 7: Most balls bowled by pace bowlers (Test Matches)\n\nPlacid and unresponsive Asian wickets are often considered tough to bowl on for Fast Bowlers. A below par performance in the few tests Dennis Lillee played in the subcontinent is perhaps the only question mark on his otherwise brilliant career numbers. But not so for Walsh. Not only is he the most successful overseas fast bowler on Asian wickets, his average is also bettered only by a fellow West Indian in Wes Hall. Not surprisingly, there are three West Indian quickies on this list.\n\nPlayer Name Mtch Wkts Ave Courtney Walsh 17 77 20.53 Dale Steyn 16 76 20.8 Malcolm Marshall 19 71 23.05 Richard Hadlee 13 68 21.58 Shaun Pollock 17 60 23.18 Glenn Mcgrath 16 58 25.96 Wes Hall 11 54 20.05 Jason Gillespie 13 51 22.86 Matthew Hoggard 14 50 28.22\n\nTable 8: Best pace bowlers in Asia\n\nTo top it all, in a first class career that spanned from 1981 to 2001, Walsh ended up being the highest non-English wicket taker of all time. He is followed by Malcolm Marshall, Intikhab Alam (the highest placed Asian on all time the list) and Bishen Bedi (Highest placed Indian on the all-time list!). That the top 10 list is dominated by presence of 6 spinners, illustrates the fitness and willpower Walsh possessed to excel at every level of the game.\n\nPlayer Name Wkts Courtney Walsh 1807 Malcolm Marshall 1651 Intikhab Alam 1571 Bishen Bedi 1560 Richard Hadlee 1490 Clarrie Grimmett 1424 Mike Procter 1417 Mushtaq Ahmed 1404 S. Venkataraghavan 1390 Muttiah Muralidaran 1374\n\nTable 9: Most first-class wickets\n\nThe omission of Courtney Walsh in debates on deciding the greatest fast bowler is mainly due to his being the spearhead of a weak test side during his peak years. He didn’t run through batting line-ups single handedly like a Curtly Ambrose, but through sheer consistency and stamina, he did run through the record books.\n\n(Note: This article was first published by this author on Sportskeeda.)\n\nThe January edition of ESPN Cricinfo’s digital magazine Cricket Monthly carried a special coverage on the top 50 individual performances in test cricket from 1966 onwards to the present day. Predictably, Viv Richards, Gary Sobers and Brian Lara figure on that list and so do Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralidaran. The names are deserving enough to make this, or any, list of individual brilliance compiled by any cricket lover or expert around the world.\n\nBut i was left a little bemused at the exclusion of Dean Jones’ 210 vs India played in the tied test in Madras (1986). Batting under the scorching Chennai sun, Jones vomited multiple times besides the pitch, urinated in his flannels, and ended up in a hospital on a saline drip by the time his 8 hour marathon ended.\n\nAnd i was a little more bemused to find out that this innings, which the then coach of Australia Bob Simpson described as ‘one of the gutsiest innings ever played’, is expended for the inclusion of Sanath Jayasuriya’s 340 vs India, Brian Lara record breaking 375 & 400 vs England, and Viv Richards’ 291 vs England. All of these innings were played in dead tests or dead rubbers whereas the tied test match heralded a new era in Australian cricket, it began their quest to become the leading test playing nation in the world.\n\nJust one of the many instances where romance for visceral thrills was preferred over the real substance of the performance.\n\nNavjot Singh Sidhu’s biggest contribution to Indian Cricket, as is often said, was when his illness allowed Sachin Tendulkar to open the batting for India in an ODI vs New Zealand in 1994. Tendulkar smacked 82 from 49 balls, and claimed that spot till the day he retired 18 years later. A batsman who was arguably one of the biggest match winners of his day (as the analysis would bring out), for his legacy to be reduced to being a pedestal for his more storied batting partner’s climb to immortality is indeed a shame.\n\nMy father once bowled to him during the Ranji Trophy trials in Patiala in 1981, he remembers Sidhu as a batsman who was solid in defence, but lacked strokes. Dubbed as a stroke-less wonder after his international debut in 1983, Sidhu returned in the 1987 world cup as an attacking opening bat with a special relish for Spinners. From then on, he never looked back.\n\nTEST MATCHES\n\nSidhu was at his peak as a batsman between 11 Feb 1993 and 25 Mar 1998, during which he averaged an astonishing 59.56, and only Tendulkar (64.13) and Steve Waugh (61.10) averaged more than him. Curiously, out of the 8 batsmen who averaged more than 50 in this period, 4 are Indians. Sidhu was also, by a distance, the best opening batsmen in this period, averaging almost 10 points more than the next placed Sanath Jayasuriya.\n\nHis most notable innings during this period include his six studded 124 vs Sri Lanka at Lucknow (1994) where he took Muralidaran to the cleaners, the 11 hour marathon 201 vs West Indies at POS (1997), and four consecutive fifties in the 1998 Border Gavaskar series, where he and Tendulkar took Warne and Australia apart with their attacking stroke play.\n\nPlayer Name Mat Inn Runs Avg 100 50 Sachin Tendulkar 39 58 3335 64.13 12 13 Steve Waugh 54 86 4155 61.1 10 25 Navjot Sidhu 27 37 2204 59.56 7 11 Vinod Kambli 16 19 1050 55.26 4 3 Brian Lara 47 79 3954 52.02 9 19 Rahul Dravid 22 35 1643 51.34 1 15 Saurav Ganguly 20 31 1483 51.13 5 5 Jimmy Adams 29 46 1866 50.43 5 8\n\nTable 1: Top Batsmen (Feb’93-Oct’98)\n\nPlayer Name Mat Inn Runs Avg 100 50 Navjot Sidhu 25 35 2130 60.85 7 11 Sanath Jayasuriya 18 31 1534 51.13 4 7 Saeed Anwar 30 49 2242 46.7 5 16 Michael Slater 37 65 2817 45.43 7 11 Alec Stewart 31 52 2175 42.64 4 12 Michael Atherton 57 104 4083 40.83 8 25 Mark Taylor 59 101 3772 40.12 10 19\n\nTable 2: Top Opening Batsmen (Feb’93-Mar’98)\n\nA remarkable aspect of Sidhu’s form during this period is his sheer consistency. In the 10 test series he played, he averaged more than 50 in 7 of them and, quite amazingly, never averaged below 37 in any of them. Also, 7 of his 9 career centuries came during this period\n\nSome of Sidhu’s bravest innings came in the period that preceded his peak as a batsman. In the 1989 Sialkot test vs Pakistan (Yes, the one where Waqar hit Sachin on the jaw), India had nearly given away their 74 run first innings lead tottering at 4-38. Sidhu’s 97 was not only the top score of the match but was also instrumental in India averting a defeat and hence for the first time ever, a series was drawn in Pakistan.\n\nAlso worth a mention is his 116 vs West Indies at Kingston, 1989 against the pace battery of Marshall, Ambrose, Walsh and Patterson in a match where no Indian batsman scored more than 47. A lost cause eventually, but a gutsy performance.\n\nSidhu, throughout his career, was a match winner second to none. For batsmen who scored more than 1000 runs in team wins during his career span, Sidhu’s average is next only to Steve Waugh, Graham Gooch, Shoaib Mohammad and Jimmy Adams. He is also the only Indian batsman apart from Sachin Tendulkar to average more than 60 in wins.\n\nPlayer Name Mat Inn Runs Avg 100 50 Steve Waugh 45 64 3914 83.27 14 18 Graham Gooch 17 30 2273 78.37 9 4 Shoaib Mohammad 12 18 1055 75.35 3 5 Jimmy Adams 15 21 1051 70.06 3 5 Navjot Sidhu 13 18 1179 69.35 4 7 Saeed Anwar 16 25 1651 68.79 5 10 Inzamam-Ul-Haq 21 33 1745 67.11 5 10 Sachin Tendulkar 16 24 1268 63.4 4 7 Martin Crowe 14 23 1179 62.05 2 7 Michael Slater 23 38 2138 61.08 8 6\n\nTable 3: Average in test wins (1983-1999).\n\nSidhu toured England and Australia only once in his career and fared badly in each of them. But what must be noted is that he made those tours in 1990 and 1992 respectively, which was a period when he had not yet found the batsman in him. He declined to tour England in 1996 owing to differences with Mohammad Azharuddin, who knows what numbers he would have gathered had he opted to go.\n\nONE DAY INTERNATIONALS\n\nSidhu’s personality and his performances played out with a little more flair in ODIs than in test matches. Making his one day debut vs Australia in the 1987 world cup, he started off with a bang with 4 consecutive fifties and continued this rich vein of form for the next 2 years to complete 1000 ODI runs in just 25 innings. To this day, Sidhu remains the third fastest Indian to score 1000 ODI runs (25 innings) after Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan (24 each).\n\nSidhu was in his peak form between 9 Oct 1987 and 14 Apr 1995. Amongst batsmen who scored more than 2000 runs in ODIs, Sidhu was the highest averaging Indian, and had the third best overall average after Dean Jones and Geoff Marsh.\n\nPlayer Name Mat Inn Runs Avg 100 50 S/R Dean Jones 119 117 4644 45.98 4 39 70.19 Geoff Marsh 80 78 3178 44.13 7 18 55.53 Navjot Sidhu 91 87 3446 43.62 5 28 71.22 Brian Lara 84 83 3313 43.59 5 25 73.58 Desmond Haynes 116 116 4319 41.52 9 29 65.02 Inzamam-ul-Haq 87 85 2981 41.4 4 21 73.82 Martin Crowe 80 79 2811 41.33 2 21 71.83 Robin Smith 64 63 2218 40.32 4 13 70.34\n\nTable 4: Top ODI batsmen from Oct’87-Apr’95.\n\nSidhu was also striking the ball at a decent rate, scoring 71 runs per 100 balls which not only compares well with the batsmen listed in the table but is also well placed amongst all major batsmen of that time. Also, 5 of his 6 ODI centuries came during this period.\n\nPressing his stature as a genuine match winner, throughout his career, no one averaged more than Sidhu in matches that India won, apart from Sachin Tendulkar. Keeping the same cut-off as above, Sidhu emerges as one of 8 batsmen who averaged more than 50 in wins. He and Tendulkar, in fact, are the only Indian Batsmen who average more than 50 in this case. The scenario is a little different when the cut-off runs are reduced to 1000, but it doesn’t diminish his contribution one bit.\n\nIf the same statistic is seen for peak years, Sidhu’s numbers are remarkable. Only Martin Crowe averages more than Sidhu in wins followed by Brian Lara and Dean Jones.\n\nPlayer Name Mat Inn Runs Avg 100 50 Martin Crowe 36 36 1702 65.46 2 14 Navjot Sidhu 52 50 2448 58.28 4 21 Brian Lara 46 45 2207 58.07 5 16 Dean Jones 79 78 3540 55.31 4 30 Inzamam-ul-Haq 48 46 1908 54.51 3 13 Mohammad Azharuddin 72 64 2213 50.29 1 14 Sachin Tendulkar 51 49 1963 49.07 4 14 Desmond Haynes 67 67 2796 49.05 8 16 Andrew Jones 40 40 1614 48.9 0 17\n\nTable 5: Average in Team Wins (Oct’87-Apr’95)\n\nSidhu was also remarkably consistent when it came to contributing in team wins at overseas and neutral venues. Amongst Indian batsmen, his average (49.28) is bettered only by Saurav Ganguly (68.71) and Sachin Tendulkar (60.23). His average is 11th highest on an overall basis though, not bad at all when you see the names that follow him.\n\nSidhu was also amongst the top batsmen in Sharjah, which had become the center of the ODI action in the late 80s and all of the 90s. Although Sachin made the venue his own in 1998, Sidhu was amongst the top performing batsmen in Sharjah during his career span. A significant finding given that India won only 16 out of the 38 matches it played there.\n\nPlayer Name Mat Inn Runs Avg 100 50 Sachin Tendulkar 28 28 1260 50.40 4 6 Saeed Anwar 36 36 1553 45.67 7 4 Inzamam Ul Haq 28 28 1096 45.66 1 8 Saleem Malik 45 39 1462 43.00 3 9 Navjot Sidhu 32 32 1225 40.83 2 8 Aamer Sohail 25 25 960 40.00 2 6 Rameez Raja 24 24 787 35.77 2 3 Roshan Mahanama 30 29 888 34.15 1 5 Aravinda De Silva 35 35 1123 34.03 1 7\n\nTable 6: Top Batsmen at Sharjah (Oct’87-Sep’98).\n\nSidhu’s antics in the media seem to have overshadowed his performances on the cricket field. His ebullient and extrovert demeanor belie his keen observation of the game that allowed him to come back into the Indian team in 1987 and cement his place as one of India’s most consistent performers for a better part of the next decade. One has to look deeper into the numbers to truly understand the sheer match winning capabilities of this glorious cricketer.\n\nP.S. The numbers analysis was inspired by a statistical analysis of Sidhu here.\n\nNo Indian cricketer, in our living memory, has evoked as much awe and romanticism as Sachin Tendulkar. His essence is captured best in an article published in The Times of India by C.P.Surendran, a day after his Sharjah blitz, on April 26, 1998, an excerpt from which reads as follows:\n\n“The poor Indian lifts his hands to Sachin Tendulkar in supplication: give us respite, a sense of liberation; lift us up from the dark pit of our lives to well-lit places of the imagination with your skill-wrought perfections.”\n\nThrough this backdrop, you must be thinking I’ve given you the answer to the question of who was chosen as India’s cricketer of the century by Wisden India in 2002.\n\nIt was Kapil Dev Ramlal Nikhanj.\n\nYou must also be thinking as to why the heck be an article on Kapil Dev beginning with a typically Indian adulation of Sachin Tendulkar.\n\nIt is to make a point. The point is that I wish cricket got appropriate coverage a decade earlier than it did, only then could have we truly realized the value and meaning of being Kapil Dev, a man who bowled fast in an era when, at times, Sunil Gavaskar used to open the bowling for India, bowling a token 3-4 overs before the spinners came on. Gavaskar himself remembers with relish the experience of watching Kapil’s deliveries thud into Syed Kirmani’s gloves during his debut vs Pakistan in 1978/79.\n\nAnd Kapil far surpassed this one moment of glory, he retired in 1994 as cricket’s most prolific wicket-taker (687) until overtaken by Wasim Akram.\n\nNow I’ll get to the numbers.\n\nKapil Dev took 434 wickets in 131 test matches, his average of 3.3 wickets per test is lower than most prominent fast bowlers of his era. By his own admission, after breaching the 300 wicket mark, Kapil started focusing on his match-fitness rather than his bowling per se because he had his sights set on overtaking Richard Hadlee’s tally of 431 wickets.\n\nBut what often gets overlooked, is a nuanced analysis of Kapil when he was at the peak of his bowling prowess. Between 12 July 1979 and 12 Nov 1983, Kapil Dev was the cream of the crop, taking wickets at a regularity which was mind boggling.\n\nNot only was Kapil Dev the highest wicket taker during the period in consideration, he also took 5 wickets or more in an innings with a remarkable regularity. His Inns-per-5 wkts ratio of 4.44 was bettered only by Richard Hadlee (3.8) and Imran Khan (4.28).\n\nKeeping a cut-off of min 50 inns, Kapil has the best ratio by a distance, followed by Dennis Lillee (6.3), Ian Botham (6.7) and Dilip Doshi (9.2).\n\nNot only this, Kapil Strike Rate (52.3) was also bettered only by Imran Khan (43.4), Geoff Lawson (50.0), Len Pascoe (51.8), and Malcolm Marshall (51.8).\n\nPlayer Name Mtch Inns Runs Wkts Avg S/R 5W Inns/5W Kapil Dev 50 80 5657 214 26.43 52.3 18 4.4 Ian Botham 46 80 5250 190 27.63 57.3 12 6.7 Dennis Lillee 34 63 3925 165 23.78 51.8 10 6.3 Imran Khan 27 47 2292 139 16.48 43.4 11 4.3 Bob Willis 36 65 3357 134 25.05 52.4 5 13.0 Dilip Doshi 33 55 3502 114 30.71 81.7 6 9.2 Michael Holding 26 49 2697 112 24.08 52.9 6 8.2 Bruce Yardley 22 38 2930 99 29.59 63.9 6 6.3 Joel Garner 25 47 1978 93 21.26 60.6 2 23.5 Sir Richard Hadlee 18 34 1939 93 20.84 53.5 9 3.8 Iqbal Qasim 23 40 2312 86 26.88 72.2 4 10.0 Colin Croft 20 38 2067 83 24.9 54.5 2 19.0 Lance Cairns 18 34 1842 68 27.08 69.2 4 8.5 Malcolm Marshall 17 32 1626 67 24.26 51.8 1 32.0 Terry Alderman 16 29 1890 66 28.63 62.2 4 7.3 Andy Roberts 18 34 1728 63 27.42 62.5 2 17.0 Geoff Lawson 14 25 1504 62 24.25 50 5 5.0 Abdul Qadir 17 29 2012 56 35.92 73.9 2 14.5 Ravi Shastri 24 34 2100 56 37.5 96.4 2 17.0 Geoff Dymock 13 21 1258 53 23.73 55.1 4 5.3 Jeff Thomson 17 30 1627 52 31.28 58.4 2 15.0 Len Pascoe 11 22 1305 51 25.58 50.5 1 22.0 Karsan Ghavri 21 36 2087 50 41.74 81.6 2 18.0\n\nQualification: Minimum 50 wickets.\n\nThe period in consideration includes some of his most memorable spells like: 5/28 vs Australia, Melbourne (1981 – had taken pain killers to subdue a thigh injury to hand India a rare overseas victory), 8/85 vs Pakistan, Lahore (1982/83- Conjured a magical opening spell which effectively ended Majid Khan’s test career), 9/83 vs West Indies, Ahmedabad (1983/84 – Dismissed the much vaunted West Indies’ batting for 281).\n\nFor a more detailed analysis of his overall stats, click here.\n\nKapil Dev would have my vote if Wisden, or any cricket body, carries out a similar exercise today.
