        "text": "Preamble Morning etc. First the good news: England can still win this series. Now the bad news: they probably won't. Pakistan have won the toss in the fourth one-day international at Rawalpindi, and have decided to bat first on the most verdant greentop you've ever seen. Only kidding: it's flat as a roti. Expect another total of 300-plus followed by an abject England collapse.\n\n5.50am My taxi driver had a useful machine which beeped whenever we were approaching a speed camera. I've never seen one of those before. Are they legal? Anyway, Steve Harmison has a spot of flu, so Kabir Ali gets a start, with James Anderson as sub and Ian Bell moved off the bench into the middle order. Pakistan are as you were, except that Arshad Khan rather than Yasir Arafat is the supersub. England are 2-1 down, but need to win the series to avoid having to play some fatuous round-robin qualifiers ahead of next autumn's Champions Trophy in India. So, yes, this game does matter.\n\n5.59am Marcus Trescothick gathers his troops in the customary huddle. Little good will it do them...\n\n1st over: Pakistan 2-0 (Salman Butt 2, Kamran Akmal 0) Andrew Flintoff opens the bowling for England to Salman Butt, but it's the man at the other end who will be worrying Trescothick more: Kamran Akmal is today hoping to become only the third player to score three successive one-day hundreds. Butt gets going with a push for two off his hip from the last ball of a tight over.\n\n2nd over: Pakistan 6-0 (Salman Butt 2, Kamran Akmal 4) Anderson takes the new ball at the other end, which means England have already enforced their supersub. Poor old Bell misses out after batting neatly during the defeat at Karachi. What a farce this rule is. Anderson's fourth ball is short and Akmal leans back to force him square on the off-side for four: shot! \"I was just wondering why they scheduled this game for Monday and not the weekend,\" says Greg Morley. \"Might it be for the benefit of OBO followers, some of whom would have been in bed nursing hangovers had it been on Saturday or Sunday? Has OBO coverage become that important that it can influence the scheduling of matches?\"\n\n3rd over: Pakistan 6-0 (Salman Butt 2, Kamran Akmal 4) Another good over from Flintoff, who pointed out the other day that he only has to bowl 20 more overs before putting his feet up for Christmas. Well, it's just 18 now, Freddie, after that maiden. Good stuff.\n\n4th over: Pakistan 7-0 (Salman Butt 2, Kamran Akmal 5) Akmal pushes Anderson's first ball down the ground for a single, but this is a tidy start for both of England's bowlers, and Butt is forced into a pull shot that wasn't there. The ball dribbles off his pads into the off-side - for no runs! \"England shouldn't win this series as they have manifested little brain,\" says Richard Jones.\n\n5th over: Pakistan 11-0 (Salman Butt 2, Kamran Akmal 9) I'm guessing that Pakistan have decided to see off the early overs, presumably because this is the only time of day when the bowlers get any assistance. Still, this is a vast improvement on the previous three games, when England's new-ball bowlers disappeared all over the place. Akmal keeps picking out off-side fielders as he goes on the drive against Flintoff. And he would have had a wicket if Trescothick had kept a first slip in place: that last ball was edged fine of the keeper for four! Unbelievable!\n\n6th over: Pakistan 23-0 (Salman Butt 14, Kamran Akmal 9) Trescothick had moved himself to a kind of third/fourth slip in that last over, which seems strange given that it was only the fifth of the innings. That would have been a huge wicket for England. Instead, there's new belief in this Pakistan innings and Butt takes three fours off that Anderson over: a flick for four off his pads, a drive through extra-cover off the slower ball, then a pull for four. Absolute drivel from Anderson.\n\n7th over: Pakistan 27-0 (Salman Butt 14, Kamran Akmal 13) Flintoff drags one down and Akmal throws everything at it outside off-stump: that's the fifth four in eight balls. But Flintoff recovers very well indeed. \"Has poor old Bell acquired the \"Neil Fairbrother\" in reverse?\" wonders Aaron Richardson. \"Check out his one day average, it's over 37; this man needs a year in both sides to prove he is our saviour.\"\n\n8th over: Pakistan 27-0 (Salman Butt 14, Kamran Akmal 13) That's better stuff from Anderson, although I'm still not sure he's the answer to England's new-ball problems. Anyway, we shouldn't grumble about that maiden. Faraz Hasan writes in to point out that Akmal is hoping to become the fourth batsman - not the third, as I wrote - to score three one-day hundreds in a row. The others, as if you need telling, are Herschelle Gibbs, Saeed Anwar and Zaheer Abbas. Thanks, Faraz.\n\n9th over: Pakistan 28-0 (Salman Butt 14, Kamran Akmal 14) So far Pakistan have threatened to break free only once, during an eight-ball passage in which they flayed five fours. Otherwise England have bowled really well: only an Akmal single in that over. Some helpful advice lands from my former colleague Alex Brown, who is now back where he belongs in Australia. \"Type faster!\" jeers Brown, who I can imagine now sunning himself in Sydney with a beer in one hand and a, er, beer in the other. Happy Christmas mate!\n\n10th over: Pakistan 32-0 (Salman Butt 14, Kamran Akmal 18) Did you know that a \"man date\" is a \"platonic date between two heterosexual men\"? No, nor did I, but I now know that I'm a serial man dater, which doesn't sit entirely comfortably. Anderson gets away with a couple of loose deliveries which Akmal pummels straight to the fielders, but the last ball is the longest of hops which Akmal pulls high for four. Even so, I wonder how easy the timing is on this pitch. I'm also guessing that it won't get any easier.\n\nApologies for the delay: at the very moment my keyboard decides to stop working, Pakistan lose two wickets in two balls! Details to follow.\n\nWICKET! Kamran Akmal b Anderson 18 (34-3) Carnage! And I can't keep up. Anderson sneaks a slower ball through Akmal's defences and Pakistan are falling to pieces.\n\n12th over: Pakistan 34-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 0, Inzamam-ul-Haq 0) Right, about those first two wickets. Salman Butt was run out for 15 thanks to a brilliant dive and thrown by Vikram Solanki in the covers. And Younis Khan was bowled first ball by Flintoff as he tried to leave one alone outside off: the ball ricocheted on to leg-stump. And that was a wicket maiden!\n\n13th over: Pakistan 38-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 3, Inzamam-ul-Haq 1) Pakistan lost three wickets there without adding a run. Amazing stuff. On comes Liam Plunkett, and England know that another quick wicket and they will be right on top. It all came as a result of the pressure built up by Flintoff and Anderson - something which England's new-ball bowlers had until then failed to do in the series. Here's Dave Langlois. \"Among all the talk about \"post-Ashes euphoria\" and other undermining mindsets, little mention has been made of the underestimation of this cracking Pakistan team. The batting line up is frightening; the bowling line up is intimidating, headed by a Shoaib Akhtar on song. On paper, man for man and in this form, they are simply and overwhelmingly the better team aren't they?\"\n\n14th over: Pakistan 38-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 3, Inzamam-ul-Haq 1) According to Ben Schott (the Almanac man), \"body spam\" is \"undesirable physical contact by strangers, such as that suffered by waitresses, or commuters on buses or the Underground.\" Well there you have it. And that's a maiden for Anderson. Great stuff from England! A word of warning from the ever-watchful Richard Jones. \"In Australia we see our enemy in 18 months knock up over 500 for 8 in the second innings against no meagre opposition.\"\n\n15th over: Pakistan 42-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 7, Inzamam-ul-Haq 1) Plunkett has immediately settled into a good line outside off-stu... hang on, that's a rubbish ball as Yousuf collects four runs to fine leg. England can't afford to release the pressure.\n\n16th over: Pakistan 47-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 7, Inzamam-ul-Haq 6) It's Power Play 3, and Inzamam responds by flick-pulling the first ball of a new over from Anderson over square-leg for four. That was a supreme piece of timing, but Inzamam would have been run out moments later had Paul Collingwood hit the stumps from backward point at the non-striker's end. England are looking sharp out there.\n\n17th over: Pakistan 52-3 (Mohammad Yousuf 11, Inzamam-ul-Haq 7) Inzamam's legendary ability to read a pitch and bat accordingly will be tested to the full here. Pakistan might need him to be there after 50 overs if they are going to secure the series today. He's cautious against Plunkett before moving across his stumps to shovel a single to midwicket. The notion that Inzy has a weakness playing round his front pad hasn't really been backed up in this series. Yousuf then leg-glances Plunkett fine for four: he loves that shot, especially in the one-day game.\n\nWICKET! Mohammad Yousuf lbw b Kabir Ali 11 (58-4) Kabir Ali strikes in his first international over of the tour! Yousuf plays round one that straightens and hits him on the back pad in front of middle. Yousuf looks disgusted with the decision, but I'm fairly sure there was no inside edge there. England are in business.\n\n18th over: Pakistan 58-4 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 12, Shoaib Malik 0) Kabir's first ball was pulled for four by Inzy, but the rest of the over was spot on.\n\n19th over: Pakistan 63-4 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 16, Shoaib Malik 0) Dare I say that at this stage England are actually favourites? Having said that, Inzamam eases into a half-volley from Plunkett and sends it down the ground for four. Lovely shot!\n\n20th over: Pakistan 67-4 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 20, Shoaib Malik 0) There's still the Shahid Afridi effect to factor into this equation, and Abdul Razzaq, who smashed a 22-ball half-century in Karachi, is still to come too. But for the time being England will be absolutely thrilled with their start, especially after losing their first toss of the series and being invited to bowl. But England keep drifting onto the pads, and Inzamam picks up four runs as Kabir Ali loses his line. Otherwise that was another probing over.\n\n21st over: Pakistan 70-4 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 22, Shoaib Malik 1) Ian Blackwell and his barrel-chested left-arm spin enter the fray and Shoaib Malik gets off the mark with a push to leg for one. Inzamam sweeps for two and is then beaten outside off by one that creeps through as he aims to cut.\n\n22nd over: Pakistan 75-4 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 24, Shoaib Malik 3) The good news for England is that these two won't be able to take too many risks for the next 10 overs or so. The bad news for everyone else is that this could be quite tedious.\n\n23rd over: Pakistan 83-4 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 30, Shoaib Malik 5) What England can't afford to do is allow Pakistan to milk six runs an over for the next 15. This will be a good test of their wicket-taking ability in the middle overs. Blackwell goes over the wicket, then round it, but there are easy singles off the first four balls before Inzamam pulls a long-hop for four. Blackwell turns the next ball past his outside edge - a ripper.\n\n24th over: Pakistan 86-4 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 31, Shoaib Malik 7) Kabir concedes singles off the first two balls of that over, then gets away with a blatant leg-side wide. Thanks very much, Rudi Koertzen! Just three off that over.\n\n25th over: Pakistan 91-4 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 32, Shoaib Malik 11) Blackwell stays round the wicket to Shoaib Malik, who tucks the second ball to square-leg for one. England are in the unusual position of dictating terms with the ball, which they haven't done on this tour on a consistent basis since the first Test at Multan. Even so, Shoaib dabs him late for two, then steers a single into the covers. We're halfway through the overs, and England will be very pleased with life.\n\n26th over: Pakistan 95-4 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 33, Shoaib Malik 13) Well, I'm sensing that the Monday blues have kicked in the world over because my inbox has been failing to vibrate with the pitter-patter of incoming messages for the last 20 minutes or so. Go on, you know you want to. Meanwhile, Kabir continues, safe in the knowledge that Pakistan are not going to look to take him apart for the time being. A no-ball is precisely what he shouldn't be bowling under the circumstances. But the next one is very interesting indeed: what the Aussies call a mollygrubber.\n\n27th over: Pakistan 100-4 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 34, Shoaib Malik 17) On comes Paul Collingwood, whose first ball is whipped to deep midwicket for two by Shoaib Malik. England could do with a wicket, just to keep their grip on the game. At the moment it's loosening ever so slightly. \"Concerning your surprise at the taxi driver's gadget, you have lead a sheltered life, haven't you?\" says Kathy Stodart. \"Haven't you heard of radar detectors? Every second person in NZ has one in their car. Dodging cops and speed cameras is a national sport.\" Ah.\n\n28th over: Pakistan 104-4 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 36, Shoaib Malik 19) Like a dormant volcano, Inzamam is biding his time. The explosion could come in about 10 overs' time. Four singles off Kabir's over. \"Despite my continued warnings to my girlfriend about locking her bicycle up properly and not just securing the front wheel the inevitable happened last night,\" sighs Daniel Stansall. \"Can I take the moral low ground when I phone to tell her later this morning, pointing out this is exactly what I said would happen. Or should I just blame the bad thieves (actually it would appear that they were quite good thieves in this case) and offer to buy her a new bike?\"\n\n29th over: Pakistan 109-4 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 38, Shoaib Malik 22) Inzy continues to find the gaps and amble his singles, while Shoaib is proving slightly less adept at working the ball around. But he's lucky to pick up an overthrow off the last ball of the over to turn one into two. These two have now added 51. \"Are you patriotically rooting for an England victory today, or would you rather Pakistan wrap up the series so you don't have another 4:30 start?\" asks Martin Myers. \"I assume there'll be no OBO if the last match is a dead rubber.\" On the contrary, Martin. They will play the fifth game whatever happens, but I won't be here to report it: Rob Smyth will be your man on Wednesday morning.\n\nWICKET! Shoaib Malik c Strauss b Blackwell 23 (118-5) A gift for England after Inzamam had belted Blackwell over long-on for six. Shoaib Malik sweeps the last ball of the over, a full-toss, straight to Andrew Strauss at deep square-leg and you can hear a pin drop in the Pindi Stadium. Just what Pakistan did not need!\n\n31st over: Pakistan 120-5 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 47, Shahid Afridi 1) Inzamam takes a single to third man off the first ball of Collingwood's over, which causes a great deal of excitement among the crowd: it means that Shahid Afridi is on strike. He defends his first three deliveries, from the third of which he chances a single to Solanki. That would have been out if it had hit! Collingwood mixed up his pace well in that over: just two singles off it.\n\n32nd over: Pakistan 126-5 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 49, Shahid Afridi 5) Afridi sweeps Blackwell off the top edge for two, then sweeps his next ball squarer and more confidently for a single. No limbs-whirring sixes as yet. Six off the over with Inzamam in quiet control.\n\n33rd over: Pakistan 135-5 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 50, Shahid Afridi 13) Inzamam reaches his half-century - his 82nd in ODIs! - with a push to wide mid-off for a single, before Afridi flays Collingwood over extra cover for six. Two off the last ball makes it nine off the over. He sliced that slightly, but even his mis-hits tend to clear the rope. \"Your first question of the day is a tricky one to answer,\" says Richard O'Hagan, referring way back to my post-preamble at 5.50am. \"Provided that the detector is just using a GPS system to tell you where the cameras are, then it is legal. If it is using any kind of radio or laser to either locate or block the camera, then it is illegal under, amongst other things, the Wireless Telegraphy Act. And yes, this is almost certainly the most nerdy email I have ever sent during an OBO.\"\n\n34th over: Pakistan 138-5 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 53, Shahid Afridi 13) Back comes Flintoff in search of what could be the match-winning wicket. But he immediately gives away two runs courtesy of a poor piece of fielding from Strauss, who gifts an overthrow from backward square. Inzamam currently stands between Pakistan and defeat, but he's been so imposing all series that you probably wouldn't care to bet against him. An excellent over: three runs off it. \"Can anyone give me ideas about what I should do for New Year's Eve?\" asks Kim Sibthorpe. \"Stay local (ahem, Essex), or go all Nathan Barley and go to London? I am too lazy to think about what I should do. At this rate, I will be watching Jools Holland's Hootenanny.\"\n\n35th over: Pakistan 145-5 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 54, Shahid Afridi 19) A green and white kite that had been circling over the ground for several minutes finally falls to earth at deepish mid-off and play is held up as a portly official comes on to remove the offending toy. Ian Botham is chuntering away in the commentary box. \"Right, now we can try to find out where it came from,\" he says, as if the kite is a double agent. \"Let's get on with the game.\" Good stuff from Collingwood, who sends down four dot balls to Inzamam. The fifth is pushed into the off-side for a single, but the sixth - with awful predictability - is thrashed down the ground for six by Afridi. \"Whatever Daniel Stansall does, he should not take the moral lowground,\" says Anton Lawrence. \"I found this out yesterday after my wife fell over, while out on a run, and my first suggestion was that she should 'learn how to fall properly'...\" I bet that went down well...\n\n36th over: Pakistan 149-5 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 56, Shahid Afridi 20) Fifteen overs of Afridi and Pakistan could yet get 280 or so. England can't afford to relax at all. Flintoff continues and Afridi refuses to take any risks. Four runs off the over - another very good one by Freddie. \"Whilst I wold normally recommend taking the low moral ground where possible, Daniel Stansall doesnt have a lot of choice on this one,\" says Adrian Bell. \"If he doesn't get his girlfriend a new bike she'll inevitably end up using his and get that nicked as well. Time for a Halfords 99 quid special, bonus if you hadn't got her anything for Christmas yet.\"\n\n37th over: Pakistan 155-5 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 57, Shahid Afridi 25) Back comes Plunkett, who still has a maximum of six overs left of his allocation. Afridi slogs him for two leg-side runs off the inside edge. Another heave off the last ball of the over collects two to extra cover. \"Those radar detectors are legal in the States, and have been widely popular here for ages,\" says Oliver Pattenden. \"I'd never seen one until I moved here, and I'm pretty sure they're illegal over in the UK. The worst part about them is that when you're driving near a lot of trucks, and one of them senses something on the radar, they all slow right down and block up the road for a good 10 minutes. Though I suppose the warning is nice and it's better than getting a ticket.\"\n\n38th over: Pakistan 157-5 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 57, Shahid Afridi 26) There's been a not more imagination about England's bowling today, especially when it's come to slower balls. Kabir sends down a couple more in that over, and it keeps Pakistan's batsmen guessing. Two off the over: an excellent one for England. \"If Blackwell and Inzy went head to head in the 100m dash who do you think would prevail?\" asks Joe Knight. I think Inzy can motor when he feels like it, Joe.\n\n39th over: Pakistan 165-5 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 62, Shahid Afridi 28) Plunkett continues as the sun rises on another lovely, crisp morning in London. The two things are in no way connected, but I just happened to glance out of the window at that point. Inzamam pulls for four. \"I really would recommend staying in and going to bed on NYE,\" says Damian Koblintz. \"That way, you don't have to deal with crowds of people who only go out and drink once a year (and hence do not know how to handle it and get all rowdy and violent), the overpriced taxis and cover prices, and generally having to wait for ages to get served. Also, no matter what else happens for the rest of the year, you can look back and always know there was at least one morning you awoke and didnt loathe the daylight...\"\n\n40th over: Pakistan 170-5 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 63, Shahid Afridi 31) Blackwell returns to the attack, but he can't stop Afridi bringing up the 50 stand with a quick two. England have got to be careful here: 10 profitable overs for Pakistand and the momentum will be theirs.\n\nWICKET! Shahid Afridi b Plunkett 34 (174-6) An almighty wicket for England as Plunkett deceives Afridi with the slower ball. The batsman has a wild wipe, misses and is bowled middle and off. \"The classic batmen's race would involve Inzy, Gatting and Key,\" says James Huxtable. \"Place a pie at the finish line and see what happens...\"\n\nWICKET! Abdul Razzaq b Plunkett 0 (174-7) Well, well! Adbul Razzaq is bowled first ball by a beautiful yorker and Plunkett will be on a hat-trick when he starts his next over. Great bowling! \"I think I've solved my girlfriend/bicycle dilemma,\" says Dan Stansall. \"I'll buy her a new bike, but also get her three shiny new locks as well, just to labour the point a bit.\"\n\n42nd over: Pakistan 180-7 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 67, Rana Naved 2) Kabir begins that over with a no-ball which Inzamam pushes down the ground for a single. Yet again, Inzy is proving the rock upon which England might yet founder. \"I have one friend who was born on NYE and one who was born on New Year's Day,\" says Richard O'Hagan. \"The first feels cheated out of a party and the second feels cheated because no one ever feels like having another party.\"\n\n43rd over: Pakistan 187-7 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 70, Rana Naved 6) Inzamam drives Plunkett's hat-trick ball to short extra cover: no runs. The next two deliveries are dot balls as well, before Inzamam helps a full-toss to deep backward square for two. But this is fine stuff from the 20-year-old Plunkett. He's taken a couple of batterings in this series, but he's never lost his sense of adventure. Unluckily for him, Naved square-drives his last ball just out of reach of backward point for four. \"On the subject of speeding tickets, does anyone else out there find that they're only pulled over or fined when they're doing something charitable, such as taking a girlfriend to the hospital?\" wonders modern-day Florence Nightingale Oliver Pattenden. \"Or returning from dropping off some poor friend at work whose car has just broken down? Or is this just me?\"\n\n44th over: Pakistan 194-7 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 77, Rana Naved 6) Inzamam has not missed any opportunity to rock back and go on the pull, and Kabir Ali offers up the ideal opportunity there: four runs. Can Inzy take another hundred off England? \"For some reason James Huxtable's classic batsmen's race (over 41) reminds me of that old joke about putting Paul Gascoigne, Lee Bowyer and Wayne Rooney in front of three shovels and asking them to take their pick,\" says Kurt Stengel.\n\n45th over: Pakistan 197-7 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 79, Rana Naved 7) A leg niggle is hampering Inzamam, which is making quick singles even more problematic than usual. Another intelligent over from Plunkett: just three singles off it. \"Dan Stansall should be careful about the locks he buys her,\" says Anton Lawrence. \"There are some that you can open with those free charity pens that you get through the post.\"\n\nWICKET! Rana Naved c Collingwood b Kabir Ali 17 (208-8) After hitting Kabir for four, then six, Naved skews the fifth ball of the over high to point, where Collingwood makes no mistake. Four overs to go. \"Inzy would be bound to win the 100m if he was also the starter,\" says Martin Myers. \"He'd be three-quarters of the way down the track and then shout \"YES\" as an afterthought, leaving everyone else stranded.\"\n\nWICKET! Shoaib Akhtar c Collingwood b Flintoff 0 (209-9) A good low catch from Collingwood at backward point as Shoaib tries to steer Flintoff to third man. England are giving themselves every chance of squaring the series here.\n\n47th over: Pakistan 209-9 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 80, Mohammad Sami 0) Somehow Mohammad Sami survives the rest of that Flintoff over, but Inzamam will be on strike. He's going to have to go for broke.\n\nWICKET! Mohammad Sami c Jones b Anderson 0 (210) Sami nibbles at Anderson and is caught behind. What an effort by England. They began tightly and only theatened to release the pressure when Inzamam and Afridi were batting together. Inzamam finishes with a runner and an unbeaten 81, and England will need to score 211 to level the series. It won't be easy, because this pitch is less accommodating to strokeplay than the ones at Lahore and Karachi, but they still have to be favourites. Join us soon for the England reply."
