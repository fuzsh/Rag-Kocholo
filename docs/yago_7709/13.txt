“On December 10th, Canadian film pioneer Denis Héroux, director, writer and producer of several cinematic landmarks, passed away. His greatest achievements lay in the constant innovation and audacity that saw him conquer new audiences at home and abroad and his visionary approach that broke down boundaries for Canadian cinema, particularly through coproduction.

“As a director, he left his mark on the 60s and 70s with films such as Seul ou avec d’autres (1962), a first feature that represented Canada at the Cannes Critics’ Week, as well as Valérie (1969) and L’Initiation (1970), which were daringly open for their day. These were followed by his most significant directorial efforts, including the historical drama Quelques arpents de neige (1972), J’ai mon voyage (1973) and Pousse mais pousse égal (1975).

“He also had a long and varied career in production, delivering such major projects as Robe noire (1991), Le matou (1985) and Le crime d’Ovide Plouffe (1984).

“His talent as a producer propelled him onto the international stage: he coproduced Violette Nozière (1978) and The Blood of Others (1984), both directed by Claude Chabrol, as well as Louis Malle’s Atlantic City (1980), winner of a Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, and Jean-Jacques Annaud’s Quest for Fire (1981), which earned him a César Award for Best Producer.

“It should also be noted that he was an outstanding teacher, who shared his passion for film with thousands of students over the years.

“In 1984, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in recognition of his work.

“For your immense contribution to Quebec and Canadian cinema, we thank you, Denis.

“Telefilm Canada’s Board and entire team join me in extending sincere condolences to his family, which has extensive ties to cinema, to his friends, and to the Canadian film industry.”
