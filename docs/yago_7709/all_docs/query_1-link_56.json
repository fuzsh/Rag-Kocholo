        "text": "Salve Regina University Athletics has announced that Salve Regina will be joining the New England Women’s and Men’s Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) as its newest member institution following unanimous support from the NEWMAC Presidents Council. Salve Regina will become the conference’s 12th core member effective July 1, 2023, and will begin participating in conference play during the 2023-2024 academic year.\n\n“Welcoming Salve Regina University to the NEWMAC is one that we do with great anticipation and excitement,” said Mary-Beth Cooper, president of Springfield College and chair of the NEWMAC Presidents Council. “This expansion not only diversifies our conference’s geographical footprint, but provides the NEWMAC with another like-minded institution that aligns with our core values and broadens our institutional portfolio. As our conference continues to emerge out of the pandemic stronger than ever, I’m confident that Salve Regina’s addition to the NEWMAC provides strength, stability and opportunity.”\n\nThe addition of Salve Regina further strengthens the NEWMAC as a preeminent conference in Division III, aligning in all facets academically and athletically. Salve Regina was founded by the Sisters of Mercy, who sought wisdom and promoted universal justice while focusing on the whole person, academic exploration, and excellence and service to others. Such tenets were one of the many ways Salve Regina showed their fit with the NEWMAC’s core values of excellence, integrity and respect.\n\n“The NEWMAC institutions are known not only for their academic excellence, but their commitment to the support of the whole student and the creation of inclusive educational environments,” said Dr. Kelli J. Armstrong, president of Salve Regina. “Salve Regina is truly honored to be a member of this prestigious and progressive athletic conference.”\n\nAs its 12th member, Salve Regina will participate in 16 of the NEWMAC’s 20 sports, having immediate impact by increasing team sponsorship and championship field size, while bolstering the competitiveness within the conference both regionally and nationally in Division III. NEWMAC student-athletes can add Newport as a new destination, as the conference now reaches three New England states: Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\n\n“As the chair of the NEWMAC Expansion Task Force, it has been an honor and a privilege working with the exceptional members of our conference as we looked across the landscape of higher-education to identify the best institution to join us in pursuit of our goals,” expressed William Kelly, rear admiral and superintendent of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. “Salve Regina University is the perfect fit for the NEWMAC and their commitment to the student-athlete experience is inspiring. We look forward to having them join us, and I am confident their addition to the conference will ensure the strength and stability of the NEWMAC during a period of significant change in college athletics.”\n\nAs Salve Regina officially joins the NEWMAC on July 1, 2023, both the NEWMAC and Salve Regina will be concluding celebrations of their 25-Year and 75-Year anniversaries, respectively. These celebrations and similar strategic goals shows the parallels between the NEWMAC institutions, which only solidifies and supports the conference’s expansion to add Salve Regina as a core member, while continuing to display dedication and commitment to the student-athlete experience.\n\n“It is exciting to welcome Salve Regina University as the conference’s 12th member,” said Patrick B. Summers, executive director of NEWMAC. “My sincere thanks go to RADM Kelly and the members of the Task Force, President Cooper for her continued leadership as chair of the NEWMAC Presidents Council and President Armstrong and her team at Salve for their absolute commitment to our process. There is something quite significant about the NEWMAC celebrating its 25th anniversary, Title IX celebrating its 50th anniversary and Salve celebrating its 75th anniversary as we welcome them into a conference that champions academic and athletic excellence and was founded as an all women’s athletic conference.”\n\nSalve Regina sponsors 20 varsity sports, supporting over 500 student-athletes and aligning with the NEWMAC’s mission of being Champions of Academic and Athletic Excellence. Salve Regina student athletes boast an average of a 3.5 GPA while earning nine NCAA AQ’s in the last seven years. The Seahawks will participate in 16 NEWMAC sponsored sports: baseball, men’s and women’s basketball, men’s and women’s cross country, field hockey, football, men’s and women’s lacrosse, men’s and women’s soccer, softball, men’s and women’s tennis, women’s track and field, and volleyball.\n\n“Becoming a member of the NEWMAC is a wonderful opportunity for our student-athletes and staff to grow and succeed regionally and nationally,” said Jody Mooradian, director of athletics at Salve Regina. “While we have had great success in our current conference and enjoy the relationships we have there, we look forward to collaborating with a new set of administrators, coaches and student athletes.”\n\nSalve Regina is home to impressive facilities throughout the 75-acre campus. Salve Regina also works closely with the local community to help develop facilities that can be beneficial to all of Newport while being the home to many of the Seahawks athletic programs.\n\nThe NEWMAC conference office will begin work immediately to develop conference schedules for the 2023-2024 season and beyond, as conference play in fall of 2023 will begin mid-September. For more information about the NEWMAC, please visit their website.\n\nDominic Perachi ’23 has been chosen as the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA)/Rawlings National Pitcher of the Year after a dominant 2022 campaign. With this award, Perachi has earned the highest athletic honor ever achieved in the history of Salve Regina athletics.\n\nPerachi, a business administration major, began his 2022 campaign with an immaculate inning of nine pitches, nine strikes and three outs in the season-opening first frame against Johnson & Wales University. He finished with 16 strikeouts over seven innings and earned multiple weekly accolades — including from the Commonwealth Coast Conference (CCC) Pitcher of the Week, D3baseball.com Team of the Week, and the National Collegiate Baseball Writers’ Association (NCBWA).\n\nPerachi ‘s next start came in Florida when the Seahawks took on Farmingdale State. The only hit allowed was a dribbler up the first base line to the first batter he faced, and he struck out 13 players. Perachi returned to the mound later that week in Florida to face a perennial NCAA postseason participant Southern Maine and handcuffed the Huskies for the second time in two straight matchups.\n\nReturning to New England, Perachi took the bump in the first of several weekend matchups with CCC foes and extended his string of starts without allowing an earned run to five. Wentworth was the first team to notch an earned run against the junior lefty, and that did not come until the seventh frame of an eight-inning, complete-game outing where Perachi struck out a season-high 17 batters.\n\nHe was charged with another earned run in a 9-2 victory over Suffolk University while striking out nine Rams. A mid-week matchup with previously nationally-ranked Roger Williams University, then undefeated in CCC play, gave Perachi the opportunity to vault the Seahawks onto a path to first place in the league.\n\nPerachi faced the Hawks again among his final three outings, which also included a pair of nationally-ranked teams, Endicott College and University of Lynchburg. In each of those three starts, he reached double-digit strikeouts to establish a new single-season program record of 120 Ks.\n\nThe Seahawks (30-13-2) clinched first place in the Commonwealth Coast Conference (CCC) with a doubleheader sweep of Endicott, also undefeated in CCC play before meeting in Newport, on the final weekend of the regular season. Perachi matched his season-high in innings pitched (eight) and exited against the Gulls with the game tied before Salve Regina won on a walk-off basehit in the bottom of the ninth. Perachi had three combined shutouts on the season.\n\nThe ABCA/Rawlings National Players of the Year are chosen by the ABCA All-America committees in each respective division. ABCA/Rawlings First-Team All-America selections are eligible for Player of the Year honors. The ABCA/Rawlings Players of the Year are selected in nine divisions: NCAA Divisions I, II and III; NAIA; NJCAA Divisions I, II and III; Pacific Association Division; and high school.\n\nThe American Baseball Coaches Association, founded in 1945, is the primary professional organization for baseball coaches at the amateur level. Its over 13,000 members represent all 50 states and over 30 countries. Rawlings Sporting Goods Company, Inc. is an innovative manufacturer and marketer of sporting goods worldwide. Founded in 1887, Rawlings is an authentic global sports brand, trusted by generations of athletes of all skill levels.\n\nIn an effort to bring Salve Regina staff members together in a spirit of camaraderie and fun, the Staff Advisory Council (SAC) will be hosting Staff Summer Sizzlers weekly throughout the summer.

This event was a big hit in June, so the council is bringing it back for July and August, too. A Mano Pizza and Gelato food truck will be set up near outdoor seating, but attendees are not required to purchase a flight or food to attend. The plan is to meet up at the brewery right after work at 4:45 p.m. so that staff can stay as long as they can.\n\nAquidneck Growers Market\n\nWednesday, July 27, at 1:30 p.m.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 27, staff are invited to visit the Aquidneck Growers Market on Memorial Boulevard. Staff will meet at the main entrance of Miley Hall at 1:30 p.m. and then walk to the market, so please be sure to discuss taking a later lunch with supervisors. The market happens weekly from 2-6 p.m., so people are interested in going with other staff members on another date, please feel free to coordinate.\n\nPlans for Staff Summer Sizzlers in August will be coming soon.

She facilitated recruitment process and communications with prospective students, their families, all relevant college staff and faculty.\n\nRoberts arrived at Wellesley after spending the previous five years as assistant women’s soccer coach at the University of Rhode Island (URI). At URI, Roberts facilitated team building and leadership programs and coordinated travel and recruiting for the Division I program, helping the Rams to qualify for the Atlantic 10 tournament in 2014 and 2016.\n\nPrior to arriving at URI, Roberts was the associate head soccer coach at the Holy Names University in Oakland, Calif., helping to lead the squad to the California Pacific Conference Championship in 2009 and 2012, as well as regional and NAIA playoff appearances. Her coaching experience includes posts at Las Lomas High School, St. Mary’s College of California, and the University of Nevada, in addition to numerous camps and clinics across the country. She holds an NSCAA Premier Diploma.\n\nAn NSCAA All-Region third team selection in 2006, Roberts helped guide the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) to three-straight NCAA tournament appearances from 2004 to 2006, while earning Mount West All-Conference accolades and guiding the Rebels to conference tournament titles as a junior and senior in 2005 and 2006. Roberts graduated from UNLV with a degree in physical education and later received her master’s degree in education from Holy Names College.\n\n“I am passionate about teaching, coaching and educating young women to be leaders through athletics,” said Roberts. “With experience teaching and coaching in many environments, I am confident I can fulfill the needs of Salve Regina athletics and follow the guidelines to perform under any circumstance. I understand the importance of teamwork, collaboration, communication, work ethic and cohesion within athletics.”\n\nBest-selling authors and award-winning writers will present guest readings and craft talks during a week-long summer workshop being hosted Monday, June 27, through Saturday, July 2.

RI Kickball is a non-profit 501(c)7 sports league that has been a positive point of social and athletic connection for locals residing on Aquidneck Island.\n\n“Over the past 11 years and 20 seasons of RI Kickball, I have had the privilege of making many lifelong friendships and partnerships with local businesses because of RI Kickball,” said Turowski. “I am forever grateful that I took the plunge and started this league with the help of my husband Carson and my friend Valerie Mey-Altenburger all those years ago.”\n\nThe brainchild of Carson and Lindsey Turowski, kickball is being played on Monday nights in Morton Park and Toppa Field throughout the spring and fall. The idea came to the couple in 2011 after seeing how popular the game has become in Washington, D.C., which has thousands of players participating in leagues across the city.\n\nEver since founding RI Kickball in 2011, the league has been at max capacity with 12 teams and approximately 220 players per season. Over the years, RI Kickball has had 36 different teams play from a variety of backgrounds — including the Newport Police, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Naval War College, the IYRS School of Technology & Trade, Marine professionals and more.\n\n“In the past, league leaders have thanked me with a small gift or just a mention of thanks to the whole at the season awards party,” said Turowski. “This time they had been working behind the scenes to have the key to the City of Newport awarded to me …. To think that they planned this for me and went to the city is really meaningful.”\n\nKickball is a great sport for a variety of people to play, according to Turowski. Anyone with some athletic ability can play and participate in it, and it’s also a sport that allows for multiple genders to be good players.\n\n“These folks are now my friends for life thanks to kickball,” Turowski said. “When you are awarded something like this, you remember it forever.”\n\nFor more information on the league, go to RI Kickball’s website.\n\nAshley Koffink ’22, a psychology major from Holbrook, Massachusetts, will be pursuing a master’s degree in social work at Boston College. She will be specializing in clinical social work with children, youth and families. She then will be ready to become a License Independent Clinical Social Worker (LICSW).\n\nAfter Koffink begins pursuing her professional career, her longterm goal is to open her own private practice working with children and adolescents with mental illness and PTSD.\n\n“Many faculty members at Salve had a tremendous impact on me personally and academically,” said Koffink.\n\nKoffink specifically pointed out Laura Kcira-Barry, disabilities services coordinator, and Dr. Paula Martasian, associate professor in the Department of Psychology. Koffink explains that these faculty members pushed her to believe in herself when she was having doubts about personal or academic endeavors.\n\n“I credit them for getting me where I am today heading for Boston College,” she said. “Their words and encouragement will help me continue to be a success in both my academics and my future career as a social worker.”\n\nOne of the most important things that Koffink learned during her studies at Salve Regina is the diversity that exists in the world and how necessary it is to analyze the bigger picture of a person and situation. She believes this knowledge of diversity will directly impact her future career as a social worker.\n\n“We are not all the same, and we come from different cultures, religions and backgrounds,” she explained. “Taking the time to get to know a person, where they live, what their family is like, etcetera, can help you be a support system.”\n\nAfter her experience as an undergrad at Salve, Koffink urged incoming students not to worry so much about declaring their major. She explains that she started off as a biology major, but she quickly became intrigued by her psychology classes. Even though some of the classes she took were intimidating, the professors she worked with made her experience enjoyable.\n\n“My experience at Salve Regina has been life-changing,” she concluded. “I have grown as a person academically and spiritually. I walked into this beautiful campus with hopes of finding new friends, experiences and knowledge, and I am leaving with so much more.”\n\nArticle written by student writer Taylor Majkowicz ’22\n\nSalve Spotlights is a series of people-centered stories periodically featured on SALVEtoday.
