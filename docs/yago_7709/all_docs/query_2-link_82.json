        "text": "American filmmaker Mike Flanagan will be the featured guest at Quebec’s Fantasia International Film Festival, where he will receive the festival’s Cheval Noir Career Achievement Award.\n\nFlanagan has a long history with the Canadian genre festival. He screened his first feature, Absentia, at the festival in 2011. His other feature credits include Oculus (2013), Hush (2016), Gerald’s Game (2017) and Doctor Sleep (2019), as well as the Netflix miniseries events The Haunting of Hill House (2018) and The Fall of the House of Usher (2023). His next feature is the forthcoming Stephen King adaptation The Life Of Chuck (2024), starring Tom Hiddleston, Mark Hamill, and Chiwetel Ejiofor. This year at Fantasia he will present a screening of Chris Stuckmann’s Shelby Oaks.\n\nElsewhere, the festival also announced today it will close with the world premiere of André Forcier’s Ababouiné. The film stars Rémy Girard, Gaston Lepage, Pascale Montpetit, Éric Bruneau, and Mylène Mackay.\n\nAnnouncing the closing pic, the festival said Forcier’s films have displayed “rare consistency over more than 50 years.”\n\n“André Forcier’s work is firmly rooted in magic realism with its elements of fantasy, and yet it is grounded in a very Quebec reality,” the festival said. “ He has transformed our distinct language into a filmic language that is sometimes crude but always poetic. André Forcier’s work is unique and immense. Fantasia is very proud to present him with the Prix Denis-Héroux, the festival’s award bestowed for exceptional contribution to the development of Quebec genre cinema.”\n\nFantasia once again returns to Concordia Hall and J.A. de Sève cinemas, with additional screens and events at Montreal’s Cinémathèque québécoise and Cinéma du Musée. The event will run July 18 – Aug 4."
