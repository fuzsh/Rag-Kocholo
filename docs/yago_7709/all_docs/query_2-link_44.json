        "text": "[Michel] Brault was not responsible for the film’s underlying idea, which was entirely improvised using the subject of two students at the Université de Montréal [Denis Héroux and Denys Arcand]. The actors were also students, and the film’s super small budget (4,500 francs) was raised by the students’ association. The students had decided to do this film instead of the traditional end-of-year performance. But, not having any technical knowledge, the ‘authors’ asked an N.F.B. crew, headed by Michel Brault, to shoot the film. The materials used belonged to ‘cinéma-vérité’: live with tie clip microphones for synchronized sound recording. Brault had to be happy with ‘inventing’ his directing depending on the actors’ actions and gestures.\n\nThe theme chosen is not far from being a documentary: Nicole’s start at University, her discovery of student ‘morals’… and Pierre’s flirtation with the provocative Michèle. The film portrays the faculty’s commencement ceremony with the students who listen to a Canadian ‘speaker’, attend an anatomy class, and, of course, the traditional student dance where love triumphs.\n\nThe film is fresh and delicate, even if at times Brault makes up for the actors’ lack of ideas with daring shots. Gilles Groulx’s spotless editing accentuates this stylized element of a simple film that could have done without it… These are still the limits of any film purpose-fully and entirely improvised from start to end. The film is rich with humor, especially the stubborn attitude – though disillusioned – of the girls who want to get married… despite not entirely believing in the virtues of their companions.\n\nRené Prédal, Jeune Cinéma Canadien, “Premier Plan”, n. 45, October 1967"
