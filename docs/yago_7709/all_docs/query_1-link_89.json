Boya (Gordon Currie), a sexy Gothic vampire, rises after 25 years of hibernation in ‘90s Toronto. Overwhelmed by his new surroundings, Boya takes refuge in an all-night diner where he forms a close relationship with a charming waitress (Helene Clarkson) and an offbeat cabbie (Justin Louis) who’s in too deep with the local gangsters, lead by none other than Filmmaking Icon David Cronenberg. Blood & Donuts is the hilariously morbid debut feature film from accomplished Canadian director Holly Dale (Dexter, The Americans, Durham County).\n\nEducators\n\nSuitable for: Kindergarten, Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, Grade 4, Grade 5\n\nThis film is part of the following catalogue:\n\nJK to Grade 8 Films\n\nA Quebecois seismologist living in Tokyo returns to her hometown to investigate the strange disruption of the tides along the St Lawrence, in Manon Briand’s atmospheric and deftly humorous drama.\n\nSuspecting that the cessation of the tides might indicate an impending earthquake, Alice (Pascale Bussieres) arrives in Baie-Comeau, Quebec to solve the mystery.\n\nConfronted by numerous people from her past, unusual weather and the inexplicable behaviour of the locals (including Genevieve Bujold as the owner of a local diner who is convinced of a supernatural explanation), Alice’s scientific certainty begins to waver Though many of the locals’ stories don’t stand up to scrutiny, she starts to suspect that something beyond her comprehension may be happening.\n\n\"So visually energetic and smartly written that one never stops enjoying the sheer pleasure of looking at it.\" – Liz Braun, Jam! Movies\n\nBrooklyn tells the profoundly moving story of Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan), a young Irish immigrant navigating her way through 1950s Brooklyn. Lured by the promise of America, Eilis departs Ireland and the comfort of her mother's home for the shores of New York City. The initial shackles of homesickness quickly diminish as a fresh romance sweeps Eilis into the intoxicating charm of love. But soon, her new life is disrupted by her past, and Eilis must choose between two countries and two paths in life."
