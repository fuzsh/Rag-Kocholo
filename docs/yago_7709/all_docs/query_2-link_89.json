Laboratoire CinéMédias founder André Gaudreault was awarded the insignia of Officer of the Order of Canada \"for his seminal contributions to film studies and the history of cinema as a visionary scholar and educational leader.\" This is one of the most prestigious honors in the country.\n\nTo learn more about other UdeM members who have also been named to the Order of Canada, see this article on the UdeM News site. It includes the following (translated from French):\n\nAndré Gaudreault, Canada Research Chair in Film and Media Studies, is a prolific researcher and one of the most prominent figures in Canadian film studies. He has initiated several innovative projects. He is one of the five founders of the International Society for the Study of Early Cinema. He is also the source of the GRAFIM Research Group (Groupe de recherche sur l’avènement et la formation des identités médiatiques), which has been studying the impact of technological innovations on the identity of cinema since 2018. He is also credited with founding the Laboratoire CinéMédias, where he has directed the International Research Partnership on Cinema Techniques and Technologies since 2015. He has collaborated with several specialists throughout his career. Among others, he created, with director and producer Denis Héroux, the Observatoire du cinéma au Québec in 2007. He designed, with professor Olivier Asselin, the first doctoral program in film studies in Canada. More recently, he joined forces with Professors Santiago Hidalgo and Isabelle Raynauld to create the international partnership CINEXMEDIA, an intersectoral initiative that combines the humanities and basic sciences to analyze contemporary screen habits. He is internationally recognized and has received numerous prestigious awards. Named a Guggenheim Fellow in 2013, elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 2014, and made a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters of the French Republic in 2016, he was awarded the Prix du Québec - Léon-Gérin in 2017, followed by the Killam Prize in the Humanities from the Canada Council for the Arts in 2018. He has also received two honorary doctorates, the first in 2019 from the Université Paul-Valéry Montpellier 3 and the second, in 2021, from the Université Rennes 2.\n\nStéphanie Deschamps (UdeM Nouvelles)"
