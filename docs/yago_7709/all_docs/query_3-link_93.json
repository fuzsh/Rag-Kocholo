        "text": "A pair of Olympians have taken over social media while becoming the meme darlings of these 2024 Summer Games for their vastly contrasting styles during the shooting events in Paris.\n\nSouth Korean sharpshooter Kim Yeji, who claimed the silver medal in the women’s 10-metre air pistol event on Sunday, was the first to become the apple of the internet's eye as she cruised to the podium looking like a villain straight out of a James Bond film.\n\nBut it wasn't her getup from Paris making the social media rounds, but rather clips and photos from her performance at the ISSF World Cup in May that started circulating over the weekend and vaulted the 31-year-old into instant internet fame.\n\nRocking a black backwards hat, a FILA zip-up sweater, some wild Matrix-style eyewear and her left hand tucked in her pocket, Kim nonchalantly fired bullets at the target before flipping up her video game-looking glasses to check her score.\n\nKim then barely reacts at all upon finding out she broke a world record in the 25-metre air pistol event. Just an incredible display of badassery on all levels.\n\nThe internet predictably had an absolute field day, pumping out some of the best reaction and memes we'll see during these Olympics.\n\nKim's immaculate stance, demeanour, style and overall coolness set social media ablaze.\n\nMaking her character even more irresistible is the fact she also appeared to be in full mom mode while blasting bullets through a target with her pistol. Kim was spotted holding a plush elephant doll, which was reportedly a gift from her daughter.\n\nNow, the fun doesn't end there as Kim wasn't the only Olympic shooter catching the eye of fans — albeit for slightly different reasons.\n\nYusuf Dikec of Turkey who, like Kim, blasted his way to a silver medal in Paris, rose to instant internet fame because he just looked so damn chill.\n\nCool. Collected. Nonchalant. This dude rules:\n\nAt 51 years old, non-shooting hand in his pocket, draped in a wrinkled white t-shirt and rocking no ear protection or special eyewear of any kind, the Turkish shooter emanated the most casual (and terrifying?) vibes one could possibly have while pointing a gun at something.\n\nDikec and teammate Sevval Ilayda Tarhan claimed silver in the mixed team 10-meter air pistol event, marking the first-ever medal in Olympic shooting for Turkey.\n\nA former non-commissioned officer for the Gendarmerie General Command — an armed law enforcement organization in Turkey — this is actually Dikec’s fifth Olympics. The Turk has participated in shooting events in every Summer Olympics since the 2008 Games in Beijing.\n\nHe’s also a seven-time European champ and 2014 double world champion. No wonder my guy is so damn relaxed.\n\nOnce again, upon first site of this beauty, the Internet pounced all over this juicy storyline with praise, memes and jokes aplenty.\n\nDikec does seem to be soaking all the social-media stardom in, posting multiple memes to his Instagram page.\n\nThe auras of Dikec and Kim were bound to cross at some point, and that's exactly what happened as many fans and social media users drew contrasts and comparisons between the two Paris silver medalists. Even the official account of the Olympics wanted in on the festivities.\n\nNo. 2 on the podiums, No. 1 in our hearts. Bless these two legends."
