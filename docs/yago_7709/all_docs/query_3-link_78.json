        "text": "I wasn’t exactly familiar with Born For Hell, only by title. Both, Born For Hell and serial killer Richard Speck were two things I had only heard in passing. Now, I’m polished up on both and I owe it to the nightmarish journey that is Born For Hell for sending me down the Speck rabbit hole. You will find yourself in the same predicament, Speck was a sadistic piece of shit, but like all serial killers, there is that morbid fascination/curiosity that really drives the need to know more. Luckily, the bonus features on this Severin release were outstanding and began my trip down the rabbit hole immediately and thoroughly.\n\nSeverin’s recently released blu-ray, allowed me to get introduced to not only Speck but also plenty of tid bits and bobs about the fascinating Denis Héroux film. As you know, when Severin puts out a blu-ray you are going to get a nice crisp picture and plenty of bonus features. So, after watching the film and the interviews with the cast, as well as a deep dive into the Speck murders, I feel like I know enough.\n\nBorn For Hell is an adaptation of Speck’s murders in all but name and city. The film had to undergo certain conditions in order to get made. The agreements oddly enough are to protect Speck’s reputation and has nothing to do with the reputation or rights of the victims. The powers that be had to change a few things including Specks name, the city the murders occurred in and the number of victims. So, instead of Chicago, the film takes place in Belfast.\n\nThe switch to Belfast does make for a nice unease due to the events that were going on in Belfast during the 70’s. Daily life was a wash of chaos and uncertainty due to bombings, shootings and all the other terrible bits that surrounded the IRA.\n\nActor, Mathieu Carriére takes on the unsettling role of Speck… I mean Cain Adamson as his name is in this picture. Adamson is a Vietnam vet with a lot of sexual repression and inadequacies. These sexual issues have directly lead to his hatred of women. Of course, he is even more affected that he can’t perform for women. It creates a vicious cycle in Adamson, where his very presence gives you an anxiety attack. The entire first act gives us the blueprint of a time bomb and fills us in on the not so secret, secret that this guy is going to explode.\n\nSimultaneously, a house full of lovely girls are having a get together, and all having a right great time. Their characters are briefly touched on but, they are explored well enough to give the audience a soft spot for the carefree young ladies. Late in the first act, Adamson walks right into the kitchen of the girls house. It’s a chilling scene, that isn’t played up with big orchestra swells or shrill pokes and pricks, it’s played quiet and that makes the whole thing even more unsettling. He just walks right in, the girls he confronts, all play it cool, listening to him talk about his wife and daughter, and even give him a sandwich and piece of cake in order to get him out of the house.\n\nOf course, you already know that Adamson is just scouting for what he plans to do later. You know he is coming back and there is nothing you can do.\n\nIn the films second act, Adamson lets himself in their backdoor and there begins 8 girls night of hell. The entire rest of the film is sadistic. What’s most chilling is the way Carriére composes himself, he is so quite, cordial and well-mannered. Even when, subduing the girls he is at his kindest. The juxtaposition in his actions versus his intentions are terrifying. The level of manipulation that he uses is as deadly as his switchblade. Carriére is almost too good in the role.\n\nDirector, Denis Héroux (The Uncanny) strips the film down to the bare essentials. There isn’t any flair or well-motioned cinematography and its all to serve the picture. The film feels very real, mundane and grounded, it is a perfect pairing for the world of Adamson, its cold, verging on being unhinged thanks to the backdrop of IRA’s war in Belfast at the time. The film looks as cold and rough as the streets and Adamson.\n\nThere is a stripped down, dower element to Born For Hell that permeates throughout its run-time. It’s entirely made up of moment to moment tension that is only relieved by an onslaught of nonstop terrors that befalls this household and the quiet lulls you get between murders. Added to every moment is Mathieu Carriére’s chill nature and easy demeanor throughout. Born For Hell is a home invasion horror that is a must see and also feels like a cautionary tale.\n\nYou can head over to MVD Entertainment to place your order for Born For Hell.\n\nBorn For Hell’s bonus features include:\n\nThe Other Side of the Mirror: Interview with Actor Mathieu Carrière\n\nNightmare In Chicago: Remembering the Richard Speck Crime Spree with Local Filmmakers John McNaughton and Gary Sherman\n\nA New Kind Of Crime: The Richard Speck Story with Once Upon A Crime Podcaster Esther Ludlow\n\nBombing Here, Shooting There: Video Essay by Filmmaker Chris O’Neill\n\nArtist Joe Coleman On Speck\n\nItalian Trailer\n\nNAKED MASSACRE: U.S. Video Release Cut\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals\n\nAtomic Monster and Blumhouse have updated their 2024 release schedules into early 2025. We already knew about AfrAId, Speak No Evil, and Wolf Man, but some surprises might be had here, including Cabin in the Woods and House of Spoils.\n\nBlumhouse hasn’t had a great year so far. Both its Night Swim and Imaginary went belly up. The clear winners of horror in 2024 are Neon and Shudder. Both of those production and distribution houses just kept churning out hit after hit.\n\nHowever, 2025 isn’t over yet and some of the titles below look promising. So the question is: which studio will end 2024 on a high note? We will let you decide.\n\nWhiplash (re-release in theaters Sept. 20)\n\nStarring Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, the film follows Andrew Neyman (Teller), an ambitious young jazz drummer, single-minded in his pursuit to rise to the top of his elite east coast music conservatory. Terence Fletcher (Simmons), an instructor known equally for his teaching talents and his terrifying methods, discovers Andrew and transfers him into his band. Andrew’s passion to achieve perfection soon spirals into obsession, as his ruthless teacher continues to push him to the brink of both his ability and his sanity.\n\nAfrAId (August 30)\n\nIn AFRAID, Curtis (John Cho) and his family are selected to test a revolutionary new home device: a digital family assistant called AIA. Taking smart home to the next level, once the unit and all its sensors and cameras are installed in their home, AIA seems able to do it all. She learns the family’s behaviors and begins to anticipate their needs. And she can make sure nothing – and no one – gets in her family’s way.\n\nSpeak No Evil (Sept. 13)\n\nWhen an American family is invited to spend the weekend at the idyllic country estate of a charming British family they befriend on vacation, what begins as a dream holiday soon warps into a snarled psychological nightmare.\n\nWolf Man (Jan.17)\n\nDirected by acclaimed writer and director Leigh Whannell (The Invisible Man) and starring Golden Globe and Emmy-winning actress Julie Garner (Ozark) and Golden Globe nominee Christopher Abbott (Poor Things), Wolf Man, is the blood-chilling reimagining of the classic monster pic that will leave you on the edge of your seat as you witness a man and his family being stalked and terrorized by a lethal predator.\n\nCabin in the Woods (Sept. 9)\n\nIn horror movies, nothing good ever happens to those in a cabin in the woods. In this series, true stories of ghastly, sometimes convoluted crimes take place in remote cabins around the country and for good reason: they allow those with evil intentions to carry out the most heinous of acts in peace and quiet away from prying eyes and ears. Combining hard-hitting investigative elements with spine-tingling thrills and chills, this true-crime-meets-true-horror series features the most terrifying crimes ever committed in isolated and otherwise picturesque cabin dwellings.\n\nHouse of Spoils (Oct. 3)\n\nHouse of Spoils follows an ambitious chef (Ariana DeBose) as she opens a restaurant on a remote estate where she battles kitchen chaos, crushing self doubts…and a haunting presence who threatens to sabotage her at every turn.\n\nWritten and directed by Bridget Save Cole and Danielle Krudy, the film is produced by Greg Gilreath, Adam Hendricks, Drew Houpt, Alex Scharfman, Lucas Joaquin and Jason Blum. The film stars Ariana DeBose, Barbie Ferreira, Arian Moayed, Amara Karan, Mikkel Bratt Silset and Marton Csokas.\n\nKiller Cakes (Oct. 8)\n\nA two-part special, Killer Cakes is a one-of-a-kind competition show where bakers with terrifying skills attempt to win some of the most frightening challenges ever produced for television. Contestants will work with the best horror special effects artists in Hollywood to unleash their twisted imaginations and create cakes so disgusting, so disturbing, and so realistic, it’s the stuff of nightmares.\n\nKiller Cakes is hosted by horror veteran Matthew Lillard (Five Nights at Freddy’s) with expert judges, Scream Queen Danielle Harris (Halloween Franchise) and experimental food artist and cookbook author Nikk Alcaraz (Peculiar Baking).\n\nThe Sticky (Dec. 2024 – TBA, Prime)\n\nThe Sticky is a fast-paced, six-part heist dramedy centered around Ruth Landry (Martindale), a Quebec-based maple syrup farmer who’s had it with corrupt bureaucrats. Together with mild-mannered security guard Remy Bouchard (Cyr) and small-time Boston gangster Mike Byrne (Diamantopoulos), she hatches a plan to rob the Fort Knox of maple syrup surpluses. But the surefire million-dollar plan hits a sticky patch when big city cop Valérie Nadeau picks up their scent, to say nothing of a terrifying figure from Mike’s past also looking to make a killing on the sweet stuff.\n\nWorst Ex Ever (Blumhouse Television: Aug. 28)\n\nFrom the creators of the global phenomenon Worst Roommate Ever comes Worst Ex Ever. The new format – built around the universal feeling of wondering how much you really know about your partner – brings you more shocking tales of betrayal, violence, and deceit.
