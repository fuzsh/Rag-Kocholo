        "text": "American Psycho, a chilling psychological thriller, follows the life of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a successful Wall Street executive by day and a gruesome serial killer by night. Balancing an outward appearance of wealth and normalcy with an inner world steeped in violence, Bateman's double life spirals out of control as his homicidal tendencies escalate. This film, noted for its exploration of materialistic culture and the dark underbelly of American society, is a stark portrayal of a man's descent into madness. Directed by Mary Harron, the movie offers a disturbing glimpse into the mind of a killer concealed beneath a veneer of sophistication.\n\nRachel (Mila Kunis) is a criminology student hoping to land a position as a teacher's assistant for professor Robert Starkman (William Shatner). She's sure this position will pave the way to an FBI career, and she's willing to do anything to obtain it -- including killing her classmates. The school psychiatrist, Dr. Daniels (Geraint Wyn Davies), becomes aware that Rachel is insane, but Rachel is skilled at her dangerous game of death and identity theft.\n\nBarbie and the Magic of Pegasus is a 2005 computer animated direct-to-video Barbie film directed by Greg Richardson. It is part of the Barbie film series, and the second to feature an original story not based on previous material. The film features the voice of Kelly Sheridan as the Barbie protagonist. Brie Larson recorded a song titled \"Hope Has Wings\" for this film, and the DVD includes the music video as a bonus feature. A line of toys were produced to go with the film, including dolls of Princess Annika, Aiden, Rayla the Cloud Queen, and Princess Brietta. Later a Barbie Mini Kingdom doll of Annika was produced with the Mini Kingdom birthday line.\n\nBarbie as the Princess and the Pauper is a 2004 direct-to-video computer animated Barbie film, and the first musical in the Barbie film series. It is directed by William Lau and stars the voice of Kelly Sheridan, who has been voicing Barbie in all the CGI films to date, as both Anneliese and Erika. The story is loosely inspired by the Mark Twain novel The Prince and the Pauper, but it is unrelated to the 1939 film The Princess and the Pauper. It is the first movie not to be told by Barbie but instead narrated by her. Songs for the film are written by Amy Powers, Megan Cavallari and Rob Hudnut, who also executive produced the film."
