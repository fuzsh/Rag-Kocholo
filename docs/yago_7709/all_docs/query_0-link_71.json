        "text": "Gothic horror and romance tales feed on our darkest fears and desires, and conjure the creatures of the night into being.\n\nThe sensational tales of 18th and 19th century writers like Horace Walpole, Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker and the Brontës, have defined popular culture, inspiring some of film and television’s most memorable characters, from Dracula and Frankenstein to Cathy and Heathcliff. The technology of film always did fulfil a deep-rooted Gothic fantasy, by capturing the spirits of the living, conjuring ghostly and disembodied forms, and re-animating the dead. Now the undead creatures of the Gothic imagination return to our screens again and again, shape-shifting and breeding new genres. In 2013 the BFI’s spellbinding season lifted the lid on this dark storehouse of the imagination, which found its heart in Britain, and came to life on film. Delve into a dark heart of film here.\n\nRead more Close\n\nRent for £3.50\n\nThe Elephant ManThe Elephant Man\n\nBiopic1980124 minsDirector: David Lynch\n\nDavid Lynch's moving true-life tale of the severely deformed Joseph Merrick and his rescue from the hell of a Victorian circus sideshow.\n\nRent for £3.50\n\nThe Limehouse GolemThe Limehouse Golem\n\nCrime2017109 minsDirector: Juan Carlos Medina\n\nBill Nighy plays the arch detective investigating a series of grisly murders around the music halls of Victorian London, in this pungent Gothic mystery.\n\nRent for £3.50\n\nPossumPossum\n\nHorror201885 minsDirector: Matthew Holness\n\n\"Can you spy him deep within?
