        "text": "Some Canadian classics are getting new life on digital thanks to a restoration initiative from Telefilm Canada. 23 Canadian titles will receive a proper digitization/restoration through Canadian Cinema – Reignited, which preserves Canadian films of “cultural relevance,” “importance in film history,” and “potential for commercial exploitation.”\n\n“Digitization and restoration help preserve our film history as well as create new opportunities to celebrate Canada’s filmmaking legacy, while paving the way for continued creativity, innovation, and international success,” said Francesca Accinelli, Vice President of Promotion, Communications and International Relations, in a statement from Telefilm Canada. “Since 2021, the Canadian Cinema – Reignited initiative restored nine seminal Canadian films with the support of the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television, the Festival du Nouveau Cinema, Hot Docs and the Toronto International Film Festival.”\n\nOn the documentary front, the list includes Brigitte Berman’s 1985 film Artie Shaw: Time is All You’ve Got. The portrait of the beloved musician won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature—and is one of only three Canadian feature films to hold that honour. The documentary was largely unavailable for years due to a lawsuit by Shaw even though he was one of the doc’s biggest fans.\n\nAlso receiving restorations/digitizations are the docudrama study of occupational health and safety La maladie, c’est les compagnies (1979) directed by Richard Boutet, the arts doc Les six saisons Attikameks (1983) by Pierre Dinel and Pierre Hivon, and Determinations (1988), director Oliver Hockenhull’s experimental study of the Vancouver Five. The list also includes dramas such as David Secter’s queer Canuck classic Winter Kept Us Warm (1965), which David Cronenberg cites as the film that taught him that Canadians could, in fact, make movies, and John Kaczender’s In Praise of Older Women (1978), which sparked enough controversy when it opened Toronto’s Festival of Festivals that it over-sold and reportedly sparked a near-riot. The list includes contemporary works such as Poor Boy’s Game (2007), directed by Clement Virgo, and Oscar nominees Incendies (2010) and Monsieur Lazhar (2011), directed by Denis Villeneuve and Philippe Falardeau, respectively.\n\nThe projects restored through Canadian Cinema – Reignited include:\n\nWinter Kept Us Warm (1965)\n\nDirector, screenwriter and producer: David Secter\n\nDigitization partner: Canadian International Pictures\n\nTiki Tiki (1971)\n\nDirector: Gerald Potterton\n\nScreenwriter: Jerome Chodorov, Donald Brittain and John Morgan\n\nProducers: Gerald Potterton and Murray Shostak\n\nDigitization partner: Canadian International Pictures\n\nIn Praise of Older Women (1978)\n\nDirector: George Kaczender\n\nScreenwriter: Paul Gottlieb\n\nProducers: Robert Lantos, Claude Heroux, Harold Greenberg and Stephen J.
