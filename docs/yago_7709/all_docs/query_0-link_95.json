        "text": "This could have been some sort of \"Taxi Driver\". Could, if they just could have pulled it along with Scorcese's skills. After all, low-budgeter \"Taxi Driver\" had all it took to make an exploitation movie. This one has the gritty realism, the context (Visions of some overall violent world from Ireland to Vietnam, even more relevant nowadays), the disturbing elements But does not seem to know what to do with them. We had an understanding of what Travis Bickle was up to, even if we were not in his head, we had enough to go with and sympathize (just like in real life actually), which makes even the botched attack on a political candidate an anti-anticlimax. Here, despite Mathieu Carrière's excellent acting, we have only disjointed things : he's a Vietnam vet, his wife cheated on him, he might be impotent and might have a death wish (though his actions denies it). How did it all comes together in one long, violent episode is anyone's guess. M. Carrière manages to keep the character's desperation obvious, but to what end ? It's not really a chain of events that leads him to his horrific deeds. The cheesy dialogue does not really helps, like a reference to lesbianism, fortunately without any moral tut-tutting, that leads nowhere. The whole things feels just like an experience in exploitation with some hints at social comment, or the other way around, if you feel so inclined. It's not bad, but it's one movie that could have been so much better if its various interesting elements have gelled into something coherent.\n\nA disturbed American war veteran -Mathieu Carrière- arrives in Belfast during the Northern Ireland conflicts , and proceeds to terrorize a household of female nursing students (Debra Berger , Christine Boisson , Myriam Boyer , Leonora Fani , Ely Galleani , Carole Laure , Eva Mattes) and executing tasteless tortures . For these nine young women, opening the door that night meant ending their live ! . Nine scaring young women. One night. Defiled. Tortured. Torn apart . A diabolic shocker that will grip you and hold you Spellbound ! . Don't ever let him enter your house ! No woman can escape him because he was Born for Hell\n\nA grim and thrilling film about a boarding house that is invaded by a heinous visitor , it contains inexplicable disturbing occurrences , shocks, thrills , suspense , chills , hair-rising events and surprising final . Dealing with an eerie story of a stranger who arrives in Belfast and invades a house shared by eight nurses , while carries out a criminal spree and proceeding to kill them . Loosely based on the notorious Richard Speck murders , this starts off at a brief depiction of the Besfast streets , pubs and violent confrontation between IRA members and British cops , as the camera lurks suspensenful behind its actors and beside them and above them and everywhere else . The story is uneven paced , suffering from some weak incidents and of varying quality , packing nice as well as fleeble moments . The main amusement of this slasher results to be to guess the kind of murder to execute by the creepy killer , and discover the young actress to be assassinated by stabbing . A scary and disgusting flick that garnered lousy reception as critics as indifferent reception by the general public . Nowadays , it is a little better considered , in spite of its short budget and the claustrophobic environment , as the picture goes on growing more and more and developing little by little until the unexpected ending . Nice acting by the German Mathieu Carrière as the unsettling Vietnam vet returning home via Belfast resulting in fateful consequences . He's well accompanied a lot of known B-actress from Europe that starred a lot of films at the time and in all kinds of genres , such as : Debra Berger , Christine Boisson , Miriam Boyer, Leonora Fani , Ely Galleani , Carole Laure and Eva Mattes who often played for Werner Herzog .\n\nAtmospheric cinematography , though being really necessary a perfect remastering . Shot on location in Hamburg, Germany , Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland (Belfast segments) , Belfast, County Antrimc, Northern Irelandc, UK and Studio Bendestorf, Lower Saxony, Germany . This chilling and obscure terror movie was regularly directed by Denis Héroux and uncredited Géza von Radványi . This nice filmmaker Denis Héroux, was born 1940 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and died 2015 in Montreal . He was a producer/director, and Member of the jury at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1981 . He was awarded the O. C. -Officer of the Order of Canada- on December 19 , 1983 for his services to the film industry in Canada . He was a notorious director and producer , being especially known for The Uncanny (1977) , Atlantic City (1980) , Quest for Fire (1981) , The Bay Boy (1984) , The Park in Mine (1985) . Denis directed some films in all sorts of genres , such as : ¨Born for Hell , Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris , Strikebreaker , Y'a toujours moyen de moyenner! , J'ai mon voyage! , Quelques arpents de neige , Un enfant comme les autres.., fois... par jour , L'amour humain , L'initiation , Valérie , Pas de vacances pour les idoles and Alone or with Others¨ . Born For Hell (1976) rating : 5/10 . Mediocre , though passable terror movie.\n\nA deeply troubled American Vietnam soldier, enters a violence-plagued Belfast from Saigon, where he encounters a house with nurses who share let, besieging them at night, binding their hands, gagging their mouths, promising not to hurt them. Cain(Mathieu Carrière)a cold, dark-hearted man, whose wife was impregnated by a soldier pal of his, is haunted by a terrible upbringing thanks in part to his mother. So the central female members of his life wronged him, and adding the weight of Vietnam and being left with next to nothing, no monetary means to sustain him, finding it difficult to get home, an unstable Cain is bound to snap, and the nurses will feel his quiet rage as he sexually humiliates them, while also often plunging his switchblade knife into their bodies. The film, while not as violent as it could've been, is extremely unsettling and depressing. The innocent victims do not deserve their fates and Cain removes each woman one by one, seeming harmless, only to run them through a series of emotionally and physically damaging acts. His methods are cruel and demeaning. Carrière presents his homicidal sadist with a calm exterior, trotting his pretty lambs to the slaughter as the other nurses await their doom in a bedroom, tied and frightened. While we perhaps aren't partakers to actually seeing the knife sticking into the bodies of his victims, the actions themselves are just as chilling, as is Cain's ways of conducting them. It doesn't seem to bother him. He orders the nurses to commit embarrassing sexual acts, either with him or each other. He strangles one female nurse with his belt when she wouldn't beg for his sexual embrace. One nurse, so distraught at what has happened to her friends and associates, uses Cain's knife to stab herself in the chest..watch his multitude of reactions to her collapsing body, it's a very unpleasant sight. Cain has \"Born for Hell\" tattooed on his arm and he proudly shows it off to the nurses. At first, it seems, he merely wants their money, but as he remains it's obvious that Cain succumbs to the sick, depraved desires that are going through his mind. \"Born for Hell\"(Also known as the \"Naked Massacre\")is in the same mold as \"Last House on the Left\", \"The Night Train Murders\" & \"The House at the Edge of the Park\", a twisted psycho with uncontrollable urges lashing out against vulnerable women. This film plays completely straight with no humor whatsoever creating an even more distressing tone. The environment of the setting where the killer commits his deeds only adds to the overall impact of this unflinching tale of hopelessness, despair and savagery.\n\nDespite being both powerful and haunting, I wouldn't call it entertaining, and I will probably never watch it again. Many will find it hard to sit through because the killer shows no mercy, leading his victims to certain death."
