In spite of a star studded cast which includes Jane Fonda, Anna Karina, Jean-Claude Brialy, Marie Dubois, Jean Sorel and Maurcie Ronet, this reworking of LA RONDE (like much of the director's other work), is sluggish, clunky and uninspired (with occasional production design flourishes). Vadim's focus was always on sex, and while the film pushes some boundaries of what was acceptable in that era, there's really very little else to recommend here, other than to observe how beautifully the actresses are presented (particularly Fonda). And from this gay man's eyes, it's too bad Vadim couldn't have allowed for some of the handsome men in his cast to be the recipients of his gaze as well.\n\nHow did Vadim take this incredibly horny play, and make it as boring and dry as possible? But with beautiful costumes, set design, and actors. I was really just here to see Jane Fonda.\n\nLoved the orchestral swell during the Count and the Actress, because who really cares what a hot dude has to say? Drown him out!\n\nThis doesn’t touch the greatness of Ophüls’ film at all, and the end piece makes it all about feminine something or other by showing shots of all the lady characters which is not at all the point.\n\nFilm #185 in MY YEAR OF MUBI\n\n***\n\nLike a full length PSA about the easy transmission of STDs.\n\nDude sleeps with Lady. Lady sleeps with other Dude. Other Dude sleeps with Other Lady. And so forth and so on, until we \"CIRCLE\" back to the first person again. Sigh.\n\nStories along the way? Boring and negligible. It's like a LIFETIME MOVIE made in '60s France. Really not my bag.\n\nThe premise is interesting (not original, but interesting) and that's about it. Moving on...."
