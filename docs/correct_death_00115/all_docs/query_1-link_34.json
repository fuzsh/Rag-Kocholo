        "text": "Howard Robard Hughes, Jr. (1905-1979) is a historic eccentric billionaire, business magnate, and aviator.\n\nHistory[]\n\nReal-life history[]\n\nDisney Parks[]\n\nIn1938, Howard invented a functioning jet-pack from a factory which he owned in Los Angeles, based on unsuccessful jet-packs made in Nazi Germany. This jet-pack was stolen by mobster Eddie Valentine who was working for the Nazi regime of the Third Reich and aimed to deliver the jetpack to the nazis. The jetpack however came into the possession of stunt aviator Cliff Secord and his inventor friend Peevy at Bigelow's Air Circus where they used it to make Secord the vigilante, \"The Rocketeer\".\n\nHughes and the FBI confronted the Rocketeer to demand the rocket-pack's return only for Secord to make off with it and fight the nazis over the skies of Hollywood as they kidnapped his girlfriend Jenny Blake. When the Rocketeer blew up the nazi's zeppelin and the jet-pack inside, Howard saved his and Jenny's lives by catching them in his autogyro alongside Peevy. Following these events, Hughes bestowed Secord with a gift in the form of a brand-new Gee Bee racing aircraft, unknowing that Cliff and Peevy had blueprints to rebuild the rocket-pack.\n\nFollowing 1955, Howard became a customer of a bar in the town of Disney Springs, Florida which was run by fellow aviator Jock Lindsey. Lindsey was a member of the Society of Explorers and Adventurers who was also a previous aviator in Bigelow's Air Circus where he performed alongside Cliff Secord and aviatrix Pancho Barnes.\n\nAppearances and allusions[]\n\nJock Lindsey's Hangar Bar[]\n\nIn the lost & found of S.E.A. member Jock Lindsey's bar are keys identifying Howard Hughes (referred to as Howard H.) as a patron of the bar.\n\nSoarin'[]\n\nHoward Hughes is commemorated in the Wings of Fame exhibit of Soarin' in Disney's California Adventure. He is shown alongside his airplane the Spruce Goose.[1]\n\nIn other media[]\n\nFilm[]\n\nThe Rocketeer[]\n\nIn this film, Howard Hughes was the inventor of a rocket-pack in the late 1930s. Said rocket is later stolen by the Nazis before passing through hands and into the possession of Cliff Secord.\n\nTomorrowland (film)[]\n\nIn this film, Howard Hughes was a member of the secret organization Plus Ultra which created the secret futurist colony of Tomorrowland.\n\nConnections[]\n\nIndiana Jones[]\n\nJock Lindsey is a character from Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) with Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar being set in the Indiana Jones continuity.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHoward served as an inspiration behind Charles F. Muntz in Up (2009) and Howard Stark in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). He is also sometimes thought to have served as partial inspiration for Indiana Jones from Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and Hathaway Browne from the Adventurers Club though this has not been confirmed.\n\nIn real-life history, Howard briefly served as owner of RKO Radio Pictures which distributed Disney films from 1937 to 1953."
