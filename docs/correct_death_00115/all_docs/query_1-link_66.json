        "text": "The Glomar Explorer\n\nIn 1972, Hughes was approached by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to help it recover the Soviet submarine K-129, which had sunk off the coast of Hawaii in 1968. Ostensibly designed to mine the deep sea for manganese nodules, Hughes built the ship, the Glomar Explorer, which pioneered new engineering, such as precision stability equipment that kept the Glomar stationary above a point on the ocean floor despite high winds or seas, and a moon pool that allowed access to the water below the ship without being seen. Existence of the mission only came to light after a burglary at the Hughes headquarters in 1974.\n\nA For-profit Entity of a Tax-exempt Charity\n\nIn 1953, Hughes launched the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) to do biomedical research. Hughes transferred all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the institute, making the aerospace and defense contractor a for-profit entity of a fully tax-exempt charity. By 2007, the HHMI was the fourth largest private organization in the world, and the largest organization devoted to biological and medical research, with an endowment of $16.3 billion.\n\nFour Months in a Screening Room\n\nThroughout his life, Hughes suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), had a phobia about germs and a mania for secrecy. In 1958, Hughes told aides that he wanted to screen some movies at a film studio near his home. He entered the darkened screening room and didn’t emerge for four months, having neither bathed nor cut his hair or nails.\n\nHughes became fixated on the 1968 film Ice Station Zebra and watched it repeatedly on a continuous loop in his home. Hughes would use tissues to pick up objects to avoid germs, and he stored his urine in bottles. Between 1966 and 1976, Hughes and an entourage of aides stayed in the top floor penthouses of hotels in Beverly Hills, Boston, Nassau, Freeport, Vancouver, London, Managua, Acapulco and Las Vegas.\n\nWhen the Desert Inn Hotel in Las Vegas asked Hughes to vacate its penthouse, Hughes refused and instead bought the hotel. This scenario is used to great effect at the beginning of Kevin Kwan’s novel “Crazy Rich Asians.” Hughes also bought several other Las Vegas hotels, including the Silver Slipper, which he bought for the sole purpose of removing its trademark neon silver slipper which Hughes claimed kept him awake at night.\n\nFake Piled on Fake Piled on …\n\nIn 1972, author Clifford Irving claimed to have co-written an authorized autobiography of Hughes, but before the book’s publication, Hughes took part in a teleconference refuting Irving’s claims. Irving was convicted of fraud and served 17 months in prison. In 1974, the Orson Welles film F for Fake questioned whether it was really Hughes who took part in the teleconference.\n\nIn 1977, The Hoax by Clifford Irving was published in the UK, and the 2006 film The Hoax is also based on these events.\n\nMelvin and Howard\n\nThree weeks after Hughes’s death, a handwritten will turned up on a desk of an official of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Salt Lake City Utah. This so-called “Mormon Will” gave $156 million of Hughes’s estate to a gas-station owner named Melvin Dummar.\n\nDummar claimed to have found a dirty and disheveled man lying in the desert north of Las Vegas. Dummar said that he had dropped the man off at the Sands Hotel, and that following Hughes’s death, the will had been dropped off at his gas station. The will was eventually ruled a fake, and Dummar’s story was turned into the 1980 Jonathan Demme movie Melvin and Howard.\n\nHughes’ Legacy\n\nAt the time of his death, Hughes was worth approximately $10 billion in today’s dollars. Having divorced his first wife in 1929, Hughes had gone on to marry and divorce actress Jean Peters, but neither of his two marriages resulted in any children. Also, Hughes didn’t leave behind a will. To date, according to the Wall Street Journal, 1,000 of Hughes’s distant relatives have benefited from his estate, collecting about $1.5 billion.\n\nMartin Scorsese’s 2004 film The Aviator is based on the life of Howard Hughes. That film won five Academy Awards. The 2011 film, Captain America: The First Avenger, a prequel to Iron Man 2, featured the father of Tony Stark (Iron Man), Howard Stark, who was based on Howard Hughes. Marvel Comics creator Stan Lee has stated that Tony Stark was based on Hughes.\n\nIn director Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight Trilogy, the character of Bruce Wayne is heavily influenced by Howard Hughes. Nolan is reported to have integrated material originally intended for a Howard Hughes biopic into the trilogy."
