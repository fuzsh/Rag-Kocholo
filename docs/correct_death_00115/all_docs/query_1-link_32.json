        "text": "When the 2004 Howard Hughes biopic “The Aviator” came out nearly 30 years after his death, a local physician who testified on the billionaire’s death decided it was time to revisit the strange case of the legendary entrepreneur.\n\nIn the explosion of litigation that followed Hughes’ 1976 death, Dr. Forest Tennant, now a West Covina pain specialist in semi-retirement, said a federal investigation ensued after a newspaper reported claims Hughes’ medical team had killed him purposely with powerful pain medication.\n\nTennant said he was tapped by the Drug Enforcement Administration to testify against Hughes’ personal doctor, Wilbur Thain.\n\n“I didn’t know much, but I was the best they had,” he said. “We really didn’t understand pain at that time, how serious it could be.”\n\nNow, with a greater understanding of pain and pain management, Tennant said he has gained nothing but respect for Hughes’ doctors, who treated the iconic Texan with daily doses of powerful painkillers known as opioids.\n\n“If they had not done so, he would not have survived,” he said. “They were excellent doctors. For their time, they did more than anybody could.”\n\nTennant wrote an article in the July/August issue of the medical journal Practical Pain Management, of which he is also editor, outlining his findings upon revisiting Hughes’ records.\n\nIn 1946, when Hughes was 41, the experimental airplane he was piloting crashed in Beverly Hills, leaving him with horrendous injuries – broken back bones, ribs, a crushed collar bone and serious burns requiring large skin grafts, Tennant said.\n\nThe fact he survived the accident is surprising, Tennant said.\n\nBut the consequence was intractable pain for the rest of his life, Tennant said. During Hughes’ final 30 years of life, Tennant added, that alone should have killed him.\n\nIntense, continuous pain takes its toll quickly, Tennant said, and if left untreated, leads to death. And little was known about how to properly treat it in Hughes’ day, he added.\n\n“Once (pain) reaches a certain magnitude, a biological line is drawn in the sand,” the 66-year-old physician said. “Really severe pain does kill you.”\n\nTennant said pain causes the body to produce an excess amount of adrenaline, a hormone that among other things, increases the heart rate and blood pressure.\n\n“You just kind of wear out,” Tennant said. “It’s like trying to run a marathon and you don’t stop.”\n\nHughes survived another 30 years before dying from kidney failure on April 5, 1976, a feat Tennant has not seen in his entire career of treating intractable pain patients.\n\n“Howard Hughes is actually kind of an icon,” Tennant said, adding his 70-year life span was a “medical miracle.”\n\nDr. Farshad Ahadian, associate clinical professor of anesthesiology and medical director of the Center for Pain Medicine at UC San Diego, said there is some evidence managing severe pain in terminally ill cancer patients improves their life span but added he could not apply that to all, non-cancer pain patients.\n\nHe said the pendulum of opinion on opioids has been swinging for a long time.\n\n“Opioids have been around forever,” he said. “They’re one of the oldest (types) of drugs there are.”\n\nWhile they can be a useful aspect of pain therapy, he said, they are also “very abusable.” He added that non-drug, interventional pain therapies are rapidly expanding in scope and popularity.\n\nWhile Hughes became as famous for his bizarre, reclusive behavior later in life as for his daredevil bravado, people familiar with him said the drastic change in his demeanor could be attributed to his last, most serious flying accident.\n\n“He almost died, he really should have died,” said Arelo Sederberg, a former Arcadia resident who was Hughes’ public relations consultant from 1970 to 1978. “It’s a miracle that he survived.”\n\nSederberg, who is writing a book about Hughes, speculates the crash and the aviator’s resulting injuries changed him radically.\n\n“He was always a little unsteady before that,” he said. “But after that accident, that’s when he really became a recluse.”\n\nIn Tennant’s article, he debuncts wide-spread belief that Hughes had syphilis, at least at the time of his death.\n\n“He might have had it in his younger years,” he said, but added that it could have been one of the many “malicious rumors” circulating.\n\nIn the end, Sederberg said, Hughes remains an enigma.\n\n“He’s been analyzed and re-analyzed,” he said. The curious thing about him is, he continues to attract interest. He’s been dead now 30 years.”\n\nSederberg said he wonders if, with all Hughes’ different personas and facets, he didn’t mean different things to different people.\n\n“In the long run, I guess he has the last laugh,” Sederberg said. “Because he left a lot of mystery.”\n\nbethania.palma@sgvn.com\n\n(626) 962-8811, Ext. 2236"
