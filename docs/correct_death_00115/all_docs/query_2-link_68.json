        "text": "If you're anything like most people, you've been living under the belief that billionaire Howard Hughes died skinny, crazy and reclusive, with broken-off hypodermic needles in his skin.\n\nThat's the Wikipedia version, the Leonardo DiCaprio movie version.\n\nWhat you probably didn't realize was that Hughes actually lived to be 96 years old and died as recently as Nov. 21, 2001, in southeast Alabama, after assuming another man's identity in 1969, giving a mentally deranged drug-addict imposter his own identity, and being married to one Eva Renee McLelland in the Goshen area for 31 years.\n\nIndeed, when Hughes died after living in seclusion in Alabama for some 25 years, McLelland scattered his ashes in Florida.\n\nThat's the McLelland version of things, the one that she reportedly revealed to a man named Mark Miller (see video below), who worked for the foundation to which Eva bequeathed some land she owned in Alabama. Miller reportedly then brought in Los Angeles-based author Douglas Wellman, who undertook research that Wellman believes substantiates McLelland's claim that she was Howard Hughes' wife.\n\nWellman, an assistant dean of the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California, undertook some 7 years of research and verification before publishing a book that purports to verify the claim. OK, it was self-published with a vanity press, WriteLife, but it was published nonetheless.\n\nWhat's more, after\n\nhit the shelves (or Internet, which is where most self-published books get sold), Wellman and a research associated, Mark Musick, claim that still more evidence has surfaced to that proves Hughes wasn't the emaciated man who arrived at a Houston morgue under the name John T. Conover.\n\nWant to know more? A somewhat lengthy description of \"Boxes: The Secret Life of Howard Hughes\" lays out the basic theory. And Musick will be at the Johnson Center for the Arts in Troy for a book signing at 2:30 p.m. Saturday, according to the Troy Messenger.\n\nOn Sunday, he will make a presentation at the Old Barn Restaurant in Goshen, then he speaks Monday at the Luverne Rotary Club at noon and at the Brundidge Lions Club at 6 p.m. Other appearances are scheduled through Thursday for anyone who wants to become a believer.\n\nThe only question is: Did Hughes die an Alabama or Auburn fan? Or was he a booster for the Trojans?"
