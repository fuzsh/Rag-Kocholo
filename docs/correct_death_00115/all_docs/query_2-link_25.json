        "text": "Background\n\nHoward Robard Hughes Jr., born on December 24, 1905, in Houston, Texas, was an American business magnate whose involvement in multiple sectors earned him reverence. His parents were Allene Stone and Howard R. Hughes Sr., a successful inventor who founded the Hughes Tool Company in 1909. Hughes was of English, Welsh, and French Huguenot descent. He developed an interest in science and technology at a young age, and by age 11, he built Houston’s first wireless radio transmitter. Hughes attended Fessenden School, Massachusetts, and took some courses at Caltech. By 1924, Hughes’ parents passed away, and his father had willed 75% of his wealth to him.\n\nIn 1926, Hughes financed and produced his first film, “Swell Hogan,” which was so much of a disaster that he ordered it to be destroyed. He then directed “Everybody’s Acting” (1926) and “Arabian Knights” (1927), which did well. The latter won the Academy Award for ‘Best Director of a Comedy Picture.’ In 1930, he spent $3.5 million to make “Hell’s Angels,” which received an Academy Award nomination for ‘Best Cinematography.’ He also produced “Scarface” (1932). That year, Hughes founded the Hughes Aircraft Company. He set many world air-speed records, like completing a flight worldwide in 91 hours in July 1938. Hughes and his crew earned the Collier Trophy for this and the Harmon Trophy for record-breaking global circumnavigation.\n\nBy 1944, Hughes purchased 78% of Trans World Airlines and even an Aerospace company. Still a movie producer, he bought R.K.O. Pictures for nearly $24 million in 1954 and sold his Trans World Airlines shares in 1966 for $546.5 million. Hughes began acting on his real estate interests, and in 1968, The Hughes Tool Company purchased the North Las Vegas Air Terminal. In 1972, he created the Howard Hughes Corporation. He refused to vacate his hotel room at the Desert Inn and bought the hotel instead in Las Vegas. Hughes put forward over $300 million in developing Las Vegas. He was instrumental in changing the city’s Wild West reputation to a refined cosmopolitan city.\n\nHughes was an extremely wealthy business magnate, which meant his personal life was public knowledge. In June 1925, Hughes married Ella Botts Rice. They got divorced in 1929. He dated many famous women, from Joan Crawford to Bette Davis, and Katharine Hepburn. He married Jean Peters in 1957, but they divorced in 1971. Hughes died on April 5, 1976, onboard an aircraft. He had no children and his fortune was divided among his 22 relatives, aides, charities, and former lovers."
