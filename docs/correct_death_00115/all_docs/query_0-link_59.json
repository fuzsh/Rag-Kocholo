        "text": "From Goose to Google Part 1: Howard Hughes Makes History\n\nHe had the mind for big dreams and the money to make them come true. Howard R. Hughes, Jr. (1905 – 1976) was one of the most famous, notorious, and mysterious people of the twentieth century. His mystique endures today.\n\nAs an only child in Houston, Texas, Howard Hughes was shy, withdrawn, and mechanically inclined. He built a ham radio at age eleven and motorized his bicycle at fifteen.\n\nHoward Hughes as a child. Photo courtesy San Diego Air and Space Museum Archive on Flickr.\n\nHoward Senior had made a fortune inventing a revolutionary oil-drilling bit. He died when Howard Junior was eighteen, leaving his son most of his estate. Howard Junior petitioned the court to be legally declared an adult, bought out other family members, and became sole owner of the Hughes Tool Company at nineteen. He then parlayed his inheritance into one of the century’s greatest fortunes.\n\nThe Filmmaker\n\n“Passion will make you crazy, but is there any other way to live?”\n\n– Howard Hughes\n\nIn 1925, Hughes moved to Los Angeles with his bride, socialite Ella Rice. He produced around twenty-five movies and directed two, Hell’s Angels (1930) and The Outlaw (1943). The first film he produced (Swell Hogan) was apparently so bad he never released it; the third (Two Arabian Nights) won an Academy Award.\n\nAs a controlling yet indecisive leader—a trait that would largely define his career—Hughes caused countless delays and cost overruns, neither of which seemed to bother him. When his constant interference drove two directors from the set of Hell’s Angels, Hughes took the helm and directed what is widely considered his best film. No wonder: it combined his passions for film and aviation.\n\nGrauman's Chinese Theatre during the premiere of \"Hell's Angels,\" 1931. Digitally reproduced by the USC Digital Library; From the California Historical Society Collection at the University of Southern California.\n\nHughes insisted on realism in Hell’s Angels, the story of World War I flying aces. Rather than the model planes used to that point, he insisted on using vintage WWI planes and real pilots for its dangerous aerial sequences. Three pilots died during the shoot. The film’s 1930 premiere at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre featured planes flying overhead and stuntmen parachuting onto Hollywood Boulevard. It was a hit.\n\nThe Aviator\n\n“I want to be remembered for only one thing: my contribution to aviation.”\n\n– Howard Hughes\n\nAs a teen, Hughes took a short flight on a seaplane that ignited a lifelong passion for aviation. He grew up to become an accomplished pilot, set multiple speed records, and pioneer advancements in the field.\n\nTo track his aviation expenses, in 1932 Hughes created the Hughes Aircraft Company as part of the Hughes Tool Company. He hired some of the country’s best young scientists and engineers and served as his own test pilot.\n\nAfter setting the around-the-world speed record in 1938, the Los Angeles Times called Hughes a “conqueror of space and time.” On the other hand, he had several major plane crashes, including one in a Beverly Hills neighborhood that nearly killed him.\n\nHoward Hughes stopping in Fairbanks, Alaska to refuel during his around-the-world flight that set a new speed record, 1938. Photo courtesy San Diego Air and Space Museum Archive on Flickr.\n\nAnticipating U.S. involvement in World War II, the keen entrepreneur saw a chance to get into the defense industry. In 1940, Hughes started buying farmland at the edge of Culver City (now Playa Vista) to build an aviation campus. The site opened in 1941 and grew exponentially along with the business. It eventually spanned over 1,300 acres, employed over 15,000 workers, and housed the longest private runway in the world.\n\nThe campus of the Hughes Aircraft Company drew, and inspired, some of the best scientific and technical minds in the country. For nearly half a century, the firm pioneered major innovations in aerodynamics, engineering, and communications. Among countless achievements, they built the world’s first commercial communications satellite—we have them to thank for DirectTV and XM Radio.\n\nFormer Hughes employees recall the campus as a self-contained village, with its own fire department, cafeteria, and healthcare clinic. The rich employee culture offered everything from on-site education to a bowling league and free turkeys at Christmas. Scientists considered it such an exciting and creative place to work that the personnel department had trouble getting them to go on vacation.\n\nThe Hughes Aircraft Company is perhaps best known for building the H-4 Hercules Flying Boat, or “Spruce Goose,” the largest aircraft ever flown. Employee Jan Marvin van Tamelen (“Van”) made scale models of what he called “The Goose” before becoming an art director for movies and TV shows, including (appropriately) Mission Impossible.\n\n“He used to say that Howard Hughes would often come to play cards with the guys on the team but never carried cash,” said his daughter, Victoria van Tamelen-Hall. According to her dad, Hughes “was a very nice man and would always pay if he lost, sometimes joking he would have to turn in his glass milk bottles to get some money.”\n\nThe Tycoon\n\n“Every man has his price, or a guy like me couldn’t exist.”\n\n– Howard Hughes\n\nHoward Hughes in the ticker-tape parade he received after setting the around-the-world flight speed record in 1938. Photo courtesy San Diego Air and Space Museum Archive on Flickr.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, Hughes’ industrial empire included the Hughes Tool Company, Hughes Aircraft Company, Hughes Productions, RKO Studios, and TWA Airlines. Combined, his interests employed 50,000 people and generated revenues of $1 million a day.\n\nYet his compulsive, controlling nature had caused more than its share of frustration among top managers at Hughes Aircraft. A number of them left, and Hughes became less involved in company operations.\n\nHaving suffered at least one nervous breakdown, Hughes became increasingly paranoid, neurotic, and germophobic. His earlier plane crashes had left him with intractable pain and multiple head injuries, to which some attribute (at least in part) his mental decline.\n\nHughes withdrew from public life in the fifties. In the mid-1960s, he moved to Las Vegas and started buying up Nevada real estate, from hotels and casinos to ranches and mining claims. He spent his final years living in luxury hotels around the world, taking extraordinary precautions to ensure complete seclusion.\n\nHoward Hughes died in 1976 at the age of seventy on an emergency medical flight from Acapulco to Houston. He had no valid will and an estate estimated at $2.5 billion.\n\nHis private physician attributed his death to kidney failure resulting from a combination of aspirin and severe dehydration. Described as “shriveled” and “emaciated,” Hughes had lost three inches of height, weighed ninety-three pounds, and had long, unkempt hair and nails. But he died in the air.\n\nThe Visionary\n\nHoward Hughes in 1938. Photo courtesy Wikimedia Commons.\n\nHoward Hughes left an indelible mark on moviemaking, aviation, and Los Angeles. His vision for the Hercules Flying Boat lives on in the plane itself (now on display in Oregon) and the unique landmark built for its construction.
