        "text": "Later years of Howard Hughes\n\nHughes’s penchant for privacy and seclusion often entangled him in controversy. This culminated in 1971 in a scandal over what were purported to be his memoirs, which were bought for book and magazine publication at sums totalling $1 million. The manuscript and letters concerning it that supposedly had been written by Hughes were subsequently found to be fraudulent and forged.\n\nIn his final years Hughes abruptly moved his residence from one place to another (The Bahamas, Nicaragua, Canada, England, Las Vegas, Mexico). As was the case with the Desert Inn, he took elaborate precautions to ensure absolute privacy in a luxury hotel and was rarely seen by anyone except a few male aides. Often working for days without sleep in a black-curtained room, he became emaciated and deranged from the effects of a meagre diet and an excess of drugs. In 1976 he died on a flight from Acapulco, Mexico, to Houston, Texas, to seek medical treatment."
