        "meta_description": "Entrepreneur and wildly successful businessman Howard Hughes died on board an airplane on April 5, 1976. The famously reclusive billionaire had no legitimate children and was not married at his death, having been divorced twice, and left behind a slew of scandalous relationships including alleged dalliances with actresses Bette Davis, Ava Gardner, and Katharine Hepburn. Another actress, Terry Moore, eventually settled a lawsuit against the estate claiming she had been secretly married to the billionaire on a yacht in international waters (yes, she wrote a book about it). Shortly after Hughes' death, a handwritten will was produced which purported to split Hughes' estate, which included a number of companies, seven Las Vegas casinos, an airport and several aircraft and a television station, collectively valued at somewhere north of $1.5 billion ($6.4 billion in today's dollars). Eventually, the will was deemed a forgery, along with dozens of other alleged wills, and Hughes was declared intestate. His estate was divided in 1983 among his 22 cousins.For more on intestacy, see this article.",
