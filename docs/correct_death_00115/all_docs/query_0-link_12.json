        "text": "HOUSTON, April 7—Howard Robard Hughes Jr. was buried net to his parents this morning after a simple, eight‐minute graveside ceremony.\n\nThere were no funeral‐home services, no procession to the cemetery, no pallbearers‘Funeral home attendants placed the billionaire's silvercolored copper coffin above the grave before the service. Two .dozen white roses, a spray of red anteriums, a bouquet of yellow carnations and a green unflowered wreath adorned it.\n\nAs 20 mourners, mostly cousins, sat on folding chairs, the Very Rev. Robert T. Gibson read the standard burial rites from the Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church.\n\n“We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out,” he read. He was the only person to speak. There was little visible emotion. No tears were observed.\n\nThe ceremony ended at 8:02 A.M., and the mourners entered their automobiles and drove off while about 30 reporters and photographers watched the coffin being lowered into stainless steel vault. Workmen then covered it with earth.\n\nSix hours later the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington .confirmed that the body was Mr. Hughes's. The reclusive industrialist died Monday of. kidney failure at the age of 70.\n\nThe said that it had matched fingerprints taken from the body at an autopsy here yesterday with those made by Mr. Hughes when he applied for a pilot's license in the 1930's. It was the first independen confirmation of the body's identity. Previous identification had been supplied by two personal physicians, Dr. Wilbur S. Thain and Dr. Lawrenc Chaffin, and by an aide, John M. Holmes Jr.\n\nThose three men had accompanied Mr. Hughes from Acapulco, Mexico, to Houston, where he was to have entered the Methodist Hospital for examination and treatment. They told doctors here that Mr. Hughes died at 1:27 P.M. Monday aboard their chartered jet.\n\nDr. Joseph A. Jachimczyk, the Harris County medical examiner, was invited to observe the autopsy. He said preliminary results indicated that the time of death was approximately as stated by Mr. Hughes's physicians. He said he suspected no foul play.\n\nMethodist Hospital officials said they did not plan to make public complete results of the autopsy when tests of body tissue were concluded.\n\nThe autopsy showed Mr. Hughes to be emaciated and he appeared to have been bedridden for months. At death, he weighed only 90 pounds. His height had shrunk 2 inches to 6 feet 2 inches.\n\nHis aides told medical officials here that he had been reluctant to drink water or to be medically examined. They said his condition weakened last week but that it stabilized on Saturday. Then on Sunday, he became worse and they made preparations to move him to a hospital.\n\nThe choice of the Methodist Hospital here was apparently made by Ken Wright, executive director of the Hughes Medical Institute in Miami. There is no record of Mr. Hughes's receiving treatment at the hospital. However, the institute has made grants for biomedical research to the Baylor College of Medicine since 1971, including $190,000 this year. Methodist Hospital is Baylor's teaching affiliate, and Mr. Wright had visited it recently.\n\nMr. Wright reportedly telephoned Dr. Henry D. Macintosh, the school's liaison official for grants and its chief of internal medicine, at 8:30 A.M. Monday. Mr. Wright told him he wanted to bring Mr. Hughes to the hospital, but he did not indicate what Mr. Hughes's medical problems might be.\n\nAfter the autopsy the body was taken to the George H. Lewis & Sons Funeral Home. At 7 A.M. today the hearse left the funeral home for the trip through Houston's Memorial Park to the Glenwood Cemetery, which is In a shabby neigborhood near downtown Houston.\n\nThe Hughes family plot is\n\nA private autopsy performed by Dr. Jack L. Titus, the hospital's pathellogist, yesterday afternoon showed the cause of death. Time of Death Confirmed\n\nChoice of Hospital in a heavily wooded area on a slope toward the back of the cemetery, which abuts Buffalo Bayou. There, beside a bamboo shrub and a paved cemetery road, the grave was dug just below and to the right of where his parents are buried.\n\nTheir graves have a simple flat marker, with fiye bronze trumpet‐like urns rising from it, and their names and dates, of birth and death embedded with bronze inlay.\n\nThe hearse arrived at 7:201 A.M. Mr. Hughes's relatives, led by Mrs. Frederick R. Lummis, an aunt and his closest next of kin, arrived 25 minutes later, Two Hughes aides were also at the graveside.\n\nMr. Gibson, the minister at the burial service, is dean of Christ Cathedral here. Mr. Hughes attended church there as a boy, and he was once named king at the church's annual May Day fete."
