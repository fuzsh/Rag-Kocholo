He was the only child of Allene and Howard Hughes Sr.\n\nSources: ABC13, Texas Monthly, The Rake, Irish Times\n\nThe Hughes were wealthy after Howard Sr. invented a popular drill bit that could grind through granite so oilers could access Texan oil, which he licensed out.\n\nSources: ABC13, Texas Monthly, The Rake, Irish Times\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHughes Jr., a shy boy, inherited his father's inventiveness. From a young age, he liked to tinker with mechanics. At 11, he built the first wireless radio in Houston. The next year, he built a motorbike.\n\nHe was clever, but he wasn't good at all subjects. According to handwritten communications found after his death, he couldn't spell the vice president's last name or his cousin's last name.\n\nSources: Far Out, New York Times, BBC\n\nFrom his mother, he developed an aversion to germs. Every day, she washed him with antiseptic scrubs. She taught him that germs were dangerous and had to be fought. This obsession would take over his life in the later years.\n\nSource: Irish Times\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth of Hughes' parents died within two years of each other, and at 19, he inherited his father's company and 75% of his fortune. His aunt arranged a marriage for him to Ella Botts Rice, a daughter from another respected Texan family, hoping it would keep him steady after the loss of his parents.\n\nSources: ABC13, Far Out, The Rake, Irish Times\n\nBut it didn't. Instead Hughes, who was not interested in running his father's company, dropped out of university and moved to Los Angeles with Rice so he could chase his two dreams — directing cinema and flying planes.\n\nSources: Far Out, Irish Times, Forbes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movies came first. After his first movie \"Swell Hogan\" flopped in 1926, he produced two respectable hits, including \"Two Arabian Knights,\" which won an Academy Award.\n\nSources: ABC13, Far Out, Texas Monthly\n\nAt the same time, he learned how to fly. In 1928, he earned his pilot's license.\n\nSource: Aerotime\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1930, his two passions came together when he directed and produced \"Hell's Angels,\" a film about fighter pilots during World War I. Hughes took over directing after firing the first two directors.\n\nSources: Aerotime, BBC\n\nHe didn't worry about costs — it would be one of the most expensive films ever made thus far at a price point of $3.8 million. Hughes' focus was on authenticity, and he used about 150 planes and hired stunt pilots to fly them. Three pilots died during filming.\n\nSources: Washington Post, BBC\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHughes made other films, most notably \"Scarface,\" based on gangster Al Capone's life, but in 1932, his focus was still on flying. He launched the Hughes Aircraft Company and began developing and flying modern planes.\n\nSource: Aerotime\n\nIn 1935, he broke the record for cross-country flying. He flew from Los Angeles to New York in 7 hours, 28 minutes, and 25 seconds.\n\nSource: Aerotime\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1936, then-President Theodore Roosevelt invited him to the White House to receive a special award for his flying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that same year, Hughes was booked for negligent homicide after he hit and killed a 59-year-old pedestrian named Gabe S. Meyer in his car after a night drinking with a 21-year-old woman named Nancy Bayly.\n\nIt was a foggy night, and he claimed he swerved to avoid an oncoming car. He told the newspapers it was his first accident since he'd begun driving at 12 and he had never \"even hit a cat or dog.\"\n\nHe got off without serving any time.\n\nSource: Los Angeles Times\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1938, he broke another flying record — this time for flying around the world in three days, 19 hours, and 17 minutes. He was so much quicker than expected that when he landed there were no photographers ready to take his photo.\n\nSource: The Rake Magazine\n\nHis flights weren't always smooth. He had his first plane crash in 1928 and his second in 1943 when he crashed into Lake Mead. But the crashes didn't stop him, and with all of the press around his record-breaking flights, his popularity soared.\n\nSource: Los Angeles Times\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHughes used his money to woo women. For instance, while chasing Ingrid Bergman, he paid $250,000 to buy every seat on a flight so she had to let him fly her to her destination.\n\nSources: ABC13, Irish Times, Daily Star, New Republic, The Rake, Texas Monthly\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he was courting Katharine Hepburn, he landed on her movie set in his plane. Hepburn thought it was a cheap move and got angry with Cary Grant, her co-star, for inviting Hughes onto the set.\n\nHe also proposed to other women, including Gene Tierney, who claimed he was \"incapable of loving anything that didn't have a motor in it.\"\n\nSources: ABC13, Irish Times, Daily Star, New Republic, The Rake, Texas Monthly\n\nSex appeal played a role in his films, too. In 1943, he made a critically panned film called \"The Outlaw,\" featuring Jane Russell. The film ended up a hit despite the negative reviews because the movie poster showed off the leading lady's body.\n\nSources: BBC, Daily Star\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring World War II, Hughes' focus turned to military planes and government contracts. He built planes for the war, including the XF-11.\n\nSources: NPR, Aerotime\n\nAnother project of his was \"The Spruce Goose,\" a H-4 Hercules built out of wood that was designed to carry troops across the Atlantic Ocean. To this day, it has the largest wingspan of a plane in history. But it wasn't finished until after the war and only made one flight.\n\nSources: NPR, Aerotime, Telegraph\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1946, while testing one of his planes, he crash landed into three houses in Beverly Hills.\n\nSources: The Rake, Los Angeles Times, Sunday Post, Irish Times\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was lucky to get out alive, but he was badly injured — he had a crushed collar bone, a collapsed lung, cracked ribs, his heart had been pushed to the right from the violent impact, and 75% of his body was covered in burns.\n\nThe injuries resulted in him suffering from chronic pain for the rest of his life and caused an addiction to painkillers.\n\nSources: The Rake, Los Angeles Times, Sunday Post, Irish Times\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring his hospital stay, he got fed up with the bed and designed a bed with a motor — this would be what future hospital beds were based on.\n\nSource: The Rake\n\nIn 1947, Hughes went before the Senate to explain why the government had invested $18 million in his Spruce Goose when it had never gotten off the ground and had been of no use during the war.\n\nSources: Time, New York Review of Books\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHughes was meant to be held accountable, but he fought back. He accused Sen. Owen Brewster of attempting to do backroom dealings by getting him to merge Trans World Airlines, an airline he had owned half of since 1939, with another airline in return for calling off the hearings.\n\nAccording to writer Gore Vidal, \"the inarticulate Hughes suddenly found his voice.\"\n\nSources: Time, New York Review of Books, St Louis Magazine\n\nIn 1948, Hughes bought the movie studio RKO Pictures for $24 million. This made him then the only solo Hollywood studio owner. He used a familiar formula for success for his movies — sex.\n\nSources: Irish Times, BBC\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this time he took it further. He signed with beautiful actresses — at one point, he had more than 150 on payroll — and kept them under his control, often moving them into bugged apartments where their phones were tapped.\n\nKarina Longworth wrote about Hughes in her book, \"Sex, Lies, and Stardom in Howard Hughes's Hollywood.\"\n\nShe said Hughes' control over his actresses was \"an open secret in Hollywood at the time.\"\n\n\"Howard Hughes was not the only mogul in Hollywood who profited off treating actresses as sex goddess flavors of the month,\" Longworth wrote. \"... Hughes did the same things that other men did — he just did them more crudely.\"\n\nSources: Irish Times, BBC, Los Angeles Times\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe hired assistants specifically from the Mormon Church to keep these actresses locked up. He trusted these men because they didn't smoke or drink.\n\nAccording to Longworth, after spending the 1930s dating famous actresses, from the 1940s on, his taste in women had cemented. He chose a type — one that didn't age, even as he did.\n\n\"Big breasts, brunette, high drama,\" she wrote, describing the women that Hughes tended to pursue.\n\nHughes later sold the movie studio in 1957. He said Hollywood had become \"too complicated\" for him.\n\nSources: Irish Times, Los Angeles Times, New Republic, Britannica\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1957, Hughes married actress Jean Peters, who according to some sources was the \"only woman he'd ever loved.\" But according to others, Peters was a cover to stop Hughes from being sectioned, and they didn't touch and only talked on the phone.\n\nThe couple got divorced in 1971.\n\nSources: Far Out, Irish Times, Sydney Morning Herald\n\nAlong with buying planes and movies, Hughes also used his fortune to buy power. He contributed up to $400,000 a year in political donations for all sorts of public figures, from local tax assessors to vice presidents.\n\nSource: New York Review of Books\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1956, his political donations came under scrutiny when then-Vice President Richard Nixon asked Hughes for a $205,000 loan for his brother Donald's burger chain. Hughes agreed.\n\nThe following election cycle, the loan was made public, and the press focused on the fact Hughes had a hold on the Nixon family.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the loan played a role in Nixon's loss to John F. Kennedy.\n\nDespite the loan, Donald Nixon had to close his burger business anyway the following year.\n\nSources: New York Review of Books, New York Times\n\nAs he aged, Hughes' behavior became increasingly eccentric. For instance, a report said he spent four months in a dark screening room, often naked, watching films and eating nothing but chicken, chocolate, and milk.\n\nSource: Sunday Post\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1966, he checked into the top floor of the Desert Inn in Las Vegas. When he was asked to leave on New Year's Eve, he responded by purchasing the hotel. This was the beginning of his erratic spending spree across the city.\n\nHe would end up spending about $300 million buying six casinos, alongside other assets like a television station, in just two years.\n\nHis purchases were often referred to as the reason the mob's hold on the city ended.\n\nSources: Texas Monthly, Las Vegas Review-Journal, BBC\n\nBut Hughes wasn't visiting any of the places he was buying because he had become a recluse. Hereditary deafness made socializing difficult for him, and he had a growing paranoia that germs were going to kill him.\n\nSource: New York Review of Books\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe cut himself off from the world, rarely leaving the top floor of the Desert Inn. From 1966 on, less than half a dozen people other than his staff ever saw him.\n\nLater, Hughes left Las Vegas, but he was never seen in public again. He quietly moved between cities and countries, including the Bahamas and Nicaragua.\n\nSources: Far Out, New York Times, New Republic\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring this period, he faced lawsuits from his airline TWA. He was accused of hiring a CEO to basically do what he wanted, including making purchase orders from his other company, Hughes Tool Company.\n\nHe ended up selling his portion of TWA in 1966 for $546.5 million and sold Hughes Tool in 1972.\n\nHe merged the rest of what he owned into a company called the Summa Corporation.\n\nSources: Sydney Morning Herald, St Louis Magazine, Forbes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDue to the chronic pain from his plane crash injuries, he became increasingly addicted to Valium and codeine. His mental state deteriorated. He saved his urine and stopped cutting his hair. Some reports said he let his toenails grow so long he was unable to walk.\n\nNoah Dietrich was one of Hughes' most trusted confidants until they had a falling out in the late 1950s.\n\n\"Hughes survived three major airplane crashes and an automobile crash that put him out for two days,\" Dietrich told Forbes in 1972. \"His head was badly banged around in all of these, and I think his mental condition can be directly attributed to those crashes.\"\n\nSources: UPI, Texas Monthly, Far Out, Irish Times, Forbes\n\nThe public spotlight on Hughes began to fade as time went on. A publicist named Mike Watson offered a $5,000 reward for any photos of Hughes taken after 1968. Watson didn't clarify who the photo was for or why they wanted it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there would be no more photos of Hughes alive. On April 5, 1976, he died of renal failure on a chartered flight to Houston from his Mexico penthouse.\n\nA photographer named Doug Tisdale told ABC13 that even though he was called into the morgue to see Hughes' body, he didn't recognize it.\n\nHe said he saw an old man with long silver hair, when all he knew was what had seen of published photos when Hughes was young.\n\nSources: New York Times, ABC13\n\nBut for a man as wealthy as Hughes — who had no will nor children — that wasn't the end of the story.\n\nSource: Time\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout 600 people came forward with claims on his fortune. There were 40 fake wills as well, including one that would have given the majority of his estate to the Mormon Church, along with a portion to a young gas attendant Hughes had reportedly met years earlier.\n\nSources: Time, WREG, Washington Post, New York Times\n\nAn old wife of Hughes even came forward. Actress Terry Moore claimed she married Hughes in 1949 when she was 18 and he had been 43 and that it was never annulled. Moore later settled with the estate in 1983 for an undisclosed amount.\n\nSources: New York Times, Washington Post\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end, the US government — via inheritance taxes going to Texas and California — received $169 million of the estate that was conservatively estimated to be worth $500 million at the time.\n\nBut it took decades before it was all wrapped up.\n\nBy 2010, more than 30 years after he died, over 1,000 people, including 200 of Hughes' relatives, had received a share of the $1.5 billion that came from selling off the estate's assets.\n\nSources: Texas Monthly, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal\n\nThough Hughes had told his friend he only wanted to be remembered for his contribution to aviation, it was not to be. As impressive as his records were, they were overshadowed by everything else that happened during his checkered life.\n\nSource: Irish Times\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement"
