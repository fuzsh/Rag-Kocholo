        "text": "It’s no secret that my favorite hotel (of all time) is the TWA Hotel at JFK. I’ve stayed there four times since 2019, and every experience has been nothing short of amazing. For my most recent visit, I decided to splurge on the Howard Hughes Suite. It was spectacular.\n\nReality check: “spectacular” doesn’t always mean “luxurious.” In the context of the TWA hotel, it means that the views of the airport (combined with the vintage airline vibe oozing from every corner of the suite) made it an experience I’m not likely to forget.\n\nA full review of my one night stay inside the Howard Hughes Suite at the TWA Hotel\n\nSpoiler alert: all rooms at the TWA hotel feature the same vintage-themed furniture and airline decor. The only difference comes down to size and views. The Howard Hughes Suite is the largest room you can get. Being on the 8th (top) floor, it also offers the best views of the airport.\n\nLocation\n\nThe TWA Hotel is connected to Terminal 5 at the John F Kennedy Airport in New York (JFK). The easiest way to access it is from the arrivals (baggage claim) level of T5. You can also access it via its own dedicated driveway. Parking is available directly across from the main entrance.\n\nThe lobby (and checking in)\n\nChecking in at the TWA Hotel is a fully self service experience. Follow the instructions on the automated kiosks to get your room key. Don’t worry – there are always several employees on site to assist anyone who needs a little help.\n\nThe lobby itself is nothing short of amazing. This is the old TWA terminal (built in the 1960s), and it has been restored to absolute perfection. It looks exactly the same today as it did back then. Well, with modern touches of course.\n\nGetting to my suite\n\nThere are two separate wings at the TWA hotel (the Saarinen Wing and the Hughes Wing). Obviously, the Howard Hughes Suite is located on the top floor of the Hughes Wing. Access is made possible through a long (blood red) corridor pumping out vintage 60s music. It’s awesome.\n\nThe Howard Hughes Suite\n\nOpening the door to the suite felt every bit as thrilling as I thought it was going to be. Not only was I hit over the head with the same vintage design elements I enjoyed so much from past stays, the huge windows overlooking the airport were nothing short of stunning.\n\nIt was basically a much larger version of every other room that I had experienced at this hotel (with a much better view of course).\n\nThe view\n\nThe views of both Terminal 4 and 5 are excellent. And because JFK is a 24 hour airport, there’s always something to see at any hour of the day (or night).\n\nIt wasn’t only the view that made this suite so amazing. It was also the sound. Basically, if you don’t like the sounds of a functioning airport (baggage carts, airplane APUs, idling jet engines, etc.), you’re probably not going to enjoy this.\n\nThe bathroom\n\nBased on my past experiences at this hotel, the bathroom in the Howard Hughes Suite isn’t any different than it is in other rooms. It’s larger, for sure, but all of the other details are the same.\n\nPros and cons of spending more for the Howard Hughes Suite\n\nWarning: the Howard Hughes Suite is not for anybody looking for a 5-star / ultra luxurious hotel experience. The TWA Hotel just isn’t that kind of property. It is, however, perfect for anyone who wants a stylish (and unique) experience with the best views of the airplanes and airport terminals.\n\nPros\n\nYou won’t find a better view from any other room at the TWA Hotel.\n\nYou won’t find a larger room either. It’s the biggest room they have.\n\nIt’s surprisingly quiet considering how close it is to the airport. All of the runways are very far away, so the only noise you’ll hear is luggage carts and taxiing airplanes.\n\nCons\n\nEverything in the suite (furniture, decor, etc) is exactly the same as what you’d find in the cheapest room on the property.\n\nThere are no extra perks for guests of the Howard Hughes Suite. There’s no dedicated check in, lounge access, etc. You’ll be treated just the same as the guy who paid a cheapo rate for a basement room with no view.\n\nSimilar Posts\n\nThe Sheraton Gateway Hotel is a convenient “so-so(ish)” option for weary travelers\n\nBy\n\nThe Gateway Sheraton at the Toronto International Airport is a fantastic airport hotel.
