        "text": "Howard Hughes’ history in Palm Springs is mysterious even by Hughes standards.\n\nThe eccentric billionaire and one-time studio chief owned or lived in three Palm Springs homes, according to Realtor Eric G. Meeks, author of “The Best Ever Guide to Palm Springs Celebrity Homes.” That doesn’t count the house in the Southridge District that Oranj Palm Vacation Homes calls the “Howard Hughes Mini Estate,” or the Mesa District house now occupied by former Walk of Stars board member Bill Beck, who says Hughes once resided there.\n\nThe late Palm Springs Mayor Frank Bogert, who arrived in Palm Springs in 1927, said Hughes had several local houses. He said Hughes put aluminum foil over the windows and it was suspected he was “keeping” women there for his personal pleasures.\n\nHughes, who died in 1976 at age 70, spent considerable time romancing women in Palm Springs. Howard Johns wrote in his book, “Palm Springs Confidential,” that Hughes and actress Ava Gardner checked into the Ingleside Inn on Oct. 12, 1946 under the assumed names of Hughes’ mechanic, Earl Martyn, and his secretary, “Mrs. Clark.”\n\nMore: Amazing turnout of Foreign Language Oscar-contending directors at panel\n\nMore: What else is happening in desert this weekend besides foreign films\n\nGardner says in her memoir, “Ava: My Story,” Hughes beat her after she rejected his advances and she had to be stopped by her sister from killing Hughes. They had a long, complicated friendship, she wrote, and she had to tell her husband of the 1950s, Frank Sinatra, “I had never slept with or even had a necking session with that man.”\n\nKarina Longworth, host of the “You Must Remember This” podcast “exploring the secret and/or forgotten histories of Hollywood's first century,” said in an email interview, “That’s not what my research suggests. Certainly Ava’s commentary on the matter indicates they had a sexual relationship.”\n\nLongworth has written a new book titled “Seduction: Sex, Lies and Stardom in Howard Hughes’ America.” It's not a Hughes biography, she says, “but a group portrait of 10 actresses who were involved with him, professionally and/or personally, during the period he was active in Hollywood\" – roughly the mid-1920s through the 1950s.\n\nThat book is the basis for a special event the film festival is presenting with her Thursday in which she will give an in-depth talk followed by a book-signing and a screening of the Marilyn Monroe-Jane Russell-starring film, “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,” at 4 p.m. at Palm Springs Cultural Center (formerly known as Camelot Theatres).\n\nHer Desert Sun interview was conducted over two e-mail exchanges, one before I had a chance to peruse more than a few pages and another after reading portions of the book and doing follow-up research.\n\nTHE DESERT SUN: So much has been written about Howard Hughes. What inspired you to write this?\n\nLONGWORTH: I was inspired not so much by Hughes himself, but a desire to use his time in Hollywood and his connections not only to these actresses but also some of the major flash points in Hollywood history (the transition from silent film to sound, the evolution of film censorship, the Blacklist) to help paint a portrait of what it was like to be a woman in Hollywood during this time.\n\nLook up Howard Hughes on IMDb.com and it says his nickname is \"The World's Greatest Womanizer.\" It's hard to know what that means in today's world, but, would you say it's true?\n\nThat was the kind of mythology I wanted to deconstruct with the book. Even just pairing the word “womanizer” with the word “greatest” is an example of the kind of default sexism that has historically run through so much film historical writing and conversation. I wanted to try to look at the Classical Hollywood Era from a different perspective.\n\nWhat's the best or most interesting thing movie fans will find in your book that they won't find in any other book about Howard Hughes or old Hollywood?\n\nI write extensively about Ida Lupino, an actress who dated Hughes when she was a teenager in the 1930s and then, 15 years later, became the most prolific female Hollywood director of the time, working for Hughes’ studio, RKO. Lupino is a feminist icon who was perceived as an anti-McCarthy liberal, but my book reveals she actually volunteered information to the FBI that helped enforce the blacklisting of her friends and colleagues.\n\nThe legendary Hollywood pimp, Scotty Bowers, says Hughes was completely heterosexual. But another Hughes biographer, Charles Higham, said he was bi. Who do you agree with?\n\nI think it’s problematic to impose a label on a living person’s sexuality, and basically pointless to try to do it to a long dead person who lived in a period before virtually anyone had the freedom to publicly embrace a fully honest sexual identity. That said, in my book I explore the relationship between Hughes, Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, the rumors dating back to the 1930s of their “queerness,” and how Hepburn used her relationship with Hughes to broadcast an image of herself as a heterosexual romantic figure which helped to save her career.\n\nDo you think there was one person who could be called the love of his life?\n\nThe Hughes I felt like I got to know through my research was not that sentimental. I think he got a sexual thrill from watching women — on screen, through surveillance — but emotional intimacy and real connection was rare for him, if not impossible.\n\nWhat made Jane Russell different from the women Hughes pursued sexually? Why would he keep his hands off her to preserve her reputation but not do the same for (actresses) Billie Dove, Jean Harlow or Faith Domergue?\n\nAs I write in the book, I don’t believe Hughes and Harlow did have a sexual relationship. It seems notable that Hughes didn’t have sexual relationships with the two actresses who he really put sincere effort into promoting as stars (Harlow and Russell). In both cases, I believe Hughes exhausted his attraction to the actress through the voyeurism and obsessive focus on their bodies that he channeled into making “Hell’s Angels” and “The Outlaw” and, more significantly, marketing them. When there was a sexual or romantic relationship complicating matters, he either failed to effectively transition from lover to successful producer – as with Dove – or, more frequently, he used the promise that a relationship with him would lead to stardom to string the women along virtually indefinitely. No woman who Hughes had a confirmed affair with became a star, or a bigger star, as a result of films he cast her in.\n\nThe program for “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” says Hughes began promoting Russell as “a new bombshell” in 1940 but the movie that really put her over the top didn’t come along until 13 years later and it had nothing to do with Hughes.” Why do you think Hughes wasn’t able to give Russell that kind of success?\n\nThere are two factors. For one thing, Hughes insisted on pulling “The Outlaw” from release after its initial run in San Francisco at the peak of his publicity blitz, and it was not seen by most of the general public until years later. Then, when it was seen, it didn’t showcase Russell’s talents fully. It was only interested in objectifying her physically. Just as with Harlow, Hughes didn’t seem to realize or care that he was working with a woman who would become a genius at a certain type of comedy. With Russell he failed to understand, initially, that her true talents lay in comedy and cabaret. Hughes began to take advantage of Russell’s ability to sell a song after she showed she could do so on one of “The Outlaw’s” press tours. Then he grafted that aspect of her persona onto his RKO noirs, “His Kind of Woman” and “Macao,” and the misbegotten Western, “Montana Belle.” But “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” was the first blockbuster film to showcase Russell using those talents at full strength.\n\nYou mention Hughes had a home in Palm Springs and stayed in hotels there. Do you know much about his life in Palm Springs, like where he’d go on dates or who he’d see? Did he fly a plane into the desert? What was his attraction to the area?\n\nHe did fly his plane into Palm Springs when he visited. There is a photograph of Hughes in Palm Springs with Ida Lupino in the 1930s, and Faith Domergue said they spent much of their early relationship there. I think Hughes was drawn to Palm Springs for the same reasons a lot of stars and wealthy people were: for the relative anonymity and privacy it offered – particularly in the 1920s to 1940s when Hughes would have been visiting – and the sense that what happened in the desert could stay in the desert if one desired. It doesn’t seem coincidental that two of the Hughes girlfriends we know he spent time with in Palm Springs, Lupino and Domergue, were teenagers at the time.\n\nGiven that he had his own pimp in Johnny Meyer and probably used other pimps, including Bowers, how do you think he compares as a \"womanizer\" or sexual predator to some of the men accused of sexual misconduct today?\n\nI see Hughes as less of a Harvey Weinstein figure and more of a Donald Trump figure. Like Trump, Hughes was obsessed with his public image but pretended to shun the media; like Trump, he worked hard to obscure the true details of his failures; and like Trump his interactions with women suggest an inability to see them as human beings who exist as anything but vehicles for his own pleasure and taste for abuse.\n\nTo discover which films the curators think you should see at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, watch the daily videos accompanying this column.
