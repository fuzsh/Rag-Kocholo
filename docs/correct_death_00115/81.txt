Today, April 5, marks the anniversary of the death of Howard Hughes. One of America’s most enigmatic billionaires died on this day in 1976.

Born in Texas in 1905, Hughes was world renowned as a businessman, film maker and philanthropist. He is also known for his pioneering work in aviation.

In later life he became infamous for his eccentric behaviour and reclusive lifestyle.

Hughes made his initial fortune as a young man when he took over his father’s company selling drill bits to oil companies. As his wealth grew, Hughes began producing Hollywood films, including the original Scarface in 1932.

Hughes was fascinated by aviation and set up his own aircraft company in 1932. He was a keen pilot himself and set a record time when he flew around the world in 1938.

Hughes Aircraft Company designed and built some of the finest commercial and military planes of their time. Hughes left the company in the early 1950s.

Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Howard Hughes in Martin Scorsese’s 2004 film The Aviator, which tells the story of Hughes’ life.

The film also stars Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn, one of many classic Hollywood actresses Hughes was rumoured to have dated.

Towards the end of his life Hughes became a recluse, living in fancy hotel penthouses across the globe. He suffered from severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and exhibited bizarre behaviour.

Some speculated that his crippling fear of germs meant he spent his later years living in the dark, wearing no clothes and eating very little.

Hughes died on April 5, 1976 while on a plane between his hotel penthouse in Mexico and the Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas.

By the time of his death he had let his hair, beard and fingernails grow out to extraordinary lengths, making him almost unrecognisable. An autopsy concluded that he had died as a result of kidney failure.
