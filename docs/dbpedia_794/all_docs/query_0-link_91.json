        "text": "Citation preview\n\nIsraeli Foreign Policy since the End of the Cold War\n\nThis is the ﬁrst study of Israeli foreign policy towards the Middle East and selected world powers including China, India, the European Union and the United States since the end of the Cold War. It provides an integrated account of these foreign policy spheres and serves as an essential historical context for the domestic political scene during these pivotal decades. The book demonstrates how foreign policy is shaped by domestic factors, which are represented as three concentric circles of decision-makers, the security network and Israeli national identity. Told from this perspective, Amnon Aran highlights the contributions of the central individuals, societal actors, domestic institutions and political parties that have informed and shaped Israeli foreign policy decisions, implementation and outcomes. Aran demonstrates that Israel has pursued three foreign policy stances since the end of the Cold War – entrenchment, engagement and unilateralism – and explains why. amnon aran is Senior Lecturer in International Politics of the Middle East at City, University of London where his main research focuses on the Arab-Israeli conﬂict and the foreign policy of Middle Eastern states. He has contributed to the EU’s Middle East Peace Task Force and he comments on Middle Eastern affairs for the BBC, Bloomberg, Financial Times and the Guardian.\n\nCambridge Middle East Studies Editorial Board Charles Tripp (general editor) Julia Clancy-Smith F.

The collapse of the Soviet Union, which had supported Israel’s Arab foes, ended the bipolar world order and established the United States, Israel’s closest ally, as the world’s sole superpower. Shortly, thereafter, in the 1990–1 Gulf War, a US-led coalition expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait, exposed deep divisions within the Arab world and weakened the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), which supported Iraqi president Saddam Hussein during the conﬂict. These dramatic international shifts were coupled with changes within Israel. The successful restructuring of the Israeli economy via the 1985 Economic Emergency Stability Plan (EESP) and arrival of close to a million immigrants from the former USSR greatly increased Israel’s state capacity to seize the opportunities and tackle the challenges generated by the end of the Cold War. This book accounts for Israeli foreign policy since the end of the Cold War by proposing a new argument, namely, that it revolved around three foreign policy stances: entrenchment, engagement and unilateralism. As the Cold War drew to a close, Israeli foreign policymakers were deeply divided about which of these foreign policies to pursue. Prime Ministers Binyamin Netanyahu and Yitzhak Shamir, leaders of Likud, Israel’s largest centre-right party, opted for retaining what I describe as Israel’s foreign policy of entrenchment. This foreign policy position hinged on basing Israel’s regional foreign policy on its iron wall of military might rather than on diplomacy and making peace with the Arab world in exchange for peace not territory. The Palestinians residing in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel had captured during the 1967 ArabIsraeli war, would be granted limited autonomy, but remain under Israeli military occupation. Prime Ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, the leaders of the Labour party, Israel’s largest centre-left party at the time, favoured a different foreign policy stance. Both were more optimistic than Shamir about the opportunities presented by the end of the Cold War, 1\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nbut were more pessimistic about the prospects of prolonged occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Rabin and Peres pursued what I term Israel’s foreign policy of engagement. This involved making peace with the Arab world in exchange for returning territories that Israel had occupied in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, putting a premium on diplomacy rather than on military force when engaging with the Middle East and downscaling the Israeli occupation. The limits to entrenchment and engagement became clear within the decade after the end of the Cold War, giving rise to what I call Israel’s foreign policy of unilateralism. It will be seen that unilateralism was associated mostly with prime Ministers Ehud Barak, Ariel Sharon and, to a lesser extent, Ehud Olmert. It was based on the recognition that downscaling the occupation was in Israel’s national interest, but not via an agreement with an Arab counterpart, once Israeli foreign policymakers deemed it unachievable. Instead, Israel would negotiate its unilateral territorial withdrawal to recognized borders with the international community. Since the withdrawals were carried out without mutually binding agreements, Israel would manage the consequences of unilateralism by deploying military, diplomatic and economic foreign policy tools. Thus, unilateralism, like engagement, embodied an understanding that was shared by ﬁve of the seven Israeli prime ministers since the end of the Cold War. Although Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, Ehud Barak, Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert were of different political persuasions, they all concluded that occupation of the Gaza Strip and the whole of the West Bank was not in Israel’s interest. During their periods of ofﬁce, to lesser or greater degrees, all sought to change the territorial status quo that had emerged following the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon. In contrast, Yitzhak Shamir and Binyamin Netanyahu, during their premierships, opposed engagement, citing ideological and security reasons and had no faith in unilateral foreign policy moves. Why did Israel’s prime ministers choose to pursue these particular foreign policy stances? What explained their respective foreign policy records? These vital questions are explored by this book. Israel’s foreign policy towards its most immediate and acute foreign policy arena, the Middle East, was linked inextricably to its wider foreign policy. The end of the Cold War presented Israel with some fundamental questions concerning its relations with the USA. The strategic alliance between the two states was forged during the Cold War as the USA identiﬁed Israel as a bulwark against Communism. Could the alliance survive the collapse of the USSR? Israel also faced serious dilemmas over its relations with the European Economic Community (EEC), harbinger of the European Union (EU), which, towards the end of the Cold War,\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nbacked the Palestinian struggle for an independent state more vocally and explicitly than in the past. Could Israel’s ties with the EEC, its largest trading partner, endure amid the deepening rift? Shifting the spotlight to the east, Israeli foreign policymakers had other matters to consider. Russia, which emerged as a weak state following the collapse of the USSR, was constrained in its ability to exert inﬂuence externally; it took the best part of ten years for it to rebuild itself amid US international domination. Meanwhile, China and India became rising powers. These countries, which are the world’s most populous, have space programmes and nuclear weapons and rapidly developing economies, had refused to normalize relations with Israel during the Cold War. In fact, China and India were strongly supportive of the Arab states and especially the Palestinians. China was the ﬁrst non-Arab country to recognize the PLO in 1965, while India likened the Palestinian struggle against Israel to its own anti-colonial path to independence from Britain. Did the end of the Cold War create an opportunity for Israel to normalize relations with these erstwhile hostile states? These intriguing questions are explored in Chapters 6 and 17, which draw links between Israel’s foreign policy towards the Middle East, established powers, such as the EU and the USA, and rising powers, namely, China and India. These chapters are designed to place Israel’s policy in the Middle East in a global context rather than to provide a comprehensive account of Israel’s relations with these established and emerging powers. Israeli foreign policy since the end of the Cold War is hardly a neglected topic. As the Cold War drew to a close a group called the Israeli revisionist, or ‘new’ historians, Avi Shlaim, Benny Morris, Ilan Pappe and Simha Flapan, closely scrutinized the standard Zionist version of the ArabIsraeli conﬂict. Avi Shlaim’s monumental study, The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World and Benny Morris’s own history of the conﬂict from 1881 to 2001, entitled Righteous Victims, remain the most enduring contributions of the new historians.1 These ground-breaking studies challenged the claim that the fundamental cause of the Arab-Israeli conﬂict since 1948, including during the post-Cold War period, was the Arabs’ rejection of Israel’s legitimacy to exist and Arab diplomatic intransigence. Although Benny Morris changed his political views in the wake of the Palestinian al-Aqsa intifada, laying the blame at the door of the Palestinians, the impact of the new historians is irreversible.

In addition to the literature generated by Israeli foreign policy towards the Arab world, students have beneﬁtted from excellent studies on Israel’s bilateral relations with, inter alia, Iran, the USA, the EU, India and China, in addition to the several excellent scholarly accounts of particular episodes in Israeli foreign policy.2 However, the extremely rich studies of Israeli foreign policy towards various arenas – the Middle East, the EU, the USA and Asia – are usually kept in separate compartments. I have tried in this book to provide a more integrated narrative by placing Israel’s foreign policy towards the Middle East in the context of its relations with the EU, USA, China and India. The structure of the book reﬂects the relative weight of each foreign policy arena. For example, US-Israeli relations attract more attention because they are more signiﬁcant to Israeli foreign policy than any of the other bilateral relations. Similarly, Israel’s most fateful foreign policy decisions – concerning war and peace – are taken in relation not to the EU, China or India, but to the Middle East, which dominates this book. However, in a departure from current debate, I place Israel’s Middle Eastern foreign policy within the wider context of its relations beyond the region. The story I present examines how, when and why Israel’s distinct approaches – entrenchment engagement, and unilateralism – to the Middle East, intersect with its foreign policy further aﬁeld, but also how each foreign policy trajectory evolved separately. The Domestic Sources of Israeli Foreign Policy The story of Israeli foreign policy since the end of the Cold War is told here from the perspective of how domestic factors shape foreign policy.3 The emphasis on the domestic arena does not imply that the external environment is less important – Israel’s regional environment is compelling and its ties with external powers, above all the USA, are crucial. Rather, the focus on the internal environment is informed by the assumption that the effects produced by the regional and broader international external environments depend on how they are ﬁltered, understood and interpreted by the domestic actors, which then shaped Israeli foreign policy towards a range of issues, in signiﬁcant ways. However, my 2 3\n\nThe literature on these bilateral relations is reviewed extensively throughout the book. Explaining foreign policy in terms of its domestic sources is a well-established approach in foreign policy analysis, which I and others have developed elsewhere. See Chris Alden and Amnon Aran, Foreign Policy Analysis: New Approaches (London: Routledge, 2016); Christopher Hill, Foreign Policy in the 21st Century (London: Palgrave, 2016).\n\nThe Domestic Sources of Israeli Foreign Policy\n\n5\n\napproach does not follow Henry Kissinger’s dictum that Israel has no foreign policy, only domestic politics. Instead, the book is based on a novel analytical framework that locates the domestic sources of Israeli foreign policy within three concentric circles, each of which represents the proximity of certain factors to, and their inﬂuence on, Israeli foreign policy. The Decision-Makers The decision-makers, above all the prime minister, comprise the most inner and inﬂuential circle. They operate in a particular decision-making structure, which is conditioned strongly by Israel’s proportional representation electoral system. Parties need to pass an electoral threshold deﬁned by the minimum number of votes needed to win a seat in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, which comprises 120 members. This electoral threshold of 3.25 per cent of the votes is low and has resulted in Israeli governments consisting of coalitions of several parties that govern according to a coalition-cabinet system.4 Political scientist, Charles Freilich, has observed that Israeli prime ministers have no institutionalized or formal sources of control over their ministers – especially those from rival parties. This severely constrains the prime minister’s political authority over his cabinet members, who are political ﬁgures in their own right, with their own political agendas. Consequently, the task of maintaining the coalition becomes allconsuming and affects the decision-making process; even the most junior coalition partners can topple the government based on a narrow parliamentary majority. As a result, Israeli cabinets are prone to leaks and political discord.5 Nevertheless, and in contrast to the conventional wisdom in relation to studies of Israeli foreign policy decision-making, Israeli prime ministers tend not to be buffeted by the political forces of the government.6 They rely on a small, private and loyal circle of trust rather than using their cabinets and the government to formulate and deliberate on sensitive foreign policy matters. It is within the narrow conﬁnes of this intimate circle of individually appointed conﬁdants that, often fateful 4 5 6\n\n‘Elections for the Knesset, Knesset Ofﬁcial Website, https://main.knesset.gov.il/en/mk/pag es/elections.aspx, accessed 15 February 2019.

This represents the relative autonomy of the prime minister to set the direction of Israeli foreign policy, an autonomy that is enhanced by the political, symbolic and institutional resources accompanying the ofﬁce. The chapters in this book trace how Israeli prime ministers bypassed and marginalized formal state institutions, especially the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), which often is led by a political rival of the prime minister. We will see how prime ministers sidestepped the MFA by deploying personal envoys, Mossad and General Security Services (GSS) personnel reporting directly to the prime minister, and even family members. Some have also assumed the position of defence minister alongside their position as prime minister, marginalizing the MFA still further. Since the government enjoys an almost automatic parliamentary majority, the Knesset cannot exercise signiﬁcant oversight over the course of Israeli foreign policy once it has been established. Moreover, the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, responsible mainly for statutory oversight to manage government foreign policy, has historically been under-resourced and, thus, weak. However, it would be a mistake to assume that Israeli prime ministers enjoy complete independence in decision-making, which is why I prefer the term ‘relative autonomy’ to describe their ability to shape Israel’s foreign policy. The government, cabinet and parliament can – and often do – resist the prime minister’s chosen foreign policy course. Yet this is far from a straightforward political task. To begin with, the prime minister has the prerogative to decide the agenda of government meetings. More signiﬁcantly, however, confronting the prime minister over his chosen foreign policy path often involves also challenging the US president. Every one of Israel’s prime ministers has sought to secure their most fateful foreign policy decisions by obtaining US backing before the issue was presented to the Israeli government. This direct and exclusive access to the US administration constitutes one of the most signiﬁcant sources of the relative autonomy of Israeli prime ministers. Any attempt to oppose the prime minister’s chosen foreign policy path, once it received US blessing, could be construed as opposing the US president. The political costs of such a confrontation, in terms of political standing within the Israeli public, would be signiﬁcant, which has helped to suppress cabinet revolts. The Security Network and its Limits If the prime minister and the decision-makers comprise the inner circle of Israeli foreign policymaking, then the second concentric circle is\n\nThe Domestic Sources of Israeli Foreign Policy\n\n7\n\nconstituted by the ‘security network’.7 Israel’s highly informal, but very potent security network includes serving and retired Israeli Defence Force (IDF) generals, members of Israel’s broader defence establishment, politicians, bureaucrats and private entrepreneurs. Their tightknit structure around the defence establishment socializes them and instils shared values, perceptions and material interests, pursued via their inﬂuential civil roles, to determine key foreign policy issues. The inﬂuence of the security network on Israeli foreign policy is compounded by institutionalized and formalized inroads into foreign policymaking made by the IDF over time. Of crucial importance is the Military Intelligence Directorate – Israel’s main military intelligence-collecting agency and analyst of regional and international strategic developments. It produces the annual National Intelligence Estimate, which is the main strategic assessment made available to Israeli foreign policymakers on issues such as war and peace and regional and global processes. The IDF’s Planning and Policy Directorate, which, since the early 1970s, has been the main unit in the military providing strategic and political assessments, represents the military’s second institutional inroad into foreign policymaking.8 At the same time, the IDF’s inﬂuence is tempered by a number of factors. The legal framework, in the form of the Military Basic Law (enacted in 1976) and later amendments to it, deﬁnes the relationship between the military and the government. The inﬂuence of the defence establishment is tempered also by its reliance, for its daily functioning, on resources generated by the civil sphere. For instance, the IDF is dependent on a constant civilian presence in its large reserve core, which, for many years, epitomized the notion of the IDF as a ‘people’s army’. Thus, the IDF is not a closed corporate entity insulated, as professional militaries are, from the civil sphere.9 Consequently, extra-parliamentary movements and the media have developed mechanisms for calling the IDF to account.10 On balance, therefore, the security network is signiﬁcant in shaping foreign policy, although not outright determining it. 7 8 9\n\n10\n\nGabriel Sheffer and Oren Barak, Israel’s Security Networks (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013).

In thinking about the link between national narratives and foreign policy, ﬁve national discourses stand out. The ﬁrst is Israel as a Jewish state. Although the speciﬁc meanings and practices of what being a Jewish state entails are disputed, there is a virtual consensus among the Jewish majority in Israel that religion must play some part in deﬁning the state and everyday life.11 The second is Israel as a Zionist state, which has different expressions. However, all strands of Zionism converge around the core idea that rather than being only a religious community the Jews are a nation, with the right to selfdetermination in the Land of Israel or parts of it. This view of Zionism is adopted by the majority of Israelis (bar some ultra-orthodox Jews and Palestinian citizens of Israel) as an integral part of their national identity.12 A third aspect of Israel’s national narratives is the notion of Israel as a ‘start-up nation’, which developed since the mid-1980s in tandem with the advances of the Israeli economy, technological pioneering and innovation. The restructuring of the economy by the aforementioned EESP created access, for the ﬁrst time in Israel’s history, to capital that was not allocated by the government. This fundamental shift enabled the rise of an Israeli business community, which forged ties with global elites, global institutions and private sectors abroad. This vibrant, assertive, and independent-of-government, globally oriented business community, plays a pivotal role in shaping Israel’s economic and diplomatic ties beyond the Middle East.13 The fourth national discourse concerns the Holocaust, which is deeply embedded in Israeli identity via a national Commemoration Day, legislation and museums, such as Yad Vashem. It emerges strongly in moments of crisis and conﬂict and has led political leaders to brand Israel’s foes – from the PLO to Iran – as Nazi incarnations, amplifying the already high perception of Israeli foreign policymakers of the threats under which they operate.14 The Holocaust is a long and threatening shadow that looms large over Israel and its foreign policy. 11 12\n\n13\n\n14\n\nSee the excellent survey of the state of religion in Israel by Guy Ben Porat, Between State and Synagogue (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013).

However, Israeli democracy has been seriously impaired by the prolonged and deepening occupation of the Gaza Strip (until 2005) and the West Bank where Palestinians are not granted Israeli citizenship, cannot vote for the Israeli Parliament and are subject to severe limitations on their personal movement and their movement of goods.15 These national narratives impose certain contours that determine what is possible and impossible and legitimate and illegitimate in the context of Israeli foreign policy. Israeli foreign policymakers use these categories to justify and legitimize certain foreign policy positions and to suppress others. Political parties – by dint of their central role in mobilizing group action, deﬁning policy options and articulating alternative future paths – also play a critical role in shaping the contours of Israel’s foreign policy. As the end of the Cold War approached, two political parties, Labour and Likud, dominated the Israeli domestic political landscape. The narrative supported by Likud was based on the saga of unceasing persecution of the Jews, the redemption and protection provided by Jewish military power and the right to settle the whole of Israel and the occupied territories. The Labour party was less clear on these issues. It articulated a narrative of Israel as sustainable without the territories, which offers a more hopeful appraisal of progress and peaceful coexistence.16 The debate over foreign policy issues between the two parties was part of a broader conﬂict over deﬁning the domestic contours of Israeli foreign policy. The Jewish Settler Movement, the most powerful grassroots movement to have been established in Israel, supported Likud and its narrative. Its ideo-theology, which hinged on the idea that the people of Israel and the Land of Israel must remain inseparable if national salvation were to be achieved, was consistent with the political programme proposed by Likud. In contrast, Labour drew its popular support from individuals and organizations afﬁliated to Kibbutzim and the 15\n\n16\n\nThere are several studies on the Israeli occupation, for example Yael Berda, Living Emergency: Israel’s Permit Regime in the Occupied West Bank (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2017); Neve Gordon, Israel’s Occupation (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008). There is a debate about the degree to which Israeli democracy is applied to its 20 per cent strong Palestinian minority. For two opposing views see Dan Shiftan, Palestinians in Israel: The Arab Minority and the Jewish States (Or Yehuda: Kineret, Zmora Bitan, 2011) (in Hebrew); Ilan Peleg and Dov Waxman, Israel’s Palestinians: The Conﬂict Within (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011).

By the end of the Cold War, Kibbutzim and the Histadroot had signiﬁcantly declined as Israel was no longer a socialist country promoting collectivist economic and social policies to nation-build, which severely weakened the grassroots support for Labour. In the successive chapters of this book, I show how the unbalanced grassroots’ support in favour of the centre-right impeded certain foreign policy options and facilitated others. A Note on Sources I should state at the outset that this is not an all-encompassing account of Israeli foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. The emphasis throughout is on Israel – on the perceptions, attitudes and thinking of its leaders, the inﬂuence of particular institutions and speciﬁc foreign policy determinants that lie beyond government and the Israeli state. The structure of the book is chronological, although I have made every effort to critically evaluate Israeli foreign policy rather than simply to provide a sequential narrative of events. In my reconstruction of Israel’s foreign policy, I have relied, wherever possible, on primary sources. It is to Israel’s credit that much of its foreign policy documents are freely available to researchers. Students of Israel’s foreign policy are well served by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs series Documents on the Foreign Policy of Israel, which is now digitized and is available in different formats on the MFA website. I used this excellent resource extensively. However, under the thirty-year rule, ofﬁcial documents from the Israeli archives pertaining to the period covered by this book are not yet available. I have tried to bridge this gap by using other types of primary sources and triangulating them. I have consulted memoirs in English, Hebrew and Arabic, authored by the leading decision-makers and practitioners, diplomatic diaries, media interviews and transcripts of Knesset debates and public lectures, government-appointed commissions of enquiry, US Congressional reports and documents released via the WikiLeaks website. I have also made extensive use of information gained from almost thirty interviews I conducted with the chief policymakers and participants in the events described here: pollsters, leading political activists, heads of Israel’s security services and foreign ministry, parliamentarians, ministers and one prime minister. As Avi Shlaim observed long ago, using interviews as evidence involves several problems, including faulty memory, self-serving accounts, distortions and deliberate falsiﬁcations.17 17\n\nShlaim, The Iron Wall, p. xvii.\n\nA Note on Sources\n\n11\n\nNevertheless, the interviews I conducted were indispensable for ﬁlling some of the blanks. Interviews cannot replace documented history, but they are an essential complementary tool. I list my interviewees in the bibliography and I am grateful to all of them for their time and generosity in responding to my questions. A ﬁnal word refers to the debate over Israeli foreign policy, which evokes strong sentiment. For some, the very word ‘Israel’ is as toxic as the term apartheid was before its ﬁnal demise. For others, ‘Israel’ is synonymous with a country that struggles to defend itself in the face of an implacably hostile region. These perceptions are unhelpful; they mask the intricacies of Israel and its foreign policy. The ﬁnal call, therefore, is for scepticism towards categorical readings of Israel’s foreign policy and the embracing of complex interpretations in their stead.\n\n1\n\nEntrenchment\n\nIntroduction In August 1989, Solidarity, the ﬁrst non-Communist party-controlled trade union in a Warsaw pact country, formed a government in Poland. The leader of Solidarity, Lech Wałesa, became president of Poland in December 1989, replacing General Wojciech Jaruzelski, Poland’s last Communist leader. These dramatic events marked the end of Communist rule in Poland, precipitating and also giving momentum to the collapse of the entire Communist bloc in Eastern Europe and the end of the Cold War. These momentous events were observed closely by Israel. By 1990, its key foreign policymakers were left in no doubt that the ‘vast political, social, and economic construct of the USSR and its satellites [had] lurched and crashed.’1 Israel’s foreign policymakers, like Robert Frost’s traveller, stood long, and looked down as far as they could. The time had come to choose between the foreign policy course less travelled or keeping to familiar ways. Foreign Policy Orientation and the Decision-Making Circle The government tasked with responding to the end of the Cold War was established by Likud leader and prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir, on 11 June 1990. Apart from Likud, the coalition government included three ultra-orthodox parties, Agudat Israel, Shas and Degel HaTora, and three ultra-nationalist parties, Tehiya, Tzomet and the NationalReligious Party, Mafdal. This ultra-religious ultra-nationalist coalition government, which, on its inception, commanded a slim majority of two members of the Knesset (MKs), had a clear foreign policy orientation.2 1 2\n\nMoshe Arens, Broken Covenant: American Foreign Policy and the Crisis between the US and Israel (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995), pp. 104–5.

In addition, the government was committed to expanding Jewish settlements established by Israel in the Golan Heights, the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem.3 The core foreign policy decision-making circle consisted of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Defence Minister Moshe Arens and their conﬁdants. These included the newly appointed minister of justice, Dan Meridor, his brother, Sallai Meridor, Arens’s chief aide, and two civil servants, Elyakim Rubinstein, and the prime minister’s military secretary, Brigadier Azriel Nevo. David Levy, the foreign minister, who Shamir deemed as ‘unﬁt to serve in the highest policy-making posts’, was bypassed in sensitive foreign policy matters.4 Another vocal rival the prime minister sidestepped was former general and defence minister, Ariel Sharon, who was appointed minister for construction and housing and was a cabinet member.5 Yitzhak Shamir and Moshe Arens brought considerable experience to the decision-making table. Shamir formed his 1990 government following three previous terms as Israel’s prime minister while Arens, prior to his re-appointment as defence minister, had served terms as Israel’s ambassador to the USA (1982–3), defence minister (1983–4), and foreign minister (1988–90). Both men were Likud veterans and political allies, and had long service in Israel’s security network. Shamir was a member of Mossad between 1956 and 1965, while Arens was appointed chief engineer in the Israeli aircraft industry in 1962.6 Prime Minister Shamir, the chief decision-maker, was born Yitzhak Yzernitsky in 1915, in the small Polish town of Rzhnoi, in a household that blended ardent Zionism with Jewish tradition or Yidishkeit. However, Shamir was a deeply secular man and held in contempt the rabbinical institution that opposed Zionism.7 In 1935, Shamir emigrated – or in Zionist parlance, ‘made Aliya’ – from Poland to British Mandated Palestine, which saved him from the fate met by the rest of his family. 3\n\n4\n\n5 6 7\n\nGovernment Policy Guidelines, 8 June, 1990, in Meron Medzini, Israel’s Foreign Relations: Selected Documents, 1988–1992 (vol. 12) (Jerusalem: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1993), pp. 345–9.

Shamir summed up his feelings thus: ‘I can’t forget and I will never forgive.’8 This searing experience coloured Shamir’s view of the world and of the Arab-Israeli conﬂict in particular. He was convinced that the Arab stance towards Zionism had ‘nothing to do with the quest for selfdetermination’, but rather was an extension of anti-Semitism and, hence, was perpetual.9 Shamir’s bleak conviction was that there was nothing Israel could offer the Arab side in exchange for recognizing its existence, and that Israel should not make peace with the Arab states until they realized that ﬁghting against Israel was futile. Only then could peace be exchanged for peace, rather than territory.10 This Hobbesian zero-sum -game approach was emblematic of the views espoused traditionally by the Israeli right, which formed the political and ideological core of the Shamir government. Prime Minister Shamir and his defence minister personiﬁed another core ideological and political tenet of the Israeli right. Throughout his career in Likud, Shamir was renowned for his staunch support for retaining the territories Israel occupied during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Shamir’s position was grounded in the belief that Jews had a more just claim to the Land of Israel than the Arabs’ claim to that land.11 Somewhat differently, Arens supported Israel’s retention of the territories it occupied in the 1967 war, on the grounds of the strategic depth they provided to Israel rather than on purely nationalistic grounds. Through this prism, Arens saw the Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Egypt in the 1967 war, as a demographic liability. It was heavily populated by 642,000 Palestinians while the Jewish presence amounted to only a few thousand settlers, who physically controlled just 25 per cent of the Strip, but 40 per cent of its arable land.12 The zero-sum-game view of the Arab-Israeli conﬂict and the opposition to a land-for-peace exchange, hinged on the assumption that time was on Israel’s side. Shamir personiﬁed the view that prevailed among the Israeli right that, as the years went by, Israel could compel its Arab foes to accept its existence by building an impregnable iron wall of military strength.13 However, until then, Israel must survive by the sword. 8 10 11 12 13\n\n9 Shamir, Summing Up, pp. 9–16.

Accordingly, Shamir’s foreign policy approach to the USA hinged on manoeuvring between safeguarding what the Israeli leadership deﬁned as its ‘red lines’ and the demands imposed on Israel by the USA.20 A Threat from Iraq Israel’s initial reaction to the end of the Cold War was made crystal clear in a meeting of top US and Israeli ofﬁcials, held on 20 July 1990. In attendance on the American side were Defence Secretary Dick Cheney, Undersecretary for Defence Paul Wolfowitz and Defence Intelligence Agency Head Lieutenant General Harry Soster. Israel was represented by the IDF head of intelligence, Major General Amnon Shahak, the head of Mossad, Shabtai Shavit and Defence Minister Arens, who laid out Israel’s position: ‘Whereas in Eastern Europe there is glasnost and the 14 15 17 18 19 20\n\nMisgav, Conversations, p. 66; Arens Broken Covenant, pp. 35–6.

The Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries were disarming while the arms race in the Middle East was intensifying.’21 The message coming out of Israel via its defence minister, regarding the signiﬁcance of the end of Cold War for the Middle East, was that nothing much had changed. From the Israeli vantage point, the signiﬁcance of the end of the Cold War lay elsewhere, most crucially, in the ‘opening up of the gates’ to a massive Jewish Aliya from the Soviet Union to Israel. In addition, the ending of the conﬂict between the two super powers was seen in Jerusalem as creating the conditions that might prompt Eastern European countries and the USSR to renew the diplomatic relations with Israel that had been severed in 1967.22 By February 1990, former Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland had restored diplomatic relations with Israel.23 Through this lens, the end of the Cold War was perceived not as requiring a foreign policy rethink but rather conﬁrmed that the foreign policy course Israel had pursued during the Cold War was sound. Israel now should take advantage of the new opportunities to consolidate in order to confront the challenges that lay ahead.24 One of those challenges was the threat posed by Iraq, whose president, Saddam Hussein, issued a clear warning to Israel. In a speech he delivered on 2 April 1990, Hussein threatened that, were Israel to attempt to launch another strike similar to the one in 1981 that had destroyed the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor, Iraq would retaliate with binary chemical weapons: ‘By God, we will make the ﬁre eat up half of Israel if it tries to do anything against Iraq.’25 It is unclear whether there was an Israeli plan afoot to attack Iraq. However, it is apparent that the Israelis viewed Iraq’s concern over a potential Israeli strike as a threat in and of itself.26 The Israeli view was shaped in part by the prime minister’s and defence minister’s perception of Saddam Hussein as a new Hitler after the Iraqi president authorized use of chemical weapons in 1984 against Iranian troops and in 1988 against Iraqi-Kurdish civilians in the village of Halabja.27 Understandably, in early 1990, following completion of the construction of six Scud missile launchers in western Iraq, Israel saw itself 21 22\n\n23 25 27\n\nArens, Broken Covenant, p. 149.

In these circumstances, Israeli intelligence rendered the threat posed by Saddam Hussein’s 2 April speech, ‘an immediate danger’.29 From this point, events moved quickly. On 2 August 1990, Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait, which was occupied and claimed by Saddam Hussein as the nineteenth province of Iraq. The invasion was followed by a long period of waiting, during which a US-led coalition of western states, the USSR and Arab states was built to evict the Iraqi forces from occupied Kuwait. The countdown to the military showdown began on 29 November 1990, after the passing of Resolution 678 by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), authorizing the use of ‘all necessary means’ against Iraq unless it withdrew its forces from Kuwait by 15 January 1991.30 It was clear to Prime Minister Shamir that, if the US-led coalition attacked militarily, then Iraq would seek to drive a wedge between the Arab states and the rest of the US-led coalition by drawing Israel into the conﬂict.31 Israel was particularly concerned about an Iraqi attack from Jordan, which shared the longest international border with Israel. These concerns were well founded. In early 1990, Iraq and Jordan had forged a military alliance and established a joint air squadron, enabling Iraq to reconnoitre the Israeli side of the Jordan valley from Jordanian airspace. King Hussein of Jordan, a close friend of the Iraqi president, believed wholeheartedly that Saddam Hussein could provide the leadership needed to restore pride and dignity to the Arab world. His assessment of the Iraqi president, which he repeated in private conversations, including with his Israeli Mossad contact, Efraim Halevy, was echoed by the wide pro-Iraqi sentiment within Jordan itself.32 Speaking in the Knesset on 7 August, 1990, Arens issued the stern warning that were Israel to see any ‘entry of the Iraqi army into Jordan, we shall act’.33 The warning was acknowledged by King Hussein, who, a few\n\n28 29 30 31 32 33\n\nJames A.

During that period, the PLO had tried to topple King Hussein, who had fended off the attempt with the aid of Israel and Jordan’s Western backers, Britain and the USA.35 Subsequently, Israel and Jordan had established an infrastructure for secret collaboration, which was also used following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. On 4–5 January, 1991, Israeli and Jordanian top brass met in King Hussein’s home in Ascot, England. The Jordanian side was represented by King Hussein and his military advisor, General Zeid bin Shaker.36 Representing Israel were Prime Minister Shamir, Mossad’s Efraim Halevy, IDF Deputy Chief of Staff Ehud Barak, Cabinet Secretary Elyakim Rubinstein and Director General of the Prime Minister’s Ofﬁce, Yossi Ben Aharon. The main objective of the meeting was to avoid an unintended clash between the IDF and the Jordanian army. To this effect, King Hussein pledged to the Israelis that his armed forces would be mobilized solely for defensive purposes and that he would not allow Iraqi forces to use Jordanian sovereign space. However, he emphasized that he could not control ‘the outer space’, which would be penetrated if Iraq launched a missile attack against Israel.37 Equally, King Hussein refused to grant the Israeli request to use Jordanian airspace in the event of an Iraqi attack on Israel.38 The meeting assuaged the tensions in Jerusalem regarding the threat posed to Israel from its immediate eastern ﬂank. However, not all were persuaded. Minister of housing and cabinet member, Ariel Sharon, for instance, opposed the diplomatic signals the government sent to Jordan. He advocated using military force in the event of an Iraqi attack, irrespective of the Jordanian position.39 The long waiting period also required liaison with the USA. On 8 August 1990, US ambassador to Israel, Bill Brown, met Defence Minister Arens. The ambassador relayed the US request that Israel exercise the utmost restraint during the crisis and take no pre-emptive action against Iraq. The Israeli leadership construed the request as a US decision to sideline Israel in order to secure Arab cooperation with the US-led international effort against Iraq and, possibly, beyond. It was in sharp 34 35 36 38 39\n\nIbid. Moshe Zak, King Hussein Makes Peace (Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 1996) (in Hebrew). Shlaim, The Iron Wall, p. 478. 37 Interview 1 Dan Meridor.

Now, as the ﬁrst major post-Cold War international crisis was unfolding, Israel was, at best, immaterial to realization of US interests in the Middle East and, at worst, a liability.40 Tellingly, as Israel’s ambassador to the US, Zalman Shuval, recalls, Israel was not among the countries the USA had briefed about how to prepare for a possible war against Iraq.41 In fact, the waiting period was fraught with US-Israeli tensions. The USA stalled over Israeli requests for cooperation. Instead, it provided assurances that the US air force would neutralize any threat to Israel, especially in western Iraq. The USA also offered to deploy US-manned Patriot anti-ballistic weapons systems in Israel, an offer that Israel declined.42 In summing up the view from Jerusalem regarding cooperation with the USA, Minister of Defence Arens noted that he was ‘frustrated by the distrust that coloured’ the US attitude towards Israel.43 Political strains compounded the tensions generated by the disagreements over the extent of US-Israeli military cooperation. In 1990, the popular uprising by the Palestinians against Israeli occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, dubbed the Intifada, entered its third year. Saddam Hussein sought to exploit the prolonged conﬂict by suggesting, early in the crisis, on 12 August, that Iraq might withdraw from Kuwait if Israel withdrew from all the occupied territories and Syria withdrew from Lebanon. Clearly, Saddam Hussein was trying to transform the conﬂict that had begun as a dispute between Iraq and a widebased international coalition into an Arab-Israeli clash. This would put political pressure on the Arab states to leave the US-led coalition or be perceived as cooperating with Israel in a war against another Arab country.44 Linking the Israeli-Palestinian conﬂict and the Kuwait crisis was a cunning move. It created a source of concern throughout the waiting period since there was virtually no prospect of a change of the Shamir government policy towards the Palestinian Intifada. In fact, senior cabinet colleagues, such as Ariel Sharon and former chief of staff, Raphael Eitan, chided Prime Minister Shamir and Defence Minister Arens for being ‘too soft’ on the Palestinian insurgency.45 40 41 42 43 44 45\n\nShamir, Summing Up, pp. 265–8; Arens, Broken Covenant, p. 151.

The Israeli government had signiﬁcantly stepped up preparations on the home front and had begun distributing gasmasks to the entire population. Concurrently, cooperation with the USA was tightened. A secure telephone line, codenamed ‘Hammer Rick’, was installed to enable direct communication between Defence Minister Arens and his US counterpart, Dick Cheney. A system was put in place to allow US satellites to provide early warning of Iraqi missiles launched against Israel, directly to the Israeli ministry of defence, via Hammer Rick. Nevertheless, the cooperation fell short of what Israel wanted. The USA continued to reject Israeli requests for real-time intelligence and a framework for military cooperation. It was concerned that the information might be exploited by Israel for a pre-emptive attack against Iraq, which could break up the US-led international coalition.46 The 1991 Gulf War On 17 January 1991, two days after expiry of the international ultimatum issued to Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait, the US-led coalition launched an attack on the Iraqi forces. The 1991 Gulf War, which came to be known as Operation Desert Storm, lasted for six weeks, from 17 January to 28 February. It consisted of a long period of airstrikes by the US-led coalition, coupled with a ground invasion on 24–28 February.47 The war reﬂected the fast moving geopolitical changes following the end of the Cold War. The USA and USSR cooperating with Arab countries, including Syria, which until recently had been a Soviet client, to ﬁght a fellow Arab country, Iraq. Israel, ofﬁcially at least, was not part of the conﬂict. However, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein conﬁrmed the earlier intelligence prediction that he would try and draw Israel into the war. Throughout Operation Desert Storm, Israel was subjected to salvos of ground-to-ground missiles from Iraq. Some thirty-eight Iraqi versions of Scud missiles fell in nineteen missile attacks, targeting Israel’s most densely populated areas. Shortly after the attacks began, Defence Minister Arens reversed the earlier Israeli decision and requested US Secretary of Defence Dick Cheney, that US-manned Patriot missile batteries be deployed in Israel. However, as the USA eventually 46 47\n\nArens, Broken Covenant, pp. 169–71; Cheney, In My Time, p. 211; Shamir, Summing Up, p. 266.

A report by the Israeli Air Force (IAF), which was presented to the Americans by Defence Minister Arens, concluded that Patriots succeeded in eliminating Scud missiles in only 20 per cent of attempts.48 Nonetheless, the total damage caused by the attacks was limited: one direct fatality, 208 injured and 7,667 properties hit.49 Even so, the Scud attacks had a demoralizing effect; they caused signiﬁcant disruption to everyday life as residents of Haifa and the greater Tel-Aviv area sought refuge in areas that were not targeted by the Iraqi missiles. Also, the fear that Iraq would launch a chemical attack against Israel remained acute throughout the war.50 Israeli foreign policymakers ﬁercely debated Israel’s response in regular meetings between cabinet ministers and senior IDF members during the war. Israel needed to strike a balance between stopping (or at least limiting) the Scud attacks, the real risk of an Iraqi chemical strike against Israel, and the impact of Israeli foreign policy actions on the US-led international coalition. Two factions emerged. There was a group of hardliners within the cabinet – Likud’s Ariel Sharon, Tzomet’s leader and former general chief of staff, Rafael Eitan, and Professor Yuval Ne’eman from Tehiya – who demanded a military response with or without US approval: ‘Send the aircraft to photograph!’, demanded Sharon of Defence Minister Arens in the cabinet meeting following the ﬁrst Scud attack. ‘Even without coordinating with the US’, queried Arens? ‘Notify them and ﬂy!’, thundered Sharon.51 As the Scud attacks continued, these hardliners, more explicitly and more publicly, demanded that Israel put a stop to them and punish Iraq.52 Prime Minister Shamir, Defence Minister Arens, their conﬁdants and Foreign Minister Levy, took a different line centred on the notion that Israel must have US permission and a joint military framework for such an attack. Failing this, Israel must continue to comply with the US demand for forbearance in order to thwart the Iraqi attempt to drive a wedge\n\n48 49\n\n50\n\n51 52\n\nShuval, Diplomat, p. 207.

The US president’s special envoy to Israel during the conﬂict, Lawrence Eagleburger, emphasized the resolute US objection to an Israeli military strike on Iraq. The USA, he stressed, ‘would do nothing to enable an Israeli attack’.56 Matching words to deeds, throughout the war, the intelligence provided by the USA to Israel was out of date, and the USA refused to create a joint military framework.57 Domestic factors also mattered. The IDF’s top brass does not seem to have been eager for Israel to ‘go it alone’ against Iraq.58 This was very evident in the diplomatic mission to the USA by Major General Ehud Barak, the deputy chief of staff, and the director general of the ministry of defence, David Ivri, on 27–29 January, 1991, in the midst of the conﬂict. Their brief from Defence Minister Arens was to relay Israel’s determination to take military action, even if the Americans withheld the coordination needed for such an operation. After their debrieﬁng on their return to Israel, Arens felt that the generals ‘had not made that point with sufﬁcient emphasis’.59 The IDF’s preparations for attacking the Scud launchers in western Iraq continued notwithstanding, but the view of the military was that ‘the potential gains of such a mission were balanced by the attendant risk’.60 Furthermore, the Israeli politico-military top brass itself was sceptical about whether an attack by the IDF would yield a better military result than the combined US and UK airstrikes that were pounding western Iraq daily.61 However, the most signiﬁcant restraint on Israel’s response to the Iraqi attacks was the posture of forbearance championed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Although in the midst of the war, Arens veered increasingly towards the view that Israel should react militarily to the Iraqi attacks, Shamir remained resolute. Throughout the war, he put all his political weight in the cabinet on preserving Israel’s restraint, a decision 53 54 55 56 57 59 61\n\nArens, Broken Covenant, p. 191; Shamir, Summing Up, p. 270.

Shamir was intensely aware of the risk of the US-led international coalition splintering were Israel to retaliate, and that this would signiﬁcantly undermine the already strained US-Israeli relations and spare Iraq. Shamir reasoned that the price exacted from Israel would be higher than any gains that could be achieved by a targeted Israeli attack on Iraq’s Scud launchers. A majority in the cabinet sided with the Prime Minister, as did the majority of the Israeli public according to opinion polls conducted during the war, and this kept the hardliners in the cabinet in the minority.63 A mixed picture emerged as the dust of Desert Storm began to settle. The 1991 Gulf War was the ﬁrst time that the Israeli heartland had been hit. Israel’s untypical forbearance response had created a sense of humiliation and concern that Israeli deterrence had been dented, and had highlighted Israel’s vulnerability to a ballistic attack. The result was more investment in anti-missile technology, such as the Arrow missile, which was designed to intercept tactical-ballistic missiles.64 At the same time, Iraq had been defeated, its army dealt a mighty blow and the country subjected to harsh sanctions and Saddam Hussein’s international standing had been weakened signiﬁcantly. Within six weeks, Iraq had been transformed from a formidable threat to Israel to that of a contained risk. The demise of the USSR, the patron of Israel’s Arab foes during the Cold War, meant that no Arab state – including either Syria or Libya – was capable of taking on Iraq’s aim to lead the Arab world in an assault against Israel. Preparing Arab-Israeli Negotiations Following the end of the Gulf War, policy makers in the USA estimated that its credibility was at its highest since the end of World War II, and at the zenith of its inﬂuence in the Middle East. A jubilant USA set out to establish a ‘new world order’ that would include Arab-Israeli peace.65 Having emerged as the sole world super power and leader of the coalition that had defeated Iraq, the USA was well placed to act as the sole mediator in the Arab-Israeli conﬂict. Negotiations would be based on UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR) 242 and 338, which stipulated that Israel withdraw from 62 63 64 65\n\nInterview 1 Dan Meridor; Interview Sallai Meridor; Shamir, Summing Up¸ p. 263.

Rather, it saw its role as a catalyst for peace through the breaking of the taboo on direct talks between Israel and the Arab governments. Hitherto, bar Egypt, Arab governments had refused to engage directly with Israel.67 US Secretary of State James Baker, who led the US mediation team, used sticks and carrots to draw Israel and the Arabs into direct negotiations. He sought to get the parties to the negotiations invested in the process ‘so it’s not so easy to walk away from it’. ‘We want them to build their stake in its success’, Baker wrote, ‘and increase the cost to them of failure’.68 In this vein, Secretary of State Baker threatened to ‘lay the dead cat at the doorstep’ of any party he deemed responsible for failing his diplomatic mission.69 Equipped with this mediation ‘toolkit’ Baker embarked on a shuttle-diplomacy mission where he would try and take ideas that Israel could ‘live with’ and ‘sell’ them, to the Arab negotiators.70 The launch of Baker’s shuttle diplomacy mission, during a two-day visit to Israel, on 9–10 April 1991, was sensitive; previous US mediation efforts in 1988–9 had ended in failure, which Baker attributed to Prime Minister Shamir’s intransigence and reluctance to respect his previous commitments.71 ‘Battered, beaten, and betrayed’, was how Baker and President Bush felt during that acrimonious round of negotiations.72 The Israelis felt equally let down, particularly by Baker’s demand to ‘lay aside once and for all the unrealistic vision of a Greater Israel’.73 How, wondered Shamir, could the adjective ‘Greater’ be applied to a tiny country like Israel?74 Further, on 1 March 1990, the USA conditioned $US400 million of loan guarantees for housing for Soviet Jewish immigrants, on Israel’s agreement to halt the construction of new settlements in the occupied territories.75 Aghast, Prime Minister Shamir charged the USA with pressurising Israel to make political concessions to the Arab side by curtailing its capacity to deal with the ‘humanitarian issue’ – housing for new immigrants.76 66 67\n\n70 73 75 76\n\nIbid, pp. 415-17.

The Israelis consented to the USA and the USSR co-hosting the meeting, but objected to active roles of the EEC and the United Nations (UN), both of which Israel perceived as biased towards the Arab side. During the following eight months, Secretary of State Baker made eight visits to the Middle East, which focused on negotiating the conditions for opening an Arab-Israeli dialogue. Israel’s position was shaped by two sets of determinants that pushed and tugged in different directions. On the one hand, there was a set of domestic factors that included the decision-makers’ ideological commitment to the integrity of the Land of Israel, the political requirement to keep intact the right-wing Shamir government, and lobbying from the settlers. Members of Likud, especially and, most vocally, Ariel Sharon, were subjecting the prime minister and his allies to intense political criticism and accusing the prime minister of making too many concessions to US demands. The ultra-right wing parties, Tzomet, Tehiya and Moledet – a party that Shamir had brought into the government during the Gulf War and which advocated physical transfer of Palestinians from Israel – added to the prime minister’s coalition woes. This troika, which threatened to topple the government, accused the prime minister of selling out the Land of Israel. At the same time, the USA was insisting that Israel ﬁnd some common ground with the Arab positions, which, by deﬁnition, were far removed from the Israeli right agenda.79 Balancing this two-level game, Israel conceded to US demands concerning procedural matters. It retracted its initial objections to calling the meeting a ‘conference’ and where such a ‘conference’ might be held. The Israelis settled ultimately for Madrid after initially insisting it should take place in the Middle East. They also agreed to EEC participation in the meeting, with UN presence as an observer.80 These concessions on procedural matters were a shrewd tactic to increase Israel’s ability to 77\n\n78 79 80\n\nThe content of this meeting is derived from: Baker, The Politics of Diplomacy, pp. 444–7; Interview 1 Dan Meridor; Arens, Broken Covenant, pp. 224–6; Ross, The Missing Peace, pp. 70–71.

For example, it was clear to the Israelis that the USA, the USSR and the Europeans wanted to see a return to the 1967 borders and this was what the Arabs would demand.81 Thus, the opening positions of most of the prospective participants in the conference were in stark contrast to the stance of the Israeli government, which was staunchly opposed to the land-for-peace formula. Israel was, a priori, in a vulnerable minority position, which was why it objected to negotiating within the format of an international conference.82 Israel also resisted any negotiating format that would afford the Palestinians statehood status, not least through independent Palestinian delegation participation in the conference.83 In this context, Israel rejected the PLO as a negotiating partner, in spite of its recognition by the Arab League since 1974 as the ‘sole, legitimate, representative of the Palestinian people’. Israel still regarded the PLO as a terrorist organization, which had publicly supported Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait and the recent Iraqi attacks on Israel. On this point, there was cross-party consensus within both the government and the Israeli parliament. Also, Prime Minister Shamir was convinced that negotiating with the PLO would lead inevitably to negotiation over establishing a Palestinian state on part of the Land of Israel. Herein ‘lay the seeds for the destruction of Israel’, argued Shamir, personifying the revisionist Zionist claim that the indivisibility between the people of Israel and the Land of Israel was at the heart of Israeli spiritual and material fortitude.84 Moreover, Shamir was convinced that the territorial strategic depth afforded by controlling the ‘Land of Israel’ was a sine qua non for Israeli security.85 It was the only way that Israel could limit its enemies’ ability to use the territory as a launch pad for attacks against Israelis.86 As Baker conceded, Israel ultimately got its way. The Palestinians participated in the Madrid peace conference as part of a joint JordanianPalestinian delegation, and their representatives were vetted by Israel. Palestinian representatives who were residents of Jerusalem were banned from participation lest it be construed as Israel acknowledging Palestinian claims to the city that Israel insisted was its eternal indivisible capital. The PLO also was banned from attendance and conﬁned to its headquarters\n\n81 83 84 85 86\n\n.aspx, accessed 5 November 2018; Shamir, Summing Up, pp. 274–8; Arens, Broken Covenant, p. 227.

The outcome strongly reﬂected the weak position of the PLO and Jordan, which, publicly supported Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War. This strategically ﬂawed decision was at the cost of Jordan and the PLO losing both support of the Arab Gulf States and the USA. Israel stood ﬁrm on another issue, namely, expanding its settlements. The uncompromising Israeli stance was determined by an absolute belief in the integrity of the Land of Israel and the political requirement to keep the ultra-right Shamir government intact. The implications of settlement expansion to deepen the occupation of a growing non-citizen Palestinian population played no role in informing the Israeli stance on this issue. Among the points on which Israel did not budge, settlement was the most charged. The occupied Palestinians considered that the land expropriated by Israel and used for settlement expansion, belonged to them. For the Arab governments, the issue of settlements was a yardstick to gauge US even-handedness with respect to the peace process. Amid these high stakes, the USA rendered the settlements and their chief patron, Ariel Sharon, ‘an obstacle to peace’ in the Middle East.87 The Loan Guarantees Feud US-Israeli differences over the settlement issue came to a head in September 1991.88 On 6 September, Israel submitted a request to the US Congress for $US10 billion in loan guarantees, for ﬁnance it intended to raise in loans from the international markets to fund the absorption of Soviet immigrants. In the period 1989 to 1991 alone, approximately 345,000 immigrants had arrived in Israel from the Soviet Union.89 The request for loan guarantees was tendered at a very sensitive moment; it coincided with the ﬁnal stages in the resolution of issues related to convening the Madrid peace conference. Were the USA to accept the Israeli request without a clear commitment to a settlement freeze, the Arab side would perceive the USA as economically endorsing Likud’s commitment to the integrity of the Land of Israel. At the same time, a public US-Israeli dispute over the settlement question risked Shamir refusing to participate in the Madrid conference and calls for new elections in Israel, which would derail the budding peace process. 87 88 89\n\nBaker, The Politics of Diplomacy, pp. 542, 545, 547.

Instead, it suggested, cunningly, that Congress ‘defer’ discussion of the request for loan guarantees for 120 days, that is, until after the direct Arab-Israeli negotiations had begun and the process was well underway. However, the Israelis refused to link the loan guarantees and the peace process and rejected this formula, setting the Shamir government and the Bush administration on a collision course. The Israeli government, via the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the most powerful pro-Israeli advocacy group, lobbied Congress to vote in favour of Israel’s request for loan guarantees. The Bush Administration, whose inﬂuence was still high following the Gulf War, counter-campaigned. President Bush weighed in by publicly criticizing what he deﬁned as ‘powerful political forces amounting to thousands of lobbyists’ ﬁghting ‘one lonely guy’.90 In a televised address, he stated that US citizens and representatives must choose between supporting the administration’s efforts towards peace or not.91 Ultimately, the administration triumphed after Congress and Senate approved deferral of discussion of the Israeli request for 120 days. Prime Minister Shamir was decisive in Israel’s participation in the Madrid conference, the American decision notwithstanding. In contrast to the conventional wisdom that he was an uncompromising arch ideologist, Shamir’s response, in this instance, reﬂected his foreign policy manoeuvring among Israeli ‘red lines’, and avoiding a direct clash with US interests. As he told Baker: ‘[T]his is an American decision, we’d like it to be otherwise, but we’ll live with this decision.’92 The Madrid Peace Conference Resolution of the loan guarantee feud paved the way for the Madrid peace conference. The delegations were positioned to form three sides of a rectangle table, facing the conference presidency, comprising the USA and the USSR, the co-hosts. The conference, which included representatives of Israel, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians, was scheduled for 30 October to 2 November 1991. Then US President George H. Bush and his Soviet counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, represented the co-host countries. The Arab states were represented by their 90 91\n\n92\n\nBaker, The Politics of Diplomacy, p. 552.

The conference had no authority to impose solutions on the parties or to veto any agreements that might be reached; it had no authority to make decisions for the parties and no power to vote on results; the conference could be reconvened only with the consent of all the parties.93 In hindsight, the Madrid peace conference seems primarily a ceremonial event. Although, after forty-three years of bloody conﬂict, the taboo against Arabs talking directly to Israelis was broken in Madrid, the ensuing discussions were a ‘dialogue of the deaf’. The Arab participants and Israel used the occasion polemically to reiterate their previous positions of entrenchment towards each other rather than to advance peace negotiations.94 Syria’s foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara focused on criticizing Israeli foreign policy, branding it as ‘settler-colonialist’ and ‘inhumane’. Shamir, in his turn, delivered a hardline speech, which focused on Arab rejection of Israel and questioned the Arab’s basic desire for peace. Only one speech, delivered by the head of the Palestinian contingent of the joint Palestinian-Jordanian delegation, Dr Haidar Abdel-Shaﬁ, was forward looking and showed empathy for the other side.95 The Israeli delegation left the conference on Friday 1 November – one day before its ofﬁcial conclusion – on the pretext that it could not observe the Jewish Sabbath outside the borders of Israel. This was perplexing even to some Israeli diplomats since Israeli government representatives routinely observed the Sabbath outside Israel. One prominent Israeli diplomat questioned whether his country was signalling that the Madrid peace conference was a trivial affair and not an event that could constitute a cornerstone of a peace process.96 93\n\n94\n\n95\n\n96\n\nIsrael Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘Madrid Letter of Invitation’, http://mfa.gov.il/ MFA/ForeignPolicy/Peace/Guide/Pages/Madrid%20Letter%20of%20Invitation.as px, accessed 17 July 2014.

Under Likud, Israel entered the process assuming that it had complied fully with the stipulation in UNSCR 242 – to exchange land for peace – well before the Madrid conference, in 1979 in fact, by returning to Egypt the Sinai Peninsula which comprised 90 per cent of the territories Israel occupied in 1967. Thus, in Madrid, Israel was prepared to accept peace in exchange for peace but not territory. In relation to the Palestinians in the occupied territories, Israel was willing to grant them religious and cultural autonomy and responsibility for administrating various spheres: justice, ﬁnance, budgeting, taxation and a local police. However, they would remain under Israeli ‘sovereignty’, a euphemism for deepening occupation.97 This Israeli foreign policy posture represented a yawning divide with Arab demands, which centred on return of the land lost in 1967, an end to the Israeli occupation and establishment of a Palestinian state. Israel’s foreign policy position remained unchanged during the bilateral negotiations, which opened in December 1991 in Washington, following the Madrid peace conference. The talks continued in January in Moscow and later transferred to other European capitals. Israel’s position consisted of hard negotiating over procedural matters and no substantial concessions.
