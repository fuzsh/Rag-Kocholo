        "text": "Issue in Depth: The Mideast Peace Process\n\nBy DOUGLAS JEHL\n\nAMASCUS, Syria -- In his only previous encounter with an Israeli prime minister, back in 1991, Farouk al-Shara waved an old British poster that identified the Israeli, Yitzhak Shamir, as wanted for crimes of terrorism. The one time that Shara addressed the Israeli public directly, in 1995, he spoke in an angry tirade.\n\nBut now Shara, who is 61 and has been Syria's foreign minister for 15 years, is seen as embodying his country's hopes for a swift peace. On Wednesday in Washington, he will become the highest-ranking Syrian ever to meet with an Israeli leader, and as the two sides resume talks for the first time in nearly four years, Shara is expected to present a gentler face than in the past.\n\nShara, who left Syria Monday for the talks with Israel's current prime minister, Ehud Barak, has said he is heading for Washington \"serious about making peace.\"\n\nThe new language appears to reflect changes that seem to have persuaded Syria's President, Hafez al-Assad, that a settlement with Israel is less a threat than an opportunity. Apart from Assad, Shara is seen here as the man who speaks with more authority than anyone else, and the fact that he will represent Syria in the talks is regarded as a sign of determination to put the long Syrian-Israeli conflict to rest.\n\n\"When it comes to peace, there are only two people who really matter today -- Assad himself and Shara,\" said a prominent Syrian who would speak only on condition of anonymity.\n\nA calm, elegant and engaging man who speaks English well, Shara was appointed foreign minister in 1984 in large part, diplomats here say, because his manner was seen as likely to win support in the West. His predecessor, Abdulhalim Khaddam, now a vice president, was known for a hectoring style.\n\nShara is generally regarded as among the most able of Arab foreign ministers. But he has always been a loyalist and has never allowed his own personality to eclipse that of Assad. Until now, his only encounters with Israelis have been hostile, reflecting the deep tensions between the countries.\n\nIn the 1991 episode, Shara headed Syria's delegation to the Middle East peace conference in Madrid, the American-sponsored gathering that set current peace efforts in motion. His display of the old British poster came after Shamir had denounced Syria as a terrorist state.\n\nMany Syrians still describe the confrontation with great pride, but American officials who had worked overtime to persuade Syria to attend the gathering regarded it at the time as a major setback.\n\nIt was a reminder, they said, that when it came to the quest for a Syrian-Israeli peace, the two sides carried so much old bitterness that they were in effect starting from scratch.\n\nShara's only direct comments to the Israeli public came four years later, when peace talks were already under way but mutual distrust had allowed only scant progress. At the urging of American officials, who argued that Syria should make its case directly to ordinary Israelis, Shara granted an interview to Israeli television, becoming the highest-ranking Syrian ever to do so.\n\nBut his sharp criticism of Israel and its policies was widely seen as counterproductive to the peace efforts. As recently as 1998, Shara spoke with bitterness again. Angry at the fact that the peace talks that broke down in 1996 had not been reconvened, Shara criticized the \"ineffective role\" played by the Clinton administration, which at the time seemed to be giving low priority to Israeli-Syrian peace efforts.\n\n\"The United States bears a considerable part of the responsibility of allowing this process to reach a dead end,\" Shara said at the time.\n\nShara, who is a Sunni Muslim, was born in 1938 in the southern city of Dara. He earned a bachelor's degree in English literature from the University of Damascus in 1963, and later studied international law at the University of London.\n\nBefore being named ambassador to Italy in 1976, he spent 13 years as a manager and official of Syrian Arab Airlines. He was appointed minister of state for foreign affairs in 1980, and became foreign minister four years later. He suffered an aneurysm this fall, and was taken to Beirut, Lebanon, where he underwent heart surgery. But he appears to have made a swift recovery.\n\nAnd his demeanor has turned particularly upbeat in recent days, with the decision by the two sides to resume talks in an atmosphere so optimistic that both Israel and Syria have said a deal could be reached in a short time.\n\nShara was initially seen in the West as more a spokesman than a decision maker. As recently as the early 1990's, foreign visitors who met in small groups with Assad noted that Shara tended for the most part to listen in silence or to take notes for his boss.\n\nBut in recent years, according to well-connected Syrians and Damascus-based diplomats, Shara's stature has swelled. He is one of the few Syrian officials with whom the reclusive Assad, 69, is believed to meet regularly, instead of merely consulting by phone. And although Shara still defers to the president, he now often completes his boss's thoughts, and has become a vocal participant in the discussions with foreign representatives.\n\nThe first round of talks is expected to be held in Blair House, the presidential guest quarters across the street from the White House, and will almost certainly be behind closed doors. In announcing last week that the two sides would resume direct negotiations, President Clinton suggested that further discussions would probably shift to an undisclosed location in the Middle East after Shara and Barak returned to their capitals.\n\nBut Syrian officials have insisted that the talks continue in the Washington area, where they hope that the administration officials might prove more likely to put pressure on Israel for compromises.\n\nWestern diplomats in Syria say they understand that the State Department is now seeking a suitable location for further talks somewhere in the Virginia countryside."
