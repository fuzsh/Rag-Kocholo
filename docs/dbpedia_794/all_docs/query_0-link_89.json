        "text": "This book studies Syrian-American relations from Syrian independence in 1946 to the death of Hafez Asad in 2000. It draws upon archival sources to understand the driving factors of mistrust between Damascus and Washington. Author J.K. Gani charts the antagonistic relationship of the two states through the lenses of the Cold War, the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the 1991 Gulf War. She also considers why rare instances of cooperation did not produce a longer-lasting rapprochement. The historical legacy of colonialism in the region and enmity with Israel loom large over Syria's foreign policy throughout the period studied in this book, manifested via a strong Arab nationalist ideology. A recognition of the influence of ideology on Syria's foreign relations as well as its suspicion of the United States provides a deeper understanding of Syria's pivotal role in the region and of the on-going conflict within Syria today - a historical backdrop that is critical for scholars, observers, and practitioners of Middle East politics. http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/the-role-of-ideology-in-syrianus-relations-j-k-gani/?isb=9781137358349"
