        "text": "The news that Israel is sitting down to peace talks with Syria galvanized opposition and government forces alike today, with the right-wing leader Ariel Sharon mobilizing resistance to the expected surrender of the Golan Heights and center-left parties rallying behind Ehud Barak, their suddenly ebullient prime minister.\n\n''This is a government that was born to make history,'' said Yossi Sarid, the head of the leftist Meretz Party, which had lately been devoting much of its energy to carping at Mr. Barak's economic policies.\n\nEven the long-stagnant Tel Aviv stock market seemed giddy, jumping four percent on the news.\n\nAside from the Israeli prime minister and foreign minister, virtually all political leaders here were caught off guard by President Clinton's announcement Wednesday that Mr. Barak and the Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, would begin talks in Washington next week.\n\nToday they scrambled to embrace or denounce the decision, as commentators noted how the prospect of peace with Syria had instantly transformed the political climate here.\n\nIn a meeting in Tel Aviv today with members of his own Labor Party, who in a gathering just a week ago had shouted bitter complaints about his budget plans, Mr. Barak was greeted with sustained cheers.\n\n''Four years ago as foreign minister, I saw and sat one person away from Farouk al-Shara at lunch given by the king of Spain, but we couldn't speak with him,'' Mr, Barak told his party colleagues. ''It was impossible to conduct a dialogue, and today we are able to conduct a dialogue.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
