        "text": "Damascus: In a major Cabinet reshuffle, the Syrian president on Saturday named longtime Foreign Minister Farouk Al Shara'a as Vice-President, replacing him as the country's top diplomat with Walid Al Moallem, a former ambassador to the United Nations, the official SANA agency reported.\n\nAccording to a presidential decree broadcast by Syrian Television, Brigadier General Bassam Abdul Majid was named Interior Minister to fill the position left vacant by the October suicide of Interior Minister Gazi Kanaan.\n\nAlso, Mohsen Bilal was named to replace Mahdi Dakhlallah as Information Minister. Al Shara'a was also put in charge of implementing Syrian \"foreign and information policies\".\n\nThe promotion of Al Shara'a and Al Moallem signalled Bashar was prepared to continue his confrontation with the United Nations, where an inquiry has implicated Syria in the assassination of former Lebanese premier Rafik Hariri.\n\nIt was not known if Al Shara'a's promotion was linked to the dismissal of former vice-president Abdul Halim Khaddam. In all, the reshuffle brought in 15 new ministers to the 34-member Cabinet. The change also affected the oil, communications, higher education, culture, electricity and transport ministries.\n\nKey changes\n\nFarouk Al Shara'a - Vice President\n\nWalid Al Moallem - Foreign Minister\n\nBrigadier General Bassam Abdul Majid - Interior Minister\n\nMohsen Bilal - Information Minister\n\nFayssal Mekdad - Deputy Foreign Minister"
