        "text": "Epilogue\n\n​\n\n“Take the giant step across the sky to the question marks that sparkle and beckon from the vastness of the universe.”\n\n– Rod Serling (OTL)\n\n“I’m really zapping out here, man,” I informed one of my few RL friends.\n\n“Dont” they quickly texted back.\n\nOh yeah, that really helps, I thought as I rolled his eyes at the message on my lar phone. “Just wish me luck,” I counter-texted, then slipped the device back into my inner suit pocket.\n\nI tried to think about something else but my mind just went on betraying me, directing my thought process away from efforts to calm down to ideas that only fueled my nervousness – leaving out something important, some embarrassing technical oversight, my pants falling down for some reason.\n\nI’m not entirely sure why I suffer from social anxiety. I speculate that it has something to do with some kind of incident in my youth. For one class I took back in college, I studied cases showing a link between traumatic incidents in the first few years of life with fears developed later in life. Given my family’s many connections, it wouldn’t be at all surprising if I was frightened at some by a crowd of strangers looking at me – likely as I stood near one of my more famous relatives.\n\n“Nervous, huh?” a man beside me said, breaking up my thoughts. It was a larger, burley man with his techslab in one hand, screen on, but not being used as the man was preoccupied with the uncooperative nature of his tie.\n\n“Maybe,” my attempt at a calm voice sounded more like a deep and ragged squeak. Clearing my throat, I added “I’ve got to prep for a pretty important announcement.”\n\n“Yeah, I know the feeling. Good luck to ya.”\n\n– Bill Adams Jr., blog transcript, 6:15 AM\n\nLeslie WALL: “But anyway, how are ya?”\n\nKathy PITCHFORD: “Uh, still a pain in your ass, probably. Hey. But, seriously, Liz, thanks. I’m not this kind of day person. Your check-in is like the only thing I wanted to get up for today.”\n\nWALL: “Really?”\n\nPITCHFORD: “Well, I’m not heading down until later in the day, so until then, I don’t have much to do outside of classes.”\n\nWALL: “Are they usually held so close to such a big holiday? And on Saturday, no less?”\n\nPITCHFORD: “It’s the summer semester program, so, yeah, for some of the classes. Mine, at least.”\n\nWALL: “Huh. Well, if you have extra time, you can just send out more job applications.”\n\nPITCHFORD: “What else is new?”\n\nWALL: “Ah. And I take it you still don’t want to take up my internship offer?”\n\nPITCHFORD: “Is your workaholism still contagious?”\n\nWALL: “Okay, fair enough.”\n\nPITCHFORD: “Uh-huh.”\n\nWALL: “So, you got all your stuff ready?”\n\nPITCHFORD: “Already packed, ready to ship off when the time comes.”\n\nWALL: “What’s your class line-up for today?”\n\nPITCHFORD: “Just three easy ones. Two Creative Writing courses, then the last one’s political philosophy.”\n\nWALL: “Oof. Sorry.”\n\nPITCHFORD: “No, I kind of like it. At least it’s not like my last semester’s personal finance class. Who needs to know that stuff?”\n\nWALL: “A lot more people than you realize, apparently.”\n\nPITCHFORD: “Ah well.”\n\nWALL: “Now I don’t want to mother you, but, please don’t skip breakfast this time, okay?”\n\nPITCHFORD: “Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know. I’ll grab an egg stick.”\n\nWALL: “I mean a real breakfast. Some fruit. Brain food.”\n\nPITCHFORD: “I’ll drink plenty of water and I’ll grab a toast-bar.”\n\nWALL: “Good enough for now I guess.”\n\nPITCHFORD: “Okay, I’ve got to dart off now.”\n\nWALL: “Stay safe.”\n\nPITCHFORD: “Toodles!”\n\n– University of Kentucky, Millie Sanders dormitory, private vidcall transcript, 6:45 AM\n\nI was all set for the big announcement. Then my boss arrived.\n\n“Hey!”\n\n“Oh, hi, ma’am.”\n\n“Adams, my coffee?”\n\n“Right here, ma’am.”\n\n“Just how I like it, right?”\n\n“Right. Uh, ma’am.”\n\nTaking a sip, she mumbled, “Mm, Good.”\n\nAt times it can be more demeaning than usual to be a “30-something” glorified coffee boy, but hey, everyone has to start somewhere. Even when they definitely could be starting somewhere closer to the top.\n\nI took my place on the side next to Menéndez, and watched my boss walk past me and toward the podium before the media. In the crowd of reporters, I spotted the burley man from the elevator. “Son of a –”\n\n“Hey, did you remember to place the water bottle on the little shelve-thing under her podium?” Menéndez suddenly whispered to me.\n\nIn the moment I couldn’t remember. With my heart skipping a beat, I quickly leaned over to take a peak before the boss could block the view. My breath returned when I saw it, and my memory of having just put it there swept back into my head. “Whew! You jumpstarted my heart there.”\n\n“Sorry,” he replied in a way that showed he didn’t even care to hide the fact that he really wasn’t.\n\n– Bill Adams Jr., blog transcript, 6:59 AM\n\n“Patrons, welcome. We were planning to make this announcement later this month, but due to recent ontech data spills, we have decided to address the reports immediately. We would like to inform you all that the spilled reports are true – NASA and Glenn Horizons, in collaboration with partnerized space agencies in Europe and India, have agreed to an ambitious plan to use the international Sustained Orbital Gateway, more commonly referred to as the Lunar Bot Hub, as a launch base to send remote vehicles to – and bring back iron, nickel and gold from – the core of the proto-planet ‘16 Psyche.’ Now, for those of you who are not familiar with 16 Psyche, allow me to explain. Most asteroid belts contain asteroids that are rocky or icy, but this one, possibly the heart of some long-dead planet, lost its rocky surface from violent collisions over the course of millions of years. The loss of the asteroid’s outermost layer has exposed its interior composition, which consists of large quantities of many valuable minerals.”\n\n“Yes, for this project, we are weighing the expenses of the robot drilling, as you put, against the many positive benefits from this investment.”\n\n“We are very much aware of the critical comments ontech claiming that this endeavor will devalue the prices of these minerals and bring about economic collapse. But we have published economic reports indicating that this will not occur due to supply-and-demand. These independently-funded reports clearly show that, if anything, economic downturn may occur if we don’t obtain these materials. In short, people, we cannot afford to go on without these minerals, especially since many of these materials are predominantly used in next-gen solar polar technology and manufacturing processes. The planet cannot afford to continue to rely on and use fossil fuels. To convert to renewable energy, securing materials required for solar panels and hydrogen projects is a must.”\n\n“We aim to launch in six years, but the total extraction and round trip will take roughly six more years. Even with that in mind, the launch will be a major milestone for international mineral-harvesting endeavors.”\n\n– NASA spokesperson, NASA Headquarters, Waterfront, PO, 7:00 AM\n\nI had just one more class to go. But before that, I met up with Arty for our soon-to-end tradition to eating at the campus’s KFC.\n\nArt was already there, rewatching the latest Dwiffix Nymity music video. We talked about it yet again as we got our orders.\n\n“Man, there’s never enough soda in the cup,” Arty remarked for the en-teenth time. “There’s just too much ice, like three-fifths is the actual drink.”\n\n“Yeah,” I go again, “But it’s the cleanest part of the food court.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah. So, you heading back to The Homestead tonight, right?”\n\nI nodded.\n\n“Oh, don’t look so glum. We’ll keep in touch on TellTalk.”\n\n“That’s the new one, right.”\n\n“Doi. BuddyTalk is getting too overrun with Centurion people. Entussasic’s getting a lot of ’em, too.”\n\nI paired my eye roll with the groan, “Freakin’ Centurions. They’re such drama award winners! It’s always ‘SARS’ this, ‘pandemic’ that, KW2, Lee Iacocca. It’s like, hello, all that stuff was decades ago, I mean, move on with your lives already! Everyone else has – we haven’t had any war as big as KW2 since KW2!”\n\nI’m not going to win over certain people by writing that, but it’s true. The pandemic sounded like it was an awful thing, but I’m too young to remember it. And before you call me insensitive, I know people – even relatives – who contracted SARS and lived but had health issues for the rest of their lives because of it. Even one of my many cousins got it at the time. They were, I want to say, three of four, and they have to take these pills to boost their immunity and combat all these brain issues, but they’re otherwise just fine. I’m not saying the pandemic wasn’t this awful thing, because it was, but was it really the only thing that certain people can remember from their entire childhood’s. Because it’s not healthy dwell on tragedy. Centurions – celebrate how far we’ve come since the pandemic and take stock of the many years that separate us from it, not just for our sake but for your own as well!\n\nAnyway, back to the hanging-out.\n\nAfter we finished our Spicy Chicken Combo Wraps we listened to some old T-Chong beats before I had to shove off to my last class.\n\n“Don’t become a stranger,” Art said.\n\nNow I’m just chillin’ in the classroom, waiting for the teach to show up. If Davis doesn’t arrive in another five minutes, we’re permitted to leave!\n\n– Kathy Pitchford, buddytalk plog, 3:10 PM\n\nDAVIS: “Every person who’s ever lived must be understood contextually to their own time and place. We change with our societies. Yes?”\n\nSTUDENT 1: “But given how social movements, uh, influence things, doesn’t that also mean that our societies change with us?”\n\nDAVIS: “That’s an excellent question. And it was one debated by many during the 1960s, a decade dominated in our collective memories more by the events of the first half (like the shoutniks versus the hippies and civil rights) than by the accomplishments of its second half. But let’s talk about the shoutniks and hippies to answer your question. Hippies opposed racial integration and claimed that it went against the nature of American citizens. Shoutniks argued the exact opposite, that racial prejudice was the result of segregationist policies and not the other way around. In the end, the fact that report and report confirm racism in the US against Black people is at an all-time low essentially proves the hippies wrong. So the answer is both – Civil Rights activists changed society, and those societal changes in turn influenced the racial relations of future generations. Yes?”\n\nSTUDENT 2: “Yeah, in the last article you assigned us, the author said the 1990s was a time of ‘rational conservatism’ and ‘political politeness.’ But given the bloodshed of the Dinger administration, isn’t that kind of inaccurate?”\n\nDAVIS: “Heh, you never check the date on things, Mitchell. Check the doc, it says publication: 2012. That was assigned to give you an understand of how people in the early 2010s viewed America’s political landscape at the time, with Democrats depending President Wellstone and Republicans torn on the sharply different optics of Kelsey Grammer and Harley Brown, especially when compared to previous administrations.”\n\nSTUDENT 2: “Oh. Okay. Never mind, then.”\n\nSTUDENT 3: “'T'sokay, dude, it was ’90s – the H.C. era – dawn of the home computer. Technet privacy levels weren’t such a hot-button issue.”\n\nDAVIS: “Actually they were toward the end of the decade.”\n\nSTUDENT 3: “Man, teach, you’re harshin’ everyone’s buzzes today. Mell out, it’s the last day of classes!”\n\nDAVIS: “And you’re just going to miss me terribly, aren’t you, Ambrose?”\n\nSTUDENT 3: “Eh, sure.”\n\n– Professor Geoff Davis, University of Kentucky, classroom recording, 4:50PM\n\nAHMED: “Jeez, dude, if you hate interning there, why don’t you get another job.”\n\nADAMS: “It’s my foot in the door. Not just anyone can work for NASA. And once I get more than just my foot into the door, there’s no telling how I’ll help humanity expand into space.”\n\nSCHWARTZ: “Why do you even care? It’s just an empty void with black holes and hots balls of gas.”\n\nAHMED: “But wait, if it’s got balls and stuff, how’s it empty. …Heh-heh. Balls.”\n\nADAMS: “Demetri, think about it. If the universe is 13.8 billion years old and modern man is not even half a million years old, then we’re only at the very beginning of human history. Humanity is still in its infancy. And if all those parenting books have taught me one thing – ”\n\nAHMED: “It’s how to parent?”\n\nADAMS: “If there’s one other thing those books have taught me, it’s that the early years of someone’s life are the most influential. The things they’re exposed to can affect their entire outlook on and pathway in life. So right now, anyone who has the ability to help humanity get the best ‘early years’ it possibly can absolutely should.”\n\nSCHWARTZ: “So how is space exploration essential to our early development?”\n\nADAMS: “Relatively speaking, we just figured out how to fly to other planets, and there’s a practically infinite number of galaxies out there for us to explore. If there’s life out there, that will just make humanity’s future more interesting. And if not, will just make it easier to mankind to spread out among the stars. It’s a total win-win either way. And it’s like I’ve said, nobody on this planet really knows what’s out there. The possibilities are endless. And while we ourselves will not live long enough to see what happens with space exploration in the long run, the best kind of legacy we can leave behind is the legacy of giving humanity the tools and the opportunities to reach its full potential at the ‘early’ stages of its existence.”\n\nAHMED: “So if humanity’s in its infancy, we won’t make it to even see it get into a good college!”\n\nADAMS: “Come on, dude, I’m being serious.”\n\nSCHWARTZ: “You know, Stephen King once described life as being repetitive like a wheel, predictably cyclical, with humanity doomed to always fall back into old bad habit. But Mr. King is overlooking something. If humanity is a wheel, it is circular, but it is also affected by the road it choose to go down. A wheel gets muddied, roughed up, worn down. It changes. It shows its age. Just something to think about.”\n\nADAMS: “The past never dies. It always slips into the present, past those whom fail to learn its lessons, and then into the future.”\n\nSCHWARTZ: “Hey, who’s the history dude around here?”\n\nADAMS: “I ain’t steppin’ on your toes, Demetri, I’m just saying that humanity is not inherently cruel, violent, and brutal. If that were true, the very concepts of love, mercy and compassion would be novel or obscure ones. And we never would have been able to work together to get to the moon and to Mars.”\n\nAHMED: “We went to the Moon because of military competition and we went to Mars because of economic competition. I don’t need to drop by Demetri’s office to learn about that.”\n\nADAMS: “There was more to it than that.”\n\nSCHWARTZ: “No, actually, Mo’s kind of right on this, competition was a major factor. But think of it – humanity’s tendency to form competing groups is what has spurred innovations for centuries, so really, it’s a good thing, and it only becomes a bad thing – warfare, slavery, exploitation, murder, et cetera – when left unchecked.”\n\nADAMS: “Then here’s hopin’ that future generations of competitors can show some more self-control.”\n\nAHMED: “I’ll drink to that. Hey, Joey! Another one of these!”\n\nSCHWARTZ: “See, it’s because of the future that I work in the archives. It’s not just about understanding the past but also preparing for the future, because the past is the map of yesterday you use to navigate the foggy waters of tomorrow.”\n\nAHMED: “You swiped that from somewhere, didn’t ya?”\n\nSCHWARTZ: “What, no I didn’t!”\n\nADAMS: [replying to lar phone murmur] “Oh s#!t, it’s getting late.”\n\nSCHWARTZ: “Only relatively.”\n\nADAMS: “No foolin’.” [checking lar phone] “Okay, the next Maglev is leaving at… S#!t, I gotta leave like right now.”\n\nAHMED: “So long then, bud!”\n\nSCHWARTZ: “Yeah, take care, man!”\n\nAHMED: “Okay, now that he’s gone, you can tell me – where’d you swipe that map line from?”\n\nSCHWARTZ: “I didn’t!”\n\nAHMED: “Alright, alright.”\n\n– Thirsty Fish Bar & Grill, bar room A/V security camera, Waterfront, PO, 5:58 PM\n\nMARCUS: “I’m telling you, Democrats fall in love, Republicans fall in line.”\n\nJAMES: “You know what, I’m just going to look it up. Hang on a sec.” [opened techslab, split the screen to browse clickopedia and work on Apple Notes.]\n\nCHELSEA: “Okay, while he’s working on that, I’m going to check on the slow-cooker.”\n\nMARCUS: “What’s even the point of that thing, honey? Life is so precious, why do you want to waste so much of it cooking something slowly when you cook use pretty much anything else to cook it quicker?”\n\nCHELSEA: “We’ve gone over this before, sweetums, and you just aren’t getting it.”\n\nMARCUS: “I’m getting smells wafting over here that wouldn’t smell so different if they were coming from a regular oven.”\n\nCHELSEA: “Didn’t your mother ever tell you not to insult a woman’s cooking?”\n\nMARCUS: “But you forget – this isn’t cooking, this is slow-cooking! Emphasis on the slow!”\n\nCHELSEA: “If you’re so impatient, go do something while you wait.”\n\nMARCUS: “I am doing something. I’m watching the game.”\n\nCHELSEA: “I thought it wasn't until 8:30.”\n\nMARCUS: “I’m watching the pre-game.”\n\nCHELSEA: “What –”\n\nJAMES: “Okay, sis, hold back your dogs for a second. Marcus, I have it.” [wholed the techslab’s screen] “Okay. First, the Democrats. Starting with the WWWII era. Democrats fell in line behind FDR and then behind Truman. The establishment backed Stevenson twice despite Kefauver being an option, and they back Johnson in 1960, with two other 1960 candidates, Humphrey and Kennedy, falling in line behind LBJ then and in 1964, too. In 1968, Both Humphrey and Kennedy were candidates but Kennedy won out so I don’t think it counts. We get our first ‘in-love’ candidate in ’72 with Mondale, as he beat Humphrey, who was that year’s ‘in-line’ candidate. Falling in love instead of in-line happened again in 1980 when Senator Scoop Jackson bested VP Gravel for the nomination, but Democrats returned to falling in line to back Gravel in 1984. But they did fall in love with Bellamy, nominating her over ’84 candidate John Glenn. But they fell in line behind Glenn in 1996. Then in 2000, they fell in line with Jackson, who had run in 1996 – everyone forgets that for some reason – but they fell in line for his VP, Paul Wellstone. Democrats then fell in love with Locke in 2016 and in love with Pritt in 2020.”\n\nMARCUS: “So…Democrats fall in love more often?”\n\nJAMES: “Almost evenly split, but, yeah.”\n\nCHELSEA: “They also win elections more often when they fall in love, don’t they?”\n\nJAMES: “Hm…The fell in line in 1968, 1984, and 1996, and they lost each time. But they did fall in line in 2000 and 2008 and win, but, yeah, you’re right.”\n\nCHELSEA: “Huh!”\n\nMARCUS: “And Republicans?”\n\nJAMES: [rolled to next screen-page] “For Republicans, Dewey ran in 1940, but won the nomination in 1944. Despite Stassen running in 1944, the GOP did not fall in line behind him in 1948 and the nomination went to Dewey again. They fell in love with Eisenhower and fell in line behind Nixon. They fell in love with Sanders and fell in line with Scranton. The same falling in love phenomenon occurred in 1976 and 1980, and even in 1988 against incumbent President Kemp, and again with Iacocca in 1992. They also didn’t fall in line in 2004, as former VP Meredith lost to first-time candidate Bernie Goetz. Falling in love with a first-time candidate instead of falling in line behind of previous candidate happened again in 2008 and in 2012. But they did fall in line behind Brown in 2020.”\n\nMARCUS: “Huh. So…Republicans fall in love with candidates more often?”\n\nJAMES: “Yes. Less so recently – in very, very, very recent years, not so much – but historically, as in for most of the past century, yes!”\n\nMARCUS: “Huh! Then the phrase is a dad-burned lie! Consarn it!”\n\n– Winger residence, home security footage, A/V camera, 6:19 PM\n\n…I didn’t arrive too late. I mean, yeah, Arista and Jasmine arrived at the home before my train even reached the station, but, heh, they’ve always been better organized than me.\n\nChelsea was in the kitchen trying to put together her own version of KFC, and by the time I’d found somebody to talk to – my “Uncle” James ain’t too bad – her efforts had sparked a debate with some other relatives over the merits fast food.\n\n“There’s been great strides in making it healthy!” Went one side of the argument.\n\nA more political side went, “I don’t know any Democrats that eat The Colonel’s food. What napkins,” referring to the latest term for chumps and push-overs.\n\nMy mother was smart to sit off to the side, avoiding the conflict. Mother is still set in her old ways, doing everything old-fashioned. Tonight, she seems almost happy that Chelsea’s dishwasher keeps breaking down (I heard something about Chelsea trying to use its heating/drying feature to try and cook chicken, what?). The malfunctioning appliance seems to be giving my Mother the excuse to wash the dishes manually, allowing her to make sure first-hand that they get washed “just right.” A Mother’s Touch and all that jazz.\n\nThen again, Mother probably avoided getting involved in the argument not to avoid headache or to simply wash dishes, but because she believed that the way that she made Kentucky-fried chicken was “100%” better than how KFC made it. \"Tastes almost the same, but healthier,\" you could say. Now she was trying for \"exactly the same and healthier.\"\n\nNobody exactly agreed with her level of self-confidence, but no one ever pressed her on it that much. No good can come from opposing such a claim from one’s own mother, after all...\n\n– Bill Adams Jr., blog transcript, 6:41 PM\n\nMARCUS: “Hey, kiddo!”\n\nLIZ: “Hey Dad.”\n\nMARCUS: “Where’s LeMarr?”\n\nLEMARR: “Hi Grampa!”\n\nLIZ: “Hey, there’s my little Havana banana!

Now I’m turning in for the night. The Wingers were courteous enough to let me sleep on the pull-out instead of the futon. The Pitchfords got the guestroom.\n\n– Bill Adams Jr., blog transcript, 10:57 PM\n\n“Morning everyone! Big day today! Wishing everyone a happy and joyous celebration of this awesome holiday! I’ll be spending the day hanging out with my extended family members; we’re having a big pool party with music, slip-in-slide, water balloons and all the classic fixin’s – but sorry, it’s pretty much relatives only – but you can still reach out to me on this channel, my secondary channel, and my profiles on Quinny, Shandle, Volsov, Nyvyn, Ta-da, and my newest profile, which is on TellTalk, or TeleTalk for all you Commonwealthers. H.A.G.T., everyone!”\n\n– Kathy Pitchford, buddytalk plog, 9:02 AM\n\nCaetlyn looked at the painting with awe. “Wow! Sis, come over here!” She called over Kathy to join her in starting at the artwork successfully hiding the family safe.\n\nSeeing a Ross original in person is a rare treat. Most are in museums, but the Wingers have connections. That’s one good thing I can say about Marcus – the man has taste. Indeed, observing the works of the technet’s favorite VP ontech pales in comparison to studying the real thing up close, where the viewer can notice little details such as the way the paint breaks over the mountains, the detailed bark that appears three dimensional, and ghostly trees nestled into the background. [2] Features that simply fail to pop out at you on video alone.\n\n“Well, at least they know good art when they see it,” I commented to “Uncle” James.\n\n“Hm.”\n\nAs they both gawked at the ripple effect used from the small brook in the left-hand corner, I asked James, “How exactly are they related to us?”\n\n“They’re Millie’s great-granddaughters.”\n\n“Ah.” [3]\n\nOutside, I could hear the younger relatives splashing about in the Winger pool. A booming voice ended the nearby sound of fast-paced flip-flops. Great-Grandmother Clarise was almost 80 years old, but she could still holler out “No running” from her spot under her sunbrella without even slightly straining her voice.\n\nAt that moment, Liz – James’ brother’s daughter-in-law – came walking around the corner. Her hand practically glued to her head, she was having an argument with someone on her lar phone. Her husband, hot on her trail, caught up to her and remarked, “You know honey, research shows that close personal relationships, a challenging job or hobby, and helping others through pro-social behavior are keys to happiness. But getting yourself worked up over your job, well, isn’t.”\n\nLiz gave him a certain kind of look and he seemed to back down, but then Tiberius began to utilize the skills he picked up calming down suspects for law enforcement. “Honey, who do you work for?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Who do you work for?” He reiterated.\n\n“Why’s he egging her on?” I whispered to James.\n\n“Just watch, he knows what he’s doing,” James quietly answered.\n\n“Nobody,” Liz replied, “I’m freelance.”\n\n“Alright, think about that for a minute,” Tiberius asked sweetly but cautiously, “What does that mean?”\n\n“It means I am my own boss.”\n\n“Then who’s bossing you around right now?”\n\n“Nobody.”\n\n“…Then what are you doing?”\n\nAfter a momentary pause, Liz broke the intensity of the situation by groaning, “Okay, alright, I see what you’re saying.” Talking into the phone, she said, “I’m sorry, sir, but something’s come up. I’m going to have to call you later.”\n\n“Tomorrow,” Tiberius whispered.\n\n“Tomorrow. Early tomorrow,” Liz added, then hung up the phone.\n\nAs the two hugged it out, Old Marcus sauntered into the room, “Ah, it’s good to see those too still acting like newlyweds. Say James, I was I pecking at that idea you had for Chelsea’s recipe.”\n\n“Which one?”\n\n“BBQ grill.”\n\nAs the two walked away, I looked around the room and found myself walking over to Old Marcus’ den. Front and center was this huge desk made out of hand-carved mahogany, facing a wall strewn with pictures of family gatherings, reunions, outings, vacations, trips, graduations and weddings. “Learn to scan-and-uploaded, Marcus.” I thought out loud, but quietly. Then I spotted a newspaper on the desk. An old-fashioned, paper-and-ink, corporeal, printed newspaper. Marked from the previous week, the page it was opened to read KFC CEMENTS NO. SPOT 1 IN PRC …Kentucky Fried Chicken is still the No. 1 Fast Food Company in China, after two competing domestic brands struggled to beat them in the markets… “Man, he’s more comfortably set in old ways than I thought,” I remarked aloud, thinking about the last time I’d even seen a print newspaper. It must be some sort of special subscription thing.\n\n– Bill Adams Jr., blog transcript, 5:43 PM\n\nMARTHA: “It’s actually very common for children to think that The Colonel is a fictional creation. It’s only when they see his likeness on the banner of US Presidents running along the top of their elementary school classroom that they finally realize that The Colonel was indeed a real person, and isn’t just some mascot like Tony the Tiger or Crispy Chris the Cookie Crisp Coyote.”\n\nMARCUS: “That’s an injustice to The Colonel’s legacy.”\n\nMARTHA: “Not really, because the children are always amazed by his life and legacy. ‘Why was he President,’ a student may ask. And I’ll joke, ‘Why? Because his chicken was so good, we though he deserved the Presidency!’ To this, the child will go and say something like, ‘cool!’ or, rather, ‘bizzin!,’ to use the more modern lingo.”\n\nMARCUS: “It that how the kids in your class talk, LeMarr?”\n\nLEMARR: “Kinda.”\n\nJAMES: “Yeah, it’s because of The Colonel that Martha got into teaching in the first place, isn’t that right, dear?”\n\nMARTHA: “Yes. The Colonel always believed in the good of our youth. He understood that they are the future, and that the actions we adults do will affect them and their own children long after we are gone.”\n\nBILL: “They will remember us by how we treat them.”\n\nMARCUS: “Huh. It speaks.”\n\nMARTHA: “Yes, Bill, exactly, thanks.”\n\nMARCUS: “Hey, Bill, I got a question for ya.”\n\nBILL: “Y-yes?”\n\nMARCUS: “I hear you work for NASA. Since we’re talking about KFC, what do think about KFC being on the Milestone and Seeker.”\n\nKATHY: “Oh yeah, I learned about that in school. It was like a ‘fun fact’ or something, KFC made special food packages for the Marstronaut mission of, like, 2003 or whenever.”\n\nMARCUS: “Right.”\n\nKATHY: “They made The Colonel’s chicken ‘out of this world,’ or some gimmicky thing like that. It was called ‘Operation Plucked Martian’ or something.”\n\nMARCUS: “Well, Bill? What did you think of it?”\n\nBILL: “Well, um – well, I think it was good that NASA partnered with lots of different companies, it really opened the door for the privatization of space, and showed that NASA can and will work with anybody to achieve major scientific milestones. So, uh, yeah, I thought it was a, uh, a great thing.”\n\nMARCUS: “Felt like a lousy gimmick to me.”\n\nBILL: “Oh. [clears throat] Well, maybe, but sending anything into space isn’t a cheap gimmick, at least.”\n\nMARCUS: “Eh, you might be right about that, maybe.”\n\n– Winger residence, home security footage, A/V camera, 7:23 PM\n\n“No, we started eating at around 7:00… Forever, like a marathon, but we were done in time to see the lights at 10 o’clock… Not too much, just some old family recipes. Hot biscuits and corn fritters, some corn chowder, hush puppies. Candied sweet potatoes, scalloped sweet potatoes, and some old-fashioned onion pie – I could LeMarr hated it, he didn’t have to say anything, I could read it on his face, the sweet boy. …No, for the turkey I tried something new. …Roast turkey with fried green tomato bread stuffing. ...No, most seemed to really like it! But, I also made some apple-stuffed pork chops and lots of hot dogs just in case. …We ate those too. …Well of course I made chicken, too, that just goes without saying by now! …Pecan pie, and apple pie for the three relatives allergic to pecan. …No, if anything, allergy issues let you come up with new ways of making old classics, so there’s no problems with it on my end. …Mint Juleps… Really? Huh! Well, ain’t that something… How sweet! …Yeah? …Oh, you just missed them. …No, sorry, they already said their goodbyes, and the Pitchfords just left, too. But Bill and his wife and little girl are sticking around a bit longer to help me with more chicken ideas. I insisted, poor Bill’s practically skin and bones. You want to talk to Bill? …Oh. Okay. No, it’s alright… Yes, Leslie’s here, too, but she and Tiberius volunteered to clean up the living room. …Yeah, lots of plates need washing. …Yeah, the machine’s still not working for some reason…”\n\n– Chelsea Winger, lar phone conversation with her brother Darrell Winger, privacy recording, 8:38 PM\n\n“I’m failing to get to sleep, so I’m going to try and will myself to do so by focusing on simply breathing. That’s the secret key to relaxing. Don’t try and block out thoughts or external sounds. Instead, just focus on one thought, the act of breathing, an automatic program responsible for living, for experiencing existence. With that, I should be able to drift off to that place where dreams are formed. You know, consciousness is really a beautiful thing. It can inspire you or terrify you into being courageous with the one life that you, me, each of us get, and work to overcome any challenges to make our dreams real.”\n\n– Kathy Pitchford, buddytalk plog, 11:15 PM\n\nIt is approaching midnight, and Chelsea is still slaving away over the pressure fryer. By now, with Arista taking Jasmine home, the taste-testing committee was down to just me, Chelsea’s brother James, James’ wife Martha, Old Marcus, Liz, Tiberius and LeMarr. LeMarr represented the “future customers” opinion of our little ad hoc collection of amateur chicken judges; Old Marcus had made sure of that.\n\n“This time, I know I’ve done it right!” You could hear her exclaim from the adjacent room.\n\n“Honey,” her husband pleaded, rubbing his stomach, “You’ve been at this for hours. How about starting again fresh first thing tomorrow?”\n\n“Because for all you know, Marcus, somebody else will figure it out by then,” was her reply as she fiddled with the sleek new model. “The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese!”\n\nShaking his head, he countered, “But you can’t rush art.”\n\n“Who said anything about rushing? Don’t you remember the slow-cooker?”\n\n“I still don’t know why you thought that would work.”\n\n“You enjoyed that chicken.”\n\n“I did, but now that you’ve had us sample so much, I’ve reached my limit.”\n\n“Alright, hun. Just this last batch, and that’s it for the night,” she promised while jotting a not down on her Nokia5.0, “Okay?”\n\n“Okay.”\n\nAs Marcus returned to the table, Martha began to tap an Oneida spoon on her matching glass. Rising, she began, “Well with one last go at it, I think we should a toast to Martha for trying so hard.” Raising her glass, she took a quick for careful sip. “You know, when Colonel Sanders started his company, he probably never thought in even his wildest dreams that he would become such a revered pop-culture icon. Even after cameoing in all those movies, like It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, and in all those Jerry Lewis vehicles, he still probably never thought that decades after his demise he would still be used as an examples of success, or used to poke fun at the ‘ridiculousness’ of American politics and society.”\n\n“If your product is good enough, we might just make you our leader!” Marcus recited the tired old line, with only LeMarr giving it a chuckle.\n\n“Yes, well,” Martha concluded, “I would like to also make a toast to The Colonel. May his dedication to pursuing efforts to help people be not a source of ridicule but a source of inspiration for many more years to come.”\n\n“Amen to that, sister,” Marcus remarks.\n\n“Alright, everyone,” Chelsea walked out with a plate of eight bird pieces, one for each of us. “I’m certain this new batch is the one to perfectly replicate the Colonel’s recipe.”\n\nExpecting these delectable health-conscious helpings to be like the rest of them had been - delicious but still a bit off the mark - we all began to chow down, but quickly stopped. We were all astounded by the familiarity of the blend coating the skin of these birds. Marcus proclaimed with awe, “Chelsea…I think you cracked the code.”\n\nSurprised and elated by the family approval of her most accurate replication yet, she uttered in happy disbelief, “Well I’ll be! You really think so?”\n\n\"If The Colonel could taste this, I bet he'd think it was his own!\" Tiberius remarked.\n\nJames added dramatically, \"Yeah, he'd appreciate the hard work put into this, I'm sure, but when he'd realize he'd been hornswoggled, I bet he'd shout out a thunderous 'Consarn it!'\"\n\n– Bill Adams Jr., blog transcript, 11:55 PM\n\n[pic: imgur.com/diBZGGT.png ]​\n\nNOTE(S)/SOURCE(S)\n\n[1] OTL quote from the film “Moms’ Night Out” (2014)\n\n[2] These italicized passages were pull from the 9/10/2019 gardenandgun.com article by Jessica Giles “Bob Ross Gets The Recognition He Deserves”\n\n[3] This family’s “tree” was included in Chapter 112\n\nStay tuned for the Index Chapters!\n\nIndex 1 – World Leaders\n\nWorld Leaders from this TL (c. 1960-present (2021))\n\n​\n\nSecretary-General of the UNITED NATIONS\n\n1946-1952: 1) Trygve Lie of Norway – resigned\n\n1953-1961: 2) Dag Hammarskjold of Sweden – died in a plane crash\n\n1961-1971: 3) U Thant of Myanmar – retired\n\n1972-1981: 4) Max Jakobson of Finland – retired\n\n1981-1986: 5) Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania – lost re-election over alleged regional favoritism\n\n1986-1996: 6) Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan of Iran and Switzerland – withdrew from re-election bid amid criticisms over his handling of human rights crises in Africa and Asia\n\n1996-2006: 7) Carol Bellamy of the United States – term-limited;
