        "text": "Persian baby names often originate from a work of Persian literature called the Shahnameh (the Book of Kings), making them beautiful and unique options for your little one.\n\nIran, also called Persia, with its illustrious and historical past, has been an example of a developed nation in ancient times. The Persians are known for their intricately inlaid metalwork and their legacy of show-stopping architecture. In several ancient cities, beautifully decorated pre-Islamic structures remain to this day, as do spectacular mosques and shrines. Persian heritage, traditions, and culture have influenced the many distinctive names you can bestow upon your child.\n\nWell-known Persian names, such as Armon, Darius, and Keyon, are strong and sophisticated; while Jasmine, Parisa, and Viana are both bold and pretty. However, you do need to be a tad cautious with Persian baby names. Some of the meanings, myths, and stories behind a name are not always as cheerful as you might imagine.\n\nIn fact, the Persian boy name, Ahriman means devil or evil spirit. In mythology, this is the name of the god of darkness, death, and destruction. That said, if you do want to choose a Persian name with a positive meaning, there are still many options.\n\nTake the Persian boy name Ashtad, which means justice; or the girl name Esme, which means beloved. See, it’s always wise—and fun—to do a little research behind the names on your list before you make a final decision.Got a baby on the way? Consider these 50 Persian baby names.\n\nPersian Names\n\nAliyeh\n\nAmira\n\nCyrus\n\nDalileh\n\nEsther\n\nHana\n\nHassan\n\nJasper\n\nLaila\n\nSara\n\nPopular Persian Baby Names for Girls\n\nHere are some of the most popular Persian girl baby names and their origins.
