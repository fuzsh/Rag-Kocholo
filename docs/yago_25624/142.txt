Synopsis

Jacques Doillon, director of the widely loved Ponette, has crafted a wonderful follow-up, the gritty and authentic, yet also unexpectedly lyrical and buoyant Petits Freres.

Talia, a 13-year old girl who is already battle weary from fighting with her mean stepfather, runs away from home with her beloved dog Kim. She meets up with a group of four boys her own age who take a grudging liking to her - which doesn't stop them from secretly stealing and selling Kim.

Talia, distraught over the disappearance of her pet, strikes an uneasy friendship with the boys in an attempt to rescue Kim. Soon Talia and her gang of "petits freres" (little fellas) find real friendship and humanity in their harsh surroundings.

Reviews

"Simple, spontaneous and moving, Petits Freres is a mini-masterpiece!" - IndieRag

"Jacques Doillon seems to have a special radar into the inner lives of children.. . . a poignant study of latchkey children trying establish a fragile community in a corrupt, crime-ridden environment." - The New York Times
