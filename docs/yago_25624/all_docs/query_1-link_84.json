        "text": "07/06/2011\n\nShooting will start next Monday in Lille on the 26th narrative feature by Jacques Doillon (67): Un Enfant de Toi (“A Child By You”).\n\nThe director has cast his daughter Lou Doillon (who recently made a brief appearance in Poliss ) for the third time after Too Much (Little) Love (1998) and Totally Flaky (2001). The film will also star Samuel Benchetrit (Chez Gino ), Malik Zidi (seen in The Queen of Clubs and set to grace screens in the autumn in Rebellion) and Marilyne Fontaine (who is making her big-screen debut).\n\nScripted by the director, the film centres on Aya (Doillon) who split up from Louis (Benchetrit) a long time ago. Together, they had a daughter Lina who is now seven.\n\nNowadays, Aya lives with Victor (Zidi) with whom she would like to have a child. Meanwhile, Louis is in a relationship with Gaëlle (Fontaine) without really committing himself.\n\nOver nine secret meetings organised by Aya, the flame is rekindled between the two former lovers. This reunion won’t be without heartbreak for a couple torn between a fierce struggle against romantic pretence and the search for ultimate harmony.\n\nAs a recap, Jacques Doillon has been selected four times in competition at Berlin (where he won a Special Prize in 1991), twice at Cannes and twice at Venice (most recently in 2003).\n\nProduced by Mani Mortazavi and David Mathieu-Mahias for 4 A 4 Productions, Un Enfant de Toi has received co-production support from CRRAV (Nord-Pas de Calais region), pre-acquisitions from Canal + and Ciné+ (formerly CinéCinéma), an advance on receipts from the National Film and Moving Image Centre (CNC) and a grant from Centre Images.\n\nThe six-week shoot will take place in Lille and Tours with lensing by seasoned DoP Renato Berta (who has just won a David di Donatello Award for his work on Mario Martone’s We Believed ). The film will be launched in French theatres in the first half of 2012 by Sophie Dulac Distribution and international sales are being managed by Doc & Film International.\n\n(Translated from French)"
