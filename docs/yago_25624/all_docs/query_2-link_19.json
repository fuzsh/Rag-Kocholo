        "text": "First of all this is a French film with English subtitles, but it is by far the best movie I have ever seen, it’s worth the reading. “Ponette” is about a four year-old girl whose mother dies in a car crash and how she deals with it.\n\nShe encounters a number of people telling her different ways to deal with her pain, most of which include God. Unfortunately, most of the advice comes from other children who know just enough about God coupled with their rampant imaginations to really confuse little Ponette.\n\nThis film pulls at your heartstrings as you watch a cute little four year old girl crying out in desperation to God. This is a painfully honest film, about a painful subject. That hasn’t had all of the unneeded factors (i.e. sex, violence, profanity) added so the public will view it. The ending could have used a bit of work, but it’s a movie, so it gets a happy ending and leaves you with a good message. Director Jaques Doillon does a wonderful job of making you feel as though you’re actually seeing the world through four year old eyes, with excellent dialog, and the fact that the camera is placed so that most adult are portrayed by their knees.\n\nThis film has no profanity or sex, and on a whole presents some pretty biblically sound advice on the greiving process for everyone."
