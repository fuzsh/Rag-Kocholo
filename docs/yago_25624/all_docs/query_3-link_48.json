        "text": "Small films sometimes seem more personal on small screens than they do in theaters. When the characters themselves are as small as they are in ''Ponette,'' intimacy becomes all the stronger. Released this week by Fox Lorber, the highly acclaimed French film, directed by Jacques Doillon, is so acutely focused that large-screen settings are more or less beside the point.\n\nPonette (Victoire Thivisol), who is 4 years old, and her mother have been in a car crash. Ponette has only a broken arm. ''Mommy is in pretty bad shape,'' says her father (Xavier Beauvois), a loving man who speaks plainly to his child. ''The doctors think she may die.''\n\nThe mother dies and Ponette is sent to live with her aunt and cousins, who are about her age. So intense is her grief and desire to get her mother back that she spends every waking moment hoping and scheming to effect a resurrection. She becomes so riveting that it's almost a chore to tear one's eyes off her to acknowledge others in the film.\n\n''It's about desperation, not death,'' Mr. Doillon said in an interview from Paris. The drama takes place between Ponette and her peers, with adults interceding only occasionally. One of the film's most remarkable features is that a half-dozen small children can carry such a tale so compellingly and with such scant sentimentality. ''You know, Jesus is not almighty,'' one child tells Ponette. If Jesus got resurrected, why not Ponette's mother?\n\nTo cast his film, Mr. Doillon sent six camera crews to schools and day-care centers in 10 French cities. Finding the right children, explaining the situation in the film to them and feeling out their reactions took 10 months.\n\nMr. Doillon, 54, has directed 19 feature films. He said that he used his experience as a documentarian to observe the children's responses without intruding. ''I didn't start with the fiction until I was sure I got it,'' he said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
