He was 29 years older at the time.\n\nJapan's Seiji Ozawa, one of world's best-known conductors, dead at 88\n\nDoillon and the director Benoit Jacquot were targeted this week by a complaint from Godreche, which prompted French prosecutors to open an investigation.\n\n\"I am watching with attention this upheaval, not to say this revolution, initiated and carried by women, whose voices have been freeing up for several years now,\" Doillon said.\n\n\"However, I have never committed the acts of which I have been accused, and I will provide the courts, since the case is now before them, with all the factual elements at my disposal to demonstrate my innocence,\" he added.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio sparks global support for Swift Parrots, calls for an end to native forest logging\n\nHe also denied being close to Jacquot, who is facing accusations of abuse and violence by Godreche.\n\nJacquot, who is 25 years older than the actor, directed her on screen and had a six-year relationship with her that started when she was only 14."
