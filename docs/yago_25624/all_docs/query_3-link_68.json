Ponette tore my aching heart into shreds of paper ingrained with painful scribbles. I cannot claim my experiences are even remotely close to this poignant tragedy forming the base of the film, but it digs deep into the empathetic viewer's sensitivity and mercilessly shatters it with it's touch. As a child I often, perhaps like many others, was petrified with the thought of losing my parents one day followed by the incomprehensible feeling of being left alone, completely devoid of emotional, physical and mental support.\n\nThis film bravely reveals this scenario in little Ponnete's life who loses her mother early, only for her father to send her into an unsympathetic environment, extending into daunting unfamiliarity soon after. Despite not having much experience with children myself, I felt my heart sinking deeper into the pit Ponette seemed to fall into, confused when asked to deal not only with reality but the projected realism and spiritual faith following it. She latched onto Yoyotte for unconditional support but awaited her mother's response.\n\nJacques Doillon. I salute you. One needs to witness his direction manifesting into these children's depiction of innocence to understand the hype, especially Victoire Thivisol as Poinette herself. Her range of emotions and nuances transcended even the greatest acting performances. Ever (she's freaking FOUR in this film!). The dialogues are perfect, and I presume the crew understood children and their nuances very well to be able to shape this film into something completely pure and thought provoking, without resorting to forceful empathy and aww moments.\n\n\"Ponette: I want to die.\n\nMathias: Why?\n\nPonette: Because I want to.\n\nMathias: It's Antoine?\n\nPonette: It's me.\n\nMathias: What did he say?\n\nPonette: That I was very bad and it's my fault mommy died.\"\n\nMathias: That's stupid. I am nice and you are nice.\"\n\nI'm shaking. My heart hurts and after soothing it with a sound sleep, I shall be full of admiration for the way this film made me feel. A masterpiece."
