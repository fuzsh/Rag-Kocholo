        "text": "French filmmakers Benoît Jacquot and Jacques Doillon have reportedly been taken into custody by Paris police investigating several claims of sexual violence against minors.\n\nAn accusation against was first made public in February by the French actress Judith Godrèche, 51, who alleges she was raped by Jacquot when she was 14 and he was 39.\n\nJacquot, one of France's most prominent directors, whose 2013 film Les Adieux à la reine (Farewell, My Queen) won three César awards (the French equivalent of an Oscar), has previously denied the accusations, describing their relationship at the time as \"loving.\"\n\nGodrèche and Jacquot met in 1986 on the set of his movie Les Mendiants, which was released two years later.\n\nDespite the 25 year age gap, they began a relationship which went on for six years, during which time the actress says she was “in (Jacquot’s) grip.” She also starred in his 1990 film La Désenchantée (The Disenchanted).\n\nShe has also claimed that Jacques Doillon committed sexual abuse while he was directing a film when she was 15. Doillon is 28 years older than her.\n\nIn March, the actress Julia Roy accused Jacquot of sexual violence committed during multiple years while in May, the actress Isild Le Besco also accused Jacquot of rape several times during 1998 and 2007.\n\nShe is also accusing another film director, Jacques Doillon, of sexual abuse while he was directing a film when she was 15. Doillon is 28 years older than her.\n\n#MeToo in French cinema\n\nThe French film industry is also reeling from Friday's sexual aggression conviction of Dominique Boutonnat, the now-ex president of the powerful Centre for National Cinema (CNC); the organisation leading the fight against sexual violence in the cinema.\n\nHe was sentenced to jail for three years for committing lewd acts against his god-son when he was 21. Boutonnat had also faced multiple calls to stand down while his fate remained in the balance."
