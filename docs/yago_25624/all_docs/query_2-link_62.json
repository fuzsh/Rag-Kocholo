        "text": "Singer-songwriter Ponette has kicked off her 2023 campaign with the release of \"Beats Me Up\", a song that is a continuation of what the Norwegian artist gave listeners with the release of her debut album, back in 2020.\n\nThis electronic track is the perfect example of how Ponette is able to incorporate mixes of experimental, indie-pop sound – including synthy and distorted elements beneath her soft, sincere lyricism – and underlying smooth pallet. Vocally, this song further showcases one of her many strengths: weaving vocals and distorted, glitchy production. Also, instrumentally Ponette's production is on point with elements of glitchy, heavy synths, building atmospherics and a sharp bass-driven sound.\n\nIn saying that though, I'd be remiss to overlook the song's story – spread throughout all of the gloriousness of sound quality – about the tale of needing to escape from a relationship and feeling as though you need some space."
