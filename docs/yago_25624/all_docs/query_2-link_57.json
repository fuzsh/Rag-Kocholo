        "text": "Two of Norwayâ€™s biggest newcomers join forces today on the release of â€˜Fake My Feelingsâ€™.\n\nAs expected, this collaboration between Ponette and Torine is nothing short of pop perfection, and treats listeners to an anthemic song that somehow feels both playful and melancholic at the same time.\n\nTo date, Ponette has amassed millions of catalogue streams while also receiving tastemaker support from the likes of NRK P3 (Norwayâ€™s national radio), Earmilk and Acid Stag.\n\nMeanwhile, Torine continues to build on her impressive run of global hits (totalling over 45 million streams), and currently commands more than 600k listeners on Spotify alone.\n\nâ€˜Fake My Feelingsâ€™ is produced by Coucheron, and is lifted from Ponetteâ€™s forthcoming album, which is released soon.\n\nPonette | Torine\n\nðŸŽµ Follow the Scandinavia Sound Playlist\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nTrack of the week. Norwegian artist Ponette has rapidly shown herself to be one of the Nordic nationâ€™s most promising new talents recently.\n\nWith a production that is stripped-back and relatively subdued, â€˜Losing Meâ€™ is a mesmerisingly moving song that is immediately captivating.\n\nPonette\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
