        "text": "Jane Birkin delivers a daring performance in this emotionally charged psychological drama. She stars as Anne, a disturbed young woman who leaves her husband and returns home to her parents. But when she discovers that her father (the great Michel Piccoli) is having an affair, the possessive Anne is pushed over the edge. Directed by Birkin’s then-partner Jacques Doillon, this taboo-shattering exploration of father-daughter relationships marked a decisive turning point in Birkin’s career. As she stated, “It was the first time that someone making so-called ‘intellectual’ films thought of me… I made La fille prodigue, and was then regarded as a serious actress in France.” The moody lensing is courtesy of renowned cinematographer Pierre Lhomme (Army of Shadows)."
