Left by her father with a caring aunt and her children, Ponette grieves, secretly hoping her mother will somehow come back. Confused by the religious explanations provided by adults, and challenged by the cruel taunts of a few children at school, little Ponette must make her way through her emotional turmoil.",

        "text": "If we can describe Maurice Pialat’s films as raw-raw, I venture to say that Jacques Doillon’s are, after seeing Ponette, are sleek-raw: the emotion is there as frighteningly strong and frontal as Pialat’s, but Doillon’s characters put a face on top of that emotion. It is not a mask per se, but it is a face of someone constantly thinking, constantly considering. We see them feel, but before that we see them thinking about what they are feeling. It puts a layer between their truest emotions and the world around them, as if they have to first process the drama, process the situation that is happening to them right now before they can absorb it and feel something.\n\nIn fact, Ponette,…\n\n\"You can die, but die alive, full of life.\n\nUntil then, the world is yours.\n\nTrying everything. Every single thing.\n\nThen you can die.\"\n\nHoly shit. Well, I'm crying.\n\nI've BEEN crying for a number of minutes now.\n\nThis has to be the most heartbreaking movie I've seen in - well, I don't even know. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I lost one of my own parents at a young age, or perhaps Ponette is simply one of the most genuine looks at a child's grief that I have ever seen. Very rarely will you hear me use the word transcendent; I save it for truly extraordinary, almost spiritual cinematic experiences like Stalker and Tropical Malady...…\n\nPonette's crying is THE MOST REALISTIC CRYING IN CINEMA HISTORY!!\n\nThere is no Hollywood hot-shot who can top her performance, nor is or was there any other child-actor as authentic as her!\n\nYet, even though Victoria Thivisol's performance is revelatory in every sense of the word, the rest of the film isn't as perfectly fitting as I expected it to be. I firstly didn't expect the film to be so heavy on the religious explanation so many adults give to the children, but it does work and the fact that they kind of \"indoctrinate\" their children with their ideas of the afterlife and heaven only adds to the realistic depiction of grieve in this film. Actually, if there wasn't any…\n\nFollows Ponette, a young girl who is trying to cope with devastating grief. The film is pretty extraordinary in terms of the cast - most of which are 5 year old children. How director Jacques Doillon got these performances out of them is nothing short of a miracle.\n\nThe camera is placed at Ponette's eye level for most of the film, so the audience is placed in her realm, with just fleeting interactions with adults. We journey with Ponette at school, with her peers, and in her habitat alone, trying to make sense of the direction that her family is heading. It's a heartbreaking watch at times, and there's also a tragic real life history regarding Marie Trintignant (daughter of…\n\nPonette is one of those films that presents a complex reality largely from a child's perspective - like Tomboy or Florida Project.\n\nOne detail I really appreciated is that, in all the awkward conversations Ponette has with an adult about the death of her mother, the movie never ever ends the scene with a cut to a concerned, pensive, saddened adult, which would be such an obvious easy trope to resort to. Instead, it simply sticks with Ponette in her path of grief and confusion, and you’re left with a feeling of nothing but vague unsatisfactory answers, of incompleteness, even anxiety, which is exactly right. It really puts across the scary feeling of being completely alone to figure things out…"
