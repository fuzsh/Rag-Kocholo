        "text": "Jane Birkin doesn’t watch her own films. “I don’t even know that I saw most of them when they came out,” she says, laughing. “There are a few I have seen and thank goodness never saw again.” But when T sat down with Birkin ahead of “Jane and Charlotte Forever,” a series at the Film Society of Lincoln Center dedicated to the acting work of Birkin and daughter Charlotte Gainsbourg, she was eager to talk about her many collaborations — with former partners Serge Gainsbourg and Jacques Doillon, as well as Agnès Varda — and why’s she now more content doing her own thing.\n\nIt struck me that your body of work is almost like a family photo album.\n\nI haven’t thought of it that way, although it’s what I wanted. I was happy that Charlotte was in “Kung Fu Master,” although she didn’t want to be in it. My daughter Lou is in it too, and I’ve always liked that. I think it’s lovely when you can be with your own and it’s nice looking back, because you have traces of them with their childish faces. It was exciting when Charlotte started acting, and my mother was so excited. She was always so proud of Charlotte; I don’t know about me. But she thought it was such a pity that we all had different names, because the Redgraves all had the same name. I wish I had done a film with my mother. I’m writing one now.\n\nHow was your former partner Serge Gainsbourg as a filmmaker?\n\nWith “Je t’aime moi non plus” I’ve never known him happier. He was so happy with what we gave, and we gave everything. I was so pleased to have pleased him.\n\nYou then made films with Jacques Doillon, which signaled a major shift in your acting.\n\nThey were probably the best films I did, what one was allowed to put into it. Jacques is somebody who is quite extraordinary with actors. He would rather do one hundred takes if necessary. He’s looking for the accident; he’s not looking for the polished performance. I knew that if I jumped, he would be there to receive me. He wouldn’t opt for anything less."
