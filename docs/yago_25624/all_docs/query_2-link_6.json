        "text": "Ponette is a 1996 French drama film directed by Jacques Doillon which was released on September 25, 1996 by BAC Films.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe film centers on Ponette, a 4-year-old girl who struggles to come to terms with the death of her mother in a car crash.\n\nCast[]\n\nVictoire Thivisol as Ponette\n\nDelphine Schiltz as Delphine\n\nMatiaz Bureau Caton as Matiaz\n\nLéopoldine Serre as Ada\n\nMarie Trintignant as Mother\n\nXavier Beauvois as Father\n\nClaire Nebout as Aunt Claire\n\nBox Office[]\n\n\"Ponette\" grossed $1,300,377 worldwide at the box office.\n\nCritical Reception[]\n\nRoger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times said: \"Watching this film is like eavesdropping on bright children and observing the process by which their intelligence builds their personalities, their beliefs, their strategies and their minds.\"\n\nThe Austin Chronicle praised Victoire Thivisol's performance, writing: \"The naturalism and expressiveness of this child as she moves through a host of difficult emotions is more like experiencing the unabashed realism of a fragile soul bared than the witnessing of a great performance.\"\n\nKeith Phipps from The A.V. Club wrote: \"Director Jacques Doillon's almost documentary-like film is strongest when almost fully immersed in the psyche of [Victoire] Thivisol's mournful character. Though her elaborate, incompatible religious fantasies of reunion—never depicted through any means other than dialogue—follow no recognizable logic, the film, due largely to four-year-old Thivisol's remarkable performance, makes them thoroughly, painfully believable, making its magic-realism finale seem like something like a cop-out.\"\n\nJames Berardinelli from ReelViews said: \"From start to finish, [Victoire] Thivisol is nothing short of amazing. This is the kind of portrayal that would be labeled as a standout from an actor of any age, but from someone who's only four, it's astonishing.\"\n\nAwards[]\n\nVenice Film Festival (1996)\n\nFIPRESCI Prize: Jacques Doillon [Winner]\n\nOCIC Award: Jacques Doillon [Winner] (tied with \"The Funeral\")\n\nSergio Trasatti Award: Jacques Doillon [Winner]\n\nVolpi Cup: Victoire Thivisol [Winner]\n\nGolden Lion: Jacques Doillon [Nominated]\n\nSão Paulo International Film Festival (1996)\n\nCritics Award: Jacques Doillon [Winner]\n\nSan Sebastián International Film Festival (1996)\n\nOCIC Award (Honorable Mention): Jacques Doillon [Winner]\n\nNational Board of Review, USA (1997)\n\nNBR Award: Top Foreign Films [Winner]\n\nNew York Film Critics Circle Awards (1997)\n\nBest Foreign Language Film [Winner]\n\nOnline Film & Television Association (1998)\n\nBest Breakthrough Performance (Female): Victoire Thivisol [Winner] (tied with Debbi Morgan for Eve's Bayou)\n\nBest Foreign Language Film [Nominated]\n\nOnline Film Critics Society Awards (1998)\n\nBest Foreign Language Film [Nominated]\n\nSatellite Awards (1998)\n\nBest Motion Picture, Foreign Language: Jacques Doillon [Nominated]\n\nSoutheastern Film Critics Association Awards (1998)\n\nBest Foreign Language Film [Nominated]\n\nYoung Artist Awards (1998)"
