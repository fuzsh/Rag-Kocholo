        "text": "Quentin Tarantino is a unique filmmaker who has his very clear style and approach to his work. Quentin Jerome Tarantino was born in1963 in Tennessee but grew up in California, where his step-father made him love cinema. Tarantino's career as a director began in the mid-1980s when he wrote and directed his first short film My Best Friend's Birthday. His first serious success was the movie Reservoir Dogs released in 1992. The next movie of his, Pulp Fiction, has become a classic one, with such ensemble of actors as John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman, and others. Actually, Tarantino worked closely with Jackson and Thurman: the former appeared in 6 movies of the director (Jackie Brown, Kill Bill, Inglorious Bastards, Django Unchained, and The Hateful Eight), and the latter took part in two projects of Tarantino, but played an important role in his life. Tarantino has got his fame for his amazing feeling of popular culture trends, and his movies usually are a mixture of intriguing storylines, a good amount of martial arts and violence, very charismatic characters, and excellent soundtracks. Quentin Tarantino is considered to be a director who succeeded most in neo-noir movie style frame. He received two Academy Awards (for Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained), two BAFTA and two Golden Globe awards. He has his own movie producing company. Tarantino was in relationships with many actresses and celebrities but was never married."
