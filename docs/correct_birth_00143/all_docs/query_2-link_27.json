        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfessions Actor , Screenwriter , Director more\n\nNationality American\n\nBirth March 27, 1963 (Knoxville, Tennessee – United States)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nQuentin Tarantino spent his youth in a suburb of Los Angeles where his passion for cinema led him to work in a video store. It was during this period that he decided to write his first screenplays, and that he met Roger Avary , with whom he would later write Pulp Fiction .\n\nQuentin Tarantino sold the scripts for True Romance and Natural Killers (adapted in 1993 and 1994) and quickly recovered from the frustration of not having been able to direct them himself by financing, with the money raised, his first film, Reservoir Dogs . He wrote the script and presented it to Harvey Keitel who was so enthusiastic that he played it for free. The film, which quickly gained cult status, established its author as the new star of American independent cinema.\n\nIt was in 1994 that the American directed Pulp Fiction , which quickly became a cult film for millions of movie fans. The filmmaker relaunched John Travolta ‘s career by offering him one of the key roles in the feature film, which won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival and the Oscar for best screenplay. He then filmed Jackie Brown in 1997, adapted from the novel Rum Punch by Elmore Leonard . The film heralds the return to the screen of another star of the 1970s, Pam Grier , who opposite Robert De Niro , and Samuel L. Jackson .\n\nActor in Reservoir Dogs , Desperado and One Night in Hell , Quentin Tarantino returned behind the camera in 2002 after five years of absence for Kill Bill , a revenge story on which he once again directed his favorite actress Uma Thurman . Initially produced as a single film, the work was ultimately separated into two parts, Kill Bill: Volume 1 and Kill Bill: Volume 2 , which were released in theaters six months apart.\n\nAfter filming a sequence of his friend Robert Rodriguez ‘s Sin City in 2005 , Tarantino decided to collaborate with the Texan on a major project. In 2007, Grindhouse was born , a vibrant tribute to genre films of which he directed one of the two segments, the other being directed by Rodriguez . Released as a single program in the United States, with fake trailers between the two films (like a real “Grindhouse” film of the time),Boulevard of Death – a Grindhouse Film by Tarantino is released first, followed by Planet Terror – a Grindhouse Film by Rodriguez .\n\nIn 2009, the Knoxville native finally put on film a project that he had had in mind for a long time, Inglourious Basterds . Taking place during the Second World War, the film revisits History with a Tarantinesque twist. Bringing together Brad Pitt , Diane Kruger , Michael Fassbender , Mélanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz , this new vintage from the Hollywood prodigy receives a fantastic reception and remains one of the greatest successes of “QT” (Nearly 3 million admissions in France) . Christoph Waltz received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his visceral and Homeric performance as SS Colonel Hans Landa.\n\nThe filmmaker then worked on another of his major projects, making a spaghetti western, a genre he particularly likes. This was done in 2012 with Django Unchained , a western set against the backdrop of slavery. Christoph Waltz returns under the direction of Tarantino and the prestigious cast consists of Jamie Foxx , Leonardo DiCaprio in a memorable villain role, Samuel L. Jackson and Kerry Washington . Three years later his new film was released in theaters which is there again… A western (titled The Bad Eight )! For the occasion, the director reunites with several actors he knows well, such as Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Madsen , Kurt Russell and Tim Roth ."
