        "text": "2. Quentin Tarantino was born in Knoxville, Tennessee March 27, 1963. His mother was Connie McHugh and his father was Tony Tarantino, who left him before he was born. He soon moved to California where he spent more time studying movies then he did school. He worked at an adult film theater after dropping out of school, while also taking acting classes. He eventually got a job at the Video Archives in Manhattan Beach California.\n\n3. While working at the Video Archives Tarantino wrote two movie scripts, “Natural Born Killers” and “True Romance”. After leaving the Video Archives he got a job working for a production company called Cinetel. There he was able to get his script for “True Romance” to Director Tony Scott, who bought it. Then Oliver Stone showed interest and bought the script to “Natural Born Killers”.\n\n4. In 1992 Quentin Tarantino releases his written anddirected independent film, “Reservoir Dogs” at the Sundance Film Festival. It was thought of as one of the best independent films of all time. When Tarantino was able to get the script to actor Harvey Keitel, he came aboard as actor and producer of the film. “Reservoir Dogs” was a success in America and overseas, building a huge buzz around the new Writer/Director.\n\n5. Two years later in 1994, premiering at the Cannes Film Festival, “Pulp Fiction” won the Palme d’Or award. Then, after being nominated for 7 Academy Awards, Tarantino took home the award for Best Screenplay. The success for the film was not only with the critics, but also financially as it earned over $108 million in the box office.\n\n6. In 1996 Quentin Tarantino collaborated with Directed Robert Rodriguez on the film “From Dusk Till Dawn”. Tarantino wrote the screenplay and also co-starred in the movie with George Clooney.\n\n7. In 1997 Quentin Tarantino took on Directing the film “Jackie Brown” which was an adaption of the Elmore Leonard Novel. Despite some criticism for overusing the derogatory word for African-Americans, the film was embraced as being a classic and recognized as a more mature film for him. It was a star studded cast with performances that were thought of as being spectacular all around.\n\n8. After taking a break from film making, Tarantino came back to make the two “Kill Bill” martial- arts revenge films, which were an Idea him and Uma Thurman came up with while filming “Pulp Fiction”. The film was originally meant to be a single film, but was split into two due to the thinking that it was too much to be contained in one film. This decision paid off, as they earned a combined $130 million.\n\n9. After “Kill Bill”, Tarantino teamed back up with Director and friend, Robert Rodriguez to help Direct the Comic book adaption “Sin City”, which was his first attempt at digital filmmaking. The duo collaborated again right after to make a double feature called “Grindhouse”, which consisted of “Death Proof”, Directed by Quentin Tarantino and “Planet Terror”, Directed by Robert Rodriguez. This was a tribute to the 1970’s double feature films that were seen in theaters, but it ended up flopping in the box office.\n\n10. After years of working on his World War II script, which he started before “Kill Bill”, Tarantino finally released the film “Inglorious Bastards” in 2009. The film got mixed reviews and received some criticism but ended up getting nominated for 8 Academy Awards.\n\n11. In 2012 Quentin Tarantino released “Django Unchained”, a Western film which is his highest grossing film to date. It was another international box office hit receiving an Academy Award for Best Screenplay and had several other Oscar nominations.\n\n12. Quentin Tarantino has established himself as a revolutionary Screenwriter/Director with a style that sets him apart from other filmmakers. You can recognize his signature style in films when you see shots directed towards or following feet, cameras shooting out of briefcases or up towards the cast, and Samuel L. Jackson playing a badass. Revenge also seems to be a big thing to him where most violence is used as redemption. Here’s a clip showing how he likes to focus on feet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8Nxp3G7mj8"
