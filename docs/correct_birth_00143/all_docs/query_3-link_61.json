        "text": "So I know you all were probably expecting to read about the 1967 classic Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, but there’s been a change of plans. I will get to Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner later in the day, but there’s some more time-senstive material to cover first. Today, my friends, is the fiftieth birthday of the one, the only, Quentin Tarantino.\n\nI’m kind of at a disadvantage here, but it’s not as huge as the disadvantage I had with Alfred Hitchcock day or Global James Bond day. At least I knew about this a couple days in advance instead of day of. I am a relative newcomer to Tarantino’s films, but I have really enjoyed all of them so far (at least in retrospect). I’m looking forward to seeing the rest of his films, I’m over halfway there. I plan of watching Kill Bill Vol I tonight to celebrate! (for the first time) But before then, I figure I have to get something up on the blog, so here’s what I’m gonna do. I wanted to do something involving the number 50, but sadly 50 is a really big number. So since I’ve seen five Tarantino films so far, I’m going to state my two favorite scenes from each film. That gives a total of ten scenes, multiply that by five movies and you have the number 50! Now of course that’s really convoluted and not even true, but whatever. I have to justify it somehow even if it doesn’t make sense.\n\nDjango Unchained\n\nMy favorite scene in Django Unchained has to be the KKK scene where nobody can see out of their masks. First of all, who doesn’t love the fact that it makes fun of the KKK, an organization that I personally don’t like and I’m sure most people don’t either. Second of all, that’s a valid point. How can they see out of those things? Third of all, it’s hilarous, providing some of the best lines in the film. The part where the guy whose wife made the masks leaves because he gets all offended… priceless. Fourth of all, it allows Django and Schultz to get away (if I remember correctly, it’s been awhile).\n\nMy second favorite scene in Django Unchained is probably when we are first introduced to Schultz. Schultz is the best character in the film and his introduction scene definitely reflects this. He’s very polite, but still kills all the evil white guys in sight. Best of all, he becomes friends (or at least starts to) with Django and I must admit I found their relationship pretty touching.\n\nInglourious Basterds\n\nMy favorite part of Ingourious Basterds is way longer than one scene, but it is all continuous. I’ll just talk about the first part though so as to keep to the format. Once Michael Fassbender gets introduced the film gets exponentially better in my opinion. That scene where he first comes in is probably one of the funniest things I have ever seen in my life. They are standing so ludicriously far apart that I can’t stand it! (ha ha!) I don’t even know why I find that funny, but I crack up any time it happens. Also their accents are hilarious. They talk about film history, alway fun, and it was pretty timely for me because when I was watching this for the first time we had just watched Pandora’s Box in film class, directed by GW Pabst who is mentioned in this scene. There’s also a Great Escape reference, always appreciated.\n\n“That’s a bingo!” Ha ha! This scene was also very funny and since I liked Hans Landa more than Aldo Raine I was pretty happy with what happened here (of course until the very end came!!). At first I thought Landa was going to be really evil and turn them in, but then he decided to save himself! As he should, because he’s awesome.\n\nJackie Brown\n\nMy favorite scene has to be the part towards the beginning when Jackie steal Max’s gun and threatens Ordell with it. I didn’t really like Ordell, and with good reason because he was the villain and all, but I was also really anxious as to how Jackie would deal with him. In this scene she shows how she can go up against this guy and probably live to tell the tale.\n\nThe part where Max goes and buys the Delfonics tape. Jackie introduced him to music she likes and now he’s buying some to listen to in his car. It’s just about the cutest thing ever.\n\nPulp Fiction\n\nThe best part of Pulp Fiction for me is undeniably the end. Jules is redeemed and stops an armed robbery; very very good times. It’s probably the weightiest moment in all of Tarantino’s filmography, and provides a much needed happy ending to all of the messed up depressing stuff that came previously. “Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I’m in a transitional period so I don’t wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can’t give you this case, it don’t belong to me. Besides, I’ve already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.” Then they just walk out like it’s no big deal. One of the best endings ever.\n\nOther than that I really love the part towards the end where Jules and Vincent are cleaning the car. So hilarious. “Well, I’m a mushroom-cloud-layin’ motherfucker, motherfucker! Every time my fingers touch brain, I’m Superfly T.N.T., I’m the Guns of the Navarone! IN FACT, WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOIN’ IN THE BACK? YOU’RE THE MOTHERFUCKER WHO SHOULD BE ON BRAIN DETAIL! We’re fuckin’ switchin’! I’m washin’ the windows, and you’re pickin’ up this nigger’s skull!” This deteriorated into quoting pretty darn quick, but that’s not a problem. I actually wish I could chose the entire last third of this movie, but ah well. Bound by the format.\n\nReservoir Dogs\n\nClearly the best part in this movie (and this is a major SPOILER if you haven’t seen it) is when Mr. Orange shoots Mr. Blond. Mr. Blond’s a crazy psychopath trying to kill everybody while dancing to the “super sounds of the seventies”, and Mr. Orange puts a stop to it once and for all. Heroism! It’s a surprise, because up until this point you think he’s a criminal, but then he reveals himself to be a good guy giving you somebody to root for.\n\nThe second best part in this film is the scene where they hand out the color code names. It’s so funny how childish they all are about it: “Why am I Mr. Pink?” Also they skipped over my favorite color, green, and I love how mad that makes me. They should have had a Mr. Green people, come on!\n\nSo there are my favorite two scenes from the five movies of his I’ve seen. I hope everybody has a great day, not least of all Mr. Tarantino who is turning fifty! I feel like we shouldn’t have to go to work or school or anything today; just hang around and watch Tarantino films, but unfortunately that is not the case! I hope everybody gets to see at least a movie of his today. Feel free to share your favorite Tarantino scenes and/or quotes in the comments! Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner will be coming around four in the afternoon, stay tuned!\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY, QUENTIN TARANTINO!!!"
