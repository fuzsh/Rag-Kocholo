        "text": "thicks@bayareanewsgroup.com\n\nAs more police unions call for boycotts against Quentin Tarantino films, supporters of the “Pulp Fiction” director rally around him, according to Reuters.\n\nTarantino attended a rally against police brutality last weekend in New York City, where he called some police officers “murderers” during a speech. At least one police union in New York City asked people to boycott the Oscar winner”s movies. Police unions in Philadelphia and Los Angeles this week joined the boycott.\n\nCarl Dix, a co-founder of Rise Up October and one of the rally”s organizers, said the actions against Tarantino are aimed at “anyone whose voice carries great weight in society: if you speak out, we will come after you, threaten your livelihood and attempt to scare you back into silence.”\n\n“They want the people who suffer the brunt of this brutality alone and ignored. This is unacceptable.”\n\nJazz musician Arturo O”Farrill released a statement supporting Tarantino, in which he said the United States is “a free nation in which an artist, or any citizen, (is) allowed to speak their mind without fear of retribution,” according to Reuters.\n\nJohn McNesby, who leads the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5, said Tarantino”s movies project “violence and respect for criminals; it turns out he also hates cops.”\n\nTo be fair, lots and lots of criminals also get killed in Quentin Tarantino movies. Lots of all kinds of people die in Tarantino movies.\n\nTarantino hasn”t commented on the boycotts.\n\nAt Saturday”s rally, the director told the crowd, “When I see murder, I cannot stand by, and I have to call the murdered the murdered, and I have to call the murderers the murderers,”\n\nTarantino, whose violent, anti-slavery film “Django Unchained” was nominated for five Oscars in 2013, releases his next movie “The Hateful Eight” Dec. 25.\n\nTony Hicks writes celebrity commentary for the Bay Area News Group.
