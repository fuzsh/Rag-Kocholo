        "text": "Cop-hating director Quentin Tarantino has blue blood — three of his relatives served in the NYPD, including one who was shot in the line of duty, The Post has learned.\n\nThe Hollywood heavyweight infuriated New York’s Finest — including Commissioner Bill Bratton — when he branded police officers “murderers” during a protest four days after a cop was killed in the line of duty.\n\nOn Friday, Tarantino’s own father said his son’s comments were “dead wrong” — especially since three of his cousins wore the badge with pride.\n\n“When I read what my son said, it upset me. [We] have three cousins from the NYPD. I’ve seen and heard the things they go through, and to see them so discredited like this is really sad,” Tony Tarantino told The Post.\n\n“The police getting such a bad rap, especially coming from my own son, is really sickening to me. It would really be great if he issued a public apology for the statements he made.”\n\nThe “Pulp Fiction” and “Kill Bill” director’s police lineage includes Anthony Massaro, a retired NYPD lieutenant who served from 1991 to 2013 and retired as a precinct commander in the 9th Precinct in the East Village.\n\nMassaro said he has never met his famous cousin — and has no desire to after his inflammatory remarks in the days following the murder of Officer Randolph Holder.\n\n“I totally disagree with everything he said,” Massaro explained. “And I thought the timing of the whole thing was horrible. The men and women of the NYPD do a phenomenal job and don’t get enough credit.”\n\nMassaro also described how officers don’t need to take heat from celebrities like his cousin because they already have to deal with added pressures from the anti-police sentiment that has swept across the nation.\n\n“Whenever someone says something like [what Quentin said], it makes police officers’ jobs a lot harder,” he said. “It’s much more dangerous today than in my time. You hear about shootings constantly. It’s gotten very bad for police officers to do their job. And my heart goes out to them.”\n\nMassaro, who went on to become a senior compliance officer at JPMorgan Chase, says it was his father, John B. Massaro, who inspired him to join the force.\n\nThe 86-year-old Long Islander died in 2010 and had been a lieutenant assigned to the NYPD Mounted Unit. He wore a badge from 1951 to 1972 and was also a proud Army veteran who heroically stormed the beaches of Normandy in World War II, according to his obituary in Newsday.\n\nFrank Gucciardo, another retired police officer in the Tarantino clan, was shot on patrol in the Big Apple, the director’s dad said — though details of that incident were not immediately available.\n\nGucciardo, now in his 80s and living in Florida, could not be reached for comment.\n\nTony Tarantino said he has no ill feelings toward his kid but thinks he it totally out of line expressing his anti-cop sentiment.\n\n“I love my son and have great respect for him as an artist, but he is dead wrong in calling police officers, particularly in New York City where I grew up, murderers,” Tony Tarantino wrote in a statement to the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association.\n\n“I wish he would take a hard, dispassionate look at the facts before jumping to conclusions and making these kinds of hurtful mistakes that dishonor an honorable profession.”\n\nPolice across the country — including the Los Angeles and Philadelphia departments — called for a boycott of his films after Tarantino branded cops “murders” on Saturday while addressing a crowd of protesters in Washington Square Park.\n\nHe made the incendiary remarks while standing at a podium adorned with the words, “RISE UP! STOP POLICE TERROR!”\n\n“I’m just disappointed in [Quentin] and anyone who comes down against any police department anywhere,” his dad said.\n\n“If anyone breaks the law, they should be tried and prosecuted. But don’t go out in public and call them murderers and killers. Yes, there have been police officers guilty of crimes, but you can’t condemn a whole department just because of a few bad apples.”\n\nThe “Django Unchained” auteur didn’t return calls for comment.\n\nThe 52-year-old director has targeted police in his movies — including the 1992 film “Reservoir Dogs,” in which a cop is tortured, mutilated and killed.\n\n“Quentin is a phenomenal talent, a filmmaking genius,” his dad said. “I can still respect his art. It just upsets me that he went into this so blindly. He looked at only one side of the issue, and he didn’t look at the other side.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Kirstan Conley"
