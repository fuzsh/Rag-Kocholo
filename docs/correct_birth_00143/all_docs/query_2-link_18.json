And the supreme court justice that should be looked at is Antonin Scalia who has been on the supreme court since September 26th, 1986. Mr. Scalia was born in Trenton New Jersey on March 11th, 1936 being the only child to Salvadore Eugene and Catherine Panaro Scalia. His father was a Sicilian immigrant who came to america as a teenager, and his mother was a first generation italian-american. Mr. Scalia grew up in the Queens as an only child (which is uncommon among Italian-Catholics).\n\nTarantino's Impact On Culture\n\n870 Words | 4 Pages\n\n' It 's interesting to see how much Tarantino resamples from different genre movies into his own movies. We all know that Tarantino is a cinephile and a movie nerd. It would be important to start from his use of music in his stylistic titles sequences or opening sequence of every film. All his movies from 'Reservoir Dogs ' to 'Hateful Eight ' have very peculiar audio-visual styles for the opening sequences.\n\nCrunk Feminist Collection: Tyler Perry\n\n129 Words | 1 Pages\n\nI think he enjoys creating projects such as “Diary of A Mad Black Women” because those type of actions is taking place in today’s generation.

But the idea of cinema as a potent and dynamic art\n\nRhetorical Analysis: The Wolf Of Wall Street\n\n1011 Words | 5 Pages\n\nThe film’s ethos, pathos, and logos all contribute to persuasion, as the poster forces a determination regarding interest in the upcoming film. I will discuss the poster for The Wolf of Wall Street and how it uses each rhetorical device as a means to establish the tone and setting for the film. A film’s ethos focuses on certain actors, directors, and production companies with loyal fanbases. An actor, such as Leonardo DiCaprio, has the ability to drive up a film’s success at the box office, simply by attaching his name to the poster.\n\nMichelangelo's Influence On Renaissance Society\n\n150 Words | 1 Pages\n\nMichelangelo has been regarded as one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance time period and a famous figure for artists in modern day. He was a sculptor, painter, and architect widely known to humanity. Not only did Michelangelo excel in his artistic expertise, he also became strongly influential to Renaissance society. Michelangelo, formally known as Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni, was born on March 6, 1475 in Caprese, Italy, and then moved to Florence. Despite the fact that he was born in Caprese, Michelangelo regards Florence as his hometown because of the lively, artistic locales that sparked his interests.\n\nQuentin Tarantino's Use Of Ultra-Violence In Neo-Noir Films\n\n466 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThe use of ultra-violence in films is a common thing in modern films and it is mostly used as an attraction to make a film action packed. In neo-noir films, however, the use of ultra-violence signifies a deeper meaning. It is used to portray a very surreal environment in which we live in. The violence in films such as Kill Bill by Quentin Tarantino might seem excessive to most, but it only serves to illustrate just how horrifying the reality can be in patriarchal hierarchical societies ruled by a single “god”. In this essay, I will discuss how the attempted murder of The Bride by Bill, the rape of The Bride by the male nurse in the hospital, and the rape and murder of O-Ren Ishii’s mother by Boss Tanaka shows how Tarantino wants us to understand how women are treated by men in the traditional realist world.\n\nResearch Paper On Spike Lee\n\n1379 Words | 6 Pages\n\nPerhaps arguably one of the most influential and controversial directors in American Cinema History, Spike Lee's filmography has become woven into the fabric of urban cinema. Like fellow directors such as Martin Scorsese and sometimes rival Quentin Tarantino, Lee's unique style of cinematography has both transcended and placed emphasis on appreciation for his respective cultural aesthetic. Many urban directors can attest that their respective styles in film and even music videos all come from or are inspired by Spike Lee. Aside from his ever creative filmography, it can be said that Lee's personal perspective shines most in his documentary work. Known generally to be outspoken, Lee's documentary work has historically touched on socio-political\n\nSteven Spielberg Impact\n\n1021 Words | 5 Pages\n\n“The most amazing thing for me is that every single person who sees a movie, not necessarily one of my movies, brings a whole set of unique experiences. Now, through careful manipulation and good storytelling, you can get everybody to clap at the same time, to hopefully laugh at the same time, and to be afraid at the same time” (“Steven Spielberg Quotes”). As the inspiration for how many films are produced, Steven Spielberg is a director, producer, and writer. Having won 3 Academy Awards, several of his movies have set box office records, including Jaws and E.T. the Extra Terrestrial.
