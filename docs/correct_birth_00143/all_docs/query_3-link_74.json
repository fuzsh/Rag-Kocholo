        "text": "Quentin Tarantino shares two children with his wife\n\nQuentin Tarantino and Daniella Tarantino fell in love, took a break and eventually found their way back to each other.\n\nThe pair first met in her home country of Israel in 2009 when he was promoting one of his projects. Quentin and Daniella came from the same worlds, both working in film — she is an actress and a model while he is famous for directing some of Hollywood's most iconic movies.\n\nDespite initially hitting it off and starting a relationship, Quentin and Daniella ended their relationship a few years in. Later, around 2016, the couple reunited and got engaged during the summer of the following year.\n\nQuentin and Daniella married in November 2018 and have welcomed two children together — their son Leo arrived in 2020 and their daughter was born two years later.\n\nSo, who is Quentin Tarantino's wife? Here is everything to know about Daniella Tarantino and her relationship with the director.\n\nShe followed in her father's musical footsteps\n\nDaniella has music in her blood. Her father, Svika Pick, was an Israeli pop star known as the \"The Maestro.\" He was especially popular in the 1970s and became a television personality in Israel years later.\n\nThe model and her sister, Sharona, followed in their father's footsteps and performed as a duo called the \"Pick Sisters.\" The siblings sang their original song \"Hello, Hello\" at the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest. Daniella later pursued a solo career and released songs including \"More or Less\" and \"Love Me.\"\n\nShe appeared in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\n\nAlthough Daniella is primarily known for her singing, she did have a minor role as Daphna Ben-Cobo in her husband's Golden Globe-winning 2019 film, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. She also appeared on the Israeli reality show Goalstar and was a guest on the talk show Exit.\n\n\"When Quentin shoots a movie, it's a big deal,\" Daniella told The Jerusalem Post in 2019. \"Obviously, I take an active part in it, and [it influences] all the atmosphere at home. It's a very intensive half a year and every day is very important.\"\n\nShe continued, explaining her pride for Quentin, \"It's like being with someone who is training for the Olympics, or as Quentin always says, it's like climbing Everest. Quentin is a champion at that. He is so charming, caring and professional. He makes everyone feel great on the set. It made me feel really proud to see that.\"\n\nShe met Quentin while he was promoting a film\n\nQuentin and Daniella met for the first time in her home country of Israel when the director was visiting to promote Inglourious Basterds, the award-winning 2009 film he both wrote and directed. They started a relationship shortly after crossing paths for the first time.\n\nIn September of the same year, Quentin and Daniella made their red carpet debut at the premiere of Drew Barrymore's roller derby film, Whip It.\n\nShe married Quentin at their home\n\nAfter Quentin proposed in 2017, the couple threw an engagement party that acted as an impromptu Pulp Fiction reunion, with guests including Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman.\n\nThe following year, in November, Quentin and Daniella got married in an intimate ceremony at their Los Angeles home. He wore a black suit, while she paired her tiara and veil with a sweetheart neckline gown.\n\nShe shares two children with Quentin\n\nQuentin and Daniella welcomed their son Leo on Feb. 22, 2020. The couple expanded their family again with the birth of their daughter on July 2, 2022. Quentin explained on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in 2021 that their firstborn was named after Daniella's grandfather.\n\n\"We almost didn't name him that because people would assume I named him after Leonardo DiCaprio,\" he explained, as he worked with the famous actor on Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood and Django Unchained. \"There's nothing wrong with that, but ... he's named after my wife's grandfather, but also because, just in our hearts, he was our little lion.\"\n\nShe and Quentin are homebodies\n\nDaniella has shared that she and Quentin love spending a night in. \"We are very family-oriented,\" she told The Jerusalem Post. \"We love to be at home, to go out to dinner [and] to watch movies, both at home and at theaters.\"\n\nThe couple also enjoy cooking and inviting friends over. \"Quentin really loves my cooking and I make things that I know from home and also new things,\" she added.\n\nDaniella continued, explaining more about their dynamic as a pair. \"We spend a lot of time during the day together, laughing, talking. He's a gentleman, romantic, funny and a hunk,\" she said. \"He's a genius and an incredible husband.\"\n\nShe and Quentin split their time between Israel and the United States\n\nQuentin shared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that the couple had begun to split their time between Tel Aviv and L.A. right before the COVID-19 pandemic began. Because of the lockdowns and travel restrictions, he and Daniella spent more time in the Israeli city than they had anticipated. \"Three to four months became nine to 12 months,\" he explained.\n\nThe acclaimed director took the opportunity to learn Hebrew. \"I've learned a lot of words,\" Quentin said. \"I'm actually learning a lot with Leo, because he watches these baby TV kind of things and it's all in Hebrew. So I'm learning with him.\"\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
