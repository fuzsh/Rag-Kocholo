        "text": "Quentin Tarantino isn’t just used to courting controversy – he revels in it.\n\nSince first exploding on to the scene in 1992 with Reservoir Dogs, a savagely violent, profane and hilarious crime comedy, the film-maker has never shied away from the issues his critics find unsettling.\n\nBacking down is not his style. Eleven years on from the controversy over the violence in Reservoir Dogs, the film-maker released Kill Bill, which included a sequence so bloody it had to be shown in black and white in the US to get past the censors.\n\nNow, one month from the US release of his film The Hateful Eight, Tarantino is embroiled in another row – but this time it’s not over the violence of his films, or his insistence, to the disquiet of some critics, on tackling subjects such as slavery in his trademark hip, bravura – and some would say flippant – style.\n\nLate last month, Tarantino, who hails from Knoxville, Tennessee, flew to New York to join three days of protests organised by Rise Up October, a group opposed to police violence and what it calls a “genocidal assault on black and Latino people in this country”. Speaking to families of police brutality victims, Tarantino was quoted as saying: “I’m here to say I’m on the side of the murdered.”\n\nNew York’s largest police union responded to Tarantino’s participation and use of the word “murdered” by urging a boycott of his films.\n\n“It’s no surprise that someone who makes a living glorifying crime and violence is a cop-hater, too,” Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, said in a statement. “New Yorkers need to send a message to this purveyor of degeneracy that he has no business coming to our city to peddle his slanderous Cop Fiction.”\n\nLynch’s vitriolic response made headlines worldwide, causing a number of other US police unions to join in the call for a boycott. Fox News stalwart Bill O’Reilly went so far as to say that Tarantino had “ruined his career” by joining the protest.\n\nOn Thursday, the Fraternal Order of Police appeared to threaten Tarantino with a “surprise”, telling the Hollywood Reporter: “Something is in the works, but the element of surprise is the most important element ... The right time and place will come up and we’ll try to hurt him in the only way that seems to matter to him, and that’s economically.”\n\n“Hollywood personalities often get into politics, and they have every right to do so and express their views – but it’s a double-edged sword,” says Anne Thompson, editor-at-large of Indiewire, who first met Tarantino at the Cannes film festival when Pulp Fiction had its world premiere, and has interviewed him many times since. “Whenever a public figure who’s an artist gets into this arena, you can get bit.”\n\nHowever, the film-maker swiftly scotched rumours that he was going to offer an apology. “All cops are not murderers,” he clarified to the Los Angeles Times. “I never said that. I never even implied that.”\n\n“The people who are screaming against me are the mouthpieces for the police,” he added. “They can call for a boycott. That doesn’t mean that cops are going to respond.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Tarantino appeared on MSNBC to again defend his actions, saying: “Just because I was at an anti-police brutality protest doesn’t mean I’m anti-police.” He also went further, saying that there was “white supremacy” tainting America.\n\nIt’s the latest in a number of controversies that prove that the 52-year-old director, who has won two Oscars, has not mellowed with age. A week before his participation in the protest, Tarantino was criticised for saying in a New York Times profile by American Psycho writer Bret Easton Ellis that Ava DuVernay’s Oscar-nominated Martin Luther King Jr biopic Selma “deserved an Emmy” – in other words, that it looked made for TV.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Tarantino simply clarified that he had in fact not seen the film, but that judging by its promotional material, it looked “like a 70s TV movie”.\n\nIn that same interview, the film-maker hit out at “critics in black culture” who object to his frequent use of the N-word in his scripts. “When the black critics came out with savage think pieces about Django, I couldn’t have cared less,” he told Easton Ellis, referring to his 2012 western about slavery, Django Unchained. “If people don’t like my movies, they don’t like my movies, and if they don’t get it, it doesn’t matter.”\n\nIn a world where film-makers are often reluctant to criticise one another’s work, Tarantino can be gleefully outspoken. This summer in an interview with Vulture, conducted before Wes Craven’s death, Tarantino criticised the horror master’s direction of Scream, arguing that the director’s approach “kept it earthbound and stopped it from going to the moon”.\n\nTarantino also admitted to skipping the second season of True Detective because it looked “just awful” – not an unusual judgment, but one perhaps less frequently expressed in the upper echelons of the entertainment industry.\n\nTarantino’s forthright nature can be divisive, even among his supporters. Carl Dix, one of the activists responsible for Rise Up October, says that he doesn’t like Tarantino’s use of the N-word in Django Unchained, but is otherwise in favour of the film.\n\nAsked if he was wary of having a contentious figure like Tarantino be the lead celebrity in the rally, Dix says: “To me the question wasn’t do I agree with everything he does in his art, but where does he stand in relation to police being allowed to get away with brutality and murder? That was the question. If he was willing to take a stand on that – then let’s do it together. That’s what Rise Up was about.”\n\nIn Hollywood, directors such as Tarantino are rare: he’s an arthouse auteur working within the studio system, whose films perform like blockbusters despite being wholly original properties – and R-rated. A film about slavery mired in controversy, Django Unchained nevertheless grossed over $162m in the US alone.\n\nInglourious Basterds (2009) also tackled uncomfortable, even trangressive subject matter – it was a revenge flick in which a group of Jewish-American soldiers attempt to assassinate top-ranking Nazis – but it too was a superhero-sized hit, making over $120m in the US.\n\nCompared with his previous work, Tarantino’s upcoming film, The Hateful Eight, a spaghetti western about a bunch of outlaws holed up in a cabin during a severe snowstorm, seems positively restrained. The trailer hints at a period Reservoir Dogs retread, made on a much higher budget and boasting bigger stars.\n\nIn the 20-plus years he’s been writing and directing, Tarantino has only completed eight films. When a new Tarantino film hits cinemas, it’s an event; the one exception being Death Proof (2007), Tarantino’s Grindhouse experiment with Robert Rodriguez, which flopped.\n\nThanks to Tarantino’s unquestionable popularity, Thompson doesn’t believe the recent controversy circling him will affect The Hateful Eight’s box office performance.\n\n“His movies perform a feat that’s hard to match which is they’re both art and commerce,” says Thompson. “He surprises with these idiosyncratic worlds that he creates, packed with dialogue and crazy violent characters, wowing audiences over and over again.\n\n“I doubt very much that this will have a major impact on attendance. It’s really going to come down to whether the movie is any good.”\n\nIt is doubtful whether boycotts of films work as protesters intend; indeed, they often serve as good publicity for the film in question. In 1992, LGBT activists called for viewers to stay away from Basic Instinct, claiming that it depicted gay characters in a negative light. The film grossed $352m, one of the most successful of the 90s.\n\nEarlier this month, racist Twitter users called for fans to stay away from cinemas showing Star Wars: The Force Awakens because director JJ Abrams had cast a black actor, John Boyega, as one of the leads – but the film is tipped to be among the highest-grossing films of all time when it hits cinemas in December.\n\nTarantino also has Hollywood’s support. Second only to Martin Scorsese, Tarantino is the film-maker members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who vote annually on the Oscars, revere most – and his recent behaviour won’t lessen their adulation.\n\nWhile few of Tarantino’s actors have publicly defended his recent actions (a few declined to comment for this article), Jamie Foxx, star of Django Unchained, offered his support. Speaking at the Hollywood Film Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, Foxx said the director should “keep speaking the truth and don’t worry about none of the haters”.\n\nHe’s also been backed by numerous others on Rise Up’s website, including actor Peter Coyote, who offered his support saying: “Good for Quentin Tarantino. Shame on those who do NOT speak.”\n\nIndeed, since he single-handedly resurrected John Travolta’s career with Pulp Fiction, actors have clamoured to work with Tarantino; Ryan Reynolds called him his “dream director”. He gave Pam Grier her first major role since the 70s in Jackie Brown, and helped to elevate the profiles of Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman and Christoph Waltz, who netted two Oscars from his work with the director.\n\nMost importantly, Harvey Weinstein, Tarantino’s longtime producer and the man responsible for financing his films, has also offered tacit support. In a statement released on Tuesday, the Weinstein Company said: “We don’t speak for Quentin; he can and should be allowed to speak for himself.”\n\nMoreover, the statistics about police violence lend weight to Tarantino’s argument. According to the Guardian’s growing database, The Counted, more than 930 people have been killed by police in the US so far this year, of whom 436 were white, 226 black and 143 Latino.\n\nDix says that despite the backlash to Tarantino’s comments, he thinks the film-maker’s participation in Rise Up October was “definitely beneficial” to their movement.\n\n“What he said made it into the news, and Rise Up October got heard about by people who were unaware of the demonstration,” Dix says. “He took a very principled stand: he said what he felt, and what he felt was true.”"
