        "text": "On today’s episode of The Literary Life, Mitchell Kaplan is joined by Quentin Tarantino to discuss his first work of nonfiction, Cinema Speculation, out now from Harper.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nFrom the episode:\n\nQuentin Tarantino: SWhat I didn’t expect to happen in the book, but just sort of happened by happenstance, is I didn’t expect to have moments of actual film history reportage in there, and that ended up happening in some of the pieces. One, because I just know a lot of Hollywood lore. I know a verbal history of how this came about and that came about. And writing that in my own words, you know, became a fun little history lesson.\n\nBut then, you know, I didn’t know what I was going to get when I called up Walter Hill to ask him about some of the experiences of making The Getaway. Well, he ended up having to think, well, of course, he had this incredible amount of knowledge. It was a big, important part of his life, and he was involved at every step of the way.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nSo he gave me such an efficient verbal history of exactly what was going down during the making of that movie, that it became one of my favorite pieces. And I was like, okay, I don’t want to do every piece like this, but this is a really interesting way to go about some of that. It was a great way of doing it.\n\n________________________________\n\nSubscribe now to The Literary Life with Mitchell Kaplan on iTunes, Spotify, or wherever else you find your podcasts!\n\nQuentin Tarantino was born in 1963 in Knoxville, Tennessee.
