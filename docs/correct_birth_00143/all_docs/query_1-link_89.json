        "text": "About The Book\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s films have single-handedly revived and redefined American cinema, bringing to Hollywood a new energy, irony, and cool. Natural Born Killers is a disturbing and brilliant indictment of violence in the media and American celebrity culture. Mickey and Mallory Knox, outlaw lovers on the run, go on a killing spree of startling viciousness—and find themselves transformed into cult celebrities by the tabloid media.\n\nThe film, directed by Oliver Stone, departed signficantly from Tarantino’s original screenplay, so much so that Tarantino removed his name from the screenplay credits. Now available in America for the first time, the original screenplay offers fans and film buffs of all stripes the opportunity to compare Tarantino’s original vision with Stone’s version of the story of Mickey and Mallory."
