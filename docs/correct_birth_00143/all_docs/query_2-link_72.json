        "text": "January 9, 2024\n\nSadly for this book, I've been reading Quentin by Tarantino by Amazing Améziane at the same time, and this book pales desperately by comparison.\n\nThe biographical part is underrepresented, only a couple of Tarantino's movies are looked at on a surface level and the dialogue is terrible, which seems ironic for a book about someone who is famed for his dialogue.\n\nNobody speaks like actual human beings do, it's all there to name actors and movies to push some facts on the reader. If only the writing really leaned into the artificiality, that could've been something.\n\nThe art isn't very good either - if you're featuring actors and actresses, you better get some form of likeness going. I'm not talking photorealistic, but a cartoony version. There are drawings in here of Margot Robbie that look like everyone but Margot Robbie.\n\nEventhough they're wildly different books, spend your money on Quentin by Tarantino.\n\n(Picked up a review copy through Edelweiss)\n\nJanuary 5, 2024\n\nQuentin Tarantino: A Graphic Biography\n\nby Michele Botton\n\nMy husband made me watch pretty much every Tarantino film existing. Some I even enjoyed a lot. So I thought, why not requesting this book and giving it a try.\n\nThis year I wanted to read - at least a bit- out of my comfort zone. Graphic novels are pretty much out of my comfort zone. Very much so.\n\nThe drawings were not really my style, but I found them fitting for Tarantino. It’s like out of one of his movies. They were really basic and kind of clunky. Dark colors and not much fun. I don’t know why I wanted fun, but I didn’t get any.\n\nThe bits about his childhood were the best part, but yeah, it was fine.\n\nThis is maybe so my erging for due hard fans, for me, not so much.\n\nFor someone who knows owns basically nothing about Tarantino, I felt like a fish out of water. I got. Whole lot of context but. It much explanations.\n\nPublication: 05 Mar 2024 by Quarto Publishing Group – White Lion, Frances Lincoln\n\nARC courtesy of NetGalley and the publisher. All opinions are my own.\n\nMarch 12, 2024\n\nI received an advance reader copy of this book to read in exchange for an honest review via netgalley and the publishers.\n\n3.5 Stars.\n\nQuentin Tarantino: A Graphic Biography is an entertaining graphic novel biography featuring snippets of Tarantinos' lives, work, and movies. This has made me want to read a full biography of him now to delve deeper into his career, his movies, and his life and creativity. The illustrations are befitting of Tarantinos style (movie wise) and although it was a quick read it was entertaining and interesting.\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\n2.5/5\n\n- Thank you to the author and the publisher for providing me a copy through NetGalley. -\n\nWhile I did like the idea and the drawings, I honestly hoped for more connection between the various episodes. It looked like it were taken a few \"did you know?\" stories and just assembled together as chapters to make a whole book.\n\nI did expect something different and more biographic, less random and more connected and unfortunately this really wasn't the case.\n\nJanuary 17, 2024\n\nA Graphic Biography is a bit of a misnomer. This graphic novel contained what appeared to be small slices from Quentin Tarantino's life, scenes rather than an information dump about his life. It was still very interesting, I'm watching Death Proof for the first time, and I'm inspired enough to want to watch the movies I have missed over the years that he wrote and directed. This graphic novel hints at what drove him to be the success he is, but doesn't delve too deep. The art style, 70's comic book graphics, suit Tarantino's story, but most of the drawings of the famous people don't look like themselves, you can only figure out who they are when Quentin says their name. The dialogue seems quite bland, but maybe it's how conversations go with him. Still worth a read, it didn't take long at all to complete.\n\nThank you to Netgalley for the opportunity to read and review this book.\n\nJanuary 16, 2024\n\nQuatro Publishing Group/White Lion provided an early galley for review.\n\nI first was introduced to Tarantino when visiting friends for Comic-Con back in 1999. I certainly would not have watched Reservoir Dogs on my own as I do not like ultra-violent films. A few years later, also at SDCC, the same friends and I attended a panel where the man was speaking about his films. I got a real good impression of him from that panel.\n\nWhat is interesting about this graphic novel biography is that is very much mirrors his mannerisms and his film style. Clearly the creators here are both huge fans (why else do a project such as this?). The narrative does a good job presenting basic facts of his life (it is a super-quick read), and the artwork does a good job at capturing the images of the many celebrities scattered throughout. It serves as a fair reflection of his life and his work.\n\nJanuary 27, 2024\n\nI told myself I would be open to reading graphic novels this year. Came across this on NetGalley and got it. I am a fan of Quintin Tarantino and this short bio was perfect! I learned about Quintin’s childhood and how his love of movies influenced his career. I loved the behind the scenes look we got of some of his infamous movies as well. The illustrations were so Tarantino’s style, I thought they were great. Definitely check it out if you are a fan or just want to learn a little more about him.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and Quarto Publishing Group - White Lion for this ARC. My review is voluntarily.\n\nMay 12, 2024\n\n2.5, and pretty much anecdotal, in every possible way.\n\nFirst, this is just a short collection of anecdotes from Tarantino's life an work, with some mention to idols and references, and inspiration for scenes and stories. But it also is just such a short inconsequential book, that it can't have much of an impact on a reader, and it doesn't really do much in terms of being didactical or informative.\n\nThe art wasn't great either, just average, and not always on point when it came to capture some famous actors' resemblances.\n\nBut it was a super super quick read, so no harm done...\n\nJanuary 20, 2024\n\nThanks to #Netgalley for the Arc\n\nI didn't have any other versions to compare this book with, so it was too easy to love this book. I wish it was a bit longer. I was just getting to the groove of the stories before I reached the long page. Loved his banters with actors I grew up watching. It was wonderful to see how he was able to convince everyone with his silly stories. I repeat: the banter was everything..\n\nJanuary 7, 2024\n\nThis was so interesting!! I loved learning all about his life and his childhood and his movies and all. I highly recommend this for anyone who likes his work and even people who don’t know his work would still enjoy reading this. This book might just make some people new fans. I want to rewatch death proof now.\n\nJanuary 27, 2024\n\nA quick read but fantastically entertining! If you like Tarantino films, you will enjoy how this book reflects the pace, style and energy behind Tarantino's work. Great fun and a fab read\n\nThank you NetGalley for the eARC of this book. The review is left voluntarily\n\nJanuary 6, 2024\n\nThis is so bad it is hard to believe. If you are at all hesitating to write a book because you don't think you are talented enough, I assure you that you are more talented than this person.\n\nFebruary 5, 2024\n\nI received an ARC of this from the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.\n\nThis was a very brief, surface level biography of Quentin Tarantino. If you’re just looking for the basics in a quick and fun way, then this is a sure bet. It was easy to read and I thought the dialogue was entertaining.\n\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\nI have also read the graphic biography about Andy Warhol and thought that was a really nice way to learn more about these famous people. When reading this book I discovered I actually haven’t seen that many movies made by Tarantino, however I did see some. It was nice to read about how Tarantino came to the ideas of his movies. I also thought it was cool how the author included famous friends like Pitt, DiCaprio and Thurman in the book. All in all, this was a great way to learn more about the creative soul that is Quentin Tarantino!\n\nJanuary 5, 2024\n\nMy thanks to both NetGalley and the publisher Quarto Publishing Group – White Lion, Frances Lincoln for an advance copy of this new graphic novel biography about the life, influences and films of one the Hollywood's most controversial, and gifted directors.\n\nThere are few directors that people know by name, maybe not by face. Some might go oh yeah they do those inexpensive doll movies, or oh yeah those big robot movies. Alfred Hitchcock was one of the first and best to seize the public fancy, appearing in shows his own movies and ads, his appearance or selling making the plot sometimes irrelevant. Quentin Tarantino also has this notoriety, and like Hitchcock is often imitated, but never really bested. After the double shot of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, many directors came out with quirky ultra-violent movies aping the master, but never capturing what made them. Tarantino was all over tv, talk shows, directing television shows, starring as himself or others. And making a name for himself. What is often missed is the MOVIES are everything Everything is for the movies, the casting, the acting, the writing, nothing else matters. Tarantino loves movies, breathes movies, and will talk till h dies about movies. As shown in Quentin Tarantino: A Graphic Biography written by Michele Botton, illustrated by Bernardo Santiago Acosta, and translated by Edward Forbes.\n\nThe book is told in a non-sequential chronology featuring Quentin in a discussion with a colleague, or friends, discussing aspects about the movie they are working on, or about his life. This is a unique way of presenting the story, as it seems like the way he would write his life. We start with coffee and Uma Thurman during Pulp Fiction, discussing the idea of Kill Bill and his love of strong powerful women and why. We follow a discussion with the cast of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, on where the movie fits in his world, how history can be changed and made. There is a talk with John Travolta about growing up and watching movies, the importance of Elmore Leonard on the young writer and his love for film in general. A love that was furthered by his long stint in the video stores, a film school that paid him.\n\nThis is a short book and much is missed, along with a lot of controversies that are a part of his career now; the Weinstein problem, black culture, his fallout with Uma Thurman. However this is a very good start for someone new to Tarantino's movies, and his work. The writer makes it clear that movies are the oxygen that Tarantino breathes, and his discussions with friends and colleagues show that. OH and there are plenty of feet mentions. The art is a little odd. The women don't seem to have much glamor, Uma and Margot Robbie should be fetching in their panels. The men Brad Pitt and like are very good. Also the backgrounds are quite good too, so that might be a small thing. All in all a very good graphic telling of a very complicated person's life.\n\nMarch 5, 2024\n\nRead on February 17th, 2024. Written on March 5th, 2024.\n\nNEW BOOK RELEASE ALERT!!!\n\nThis one was not what I expected and so much more than I could ask for!\n\nI''m a cinema student, so when I saw the opportunity to read the new Quentin Tarantino biography (bonus point for it being a graphic novel) I was immediately hooked and ready to throw myself into the life of one of Hollywood's most incredible cinematographers. I haven't watched a lot of Quentin movies (criminal!) but the one's I did were an absolute mixture of everything you search for in a fun, crazy and somewhat gore-y experience. And reading this book just opened my eyes even more to the world of \"Written and Directed by Quentin Tarantino\".\n\nIn terms of writing, storyline and the illustrations, everything was amazing. The storyline was a dream for any Pulp Fiction fan (such as myself) for the way it goes back and forth like you hoped it would. The illustrations were so good, giving a comic book vibe to Quentin's life and his stories. And the writing was funny and a learned quite a lot from it.\n\nHonestly, just read this as I am sure any cinema fan will love it.\n\n(Free ARC from NetGalley and Quarto Publishing Group – White Lion, Frances Lincoln that I chose to review after reading)\n\nSigning off,\n\nB.\n\nJanuary 7, 2024\n\nI really loved this book. It was a quick read. I think it’s great when classics or biographies are made into graphic novels. I think it makes literature so much easier to digest for people who aren’t big readers.\n\nI loved that the the characters and actors from his movies helped set up all of Quentin’s backstory. I think this would be a fun addition for any fan on his work.\n\nI love his movies and liked that I got to learn some new things about him in this book. I learned that his mom took him to movies all the time growing up (appropriate or not), that most of his film education came from working in a video store, and I loved the way his violent choices in movies was explained.\n\nJanuary 19, 2024\n\nA Quentin Tarantino biography that doesn't really tell you anything new if you've seen his movies. It's all surface level stuff. Either there are some translation issues or Michele Botton writes really poor dialogue. Maybe it's both. These don't sound like real people. They sound like people written by A.I. software. The art is subpar at best too. A lot of this is Quentin talking to famous people over dinner. The problem being I'd have no idea who they are from the art if the dialogue didn't tell me who they were. They just look like fugly drawn people, not some of the most beautiful people on the planet.\n\nJanuary 19, 2024\n\nThis was such an inventive approach to learning about Quentin Tarantino (his life and his film and writing career) through conversations with others in graphic novel format. It is a quick read and I learned so much about him. I loved his emerging interest in films (thanks to his mom and his time as a video store clerk). This is such a fun and informative read. The graphics are well done too. This is a great book for people who love film, the making of film and Quentin Tarantino.\n\nThank you to Netgalley and Quarto Publishing Group – White Lion for an ARC and I left this review voluntarily.\n\nMarch 22, 2024\n\nBook 049 of 300 ~ 2024\n\n🌟🌟🌟💫\n\nInteresting take on Quentin. Art is not really my cuppa tea but it is befitting for Tarantino as it has the edgy vibe to it.\n\nMore like a snippet of his life and career but enough to intrigue fans to want to find out more.\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.\n\n#book49of300 #amreading #netgalley #tbrpile #instareads #readstagram #reading #bookreview #bookreviewer #booklover #booksAreLife #booksForTheWin #thisbookfairyisreading #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #bookstagramfeature #bookshelf #booksofinstagram #bookish #bookworm #goodreads #booklovers #theSGbookfairyReads #theSGtrekkiereads #bookaholic #bookaddict #bookchallenge2024 #reviews #lovebooks #booknerds\n\nJanuary 8, 2024\n\nThis is a graphic novel, and the pictures had kind of the mood of a Tarantino movie. The way the story was framed was kind of weird and jumped around, with Tarantino talking to the people he worked with in movies about the movies they made together.\n\nI don't feel like I learned anything new, because I have always been interested in Quentin Tarantino. This might be a fun way for people to learn about Tarantino if they weren't familiar with him, but it might be confusing.\n\nThanks to NetGalley for letting me read this\n\nJune 9, 2024\n\nMichele Botton's novel is pure unique and nostalgic. When you tell someone you're reading a biography about Quentin Tarantino, they wouldn't expect it to be in the form of a graphic novel and I'm blessed that Botton decided to go that route with Quentin Tarantino: A Graphic Biography. This novel will definitely light the hearts of Tarantino fans like myself, but this book is full of entertainment, humor, realism, and enlightening scenes that contemporary readers will find enjoyment in reading it as well. This is definitely a strong recommendation for anyone above the age of 17.\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nI hate to give such a low review, but oof. I'm not much of a Tarantino fan, and was hoping this book could enlighten me a bit, but it effectively did the opposite. Lots of \"Tarantino is a-fucking-mazing!!\" type dialogue that felt super overplayed and childish. The dialogue between people had this sitcom-cheesiness to it and made the scenes hard to believe. It's also just a few snippets of his life, rather than a biography. It only took me about half an hour to read.\n\nApril 26, 2024\n\nThank you to NetGalley for providing an ARC for an honest review.\n\n\"Quentin Tarantino: A Graphic Biography\" mirrors the non-linear storytelling of \"Pulp Fiction,\" offering an engaging look into the filmmaker's life. It's a must-read for Tarantino fans, providing insights into his creative process. While the art style is simple, it effectively conveys the biography's essence. Overall, the book offers an accessible and informative journey through the life and work of Quentin Tarantino.\n\nJanuary 4, 2024\n\nDefinitely a fun quick read for fans of Tarantino. The art is bold and covers some of the highlights of his career and movie idea. I don't necessarily think this is for people who know nothing about the director but more so a collectable for die hard fans. I personally wanted a bit more/a deeper exploration but that's subjective.\n\nJanuary 16, 2024\n\nGreat Book On Quentin\n\nVery good read.\n\nI truly enjoyed the great art and interesting look at Quentin's films.\n\nI liked the conversational tone of the book and the behind-the-scenes discussions about his filmmaking and his choice of actors and scriptwriting.\n\nCheck this out if you are a fan of his films!\n\n4.2/5\n\nFebruary 17, 2024\n\nThis book was interesting if you like Quentin Tarantino but only give surface level information about him. We have more information about his movies than really him but it was still entertaining and really easy to read. Moreover the graphics were lovely and the colors used really give the mood of the scene.\n\nThanks to Netgalley for the ARC\n\nMarch 26, 2024\n\nIf you are a fan of Quentin Tarantino, this graphic novel is definitely for you. Personally, I like some of his movies but I don't consider myself a fan. However, the graphic novel is interesting with details about his life before delving into the director who he is now.\n\nThe drawing art for this novel is fine, but it is not memorable or so I believe.\n\nThank u NetGalley and the publisher."
