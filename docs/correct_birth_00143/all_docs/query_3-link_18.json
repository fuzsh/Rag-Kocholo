        "text": "Either an individual grasps Quentin Tarantino’s films, or doesn’t. Those who do understand his movies, relate to his craft of making a daring fusion of thrillers, neo-noir, and non-linear films. Those who do not apprehend his films, pass them off as mere art-house cinema material. Nonetheless, Quentin Tarantino has grown to become one of the biggest names in Hollywood. Not only has he managed to gather a cult following for his films, he, unlike his previous generation of filmmakers, has understood in entirety, what ‘kind’ of films get the audiences flocking to cinema halls. From the famous Pulp Fiction to Inglorious Basterds and Reservoir Dogs to Natural Born Killers, he has come a long way from working in a video rental store to one of the most legendary director-screenwriters of all time. Through most part of his life, he juggled as the multifaceted actor, director, screenwriter and producer and in the latter part of his life, decided to stick to doing what he knew best - direction and production. One would be able to spot a Quentin Tarantino classic from a mile away. The theme of his films mostly revolve around dissimilar traditions, gangster violence, Blaxploitation themes and accented language."
