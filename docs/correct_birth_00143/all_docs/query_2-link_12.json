        "text": "(born 1963). American director and screenwriter Quentin Tarantino made films that were noted for their stylized violence, razor-sharp dialogue, and fascination with film and pop culture. He was nominated for several Academy Awards, winning in the writing category for both Pulp Fiction (1994) and Django Unchained (2012).\n\nQuentin Jerome Tarantino was born on March 27, 1963, in Knoxville, Tennessee. He worked in a video store in California before selling two screenplays that became True Romance (1993) and director Oliver Stone’s Natural Born Killers (1994). In 1992 Tarantino made his directing debut with Reservoir Dogs, a violent film about a failed jewelry store robbery. Two years later he established himself as a leading director with Pulp Fiction, which featured intersecting crime stories. The movie won the Palme d’Or award at the Cannes film festival, and Tarantino later received (with Roger Avary) an Academy Award for best original screenplay. For the movie Jackie Brown (1997), Tarantino adapted an Elmore Leonard novel about a flight attendant entangled in criminal activities."
