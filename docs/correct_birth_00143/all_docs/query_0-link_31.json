Quentin and his childhood friend, Adam Olis,[6] began to make movies in his backyard using cheap animations. He attended acting school at the James Best Theatre Company in Toluca Lake. At age 22, he held employment at the Video Archives, a now defunct video rental store in Manhattan Beach where he and fellow movie buffs like Roger Avary spent all day discussing and recommending films to customers.[7]\n\nQuentin Tarantino - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJan 6, 2010\n\nWimberlake\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nJul 10, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n345\n\nLikes\n\n1\n\nJan 6, 2010\n\ngoogle is your friend:\n\nTarantino was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, the son of Connie McHugh Tarantino Zastoupil, a health care executive and nurse born in Knoxville, and Tony Tarantino, an actor and amateur musician born in Queens, New York.[2] Tarantino's father is Italian American and his mother is of Irish and Cherokee Native American ancestry.[3][4][5] He was raised solely by his mother, as his parents had separated before their son's birth.[6] When he was two years old, his mother moved with her son to Torrance, California, and later moved to the Harbor City neighborhood of Los Angeles.[6] He attended Narbonne High School in Harbor City for his freshman year before dropping out of school at age 15.

He makes movies that HE wants to see. I applaud him for that. It's something script writers need to do more often. For example, his spin on WWII in Inglorious Basterds. I'll also add that Jackie Brown is my favorite Tarantino flick.\n\nJan 7, 2010\n\nwounded mullet\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nJan 19, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n13,946\n\nLikes\n\n11\n\nJan 7, 2010\n\nWhen i first started seeing those kgb commercials on TV where you could text any question and they would answer it for you FOR A FEE.

He didn't grow up here at all. It is like someone always has a aunt or friend that knows a person that was working at a hospital when 'insert person on the local news' came in with something stuck up their rear.\n\nI guess you can say the same thing about people knowing Johnny Knoxville but at least that could be true.\n\nTarantino neither wrote or directed Hostel, fyi.\n\nEli Roth aka the Bear Jew did.\n\nAnd I was right... he dropped out. So there ya go. I just figured the guy actually went to college since he gets paid money to write and direct bad movies.\n\nEveryone has different taste , but I find you very incorrect in this statement.\n\nI hope IB gets a Oscar nod because it is his best movie since Pulp Fiction.\n\nJan 7, 2010\n\nPlano Vol\n\nJunior Member\n\nJoined\n\nJul 22, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n4,974\n\nLikes\n\n4,402\n\nJan 7, 2010\n\nguess you can say the same thing about people knowing Johnny Knoxville but at least that could be true.\n\nI'm sure there are several people in Maynardsville that remember Aldo Raines' family and the parade they had for him at the end of the war.\n\nJan 7, 2010\n\ntimmy\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nSep 18, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n1,444\n\nLikes\n\n0\n\nJan 7, 2010\n\nPulp Fiction was a good movie.
