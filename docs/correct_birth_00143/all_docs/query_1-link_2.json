        "text": "(1963-)\n\nWho Is Quentin Tarantino?\n\nBorn in Tennessee in 1963, Quentin Tarantino moved to California at age 4. His love of movies led to a job in a video store, during which time he wrote the scripts for True Romance and Natural Born Killers. Tarantino's directorial debut came with 1992's Reservoir Dogs, but he received widespread critical and commercial acclaim with Pulp Fiction (1994), for which he won an Academy Award for best screenplay. Subsequent features included Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) and Vol. 2 (2004) and Grindhouse (2007). Tarantino earned several award nominations for Inglourious Basterds (2009) and Django Unchained (2012), the latter garnering him a second Oscar win for best screenplay, and he went on to write and direct The Hateful Eight (2015) and Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood (2019).\n\nEarly Life\n\nQuentin Tarantino was born on March 27, 1963, in Knoxville, Tennessee. He is the only child of Connie McHugh, who is part Cherokee and part Irish, and actor Tony Tarantino, who left the family before Quentin was born.\n\nMoving to California at the age of 4, Tarantino developed his love for movies at an early age. One of his earliest memories is of his grandmother taking him to see a John Wayne movie. Tarantino also loved storytelling, but he showed his creativity in unusual ways. \"He wrote me sad Mother's Day stories. He'd always kill me and tell me how bad he felt about it,\" Connie once told Entertainment Weekly. \"It was enough to bring a tear to a mother's eye.\"\n\nTarantino loathed school, choosing to spend his time watching movies or reading comics rather than studying. The only subject that appealed to him was history. \"History was cool and I did well there, because it was kind of like the movies,\" he told Entertainment Weekly. After dropping out of high school, Tarantino worked as an usher at an adult film theater for a time. He also took acting classes. Tarantino eventually landed a job at Video Archives in Manhattan Beach, California. There he worked with Roger Avary, who shared his passion for film. The two even worked on some script ideas together.\n\nEarly Films: 'True Romance,' 'Natural Born Killers,' 'Reservoir Dogs'\n\nDuring his time at Video Archives, Tarantino worked on several screenplays, including True Romance and Natural Born Killers. He also landed a guest spot on the popular sitcom The Golden Girls, playing an Elvis Presley impersonator. In 1990, Tarantino left Video Archives to work for Cinetel, a production company. Through one of the producers there, he was able to get his script for True Romance in the hands of director Tony Scott. Scott liked Tarantino's script, and bought the rights to it.\n\nWorking with producer Lawrence Bender, Tarantino was able to secure funding for his directorial debut, Reservoir Dogs (1992), for which he had also written the screenplay. Actor Harvey Keitel was impressed when he read the script, saying \"I haven't seen characters like these in years.\" He signed on as an actor and a producer for the project. Other cast members included Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi and Tarantino himself.\n\nIn 1992, audiences at the Sundance Film Festival were entranced by Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino's ultraviolent crime caper gone wrong. He drew inspiration for the project from such classic heist films as Rififi and City on Fire. The independent film helped make Tarantino one of the most talked-about figures in Hollywood. While not a big hit in the United States, it became a popular title on video and did well overseas.\n\nOscar Win for 'Pulp Fiction'\n\nWith Pulp Fiction (1994), Tarantino created an unpredictable thrill ride filled with violence and pop culture references. In one story in the film, John Travolta played Vincent Vega, a hit man assigned to look after his boss's girlfriend (Uma Thurman)â€”a role that helped resuscitate his then-flagging career. Another part examined Vega's partnership with fellow hit man Jules Winnfield (played by Samuel L. Jackson). And yet another storyline involved Bruce Willis as a boxer. Tarantino managed to successfully interweave all these different stories to make a fascinating film. \"His mind works like the Tasmanian Devil on a bullet train. It's so fast that very few people can keep up with his references,\" actor Eric Stoltz, who played a drug dealer in the film, explained to Los Angeles magazine.\n\nPulp Fiction was both a commercial and critical success. In the United States, it earned over $108 million at the box office, becoming the first independent film to do so. Pulp Fiction won the prestigious Palme d'Or Award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1994 and received seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director. For his work on the film, Tarantino took home the award for Best Original Screenplay, an honor he had to share with former collaborator Roger Avary. The two had a falling out over the writing credits for the film.\n\n'Natural Born Killers,' 'From Dusk Till Dawn,' 'Jackie Brown'\n\nKnown for his temper, Tarantino got into a public disagreement with director Oliver Stone. Stone directed Natural Born Killers (1994) and rewrote parts of Tarantino's script. Enraged by the rewrites, Tarantino fought to have his name taken off the film. Stone told the press that the changes were an improvement over the original, which had poor character development. In a related incident, Tarantino slapped one of the producers of Natural Born Killers when he ran into him at Los Angeles restaurant.\n\nIn 1995, Tarantino wrote and directed one of the four stories featured in Four Rooms. The other three were handled by other rising independent filmmakers Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell and Robert Rodriguez. After the release of Four Rooms, Tarantino and Rodriguez collaborated on From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). Tarantino wrote the screenplay for the film and starred opposite George Clooney, the two playing criminals who end up battle vampires. Rodriguez directed the film, which received negative reviews from critics.\n\nTarantino soon tackled Jackie Brown (1997), a crime thriller starring Pam Grier as a stewardess who gets caught smuggling money for an arms dealer (played by Jackson). A tribute to the blaxploitation films of the 1970s, the film was adapted from an Elmore Leonard novel. Grier herself had appeared in many blaxploitation classics, including Foxy Brown (1974). The film was well received, with many calling it a more mature work for Tarantino. Critic Leonard Matlin commented that there were \"dynamite performances all around\" for a cast that also included Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, and Robert Forster. Not everyone loved the film, however. Fellow filmmaker Spike Lee objected to Tarantino's overuse of a derogatory term for African Americans in Jackie Brown, publicly complaining in Army Archerd's column in Variety.\n\nBroadway's 'Wait Until Dark'\n\nAfter Jackie Brown, Tarantino took a break from filmmaking. He starred on Broadway in 1998 in a revival of Wait Until Dark with Marisa Tomei. It was a bold move for him, as he had never done professional stage work before. Tarantino played a thug who terrorizes a blind woman (played by Tomei), and the critics were less than impressed. The reviews for the production were brutally harsh, and Tarantino was devastated. He felt people on the street were recognizing him as \"the one whose acting sucks. I tried not to take it personally, but it was personal. It was not about the playâ€”it was about me, and at a certain point I started getting too thin a skin about the constant criticism.\"\n\nTarantino worked on a World War II script during this period. The screenplay \"became big and sprawling. It was some of the best stuff I've ever written, but at a certain point, I thought, 'Am I writing a script or am I writing a novel?' I basically ended up writing three World War II scripts. None of them had an ending,\" he later explained to Vanity Fair.\n\n'Kill Bill'\n\nInstead of tackling his war epic, Tarantino jumped into the world of martial arts films. The idea for Kill Bill was formed by Tarantino and Thurman in a bar during the filming of Pulp Fiction. In 2000, Thurman ran into Tarantino at an Oscar party and asked whether he had made any progress with the idea. He promised her that he would write the script as a birthday present for her, initially saying he would finish in two weeks, though it ended up taking a year. Tarantino had to learn on the fly how to make a kung fu film, working and reworking the sequences as he went along.\n\nTarantino originally wanted Warren Beatty for the titular \"Bill,\" but he moved on to David Carradine from the television series Kung Fu. The plot focused on revenge, as a female assassin known as the Bride (Thurman) seeks to kill those involved in the savage attack on her and her wedding party. Running over budget and over schedule, Tarantino persevered with the project, shooting so much that he eventually had to create two films. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 was released in late 2003, with Kill Bill: Vol. 2 following a few months later.\n\n'Grindhouse,' 'Inglorious Basterds'\n\nAfter Kill Bill, Tarantino dabbled in television. He wrote and directed an episode of the drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation in 2005, for which he received an Emmy Award nomination. Tarantino then worked with Robert Rodriguez again. The two filmmakers each made their own gory and graphic ode to the B-movies, which were shown together as a double-feature known as Grindhouse (2007). Critics and movie-goers alike were not quite certain what to make of this collaboration, and it flopped at the box office.\n\nTarantino finally returned to work on his World War II script. In 2009, he released the long-awaited Inglourious Basterds, which focused on a group of Jewish-American soldiers out to destroy as many Nazis as possible. He had wooed Brad Pitt to play the leader of the \"Basterds.\" Some of the reviews were mixed, but Tarantino seemed unfazed by any negative comments. \"I respect criticism. But I know more about film than most of the people writing about me. Not only that, I'm a better writer than most of the people writing about me,\" he explained to GQ magazine. He clearly may have known best in this case, as the film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including two for Tarantino (for best director and best original screenplay).\n\nSecond Oscar Win for 'Django Unchained'\n\nTarantino went on to meet with both commercial and critical success with his action Western Django Unchained, released in late 2012. In the film, Jamie Foxx starred as Django, a freed slave who teams up with a bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) to search for his wife, played by Kerry Washington. Django then has to face off against his wife's plantation owner, played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the film. Other cast members include Jackson and Jonah Hill. At the 85th Academy Awards in 2013, Tarantino won an Academy Award for best original screenplay for Django Unchained. The film received several other Oscar nominations, including for best picture, cinematography and sound editing.\n\n'The Hateful Eight,' 'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood'\n\nIn 2015, the director revisited the Western theme for The Hateful Eight. Featuring such frequent Tarantino collaborators as Jackson, Roth and Madsen, the film snagged Golden Globe nominations in several categories.\n\nFour years later, Tarantino delivered his follow-up effort, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. Co-starring DiCaprio and Pitt, the film focuses on the former's struggles to remain relevant as an actor in 1969, presenting an twist on the real-life events that led to the infamous Charles Manson family murders. The feature reportedly drew a seven-minute standing ovation following its May 2019 premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, and went on to earn Golden Globe wins for Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.\n\n#MeToo and Harvey Weinstein\n\nAfter a series of sexual assault accusations ended the career of producer Harvey Weinstein and sparked the #MeToo movement in late 2017, Tarantino admitted he knew about Weinstein's behavior toward women and expressed regret that he didn't do more to stop it. He was also forced to account for his own alleged misogynistic behavior as a director, including the rumor that he forced Thurman to drive a dangerous stunt car while filming Kill Bill, resulting in a life-changing accident for the actress.\n\nWife\n\nIn 2016, Tarantino began dating Daniella Pick, daughter of Israeli singer and songwriter Tzvika Pick. After getting engaged in 2017, they married in Los Angeles in November 2018. In August 2019, the couple announced they were expecting their first child together.\n\nThe filmmaker had previously been involved in a long-term relationship with actress Mira Sorvino.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Quentin Tarantino\n\nBirth Year: 1963\n\nBirth date: March 27, 1963\n\nBirth State: Tennessee\n\nBirth City: Knoxville\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Known for his unpredictable, violent films, Quentin Tarantino first earned widespread fame for 'Pulp Fiction,' before going on to direct 'Inglourious Basterds' and 'Django Unchained.'\n\nIndustries\n\nWriting and Publishing\n\nHorror\n\nTelevision\n\nDrama\n\nAction\n\nAstrological Sign: Aries\n\nCultural Associations\n\nIrish American\n\nOccupations\n\nDirector\n\nScreenwriter\n\nProducer\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Quentin Tarantino Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/quentin-tarantino\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: September 23, 2020\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 2, 2014\n\nQUOTES"
