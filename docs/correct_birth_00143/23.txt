Quentin Tarantino was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, on March 27, 1963, but lived for twenty years, until he was 22, in the South Bay, south of Los Angeles, with his mother. Tarantino dropped out of school at 17 to teach acting classes and support himself with odd jobs.

At 22, he moved to Manhattan Beach, where, along with Roger Avary and Jerry Martinez, Tarantino would turn "Video Archives" into a makeshift film school. Tarantino spent several frustrating years writing and trying to get two screenplays that were intended to be his directorial debut off the ground.

His first two scripts, Natural Born Killers and Point Blank Love, made possible the production of his first recognized film, Reservoir Dogs (1992).

Quentin Tarantino presented the feature film at the Sundance Film Festival. It was highly acclaimed by critics. Empire magazine named it the best independent film of all time.

He has won two Oscars for Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained, which also won the Bafta Award and the Golden Globes. Tarantino's films are characterized by a very particular aesthetic of violence.
