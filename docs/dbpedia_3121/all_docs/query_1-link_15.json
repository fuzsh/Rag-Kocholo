Charlemagne\n\nCarolingian Empire, 747-814\n\nCharlemagne, also known as the ‘Father of Europe, was a great leader and emperor.

It was his amazing leadership qualities that the pope was compelled to make him the first Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nHe was an illiterate person himself. However, this did not stop him from transforming the rest of society. During his leadership, he established many educational hubs that increased literacy among the kids. He also set up many schools across Europe, thus helping advance Europe during the Middle Ages.\n\n12. Emperor Augustus\n\nRome, 63 B.C.E. – 14 A.D.\n\nIn a time when the world was crippled with wars and unrest, Augustus proved to be a breath of fresh air for many.

He is credited for building up the great city of Byzantium and then naming it Constantinople. Very few people know that the old Constantinople is now known as Istanbul and is one of the most extraordinary cities in the world.\n\nAdditionally, Constantine also spread Christianity and allowed it to flourish within the Roman Emperor.\n\n14. William the Conqueror\n\nEngland, c. 1028-1087\n\nWilliam, also known as William, the conqueror, invaded England in 1066. This allowed the Normans to gain victory over the British and achieve a lifelong dream. William the conqueror was a ruthless leader and put down a plethora of revolts that arose in Northern England.\n\nAlthough his tactics worked, they also led to the destruction of much of the countryside. But that is not all, William I also built several castles throughout England. He also conducted a long and massive survey report that is known as the Doomsday Book.\n\n15. Genghis Khan\n\nMongol Empire, 1162-1227\n\nPeople of the world are familiar with a lot of stories and tales associated with the Mongol Empire. One name is always synonymous with tyranny and ruthlessness, and that name is Genghis Khan. He was a brutal conqueror whose drive to conquer lands surpassed all other needs. Under his leadership, the nomadic people of Northeast Asia came together and came under a unanimous Mongol Empire.\n\nHe also slaughtered entire cities that revolted against him. This led to millions of his enemies dying during battle. Additionally, he led the mass extermination of people who resisted his rule. Although known for his brutality, the nomadic people respected him because of his willingness to share his wealth with the common people.\n\n16. Kublai Khan\n\nMongol Empire, 1215-1294\n\nKublai Khan, another great Mongol leader, was the grandson of Genghis Khan and ruled over the empire for decades.

Many are unaware that Kublai Khan founded the great Yuan dynasty of China. Additionally, he also built the great palace of Xanadu- a historic place that was visited by Marco Polo on his many, many voyages.\n\n17. Joan of Arc\n\nFrance, c. 1412-1430\n\nJoan of Arc is included in the books of great historians. She became an inspiration for females at a time when female leaders were rare. Joan of Arc, a French heroine, led an entire army to victory during the Hundred Years’ war between France and England. Her amazing tactics and great military prowess got her victory against the superior British forces. Such was her valor that she threatened the English army, who captured her and accused her of sorcery.\n\nThis was mainly because Joan of Arc broke stereotypes and chose to dress as a man. She was just 19 when she was captured and then burned alive at the stake. Although she met an early death, her story lived on and continued to inspire millions around the globe.\n\nAlso read: How inspirational female leaders conquered the world?\n\n18.

Among his six wives included Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn.\n\n19. Suleiman the Magnificent\n\nOttoman Empire, 1494-1566\n\nSuleiman, the emperor of the great Ottoman empire, was given the title of the Magnificent, all thanks to his extreme prowess and leadership skill. He was the longest reigning emperor of the Ottoman empire and dreamt of taking over the entire Europe one day. His ambition led him to lay siege to Vienna. The siege failed and began the long-lasting rivalry between the Habsburgs and the Ottoman empire.\n\nThis rivalry lasted centuries and cost millions to the Ottoman empire.

His was a golden age during which he transformed the legal system of the Ottomans.

He was released from prison in 1990 and was elected as the first black president.\n\n21. Queen Elizabeth I\n\nEngland, 1533-1603\n\nThere are not many female visionaries and leaders that the world remembers. However, Queen Elizabeth 1 was different. Daughter of Henry VIII, Elizabeth 1 took over the English throne at a time when England was gripped with politics and turmoil. Before Elizabeth took charge, the country was ruled by Mary, her half-sister, who forcefully converted the country to Catholicism.\n\nWhen Elizabeth took over, she vowed to make the country protestant. She was known as the virgin queen because she never married and never birthed an heir. Moreover, Elizabeth’s reign lasted a good 44 years, and it was a time of great stability and peace. She was a fairly tolerant and inclusive leader who was loved by her subjects.\n\n22.

On top of that, Catherine is known for having a book collection of around 38000.\n\n23. George Washington\n\nUnited States, 1732-1799\n\nGeorge Washington is one of those leaders that changed the world for all times to come. The first president of the united states of America, George Washington, led the revolutionary war that saw the colonies become separate countries in the 1700s. He not only inspired others to join his cause, but his military prowess allowed the untrained Americans to fight one of the biggest battles in history against the mighty British.\n\nAfter the victory, the Americans unanimously voted for George Washington and elected him to be the leader of the newly formed country. Washington is also credited for establishing many new, progressive laws in the land. Although he possessed many black slaves during his lifetime, he freed most of them at the time of his death, thus setting a good precedent for all times to come.\n\n24. Thomas Jefferson\n\nUnited States, 1743-1826\n\nWe can not talk about great leaders that history reveres without mentioning Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United States of America.

Moreover, as president, he bought Louisiana and doubled the size of the newly formed country.

Napoleon Bonaparte\n\nFrance, 1769-1821\n\nWe have heard Napoleon’s name in stories, and read about him in books, but how many of us know that Napoleon Bonaparte was one of the best military leaders to have ever graced the Earth? He was an excellent commander of the French forces, who then became the emperor of France.\n\nHe led a lot of conquests against the British and took over much of great Continental Europe. Napoleon was an unwavering leader. Even after being captured and exiled by the Russians, he regained control of France and led an army in the famous battle of Waterloo. He ultimately faced defeat, but his unwavering valor and courage still inspire millions of officers and leaders today.\n\n27. José de San Martín\n\nArgentina, 1778-1850\n\nJose de San Martín was an Argentinian who joined and led many local revolutionary movements. He was a proud general who helped lead Argentinian, Peru, and Chile to independence from Spain.\n\nHe led an extremely successful military career in Europe and then later joined his homeland, Argentina, and became a part of the revolution. He fought in many countries and became a national hero in all the countries he fought to free in his lifetime.\n\n28. Simón Bolívar\n\nVenezuela, 1783-1830\n\nSimon Bolivar may be a relatively less known leader when compared to other famous world leaders in history, however, his contribution to the world can not be ignored. He was one of the most popular leaders in South America. He led Ecuador, Peru, Columbia, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Panama to independence from Spain.\n\nHe hoped that these countries would be united and would form one nation, however, these countries soon started fighting each other. He was very disappointed at this outcome and ultimately decided to step down as president in 1830. Despite this, Bolivar is still considered the El Libertador- a national hero of South America.\n\n29. Abraham Lincoln\n\nUnited States, 1809-1865\n\nAbraham Lincoln, the legend, the myth, was the 16th president of the United States of America and is credited for freeing American slaves. His tenure saw the United States of America torn between slave and anti-slave nations. The country also went through the great Civil War. It was the military prowess and statesmanship of Abraham Lincoln that led the country to victory.\n\nHe also signed the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 which freed the slaves. He was, however, brutally assassinated by a Confederate sympathizer just days after the end of the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg address is part of history books and is taught to students in America.\n\n30. Queen Victoria\n\nUnited Kingdom, 1819-1901\n\nUntil Queen Elizabeth, second’s reign, Queen Victoria’s reign was the longest-ranging, a total of 63 years. She took over the hold of the great British empire at the early age of 18 and saw the empire go through massive changes. Her tenure saw the empire colonize a lot of countries and expand beyond measure.\n\nMoreover, Queen Victoria also led the Empire through great scientific, industrial, and political change. She was married to Prince Albert and birthed nine children. She is also the first leader who went through eight assassination attempts and was unhinged. Her subjects loved her and moaned when she died.\n\n31.

He was the supreme chief of the Lakota Sioux nation and fought the mighty US troops.\n\nAfter the defeat of its troops, the US sent many more troops, which ultimately led the Lakota Sioux nations to surrender. Sitting Bull surrendered in 1881, went back to South Dakota, and was part of many revolutionary movements. Although he met an untimely demise, he is still revered as a symbol of Native American Resistance.\n\n32. Tsar Nicholas II\n\nRussian Empire, 1868-1918\n\nTsars are known for their brutality and their ruthless leadership style, however, this generalization is far from true. Among the tsars was Tsar Nicholas, the second. He was the last of the Russian emperors and fought hard against the resistance.\n\nHe resisted the efforts of the new Duma, the Russian Parliament, from gaining power. However, he was soon forced to abdicate his throne. He sought exile in Siberia, where he was soon executed. His death led to Russia finally becoming part of the great Soviet Union.\n\n33. Mahatma Gandhi\n\nIndia, 1869-1948\n\nMahatma Gandhi was a civil rights leader who fought against the British and compelled the British to give independence to joint India. More than a freedom fighter, Gandhi was known for his non-violent mantra and protest.\n\nHe followed in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr and never called for any bloodshed or violence against the British. Although he was assassinated soon after India sought independence, people around the globe still revere him for his amazing wisdom and his adamant nature.\n\n34. Vladimir Lenin\n\nSoviet Union, 1870-1924\n\nVladimir Lenin was the leader of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. He oversaw the transformation of Russia into the Soviet Union. He was a proponent of communism and established many communist reforms throughout the country. He was a stout believer in the theories of Karl Marx.\n\nHe redistributed a lot of wealth and land among the poor peasants, and also nationalized many banks and industries. But Lenin was in no way a simple leader. He was a divisive figure who championed socialism and cared for the poor. However, for other people, he established a totalitarian regime and oppressed his opponents.\n\n35. Winston Churchill\n\nUnited Kingdom, 1874-1965\n\nMany consider Winston Churchill the most shrewd politician and leader to have walked the Earth. He was the prime minister who successfully led the UK throughout the second world war. He was a great orator and could command a room with ease.\n\nHe was also extremely inspirational and could keep people’s spirits high even during times of crisis. Winston Churchill was an animal lover, a greater author, and an even better painter. He also had the privilege of being the prime minister of the UK twice.\n\n36. Joseph Stalin\n\nSoviet Union, 1878-1953\n\nAlthough Lenin and Stalin are mentioned together in much of history books, they were indeed very different people. When Lenin died in 1924, Joseph Stalin became the new leader of the Soviet Union.\n\nHe was a ruthless leader and his brutality knew no bounds. He killed millions of his citizens who dared to oppose him. Joseph Stalin was also a divisive leader, whose policies led to the start of the 40 years cold war.\n\n37. Franklin D. Roosevelt\n\nUnited States, 1882-1945\n\nWhen compared with other American presidents, Roosevelt often tops the list. He was the longest-serving US president who presented many diverse policies that helped the most underprivileged.\n\nHis economic programs allowed the country to recover from the Great depression.

Benito Mussolini\n\nItaly, 1883-1945\n\nBenito Mussolini was in no way a morally-upright leader. However, he is still known as a leader that transformed society. He started the fascist political party that gained popularity in Italy. He was also a ruthless leader who ruled as a dictator and joined the Allies during world war.\n\nMussolini won many battles, but met an untimely death after he was captured and then executed by the opposing forces.\n\n39. Adolf Hitler\n\nGermany, 1885-1945\n\nThere is hardly a person alive today who is unaware of Adolf Hitler. He was undoubtedly one of the most ruthless and tyrannical leaders of all time. His actions and divisive actions started World War II. He took over much of Europe, killing millions around the globe.\n\nNot just that, Adolf Hitler also sent around six million Jewish people to their deaths. Hitler met his death after the defeat of World War II and was forced to take his own life.\n\n40. Mao Zedong\n\nChina, 1893-1976\n\nThe founder of the Chinese Communist party, Mao Zedong, founded the people’s republic of China and started a cult following of sorts. He took some extreme measures and reformed China by taking steps like the Great Leap forward.\n\nSome of his policies proved very unsuccessful, however, Mao Zedong refused to accept his mistakes and was adamant that he was on the right. Despite his flaws, Mao Zedong was a powerful leader who pushed China and transformed it into a world power.\n\nWhat Can You Learn From the World-Famous Leaders in History?\n\n1. The Ability to Look at the Bigger Picture\n\nGreat leaders of the past had great visions as well. Rather than fixating on small failures and setbacks, they kept their chins high and continued looking forward. There have been leaders like Muhammad Ali Jinnah of Pakistan who made small concessions because he wanted to get a separate homeland for Muslims.\n\nHe even gave up separate electorates for Muslims because he knew that to achieve something big, he would have to give up smaller things.\n\n2.
