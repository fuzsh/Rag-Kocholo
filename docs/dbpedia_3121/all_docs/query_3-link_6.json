I want to welcome everybody to this confirmation hearing on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch, and he is nominated to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Judge, welcome to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Judge Gorsuch. Pleasure to be here. Thank you. Chairman Grassley. This is a big day for you and your family. You have been before this Committee once before for the confirmation hearing to the Tenth Circuit, where you now sit. I imagine that this hearing may be a little better attended than the last time you were here. Judge Gorsuch. Just a little, Senator. Chairman Grassley. Yes. Before we begin, I would like to give you the opportunity to introduce your family and anybody else you want to introduce. Judge Gorsuch. Senator, this is quite a lot different than it was the last time I was here, and I appreciate all the attention. I would like to introduce my family who are here. My wife, Louise, who, as you remember, stole the show in the East Room the day I was nominated. Chairman Grassley. Yes. Judge Gorsuch. I have got here somewhere, I am told, in the audience, my brother-in-law, my brother-in-law's folks, Phil and Priscilla Albright, and my nephew Jack. How are you doing, Jack? [Laughter.] Judge Gorsuch. I have got my cousin Meg Hopkins and her daughter with her, Lori. I have got a bunch more family coming. My daughter is watching back home in the West. I have got my longtime assistant, Holly Cody. Where is Holly? There she is. Ten years we have worked together. I consider her family. And I have got a whole bunch of my law clerks here in the audience, and if they would not mind just standing up for a second, I would like to recognize them because I consider them family, too. So, Senator, I am very blessed to have so many family here with me today. Thank you. Chairman Grassley. Thank you. We thank you, Judge. We are delighted to have your family here as well for this very important moment in your life. Before I give my opening statement, I want to set out a couple of ground rules. I want everyone to be able to watch the hearing without obstruction. If people stand up and block the view of those behind them or speak out of turn, it is not fair or it is not very considerate to others. So officers will immediately, under our rules, remove those individuals. Now I would like to take a minute to explain about how we are going to proceed. We will have 10-minute rounds of opening statements. The Ranking Member and I may go a minute or two over the 10 minutes, but I am going to ask everyone else to limit your remarks to 10 minutes. And I hope everybody on both sides of the aisle will respect that. We will then turn to our introducers, who will be formally presenting the judge. Then we will administer the oath to the judge, and we will close today's portion of the hearing with the judge's testimony. Tomorrow morning, we will begin at 9:30 a.m. for the opening round of questions. Each Senator will have 30 minutes for the opening round. After the first round, the Senators will have 20 minutes for a second round. And finally, as I have discussed with the Ranking Member, later today we will notice a mark-up to consider the judge's nomination for next Monday the 27th. In anticipation of his nomination will be held over for 1 week, as any Senator has that right under our rules to do so, we will then vote on his nomination the following Monday, April 3. With that, I would turn to my opening statement and then to Senator Feinstein for her opening statement. One of Justice Scalia's best opinions begins with this declaration. It is ``the proudest boast of our democracy that we have a government of laws and not of men.'' The phrase comes from the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780. This infant State constitution linked the Government of laws, and not of men, directly to the separation of powers. Justice Scalia said the Founders ``viewed the principle of separation of powers as the absolutely central guarantee of a just government because without a secure structure of separated powers, our Bill of Rights would be worthless.'' In plain words, it was the desire to preserve and protect liberty and self-government that guided the Framers as they designed our Constitution. And the founding charter they designed is a remarkable document, as we know. The Bill of Rights, of course, preserves liberty by restricting what the Government may do. But the single most important feature of our Constitution is not any particular enumerated right or even the entire Bill of Rights taken together. The most important feature of our Constitution is the design of the document itself. That design divides the limited power of government vertically between State and Federal Governments, and it distributes power horizontally between co-equal branches. It is this very delicate balance of power, entrusted to competing factions, that ensures that liberty for the people will endure. It is the Constitution's design that protects against the mischief that results from the concentration of political power. The Founders understood this fundamental principle, and Justice Scalia understood it better than anyone. He was fond of telling law students, ``Every tin horn dictator in the world today, every president for life, has a bill of rights. But the real key to the distinctiveness of America is the structure of our Government.'' Our constitutional republic is also designed around the notion that the people, acting through their representatives, retain ultimate authority to govern. It was the people, through their representatives, who ratified the Constitution that establishes our system of government. Under that system, except where the Constitution has already answered the question, decisions are made by elected representatives. Elected, yes, but also accountable to the voters. But to endure, our system of self-government requires judges to apply the text of our laws as the people's representatives enacted them. So our judges, by design, play a crucial, but limited role. They decide cases or controversies, but in resolving those cases, they may look only to the laws the people wrote. Judges are not free to rewrite statutes to get results they believe are more just. Judges are not free to reorder regulations to make them more fair. For sure, judges are not free to update the Constitution. That is not their job. That power is retained by the people, acting through their elected representatives. And when our judges do not respect this limited power, when they substitute their own policy preferences for those in the legislative branch, they take from the American people the right to govern themselves. As that happens, inch by inch and step by step, representative government is undermined, the carefully constructed balance of power is upset, and individual liberty is lost. These are not stale concepts. If anything, the enormous size, the enormous power, and the enormous complexity of the modern state renders them more relevant than ever before. In recent months, I have heard that now more than ever we need a Justice who is independent and who respects the separation of powers. Some of my colleagues seem to have rediscovered an appreciation for the need to confine each branch of government to its constitutional sphere. I do not question the sincerity of those concerns. Some of us have been alarmed by Executive overreach and the threat it poses to the separation of powers. Whether it was the executive branch unilaterally rewriting Federal law, as the Obama administration did dozens of times, or the Executive's repeated failure to enforce and defend the laws passed by Congress, over the last 8 years we have witnessed repeated abuses by one branch at the expense of the other two. Just ask the Supreme Court, which unanimously rejected arguments the Obama administration made in more than 40 cases. The policies that drove those abuses were, of course, problematic. But policies can be changed and must be changed. To this Senator, what is far more distressing about each Executive overreach and each failure to defend the law is the damage that it does to the constitutional order. The damage those abuses inflict is far more difficult to undo than the policies that animated them. For as John Adams observed, ``Liberty, once lost, is lost forever.'' So the separation of powers is just as critical today as it was during the administration, the last administration. And the preservation of our constitutional order, including the separation of powers, is just as crucial to our liberty today as it was when our founding charter was first adopted. No matter your politics, for all of these reasons you should be concerned about the preservation of our constitutional order and, most importantly, the separation of powers. And if you are concerned about these things, as you should be, I want you to meet Judge Neil Gorsuch. Fortunately for every American, we have before us today a nominee whose body of professional work is defined by an unfailing commitment to these principles. His grasp on the separation of powers, including judicial independence, enlivens his body of work. As he explains, ``To the Founders, the legislative and judicial powers were distinct by nature and their separation was among the most important liberty-protecting devices of the constitutional design.'' About the Executive, he writes that through ``the hard-won experiences under a tyrannical king, the Founders found proof of the wisdom of a government of separated powers.'' The judge's job, our nominee says, is to deliver on the promise that ``all litigants, rich or poor, mighty or weak, will receive equal protection under the law and due process for their grievances.'' The nominee before us understands that any judge worth his salt will ``regularly issue judgments with which they disagree as a matter of policy, all because they think that is what the law fairly demands.'' Fundamentally, that is the difference between a legislator and a judge. All of us should keep this in mind during the course of this hearing. Judge, I am afraid over the next couple of days, you will get some questions that will cause you just to scratch your head. Truth be told, it should puzzle anyone who ever takes a civics class. We will hear that when you rule for one party and against another in a case, it means you must be for the winner and against the loser. Senators will cite some opinions of yours, and then we will hear that you are for the ``big guy'' and against the ``little guy.'' You will scratch your head when you hear this because it is as if you judges write the laws instead of us Senators. But if Congress passes a bad law, as a judge, you are not allowed to just pretend that we passed a good law. The oath you take demands that you follow the law, even if you dislike the result. So if you hear that you are for some business or against some plaintiff, do not worry. We have heard all of that stuff before. It is an old claim, from an even older playbook. You and I and the American people know whose responsibility it is to correct a law that produces a result that you dislike. It is the men and women sitting here with me. Good judges understand this. They know it is not their job to fix the law. In a democracy, that right belongs to the people. It is for this reason that Justice Scalia said this. ``If you are going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you are not always going to like the conclusion you reach. If you like them all the time, you are probably doing something wrong.'' Judge, I look forward to hearing more about your exceptional record, and I look forward to the conversation we will all have about the meaning of our Constitution and the job of a Supreme Court Justice in our constitutional scheme. [The prepared statement of Chairman Grassley appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Feinstein. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Senator Feinstein. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Judge Gorsuch, I want to welcome you and your family. We are here today under very unusual circumstances. It was almost a year ago today that President Obama nominated Chief Judge Merrick Garland for this seat. Unfortunately, due to unprecedented treatment, Judge Garland was denied a hearing, and this vacancy has been in place for well over a year. I just want to say I am deeply disappointed that it is under these circumstances that we begin our hearings. Merrick Garland was widely regarded as a mainstream moderate nominee. However, President Trump repeatedly promised to appoint someone in the mold of Justice Scalia and said that the nomination of Judge Gorsuch illustrates he is a man of his word. For those of us on this side, our job is not to theoretically evaluate this or that legal doctrine or to review Judge Gorsuch's record in a vacuum. Our job is to determine whether Judge Gorsuch is a reasonable mainstream conservative, or is he not. Our job is to assess how this nominee's decisions will impact the American people and whether he will protect the legal and constitutional rights of all Americans, not just the wealthy and the powerful. We hold these hearings not because court precedent and stare decisis are something average Americans worry about. We hold these hearings because the U.S. Supreme Court has the final word on hundreds of issues that impact our daily lives. The Supreme Court has the final say on whether a woman will continue to have control over her own body or whether decisions about her healthcare will be determined by politicians and the Government. It decides whether billionaires and large corporations will be able to spend unlimited sums of money to buy elections and whether States and localities will be able to pass laws and make it harder for poor people, people of color, seniors, and younger people to vote. It is the Supreme Court that will have final word on whether corporations will be able to pollute our air and water with impunity. Or whether the NRA and other extreme organizations will be able to block common sense gun regulations, including those that keep military-style assault weapons off our streets. And it is the Supreme Court that will have the ultimate say on whether employers will be held accountable for discriminating against workers or failing to protect workers when they are harmed or killed on the job. For example, last year Judge Gorsuch sat on a case that involved a truck driver who was stranded in the freezing cold for several hours after his trailer's brakes froze. He had no heat. In fact, it was so cold that the driver was having trouble breathing. His torso was numb, and he could not feel his feet. Despite this, his employer directed him to wait for a repairman or else drive both the truck and the trailer. When no one came, the driver unhitched the trailer to search for assistance because driving with frozen brakes with a fully loaded trailer would have been too dangerous. A week later, he was fired. After hearing the case, the administrative law judge ruled that firing the driver was a violation of the health and safety law intended to protect workers. The United States Department of Labor's Administrative Review Board and the Tenth Circuit agreed. Judge Gorsuch dissented and sided with the company. In another case, Judge Gorsuch wrote a separate opinion, this time to challenge a longstanding legal doctrine that allows agencies to write regulations necessary to effectively implement the laws that Congress passes and the President signs. It is called the Chevron doctrine. This legal doctrine has been fundamental to how our Government addresses real world challenges in our country and has been in place for decades. If overturned, as Judge Gorsuch has advocated, legislating rules are very difficult. In fact, Congress relies on agency experts to write the specific rules, regulations, guidelines, and procedures necessary to carry out laws we enact. These are what ensure the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act to protect our environment from pollution. They are the specific protections put in place by the FDA and the Agricultural Department that safeguard the health and safety of our food supply, our water, our medicines, and they are the details needed to support the infrastructure of our communities, our roads, highways, bridges, dams, and airports. We in Congress rely on the scientists, biologists, economists, engineers, and other experts to help ensure our laws are effectively implemented. For example, even though Dodd-Frank was passed nearly 7 years ago to combat the rampant abuse that led to our country's worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, it still requires over 100 regulations to be implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, and other regulators in order to reach its full effectiveness as intended by Congress when it was passed. Judge Gorsuch's position, were it to be adopted, would take away agencies' authorities to address these necessary details. Such a change in law would dramatically affect how laws passed by Congress can be properly carried out. Two weeks ago, The Washington Post ran an op-ed written by a woman who desperately wanted to have a baby. She described how she and her husband went to great lengths for 4 years trying to get pregnant and were thrilled when they finally succeeded. Tragically, after her 21-week check-up, they discovered her daughter had multicystic dysplastic kidney disease. They were told by three separate doctors that her condition was 100 percent fatal and that the risk to the mother was sevenfold if she carried her pregnancy to term. The mother described their excruciating decision and the unforgiving process the couple endured to get the medical care they needed. The debate over Roe v. Wade and the right to privacy, ladies and gentlemen, is not theoretical. In 1973, the Court recognized a woman's fundamental and constitutional right to privacy. That right guarantees her access to reproductive healthcare. In fact, the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld Roe's core finding, making it settled law for the last 44 years. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Chairman, to enter into the record the 14 key cases where the Supreme Court upheld Roe's core holding and the total 39 decisions where it has been reaffirmed by the Court. Chairman Grassley. Without objection, it is included. [The information appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Feinstein. Thank you. If these judgments, when combined, do not constitute super precedent, I do not know what does. Importantly, the dozens of cases affirming Roe are not only about precedent. They are also about a woman's fundamental and constitutional rights. Roe ensured that women and their doctors will decide what is best for their care, not politicians. President Trump repeatedly promised that his judicial nominees would be pro-life and ``automatically'' overturn Roe v. Wade. Judge Gorsuch has not had occasion to rule directly on a case involving Roe. However, his writings do raise questions. Specifically, he wrote that he believes there are no exceptions to the principle that ``the intentional taking of a human life by private persons is always wrong.'' This language has been interpreted by both pro-life and pro-choice organizations to mean he would overturn Roe. The Supreme Court is also expected to decide what kind of reasonable regulation States and localities can implement to protect our neighborhoods and schools from gun violence. In fact, just last month, the Fourth Circuit became the fifth appellate court to uphold a State's ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines under Heller. These new cases, taken together, enable the enactment of prudent and legal legislation to restrict military-style weapons from flooding our streets. Now while Judge Gorsuch has not written decisions on the Second Amendment, he did write an opinion to advocate making it harder to convict a felon who illegally possessed a gun. In this opinion, Judge Gorsuch argued against the Court's own precedent. Specifically, in this case, the defendant had been charged with attempted robbery in July of 2009. After pleading guilty, he was given probation. However, ``he was repeatedly both orally and in writing told that possession of a firearm'' violated his probation, which would mean he could not ``escape the consequences of his felony conviction.'' Less than a year later, he was apprehended by the police holding ``a fully loaded Hi-Point .380-caliber pistol with an obliterated serial number'' in clear violation of his probation. Later, he argued he did not know he was a felon. Six Circuit Courts, including the Tenth, have determined that the Government does not need to prove a defendant knew he was a felon to convict for this crime. Despite this, Judge Gorsuch wrote two separate opinions that argued in favor of making it harder to convict felons who possess guns. In one, he wrote that sometimes following precedent ``requires us to make mistakes.'' I find this concerning. Following precedent in this case was not a mistake. It led to the conviction of a felon who should not have had a firearm. Judge Gorsuch has also stated that he believes judges should look to the original public meaning of the Constitution when they decide what a provision of the Constitution means. This is personal, but I find this originalist judicial philosophy to be really troubling. In essence, it means the judges and courts should evaluate our constitutional rights and privileges as they were understood in 1789. However, to do so would not only ignore the intent of the Framers that the Constitution would be a framework on which to build, but it severely limits the genius of what our Constitution upholds. I firmly believe the American Constitution is a living document, intended to evolve as our country evolves. In 1789, the population of the United States was under 4 million. Today, we are 325 million and growing. At the time of our founding, African Americans were enslaved. It was not so long after, women had been burned at the stake for witchcraft, and the idea of an automobile, let alone the internet, was unfathomable. In fact, if we were to dogmatically adhere to originalist interpretations, then we would still have segregated schools and bans on interracial marriage. Women would not be entitled to equal protection under the law, and government discrimination against LGBT Americans would be permitted. So I am concerned when I hear that Judge Gorsuch is an originalist and a strict constructionist. Suffice it to say, and I conclude, the issues we are examining today are consequential. There is no appointment that is more pivotal to the Court than this one. This has a real world impact on all of us. Who sits on the Supreme Court should not simply evaluate legalistic theories and Latin phrases in isolation. They must understand the Court's decisions have real world consequences for men, women, and children across our Nation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Ranking Member Feinstein appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Grassley. Senator Hatch for 10 minutes. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Senator Hatch. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Gorsuch, welcome back to the Judiciary Committee. This will be more of an ordeal than your last. But your fitness for the appointment, it will be just as apparent. I served on this Committee for 40 years, and some things in the confirmation process never change. The conflict over judicial appointments in general, and over this nomination in particular, is a conflict over the proper role of judges in our system of government. I have long believed that the Senate owes the President some deference with respect to his qualified nominees. Qualifications for judicial service include legal experience, which summarizes the past, and judicial philosophy, which describes the present and anticipates the future. Judge Gorsuch's legal experience is well known. My Democratic colleagues have referred to the American Bar Association's rating as the gold standard for evaluating judicial nominees. The ABA's unanimous ``well qualified'' rating for Judge Gorsuch confirms that he has the highest level of professional qualifications, including integrity, competence, and temperament. Judicial philosophy is both the more important qualification and the more challenging to assess. It refers to a nominee's understanding of the power and proper role of judges in our system of government. Over the last several weeks, I have addressed this issue on the Senate floor and in opinion pages around the country by contrasting what I have called impartial judges and political judges. An impartial judge focuses on the process of interpreting and applying the law according to objective rules. In this way, the law, rather than the judge, determines the outcome. A political judge, in contrast, focuses on a desired result and fashions a means of achieving it. In this way, the judge, rather than the law, often determines the outcome. In my experience, a Supreme Court confirmation process reveals the kind of judge that Senators want to see appointed. A Senator, for example, who wants to know which side a nominee will be on in future cases or who demands that judges be advocates for certain political interests, clearly has a politicized judiciary in mind. The New York Times reported last week that the most prominent lines of attack against this nomination will be that Judge Gorsuch is ``no friend of the little guy.'' Something is seriously wrong when the confirmation process for a Supreme Court Justice resembles an election campaign for political office. This dangerous approach contradicts the oath of judicial office prescribed by Federal law. When taking the seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2006, Judge Gorsuch swore to administer justice without respect to persons and to impartially discharge his judicial duties. His opponents today demand in effect that he violate that oath. Advocates of such a politicized judiciary seem to think that the confirmation process requires only a political agenda and a calculator. When a nominee is a sitting judge, they tally the winners and losers in his past cases and do the math. If they like the result, it is thumbs up on confirmation. If they do not, well, it is thumbs down. What if, for example, Judge Gorsuch's record on the appeals court was as follows? He voted against the plaintiff in 83 percent of immigration cases, against the defendant in 92 percent of criminal cases, denied race claims more than 80 percent of the time, and agreed with other Republican-appointed judges 95 percent of the time. I can just hear the cries of protest, accusations that he favors certain parties and is hostile to others and threats of filibuster. That is, in fact, the record of a U.S. Circuit Court Judge nominated to the Supreme Court, but not the one before us today. It is the record of Judge Sonia Sotomayor, as described by Senator Charles Schumer at her July 2009 confirmation hearing. Not only did he champion her nomination, but he offered that statistical summary of her record as proof that, as he put it, ``She is in the mainstream.'' Oh, what a difference an election makes. Alexander Hamilton wrote about the importance of judicial independence, what Chief Justice William Rehnquist later called the ``crown jewel of our judicial system.'' Today, in a bizarre twist on that principle, Judge Gorsuch's opponents say that the only way for him to prove his independence is by promising to decide future cases according to certain litmus tests. In other words, judicial independence requires that he be beholden to them and their political agenda. If simply describing that unprincipled position is not enough to refute it, the confirmation process is in more trouble than I thought. Judge, I know that the integrity of the judiciary, fairness to the litigants who come before you, and your own oath of office are your highest priorities. You will be in good company by resisting efforts to make you compromise your impartiality. When President Lyndon Johnson nominated Judge Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court, Senator Ted Kennedy, my friend who would later chair this Committee, said, ``We have to respect that any nominee to the Supreme Court would have to defer any comments on any matters which are before the Court or very likely to appear before the Court.'' Now that was 50 years ago. When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg appeared before this Committee in 1993, she said, ``A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecast, no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain for the entire judicial process.'' Now in a speech earlier this year, Justice Sotomayor said this. ``What you want is for us to tell you how, as a judicial nominee, we are going to rule on the important issues you find vexing. Any self-respecting judge who comes in with an agenda that would permit that judge to tell you how they will vote is the kind of person you do not want--you do not want as a judge.'' Now I will close by reading from the letter we received from dozens of Judge Gorsuch's Harvard Law School peers. After describing how they were of all political, ideological, religious, geographical, and social stripes, the signers wrote, ``What unites us is that we attended law school with Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man we have known for more than a quarter century, and we unanimously believe that Neil possesses the exemplary character, outstanding intellect, steady temperament, humility, and open mindedness to be an excellent addition to the U.S. Supreme Court.'' I agree with that appraisal by people from all walks of life, from different political views, people who agree with you and do not agree with you, but acknowledge that you are a great judge. And I look forward to this hearing, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Senator Hatch appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Grassley. Yes, thank you, Senator. The Senator from Vermont. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Senator Leahy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I did find it interesting the Senator from Utah spoke about Justice Sotomayor, saying that these are the reasons her nomination--the speech, these are the reasons why Republicans should vote for her and Democrats vote against her. I would note that, of course, that Senator Hatch voted against her. Today marks the first time the Senate Judiciary Committee has met publicly to take action on a Supreme Court vacancy that resulted from Justice Scalia's death 13 months ago. It was just hours after we learned of Justice Scalia's sudden passing the Republican majority leader declared that the Senate would not provide any process to any nominee selected by President Obama, despite the President having nearly a year left in his term. This was an extraordinary blockade. It was totally unprecedented in our country's whole history. Some liken it to the action of the tyrannical kings who claim that they have sole control, as one of our Senators referred to here a few minutes ago, but it was a blockage backed by then-candidate Donald Trump. Committee Republicans met behind closed doors and declared that they would surrender the independence of this Committee to do the majority leader's bidding, and they ignored the Constitution in the process. In fact, this unprecedented obstruction is one of the greatest stains on the 200-year history of this Committee. Remember, the Judiciary Committee once stood against a Court-packing scheme of a Democratic President that would have eroded judicial independence, and that was a proud moment. Now Republicans on this Committee are guilty of their own Court- unpacking scheme, and the blockade of Chief Judge Merrick Garland was never grounded in principle or precedent. While Senate Republicans were meeting in backrooms to block President Obama's nominee, extreme special interest groups were also meeting in private to vet potential Supreme Court nominees for then-candidate Donald Trump. I do not know of any other Supreme Court nominee who was selected by interest groups rather than by a President in consultation with the Senate, as required by the Constitution. Now Senate Republicans made a big show last year about respecting the voice of the American people in this process. Now they are arguing that the Senate should rubberstamp a nominee selected by extreme interest groups and nominated by a President who lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. That President has demonstrated hostility to our constitutional rights and values. He has leveled personal attacks against Federal judges and career prosecutors who dare to see his promised Muslim ban for what it is, unconstitutional. He called our constitutionally protected free press ``the enemy of the American people.'' When the President's chief of staff says the nominee before us has the vision of Donald Trump, well, that raises questions for people who have actually read the Constitution or care about the rights it protects. More than perhaps any confirmation hearing for the last 30 years, I expect this nominee's judicial philosophy will play a central role. Now Judge Gorsuch has spent more than a decade on the Federal bench. He graduated from Harvard Law School. He clerked for the Supreme Court. He served in the Department of Justice. He received a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association. All things very positive for a Supreme Court nominee. And if all those things I have read were a sufficient reason to confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court, of course, Chief Judge Merrick Garland, who had exactly the same qualifications but was refused by the Republicans, would be sitting on the Court today. That is why philosophy becomes important. In contrast to past nominees like John Roberts, whose judicial philosophy was not clearly articulated when he appeared before this Committee, Judge Gorsuch appears to have a comprehensive originalist philosophy. It is the approach taken by jurists such as Justice Scalia or Justice Thomas, former Judge Bork. While it has gained some popularity within conservative circles, originalism, I believe, remains outside the mainstream of modern constitutional jurisprudence. It has been 25 years since an originalist has been nominated to the Supreme Court. Given what we have seen from Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas and Judge Gorsuch's own record, I worry that it goes beyond being a philosophy and that it becomes an agenda. We know that conservative groups that have vetted Judge Gorsuch, and the millionaires who fund them, have a clear agenda--one that is anti-choice, anti-environment, pro- corporate. And these groups are obviously confident that Judge Gorsuch shares their agenda. The first person who interviewed Judge Gorsuch in this process explained these groups did not ask, who is a really smart lawyer who has been really accomplished? Instead, they saw a nominee who understands these things like we do. After all, Judge Gorsuch has been described by a former leader of the Republican Party as a true loyalist and a good, strong conservative. Now the concerns I have about Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy and the process by which he was selected, the views of the President who nominated him, I hope and expect, Judge, that you will answer my questions and the questions of all of the Senators, both parties, as clearly as possible. You know, it is not enough to say in private that the President's attacks on the judiciary are disheartening. I need to know that you understand the role of the courts in protecting the rights of all Americans. I need to know that you could be an independent check and balance on the administration that has nominated you and on any administration that might follow it. Judge Gorsuch, these hearings, occurring the week after Sunshine Week, are the first opportunity for the American people to hear your views on the role of the courts and the meaning of our Constitution. Like the Founders, who did not know what legal questions would be presented in the decades to come, they set this constitutional process. It is important to understand or to determine whether you understand how the Court has a profound impact on small businesses and workers, on law enforcement and victims, on families and children across America. It is not contrary to the duties and obligations of a Supreme Court Justice to consider the effects of their rulings. The Court's aspiration, after all, is to provide equal justice under law. That is inscribed in Vermont marble over the doorway to the Court. Judge Gorsuch, these hearings will help us conclude if you are committed to the fundamental rights of all Americans. Will you allow the Government to intrude on Americans' personal privacy and freedom? Will you elevate the rights of corporations over those of real people? And will you rubberstamp a President whose administration has asserted that Executive power is not subject to judicial review? It is important to know whether you serve with independence or as a surrogate to the President who nominated you or to the special interest groups that provided that President with your name. Now I approach these hearings with these thoughts in mind. I can honestly say I have yet to decide how I am going to vote on this nomination. Unlike those who blocked the nomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland, I believe it is my constitutional responsibility to fairly evaluate a President's nominee to the Supreme Court. I have voted for Supreme Court nominees, and I have voted against others. I recall going on the floor of the Senate right after our Democratic leader said he would vote against John Roberts for Chief Justice. I was the next speech. I said I would vote for him. But I am going to base my determination on the full record at the conclusion of these hearings, just as I have done for the 16 previous Supreme Court nominations I have been in the Senate. The Supreme Court is the guarantor of the liberties of all Americans. Judge Gorsuch, when you took the oath to sit on the Federal bench, you spoke these following words that are in a judicial oath. ``I will administer justice without respect to persons and do equal right to the poor and to the rich.'' If confirmed, you have to be a Justice for all Americans, not for the special interests of a few. You know, I cannot think of any time in our Nation's history when that commitment is more important than it is now. That is what I have been thinking of all weekend long. The stakes for the American people could not be higher. We know that in Vermont, but America knows that. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Senator Leahy appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Grassley. Yes, and thank you, Senator Leahy. Now to Senator Cornyn. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN CORNYN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Senator Cornyn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Gorsuch, welcome to you and your family. As you can already tell, this is going to be a much different experience than you had 10 years ago when you were confirmed by voice vote of the entire United States Senate to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals to a life tenure position. The Senate Judiciary Committee undertakes no task more important than the one before us, considering a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. As you know, historically, these used to be pretty routine. But that is until judges became seen as policymakers rather than as impartial interpreters and appliers of the law. The Nation is watching, and I think that is a really good thing. At a time when fewer and fewer American citizens know our founding story and the principles upon which it is based, I think this is a wonderful opportunity for a teachable moment, and I would encourage you to take every opportunity to engage in that. We are considering a nominee, of course, left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. And as we have heard before, Justice Scalia was unique. His wit and style brought the Constitution to life for lawyers in their first year of law school and for the American public at large. He led the most important legal revolution in our lifetimes, tethering judicial interpretation to the written text. What a concept. This was part of the broader project which the nominee before us, Judge Neil Gorsuch, described as ``reminding us of the differences between judges and legislators. That judges should strive to apply the law as it is, not to decide cases based on their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they feel might serve society best.'' In one dissent, Justice Scalia wrote along similar lines that, ``If our pronouncements of constitutional law rely primarily on value judgments, then a free and intelligent people's attitude toward us can be expected to be quite different. The people know that their value judgments are quite as good as those taught in any law school and perhaps better.'' The Framers, I believe, shared Justice Scalia's and your modest view of the role of judging. Alexander Hamilton wrote, for example, ``The judiciary may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely judgment.'' After Justice Scalia's death, Senate Republicans decided to let the American people in this last Presidential election choose his successor. In Judge Gorsuch, President Trump chose one of the most accomplished lawyers and jurists of his generation. As we have heard, he is a husband and a father of two daughters, lives in his native Colorado and, if confirmed, would be our only Western Justice. Judge Gorsuch attended Columbia and Harvard Law School and, of course, got his doctorate at Oxford. After clerking for two Supreme Court Justices, Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, he went to work for a startup law firm that grew to be one of the Nation's most prestigious, where he spent a decade, as he put it, working in the trenches of the law. As a recovering lawyer and judge myself, I think it is critically important, Judge, it means that you understand better than most the impact of your decisions, actually having represented real, live clients. The law is not just an academic or intellectual exercise. It has real consequences for real people, and I would encourage you to talk about those real people that you came in contact with during your legal and judicial career. After serving his country at the Justice Department, Judge Gorsuch, as I mentioned earlier, was nominated and confirmed to the Tenth Circuit. Not one of our Democratic colleagues then in the Senate opposed Neil Gorsuch for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals because there was simply no reason to do so. In the decade since, Judge Gorsuch has written hundreds of opinions on the Constitution and innumerable laws. He has demonstrated that he actually reads the text carefully to get the right result. I am reminded that there is a difference between what we sometimes loosely call a strict constructionist and a textualist, and I would invite you to make that point during some of your testimony. As you can see here today, his jurisprudence reflects brilliance and humility, the humility of a man committed to the Constitution and the law. That body of work is the best guide for the kind of judge Judge Gorsuch will be. Answers to questions posed during these hearings we have already heard about specific issues cannot and should not be a guide. You are not a politician running for election, Judge, as you know. In the dissent I mentioned earlier, Justice Scalia warned that ``confirmation hearings for new Justices should deteriorate into question and answer sessions in which Senators go through a list of their constituents' most favored and most disfavored alleged constitutional rights.'' It should not be the forum in which you seek the nominee's commitment to support or oppose them. So we are not here to ask you, even though some might, how you will vote in specific cases. And it would be wrong for you to prejudge those cases, as you know. And that is the same reason why, for example, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, during her nomination hearing, said, ``A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecast, no hints, for that would not only show disregard for the specifics of a particular case, it would display disdain for the entire judicial process.'' Can you imagine what a litigant might think if the judge before whom he or she was to present their case said before they heard a word how they were going to decide the case? That is why it is improper for you, as you know, to prejudge cases in your testimony before the Committee, and our colleagues know that as well. But I expect them to ask a few questions nonetheless. Well, lately, we have heard from some that they should criticize you for failing to rule for a sympathetic constituency in one case or another. But of course, as you know, Judge, if you follow the law and the facts wherever it may lead, sometimes it is for the police. Sometimes for a criminal defendant. Sometimes it is for a corporation. Sometimes it is for an employee. Sometimes it is for the Government. Sometimes it is against the Government. That is how the rule of law works, and that is good for all Americans. One law professor at Harvard wrote, following the law regardless of the parties is, in the long run, it protects the little guy a lot better than a system rigged to favor one side. Because of your qualifications and a demonstrated record of following the law, other than a few special interest groups, I believe you have got a broad spectrum, really surprisingly broad spectrum of people supporting your nomination. One of your colleagues on the left wrote in The Washington Post, ``The Senate should confirm Judge Gorsuch because there is no principled reason to vote no.'' Another liberal constitutional scholar joined a letter that stated, ``Judge Gorsuch has the unusual combination of character, dedication, and intellect that will make him an asset on our Nation's highest court.'' President Obama's Solicitor General, from whom this Committee will hear, wrote in The New York Times that ``liberals should back Judge Gorsuch because he would live up to the promises to administer justice with respect to persons and to do equal right to the poor and to the rich.'' So, Mr. Chairman, the list goes on and on. So I am very pleased the American people are about to learn why President Trump chose you as his nominee for the Supreme Court. I look forward to hearing from Judge Gorsuch, and I would encourage my colleagues to carefully consider the nominee on the merits and nothing else. Thank you. Chairman Grassley. Thank you, Senator Cornyn. Now, Senator Durbin. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Senator Durbin. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Judge Gorsuch, welcome to you and your family. I have often read stories about earlier Supreme Court nominees and how little politics played any role in the selection and vetting of the nominees. Those of us on the Democratic side, as you can hear, are frequently warned not to let politics be part of this decision. When I consider the path to this historic hearing, this plea rings hollow. The journey began with the untimely death of Justice Scalia in February 2016. President Obama met his constitutionally required obligation by nominating Judge Merrick Garland to fill that vacancy in March 2016. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell announced that for the first time in the history of the United States Senate, he would refuse Judge Garland a hearing and a vote. He went further and said he would refuse to even meet with the judge. It was clear that Senator McConnell was making a political decision, hoping a Republican President would be elected. He was willing to ignore the tradition and precedent of the Senate so that you could sit at this witness table today. In May and September 2016, Republican Presidential candidate, Donald Trump, released a list of 21 names, including yours, that he would consider to fill the Scalia vacancy. President Trump thanked the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, two well-known Republican advocacy groups, for providing the list that included your name. Your nomination is part of a Republican strategy to capture our judicial branch of government. That is why the Senate Republicans kept the Supreme Court seat vacant more than a year, and why they left 30 judicial nominees, who had received bipartisan approval of this Committee, to die on the Senate calendar as President Obama left office. Despite all of this, you are entitled to be judged on the merits. The Democrats of the Senate Judiciary Committee will extend to you a courtesy which Senate Republicans denied to Judge Garland: a respectful hearing and a vote. Judge Gorsuch, you have been nominated to a lifetime appointment on the highest court in the land, and this Court has the final say on matters of fundamental importance affecting all Americans. You have a lengthy record before the Tenth Circuit, and we will ask many questions. We have found in the past that nominees try their best to dodge most of the questions, but it is our job to try to still seek the truth. At the nomination hearing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, my friend and predecessor, Senator Paul Simon, set forth the standard for Supreme Court nominees. I have noted this with each Supreme Court nominee that I have questioned. He said, ``You face a much harsher judge than this Committee, and that is the judgment of history, and that judgment is likely to revolve around the question, did you restrict freedom or did you expand it.'' Let me be clear. When I talk about expanding freedom, I am not talking about freedom for corporations. ``We the people'' does not include corporations. Senator Simon could never have imagined that the Supreme Court would give corporations rights and freedoms that were previously reserved only for individuals under the Constitution, and yet that is where we find ourselves with the Roberts Court. It is often said the Roberts Court is a corporate Court because of its pro-business tilt. A study by the Constitutional Accountability Center found that the Court ruled for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 69 percent of the time. The Court has certainly favored big business on issues like forced arbitration, corporate price fixing, workplace discrimination cases, just to name a few. But the Roberts Court has gone further than just ruling the way corporate America wants. In the 2010 Citizens United case, the Supreme Court held for the first time that corporations have the same rights as living, breathing people to spend money on elections, and that was followed in 2014 by the Hobby Lobby decision, which allowed for-profit corporations to discriminate against employees based on the corporation's assertion of religious belief. I do not recall ever seeing a corporation in the pews of Old St. Patrick's Church in Chicago. Our Founders never believed that corporations were endowed with certain inalienable rights, but were seeing the Supreme Court expand the rights of this legal fiction, a corporation, at the expense of the voices and choices of the American people. This strikes at the heart of the Supreme Court's promise to provide equal justice under the law. Judge Gorsuch, you took part in that Hobby Lobby case when it was before the Tenth Circuit. As I read the case, I was struck by the extraordinary, even painful, lengths the court went to protect the religious beliefs of the corporation and its wealthy owners, and how little attention was paid to the employees, to their constitutionally protected religious beliefs, their choices as individuals, and the burdens that the court's decision placed on them. I want to hear from you about a pattern I have seen in your decisions on the Tenth Circuit. In case after case, you either dismissed or rejected efforts by workers and families to recognize the rights--that recognized their rights or defend their freedoms. Cases like TransAm Trucking, which we have already spoken to. Alphonse Maddin. I had a chance to sit down with him just last week. He was the truck driver from Detroit who was driving around Chicago in the middle of January when a malfunction in his trailer froze the brakes, and he was forced to pull over on the side of the road. Al sat there on his cell phone with the dispatcher for the truck company, who told him do not leave this truck no matter what, and if you do, pull the trailer with you. Well, that was a big problem because the brakes were frozen, and it would have been a safety hazard. And so, he waited and waited, and the hours passed, and he started feeling numb and sick. You see, there was no heater in the truck, and, according to his recollection, it was so cold. It was 14 degrees below. Not as cold as your dissent, Judge Gorsuch, which argued that his firing was lawful. You cited a strict textualistic argument to make your point, but you chose the text that you focused on. Thank goodness the majority in this case pointed out that common sense and the Oxford Dictionary supported the majority view. Compass Environmental Incorporated, another one of your cases. Your dissent would have vacated a penalty against an employer who failed to train construction employee Christopher Carder to avoid the electrocution hazard that killed him. Strickland v. UPS, your dissent would have kept Carol Strickland's sex discrimination case from going to a jury, even though your fellow judges said she provided ample evidence that she was regularly outperforming her male colleagues and treated less favorably. I want to hear more about your views on fundamental individual rights that the Supreme Court is tasked to defend: the right to privacy, the right for all faiths to practice their religion, the right to vote, equal protection, and the rights of women. The Committee has received two letters from students who you taught last year that raised some serious concerns. Tomorrow we will get to the bottom of it, I hope. We have learned you were an aggressive defender of Executive power during the time of the Bush administration. In June 2004, after the Abu Ghraib torture scandal, I authored the first bill to ban cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of detainees. That legislation became the McCain Torture Amendment, which passed the Senate in December 2005 by an overwhelming 90-to-9 vote. But when President Bush signed the Amendment into law, he issued a signing statement claiming he had the authority to ignore the McCain Amendment. It turns out, you were deeply involved in this unprecedented signing statement. We need to know what you will do when you are called upon to stand up to this President or any President if he claims the power to ignore laws that protect fundamental human rights. You are going to have your hands full with this President. He is going to keep you busy. It is incumbent on any nominee to demonstrate that he or she will serve as an independent check or balance on the presidency. There are some warning flags. February 23rd, White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said, ``Neil Gorsuch represents the type of judge that has the vision of Donald Trump.'' I want to hear from you why Mr. Priebus would say that. Make no mistake, when it comes to the treatment of workers, women, victims of discrimination, people of minority religious faith, and our Constitution, most Americans question whether we need a Supreme Court Justice with the vision of Donald Trump. With my constitutional responsibility firmly in mind, I look forward to questioning tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Senator Durbin appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Grassley. Thank you, Senator Durbin. Now, the Senator from Utah. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL S. LEE, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Senator Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you Judge Gorsuch. Welcome to the Committee. I also want to welcome your friends, family members, supporters, former colleagues, and people you have worked with over the years who have come to show their support. I know they are proud of you, and they are proud of you not just because of what you have done and what you have accomplished professionally, but also because of who you are personally: a man of integrity, a man of great accomplishment, a man of character, and a man of faith. Everyone knows that a Supreme Court confirmation hearing can be dramatic, even emotional at times. The stakes are high. As Senators, we understand that there are a few things that are more important than the obligation that we are performing here than the duty that we are carrying out in connection with this process. These days it seems like standing for a confirmation hearing in the United States Senate after being nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States can appear a little bit like running for political office. As we have seen over the last few weeks, there are interest groups out there, some supporting you, some opposing you, out there waging campaigns almost as if they were running a campaign for someone pursuing public office. Maybe that is why, especially on this side of the dais, it can be easy to forget that a nominee is an ordinary citizen, perhaps not ordinary in the usual sense, but at least that person is not a politician. You, sir, are not a politician, which means that the acrimony, the duplicity, the ruthlessness of today's politics are still a little foreign to you, are still quite unfamiliar to you. I hope that they will remain unfamiliar to you. In a former life when I was a practicing attorney, I had the good fortune of appearing in front of you on the Tenth Circuit, and so I know from my own personal experience that you are one of the best judges in the country. You come to oral argument prepared, and you ask fair, probing questions that are designed to get at one thing and one thing only, which is what the law says and what the law requires in each individual case, depending on the facts and circumstances of that case. You are not there to promote a personal agenda or a political agenda, and you are not there to grandstand. You are there to listen to both sides of the argument in the case. You write thoughtful and rigorous opinions. They are careful, and they are well reasoned. And they are even interesting and pleasant to read, which is very difficult to achieve in the world of appellate litigation. Now, I know I am easily entertained. [Laughter.] Senator Lee. But I find your opinions particularly interesting. You have the resume of a Supreme Court Justice, but I think what is most impressive and, for our purposes, what is most important about your career and about the approach you take to the law, is your fierce independence from partisan influence and from any personal biases that you might otherwise be inclined to harbor. The judiciary is set apart from and, in a way, set far above the other branches in our republic, the other organs of our constitutional system, specifically because we allow it to invalidate and interpret the actions of the elected branches. So, we have got two branches of government that are political in that they are run by people who are elected and stand for re-election at regular intervals, thus, making themselves directly accountable to the American people. Our confidence in our entire system, including our confidence in the American judiciary, depends entirely on judges just like you, judges who are independent and whose only agenda is getting the law right, regardless of whether any particular judge, or any particular litigant, or any particular member of the public like--might like or dislike the outcome in that case. You are essential to making us accountable because unless you do your job right, were not held accountable because our laws do not stand. That is what makes your role, and your particular unique approach, and your particular unique commitment to this so important. Now, I want to take a moment to address some of the unique criticisms that you yourself, Judge Gorsuch, might be facing this week. I am sure that during this hearing some of my colleagues might claim that you are outside the mainstream. In fact, we have sadly heard some of that already today. We have heard arguments to the effect that you are an originalist, and we have heard assertions to the effect that originalism is somehow so far out of the mainstream, that it is dangerous. Well, I would remind my colleagues who have raised such concerns or who might be harboring them, that if this is the case, then they are going to have to acknowledge the fact that there is a pretty broad spectrum of people on the U.S. Supreme Court they might be painting with that brush. Justice Elena Kagan, before she was Justice Kagan, when she was standing before this Committee, in the second day of her confirmation hearings said, referring to the Founding Fathers and the need to figure out what the Founding Fathers understood about particular words, about how those particular words were used by the founding generation, said, ``Sometimes they laid down very specific rules. Sometimes they laid down broad principles. Either way, we apply what they tried to do. In that way, we are all originalists.'' That was on June 29th, 2010, before this Committee. Moreover, these out-of-the-mainstream arguments, out-of- the-mainstream approach, for addressing you, referring to you as an originalist, just does not stick. This is not a description that was attributed to you the last time you stood before this Committee and went through a confirmation process. Nowhere in the record is there any reference to you being outside the mainstream. In fact, your nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit was so remarkably uncontroversial that one Senator and only one Senator--Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina--was the only Member of this Committee who even bothered to show up at your confirmation hearing. Now, I would have been there, too, Judge. I was not yet a Member of the United States Senate. [Laughter.] Senator Lee. You were confirmed unanimously by voice vote without a single ``no'' vote. I am sure that some of my colleagues will question your independence because, in their view, perhaps you have not sufficiently criticized the comments made by some of today's politicians. Personally, I think you have made your views on this subject very clear. I am sure some of my colleagues will complain that you are not providing any hints as to how you might rule in any particular case. But that, however, is a reason for your confirmation, certainly not against it. In our system, judges do not provide advisory opinions. They do not make legislation, they do not legislate, they do not make law, they do not set policy, in the same sense that those things are made in the political branches. They decide cases and controversies only after each side has had the opportunity to make its case before the bench, and they do so outside the realm of political influence. In an odd twist, some of the same colleagues who will question your independence will also push you to answer questions that you simply cannot. I am sure that some of my colleagues will pick apart some of your rulings, and they will try to say that you are hostile to particular types of claims or to particular plaintiffs. I do not think it is productive to evaluate someone's judicial record by looking at who wins or who loses in his courtroom, at least outside the context of evaluating how the law was interpreted in that case. It goes without saying that in our system you face the same burden of convincing a court, regardless of who you are. And judges do not decide cases--they certainly should never decide cases--based on their own personal preferences. But to my colleagues who go down that road, the record shows with abundant clarity that you apply the law neutrally in all cases without regard to the parties. Finally, I would urge my colleagues to keep in mind that while Judge Gorsuch's reputation will not be affected by how we treat his confirmation, the same cannot always be said of the Senate. The night Judge Gorsuch was nominated, he said, ``The U.S. Senate is the greatest deliberative body in the world.'' I tend to agree, but these days it seems like this title is more of a challenge than an observation. It is more of an aspiration than a present sense description of reality. So, I hope we prove you right this week. Thank you very much, and I really look forward to hearing answers to the questions we will raise to you. [The prepared statement of Senator Lee appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Grassley. Thank you, Senator Lee. Now, Senator Whitehouse. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND Senator Whitehouse. Judge Gorsuch, welcome. As we discussed when we met, the question that faces me is, what happens when the Republicans get five appointees on the Supreme Court? I cannot help but notice the long array of 5-to-4 decisions, with all the Republican appointees lining up to change the law to the benefit of distinct interests: Republicans at the polls and big business pretty much everywhere. Let us look at the 5-to-4 decisions, first helping Republicans at the polls. All the Republican appointees' 5-to-4 decisions on election law favor Republicans at the polls, 6-to- 0. Helping Republicans gerrymander, paving the way for the Republican red map plan that won the House against the American majority in 2012, Gobeille, 5-to-4, all the Republican appointees. Helping Republican legislatures keep Democrat-leaning minorities away from the polls with targeted voter suppression laws, Shelby County, 5-to-4 all the Republicans; Bartlett v. Strickland, 5-to-4, all the Republicans. Helping corporate money flood elections and boost Republican candidates, McCutcheon, 5-to-4, all the Republicans, counting the concurrence; Bullock, 5-to-4 all the Republicans. And the infamous Citizens United decision, 5-to-4 all the Republicans. In each area, the Court made new law, 5-to-4, and each decision predictably helped Republicans win elections. At 6-to-0, it is a partisan route. Then look at cases that pit corporations against human beings. All the 5-to-4 Republican appointee decisions line up to help corporations against humans. Citizens United and the political money decisions should, again, count here. All three of them, 5-to-4, all the Republicans. Then come decisions to protect corporations who have harmed their employees. In pay discrimination, Ledbetter, 5-to-4 all the Republicans. In age discrimination, Gross, 5-to-4 all the Republicans. In harassment cases, Vance, 5-to-4, all the Republicans. In anti- retaliation cases, Nassar, yes, you guessed it, 5-to-4, all Republicans. Then there are the decisions that protect corporations from class action lawsuits. Wal-Mart v. Dukes, 5-to-4, and Comcast, 5-to-4, both all Republicans. Then there are decisions that help corporations steer customers away from juries and into corporate-friendly mandatory arbitration. Concepcion and Italian Colors Restaurant, both 5-to-4, both all Republicans. The Iqbal decision, 5-to-4, all Republicans, helped bar the courthouse door for all types of plaintiffs. All of this helps keep corporations away from juries, the one element of government hardest for corporations to control. Indeed, as you know, tampering with a jury is a crime. The Court also helps big business against unions. Harris v. Quinn, 5-to-4, all Republicans. Last year Friedrichs was teed up as a 5-to-4 body blow against unions when Justice Scalia died. With a new 5-to-4 Court, they will be back. Throw in Hobby Lobby. Corporations have religious rights that supersede healthcare for their employees, 5-to-4, all Republicans. Add Heller and McDonald, reanimating for gun manufacturers a legal theory a former Chief Justice once called a fraud, 5-to-4, all Republicans. Help insulate investment bankers from fraud claims? Why not? Janus Capital Group, 5-to-4, all Republicans. Chamber of Commerce v. EPA, gave corporate polluters an unprecedented victory, again 5-to-4, all Republicans. That is an easy 16-to-0 record for corporations against humans. To me, every time seems like a lot. There is no coincidence here. Big business has law groups out trolling for test cases to go get those cases before the friendly Court. The Republican politico-industrial complex piles in with amicus briefs and floods to tell the Republican appointees on the Court what it wants. Republican Justices are even starting to give hints so big business lawyers can rush to get certain cases up pronto to the Court. It is kind of a machine. Special interests set up and fund front groups. The front groups appear as amici before the Court. The amicus briefs or the front groups tell the Court what the special interests want. The Court follows the amicus briefs. The decision benefits the special interests, and the special interests pour more money to the front groups. On it goes like turning a crank. The biggest corporate lobby of them all is winning better than two-to-one at the Court. This 5-to-4 rampage is not driven by principle. Over and over, judicial principles, even so-called conservative ones, are overrun on the Court's road to the happy result. Stare decisis, that is a big laugh. These are law-changing decisions, many upending a century or more of law and pr"
