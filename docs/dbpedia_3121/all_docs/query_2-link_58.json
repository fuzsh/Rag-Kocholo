        "text": "In 1633, Crayford’s rector, Dr Thomas Vane was obliged by Charles I’s royal decree to read out the Book of Sports from his pulpit at St Paulinus. Elsewhere in Kent, The Rev. Richard ‘Blue Dick’ Culmer was appointed Vicar of Goodnestone and was suspended early in 1635 by Archbishop Laud for his refusal to follow Vane’s example and read the Book of Sports to his parishioners. Charles I’s attempt to impose the Book of Sports nationally enraged Puritans and stepped up the English Culture Wars of the 17th century.\n\n17th Century Culture Wars\n\nDuring the seventeenth century, the growing prevalence of Puritan Christianity in England led to a large-scale re-evaluation of English culture and values, and one of the biggest victims of this ideological shift was recreation on the Sabbath (Sundays). Puritan leaders tirelessly churned out sermons and pamphlets advising the people on how to please God, and one of their most common targets of criticism was anything deemed too frivolous or too distracting from scripture. This prompted Puritan preachers to call for steadfast abstinence from any kind of sport on the Sabbath day, as they believed that the day should be spent entirely in service to God. Dancing, vaulting, and even holiday celebrations were banned by many preachers who deemed them insulting to the almighty.\n\nUnsurprisingly, these ideas were not popular across England. Disputes rose between Puritans and the gentry, many of whom were Catholic and therefore concerned about the rising influence of Puritan Protestantism in England. In 1617, this dispute came to a head in Lancashire, forcing King James I to write a document known as the Declaration of Sports. This declaration protected the right of the people to pursue certain recreational activities on Sundays, provided they had attended church that day. In 1618, the Declaration was expanded to apply to the entire country. Initially, the King commanded that the Declaration be read aloud from the pulpit by all preachers, but the outcry from Puritans was so overwhelming that he was forced to abandon this idea.\n\nPrynne’s Histrio Mastix and the Reissue of the Book of Sports\n\nThis tension surrounding the Book of Sports rose again in 1633 when it was re-issued by James’s son Charles I. Shortly before the reissue of the Declaration, a Puritan author named William Prynne had published a work entitled ‘Histrio Mastix’ (a scourge for players)’, in which he asserted that the theatre, actors, and any who enjoyed watching performances–especially women–were under the influence of Satan and would be damned to hell. This was a thinly veiled attack on Charles’s wife, Queen Henrietta, who was a known lover of the theatre. In response, Charles arrested Prynne and sentenced him to life imprisonment, fined him heavily, and cut off his ears.\n\nHistrio Mastix at Marsh’s Library, Dublin.\n\nCRAY interviewed Dr Jason McElligott of Marsh’s Library Dublin about Prynne’s publication of Histrio Mastix. Jason mentioned Prynne’s obsessive need to add marginal references and comments to everything he wrote which led to his nickname: ‘Marginal Prynne’. He also told our young volunteers that the book was very boring and generations of readers had read only one page of it. This was the page that implied criticism of the Queen, Henrietta Maria, by Prynne attacking actresses through his description of them as ‘notorious whores’. Jason told us that the spine had been broken on this page as it was the only page anyone ever read.\n\nThe Culture Gap Widened with the Issue of the Book of Sports\n\nIt is possible that Charles chose to reissue the Declaration at this time to defend activities such as theatre, but whatever his reasons were, the result was catastrophic. The relationship between the King and Parliament was already strained, and his decision to reissue the Declaration only added fuel to the fire; many members of Parliament were Puritan, and it was believed by many that Charles’s sympathies were too Catholic. In defending the right of the people to pursue recreation on holy days, Charles directly defied the authority of Puritan preachers across the country and deepened the religious tensions that would eventually lead to war."
