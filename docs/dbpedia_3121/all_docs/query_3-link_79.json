        "text": "Overviews of the Prophecy of Isaiah\n\nThe following website postings, many of which encapsulate subjects already discussed, reiterate how Isaiah’s prophetic message relates to the geo-political configuration of our present world and how becoming familiar with it prepares us to participate in the events Isaiah predicts.\n\n1. Interpretation of Isaiah\n\nDefining Isaiah—The Man and His Message\n\nAs one might expect, a prophet who teaches a profusion of divine truths such as Isaiah is often also a cause of controversy. If his admonitions hit too close to home, or if the future he predicts looks too gloomy, let us take issue with it. Or, if we don’t want to bother with Isaiah at all, let us reduce his writings to a few “quaint symbolisms” of a non-threatening nature. Either way, by treating them lightly, we relieve ourselves of their relevance to us. Or do we? The fact is that Isaiah’s message will sooner or later affect all of humanity in a big way. So if we are willing to pay the price of learning it, it is just possible that a brighter spiritual horizon may open to our view.\n\nFrom New Testament times to America’s Founding Fathers, Isaiah has been the most often quoted prophet. Yet, the Christian version of him was born in an age of apostasy. Modern liberal scholarship—a profession of nonbelievers—has further distorted the man and his message. Precepts of men prevent people from receiving more of God’s word as Isaiah teaches it. If people haven’t heard something a thousand times, then it can’t be true. Although what they believe may have no basis of fact, they won’t search the scriptures to see if those things are so (Acts 17:11). Ought not a prophet who saw our day, who so eloquently spells it out, be our daily walk and talk?\n\nThe Book of Isaiah—New Scriptural Paradigm\n\nAny serious study of the scriptures must take into account the Book of Isaiah; and any serious study of the Book of Isaiah must take into account its literary features that are there in evidence. Those literary elements reveal an entirely different paradigm of what Isaiah’s message is all about than the one that has come down to us from past tradition. Besides Isaiah’s Seven-Part Structure, other holistic structures—layered one on top of another—reveal the inner workings of Isaiah’s writings and establish important prophetic concepts all their own. An entire series of interconnected events as well as a network of linking terms and ideas richly reward one’s inquiry.\n\nAs all new paradigms seem threatening and meet with opposition from those who have a vested interest in maintaining the old, so that is the case here. Anyone deeply investigating the Book of Isaiah in the light of its many literary features will incur the same response. As “a little knowledge is a dangerous thing,” moreover, and as “discretion is the better part of valor,” the real challenge is to learn the prophet’s message before attempting to convert souls to Isaiah. It takes several years of diligent effort to assimilate a paradigm so all-embracing and comprehensive as Isaiah’s and at the same time match it up with the current state of political and ecclesiastical affairs.\n\nReading in Context—An Interpretive Principle\n\nBuilt into Isaiah’s prophecy—and indeed into all scripture—are two different ways one may interpret them. The first is superficial, presumptive, and conceited. The second is in-depth, inquiring, and unassuming. That is one way God divides people—“rendering void the knowledge of their sages and the intelligence of their wise men insignificant” (Isaiah 29:14)—when the truth finally comes out. Besides inheriting a Christian tradition that bears little resemblance to the religion of Jesus, the modern world has inherited an entire array of scriptural interpretations that don’t reflect what their texts actually say. Particularly is that the case with the writings of Isaiah.\n\nOne of the first principles of scriptural interpretation is to read everything in context—meaning you can’t isolate even one word, verse, or idea and let that become a point of focus without taking into account all its interconnections and word links to other parts of the text. In Isaiah’s case, however, that principle extends to the entire book, as all its components—literary patterns, typologies, codenames, keywords, and concepts—are interwoven into one grand tapestry. These mechanics of Isaiah’s prophecy, in other words, preclude the casual reader from coming to understanding, even as they inspire a kind of divine awe in the reader who unravels them.\n\nHebrew Thinking—Typological, Not Logical\n\nWithout taking a leap of logic, the Western mind simply cannot comprehend the prophecy of Isaiah. Underlying the Hebrew worldview is that history is cyclical, not linear. We say history repeats itself, but the Hebrew prophets carry that idea one step further. As a case in point, Isaiah prophesies nothing new unless he bases it on something old. He predicts “the end from the beginning” (Isaiah 46:10) not simply by telling us what will happen at the end but by drawing on events that occurred in the beginning of Israel’s history that typify and foreshadow the end. In other words, the historical events Isaiah chooses to talk about form an allegory of the end-time.\n\nIsaiah can do this because he has seen the end from the beginning in a great cosmic vision—a vision of the past, present, and future. For that reason, he doesn’t attempt to talk about all the events of the past, only those that typify end-time events. In that way, he may be addressing people of his own day about matters familiar to them but at the same time be addressing people at the end of the world about things that will happen then. Isaiah, moreover, lived in perhaps the most portending period of Israel’s history, when many events of his day—such as the apostasy of God’s people and Assyria’s invasion of the Promised Land—would repeat themselves at the end.\n\nDistinguishing between Literal and Figurative\n\nNeither a wholly literal way of interpreting Isaiah’s prophecy nor a wholly figurative one has ever worked for uncovering its message. Isaiah’s use of metaphors, allegories, codenames, keywords, etc., often requires both a literal and figurative interpretation. His depiction of the king of Babylon’s aspiring to “make myself like the Most High [God],” then falling “from the heavens” and ending up in “the utmost depths of the Pit” (Isaiah 14:4, 12–16), for example, begs the question of whether Isaiah is talking about a primordial fallen angel. Yet, the ability of this tyrannical “man” to “ascend above the altitude of the clouds” (ibid.) is feasible given today’s technology.\n\nIn another instance, Isaiah recalls the events of Israel’s exodus out of Egypt: “Awake, arise; clothe yourself with power, O armof Jehovah! Bestir yourself, as in ancient times, as in generations of old. Was it not you who carved up Rahab, you who slew the dragon? Was it not you who dried up the Sea, the waters of the mighty deep, and made of ocean depths a way by which the redeemed might pass?” (Isaiah 51:9–10). While Isaiah here alludes to the angel of God who led the camp of Israel (Exodus 14:19; compare Isaiah 63:9–13), the context is an end-time exodus (Isaiah 51:11) led by God’s arm—his servant—whom God empowers to subdue the forces of chaos.\n\nThe Book of Isaiah—A Sealed Book Unsealed\n\nIt is no secret that for any practical purpose the Book of Isaiah has been a sealed book to most readers probably since the time of the prophet himself. Of course, its author—Isaiah—was not just aware of that but he purposely intended it to be so at the time he wrote it. It served a divine purpose of keeping his book unaltered, while those with eyes to see and ears to hear would comprehend much of it and thus increase their understanding. In fact, an ancient writing attributed to Isaiah affirms that the book which he “openly proclaimed”—that is, the Book of Isaiah—was written “in parables” or as an allegory so that not everyone would understand it (Ascension of Isaiah 4:20).\n\nGod commanded Isaiah to write it: “Go now, write on tablets concerning them; record it in a book for the end-time, as a testimony forever” (Isaiah 30:8). While the “tablets” or “plates” (luah) Isaiah wrote are yet to be found, his message is intended for the end-time: “In that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind see out of gross darkness” (Isaiah 29:18). As a type of other sealed books that are to be unsealed in the end-time, the Book of Isaiah—his “sealed book” (Isaiah 29:11)—thus harbors an important message for our day. Analysis of Isaiah’s Seven-Part Structure and other literary features has unsealed the greater part of it.\n\nThe Book of Isaiah—A Blueprint of Our Time\n\nWhat sets the Book of Isaiah apart from all other prophetic writings is its all-inclusiveness in depicting an end-time scenario. Even more comprehensive in portraying the end of the world than apocalyptic writings such as Daniel and Revelation, it spells out a great confluence of events humanity is about to experience. Using Israel’s ancient history as a foreshadowing of the end of the world, it predicts the future by drawing on events of the past. Only a prophet–poet with extraordinary literary skills could have predicted “the end” based on ancient beginnings (Isaiah 46:10). Only a visionary who saw both time periods could have crafted this prophetic masterpiece.\n\nWhile the Book of Isaiah’s apocalyptic message accords with Jewish tradition, and while its literary features reveal its twofold relevance—to Isaiah’s day and to the end-time—it still requires uncommon faith to believe that it is a handbook for our day. For one thing, it may mean discarding much or all of what we thought we knew before. Isaiah foresees just such confusion when he speaks of the deaf “hearing” and the blind “seeing” the words of his book. Only then—in a day when barely a few “disciples” would know its true message (Isaiah 8:16)—would “those who erred in spirit gain understanding and those who murmured accept instruction” (Isaiah 29:18, 24).\n\nEarth’s End-Time—History Repeating Itself\n\nA reassuring thing about Isaiah’s prophecy is that Isaiah limits himself to predicting new things based on old things when describing the end of the world. Over thirty ancient events—some that occurred before, some contemporary with, and some soon after Isaiah’s day—typify end-time events. To God’s people who know their history, who have searched Isaiah’s writings for answers, therefore, those events won’t appear unfamiliar when they unfold. To those who are acquainted with them and experience them, hindsight will turn to foresight. Perhaps that is one reason why God commanded his people to celebrate ancient events such as Israel’s Passover.\n\nOf course, when those former events repeat themselves in the end-time, they won’t do so in the order they occurred before nor take thousands of years. This time around, moreover, they will happen on a world scale and won’t be limited to the Jews in the State of Israel. While the ancient names that Isaiah uses to describe nations and persons function as codenames of end-time ones, they don’t apply to nations and persons with the same names today. Rather, a sure way to identify which nations or entities Isaiah is speaking of in today’s world is to be guided by the way Isaiah characterizes them and then to match them up with their possible modern counterparts.\n\nThe Domino Effect—Concealing the Message\n\nBecause Isaiah’s literary devices are meant to conceal and also reveal his prophetic message, much of that message remains hidden until uncovered by the sincere seeker of truth. One thing Isaiah conceals and reveals in this way is the actual sequence of end-time events leading up to the coming of Jehovah to reign on the earth. Instead of making it easy for the reader, therefore, he predicts things piecemeal, breaking up the sequence by depicting an event several times in combination with other events. The entire series appears only when we connect all the dominos. And they act like dominos also—befalling in rapid succession until all have transpired.\n\nA passage in Isaiah 49:9–12, for example, combines the end-time release of God’s people from bondage with their wandering in the wilderness and return from a worldwide exile: “To say to the captives, ‘Come forth!’ and to those in darkness, ‘Show yourselves!’ They shall feed along the way and find pasture on all barren heights. They shall not hunger or thirst, nor be smitten by the heat wave or the sun: he who has mercy on them will guide them; he will lead them by springs of water. All my mountain ranges I will appoint as roads; my highways shall be on high. See these, coming from afar, these, from the northwest, and these, from the land of Sinim.”\n\nGetting It Right—Isaiah’s Checks and Balances\n\nBecause Isaiah has permeated his prophecy with checks and balances, one rarely needs to second-guess his meaning. Seldom does Isaiah mention an event or idea just once, never to return to it. Rather, he frequently reiterates things in different contexts to ensure that the reader gets his message. Thus, Isaiah’s repeating events in different combinations with other events creates an entire web of interconnected events, which, taken together, define what he means by the end-time or end of the world. Such synchronized phenomena make the Book of Isaiah a literary work of extraordinary complexity that is at the same time simple when its literary keys are applied.\n\nLinking ideas establish definitions of terms and entire scenarios. In one place, Isaiah may predict a new exodus of God’s people out of Babylon (Isaiah 48:20–21). In another, he identifies “Babylon” as the world and its wicked inhabitants that God destroys in his Day of Judgment (Isaiah 13:1, 9, 11, 19). Elsewhere, he predicts that God’s people will return from throughout the earth at the time of a worldwide destruction (Isaiah 27:12–13). Further, God’s people’s exodus is from the four directions of the earth to Zion (Isaiah 43:5–6). Finally, he depicts remnants of all nations streaming to Zion in the “end-time,” giving us a time frame (Isaiah 2:2–3). And so forth.\n\nIsrael from National to Universal to Individual\n\nOne of several layered holistic literary structures of the Book of Isaiah—this one based on Egyptian narrative patterns—divides the book into Trouble at Home (Isaiah 1–39), Exile Abroad (Isaiah 40–54), and Happy Homecoming (Isaiah 55–66). These three different historical settings, rather than being grounds for multiple authors of the Book of Isaiah, demonstrate its literary integrity and show it to be the work of a single author, a prophet–poet who saw to the end of time. Coinciding with this literary division, Israel appears as a national entity in Isaiah 1–39, as a universal entity in Isaiah 40–54, and as an entity comprised of repentant individuals in Isaiah 55–66.\n\nIt is a national Israel—Israel still in its homeland—that finds itself in trouble for breaking the terms of God’s covenant. Israel’s exile abroad occurs as a consequence of its apostasy. All is not lost, however. Dispersion among and assimilation into the nations of the world has the effect of refining God’s people and renewing their cognizance of Israel’s spiritual heritage. Additionally, it provides a chance for the nations of the world to enter into God’s covenant together with Israel’s natural lineages. In the end, those who return and reconstitute a new nation of Israel called Zion consist of righteous individuals who come out of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and peoples.\n\nGod’s Threefold Test of His People’s Loyalty\n\nThree tests of loyalty determine who will live into a millennial age of peace. As God tried the loyalty of his people in the past, so he will again. Isaiah structures his writings according to a Mesopotamian literary pattern that depicts the three tests. We find a similar pattern of three tests the hero Odysseus must pass in the Greek legend The Odyssey. Isaiah’s king of Assyria presents the first. Will God’s people give him their allegiance or will they remain loyal to Israel’s God even on pain of death? Idolaters and their worldliness present the second—an enticement God’s people may succumb to without being aware. Ecclesiastical leaders’ abuse of authority forms the third.\n\nThe order of the three tests may be reversed from their sequence in the Book of Isaiah. Certain “brethren” who exercise ecclesiastical authority “abhor” and “exclude” persons who are vigilant for God’s word (Isaiah 66:5). In the end, however, God appoints as his priests and ministers those who suffer “shouted insults” and “twofold shame” for his sake (Isaiah 61:6–7). Spiritual blindness—resulting from an entrenched culture of materialism—makes God’s people trust in “gods that cannot save” when trouble looms (Isaiah 42:17–25; 44:9–21; 45:20). Lastly, the king of Assyria may conquer the whole world, but he and his ilk don’t prevail for long (Isaiah 10:5–27).\n\nHoly War Justified on What Spiritual Grounds?\n\nWhen Israel conquered the Promised Land anciently, its “holy war” (if we may call it that) occurred on several conditions. First, the iniquity of the inhabitants had to be full (Genesis 15:16); that is, such wickedness had to prevail in the land that the rising generation had little or no hope of growing up in righteousness. Second, the only valid reasons for making war with a people was self-defense or when commanded by God through a prophet like Moses (Numbers 21:10–35; 31:1–54). Third, the land had to be promised to God’s people’s ancestors by an unconditional covenant, as God had sworn to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Exodus 6:8; Deuteronomy 1:8).\n\nEven with these stipulations in place, however, God’s people couldn’t simply go and conquer their Promised Land. They themselves had to keep the terms of God’s covenant (the Sinai Covenant) as a nation in order to inherit it. The generation of God’s people that grew up in the wilderness, whom Moses taught the law of the covenant, qualified to inherit it. Just so, God’s end-time people conquer their promised lands: “Your sons shall hasten your ravagers away; those who ruined you shall depart from you” (Isaiah 49:17). When empowered by God’s “hand,” they “thresh mountains to dust and make chaff of hills” (Isaiah 41:10–16), speaking figuratively.\n\nAn “Assyrian” Identity for the Ten Lost Tribes\n\nIsaiah predicts that three branches of God’s people will live into a millennial age of peace: “In that day Israel shall be the third party to Egypt and to Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth. Jehovah of Hosts will bless them, saying, ‘Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance’” (Isaiah 19:24–25). Five cities in the land of “Egypt,” moreover, will in that day swear loyalty to Israel’s God and their inhabitants covenant with him by sacrifice. These covenanters appear to be the sole survivors when God smites Egypt with a civil war and a foreign invasion. In the end, God sends them a savior and heals Egypt (Isaiah 19:2–22).\n\nWhen Israel’s ten tribes of the Northern Kingdom went captive into Assyria in 722 B.C. (2 Kings 15:29; 17:6), they disappeared from known historical records. The emergence of an end-time people of God called “Assyria”—which parallels the similar emergence of an end-time people of God called “Egypt”—thus implies that those of end-time Assyria who survive God’s Day of Judgment consist of the descendants of those who were taken captive into ancient Assyria. While the Assyrian armies who conquer the world ultimately perish (Isaiah 10:16–18, 24–26; 14:24–27; 30:30–32; 31:8–9), these “Assyrians,” whose names are “recorded,” survive (Isaiah 10:19).\n\n2. Historical Background\n\nJehovah’s Commission of Isaiah as a Prophet\n\nIsaiah receives his commission as a prophet to God’s people Israel “in the year of King Uzziah’s death” (742 B.C.), when he sees Jehovah “seated on a throne, highly exalted, the skirt of his robe filling the sanctuary” (Isaiah 6:1). Jehovah appoints him to “say to these people, ‘Go on hearing, but not understanding; Go on seeing, but not perceiving’” (Isaiah 6:9), signifying that his people as a whole are already beyond the point where an appeal to repentance might restore them to righteousness. The prognosis is that in spite of his best efforts their “cities will lie desolate and without inhabitant, the houses without a man, and the land ravaged to ruin” (Isaiah 6:11).\n\nThe purpose of Isaiah’s call nevertheless emerges from the pages of his prophecy. First, a remnant of God’s people, consisting of Jehovah’s “disciples” (Isaiah 8:16), heeds Isaiah’s appeal to repent. They survive the destruction God’s people as a whole are bringing upon themselves by their collective guilt (Isaiah 8:13–15). Second, Isaiah’s prophecy will have a dual fulfillment, one in his own day and another at the end of the world. That second fulfillment, however, will prove more portentous than the first. Requiring people to exercise faith in an ancient writing that predicts their day seems an ingenious way of identifying a repentant remnant of God’s people.\n\nActual Text as Opposed to Historical Origins\n\nIn their zeal to publish articles and books for the motive of gaining academic tenure or notoriety in their field, liberal scholars have paid much attention to the “historical origins” of the Book of Isaiah rather than to its message. In other words, they have focused on Isaiah’s role as a historian instead of as a prophet of God. Although the setting in which Isaiah prophesies helps verify historical events, those events themselves don’t address God’s intent in speaking through his prophet. To convey his divine message, for example, Isaiah records historical incidents and events only selectively, so that on that basis he could not even be considered a good historian.\n\nAs a case in point, King Hezekiah’s historical actions vary somewhat from the way Isaiah presents them. The biblical record reveals the king’s ambivalence in how he responds to Assyria’s invasion of Judea: (1) by paying tribute to the Assyrian King Sennacherib yet preparing to defend himself against him (2 Kings 18:13–16; 2 Chronicles 32:1–6); and (2) by trusting in Jehovah his God to deliver him and his people from the Assyrians (2 Kings 19:15–19; 2 Chronicles 32:7–8). As the type of a similar deliverance from an end-time “Assyrian” invasion of God’s people’s land, only Hezekiah’s second response appears in the Book of Isaiah (Isaiah 36:1–38:7).\n\nThe Divided Kingdom—A National Tragedy\n\nA divisive spirit among Israel’s twelve tribes extends back to Jacob’s twelve sons themselves, particularly in their hatred of Joseph and their desire to kill him, although Judah persuades them to sell him (Genesis 37). Disputes among the tribes arise in the era of Israel’s judges, as when the prideful Ephraimites balk at Gideon’s miraculous victory over the hosts of Midian and Amalek (Judges 7:1–8:1); or when the tribe of Benjamin slays tens of thousands of Israelites in defense of its own lewdness (Judges 19–20). After the death of Saul, its first king, Israel divides into northern and southern tribes, although seven years later David heals their rift (2 Samuel 1–5).\n\nWhen Solomon’s son Rehoboam raises Israel’s taxes against the advice of his elders, Israel’s ten northern tribes install Solomon’s Ephraimite servant Jeroboam as their king. From that time forward, Rehoboam and succeeding generations of kings of David’s lineage rule only over the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and the priestly tribe of Levi. A few remnants of Israel’s ten tribes who abhor Jeroboam’s idolatry in the Northern Kingdom additionally flee to the Southern Kingdom of Judah where the worship of Israel’s God Jehovah is maintained (1 Kings 12; 2 Chronicles 11:5–17). Israel’s division into separate entities continues even after they go into exile.\n\nThe Davidic Dynasty—A Monarchy in Stone\n\nWhen the kings of Aram (Syria) and Ephraim (the Northern Kingdom of Israel) seek to replace King Ahaz of the Southern Kingdom of Judah with a king who isn’t of the lineage of David, Isaiah categorically informs Ahaz that such a thing can’t happen (Isaiah 7:1–7). Although Ahaz endangers the lives of his people through his disloyal actions (Isaiah 7:17–25), nothing can void God’s unconditional covenant with his ancestor David of an enduring dynasty to rule on David’s throne (2 Samuel 7:16; Psalms 132:11–18). Even upon Israel exile, God transplants David’s heirs to other lands (Ezekiel 17:22–23). From there, moreover, they are someday to return:\n\n“Thus says Jehovah, ‘David shall never want a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel. . . . If you can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night, that there should not be day and night in their season, Then may my covenant also be broken with my servant David that he should not have a son to reign on his throne. . . . As the hosts of heaven can’t be numbered, nor the sands of the sea measured, so will I multiply the offspring of my servant David’” (Jeremiah 33:17, 20–22); “There shall enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he and his servants and his people” (Jeremiah 22:4).\n\nKing Ahaz’ Response to Assyria’s Hegemony\n\nNeo-Assyrian expansion in the ancient Near East commences its most aggressive phase under Tiglath-Pileser III (747–727 B.C.). His incursions into Syria and Palestine put on edge local kings such as Ahaz, who ruled Judea. Syria’s King Rezin and the Northern Kingdom of Israel’s King Pekah seek to bring Judea into an alliance against Assyria’s domination of the Levant. Ahaz’ refusal leads to these kings’ military incursion into Judea and their slaughter of Ahaz’ people (2 Kings 16:5; 2 Chronicles 28:5–7). Isaiah notes Ahaz’ fear: “The king’s mind and the minds of his people were shaken, as trees in a forest are shaken by a gale” (Isaiah 7:2).\n\nInstead of joining these kings’ alliance, Ahaz appeals to Tiglath-Pileser to deliver him from them. Calling himself his “servant and son”—paying him tribute moneys with the temple’s gold and silver—he makes himself his vassal (2 Kings 16:7–8). By structurally paralleling Ahaz’ disloyal response to Jehovah under the terms of the Davidic Covenant with King Hezekiah’s loyal response at a similar instance of Assyrian aggression a generation later, Part II of Isaiah’s Seven-Part Structure (Isaiah 6–8; 36–40 foreshadows a repeat performance of these events: two end-time Davidic kings—contemporaries—react in opposite ways to the same “Assyrian” threat.\n\nKing Hezekiah’s Response to Assyria’s Threat\n\nOn the heels of revolts by vassal states against Assyrian rule, Sennacherib (704–681 B.C.) invades Syria and Palestine in 701 B.C., the fourteenth year of the reign of Judea’s King Hezekiah. Sennacherib claims to have captured 46 walled cities of Judea, including the fortress of Lachish (2 Kings 18:13; 2 Chronicles 32:9; ANET, 287–88; ANEP, 371–74). Although a few years earlier the Northern Kingdom of Israel had fallen to Assyria, Hezekiah revolts and prepares his people to defend themselves against Assyria in Jerusalem (2 Kings 18:7; 2 Chronicles 32:1–8). Paying off Sennacherib with tribute moneys (2 Kings 18:14–16) purchases him time to prepare.\n\nAt Assyria’s siege of Jerusalem, Hezekiah and Isaiah appeal to Jehovah to deliver the people who have taken refuge there (2 Kings 19:1–4, 15–19; 2 Chronicles 32:20). Isaiah’s version of these events in Part II of his Seven-Part Structure (Isaiah 6–8; 36–40) focuses on Hezekiah’s loyal response to Jehovah under the terms of the Davidic Covenant, causing Jehovah to deliver him and his people from the Assyrians (Isaiah 37:30–36). By linking Hezekiah’s suffering of a mortal illness to Jehovah’s promise of his people’s deliverance (Isaiah 38:2–6), Isaiah emphasizes Hezekiah’s spiritual role as a proxy savior of his people rather than his political role.\n\nStoried Connections between Egypt and Israel\n\nAbram (Abraham) arrives in the Land of Canaan from Haran in northwestern Mesopotamia only to find that the famine he leaves behind prevails there also. When he continues south to Egypt, Pharaoh showers him with gifts, but he also takes Sarai (Sarah), returning her to him only when he discovers she is Abram’s wife (Genesis 12). When Joseph—whom his brothers sell into Egypt—interprets Pharaoh’s dreams of seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine, Pharaoh appoints him vice-regent of all Egypt. Soon after the same famine hits the Land of Canaan, Joseph’s brothers and father Jacob find livelihood with Joseph in Egypt (Genesis 37, 39–47).\n\nThereafter, Egypt provides a refuge for Jacob’s descendants for 400 years (Genesis 15:13; Exodus 12:40). In a manner of speaking, Egypt gives birth to Israel as a nation at their exodus out of Egypt when Jehovah covenants with Jacob’s descendants to be their God and they his people (Exodus 6:7; Leviticus 26:12–13). Throughout biblical history, Egypt continues to be a haven for Israel’s refugees (1 Kings 11:40; 2 Kings 25:26; Jeremiah 26:20–21; Matthew 2:13–14). Still, Isaiah decries his people’s reliance on Egypt instead of on Jehovah when enemies threaten (Isaiah 30:1–5; 31:1–3), and Jeremiah reprimands the Jews who escape there (Jeremiah 42–44).\n\nAssyria—Conqueror of the Ancient Near East\n\nAssyrian domination of the ancient Near East has its beginnings in the early Middle Assyrian Period (1274–1077 B.C.). The Neo-Assyrian Period, however (911–612 B.C.), sees Assyria reach its zenith as a world power. Prominent among Assyrian conquerors are Assurnassirpal II (883–859 B.C.), who captures Aramean and Phoenician territories; Shalmaneser III (858–824), who expands Assyrian rule westward; Tiglath-Pileser III (747–727 B.C.), who makes himself king of Babylon and whose army reaches as far south as Gaza; Shalmaneser V (727–722 B.C.) and Sargon II (721–705 B.C.), whose military campaigns end the Northern Kingdom of Israel.\n\nIn Isaiah’s day, Sennacherib (704–681 B.C.) invades Judea but fails to take Jerusalem. His son Esarhaddon (680–669 B.C.) and grandson Assurbanipal (668–667 B.C.) conquer major cities in Egypt. Assyria is a militaristic world power, not a civilizing one. It sets a precedent as conqueror of the ancient world, which Isaiah uses as the type of an end-time “Assyria” that similarly conquers the world. He depicts Assyria as “a nation dreaded far and wide, a people continually infringing” (Isaiah 18:2, 7). Its demise begins with a repeat performance of King Hezekiah’s intercession with Jehovah on behalf of his people when Assyria besieges Jerusalem.\n\nAssyria’s Exile of Israel’s Ten Northern Tribes\n\nFrom the time Israel’s northern tribes break away from the southern tribes of Judah, the history of the Northern Kingdom of Israel consists of one continuous round of coups and assassinations as individuals rise up and usurp power. Israel’s instability during almost its entire history stems from the worship of idols that Jeroboam, its first king, institutes that is maintained thereafter: God cannot bless and prosper those who “do not believe in Jehovah their God” but who instead “serve idols,” who “go after the heathen round about” and “become vain” like them, who “provoke Jehovah to anger” until he “removes them out of his sight” (2 Kings 17:7–17).\n\nWhen Assyrian expansion threatens the region toward the end of the Northern Kingdom, Menahem submits to vassalship (2 Kings 15:19). Pekah, however, allies himself with Rezin of Aram (Syria) to resist Assyria (Isaiah 7:1). In their day, the Assyrian Tiglath Pileser III captures a large portion of Israel and deports its inhabitants to Assyria (2 Kings 15:29). Israel’s last king, Hoshea, assassinates Pekah and at first submits to vassalship. But he then rebels and appeals in vain to Egypt for help (2 Kings 17:3–4). Finally, in 722 B.C., Shalmaneser V and his successor Sargon II take Samaria and remove Israel’s captives to Assyria (2 Kings 17:6; 18:9–10).\n\nBabylon’s Exile of the Jewish Southern Tribes\n\nA turning point for the Southern Kingdom of Judah occurs in the reign of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah. When he sets up idols for his people and “seduce[s] them to do more evil than did the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the people of Israel” (2 Kings 21:9), Jehovah declares he will make them “a prey and a spoil to all their enemies” (2 Kings 21:14). He will “cause them to be removed to all kingdoms on the earth because of Manasseh,” who “shed innocent blood” in Jerusalem “from one end to the other” (2 Kings 21:16; Jeremiah 15:4). Other misfortunes that happen in Judea, too, are blamed on “the sins of Manasseh” (2 Kings 24:1–4).\n\nJudea’s fall occurs during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, at the height of Neo-Babylonian expansion. In 597 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar lays siege to Jerusalem and takes its king, leading citizens, and craftsmen captive to Babylon. He pillages the temple of treasures accumulated from the time of King Solomon and installs Zedekiah as his vassal (2 Kings 24:10–17). In spite of warnings by Jeremiah to remain loyal to Nebuchadnezzar, after nine years Zedekiah rebels, leading to another siege of Jerusalem (2 Kings 25:1–2; Jeremiah 27:12–13; 38:17–18). In 586 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar takes the city and deports all but its poor to Babylon.\n\nThe Ascendancy of Cyrus and Fall of Babylon\n\nBy 550 B.C., Cyrus II’s consolidation of the Medes and Persians, and his benevolent administrative abilities—in which he improves the infrastructures of conquered nations—lead to the formation of a Persian Empire that continues for over 200 years. Cyrus first expands westward, taking Assyria in northern Mesopotamia, Cilicia, and large parts of Asia Minor, including the Lydian capital of Sardis and Greek Ionia. He then sets his sights on Babylon, seat of the Neo-Babylon Empire that replaced Assyria. After reinforcing local elements opposed to Nabonidus king of Babylon, Cyrus leads his army into the city in 539 B.C. and takes it without a fight.\n\nCyrus divides his now extensive realm into twenty satrapies—provincial administrative areas that govern local communities headed by nobles who swear allegiance to Cyrus. Their semi-autonomy, and Cyrus’ respect for local customs, constitutes a reprieve from the Assyrian and Babylonian empires’ autocratic rule. Cyrus’ further decree that permits peoples who had been taken captive into Babylon to return to their homelands wins him notoriety, especially among the Jews who had been exiled seventy years earlier. Thousands return to Jerusalem and rebuild its temple. These become the Jewish nation that inhabits Palestine in New Testament times.\n\nThe Return of the Jews from Exile in Babylon\n\nCyrus’ decree as Persian emperor that the Jews deported to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar may return to their homeland fulfills Jeremiah’s prediction of a seventy-year Jewish exile (Jeremiah 25:8–13; 29:10; Daniel 9:2; 2 Chronicles 36:21–23). Over forty-two thousand return with the temple’s former treasures to rebuild Jerusalem and its temple (Ezra 1:5–11; 2:64). Led by Yeshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the governor, they rebuild the altar, offer sacrifices, and resume observance of Israel’s feastdays and religious worship. They then reestablish the order of the priests and Levites and lay the second temple’s foundation (Ezra 3:2–5, 8–11).\n\nBecause of opposition from local and surrounding peoples who inhabit the land, however (Ezra 4), work on the temple doesn’t begin in earnest until some twenty years later during the reign of Darius, about 520 B.C. With the encouragement of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, the people, led by Zerubbabel and Yeshua, finally complete the temple (Ezra 5–6). During the reign of Artaxerxes, another migration of Jews from Babylon accompanies Ezra the scribe (Ezra 7–8), who helps the Jewish community rebuild (Ezra 9–10). Under the leadership of Nehemiah, a returnee sent by Artaxerxes, Jerusalem’s walls, too, are ultimately rebuilt (Nehemiah 2–6).\n\nForty Years of Isaiah’s Ministry as a Prophet\n\nIsaiah’s prophetic ministry begins in 742 B.C. at Jehovah’s appearance to him in the temple. Jehovah forewarns him, however, that his people’s reception of him won’t be favorable (Isaiah 6:1–13). Isaiah nevertheless faithfully performs his role as Jehovah’s oracle. As was the custom, his early prophecies are likely spoken inside the gates of Jerusalem or its temple in the hearing of Judah’s elders (compare Joshua 20:4; Jeremiah 7:2). Isaiah’s giving his sons prophetic names during Ahaz’ unrighteous rule, however (Isaiah 7:3; 8:3, 18), indicates that at times he is prevented from openly declaring his people’s evils and their consequence (compare Isaiah 8:16–17).\n\nWhile Isaiah’s early ministry is to “both houses of Israel” (Isaiah 8:14), the Northern Kingdom falls to Assyria in 722 B.C. in the sixth year of the reign of King Hezekiah, Ahaz’ son (2 Kings 18:10). Hezekiah’s appeal to Isaiah at Assyria’s siege of Jerusalem in 701 B.C., and his own intercession with Jehovah on behalf of his people (Isaiah 37:1–5, 15–20), show Hezekiah’s righteousness. During Hezekiah’s reign, following a great vision of the end from the beginning (Sirach 48:22–25), Isaiah writes the second half of his prophecies. Although the two dates relating to Isaiah are forty-one years apart, his ministry may have lasted as long as fifty-five years.\n\nIsaiah’s Execution at the Hands of Manasseh\n\nWhile Paul makes a veiled allusion to the manner of Isaiah’s death through being “sawn asunder” (Hebrews 11:37), an ancient document, the Ascension of Isaiah, depicts Isaiah’s being sawn in half by King Hezekiah’s son Manasseh (Ascension of Isaiah 5:1, 11). Manasseh is there depicted as possessed from his youth by the spirit of Satan, who harbors great wrath toward Isaiah on account of his prophecies (Ascension of Isaiah 2:2; 3:13; 5:1, 15–16). Although Isaiah and his prophet associates escape to a mountain and subsist on wild herbs, after two years his accusers discover them and betray Isaiah to Manasseh (Ascension of Isaiah 2:7–11; 3:1, 6–12).\n\nThe Ascension of Isaiah further describes the ascent of Isaiah’s spirit up through several lower heavens to the seventh, where he sees God and the “Beloved” who is to descend to this earth (Ascension of Isaiah 6–11; compare Isaiah 5:1). What stands out is that Isaiah’s theology of ascent and his end-time prophecy as revealed in his Seven-Part Structure and other literary features embedded in the Book of Isaiah accord in almost every respect with those of the Ascension of Isaiah. In that document, Isaiah describes his book as being written in “parables” (Ascension of Isaiah 4:20). Indeed, his book’s literary features require one to read it as allegory, not as history.\n\n3. God’s Day of Judgment\n\nIsaiah’s Apocalyptic Vision of the End-Time\n\nBy characterizing his book as a single “vision” (Isaiah 1:1) and claiming to “foretell the end from the beginning” (Isaiah 46:10), Isaiah is evidently giving his own interpretive guidelines that he expects readers to follow. If they don’t, very likely they won’t understand his message. Indeed, synchronous holistic literary structures in the Book of Isaiah, such as Isaiah’s Seven-Part Structure, require readers to view his book synchronously or as depicting a single scenario. Although grounded in historical events that occurred in Isaiah’s day and shortly thereafter, such events, without taking away from their historical origins, additionally portend end-time events.\n\nBut how did Isaiah come to have such an amazing apocalyptic vision? And how was he able to use historical events so selectively that they foreshadow such an end-time scenario? One answer may be that he lived in a portentous time of history, when many world events paralleled events that would occur in the end-time. Another may be that after serving forty years as a prophet from the time Jehovah appointed him (Isaiah 6), he had an apocalyptic vision in which he saw to the end of time (Isaiah 40). Assigned a new role, one similar to the seraphs who had ministered to him, Isaiah wrote new prophecies and reworked former ones into a single end-time “vision.”\n\nPolitical and Religious Leadership in Parallel\n\nA recurring pattern in Isaiah’s descriptions of both ancient and end-time events is that the political and ecclesiastical affairs of God’s people parallel one another both for good and for evil. That becomes particularly apparent in the leadership of God’s people as God’s Day of Judgment approaches: “Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm top and reed, in a single day; the elders or notables are the head, the prophets who teach falsehoods, the tail. The leaders of these people have misled them, and those who are led are confused” (Isaiah 9:14–16). Only when God’s people again keep his law and word can the millennial age commence (Isaiah 2:3–4).\n\nFor a time, however, God allows dark days to prevail to try his people’s loyalties: “As for my people, babes subject them; women wield authority over them. O my people, your leaders mislead you, abolishing your traditional ways” (Isaiah 3:12); “The godless utter blasphemy; their heart ponders impiety: how to practice hypocrisy and preach perverse things about Jehovah, leaving the hungry soul empty, depriving the thirsty soulof drink” (Isaiah 32:6). Before Zion forms, God comes out in judgment against his “enemies”—that is, against his people’s leaders: “Woe to them! I will relieve me of my adversaries, avenge me of my enemies” (Isaiah 1:23–24).\n\nLies and Falsehoods Test People’s Loyalties\n\nA paradox of life is that God allows lies and falsehoods to exist alongside the truth. Often, the truth of God’s “good news” lies buried beneath a heap of misrepresentations, while the purveyors of these falsehoods cast in a bad light those who adhere to the truth. The Accuser makes sure that those whose lifestyles are less than impeccable will fall prey to his deceptions, while persons who desire to know the truth will discover it for themselves. When Jesus says of the end-time that, if it were possible, the very elect would be deceived (Matthew 24:24), he at once defines the elect as those who have processed through the lies and can no longer be deceived.\n\nAccording to Isaiah, leaders who mislead and prophets who deceive will be the order of the day (Isaiah 9:15–16; 28:7, 15; 32:6). The poor and needy—God’s favored candidates for his covenant people (Isaiah 14:30; 25:4)—are also the favored targets of his people’s reprobates: “Rogues scheme by malevolent means and insidious devices to ruin the poor, and with false slogans and accusations to denounce the needy” (Isaiah 32:7). Lies predominate in the time that precedes Jehovah’s coming to cleanse the earth of wickedness: “[He comes]to sift the nations in the sieveof falsehood; with an erring bridleon their jaws [he will try]the peoples” (Isaiah 30:28).\n\nThree Years’ Warning Followed by Judgment\n\nAs “God will do nothing unless he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets” (Amos 3:7), he gives ample warning before cleansing the earth of wickedness—in the end-time as anciently. In Isaiah’s day, for example, God commands Isaiah to go naked and barefoot for three years as a portent of Assyria’s invasion of Egypt (Isaiah 20:2–4). (Not known for being politically correct by modern standards, God ever leaves room for doubters to spurn his warnings.) Similarly, God gives Moab, a kindred people, three years’ warning—“like the term of a lease”—before Moab’s glory turns to shame, its large populace perishes, and but few inhabitants remain (Isaiah 16:14).\n\nIsaiah’s Seven-Part Structure, however, makes both Egypt and Moab integral parts of a multinational conglomerate of foreign powers that come under a “Babylon” umbrella. This Greater Babylon—akin to John’s Babylon the Great (Revelation 17:5)—goes into the dust at the time Zion rises from the dust (Isaiah 47:1; 52:1–2). For a time, a righteous remnant of God’s people dwells in the wilderness, surviving on nomads’ food (Isaiah 7:14–15, 21–22; 37:30). As the events of the past that Isaiah records function as types or patterns of end-time events, this scenario will repeat itself when God destroys end-time “Babylon” and delivers his people Zion.\n\nThe Day of Jehovah—God’s Day of Judgment\n\nWhether they lived before or after Israel’s exile from the Promised Land, the Hebrew prophets predict a great future “Day of Jehovah” or “Day of the Lord” upon all nations (Isaiah 13:6, 9; Jeremiah 46:10; Ezekiel 30:3; Joel 2:1, 11, 31; Amos 5:18, 20; Obadiah 1:15; Zephaniah 1:7, 14, 18; Zechariah 14:1; Malachi 4:1, 5). This Day of Judgment upon a wicked world will come “as a violent blow from the Almighty,” “as a cruel outburst of anger and wrath to make the earth a desolation, that sinners may be annihilated from it” (Isaiah 13:6, 9). Precedents from the past—such as Assyria’s world conquest in Isaiah’s day—typify that great and dreadful end-time event.\n\nJohn’s vision of “the Lord’s day” or “Day of the Lord” (Revelation 1:10) depicts the same events. Whereas Isaiah encodes his end-time vision in the historical events of his day, John encodes it in imagery. When you match up the characters, you see that both describe the same end-time scenario. The “great whore” that “corrupts the earth with her fornications” (Revelation 19:2) is the harlot Babylon who rules as “Mistress of Kingdoms” (Isaiah 47:5–8). The woman who flees into the wilderness for three and a half years (Revelation 12:6) is the Virgin Daughter of Zion who flees destruction in an exodus out of Babylon (Isaiah 52:1, 11–12). And so forth.\n\nDoing the Unexpected—A Way of Dividing\n\nWhile Isaiah predicts “sudden ruin such as you have not imagined” for the harlot Babylon who rules the nations (Isaiah 47:11; compare Revelation 17:1–5), he predicts the same for God’s people whose wickedness puts them in the same category as Babylon. But before God’s Day of Judgment arrives—before the heavens “vanish as by smoke” and the earth’s inhabitants “die in the manner of vermin”—God gives the world a chance to repent: “The law shall go forth from me, and my precepts shall be a light to the peoples. Then, suddenly, I will act” (Isaiah 51:4, 6). Those who prove righteous participate in an exodus to Zion even while the wicked perish (Isaiah 51:7–12).\n\nSo inured do many of God’s people become toward him, however, that they grow derelict in their duties: “You have heard the whole vision; how is it you do not proclaim it? Yet as of now, I announce to you new things, things withheld and unknown to you, things now coming into being, not hitherto, things you have not heard of before, lest you should say, ‘Indeed I knew them!’ You have not heard them, nor have you known them; before this your ears have not been open to them” (Isaiah 48:6–8). At that point, God “annuls the predictions of impostors and makes fools of diviners,” he “turns wise men about and makes nonsense of their knowledge” (Isaiah 44:25).\n\nGod’s People—Catalyst of God’s Judgments\n\nBelievers in the scriptures understand that the world will be destroyed and cleansed of the wicked before Jehovah’s coming to reign on the earth. But do they know what precipitates such destruction? Patterns from the past tell us what to look for that will signal the commencement of God’s end-time judgments. Paul draws on the prophecies of Isaiah when he says that those events won’t happen until “there comes a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the Son of Perdition” (2 Thessalonians 2:3). Isaiah uses models or types from ancient Near Eastern history and mythology to describe this end-time Antichrist as the “king of Babylon” (Isaiah 14:3–21).\n\nIsaiah also makes clear that it is the “falling away” of God’s people that precipitates the world’s destruction by the king of Assyria/Babylon. (Assyrian conquerors of Babylon in Isaiah’s day called themselves “King of Babylon.”) Former destructions of the ancient world—first by Assyria and then by Babylon—occurred only when God’s people of the northern and southern kingdoms of Israel had apostatized. Those who profess to be God’s people today, therefore, fall into this pattern before God’s end-time judgments commence. If it were not so, the archtyrant could have no power. He is merely God’s instrument for destroying the wicked from the earth.\n\nA Pattern of World Conquerors from the North\n\nBoth the Assyrians and Babylonians who ruthlessly conquer the ancient world hail from the North in relation to God’s people Israel when they turn to wickedness. Those successive events establish a pattern that repeats itself before Jehovah comes to the earth to institute his millennial reign of peace. This time, however, it isn’t the ten-tribed Northern Kingdom of Israel or the Southern Kingdom of Judah that suffers invasion and destruction by an aggressive world power but God’s people who turn to wickedness in the modern world. This time it is an end-time world power from the North that overruns the world, following the pattern of those ancient events.\n\nWhen his end-time people attain the same level of wickedness Israel did of old, God responds the same way he did then: “Hail the Assyrian, the rodof my anger! He is a staff—my wrathin their hand. I will commission him against a godless nation, appoint him over the people [deserving]of my vengeance, to pillage for plunder, to spoliate for spoil, to tread underfoot like mud in the streets. Nevertheless, it shall not seem so to him; this shall not be what he has in mind. His purpose shall be to annihilate and to exterminate nations not a few” (Isaiah 10:5–7). “From the North shall come [pillars of]smoke, and no place he has designated shall evade it” (Isaiah 14:31).\n\nThe King of Assyria/Babylon—An Antichrist\n\nIsaiah’s version of an end-time Antichrist is the king of Assyria/Babylon, whom Isaiah portrays as a composite of types; that is, he combines several precedents of ancient tyrannical rulers to project a single end-time one—an all-time archtyrant. Setting a precedent for world conquerors from the North are the kings of Assyria (Isaiah 10:5–14; 37:18, 21–27). To that type, Isaiah adds the “king of Babylon,” perhaps the same world conqueror from the North but one who styles himself as a demi-god and who exemplifies Babylon’s idolatrous ideology (Isaiah 14:3–21; 47:1–8). In the end, however, the archtyrant perishes because of the loyalty of God’s elect.\n\nIsaiah thus predicts that in that day those who survive destruction will rejoice: “How the tyrant has met his end and tyranny ceased! Jehovah has broken the staffof the wicked, the rodof those who ruled—him who with unerring blows struck down the nations in anger, who subdued peoples in his wrath by relentless oppression. Now the whole earth is at rest and at peace; there is jubilant celebration!” (Isaiah 14:4–7); “Those who catch sight of you stare at you, wondering, ‘Is this the man who made the earth shake and kingdoms quake, who turned the world into a wilderness, demolishing its cities, permitting not his captives to return home?’” (Isaiah 14:16–17).\n\nGaining the World but Losing Your Own Soul\n\nJesus’ saying, “What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own soul?” (Matthew 16:26) wasn’t just wise counsel against covetousness but also a prediction of what would occur at the end of the world. Indeed, just such a person conquers the world by force—the end-time king of Assyria/Babylon. As God’s instrument for eliminating the wicked, he causes “utter destruction upon the whole the earth” (Isaiah 10:23; 13:5; 21:1–2; 28:22; 37:18; 51:13). God raises him up for that purpose: “It is I who create the smithwho fans the flaming coals, forging weapons to suit his purpose; it is I who create the ravagerto destroy” (Isaiah 54:16).\n\nIn the end, however, he dies too: “Woe to you, despoiler, who yourself was not despoiled; O treacherous one, with whom none have been treacherous: when you have done with devastating, you shall be devastated; when you are through betraying, they shall betray you!” (Isaiah 33:1); “Prepare for the massacre of their sons, in consequence of their fathers’ deeds, lest they rise up again and take possession of the world, and fill the face of the earth with cities” (Isaiah 14:21); “For Tophet has been prepared of old, [a hearth]indeed, made ready for rulers; broad and deep is its fire pit and ample its pyre; Jehovah’s breath burns within it like a river of lava” (Isaiah 30:33).\n\nJehovah’s Coming and the Thief in the Night\n\nReferring to Jesus’ prediction that events surrounding his second coming would resemble a thief breaking and entering a house when its owner isn’t watching (Matthew 24:43), both Peter and Paul predict that the “Day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night” (1 Thessalonians 5:2; 2 Peter 3:10). According to the Hebrew prophets, the “Day of the Lord” or “Day of Jehovah” is a worldwide judgment that precedes Jehovah’s coming to reign on the earth (Isaiah 2:12; 13:6, 9; Jeremiah 46:10; Ezekiel 13:5; 30:3; Joel 1:15; 2:31; Amos 5:18). It isn’t Jehovah/Jesus who comes as a thief in the night, therefore, but rather the events associated with his coming.\n\nOn the other hand, there is an actual thief who precedes Jehovah’s coming—the end-time “king of Assyria.” As a world conqueror, he robs the world of its wealth, boasting, “I have done it by my own ability and shrewdness, for I am ingenious. I have done away with the borders of nations, I have ravaged their reserves, I have vastly reduced the inhabitants. I have impounded the wealth of peoples like a nest, and I have gathered up the whole world as one gathers abandoned eggs; not one flapped its wings, or opened its mouth to utter a peep” (Isaiah 10:13–14). In the end, however, the archtyrant’s booty fails to benefit him (Isaiah 10:15–18, 24–27).\n\nCosmic Cataclysm Prior to the Millennial Age\n\nIsaiah’s method of predicting end-time events based on ancient events includes the idea of cosmic cataclysm. Just as God anciently destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by a hail of fire and brimstone (Genesis 19:24), so he destroys end-time Babylon—an idolatrous, materialistic world (Isaiah 13:1, 9, 11, 19): “The stars and constellations of the heavens will not shine. When the sun rises, it shall be obscured; nor will the moon give its light. . . . I will cause disturbance in the heavens when the earth is jolted out of place by the angerof Jehovah of Hosts in the day of his blazing wrath” (Isaiah 13:10, 13). Not many escape destruction (Isaiah 13:12).\n\nAt fault are God’s covenant people, whose apostasy is the catalyst of God’s Day of Judgment: “The earth lies polluted under its inhabitants: they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinances, set at nought the ancient covenant” (Isaiah 24:5). “When the windows on high are opened, the earth shall shake to its foundations. The earth shall be crushed and rent; the earth shall break up and cave in; the earth shall convulse and lurch. The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, sway back and forth like a shanty; its transgressions weigh it down, and when it collapses it shall rise no more” (Isaiah 24:18–20). Only a few “gleanings” survive (Isaiah 24:13–16).\n\nBabylon’s Sodom-and-Gomorrah Destruction\n\nOf the thirty end-time events Isaiah predicts that resemble past events, Babylon’s violent overthrow—“as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah” (Isaiah 13:19)—is the most condemnatory. And yet it implicates most of the earth’s population. In his oracle addressed to “Babylon,” Isaiah defines Babylon as both a people and a place—the “sinners” and the “wicked” of the “earth” and the “world.” He predicts that God “will make the earth a desolation that sinners may be annihilated from it.” God has “decreed calamity for the world, punishment for the wicked.” He “will put an end the arrogance of insolent men and humble the pride of tyrants” (Isaiah 13:1, 9–13).\n\nPart IV of Isaiah’s Seven-Part Structure (Isaiah 13–23; 47) additionally provides a structural definition of Babylon. That literary device defines Babylon as a multinational conglomerate of nations and peoples that opposes Zion. Even God’s people who refuse to repent ultimately become an integral part of this Babylon as the world polarizes into two opposite camps. In that end-time context, God even calls his own people by the names “Sodom” and “Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:10), signifying that in that day their wickedness resembles ancient Sodom’s and Gomorrah’s. Their fate, too, therefore, is that of Sodom and Gomorrah in all its damning finality.\n\nA “Sweeping” with the Broom of Destruction\n\nIsaiah’s likening God’s Day of Judgment upon the world to a doomsday for the wicked means that those who haven’t repented when their time runs out must suffer through a worst-case scenario. In that day, Babylon—the world at large in its wicked state (Isaiah 13:1, 9, 11)—falls, its idol gods “razed to the ground” (Isaiah 21:9), its terrain swept clean of all that offends: “‘I will rise up against them,’ says Jehovah of Hosts. ‘I will cut off Babylon’s name and remnant, its offspring and descendants,’ says Jehovah. ‘I will turn it into swamplands, a haunt for ravens; I will sweep it with the broomof destruction,’ says Jehovah of Hosts” (Isaiah 14:22–23).\n\nAs in the end God’s people who don’t repent identify with Isaiah’s Babylon category, they suffer the same judgments: “As a blazing fireconsumes stubble, and as dry weeds wane before the flame, so shall their roots decay away and their blossoms fly up like dust. For they have despised the law of Jehovah of Hosts and reviled the words of the Holy One of Israel” (Isaiah 5:24). To perish without “roots” or “blossoms” is to sever all familial connections—a covenant curse (Job 18:16–17; Malachi 4:1). To likewise leave behind no “name” or “remnant,” “offspring” or “descendants” (Isaiah 14:22) is to have all remembrance of one’s existence erased from the earth.\n\n4. Pivotal End-Time Events\n\nGod’s People—This Time Around It Is Us!\n\nApplying Isaiah’s prophecy to ourselves for our profit and learning, we immediately face several inconvenient truths. As God holds us accountable for transgressing his law and word, the misfortunes that befall us as a people are a consequence of our collective guilt. As society breaks down, we may attribute our troubles to a failing economy, human error, freaks of nature, the forces of evil, and so forth. But to God we have set in motion an escalating series of covenant curses. Israel’s sliding into apostasy in former generations precipitated those same troubles and loss of privileges or covenant blessings. If we miss that point, we are wallowing in denial.\n\nIsaiah declares our chief sins: idolatry and injustice. We worship idols when we pursue the things of this world—whatever steals our hearts away from God. The effect on us is spiritual blindness. We still assume we are right with God even as our religion becomes but a substitute for that deeper relationship with him that he offers us. Such religiosity isn’t enough to save us in his coming Day of Judgment. Injustices assume many forms: inequality, enmity, evil speaking, oppression, predatory practices, persecution, tyranny, and so forth. Through Isaiah, God offers us better way—to acknowledge our sins and keep his law and word so that he may heal us.\n\n“My People Are Taken Over without Price!”\n\nCan we disregard the relevance of Isaiah’s prophecies to the present day yet suffer no consequences? Can we prepare to deal with the hardships that are almost upon us with no foreknowledge of them? “Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t know,” a wise man said. Isaiah’s use of events in the past as types of ones in the future helps us understand our day a lot better. The functioning of God’s people of Isaiah’s day as a type of those in the end-time turns the past into a window of the future. Applying to ourselves what Isaiah declares, therefore—the good and the evil—gives us so much more the advantage when his end-time scenario unfolds.\n\nA big part of Isaiah’s prophecy deals with the “Day of Jehovah”—God’s Day of Judgment on a wicked world. Characterizing that phase of world history is God’s people’s suffering bondage: “‘My people are taken over without price. Those who govern them act presumptuously,’ says Jehovah ‘and my name is constantly abused all the day’” (Isaiah 52:5). Economic distress—a covenant curse—gives his people’s leaders the chance to subjugate them. Isaiah compares the severity of that subjugation to Israel’s former bondage in Egypt and servitude to Assyria (Isaiah 52:4). In other words, things will get that bad before deliverance comes (Isaiah 52:8–10).\n\nSocial Anarchy—Prelude to Foreign Invasion\n\nEconomic distress leads to anarchy and the division of God’s people into clans or bands, each fighting for survival: “Jehovah of Hosts deprives Judea and Jerusalem of both staff and crutch—all food supply and water supply. . . . I will make adolescents their rulers; delinquents will lord it over them. People will oppress one another, every man his neighbor. . . . Then will a man apprehend a kinsman of his father’s house:‘You have a tunic: be our leader and take charge of this ruin!’ But he will raise [his hand]in that day and swear, ‘I am no physician. There is neither food nor clothing in my house; you cannot make me a leader of the people’” (Isaiah 3:1, 4, 6–7).\n\nJust as the names Babylon and Zion, Assyria and Egypt act as codenames Isaiah uses to designate end-time nations and entities, so “Judea” and “Jerusalem” act as codenames of those who profess to be God’s end-time people. Their corrupt state and internal collapse lead to foreign invasion: “Your land is ruined, your cities burned with fire; your native soil is devoured by aliens in your presence, laid waste at its takeover by foreigners” (Isaiah 1:7). All is not lost, however, as a repentant remnant of God’s people escapes destruction: “Had not Jehovah of Hosts left us a few survivors, we should have been as Sodom or become like Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:9).\n\nNearing the End—“To Your Tents, O Israel!”\n\nDuring times of social upheaval, God’s people anciently resorted to the nomadic lifestyle of their ancestors, saying, “To your tents, O Israel!” (1 Kings 12:16). According to Isaiah, conditions at the end of the world will resemble those during ancient times of distress: “In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and a pair of sheep. And because of their plentiful milk, men will eat the cream. All who remain in the land will feed on cream and honey” (Isaiah 7:21–22); “To you, this shall be a sign: This year eat what grows wild, and the following year what springs up of itself. But in the third year sow and harvest, plant vineyards and eat their fruit” (Isaiah 37:30).\n\nAlthough God’s people will pass through hard times to try their faith, God provides for them: “Tell the righteous it shall be well with them; they shall eat the fruits of their own labors. But woe to the wicked when calamity [overtakes them]: they shall be paid back for the deeds they have done!” (Isaiah 3:10–11). Of the one, Isaiah says: “They shall dwell on high; the impregnable cliffs are their fortress. Bread is provided them, their water is sure;” of the other: “The sinners in Zion are struck with fear; the godless are in the grip of trembling: ‘Who among us can live through the devouring fire? Who among us can abide eternal burning?’” (Isaiah 33:14, 16).\n\nIsaiah Predicts End-Time Prophets and Seers\n\nIsaiah—a prophet and seer who saw to the end of time—predicts that prophets and seers will exist in that future day. These persons fall into two categories. First are those who have “gone astray,” who “err as seers” (Isaiah 28:7), “prophets who teach falsehoods” (Isaiah 9:15), whose eyes God closes because of the wickedness of his people (Isaiah 29:10). These watchmen of God’s people are “blind and unaware; all of them but dumb watchdogs unable to bark, lolling seers fond of slumber. Gluttonous dogs, and insatiable, such indeed are insensible shepherds. They are all diverted to their own way, every one after his own advantage” (Isaiah 56:10–11).\n\nSecond are “watchmen” who prophesy in the day of power, when God “bares his holy arm in the eyes of all nations” (Isaiah 51:9–11; 52:8, 10). They stand on the watchtower day and night, are “most vigilant” and “fully alert” to approaching dangers, and report what they “see” and “hear” (Isaiah 21:6–10). They herald Jehovah’s coming to reign on the earth and prepare God’s people for their end-time exodus out of Babylon to Zion (Isaiah 52:7–8, 11–12; compare 48:20–21). They “raise their voice as one” at the time Jehovah comes (Isaiah 52:8). They call upon God without ceasing for the welfare of his people and don’t keep silent day or night (Isaiah 62:6–7).\n\nSeparation of the Righteous and the Wicked\n\nAn entire separation of the righteous and the wicked occurs at the end of the world. While a glorious new age dawns for those of God’s people who repent, doomsday in all its horrors overtakes those who don’t. After sending prophets to warn humanity one last time, God brings on his judgment: “Come near, you nations, and hear! Pay attention, you peoples! Let the earth give heed, and all who are upon it, the world, and all who spring from it. Jehovah’s rageis upon all nations, his furyupon all their hosts; he has doomed them, consigned them to the slaughter. . . . For it is Jehovah’s day of vengeance, the year of retributionon behalf of Zion” (Isaiah 34:1–2, 8).\n\nThe “year of retribution on behalf of Zion” entails Jehovah’s delivering his people from the power of their enemies at his coming to Zion: “I had resolved on a day of vengeance, and the year of my redeemed had come” (Isaiah 63:4); “According to what they deserve, he will repay them: wrathupon his adversaries, reprisals upon his enemies; to the isles he will render retribution. From the west men will fear Jehovah Omnipotent, and from the rising of the sun his glory. For he will [come upon] themlike a hostile torrent impelled by the Spirit of Jehovah. But he will come as Redeemer to Zion, to those of Jacob who repent of transgression” (Isaiah 59:18–20).\n\nThe New Flood—Assyria’s World Conquest\n\nJust as the world experienced the Flood anciently—“because all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth” and “the earth was filled with violence” (Genesis 6:11–13)—and just as God saved Noah and his family from the Flood because “Noah was a just man, perfect in his generation” (Genesis 6:9), so, when the same end-time conditions occur, God sends a Flood and saves “just men made perfect.” The new Flood, however, isn’t by water (signifying the earth’s baptism by water) but by fire (signifying its baptism by fire): “For with fireand with his swordshall Jehovah execute judgment on all flesh, and those slain by Jehovah shall be many” (Isaiah 66:16).\n\nPersonifying the Flood is the king of Assyria, who resembles “an inundating deluge of mighty waters” (Isaiah 28:2). His evil allies, who “rage like the raging of the seas—tumultuous nations, in commotion like the turbulence of mighty waters!” (Isaiah 17:12)—overrun the earth like “a flooding scourge” (Isaiah 28:17–22). Still, the destruction they cause is by fire: “Whole nations have been burned like lime, mown down like thorns and set ablaze” (Isaiah 33:12); “Wickedness shall be set ablaze like a fire, and briars and thorns shall it consume; it shall ignite the jungle forests [cities], and they shall billow upward in mushrooming clouds of smoke” (Isaiah 9:18).\n\nAn End-Time Exodus out of Babylon to Zion\n\nOf the thirty ancient events of which Isaiah predicts new, end-time versions, a new exodus—patterned after Israel’s ancient exodus out of Egypt—is similarly followed by a new wandering in the wilderness. The new exodus, however, is out of the whole world—out of “Babylon”—which God is about to destroy: “Go forth out of Babylon, flee from Chaldea! Make this announcement with resounding voice; broadcast it to the end of the earth. Say, ‘Jehovah has redeemed his servant Jacob.’ They thirsted not when he led them through arid places: he caused water to flow for them from the rock; he cleaved the rockand water gushed out” (Isaiah 48:20–21).\n\nAs Lot was led out of Sodom, so are participants in the new exodus: “The righteous disappear, and no man gives it a thought; the godly are gathered out, but no one perceives that from impending calamity the righteous are withdrawn” (Isaiah 57:1). “Come out of her and be pure, you who bear Jehovah’s vessels. But you shall not leave in haste or go in flight: Jehovah will go before you, the God of Israel behind you” (Isaiah 52:11–12). “I will bring your offspring from the east and gather you from the west; I will say to the north, ‘Give up!’ to the south, ‘Withhold not! Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the end of the earth’” (Isaiah 43:5–6).\n\nWilderness Wandering with God and Angels\n\nAccording to Isaiah, Israel’s end-time exodus from the four directions of the earth leads through waters, mountains, deserts, steppes, and fire (Isaiah 41:9, 17–19; 42:16; 43:2, 5–8, 16, 19–21; 48:21; 49:9–12). Like the ancient exodus out of Egypt, however, God’s people who return from their worldwide dispersion are carried to Zion by certain (spiritual) kings and queens of the Gentiles: “Thus says my Lord Jehovah: ‘I will lift up my handto the nations, raise my ensignto the peoples; and they will bring your sons in their bosoms and carry your daughters on their shoulders. Kings shall be your foster fathers, queens your nursing mothers’” (Isaiah 49:22–23).\n\nIsrael’s end-time wandering in the wilderness is a joyous occasion, resembling Israel’s ancient annual pilgrimage to Zion: “For you there shall be singing, as on the night when a festival commences, and rejoicing of heart, as when men march with flutes and drums and lyres on their way to the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rockof Israel” (Isaiah 30:29); “Let the ransomed of Jehovah return! Let them come singing to Zion, their heads crowned with everlasting joy; let them obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing flee away” (Isaiah 51:11). God will be with those who return: “Jehovah will go before you, the God of Israel behind you” (Isaiah 52:12).\n\nDivine Protection under God’s Cloud of Glory\n\nJust as God’s cloud of glory hovered over the Israelites and protected them from Pharaoh’s army and from physical elements at Israel’s exodus out of Egypt (Exodus 13:21–22; 14:19–20), so it protects God’s righteous people from end-time hostile forces. In that day, they sing Songs of Salvation: “You were a refuge for the poor, a shelter for the needy in distress, a covert from the downpour and shade from the heat. When the blasts of tyrants beat down like torrents against a wall, or like scorching heatin the desert, you quelled the onslaughts of the heathen. As burning heatby the shade of a cloud, you subdued the power of tyrants” (Isaiah 25:4–5).\n\n“Over the whole site of Mount Zion, and over its solemn assembly, Jehovah will form a cloud by day and a mist glowing with fireby night: above all that is glorious shall be a canopy. It shall be a shelter and shade from the heatof the day, a secret refuge from the downpourand from rain” (Isaiah 4:5–6). While the “day” mentioned signifies God’s Day of Judgment, Isaiah’s heatwave and storm imagery typifies the evil powers God lets loose upon a wicked world. The idea of a “canopy,” moreover, denotes a renewal of the marriage covenant between God and his end-time people: “He who espouses you is your Maker, whose name is Jehovah of Hosts” (Isaiah 54:5).\n\nNew Descent on the Mount and New Passover\n\nAmong the new versions of ancient events Isaiah predicts is God’s Descent on the Mount. As Jehovah descended on Mount Sinai in a display of power and might (Exodus 19:16–24), so he does on Mount Zion: “As a lion or a young lion growls over the prey when the shepherds muster in full force against him, and is not dismayed at the sound of their voice nor daunted by their numbers, so shall Jehovah of Hosts be when he descends to wage war on Mount Zion” (Isaiah 31:4); “Jehovah will cause his voiceto resound, and make visible his armdescending in furious rage, with flashes of devouring fire, explosive discharges and pounding hail” (Isaiah 30:30).\n\nIsaiah similarly predicts a new Passover. As the angel of death passed over Israel’s firstborn sons when he smote Egypt’s firstborns (Exodus 12:1–29), so he passes over a remnant of God’s people when the Assyrians lay siege to them: “As birds hover over [the nest], so will Jehovah of Hosts guard Jerusalem; by protecting it he will deliver it, by passing over it, preserve it” (Isaiah 31:5); “I will protect this city and save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David. Then the angel of Jehovah went out and slew a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the Assyrian camp. And when men arose in the morning, there lay all their dead bodies!” (Isaiah 37:35–36).\n\nThe Gathering of Israel’s Outcasts from Exile\n\nA hard fact of Isaiah’s end-time scenario is that it isn’t those who appear to be God’s people whom God saves in the end but those who are rejected by the majority. These “outcasts” suffer “reproach” and “ridicule,” are “excluded” from God’s people, and, like God’s servant who gathers them, are “despised” and “abhorred” until God reverses their circumstances (Isaiah 49:7–8; 51:7; 60:15–16; 61:7, 9; 66:5–8). In the end, those who are excluded and betrayed by their own people are gathered with God’s righteous remnant: “Thus says my Lord Jehovah, who gathers up the outcasts of Israel: ‘I will gather others to those already gathered’” (Isaiah 56:3, 8).\n\nGod answers the loyalty of his people’s outcasts by uniting them with other outcasts who return from exile in an exodus to Zion or Jerusalem: “In that day a loud trumpetshall sound, and they who were lost in the land of Assyria and they who were outcasts in the land of Egypt shall come and bow down to Jehovah in the holy mountain at Jerusalem” (Isaiah 27:13). Those who gather are surprised to learn of others besides them: “From a sector of the earth we hear singing: ‘Glorious are the righteous!’ Whereas I thought, ‘I am wasting away; I am weakening: woe is me; the traitors have been treacherous, the turncoats have deceitfully betrayed!’” (Isaiah 24:16).\n\nThe End-Time Reunion of Ephraim and Judah\n\nWhen Solomon’s son Rehoboam refused to heed the counsel of Israel’s elders and raised the people’s taxes, Jeroboam, Solomon’s servant, began ruling over Israel’s northern tribes (1 Kings 11:29–32; 12:1–20). Because Ephraim was its leading tribe, the Northern Kingdom was often referred to simply as Ephraim (Isaiah 7:1–9; Hosea 5:1–14). Likewise, because the tribe of Judah led the Southern Kingdom, that kingdom was known simply as Judah (ibid.). That day—“the day Ephraim broke away from Judah” (Isaiah 7:17)—became a national tragedy, a symptom of wickedness and a covenant curse. Since that day, the nation of Israel has remained divided.\n\nAnd yet, Isaiah predicts that Ephraim and Judah will reunite when God gathers Israel from dispersion in an end-time exodus from the four directions of the earth: “In that day my Lord will again raise his hand to reclaim the remnant of his people—those who shall be left out of Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the islands of the sea. He will raise the ensignto the nations and assemble the exiled of Israel; he will gather the scattered of Judah from the four directions of the earth. Ephraim’s jealousy will pass away and the hostile ones of Judah will be cut off; Ephraim will not envy Judah, nor Judah resent Ephraim” (Isaiah 11:11–13).\n\nThe Gathering and Reunion of Israel’s Tribes\n\nSince Israel’s ten northern tribes broke away from the southern tribes of Judah in 924 B.C., then disappeared after being deported to Mesopotamia in 722 B.C., the “two houses of Israel” have never reunited. Still, as David reunited the northern and southern tribes in his day (2 Samuel 5:1–5), so does an end-time David, his descendant—God’s servant. Isaiah predicts that God’s servant will “raise up the tribes of Jacob and restore those preserved of Israel” (Isaiah 49:6). At that time, all of Israel’s tribes return from dispersion to promised lands in an exodus from the four directions of the earth (Isaiah 11:10–16; 43:1–8; 49:9–12, 22; compare Hosea 3:5).\n\nEzekiel, too, predicts this: “Behold, I will take the people of Israel from among the heathen where they have gone, and I will gather them on every side and bring them into their own land. And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be a king to them all. And they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all. . . . And they shall dwell in the land I gave Jacob my servant, in which your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they and their children and their children’s children forever. And my servant David shall betheir prince forever” (Ezekiel 37:21–22, 25).\n\n5. Isaiah’s Use of Types\n\nIsaiah’s Use of Names as Precedents and Types\n\nWe may suppose that when Isaiah names a person or nation, such names are incidental to his prophecy. Rather, the opposite is the case. Names of persons and nations in the Book of Isaiah serve an important function by identifying precedents in the past that establish models or types of the future. Because whatever Isaiah predicts for the end-time possesses a type in the past, his use of names of persons or nations means that events similar to those associated with those names will repeat themselves. In other words, the ancient names Isaiah uses function as codenames for persons or nations that exist in the end-time, that being typical of the way Isaiah prophesies.\n\nAs Moses led Israel to the Promised Land, so shall one like Moses: “Then his people recalled the days of Moses of old: ‘Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? Where is he who put into him his holy Spirit, who made his glorious armproceed at the righthandof Moses, who divided the waters before them, making an everlasting name for himself?’” (Isaiah 63:11–13). As God called Abraham from a far country to the Promised Land, so he calls end-time Israel: “You, O Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, offspring of Abraham my beloved friend, you whom I have taken from the ends of the earth” (Isaiah 41:8–9).\n\nPatterns from Israel’s Past—A Sure Guideline\n\nIsaiah’s method of prophesying end-time events based on types or patterns from the past provides a safeguard against counterfeits, which inevitably precede and accompany the real thing. False prophets and messiahs, delusive promises of deliverance, spurious “miracles”—all will test people’s faith in God and their knowledge of the facts. The comforting thing about Isaiah’s prophecies is that they are true to the principle of “what has been shall be” (Ecclesiastes 1:9). If something is of God it will follow the patterns of the past; if it isn’t, then informed persons ought to exercise their prerogative to reject it even though a majority of people accept it.\n\nA deep understanding of Isaiah’s prophecy—gained from diligent searching of his words until they are clear—provides the best guide to knowing the true from the false. One can’t disregard this requirement and assume one already knows what there is to know, then still expect to be able to discern between what is of God and what is not in the time of confusion that has been foretold. God allows counterfeits to abound for the express purpose of weeding out those who treat lightly the prophecies they have received (Isaiah 30:28). Many in times past believed they were right in other such situations, yet sadly ended up “fighting against God” (Acts 5:39).\n\nBabylon—A Codename for the World Today\n\nThe use of codenames by ancient prophets who predict end-time events occurs throughout the scriptures. In the Book of Revelation, John uses the name Babylon to depict a multinational socio-economic system that drives the economy of a world ripening in wickedness (Revelation 17–18). And yet, in John’s day the empire that once was Babylon no longer exists. Daniel predicts a great world conflict involving the kingdoms of Persia, Greece, and other nations of his day. However, the angel who shows him these things tells Daniel to shut up the words and seal them in a book because they aren’t about his day but the “time of the end” (Daniel 11:1–12:4).\n\nAnciently, the Babylonian empire epitomized an idolatrous, materialistic world civilization. Isaiah combines that model with others to create a composite entity, a kind of Greater Babylon. Part III of Isaiah’s Seven-Part Structure (Isaiah 13–23, 47) pulls an entire series of foreign nations and entities that once came under Babylon’s influence into this “Babylon” conglomerate. Forming a part of this arch entity is ancient Tyre’s worldwide shipping empire (Isaiah 23). It is Isaiah’s model that John draws on when projecting his end-time Babylon the Great. Of course, Isaiah’s use of codenames extends beyond the name Babylon to all others in his book.\n\nZion—A Codename for Persons Who Repent\n\nSeveral depictions of Zion exist in the scriptures. Zion is the “citadel” David captures from the Jebusites that becomes the “City of David” (1 Chronicles 11:4–7). The “holy hill of Zion” is the place where Jehovah dwells (Psalms 2:6; 9:11). Isaiah’s literary devices reveal his definition of Zion. Forty instances of the name Zion in the Book of Isaiah, for example, show a pattern associated with the name Zion consisting of (1) God’s destruction of the wicked from the earth; (2) his deliverance of a righteous remnant of his people; and (3) the presence of a Davidic king, whom Isaiah identifies either directly by name or indirectly under one of several aliases.\n\nContextually, Zion consists of God’s people Jacob or Israel who “repent” (swb) of transgression (Isaiah 1:27; 59:20). Zion is also the place to which they “return” (swb) from among the nations in an end-time exodus when the wicked perish (Isaiah 35:10; 51:11). In the Book of Isaiah, Zion, together with Jerusalem, is one of seven spiritual levels or categories of people. They consist of persons who ascend from the Jacob/Israel level to the Zion/Jerusalem level. They receive a remission of their sins when they prove their covenantal allegiance to God. In the end, the whole world divides into spiritual categories affiliated with either Zion or Babylon.\n\nImmanuel, Shear-Jashub, Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz\n\nBy our limiting Isaiah’s prophecy of Immanuel to Matthew’s application of it to Jesus (Matthew 1:23), much is lost in understanding the historical context of this prophecy (Isaiah 7:14). A prophecy about Jesus would not have been a “sign” to King Ahaz, who was dealing with an invasion of Judea by Aram and Ephraim and who was appealing to the king of Assyria for help instead of to his God. The name Immanuel, in fact, occurs three times in the same context. All three deal with Assyria’s invasion of Judea following Ahaz’ disloyalty to Jehovah (Isaiah 8:8, 10). And each of these three predictions were fulfilled by King Hezekiah, Ahaz’ son.\n\nIn its historical context, moreover, Immanuel is but one of three sons with portending names: (1) Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz (“Hasten the Plunder, Hurry the Spoil,” Isaiah 8:3); (2) Shear-Jashub (“A Remnant Shall Repent,” Isaiah 7:3); and (3) Immanuel (“God Is with Us”). Part II of Isaiah’s Seven-Part Structure (Isaiah 6–8; 36–40) shows that they represent three categories of God’s people: (1) those whom the king of Assyria destroys together with idolaters (Isaiah 37:18–19); (2) a remnant of people that repents and survives (Isaiah 37:4, 31–32); and (3) persons such as King Hezekiah who serve as saviors of their people (Isaiah 38:4–6).\n\nAbraham and Sarah—Exemplars of Blessedness\n\nIsaiah’s drawing on the names of Israel’s ancestors as exemplars of their descendants reveals a divine design: emulating persons on higher spiritual levels such as Abraham and Sarah may lead to ascent to their level and to their degree of blessedness. When God says, “Look to Abraham your father, to Sarah who bore you. He was but one when I called him, but I blessed him by making him many. For Jehovah is comforting Zion, bringing solace to all her ruins; he is making her wilderness like Eden, her desert as the garden of Jehovah” (Isaiah 51:2–3), he shows that by emulating Abraham and Sarah their descendants may inherit the blessings they did.\n\nBy responding to God’s end-time call, in other words, Abraham and Sarah’s descendants may obtain an innumerable posterity and hasten the earth’s transformation to a paradisiacal state. Indeed, by covenanting with Israel, God sought to do for his people as a nation what he did for their ancestors individually. Thus, Isaiah predicts that when certain individuals—“one” here and “one” there (Isaiah 51:2)—form a new nation of God’s people that proves loyal through the earth’s end-time chaos, God blesses them with an innumerable posterity and brings about the earth’s transformation to a paradisiacal state (Isaiah 41:8–20; 54:6–14; 55:3–13; 60:13–22).\n\nEnd-Time “Assyria”—A Militaristic Alliance\n\nFeaturing prominently in the Book of Isaiah is a militaristic superpower that seeks to conquer the world. In fact, God commissions its king figure—an end-time archtyrant—to punish his people when they rebel and do evil: “Hail the Assyrian, the rodof my anger! He is a staff—my wrathin their hand. I will commission him against a godless nation, appoint him over the people [deserving]of my vengeance, to pillage for plunder, to spoliate for spoil, to tread underfoot like mud in the streets. Nevertheless, it shall not seem so to him; this shall not be what he has in mind. His purpose shall be to annihilate and to exterminate nations not a few” (Isaiah 10:5–7).\n\nIn the pattern of ancient Assyria, this ruthless world power and its alliance of nations commits genocide on a world scale: “Hark! A tumult on the mountains, as of a vast multitude. Hark! An uproar among kingdoms, as of nations assembling: Jehovah of Hosts is marshaling an army for war. They come from a distant land beyond the horizon—Jehovah and the instruments of his wrath—to cause destruction throughout the earth. Lament, for the Day of Jehovah is near; it shall come as a violent blow from the Almighty” (Isaiah 13:4–6). Although all nations suffer destruction in their wicked state, the apostasy of those who were God’s people precipitates it.\n\nEnd-Time “Egypt”—A Superpower in Decline\n\nIsaiah’s use of types of ancient world powers that foreshadow end-time ones extends to the great superpower Egypt. As with all nations and persons who appear in the Book of Isaiah, their true identity appears from the way Isaiah characterizes them, not from historical or archaeological data, though at times these may help. In searching the world today for a superpower that matches Isaiah’s description of “Egypt,” the sole candidate is America. That connection is further strengthened by the fact that God’s people anciently dwelt in Egypt, that Joseph ruled Egypt, and that the birthright tribe of Ephraim sprang from Joseph and Asenath, an Egyptian woman.\n\n“Egypt,” however, is a superpower imploding: “The ministers of Zoan have been foolish, the officials of Noph deluded; the heads of state have led Egypt astray. Jehovah has permeated them with a spirit of confusion; they have misled Egypt in all that it does, causing it to stagger like a drunkard into his vomit. . . . Manufacturers of combed linen and weavers of fine fabrics will be dismayed. The textile workers will know despair, and all who work for wages suffer distress. . . . I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians; they will fight brother against brother and neighbor against neighbor, city against city and state against state” (Isaiah 19:2, 9–10, 13–14).\n\nThe Struggle within America—Isaiah Saw It\n\nThe importance of understanding Isaiah’s message increases daily as world events line up like the planets for the fulfillment of his prophecy. Under the codename “Egypt”—the great superpower of Isaiah’s day—America is predicted to suffer spiritual decline, political ineptitude, economic collapse, internal anarchy, and invasion by a ruthless military world power from the North—an end-time “Assyria.” On the other hand, a community of covenanters in Egypt turns back to God, who sends them a savior and delivers them (Isaiah 19–20). In the end, as the millennial age begins, “Egypt” again becomes “my people”—a righteous covenant people of God (Isaiah 19:25).\n\nA dichotomy of events surrounding Egypt thus typifies the nation in general, which incurs misfortunes or covenant curses for its wickedness even as a righteous category of persons within the nation becomes Egypt’s salvation: “Jehovah will make himself known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day. They will worship by sacrifice and offerings, and make vows to Jehovah and fulfill them. Jehovah will smite Egypt, and by smiting heal [it]: they will turn back to Jehovah, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them” (Isaiah 19:21–22). To be “healed” of iniquity and to “know” Israel’s God is to be his covenant people indeed.\n\nIsaiah Prophesies Using Composites of Types\n\nHaving seen “the end from the beginning” (Isaiah 46:10), Isaiah selectively draws on Israel’s ancient history in order to cover both time frames—the past and the future—the “end” being contained in the “beginning.” God’s people anciently, in other words, in the very events in which they participated, were predicting end-time events, something only God is capable of orchestrating: “Who predicts what happens as do I, and is the equal of me in appointing a people from of old as types, foretelling things to come? Be not perturbed or shaken. Have I not made it known to you from of old? Did I not foretell it, you being my witnesses?” (Isaiah 44:7–8).\n\nWhen something in the past isn’t an exact type of the end-time, on the other hand, Isaiah may combine several types from the past to round out his prediction of the future. That is, he may use composites of types to portray a single end-time person or event. Isaiah’s Seven-Part Structure, for example, portrays both Babylon and the king of Babylon as composites of types, including the events associated with them. The end-time itself, moreover, consists of over thirty ancient events that repeat themselves—although in a different order—that are compressed into a single scenario of a few years known as the “Day of Jehovah” or God’s Day of Judgment.\n\nThe Tyrant and Servant—Composites Figures\n\nAmong Isaiah’s prophecies based on composites of types, two figures feature prominently—the tyrant and the servant. Because no one person in the past alone adequately exemplifies in his life the actions either of these end-time figures performs, Isaiah combines several ancient types when describing them. Isaiah’s tyrant figure, for example, resembles both the ancient kings of Assyria—militaristic rulers from the North who establish a precedent for conquering the known world (Isaiah 10:5–14; 37:18, 21–27)—and the king of Babylon, who accomplishes the same thing but who additionally establishes a precedent as an idol ruler (Isaiah 14:4–23).\n\nSimilarly, the way Isaiah characterizes Jehovah’s servant combines many types of Israel’s past heroes who establish precedents for the servant’s redemptive roles. They include Moses, Israel’s lawgiver, who leads God’s people out of bondage through the Red Sea into the Promised Land (Isaiah 42:4, 7, 16; 43:2, 5–8, 16–17; 44:26–27; 48:20–21; 49:1–12; 51:9–11; 52:11–13; 55:4–5, 12–13; 63:11–13); Joshua, who conquers the Promised Land and allocates God’s people their inheritances (Isaiah 41:11–16; 49:8); and Cyrus, who conquers Babylon and reestablishes God’s people in the Promised Land (Isaiah 41:2–3; 44:26, 28; 45:1–2, 13; 46:11).\n\nIsaiah’s “Cyrus” Identifies a Composite Figure\n\nIsaiah’s mention of Cyrus, the Persian monarch who conquers Babylon—who establishes the Persian Empire, ruling from 558–530 B.C.—forms a key point on which liberal scholars divide the Book of Isaiah. They assert that there must have existed at least two “Isaiahs,” one who prophesied in Isaiah’s day (742–701 B.C.) and another in the time of Cyrus. In other words, liberal scholars don’t believe that a prophet of God (who saw to the end of time) could have seen a world ruler who lived a hundred and eighty years beyond Isaiah’s day. To them, the best any prophet could do was to document the events of his own day—like these scholars themselves!\n\nIsaiah’s “Cyrus,” however, was never intended to depict a purely historical person. While Cyrus’ mention by name is consistent with Isaiah’s practice of naming persons who set historical precedents, many of those precedents function as types of God’s end-time servant. Thus, passages in which Cyrus is named (Isaiah 44:26–28; 45:1) consist of composites of types. The first combines a Cyrus typology (rebuilding Jerusalem and the temple) with a Moses typology (the deep becoming dry), while the second combines a Cyrus typology (subduing nations to set free Israel’s exiles) with a David typology (Jehovah’s “anointed”). All typify end-time events.\n\nThe Woman Zion—A Role Model for Women\n\nWhile scriptural role models for women are few compared with those for men, Isaiah offers a preeminent role model: the Woman Zion. She not only represents God’s people—Jehovah’s wife under the terms of the covenant—she also typifies the ideal woman. Like all humankind, she is subject to sin and transgression. But by repenting and “serving her term,” she expiates her guilt (Isaiah 40:2). Rejecting false suitors and proving loyal to her husband (Isaiah 37:22), she gives birth to a new nation of God’s people: “Can the earth labor but a day and a nation be born at once? For as soon as she was in labor, Zion gave birth to her children” (Isaiah 66:8).\n\nWhen her covenant with Jehovah becomes unconditional (Isaiah 54:10), she flourishes in the earth: “You shall no more be called the forsaken one, nor your land referred to as desolate; you shall be known as her in whom I delight and your land considered espoused. . . . As the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you” (Isaiah 62:4–5). Her holdings increase: “Expand the site of your tent; extend the canopies of your dwellings. Do not hold back; lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes. For you shall spread abroad to the right and to the left; your offspring shall dispossess the nations and resettle the desolate cities” (Isaiah 54:2–3).\n\nThe Harlot Babylon—Anti-Ideal for Women\n\nIn opposition to the Woman Zion in the Book of Isaiah appears the Harlot Babylon. Besides typifying a wicked world, she exemplifies the undesirable traits of womanhood and acts as a kind of anti-ideal or false model. Engrossed in herself, she manipulates those who inhabit her world—including the Woman Zion—to serve her selfish purposes: “I was provoked by my people, so I let my inheritance be defiled. I gave them into your hand, and you showed them no mercy; even the aged you weighed down heavily with your yoke. You thought, ‘I, the Eternal Mistress, exist forever!’ and did not consider these, or remember her final destiny” (Isaiah 47:6–7).\n\nAs her domination of her environment expands, she begins to rival God. So he judges her: “Secure in your wickedness, you thought, ‘No one discerns me.’ By your skill and science you were led astray, thinking to yourself, ‘I exist, and there is none besides me!’ Catastrophe shall overtake you, which you shall not know how to avert by bribes; disaster shall befall you from which you cannot ransom yourself: there shall come upon you sudden ruin such as you have not imagined” (Isaiah 47:10–11). In Isaiah’s structural model of a Greater Babylon, God’s people who possess her manipulative traits form an integral part of Babylon and thus suffer her fate.\n\n6. Isaiah’s Use of Allegory\n\n“Mountains” and “Hills” Are Nations/Peoples\n\nAn integral part of encoding Isaiah’s message—of layering a prophecy within a prophecy—is his use of allegory and metaphor. Prophets besides Isaiah do this but none so well. Apart from its literal meaning, for example, the term “mountain” can mean “nation”: Babylon is a “destroying mountain” (Jeremiah 51:25); the “stone cut out of a mountain without hands” becomes a great “mountain that fills the whole earth” (Daniel 2:35, 45). Using synonymous parallel lines, Isaiah establishes the idea of “mountains” as a metaphor for “nations” or “kingdoms” (Isaiah 13:4; 64:1–3). In that way, he predicts things only those who search his words understand.\n\nWe can thus read the “mountain of Jehovah’s house” (Isaiah 2:2) as the nation of his house. Zion as the “head of the mountains” (ibid.) may mean the head of the nations—a blessing of the Sinai Covenant (Deuteronomy 28:12–13). The feet of the messenger heralding good tidings “on the mountains” (Isaiah 52:7) infers that the gospel is taken to all nations. The ensign lifted up “in the mountains” at the sound of the trump (Isaiah 18:3) is to all nations. Jacob/Israel’s “threshing mountains to dust and making chaff of hills” (Isaiah 41:15) suggests it conquers the Assyrian alliance of nations and peoples that participates in a world takeover. And so forth.\n\n“Forests” and “Trees” Are Cities and People\n\nJust as “mountains” and “hills” may mean “nations” or “kingdoms” in the Book of Isaiah, so “forests” and “trees” may mean “cities” and “people.” A literal and metaphorical meaning may apply. Isaiah thus again reveals more than meets the eye. He establishes such dual meanings by using synonymous parallel lines, as in Isaiah 32:19: “By a hail shall forests be felled, cities utterly leveled.” Or by simile, as in Isaiah 7:2: “The king’s mind and the minds of his people were shaken, as trees in a forest are shaken by a gale.” “Rivers,” too, may refer to rivers of people, as in Isaiah 18:2: “A people continually infringing, whose rivers have annexed their lands.”\n\nNote how the king of Assyria recounts his world conquest: “Because of my vast chariotry I have conquered the highest mountains, the farthest reaches of Lebanon. I have felled its tallest cedars, its choicest cypresses. I have reached its loftiest summit, its finest forest. I have dug wells and drunk of foreign waters. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all Egypt’s rivers!” (Isaiah 37:24–25). When the tyrant passes away, “the pine trees rejoice over you, as do the cedars of Lebanon: ‘Since you have been laid low, no hewer has risen against us!’” (Isaiah 14:8). Those who rebuild are “called oaks of righteousness, planted by Jehovah for his glory” (Isaiah 61:3–4).\n\nPrecious, Semi-Precious, and Common Stones\n\nStones and metals add to Isaiah’s metaphors that designate people. Even God is called “the Rock of Israel,” “the Rock, your fortress,” “an everlasting Rock” (Isaiah 17:10; 26:4; 30:29). To the reprobates of his people, however, he is “a stumbling stone or an obstructing rock” (Isaiah 8:14). When the people of Ephraim and their leaders scoff and deceive themselves, and God’s judgments are about to come upon them, God “lays in Zion a stone, a keystone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation” (Isaiah 28:16). Before Jehovah comes to the earth to reign, his watchmen are to prepare the way—to “pave a highway cleared of stones” (Isaiah 62:10–11).\n\nIsaiah uses such imagery to categorize people. Common stones and metals identify people on a low spiritual level, semi-precious on a higher level, and precious on a high level. When God destroys the wicked, for example, he “will make mankind scarcer than fine gold, men mo"
