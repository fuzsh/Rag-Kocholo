The committee met pursuant to notice, at 10:46 a.m., in room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chairman of the committee), presiding. Present: Senators Biden, Wellstone, Boxer, Bill Nelson, Lugar, Hagel, Chafee and Allen. The Chairman. The hearing will please come to order. We have two very distinguished witnesses in our first panel, and I will get to that in just a moment. I would ask unanimous consent, in the interest of time, that my formal statement be placed in the record at this moment as if read. Let me just very, very, very, very briefly summarize it, because I want to have as much opportunity to get to the issue of discussing Afghanistan with our first two witnesses. Whenever anyone asks me about Afghanistan, and whether or not we should be there, and should we expand the force, and so on, I always say, ``Everybody ought to try to think back why did we go in the first place. Why did we go in the first place?'' Interestingly enough, I think, as usual, the American people are way ahead of the political leaders in both parties, the administration, the Congress throughout the country, in that in a recent Gallup poll, 80 percent think the United States should keep troops in Afghanistan, while 16 percent of the U.S. population thinks we should take the troops out. The bottom line is, they understand why we went in the first place. What I want to examine today, because I have had, and I want to say it publicly, absolute cooperation, as chairman of this committee, from the State Department and from the White House. I do not interface as well, and I always--anything with Secretary Wolfowitz has always been responded to, but I do not interface with Defense as much in my capacity as chairman of this committee. But two things have emerged, and I just want to give the witnesses a heads-up of the direction I would like to take this hearing. I know I am a broken record to both of them about the need to expand the international security force. It seems as though we have replaced the strategy--not replaced; we have, instead of a strategy of an international security force being extended beyond Kabul, that we basically have, my phrase, not yours, a warlord strategy, which is, if there is peace and calm in any of the four major sectors of Afghanistan, even though it is imposed by and/or is primarily accountable to the fact that a warlord is in charge, that--that constitutes stability. I also want to talk about the time needed to buildup an all-Afghan army and police force, its status, its personnel, its timing. Because as I understand the basic underlying premise of the administration, one that I do not disagree with, is that there is a need to have a central government, have a security force that is made up of all factions, all of the major tribes represented in Afghanistan, and a police force, and that the notion would be that they would be the ultimate stabilizers of a government. But there is sometimes, as my grandmother would say, something missed between the cup and the lip, and we have to get to that point. How long is it going to take us to get to that point, what kind of progress are we making to get to that point, and what is the structure for stability in the meantime? That is what I want to talk about today. [The prepared statement of Senator Biden follows:] Prepared Statement of Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Over the past half-year we have achieved great battlefield success in Afghanistan. Our servicemen and servicewomen have defeated the Taliban, and gotten al-Qaeda on the run. We haven't yet captured bin Laden, but I'm confident that we'll achieve this goal. As we reach the next stage in the war, several questions arise: What is status ongoing operations against al-Qaeda presence in Afghanistan? What is the humanitarian situation? What is our assessment of the loya jirga process? Perhaps the most important question, however, is one of commitment: Will we stay the course and build security in Afghanistan, or will we permit this country to relapse into chaos? President Bush has often promised that America will lead the way in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. His April reference to the Marshall Plan was particularly apt: After World War II, America used its soldiers as peacekeepers and its dollars as peacebuilders. This may have been the wisest investment of the past century: We turned our most bitter foes into our staunchest allies. But if we're going to talk about a new Marshall Plan, we should be willing to back up our words with deeds. The original Marshall Plan cost $90 billion in today's dollars. Our total pledge for Afghan reconstruction is less than 1 percent of that, and we've only delivered a fraction of this pledge. All the money in the world, however, won't do much good without security. Absent that, any reconstruction funds will be siphoned into the pockets of greedy warlords. And that, in fact, is exactly what we're seeing right now. In Mazar-e Sharif recently, a U.N. worker was gang-raped by seven armed men--in a part of the country controlled by two warlords, one of whom serves as the government's Deputy Defense Minister. In the eastern portion of the country, a warlord named Bacha Khan seized control of an entire province in April, and still stands in open defiance of the legitimate government in Kabul. In Herat, the warlord Ismail Khan has invited Iranian agents to help him consolidate power, while reports of human rights abuses skyrocket. What do these cases--typical of the situation throughout the country--have in common? These warlords are all on the U.S. payroll. Maybe I'm missing something here, but I just don't think this makes sense. Asking warlords to uphold law and order is like asking the Cali cocaine cartel to be our partners in the drug war. Warlords aren't the solution to Afghanistan's problems--they're the cause of Afghanistan's problems. The long-term solution is to rebuild Afghanistan's army and police force--but that can't happen overnight. In the meantime--at least a year, and probably longer--there are only three alternatives: Use American troops as peacekeepers. Build up a robust international force. Or let Afghanistan revert to chaos. U.S. forces seem to be involved in de facto peacekeeping right now. Wouldn't it be better to clarify the mission, and let our allies share the burden? Afghan leader Hamid Karzai, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and nearly every expert on the region has called for expansion of the U.N.- mandated security force, ISAF, both in scope and tenure. In my view, this is clearly in our national interest. We should view ISAF as a force-multiplier. Without U.S. or U.N. peacekeepers, we're left with the third option: letting Afghanistan degenerate into the state of lawlessness that made way for the Taliban. After the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, America turned its back as the country disintegrated. President Bush has rightly promised not to repeat this mistake. If we fail to uphold the President's promise, Afghanistan will again become a den of terrorists, narcotics traffickers, and exporters of violent insurgency. One other factor makes such a failure unacceptable to our national interest: Afghanistan is a test case for Iraq. Anyone who wants to see Saddam Hussein removed from power in Iraq-- as I do--will be looking very closely at the administration's game plan in Afghanistan. Simply put, if we can't demonstrate long-term commitment in Afghanistan, nobody will trust us to make a long-term commitment in Iraq. Ousting Saddam, like ousting the Taliban, is only the first step in a long process. Everyone knows we can remove an evil regime. The question is, are we willing to expend the security, financial, diplomatic, and political resources to make the successor regime a success? The U.S. has power--but do we have staying power? We have with us today several highly distinguished witnesses. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage has recently returned from a mission to South Asia, where he successfully averted a nuclear war--not bad for a few days' work. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz has been one of the administration's leading architects of strategic planning for Afghanistan; I am particularly looking forward to his detailed discussion of these plans for assuring Afghan security in the months to come. Ambassador Peter Tomsen knows the political landscape of Afghanistan inside-out. As special envoy to Afghanistan for the previous President Bush, he dealt with many of today's power-brokers long before they had any real power to broker. He is currently ambassador-in-residence at the University of Nebraska, Omaha. Brig. Gen. David Grange earned three Silver Stars and two Purple Hearts during his service in Vietnam, and has served in Delta Force, Ranger and other Special Operations units during his 30-year military career. As commander of Task Force Eagle in Bosnia, he is particularly well-equipped to comment on U.S. participation in peacemaking operations. Up to now, the administration's plan has seemed to focus on the hope that warlords, if properly motivated with cash and weapons, will become reliable partners for peace. But as Secretary of State Powell once said, in his capacity as a military planner, ``Hope is not a strategy.'' Perhaps today's hearing will give us a clearer picture of the strategy underlying this hope. The Chairman. I am anxious to hear from both our witnesses, and with that, I will yield to my colleague, Senator Lugar. Senator Lugar. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I would like to join you in welcoming Deputy Secretary of State Armitage and Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz to this committee. I look forward to their testimony and reviewing with them Afghanistan's prospects for the future. I am hopeful that we are witnessing the emergence of a free and stable Afghanistan from more than two decades of war and instability, but it is clear that at least for the foreseeable future, Afghanistan's evolution will be marked by both advances and setbacks. And since the commencement of offensive military operations in Afghanistan, I have urged the administration to think simultaneously about what steps will be necessary to rebuild the nation after the Taliban and al-Qaeda were removed. I was pleased that, early on, President Bush stated that the United States would, and I quote, ``Not just simply leave after the military objective has been achieved.'' The administration correctly recognized that, without providing the people of Afghanistan with an environment in which the construction of a democracy and market-based economy was not only possible, but likely, the country would remain a source of insecurity and terror. The United States' international efforts have permitted the people of Afghanistan to begin rebuilding their economy, their government, and personal liberties, and I applaud the role that the international coalition has played in carrying out the reconstruction efforts, and the provision of humanitarian assistance. Unfortunately, despite this strong record of success, the future of Afghanistan remains uncertain. Without a strong international commitment to the reformation of a representative and effective government, our efforts could go to waste. The loya jirga recently completed its work, selected Hamid Karzai to be President. Karzai continues to construct a broad- based representational government to rule Afghanistan. Pundits here in Washington and around the world are debating the criteria employed in selecting cabinet members of the new government, and it is clear to most that the current security situation in Afghanistan was the primary determination in the selection process. I am supportive of efforts underway to expand training and equip a new Afghan national army. A successful transformation is one of the most important elements of long-term security, but in the meantime I continue to be concerned that the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, may not be up to the task of ensuring the requisite amount of security for Afghan reconstruction to continue. The ability of ISAF to maintain peace and security, and to project power into the farthest region of Afghanistan, is vitally important if the international community is to assist Karzai in enforcing the rule of law, and defending the threat posed by extremists, warlords, and terrorists. Only then can we replace Afghanistan's despair with a genuine future of hope. Afghanistan's reconstruction efforts have benefited, for the moment, from the capture of major al-Qaeda operatives as well as the dispersal of other major players around the world. Their likely strategy is to prepare and to undertake suicidal attacks against Western and Jewish targets, especially in Arab states allied with the West, while larger operations are prepared for the United States, such as the so-called ``dirty bomb'' plots. Though relatively small and widely dispersed, the al-Qaeda strikes appear to be coordinated by a senior group of leaders. In short, al-Qaeda's command structure may have survived the United States' military campaign in Afghanistan, even though its base in the country was eliminated. Instances like the bombing of a Tunisian synagogue and French and American targets in Karachi do not have the profile or drama of past military clashes in Afghanistan, but al-Qaeda attacks are likely to occur at any time and almost anywhere, including Afghanistan. Countering them has become as much a task for police and intelligence as a military operation. Help from other governments, especially in the Islamic world, is vital, as is effective monitoring of potential targets, including infrastructure and weapon sources. We know that a substantial number of al-Qaeda operatives managed to escape Afghanistan, and travel undetected, at least, at first, to countries around the region. We also believe a substantial number will look for opportunities to infiltrate back into Afghanistan. Most seriously, the alleged plot involving Jose Padilla, the alleged al-Qaeda recruit arrested in Chicago, has the evidence that al-Qaeda is determined to strike with weapons of mass destruction, and is actively seeking to procure or steal them. It is that concern that has led a number of us to recommend to the Bush administration that the United States formulate a new global coalition designed to keep nuclear and bioweapons out of the hands of al-Qaeda and other terrorists. In short, Afghanistan is not out of the woods yet, any more than terrorist threats to the United States involving weapons of mass destruction have lessened since September 11. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on how the United States can assist in bridging the gap in ISAF's abilities and capabilities, and the threats posed to Karzai's young and still fragile government, even as the Bush administration focuses on preventing terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you very much. I might note that there are a number of people in the audience who have been keenly interested in this subject. Among them, as working with the President, have been women's groups in the United States, who have testified before this committee about the security question, and today the Feminist Majority, now the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in Afghanistan, and NOW Legal Defense Fund and Education Fund, and the Equality NOW, are all represented here in the audience, and have importuned this committee and this chairman on occasion, and I am sure they have at the State Department. I know they have spoken with the Secretary. Today's paper, the New York Times, and other major papers are full of stories relative to the assertiveness of women in Afghanistan, taking significant risks to make sure they do not go back to the Dark Ages that they just came out of. So I welcome them and others that are here today. We have two very distinguished witnesses. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage recently returned from a mission in South Asia, where he successfully averted a nuclear war. Not bad for a few day's work. You did a hell of a job, Rich; congratulations. I want to state again publicly, I think the administration, and you in particular, played a very significant role in diffusing the single most dangerous circumstance that exists at the moment. We also have Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, who has been one of the administration's leading architects of strategic planning for Afghanistan. I am particularly looking forward to his discussions on plans for sharing security in the months to come, and I want to thank him again, not only for his being publicly available, but privately available whenever we have sought, or I have sought, at least, any information from him. I invite you to make any comments you wish in your statements, and do not worry about the clock. We are anxious to hear what you have to say. So as fully as you think you need to speak, please feel free. Do not worry about these lights going on. They will go on for us, not for you. Mr. Secretary, you can begin. STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD L. ARMITAGE, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE, DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, DC Mr. Armitage. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Lugar, Senators. Paul and I have, in our professional lives, spent a considerable amount of time in this very room in front of this panel, and we have come to realize, at least I have, that the patience of the committee is in inverse proportion to the length of my opening statement. So I am going to keep it very short, and I know you will allow me to have my comments submitted for the record. I just thought I would mention briefly the winners and the losers in the recent loya jirga, and what is left to do. I think the winners, first of all, are pretty easy to enumerate: the Afghan people and, particularly, women. This committee--the whole Congress, but this committee in particular, has been very interested in all the women in Afghanistan. I think the newspaper article in the New York Times, to which you referred, Mr. Chairman, is witness to the fact that in 6 months' time, women have gone from being held basically in contempt in Afghan society to a role where they felt secure enough to take part in a very robust and boisterous loya jirga. So the Afghan people, and women in particular, are the first winners. Second, Hamid Karzai is clearly a winner. He is a much better politician than any of us knew 6 months ago, and he managed competing pressures very, very well. He has to be considered in the winner's category. Another is a Tajik by the name of Fahid Khan, who is the First Vice President and still the Minister of Defense. He would have to be considered to have come out a winner. Fourth, the international community has been a winner, because we have been part of, thus far, what is a great success story, and I think it far outstripped in pace any ideas that any of the pundits had about the ability to resolve the questions of Afghanistan in anywhere near this rapid timeframe. The fifth winner are the coalition forces. Primary among them, of course, the United States and the ISAF, because in the minds of many in Afghanistan, there is not much difference between the coalition and ISAF. And we are the ones who made it possible for the Afghan people to eschew the role of the gun and the rule of the gun. Now, who are the losers? Well, I think you have to consider, at least in the short term, that the conservatives are the losers. They lost some serious altitude during the loya jirga. They were boisterous. There was some intimidation, or at least attempts at it, mostly verbal, but they lost ground. The second people who lost ground were some of the families of Zahir Shah, who envisioned a much greater role, a more active role for the former king, and they did not have their dreams realized. I think, third, one has to realize that there are some in the Pushtun community who feel that they lost ground, or they did not command as many portfolios as they might have hoped. There is a lot of misinformation in the public about what the makeup of Afghan society really is. In percentage terms, we have not had a census since 1979, so any numbers that anybody talks about are extrapolations from 1979. We do not know what percentage the Pushtuns or the Tajiks really have in the overall population, but I think it is fair to say that some in the Pushtun community are a little disappointed. Now, what is left for President Karzai to do? Well, I think, first and most importantly, he has to consolidate the instruments of power and he has to extend them out into the countryside to get to the very thing you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, and that is warlords and warlordism. Second, I think Afghanistan's society has to come to grips with the role of Islam in their nation. Do they envision themselves as a Turkey, or a Pakistan, or what? And I think that is a debate that we are going to see and witness as we move to the future. Finally, Mr. Karzai and the 29 ministers who make up his cabinet have to very definitely be seen in relatively rapid fashion, not only formulating a constitution to be voted on in about 18 months, but to be able to extend the fruits of the international community's largesse, particularly in terms of reconstruction aid to far-flung areas in Afghanistan. Those are three pretty big challenges for any cabinet and any President. Mr. Chairman, I will stop there, and turn it over to my colleague and friend, Paul Wolfowitz. [The prepared statement of Secretary Armitage follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Richard L. Armitage, Deputy Secretary of State Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to testify before the Committee on recent developments in Afghanistan. We have a good story to tell. For hope is returning to Afghanistan. It is no longer the country it was on September 11--a haven for terrorists, suffering from tragic social decline and serious abuses of human rights, especially women's rights. There is still much work to be done but, as President Bush has emphasized, the United States is committed to Afghanistan for the long haul. We will continue to work closely with the international community to help the Afghans help themselves in building a stable, broadly representative Afghanistan that can never again be a haven for terrorists. Our focus in Afghanistan continues to be on conducting the war on terrorism, putting in place security arrangements, fostering Afghanistan's internal governance, and providing humanitarian and development assistance. Let me briefly review each in turn. The war on terrorism is based on bringing the international community's combined strengths to bear against terrorism in its many manifestations throughout the world. In Afghanistan, Operation Enduring Freedom is not over and will not be finished until the last remnants of al-Qaida and the Taliban are flushed out and destroyed. Still, we are already taking up the tasks that will ensure that Afghanistan is never again a base for terrorism. With respect to security arrangements, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) is performing a very positive role by helping provide security in and around Kabul--through joint patrols with local police; security for special events, such as the loya jirga; and the rehabilitation and operation of Kabul International Airport. ISAF includes some 5,000 troops from 19 countries, with Turkey having recently taken the lead from the United Kingdom. The backbone of Afghanistan's future security structure must be the new Afghan National Army (ANA). The United States has taken the lead, working closely with ISAF, the French, and other coalition partners, in training and equipping troops for the ANA. Germany has the lead, with United States and other international assistance, on developing a viable police force. Afghanistan has also made large strides in opening up its politics and improving its governance. The Afghan Interim Authority (AIA), which governed for the six months before the loya jirga, was a multi-ethnic, broadly representative government that succeeded in establishing a basis for a central government that will remain responsive to the will of the Afghan people. The AIA ably performed the role that the Bonn Agreement laid out for it. It was responsible for many successes, such as reopening schools, including schools that educate girls; putting in place the starting points for building national security institutions; establishing judicial and human rights commissions; reintegrating women and ethnic minorities into society; and announcing and beginning to implement a ban on opium cultivation and harvesting. We will continue to work with the Afghan Transitional Administration to protect the rights of women and encourage their effective participation in civic life. Significant progress has also been made in creating an inclusive political process that generates incentives for groups and individuals to give up armed struggle for political goals. The Emergency loya jirga began the process of healing the country's wounds by bringing together Afghans from all ethnic groups, religions, and political persuasions to discuss Afghanistan's future. It elected Chairman Karzai to continue to lead Afghanistan for the next two years, the cabinet has been selected, and steps have been taken toward creating a National Assembly. Nonetheless, the road ahead is long, as demonstrated by the sharp political disputes at the loya jirga and continuing concerns about the security of international assistance workers, particularly in northern Afghanistan. There has also been progress in meeting the humanitarian needs of Afghans and beginning the process of reconstruction, but gaps remain. The new Transitional Authority faces major challenges, beginning with the need to fill the gap between needs and pledged resources. The Afghan government predicts a $390 million budgetary shortfall this year. The World Bank, Asian Development Bank and UNDP estimate reconstruction needs of $1.7 billion over the next year, while humanitarian and security assistance needs could raise this figure to $2.9 billion. The long term costs of this project over the next five years are going to be tremendous, perhaps as much as $10 billion. Refugees are returning at a faster rate than expected--more than one million to date, with up to two million expected by the end of the year. While this is a welcome sign of the return of normality, UN and other agencies tasked with helping refugees and displaced persons are facing potentially crippling funding shortfalls as the higher refugee inflow has driven costs faster than predicted. U.S. contributions to Afghanistan have already exceeded the $297 million pledged earlier this year in Tokyo. Appropriated funds for fiscal year 2002, plus requested funds for FY 2003 and a $250 million supplemental request currently before Congress, would boost official American assistance to over $900 million for FYs 2002 and 2003 combined. This does not include funding for U.S. military operations. Mr. Chairman, the United States, the Afghan people and the international community have undertaken an enormous job, but one that I believe is critical to our national goals and well worth the costs. We must stay the course, and with your continued support, Mr. Chairman, and that of this Committee, I am confident we will succeed. STATEMENT OF HON. PAUL WOLFOWITZ, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, WASHINGTON, DC Mr. Wolfowitz. Mr. Chairman, thank you. This distinguished committee has long provided our country strong leadership and bipartisan support, especially now that we are waging this war on terrorism, and I thank you for that. I thank you also for the opportunity to come here today to discuss the Department of Defense's perspective on how the campaign in Afghanistan to kill, capture, and disrupt terrorists has helped us to protect the American people, and also to discuss how we are helping the Afghan people help themselves, to ensure that their country does not, once again, become a terrorist sanctuary. To chart the way ahead, Mr. Chairman, it is important to understand how we got to where we are, so let me spend a moment on the early parts of the military operation. From the beginning of the war on terrorism, President Bush emphasized that the United States must apply, as he said, every resource at our command, every means of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every financial influence, and the President concluded, every necessary weapon of war to the destruction and defeat of the global terror network. Each of those instruments has a role. Each one reinforces the other. The military is only one of the instruments that we need to wage this war on terrorism. The military cannot do its job without the support of other elements, particularly intelligence and diplomacy, and its role is frequently to support the efforts of those other instruments of national power. This hearing is focused, and appropriately so, on Afghanistan and on our military effort there, but it is important to emphasize, as we have done from the beginning, that this campaign is not about a single country or a single terrorist network. Al-Qaeda alone has spread throughout the world. It is a network. A network by its very nature is based on the idea that should one node be eliminated, the network can still continue to function. Well before September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda had burrowed into some 60 countries, including the United States, Germany, France, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. It had critical nodes in Hamburg, Germany, and Jacksonville, Florida, as well as in Afghanistan. The pilots who flew the suicide attacks were not trained in Afghanistan. Many got their training right here in the United States. So Afghanistan was an important node in the network, but by its nature, a network does not have a headquarters. So while we focus on Afghanistan today, we must understand that it is only one node of that terrorist network. The very name of the organization, al-Qaeda, which means ``base'' in Arabic, indicates that the entire organization is the base of terrorist operations. It is spread throughout the world, and it needs to be eliminated, root and branch. In Afghanistan, where al-Qaeda's plots and plans flourished under the protection of the tyrannical Taliban, America's Armed Forces went to work to root out both. Our intention, as Secretary Rumsfeld said, was not only to deprive the terrorists of a sanctuary in Afghanistan where they could safely plan, train, and organize, but also to capture and kill terrorists, and to drain the swamp in which they breed. Over the last 8 months, with our coalition partners, we have defeated a vicious regime that gave refuge to evil. We have killed or captured many of its ringleaders, and we have others on the run. Even in Afghanistan, however, our work is far from complete, but we are encouraged by the many truly remarkable aspects of this campaign to date. Our military campaign in Afghanistan has had some striking features, some surprising, others less so. Not surprisingly at all, we have seen America's men and women in uniform conduct their operations with great bravery and great skill, as we saw at Mazar-e-Sharif and Tora Bora, and in Operations Anaconda and Mountain Lion. What may have been a surprise to some was the remarkable speed with which the military plans were put together, the swift success of the military operations, measured in weeks, rather than months, and with relatively few troops on the ground. On September 11, let me remind you, there simply were no war plans on the shelf for Afghanistan. General Franks was starting from scratch on September 20, when he received the order from the President to begin planning a campaign. Less than 3 weeks later, on October 7, we commenced military operations, and less than 2 weeks after that, we had troops operating on the ground with General Dostam in the north. In many ways, it was a remarkable feat of logistical and operational utility. If you would permit me, Mr. Chairman, I would like to read from an actual dispatch that we received from one of those Special Forces captains on the ground, or more accurately, on horseback, in northern Afghanistan. This is from October 25, shortly after he and his unit were inserted: ``I am advising a man on how best to employ light infantry and horse calvary,'' he said, ``in the attack against tanks, mortars, artillery, personnel carriers, and machine guns, a tactic which I thought had become outdated with the invention of the Gatling gun. The Mujaheddin have done that every day we have been on the ground. They have attacked with 10 rounds of ammunition per man, little water, and less food. I observed one man who walked 10-plus miles to get to the fight, who proudly showed me his artificial right leg from the knee down. ``There is little medical care if injured, only a donkey ride to the aid station, which is a dirt hut, but the Muj are doing very well with what they have. We couldn't do what we are doing,'' he went on, ``without the close air support. Everywhere I go, the civilians and Muj soldiers are always telling me they are glad the USA has come. They all speak of their hopes for a better Afghanistan once the Taliban are gone. Better go,'' he concluded, ``General Dostam is finishing his phone call with a Congressman back in the United States. Yes, we had that element of this fight as well.'' Another dispatch from one of his comrades on November 10, after the fall of Mazar-e-Sharif, reads in part: ``We rode on begged, borrowed, and confiscated transportation. While it looked like a ragtag procession, the morale into Mazar was triumphant. The locals loudly greeted us, and thanked all Americans. Much waving, cheering, and clapping, including from the women. The U.S. Navy and Air Force''--this from an Army man--``did a great job. I am very proud of my men, who performed exceptionally well in extreme conditions. I have personally witnessed heroism under fire by two U.S. noncommissioned officers, one Army, one Air Force, when we came under direct artillery fire last night, less than 50 meters away. When I ordered them to call close air support, they did so immediately without flinching.'' ``As you know, the U.S. element was nearly overrun 4 days ago, but continued to call close air support and ensured the Muj forces did not suffer defeat.'' He concluded, ``These two examples are typical of the performance of your soldiers and airmen. Truly, uncommon valor has been a common virtue.'' In many ways, those two dispatches, I think, capture the ingredients of an extraordinary military success. But another element of our success, which was undoubtedly a surprise to the terrorists but barely noticed by many others, was something that did not happen, something that calls to mind Sherlock Holmes' famous observation about the dog that did not bark. We did not become bogged down in a quagmire, unlike the British in the 19th century, or the Soviets in the 20th. Nations that arrive in Afghanistan with massive armies tend to be treated as invaders, and they regret it. Mindful of that history, General Franks has deliberately and carefully kept our footprint small to avoid just such a situation. On balance, our partnership with indigenous forces has been very positive and continues to be so. From the beginning of the war on terrorism, we have stressed the importance of understanding the nature of our enemy as a network. Al-Qaeda is not a snake that can be killed by lopping off its head. It is more analogous to a disease that has infected many parts of a healthy body. There is no one, single solution. You cannot simply cut out one infected area and declare victory, but success in one area can lead to success in others, and our success in Afghanistan has contributed to the larger campaign. In Afghanistan itself, through actions there, somewhat less than half of the top 30 or so leaders of the al-Qaeda organization have already been killed or captured. Well over 500 enemy are currently detained in Guantanamo or in Afghanistan as a direct result of our operations in that country. But equally important, if not more so, the worldwide efforts of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies, in cooperation with more than 90 countries, have resulted in the arrest of some 2,400 individuals. Our military success in Afghanistan has contributed to that larger success, both indirectly, by encouraging others to cooperate, and also more directly. Abu Zubayda, for example, one of bin Laden's key lieutenants, was driven out of his sanctuary in Afghanistan, and as a result, was captured last March. His partial cooperation, in turn, contributed to the detention of Jose Padilla, who came into the United States with the intention of planning and coordinating terrorist attacks. A Moroccan detainee in Guantanamo led us to three Saudis planning terrorist attacks in Morocco, all of whom were subsequently arrested, including one top al-Qaeda operative. In December, the discovery of a videotape in a safe house in Afghanistan led to the arrest of an al-Qaeda cell in Singapore that was planning to attack a U.S. aircraft carrier and U.S. personnel in that country. The cooperation of Pakistan under the leadership of President Musharraf has been extraordinary, leading to nearly 400 arrests in that country alone. These developments are encouraging; however, it is important to remember that al-Qaeda is still dangerous and active. This network still poses threats that should not be underestimated. Let me talk now about our efforts to build a more stable Afghanistan in the long term. Because while our primary mission in that country has been to kill or capture terrorists who threaten the United States, or those who have harbored them, it is also important to help the Afghans establish long-term stability in that country, so that it does not once again become an outlaw country that provides sanctuary for terrorists. While the success of those efforts will depend most of all on the Afghans themselves, the United States and its coalition partners have a critical role to play in achieving that goal. In shaping that role, and as in shaping the military campaign itself, we are very mindful of that historical Afghan animosity to foreign armies and foreign occupiers. We have always viewed our mission in Afghanistan as one of liberation, not occupation. So with this in mind, we have tackled the challenge of striking the balance between keeping Afghanistan from reverting back to a terrorist sanctuary, and at the same time, keeping our footprint small. Afghans are an independent, proud people, and we have worked from the beginning to minimize the number of our troops there, and to focus instead on helping the Afghan people to help themselves in their journey to representative self- government. We have made it clear, and we need to continue to do so, we have no intent of colonizing Afghanistan. We have been careful through our actions and our words to avoid creating the expectation that the United States can solve all of that country's problems, and we have made a determined effort not to take sides in Afghanistan's internal quarrels. But we have, in fact, seen that Afghans are good at solving problems when they must, and we must help them to deal with as many as they can. There are positive signs that Afghans are making progress. Secretary Armitage described in his testimony how the Afghan people made a significant step forward with the successful convening of the loya jirga. But along with self-government must come self-sufficiency, in terms of Afghanistan's security. That task is made more challenging by the formidable geography of Afghanistan. It is a country roughly the size of Texas, with peaks in the Hindu Kush Range, which translated, by the way, means ``Hindu Killer,'' that reach some 24,000 feet, 10,000 feet higher than the highest of the Rockies. If I might, Mr. Chairman, I would like to put up a chart. When we say that it is roughly the size of Texas, at least for those of us who are not natives of Texas, it may not carry enough meaning. I found it more meaningful to look at a map of Afghanistan superimposed on the southern United States, and you can see that it would stretch from Washington, DC, down almost to New Orleans, and from St. Louis, Missouri, down past Atlanta. It is huge. It is not only large, but if I could show you another chart, it has incredible terrain. This is a satellite photograph of Afghanistan, and the neighboring regions of Pakistan. You can see the enormous expanse of mountains, and down in the southwest corner, that formidable desert, which, in the Afghan language, is called the Desert of Death. The sheer size and unforgiving terrain of the country has been a major factor in planning our military operations, and it must remain a key factor in planning long-term security arrangements; but, encouragingly, the situation is becoming more stable. Out of 32 provinces in Afghanistan, our forces have experienced harassment mainly in only 5. The Taliban has so far failed to mount their often predicted spring offensive, and loya jirga convened with no serious security incidents, despite numerous threats. Our coalition partners are contributing to stability through their humanitarian work. It is especially worth noting that Jordanian personnel have been running a field hospital, which by itself, to date, has treated some 77,000 Afghan civilians. The overall improvements in conditions in the country are perhaps best demonstrated by the fact that people are voting with their feet. In just the first 5 months of the year, 1.2 million refugees are recorded as having returned to Afghanistan. That was the U.N.'s projection for the entire year of 2002. The U.N. has now doubled its target to 2 million refugees that they hope will return in this calendar year. On the security front, we are committed to working with the Afghan Transitional Authority and the international community to find effective solutions to the remaining challenges to that country's security. One of the most important pieces is training the Afghan army. At the beginning of May, U.S. Army instructors took on the task of helping to build an Afghan national army by initiating the training of the first group of Afghan recruits. Coalition partners are also assisting in this effort. France has already begun training a battalion, and others, including the United Kingdom, Turkey, Bulgaria, Poland, Korea, India, and Romania, are assisting with personnel, or funding, or equipment. I would appeal to you, Mr. Chairman, and all of the Members of the Senate and of the House, to approve as rapidly as possible our supplemental request for fiscal year 2002. It contains a request for $50 million in FMF and $20 million in peacekeeping operations funds that would permit us to accelerate the training and equipping of an Afghan army. The biggest gap, I must say, in this effort has been the lack of authorities for funding. Even though we have a lot of money for other purposes, we have to scrape around and go to some of the countries I just mentioned in order to get the funds for salaries or equipment. To further enhance regional stability, the 18-nation International Security Assistance Force has been helping to stabilize the situation in the capital of Kabul. The British did a splendid job leading that effort in its first 6 months, and we expect the same from our Turkish allies who have now agreed to take over the lead. Last month, the U.N. Security Council extended ISAF's mandate in Kabul until the end of the year. ISAF forces helped to train the Afghan national guard that protected Kabul during the loya jirga. Other important efforts to provide a more secure environment include the very important German-led effort to train a police force, and British counterdrug operations. However, the most important instrument that the Afghan Authority and we have to establish a stable security situation is the leverage provided by economic assistance. It is in our interest to provide such assistance, and to help the Afghans rebuild their country after almost a quarter century of war so that it will not once again become a haven for terrorists. The leadership provided by the State Department, as described by Secretary Armitage, has been key to that effort. Particularly important was the organization of the Tokyo Donors Conference that Secretary Armitage described. In support of those reconstruction efforts, the U.S. Central Command [CENTCOM] is also executing a plan to collocate personnel from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department besides our Special Forces and civil affairs teams that are operating throughout the country. This will allow USAID people to get out beyond Kabul and better monitor U.S. assistance, while providing them some protection in what remains an insecure environment. To conclude, Mr. Chairman, the campaign in Afghanistan, along with many other efforts now underway by many instruments of our government, has contributed to the disruption of the global terror network in tangible and far-reaching ways. Our task extends well beyond Afghanistan, and even in Afghanistan it will still be a long and difficult one, but the stakes are enormous. As President Bush said, speaking to the cadets at West Point 2 weeks ago, ``We have our best chance since the rise of the Nation state in the 17th century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace, instead of prepare for war.'' We can do this not by imposing our own model of human progress on other nations of the world, but, as the President said, ``we can support this effort when we reward governments that make the right choices for their own people.'' In our development aid, in our development efforts, in our broadcasting, and in our educational assistance, the United States will promote moderation, tolerance, and human rights, and we will defend the peace that makes all progress possible. In Afghanistan today, we see a democratic spirit rising from the remnants of a once-failed state that is trying to defy the ravages of decades of war and misrule. Despite a beginning that will at times be rocky, and no doubt suffer some setbacks, the Afghan people are hopeful for a new tomorrow, hopeful that they, too, can have a chance at peace instead of war. We remain committed to doing our part to help them on that journey, and we want history ultimately to judge us as having been dedicated to liberation, not occupation. We appreciate the continued leadership of this committee and the support of the Congress in these ongoing efforts. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Secretary Wolfowitz follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of Defense Mr. Chairman and distinguished Members of the Committee: This Committee has long provided our country strong leadership and bipartisan support, especially now as the United States wages the war against terrorism. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss with you today the Defense Department's perspective on how the campaign in Afghanistan to kill, capture and disrupt terrorists has helped us protect the American people, and how we are helping the Afghan people help themselves to ensure Afghanistan does not once again become a terrorist sanctuary. i. how the campaign in afghanistan has helped protect the american people From the beginning of the war on terrorism, President Bush emphasized that the United States must use ``every resource at our command, every means of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every financial influence and every necessary weapon of war, to the destruction and defeat of the global terror network.'' Each has a role; each reinforces the others. The military is only one of the instruments that we need to wage this war on terrorism. The military cannot do its job without the support of other elements, particularly intelligence, and its role is frequently to support the efforts of those other instruments of national power. This hearing is focused--and appropriately so--on Afghanistan and our military effort there, but it's important to emphasize, as we have from the beginning, that this campaign is not about a single country or a single terrorist network. Al-Qaeda alone is spread throughout the world; it is a network. A network, by its very nature, is based on the idea that should one node be eliminated, the network can still continue to function. Well before September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda had burrowed into some 60 nations, including the United States and Germany, France and Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines. It had critical nodes in Hamburg, Germany and Jacksonville, Florida as well as Afghanistan. The pilots who flew the suicide attacks were not trained in Afghanistan; many got their training in the United States. Afghanistan was an important node in the network, but by its nature a network does not have a headquarters. So, while we focus on Afghanistan today, we must understand that Afghanistan is only one node of this terrorist network. The very name of this organization, al- Qaeda, which means ``base'' in Arabic, indicates that the entire organization is the base of terrorist operations. It is spread throughout the world and it needs to be eliminated, root and branch. In Afghanistan, where al-Qaeda's malignant plots and plans flourished under the protection of the tyrannical and corrupt Taliban, America's armed forces went to work to root out both. Our intent, as Secretary Rumsfeld said, was to deprive the terrorists of a sanctuary in Afghanistan where they could safely plan, train and organize--not only to capture and kill terrorists, but to drain the swamp in which they breed. Over the last eight months, with our coalition partners, we have defeated a vicious and repressive regime that gave refuge to evil. We have killed or captured many of its ringleaders. And we have others on the run, where they are more vulnerable. Even in Afghanistan, our work is far from complete, although we are encouraged by the many truly remarkable aspects of the campaign to date. Our military campaign in Afghanistan has had some striking features, some surprising, others less so. Not surprisingly, we have seen America's Armed Forces conduct their operations with great bravery and skill, as we saw at Mazar-e-sharif, Tora Bora and in Operations Anaconda and Mountain Lion. What may have been a surprise to some was the remarkable speed with which military plans were put together, the swift success of the military operations--in weeks rather than months, and with relatively few troops on the ground. On September 11th, there simply was no war plan on the shelf for Afghanistan. General Franks was starting from scratch on September 20 when he received the order to begin planning, but less than three weeks later, on October 7th, we commenced the military operations. And less than two weeks after that, troops were operating on the ground. In many ways, it was a remarkable feat of logistical and operational agility. Another element of our success, which was undoubtedly a surprise to the terrorists and barely noticed by many others, was something that did not happen, something that calls to mind Sherlock Holmes' famous observation about the dog that didn't bark. We did not become bogged down in a quagmire--unlike the British in the 19th century and the Soviets in the 20th century. Nations that arrive in Afghanistan with massive armies tend to be treated as invaders, and they regret it. Mindful of that history, General Franks deliberately and carefully kept our footprint small to avoid just such a predicament. On balance, our partnership with indigenous forces has been very positive. From the beginning of the war on terrorism, we have stressed the importance of understanding the nature of our enemy as a world-wide network. Al-Qaeda is not a snake that can be killed by lopping off its head. It is more analogous to a disease that has infected many parts of a healthy body. There is no one single solution. You can't simply cut out one infected area and declare victory, but success in one area can lead to success in other areas as well. The bottom line, as President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld have repeatedly cautioned, is that this campaign will be a long and difficult one. Coalition forces have eliminated the secure operating environment that al-Qaeda enjoyed in Afghanistan and degraded cohesion of the worldwide network. Well over 500 enemy--including somewhat less than half of the top 30 leaders--have been killed or captured--as a result of operations in Afghanistan and are currently held in Guantanamo or in Afghanistan. Equally important, if not more so, the world-wide efforts of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies, in cooperation with more than 90 countries, have resulted in the arrest of some 2,400 individuals. Our military success in Afghanistan has contributed to that success by encouraging others to cooperate. Our efforts in Afghanistan have also helped law enforcement actions more directly. Abu Zubayda, one of bin Laden's key lieutenants, driven out of his sanctuary in Afghanistan and was captured last March; his partial cooperation in turn contributed to the detention of Jose Padilla, who came into the United States with the intention of planning and coordinating terrorist attacks. A Moroccan detainee in Guantanamo told of three Saudis planning terrorist acts in Morocco, all of whom were subsequently arrested, including one top al-Qaeda operative. In December, the discovery of a videotape in a safe house in Afghanistan led to the arrest of an al-Qaeda cell in Singapore that was planning to attack a U.S. aircraft carrier and U.S. personnel in that country. President Musharraf's leadership has made Pakistan a much less friendly environment for Taliban and al-Qaeda. Since last fall, the U.S. has sent the government of Pakistan about 1,500 requests for assistance on terrorist suspects. They have responded to most of them and continue to work on others. In the course of numerous raids on foreign terrorist suspects, some 370 arrests have been made. These developments are encouraging. However, it is important to remember that al-Qaeda is still dangerous and active. This network still poses threats that should not be underestimated. However, when the network as a whole is under pressure and on the run, it becomes harder for them to carry out their evil plans and more likely that they will make mistakes that permit us to capture more of them. ii. helping to build a stable afghanistan While our primary mission in Afghanistan has been to kill or capture terrorists who threaten the United States or those who have harbored them, it is also important to help the Afghans establish long- term stability in that country, so that Afghanistan does not once again become an outlaw country that provides sanctuary for terrorists. While the success of those efforts will depend most of all on the Afghans themselves, the United States and its coalition partners have a critical role to play in achieving that goal. In shaping that role, as in shaping the military campaign itself, we have been very mindful of the historical Afghan animosity to foreign armies and foreign occupiers. We have always viewed our mission in Afghanistan as one of liberation, not one of occupation. So with this in mind, we have tackled the challenge of striking the balance between keeping Afghanistan from reverting back to a terrorist sanctuary, and keeping our footprint small. Afghans are an independent, proud people. For that reason, we have emphasized from the beginning that we intend to minimize the number of troops there, and to focus instead on helping the Afghan people to help themselves in their journey to representative self-governance. We have made it clear, and we need to continue to do so: we have no intent of ``colonizing'' Afghanistan. We have been careful, through our actions and through our words, to avoid creating the expectation that the United States is going to solve all of the Afghanistan's problems. We have made a determined effort not to take sides in Afghanistan's internal politics. In fact, we have seen that Afghans are good at solving problems when they must; and we must let them deal with as many as they can. If a representative government is to take hold, Afghans themselves are the only ones who can make self-government a reality. President Bush has said that the United States does not intend to create the future government of Afghanistan. ``It is up to the Afghans themselves,'' he said, ``to determine their future.'' As they do, the United States and our allies will continue to support the new Transitional Authority and the people of Afghanistan. Their success will contribute, not only to the long-term stability of Afghanistan, but to the peace and security of the world at large. There are positive signs that the Afghans are making progress. Just last week, the Afghan people made a significant step forward when more than 1,500 delegates from all 32 provinces and ethnic backgrounds came together under one roof. When this traditional loya jirga, or Grand Council, elected Hamid Karzai president of the new two-year transitional government based on Western-style ideas of control and accountability. A Karzai senior advisor captured how extraordinary was this first step, saying that, for the first time in 23 years, the people of Afghanistan are acquiring a voice. Along with self-government must come self-sufficiency in terms of Afghanistan's security. That task is made more challenging by the formidable geography of Afghanistan. It is a country roughly the size of Texas, with peaks in the Hindu Kush (or ``Hindu Killer'') Range that reach some 24,000 feet--ten thousand feet higher than the highest of the Rockies. The sheer size and unforgiving terrain of the country has been a major factor in the planning of our military operations and remains a key factor in planning long-term security arrangements. Encouragingly, the situation is becoming more stable. Out of 32 provinces in Afghanistan, our forces have experienced harassment attacks mainly in five provinces, in the Taliban heartland of southern and eastern Afghanistan. The Taliban have so far failed to mount their often predicted spring offensive. The loya jirga convened with no serious security incidents--despite numerous threats--and clashes among militia leaders have been limited. The Taliban regime collapsed quickly with no successor. Not surprisingly, criminal activity revived faster than police forces could be created. This activity tends to be localized along routes through which international aid flows: from the North and from Pakistan-- incidentally, traditional areas for banditry. Afghanistan's lack of infrastructure is another hindrance, not only to maintaining security, but also to distributing humanitarian aid. From the beginning, humanitarian operations were a key part of our military operations--a concerted effort to reverse the desperate conditions created by the Taliban regime. Just one week before September 11th, the U.N. warned that 5.5 million Afghans, surviving on cattle feed, grass and insects, were facing death without immediate help. The defeat of the Taliban and the ending of civil war conditions have brought food to more than five million people who were facing famine last fall. Even before last September, the United States was the largest contributor of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. When military operations began last October, those efforts were stepped up, and, from the beginning, humanitarian missions were an integral part of our military missions. Today, the picture is vastly different. Easing the plight of widespread starvation was a humanitarian duty before the war. Today it is one of the keys to bolstering political and civil stability. Coalition partners are also contributing to stability through their humanitarian work. It is especially worth noting that Jordanian personnel have been running a field hospital that, to date, has treated 77,000 Afghan civilians. The Spanish and others have also provided assistance through their military hospitals. The Indians have provided a contingent of military medical personnel. The improvement in the situation is demonstrated by the fact that people are voting with their feet. In just the first five months of the year, 1.2 million refugees are recorded as having returned to Afghanistan already, which was the UN's projection for all of 2002. The UN has now doubled the target to two million. One crucial factor in the success of a representative government in Afghanistan is, first and foremost, a stable and secure environment in which it can gain a firm hold and ultimately flourish. The U.S. is committed to working with the Afghan Transitional Authority and the international community to find effective solutions to the remaining challenges to Afghanistan's security. One of the most important pieces is training the Afghan army. At the beginning of May, U.S. Army instructors took on the task of helping build an Afghan national army, by initiating the training of the initial group of Afghan recruits for the new Afghan National Army (ANA). Coalition partners are assisting in this effort. France has already begun training a battalion, and other countries, including the U.K., Turkey, Bulgaria, Poland, Korea, India, and Romania, are assisting with personnel or funding or equipment. In the process, we are also ``training the trainers'' so that the process can become self- sustaining. To further enhance regional stability, the 18-nation International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) has been helping to stabilize the situation in the capital city of Kabul since January. The British did a splendid job leading that effort in its first six months, and we expect the same from our Turkish allies who have now taken over the lead. Last month, the United Nations Security Council extended ISAF's mandate in Kabul until the end of the year. ISAF forces helped train the Afghan National Guard to protect Kabul during the loya jirga, which was held without incident. Other important efforts to provide a more secure environment include the German-led police training program and British counter drug operations. However, the most important instrument that the Afghan Authority and we have to establish a stable security situation is the leverage provided by economic assistance. It is in our interests to provide such assistance, and to help Afghans rebuild their country after almost a quarter century of war so it will not again become a haven for terrorists. The leadership provided by the State Department as described by Secretary Armitage, has been key to that effort. Particularly important was the organization of the Tokyo Donors Conference that Secretary Armitage has described. Our troops on the ground are also making a direct contribution to economic assistance, implementing humanitarian projects across Afghanistan that include repairing hospitals, digging wells, and repairing irrigation canals. We repaired or built 48 schools in eight different regions of Afghanistan. And for over 30,000 children for whom the sound of gunfire was a natural part of life, school is open, certainly one of the most far-reaching ways we have helped shape their future. In Herat, with just a few U.S. personnel, a U.S. Civil Affairs project, using local labor, de-silted over 250 kilometers of irrigation canals, allowing thousands of farm families to do their spring planting. The Department is allotting $10 million dollars for more than 75 such projects, anticipated to continue through the next 12 to 18 months. These activities have been coordinated with civilian relief organizations and have already begun to positively impact the lives of many Afghans. In support of U.S. reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, CENTCOM is also executing a plan to co-locate personnel from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department with our special forces and civil affairs teams that are operating throughout Afghanistan. This will allow USAID's people to get out beyond Kabul and better monitor U.S. assistance, while also providing them some protection in what remains an insecure environment. CENTCOM's humanitarian efforts have been undertaken to reduce the suffering of the Afghan people, and in the process, have helped build the conditions for a stable peace--an outgrowth of health, food, educational, and economic security. The. U.S. military is proud of its contribution to the important efforts of USAID, the U.S. Department of State, the U.N. and other international agencies and non-government organizations to provide a better life and a better future for the people of Afghanistan. conclusion Along with the many other law-enforcement, diplomatic, financial and intelligence efforts now underway, the campaign in Afghanistan has contributed to the disruption of the global terror network in tangible and far-reaching ways. But, our task extends well beyond Afghanistan and will be a long and difficult one. The stakes are enormous. As President Bush said, speaking to cadets at West Point two weeks ago, ``we have our best chance since the rise of the nation state in the 17th century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war.'' We can do this is not by imposing our own model of human progress on other nations of the world. But, as he said, we can support this effort ``when we reward governments that make the right choices for their own people. In our development aid, in our diplomatic efforts, in our international broadcasting, and in our educational assistance, the United States will promote moderation and tolerance and human rights. And we will defend the peace that makes all progress possible.'' In Afghanistan today, we see a democratic spirit rising from the remnants of a once-failed state that is trying to defy the ravages of decades of war and misrule. Despite a beginning that will, at times, be rocky and no doubt suffer some setbacks, the Afghan people are hopeful for a new tomorrow--hopeful they, too, can have a chance at peace instead of war. We remain committed to doing our part to help them on their journey. And we want history ultimately to judge us as having been dedicated to liberation, not occupation. We appreciate this Committee's continued leadership and guidance in these ongoing efforts. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. We will take 7-minute rounds so everybody gets in, and then if you have time, we will try for a second round. Let me begin by saying to you both that, speaking for myself, I think it is a remarkable military undertaking. Having spent 4 or 5 days down on the ground, it was impressive. It continues to be impressive, and I think, notwithstanding the fact that it is going to be fairly easy to Monday morning quarterback everything about every operation, I think we should all be very proud of what you have put together, and what our fighting women and men did. I must tell you, I have had this conversation with Secretary Armitage. I wish every American could see those young women and men. I mean they are incredible and will make everybody proud. But what I want to talk about is not to second-guess anything we have done so far, I want to figure out what we do from here. Would one of you, or both of you--I will just ask a generic question, rather than the finely tuned questions my staff have developed here, and that is: Explain to me what the role is of the warlords. In Mazar, Dostam is obviously the guy in charge, but there is a power struggle going on up there. In Herat, there is--obviously, you have a guy named Ismail Khan, who is a tough actor, and there seems to be some more to that. I am going to put a map up here, in the absence of my ranking member. This is too hard to see from here, but these various indications show armed clashes, attacks against minorities, attacks against refugees, attacks and intimidation of loya jirga candidates, and attacks and intimidation of women, and attacks on international humanitarian NGOs. Now, over in Iraq, there is not a lot happening there, which is good, on the surface; but when I was there, the talk was that we were all concerned about each of these warlords having their own sponsors. In Herat, we were worried about the Iranians and their cooperation with Ismail Khan. I spent hours, and hours, and hours, literally, I mean 6 or 7 hours with the now officially near-term elected President and his people, including Tajiks in the administration. The concern was that these warlords all had their own agendas, and that although they could maintain peace, there would not be any loyalty to and/or allegiance to a central government. I thought--and it may be able to be done anyway, I thought our purpose here was not only to drain the swamp, but as--the Congressional Research Service, we asked them to look at this for us, and they came up with the following summary. It says, ``U.S.-led efforts to end Afghanistan's role as a host for Osama bin Laden and other anti-Western Islamic terrorists requires not only a defeat of the Taliban, but also the reconstruction of a stable, effective, and ideologically moderate Afghan state.'' Now, do we think that is true? I mean do we think-- obviously, defeating Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, everybody agrees on that one, but is it important, is it important that we be responsible for, the world community and us included, the reconstruction of a stable, effective, ideologically moderate Afghan state? Is that part of our charge? If it is, what role do these warlords play in bringing that about? Mr. Armitage. Mr. Chairman, I will give it a go first. You asked at the beginning what is the warlords' agenda. In effect, it is the same as it has been in the past. It is to hold on to power and be able to collect revenues. They want to be a large factor in whatever the future holds for Afghanistan. No. 2, you would have a very good sense of this after your excellent trip in January out there. The warlords, particularly the one to whom you referred, Mr. Dostam, feels that he and some of his Tajik colleagues have had the majority of the burden in the fighting, and they want the majority of the spoils. The latter question about is it our role to be involved in reconstruction, it seems to me that the President has made the decision that it is. He said that we are going to be involved for a long time and he made that very clear. We are going to be involved for a long time, not just in the sphere, which Paul and Secretary Rumsfeld are so responsible for in the military sphere, but in the reconstruction, along with the international conference. I think the fact that it was the United States, which was the convener, if you will, of the Tokyo Conference, it indicated that we are not going to have a half-measure. We are not going to make the mistake we made in 1989 and allow what is a very nation-state to backslide into becoming a swamp again. Mr. Wolfowitz. I will just add to that, I agree with everything that Secretary Armitage said. I think the basic strategy here is, first of all, to work with those warlords or regional leaders, whatever you prefer to call them, to encourage good behavior. I think we have a number of means for doing so. Some of them include local diplomacy. We have been engaging, particularly up in the Mazar-e-Sharif area, where you pointed out there have been some recent incidents, due to fighting between two different warlord factions, with our Special Forces who have considerable influence to encourage better behavior. As I mentioned in my testimony, we are arranging to have State Department people out in some of the provincial areas with our Special Forces, so that they can begin to exercise their good offices. I think it underscores the importance of economic assistance. Because, as Secretary Armitage said, at the end of the day, what these people want, among other things and perhaps most of all, are money and resources to help their people. The long term solution is to shift the balance of forces between the central government and the regions--training the Afghan army is a key element of doing that. Again, I cannot emphasize enough how important economic assistance is, because the more real resources that flow through Kabul, through the Transitional Authority, the more those local leaders have to look to Kabul. The Chairman. Well, is it not flowing directly, some of it directly to these warlords? In other words, one of the things we spent a lot of time talking about in Kabul, in Afghanistan, and here, with you, with the State Department, with the White House, is that Karzai's popularity and support rest on a couple of factors. One, he is viewed by all the parties--and when I met with Kanoni, and all the rest of these guys, they all said, basically, ``We are not crazy about the guy, but he is the best thing we have to get aid. He is a magnet for us.'' Two, he does not have an army. He does not have any guys. He cannot control it by himself. No. 3, he is the guy who represents the majority, but is going to count us in on the deal. So I thought, initially, the notion was that in order to give him some heft, we had to make sure that everybody understood that they had to go through him to get that road built in Herat, go through him to get that school reconstructed in Mazar, and as I understand it, that is not--let me just ask the question. Is that happening? How much goes directly, so that you have a guy like Birkat Khan who seized control of the whole province, being the guy who is building the road for the folks down the street? Mr. Armitage. First of all, Mr. Chairman, these warlords have access to their own resources for a lot of different reasons, some of them very bad, like drugs, and they can do anything with that, such as build roads, or anything else that they are able to. Our money goes into the central government, and we have relatively little, thus far, representation in the far-flung locations. This is why I put a lot of stock in what Paul was saying, by attaching USAID and State officers to the Special Forces units, whether they be in the number of a dozen or several dozen in various areas, so they can give us better advice on what sort of projects might reasonably be funded out of the central government's coffers. The Chairman. Well, I will come back to that. My time is up. Senator Lugar. Senator Lugar. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. As both of you mentioned, the work of our military has been tremendous, and almost semi-miraculous from a standing start, as Secretary Wolfowitz said. General Franks only started the planning on September 20, that part of the situation was unavoidable, but we quickly picked up our pace and succeeded. What is occurring now, it seems to me, does not necessarily have to be improvised in the same way, but I have a sense that it is being improvised. Let me review items that you both have discussed as objectives. One is democracy building respect for human rights educational opportunities, and economic assistance. We hope the latter leads to at least a reasonable economy, even if not a vibrant economy, as is often mentioned as the goal. It is not clear to me how much of that is occurring in Afghanistan; but some may, and probably a lot should. There must be a security framework around, so that as the democracy, the economy, and public diplomacy begin to work, it does not fall part at the fringes, outside of Kabul at the country's extremities. Likewise, how this fits with what we are doing. Do we have a plan or plans for Pakistan? Our commitments there are very substantial, or at least have been implied that way. Similsrly what are our commitments in Tajikstan, Uzbekistan and other countries nearby. My hope would be that at some point the administration would be able to provide, if not a book, at least a report as to how all of this is likely to be achieved over the course of an intermediate period of time. What I think we are getting, essentially, are reports of very commendable activities, but I do not have a confident sense of exactly where all of this leads, except that we are hopeful for the best. In part, there has to be improvisation. We have the 18 members of ISAF, and they have their own agendas, although they are coincident by and large with ours. We are committed, as Secretary Wolfowitz said, not to become bogged down, and there is a lot of thoughtfulness about how you do this without becoming bogged down. Likewise, how do we run military operations, the cleanup situation, or the activities at the border, even as we try to establish peace. Can either one of you give some idea as to what the thinking is in the administration pulling together State, Defense, Treasury, et cetera, and in some coherent plan that all of us could understand and support give some idea of what kind of financial commitments are required, not just for this year, but for several years down the trail? Mr. Armitage. Senator Lugar, I will commit to sending a letter to the committee, outlining just this, but I want to respond directly to your question, but it would be necessarily a lengthy response, and we'll do it. To the extent we have well developed thinking, and I appreciate your comments about the need for a little improv along the way, security is the overarching necessity. And, underneath that, we have agriculture, for the obvious reasons, and health, the next two in order of priority, and the reasons are quite obvious, because one half of the 26-plus million people in Afghanistan have a need either in the health area or in the food area. They have malnutrition, et cetera. So that gives you a pretty good idea of your next two priorities, and after that, education, which is right up next to it, and then infrastructure development. That is just sort of the priority, as we see it, and we are trying to put our money against it. Right now, Senator, in answer to your specific comments about democracy, human rights, et cetera, we have 21 State people at our embassy in Kabul, and seven USAID people, one person who covers human rights, and one who covers religious freedom and democracy. So I think, given the 10 percent of our staffing there, that will give you an idea of the emphasis we are putting on it. In terms of public diplomacy, I am pleased with our story. You are the ultimate judge, and I appreciate your comments about Under Secretary Beers, but in the last 4 months, we have increased Radio Free Afghanistan broadcasting to 7 hours a day. We have Voice of America, up from 2.5 to 6 hours a day. We have two transmitters being built, which will provide 24/7 coverage for radio, the principle means of communications in Afghanistan. We have exchange programs, one ongoing now with young students, called the Seeds of Peace program, and we have 12 participants here in the United States, and in August, we will have 18 women from the Women in Government group visit. We could have had it earlier, but we did not know who was going to be in government, and who was going to be around. So now that they have had their loya jirga, we are bringing them in August. We are dealing in the country with a literacy rate that is about 15 percent above the age of 15. So printed materials are not a desired medium across the board, unless they are very much pictographs. So I think we are alert to the problems of public diplomacy. I will send a letter to the committee with our full thinking and the numbers we think would be associated with this over the next several years, Senator. Senator Lugar. Well, that would be very helpful, because the letter apparently would be the plan. Mr. Armitage. Indeed. Senator Lugar It would illustrate the necessary elements that are important in all of this, and have money attached to it. That is important in giving us some idea of where we are headed in all this. Having said that, you mentioned you have an employee devoted to democracy and one devoted to human rights. Granted, the State Department might not have resources for more people there, but organizations like the National Endowment for Democracy, or others can be engaged. We must utilize all the tools at our disposal. It is extremely important, in terms of our national security, that Afghanistan be a success, so that there is, in the Muslim world, a success? In other words, the overall public diplomacy message that keeps coming to us is that polls of countries indicate people do not like us, and in some cases, that understates it. To what extent does success in Afghanistan help turn that around, offer a model of a better life for people, that represents our ideals and our country? Mr. Armitage. Sir, we are very bullish on the National Endowment of Democracy, as a general matter. We are going to make use of them in many countries around the world. I have Ambassador David Johnson with me here today, and he can provide the specifics about whatever contracts we may have with them right now. I do not know. Of the 21 people, as I mentioned, in the embassy now, we have two devoted to the issues that you mentioned. We are going up to 31 State people over the summer. We are only limited by the fact that they are living in trailers, and we have a chancery that partly works and partly does not. We do not have any living quarters, et cetera. The Chairman. Do the toilets flush yet? Mr. Armitage. They do, sir. I will not tell the story you told us about it. The Chairman. No, no, no. I want to make sure--well, do we need to provide money so you can build something else? I mean-- -- Mr. Armitage. We have the money in the supplemental, sir, for that, and I am anticipating no problem, other than getting the supplemental voted on. On the larger question of the necessity of a success, particularly in the Muslim world; absolutely, but it is tied, I think, to the country you mentioned earlier, Pakistan. I do not think we are actually going to have a success, unless we are successful in both countries. President Karzai has informed us that he is quite convinced of the sincerity of President Musharraf, and the fact that notwithstanding 10 or 11 years of a failed policy in Pakistan regarding support for the Taliban, that right now, Pakistan is on the right side of the ledger, President Musharraf is moving, I think, quite assiduously against madrasses, making them at least registered, if not getting rid of those that are beyond the pale. You saw in today's news broadcast that by virtue of the fact that he has ordered his soldiers into the heretofore forbidden tribal areas, they are suffering casualties very much at our behest, but I think the success has to be the success of both countries. Mr. Wolfowitz. Senator Lugar, if I might just make a point, on the security front. We do have a plan to train 14,400 soldiers for the Afghan army over the next 18 months, and quite frankly, we are looking at whether that number might be increased. The two biggest issues are recruitment and funding. I would appeal once again for congressional action on the State Department supplemental, which contains $50 million for training and $20 million for peacekeeping operation funds. The sooner we get that money, the sooner we will be able to look at expanding recruitment. Also, in our request for fiscal year 2003, we requested $100 million in authority to move DOD funds, if appropriate, from other programs or operational funds into this kind of training. I would appeal to get--I think it is not so far made it through the budget process up here--but I would appeal to you to try to consider that, because I think it would give us a great deal more flexibility if the opportunities develop to do more training. Senator Lugar. Thank you for those specific suggestions; we appreciate it. The Chairman. Senator Boxer has to leave, and Senator Nelson has been gracious enough to---- Senator Boxer. Well, I got here before he did. The Chairman. Of course, but I go by the seniority rule; but go ahead. Senator Boxer. No; I am senior to him. The Chairman. I know you are. Senator Boxer. So what is the problem? The Chairman. No problem. Senator Boxer. Thanks. The Chairman. I thought I was just being nice here. Senator Boxer. Senator, you are always nice. Senator Boxer. I just want to say to both of you, thank you very much for your focus on this. I could not agree more with Senator Lugar, as far as making Afghanistan a success, and it is in our hands, and that is the burden of being the leader of the free world, and we are, and in this particular case, we cannot afford failure. It is not an option, as they say. I also wanted to note again the presence of the women's groups who are here today, and to thank them from the bottom of my heart. Mr. Chairman and our Ranking Member, Senator Lugar, I think it is important to note what Bernard Lewis said, who is a great historian, and a pretty conservative one at that, and when asked by Charlie Rose if he could name the one reason that the Muslim countries have not been able to be successful, the answer came back without a moment's pause, ``The women. They have not allowed the women to be part of the society.'' This was quite an eloquent statement, I think, from him. So what I want to spend my time doing, and I hope to be able to do it on a one-on-one with you, Secretary Wolfowitz, if we have a chance, is to plead the case, make the case for immediate expansion of the international force. That does not mean our troops. It does not mean occupation. Of course, you are right on the point, it means protection, and protection is not occupation. When you have Hamid Karzai asking for this, and when you have Dr. Sima Samar, who the President was so gracious to put in the gallery, the First Lady's box, during the State of the Union Address, asking for this, and when you have the women coming to us via these women's organizations, and also in person, taking the risks of travel, to tell us this is their highest priority, and I would say, Secretary Armitage, you are right, they list security first, then they talk about education, health, and the rest. I just want to put into the record, Mr. Chairman, a couple of third party quotes from my position here. The international think tank, the International Crisis Group, wrote, ``The security situation outside Kabul remains tenuous, and roadside banditry and flare-ups of fighting between rival military factions have been common. Many unemployed former fighters, with weapons and time on their hands, represent a dangerous element.'' And they say, ``It is deeply troubling that some Afghans are expressing nostalgia for the relative security and stability that were present before.'' I think it is important, because we have to know history, that it was this very lack of security that led to the Taliban coming into power in the first place. The Taliban first gained the support of Pakistan in 1994, when they rescued a 30-truck Pakistani convoy that was hijacked by a warlord just south of Kandahar. The Taliban gained popularity throughout Afghanistan at that time by continuing to eliminate roadblocks that were set up by local warlords, where hijackings and extortion were common, and we know what happened then. Osama bin Laden was given haven, et cetera. None of us wants it to happen. You do not. We do not. It cannot happen. But I say that there is this lack of security. The International Crisis Group has recommended that force be increased from its current level of 4,500 to 25,000 troops, and other respective organizations, the Stimson Center called for 18,000 troops. I guess I am puzzled, because on this issue we have been so close together, people from different sides of the aisle, why there seems to be this hesitancy when it is not going to be American troops. Karzai is asking for it, and we know in 2 years, hopefully, the Afghan people can protect themselves. This is an interim kind of solution. During February and March of 2002, Human Rights Watch documented cases of sexual violence against Pushtun women, perpetrated by the three main ethnically based parties, and then militias in the north. Many women describe how they have to fight off attackers, or hide young female relatives out of fear of rape. We know Sima Samar herself had threats. She had to spend one night at the United Nations guest house. And outside of Kabul, it is far worse. Reuters reported in April an acid attack on a female teacher in Kandahar after handwritten pamphlets were found, circulating in the city, warning men against sending their daughters to school or their wives to work. I have heard first hand from Afghan women, who call my office, who say that security is their No. 1 concern. So I would say one more thing here. Bernette Rubin, an expert on Afghanistan, wrote the following in the New York Times, ``Both Afghans and international officials see the refusal to expand the international force as the start of American disengagement repeating the mistake of the 1990s, despite promising to learn from that experience. Providing security for rebuilding Afghanistan is now the front line in the war against terrorism. Failure here will undermine all other commitments, and many fear failure has already started. There is still time to prove them wrong.'' Now, I do not believe that failure has started. I see so many wonderful, good things, and when Secretary Armitage talked about the loya jirga, and the women's voice, and the fact that in this amazing setting, things got accomplished, and got done, and Karzai was--these are all wonderful things. I am just concerned that for some doctrinaire reason-- occupation, that is not what we are asking for. We are saying, protection of the people. It is a short-term thing. I would hope we could get past this idea that if we do support a larger troop deployment, it is occupation, because I do not see that at all. I see it as an interim measure, and I--in the time remaining, I wonder if you could comment, is your mind opened at all to this? Mr. Wolfowitz. First of all, let me say, I agree with a great deal of what you said, particularly about the importance of women, both in Afghanistan and in the Muslim world, in the larger sense. There are a few things that are just factually wrong, and it is important to start from the right set of facts. Whoever referred to the relative stability and security that were provided by the Taliban obviously did not read about the 5 million people on the verge of starvation, or the civil war that was raging in that country. Senator Boxer. No, no. You misunderstood. Those were people who were telling reporters this. Of course, it is ridiculous, but if even some people think that, it is dangerous. Secretary Wolfowitz. But there has been a huge improvement in the situation. That it is not perfect is not surprising. It is a country that has been through 25 years of civil war, and it is going to take time. Things are not going to change immediately. But the other one is, there is no refusal to expand the Afghan force, whether it is referring to the Afghan army, where I have been saying over and over again, we would like more money to be able to expand it faster, or whether it is referring to ISAF, where there is absolutely no doctrine. I mean, no one is saying that we are opposed to expanding ISAF, or opposed to having it play other roles. Our biggest problem so far has been sustaining ISAF in its present role. One of our big diplomatic challenges of the last few months, which we were successful at, was finding someone to take over the lead from the British in ISAF. When the Turks agreed to take it over, they expressed extreme reluctance to take on missions outside of Kabul. That does not mean that we are holding a doctrine opposed to looking at other roles, but it is important to remember both the magnitude of the problems that this government has inherited, and the sheer size and unruliness of the country. Are there going to be problems? We are going to make progress on them, it seems to me, step by step. I think we are making steady progress, but one of the reasons why we say it is going to be a long road is that there is a lot of work to do. But there is no doctrine involved here at all. We are trying to do whatever makes sense to stabilize that country. Mr. Armitage. Mr. Chairman, if I may. The Chairman. Yes. Mr. Armitage. You have an exquisite understanding of the problems of women in Afghanistan, but I want to get on the record about this. Security is the overarching one, but 23 years of war, the years of Taliban rule, have all brought other things to the fore that we have to be attacking simultaneously. It is not just a matter of empowerment of women, which is important in and of itself. We have an education problem. During the Taliban rule, of those eligible for primary school, 39 percent of boys went to school, only 3 percent of women were enrolled in school. Right now, out of 4.4 million primary school-eligible kids, we have over 3 million enrolled, so almost 75 percent. Now, women, or girls, lag behind boys, but we are well up to the 60 percentile mark of girls going to school. If you look at the health care area, one in 15 Afghan women dies as a result of a pregnancy, or a post-natal problem. That compares to one in 3,000 here in the United States. One in four kids in Afghanistan die before they are 5 years old. So we have a whole bunch of problems to attack at the same time, and not just the ISAF ones. Senator Boxer. Right. Mr. Chairman, I am going to end here and just say this. I sense a little bit of spark of hope there when you say there is no doctrinaire approach to this, you are going to look at this. So I feel that it is hopeful. Let me just say, you cannot go to the doctor, and you cannot go to school, indeed, you cannot go out of your house if you do not feel safe; so protection, it seems to me, is the key here. I hope we will listen more to the voice of the women there, because that really is the voice of the people, I think. And if we do that, I feel so confident that this will, in fact, be the model that Senator Lugar is looking for. I thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you. Let me make sure about, I guess, something factual. There is no doctrinaire position, but we did--I met with the British one-star who was in charge of that operation, and with our military there. We are not opposed to expansion of ISAF, but we made clear we would be no part of it; is that right? Mr. Wolfowitz. The ISAF leadership was held by the British and then by the Turks, and we are trying to keep our forces focused on their job of finding terrorists and finding Taliban. The Chairman. That is not my question, Paul. I know that. That is our first job. But did we not--I was told by the Brits that we explicitly said we would not be part of an ISAF force, period; is that right or wrong? Mr. Wolfowitz. And we are not part of ISAF. The Chairman. No, not that we ``are not,'' we would not, under any circumstances be part of an ISAF force; is that correct? Mr. Wolfowitz. Well, actually, Secretary Armitage is reminding me, we have 36 people in the headquarters helping to advise them. There is a very close relationship between ISAF and CENTCOM. We provide a lot of the basic support that makes them safe and secure. They are really two operations that are connected to one another. The Chairman. Well, let me say it another way, and you sound like your State Department guy now; no offense, Mr. Secretary. Mr. Armitage. What does the State Department guy sound like, Mr. Chairman? The Chairman. Not like you. Thank, God. I mean thank God, you do not sound like him. Let me make sure I understand this. I was told the following, with a U.S. colonel standing with me, who was a liaison to the ISAF force, and a captain. After a 2-hour brief, I was told in February and then again in May, that we said we would not be a part of an expansion of ISAF, no U.S. boots would be on the ground with an ISAF force, if it expanded. Second, I was told by, and I do not want to--I was told by ISAF officers that they thought that would be all right, if we had made a commitment to be an extraction force, if they expanded, or if we were prepared to provide other guarantees of participation with them. As the British one-star, whose name escapes me now, said, ``Senator, how long do you think my Parliament will let me stay here, absent your full participation with us?'' I then met with Mr. Brohimi, who indicated that the Turks had told him that they were looking "
