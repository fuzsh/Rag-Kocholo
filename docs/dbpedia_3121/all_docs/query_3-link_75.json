        "text": "The awesome, exalted Christ whom John sees and hears (1:10–20) directly addresses the seven churches named in 1:11. These messages to the churches follow a common literary structure:\n\nInstruction to write to the church’s angel (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14)\n\nChrist’s self-description (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14)\n\nChrist’s knowledge of the church (2:2, 9, 13, 19; 3:1, 8, 15)\n\nCommendation (2:2–3, 6, 9, 13, 19, 24; 3:4, 8, 10)\n\nCorrection (2:4, 14–15, 20–23; 3:1–2, 15–17)\n\nCommand to repent (2:5, 16; 3:3, 19) or remain faithful (2:10, 25; 3:11)\n\nSummons to hear what the Spirit says (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22)\n\nPromise for those who overcome (2:7, 11, 17, 26–28; 3:5, 12, 21)\n\nChrist relates details of his self-disclosure in chapter 1 to each church’s situation. He asserts his detailed knowledge of each church, commends the faithful, corrects those who compromise through sin and false teaching, and promises that glorious blessings await those who “conquer” through steadfast endurance. It is noteworthy that John writes to seven churches. The number seven is common in Revelation (seven churches, angels, Spirits, lampstands, seals, trumpets, bowls, etc.) and probably signifies perfection or completion. Thus, while Christ’s messages address the situations of seven first-century churches, they never circulated separately as individual letters, and they address all believers who read this book of prophecy and must hear what the Spirit says to all churches. (See Table: Christ’s Messages to the Churches)\n\nTo Ephesus (2:1–7)\n\nEphesus was the leading city of Asia and the fourth largest city in the Roman Empire, home to the famed temple of Artemis (Acts 19:27, 35). While Christ commends the Ephesian church for their good works and doctrinal fidelity, they have forsaken their first love and must repent (2:2–6).\n\n2:1 Christ addresses Ephesus and the other churches through their representative “angel” (cf. 1:20), which reminds believers on earth of the unseen, spiritual realities of their situation and of their need for heavenly help. The Greek phrase Tade legei (“The words of him”) repeatedly introduces God’s words in the OT, signaling that Christ speaks with divine authority. Christ’s self-description in 2:1 recalls John’s foundational vision in 1:12–16 and highlights Christ’s awesome power (holding seven stars) and active presence among the churches (walking among the lampstands).\n\n2:2–6 Christ commends the church for its hard work, perseverance, and discernment. These believers were not led astray by so-called apostles or the Nicolaitans (2:6), who promoted false doctrine, idolatry, and immorality like Balaam and Jezebel (2:14, 20); rather, the Ephesians tested their teaching and conduct and rightly discerned their error (cf. 2Cor 11:13–15). However, Christ rebukes the Ephesians for abandoning the love they had at first. This “love” may refer to their love for Jesus (Eph 6:24) and/or their love for one another (Eph 5:2). The two references to lampstands in this passage may also suggest that this church has forgotten their calling as Christ’s witnesses who must bear light in a dark world (cf. Matt 5:14–16).\n\nThree commands follow from this correction: “remember . . . repent . . . do the works you did at first” (2:5). Jesus calls the church to reassess their situation and change their mind, heart, and deeds. Unless they repent of their lack of love, Christ will “remove” their lampstand, meaning they will lose their very identity as a church.\n\n2:7 “He who has an ear, let him hear” recalls similar hearing formulas in the OT and the Gospels (Isa 6:9–10; Jer 5:21; Ezek 3:27; 12:2; Mark 4:9; cf. Rev 13:9). Ears in these passages symbolize people’s spiritual capacity to receive and respond to truth. Those with “an ear” rightly discern that God’s Spirit and the exalted Christ speak to the churches in this book, and they rightly respond to the prophetic word.\n\nEach of Christ’s messages to the churches concludes with a promise “to the one who conquers.” The Greek verb nikaō is variously translated as “conquer,” “overcome,” or “have victory.” Believers do not conquer by military might like the beast (13:7). Jesus conquered as the slain Lamb (5:5), and his followers share in his victory (17:14), must faithfully speak Christ’s word (12:11, 17), and must maintain hope in their future inheritance (21:7).\n\nChrist promises that conquerors will eat from “the tree of life” (2:7; cf. 22:2, 14, 19), which signifies eternal life in fellowship with God. Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit and were exiled from the tree of life in Eden (Gen 3:6, 22–24), but those redeemed by Christ await unbridled fellowship with God in the new creation. This promise also counters the popular expectation that Artemis, the patron deity of Ephesus, offered life and fertility to those who worshiped at her tree-shrine.\n\nTo Smyrna (2:8–11)\n\nSmyrna (modern-day Izmir, Turkey) was a harbor city located about thirty-five miles north of Ephesus. It was well known as Homer’s birthplace and was one of Asia’s most beautiful cities. It also featured a temple to the goddess Roma and was an important center of emperor worship. Of the seven churches Jesus addresses in Revelation, only Smyrna and Philadelphia do not receive correction/rebuke. Here Jesus encourages the church at Smyrna not to fear suffering but to remain faithful and so inherit eternal life.\n\n2:8–9 The exalted Christ presents himself as “the first and the last,” a divine title stressing his divine sovereignty over history (cf. 1:17). “Tribulation” recalls the partnership John and his readers share in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance that are in Christ (1:9). The tribulation this church faces includes economic hardship (“poverty”) and verbal abuse (“slander”) from the local Jewish population that has aligned with Satan against God’s purposes and people and is thus called “a synagogue of Satan” (cf. 3:9). Smyrna is the opposite of Laodicea: materially poor yet spiritually rich (cf. 3:17).\n\n2:10–11 Because Jesus himself “died and came to life” (1:18; 2:8), embattled believers do not need to fear suffering and death (2:10). Christ summons the saints in Smyrna to prepare for further suffering and Satanic opposition. “Ten days” recalls the period of testing for Daniel and his friends in Babylon (Dan 1:12–14); here it refers to an intense but brief time of testing through adversity. Rather than fearing the coming suffering, believers must follow Christ’s example of faithfulness unto death while trusting his promise to give them “the crown of life” (cf. 3:11). Crowns or wreaths were given to champion athletes, victors in battle, and honorable public servants. Jesus promises that believers who “conquer” through suffering and death will receive true honor and everlasting life and will be spared from “the second death,” the lake of fire (20:6, 14; 21:8).\n\nTo Pergamum (2:12–17)\n\nPergamum (modern-day Bergama, Turkey) was a magnificent city about seventy miles north of Smyrna. It had a renowned library and was Asia’s foremost city for emperor worship. Jesus commends this church for remaining faithful through persecution but calls them to repent of doctrinal and moral compromise.\n\n2:12–13 Jesus addresses Pergamum as the one with “the sharp two-edged sword” coming from his mouth (2:12; cf. 1:16; 2:16; Isa 11:4; 49:2). Jesus, not Rome, possesses absolute authority to judge. This truth offers comfort to faithful believers threatened by Roman persecution (2:13) and challenges the unfaithful to repent of idolatrous compromise (2:16). “Satan’s throne” may refer to Pergamum’s altar of Zeus (king of gods), the shrine to Asclepius (god of medicine), the prominent practice of emperor worship, or to Antipas’s unjust execution by local authorities.\n\n2:14–16 Christ rebukes Pergamum for tolerating false teaching. Balaam was the notorious Gentile prophet who blessed Israel when Balak hired him to curse them (Num 22–24; Deut 23:4; Neh 13:2). Balaam then encouraged Israel to engage in sexual immorality and idolatry (Num 25:1–2; 31:16; cf. Jude 11; 2Pet 2:15) and later died by the sword (Josh 13:22). Like Balaam, false teachers in Pergamum are motivated by financial gain and condone culturally acceptable practices of idolatry and sexual immorality. “Nicolaitans” means “victory people.” Revelation does not give details about their heresy, but their name suggests that they may have promoted victorious living apart from obedience to Christ. Ephesus opposes their false teaching and practices, but some in Pergamum do not (2:6, 15). Jesus commands the church to “repent” of this immorality and false teaching or else face swift judgment like Christ’s enemies (2:16; 19:15, 21).\n\n2:17 To believers who overcome, Christ promises “hidden manna” and “a white stone” with a new name. Exodus 16:31–34 describes the white-colored manna God sent to feed his people and instructs Israel to preserve an omer of this bread for future generations. Jesus, the “living bread” (John 6:51), promises everlasting food to this church tempted by the food sacrificed to idols. White stones in the ancient world had various connotations, including acquittal in court and admission to special feasts. Here, the white stone has “a new name” on it, a name that will be written on believers as well (2:17; 3:12; 22:3–4). This new name refers to believers’ identification with Christ and their enduring status as his people.\n\nTo Thyatira (2:18–29)\n\nThyatira was a commercial town about forty miles southeast of Pergamum. It was the hometown of Lydia, “a dealer in purple cloth” (Acts 16:14), and was known for its many influential trade guilds, each with a patron deity. While Thyatira is the least significant of the seven cities to which John writes, surprisingly this church receives the longest, most challenging message. Christ commends Thyatiran believers for their love and faith but rebukes them for tolerating heresy and immorality.\n\n2:18 Christ identifies himself first as “the Son of God,” a common NT title for Jesus, probably drawn from Psalm 2:7 (cf. Mark 1:1; John 1:34). Jesus, not Apollo (son of Zeus), is the true divine Son worthy of worship. Christ’s fiery eyes and bronze feet recall John’s opening vision (1:14–15; cf. Dan 10:6) and stress his divine glory and insight as the one who “searches hearts and minds” (2:23; cf. Jer 17:10).\n\n2:19–23 Christ knows the church’s “works,” namely their love, faith, service, and patient endurance (cf. 1:9). This list suggests their virtue and faithful ministry. Unlike the Ephesians, the Pergamum church’s latter works suggest progress rather than decline. Following this commendation, Christ chides the Thyatiran church for tolerating “Jezebel,” a pseudonym that reveals the true character of this false prophet who deceptively leads the church to “practice sexual immorality” and “eat food sacrificed to idols” (2:20; cf. 2:14). The symbolic name “Jezebel” alludes to King Ahab’s wife, who promoted unparalleled Baal worship and evil in Israel (1Kgs 16:31–32; 21:25–26). Because “Jezebel” refuses to repent, Christ will judge her and her idolatrous followers with sickness and death (2:21–23). Christ does not judge by mere appearances but knows people’s hearts and minds and gives them what their deeds deserve as the divine Judge (cf. Jer 17:10).\n\n2:24–25 Christ addresses the faithful believers in Thyatira who do not follow “Jezebel” and have not learned the so-called “deep things of Satan,” a reference to the false teaching that Christians with superior knowledge could continue to practice idolatry without being spiritually harmed. Christ does not lay on these believers “any other burden”—recalling the apostolic decree in Acts 15:28–29—and exhorts them to “hold fast what you have” until he comes (cf. 3:11).\n\n2:26–29 Christ’s earlier self-description as “the Son of God” (2:18; cf. Ps 2:7) underscores his promise to share his regal authority with his people. According to 12:5 and 19:15, Christ will “rule . . . with a rod of iron,” fulfilling Psalm 2:9 LXX; in 2:27 he extends this promise to his victorious followers. Moreover, he promises to give overcomers “the morning star” (2:28), a messianic symbol (Num 24:17) that Jesus directly applies to himself (22:16).\n\nTo Sardis (3:1–6)\n\nLocated about thirty-five miles southeast of Thyatira, Sardis had a glorious past and a reputation as a secure military stronghold. An earthquake devastated the city in AD 17, and it was rebuilt with Roman aid and returned to prominence. Jesus rebukes this church for their spiritual lethargy and urges them to wake up and repent.\n\n3:1 The exalted Christ reminds Sardis that he “has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars.” The former refers to the seven-fold Spirit, which is before God’s throne (1:4) and rests on the Lamb (5:6; cf. Isa 11:2). The latter recalls the seven stars in Christ’s right hand (1:16; cf. 2:1), signifying angels of the seven churches (1:20). This church desperately needs the life-giving power of the divine Spirit and the heavenly help that only Christ can offer.\n\nChrist then diagnoses the church’s true spiritual state: their reputation (“being alive”) does not match their reality (“you are dead”). The Greek word onoma occurs four times in the message to Sardis (“reputation” [3:1]; “names” [3:4]; “name” [2x in 3:5]), signaling a key emphasis on the church’s reputation and identity. This once vibrant church is now cold, lifeless, and in danger of extinction (3:2). Jesus finds their “works” incomplete, like the city’s unfinished, useless temple to Artemis.\n\n3:2–3 Christ gives five commands: “wake up . . . strengthen . . . remember . . . keep . . . repent.” He discloses the church’s perilous situation and calls for vigilance and radical change. Christ elsewhere likens his second coming to a thief visiting a house and calls his people to remain watchful and ready (cf. Matt 24:42–44; Luke 12:39–40; Rev 16:15). The warning in 3:3 may similarly refer to this coming at the end of history or may signal an imminent, unexpected coming within history to judge the church if it fails to repent (cf. 2:5, 16).\n\n3:4 As in the message to Thyatira, Christ rebukes the church as a whole but then reassures a faithful remnant: there are “a few names in Sardis” who “are worthy.” Their unsoiled garments refer to their righteous deeds and pure life (cf. 14:4; 19:8), which give evidence that they belong to Christ and will share in his end-time victory (cf. 7:9; 19:14).\n\n3:5 Christ’s promise to the conquerors returns to two motifs mentioned earlier in this message. First, “white garments” continues the thought of 3:4 and suggests cleansing from defilement through Christ’s blood and moral purity (7:14). Second, Christ will confess the believer’s “name” (onoma) and never remove it from the book of life. Thus, rather than finding security in an impressive “name” among people (3:1), they should desire above all to be known and named by Christ (3:5; cf. Luke 10:20; 12:8).\n\nTo Philadelphia (3:7–13)\n\nPhiladelphia (modern-day Alashehir, Turkey) was situated along key trade routes about thirty miles southeast of Sardis. After the Roman emperor helped the city rebuild following the earthquake of AD 17, Philadelphia (meaning “brotherly love”) took on the name Neocaesarea (meaning “Caesar’s new city”). Christ commends the faithful Philadelphian church and calls them to hold fast through trials.\n\n3:7 Christ presents himself first as “the holy one, the true one,” a description elsewhere used for God (6:10), whom Isaiah repeatedly calls “the Holy One of Israel.” Moreover, Christ “has the key of David,” which alludes to Isaiah 22:22. Keys signify authority and control. Because the risen Christ is the true Messianic king who holds “the keys of Death and Hades” (1:18), he alone has sovereign authority to grant people access to the kingdom (cf. Matt 16:19).\n\n3:8–10 Christ commends this church for not denying their Lord even though they have “little power”—meaning a lack of influence or strength in themselves. Christ reassures the church that he has set before them “an open door,” which refers either to an opportunity for gospel ministry (cf. 2Cor 2:12; Col 4:3) or access by faith into God’s kingdom, as in 3:7 (cf. Acts 14:27). “The synagogue of Satan” (3:9) signals that the Philadelphian church—like their brothers in Smyrna (2:9)—faced persecution from Jews in their area. These Christians may have been excluded from the Jewish synagogue (cf. John 9:22; 12:42; 16:2), but Christ will vindicate his followers. Isaiah prophesied that Gentile oppressors would bow down before Israel (Isa 49:23; 60:14); ironically, Jesus declares that the Jewish persecutors will humbly “come and bow down” before the church and recognize them as Christ’s beloved (cf. Isa 43:4). The commendation “you have kept [tēreō] my word” reiterates 3:8 and forms the basis for Christ’s promise, “I will keep you from [tēreō . . . ek] the hour of trial” (3:10). This “hour” refers to the period of end-time tribulation, what Daniel calls “the time of distress” (Dan 12:1). The purpose of this “hour” is “to test the inhabitants of earth” (NIV). Interpreters debate whether “keep from” means remove from the trial or preserve through the trial. The nearest parallel is John 17:15, where Christ asks God not to take his people out of (ek) the world but to keep them from (tēreō . . . ek) Satan. Thus, Christ promises to protect his people from spiritual harm, not remove them from suffering. This time of testing serves to prove believers’ faith and commitment to Christ (cf. 7:14; 1Pet 1:6–7), while further hardening unbelievers who follow the beast and oppose God’s people (13:8, 12).\n\n3:11 “I am coming soon” highlights one of the signature emphases of Revelation: Christ will return in glory at the end of history (1:7; 22:7, 12, 20), but he will also come to his churches to judge and save in anticipation of the end (cf. 2:5, 16, 25). “Hold fast” reiterates the command to Thyatiran believers in 2:25, while “your crown” is equivalent to “the crown of life” in 2:10.\n\n3:12–13 Christ then offers an expansive promise highlighting the end-time fellowship and identification with the Lord that faithful believers will enjoy in the new Jerusalem. The conquerors will be “a pillar” in God’s temple, emphasizing the enduring, glorious presence of God with his worshiping people (7:15; 21:2–3; cf. 2Cor 6:16). Moreover, the “name” of God, his city, and his Son will mark believers, signaling their new identity and eternal citizenship (22:3–4; Phil 3:20; Ezek 48:35).\n\nTo Laodicea (3:14–22)\n\nLaodicea was a prosperous city known for banking, medicine, and textile production, located about forty-five miles southeast of Philadelphia and close to Colossae (cf. Col 4:13). Christ sternly rebukes this church for their spiritual blindness and proud self-reliance, then he invites them to repent and enjoy renewed relationship with him.\n\n3:14 Christ is “the Amen, the faithful and true witness,” a title that identifies him with “the God of truth” (Isa 65:16) and recalls the salutation in 1:5. Jesus is faithful, while Laodicea has been unfaithful. He is also “the beginning” (ESV), or “ruler” (NIV), translating the Greek archē. Most likely, this title presents the risen Christ as the beginning of God’s new creation.\n\n3:15–16 Christ sharply censures this complacent church. “Hot,” “cold,” and “lukewarm” do not refer to the church’s spiritual enthusiasm. These terms may relate to the local context of Laodicea, which had poor tasting, tepid water unlike the refreshing hot water in Hierapolis and cold water in Colossae. Alternatively, Christ may here employ dining imagery that anticipates his appeal in 3:20. Regardless, Laodicea’s works and true spiritual condition repulse Christ; they cannot offer life, healing, or refreshment to others and must repent.\n\n3:17–18 “I am rich” recalls Israel’s boast in Hosea 12:8 and anticipates Jesus’s revelation of their spiritual poverty. The church desperately needs to forsake self-reliance, admit their own bankruptcy and blindness, and come to Jesus to find true spiritual resources (cf. Isa 55:1–3).\n\n3:19–20 Christ summons the church to “repent,” reminding them that he disciplines them out of love (cf. Prov 3:11–12; Heb 12:5–6). He presents himself knocking at the door, which may suggest the return of a master (Luke 12:36) or a husband (Song 5:2). Christ then promises to enter and dine with them, offering renewed, intimate fellowship with those who respond to his invitation.\n\n3:21–22 Jesus conquered and “sat down” on God’s throne as the messianic King and Judge (cf. Ps 110:1; Heb 1:3), and he promises that his followers who conquer will share his reign (2:26–27; 5:10; 20:4; 22:5). This declaration of Christ’s enthronement sets the stage for John’s vision of the heavenly throne room and the conquering Lamb in chapters 4–5.\n\nThroughout Revelation the number seven expresses fullness, so seven seals followed by the seven trumpets and bowls full of wrath together reveal God’s complete and comprehensive judgment on the earth. The Lamb opens the first six seals of the scroll in 6:1–17 and the final seal in 8:1 after an interlude in chapter 7.\n\nInterpreters debate the nature and timing of these seals. For example, preterists relate the seals primarily to first-century events in the Roman world, such as wars and food shortages, while futurists understand the seals in relation to a coming tribulation at the end of history (see “Interpretation: How Should We Read Revelation?” for more on different interpretational approaches). Most likely, the seals relate to the period between Christ’s first and second comings. These verses include many allusions to the OT (e.g., Zech 6:1–8; Isa 13:9–13; Hos 10:8) and links to Jesus’s Olivet Discourse (Matt 24).\n\nSix Seals Opened (6:1–17)\n\n6:1–8 The four living creatures respond “come” when the Lamb opens the first four seals, summoning the riders of four colored horses (6:2, 4, 5, 8). Thus, while the four living creatures unceasingly praise the Almighty and the worthy Lamb (4:8–9; 5:8–10, 14), they also call forth God’s judgments on the earth and worship God for these mighty acts (see 15:7; 19:4).\n\nThe four horses in 6:1–8 allude to Zechariah’s prophecies of four colored horses and chariots led by red, black, white, and dapple-gray horses sent to patrol the earth (Zech 1:8–11; 6:1–8). Revelation’s first seal reveals the rider of a white horse with a bow and crown who comes “conquering and to conquer” (6:2). Interpreters are sharply divided about the meaning of this symbolism. Some identify this rider as Christ, since he comes on a white horse “to judge and make war” in 19:11. In this reading, the first seal offers a positive picture of Christ “conquering” through the gospel’s spread among the nations. More likely, this rider’s crown and white horse portray military might and anticipate the beast’s aggression towards Christ’s followers (11:7; 13:7), parodying the later picture of Christ’s victory (19:11).\n\nThe second seal reveals a rider of the red horse who takes peace from the earth (6:4). His “great sword” conveys violent bloodshed and anticipates the sober call for the saints’ endurance in 13:10. The third horseman, mounted on a black horse, holds a pair of scales signifying commerce (6:5). The significantly inflated prices for food staples (a quart of wheat and three quarts of barley) suggest scarcity or even famine conditions, perhaps due to war (6:6; cf. 2Kgs 6:24–33), though the protection of oil and wine sets limits on this destruction. The fourth rider sits atop a pale horse and is called “Death” (6:8). Death and Hades violently kill with the sword, famine, pestilence, and wild beasts. This scene alludes to the “four dreadful judgments” that God threatened to send against unfaithful Israel (Ezek 14:21 NIV; cf. 14:12–20; Lev 26:22–26; Deut 32:23–27; Jer 24:10).\n\n6:9–11 The fifth seal reveals the martyrs crying out for divine justice after they were “slain” like the Lamb (5:6, 9, 12), perhaps as a result of the violence and bloodshed of the first four seals (6:4, 8). John’s reference to their “souls” suggests that these martyrs await the resurrection (cf. 20:4), while their position “under the altar” expresses the sacrificial nature of their deaths and may recall the OT altar of incense or the altar of burnt offering (cf. Lev 4:7). They are slain because of “the word of God” and their faithful “witness,” echoing the reasons for John’s exile (Rev 1:9). The martyrs appeal to the Sovereign Lord to vindicate them and judge the inhabitants of the earth. This prayer is answered when Christ opens the sixth seal (6:12–17), and the multitude later worships God for judging his enemies and avenging the martyrs’ blood (16:5; 19:2). While awaiting final vindication, the martyrs are given assurance and called to patience. Each receives “a white robe,” attesting to their cleansing from sin and moral purity in God’s sight (cf. 3:4–5; 7:9, 14), even as they must “wait” (NIV), or “rest a little longer” (ESV), as God has ordained other Christians to suffer the same fate before the final judgment.\n\n6:12–17 When the Lamb opens the penultimate seal, John sees cosmic upheaval associated with “the day of the Lord” (cf. 13:9–13; 34:4, 8; Joel 2:10–11, 31; Matt 24:29) and utter terror for the earth’s rulers and other groups of people who hide from the wrath of God and the Lamb (cf. Isa 2:19–21; Hos 10:8; Luke 23:30). The “great earthquake” recalls prophecies of divine judgment (Isa 29:6; Ezek 38:19; cf. Matt 24:7) and anticipates other scenes of God’s awesome presence and consummate judgment in this book (see Rev 8:5; 11:13, 19; 16:18). The removal of mountains and islands (6:14) parallels the scenes of cosmic destruction in 16:20 (the seventh bowl) and 20:11 (the white throne judgment). The sixth seal concludes with the desperate cry of unrepentant humanity: “who can stand” in the great day of divine wrath (6:17)? While this rhetorical question carries the force “No one can stand in that day,” it also anticipates John’s vision of the saints “standing before the throne and before the Lamb” (7:9, emphasis added).\n\nThe Sealed Servants of God (7:1–17)\n\nChapter 7 is an interlude between the sixth and seventh seals: John sees two related visions of believers kept safe from God’s wrath and standing in God’s presence. Scholars debate the identity of the 144,000 from Israel and the multiethnic multitude, as well as the precise relationship between these groups. For example, some interpret the 144,000 as Jewish people saved during the final tribulation, who evangelize the multitude. More likely, the 144,000 and the multitude are two complementary pictures of the same reality: God’s redeemed people throughout history. The first vision emphasizes that God protects and preserves the full number of his chosen people, while the second stresses that God saves a great crowd from every nation, ethnicity, and language group through the Lamb’s shed blood.\n\n7:1–4 John sees four angels standing at the earth’s four corners holding back “four winds”; likely this refers to the four horsemen in 6:1–8 (cf. Zech 6:1–5). These angels are authorized to inflict damage, but another angel “with the seal of the living God” orders them to wait until God’s servants are “sealed.” John then hears their number: “144,00 sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel.” Sealing signifies that these people belong to God and receive his protection; 14:1 clarifies that the 144,000 bear the name of the Lamb and his Father on their foreheads. John’s vision alludes to Ezekiel 9:4–6, where the Lord’s agent marks the foreheads of the faithful, who are then spared when six executioners pass through the city to execute God’s wrath. So in Revelation’s fifth trumpet judgment, only those without God’s seal on their foreheads are harmed by the locusts (9:4). A mark on the forehead or hand designates those loyal to the beast (13:16; 14:9), while God’s people who refuse to worship the beast bear God’s name (14:1; 22:4) and are kept safe from divine wrath.\n\nInterpreters debate whether the 144,000 refers to a precise or representative number of Jews at the end of history, or whether the number symbolically represents all God’s people throughout time. I hold the latter view. Numbers in this book frequently carry symbolic weight, and the number twelve (and its multiples) is associated with God’s people:\n\ntwelve stars (12:1)\n\ntwelve tribes of Israel (7:4–8; 21:12)\n\ntwelve apostles (21:14)\n\ntwelve gates, angels, and foundations in the New Jerusalem (21:12–14, 21)\n\ntwelve kinds of fruit from the tree of life (22:2)\n\n144,000 is twelve squared and multiplied by a thousand, which expresses the perfect, complete number of God’s people.\n\n7:5–8 These verses unpack the number 144,000 by listing 12,000 from each tribe, which parallels in some ways the census of Israel’s fighting men in Numbers 1–2. However, this list doesn’t precisely match any OT records of the twelve tribes. Judah is named first as the tribe of the messianic king (Gen 49:9–10; Rev 5:5), ahead of Jacob’s firstborn, Reuben. Additionally, Manasseh (Joseph’s firstborn) replaces Dan, a tribe known for its idolatry (Judg 18:29–30; 1Kgs 12:29–30; Amos 8:14).\n\n7:9–12 In 5:5–6, John hears about the conquering Lion of Judah and surprisingly sees a slain Lamb; likewise, what John sees in 7:9–10 (a great multitude) clarifies the meaning of what John hears in 7:4–8 (144,000). As Jesus is both the Lion of Judah and the slain Lamb, so also the numbered tribes and the innumerable throng portray the same entity from different yet complementary angles. This vision reinterprets nationalistic hopes and shows the fruition of God’s promise to multiply Abraham’s descendants and bless all nations (Gen 13:16; 15:5; 22:17–18; 26:4; 32:12).\n\nJohn beholds the great multitude standing before the Almighty and the Lamb (7:9), a clear answer to the earlier question, “Who can stand?” (cf. 6:17). They do not hide in fear but stand in praise. These worshipers are from every grouping of humanity, representing all ethnicities, nationalities, languages, and tribes, as in 5:9. Their “white robes” recall the martyrs’ garments (6:11) and Christ’s promise to conquerors (3:4–5, 18). The heavenly elder explains that their robes have been “washed” and whitened by the Lamb’s blood (7:14; cf. 22:14). They hold “palm branches,” which are associated with the Feast of Booths that marked Israel’s exodus from Egypt (Lev 23:40–43; John 12:13) and anticipated a future redemption (Zech 14:16). The multitude declares, “Salvation belongs to our God . . . and to the Lamb” (cf. 12:10; 19:1), which recalls OT affirmations of God’s saving deeds (Exod 15:2; Ps 3:8; Jer 3:23; Jonah 2:9) while specifying the Lamb’s role in divine deliverance. The angels respond to this celebration of salvation with sevenfold praise to God (7:11–12), echoing the heavenly worship in 5:11–14.\n\n7:13–14 One of the elders poses a question to John and then answers it, explaining that the white-robed multitude are those redeemed by Christ who come “out of the great tribulation.” Some understand this “great tribulation” as a precise reference to a final period of hostility before Christ’s return, but the phrase more likely describes a time of intense trouble for God’s people throughout the church age that ends in deliverance and resurrection (Dan 12:1). John introduces himself to the seven churches as their “partner in the tribulation” (1:9), and Christ knows his people’s “tribulation” and calls for faithful endurance even unto death (2:9–10).\n\n7:15–17 “Therefore” (7:15) introduces the glorious consequences of cleansing from sin and enduring tribulation. These verses preview the saints’ priestly work and their experience of everlasting life with God in the new creation. The reference to serving in “his temple” is symbolic, not literal, as there is “no temple” in the New Jerusalem, which is filled with the radiant presence of God and the Lamb (21:22).\n\nThe redeemed shall not “hunger” or “thirst” but will instead experience eternal comfort and satisfaction (7:16–17), both fulfilling Isaiah 49:10 and anticipating Revelation 21:4, 6. The reason why the saints are protected and provided for comes in 7:17: “For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd.” In the OT, the Lord shepherds his people (Ps 23:1) and appoints David as their shepherd-ruler (2Sam 5:2; 7:7). Strikingly, Revelation presents the slain Lamb as the messianic shepherd who embodies God’s own care for his flock and leads them to “living water” (cf. John 4:14; 10:11). This vision concludes with an allusion to the restoration prophecy in Isaiah 25:8: “God will wipe away every tear from their eyes” (cf. Rev 21:4).\n\nThe Seventh Seal (8:1–5)\n\n8:1–2 After the interlude in chapter 7, the Lamb breaks the seventh seal (8:1), which brings a brief period of heavenly silence as the mysterious scroll is fully opened. The OT prophets summon people to “be silent” in God’s holy presence as judgment day approaches (Zeph 1:7; Hab 2:20; Zech 2:13). Further, in the exodus Moses responds to the people’s fears by calling them to see God’s salvation and “be silent” (Exod 14:13–14). This expectant silence in 8:1 prepares for another round of judgments as seven angels receive trumpets in 8:2.\n\n8:3–5 Before these angels prepare to sound their trumpets (8:6), a brief interlude vividly portrays how the sovereign Lord hears and answers his people’s petitions. John sees another angel with a golden censer (or “incense burner,” CSB) like a priest serving in the tabernacle (Lev 16:12); the angel offers incense and prayers on the golden altar before God’s throne (8:3). This is the same altar where the slain martyrs appeal for divine justice in 6:9–10, and the offering of the saints’ supplications recalls the throne room vision in 5:8, where golden bowls of incense signify believers’ prayers. The sweet aroma of mingled incense and prayers—including the martyrs’ cries—reaches God’s presence with angelic authorization (8:4). Verse 5 dramatically depicts the divine response to these prayers. The priestly angel at the heavenly altar fills his censer with fire and hurls it on the earth, accompanied by thunder, rumblings, lightning, and an earthquake. These are the sights and sounds of Mount Sinai (Exod 19:16; 20:18) that proceed from God’s heavenly throne (4:5). This storm theophany reveals God’s holy presence in judgment after the seventh seal is opened and anticipates the trumpet judgments, which prominently feature “fire” (8:7–8) and likewise conclude with the same thunderous display (11:19). The point is that these judgment cycles are not arbitrary or vindictive; they are the Almighty’s awesome answer to the effective prayers of his people and express God’s praiseworthy truthfulness and justice (16:7).\n\nJohn sees seven angels with trumpets in 8:2, and they prepare to sound these trumpets in 8:6, initiating the book’s next cycle of judgments (following the seals). The first six angels blow their trumpets one after another (8:7–9:21), then there is an extended interlude (10:1–11:14) before the final trumpet sounds and heaven erupts in praise (11:15–18). The exodus plagues against Egypt provide a biblical-theological model for the trumpet and bowl judgments in Revelation (see Table: Trumpets, Bowls, and Plagues).\n\nScholars disagree about the relationship and timing of the seals, trumpets, and bowls of wrath. Do these judgments occur in the first century AD (preterists), at the end of history (many futurists), or throughout history until Christ’s return (idealists)? Should we understand these cycles to be chronologically sequential (seals, then trumpets, then bowls), or do they describe the same realities using parallelism or recapitulation?\n\nThe repetition of thunder, lightning, rumblings, and an earthquake following the seventh seal (8:5), the seventh trumpet (11:19), and the seventh bowl (16:18) strongly suggests a pattern of recapitulation. Additionally, there are striking similarities between the trumpets and bowls and their shared exodus background (see Table: Trumpets, Bowls, and Plagues), though the bowls seem to go further than the trumpets in presenting consummate divine judgment. For example, a third of the sea turns to blood and a third of sea creatures perish when the second trumpet sounds (8:8–9), but the entire sea turns to blood and every creature dies when the angel pours out the second bowl (16:3). This intensification from the trumpets to the bowls may suggest that the trumpets (like the seals) refer to judgments throughout history, while the bowls depict climactic judgments near the end of history. However, the sixth seal (6:12–17) with its apocalyptic day-of-the-Lord imagery most likely presents a vision of the final judgment rather than a preliminary judgment preparing for the trumpets and bowls (note the many parallels with the seventh bowl in 16:17–21). There is a similar finality to the seventh trumpet, as the heavenly elders declare, “The nations raged, but your wrath came, and the time for the dead to be judged, and for rewarding your servants . . . and for destroying the destroyers of the earth” (11:18).\n\nIn my view, progressive parallelism or recapitulation best accounts for the many similarities between the seals, trumpets, and bowls, while allowing for an intensified, fuller expression of God’s judgment in the final judgment cycle.\n\nSix Trumpets Sound (8:6–9:21)\n\n8:6–7 When the first trumpet sounds, hail and fire, mixed with blood, are thrown upon the earth, burning up a third of the earth (or land) and its trees and all grass. This clearly alludes to the seventh plague, where the Lord sent thunder, hail, and fire to the earth in the land of Egypt (Exod 9:23; cf. Ps 105:32; “earth” and “land” render the same Greek word gē). The first trumpet fulfills God’s promise in Ezekiel 38:22–23 that he will again rain down hailstones, fire, and sulfur to reveal his greatness and holiness to many nations.\n\n8:8–9 At the second trumpet judgment, a great fiery mountain is thrown into the sea, turning a third of its water to blood, killing a third of the sea creatures, and destroying a third of the ships. This trumpet is modeled on the first plague, where the Nile’s water turns to blood and its fish die (Exod 7:20–21). The partial judgment on the sea prepares for the consummate judgment of the second bowl, when the whole sea becomes like the blood of a corpse and every living thing dies (16:3). The “great mountain, burning with fire” recalls the prophecy that Babylon will be “a burned-out mountain” (Jer 51:25). Later in Revelation, Babylon is destroyed by fire and hurled into the sea (18:8, 21; cf. Jer 51:63–64). Similarly, the destruction of ships in 8:9 foreshadows the somber scene in 18:17–19, where sailors and sea captains mourn the demise of Babylon’s bustling sea trade.\n\n8:10–11 The third trumpet blast reveals a great burning star (“Wormwood”) falling from heaven on a third of the rivers and water springs, making the water “wormwood”—bitter and deadly. “Wormwood” in the OT is a metaphor for the bitterness of suffering (Lam 3:15, 19), sin (Deut 29:19; Prov 5:4), and judgment (Jer 9:15; 23:15). The third trumpet, like the second, alludes to God’s judgment on Egypt’s rivers, canals, and ponds, which reeked of death and became non-potable (Exod 7:19–21; cf. Ps 78:44). Such bitter, deadly water contrasts with the springs of living water that satisfy God’s people forever (7:17).\n\n8:12 The first three trumpets announce judgment upon the earth and the waters, and the fourth blast disrupts the heavenly lights: God strikes the sun, moon, and stars, darkening a third of their light during the day and the night. This act recalls the penultimate plague of the exodus when utter darkness enveloped the Egyptians for three days, while Israel had light (Exod 10:21–23). Within Revelation, the fourth trumpet recalls the sixth seal: the sun becomes as sackcloth, the moon reddens, and the stars fall (6:12–13). It also anticipates the fifth bowl: the beast’s kingdom is plunged into darkness (16:10). The disturbance of the heavenly lights is a typical feature of prophecies about the day of the Lord, which brings disasters on earth and topples mighty kingdoms (see Isa 13:10; 24:23; Ezek 32:7–8; Joel 2:10, 31; 3:15; Matt 24:29). The fourth trumpet draws especially on Isaiah’s “oracle concerning Babylon,” which links the darkening of the heavenly lights with the humbling of the haughty in the day of the Lord (Isa 13:1, 9–11).\n\nThe trumpets bring judgment on parts of creation depicted in Genesis 1–2:\n\nTrumpet 1: the earth, trees, and grass (cf. Gen 1:11–12, 30)\n\nTrumpet 2: the sea and sea creatures (cf. Gen 1:10, 20–21)\n\nTrumpet 3: the rivers and springs (cf. Gen 2:6, 10)\n\nTrumpet 4: the sun, moon, and stars (cf. Gen 1:14–16)\n\nTrumpet 6: mankind (cf. Gen 1:26–27)\n\nThis de-creation is partial, not total (as in the great flood). God’s restrained judgment here reflects his promise in Genesis 8:21 while looking ahead to the final judgment.\n\n8:13 Between the fourth and fifth trumpets, John hears an eagle cry, “Woe, woe, woe.” This ominous announcement prepares for the more intensified judgment that awaits “those who dwell on the earth” (cf. 9:12; 11:14). Revelation distinctively depicts unbelievers as “earth-dwellers” who adopt the values and perspective of earth, readily worship the beast, and disregard the true God and his people (cf. 3:10; 6:10; 11:10; 13:8, 14; 17:8).\n\n9:1 The blast of the fifth trumpet initiates a lengthy description of judgment that opens with a star falling from heaven, as in 8:10. Stars signify angels in Revelation (see 1:20), so readers have identified the star in 9:1 as a fallen angel—perhaps Satan (cf. Luke 10:18)—or an angel executing God’s will. While “fallen” could suggest that this star is an evil agent, it seems unlikely that God would entrust control over the abyss to Satan or his minions since one of God’s angels comes down from heaven holding “the key to the bottomless pit” and seizes the dragon in 20:1. Thus, the star in 9:1 probably signifies an angel whom God entrusts with authority to allow agents from the abyss to bring destruction on the earth.\n\n9:2–6 The exodus typology seen in the first four trumpets continues in these verses. Smoke darkens the sun and air, recalling the plague of darkness in Egypt (Exod 10:21–23; cf. Rev 8:12). Further, the diabolical locusts parallel the eighth plague in which locusts consume Egypt’s plants and fruit and leave nothing green remaining (Exod 10:12–15; cf. Ps 78:46). In the OT the Lord threatens to send locusts as a judgment on unfaithful Israel to devour her vegetation (Deut 28:38; Joel 1:4; Amos 4:9), but the locusts in 9:4 come not to destroy crops but to torment unbelievers without God’s “seal” that protects his people (see 7:2–3). The Lord establishes limits on this judgment, permitting the locusts to afflict, but not kill, for a period of five months (9:5, 10).\n\n9:7–11 The figurative description of these destructive agents signals that they are no ordinary locusts. They are swift like war horses (cf. Joel 2:4), crowned like princes (cf. Nah 3:17), intelligent like humans (cf. Dan 7:8), vicious like lions (cf. Joel 1:6), and clad for battle with breastplates and chariots (cf. Joel 2:5). Moreover, three times these locusts are likened to scorpions (Rev 9:3, 5, 10), which the ancient historian Pliny describes as “a dangerous scourge” whose sting is more painful and lethal than a serpent’s venom. Leading these locusts is the angel of the abyss, “Apollyon,” meaning “Destroyer” (NIV). Interpreters identify this king from the pit as Satan, the antichrist, the angel of death, or personified Destruction (the meaning of the Hebrew “Abaddon”). The Greek name “Apollyon” may also suggest a link to Apollo, the god of pestilence sometimes represented by a locust.\n\n9:12 This parenthetical comment recalls the three-fold “woe” announced in 8:13: the fifth trumpet is the first of these woes, and 11:14 suggests that the final two trumpets represent the second and third woes.\n\n9:13–15 When the sixth angel sounds his trumpet, John hears a voice from the golden altar releasing four angels prepared to kill a third of humanity. This is the same altar where the martyrs cry out and the angel offers incense to God (6:9; 8:3), symbolically linking the sixth trumpet with the saints’ prayers for vindication. John earlier sees four angels holding back the four winds (7:1), but the four angels in 9:14 do not restrain judgment but are—like the winds and horsemen in the seal cycle—evil agents released for destruction. They come from the Euphrates, alluding to prophecies of enemies attacking from the north (see Jer 46:2, 10) and anticipating the sixth bowl of wrath poured out on the great river to prepare the way for kings to come together for battle (16:12–16). While the locusts of the fifth trumpet torture people for a limited duration, the angels in the sixth trumpet are released to kill at the specific time appointed by God.\n\n9:16–19 John then hears and sees a terrifying, vast army with “fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow” breastplates (CSB) mounted on fire-breathing horses with lions’ heads and serpentine tails, evidently led by the four angels. This figurative description suggests a demonic rather than a human force. Their number—two myriads of myriads, equivalent to two hundred million—symbolizes an incalculable multitude (cf. Dan 7:10), a thousand times the size of Rome’s formidable army in the late first century.\n\nThe “three plagues”—deadly fire, smoke, and sulfur from the horses’ mouths—recall God’s paradigmatic destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen 19:24, 28; cf. Luke 17:29) and portend God’s ultimate judgment of his foes (Rev 14:10–11; 18:9; 20:10; 21:8; cf. Ezek 38:22).\n\n9:20–21 The devastating judgment of the sixth trumpet does not move survivors to repent of their idolatry or immorality, nor do the bowls of wrath (see 16:9, 11). As Pharaoh hardened his heart in response to the ten plagues (Exod 4:21; 14:4), so unbelieving humanity continues to oppose God and his ways. These verses offer the longest of three vice lists in the book (see also Rev 21:8; 22:15), each of which includes idolatry, murder, magic arts or sorcery, and sexual immorality. The vice list here uniquely includes “thefts” and expansively describes the objects of their worship: “demons and idols . . . which cannot see or hear or walk.” This reflects the OT teaching about idols’ material and spiritual essence (Deut 4:28; 32:16–17; Ps 115:4–7). In Revelation, idolatrous earth-dwellers increasingly resemble the objects of their worship and refuse to hear God’s word or walk in his ways.\n\nThe Angel and the Scroll (10:1–11)\n\nBetween the final two trumpets, there is an extended interlude or parenthetical vision in 10:1–11:13 like the vision of the multiethnic multitude in chapter 7 that interrupts the sixth and seventh seals. In the context of calamitous judgment scenes, these interludes offer believers reassurance and perspective concerning their true situation, identity, and hope. Revelation 10 records a vision of a strong angel with a scroll, which John eats to signify his calling to prophesy. Then 11:1–13 depicts Jesus’s “two witnesses” who are killed by earth-dwellers, then vindicated by God.\n\n10:1 John sees a stunning angelic figure descending from heaven. He is clothed in a cloud, attended by a rainbow, with a face like the sun, and fiery pillars for legs. This exalted language parallels descriptions of God, the Son of Man, and the heavenly throne room in Revelation (1:7, 15–16; 4:3, 5; 14:14) and elsewhere in Scripture (e.g., Exod 13:21; 19:16–18; Ps 78:14; Ezek 1:28). Some commentators conclude that this glorious being is Christ himself, though that is unlikely for several reasons. First, Revelation never elsewhere calls Jesus an angel and makes clear that only God and the Lamb are worthy of worship, not angels (19:10; 22:9). Second, “Another mighty angel” with “a loud voice” (10:1, 3) recalls the earlier vision of “the mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice” in 5:2 (see also 18:21). Finally, the angel swears an oath by God who lives forever and created all things (10:6), which suggests that he himself is a created being and not divine. Thus, this angel is not Christ but his resplendent representative.\n\n10:2 This great angel puts one foot on sea, another on land, signifying that his message pertains to the whole world created by God (10:5–6)—the same jurisdiction where the devil briefly exercises authority (12:12–13). The angel holds “a little scroll,” which John takes and eats in 10:8–10. Some scholars argue that this is a different scroll than the one John sees in chapter 5, but there are good reasons to identify this “open” scroll in the angel’s hand as the same scroll that the Lamb has just unsealed. Revelation 5 and 10 draw on imagery from Ezekiel 2–3 to describe this mysterious double-sided scroll that is bitter and sweet. Now that Christ has unsealed God’s inscrutable scroll, the prophet must eat the scroll, internalizing its message, and declare it to many nations (10:8–11).\n\n10:3–4 The angel’s lion-like voice prompts seven thunders to speak. As John prepares his prophetic pen, a heavenly voice commands him to “seal up” the thunders’ message and not write it down, concealing it from readers. The open scroll—not the seven thunders—contains the revelation that John must herald.\n\n10:5–7 The mighty angel swears that God’s mystery will be fulfilled without delay. His oath with his right hand raised to heaven alludes to Daniel 12:7. In both texts, the angel invokes God’s authority as one who lives forever and swears that all of God’s plans will be finished. The repetition of heaven, earth, and sea (10:5–6) underscores the Creator’s complete sovereignty over all things. “No more delay” stresses that God will imminently fulfill his previously hidden purposes for judgment and salvation (“the mystery of God”) in accordance with the prophetic word (cf. Amos 3:7). 10:7 reflects Revelation’s position as the culmination of biblical prophecy and reminds readers that God will surely and necessarily keep his promises and carry out his revealed will.\n\n10:8–10 John dramatizes his prophetic calling by eating the open scroll. The heavenly voice that addressed John earlier (10:4) commands him to take the scroll (10:8). The angel tells the prophet, “Take and eat it,” explaining that the scroll will be bitter in John’s stomach but sweet in his mouth (10:9). This scene is modeled after Ezekiel 2:8–3:3, where the prophet sees a double-sided scroll stretched out with “words of lamentation and mourning and woe” and then receives divine instruction to “eat this scroll” and speak God’s word to Israel. So Ezekiel eats this mysterious scroll, which tastes sweet like honey in his mouth. In both Revelation and Ezekiel, eating a heavenly scroll is a symbolic picture of the prophet fully internalizing God’s revealed message in order to speak it to others. When John ingests this scroll, it tastes sweet and sour (10:10)—sweet as God’s true words that bring life and joy (Jer 15:16; Pss 19:10; 119:103), yet also bitter, as John (like Ezekiel) must prophesy about coming divine judgment and woe. The bitterness in John’s belly recalls the third trumpet, in which the earth’s waters become bitter and deadly (8:11).\n\n10:11 The exhortation “You must again prophesy” reiterates John’s calling to testify about all he sees and hears (cf. 1:2, 19) and explains why John consumes the heavenly scroll. Ezekiel is not sent to far-off peoples who would heed his warnings (Ezek 3:6), while John’s prophecy concerns many peoples, nations, languages, and rulers. Scholars debate whether verse 11 has a positive or negative sense: does John prophesy “about” many nations or “against” them? The debated phrase prophēteusai epi (“prophesy about/against”) in the Greek OT often introduces correction and judgment against Israel and the nations (e.g., Ezek 4:7; 21:2; 25:2; 29:2), yet it also presents words of consolation and coming restoration for God’s people (e.g., Ezek 36:6; 37:9). The book of Revelation presents contrasting visions of the nations devoted to the beast (13:12; 18:3) and delivered by the Lamb (5:9; 7:9–10), which suggests that John’s prophetic message about the nations includes both judgment and redemption. The summons to prophesy also prepares for the next scene in which Christ’s witnesses “will prophesy for 1,260 days” (11:3).\n\nThe Two Witnesses (11:1–13)\n\n11:1–2 John receives a measuring rod with which to measure the temple, altar, and worshipers. However, the temple’s outer court and the holy city are not measured because they will be trampled by the nations. Measuring the temple is another parabolic action with OT background, like sealing God’s servants (7:2–8) and consuming the heavenly scroll (10:8–10). In Zechariah 2:1–2, a man prepares to measure Jerusalem for rebuilding, and in Ezekiel 40:3, the prophet sees a man with a cord and measuring reed to survey the area inside and outside the temple (Ezek 40–47). Similar to sealing, measuring signifies God’s ownership and safekeeping. The measuring of God’s temple in 11:1 anticipates 21:15–17, where an angel measures the glorious New Jerusalem.\n\nSome preterists interpret 11:1–2 (and passages like Luke 21:20–24) with reference to Rome’s destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, while some futurists (especially dispensationalists) understand these verses as an end-time prophecy about a rebuilt temple in Jerusalem and Jewish worshipers during a future great tribulation. However, “temple” (naos) elsewhere in Revelation consistently designates God’s glorious presence in heaven (11:19; 14:17) that will one day fill the new creation (21:22; cf. 7:15). Likewise, 21:2 identifies “the holy city” as New Jerusalem coming out of heaven like a bride on her wedding day (cf. 21:10), while 22:19 references the saints’ future share in the holy city. Thus, it is unlikely that 11:1–2 refers to a past or future literal temple structure in the earthly Jerusalem; rather, the symbolic act of measuring the temple, altar, and worshipers signifies God’s protection and preservation of his people, who are “the temple of the living God” (2Cor 6:16; cf. 1Cor 3:16; 6:19; Eph 2:21).\n\nSome readers discern a distinction between two groups of people in 11:1–2: the measured (believing Jews or the faithful church) and the unmeasured (unbelieving Jews or the unfaithful church). More likely, the symbolism here suggests that God allows his people to suffer harm at the hands of the unbelieving nations, yet God ultimately keeps safe those who belong to him. 11:3–13 vividly illustrates this point as Jesus’s two witnesses (likely signifying the church) prophesy, suffer, and are finally vindicated.\n\nForty-two months (11:2; cf. 13:5) is equivalent to 1,260 days (11:3; 12:6) and “a time, and times, and half a time” (12:14). This interval is drawn from Daniel 7:25 and 12:7 and also parallels Elijah’s ministry (1Kgs 17:1; Luke 4:25; Jas 5:17). Some interpreters take this to be a literal period of three and one-half years preceding the temple’s historical destruction or Christ’s future return. However, the Danielic background and figurative use of numbers within Revelation suggest that forty-two months is a symbolic period of suffering and witness that extends from Christ’s ascension to his return. During this present evil age, the nations trample the holy city, the two witnesses prophesy, the dragon and beast fight against God’s people, and the saints experience God’s help (11:2–3; 12:6, 14; 13:5–7).\n\n11:3 Two witnesses are introduced, who have authority to prophesy for 1,260 days. The emphasis on their prophetic identity (11:10) and the mention of peoples, languages, and nations (11:9) signal a close link with John’s commissioning to prophesy (10:11). Their sackcloth signifies mourning over sin and a message of repentance. The duration of their prophetic ministry is 1,260 days, or three and one-half years—the same time period that the holy city is trampled and the saints suffer (11:2; 12:6, 14; 13:5; cf. Dan 7:25; 12:7).\n\nAncient and contemporary readers have variously identified these two witnesses with specific OT figures such as Enoch and Elijah, who were taken directly to heaven (Gen 5:24; 2Kgs 2:11; Mal 4:5–6), or Elijah and Moses, since these witnesses shut the sky and turn water into blood (11:6; cf. 1Kgs 17:1; Exod 7:17). Most likely, the two witnesses signify the church, which testifies to Christ and experiences tribulation and ultimate triumph.\n\n11:4 These witnesses are described as two olive trees and two lampstands, which alludes to the vision of a golden lampstand with an olive tree on either side of it in Zechariah 4:2–3. In Zechariah’s prophecy, this lampstand represents the temple being rebuilt (Zech 4:9), while the olive trees are explained as “the two anointed ones” (Zech 4:14), a reference either to Joshua the high priest (Zech 3:1) and Zerubbabel the governor (Zech 4:6–10), or to Zechariah and Haggai, whose prophetic ministry relates closely to the construction of the temple after exile (Zech 8:9; cf. Ezra 5:1–2; 6:14–15).\n\nWhile Zechariah describes one lampstand flanked by olive trees, the Apocalypse presents two lampstands that are also olive trees. In 1:20, Christ identifies the seven golden lampstands in John’s vision as churches, and this earlier explanation of lampstands as churches informs the symbolism in 11:4 as well. By calling the two witnesses olive trees and lampstands “that stand before the Lord of the earth,” Revelation further stresses the divine authority of their prophetic activity and God’s presence with them.\n\nIf these witnesses-olive trees-lampstands describe churches, rather than individuals, their number could refer to the two faithful churches in chapters 2–3 (Smyrna and Philadelphia) or the united Jewish and Gentile church. More likely, it reflects the biblical requirement for two or more witnesses in a legal case (Num 35:30; Deut 17:6; 19:15). Thus, the symbolism in 11:4 conveys that Christ’s church bears the light of God’s presence and bears witness against the earth-dwellers who do not repent.\n\n11:5–6 Christ’s witnesses are prophetic twins. Consuming fire pours from their mouth (11:5), which recalls the OT description of God’s word in the prophet’s mouth (Jer 5:14). The witnesses prevent rain from falling, turn water to blood, and send plagues on the earth (11:6), recalling the mighty works of Elijah (1Kgs 17:1) and Moses (Exod 7:17; cf. 1Sam 4:8).\n\n11:7 The beast from the abyss fights against and slays Christ’s two witnesses. This brief reference to the beast previews chapter 13, where the terrifying beast rises from the sea (13:1) and makes war against the saints (13:7), following the prophecy in Daniel 7:21.\n\n11:8–10 The fallen witnesses are mocked and dishonored as onlookers rejoice and refuse them burial in the great city (cf. Ps 79:1–4). This continues for three and a half days—a short period that contrasts with their longer ministry for three and a half years (11:3) and may echo Christ’s three days in the tomb (Matt 12:40) or the cryptic half week in Daniel 9:27.\n\nThis great city is also called Sodom, Egypt, and the place where their Lord was crucified. The key term pneumatikōs—translated “symbolically” (ESV), “figuratively” (NIV), and “spiritually” (NKJV)—reflects the prophet’s Spirit-aided insight into this city’s essence. Sodom is the prototypical wicked city that warrants God’s fiery judgment (Gen 18:20–21; 19:24; cf. Isa 13:19; Jer 50:39–40), while Egypt is the place of oppressive slavery from which God rescues Israel (Exod 2:23; 20:2). The city’s final spiritual name recalls Jerusalem, which killed the prophets and crucified the Lord (Luke 13:33–34; 18:31–33), and Revelation later identifies this great city as Babylon the Great (14:8; 16:19; 18:21). Interpreters commonly argue that the great city refers to Rome or Jerusalem (past or future), and the book’s first readers likely connected the vast, prosperous, and brutal Roman empire with Babylon (cf. 1Pet 5:13). However, the significant biblical-theological associations of Babylon (see 14:8) and the combination of symbolic names in 11:8 suggest that Rome is not a one-for-one equivalent with Babylon. Revelation does not provide a precise geographic location for this great city but a spiritual assessment of idolatrous, immoral human society, what Augustine calls “the earthly city” that opposes the City of God.\n\n11:11–12 The disgraced prophets are dramatically vindicated. God’s life-giving breath (or Spirit, pneuma) enters them, and they stand on their feet, language drawn from the famous prophecy of Israel’s revival after exile in Ezekiel 37:5, 10. If the two witnesses represent the church, as argued above (see comments on 11:3), then this scene depicts the resurrection of God’s people at the end of history (cf. 1Cor 15:20–23). Then the witnesses ascend in a cloud after a heavenly voice calls, “Come up here!” This event parallels Christ’s ascension (Acts 1:9) and the heavenly summons to the prophet in 4:1–2. Their enemies watch with fear as God vindicates his witnessing church—their response of dread reverses their earlier rejoicing.\n\n11:13 A tremor destroys a tenth of the great city and 7,000 people, while the terrified survivors glorify God. “A great earthquake” parallels descriptions of final judgment in 6:12 (the sixth seal) and 16:18 (the seventh bowl) and recalls Ezekiel 38:19. The limited destruction in 11:13 anticipates the total devastation in 16:19, where Babylon is split in three parts. Some interpreters understand the people’s response of giving glory to God as an expression of reverent fear and repentance (14:7; 15:4); more likely, however, these shaken survivors recognize God’s power yet persist in unbelief (cf. 6:15–17; 16:21).\n\nThe Seventh Trumpet (11:14–19)\n\n11:14 Following the extended interlude in 10:1–11:13, John returns to the earlier announcement of three woes (cf. 8:13). The first woe refers to the fifth trumpet (9:12), while “the second woe has passed” recalls the sixth trumpet (9:13–21), and the third woe anticipates the final trumpet blast in 11:15.\n\n11:15 The sounding of the seventh trumpet prompts joyful heavenly worship, not a further scene of destructive judgment. The voices in heaven declare that the Lord and his Messiah now rule over the world’s kingdom and will reign forever (cf. Luke 1:33). The kingdom of God is inseparably tied to the messianic king, Jesus (cf. Ps 2:2, 6), who rules in heaven now (1:5; 3:21) and will return to consummate his kingdom (19:16). Elsewhere, Revelation calls the Almighty the one “who is and who was and who is to come” (1:4), but the abbreviated title “who is and who was” in 11:17 and 16:5 expresses that God’s future “coming” to save and to judge is no longer an expectation for the future but a present reality.\n\n11:16–18 The twenty-four elders (introduced in 4:4) fall down and worship the Almighty because his rule is established, which means that the raging nations face his wrath, while his servants receive his reward. Their praise parallels Psalm 2: the nations rage against the Lord and his Anointed, but God in heaven addresses them “in his anger” and establishes his Son’s reign (Ps 2:6–9). The kings of earth must fear the Lord or else face his fury (Ps 2:10–12). Moreover, the song of the final trumpet recalls the Song of Moses, which concludes, “The Lord will reign forever and ever” (Exod 15:18). 11:18 looks ahead to the final judgment, when God will judge all the dead according to their deeds (Rev 20:12–13). Specifically, the Almighty will destroy those who destroy the earth (cf. Jer 51:25), reflecting the principle that the punishment fits the crime and expressing the hope of suffering believers that God will avenge their blood (6:10; 16:5–6; 19:2).\n\nGod judges his foes and rewards his faithful servants (or “slaves,” rendering the Greek word doulos). Interpreters debate whether the list of prophets, saints, and God-fearers in 11:18 refers to one, two, or three different groups of divine servants (similar expressions occur in 16:6; 18:24; 22:9). While Revelation presents the church as witnesses and prophets in this age (11:3, 7, 10; cf. Num 11:29; Joel 2:28), the book also calls OT prophets God’s “servants” (10:7) and emphasizes John’s unique authorization to write authoritative prophecy like his prophetic predecessors (1:1–3, 11, 19; 10:8–11). As 18:20 lists saints, apostles, and prophets as distinct groups, so 11:18 likely presents two groups of divine servants: prophets (like John) and the saints who fear God’s name. Regardless, all believers eagerly anticipate a reward (misthos) at Jesus’s return (22:12).\n\n11:19 The trumpet cycle concludes with a storm theophany that reveals the awesome presence of the Almighty. The flashes of lightning, rumblings, thunder, and earthquake parallel the conclusion to the seven seals (8:5) and seven bowls of wrath (16:18). “Great hail” recalls the seventh plague against Egypt (Exod 9:18–25) and parallels the final bowl judgment (16:21) and the first trumpet (8:7); thus, hail opens and concludes the trumpet cycle. Further, the mention of the ark of the covenant in God’s heavenly temple (11:19) once again reminds readers of Sinai (Exod 25:10) and symbolizes God’s presence with his people.\n\nRevelation 20 has puzzled readers for nearly two millennia, and present-day interpreters continue to express their eschatological views relative to the millennium (premillennial, postmillennial, amillennial). Interpretive disagreements relate especially to these six areas:\n\nthe order of events described in Revelation 19:11–20:10;\n\nthe nature of Satan’s binding;\n\nwhether the thousand years is a literal or symbolic period;\n\nthe identity of those reigning with Christ;\n\nthe location of the thrones in 20:4;\n\nwhether 19:17–21 and 20:7–10 depict the same battle or different battles.\n\nPremillennialists argue that Christ will return before (pre-) the thousand years to war against the beast and its allies (19:11–21). The order in which John recounts his visions in Revelation 19–20 matches the order in which these events will transpire. After Christ’s return, Satan will be “bound” and incapacitated for a thousand years (20:2), variously understood as a precise or symbolic time period. During the millennium some believers (martyrs and perhaps others) will receive resurrection bodies and rule with Christ on earth over the descendants of those surviving the battle of Armageddon (20:4; cf. 16:16). After the millennium, Satan is released to deceive the nations and assemble an army for battle. He will then be finally defeated and judged (20:7–10).\n\nMost historicist and preterist interpreters affirm postmillennialism and hold that Christ will return after (post-) a literal or symbolic millennium. Like amillennialists, some postmillennialists understand a symbolic thousand-year period to be coextensive with the church age, while others hold that the church’s successful mission among the nations will usher in a millennial golden age on earth. Then Satan will be temporarily released for a final attack on the church (20:7–9), after which Jesus will return to defeat his foes (20:10; cf. 19:11–21).\n\nAmillennialists interpret the thousand years as a symbolic time period between Christ’s ascension and return, during which deceased saints reign in heaven. Amillennialism is sometimes called “inaugurated” or “realized millennialism” to clarify the nature and timing of the thousand years. According to this view, Satan was bound through Jesus’s death and resurrection and is prevented from deceiving the nations and thwarting the spread of the gospel (20:2–3; cf. Matt 12:28–29; John 12:31–32). At the end of the church age, Satan will be released for a final onslaught against the church (20:7–8). Then Christ will return to judge his enemies, save his people, and usher in the new creation.\n\nChapter 20 divides into four subunits, three of which begin with the phrase “and I saw” (20:1, 4, 11): (1) Satan’s binding (20:1–3); (2) believers’ reign (20:4–6); (3) Satan’s release and defeat (20:7–10); (4) the last judgment (20:11–15).\n\n20:1–3 This unit focuses on the thousand-year binding of Satan. 20:1 begins with the Greek word kai, translated “and” (NIV) or “then” (ESV). “And I saw” frequently introduces a new vision in the book (see 19:11, 17, 19; 20:4, 12). Here John beholds an angel holding a great chain and a key to the abyss, or bottomless pit (cf. 9:1). This key represents authority over the realm of the dead, which belongs to the risen Lord Jesus (1:18; 3:7) and is delegated to his angelic representative. This angel seizes and binds the dragon, who is once again named as the ancient serpent, recalling Genesis 3:1 (20:2; cf. 12:9). Readers interpret the timing and nature of Satan’s thousand-year binding in different ways. For premillennialists, Satan’s binding follows Christ’s return and represents a complete cessation of activity. Amillennialists link this binding with Christ’s first coming (Matt 12:28–29) and argue that Satan remains active during the church age but is prevented from deceiving the nations as the gospel advances.\n\n20:4–6 The next unit depicts the believers’ thousand-year reign with Christ. John sees thrones (20:4), which elsewhere designate places of heavenly authority under God’s supreme rule (4:4; 11:16). Amillennialists hold that 20:4–6 offers heavenly perspective on the events in 20:1–3. Alternatively, premillennialists argue that the angel’s descent from heaven (20:1) and the reference to nations (20:3) indicate that these thrones are located on earth. The scene likely alludes to Daniel 7:9, 22, where Daniel sees thrones set up around God Almighty, who judges in favor of his people and gives them the kingdom. Interpreters debate whether those seated on these thrones are the heavenly elders, vindicated martyrs, or all believers. Most likely, the occupants of the thrones are specified later in 20:4 as those who are beheaded and had refused to worship the beast. This description recalls the martyrs in 6:9, who conquer like Christ and represent faithful believers (cf. 12:11). The Greek phrase krima edothē autois (“judgment was given to them,” NASB) likely means that God pronounces judgements in their favor, as in Daniel 7:22.\n\nDeceased believers come to life and reign with Christ for a thousand years, explained as “the first resurrection” (20:5). For premillennialists, this refers to a physical, earthly resurrection of some believers that anticipates the general resurrection. Some amillennialists equate the first resurrection with conversion (John 5:24). More likely, the first resurrection is the intermediate state of believers who die and reign in heaven with Christ prior to the final resurrection (cf. 2Cor 5:1–8; Phil 1:23).\n\nThe book’s fifth beatitude in 20:6 ascribes divine favor to the one who shares in the first resurrection (cf. “came to life” in 20:4) and thus escapes the second death. First resurrection implies a second and signals that this millennial state when deceased believers live and reign with Christ is glorious yet provisional, awaiting the consummate state in the new heavens and new earth. The opposite of ultimate resurrection life is the second death, which is the lake of fire (cf. 20:14; 21:8). Believers experience the first death but not the second; this truth motivates faithful endurance of suffering and hope in a glorious future with Christ (see 2:10–11). Believers’ priestly reign in the millennium recalls earlier references to the church’s vocation (1:6; 5:10; cf. Exod 19:6) and anticipates their role in the new creation (22:3–5).\n\n20:7–10 These verses focus on Satan’s final rebellion and defeat. “When the thousand years are ended” indicates that these events will follow those described in 20:1–6. The Greek phrase hotan telesthē (“And when they have finished their testimony”) in 20:7 also occurs in 11:7, which may support identifying the millennium with the time of the church’s suffering and witness. After his release, Satan goes forth to deceive the nations (20:8), the very thing he cannot do during the thousand years (20:3). The nations that follow Satan are variously understood as (1) people who did not fight in the battle in 19:19–21, (2) ghosts and demons from the underworld, or (3) unrepentant nations raised after their slaughter in 19:21. More likely, these nations are unbelieving earth-dwellers who live during the church age and align with Satan, and “the four corners of the earth” (20:8; cf. 7:1) signifies the whole earth (cf. Isa 11:12), not the portal to the underworld.\n\n“Gog and Magog” alludes to Ezekiel 38–39, a prophecy of northern enemies conspiring with other nations against restored Israel. In Ezekiel and Revelation, innumerable armies gather and march against God’s people before being destroyed by fire. Interpreters debate the relationship of the battle scenes in 19:17–21 and 20:8–9 (cf. 16:13–16; Zech 17:14). Both passages draw on Ezekiel’s prophecy against Gog (see Table: Gog and Magog in Ezekiel and Revelation), which suggests that they depict the same battle with distinct emphases. While chapter 19 stresses Christ’s total victory as the messianic King, chapter 20 reveals Satan’s deceptive ambitions and decisive judgment.\n\nSatan’s allied forces surround “the beloved city,” namely, Jerusalem (20:9; cf. Ps 78:68). While it is possible to read this as a reference to the restored city of Jerusalem, more likely the beloved city is equivalent to the camp of the saints and signifies the oppressed, pilgrim community of believers who are heirs of the new Jerusalem (Rev 3:12). But fire from heaven consumes the rebellious armies (Ezek 38:22; 39:6)—decisive divine judgment as in 2 Kings 1:10–14. The devil is hurled into the lake of fire and tormented forever, as are the beast and false prophet (20:10; cf. 19:20). As the hymn declares, “His rage we can endure, / For lo! his doom is sure.”\n\n20:11–15 The chapter’s final section presents the last judgment of the dead. The divine throne takes center stage, as in chapter 4. The earth and heavens flee from the Almighty’s presence (20:11), which recalls earlier scenes of cosmic dissolution (6:14; 16:20) and prepares for a new heaven and earth (21:1). All the dead, whether great or small, appear before the divine throne to be judged (20:12; cf. 11:18; 2Cor 5:10). God justly rewards or punishes everyone according to their works (cf. Rev 22:12; Ps 62:12; Matt 16:27; Rom 2:6–11). 20:12 refers to the opening of “books” and “another book . . . the book of life,” alluding to Daniel 7:10 and 12:1–2. While the books represent the just judgment of the wicked according to the record of their deeds, the book of life signifies God’s choice of believers for salvation (3:5; 13:8; 17:8; 20:15; 21:27; Phil 4:3). 20:13–14 vividly depicts the sea, Death, and Hades giving up their dead for judgment before the Almighty throws these realms of evil and disorder into the lake of fire, the second death. Satan, the beast and false prophet, and the wicked—those whose names are not in the book of life—are sentenced to eternal, conscious torment (20:15)."
