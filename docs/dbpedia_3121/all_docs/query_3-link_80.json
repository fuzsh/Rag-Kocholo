        "text": "Introduction\n\nPoetry. Students tend to have strong feelings about it, some love the melodic rhythm and the eloquent way in which it encapsulates life and others hate it, either because they find it a snooze-fest and would rather read the dictionary, or they simply donât know how to approach analysing it. Whatever boat you may be in, by the end of your study of Peter Skrzyneckiâs New/Old World poems, youâre bound to have a new appreciation for the art that is poetry and find analysing poems less of a daunting prospect and more a something easy to nail.\n\nBefore we begin diving into Skrzynecki, Iâd highly recommend that you check our LSGâs Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response. Itâs jam-packed with awesome, FREE advice for how to ACE Text Response.\n\nAnalysing Poetry in Old/New World\n\nUnlike other forms of text, a collection of poems is not one continuous body of writing, instead a poetry collection is more like a series of vignettes, snapshots into poignant moments, in this case, of an authorâs life. Whilst many students may struggle with this form and ask âHow many poems do I analyse? Do I need to know all of them?â, poems are easier than most texts to prioritise and categorise into themes and often have a significant amount of metalanguage. And in answer to your questions, whilst its best you analyse the whole collection to some extent, knowing 10 or so strategically chosen poems really well, covering all themes and types should hold you in good stead for any question thrown at you in the exam.\n\nContext\n\nPeter Skrzynecki wrote his poems over a significant amount of time, starting in 1970 and ending in 2006. This has given the collection a unique perspective, not only demonstrating a migrantâs journey through narrative, but also by providing the different attitudes and feelings of belonging, experienced by one individual as they try to assimilate in their new world over a period of time. This gives us, as students, a wonderful opportunity to look deeper into the text and identify Skrzyneckiâs differing positions in regard to identity, family and belonging, through the perspective from which he writes his poems at different stages of his life.\n\nTo learn more about the importance of context in VCE English, check out this blog post.\n\nThe Structure\n\nSkrzyneckiâs collection tends to feature three types of poem, by identifying these, analysing each piece can be made easier as similar types of poem often focus on similar themes. The three categories of poetry to look for are:\n\nNature Poems\n\nPeter Skrzynecki showcases his connection to Australia through poems that depict often idyllic landscapes, or the lives of common fauna of Australia, such as birds and fish.\n\nThe Immigrant Experience\n\nThese poems such as Immigrants at Central Station, Migrant Hostel and The Polish Immigrant offer an insight into the emotionally turbulent and difficult journey migrants go through to live in Australia. These poems also demonstrate the experiences of relief and joy felt when arriving, as well as emotions of fear, trepidation and disconnect in regards to both their new home and their old world.\n\nFamily Poems\n\nOften the most emotionally pulling, these poems tug at the heartstrings and showcase the relationships between Peter Skrzynecki and his family, as well as his exploration of his heritage, his ties to his Polish background.\n\nThe new/old world structure, similar to the old and new testament of the bible are used to highlight the old world of Skrzyneckiâs Polish roots and childhood, whilst the new world is his new life in Australia.\n\nRecurring Characters in Old/New World\n\nPeter Skrzynecki\n\nThe author of this text, as well as a character in his own right, Peter describes his triumphs and struggles of immigrating to Australia in his poems.\n\nFeliks Skrzynecki\n\nThe Polish adopted father of Peter, a âgentle manâ who immigrated to Australia with him family from Germany often demonstrates the struggle of the older generation to fully âbelongâ, as they have grown up amongst different customs. This difference in the two generationsâ assimilation is depicted in the poem Feliks Skrzynecki, as we see Feliks as attached to his Polish customs and traditions, as he âreminisce[s]â with his Polish friends. We also discover that he struggles with the English language, is a hard worker and has had cancer twice in his foot. Peter in comparison is seen to have far more of a disconnect with his Polish ancestry he âinherited unknowinglyâ and forget his âfirst Polish wordâ as he learns of a culture âfurther South of Hadrianâs Wallâ.\n\nThemes in Old/New World\n\nAs we all know, themes are an integral part of Text Response overall, and that still rings true for Skrzyneckiâs poetry. To learn more about how to implement themes into different types of Text Response prompts, check out our blog on LSGâs Five Types of Text Response Prompts!\n\nBelonging\n\nOne of the most central themes of Skrzyneckiâs poems is that of belonging. As the poems detail an immigrantâs emotional journey, alternating between feeling that they belong and donât belong, we are invited to grapple with what it means to belong both mentally and physically as well as what elements are required to feel a sense of belonging in community and country.\n\nIdentity\n\nIdentity is another central theme, one that runs closely to that of belonging, as a main part of oneâs identity is the culture/place/family to which they feel they belong. Old/New World: New and Selected Poems explores the formation and changes in a migrantâs sense of identity as they try to find belonging in their new Australian home as well as later, when they try to reconnect with their European heritage. To explore the theme of identity itâs best to break it down into several influential factors, which are listed below:\n\nPlace\n\nThe surroundings in which a person finds themselves, as well as the place they call home is an essential part of identity, as it showcases what place one identifies with and feels safe in. Â Several of the poems are set in places of transition, such as at a train station, this helps to emphasize the displacement some migrants may feel as they struggle to acclimatise to their new home. In poems such as Immigrants at central station Skyznecki illustrates an environment of anxiety and trepidation, however, he finishes the poem with sentiments of hope of the new future, the new world the immigrants were travelling to, along âglistening tracks of steelâ.\n\nHeritage\n\nAn individualâs heritage, that is the places and people from which they come to identify with, is seen to have a profound impact on the characters in Skrzyneckiâs poems. There are several poems set in graveyards or in Europe where Peter questions his knowledge of where he came from, and his sense of connection to these people and places. One of the most interesting set of poems regarding heritage is the poems regarding the different sections of a graveyard for the different groups, through this Skrzynecki touches on how most will never fully part with their heritage, instead, even in death, most will reconnect with their upbringing and hold on to their roots.\n\nCustoms\n\nThe difference in a culturesâ customs is a struggle seen throughout the text. However, customs are also seen to be the way in which migrants make themselves at home whilst being able to still identify with their past. Through the generational gap between Peter and his father, we can identify the difficulty older generations may have in letting go of customs, whilst the younger new Australians often find it far easier to attach themselves to new traditions.\n\nLanguage\n\nAn integral part of identity and in cultivating a sense of belonging is the language that we speak, as the way in which we are able to communicate ourselves and who we have accessible conversation has a large impact on oneâs sense of belonging or disconnect from a culture . This is due to language barriersâ ability to foster or inhibit connection. We see this as Peter demonstrates his struggle at times to identify with his Polish roots, symbolised in his loss of Polish language as he âforgot [his] first Polish wordâ. Despite his father repeating it until he never forgets, this forgetfulness illustrates the effort which is often required to remain connected to heritage when physically distant from it. Languageâs ability to also expose the differences between people and make them feel like outsiders is also explored in First day of school and The Polish Immigrant as people such as teachers struggle with the pronunciation of Polish names and inevitably have to ask âboy, how do you pronounce that?â. We see through these poems how disconnect can be fostered due to the struggle of communication as the picking apart of their names make the new immigrants feel âtiredâ, âembarrass[ed]â and as if their name was that of a âEuropean diseaseâ. Language is also seen to hold migrants back as seen in Migrant Bachelor where a lack of a familiar language relegates a migrant to âfactory chimneys and punch card clocksâ which âask no proof of speechâ. Â This struggle with language, both the disconnect and joy that comes with communicating and the opportunities it affords individuals, is essential in determining how one identifies themselves.\n\nFamily/Ancestry\n\nHow connection to family members and knowledge of ancestry impacts sense of identity is investigated through many family poems and through Skrzyneckiâs somewhat frequent admissions of remorse in regard to not knowing the history behind objects or people. We also see how a difference in sense of belonging can affect relationships, in that we see Peter and his father donât have the closest of relationships, likely due to Peter feeling he belongs to Australia whilst Feliks still had strong connections to his Polish upbringing. Â We also see this regret of disconnect when Skrzynecki writes about his mother and the photograph he has of her and the man that was his father, and how he wishes he had asked about it more. Whilst Skrzynecki mainly describes the immigrant experience in his poems, we can also find an overarching warning to not take loved one, and their knowledge for granted, as often we donât have them for as long as we would hope.\n\nMemories\n\nSkrzynecki often reminisces about his childhood and uses it as a way to explore both his experience in his new world of Australia, and his old world of his Polish roots. We see Skrzynecki in Migrant Centre Site, revisiting the location where he first lived after arriving in Australia, noting that there was nothing to âcommemorate [their] arrivalâ, this perhaps demonstrates his desire for a legacy, to leave a footprint of the journey so many âthousandâ migrants travelled and not just a âslab of cementâ as if his home was a dead âcemeteryâ. He also reminisces in Old Hostel Site where he explores the âimmense souvenirsâ and âunclaimed baggageâ that is one of the first sites in Australia his parents arrived at. Using this jargon regarding travel, Skrzynecki reminds readers of the many miles migrants often have to travel to reach Australia.\n\nNature\n\nSkrzynecki often uses nature to symbolise the migrant experience, as demonstrated by the birds in his poem Migrant Hostel. In this poem migrants are compared to a âhoming pigeon/circling to get its bearingsâ as Peter remarks on the struggle of taking someone out of their previous home, like an animal out of its natural habitat.\n\nNature is also a major element in Skrzynecki's effort to become an Australian poet, his frequent referencing of Australian landscapes signposting his journey to identify as an Australian, as well as an Australian poet.\n\nHope and Loss\n\nNot only does Skrzynecki detail the hope for a new future and loss of home common in a migrantâs experience, his poems also cover other common situations of love and loss, such as his emotional poem Leukemia which details the journey of his father as a leukemia patient. This shows belonging and identity in a far different light, not in relation to a country but being identified by your sickness which âowns your nameâ. This explores the common experience where a patient feels defined by their condition and struggles to imagine/remember what life is like as a healthy individual.\n\nMetalanguage, Symbols and Motifs in Old/New World\n\nâ¢ Feliks Skrzyneckiâs garden: due to his strong bond to his Polish roots Feliks arguably never felt a sense of belonging in Australia. Instead we find he creates a sense of belonging by cultivating a home of his own, a garden.\n\nâ¢ Skrzynecki often uses the natural world such as fish and birds to mirror the migrant journey.\n\nâ¢ Skrzynecki litters his poems with heirlooms such as watches, hammers and photos, often to illustrate how despite having these possessions Peter frequently finds that he doesnât know the full story of his heritage and his parentâs life. In his rediscovery of the heirlooms we often see his disconnect from his background and his regret of not learning more about it.\n\nâ¢ The use of a colloquial idiom of âkept pace only with the Joneses'' in Feliks Skrzynecki, to reference how his belonging only feels surface deep. However, as they are only the Joneses of âhis own mindâs makingâ it also showcases his commitment to not simply copy and to still be individual.\n\nâ¢ Skrzynecki often uses places of transit such as train stations or hostels to showcase the uncertainty often experienced in a migrantâs journey.\n\nQuick Tips\n\nResearch the places referenced in Skrzynecki poems such as Mt Warning\n\nLearn to spell the authors last name\n\nDonât just analyse the poems individually, try and see the big picture and apply the overarching themes\n\nFor a more detailed guide on how to ACE VCE Text Response, I think youâd love the free sample of our top-rated eBook, How To Write A Killer Text Response!

For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nSummary\n\nSet in Dungatar, a barren wasteland of traditionalism and superstition, isolated amidst the rapidly modernising post-World War II Australia, acclaimed author Rosalie Hamâs gothic novel, The Dressmaker, provides a fascinating window into 1950s Australia. I find it to be one of the most intriguing texts of our time - managing to weave together a historical narrative with humour, wit, and modern-day social concerns regarding patriarchy, class, and the effects of isolation.\n\nThe Dressmaker is one of those texts which reinforces why studying English can be so great when you give it a proper chance. This subject isnât just about studying books and writing essays, itâs also about learning new insight youâll carry with you throughout your life. Specifically, The Dressmaker offers real insight into some of the most pressing issues that have been around for centuries - how communities respond to crisis, why certain groups are marginalised, and how we should respond to tyranny and intolerance. Hamâs novel is layered with meaning, character development, and a moving plot which really helps us reflect on who we are as people. Not every book can do that - and, seemingly, on a surface level, you wouldnât expect a novel about fashion and betrayal to do it either. But somehow, it just does, and itâs what makes The Dressmaker one of my favourite books of all time.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nBefore we move on to looking at The Dressmakerâs plot and delving deep into analysis, itâs really important to understand the main historical context which underpins the novel. By âhistorical contextâ, all we mean here is the factual background which tells us why Rosalie Ham wrote her novel, and why she chose the particular setting of Dungatar. After all, Dungatar is a fictionalised community, but its references to post-World War II Australia are very real. The main message I want you to take from this section is that understanding 1950s Australia is essential to understanding Dungatar.\n\nAustralian Geography and the Great Depression\n\nBefore we delve into talking about this historical theme, Iâd like to first acknowledge that Australia was colonised against the wishes of its First Nations peoples, and also recognise that sovereignty was never ceded. This discussion broadly reflects the experiences of colonised Australia because that is the frame which Rosalie Ham provides. However, at Lisaâs Study Guides, we acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which this study guide was written, edited, and published, and pay our respects to elders past, present, and emerging.Â\n\nHamâs fictional setting of Dungatar is a perfect example, as it is placed in the Australian Outback. The âOutbackâ doesnât exactly have any borders, so which regions of Australia count as part of the 'outback' will be slightly different from person to person. A general rule to help us understand the Outback is that it is way out in the centre of the country, far away from urban Australia. Its main industry is pastoralism, which refers to the grazing of cattle, sheep, and other species such as goats. This is a tough lifestyle, and as such small towns and a lot of room for livestock is preferable. These communities are often isolated, and donât really communicate with the outside world unless itâs about trading their livestock into the cities. Isolation tends to create its own culture, practices, and social standards. For Dungatar, we see massive economic divides and strict expectations around the role of men and women. For instance, the McSwineys live in absolute poverty, yet Councilman Evan and his family are relatively wealthy. Most of the women in the town either care for children or stay at home, reflecting the outdated idea that it is the role of the man to work, and the role of the woman to be a homemaker. As much as we can look at these ideas and realise how flawed they are, for Dungatar it is a way of life to which theyâve stuck for decades. Changing this way of life would be dangerous for them because it means they have to completely reconsider the way they live.\n\nPart 1: Plot\n\nMyrtle Dunnage arrives in Dungatar after many years, seeking to care for her mother Molly Dunnage.Â\n\nMyrtle, who now wishes to be known as Tilly, reconnects with Sergeant Farrat, Dungatarâs eccentric local policeman who is doing his evening lap in the town. He takes Tilly through the town and up âThe Hillâ, which is where Molly lives.Â\n\nWhile Tilly is caring for Molly, mental and physical illness causes her to believe that Tilly is an outsider who wishes to poison her. Tilly perseveres in order to shower, feed, and clothe the woman, as well as clear out the house.\n\nThe perspective changes to Sergeant Farrat, who is patrolling the town centre a day later. He sees a returned William Beaumont sitting in a car. Moving into Muriel and Alvin Prattâs General Store, Farrat claims to be buying fabric for his house. Their daughter Gertrude, who is reading a fashion magazine, realises that the material he is buying fits with the latest skirt designs across Australia.\n\nAfter learning about Mr Almanacâs pharmacy, the footballers move into Purl and Fred Bundleâs pub.Â\n\nThe readers are introduced to the McSwiney family, who with Edward and Mae as the father and mother, have 11 children. Theyâre said to live in the tip at the edge of town.Â\n\nThe following weekend Tilly and Molly leave The Hill to attend the football match played in Dungatar between the two neighbouring towns, Itheca and Winyerp. Lois Pickett and Beula Harridene give her an immediately negative reaction, taking offence when Molly questions whether their cakes are poisoned.\n\nAfter getting medicine from Mr. Almanac and his assistant Nancy, Tilly and Molly run into Irma, his sickly wife. Her arthritis makes mobility difficult, and as such she is found sitting on the bank of the river, where she asks Tilly not to let the town know that she had been cooking meals for Molly in Tillyâs absence.\n\nNancy and Sister Ruth Dimm are shown to be having a secret relationship in the back of the phone exchange building before the perspective moves back to Buela Harridene, who demands that Sergeant Farrat investigate the McSwiney children for supposedly pelting her roof with stones.\n\nTilly sits on the riverbank, remembering her memories and trauma in Dungatar, with the crucial event being when Stewart Pettyman attempted to headbutt Tilly, but she moved out of the way, causing him to ram into a wall, snap his neck and die.\n\nMarigold and Evan Pettyman are introduced to the audience, with Marigold being a nervous individual who is put to sleep by Evan with pills every night and sexually assaulted.\n\nFollowing Dungatarâs victory in the grand finale, which sends frivolity and celebration throughout the town, a package arrives for Tilly. Ruth reads through all its contents after picking its lock whilst Tilly reluctantly meets with Teddy, who continues to visit her.Â\n\nTilly and Molly visit the Almanacs for dinner, wherein Tillyâs medicine causes Irmaâs pain to disappear. Although Mr Almanac is unpleasant â stating that Tilly can never be forgiven for Pettymanâs death â the night moves on, Tilly returns home and is visited by Teddy yet again.Â\n\nPart 1: Quotes and Analysisâ\n\nâShe used to have a lot of falls, which left her with a black eye or a cut lip.â\n\nHere, Ham subtly hints that Irma Almanacâs injuries were not solely due to âfallsâ, as it is also said that once her husband grew old the âfallsâ progressively ceased. Abuse of women is common in Dungatar, and it is almost expected that women will be subservient to men and do as they demand.\n\nâHis new unchecked gingham skirt hung starched and pressed on the wardrobe doorknob behind him.â\n\nSergeant Farrat subverts social expectations placed upon 1950s men by adoring feminine fashion. However, the fact that he is forced to hide his passion reveals how, in conservative towns such as Dungatar, individuals are forced to suppress their true selves in order to fit in with the broader population. There is no room for individuality or creative expression, as this is seen as a challenge to Dungatarâs social order and the clear separation between the roles of men and women.\n\nâWhatâs the point of having a law enforcer if he enforces the law according to himself, not the legal law?â\n\nBuela Harridene pretends to care about the enforcement of the law, but her true concern is bending the law to her own will to make those who step outside of their socially defined roles suffer. She is at odds with Sergeant Farrat as he seeks to control the townspeopleâs worst instincts, yet people like Buela ensure that vengeance, rumour, and suspicion are still the defining features of Dungatar.\n\nâWell let me tell you if heâs got any queer ideas weâll all suffer.â\n\nAlthough this specifically refers to William Beaumont, it alludes to the broader picture that the people of Dungatar believe that any outside ideas fundamentally threaten everything about the way they live. Even before Beaumont has opened his mouth, he is already a threat since he may have witnessed another way of living disconnected from Dungatarâs conservatism.\n\nIf you'd like to see the all Chapter plots, their analysis, along with important quotes, then have a look at our The Dressmaker Study Guide.\n\nThemes, Motifs, and Key Ideas\n\nIsolation and Modernisation\n\nOne of the central conflicts in The Dressmaker is between the isolated town of Dungatar, and the rapidly modernising surroundings of post-depression 1950s Australia, as we established in Historical Context. Ham uses this dichotomy (meaning when two opposing factors are placed right next to each other) to question whether isolated communities like Dungatar really have a role in the modern world.Â\n\nOur clearest indication that Dungatar is not only traditionalistic, but absolutely reviles change and outside influence, is right at the start of the novel, when a train conductor laments that thereâs ânaught thatâs poetic about damn [progress].â Here, we see the overriding contention of Rosalie Hamâs novel - that because a community like Dungatar has been isolated for so long, it has become absolutely committed to maintaining its traditionalism at all costs. There are more symbolic reflections of how stagnant the town has become, such as the fact that Evan Pettyman, the townâs elected Councillor, has been in the role for multiple decades without fail - or that the same teacher who ostracised Tilly as a child, Prudence Dimm, is still in charge of the townâs school.Â\n\nSocial Class\n\nThe Dressmaker speaks extensively about social class. By class, what I mean is the economic and social divisions which determine where people sit in society. For instance, we could say that the British Royals are âupper classâ, whilst people living paycheque to paycheque and struggling to get by are âlower classâ.Â\n\nIt's also important to introduce the notion of a classist society. A classist society is one where all social relations are built on these aforementioned economic and social divides - in other words, everything you do in life, and everything you are able to do, is built on where you sit in the class structure.Â\n\nFor The Dressmaker, the question then becomes - \"how does class relate to Dungatar?\" Well, Dungatar is one of the most classist societies around, where societal worth is explicitly based on oneâs position in the class structure.\n\nFemininity, Fashion, and Patriarchy\n\nBy now, youâve probably realised that The Dressmakerâs title is significant. Fashion and âdressmakingâ are absolutely essential to understanding the life of Tilly Dunnage, and how she interacts with the people of Dungatar. Weâll go into this further, but Ham specifically delves into the power of fashion as a form of expression which empowers people and their femininity, yet she also examines how, in a community like Dungatar, fashion nonetheless ends up being entirely destructive.Â\n\nDungatar and Femininity\n\nThe idea of femininity describes, on a basic level, the ability of a woman to express herself independent of any man. Others would describe femininity in more definitive terms, but itâs really in the eyes of the beholder. Whatâs explicitly clear, however, isÂ that, in order to suppress femininity, women in Dungatar are repressed and kept under the control of men. Marigold Pettyman is raped by her husband, Evan Pettyman every night, while the âladies of Dungatarâ¦turn their backsâ when they see the Councillor coming - knowing his crimes, but being too afraid to challenge him. Above all else, Dungatar exists within a patriarchal framework, which is one where men hold structural power and authority, and that power relies on keeping women silent and subservient. In such a society, the role of women in Dungatar is vacuous (meaning that they donât have any real purpose) - they frill about, spread rumours, and otherwise have no set roles other than to be obedient to their husband.Â\n\nFashion as Empowerment\n\nWithin this context, Rosalie Ham explores the power of fashion to empower femininity, and, even if itâs in a limited sense, give the patriarchy its first real challenge. Gertrude is a perfect example, as Tillyâs dressmaking sees her eventually transform at her wedding, even though she is initially described as a âgood muleâ by Sergeant Farrat; symbolically being stripped of her humanity and beauty by being compared to an animal. However, Gertrude becomes the spectacle of the town at her wedding, wearing a âfine silk taffeta gownâ and presenting an elegant, empowered image. The townspeople even note that Tilly is an âabsolute wizard with fabric and scissorsâ, and, with the use of the word âwizardâ, it becomes evident that the women of Dungatar are absolutely unaccustomed to having any form of expression or individuality - a patriarchal standard which Tilly challenges through her work.Â\n\nThink also about Sergeant Farrat. Even if he isnât a woman, he nonetheless is able to embrace his feminine side through fashion. Indeed his âgingham skirtâ and secretive love of female fashion is utilised by Ham to demonstrate that, even in a patriarchal settlement like Dungatar, fashion is immensely empowering and important.\n\nFashion and Destruction\n\nHowever, as always, Ham elucidates that there too exists a dark side to fashion in a town like Dungatar. Ultimately, the women of Dungatar, in their elegant dresses, end up looking like a âgroup of European aristocratsâ wives who had somehow lost their wayâ. What this quote tells us is that, despite a temporary possibility for empowerment, the women of Dungatar did not fundamentally change their identities. As âaristocratsâ wivesâ, they are still tied to a patriarchal system in which, even if they were better dressed, nothing was ultimately done to overcome their tradition for rumour, suspicion, and ostracising outcasts. Indeed, this becomes most evident at the Social Ball, where, despite wearing Tillyâs dresses, her name is âscrubb[ed] outâ from the seating list - symbolically expressing a desire for Tillyâs modernising, urban, outside influence to be removed from Dungatar, even as they simultaneously wear her dresses!Â\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nTilly DunnageÂ\n\nTilly, or Myrtle Dunnage, is the protagonist of The Dressmaker, and an acclaimed dressmaker trained in Paris. Analysing Tilly requires an understanding that she believes she is cursed: starting with being exiled from Dungatar after the accidental death of Stewart Pettyman, and then finding her âseven month oldâ baby Pablo âin his cot...deadâ, as well as witnessing the deaths of Teddy and Molly. In her own words, she is âfalser than vows made in wineâ, and does not personally believe she can be trusted. This pessimistic perspective on life inspires Tilly to adopt an incredibly individualistic understanding of the world; believing that the only way for her to survive is embracing her individual worth and rejecting toxic communities. Indeed, although Tilly initially arrived in Dungatar to care for her mother - a selfless act - the town spiralling into vengeance only confirmed Tillyâs pessimism. Her modern dressmaking ultimately could not change a fundamentally corrupt community predicated on ânothing ever really chang[ing]â, and therefore the maintenance of a culture of rumour and suspicion. Indeed, in âraz[ing Dungatar] to the groundâ, Rosalie Ham reminds us that Tilly is an unapologetically individually-focused person, and will not tolerate anyone, or anything, which seeks to make her conform to the status quo and repress her individuality.\n\nMolly DunnageÂ\n\nMolly Dunnage is Tillyâs mother, a bedridden, elderly woman whose sickness drives Tilly back into Dungatar. Molly is commonly known as âMad Mollyâ by the townspeople, but what this hides is the fact that Molly was not born mentally insane. Rather, after being âtormentedâ by Evan Pettyman into having his illegitimate child and seeing Tilly exiled from Dungatar, the malicious actions of the community drive her into insanity. Even in her incapacitated and crazed state, Molly holds such love for Tilly that she attempts to stop her engaging with the community, and thus the symbolism of Molly âdismant[ling] her sewing machine entirelyâ was that, due to her experiences, she did not believe that the people of Dungatar would ever accept Tilly, either as a dressmaker or a person. Mollyâs death is ultimately a pivotal event, and awakens Tilly to the fact that only ârevenge [could be] our causeâ, and thus that Dungatar is fundamentally irredeemable.\n\nTeddy McSwineyÂ\n\nTeddy McSwiney is the eldest son of the McSwiney family, Dungatarâs poorest residents. Teddy is a unique case, as although heâs a McSwiney, he is noted for being incredibly well-liked in the town - even going so far as to be described by Purl as the townâs âpriceless full forwardâ in Dungatarâs AFL team. Nonetheless, as we discussed under the Social Class theme, Dungatar remains an unashamedly classist society, and as such, despite Teddy being valued in his usefulness as a footy player and the ânice girls lov[ing] himâ, he âwas a McSwineyâ - discounted from the townâs dating scene or any true level of social worth. Teddy becomes essential to the plot when he and Tilly spark a budding romance. Whereas the majority of Dungatar rejects Tilly or refuses to stand against the crowd, Teddy actively seeks to remind Tilly of her worth - saying that he âdoesnât believe in cursesâ. However, his death after suffocating in a âsorghum millâ reiterates a sad reality in Dungatar; it is always the most vulnerable townspeople who pay the price for classist discrimination, ostracisation, and suspicion.Â\n\nSergeant FarratÂ\n\nSergeant Farrat is one of The Dressmakerâs most interesting characters. On the surface, heâs nothing but a police officer who manages Dungatar. However, Farratâs position is far more complex than meets the eye - as a police officer, he is entrusted with enforcing the âlegal lawâ, yet must also contain the influence of malicious individuals such as Buela Harradine who would otherwise use the enforcement of that law to spread slander about individuals like the McSwineys, who she considers âbludgersâ and âthievesâ. Despite Dungatarâs complications, Farrat considers the townspeople âhis flockâ, and this religious, Christ-like imagery here tells us how he is essentially their protector. Farrat is, in essence, entrusted with preventing the townspeople from destroying themselves (by now, we all know how easily the townspeople slide into hatred and division!). Hereâs the interesting thing though - at the same time Sergeant Farrat is protecting Dungatar, he is also personally repressed by its conservative standards. Rosalie Ham establishes Farrat as a man with a love for vibrant, expressive, female fashion, and from his âgingham skirtsâ which he sews in private to his time spent with Tilly while she sews, Ham demonstrates to us that Dungatarâs conservatism affects everyone. Even though he tries to defend Tilly as the townspeople descend on her after Teddyâs death, Tilly destroys his house along with Dungatar anyway - signalling that, no matter how hard Sergeant Farrat tried to reconcile his position as protector of Dungatar and his own person, the town could not be saved.\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nStructure\n\nThe Dressmaker is written in the Gothic style, which means it combines romance with death and horror, particularly horror of the emotional kind. The Dressmaker is divided into four sections, each named after a type of fabric Tilly uses in her work. You can use these in your essays to show how important dressmaking and fashion is to the plotâs progression, especially considering each section starts with fabric. The four types are:\n\n1. Gingham\n\nA fabric made from cotton or yarn, with a checkered shape. Gingham is often used as a âtest fabricâ in designing fashion or for making tablecloths. This gives it a rustic, imperfect feel signifying Tillyâs return to her hometown and complicated past. The name is thought to originate from a Malay word meaning âseparateâ, mirroring Tillyâs feelings of isolation from the rest of Dungatar. In this section of the novel, Sergeant Farrat also buys gingham fabric to secretly make into a skirt, symbolising how the town is still rife with secrets and a disparity between the public and private personas of its inhabitants.Â\n\n2. Shantung\n\nA fabric used for bridal gowns. Gertrude is married in this section and her dress, which Tilly makes, is the first instance where the town witnesses her work. Shantung originates from China, matching this notion of exoticism and foreignness which seeing the dress spreads among the townspeople.Â\n\n3. Felt\n\nA fabric noted for its ability to be used for a wide variety of purposes. This is the section in which the ball occurs and a variety of Tillyâs dresses are unveiled for the town to see.Â\n\n4. Brocade\n\nA richly decorative fabric made with threads of gold and silver. Brocade is used primarily for upholstery, drapery, and costumes. This is a reference to the costumes of Dungatarâs play, the climax of the novel which occurs in this section.\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\n1. âThey looked like a group of European aristocratsâ wives who had somehow lost their way.â Fashion is both liberating and oppressive.

This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nTheme-Based Prompt: Rosalie Hamâs The Dressmaker condemns fundamentally oppressive communities. Discuss.\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nWeâve got a theme-based prompt here, which really calls for your essay to be explicitly focused on the theme at hand. That means that we shouldnât stray from the idea of âoppressive communitiesâ. Keep it as the centre of your essay and look at how events relate to this idea - weâll break it down more in Step 2 so you can properly explore it.\n\nBecause thereâs a âDiscussâ qualifier added to the end of the prompt, a clear and concise contention is really important. What youâre being asked to do is, again, stick with the topic frame. That means that going for the usual âtwo agree, one disagreeâ structure is decent, but I wouldnât suggest it as the most efficient way to go. Instead, what youâll see that I do with this essay is âdiscussâ how the topic is present throughout all three of our arguments.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nLetâs start by breaking down the key words of the topic.\n\nWe have the idea of an âoppressive communityâ, which refers to communities that are built on marginalising certain individuals so the majority can maintain power. This is quite a clear reference to Dungatar, but expect that most essay questions for The Dressmaker wonât directly reference Tilly or the town, even if theyâre quite clearly talking about them. Something for which you should look out â donât let the wording phase you!\n\nThe addition of the word âfundamentallyâ doesnât change that much, but what it does tell us is that the essay is asking us to agree that Dungatar is oppressive to its core. In other words, its âfundamentalsâ are based on oppression. I would not recommend trying to disagree with this basic premise, as it means youâre going against the topic in a âDiscussâ prompt which, as we discussed above, isnât the best option in my view.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nOne of the most logical ways to approach this topic is a chronological structure. By that, what I mean is following the text in the order events occur; before Tillyâs arrival, during Tillyâs time in Dungatar, and the consequences that arise after they make her an outcast once again.\n\nThis way, you can stay on topic and look at how Dungatar is oppressive even before Tilly shows up again, how that ramps up as she establishes her dressmaking business, and what Hamâs final message is on rejecting oppressive communities and embracing individual worth.\n\nIf you find this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our The Dressmaker Study Guide where we cover 5 A+ sample essays with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY these essays achieved A+ so you reach your English goals!

Gail and Wesley, Davidâs parents, attempt to enlist the help of Wesleyâs brother Frank, a well-respected doctor in the community. However, Marie reacts to this idea with fear, anxiety and resistance. Gail concludes that something sinister must be happening for her to have such a reaction and she presses Marie for why she is so afraid. Marie then reveals to Gail that she has heard that Dr Frank has been sexually abusing many of his female Native American patients. Gail immediately confides in Wesley who is both the Sheriff of their town and Frankâs brother. This becomes the central source of tension, as Wes must decide between his duty as the Sheriff and his loyalty to his family.\n\nThis is all told from the perspective of David, our protagonist, who has to watch his father confront his Uncle Frank about these taboo accusations. Eventually, it seems they reach an agreement with Frank to stop the abuse.\n\nMarie is discovered dead the next day in her bed when Gail goes to check up on her. Later that night, David admits to his parents that he saw Frank go into their home in the afternoon and immediately, Wesley concludes that Frank âis guilty as sinâ for murdering Marie. As the Sheriff of the town, Wesley is obligated to arrest Frank, but in order to spare Frank the embarrassment, he keeps Frank in their basement instead of sending him to jail. Â\n\nUpon hearing this news, Davidâs grandfather, Julian, orders Wesley to release Frank. Julian accuses Wesley of arresting him out of jealousy and he threatens to use his power within the community to set Frank free. At this point, Wesley realises that the power of his father would only be matched by the law, and he decides that he must officially prosecute his brother.\n\nThat next day, David, Wes and Gail wake up to find Frank dead, having used broken glass to slit his wrists and commit suicide. Young David believes that this was the right action and hopes that everything would go back to normal. But as the story goes, this is not the case.\n\nThemes\n\nPrejudice, discrimination and the abuse of power\n\nAnother key theme is prejudice, discrimination and the abuse of power. Frankâs abuse of the Native American women is both an abuse of his power and responsibilities as a Doctor and a way to take advantage of his personal belief in White âracial superiority.â Julian and Frank embody the toxic, violent and bigoted mentality prevalent during that time period, which Watson deplores as reprimandable and unacceptable. Even at the novelâs close, Frankâs death is symbolic in two ways. Firstly, it means that Frank managed to escape persecution, public denouncement and jail time. But more importantly, he is still revered in the community as a ârespected manâ and a âwar hero. '' Therefore, while he physically passes away, his âlegacyâ and faÃ§ade of heroism remains alive.\n\nLaw vs Justice\n\nOne of the central themes of âMontana 1948â is the conflict between abiding by the law and doing what is just. Due to the institutionalised racism that existed in the 1940âs, Frankâs actions were not considered technically illegal, however, by intuitive standards of morality, his rape of Natives in his practice and his subsequent murder of Marie clearly warrant punishment. Thus, Watson touches on the failures of the judicial system to consistently hand out judgements that are morally fair and instead reveals the flaws within the legal system of the time that reflect widespread and corrupt social attitudes.\n\nLoyalty vs Morality\n\nWatson also touches on the conflict between loyalty and morality. This, as we know, forms the crux of narrativeâs tension. Should Wes arrest and prosecute his brother Frank or not? Should he stay loyal to his family or uphold the moral values that he must stand by as the towns Sheriff? Gail, Davidâs mother, embodies all the virtues of morality that we all stand by and she is appalled by Frankâs behaviour and demands that he be persecuted regardless of his relationship with Wes. In sharp contrast, Julian believes that Frank can be excused for his actions because the victims were merely âred meatâ Native American women who he views as subhuman.\n\nâ\n\nCharactersÂ\n\nGail:\n\nGail is Davidâs mother and Wesleyâs wife. She is a compassionate, idealistic and courageous woman. This can also be seen as she stands up for Marie, despite the prejudices in the society at the time. She also spends a âgood deal of energyâ protecting herself and her family.Â She also doesnât take part in Wesleyâs racist jokes. For example, when Wesley makes a joke about Marie, ânever been to anyone but the tribal medicine manâ, David responds with âmy mother didnât laugh.â\n\nDavid:\n\nDavid is Wesley and Gailâs son and is the narrator of the text. He doesnât share Wesleyâs beliefs surrounding race and forms his own moral perspective. This is demonstrated when he makes a fuss about wanting to wear moccasins (which Gail sides with him on) while his father says will make him âas flat-footed and lazy as an Indian.âÂ\n\nUnlike his father, we donât see David conflicted with his loyalties and he is particularly critical of his father. This is best demonstrated when he âwas beginning to already think of Uncle Frank as a criminalâ upon hearing sexual assault accusations against Frank. When Wesley spares Gail the details of his investigation into Frank, David believes it could be because he is âtrying to protect his brother and keeping the number of witnesses to the accounts of his crime to a minimumâ. After Wesley arrests Frank and takes him to the basement for imprisonment, David assumes his father killed Frank despite Wesley not being depicted as a particularly violent person in the novel.Â All it takes is an indistinct noise from the basement for David to conjure up ways his father could have killed his Uncle Frank.\n\nFrank:\n\nFrank is Wesleyâs brother and is described as a âwitty and charmingâ doctor, and war hero who is widely loved by the community -particularly by his dad, Julian. In reality, Frank is a criminal who abuses his power - both a white man and a doctor to sexually assault Indian women - which he believes he can get away with.Â This is compounded when he states, âI am not concerned about social progress.â Through Frank, Watson demonstrates how some individuals can abuse their positions of power and privilege, and to not lose any sleep over it (âat smiling ease with his life and everything itâ).\n\nWesley:\n\nWesley is Julianâs son, Gailâs husband, and Davidâs father and the sheriff of Mercer county. He dislikes Native Americans and frequently makes jokes about them and stereotypes them. He even uses the fact that Marie Little Soldiers is a Native American to belittle and doubt the credibility of her experience.Â\n\nWesleyâs conflicting loyalties become more complex and difficult once you consider the prejudices at the time, his job as an officer of the law, Frankâs station in the family and community, Gailâs strong opinions and his constant need to seek validation from his father. An instance that mirrors Wesleyâs conflicting loyalties is when he tells Gail, âI wish you wouldnât have told the sheriff.â When she told informed him of Marieâs sexual assault allegations against Frank. However, in Wesleyâs eyes, Frankâs murder of Marie Little Soldier, is where the latter crosses the line. The magnitude of his brotherâs crime is too large for him to let his previous conflicting loyalties as a sheriff and a brother hold him back from arresting Frank. After convicting Frank and having to argue about it with his father, we learned âfor the first time how this experience with his brother was ruining him physically.âÂ\n\nJulian:\n\nJulian is a bigoted racist man who has an unconditional love for his son Frank and unfairly favours him over his son Wesley. When he learns of Franks charges he exclaims, âWhat kind of bullshit is this?â He belittles the sexual assaults as Frank just âfeeling them upâ and âassaulting an Indianâ. At this point, Julian taking Frankâs side exposes how irrationally loyal he is to his son and suggests that even if the women were not Indian, he may still stand by Frank's actions. He protests that the only reason Wesley convicted Frank was that âever since the war, ever since Frank came home in uniform and he [Wesley] stayed here [home],â heâs âbeen jealousâ. However, this comment seems to say more about Julianâs feelings than Wesleyâs - perhaps, this is why Julain felt this inclination towards Frank. After this argument, we see Wesleyâs feeling of defeat and heartbreak - that despite Frank being a murderer and a rapist, his father still seemed to pick his side over Wesleyâs.Â\n\nQuotesÂ\n\nQuotes on Prejudices, Discrimination and the Abuse of Power\n\nâHe wears those and soon he'll be as flat-footed and lazy as an Indian\" - Discrimination is evident in Montana 1948 where Wesley uses stereotypes of Indians to imply they are inferior to them, and that David shouldnât be like them.\n\n\"She's an Indian- Why would she tell the truth?âÂ Â\n\nâYour mother and I thought weâd have more to show than just one grandchild â¦ and white- we want them we want them whiteâ\n\nâScrewing an Indian. Or feeling her up or whatever. You donât lock up a man for that.â\n\nâYou know Frankâs always been partial to red meat.âÂ Â\n\nâWell if Sheriff Hayden says it's so, it must be so.â\n\nâWesley, your brother is raping these women. These girls. These Indian girls.â\n\nQuotes on Law vs Justice\n\nâWhy did my grandfather first run for sheriff? â¦ He wanted, he needed power. He was a dominating man who drew sustenance and strength from controlling others.â This quote shows that many people in society at the time held positions of power such as lawyers or sheriff but didnât enforce the law or worry about the morality of their actions. Thus creating an unjust legal system that would allow these people to shape how the law is enforced with their own prejudices.\n\nâYou know what your Grandad said it means to be a peace officer in Montana? He said it means knowing when to look and when to look away.âÂ Â\n\nâI think the problem has been taken care of. Frank said heâs going to cut it outâ\n\nâWell if Sheriff Hayden says it's so, it must be so.â\n\nQuotes on Loyalty vs Morality\n\n\"David, I believe that in this world people must pay for their crimes. It doesn't matter who you are or who your relations are; if you do wrong, you pay. I believe that. I have to.\"\n\nâI wish you wouldnât have told the sheriff.âÂ\n\nâI think the problem has been taken care of. Frank said heâs going to cut it outâ\n\nâWell if Sheriff Hayden says it's so, it must be so.â\n\nâYou donât lock up your brother. A respected man. A war hero.â âThis is a legal matter.â âBullsh*t.â âThen why have you got him locked up here and not over at the jail? This is your brother here. My son!â\n\nQuotes on Destruction of Innocence\n\n'I had gone back into the house -to the kitchen, to my room, out the backdoor, I had left the porch and followed frank's steps down the front walk - I never would have heard the conversation between my father and mother, and perhaps I would have lived my life with an illusion about my family and perhaps the human communityâ - page 33\n\nâThe shock of hearing this about Uncle Frank was doubled because my mother was saying these words. Rape. Breasts. Penis. These were words I never heard my mother use-ever- and Iâm sure her stammer was not only from emotion but also from the strain on her vocabulary.â\n\nâBut I was on a trail that would lead me out of my childhood.â\n\nâ\n\nWith contributions from Fae Saberi.\n\nThe Great Gatsby is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response.

The 1920s saw significant economic growth after WWI, and whatâs more American than material excess, wealth, and prosperity? The stock market was going off, businesses were booming, and people were having a great time.\n\nWell, not everybodyâand on the flipside, whatâs more American than socio-economic inequality or the ever-quixotic American Dream?\n\nIn this blog, weâll go through the novel in this context, examine some of its key themes, and also have a think about the critiques it raises about American society. Weâll also go through an essay prompt that ties some of these things together.\n\nLife in the Roaring Twenties\n\nThis snapshot from the 2013 film adaptation actually tells us a lot about the 1920s. On the one hand, social and cultural norms were shiftingâmen no longer sported beards, and women were dressing more androgynously and provocatively. On the other hand, the modern, American economy was emergingâpeople began buying costly consumer goods (like cars, appliances, telephones etc.) using credit rather than cash. This meant that average American families were able to get these things for the first time, while more prosperous families were able to live in extreme excess.\n\nIn Fitzgeraldâs novel, the Buchanans are one such family. Tom and his wife Daisy have belonged to the 1% for generations, and the 1920s saw them cement their wealth and status. At the same time, the booming economy meant that others (like the narrator Nick) were relocating to cities in pursuit of wealth, and (like Gatsby) making significant financial inroads themselves.Â\n\nThe Great Gatsby traces how the differences between these characters can be destructive even if theyâre all wealthy. Add a drop of Gatsbyâs unrequited love for Daisy, and you have a story that ultimately examines how far people go for romance, and what money simply canât buy.Â\n\nThe answer to that isnât so obvious though. Yes, money canât buy love, but it also canât buy a lot of other things associated with the lifestyle and the values of established wealth. Weâll get into some of this now.\n\nWealth and class\n\nFitzgerald explores tensions between three socio-economic classesâthe establishment, the ânouveau richeâ and the working class.\n\nTom and Daisy belong to the âold moneyâ establishment, where wealth is generational and inherited. This means they were born into already wealthy families, which affects their upbringing and ultimately defines them, from the way they speak (Tomâs âpaternal contemptâ and Daisyâs voice, âfull of moneyâ) to their major life decisions (including marriage, symbolised through the âstring of pearlsâ he buys for herâwhich, fun fact, is estimated to be worth millions of dollars today). It also affects their values, as weâll see in the following section.Â\n\nFor now, consider this image of their home (and those ponies on the left, which they also own), described as follows:\n\nâThe lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for [400 metres], jumping over sun-dials and brick walls and burning gardensâfinally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run.â\n\nNick Carraway also comes from a similar (though not as extravagant) backgroundâhis family had been rich by Midwestern standards for âthree generationsâ before he came to New York.\n\nConversely, Gatsby belongs to the ânouveau richeâ, or new money. Unlike the Buchanans, Gatsby was born into a poor family, only coming to wealth in the 1920s boom. Specifically, he inherited money from Dan Cody after running away from home at 17.\n\nAlthough they are all rich, there are significant cultural differences between old and new money. Old money have their own culture of feigned politeness which Gatsby doesnât quite get. When Tom and the Sloanes invite Nick and Gatsby to supper in chapter six, Gatsby naively accepts, to which Tom would respond behind his back, âDoesnât he know [Mrs. Sloane] doesnât want him?â Even though Gatsby is financially their equal, his newfound wealth canât buy his way into their (nasty, horrible) lifestyle.\n\nFinally, this is contrasted with the working class, particularly George and Myrtle Wilson who we meet in chapter two. They live in a grey âvalley of ashesâ, the detritus of a prosperous society whose wealth is limited to the 1%. Fitzgerald even calls it a âsolemn dumping groundâ, suggesting that life is precarious and difficult here. Consider what separates Georgeââblond, spiritlessâ¦ and faintly handsomeââfrom Tom (hint: $$).\n\nMyrtle is described differently, howeverâshe is a âfaintly stoutâ woman with âperceptible vitalityâ. This may be less of a description of her and more of a commentary on Tomâs sexuality, and what attracts him to her such that he cheats on Daisy with her. Still, Myrtleâs relative poverty is evident in her expressions of desire throughout their meetingââI want to get one of those dogs,â she says, and Tom just hands her the money.\n\nUltimately, looking at the novel through the lens of class, we see a society where upward social mobility and making a living for yourself is possible, just not for everybody. Even when you get rich, it doesnât guarantee that youâll suddenly, seamlessly integrate into the lives of old money.Â\n\nMorality and values\n\nAdded to this story of social stratification is a moral dimension, where Fitzgerald can be a little more critical.Â\n\nFirstly, old money is portrayed as shallow. Daisyâs marriage to Tom and the Sloanesâ insincerity are elements of this, but another good example is Gatsbyâs party guests. Many arenât actually invitedâthey invite themselves, and âthey came and went without having met Gatsby at all.â Their vacuous relationship to Gatsby is exposed when he dies, and they completely abandon him. Klipspringer, âthe boarderâ, basically lived in Gatsbyâs house, and even then he still wouldnât come to the funeral, only calling up to get a âpair of shoesâ back.Â\n\nThe rich are also depicted as cruel and inconsiderate, insulated from repercussions by their wealth. Nickâs description of Tomâs âcruel bodyâ is repeatedly realised, as he breaks Myrtleâs nose in chapter two and condescends Gatsby with âmagnanimous scornâ in chapter seven. After Myrtle dies, Nick spots the Buchanans âconspiringâ and describes them as âsmash[ing] up things and creatures and then retreat[ing] back into their money or their vast carelessnessââhe sees them as fundamentally selfish.\n\nGatsby is portrayed more sympathetically though, which may come from his humble upbringing and his desire to be liked. This is probably the key question of the novelâis he a hero, or a villain? The moral of the story, or a warning? Consumed by love, or corrupted by wealth?\n\nIâm going to leave most of those for the next section, but Iâll finish here with one last snippet: Lucille, a guest at his parties, tears her dress and Gatsby immediately sends her a ânew evening gownâ. Weird flex, but at least heâs being selflessâ¦\n\nHonesty\n\nThat said, a major part of Gatsbyâs character is his dishonesty, which complicates his moral identity.Â\n\nFor starters, he fabricates a new identity and deals in shady business just to reignite his five-year-old romance with Daisy. We see this through the emergence of Meyer Wolfsheim, with whom he has unclear business âgonnegtionsâ, and the resultant wealth he now enjoys.Â\n\nIn chapter three, Owl Eyes describes Gatsby as a âregular Belascoâ, comparing him to a film director who was well-known for the realism of his sets. This is a really lucid analysis of Gatsby, who is in many ways just like a film director constructing a whole fantasy world.\n\nItâs also unclear if he loves Daisy for who she is, or just the idea of Daisy and the wealth she represents. Indeed, he doesnât seem to treat her as a person, but more like something that he can pursue (like wealth). This is a good read, so I wonât really get into it hereâjust consider how much things have changed since Gatsby first met Daisy (like her marriage and her children), and how Gatsby ignores the way her life has changed in favour of his still, stationary memory of who she used to be.\n\nLove, desire and hope\n\nAll of this makes it tricky to distil what the novelâs message actually is.Â\n\nIs it that Gatsby is a good person, especially cast against the corrupt old money?Â\n\nThis analysis isnât wrong, and it actually works well with a lot of textual evidence. Where Nick resents the Buchanans, he feels sympathy for Gatsby. He explicitly says, âtheyâre a rotten crowdâ¦youâre worth the whole damn bunch put together.â Maybe love was an honourable goal compared to money, which ostensibly makes you âcruelâ and âcarelessâ.Â\n\nI wouldnât say he was cruel, but this reading is complicated by how he can be careless, choosing not to care about Daisyâs agency, and letting his desires overtake these considerations.Â\n\nIs it that Gatsby and his desire for Daisy were corrupted by wealth despite his good intentions?Â\n\nThereâs also evidence to suggest wealth corruptsâNick describes it as âfoul dustâ that âpreyedâ on Gatsby, eroding his good character and leaving behind someone who resembles the vacuous elite. Although love mightâve been an honourable goal, it got diluted by money.Â\n\nGatsbyâs paradigm for understanding the world becomes driven by materialism, and he objectifies Daisy. He starts trying to buy something that he originally didnât need to buyâDaisyâs love. She certainly didnât fall in love with this man who owned a mansion and a closet full of âbeautiful shirts.â Thus, Gatsby is a sympathetic product of a system that was always stacked against him (a poor boy from North Dakota). Capitalism, right?\n\nIs it that capitalist America provides nothing for people to pursue except for wealth, and therefore little reason for people to feel hope?\n\nWellâ¦\n\nPast the basics: structural economic tension and the doomed American Dream\n\nNow we want to start thinking beyond the characters (e.g. if Gatsby is a good person or not) and also factor in their social, historical, political and economic context (e.g. if he was doomed to begin with by a society driven by money). This subheading does sound a bit much, but weâll break it down here.Â\n\nA key part of this novel is the American Dream, the idea that America is a land of freedom and equal opportunity, that anyone can âmake itâ if they truly try. Value is placed on upward social mobility (moving up from a working-class background) and economic prosperity (making $$), which defined much of the Roaring 20sâ¦\n\nâ¦for some.Â\n\nFor many others, there was significant tension between these lofty values and their lived reality of life on the ground. As much as society around them was prospering, they just couldnât get a piece of the pie, and this is what makes it structuralâas hard as George Wilson might work, he just canât get himself out of the Valley of Ashes and into wealth. Indeed, you canât achieve the Dream without cheating (as Gatsby did).Â\n\nSo, thereâs this tension, this irreconcilable gap between economic goals and actual means. Through this lens, the tragedy of The Great Gatsby multiplies. Itâs no longer just about someone who canât buy love with moneyâitâs about how nobodyâs dreams are really attainable. Not everyone can get money, and money can only get you so far. Everyone is stuck, and the American Dream is basically just a myth.Â\n\nThus, the novel could be interpreted as a takedown of capitalist America, which convinced people like Gatsby that the answer to everything was money, and he bolted after the âgreen lightâ allure of cold, hard cash only to find out that it wasnât enough, that it wasnât the answer in the end.Â (.\n\nConsider what kind of message that sends to people like the Wilsonsâif money canât actually buy happiness, what good is it really to chase it? And remember that Gatsby had to cheat to get rich in the first place.Â\n\nIs [the novelâs message] that capitalist America provides nothing for people to pursue except for wealth, and therefore little reason for people to feel hope?\n\nYou tell me.\n\nPrompt: what does Fitzgerald suggest about social stratification in the 1920s?\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nLetâs try applying this to a prompt. Iâll italicise the key points that have been brought up throughout this post.Â\n\nFirstly, social stratification clearly divided society along economic lines. This could be paragraph one, exploring how class separated the Buchanans and Wilsons of the world, and how their lifestyles were so completely different even though they all lived in the prosperity of the Roaring 20s. George Wilson was âworn-outâ from work, but he still couldnât generate upward social mobility for his family, stuck in the Valley of Ashes. Conversely, Tom Buchanan is born into a rich family with his beach-facing mansion and polo ponies. Colour is an important symbol hereâthe Valley is grey, while East Egg is filled with colour (a green light here, a âblue coupeâ thereâ¦).\n\nThe next paragraph might look at the cultural dimension, exploring how you just canât buy a way of life. This might involve analysing Gatsbyâs wealth as deluding him into thinking he can ârepeat the pastâ by buying into the life(style) of old money. This is where Fitzgerald disillusions us about the American Dreamâhe presents a reality where it isnât possible for anyone to âmake itâ, where the Buchanans still treat you with scorn even if youâre just as wealthy. Gatsbyâs dishonesty is ultimately a shallow oneâtry as he might, he just cannot fit in and win Daisy back.\n\nFinally, we should consider the moral dimensionâeven though the wealthier socioeconomic classes enjoyed more lavish, luxurious lifestyles, Fitzgerald also argued that they were the most morally bankrupt. Money corrupted the wealthy to the point where they simply did not care about the lives of the poor, as seen in the Buchanansâ response to Myrtleâs death. Even Gatsby had to compromise his integrity and deal in shady business in order to get richâhe isnât perfect either. Social stratification may look ostentatious and shiny on the outside, but the rich are actually portrayed as shallow and corrupt.Â\n\nA good essay on this novel will typically combine some of these dimensions and build a multilayered analysis. Stratification, love, wealth, moralityâall of these big ideas can be broken down in terms of social, economic, cultural circumstances, so make sure to consider all angles when you write.Â\n\nHave a go at these prompts!\n\n1. Nick is biased in his assessment of Gatsbyâboth of them are no better than the corrupt, wealthy Buchanans. Do you agree?\n\n2. In The Great Gatsby, money is a stronger motivating factor than love. Do you agree?\n\n3. Daisy Buchanan is more innocent than guiltyâexplore this statement with reference to at least 2 other characters.Â\n\n4. What does Fitzgerald say about happiness in The Great Gatsby?\n\n5. Is money the true antagonist of The Great Gatsby?\n\n6. The women of The Great Gatsby are all victims of a patriarchal society. To what extent do you agree? (Hint: are they all equally victimised?)\n\nChallenge: According to Fitzgerald, what really lays underneath the faÃ§ade of the Roaring 20s? Make reference to at least 2 symbols in The Great Gatsby. (Hint: faÃ§ade = âan outward appearance that conceals a less pleasant realityâ â think about things like colours, clothes, buildings etc.)\n\nResources\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response\n\nHow To Write A Killer Text Response Study Guide\n\nHow to embed quotes in your essay like a boss\n\nHow to turn your Text Response essays from average to A+\n\n5 Tips for a mic drop worthy essay conclusion\n\nThe Importance of the Introduction\n\n[Video Transcription]\n\nYouâll often find that study guides begin with a section on historical context. Even though it might be tempting to skip over this section, thereâs a lot you can take away from understanding the period of time in which your texts are set in. Iâll show you how with examples for both Ransom and The Queen in this video.\n\nLetâs start with a brief overview of why you need to know the historical context. Context, a topic explored in detail in ourÂ How To Write A Killer Text Response, plummets you back to the era of when your texts were set. You effectively âstep into the shoesâ of the people living in that time, and in doing so, gain a better understanding of their views and values. Peopleâs views and values are often shaped by important events of the time, social culture and norms, and everyday experiences. For example, think about your own context. Youâre part of Generation Z, and one defining part of a Gen Z experience is growing up with technology from a young age. Social media is just normality, pretty much everyone has it, uses it as a source of online communication. So how does this shape your views and values? By having access to online information in this way, Gen Zers tend to be more passionate about social issues, because people of this age can leverage social media to voice their opinions or follow those who resonate with them. Only 20 years or so ago, we only had giant media that voiced their own opinions via newspapers or TV. You didnât have such a wide array of voices from people of different races or experiences. Think about the recent death of George Floyd, and the incredible ripple effect his death had on the world and the power of social media in the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nSo looking at The Queen and Ransom, we want to dive right into their respective eras and understand how people thought and felt during these time periods. This helps us better understand what the messages Frears and Malouf are trying to tell or teach us through their works, enabling you to write better essays. Letâs start with The Queen.\n\nThe Queen\n\nThe 1980s to 1990s was a time when the world wasÂ enamouredÂ by the Princess of Wales (or Diana, as weâll call her). Her shyness, broken family history, ongoing charitable efforts, and iconic fashion choices made her a royal favourite. She was dubbed the âPeopleâs Princessâ not only because of her relatability but also because of her tenuous relationship with the royal family. Sheâd been wronged by the royal family; first by Prince Charlesâ affair with Camilla, then with the lack of support from the Queen when she asked for marriage advice.\n\nAt the time, public opinion of the royal family was greatly influenced by tabloid papers - after all, there was no Instagram for the royals to tell their own story. After an estimated 750 million people tuned in to watch Dianaâs wedding to Charles, paparazzi began documenting her every move. Princess Diana became the most photographed person in the world, with paparazzi offered up to Â£500,000 for even grainy pictures of her (thatâs equivalent to $1.5 million AUD today!). In the competitive fight to snap the most profitable photos of Diana, the paparazzi invaded her most private moments, taking shots of her kissing Dodi Al Fayed while on holidays, and sunbathing topless at her hotel in Spain. Dianaâs despair and requests to be left alone remained unanswered, so when the paparazzi chased her to her death in 1997, theÂ public response was emphatic.\n\nThe public turned against Britain's press and photographers, and the overwhelming outpour of grief is a testament to the injustice the public felt on behalf of Diana. To add insult to injury, the monarchyâs initial reticent response was deemed inadequate, negatively shifting the publicâs attitude or âmoodâ - a term we often hear in the film - towards the royals. The monarchy needs to stay in the publicâs favour, lest the end of the institution.\n\nThatâs whyÂ The QueenÂ is a film about change on several fronts,Â the first dynamic response from the public, The Queen abandoning royal tradition and acquiescing to public demand, and how all this happens within months ofÂ Tony Blairâs new premiership.\n\nWith this, you can understand why change is one of the biggest themes discussed when comparing these two texts. Letâs look at Ransom.\n\nRansomÂ\n\nMoving back a further 3000 years earlier than The Queen,Â Ransom isÂ a retelling the Trojan War, one of the most famous events in Greek mythology. To truly understand random, you must first familiarise yourself with Greek mythology, the Trojan War, and The Iliad. Weâll have a look at these three as if theyâre matryoshka dolls (where dolls of decreasing size are place done inside another):\n\nThe biggest doll: Greek mythology\n\nWeâll start withÂ Greek mythologyÂ since itâs the umbrella knowledge you need to know before understanding the Trojan War andÂ The Iliad. Essentially a collection of stories about gods, heroes and other creatures, Greek mythology was used by ancient Greeks to explain the existence of the world. Without the scientific developments weâve discovered to date, ancient Greeks attempted to explain the creation of the earth, human behaviour, death and love through their mythical stories. Notice how the godsÂ (Iris, Hermes)Â appearÂ whenÂ Priam needs help and advice throughoutÂ Ransom.Â\n\nThe reason why Greek mythology is still prevalent in modern society is that the lessons taught in these stories are still applicable today as they depict universal truths about human qualities such as our strengths and flaws. Without you even realising it, our world today is filled with references to Greek mythology. Take, for example,Â Pandora, (the jewellery company that sells little charms you need to buy separately to make up a bracelet), whose namesake comes from the myth about Pandoraâs box (basically, Pandoraâs unchecked curiosity led her to open a forbidden box, releasing all illnesses and death into the world - side note, could we blame Pandora for COVID-19 then? Just kidding). Or take the firstÂ God of WarÂ game,Â which follows the story of Kratos whose ability to be a loving father is overpowered by his anger and desire for vengeance. Interestingly, the tale of Pandoraâs box also is featured in this game.\n\nLuckily for you though, you donât have to be an expert inÂ allÂ Greek mythology, but you should probably have a good gist of the Trojan War.\n\nThe middle doll: The Trojan War Â\n\nNow we narrow things down toÂ oneÂ of the most legendary Greek myths - the Trojan War.Â This war might be familiar to you because it is the backdrop and context for MaloufâsÂ Ransom.Â\n\nThe myth begins withÂ Zeus, the father of all gods, and his brotherÂ PoseidonÂ lusting after the goddess of water,Â Thetis. However, they are warned byÂ Prometheus, an intelligent mortal - better known for being chained to a rock as a result of stealing Zeusâ fire - that Thetis would give birth to a son who would be mightier than his father. Alarmed at this possibility, the two gods arrange for Thetis to marry Peleus, a mortal. Since humans were believed to be inferior to gods, this ensured that Thetisâ child would be a mere mortal, rendering the prophecy redundant.\n\nAny potential issues appeared resolved until the gods omittedÂ Eris, theÂ goddess of discordÂ from Thetis and Peleusâ wedding invitation list. Furious at this insult, Eris arrives at the wedding with her own plans. She inscribes a golden apple with the words, âTo The Fairestâ and throws it amongst the guests. Naturally, all goddesses want to claim the prize. Eventually, the choice is narrowed down to three of the most beautiful goddesses:Â Aphrodite,Â AthenaÂ andÂ Hera. Unable to reach a decision, they turned to Zeus to judge who should win the title. However, Zeus refuses to do so and instead, elects a mortal with good judgment of beauty to make the choice. This mortal isÂ Paris, Prince of TroyÂ and whose birth produced a prophecy that he would one day bring misfortune to his people and town.\n\nThe three goddesses approach Paris with not only their beauty but also bribes. Hera offers him power and control over Europe and Asia, Athena promises that she will make him a great warrior while Aphrodite proposes to him the most beautiful woman on earth. Since Paris is more interested in women than power and war, he awards Aphrodite with the golden apple. With this exchange sealed, the beginning of Troyâs troubles begin as the most beautiful woman on earth, Helen is already married to Menelaus, king of Sparta.\n\nAfter a diplomatic mission to Sparta, Paris elopes with Helen, who falls in love with Paris upon their first encounter (literature concerning this part of the story remains ambiguous). Upon discovering Parisâ betrayal, Menelaus calls on Helenâs many suitors to invade Troy and retrieve his wife. His brother,Â AgamemnonÂ recruits and leads the Greek army into battle against the city of Troy, and thus begins the Trojan War.\n\nAnd finally, the baby doll: The Iliad\n\nHomerâsÂ The IliadÂ is a poem that begins ten years into the Trojan War. By now, Thetis, the goddess who had married Peleus, has given birth to their mortal sonÂ Achilles, the mightiest of all Greeks, as predicted by the prophecy (Achilles should definitely be familiar to you because heâs the main character in Ransom!). Although he is a fighter for Agamemnon, their relationship is strained after Agamemnon demands that Achilles give up his beloved war prize,Â Briseis. Since Agamemnon desires Briseis for himself, this enrages Achilles to the point where he refuses to fight in the Trojan War. This leads to dire consequences for the Greeks as they lose many men in battle and are forced to retreat to their ships after the Trojans successfully turn the tide of the battle.\n\nConcerned for his Myrmidons (a group of the strongest and skilled warriors who fight for Achilles) yet too proud to budge from his position, Achilles is persuaded to allow his close friend and comrade Patroclus, to wear Achillesâ renowned armour and lead his Myrmidons into battle (ah, weâre starting to see even stronger connections toÂ RansomÂ now). This strategy is designed to rouse fear in the Trojans and cause them to temporarily retreat - enough time to allow the Greeks to rest and recover - as theyâd see âAchillesâ back in battle.\n\nDespite Patroclusâ skills as a soldier, Achilles insists that Patroclus only fight until the Greeks can successfully fend off the Trojans away from their ships. During the fight, however, Patroclus disobeys Achillesâ orders and continues to pursue the Trojans back to their gates. At this point, he encounters and is killed by Hector, the prince of Troy and leader of the Trojan army.\n\nFuelled with rage and grief over Patroclusâ death, Achilles agrees to fight once again for the Greek army, much to Agamemnonâs pleasure. In their next battle, Achilles kills many warriors and the Trojans are forced to retreat back to the safety of their walls. Hector, against the will of his family, faces Achilles alone outside the walls of his home, knowing that Achilles is on a path to avenge Patroclusâs death. In a fierce battle between the two greatest Trojan war warriors, Hector was killed. Achilles takes Hectorâs body with him and dishonours it day after day by chaining it to a chariot and dragging it along the walls of Troy. Malouf begins theÂ RansomÂ story here. The gods agree that this blasphemous behaviour cannot continue and send the god Hermes to guide king Priam, father of Hector to the Greek camp. Once in their camp, Priam falls to his knees and pleads Achilles for the body of his son. Touched by the kingâs words, Achilles relents, allowing Priam to finally hold a proper burial for Hector.\n\nAppreciating the differences betweenÂ The IliadÂ and Ransom storyline will lead to a better understanding of the themes and symbols inÂ Ransom.\n\nOne of the main differences between the two texts is their depiction ofÂ PriamâsÂ journey toÂ Achilles. InÂ The Iliad, this journey is explored only momentarily and focuses more on the presence of Hermes. The inclusion of the new characterÂ SomaxÂ in Ransom also offers a new perspective on this old tale. WhileÂ The IliadÂ only touches upon Achillesâ and Priamâs suffering, Malouf delves into the emotional journey that the characters undergo during the darkest episode in the Trojan War.\n\nThatâs why the themes ofÂ grief,Â lossÂ andÂ deathÂ should be quite prominent in your comparison betweenÂ RansomÂ andÂ The QueenÂ along with the importance ofÂ storiesÂ and storytelling.\n\nIn my new study guideÂ Ransom and The Queen, I show you how you can use your knowledge youâve learned there to write A+ essays.

So previously I've done a video where I talked about how to write a thousand word, a thousand, a thousand-worded essay, and one hour. And so that segues into this particular video where I'm talking about writing three essays in three hours. So if you haven't watched that video, then I'll pop it up in the comment. I'll pop it up in the card up above. I would recommend you go watch that first before you watch this, because pretty much all of the concepts that I talk about in that video, uh, I just expected details that you should know for this video. So instead of actually breaking down the essays as I did in the previous video, what I'm going to do this time is talk more so about, you know, how to actually write three essays in three hours and just not get burnt out and not die, basically.\n\nâ\n\nYeah, it's that serious. So I've got a few tips for you guys, but I'll keep this short. First thing is that yes, you do want to practice at least one time writing three essays in three hours. And the reason why I say that is because inevitably there will come times where one essay will kind of overlap into another hour. And you just want to ensure that you can know how to handle those situations when we're practicing in one hour blocks. I think it's fantastic to make sure that we can do that, but then kind of like three hours and three essays is another ballgame altogether. So I would recommend at least practicing once sitting down somewhere and just smashing out the three hours worth of work, just so that you know exactly what it's going to feel like when you go into the exam. Now, most schools will actually offer a, like a mock exam for you to do so that literally could be your one practice that you just need.\n\nBut if you were like me, you might want to do it twice. So in your own time, kind of print off your own exam paper and go ahead and just set aside three hours and just do it that way. The second thing is I heavily emphasized doing reading time. So reading time is pretty much your mental thinking game going strong. And this is where a lot of your pre-work will be done before we actually go into the essays themselves. So make sure you practice reading time. It's 15 minutes before the actual exam, but in that 15 minutes, you can plan three of your essays and you can look up in your dictionary, any key words that you might want to define, or you could even look up the dictionary and try to find synonyms for particular keywords. So what I mean by that is when you open up a dictionary and you look up that word inside the dictionary, often the definition for it will have synonyms for it.\n\nSo that's like my little hack that I had when I was at school. And then the last thing I would say is just make sure you know what to do if you go over time. So, like I mentioned before, there may be situations where, you know, worst case scenario, you don't finish your essay in time. And that could be because of many reasons. But first thing for you to remember is if you're running over time, sacrifice your conclusion first, do not sacrifice your third body paragraph. I think mostly what happens is students will kind of be somewhere in the third body paragraph for that essay, but rather than skipping that and just do it a little bit of a mess to finish it up and then going into the conclusion, finish off your third body paragraph. And then just forget about the conclusion. The reason why I say that is because a conclusion is basically just the summary of what your entire essay is about.\n\nIt's not really supposed to be, to add in any new information where as your third body paragraph. You're still explaining your ideas. You're still elaborating and discussing the prompt itself. So that is way more important to get you the marks that you need than a conclusion. The next thing I would do if you're running behind is save a proofreading until very last. So in the last video I talked about doing proofreading last five minutes of every essay. But if you do not have time for that later, leave all your proofreading until the very end and, and you might find that you only have five minutes, it's true proofread all of your essays, but at least you kind of have that reassurance was that you made yourself more time to write beforehand. And so if you literally find yourself writing right up until the last minute and you can't perforate fine sacrifice that too.\n\nâ\n\nNow last thing is, let's just say that you have sacrificed your conclusion and you're still writing your third body paragraph right up until the very last minute. You still have at least half a paragraph to go, but you know, the first hour is over and you need to move onto your second essay. I feel like you can either approach this two ways. The first way is just finish it off, but then move on to the next one as quick as possible. And obviously your hope there is that you will finish the second essay in time within that hour. So that by the time you get to your thing, essay, you are on track again. Right? But in the other alternative that you could do, and probably one that I via towards a little bit more is just stop your third paragraph. Okay? You still have maybe five more sentences you still want to write, but just move onto your next one. I think that's kind of important because what happens is once we start running into the next hour, you will find that with your first essay, you'll run maybe five minutes into your second hour, but then you might find that you run 10 minutes into the third hour with your second essay leaving only 15 minutes to finish your third essay. And that might not be like what you want. And you might know that you just won't be able to achieve that because the third essay is maybe the hardest one that you left to last. And that's the one that usually takes you the longest. So yeah, like these are just thoughts and considerations for you guys to take away with whatever you guys do. I think just be strategic. Think about these things beforehand, because they are things that could trip you up when you are in the exam, you're stressed, you're anxious, you're under time pressure and you just need to get things done.\n\nIt might kind of make you do like bad decisions or you might do something out of the ordinary that you normally wouldn't do. But if you think about these things beforehand and think about, okay, this is what I'm going to do. If this situation occurs, then at least you kind of have some control over what's happening. And that gives you a little bit of reassurance. That is it from me. I wanted to let you guys know that because we are approaching the end of year. And I know that you guys might not need English help from me very shortly, especially when you're in year 12. I wanted to let you guys know that I do have a personal YouTube channel as well. So that's just linked up above for you. And also in the description box below. If you're interested in following me there, then go ahead and subscribe. I would really love to see you guys there and just be able to still have the connection with you guys. You know, it'd be nice to not only just have you guys on board with me for a year, and then you guys kind of disappear and do your own thing, I'd still really love to stay in contact and be able to hear how you guys are going to once you finish school. So I will see you guys next time. Bye!\n\nContents\n\n1. Summary\n\n2. Characters\n\n3. Themes\n\n4. Symbols\n\n5. Sample Essay Topics\n\n6.

Maybe an alien invasion, Pacific Rim style monsters perhaps, and almost always the mad scramble of a protagonist to stockpile resources and protect their loved ones from the imminent chaos and destructionâthese are tropes which are tried and tested in this genre.\n\nWhat mightnât come to mind as immediately is a story about a travelling Shakespeare troupe wandering the North American continent decades after the actual apocalypse has struck, which is exactly the story that Mandel tells in Station Eleven.\n\nWhile post-apocalyptic tales tend to focus on the action around the impact of a fictional disaster, Mandelâs novel speaks to the attitudes and characteristics of people which drive any action that occurs. She interrogates central questions about human society, inviting readers to consider what human qualities can endure even an apocalypse, what qualities are timeless.\n\nCharacters\n\nA tale of two timelines: part one\n\nââ¦once weâre seen, thatâs not enough anymore. After that, we want to be remembered.â\n\nPart of the novelâs ambition is that while itâs set 20 years after the apocalyptic Georgia Flu, it constantly reaches decades into the past to search for meaning. In particular, the novelâs central character is Arthur Leander, an actor whose death coincides with the breakout of the Flu. Tracing his origins from obscurity to fame, Mandel juxtaposes his philandering and untrustworthy behaviour with repeated attempts to be a better person, or perhaps just be more true to himself, before his death. Weâll eventually see that many of his actions have consequences years into the future.\n\nArguably equally important in legacy is his first wife, Miranda Carroll, whose comics lend the novel its title. Take this with a grain of saltâsheâs kind of my favourite characterâbut the time and energy she invests in the Station Eleven comics are arguably the most valuable investment of the novel. Her comics survive her in the years following the Flu, and are a source of escape and purpose for others just as they had been for herself.\n\nBoth of these characters come into contact with Jeevan Chaudhary, a paparazzo and journalist who regularly follows Arthur though his career, photographing Miranda in a vulnerable moment before her divorce, and booking an interview with Arthur years later as he plans to leave his second wife Elizabeth Colton. We see Jeevan struggle with his purpose in life throughout the novel, though it can be said that he ultimately finds it after the Flu, when he is working as a medic.\n\nFinally, thereâs Clark Thompson, Arthurâs friend from college who remains loyal, though not necessarily uncritical, of him all throughout his life. As the Flu first arrives in America, Clark is just leaving for Toronto, but a Flu outbreak there causes his flight to be redirected to Severn City Airport, where he and others miraculously survive in what will become a key setting of the novel.\n\nA tale of two timelines: part two\n\nââI stood looking over my damaged home and tried to forget the sweetness of life on Earth.â\n\nAll of this finally puts us in a position to think analytically about characters in the âpresentâ timeline, that is, 20 years after the Flu. We experience the present mostly through the perspective of Kirsten Raymonde, a performer who survived the Flu as a young child. Because she was so young when it happened, many of the traumas she experienced have been erased by her mind, and she struggles to piece together what she lost in a quest for identity and meaning, largely driven by her vague memories of Arthur. She travels with the Travelling Symphony with others such as Alexandra, August and the conductorâthey have collectively adopted the motto, âsurvival is insufficient.â\n\nThrough the story, they are pursued by the prophet, later revealed to be Tyler Leander, the child of Arthur and Elizabeth who survived and grew up in the decades following the Flu outbreak. A religious extremist, he becomes the leader of a cult of fanatics who amass weapons and conquer towns by force. Both Kirsten and Tyler pursue the Station Eleven comics, quoted aboveâthey each possess a copy, and resonate strongly with the struggles of the characters created by Miranda.\n\n(CW: suicide) Also important is Jeevanâs brother, Frank, a paraplegic author who was writing about a philanthropist in the last days before his death, whereby he kills himself so as to give his brother a better chance of surviving. While he isnât a particularly major character, his writing on morality and mortality (quoted with the first batch of characters) are symbolically and thematically important.\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nâ\n\nThemes\n\nPart 1\n\nâThatâs what passes for a lifeâ¦thatâs what passes for happiness, for most peopleâ¦theyâre like sleepwalkersâ¦â\n\nThese characters already speak to some of the major themes that formulate the novel. On one hand, Mandel explores various meanings of contemporary or modern civilisation. We live in a technology-driven age where constraints of time and space mean less than ever before. For example, people are mobile through space thanks to airplanes and telephones, and the internet means that any and all information is available to anyone, all the time. Mandel constantly looks back at this society and describes it in terms of our technology: for example, âthe era when it was possible to press a series of buttons on a telephone and speak with someone on the far side of the earth.â On one level, she comments on how many of these minor miracles are taken for granted in our every day lives.\n\nOn another level, these elements of society also give rise to the culture of celebrity in our lives, as high-profile figures are put under increasing pressure to maintain appearances at all times, and lead increasingly âperfectâ lives as a result. These were pressures that Arthur struggled to live up to, and his âfailed marriagesâ accompanied his career at all stages. The flip side of this is that people who follow celebrities, such as Jeevan, lead increasingly emptier and more vacuous livesâand Jeevan is well-aware of this, telling Miranda that he doesnât seek a greater purpose in life beyond making money. This lack of purpose, this ennui, is something that tints much of society through the eyes of Mandel.\n\nAnother major theme which the lives of these characters start to explore is the value of art as a source of purpose. While civilisation is portrayed as fragile and meaningless, artâin all its forms, including creating, reproducing, performing and consumingâis a way for people such as Miranda to understand, process and escape their lives. This theme is arguably the most important, as it tethers different parts of the novel together; even after the apocalypse, people turn to art as a way of understanding and connecting to others as well as to themselves.\n\nPart 2\n\nââThe more you remember, the more youâve lost.â\n\nInevitably with this genre, survival and mortality are major themes, as massive populations of people have died and continue to die due to the impacts of the Georgia Flu. To some extent, survivorâs guilt motivates many to search for a deeper meaning to their survival, hence the motto of the Symphony. It also drives them to turn to art as weâve explored, since bare subsistence isnât enough to give their lives the meaning they desire. Maybe this is what it means to be human.\n\nOn the other hand, the Flu also turns others to religious extremity, as is the case with Elizabeth, Tyler and the rest of their cult. This speaks to broader ideas about faith, fate and spiritualityâare there greater forces out there who manipulate events in our world? Certainly, there are enough coincidences in the novel for this theory to be valid; even just Kirsten and Tyler both having copies of Station Eleven and both acting under the influence of Arthur is so coincidental.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most important theme here is memory. Mandel ultimately puts this as the central question to readers: is memory more of a blessing or a burden? Is it preferable to remember everything youâve lost, or be ignorant of it all? Iâm not sure she really answers this one, to be honest. Various symbolsâand even the constantly shifting narrative perspectiveâevoke the epic sense of loss in the apocalypse, and yet encountering characters like Alexandra, who never really knew what the internet was, makes you rethink that loss; perhaps it is better to have experienced the internet at all.\n\nSymbols\n\nââPeople want what was best about the worldâ\n\nThereâs a category of symbols in the novel that represent memories of technology. Consider the discarded phones and credit cards in the Museum of Civilisations, all mementos of wh"
