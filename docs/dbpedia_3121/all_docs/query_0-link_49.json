        "text": "2 Enoch [Longer recension, ms. J]\n\n(tr. F. Andersen)\n\n1a The story of Enoch: how the Lord took him to heaven\n\n|There was| a wise man and a great artisan whom the LORD took away.\n\nAnd he loved him so that he might see the highest realms;\n\nand of the most wise and great and inconceivable and unchanging\n\nkingdom of God almighty, and of the most marvelous and glorious and shining and many-eyed station of the LORDs servants, and of the LORDs immovable throne,\n\n and of the ranks and organization of the bodiless armies, and of the indescribable composition of the multitude of elements,\n\n singing of the army of the cherubim, and of the light without measure, to be an eyewitness.\n\n1 |Concerning Enochs dream|\n\nAt that time he said, When 165 years were complete for me, I fathered my son Methusala; and after that I lived 200 years.\n\nI completed all the years of my life, 365 years. In the first month, on the assigned day of the first month, I was in my house alone.\n\nAnd I lay on my bad sleeping. And, while I slept, a great distress entered my heart, and I was weeping with my eyes in a dream. And I could not figure out what this distress might be, |nor| what might be\n\nhappening to me. Then two huge men appeared to me, the like of which I had never seen on earth.\n\nTheir faces were like the shining sun;\n\ntheir eyes were like burning lamps;\n\nfrom their mouths fire was coming forth;\n\ntheir clothing was various singing;\n\ntheir wings were more glistening than gold;\n\ntheir hands were whiter than snow.\n\nAnd they stood at the head of my bed and called me by my name.\n\nThen I awake from my sleep, and saw those men, standing in front of me, in actuality.\n\nThen I bowed down to them; and I was terrified; and the appearance of my face was changed because of fear. Then those men said to me, Be brave, Enoch! In truth, do not fear! The eternal God has sent us to you. And behold, you will ascend with us to heaven today. And tell your sons 〈|and all the members of your household,|〉 everything that they must do in your house while they are without you on the earth. And let no one search for you until the LORD returns you to them. And I hurried and obeyed them; and I went out of my house and I shut the doors as I had been ordered. And I called my sons, Methusalam and Regim and Gaidad. And I declared to them all the marvels that those men had told me.\n\n2 |The instruction. How Enoch instructs his sons. 1.|\n\nListen, my children! I do not know where I am going,\n\nnor what will confront me. Now, my children, |I say to you|:\n\nDo not turn away from God.\n\nWalk before his face,\n\nand keep his commandments.\n\nDo not abhor the prayers of your salvation,\n\nso that the LORD will not curtail the work of your hands.\n\nAnd do not be ungenerous with the LORDs gifts, and the LORD will not be ungenerous with his donations and love-gifts in your storehouses.\n\nAnd bless the LORD with the firstborn of your herds and the firstborn of your children, and the blessing will be on you forever.\n\nAnd do not turn away from the LORD, and do not worship vain gods, gods who did not created the heaven and the earth or any other created thing; for they will perish, and so will those who worship them.\n\nAnd may God make your hearts true in reverence for him.\n\nAnd now, my children, no one must search for me until the LORD returns me to you.\n\n3 |About the taking away of Enoch; how the angels took him on the 1st heaven. 2.|\n\nAnd it came about, when I had spoken to my sons, those med called me. And they took me up onto their wings, and carried me up to the first heaven, and placed me on the clouds. And, behold, they were moving. And there I perceived the air higher up, and higher still I saw the ether. And they placed me on the first heaven. And they showed me a vast ocean, much bigger than the earthly ocean.\n\n4 |About the angels who govern the stars. 3.|\n\nThey led before my face the elders, the rulers of the stellar orders.\n\nAnd they showed me the 200 angels who govern the stars and the heavenly combinations. And they fly with their wings, and do the rounds of all the planets.\n\n5 |About how the angels guard the storehouses of the snow. Word 4.|\n\nAnd there I perceived the treasuries of the snow and the ice, and the angels who guard their terrible storehouses, \n\nand the treasury of the clouds, from which they come out and go in.\n\n6 |About the dew and about olive oil and various flowers. Word 5.|\n\nAnd they showed me the treasuries of the dew, like olive oil.\n\nAnd the appearance of its image was like every kind of earthly flower , only more numerous; and the angels who guard their treasuries, how they are shut and opened.\n\n7 |About how Enoch was taken to the 2nd heaven. Word 6.|\n\nAnd those men picked me up and brought me up to the second heaven. And they showed me, and I saw a darkness greater than earthly darkness. And there I perceived prisoners under guard, hanging up, waiting for the measureless judgment. And those angels have the appearance of darkness itself, more than earthly darkness. And unceasingly they made weeping, all the day long. And I said to the men who were with me, Why are these ones being tormented unceasingly? Those men answered me, These are those who turned away from the LORD, who did not obey the LORDs commandments, but of their own will plotted together and turned away with their prince and with those who are under restraint in the fifth heaven. And I felt very sorry for them; and those angels bowed down to me and said to me, Man of God, pray for us to the LORD!\n\nAnd I answered them and said, Who am I, a mortal man, that I should pray for angels? Who knows where I am going and what will confront me? Or who indeed will pray for me?\n\n8 |About the taking of Enoch to the 3rd heaven. Word 7.|\n\nAnd those men took me from there, and they brought me up to the third heaven, and set me down |there|. Then I looked downward, and I saw Paradise. And that place is inconceivably pleasant.\n\nAnd I saw the trees in full flower. And their fruits were ripe and pleasant-smelling, with every food in yield and giving off profusely a pleasant fragrance.\n\nAnd in the midst (of them was) the tree of life, at that place where the LORD takes a rest when he goes into paradise. And that tree is indescribable for pleasantness and fine fragrance, and more beautiful than any (other)\n\ncreated thing that exists. And from every direction it has an appearance which is good-looking and crimson, and with the form of fire. And it covers the whole of Paradise. And it has something of every orchard tree and of every fruit. And its root is in Paradise at the exit that leads to the earth.\n\nAnd paradise is in between the corruptible and the incorruptible. And two streams come forth, one a source of honey and milk, and a source which produces oil and wine. And it is divided into 4 parts, and they go around with a quiet movement. And they come out into the paradise of Edem, between the corruptible and the incorruptible. And from there they pass along and divide into 40 parts. And it proceeds in descent along the earth, and they have a revolution in their cycle, just like the other atmospheric elements.\n\nAnd there is no unfruitful tree there, and every tree is well fruited, and every place is blessed.\n\nAnd there are 300 angels, very bright, who look after Paradise; and with never-ceasing voice and pleasant singing they worship the LORD every day and hour. And I said, How very pleasant is this place! And those men said to me:\n\n9 |The revelation to Enoch of the place of those who are righteous and kind. Word 8.|\n\nThis place, Enoch, has been prepared for the righteous,\n\nwho suffer every kind of calamity in their life\n\nand who afflict their souls,\n\nand who avert their eyes from injustice,\n\nand who carry out righteous judgment,\n\nand who give bread to the hungry,\n\nand who cover the naked with clothing,\n\nand who lift up the fallen\n\nand who help the injured and the orphans,\n\nand who walk without a defect before the face of the LORD,\n\nand who worship him only \n\neven for them this place has been prepared as an eternal inheritance.\n\n10 |Here they showed Enoch the frightful place and various tortures. Word 9.|\n\nAnd those men carried me\n\nto the northern region; and they showed me there a very frightful place;\n\nand all kinds of torture and torment are in that place, cruel darkness and lightless gloom. And there is no light there, and a black fire blazes up perpetually, with a river of fire that comes out over the whole place, fire here, freezing ice there, and it dries up and it freezes;\n\nand very cruel places of detention and dark and merciless angels, carrying instruments of atrocities torturing without pity.\n\nAnd I said, Woe, woe! How very frightful this place is! And those men said to me, This place, Enoch, has been prepared for those who do not glorify God, who practice on the earth the sin |which is against nature, which is child corruption in the anus in the manner of Sodom|, of witchcraft, enchantments, divinations, trafficking with demons, who boast about their evil deeds  |stealing, lying, insulting, coveting, resentment, fornication, murder|  and who steal the souls of men secretly, seizing the poor by the throat,\n\ntaking away their possessions,\n\nenriching themselves from the possessions of others, defrauding them; who, when they are able to provide sustenance, bring about the death of the hungry by starvation; and, when they are able to provide clothing, take away the last garment of the naked; who do not acknowledge their Creator, but bow down to idols which have no souls, which can neither see nor hear, vain gods; constructing images, and bowing down to vile things made by hands  for all these this place has been prepared as an eternal reward.\n\n11 |Here they took Enoch to the 4th heaven, where the solar and lunar tracks are. Word 10.|\n\nAnd those men took me and they carried me up to the fourth heaven. And they showed me there all the movements and sequences, and all the rays of solar and lunar light. And I measured their movements and I compared their light. And I saw that the sun has a light seven times greater than the moon. And I saw his circle and his wheels on which he always goes, going past always like the wind with quite marvelous speed. And his coming and his return give him no rest, day and night.\n\nAnd 4 great stars, each star having 1000 stars under it, on the right hand side of the suns chariot, and 4 on the left-hand side, each one having 1000 stars under it, all together 8000, going with the sun perpetually.\n\nAnd 150,000 |angels| accompany him in the daytime, and at night 1000. And |100| angels go in front of the suns chariot, six-winged, in flaming fire;\n\nand the sun blazes up and sets the 100 angels on fire.\n\n12 |About the very wonderful solar elements. Word 11.|\n\nAnd |I looked and saw| flying spirits, the solar elements, called phoenixes and khalkedras, strange and wonderful. For their form was that of a lion, their tail that of a , and their head that of a crocodile. Their appearance was multicolored, like a rainbow. Their size was 900 measures. Their wings were those of angels, but they have 12 wings each. They accompany and run with the sun, carrying heat and dew, 〈and 〉 whatever is commanded |them| from God.\n\nThus he goes through a cycle, and he goes down and he rises up across the sky and beneath the earth with the light of his rays. And he was there, on the track, unceasingly.\n\n13 |The angels picked Enoch up and set him down in the East, at the solar gates. Word 12.|\n\nAnd those men carried me away to the east 〈of that heaven〉.\n\n〈|And they showed me|〉 the solar gates through which the sun comes out according to the appointment of the seasons and according to the phases of the moon, for the entire year, and according to\n\nthe numbers on the horologe, day and night. And I saw 6 open gates, each gate having 61 stadia and a quarter of a stadium. And I measured carefully and I figured out their size to be so much  through which the sun comes out and goes off to the west.\n\nAnd it becomes even and goes through all the months.\n\n〈And the 1st gate he comes out for 42 days,\n\nthe second 35 days,\n\nthe third 35 days,\n\nthe fourth 35 days,\n\nthe fifth 35 days,\n\nthe sixth 42 days.〉\n\nAnd then once more he does an about-turn and goes back the other way from the sixth gate, according to the round of the seasons:\n\n〈And he goes in through the fifth gate 35 days,\n\nthe 4th 35 days,\n\nthe 3rd 35 days,\n\nthe second 35 days〉.\n\nAnd so 〈the days of 〉 the whole year are completed, according to the cycle of the four seasons.\n\n14 |They carried Enoch to the west. Word 13.|\n\nAnd then those men carried me away to the west of the heaven, and they showed me six large open gates, corresponding to the circuit of the eastern gates, opposite them, where the sun sets according to the number of the days, 365 and ¼.\n\nThus he goes back once again to the eastern gates, under the earth. 〈And when he goes out from the western gates〉, he takes off his light, the splendor which is his radiance, 〈and four hundred angels take his crown and carry it to the LORD〉. For, since his shining crown is with God, with 400 angels guarding it, the sun 〈turns his chariot around〉 and goes back under the earth on wheels, without the great light which is his great radiance and ornament. |And he remains| for seven great hours in night. And the chariot spends half its time under the earth. And when he comes to the eastern approaches, in the 8th hour of the night, 〈the angels, the 4 hundred angels, bring back the crown, and crown him〉. And his brightness and the shining of his crown are seen before sunrise. And the sun blazes out more than fire does.\n\n15 |The solar elements, the phoenixes and the khalkedras, burst into song.|\n\nAnd then the solar elements, called phoenixes and khalkedras, burst into song. That is why every bird flaps its wings, rejoicing at the giver of light. And they burst into song at the LORDs command:\n\nThe light-giver is coming,\n\nto give radiance to the whole world;\n\nand the morning watch appears,\n\nwhich is the suns rays.\n\nAnd the sun comes out over the face of the earth,\n\nand retrieves his radiance,\n\nto give light to all the face of the earth.\n\nAnd they showed me this calculation of the suns movement, and the gates by which he goes in and goes out; for these are the great gates which God created to be an annual horologe.\n\nThis is why the sun has the greater heat; and the cycle for him goes on for 28 years, and begins once more from the start.\n\n16 |They picked Enoch up and placed him once more in the east at the orbit of the moon. Word 15.|\n\nAnd another calculation those men showed me, that of the moon, and all the movements and phases;\n\n〈and 〉 12 big gates, crowned from the west to the east, through which the moon goes in and goes out, in accordance with the regular seasons.\n\nShe goes in by the first western gate, in the place of the sun \n\nby the 1st gate for 31 days exactly,\n\nthe 2nd for 35 days exactly,\n\nthe 3rd for 30 days exactly,\n\nthe 4th for 30 days exactly,\n\n〈|the 5th for 31 days|〉 〈extraordinarily〉 / |exactly|,\n\n〈|the 6th for 31 days exactly|〉 ,\n\nthe 7th for 30 days exactly,\n\nthe 8th for 31 days exactly,\n\nthe 9th for 31 |35| days 〈accurately〉,\n\nthe 10th for 30 days exactly,\n\nthe 11th for 31 days exactly,\n\nthe 12th for 22 |28| days exactly.\n\nThus likewise by the western gates in accordance with the cycle, and in accordance with the number of the eastern gates.\n\nAnd thus she goes, and completes the solar year 365 and ½ of one day.\n\nBut the lunar year has 354, making 12 months, 〈calculated〉 in accordance with 29 days. And it lacks 12 days of the solar cycle, which are the lunar epacts for each year. Also, the great cycle contains 532 years.\n\nIt passes by the quarters for three years, and the fourth completes it exactly. For this reason they are taken away, outside heaven, for three years; and they are not added to the number of the days, because these ones change the seasons of the year  two new moons in augmentation,\n\ntwo others in diminution. And when the western gates are completed, she turns around and goes to the eastern ones with 〈her〉 light. Thus she goes, day and night, in accordance with the heavenly cycles, lower than all the cycles, swifter than the heavenly winds, and spirits and elements and flying angels, with 6 wings to each angel. And the moon has a sevenfold intercalation, and a period of revolution of 19 years. And she begins once again from the start.\n\n17 |About the angelic songs which it is not possible to describe. Word 16.|\n\nIn the middle of the heaven I saw armed troops, worshiping the LORD with tympani and pipes and unceasing voices, and pleasant |voices and pleasant and unceasing| and various songs, which it is impossible to describe. And every mind would be quite astonished, so marvelous and wonderful is the singing of these angels. And I was delighted, listening to them.\n\n18 |About the taking of Enoch to the fifth heaven. Word 17.|\n\nAnd those men took me up on their wings and placed me on the fifth heaven. And I saw there many innumerable armies called Grigori. And their appearance was like the appearance of a human being, and their size was larger than that of large giants. And their faces were dejected, and the silence of their mouths was perpetual. And there was no liturgy in the fifth heaven. 〈|And I said to the men who were with me, What is the explanation that these ones are so very dejected, and their faces miserable, and their mouths silent? And (why) is there no liturgy in this heaven?|〉 And those men answered me, These are the Grigori, who turned aside from the LORD, 200 myriads, together with their prince Satanail. And similar to them are those who went down as prisoners in their train, who are in the second heaven, imprisoned in great darkness.\n\nAnd three of them descended to the earth from the LORDs Throne onto the place Ermon. And they broke the promise on the shoulder of Mount Ermon. And they saw the daughters of men, how beautiful they were; and they took wives for themselves, and the earth was defiled by their deeds.\n\nWho 〈and the wives of men created great evil〉 in the entire time of this age acted lawlessly and practiced miscegenation and gave birth to giants and great monsters and great enmity.\n\nAnd that is why God has judged them with a great judgment; and they mourn their brothers, and they will be outrages on the great day of the LORD. And I said to the Grigori, I have seen your brothers and their deeds and their torments 〈and〉 their great 〈prayers〉; and I have prayed for them. But the LORD has sentenced them under the earth until heaven and earth are ended forever. And I said, Why are you waiting for your brothers? And why dont you perform the liturgy before the face of the LORD? Start up your liturgy, and perform the liturgy before the face of the LORD, so that you do not enrage your LORD 〈God〉 to the limit.\n\nAnd they responded to my recommendations, and they stood in four regiments in this heaven. And behold, while I was standing with those men, 4 trumpets trumpeted in unison with a great sound, and the Grigori burst into singing in unison. And their voice rose in front of the face of the LORD, piteously and touchingly.\n\n19 |About the taking of Enoch to the 6th heaven. Word 18.|\n\nAnd those men took me from there, and they carried me up to the 6th heaven. And I saw there 7 groups of angels, brilliant and very glorious. And their faces were more radiant than the radiance of the sun, and there was no difference between their faces or in their dimensions of in the style of their clothing.\n\nAnd these groups carry out and carefully study the movements of the stars, and the revolution of the sun and the phases of the moon, and the well-being of the cosmos.\n\nAnd when they see any evil activity, they put the commandments and instructions in order, and the sweet choral singing and every kind of glorious praise. These are the archangels who are over the angels; and they harmonize all existence, heavenly and earthly;\n\nand angels who are over seasons and years, and angels who are over rivers and the ocean, and angels who are over the fruits of the earth and over every kind of grass, and who give every kind of food to every kind of living thing;\n\nand angels who record all human souls, and all their deeds, and their lives before the face of the LORD.\n\nAnd in the midst of them are 7 phoenixes and 7 cherubim and 7 six-winged beings, having but one voice and singing in unison. And their song is not to be reported; and the LORD is delighted by his footstool.\n\n20 |From there they took Enoch into the 7th heaven. Word 19.|\n\nAnd those men lifted me up from there, and they carried me up to the 7th heaven. And I saw there an exceptionally great light, and all the fiery armies of the great archangels, and the incorporeal forces and the dominions and the origins and the authorities, the cherubim and the seraphim and the many-eyed thrones; (and) 5 {9|P|, 10〈R〉} regiments and the shining otanim stations. And I was terrified, and I trembled with a great fear.\n\nAnd those men picked me up and led me into their 〈midst〉. And they said to me, Be brave, Enoch! Dont be frightened!\n\nAnd they showed (me) the LORD, from a distance, sitting on his exceedingly high throne. For what |is on the 10th heaven, since the LORD is present there? And on the 10th heaven| is God, and it is called in the Hebrew language Aravoth. And all the heavenly armies came and stood on the ten steps, corresponding to their ranks, and they did obeisance to the LORD.\n\nAnd then they went to their places in joy and merriment and in immeasurable light, singing songs with soft and gentle voices, while presenting the liturgy to him gloriously.\n\n21 |About how here the angels left Enoch at the edge of the 7th heaven, and departed from him invisibly. Word 20.|\n\nAnd they do not leave by night, nor depart by day, standing in front of the face of the LORD, and carrying out his will  cherubim and seraphim standing all around his throne, six-winged and many-eyed; |and| they cover his entire throne, singing with gentle voice, in front of the face of the LORD.\n\nHoly, Holy, Holy, LORD |Lord| Sabaoth,\n\nHeaven and earth are full of his glory.\n\nAnd when I had seen all these things, those men said to me, Enoch, up to this point we have been commanded to travel with you. And the men went away from me, and from then on I did not see them anymore. But I, I remained alone at the edge of the seventh heaven. And I became terrified; and I fell on my face, and I said in myself, Woe to me! What has happened to me?\n\nAnd the LORD sent one of his glorious ones, the Archangel Gabriel. And he said to me, Be brave, Enoch! Dont be frightened! Stand up, and come with me and stand in front of the face of the LORD forever.\n\nAnd I answered him and said, Woe to me, my LORD! My soul has departed from me from fear and horror. And call 〈to me〉 the two men who brought me to this place, because I have put my confidence in them, and with them I will go before the face of the LORD. 〈|And Gabriel carried me up, like a leaf carried up by the wind.| He moved me along〉 and put me down in front of the face of the LORD. And I saw the eighth heaven, which is called in the Hebrew language Muzaloth, the changer of the seasons, of dry and of wet, and the 12 zodiacs, which are above the seventh heaven. And I saw the ninth heaven, which in the Hebrew language is called Kukhavim, where the heavenly houses of the 12 zodiacs are.\n\n22 |In the 10th heaven the archangel Michael brought Enoch in front of the face of the LORD. Word 21.|\n\nAnd on the 10th heaven, Aravoth, I saw the view of the face of the LORD, like iron made burning hot in a fire |and| brought out, and it emits sparks and is incandescent. Thus even I saw the face of the LORD. But the face of the LORD is not to be talked about, it is so very marvelous and supremely awesome and supremely frightening. |And| who am I to give an account of the incomprehensible being of the LORD, and of his face, so extremely strange and indescribable? And how many are his commands, and his multiple voice, and the LORDs throne, supremely great and not made by hands, and the choir stalls all around him, the cherubim and the seraphim armies, and their never-silent singing.\n\nWho can give an account of his beautiful appearance, never changing\n\nand indescribable, and his great glory? And I fell down flat and did\n\nobeisance to the LORD. And the LORD, with his own mouth, said to me, Be brave, Enoch! Dont be frightened! Stand up, and stand in front of my face forever. And Michael, the LORDs archistratig, lifted me up and brought me in front of the face of the LORD. And the LORD said to his servants, sounding them out, Let Enoch join in and stand in front of my face forever! And the LORDs glorious ones did obeisance and said, Let Enoch yield in accordance with your word, O LORD!\n\nAnd the LORD said to Michael, Go, and extract Enoch from |his| earthly clothing. And anoint him with my delightful oil, and put him into the clothes of my glory. And so Michael did, just as the LORD had said to him. He anointed me and clothed me. And the appearance of that oil is greater than the greatest light, and its ointment is like sweet dew, and its fragrance myrrh;\n\nand it is like the rays of the glittering sun. And I looked at myself, and I had become like one of his glorious ones, and there was no observable difference. And the LORD summoned one of his archangels, Vrevoil by name, who was swifter in wisdom than the other archangels,\n\nand who records all the LORDs deeds. And the LORD said to Vrevoil, Bring out the books from my storehouses, and fetch a pen for speed-writing, and give it to Enoch and read him the books. 〈And Vrevoil hurried and brought me the books,〉 a knife(?), and ink(?). And he gave me the pen for speed writing from his hand.\n\n23 |About Enochs writing; how he wrote about his marvelous travels and what the heavens look like. And he himself wrote 360 and 6 books. Word 22.|\n\nAnd he was telling me all the things of heaven and earth and sea and all the elements and the movements and their courses, and the living thunder, the sun and the moon and the stars, their courses and their changes, and seasons and years and days and hours, and\n\nthe coming of the clouds and the blowing of the winds, and the number of the angels and the songs of the armed troops;\n\nand every kind of human thing, and every kind of language (and) singing, and human life and rules and instructions and sweet voiced singing, and everything that it is appropriate to learn.\n\nAnd Vrevoil instructed me for 30 days and 30 nights, and his mouth never stopped speaking. And, as for me, I did not rest, writing all the symbols and all the creatures. And when I had finished 30 days and 30 nights, Vrevoil said to me, These things, whatever I have taught you, whatever you have learned, and whatever we have written down, you sit down |and| write  all the souls of men, whatever of them are not yet born, and their places, prepared for eternity.\n\nFor all the souls are prepared for eternity, before the composition\n\nof the earth. And I sat down for a second period of 30 days and 30 nights, and I wrote everything accurately. And I wrote 366 books.\n\n24 |About the great secrets of God, which God revealed and related to Enoch; and he spoke with him face to face. Word 23.|\n\nAnd the Lord called me; and he said to me, Enoch, sit to the left of me with Gabriel. And I did obeisance to the LORD.\n\nAnd the LORD spoke to me: Enoch |Beloved|, whatever you see and whatever things are standing still or moving about were brought to perfection by me. And I myself will explain it to you.\n\nBefore anything existed at all, from the very beginning, whatever exists I created from the non-existent, and from the invisible the visible.\n\n|Listen, Enoch, and pay attention to these words of mine!| For not even to my angels have I explained my secrets, nor related to them their origin, nor my endlessness 〈and inconceivableness〉, as I devise the creatures,\n\nas I am making them known to you today. For, before any visible things had come into existence,\n\nI, the ONE, moved around in the invisible things, like the sun,\n\nfrom east to west and from west to east.\n\nBut the sun has rest in himself; yet I did not find rest, because everything was not yet created. And I thought up the idea of establishing a foundation, to create a visible creation.\n\n25 |God explains to Enoch how the visible and the invisible come down from the very lowest darkness. Word 24.|\n\nAnd I commanded the lowest things: Let one of the invisible things descend visibly! And Adoil descended, extremely large. And I looked at him, and, behold, in his belly he had a great light. And I said to him, Disintegrate yourself, Adoil, and let what is born from you become visible. And he disintegrated himself, and there came out a very\n\ngreat light. And I was in the midst of the |great| light. And light out of light is carried thus. And the great age came out, and it revealed all the creation which I had thought up to create. And I saw how good it was.\n\nAnd I placed for myself a throne, and I sat down on it. And then to the light I spoke: You go up higher 〈than the throne〉, and be solidified |much higher than the throne|, and become the foundation for the highest things.\n\nAnd there is nothing higher than the light, except nothing itself. And again I bowed(?) myself, and I looked upward from my throne.\n\n26 |God summons from the very lowest things a second time, so that Arkhas, both heavy and red, should come out. Word 25.|\n\nAnd I called out a second time into the very lowest things, and I said, Let one of the (in)visible things come out visibly, solid.\n\n|And| Arkhas came out, solid and heavy and very red. And I said, Open yourself up, Arkhas, and let what is born from you become visible! And he disintegrated himself. There came out an age, dark, very large, carrying the creation of all lower things. And I saw how good it was.\n\nAnd I said to him, Come down low and become solid! And become the foundation of the lowest things! |And it came about.| And he came down and became solid. And he became the foundation of the lowest things. And there is nothing lower than the darkness, except nothing itself.\n\n27. |About how God founded the water, and surrounded it with light, and established on it seven islands. Word 26.|\n\nAnd I gave the command: Let there be taken some of the light and\n\nsome of the darkness. And I said, Become thickened, and be wrapped around with light! And I spread it out, and it became water. And I\n\nspread it out above the darkness, below the light. And thus I made the solid waters, that is to say, the Bottomless. And I made a foundation of light around the water. And I created seven great circles inside it, and I gave them an appearance of crystal, wet and dry, that is to say glass and ice, and to be the circuit for water and the other elements. And I pointed out to each one |of them| his route, to the seven stars, each one of them in his own heaven, so that they might travel accordingly.\n\nAnd I saw how good it was. And I made a division between the light and between the darkness, that is to say, in the middle of the waters, this way and that way. And I said to the light that it should be day, and to the darkness 〈I commanded〉 that it should be night. And evening came, and 〈again〉 morning came, 〈that is〉 the first day.\n\n28 |The week in which God showed Enoch all his wisdom and strength, throughout all of the seven days; how he created all the forces of heaven and earth, and every kind of thing that moves itself, even up to man.|\n\nAnd thus I made solid the heavenly circles. And 〈I said〉, Let the lower water, which is below heaven, collect itself 〈|into|〉 one collection, and let its waves become dry. And it happened like that.\n\nAnd from the waves I created rocks, solid and big. And from the rocks I assembled the dry land; and I called the dry land Earth.\n\nAnd what was in the middle of the earth I called chasm, that is to\n\nSay, Bottomless. The sea I gathered into one place, and I bound it with a yoke. And I said to the sea: Behold, I give you an eternal boundary. And you will not break through from your own waters. And so I fixed the solid structure and established it above the waters.\n\nThis first-created day I named for myself. Then evening came and 〈|again|〉 morning, and it was the second day.\n\n29 |Monday is the day. The fiery substance.|\n\nAnd for all my own heavens I shaped a shape from the fiery substance. My eye looked at the solid and very hard rock. And from the flash of my eye I took the |marvelous| substance of lightning, both fire\n\nin water and water in fire; neither does this one extinguish that one, nor does that one dry out this one. That is why lightning is sharper and brighter than the shining of the sun, and softer than water, more solid than the hardest rock.\n\nAnd from the rock I cut off a great fire, and from the fire I created the ranks of the bodiless armies  the myriad angels  and their weapons are fiery and their clothes are burning flames. And I gave orders that each should stand in his own rank.\n\n|Here Satanail was hurled from the hight, together with his angels.|\n\nBut one from the order of the archangels deviated, together with the division that was under his authority. He thought up the impossible idea, that he might place his throne higher than the clouds which are above the earth, and that he might become equal to my power.\n\nAnd I hurled him out from the height, together with his angels. And he was flying around in the air, ceaselessly above the Bottomless.\n\nAnd thus I created the entire heavens. And the third day came.\n\n30 |Tuesday|\n\nAnd on the third day I commanded the earth to make trees grow, large and fruit-bearing; and the mountains  all kinds of 〈sweet grass and all kinds of〉 sown seed. And I laid out paradise as a garden, and I enclosed it; and I placed armed guards, angels aflame with fire. And thus I created the renewal of the earth.\n\nAnd then evening came and morning came  the fourth day.\n\n|Wednesday|\n\nAnd on the fourth day I commanded: Let there be great lamps on the heavenly circles.\n\nOn the first, the highest circle, I placed the star Kronos;\n\non the 2nd, 〈lower down, I placed〉 Afridit;\n\non the 3rd Arris;\n\non the 4th the sun;\n\non the fifth Zeous;\n\non the 6th Ermis;\n\nand on the 7th, the lowest, the moon.\n\nAnd with the lowest stars I beautified the air below.\n\nAnd I appointed the sun over the illumination of the day, but the\n\nmoon and stars over the illumination of the night. And the sun goes in accordance with each animal, and the twelve animals are the succession of the months. And I assigned their names and the animals of their seasons, and their connection with the newborn, and their horoscopes, and how they revolve. Then evening came and morning came  the fifth day.\n\n|Thursday|\n\nAnd on the 5th day I commanded the sea to engender fishes and feathered birds of many different kinds, and every kind of reptile that creeps on the earth and that walks on the earth of four legs and that flies through the air  male sex and female  and every kind of soul that breathes\n\nthe breath of all living things. And evening came and morning came  the sixth day.\n\n|Friday|\n\nAnd on the sixth day I commanded my wisdom to create man out of the seven components:\n\n|1| his flesh from earth;\n\n|second| his blood from and from the sun;\n\n|third| his eyes from the bottomless sea;\n\n|fourth| his bones from stone;\n\n|fifth| his reason from the mobility of angels and from clouds;\n\n|sixth| his veins and hair from grass of the earth;\n\n|seventh| his spirit from my spirit and from wind.\n\nAnd I gave him 7 properties:\n\nhearing to the flesh;\n\nsight to the eyes;\n\nsmell to the spirit;\n\ntouch to the veins;\n\ntaste to the blood;\n\nto the bones endurance ;\n\nto the reason sweetness.\n\nBehold, I have thought up an ingenious poem to recite:\n\nFrom invisible and visible substances I created man.\n\nFrom both his natures come both death and life.\n\nAnd (as my) image he knows the word like (no) other creature.\n\nBut even at his greatest he is small,\n\nand again at his smallest he is great.\n\nAnd on the earth I assigned him to be a second angel, honored and\n\ngreat and glorious. And I assigned him to be a king, to reign |on| the earth, |and| to have my wisdom. And there was nothing comparable to\n\nhim on earth, even among my creatures that exist. And I assigned to him a name fromm the four components:\n\nfrom East  (A)\n\nfrom West  (D)\n\nfrom North  (A) |South|  (M)\n\nfrom South  (M) |North|  (A).\n\nAnd I assigned to him four special stars, and called his name Adam.\n\nAnd I gave him his free will; and I pointed out to him the two ways  light and darkness. And I said to him, This is good for you, but that is bad; so that I might come to know whether he has love toward me or abhorrence, and so that it might become plain who among his race loves me.\n\nWhereas I have come to know his nature, he does not know his own nature. That is why ignorance is more lamentable than the sin such as it is in him to sin. And I said, After sin there is nothing for it but death.\n\nAnd I assigned a shade for him; and I imposed sleep upon him, and he fell asleep. And while he was sleeping, I took from him a rib. And I created for him a wife, so that death might come 〈|to him|〉 by his wife.\n\nAnd I took his last word, and I called her name Mother, that is to say, Euva.\n\n31 |God hands over paradise to Adam, and gives him a command to look upon the heavens, open, and that he might look upon the angels, singing the triumphal song. Word 27.|\n\nAdam  Mother; earthly and life. And I created a garden in Edem, in the east, so that he might keep the agreement and preserve the commandment.\n\nAnd I created for him an open heaven, so that he might look upon the angels, singing the triumphal song. And the light which is never darkened was perpetually in paradise. And the devil understood how I wished to create another world, so that everything could be subjected to Adam on the earth, to rule and reign over it. The devil is of the lowest places. And he will become a demon, because he fled from heaven; Sotona, because his name was Satanail. In this way he became different from the angels. His nature did not change, 〈but〉 his thought did, since his consciousness of righteous and sinful things changed. And he became aware of his condemnation and of the sin which he sinned previously. And that is why he thought up the scheme against Adam. In such a form he entered paradise, and corrupted Eve. But Adam he did not contact.\n\nBut on account of 〈her〉 nescience I cursed him. But those whom I had blessed previously, them I did not curse; 〈and those whom I had not blessed previously, even them I did not curse〉  neither mankind I cursed, nor the earth, nor any other creature, but only mankinds evil fruit-bearing.\n\nThis is why the fruit of doing good is sweat and exertion.\n\n32 |After Adams transgression, God expels him into the earth from which he had been taken. But he does not wish to destroy him in the age to come. Word 28.|\n\nAnd I said |to him|, You are earth, and into the earth once again you will go, out of which I took you. And I will not destroy you, but I will send you away to what I took you from. Then I can take you once again at my second coming. And I blessed all my creatures, visible and invisible. And Adam was in paradise for 5 hours and a half.\n\nAnd I blessed the 7th day |which is the sabbath| in which I rested from all my doings.\n\n33 |God shows Enoch the epoch of this world, the existence of 7000 years, and the eighth thousand is the end, neither years nor months nor weeks nor days. Word 29.|\n\nOn the eighth day I likewise appointed, so that the 8th day might be the 1st, the first-created of my week, and that it should revolve in the revolution of 7000; 〈|so that the 8000|〉 might be in the beginning of a time not reckoned and unending, neither years, nor months, nor weeks, nor days, nor hours 〈like the first day of the week, so also that the eighth day of the week might return continually〉.\n\nAnd now, Enoch, whatever I have told you, and whatever you have understood, and whatever you have seen in the heavens, and whatever you have seen on the earth, and whatever I have written in the books  by my supreme wisdom all these things I planned to accomplish. And I created them for the highest foundation to the lowest, and to the end.\n\nAnd there is no adviser and no successor to my creation. I am self-eternal and not made by hands. My thought is without change. My wisdom is my adviser and my deed is my word. And my eyes look at all things. 〈If I look at all things〉, then they stand still and shake with terror; but, if I should turn my face away, then all things would perish.\n\nApply your mind, Enoch, and acknowledge the One who is speaking |to you|.

So I have commanded my angels, Ariukh and Pariukh, whom I have appointed on the earth as their guardians, and I have commanded the seasons, so that they might preserve them so that they might no perish in the future flood which I shall create in your generation.\n\n34 |God convicts the persons who are idol worshipers and sodomite fornicators, and for this reason he brings down the flood upon them.

For you hear my words, out of my lips, a human being created exactly equal to yourselves; but I have heard from the fiery lips of the LORD. For the lips of the LORD are a furnace of fire, and his angels are the flames which come out. But you, my children, see my face, a human being created just like yourselves; but I am one who has seen the face of the LORD, like iron made burning hot by a fire, and it is brought out and it emits sparks and it is incandescent. But you gaze into my eyes, a human being equal in significance to yourselves; but I have gazed into the eyes of the LORD, shining like the rays of the sun and terrifying the eyes of a human being. But you, my children, see the right hand of one who helps you, a human being created identical to yourselves; but I have seen the right hand of the LORD, helping me and filling heaven.\n\nBut you see the scope of my activity, the same as your own; but I have seen the scope of the LORD, without limit and without analogy, and to which there is no end.\n\nFor you hear the sayings of my lips, but I have heard the LORD speaking like loud thunder, when there is a continual disturbance in the clouds. And now, my children, listen to the discourses of your earthly father. Frightening and dangerous it is to stand before the face of an earthly king, terrifying and very dangerous it is, because the will of the king is death and the will of the king is life. How much more terrifying |and dangerous| it is to stand before the face of the King of earthly kings and of the heavenly armies, |the regulator of the living and of the dead|. Who can endure that endless misery?\n\n40 |Enoch admonishes his children in all things truthfully from the lips of the LORD, just as he saw them and heard them and wrote them down.

And all the armies and their movements I have measured. And I have recorded the stars and the multitude of multitudes innumerable. What human being can see their cycles and their phases?\n\nFor not even the angels know their number. But I have\n\nwritten down all their names. The solar circle I have measured, and its rays |I have measured, the hours| I have counted; and its entrances in all the months, and\n\nits departures, and all its movements  their names I have written down. The lunar circle I have measured, and its movements which are in accordance with each day, and the diminution which it undergoes during each day and night in accordance with all the hours.\n\nI appointed 4 seasons, and from the seasons I created 4 cycles, and in the cycles I appointed the year, and I appointed months, and from the months I counted days, and from the days I measured off the hours and I counted them and wrote them down. And everything that is nourished on the earth I have investigated and written down, and every seed, sown and not sown, which grows form the earth, and all the garden plants, and all the grasses, and all the flowers, and their delightful fragrances and their names.\n\nAnd the dwelling places of the clouds, their organization and their wings, and how they carry the rain and the raindrops  all this I investigated.\n\nAnd I wrote down the rumble of the thunder and the lightning: and they showed me the keys and their keepers, and the places where they go, where they go in and where they go out, by measure. They are raised by means of a chain, and they are lowered by means of a chain, so that he does not drop the clouds of anger with terrible injuries and violence, and destroy everything on the earth.\n\nI wrote down the treasuries of the snow, and the storehouses of the cold, and the frosty winds. And I observed how, depending on the season, their custodians fill up the clouds with them, and their treasuries are not emptied.\n\nI wrote down the sleeping chambers of the winds, and I observed and I saw how their custodians carry scales and measures. And first they place them n the scales, and secondly in the measure, and it is my measure that they release them skillfully into all the earth, lest the earth should be rocked by violent gusts.\n\nI measured all the earth, and its mountains and hills and fields and woods and stones and rivers, and everything that exists. I wrote down the height from the earth to the seventh heaven, and the depth to the lowermost hell, and the place of condemnation, and the supremely large hell, open and weeping.\n\nAnd I saw how the prisoners were in pain, looking forward to endless punishment; and I recorded all those who have been condemned by the judge, and all their sentences and all their corresponding deeds.\n\n41 |About how Enoch grieved over the sin of Adam.|\n\n|And| I saw all those from the age of my ancestors, with Adam and Eve.

The Bottomless will be poured out over the earth, and the great storages of the waters of heaven will come down onto the earth 〈in a great substance and in accordance with the first substance〉.\n\nAnd the whole constitution of the earth will perish, and all the earth will quake, and it will be deprived of its strength from that day. Then I will preserve the son of your son Lamekh, his first son, Noe. And from his seed I will raise up another world, and his seed will exist forever, until the second destruction when once again mankind will have committed sin in front of my face.\n\nAnd Methusalam leaped up from his sleep, and his dream was very disturbing. And he summoned all the elders of the people, and recounted to them all that the LORD had said to him and all the vision that had been revealed to him by the LORD. And all the people were disturbed by his vision. And they answered him, The LORD is lord, and he will act in accordance with his own will. And now, Methusalam, you do everything just as the LORD has told you.\n\nAnd Methusalam summoned Nir, the son of Lamekh, Noes younger brother, and he invested him with the vestments of priesthood in front of the face of all the people, and made him stand at the head of the altar of the LORD. And he taught him everything that he would have to do among the people.\n\n〈And Methusalam spoke to the people:〉 Here is Nir. He will be in front of your face from the present day as a prince and a leader.\n\nAnd the people said to Methusalam, Let it be so 〈for us〉 in accordance with your word. And you will be the voice of the LORD, just as he said to you.\n\nAnd when Methusalam had spoken to the people in front of the altar, his spirit was convulsed, and, having knelt on his knees, he stretched out his hands to heaven, and prayed to the LORD. And, as he was praying to him, his spirit went\n\nout in accordance with 〈the will of〉 the LORD. And Nir and all the people hurried and constructed a sepulcher for Methusalam in the place Akhuzan, very thoughtfully adorned with all holy things, with lamps.\n\nAnd Nir came with many praises, and the people lifted up Methusalams body, glorifying 〈God〉; they performed the service for him at the sepulcher which they had made for him and they covered him over.\n\nAnd they said, 〈How〉 blessed was Methusalam in front of the face of the LORD and in front of the face of all the people! And when they wanted to go away to their own places, Nir said to the people, Hurry up today and bring sheep and bulls and turtledoves and pigeons, so that you may make a sacrifice in front of the face of the LORD today.\n\nAnd then go away to your houses. And the people gave heed to Nir the priest, and they hurried and they brought 〈them〉 and tied 〈them〉 up at the head of the altar. And Nir took the knife of sacrifice, and slaughtered all that had been brought to be sacrificed in front of the face of the LORD. And all the people made merry in front of the face of the LORD, and on that day they glorified the LORD, the God of heaven and earth, (the God) of Nir. And from that day there was peace and order over all the earth in the days of Nir  202 years.\n\nAnd then the people turned away from the LORD, and they began to be envious one against another, and people went to war against people, and race rose up against race and struggled and insulted one another.\n\nEven if the lips were the same, nevertheless the hearts chose different\n\nthings. For the devil became ruler for the third time. The first was before paradise, the second time was in paradise; the third time was after paradise, 〈and〉 continuing right up to the Flood.\n\nAnd there arose disputation and great turbulence. And Nir the priest heard and was greatly aggrieved. And he said in his heart, In truth I have come to understand how the time has arrived and the saying which the LORD said to Methusalam, the father of my father Lamekh.\n\n71\n\nBehold, the wife of Nir, 〈whose〉 name was Sopanim, being sterile and never having at any time given birth to a child by Nir \n\nAnd Sopanim was in the time of her old age, and in the day of her death. She conceived in her womb, but Nir the priest had not slept with her, nor had he touched her, from the day that the LORD had appointed him to conduct the liturgy in front of the face of the people.\n\nAnd when Sopanim saw her pregnancy, she was ashamed and embarrassed, and she hid herself during all the days until she gave birth. And not\n\none of the people knew about it. And when 282 days had been completed, and the day of birth had begun to approach, and Nir remembered his wife, and he called her to himself in his house, so that he might converse with her.\n\n〈And〉 Sopanim came to Nir, her husband; and, behold, she was pregnant, and the day appointed for giving birth was drawing near.\n\nAnd Nir saw her, and he became very ashamed. And he said to her, What is this that you have done, O wife? And (why) have you disgraced me in front of the face of these people? And now, depart from me, and go where you began the disgrace of your womb, so that I might not defile my hand on account of you, and sin in front of the face of the LORD.\n\nAnd Sopanim spoke to Nir, her husband, saying, O my lord! Behold, it is the time of my old age, and the day of my death has arrived.\n\nI do not understand how my\n\nmenopause and the barrenness of my womb have been reversed.\n\nAnd Nir did not believe his wife, and for the second time he said to her, Depart from me, or else I might assault you, and commit a sin in front of the face of the LORD.\n\nAnd it came to pass, when Nir had spoken to his wife, Sopanim, that Sopanim fell down at Nirs feet and died.\n\nNir was extremely distressed, and he said in his heart, Could this have happened because of my word, since by word and thought a person can sin in front of the face of the LORD?\n\nNow may God have mercy upon me! I know in truth in my heart that my hand was not upon her. And so I say, Glory to you, O LORD, because no one among mankind knows about this deed which the LORD has done. \n\nAnd Nir hurried, and he shut the door of his house, and he went to Noe his brother, and he reported to him everything that had happened in connection with his wife. And Noe hurried. He came with Nir his brother; he came into Nirs house, because of the death of Sopanim, and they discussed between themselves how her womb\n\nwas at the time of giving birth. And Noe said to Nir, Dont let yourself be sorrowful, Nir, my brother! For the LORD today has covered up our scandal, in that nobody from the people knows this.\n\nNow, let us go quickly and let us bury her secretly, and the LORD will\n\ncover up the scandal of our shame. And they placed Sopanim on the bed, and they wrapped her around with black garments, and shut her in the\n\nhouse, prepared for burial. They dug a grave in secret. \n\nAnd a child came out from the dead Sopanim. And he sat on the bed at her side. And Noe and Nir came in to bury Sopanim, and they saw the child\n\nsitting beside the dead Sopanim, and wiping his clothing. And Noe and Nir were very terrified with a great fear, because the child was fully developed physically, like a three-year-old. And he spoke with\n\nhis lips, and he blessed the LORD. And Noe and Nir looked at him,\n\nand behold,\n\nthe badge of priesthood was on his chest, and it was glorious in appearance. And Noe and Nir said, Behold, God is renewing the priesthood from blood related to us, just as he pleases. And Noe and Nir hurried, and they washed the child, and they dressed him in the garments of priesthood, and they gave him the holy bread and he ate it. And they called his name Melkisedek.\n\nAnd Noe and Nir lifted up the body of Sopanim, and divested her of the black garments, and they washed her, and they clothed her in exceptionally bright garments, and they built a shrine for her.\n\nNoe and Nir and Melkisedek came, and they buried her publicly. And Noe said to his brother Nir, Look after this child in secret until the time, because people will become treacherous in all the earth, and they will begin to turn away from God, and having become totally ignorant, they will put him to death.\n\nAnd then Noe went away to his own place.\n\nAnd great lawlessness began to become abundant over all the earth in the\n\ndays of Nir. And Nir began to worry excessively, especially about the child, saying,\n\nHow miserable it is for me, eternal LORD, that in my days all lawlessness has begun to become abundant over the earth. And I realize how much nearer out end is, {and} over all the earth, on account of the lawlessness of the people.\n\nAnd now, LORD, what is the vision about this child, and what is his destiny, and what will I do for him? Is it possible that he too will be joined with us in the destruction? And the LORD heeded Nir, and appeared to him in a night vision. He said to him, Nir, the great lawlessness which has come about on the earth among the\n\nmultitude {which} I shall not tolerate.\n\nAnd behold, I desire now to send out a great destruction onto the earth, and everything that stands on the earth shall perish.\n\nBut, concerning the child, dont be anxious, Nir; because in a short while I shall send my archistratig, Michael. And he will take the child, and put him in the paradise of Edem, in the Paradise where Adam was formerly for 7 years, having heaven open all the time up until when he sinned.\n\nAnd this child will not perish along with those who are perishing in this generation, as I have revealed it, so that Melkisedek will be the priest to all holy priests, and I will establish him so that\n\nhe will be the head of the priests of the future. And Nir arose from his sleep and blessed the LORD who had appeared to him, saying,\n\nBlessed be the LORD, the God of my fathers,\n\nwho has told me how he has made a great priest in my day,\n\nin the womb of Sopanim, my wife.\n\nBecause I had no child in this tribe who might become the great\n\npriest, but this is\n\nmy son and your servant, and you are the great God.\n\nTherefore honor him together with your servants and great priests, with Sit, and Enos, and Rusi, and Amilam, and Prasidam, and Maleleil, and Serokh, and Arusan, and Aleem, and Enoch, and Methusalam, and me, your servant Nir.\n\nAnd behold, Melkisedek will be the head of the 13 priests who existed before. And afterward, in the last generation, there will be another Melkisedek, the first of 12 priests. And the last will be the head of all, a great archpriest, the Word and Power of God, who will perform\n\nmiracles, greater and more glorious than all the previous ones. He, Melkisedek, will be priest and king in the place Akhuzan, that is to say, in the center of the earth, where Adam was created, and there will\n\nbe his final grave. And in connection with that archpriest it is written how he also will be buried there, where the center of the earth is, just as Adam also buried his own son there  Abel, whom his brother Cain murdered; for he lay for 3 years unburied, until he saw a bird called Jackdaw, how it buried his own young.\n\nI know that great conf"
