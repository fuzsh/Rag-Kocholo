The announcement was made Friday, a day after United States President Joe Biden said he's ''very concerned'' that the violence in the Middle East could escalate, adding that the killing of a top Hamas leader in Iran has ''not helped'' efforts to negotiate a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nBy The Associated Press\n\nAssociated Press\n\nAugust 3, 2024 at 3:44AM\n\nThe Pentagon has announced that the U.S. will move a fighter jet squadron to the Middle East and maintain an aircraft carrier in the region. The announcement was made Friday, a day after United States President Joe Biden said he's ''very concerned'' that the violence in the Middle East could escalate, adding that the killing of a top Hamas leader in Iran has ''not helped'' efforts to negotiate a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nBiden said he'd had a ''very direct'' conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. ''We have the basis for a cease-fire. He should move on it and they should move on it now.''\n\nNetanyahu has said his country was determined to win nothing less than ''total victory'' against Hamas. He also said that Israel hoped for a cease-fire soon and was working for one.\n\nThe assassinations of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday and senior Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukur in Beirut on Tuesday risks escalating the fighting into an all-out regional war, with Iran also threatening to respond after the attack on its territory. Israel has vowed to kill Hamas leaders over the group's Oct. 7 attack on Israel that sparked the war.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was among the growing voices internationally calling for a cease-fire in recent days, saying that it was the only way to begin to break the cycle of violence and suffering.\n\n___\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nThousands march in Indonesia's capital to protest the killing of Hamas leader Haniyeh and show support for Palestinians\n\nJAKARTA, Indonesia — Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched Saturday to the heavily guarded United States Embassy in Indonesia's capital to protest the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nWaving giant Indonesian and Palestinian flags and holding posters with Haniyeh's picture and signs that read ''Martyr Haniyeh'' and ''Murderer Israel get out of Palestine,'' thousands of noisy demonstrators gathered along a major street in Jakarta that runs outside the embassy.\n\nMore than 1,300 police were deployed around the compound, which is blocked off by concrete road separators and razor wire. The protest halted traffic along the way.\n\nIndonesia, the world's most populous Muslim majority nation, does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and there is not an Israeli Embassy in the country.\n\nProtesters, organized by Indonesian People's Alliance Defends Palestine group, chanted ''God is Great'' and ''Freedom for Palestine'' as they marched. Their banners and placards slammed the siege in Gaza and denounced America's staunch support of Israel.\n\nIndonesia has long been a strong supporter of Palestinians and President Joko Widodo has condemned the assassination of Haniyeh.\n\n''It was an intolerable murder that took place on Iran's sovereign territory,'' Widodo told reporters Thursday. ''I think everyone, including Indonesia, strongly condemns such violence and killings.''\n\nThe US will boost military presence in Mideast, sending fighter jet squadron and keeping carrier there\n\nThe United States Defense Department will move a fighter jet squadron to the Middle East and maintain an aircraft carrier in the region, the Pentagon said Friday, as President Joe Biden made good on his promise to beef up the American military presence to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies and safeguard U.S. troops.\n\nIn a statement, the department said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also ordered additional ballistic missile defense-capable cruisers and destroyers to the European and Middle East regions and is taking steps to send more land-based ballistic missile defense weapons there.\n\nThe shifts come as U.S. leaders worry about escalating violence in the Middle East in response to recent attacks by Israel on Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, which triggered threats of retaliation.\n\nUS Defense Secretary to direct forces to provide additional support to Israel and increase American troop protection in region\n\nWASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ''will be directing multiple'' force movements to provide additional support to Israel and increase protection for American troops in the region, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Friday. She said final decisions have not yet been made.\n\nSingh said it could involve deploying additional military units ''with additional capabilities that … would need to be operated by additional people.'' She declined to provide details, but an array of defensive measures, from additional ships and fighter aircraft units to added air defense systems, would involve more troops.\n\nShe said she's not aware of any United States military units being ordered to prepare to deploy as yet.\n\nThe U.S. continues to have a number of warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, including two Navy destroyers, the USS Roosevelt and the USS Bulkeley, as well as the USS Wasp and the USS New York.\n\nThe Wasp and the New York are part of the amphibious ready group and carry a Marine expeditionary unit that could be used if any evacuation of U.S. personnel is required.\n\nIn addition, a U.S. official said that two U.S Navy destroyers that are currently in the Middle East will be heading north up the Red Sea toward the Mediterranean Sea. At least one of those could linger in the Mediterranean if needed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss troop movements.\n\nWater access is also strained after water wells across the enclave were destroyed in Israeli airstrikes. Palestinians in Deir al-Balah line up for hours to fill up their bottles or jerry cans from water barrels.\n\n''There is no life here. We're not living. Donkeys in Gaza used to live a better life than the one we are living now,'' Mohamed Hanounah, a man displaced from Gaza City, told AP.\n\nIsraeli police detain top imam at Al-Aqsa mosque over Haniyeh comments\n\nJERUSALEM — Israeli police have detained the top imam at the revered Al-Aqsa compound in Jerusalem's Old City for comments he made during a Friday sermon mourning the death of top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nHaniyeh was assassinated earlier in the week in Tehran in an attack that many have pinned on Israel. On Friday, Israeli police said they brought Sheikh Ekrima Sabri in for questioning after his address during midday prayers mentioned Haniyeh by name, mourning his death and asking ''God Almighty to have mercy on him and to grant him a place in his spacious gardens.''\n\nThe police said they are now investigating Sabri for incitement. They said the state has previously filed an indictment against Sabri on the same charge, one of 140 indictments for incitement in the Jerusalem area — including several other imams. Throughout the war, Israel has cracked down on Palestinian free speech, rights groups say, arresting them for speech deemed by Israeli authorities to be incendiary.\n\nIsrael blamed Hezbollah for the strike; Hezbollah denied responsibility. Days later, Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander in a rare strike in Beirut for which Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate, triggering fears that the conflict could spiral out of control.\n\nFrench minister seeks greater security for Jewish communities as tensions escalate\n\nPARIS — France's Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin on Friday called for increased security measures to protect Jewish communities across the country amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. ''The risk of action is real,'' Darmanin said in a note to national and local law enforcement agencies.\n\nHe requested greater security around places frequented by Jewish people in France, particularly places of worship and other gatherings for religious services.\n\nDarmanin specifically mentioned the ''many Israeli citizens'' in France at the time of the Paris Olympics in need of protection as tensions flare up following the assassination of top Hamas and Hezbollah leaders in Tehran and in Beirut.\n\nIsrael protests after Turkey lowers embassy flag for Haniyeh\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus — Cyprus' foreign minister says authorities are in touch with the diplomatic missions of nations that may opt to evacuate their citizens through the east Mediterranean island nation if the Israeli-Hamas war expands to engulf neighboring countries.\n\nMinister Constantinos Kombos said Friday agencies have been mobilized as part of the country's long-standing evacuation action plan called ESTIA. He said there's a ''serious danger'' of conflict expanding further, which would affect the entire region.\n\nKombos said Cyprus' role is to ''operate as a bridge of safety'' in the region in the event of mass evacuations of third-country citizens from the Middle East.\n\nIn 2023, Cyprus acted as a waystation for third-country evacuees from Sudan and Israel after the start of the Israel-Hamas war. The island nation also helped in the evacuation of tens of thousands of third-country nationals during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah conflict.\n\nAn Australian inquiry blames Israeli military failings for a fatal drone attack on a Gaza aid convoy\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia — An Australian investigation has found the Israeli military's attack on an aid convoy in Gaza that killed seven people resulted from serious failures of defense procedures, mistaken identification, and bad decisions.\n\nAustralian Zomi Frankcom was among those killed in the April 1 Israeli drone strikes on three World Central Kitchen vehicles. The report released Friday says the convoy's armed security guards were likely mistaken for Hamas operatives. Two Israeli officers were dismissed and three reprimanded, but Frankcom's family says more should be done.\n\nFormer Australian Defense Force Chief Mark Binskin was appointed as Australia's special adviser on the matter. He says Israel should apologize to the families.\n\nA family representative issued a statement Friday welcoming Binskin's report as an ''important first step.''\n\n''We hope it will be followed by further investigations in Israel regarding those responsible for this tragic event, followed by appropriate action,'' the family statement said.\n\nPakistan's prime minister calls for a day of mourning for Hamas leader Haniyeh\n\nISLAMABAD — Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is appealing to his countrymen to observe a day of mourning and hold special funeral prayers in absentia for the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in the Iranian capital of Tehran.\n\nSuch prayers are held when the body of any person is from the country.\n\nSharif in his televised remarks Friday said he will also attend a special funeral service for Haniyeh at a mosque at his sprawling office in the capital, Islamabad.\n\nHe denounced the killing of the Hamas leader in his brief remarks shortly before Pakistan's parliament approved a resolution to express solidarity with the Palestinian people. The resolution also called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and denounced the killing of the Hamas leader.\n\nUS President Biden is ‘very concerned' that violence in the Mideast could escalate\n\nJOINT BASE ANDREWS, Maryland — President Joe Biden said late Thursday he's ''very concerned'' that the violence in the Middle East could escalate, adding that the killing of a top Hamas leader in Iran has ''not helped'' efforts to negotiate a cease-fire in Israel's war with Gaza.\n\nBiden said he'd had a ''very direct'' conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier in the day, repeating ''very direct'' for emphasis.\n\nMore from Nation\n\nSee More\n\nThe trial of a Las Vegas-area politician accused of killing an investigative reporter who wrote articles critical of him began Monday, after the judge denied the defendant's last request to dismiss the case and jury selection began.\n\nNation\n\nFormer Colorado clerk Tina Peters, hero to election deniers, convicted in election computer breach\n\nNation\n\nQuake felt from LA to San Diego, swaying buildings and knocking items off shelves but no big damage\n\nThe trial of a Las Vegas-area politician accused of killing an investigative reporter who wrote articles critical of him began Monday, after the judge denied the defendant's last request to dismiss the case and jury selection began.\n\nNation\n\nFormer Colorado clerk Tina Peters, hero to election deniers, convicted in election computer breach\n\nNation\n\nQuake felt from LA to San Diego, swaying buildings and knocking items off shelves but no big damage"
