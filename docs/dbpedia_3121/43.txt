This week's guest on Life In The Stocks is rock 'n' roll legend & gentleman Ricky Warwick, former frontman of The Almighty and now lead singer in Black Star Riders - the new incarnation of Thin Lizzy. Ricky joins Matt on the podcast to discuss growing up in Northern Ireland and the Troubles there, his tenure in New Model Army, his first band The Almighty and the amazing tours they did, from Ramones & Motorhead to Iron Maiden, Pantera & Megadeth, to his solo career, joining Thin Lizzy and their evolution into Black Star Riders, and the many rock 'n' roll stories he's amassed along the way.
