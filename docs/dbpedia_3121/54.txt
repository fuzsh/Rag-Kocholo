The Scottish heavier than thou metalers are in the Riverside Suite of Newport Centre on November 30, 13 years after they were spawned.

Back then they were at odds with the glam that surrounded them and had more in common with Motorhead than Metallica. Founder band member Ricky Warwick had been in New Model Army while his newfound cohort Stump Munroe came from FM Revolver.

The band's debut album, Blood, Fire and Love was released in 1989, with a heavy emphasis on anthemic songs, and they were compared to Electra era Blue Oyster Cult.

The following live juggernaut, still hurtling, only slightly less erratically, today, was captured on video and released as Blood, Fire and Live, an unusual step for such a young band but a move that bore testament to their formidable live reputation.

In their early days the band met with the Hells Angels to discuss the similarities between Almighty's and the Angel's emblems.

Album two consolidated Almighty's success and with the ear mashing Free'n'Easy that had some single success.

Former Alice Cooper guitarist Peter Friesen replaced Tantrum for their third and still must successful album to date, Powertrippin', which reached number five in the album charts in 1993.

Two albums followed on a new label, Crank (featuring Andy Cairns of Therapy) on backing vocals) and Just Add Life but the glory days were gone. In 2000 they delivered an eponymous come back with Nick Parsons replacing Friesen on guitar.

Almighty play the Riverside Suite, Newport Centre on Friday, November 30.
