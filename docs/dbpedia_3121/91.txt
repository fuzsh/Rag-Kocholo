Long-running U.K. rockers THE ALMIGHTY have issued the following update:

"It's with very heavy hearts and immense sadness that we have to announce that our friend and one-time manager of THE ALMIGHTY, Tommy Tee, passed away very suddenly on the evening of December 23. all our thoughts at this time are with his wife Jube and children Ben, Thomas and Charlie.

"Tommy managed THE ALMIGHTY from 1988 to 1993 and even after we parted ways he remained a firm friend throughout.

"Ricky [Warwick, THE ALMIGHTY frontman] first got to know Tommy when he joined NEW MODEL ARMY as a live guitar player for their world tour back in 1987. Tommy was their tour manager at that time and would later would go on to become their manager. The rest of us were lucky enough to meet him shortly after as he was one of the main catalysts that started what was to become THE ALMIGHTY.

"Tommy was one of those people who, when you first met, you liked straight away, he had a huge zest for life, a fantastic work ethic and above all a huge sense of fun.
