        "text": "ST. MALO, Aug. 11.—It's a\n\nstrange war. To-day an Ameri-\n\ncan officer and a German inside\n\nthe St. Malo Citadel discussed by\n\ntelephone whether the Germans\n\nshould surrender. The Ger-\n\nman cut off, and he and his fel-\n\nlows continued the battle.\n\nMalor J. M. Alexander, of New\n\nYork, on entering a house which had\n\nb«en hurriedly evacuated by the Ger-\n\nmans, found a telephone intact.\n\nHe tried unsuccessfully to get in\n\ntouch with the German Commandant\n\nin the Citadel, but when that proved\n\nimpossible, he said to the operator:\n\n\"ft is foolish of you to keep on fight-\n\ning. You know you are beaten.\"\n\nA German voice admitted that the\n\ngarrison was beaten, but added that\n\nthe Germans had orders to continue\n\nfighting.\n\nCONCRETE FORTRESS\n\nThe Citadel, the only point In St.\n\nMalo still held by the Germans, is a\n\nhuge concrete fortification on the most\n\nprominent headland In the harbour\n\narea. It measures about 500 yards\n\nby 600 yards, and consists mainly of\n\nunderground tunnels which have been\n\nconnected to form a communication\n\nand supply system and an air-raid\n\nshelter. It is in the Citadel that\n\nthe whole of the remaining German\n\nforces, numbeiing now only a few\n\nhundreds have taken cover. Trapped\n\non a narrow headland, their death\n\nor capture can be a matter of only\n\na short time.\n\nLast night the foreshore was almost\n\nobscured by fires raging in the docks.\n\nAmerican artillery, which has been\n\nfiring day and night, had succeeded\n\nin hitting several vital supply dumps,\n\nwhich exploded, and threw off thick\n\ncolumns of black smoke.\n\nGerman guns firing from neigh-\n\nbouring islands and from the citadel\n\nwere shelling areas only a few hun-\n\ndred yards distant, and they, too,\n\nsecured hits on dumps which only a\n\nfew hours earlier had belonged to\n\nthem.\n\nSome German troops have surren-\n\ndered without a fight, some have\n\nallowed themselves to be captured\n\nafter firing only a few shots. Others,\n\nwho now occupy the fortress, have\n\nrefused to capitulate at any price."
