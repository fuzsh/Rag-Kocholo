        "text": "Saint Malo and the Intra-Muros\n\nTourism in Saint-Malo is a must if you're in the region. Stroll along the ramparts of the Intra-Muros and admire the incredible view of the Bay of Saint Malo.\n\nSaint Malo was completely destroyed during the bombings of 1944. The people of Saint-Malo then worked diligently to rebuild the Intra-Muros, stone by stone, identical to the original. This effort was completed in 1987 when the cathedral spire was reinstalled.\n\nWithin the Intra-Muros, tourists wander through the narrow streets lined with old privateer houses and those of wealthy shipowners of the past, who greatly contributed to the city's prosperity. From the ramparts, admire the setting sun...\n\nSaint Malo, the Corsair City\n\nThe Vauban Fort\n\nFormerly known as Fort Républicain, then Fort Impérial, and finally Fort National in 1970, this imposing fortress served as a landmark for sailors in the Middle Ages. It became a defensive bastion in the 17th century when King Louis XIV decided to strengthen its defenses. Its architect, Vauban, designed it with the particularity of having no blind spots to achieve the best surveillance of attempts of invasion by sea, especially those of the English.\n\nIf the flag is raised, don't hesitate to visit the museum inside where you can discover its hidden treasures, including a preserved English cannon and some cannonballs, witnessing the English's serious intention to obliterate Saint-Malo.\n\nThe Great Maritime Heroes\n\nCartier\n\nBorn in 1491 in Saint-Malo, Jacques Cartier is one of the explorers we admire in history books. It was from Saint-Malo that he embarked on his expedition to Newfoundland for King Francis I of France, hoping to find a passage to Asia or new riches. He was the first to name this new continent: Canada.\n\nJacques Cartier is buried and rests today within the Cathedral of Saint Malo.\n\nSurcouf\n\nBaron Robert Surcouf was arguably the most fearless corsair of his time, terrorizing English merchant and military ships sailing too close to the Bay of Saint Malo. Appointed captain at the age of 20, he continued to impress. In fact, even Napoleon himself personally came to persuade him to accept a mission in 1803. The following year, he was elevated to the rank of a Knight of the Legion of Honor for his maritime exploits."
