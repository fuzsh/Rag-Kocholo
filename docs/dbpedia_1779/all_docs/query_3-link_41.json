        "text": "It’s a shame that so many visitors only see Saint-Malo as a quick stop on a tour to Mont Saint-Michel.\n\nOne of Brittany’s walled coastal cities that has its own chapter in WW2 history, Saint-Malo offers pretty beaches that have seen everything from corsairs to soldiers to sunbathers across its shores.\n\nAnd now, it’s your turn to leave footprints in the sand. Here’s a quick introduction to Saint-Malo, France.\n\nImage Credit: Getty Images, Andrea Pistolesi. Image Location: Saint-Malo, Brittany, France\n\nYour guide to Saint-Malo, France\n\nExploring a coastal city in Brittany where you'll find tennis, TV shows, and tasty Breton dishes.\n\nWhere is Saint-Malo, France?\n\nSaint-Malo is on the English Channel in France’s northwestern Brittany region. Rennes is the closest major city, sitting around 50 minutes south by train (and that 50 minutes is the same time it’d take by car; a perfect way to make an easy eco-friendly swap without delaying your journey).\n\nWhat is the main train station in Saint Malo?\n\nThe train station in Saint-Malo is Gare de Saint-Malo. You can get to Saint-Malo in less than three hours by train from Paris, with direct routes available from Paris Montparnasse as well as single-change routes stopping briefly in Rennes.\n\nWhen is the WTA 125K Saint-Malo France?\n\nSince 2008, Saint-Malo has hosted the Women’s Tennis Association WTA 125K series event, L’Open 35 de Saint-Malo. It’s played on the outdoor clay courts of Tennis Club J.A. Saint-Malo. Held annually in May, WTA 125K Saint-Malo France features both singles and doubles matches.\n\nWhy was Saint-Malo important in WW2?\n\nSaint-Malo was a German stronghold in WW2 that the Allies sought to recapture to use as a port for supplies. The Allies spent nearly a month battling the Germans for the coastal city in 1944, leaving over 80% of it in ruins. Saint-Malo was used as a filming location for Netflix’s All the Light We Cannot See, which is based on the historical fiction novel written by Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Anthony Doerr.\n\nImage Credit: Getty Images, Manfred Gottschalk.
