        "text": "La fort de la Cit√©\n\nWell, it has been a long time since I have posted a thread on here and 6 months after visiting this site I finally got around to putting this together.\n\nDuring a road trip to France, a few of us headed out to investigate a few highlights of the second world war. Having stopped at the usual spots like Omaha beach and Pointe du Hoc which were very interesting and moving, we headed along the coast into Brittany to check out what I thought was going to be something along the same lines. When we got there, I was mesmerised by the place. I don't think I've visited anywhere which has fascinated me so much and having spent a lot of time exploring British defences you suddenly realised how inferior they were to the the infamous Atlantik Wall.\n\nThis place is steeped in history and it's hard trying to edit it down into one thread, but I'll do my best.\n\nThe small peninsula of La Cit√© d' Aleth has long been an excellent position to command the entrance to the river Rance and the entrance to the harbour of St Malo. A thriving Roman town existed there of which parts of the chapel remain.\n\nIn the 18th Century the French King wanted a strong fortification built on the headland. A task he appointed to S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban, A famous military architect. This fort was used by the French army up until 1935 but it then became derelict.\n\nDuring the second world war, after the British were driven out of France The Germans realised the strategic importance of the position and dug in with 32 bunkers linked by a tunnel system 14 meters deep in the granite.\n\nThis was not the only position defended so heavily, the rest of the area became heavily fortified, completely cutting off navigation into the main port in northern Brittany. The small island of C√©zembre several kilometers offshore had guns with a range of 18 Km. This apparently then became the most intensely bombed and shelled area on the planet during the allied offensive that was to follow.\n\nThe man in charge of Festung St Malo Was Colonel Andreas Von Aulock. This man was a hardened veteran of many nazi campaigns and gained quite a reputation during the battle for Stalingrad. When talking of La Cit√© d' Aleth he vowed \"doing my duty as a soldier, I will fight until the last stone\".\n\nBack in the Fort, the underground artillery battery consisted of 2 75mm guns facing Dinard and two 105mm guns facing St Malo. These were dug into the cliffs in fortress type buildings with the only access being from the tunnel system. There were Three 40mm AA positions on highest point of the fort and countless machine gun positions. All this was backed up by the fearsome M19 mortar bunker in the middle of the parade square which was capable of firing 120 40mm rounds per minute from within a ten inch thick armoured steel cupola.\n\nA plan of the main part of the fort. More gun positions are out of view.\n\nA view of St Servan with the fort in the background, taken in 1944\n\nThe old French fort is in the top left corner, the Nazi fortifications ran all along the headland.\n\nA P38 Lightning flies low over the fort.\n\nThe bombardment begins on the 4th of August 1944. RAF Mosquitoes and USAF P38s start to tear the area apart. A US Army war correspondant at the scene was a young lady by the name of Lee Miller, a close friend of Man Ray and Picasso who built quite a reputation for herself with her surrealist wartime images.\n\nA map showing German positions and the Allied advance.\n\nThis aerial battle was also noted as the first time napalm was used in war.\n\nUS Troops shelling the nearby fort of Petit B√©\n\nThe US Troops arrived at the fort on the 9th of August, unaware of the position's strength. After three days of bombing, the first infantry attack was a failure with the loss of 40 us soldiers. The 200 Germans within their positions hardly suffered a scratch. An intense bombardment from land and air followed by two more failed assaults left the Americans in a difficult position. In a moment some have likened to the destruction of the Death Star in Star Wars, one of their P38's managed to drop a napalm tank right into one of the fort's air vents, rapidly sapping the oxygen within the underground complex. Von Aulock ordered the immediate surrender of the fort.\n\nAmerican soldiers raise the flag in the barrel of a 40mm bofors AA gun. As a memorial to this moment, the gun has remained where it fell after it's position suffered a hit from a high explosive bomb.\n\nShell casings litter the floor\n\nGerman soldiers are marched back in to St Malo down Rue de la Cit√©\n\nAmericans celebrate the capture of the fort against one of the six steel machine gun cupolas mutilated by shellfire.\n\nSo, on to the fort today. Much has been taken over the years but the entire complex remains intact. 10 % of the underground system is used by the museum that is now on site. This offers a tour of the anit aircraft section of the fort and is well worth the few quid for the entry and tour. This does leave out much of the site though and by having a good root around there are plenty of interesting things to find. A campsite is also located in the fort's grounds, and we had to make use of this to get the best from the place. The views that are most typical of the fort are the 47 tonne steel machine gun cupolas So I will begin with these and work my way around.\n\n_DSC2793 by Digital Noise Photography, on Flickr\n\nThis is the cupola on the NE side of the fort faces over to the town of St Malo. It has taken considerable damage, presumably from across the harbour. This was not all done during the battle, the cupolas were apparently used to test weaponry after but there is no hard evidence to say either way.\n\nCarved like Butter by Digital Noise Photography, on Flickr\n\nA closer view of the battered seaward side\n\nIn the Campsite by Digital Noise Photography, on Flickr\n\nThe Cupola in this shot is the one that was in the photo with the American troops earlier.
