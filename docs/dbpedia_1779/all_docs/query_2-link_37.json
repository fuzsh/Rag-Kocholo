        "text": "On Friday our field school got the opportunity to hear from a survivor of the Maillé massacre. This massacre, which happened on the same day as the liberation of Paris (August 25, 1944), was carried out by German soldiers. 124 residents of the town were killed and the survivor we heard from lost both of his parents. The town was also bombarded with cannons and much of it was set on fire after the massacre.\n\nThe survivor who spoke to us, Monsieur Martin, answered any questions we had, no matter how personal, and mentioned that it had taken until the early 2000s for people to speak up about what had happened. He also stressed the importance of telling his story, and even said that the story that he and the other survivors have told have helped to change the opinions of Neo-Nazi youth. I found listening to him to be extremely powerful and it also helped me understand why when there were so many plaques on the buildings in Saint-Malo, why there are so many cemeteries throughout Europe and why there is tourism surrounding them, as well as what sort of drive pushes other survivors to tell their stories (such as the people whose accounts of the Vélodrome d’hiver roundup we listened to online for last week).\n\nOn May 26th we visited Saint-Malo and on the 27th we visited Mont-Saint-Michel. These places we very different from each other, and from Maillé, and yet all of them were touched by WWII. Saint-Malo was absolutely decimated by allied bombing during the war and the majority of it had to be rebuilt. There are plaques all over the place that serve as reminders of the war and the reconstruction.\n\nAt Mont-Saint-Michel, on the other hand, there is no reminder of the war and it remained untouched. However, our tour guide told us that it was occupied by the Germans.\n\nIt is interesting because when I think of WWII in France, or at least when I did in the past, I thought about the allied invasions in Normandy and how Canada helped save the day. It seems like that is what we focus on in Canadian schools. Being a history minor, I did know that things were a lot more complicated than that but I never learned about the death and destruction that the allies caused in places like Saint-Malo, or about the Vélodrome d’hiver roundup where French authorities rounded up Jewish people and held them in a bicycle arena in Paris before shipping them off to concentration camps. I also never learned about “small” massacres like the one in Maillé.\n\nI think that there is a certain amount of glorification that surrounds WWII tourism and even media about the war, but places such as Maillé and Saint-Malo help to remind people that the war is not just about the gory details of the concentration camps or allied soldiers being turned into heroes, but a huge, awful, and intricate event. As someone who has lived in Canada for my entire life it is easy to focus on the gruesome yet sensational aspects of it and forget about the individual cities and people. For this reason I am grateful to have gotten to visit these places, to have learned about them, and to have heard from someone who experienced such a terrible atrocity himself. It certainly makes me see things differently."
