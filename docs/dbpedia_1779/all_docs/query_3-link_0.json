In 1944, the Allies heavily bombed Saint-Malo. The city changed into a popular tourist centre, with a ferry terminal serving the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey, as well as the Southern English settlements of Portsmouth, Hampshire and Poole, Dorset.\n\nThe famous transatlantic single-handed yacht race Route du Rhum, which takes place every four years in November, is between Saint Malo and Pointe-à-Pitre in Guadeloupe.\n\nPopulation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe population in 2017 was 46,097[6] – though this can increase to up to 300,000 in the summer tourist season. With the suburbs included, the metropolitan area's population is approximately 133,000 (2017).[7]\n\nThe population of the commune more than doubled in 1967 with the merging of three communes: Saint-Malo, Saint-Servan (population 14,963 in 1962) and Paramé (population 8,811 in 1962).\n\nInhabitants of Saint-Malo are called Malouins in French.[8] The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Saint-Malo proper in its geography for the given years.[9]\n\nHistorical population\n\nYearPop.±% p.a.1793 10,730— 1800 9,147−2.25%1806 9,934+1.39%1821 9,949+0.01%1831 9,981+0.03%1836 9,744−0.48%1841 10,053+0.63%1846 10,076+0.05%1851 9,997−0.16%1856 10,809+1.57%1861 10,886+0.14%1866 10,693−0.36%1872 12,316+2.38%1876 10,295−4.38%1881 11,212+1.72%1886 10,500−1.30%1891 11,896+2.53%1896 11,476−0.72%\n\nYearPop.±% p.a.1901 11,486+0.02%1906 10,647−1.51%1911 12,371+3.05%1921 12,390+0.02%1926 13,137+1.18%1931 12,864−0.42%1936 13,836+1.47%1946 11,311−1.99%1954 14,339+3.01%1962 17,137+2.25%1968 42,297+16.25%1975 45,030+0.90%1982 46,347+0.41%1990 48,057+0.45%1999 50,675+0.59%2007 48,563−0.53%2012 44,620−1.68%2017 46,097+0.65%\n\nSource: EHESS[9] and INSEE (1968-2017)[6]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFounded by Gauls in the 1st century BC, the ancient town on the site of Saint-Malo was known as the Roman Reginca or Aletum. By the late 4th century AD, the Saint-Servan district was the site of a major Saxon Shore promontory fort that protected the Rance estuary from seaborne raiders from beyond the frontiers. According to the Notitia Dignitatum, the fort was garrisoned by the militum Martensium under a dux (commander) of the Tractus Armoricanus and Nervicanus section of the litus Saxonicum. During the decline of the Western Roman Empire, Armorica (modern-day Brittany) rebelled from Roman rule under the Bagaudae and in the 5th and 6th centuries received many Celtic Britons fleeing instability across the Channel. The modern Saint-Malo traces its origins to a monastic settlement founded by Saint Aaron and Saint Brendan early in the sixth century. Its name is derived from a man said to have been a follower of Brendan the Navigator, Saint Malo or Maclou, an immigrant from what is now Wales.\n\nSaint-Malo is the setting of Marie de France's poem \"Laüstic,\" a 12th-century love story. The city had a tradition of asserting its autonomy in dealings with the French authorities and even with the local Breton authorities.\n\nFrom 1590 to 1593, Saint-Malo declared itself to be an independent republic, when 'la république de Saint-Malo' (Saint Malo Republic) functioned as a de facto micronation, and from whence the town takes its defiant motto \"not French, not Breton, but Malouin\" (‘Ni Français, ni Breton, Malouin suis’).[10]\n\nSaint-Malo became notorious as the home of the corsairs, French privateers and sometimes pirates. In the 19th century, this \"piratical\" notoriety was portrayed in Jean Richepin's play Le flibustier and in César Cui's eponymous opera. The corsairs of Saint-Malo not only forced English ships passing up the Channel to pay tribute but also brought wealth from further afield. Jacques Cartier lived in, and sailed from, Saint-Malo to the Saint Lawrence River, visiting the villages of Stadacona and Hochelaga that would later become the sites of present-day Quebec City and Montreal respectively. As the first European to encounter these sites and learning the local word \"Kanata\" (meaning a group of houses), Cartier is credited as the discoverer of Canada.\n\nInhabitants of Saint-Malo are called Malouins in French. From this came the Spanish name Islas Malvinas for the archipelago known in English as the Falkland Islands. Islas Malvinas derives from the 1764 name Îles Malouines, given to the islands by French explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville.[8] Bougainville, who founded the archipelago's first settlement, named the islands after the inhabitants of Saint-Malo, the point of departure for his ships and colonists.[8]\n\nIn 1758, the Raid on Saint-Malo saw a British expedition land, intending to capture the town. However, the British made no attempt on Saint-Malo and instead occupied the nearby town of Saint-Servan, where they destroyed 30 privateers before departing.\n\nWorld War II\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Battle of Saint-Malo\n\nIn World War II, during fighting in late August and early September 1944, the historic walled city of Saint-Malo was almost totally destroyed by American shelling and bombing.[11][12] The beaches of nearby Dinard had been heavily fortified against possible Allied commando raids. Artillery at the two locations provided mutual support. The fortification complex was garrisoned by more than twelve thousand German troops from different services and units as well as stragglers from other battles in the Cotentin. About eight thousand Germans were in Saint-Malo itself when the battle began.[13]\n\nColonel Andreas von Aulock, the German commander, refused to surrender when asked to do so by the town's authorities. He said he \"would defend St. Malo to the last man even if the last man had to be himself\".\n\nThe first American attack was launched by the 83rd Infantry Division on 5 August 1944. German positions at Châteauneuf quickly fell. Cancale was abandoned and occupied by the Americans on the 6th. In the same way and on the same day, Dinan fell to Free French forces. The Germans shortened their lines and drew closer to the ancient citadel at St. Servan-sur-Mer, now reinforced with concrete.\n\nEffective German artillery emplacements on the island of Cezembre were out of reach of American ground forces. German garrisons on the Channel Islands of Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney were able to use small craft to bring in water and remove the wounded from the battle.[13]\n\nOn 13 August, the walled city was on fire and a short truce was declared to allow French civilians to flee the city. Outlying German positions at St. Ideuc and La Varde fell to infantry attacks. This fighting ended resistance on the north shore of the peninsula. Only the citadel remained. Surrounded by American artillery and under frequent air attack, this last holdout surrendered on the afternoon of 17 August.\n\nCezembre surrendered on 2 September when the three-hundred-man garrison ran out of drinking water. The Americans had taken more than ten thousand prisoners during the two-week fight, von Aulock among them.[13]\n\nPost-war\n\n[edit]\n\nSaint-Malo was rebuilt over a 12-year period from 1948 to 1960.\n\nIt is a subprefecture of the Ille-et-Vilaine. The commune of Saint-Servan was merged with Paramé, and became the commune of Saint-Malo in 1967.\n\nSaint-Malo was the site of an Anglo-French summit in 1998 that led to a significant agreement regarding European defence policy.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Gulf of Saint-Malo has an oceanic temperate climate. Temperatures are softened by the Gulf Stream and the range of average temperatures between winter and summer is very low (from 6.1°C in January to 17.8°C in August) with an average temperature of 11.6°C.\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nSaint-Malo is part of Ille-et-Vilaine's 7th constituency, and is currently represented in the National Assembly by Republicans Member of Parliament, Jean-Luc Bourgeaux.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nSchools\n\n[edit]\n\nSchools include:\n\n13 public preschools (écoles maternelles)[17]\n\n11 public elementary schools[18]\n\n8 private preschools and elementary schools[19]\n\n3 public collèges: Chateaubriand, Duguay-Trouin, and Charcot[20]\n\n3 private junior high schools: Choisy Jeanne d'Arc, Moka, and Sacré-Cœur[21]\n\n3 public senior high schools: Lycée Maupertuis, Lycée Jacques Cartier, Professional Maritime Lycée Les Rimains[22]\n\n2 private senior high schools: Lycée Institution Saint Malo-La Providence and Les Rimains[23]\n\nHigher education\n\n[edit]\n\nInstitute of Technology of Saint-Malo\n\nA nurse school\n\nA maritime school\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nSaint-Malo has a terminal for ferry services with daily departures to Portsmouth operated by Brittany Ferries,[24] and services on most days to Poole in England via the Channel Islands operated by Condor Ferries.[25] It also has a railway station, Gare de Saint-Malo, offering direct TGV service to Rennes, Paris and several regional destinations. There is a bus service provided by Keolis. The town is served by the Dinard–Pleurtuit–Saint-Malo Airport around 5 kilometres (3 miles) to the south.\n\nSites of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nNow inseparably attached to the mainland, Saint-Malo is the most visited place in Brittany.
