The team has made recommendations and suggestions related to areas where operational safety of Saint-Alban NPP could be improved. Examples include: Limiting the extent of access to the Main Control Room to only the number of necessary personnel; Minimizing the number and time validity of temporary modifications; Undertaking the manipulation of reactivity in accordance with the best international practices; and Improving the effective control of contamination. Saint-Alban management expressed a determination to address all the areas identified for improvement and requested the IAEA to schedule a follow-up mission in approximately 18 months time. The team handed over a draft of their recommendations, suggestions and good practices to the plant management in the form of ''Technical Notes'' for factual comments. The technical notes will be reviewed at IAEA headquarters including any comments from Saint-Alban NPP and the French Nuclear Safety Authority. The final report will be submitted to the Government of France within three months. This was the 158th mission of the OSART programme, which began in 1982.

This event is likely to cause numerous disruptions to local traffic, as the roads used by the race will be closed to all vehicles except those bearing the official race insignia: 90 minutes before the first rider comes through; up to 15 minutes after the police vehicle bearing the 'Â fin de courseÂ ' sign has driven through. Furthermore, there will be no access to the centre of Saint-Genis-Pouilly from about 12.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. As a result, you are strongly advised to take these difficulties into account when making any car journeys ...\n\nHistory of psychosurgery at Sainte-Anne Hospital, Paris, France, through translational interactions between psychiatrists and neurosurgeons.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZanello, Marc; Pallud, Johan; Baup, Nicolas; Peeters, Sophie; Turak, Baris; Krebs, Marie Odile; Oppenheim, Catherine; Gaillard, Raphael; Devaux, Bertrand\n\n2017-09-01\n\nSainte-Anne Hospital is the largest psychiatric hospital in Paris. Its long and fascinating history began in the 18th century. In 1952, it was at Sainte-Anne Hospital that Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker used the first neuroleptic, chlorpromazine, to cure psychiatric patients, putting an end to the expansion of psychosurgery. The Department of Neuro-psychosurgery was created in 1941. The works of successive heads of the Neurosurgery Department at Sainte-Anne Hospital summarized the history of psychosurgery in France. Pierre Puech defined psychosurgery as the necessary cooperation between neurosurgeons and psychiatrists to treat the conditions causing psychiatric symptoms, from brain tumors to mental health disorders. He reported the results of his series of 369 cases and underlined the necessity for proper follow-up and postoperative re-education, illustrating the relative caution of French neurosurgeons concerning psychosurgery. Marcel David and his assistants tried to follow their patients closely postoperatively; this resulted in numerous publications with significant follow-up and conclusions. As early as 1955, David reported intellectual degradation 2 years after prefrontal leucotomies. Jean Talairach, a psychiatrist who eventually trained as a neurosurgeon, was the first to describe anterior capsulotomy in 1949. He operated in several hospitals outside of Paris, including the Sarthe Psychiatric Hospital and the Public Institution of Mental Health in the Lille region. He developed stereotactic surgery, notably stereo-electroencephalography, for epilepsy surgery but also to treat psychiatric patients using stereotactic lesioning with radiofrequency ablation or radioactive seeds of yttrium-90. The evolution of functional neurosurgery has been marked by the development of deep brain stimulation, in particular for obsessive-compulsive disorder, replacing the former lesional stereotactic procedures. The history of Sainte-Anne Hospital's Neurosurgery Department sheds\n\nFurther contributions to a new tectonic interpretation of the Sainte Victoire Mountain (Provence, France)\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nRicour, J.; Monteau, R.; Laville, P.; Agryriadis, I.\n\n2016-10-01\n\nA new tectonic interpretation of the Sainte Victoire Mountain (north of Marseille, south eastern France) is proposed, principally invoking vertical movements and providing evidence which suggests an uplift which may be still active today in the western part.

Many theories have been advanced concerning the history and the dating of this unusual monument. A recent building survey, carried out during restoration work, has managed to clarify the main phases of its evolution. The rotunda, with eleven central pillars placed around the reliquary monument, was added onto the west end of an existing church during the 1040âs. The two upper stories of the central cage, however, were not finished until the early 12th century. During the second half of the 12th century, the church was extensively\n\nRazvoj suvremenog menadÅ¾menta trgovine na malo\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nSegetlija, Zdenko\n\n2009-01-01\n\nRazvoj koncentracije u trgovini na malo doveo je do daljnjih promjena u njezinoj strukturi te, u skladu s tim, i do promjena u upravljanju gospodarskim subjektima u trgovini na malo.

He joined the Jesuits as a donnÃ© or volunteer worker in 1640 and served in the then tiny colony of Quebec as one of the first medical workers of Canada. After earning meritorious praise for his skills, he again volunteered to attend the Hurons at Sainte Marie, a mission far beyond the frontiers. RenÃ©'s canoe party was ambushed. He was captured by the Mohawks and endured eight weeks of cruel torture before being killed on September 29, 1642.

Then, 1 Î¼g of p-bFGF-SAINT-18 was prepared and implanted into the rat corneal stroma 1.5 mm from the limbus on the same side. The inhibition of NV was observed and quantified from days 1 to 60. Biomicroscopic examination, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze the 18-kDa bFGF, 50-kDa PEDF and VEGF protein expression. No inhibition activity for normal limbal vessels was noted. Subconjunctival injection with the combination of bevacizumab and p-PEDF-SAINT-18 successfully inhibited corneal NV. The bFGF and PEDF genes were successfully expressed as shown by western blot analysis, and a mild immune response to HLA-DR was shown by immunohistochemistry. We concluded that the combination of bevacizumab and p-PEDF-SAINT-18 may have more potent and prolonged antiangiogenic effects, making it possible to reduce the frequency of subconjunctival.Bevacizumab, a 149-kDa protein, is a recombinant humanized monoclonalantibody to VEGF.

Ensuring the accuracy of the dating method is of the utmost importance in order to achieve results which are pertinent enough to have archaeological significance. This paper deals with an archaeological building study of the first church built on the Mont-Saint-Michel (France) and improvements made to the TL-protocol in Bordeaux. The aim is to achieve precise dates for the material under analysis and therefore, a better understanding of the evolution of the building. For this study, 14 bricks have been sampled from eight different masonries and submitted for TL dating analysis. With the exception of one sample which appears to be non-contemporaneous to the others, the date results range from 900{+-}80 to 1020{+-}60 AD. The results were then averaged according to the two phases established by the archaeological building study.

Egg mats were placed on the river bottom during the spring and fall at historic spawning areas and candidate fish spawning habitat restoration sites throughout both rivers. Widespread evidence was found of lithophilic spawning by numerous native fish species, including walleye (Sander vitreus), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), suckers (Catostomidae spp.), and trout-perch (Percopsis omiscomaycus). Walleye, lake whitefish, and suckers spp. spawned in nearly every region of each river in all years on both reef and nonreef substrates. Lake sturgeon eggs were collected almost exclusively over constructed reefs. Catch-per-unit effort of walleye, lake whitefish, and sucker eggs was much greater in the Detroit River than in the Saint Clair River, while Saint Clair River sites supported the greatest collections of lake sturgeon eggs. Collections during this study of lake sturgeon eggs on man-made spawning reefs suggest that artificial reefs may be an effective tool for restoring fish populations in the Detroit and Saint Clair Rivers; however, the quick response of lake sturgeon to spawn on newly constructed reefs and the fact that walleye, lake whitefish, and sucker eggs were often collected over substrate with little interstitial space to protect eggs from siltation and predators suggests that lack of suitable spawning habitat may continue to limit reproduction of lithophilic-spawning fish species in the Saint Clair-Detroit River System.\n\nLes diffÃ©rentes Ã©chelles de lâespace de la villÃ©giature balnÃ©aireÂ : lâexemple de la cÃ´te dâEmeraude\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIsabelle Barbedor\n\n2012-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Figure 1Extrait deÂ : France.

The amber exhibits different types of microbial inclusions. The clays contain several conifers including the genera Brachyphyllum, Frenelopsis and Glenrosa, and a few leaf fragments of eudicot angiosperms. Among the plant meso-fossils the occurrence of Costatheca, Spermatites and abundant, diverse, megaspores, including species of Ariadnaesporites, Bacutriletes, Echitriletes, Erlansonisporites, Maexisporites, Minerisporites and Verrutriletes, is noteworthy. Pollen grains of the Normapolles group are important components of the palynomorph assemblage. The clays were deposited in a calm, estuarine or lagoonal, muddy environment. The overlying lignitic sands contain large fossil wood pieces of the conifer Agathoxylon, small solitary corals, fragmentary oysters and pectinids, echinoid spines, a few teeth of marine selachians and bony fishes, but no amber is present. These sands were deposited in a high-energy coastal marine environment.

This plan is implemented and developed by the Prefect in case of nuclear accident (or incident leading to a potential accident), the impact of which extending beyond the facility perimeter. It represents a special section of the organisation plan for civil protection response (ORSEC plan). The PPI foresees the necessary measures and means for crisis management during the first hours following the accident and is triggered by the Department Prefect according to the information provided by the facility operator. Its aim is to protect the populations leaving within 10 km of the facility against a potential radiological hazard. The PPI describes: the facility, the intervention area, the protection measures for the population, the conditions of emergency plan triggering, the crisis organisation, the action forms of the different services, and the post-accident stage.

Born near Palermo to African slaves, this lay brother of a Sicilian franciscan convent, died in the odor of sanctity in 1589. His immediate popularity, encouraged both by the Church and by the Hispanic monarchy, was considerable within the communities of slaves and free blacks. Benedict was beatified in 1743, event which was followed by numerous celebrations and his eventual canonization in 1807. The fervour which surrounded him fade gradually because of the competition represented by the devotion to other black saints and by the very visible decline of slavery. However, thanks to the efforts of the franciscan order, the worship of Saint BenoÃ®t of Palermo continued until our days, particularly in Galicia.\n\nAssets of geothermal energy for buildings: heating, cooling and domestic hot water\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis publication first proposes a brief overview on the status, context and perspectives of geothermal energy in France by evoking the great number of heat pumps installed during the last decades and the choice made by public and private clients for this source of heating and cooling.

Analysis of 20 European colonists buried at Saint Croix Island in New France during the winter of 1604-1605, accompanied by their leader Samuel de Champlain's eyewitness account of their symptoms, provided the opportunity to document lesions of adult scurvy within a tightly dated historical context. Previous diagnoses of adult scurvy have relied predominantly on the presence of periosteal lesions of the lower limbs and excessive antemortem tooth loss. Our analysis suggests that, when observed together, reactive lesions of the oral cavity associated with palatal inflammation and bilateral lesions at the mastication muscle attachment sites support the differential diagnosis of adult scurvy. Antemortem loss of the anterior teeth, however, is not a reliable diagnostic indicator. Employing a biocultural interpretive approach, analysis of these early colonists' skeletal remains enhances current understanding of the methods that medical practitioners used to treat the disorder during the Age of Discovery, performing rudimentary oral surgery and autopsies. Although limited by a small sample and taphonomic effects, this analysis strongly supports the use of weighted paleopathological criteria to diagnose adult scurvy based on the co-occurrence of specific porotic lesions.

P.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In the article a rare copy of an old-printed edition of âLife of Saint Volodymyrâ, published circa 1670 in the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra printing-house is characterized. The copy was included to Corpus of Lives of the Saints of the17th-18th centuries from the collection of Church and Archeological museum of Kyiv Ecclesiastical Academy (Fond 301, Unit 416L. According to the modern advances of codicology, archeology, filigranology it became possible to critically review the data of descriptions, which brought new results. The approximate dating of the old-printed edition, which has no title and imprint, is confirmed. The publishing history of âLife of Saint Volodymyrâ is analyzed. The research of the copy is accompanied by the complex description of overall manuscript hagiography codex, the analysis of its content, specifics, ownership notes and paper filigrees. Archeographic analysis of Corpus of Lives of the Saints was combined with study of formation of Ukrainian hagiography complex of the second half of the 17th - the early 18th centuries.\n\nAssessing the role of benthic filter feeders on phytoplankton production in a shellfish farming site: Mont Saint Michel Bay, France\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCugier, Philippe; Struski, Caroline; Blanchard, Michel; MazuriÃ©, Joseph; Pouvreau, StÃ©phane; Olivier, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Trigui, Jihane R.; ThiÃ©baut, Eric\n\n2010-07-01\n\nThe macrobenthic community of Mont Saint Michel Bay (English Channel, France) is mainly dominated by filter feeders, including cultivated species (oysters and mussels). An ecological model of the bay was developed, coupling a 2D hydro-sedimentary model and two biological models for primary production and filter-feeder filtration. The filter-feeder model includes three cultivated species ( Mytilus edulis, Crassostrea gigas and Ostrea edulis), one invasive species ( Crepidula fornicata) and eight wild native species ( Abra alba, Cerastoderma edule, Glycymeris glycymeris, Lanice conchilega, Macoma balthica, Paphia rhomboides, Sabellaria alveolata, andSpisula ovalis). For cultivated and invasive species, the production of biodeposits was computed to assess their role in restimulating primary production. Chlorophyll a concentrations appeared to be strongly controlled by the filter feeders. When the pressure of each benthic compartment on phytoplankton was estimated separately wild species and the invasive slipper limpet C.fornicata were shown to be key elements in the control of primary production. Conversely, the role of cultivated species, particularly oysters, was weaker. Feedback due to the mineralization of biodeposits also appears to be crucial to fully evaluate the role of filter feeders in primary production.\n\nResults of the radiological survey at 14 Saint Ann Place, Rochelle Park, New Jersey (MJ032)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFoley, R.D.; Floyd, L.M.\n\n1990-03-01\n\nMaywood Chemical Works (MCW) of Maywood, New Jersey, generated process wastes and residues associated with the production and refining of thorium and thorium compounds from monazite ores from 1916 to 1956.

These mortalities occur at the spawning season, when the abalone immune system is depressed, and when temperatures exceed 17Â Â°C, leading to favorable conditions for V.Â harveyi proliferation. In order to identify mechanisms of disease resistance, experimental successive infections were carried out on two geographically distinct Brittany populations: one that has suffered recurrent mortalities (Saint-Malo) and one that has not been impacted by the disease (MolÃ¨ne). Furthermore, abalone surviving these two successive bacterial challenges and uninfected abalone were used for several post-infection analyses. The Saint-Malo population was found to be resistant to V.Â harveyi infection, with a survival rate of 95% compared to 51% for MolÃ¨ne. While inÂ vitro quantification of phagocytosis by flow cytometry showed strong inhibition following the first infection, no inhibition of phagocytosis was observed following the second infection for Saint-Malo, suggesting an immune priming effect. Moreover, assays of phagocytosis of GFP-labelled V.Â harveyi performed two months post-infection show an inhibition of phagocytosis by extracellular products of V.Â harveyi for uninfected abalone, while no effect was observed for previously infected abalone from Saint-Malo, suggesting that the effects of immune priming may last upwards of two months. Detection of V.Â harveyi by qPCR showed that a significantly greater number of abalone from the susceptible population were positive for V.Â harveyi in the gills, indicating that portal of entry effectors may play a role in resistance to the disease. Collectively, these results suggest a potential synergistic effect of gills and hemolymph in the resistance of H.Â tuberculata against V.Â harveyi with an important involvement of the gills, the portal of entry of the bacteria.

In the past, one has paid an almost maniacal attention to the point of the physical appearance of the king, looking in some images for a reflection of, or indeed a portrait of Saint Louis. Or, on the contrary and more recently, one has denied any validity to this trend of studies. In line with the essay I devoted on this question in the catalogue of the recent exhibition on Saint Louis in Paris, I would like here to go further in the analysis, especially regarding the meaning of details of the dress and bodily features of the saint king.\n\nGateway to the Syriac Saints: A Database Project\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJeanne-Nicole Mellon Saint-Laurent\n\n2016-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This article describes The Gateway to the Syriac Saints, a database project developed by the Syriac Reference Portal (www.syriaca.org. It is a research tool for the study of Syriac saints and hagiographic texts. The Gateway to the Syriac Saints is a two-volume database: 1 Qadishe and 2 Bibliotheca Hagiographica Syriaca Electronica (BHSE. Hagiography, the lives of the saints, is a multiform genre. It contains elements of myth, history, biblical exegesis, romance, and theology. The production of saintsâ lives blossomed in late antiquity alongside the growth of the cult of the saints. Scholars have attended to hagiographic traditions in Greek and Latin, but many scholars have yet to discover the richness of Syriac hagiographic literature: the stories, homilies, and hymns on the saints that Christians of the Middle East told and preserved. It is our hope that our database will give scholars and students increased access to these traditions to generate new scholarship. The first volume, Qadishe or âsaintsâ in Syriac, is a digital catalogue of saints or holy persons venerated in the Syriac tradition. Some saints are native to the Syriac-speaking milieu, whereas others come from other linguistic or cultural traditions. Through the translation of their hagiographies and the diffusion of saintsâ cults in the late antique world, saints were adopted, âimported,â and appropriated into Syriac religious memory. The second volume, the BHSE, focuses on Syriac hagiographic texts. The BHSE contains the titles of over 1000 Syriac stories, hymns, and homilies on saints. It also includes authorsâ or hagiographersâ names, the first and last lines of the texts (in Syriac, English, and French, bibliographic information, and the names of the manuscripts containing these hagiographic works. We have also listed modern and ancient translations of these works. All of the data in the Gateway to the Syriac Saints has been encoded in TEI, and it is fully\n\nActors of the hydrogen sector in France; Les acteurs de l'hydrogene en France\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNONE\n\n2010-07-01\n\nThis document proposes brief presentations (web site address, activities) of actors operating in the hydrogen sector in France.

Its availability reaches 90% and the plant has worked about 160000 hours without any major incident or failure. It has provided more than 16 TWh and it provides each year about 600 GWh to the national network. Because its functioning introduces some modifications of the natural tide conditions in the Rance estuary, EdF applies specific procedures to limit its environmental impact. The paper recalls the basic principles of the tidal power and the characteristics of the Rance plant which is the biggest in the world and which produces electric power during both the flood and the ebb. The economical aspects of the project are also described and replaced in their historical context. Other future projects of tidal plants in UK, Canada and Argentina are evoked.

In France, knowledge on herbal medicine, including that of ginseng, was shaped under the influence of the modern state's policy and institution: mercantilism and the AcadÃ©mie royale des sciences. The knowledge of herbal medicine developed as an important part of the mercantilist policy supported systematically by the AcadÃ©mie. The East Asian ginseng, renowned as a panacea, was first introduced into France in the 17th century, initially in a roundabout way through transportation and English and Dutch publications of travel tales from various foreign countries. The publication activity was mainly conducted by ThÃ©venot company with the intention to meet the needs of French mercantilism promoted by Colbert. It also implied interests on medicine in order to bolster the people's health. The ThÃ©venot company's activity thus offered vital information on plants and herbs abroad, one of which was ginseng. Furthermore, with Louis XIV's dispatching of the Jesuit missionaries to East Asia, the Frenchmen were able to directly gather information on ginseng. These information became a basis for research of the AcadÃ©mie. In the AcadÃ©mie, founded in 1666 by Colbert, the king's physicians and botanists systematically and collectively studied on exotic plants and medical herbs including ginseng. They were also key figures of the Jardin du Roi. These institutions bore a striking contrast to the faculty of medicine at the University of Paris which has been a center of the traditional Galenic medicine. The research of the AcadÃ©mie on ginseng was greatly advanced, owing much to the reports and samples sent from China and Canada by Jartoux, Sarrazin, and Lapitau.

Adept and guardian of the byzantine style, the icon depicts the saints in their divine and human nature, but has traits that show the holiness, perfection and simplicity of their life. Given that the saints have been seen as modest, abstinent, fasting people, they have never been portrayed as overweight, but thin, with hollow cheeks and a frail physical appearance. In fact, the iconographic representations are characterized by a high ability to summarize the reality, the physical appearance of the saints being non-anatomical, disproportionate. Lately, it has been noticed in certain iconographic representations a change in painting style: to reproduce reality as faithfully as possible. The orientation toward the icon's external beauty involved the redefinition of the iconic portrait of the saints, who are depicted as human as possible.\n\nExamen de post-efecto para experiencias anÃ³malo/ paranormales con un abordaje humanista\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nAlejandro Parra; Juan Manuel Corbetta\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSe presentan los resultados de una investigaciÃ³n que tuvo como objetivos: explorar la utilidad de la terapia grupal para hacer frente a los efectos de las experiencias paranormales y explorar cÃ³mo la terapia humanista produce cambios positivos hacia las experiencias anÃ³malo/paranormales.

The French botanist Auguste de Saint-Hilaire (1779-1853) was one of the most important such naturalists; however, his manuscripts (field books) have not yet been studied, especially in the context of useful plants. To present data documented by Saint-Hilaire in his field book regarding the use of native plants by the Brazilians. Data on useful plants were obtained from field books (six volumes) deposited in the MusÃ©um national d' Histoire naturelle in Paris, France. The vernacular names of the plants, registered as \"N.V.\" or \"Nom Vulg.\" in the field book, were carefully searched. Traditional information about these plants was translated and organised using a computer. The botanical identification of each plant was determined and updated from the original descriptions and names cited in the field books by A. de Saint-Hilaire. Correlated pharmacological studies were obtained from PubMed. A total of 283 useful plants were recorded from the field books and 165 (58.3%) could be identified to genus or species. Fifty-eight different traditional uses were registered for the identified plants; the most common were as purgatives and febrifuges. Other data recovered were related to edible fruits and plants with interesting sensorial characteristics. For the few species that have been subjected to laboratory studies, the efficacy of the recorded traditional uses was confirmed. The data recorded by the French naturalist A. de Saint-Hilaire represent a rich, unexplored source of information regarding the traditional uses of Brazilian plants.

B.; Heap, M. J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Saint Maximin quarry (Oise, France) opened in the early 1600s, and its limestone has been used extensively as masonry stone, particularly during the classical era of Parisian architecture from the 17th century onwards. Its widespread use has been due to a combination of its regional availability, its high workability, and its aesthetic appeal. Notable buildings completed using this material include sections of the Place de la Concorde and the Louvre in Paris. More recently, however, it has seen increasing use in the construction of large private residences throughout the United States as well as extensions to private institutions such as Stanford University. For any large building, fire hazard can be a substantial concern, especially in tectonically active areas where catastrophic fires may arise following large-magnitude earthquakes. Typically, house fires burn at temperatures of around 600 Â°C ( 1000 F). Given the ubiquity of this geomaterial as a building stone, it is important to ascertain the influence of heating on the strength of Saint Maximin limestone (SML), and in turn the structural stability of the buildings it is used in. We performed a series of compressive tests and permeability measurements on samples of SML to determine its strength evolution in response to heating to incrementally higher temperatures. We observe that the uniaxial compressive strength of SML decreases from >12 MPa at room temperature to 400 Â°C). We anticipate that this substantial weakening is in part a result of thermal microcracking, whereby changes in temperature induce thermal stresses due to a mismatch in thermal expansion between the constituent grains. This mechanism is compounded by the volumetric increase of quartz through its alpha - beta transition at 573 Â°C, and by the thermal decomposition of calcite. To track the formation of thermal microcracks, we monitor acoustic emissions, a common proxy for microcracking, during the heating of an SML sample.

Lionfish are available for purchase in local markets for human consumption in several islands of the region. We examined the prevalence of ciguatoxins (CTXs) in lionfish from the French Antilles, a ciguatera-endemic region. The neuroblastoma-2a (N2a) cell assay was used to assess composite cytotoxicity in 120 fish samples collected from the surrounding waters of Guadeloupe (nÂ =Â 60), Saint BarthÃ©lemy Islands (nÂ =Â 55) and Saint Martin (nÂ =Â 5). Twenty-seven of these samples exhibited CTX-like activity by the N2a assay. Ciguatoxin (CTX) was confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in multiple samples that presented highest composite toxicity levels by N2a. Those fish found to contain CTXs were all from Saint BarthÃ©lemy. Lionfish from Guadeloupe and Saint Martin did not exhibit toxin activity, although the sample size from Saint Martin was insufficient to draw any conclusions as to the incidence of CTXs. In this study, we provide information about the potential hazard of ciguatera associated with the consumption of lionfish from known endemic areas. We also demonstrate the utility of the cell-based assay combined with LC-MS/MS to assess activity and to provide structural confirmation of CTXs respectively. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

El estudio ha sido diseÃ±ado a partir del enfoque interseccional, multi-nivel y focalizado en las perspectivas de grupos que experimentan mÃºltiples discriminaciones. Los resultados arrojan que la violencia tiene efectos en la identidad de las mujeres. TambiÃ©n se pone de manifiesto que en las trayectorias de las mujeres se han producido diferentes webs de violencias, que llevan a interpretar los malos tratos de distinto modo. Por Ãºltimo, se analiza cÃ³mo la edad, nivel de estudios y, sobre todo, el estigma social, se relacionan con la posibilidad de sufrir violencia en el trabajo, y con su percepciÃ³n de la actividad que desarrollan.\n\nEvidence for tuberculosis in 18th/19th century slaves in Anse Sainte-Marguerite (Guadeloupe - French Western Indies).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLÃ¶sch, Sandra; Kim, Mi-Ra; Dutour, Olivier; Courtaud, Patrice; Maixner, Frank; Romon, Thomas; Sola, Christophe; Zink, Albert\n\n2015-06-01\n\nDuring the American colonization in the 18th and 19th century, Africans were captured and shipped to America. Harsh living and working conditions often led to chronic diseases and high mortality rates. Slaves in the Caribbean were forced to work mainly on sugar plantations. They were buried in cemeteries like Anse Sainte-Marguerite on the isle of Grande-Terre (Guadeloupe) which was examined by archaeologists and physical anthropologists. Morphological studies on osseous remains of 148 individuals revealed 15 cases with signs for bone tuberculosis and a high frequency of periosteal reactions which indicates early stages of the disease. 11 bone samples from these cemeteries were analysed for ancient DNA. The samples were extracted with established procedures and examined for the cytoplasmic multicopy Î²-actin gene and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA (IS 6110) by PCR. An amplification product for M. tuberculosis with the size of 123 bp was obtained. Sequencing confirmed the result. This study shows evidence of M. tuberculosis complex DNA in a Caribbean slave population. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It may have formed a part of the collection comprising several writings by Cyril, including the Life of Saint Sabas and the Praise of Euthymius and Sabas (lost in the Greek original. This collection was later incorporated into the Great Lectionary Menologion of Metropolitan Makarij. The details added by the translator to the description of certain realia pertaining to the Monastery of Saint Euthymius in Palestine suggest a personal knowledge of that monastic complex (the Laura and the coenobium. The proposed author of the translation is Saint Anthony of the Cave Monastery in Kiev (â 1073, who could perfectly well have visited the Holy Land during his stay on Mount Athos prior to 1051.\n\nRadiological status of the Saint-Pierre (Cantal) uranium mine and of its environment.

I argue that, although Saint Lucian nurse-midwives may not qualify as \"postmodern\" according to the criteria proposed by Davis-Floyd and Davis (1996), they are nonetheless struggling with postmodern conditions as they negotiate between competing healing ideologies. I illustrate the significance of these negotiations through analyzing: (1) the ways nurse-midwives understand and articulate the healing ideologies at play in Saint Lucia, (2) historical and ideological aspects of the Saint Lucian nurse-midwifery training program, and (3) a classroom discussion during which student reported on \"bush-midwives.\"\n\nElastic and inelastic scattering of the 14C + 18O nuclei\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA. T. Rudchik\n\n2010-12-01\n\nFull Text Available New angular-distribution data of 14Ð¡ + 18Ð elastic and inelastic scattering at the energy Elab(18O = 105 MeV were obtained firstly. The data were analysed within the optical model and coupled-reaction-channels methods including contributions from most simple transfer reactions. The 14Ð¡ + 18Ð potential parameters were deduced. Isotopic differenc-es of the 12, 13, 14Ð¡ + 18Ð and 14Ð¡ + 16, 18Ð potentials were investigated.\n\nPublic meeting of September 13, 2005 at Saint-Dizier; Reunion publique du 13 septembre 2005 a Saint-Dizier\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNONE\n\n2005-07-01\n\nThe law from December 30, 1991, precisely defines 3 axes of researches for the management of high level and long-lived radioactive wastes: separation/transmutation, surface storage and underground disposal. A global evaluation report about these researches is to be supplied in 2006 by the French government to the Parliament. A first synthesis of the knowledge gained after 14 years of research has led the national commission of the public debate (CNDP) to organize a national debate about the general options of management of high-level and long-lived radioactive wastes before the 2006 date line. The debate comprises 4 public hearings (September 2005: Bar-le-Duc, Saint-Dizier, Pont-du-Gard, Cherbourg), 12 round-tables (October and November 2005: Paris, Joinville, Caen, Nancy, Marseille), a synthesis meeting (December 2005, Dunkerque) and a closing meeting (January 2006, Lyon). This document is the synthesis of the debates of the second public hearing at Saint-Dizier. This meeting gathers representatives of the different actors of the nuclear industry, ministers, public authorities, non governmental organizations who argue the questions asked by peoples from the audience. The topics concern the safety aspects of waste facilities, in particular according to the studies carried out at the Bure site, the different categories of wastes and the future wastes that will be generated by the dismantling of nuclear facilities etc. (J.S.)\n\nALICE takes root in Saint-Genis-Pouilly\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nPatrice Loiez\n\n2004-01-01\n\nTo celebrate the CERN 50th anniversary and toÂ emphasize the close ties between the community of Saint-Genis-Pouilly, CERN and the ALICE Collaboration, Hubert Bertrand,Â Mayor of Saint-Genis-Pouilly andÂ Christian Fabjan, Technical Coordinator of the ALICE Experiment, planted a tree on Saturday 16 October 2004 in front of the Jean Monet Culture Center.\n\nALICE takes root in Saint-Genis-Pouilly\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2004-01-01\n\nTo celebrate the CERN 50th anniversary and toÃÂ emphasize the close ties between the community of Saint-Genis-Pouilly, CERN and the ALICE Collaboration, Hubert Bertrand,ÃÂ Mayor of Saint-Genis-Pouilly andÃÂ Christian Fabjan, Technical Coordinator of the ALICE Experiment, planted a tree on Saturday 16 October 2004 in front of the Jean Monet Culture Center.\n\nActivities of Gaz de France Group\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAnon.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nFrench pension scheme, the company's pension liabilities in this respect are limited to a total of euro1,625 m at December 31, 2004 (against euro14,824 m in the absence of this reform).

Centre d' Etudes Nucleaires\n\n1958-07-01\n\nThe author gives the actual state of our knowledge on uranium deposits found in recent years. Till now in precambrian formations only one important deposit has been found, at Mounana (Gabon) in a series of conglomeratic sandstones belonging to the 'Francevillien'. The observed mineralization is of the uranium-vanadium type. To the carboniferous formations corresponds in France a series of deposits, among which the most important ones are located at Saint-Hippolyte. Uranium as carburans, organic-bound complexes, is contained in lacustrine schists of Westphalian or lower Stephanian formations. A number of occurrences are also known in permo-triassic formations, particularly in the Vanoise Alps, in the Maritime Alps and in the Herault, where important occurrences have recently been found not far from Lodeve. The cretaceous and tertiary systems contain uranium deposits in phosphate rocks (Morocco, Senegal, Togo, Middle-Congo). Two sedimentary oligocene deposits are known in France. Lastly, the Vinaninkarena deposit in Madagascar, known for a long time, is the only important one reported in the quaternary series.
