        "text": "It’s easy to hate the French. When you visit their stores they’re grumpy, they don’t smile and they have that hauteur that means ‘I’m better than you in every way’. When you try to ask for directions they shrug (you know the one) and when you try to flag down their taxi to catch your flight, they tell you the airport is closed.\n\nLearning to love the French\n\nBut there’s really nothing nicer than watching French people on their holidays. That’s when their true selves come out. While we might think of them as being unfriendly, even rude, it’s just not true.\n\nWatching French families kayaking at the beach, splashing in the sea, scared to jump off the high dive, we see them as they really are. After an obligatory couple of hours for a sociable lunch, they wander around the shops and market stalls, calling each other over to show what they’ve discovered. Bless them. They are just like us.\n\nThis vacation destination is the perfect place for them to indulge in all these activities. With its historic buildings and gorgeous sandy beaches you’d never know it was almost obliterated.\n\nHere comes the history bit"
