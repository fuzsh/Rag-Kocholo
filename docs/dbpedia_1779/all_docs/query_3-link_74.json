        "text": "At the foot of the Résidence Reine Marine, enjoy the Plage du Minihic. A very beautiful beach overlooking the bay of Saint-Malo. You can access the beach directly from the Residence.\n\nJust next door, you will find the Plage du Pont, located in the cove of Minihic. A small path will lead you to the Pointe de la Varde. Here you will enjoy a wonderful view over the bay of Saint-Malo to the national fort.\n\nAs for the beach of La Varde, it is wilder but just as marvellous, it has a few small dunes and is very pleasant for swimming because the sea never withdraws very far, it is ideal to enjoy the sun’s rays in complete tranquillity, a complete change of scenery awaits you.\n\nIf you want to be surrounded by nature, don’t miss the Pointe de la Varde, a unique and magical place that overlooks the whole bay and offers you a panoramic view over Saint-Malo. You will observe old bunkers from the Second World War as well as the island of Cézembre, located directly opposite.\n\nThe Havre de Rothéneuf is another natural site that is now home to pleasure boats. This cove, protected from the high seas, has preserved its natural calm and is ideal for a moment of relaxation. Many beaches form its periphery, so you can choose the one of your choice. Kayaks, sea oars and other small catamarans can be launched easily.\n\nDuring a walk, stop at the Manoir de Limoëlou, a museum that recounts the life of Jacques Cartier. Accompanied by a guide, you will discover the manor house entirely refurbished as it was in the 16th century and you will experience Jacques Cartier’s travels in Canada, his daily life at the time as well as the navigation at the time of the Great Discoveries.\n\nAlso take the time to explore the famous 300 carved rocks (rochers sculptés) of the Abbé Fouré created at the end of the 19th century, they are said to represent a Corsair family’s story from the 16th century as the legend indicates, a real invitation to discover a raw and original art."
