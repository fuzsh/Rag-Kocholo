        "text": "Metropolitan. Maritime. Mystical. Those are the three faces of France’s rugged northwest corner, where Arthurian legends, stone circles and Celtic traditions suffuse the forests and fishing villages. Now they are closer than ever, thanks to the two-year-old LGV train line, which links Paris to the regional capital of Rennes in just 90 minutes. On arrival, you step into an attractive university city of riverside promenades, grand stone squares and historical townhouses with one of France’s largest produce markets (which feeds a copious restaurant scene), along with a dense concentration of bars. A bit north, the walled town of St.-Malo enchants with its storybook streets and ramparts (destroyed in World War II and rebuilt), sea-swept rocky shoreline and proximity to France’s most mystical spot of all: the island of Mont-St.-Michel.\n\n2) 8 p.m. On the rue de l’Arsenal\n\nThe number of Michelin stars in Rennes has tripled — from one to three — since 2017, and the credit resides with two upstart restaurants along the otherwise nondescript strip known as rue de l’Arsenal. A dark, angular bachelor-pad space with Asian-tinged cuisine, IMA landed its culinary prize in 2018. Nearby Racines, which gained its star this year is run by the chef Virginie Giboire and is bright, white, plant-filled and cozy. A summer visit found a menu that included thick slices of red tuna with sea salt, accompanied by crunchy diced asparagus and mild green estragon sorbet — a study in freshness and textures — followed by a disc of shredded lamb with a chickpea froth as light as shaving cream (and certainly more tasty). Dessert was a trip to the tropics, courtesy of sweet-sour passion fruit and coconut cream on a financier, a small, moist rectangular almond cake. A three-course dinner was 55 euros."
