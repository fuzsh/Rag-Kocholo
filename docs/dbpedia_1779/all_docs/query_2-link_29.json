        "text": "Much to my surprise,this movie was made in 1960.I thought it belonged to the spate of war movies which were made in the years following WW2. Everything,directing ,acting and filming are anachronistic.Compared to Calef's impressive \"Jericho\" (made fifteen years before) ,\"Le Septième Jour\" pales into insignificance.The lack of means is obvious but it does not explain everything, for great films were made with a shoestring budget.\n\nSaint-Malo,Cité Corsaire: WW2 is coming to an end and the Germans know their days are numbered.So they lock all the men between 18 and 65 into the \"Fort National\" (which is part of FRench National Trust).An English prisoner tries to get in touch with the Resistant Fighters and when he finally succeeds ,the viewer has forgotten all about it.I'm not a Nouvelle Vague buff,by a long shot,but when you see such works ,you think change was necessary."
