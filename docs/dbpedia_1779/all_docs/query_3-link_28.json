Nice little Aire, conveniently located near a small town square and the bus terminus as stated. I'd consider staying there again if going to St. Malo.\n\nSubscribers do not see these advertisements\n\nUpvote 0\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nAug 19, 2014\n\n1,907\n\n5,794\n\nCliftonville\n\nFunster No\n\n32,957\n\nMH\n\nA Class Burstner\n\nExp\n\nSince 2014\n\nMonday at 6:50 PM\n\n#6\n\nAm thinking the Park & Ride Aire looks good… We will be coming from Ile de Re, and want to stay over night in La Rochelle before heading towards Le Mans\n\nThanks for the responses\n\nUpvote 0\n\nMay 14, 2021\n\n1,857\n\n3,029\n\nEast Yorkshire, UK\n\nFunster No\n\n81,218\n\nMH\n\nADRIA Twin 640SLB\n\nExp\n\nSince 2012\n\nMonday at 10:21 PM\n\n#7\n\nWe tried to park our 6.4m PVC and failed in September. We then used the park and ride facility. Good parking for MH and quite a few there. Good bus service into the old town and free with the car park entry ticket. I think you could legally overnight there and there were toilets on the site but I didn’t look for anything else.\n\nUpvote 0\n\nJun 10, 2010\n\n8,772\n\n20,953\n\nShrewsbury (sometimes)\n\nFunster No\n\n12,013\n\nMH\n\nN&B Clou Liner MAN\n\nExp\n\n2006\n\nTuesday at 6:34 AM\n\n#8\n\nAm thinking the Park & Ride Aire looks good… We will be coming from Ile de Re, and want to stay over night in La Rochelle before heading towards Le Mans\n\nThanks for the responses\n\nThis is thread is for St Malo not la Rochelle.\n\nUnfortunately Park and Ride Aire in LR has been replaced by further out at Port Neuf\n\nUpvote 0\n\nJul 11, 2009\n\n337\n\n777\n\nBasingstoke\n\nFunster No\n\n7,443\n\nMH\n\nConcorde Compact\n\nExp\n\nSince I was 18.... 1996....\n\nTuesday at 7:14 AM\n\n#9\n\nWhen we visit St.Malo we now no longer bother with the aires or parking having failed each time to get in them but use the camp site here :\n\nGood walk / cycle and an interesting site with some great history.\n\nDaniel\n\nUpvote 0\n\nSep 29, 2020\n\n96\n\n178\n\nAyrshire Scotland\n\nFunster No\n\n76,409\n\nMH\n\nAutoTrail Apache 700\n\nExp\n\n2018\n\nTuesday at 9:58 PM\n\n#10\n\nWhen we visited St Malo this year stayed over at the park and ride at Rue Paul Feval.
