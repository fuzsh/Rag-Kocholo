        "text": "The Mont Saint-Michel\n\nGranite island of 80m high located in the middle of huge sandbanks, the Mont Saint-Michel is connected to the land by a dike which was built in 1877. The amplitude of the tide is the most important in France.\n\nThe origin of the abbey goes back to the 8th century, when a first oratory was built by the bishop of Avranches in honor of the archangel St. Michael who had appeared to him. Romanesque and Gothic buildings followed one another until the 16th century.\n\nFor French or foreign visitors, the discovery of this magical place is a must.\n\nThe Country of Dol & its bay\n\nThe Pays de Dol is not short of contrasts and, to the vast expanses of low vegetation, follows the emerald majesty of the forest: the Villecartier forest, planted with beech and oak trees, is the starting point for long hikes or simple walks around its pond. Go through Dol de Bretagne, classified as a \"small city of character\", take the height in the direction of Mont Dol and enjoy a beautiful panorama on the surrounding landscapes and especially on the bay of Mont-Saint-Michel. This country is rich and the range of landscapes it offers is wide.\n\nCape Fréhel and the Fort de la Latte\n\nThe Cape Fréhel is a place not to be missed on the Emerald Coast because of the prodigious view it offers on the Bay of Saint Brieuc and Bréhat on the one hand, and on Cancale and the Chausey Islands on the other.\n\nAlso, a few minutes of walk are enough to reach the Fort La Latte by a path. On the moor that surrounds it stands a solitary menhir \"le doigt de Gargantua\". The visit of the fort with its pink sandstone walls allows to discover what was in the 15th century the lair of the lords of Matignon.\n\nAlong the Rance River\n\nFrom Saint-Malo, follow the Rance river and its beautiful tourist road of about a hundred kilometers which will make you travel from landscapes to landscapes. Resembling seashores at high tide, you will also discover vast expanses at low tide. You will find picturesque villages such as Saint-Suliac classified as \"the most beautiful villages of France\", pretty malouinières as well as beaches which will be as many invitations to the bathe and the idleness.\n\nVaried activity programs\n\nSaint Malo et ses environs regorgent de lieux d’activités. Nous sommes en mesure de vous proposer plusieurs types d’animation : des chasses au trésor classiques ou avec tablette à Dinan et dans la Cité Corsaire, des challenges nautiques tels le char à voiles ou le canoë, des escapades en mer< sur des vieux gréements ou en bolides des mers, la découverte des Malouinières : à vélo, au rythme de la flânerie, des activités sportives sur les bords de la Rance, et bien d’autres encore sur demande.\n\nLet yourself be tempted by the benefits of Thalassotherapy at the Thermes Marins or by a breath of fresh air during a game of golf or a horseback ride.\n\nExcursions\n\nDuring your event we can organize excursions, classic or fun, in the sites which constitute the richness of our heritage as the Mont St Michel, the Medieval City of Dinan, the edges of the Rance, or the Cape Frehel... You can also choose to discover Saint Malo, on the sea side, on the land side or even seen from the sky as well as to go to the discovery of Cancale and the oyster farming industry\n\nFor the more adventurous, the Viking Raid is offered to you: from the Cathedral of Aleth destroyed by the Vikings to the remains of their camp near Saint-Suliac, you must travel by mountain bike and canoe the paths once used by the Barbarians!"
