ST. MALO, Aug. 11.—It's a

strange war. To-day an Ameri-

can officer and a German inside

the St. Malo Citadel discussed by

telephone whether the Germans

should surrender. The Ger-

man cut off, and he and his fel-

lows continued the battle.

Malor J. M. Alexander, of New

York, on entering a house which had

b«en hurriedly evacuated by the Ger-

mans, found a telephone intact.

He tried unsuccessfully to get in

touch with the German Commandant

in the Citadel, but when that proved

impossible, he said to the operator:

"ft is foolish of you to keep on fight-

ing. You know you are beaten."

A German voice admitted that the

garrison was beaten, but added that

the Germans had orders to continue

fighting.

CONCRETE FORTRESS

The Citadel, the only point In St.

Malo still held by the Germans, is a

huge concrete fortification on the most

prominent headland In the harbour

area. It measures about 500 yards

by 600 yards, and consists mainly of

underground tunnels which have been

connected to form a communication

and supply system and an air-raid

shelter. It is in the Citadel that

the whole of the remaining German

forces, numbeiing now only a few

hundreds have taken cover. Trapped

on a narrow headland, their death

or capture can be a matter of only

a short time.

Last night the foreshore was almost

obscured by fires raging in the docks.

American artillery, which has been

firing day and night, had succeeded

in hitting several vital supply dumps,

which exploded, and threw off thick

columns of black smoke.

German guns firing from neigh-

bouring islands and from the citadel

were shelling areas only a few hun-

dred yards distant, and they, too,

secured hits on dumps which only a

few hours earlier had belonged to

them.

Some German troops have surren-

dered without a fight, some have

allowed themselves to be captured

after firing only a few shots. Others,

who now occupy the fortress, have

refused to capitulate at any price.
