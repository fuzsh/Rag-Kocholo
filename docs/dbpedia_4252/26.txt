One of the directors of the state-owned Russian high-tech company "Rusnano", specializing in nanotechnology, was detained today on suspicion of embezzling more than 10 million euros, the Russian investigative service announced.

Andrei Gorkov, the director of that investment company, was arrested when he was buying a plane ticket abroad, according to the announcement of the Russian Investigative Committee, which opened an investigation against him for abuse of office.

According to the same source, from 2011 to 2013, the suspected director regularly paid money into an account in a bank that he kept alive until the authorities revoked his work permit at the end of 2014. The bankruptcy of that bank meant for the company "Rusnano" a loss of 738 million rubles (11,5 million euros at the current exchange rate), the Committee stated.

Just before its license was revoked, that bank transferred ownership of real estate worth 400 million rubles to the brother of Gorkov, who was arrested today, according to the investigators.

The president of "Rusnan", a state holding that encourages investments in nanotechnology, is Anatolij Chubais, who is considered the "father of privatization" after the collapse of the Soviet Union, which is why he is very unpopular in Russia, France Press reports.

The company "Rusnano" was founded in 2007 in order to invest in promising high-tech companies and help Russia acquire other foreign trade sources of income besides energy, on which it is mostly dependent.
