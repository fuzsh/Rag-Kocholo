        "text": "Alcoa (NYSE:AA) and OJSC RUSNANO will produce technologically advanced\n\noil and gas aluminum drill pipe finished with a life-extending antiwear\n\ncoating under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the\n\ncompanies today. With the help of the Alcoa Technical Center, the\n\nparties intend to pursue the potential application of a\n\nnanotechnology-based coating for the aluminum drill pipe to enhance its\n\nwear resistance in harsh corrosive drilling environments.\n\nAlcoa Chairman and CEO Klaus Kleinfeld and OJSC RUSNANO Chief Executive\n\nOfficer Anatoly Chubais signed the MOU at the St. Petersburg\n\nInternational Economic Forum.\n\n“Complex oil and gas development projects require drilling equipment\n\nwith enhanced capabilities,” Chubais said. “Aluminum drill pipe with\n\nantiwear nano-coating would enable directional and deep drilling in\n\naggressive, corrosive environments. We expect our joint efforts with\n\nAlcoa will create a differentiated product for customers in the oil and\n\ngas industry.”\n\nMr. Kleinfeld added, “Alcoa’s deep technological capabilities, combined\n\nwith the expertise of our partner RUSNANO, will open new opportunities\n\nfor developing the aluminum industry in Russia. Alcoa is setting a high\n\nstandard for innovation and extending our product range in the oil and\n\ngas segment.”\n\nWith facilities in Samara and Belaya Kalitva, Alcoa is Russia’s largest\n\nproducer of fabricated aluminum, manufacturing a wide range of flat\n\nrolled products, forgings and extrusions for a variety of end markets\n\nincluding aerospace and automotive. Under terms of the MOU, Alcoa will\n\nleverage its Samara facility to produce aluminum drill pipe with hot fit\n\ntool joints for the country’s oil and gas market. RUSNANO Capital, a\n\nsubsidiary of OJSC RUSNANO, will contribute capital.\n\nThe antiwear nano-coating is expected to extend the life of the aluminum\n\npipe by approximately 30% to 40% in aggressive and corrosive drilling\n\nenvironments compared to uncoated aluminum pipe.\n\nAbout Alcoa\n\nAlcoa is the world’s leading producer of primary\n\nand fabricated aluminum, as well as the world’s largest miner of bauxite\n\nand refiner of alumina. In addition to inventing the modern-day aluminum\n\nindustry, Alcoa innovation has been behind major milestones in the\n\naerospace, automotive, packaging, building and construction, commercial\n\ntransportation, consumer electronics and industrial markets over the\n\npast 125 years. Among the solutions Alcoa markets are flat-rolled\n\nproducts, hard alloy extrusions, and forgings, as well as Alcoa® wheels,\n\nfastening systems, precision and investment castings, and building\n\nsystems in addition to its expertise in other light metals such as\n\ntitanium and nickel-based super alloys. Sustainability is an integral\n\npart of Alcoa’s operating practices and the product design and\n\nengineering it provides to customers. Alcoa has been a member of the Dow\n\nJones Sustainability Index for 11 consecutive years and approximately 75\n\npercent of all of the aluminum ever produced since 1888 is still in\n\nactive use today. Alcoa employs approximately 61,000 people in 30\n\ncountries across the world.

RUSNANO’s mission is to develop the\n\nRussian nanotechnology industry through co-investment in nanotechnology\n\nprojects with substantial economic potential or social benefit. The\n\nGovernment of the Russian Federation owns 100 percent of the shares in\n\nRUSNANO. Anatoly Chubais is CEO and chairman of the Executive Board of\n\nRUSNANO.\n\nWork to establish nanotechnology infrastructure and training for\n\nnanotechnology specialists, formerly conducted by the Russian\n\nCorporation of Nanotechnologies, has been entrusted to the Fund for\n\nInfrastructure and Educational Programs, a non-commercial fund also\n\nestablished through reorganization of the Russian Corporation of\n\nNanotechnologies."
