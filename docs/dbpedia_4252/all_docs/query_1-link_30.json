        "text": "The MEMBRANIUM story starts back to 50 years ago, when the USSR's Ministry of Chemical Industry decided to start development of technology and set up own production of cellulose acetate membrane products.\n\n1968 Works of shaping acetate fibers from acetates are completed. Ph.D. thesis on photo- and photo-oxidative degradation of cellulose acetates is completed.\n\n1970 A pilot continuous operation unit for production of membranes is set up at VNIIS (Scientific Research Institute of Synthetic Resins).\n\n1974 Polymeric membranes department is established at VNIIS. The first industrial membrane plant in the USSR is commissioned.\n\n1975 Gas separataion membranes lab establishement.\n\n1977 The USSR's first pilot industrial plant “Membrana-1” for production of cellulose esters based membrane is commissioned in Vladimir.\n\n1982 Start of serial industrial production of spiral wound filter elements\n\n1986 Creation of POLIMERSINTEZ as a leading instituition for \"Membrana\" center (more than 25 different industry's participants).\n\n1998 POLIMERSINTEZ initiating a production site to make spiral wound filter elements for Russian market on a commercial basis. The compilation of long term scientific background for flatsheet development along with hi end technology practice had helped to set up this venture."
