        "text": "Appendix E.1. Bilateral Presidential Commission\n\nPresident Barack Obama and President Dmitry Medvedev established the Bilateral Presidential Commission (BPC) in July 2009 to identify and support high-priority areas of U.S.-Russian bilateral collaboration. The BPC has worked to broaden and deepen cooperation in many areas of common interest, including health, agriculture, environment, innovation, education, and nonproliferation.\n\nThe commission's original Mission Statement is as follows:\n\nThe United States and the Russian Federation reaffirm that the era when our countries viewed each other as enemies is long over. Recognizing our many common national interests, we are resolved to move beyond Cold War mentalities and chart a fresh start in relations between our two countries to contribute to our future progress and shared prosperity. Under the leadership of President Obama and President Medvedev and coordinated by Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Lavrov, the U.S.–Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission is dedicated to identifying areas of cooperation and pursuing joint projects and actions that strengthen strategic stability, international security, economic well-being, and development of ties between the Russian and American people. Through the commission's working groups and sub-committees, we will strive to deepen our cooperation in concrete ways and to take further steps to demonstrate joint leadership in addressing new challenges. The foundation for the work of the commission is based on the core principles of friendship, cooperation, openness, and predictability; and we are resolved to address disagreements openly and honestly in a spirit of mutual respect and acknowledgement of each other's perspective.\n\nThe Terms of Reference are as follows:\n\nThe Bilateral Presidential Commission is intended to serve as a regular and structured mechanism to advance the highest priority bilateral objectives. The coordinators will meet at least once a year. Working groups and sub-committees should be composed of government representatives and shall meet regularly, as often as co-chairs consider necessary.\n\nGuided by objectives set out in the U.S.-Russia Action Plan agreed by the Presidents in July 2009, working group and sub-committee co-chairs should develop an initial list of priority initiatives and a roadmap for moving forward on those initiatives this year. Working groups and sub-committees are encouraged to liaise, where appropriate, with parallel structures from the business community and nongovernmental organizations, and consider their recommendations.\n\nWorking groups and sub-committee co-chairs shall report progress, next steps, and unresolved issues to coordinators at least twice a year. Coordinators shall submit overall progress reports to the Presidents at least once a year.\n\nThe composition of the commission may change as some objectives are accomplished and new ones are identified. The commission does not preclude or supersede ongoing or future bilateral cooperative efforts that fall outside the commission's structure. Working Group and sub-committee participation should be inclusive and representative of government ministries/agencies that have equities on a particular issue.\n\nAs of September 2012, the BPC had created 22 working groups chaired by leaders in each federal government.\n\nSOURCE: Information provided by BPC, January 2012 and August 2012.\n\nAppendix E.2. International Science and Technology Center\n\nThe International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) is an intergovernmental organization, created to serve the goals of nonproliferation. It was established in 1992 by the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the United States on the basis of a multinational agreement and an associated protocol. Norway, Republic of Korea, and Canada have also joined the ISTC as funding parties. The ISTC has been pivotal in coordinating efforts to provide new professional opportunities for former defense scientists from Russia and other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, with the aim of integrating them into the world scientific community.\n\nSince its inception, the ISTC has supported a program to (a) engage specialists with defense-oriented experience in civilian scientific work, (b) retain Russian scientific talents, and (c) incorporate previously isolated experts into the international scientific community. During a period of economic unrest in Russia during the 1990s, tens of thousands of scientists found themselves without adequate incomes to support their families, making them potentially attractive targets for nefarious parties with hostile intentions that were in search of technological expertise. The ISTC's nonproliferation objectives have been achieved through project grants that are designed to fulfill research and development (R&D) work for civilian purposes proposed by scientists that possess important advanced technology skills.\n\nSince 1994, the ISTC has provided financial support to more than 900 institutions with about 74,000 project participants. Funds expended for projects have exceeded $860 million for about 2,760 projects.\n\nIn the life sciences, 702 projects have been funded, with total expenditures of $234 million (involving about 10,000 bioexperts, including more than 7,000 in Russia).\n\nThe Department of State has funded 995 projects via the ISTC in the amount of $221 million, of which 720 were implemented in Russia, with $160 million allocated. Of those projects, 273 have been in the life sciences and funded at a level of $64 million. Total funding for 478 Russian projects in the life sciences (both regular and partner projects) reached more than $180 million.\n\nPermanent sustainability of the ISTC as an organization has not been among the major goals of the program. Rather, efforts have been devoted to funding and implementation of specific projects with explicit technological goals.\n\nWith regard to biological-related concerns, special attention has been given to the safety of collections of bacterial and viral pathogens in research institutes. A number of institutes have been involved in the program to upgrade physical security and biosafety systems that was funded by the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency. Fourteen projects were funded for nearly $18 million, beginning in 1999. Also, ISTC projects in the area of medicine and health care were developed following recommendations at international meetings of experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, and Food and Drug Administration.\n\nRussian institute leaders report that ISTC funding was the mechanism that helped institutes not only to survive in the economic duress of the 1990s but also to improve infrastructure, cultivate a community of English-speaking scientific managers, develop leadership, gain recognition in the world community, and engage in world-class research.\n\nEfficacy of funds administered through the ISTC, as determined by expert evaluations, has been higher than funds allocated by Russian organizations because of tax-free and customs-free conditions and transparent management of project funds. International independent audit of projects is a usual ISTC practice.\n\nThe ISTC has been able to provide effective informational, scientific, financial, managerial, and procurement services for many institutions. The ISTC developed unique mechanisms of facilitating scientific collaboration, assisting Russians in learning about international standards and regulations and in implementing them in their project practice. The ISTC developed expertise and provided services broadly in technology databases, project management, commercialization of products, competency building, and communication and travel support.\n\nThe ISTC partner program enabled private companies, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations to fund directly R&D projects undertaken by Russian scientists and institutions. Partners working with ISTC-affiliated scientists and institutes could gain access to the established ISTC infrastructure, including in-country project management customs clearance, intellectual property rights support, and searches for R&D needs (matchmaking).\n\nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND ISTC\n\nBiotechnology, including agriculture and medicine, is one of the most active areas of ISTC activity. From 1994 to 2012, about 27.2 percent of all funds were allocated to biotechnology. offers examples of biotechnology projects supported by the ISTC, completed in 2011.\n\nTABLE E.2.1\n\nISTC Projects in the Biological Sciences Completed in 2011.\n\nThe ISTC received a total of 1,359 proposals in the life sciences field during this period. Of those, 702 projects for an amount of $234 million were funded, as displayed in .\n\nFIGURE E.2-1\n\nDistribution of ISTC-funded biotechnology projects.\n\nAs presented in , U.S. governmental partners (Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy IPP, Department of State, Environmental Protection Agency) have funded 207 projects in Russia in the life sciences for approximately $122 million.\n\nTABLE E.2-2\n\nFunding of Biotech Projects in the Russian Federation by U.S. Governmental Partners.\n\nThe United States funded 146 regular projects in biotechnology for approximately $33 million. Additionally, 127 regular projects in environmental sciences were funded by the United States for $31 million. lists areas funded by the Department of State.\n\nTABLE E.2-3\n\nU.S. Department of State Funding of ISTC Regular Projects in the Russian Federation.\n\nThe main recipients of U.S.-funded ISTC grants in the Russian Federation in biotechnology were the institues that were managed previously by “Biopreparat” ( ).\n\nFIGURE E.2-3\n\nMajor recipients of ISTC project funds in biology (Vector—State Research Center of Virology, Novosibirsk, SRCAMB—State Research Center of Microbiology and Biotechnology, Obolensk, Shemyakin's Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Moscow, (more...)\n\nTargeted initiatives are a new approach.

Skolkovo Foundation and Innovation Center\n\nThe Skolkovo Foundation is a Russian nonprofit organization established in 2010 with the task of creating a science and technology innovation center in the Moscow suburb of Skolkovo. The strategic goal of the Skolkovo Innovation Center is to concentrate international and domestic capital within a hub that will nurture and stimulate the development and commercialization of advanced technologies and house up to 1,000 start-up companies.\n\nThe initiative has been financed primarily by the Russian government, which decided to allocate more than $3.2 billion to the activity from 2011 to 2015. The funds are to come largely from the state Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs, Vnesheconombank, with the state's initial commitment fixed at 88.5 billion rubles (ruble-dollar exchange rate in May 2012 was 30-1). The center's budget in 2010 was 3.9 billion rubles. The allocation was 22 billion rubles for 2012 and 17.3 billion rubles for 2013.\n\nThe project includes 40 innovation business incubators and technoparks and 80 venture funds—some of which are currently operating in various areas of Russia. In April 2012, there were 1,950 employees at Russian research centers supporting Skolkovo, which are also distributed throughout the country. This number is scheduled to grow to 2,500 by the end of 2012. At this initial stage, there is no requirement for matching contributions for receiving financing from the foundation, but the planned goal is to have 3-1 matching contributions when production activities are initiated. The number of companies that are involved is expected to grow from 20 in 2012 to 30–50 by 2015–2016.\n\nAlmost 300 companies/participants have expressed interest in the project. About 20 percent of applications by companies for financial support have been approved. Companies and other organizations with activities under Skolkovo's purview operate by laws that facilitate participation of international companies and encourage innovation. These laws provide tax breaks and administrative benefits, such as onsite customs facilitation and work permit issuance to overcome bureaucratic delays.\n\nBiomedicine is one of the main sectors of interest. Eleven of 30 grant applications for biomedical start-ups had been approved by April 2012. A total of $76 million had been invested, with each grant for $2–5 million over 3–5 years. The strategic goal of the biomedicine cluster is to create an ecosystem for biomedical innovations that consists of more than 90 companies.\n\nThe biomedicine cluster focuses on four main fields: (1) clinical medicine and health care, (2) medical-biological and biological sciences, (3) bioinformatics, and (4) industrial biotechnologies (including purification methods and industrial technologies for the production of medical preparations). Plans call for a preclinical medicine testing center for cluster residents that should start operating in 2013. According to this plan, the companies will not have to transfer money from abroad to pay for preclinical testing of medicines.\n\nThe following U.S. companies have shown interest in activities of the cluster: Johnson and Johnson, Agenus, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Dow Chemical. ChemRar Ventures has entered into licensing and research agreements with Skolkovo Foundation, Johnson and Johnson, and Pfizer.\n\nSOURCE: Information provided by Skolkovo Foundation, April 2012.\n\nAppendix E.4. Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology\n\nThe Skolkovo Foundation, the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (SkTech), and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) signed a 3-year contract in November 2011 as an important step in support of education and research activities at the Skolkovo Innovation Center. The goal is to develop a graduate-level research university, together with entrepreneurship programs, at SkTech, bringing together Russian, U.S., and global research capabilities.\n\nThe concept calls for 15 multidisciplinary and multi-institutional research centers located abroad, with partners at Russian universities and research institutes as well as at Skolkovo, to work on projects of interest to SkTech. Five are to be located at MIT and 10 at institutions selected on the basis of an international competition. The initial competition attracted 129 applications involving scientists from 360 universities in 20 countries. Each overseas center will be provided with annual operating expenses of $6 to $12 million for up to 5 years. Collaboration is expected to be at the project level, with each center's faculty, researchers, and students collaborating with counterparts from SkTech and one or more other universities within Russia.\n\nAnticipated operation levels are as follows:\n\nAnnual Funding for SkTech after construction: $250 million\n\nPlanned Faculty at SkTech: 200\n\nPlanned Students (masters and doctorates): 1,200\n\nPlanned Postdocs: 300\n\nStudent-faculty ratio: 6 to 1\n\nInstruction language: English 219\n\nThe expectations are for the faculty to be mostly junior scientists, but fulltime and on tenure tracks. Most of the junior faculty will have the opportunity to spend their first year at MIT or another leading university abroad in a faculty development program, including joint research, education development, and innovation mechanisms. The goal is to establish a culture of innovation at SkTech. Industrial advisory groups have been formed to promote ties with industry and public institutions. One of the focus areas is biomedical technologies.\n\nWhile the Skolkovo complex is private and independent, the initial financial support comes from the Skolkovo Foundation, which receives its budget from the Russian government. Models for the long-term financing will need to be developed, with the goal being a combination of industrial support for the research agendas and operating budgets, including direct funding and endowment support. There is currently no initial endowment, but there is an active development plan for an endowment.\n\nAcademic degrees and diplomas will be conferred by SkTech, with certificates issued stating that students have completed a degree program that was developed in cooperation with MIT.\n\nIn addition to biomedical technologies, SkTech will focus on the following research topics, which are also the priorities of the Skolkovo Foundation:\n\nEnergy science and technology\n\nInformation science and technology\n\nSpace science and technology\n\nNuclear science and technology\n\nThe projected near-term timetable is as follows:\n\n2012: First research collaboration centers established at MIT and other locations\n\n2012: Pilot educational programs\n\n2013: Establishment of SkTech\n\nSOURCES: Briefing at Skolkovo Foundation, April 2012; Sarah Everts, “Building an MIT in Moscow,” Chemical and Engineering News, American Chemical Society, June 25, 2012, p. 40; Briefing by Mats Norlund, Vice President for Research, SkTech, July 2012; “Can Russia Create a New Silicon Valley?” The Economist, July 14, 2012, p. 58."
