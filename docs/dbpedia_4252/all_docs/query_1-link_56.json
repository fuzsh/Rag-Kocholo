        "text": "Anna Chapman, a former spy, started this summer as editor of Venture Business News, a print and internet newsletter for Russian tech finance.\n\nAfter the US expelled Chapman and others last year for being part of a Russian spy ring, prime minister Vladimir Putin said: \"I have no doubts they will have interesting, bright lives.\"\n\nBut Chapman’s new job is in some ways just another patriotic mission. And participation in this mission – to grow Russia’s high-tech industry — is becoming more widespread.\n\nPutin himself launched a so-called Agency for Strategic Initiatives in June, providing backing to medium-sized businesses in sectors where technological innovation is important. He mentioned pharmaceuticals in particular.\n\nAccording to Putin, this is complementary – not a rival – to Russian president Dmitry Medvedev’s project to turn the Moscow suburb of Skolkovo into a hub for the development and commercialisation of new technologies.\n\nState development bank VEB will invest in Putin’s project, with VEB potentially providing funding to companies selected by the agency. Last year, VEB approved plans to deploy 20% of its lending in the high-tech sector.\n\nUp to now, Russia’s larger industrial companies have often been ill at ease deploying new technology."
