        "text": "NEW YORK–Alcoa (NYSE:AA) President and CEO Klaus Kleinfeld and RUSNANO CEO\n\nAnatoly Chubais have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to explore\n\nopportunities for applying nanotechnology in the aluminum industry. The\n\ntwo companies have identified several promising technical and commercial\n\nfields to begin pursuing together. These include off-shore oil and gas\n\ndrilling systems, high-efficiency power transmission, next-generation\n\nlighting, energy-efficient buildings and transportation systems and\n\ngreen packaging.\n\nThe signing took place during a visit by a RUSNANO delegation to Alcoa’s\n\nNew York headquarters and the Alcoa Technical Center in Pittsburgh,\n\nPennsylvania.\n\nCommenting on the results of the visit, Klaus Kleinfeld, Alcoa President\n\nand CEO, said: “This partnership with RUSNANO offers great promise for\n\nAlcoa and the entire aluminum industry. Building on our existing\n\ninvestment and presence in Russia, we are proud to be a partner of the\n\nleading Russian nanotechnology institution.”\n\nAlcoa has been present in Russia since 1993. In 2005, the company\n\npurchased two leading aluminum fabricating facilities Alcoa SMZ\n\n(formerly the Samara metallurgical plant) and Alcoa Metallurg Rus\n\n(formerly Belaya Kalitva metallurgical production plant.). Alcoa has\n\nmodernized the facilities, investing more than $750 million in upgrades.\n\nTogether with RUSNANO, Alcoa continues that modernization with the new\n\ndevelopment of cutting-edge, advanced technologies for aluminum\n\nproduction in Russia. The Company anticipates the partnership will not\n\nonly contribute to the increase in the aluminum products consumption in\n\nthe country, but will also assist in diversifying and innovating the\n\nRussian economy.\n\nRUSNANO CEO Anatoly Chubais stated: “Having been established in 2007,\n\nour Corporation has occupied a very active position in working with the\n\nworld’s leading companies and scientific institutions on developing and\n\nlocalizing the nanotechnologies in Russia. We work in cooperation with\n\nthe most renowned Russian scientists and experts to identify and\n\ncommercialize the innovative technologies that will take the Russian\n\neconomy to the next level of development. I am confident that the\n\nMemorandum of Understanding that we signed with Alcoa, one of the global\n\nleaders in the production of aluminum and aluminum products, is a first\n\nstep on the road to a very beneficial joint cooperation that will\n\nheavily rely on both parties’ expansive knowledge and expertise. With\n\nAlcoa, we are looking forward to the implementation of the concrete\n\nprojects of bringing nanotechnologies’ advantage for the creation of the\n\nnew generation aluminum products for the Russian and export markets.”\n\nAbout Alcoa\n\nAlcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary\n\naluminum, fabricated aluminum and alumina combined, through its active\n\nand growing participation in all major aspects of the industry.
