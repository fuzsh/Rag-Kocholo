I believe two or three of them will be established by the end of the year. Malaysia may probably be in one of them. Malaysia’s NanoMalaysia [may act as a partner],\" Chubais said.\n\nIt’s early to speak about the fund volume for the time being, he added.\n\nAccording to information on the website of NanoMalaysia Berhad, it was founded in 2011 under the Malaysian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation for commercialization of nanotechnologies."
