        "text": "On November 28, 2013 the All-Russian Scientific-Research Institute of Aviation Materials (VIAM) was visited by a delegation from RUSNANO led by Chairman of RUSNANO Board Anatoly B. Chubais.\n\nIn particular, RUSNANO representatives visited Sklyarov High Temperature Test Facilities, the center of competence in the field of polymer composite materials, and other scientific and production facilities including those for single-crystal casting, heat-resistant power brazing alloys, engineering and production of prepregs and PCM specimens. The guests also visited the metal physics research laboratory and laboratories for microbiological stability researches and for fire hazard researches.\n\nAcademician of RAS Evgeny N. Kablov, General Director of VIAM, spoke about new developments of the Institute, its prospects and strategic directions for development of materials and processing techniques for the period up to 2030. “Availability of our own facilities and the high level of competence of our specialists allow VIAM to deal with a wide range of tasks in the sphere of development and manufacture of materials for the aerospace industry”, he said.\n\nVIAM specialists, in turn, demonstrated to the guests the state-of-the-art research and production equipment utilized by them for implementation of own developments, and described their research work and achievements of the Institute in the materials science.\n\nThe negotiations included discussion of issues regarding cooperation and development of top-priority R&D and innovation projects, among them those involving nanotechnologies.\n\nAt the end of the visit, Evgeny Kablov presented Anatoly Chubais with books “Armor for Buran. Materials and Technologies of VIAM for ISS «Energia-Buran»” and “State Research Centers: an Essential Link in the Innovative Development of Russia”, which had been published by VIAM not long before.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n\nRUSNANO OJSC was established on March 11, 2011 after the reorganization of Russian Corporation for Nanotechnologies (a State Corporation) founded in 2007.\n\nRUSNANO’s principal objective is to commercialize nanotechnology developments and to launch actually operating businesses based on such developments. RUSNANO is a financial co-investor in projects of high economic potential.\n\nThirty production facilities for manufacture of goods involving nanotechnology were created in Russia with participation of RUSNANO."
