        "text": "THE LIBRARY OF\n\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA\n\nGift of\n\nGeorgia Railroad Commision\n\npp\n\nTHIRTYSEVENTH\n\nANNUAL REPORT\n\nOF THE\n\nRAILROAD COMMISSION\n\nof GEORGIA\n\nOP\n\nGEORGIA\n\nI\n\nPRINTED BY KOTE ft DAVIES CO ATLANTA\n\nH WRNER HILL Chairman GEORGE HILLYER Vice Chairman\n\nO R STEVENS\n\nCHAS MURPHEY CANDLER\n\nJOSEPH F GRAY\n\nCommissioners\n\nGEO F MONTGOMERY Rate Expert CAMPBELL WALLACE Secretary JAMES K HINES Special Attorney\n\ni l\n\nREPORT\n\nOFFICE OF THE RAILROAD COMMISSION OF GEORGIA\n\nAtlanta April 1st 1910\n\nTo His Excellency Joseph M Brown Governor\n\nSib Since our last annual report the Commission has heard and decided many important questions some of which will be found contained under their own proper headings elsewhere in this report A resume of the work of the Commission for the past year has been so admirably expressed by Commissioner Candler in a recent address that we hereby incorporate a portion of his remarks in this report N\n\nThe Commission as enlarged by the Act of 1907 is now charged with the tremendously important duty of supervising and regulating all of the relations of every public service corporation in the State with the people whom they serve and to a considerable degree with the people whom they employ and the investors who buy their stock and bond issues Few have a full knowledge of the vast responsibilities and never completed duties imposed by law upon the five members of the Railroad Commission of Georgia or of the requirements made upon their time and abilities or the amount of labor and research demanded in their honest efforts to fairly and intelligently decide the important issues constantly brought to their consideration\n\nThe mere vastness of the financial interests involved and the disastrous results that may follow from an error of judgment however carefully and conscientiously rendered is a constant weight of apprehension upon an honest mind and heart only appreciated by those who have felt the responsibility\n\nThere are 227 public service corporations doing business in this State under the jurisdiction of the Commission with a total capitalization of 122811878000 Of these 79 are steam railroads 57 street railroads gas electric and water companies 64 telephone and telegraph and 27 compress companies These corporations serve nearly three million Georgians in every known way that modern civilization demands The gross charges collected of the people for these services approximate 5000000000 per annum\n\nIt is absurd to expect that uch varied and important services can be rendered without friction or difference between servant and the served either as to the sufficiency or efficiency of the service or the fair value thereof It is difficult to realize today how even in the beginnings of public service enterprises we lived as long as we did without actual disorders without some intermediary or arbitrator between the conflicting interests of two such classes and with the development and growth of public demands and services today it is impossible\n\n4\n\nto conceive that there can be those among served or servants who still doubt the wisdom of disinterested supervision or reasonable regulation by impartial governmental authority\n\nAs demonstrating the need of a forum where small and large differences alike can be speedily and inexpensively settled upon the complaint of corporation or individual of a bureau where authoritative information tending to and actually resulting in preventing acute differences from arising may be had without delay or fee and as showing the uses made of the Commission we point you to the fact that during the year ending December 31st last in response to inquiries and communications addressed to the Commission and in disposing of the same there have been sent from the office 19431 letters and communications\n\nThe office of the Commission has without the necessity of formal hearing or order during the past year received and disposed of 3000 complaints and inquiries It has formally handled and given hearings in and disposed of by orders 653 complaints and petitions Of these 67 related to passenger train service 10 to passenger tariffs 68 to freight service 94 to freight rates 194 to claims and complaints as to overcharges and demurrage ranging from a few cents to hundreds of dollars 53 to depots and stations 9 to side and spur tracks 15 to street car service and fares 10 to gas and electric light service and charges two of these involving all of the lighting and power service and charges of two cities directly and indirectly affecting the interests of 50000 people 27 to express service and rates 25 to telegraph and telephone service and rates 22 to stock and bond issues aggregating 17230100000 and 60 to miscellaneous subjects not included in the foregoing\n\nThis enumeration and classification however really gives a very inadequate idea of the character diversity or importance of the services rendered the people by the Commission\n\nThe railroads of this State handled in 1909 approximately twelve million passengers They have about 1500 freight and passenger stations in the State there are about 2250 separate articles embraced in the Commissions official freight classification and about 4500 in the Southern classification by the railroads so that it can be readily seen how many opportunities there are and in how many directions for difference and complaint in railroad transporta tion alone\n\nThere are approximately 65000 telephone stations in the State used regularly by possibly 350000 individuals there are approximately 100000 electric light and gas consumers in the State The street railroads of the State hauled during 1909 approximately fiftymillion passengers\n\nThere is not one of all this multitude of patrons of public service corporations who is immune from the possibility or probability of trouble annoyance or service unsatisfactory for one reason or another and not one however humble he or she may be who has not the right to come before the Commission without lawyer or brief but with a simple statement of facts and have the sovereign State through its commissioned agents give patient and impartial hearing to his or her complaint\n\nThe doors of the Commission are closed to no one They are open to all\n\n5\n\nevery working day in the year and a formal vacation by the entire Commission is never considered\n\nHundreds of claims varying in amounts but aggregating several thousand dollars individually frequently too small to justify the employment of attorneys are investigated and adjustments secured or the lack of merit ih them shown to complainants\n\nOften important principles legal or technical are involved where settlement means precedents which become useful guides for the future These services are valuable to the carrier as well as the shipper and in numerous instances avoid the necessity of investigation or explanation on the part of the carrier\n\nFreight congestions especially in the cotton season frequently occur and during the past winter suggestions from the Commission in several instances have afforded immediate relief\n\nTelephone subscribers street car patrons gas and electric light consumers in fact patrons of every line of public service have learned the value of intervention by the Commission in even small matters and constantly call for its exercise\n\nThe corporations themselves are not infrequently in dispute with each other and one or the other calls on the Commission so that in fact and to an extent wholly unrealized by even well informed citizens the Commission has become the great clearing house for complaints where differences are impartially arbitrated causes for litigation removed rights preserved and the performance of duties enforced\n\nDuring nearly every month of the year the Commission through committees and individual members and by employed inspectors has had numerous actual inspections made of tracks equipments plants depots cars side and spur tracks in order that it might be kept informed of the physical condition of the utilities under its jurisdiction or be the better enabled to decide upon disputed questions in individual cases\n\nIt has required received examined and filed during the year from steam railroad companies 312 weekly reports of operations 576 monthly reports 220 special reports as to capitalization etc and 204 annual reports from all service corporations\n\nThe Commisison during the year has received examined and filed about 7500 rates and tariffs and has sent out 500 copies of its general orders 1200 rate circulars 3000 of its annual reports including all the railroad laws of the\n\nState and the rates classifications rules and regulations of the Commission\n\n2568 State railroad maps and 1714 blank sheet reports There has not been during the year a single appeal to the courts from any order decision or promulgation of the Commission nor has the Commission had to go into the courts for the enforcement of penalties for disobedience to or failure to observe any\n\norder or rule in a single instance It is upon this record that the relations be I\n\ntween the public service corporations of this State and the public are friendlier and closer today than for years as the result of fair laws and their firm but J honest and conservative administration But even with such conditions ex lsting we do not believe we have reached perfection or ideal conditions either1 in the enactment or administration\n\ny s e 5\n\n1\n\n6\n\nRate adjustments are not yet complete nor altogether equitable or satisfactory especially as to some commodities\n\nDiscriminations particularly as to communities still exist but these we believe with the continued growth of enlightened public opinion will at no distant date be removed\n\nIn the interest of the public and the public service corporation additional legislation might be profitably considered\n\nt\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nPossibly this Commission would feel some diffidence in volunteering recommendations such as below set forth but it will be observed that in the original act of 1879 by which this Commission was created it is provided that it shall be the duty of the Commission To recommend from time to time such legislation as they may deem advisable It has been suggested that this provision being the first historically of its kind has been copied or found its way into the act creating Railroad Commissions of other States and in fact is found in almost the identical words in the act of Congress subsequently enacted creating the Interstate Commerce Commission It has been found highly useful and is everywhere acted upon and sanctioned in practice Where defects exist in the law as must necessarily be the case in developing a system like this experience on the part of the body charged with administration of the law would be the first to discover such defects and it was in a wise intent for the public good that the framers of the act of 1879 inserted such a provision At all events it will be observed that these recommendations are made and submitted under the imperative behests of the statutes and we beg leave to add are the result of the earnest convictions of the utility and wisdom of the same\n\nREQUIRING RAILROADS TO ISSUE THROUGH BILLS OF LADING ETC\n\nPublic convenience comfort and the proper facilities in the transportation and handling of freight and passengers demand that some progress be made along the line of issuing through bills of lading and the issuing of coupon passenger tickets and checking baggage through to destination Our courts have decided that under the law as it stands at present railroads can not be required to issue through bills of lading\n\nThe Commission therefore recommends that such legislation be enacted aswill confer upon the Commission the authority to require through bills of lading and the issuance of coupon passenger tickets and the checking of baggage through to destination in such cases where the ends of justice and public convenience requires It to be done\n\nREQUIRING ONE RAILROAD TO ACCEPT SHIPMENTS FROM ANOTHER\n\nAuthority should be given the Commission to require one railroad to accept shipments of freight from another railroad where routing instructions are given It frequently happens that a shipper desires his freight to go by a certain route on account of terminal facilities of the last carrier and for other\n\n7\n\nreason But some carriers refuse to render or accept shipments where hy so doing it deprives them of the long haul But in declining to follow routing instructions the shipper is deprived hy the carrier of the terminal facilities at destination when by reason of those facilities the shippers commodity commands a more remunerative price It seems therefore that the carrier having those superior facilities should be required to accept freight and place same at destination at such points as will be more advantageous to the shipper A shipment of melons for instance originating on some road having no adequate terminal facilities at the point of destination is declined by the initial line to be turned over to a connecting road having such facilities at destination because the initial road will lose the long haul The cars arrive at destination and are placed a mile or two miles further from the desired point for unloading than would be the case if the connecting road having proper terminal facilities had received and delivered the ear at destination The shipper is very much injured by this refusal The Commission should have authority to exercise its reasonable discretion in requiring such service in a given case where the circumstances justify its exercise\n\nMISQUOTING RATES\n\nWe also recommend that the Commission be given authority to make rules against the practice of misquoting rates It frequently happens that a rate is quoted to a shipper and the shipper acting on the faith of that quotation makes the shipment only to be informed when the freight reaches destination that the raie was quoted lower than it really was and the carrier demands and collects a higher rate The Commission should be given the discretion if it should appear that it was intentionally misquoted to fix a penalty by rule or otherwise for habitually misquoting rates\n\nOVERCHARGES AND LOSSES IN FREIGHT\n\nThe Commission recommends additional legislation on the subject of overcharges and losses in freight Under the peculiar wording of the Act of 1907 with reference to this subject it is extremely difficult if not impossible to formulate a rule that would stand the tests of the courts That Act declares that it the Commission shall have authority to fix penalties for neglect on the part of Railroad Companies to adjust overcharges and losses or failure to decline to do so if deemed unjust in a reasonable time We recommend that this language be repealed and the following or similar language be substituted therefor\n\nIt the Commission shall have authority to order all railroad companies and other corporations under the jurisdiction of the Commission to pay all just claims for overcharges and losses and to fix penalties by rule or order or both for failure to pay when so required\n\nTRACK INSPECTION\n\nNothing in connection with the transportation question is of more importance to the traveling or shipping public than Safety Surely the lives and property of the citizens of the State should he safeguarded as much as possible This is of vital importance and while the Commission has authority to inquire into the adequacy security and accommodation of the service the Legislature has as yet provided no fund put of which it could by a thorough system of inspections insure the safety of roadbed equipment and service of the various roads doing business in this State It is true the Commission has from time to time had inspections made in certain instances out of the contingent fund allowed the Commission But this fund is totally inadequate for the needs of the situation The inspections already made have been thorough and have added much to the safety and security of the traveling public With the limited fund on hand the inspector of the Commission has been able to go over but a few of the many lines in Georgia but on foot he has walked each track inspected and noted each bolt bar or tie broken or misplaced and the authorities informed by the Commission with detailed information as to the insecurity of roadbed rolling stock etc if such existed and they were ordered to place same in safe condition within a reasonable time In every instance to date the roads have cheerfully cooperated with the Commission in endeavoring to have such defects as existed remedied The result has been an incalculable benefit to the public in the way of safety and service and few if any wrecks have occurred on the roads inspected\n\nThis work could be extended with great profit to the public if the Legislature would only provide a permanent fund for an inspector not only of railroad tracks bridges trestles and equipment but also of electric light and gas light plants Experts are often needed by the Commission in passing upon complaints as to this branch of the public service\n\nIt is hoped therefore the Legislature will provide an adequate sum for these much needed purposes\n\nSTOCK AND BOND ISSUES\n\nIn some instances where the Commission acting under power conferred by the Act of August 22nd 1907 has authorized an issue of stocks or bonds by petitioning company or companies and they after obtaining approval therefor have not exercised this important authority or acted under it in any way caused doubtless by failure in negotiations change or death of parties or other intervening events\n\nThe Special Counsel Judge Hines has expressed the opinion that power of revocation for such nonuser does not exist under the present law\n\nIt would seem that according to the declared policy of the State such a high corporate power as to issue stocks and bonds and thereby increase capitalization ought not to slumber and be allowed to run on indefinitely and possibly for years without any report or supervision of the same by the State Circumstances and conditions will nearly always change as the years go by and what\n\n9\n\nmay be expedient and wise in any given case today may become very unwise and inexpedient in even the near future\n\nIn order to remove all doubt on the subject we recommend that by appropriate amendment to existing law discretionary power be conferred on the Commission for revoking after hearing had the authority to issue stocks or bonds either or both where there has been heretofore or may be hereafter no exercise or bonafide part exercise of such power by the petitioning company or corporations within two years from date of the order or permission of this Commission authorizing the same\n\nPOWER PLANTS\n\nThe Act of 1907 enlarges and extends The Powers and Duties previously conferred by law on the Railroad Commission so as to include street railways and other public service companies therein severally mentioned and enumerated as set out in Section 5 of that Act concluding with the words Electric Light and Power Plants FURNISHING SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC\n\nIt has been found that under the wording of said section at least one such power plant is exempted from jurisdiction of the Commission by reason of th fact that it does not furnish power or service directly to the public but sells all its power to another party or company which latter furnishes the same to the public\n\nThere may be other cases where the same conditions exist and it would seem that as long as the language or wording of the statute remains as above quoted it is possible for every power plant to escape supervision in the same waythat\n\nis by itself furnishing nothing to the public but selling its entire product to an intervening company as in the instance above quoted\n\nThese power companies are of great and growing importance they are calling for large stock and bond issues they have in some instances the power of eminent domain and in many ways they affect the public welfare and safety\n\nThere should be no doubt touching supervision over them by the State\n\nWe recommend that the law be so amended as that all electric light and power plants having the power of eminent domain whether owned or operated by an individual company or corporation other than municipal and whether their power or product be furnished to one or many persons or parties be placed under the jurisidiction authority and control of the Commission in the same manner and to the same extent as other public service companies or parties enumerated in the law\n\nAPPEALS\n\nThe Act of 1890 provides that whenever the Railroad Commission of Georgia upon investigating any Through Rate into or out of this State finds that such rate is excessive or unreasonable or discriminaatory in its nature it shall be the duty of this Commission to carry the same by appeal before the Interstate Commerce Commission It is doubtful whether the word Rate in said act refers to freight rates alone or whether the same includes also passenger rates or fares There are other matters over which by reason of the same occurring in\n\n10\n\ninterstate commerce this Commission has no jurisdiction or direct remedial authority\n\nIt would seem obvious that wherever any citizen or community of this State suffers a wrong of the kind last named he or they ought to have relief by an appeal made through this Commission and in the name of the State taking the matters in question before the Interstate Commerce Commission just the same as where the wrong done consisted in the existence of an unjust or unreasonable Rate\n\nWe recommend that the existing law he so amended as that the remedy by appeal to the Interstate Commerce Commission shall exist not only as to any question of rate both freight and passenger but in all matters in which the Interstate Commerce Commission has jurisdiction and further that the making of such appeals in each particular instance be left to the discretion and best judgement of this Commission both as to the ground of appeal and as to whether importance of the questions at issue will justify the labor and expense of such appeal\n\nRespectfully submitted\n\nH Waener Hill Chairman\n\nGeorge Hillteb ViceChrmn\n\nO B Stevens\n\nChas Murphey Candles\n\nJoseph P Gray\n\nCommissioners\n\nGeo F Montgomery Rate Expert r i Campbell Wallace Secretary\n\n11\n\nSTOCK AND BOND ISSUES\n\nElsewhere in this report will he found the rules prescribed by the Commission governing the application for authority to issue stock and bonds Upon receipt of an application for approval of stocks and bonds the Commission issues a preliminary order prescribing notice which the applicant shall cause to be inserted in newspapers published in the cities serving the territory through which or at which the petitioning company will be engaged in business and setting petition down for formal hearing Notice of the date fixedby the Commission for the hearing is given all parties likely to be interested and full oportunity given them to present whatever facts they might desire theCommission to consider At the hearing the proper officials of the petitioning company are sworn and examination made by the Commission as to the details of the purposes and necessities of the proposed issues\n\nInvestigation of all necessary books papers and other documents and other examinations are made as are necessary to furnish full information in the premises In every case where the desired issues are approved or whatever part thereof is approved the Commission in its order approving same requires the Company to report in detail within ninety days from date of order what disposition has been made of the stock and bonds allowed and if no disposition is made within that time such report is required every ninety days thereafter until disposition is made\n\nCLAIMS\n\nBy reference to the statement of formal complaints petitions etc appearing elsewhere in this report it will be noted that the Commission is called upon to handle claims of every description In many instances claimants have complained that their claims have been pending with the company complained against for months and not infrequently for one and two years and some times longer and that notwithstanding their repeated efforts to secure proper disposition the railway companies still refuse to dispose of them Oftentimes the Commission handles such claims and upon taking them up with the railwaycompanies at interest satisfactory settlement is secured within a few days This is accounted for by reason of the fact that the Commission thoroughly considers the papers and points out to the company complained against whatever rights claimants have if their rights are plain the Commission presents them to the defendant company and points out plainly wherein and to what extent correction should be made if the contentions of the claimants are not well founded they are so advised and usually withdraw the claims\n\nLess trouble is incurred in the satisfactory disposition of claims for overcharge than probably any other class of claims and this Is due in a largemeasure to the fact that the extent of the liability of the defendant company is more easily ascertained in fact is fixed as there can be only one correct rate and the only requirement in such cases is to ascertain what the correct rateis covering the shipment out of which claim accrued When such claims are\n\n12\n\nfiled with the Commission the papers are thoroughly examined the correct rate determined and the amount of the overcharge if any ascertained and a full statement of all of the facts in the case plainly pointed out to the company against which claim is filed In cases of overcharge claims against railroad companies unless there is a difference between shippers and the railroad company as to the proper classification of the article shipped the corect rate is easily applied Where the proper charges are brought into question by reason of difference of opinion as to what class the goods shipped should be rated if the shipment is intrastate or local to the state of Georgia and therefore within its control the Commission specifies the proper classification or rating and notifies the railroad company as to the basis upon which claim should be settled If the claim grows out of an interstate shipment the Commission handles same with the railroad company in an informal way advising it as to its opinion in the matter and requesting disposition accordingly If the railroad companies refuse to carry out its suggestions in such cases the Commission informs claimants of its inability to further serve them but always informing them of its readiness to assist them in prosecuting their claim before the Interstate Commerce Commission if that Commission has jurisdiction in the matter and if not in serving them in any other way that claimants might suggest\n\nClaims for loss are handled in the same manner that is notwithstanding a lack of authority to require such claims paid the Commission always makes a thorough investigation of this class of claims and takes the same up with the campanies complained against furnishing them with the result of its investigation and urging the companies to give preferred attention to same\n\nThe same is true as to claims for damage but this class of claims is probably the most difficult to satisfactorily handle Some of the difficulties incurred in handling such claims grow out of the differences between the claimant and the defendant company as to the extent of damage sustained the claims oftentimes are made account of concealed damage or damage which was not detected until the goods were unpacked and after delivery was made and the defendant company held receipt for delivery in good order Many claims for damage are filed for goods lost or broken in transit which were shipped under a released valuation claimants contending for full value of goods lost or damaged In such cases the railroads decline to admit of liability beyond the value specified in the billlading while the shippers contend that the damage complained of and for which claim was made was the result of carelessness and negligence on the part of the defendant company and for which shippers could not be required to give release In addition to these questions there also arises from time to time differences as to the extent of damage due to the value of the goods at the time same were purchased and at the time they reached or should have reached destination claimants contending that the damage not only extended to the specific invoice value of the goods but also prevented them from obtaining the benefit of an increased market price etc Thus it will be seen that claims of this character are not always brought to a satisfactory conclusion but the Commission has nevertheless been instrumental in a large\n\nI\n\n13\n\nnumber of cases in bringing about settlements of damage claims which were satisfactory to all parties concerned\n\nClaims for penalty demurrage When claims of this character are filed the same are carefully reviewed in this office and a detailed statement made as to the application of the rule in question If the claims are filed account delay in transportation the Commission estimates the time which the railroad company was allowed within which to complete the transportation and serves the defendant company with a notice to show cause why the amount due shippers under its rules should not be paid And if the claim is filed account delay in giving notice of arrival delay in placing delay in forwarding delay in furnishing cars or under some other rule the correct amount of penalty due if any is found to be due is determined by the Commission and the matter taken up with the company complained against See briefs of files under the subject of penalty demurrage claims reference to which can be had under the Subject Index\n\nVarious reasons are given by the railroad companies why they should not be required to pay different claims filed by shippers under the reciprocal demurrage rules of the Commission In some cases the railroads decline to admit of liability because shippers sustained no actual money damage by reason of the delay that the movement out of which claim accrued took place at a time when the yards of the railroad company were congested or during a strike of its employees or that an accident to the car in transit rendered necessary certain repairs before car could be forwarded or that the railroad company alleged to be at fault exercised all reasonable diligence in transportation of the shipment and delivered same as soon as practicable\n\nnre\n\nThe Commission has never recognized any of these reasons as sufficient to relieve the railroad companies of the penalties incurred by reason of failure to comply with its rules and with few exceptions each case of course being handled on its own merits has received as a sufficient excuse for delays only occasions which caused delays that were beyond the control of th transportation companies\n\nClaims for refund of demurrage charges which claimants contend were improperly collected under the rules of the Commission are more easily disposed of as in such cases like claims for overcharge the Commission interprets its rule and applies same to the case in question and the railroad companies in nearly all instances promptly dispose of claims in line with the ruling of the Commission\n\nDEPOTS AND SIDE TRACKS\n\nPetitions for depots and sidetracks receive the same method of handling by the Commission While in these cases no special form of petition is required by the Commission it is desired always that same show all necessities for the facilities desired Each case of course stands upon its own merits and the conditions peculiar to each Some of the conditions concerning which the\n\n14\n\nCommission in every case desires information and which are investigated by It are as relates to petitions for depots the amount of business both freight and passenger done at the station where the facilities are desired the number of business firms manufactories stores and other business enterprises the population of the immediate community to be served including as well the surrounding country number of schools churches etc As relates to petitions for sidetracks so much of the above information as will tend to show the necessities for sidetrack facilities\n\nUpon receipt of such petitions the Commission serves copy upon the railway company at interest calling upon it to show cause if any it can why the petition should be granted as in this way cases are often satisfactorily disposed of without the necessity of petitioners being put to the expense of coming to Atlanta to attend a formal hearing before the Commission If the defendant company in its response declines to admit the reasonableness of petitioners request and to provide the desired facilities or if said company within a reasonable time fails to make response the petition is set down for formal hearing and all parties at Interest so notified If at the hearing no satisfactory agreement is reached and the petitioners and railroad company are disagreed as to the main points of contention the Commission requests the Committee of the Board on Depots and Sidetracks to visit the point at which facilities are desired for the purpose of making a personal inspection of the necessities therefor\n\nIf upon consideration of the evidence and arguments submitted at the hearing and upon consideration of the report of the Committee of the Board when such report is made the Commission is of the opinion that the petition should be granted an order is issued in case of depots requiring the defendant company to file blue print of plans for such improvements as will meet the demands of the traveling and shipping public at the point at interest the usual time allowed by the Commission for filing blue prints being 15 days from date of the order If upon receipt of the blue print the Commission upon consideration thereof is of the opinion that the same contemplates adequate and comfortable accommodations blue print is approved and the railroad company ordered to construct depot in accordance therewith The usual time within which depots shall be constructed and opened for the use of the public being ninety days from the date of the order\n\nIn case of sidetracks where the Commission is of the opinion after due investigation that the track should be constructed an order is issued requiring that same be put in upon the usual terms upon which the railroad company at interest constructs and maintains sidetracks the time allowed for the construction of sidetracks depending upon the conditions surrounding each case ns to the length of the track to be constructed amount of work necessary in grading and other conditions peculiar to each case\n\nAs will be seen by reference to the statement of formal complaints and petitions filed with the Commission since its last annual report or since March 1st 1909 the Commission has been called upon to consider a large number of petitions for sidetracks and depots\n\nRATE OR TARIFF DEPARTMENT\n\nEffective March 1st 1908 the Commission appointed a rate expert as provided for by the Act of 1907 Since that date in addition to the work heretofore kept up the Commission has been endeavoring to complete a file of tariffs and while its tariff file is not yet as complete as will soon be the Commission is now prepared to furnish shippers all necessary information relative to rates and rules governing shipinents not only between points in Georgia but as to shipments moving into and out of the State\n\nPrior to the filling of this new position it was impracticable to keep up even an incomplete file of tariffs as no one in the office of the Commission familiar with this line of work had time to devote to it We consider this branch of the Commissions work one of the most important in all of its duties To be able to furnish the citizens of this State with information as to rates both between points in Georgia and from and to interstate points promptly upon request therefor and to give such inquirers reliable informationsuch as they can act upon with assurance of correctnessis one of the most important services that can be rendered to the shipping and traveling public especially so since the question of transportation charges has come to be such an important item in the conduct of every business So as has been stated it is the desire and the purpose of the Commission to spare no time and work in building up this department of the office to that point where it will be of great demand and prove an invaluable convenience and assistance to the shippers of this State The office has always been called upon for information as to current rates classifications rules etc but since the creation of this new office inquiries of this kind have very largely increased\n\nThe duties of the Rate Expert however are by no means confined to the questions of rate quotations and furnishing information upon request but he is required to serve the Commission not only in matters of rates classifications and the like but in any other matters wherein his services may be required by the Commission He is required to attend all hearings involving rates either of railroads or other corporations subject to the control of the Commission and to furnish assistanc upon the consideration and determination of any and all questions coming before the Commission where his services are required\n\nWhen it is considered that every railroad company is required to publish and post at each of its agencies a schedule of rates applying therefrom and that fifty odd railway companies in Georgia without reference to the great number engaged in interstate business not operating in Georgia but which handle Georgia business and in which Georgia shippers are interested are daily making changes in their tariffs by issuing supplements thereto an idea can be had as to the importance and necessity if a tariff file is to be kept up to date of having a man in charge of this work\n\nSince the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission have been increased by Congress and that Commission has promulgated rules covering every feature of interstate transportation it is absolutely necessary for the\n\n16\n\nCommission to have some one in the office familiar with rates and rate matters to keep up with such questions if the shippers of Georgia are to have access to accurate and full information of the kind and able to secure same promptly whenever desired\n\nThe Commission from time to time has occasion upon its own initiative to investigate rates to and from particular localities and when complaints Involving rates either of railroad companies or other corporations subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission are received a detailed statement of all the facts in each case is desired by the Commission and same could not he had without the services of some one familiar with that kind of work\n\ni\n\nUOO\n\nIIOQ\n\n1800\n\nV\n\neoq\n\n300\n\nTOO\n\neoo\n\noo\n\n400\n\nSO o\n\n200\n\ntoo\n\nr\n\n0\n\nrff\n\nj g Jv Li\n\nEIM6EUA8TH J

came duly to hand This section provides that It shall be unlawful for any of said companies or corporations to issue stocks bonds notes or other evidences of debt payable more than twelve months after the date thereof except upon the approval of said Railroad Commission\n\nThe term issue means the first delivery of the instrument complete in form to a person who takes it as holder\n\nThe ordinary

maker first delivers them to a purchaser or pledgee for value\n\nThere could be no doubt that the Commission has full authority and power to pass upon bonds and stocks which have not thus been issued prior to the passage of the CandlerOverstreet Act In cases arising prior to the passage of that Act the Commission has still the power and authority to investigate the issuing of these bonds If the bonds had been sold or contracted to be sold in other words if there was a complete contract of sale although the bonds had not been executed and delivered prior to the passage of this Act the Railroad Commission could not put a stop to the delivery of such bonds In other words if the maker had made a contract for their sale which a court of equity would compel the specific performance of then the Railroad Commission would be powerless to stop the transaction But in cases of this kind the Railroad Commission still has the power to look into any transaction for issuing of bonds to determine whether any such contract of sale has been made which would be binding between the parties and which a court of equity would decree to be specifically performed\n\nIn transactions prior to the passage of the CandlerOverstreet Act the Commission would still have the power and authority to interdict the delivery and disposition of any bonds or stocks which were not issued for a valuable consideration or which were fraudulently issued In other words the Commission could interdict the delivery of bonds or stocks which represent only water and nothir g of real value\n\nI believe the

letters of the 7th and 22d instants in which you propound the following question came duly to hand\n\nHlas the railroad the right to put off prepaid freight at the flag station in the rain and not pay damage that occurs to the stuff when it is raining at the time it is being put off The facts you give are meager Ordinarily it is the duty of the railroad company to carry freight to its destination notify the shipper and store the same safely until it is delivered to the consignee If the railroad undertakes to ship freight to a flag station and it is not known to the shipper that the company has no agent or warehouse at such station to receive\n\n22\n\nit the railroad company would be liable for any damages resulting from discharging and leaving the freight in the rain\n\nThe railroad companies may be excused from a strict compliance with these legal requirements as to the manner and other circumstances of delivery by an established and known usage of their own with reference to which the contract of carriage must be supposed to have been entered in as where goods are sent to a way or flag station at which it was known to the shipper the road had no warehouse but had been in the habit of putting off the goods upon the platform for consignees who were expected to be there present to receive them or to come for them immediately upon their arrival If the shipper knew that the railroad company had no agent or warehouse at the flag station and that shippers were to be there to receive their goods then the railroad company would have the right to discharge such goods at such station and the company would be protected from liability for any damages for such goods by reason of their being put off in the rain\n\n2 Mathews Dickson Hutcheson on Carriers Sec 710 McMasters

goods in carload lots from another State into this State cease to be interstate commerce and become subject tothe rules and orders of the Commission When the goods reach their destination in this State and are delivered to the consignee or the delivering carrier for a new consideration such as a switching charge after the goods reach their destination undertakes to take them from one point at destination and place them at another place they cease to be interstate commerce and become subject to the orders and rules of the Railroad Commission of Georgia\n\nRhodes vs Iowa 170 U S 412\n\nMcNeill vs So Ry Co 202 U S 543\n\nGulf C St F Ry Co vs Texas 204 U S 403\n\nIf switching was a part of the initial contract of carriage and the switching charge was a part of the charges of transportation embraced in said contract the shipment would still be interstate commerce and would not cease to be such until delivery to the consignee but when the goods reach destination and the delivering carrier then undertakes to switch the cars for a switching charge which is additional to the charges for transportation to destination the goods cease to be subject to the protection of the interstate clause of the Constitution of the United States\n\nJames K Hines\n\nAttorney for Railroad Commission\n\n24\n\nREQUEST OF SHIPPER FOR INFORMATION AS TO WHERE TO BRING\n\nSUIT\n\nRailroad

letter of the 16th instant enclosing letter from Mr J C Kelly came duly to hand It seems to me that this matter ought to be determined by Mr Kellys attorney and not by you The matter of advising litigants as to what jurisdiction in which to sue does not properly fall within the duties of the Railroad Commission of Georgia As you request that I let you hear from me with full information concerning this inquiry I will give you my views\n\nThe nature of Mr Kellys claim is not stated otherwise than being designated as a penalty claim Assuming that it is a claim falling either under section 1 or 2 of the Steed Act Georgia Laws 1905 p 120 where should an action for the recovery of such claim be brought\n\nUnless the right to sue elsewhere is specially given vby statute suits against railroad companies in this State should be brought in the counties of their principal offices\n\nC of Ga R R Co vs State 104 Ga 835\n\nMcCall vs C of Ga Ry 120 Ga 602\n\nActions for injuries to person or property shall be brought in the county where the cause of action originated and suits upon contracts shall be brought in the county where the contract is made or is to be performed\n\nCode Section 2334\n\nMr Kellys claim does not come within either one of these classes but l think it may fall within another provision of law\n\nIf any railroad company doing business in this State shall in violation of any rule or regulation provided by the Railroad Commission inflict any wrong or injury on any person such person shall have right of action and recover for such wrong or injury in the county where the same was done in any court having jurisdiction\n\nCode Sec 2197 121 Ga 54\n\nThis is a remedial statute and should be construed liberally\n\nGiving it such construction it seems to me that Glascock superior court may have jurisdiction of the claim of Mr Kelly against the railroad company\n\nHowever this matter is not free from doubt and section 2197 of the Code will have to be judicially construed before all doubt is removed Suit will lie In Richmond county Yours truly\n\nJames K Hines\n\nAttorney for Railroad Commission\n\n25\n\nAUTHORITY OF

exclusively Assuming this to be true I do not believe that you have the power to examine or require the production of the books of these companies\n\nUnder existing laws you have no supervision over common carriers engaged exclusively in interstate commerce By section 6 of the Act of August 22 1907 enlarging your powers you are authorized to examine all books contracts records and documents of any person or corporation subject to their your supervision and compel the production thereof As you have no supervision over these two companies you have no power to examine their books contracts

letter of the 25th ult to Mr G C Stephens with the note thereto attached asking my opinion upon the question raised by Mr Stephens in his letter to you of the 18th ult\n\nIs a saddle baggage\n\nThat depends very much upon whether the judge Vr juror who is to decide this question is a horseman A horseback rider acting as judge or juror would\n\n26\n\nhold that a saddle is baggage What would be baggage for one person strange as it may seem is not baggage for another person What is sauce for the goose is not always sauce for the gander\n\nIt has been held that one pistol is baggage and that two pistols are not baggage It has been held that fishing tackle is baggage the judge delivering this opinion doubtless being a fisherman It has been held that cloth not manufactured into clothing but intended to be so manufactured for the use of a traveler is baggage It has been held that bicycles are not baggage It has been held that a pointer or setter dog is not baggage\n\nOur Supreme Court has given as clear a definition of what is baggage as I have been able to find It is as follows\n\nBy baggage is understood certain articles of necessity or personal convenience as are usually carried by passengers for their personal use What articles are usually carried by passengers is a question to be left to the jury under the direction of the court upon the consideration of the condition in life of the traveler his habits vocation and tastes the length of his journey and whether he travels alone or with his family and of the usage of the time and place and of the circumstances of each cause\n\nDibble vs Brown 12 Ga 217\n\nIf a saddle falls within the above distinction it is baggage If it does not it is not baggage Are saddles usually carried by passengers for their personal use or convenience Not being a horseman to any great extent I am inclined to hold that a saddle is not such an article as is usually carried by a passenger for his personal use or convenience and that it is not baggage in the sense of our law\n\nI return herein the letter of Mr Stephens\n\nSee also opinion dated May 18 1908\n\nYours truly\n\nJames K Hines\n\nAttorney for Railroad Commission\n\nPENALTY

1908\n\nRailboad Commission of Geobgia\n\nAtlanta Ga\n\nGentlemen W E Dunn Lumber Company vs Central of Georgia Railway Co I received your letter of February 8th in reference to the claim of plaintiff for demurrage against the Central of Georgia Railway Company In order to\n\n27\n\nget the exact facts I have taken this matter up with the W E Dunn Lumber Company\n\nOn December 7 1907 Boland Brothers shipped by the Central of Georgia Railway Company from Dozier Alabama a carload of lumber to the W E Dunn Lumber Company Atlanta Ga The lumber was originally loaded in car Central of Georgia No 11020 and eh route it was transferred to car Central of Georgia No 3568 This car of lumber arrived in Atlanta December 19 1907 and the Dunn Lumber Company paid the freight at the same time giving the orders for the car to be delivered to the Phenix Planing Mill The Central of Georgia Railway Company placed car Central of Georgia No 3568 on the proper sidetrack for delivery to the Phenix Planing Mill\n\nIn notifying the W E Dunn Lumber Company the railroad company gave notice of the arrival of Central of Georgia car No 11020 and did not give notice of the arrival of car Central of Georgia No 3568 By reason of this mistake the Phenix Planing Mill the consignee of the W E Dunn Lumber Company did not get this carload of lumber until January 2 1908\n\nI am of the opinion that when this car of lumber although originally an interstate shipment reached Atlanta and the consignee paid the freight giving an order for its delivery at the proper sidetrack to the Phenix Planing Mill it ceased to be an interstate shipment became an intrastate shipment and was subject to the jurisdiction of this Commission\n\nRule one of storage rules requires the delivering line within twentyfour hours after arrival of freight at destination to give to consignee thereof legal notice of such arrival For failure to give such legal notice of arrival the railroad company at fault shall pay to the consignee so offended the sum of one dollar a day on carload shipments for each day during which the terms of this rule are not complied with As the railway company in this case gave notice of the arrival of a different car from that in which this lumber was shipped it amounted to no notice and it seems to me that the railroad company is liable under this rule to a penalty\n\nThe failure of the railroad company to comply with this rule subjects it to a suit for penalty Yours truly\n\nJames K Hines\n\nAttorney for Railroad Commission\n\nI\n\n8\n\nFKEE TELEPHONE SERVICE TO MUNICIPALITIES\n\nRailboad

letter of the 30th ultimo enclosing letter from Hon J L Hand of the 27th ultimo touching the business license fee for telephone companies in the town of Pelham came duly to hand My providential absence from the city has prevented an earlier reply\n\nGeneral Order No 10 prohibits all free telephone service but provides that the Commission will upon application and propet showing made authorize free service for public purposes according to the facts and lawfulness of the same in each particular instance\n\nThe ordinance copied in the letter of Mr Hand imposes a business tax upon each telephone exchange doing business in the town of Pelham and owning and controlling less than two hundred miles of line of 2500 and it has this provision And also free municipal telephone service within the corporate limits including four free telephones located first in the office of the mayor second in the office of the clerk third in the office of the chairman of the Water and Light Commission fourth at the water and light plant\n\nTaking the literal sense of this ordinance it provides for free municipal telephone service within the corporate limits of Pelham for everybody including the four phones specially named Of course this would be a violation of general order No 10\n\nThis ordinance provides an occupation tax of 2500 upon telephone companies and also requires four free phones It will hardly do to say that this service is a part of the business license fee of the telephone companies for it does not say so Besides the town of Pelham can hardly collect its business license fees in services\n\nThis ordinance expressly provides for free municipal telephone service within the corporate limits of Pelham If we accept the face value of this language such service is prohibited by general order No 10 Often however the word free is used and it does not mean without consideration It is often used when there is an exchange of services Tax ordinances are strictly construed and as the town of Pelham has no authority to collect its taxes in services except its street taxes a construction will not be put upon this ordinance which makes this telephone service a part of the business tax of the telephone company So construing this ordinance it provides for free telephone service for public purpose and must receive the approval of this Commission\n\nI

Ga\n\nGentlemen In re Contract between Columbus Railway Company and City of Columbus in reference to fares of policemen and firemen\n\nThe Railroad Commission of Georgia shall make such just and reasonable rules and regulations as may be necessary for preventing unjust discrimination in the transportation of freight and passengers on the railroads in this State\n\nCode section 2189\n\nAll unjust discrimination in rates or charges for the transportation of passengers is forbidden\n\nCode section 2188\n\nThe letter and spirit of our laws require impartiality by railroads in their charges for the transportation of passengers In view of this law can the Railroad Commission approve a contract which provides that a street railway company shall charge policemen and firemen of the city of Columbus less than other passengers Why should a street railway company permit policemen and firemen to ride cheaper than other classes of people It is granted that they perform important public services Policemen guard the lives and property of the citizens of our towns and cities Firemen protect the lives and property of our citizens against fire and are engaged in an exceedingly hazardous business But these considerations do not entitle them to any special privileges from street railways The teachers of the public schools perfprm public services of the highest importance to the commonwealth Why grant these special privileges to policemen and firemen and deny them to the public school teachers Municipal laborers perform valuable services to our municipalities Why should they not be allowed to ride on the street railways free or for less than other people If this right is granted to one class of public servants why should it not be granted to all classes of public servants\n\nA railway company can not grant lower rates to prospective settlers with the view of building up the country through which it runs\n\nSmith vs Northern Pacific R Co 1 Int C Report

Southern Railway Company to make connections and restore old schedules\n\nBy section 6 of the Act of August 22 1907 it is provided that the Commission is authorized to perform the duties imposed upon it of its own initiative and to require all common carriers and other publicservice companies under their supervision to establish and maintain such public services and facilities as may be reasonable and just either by general rules or by special orders in particular cases\n\nBy section 7 of the Act of August 22 1907 it is provided that the Commission shall have power and authority to order and compel the operation of sufficient and proper passenger service when in its judgment inefficient or insufficient service is being rendered the public or any community\n\nUnder these provisions the Railroad Commission of Georgia can require all common carriers to establish and maintain such public service and facilities as may be reasonable and just and it has the power and authority to order and compel the operation of sufficient and proper passenger service when in its judgment inefficient or insufficient service is being rendered the public or any community\n\nThis it can do by general rules or special orders in particular cases\n\nThis legislation is constitutional In dealing with the power of the North Carolina Corporation Commission to compel a railroad to make connections with other roads and to furnish additional trains the Supreme Court of the United States in the recent case of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company vs North Carolina Corporation Commission 206 U S 1 held that railroad companies from the public nature of the business by them carried on and the interest which the public have in their operation are subject as to their State business to State regulation which may be exerted either direct by the legislative authority or by administrative bodies endued with power to that end\n\nIn this case the court further held that it is within the power of a State railroad commission to compel a railroad company to make reasonable connections with other roads so as to promote the convenience of the traveling pulv lie and an order requiring the running of an additional train for that purpose if otherwise just and reasonable is not inherently unjust and unreasonable because the running of such train will impose some pecuniary loss on the company\n\nIf a given service or schedule was such as to amount to confiscation if it would prevent the railroad company from earning a fair return on the value\n\n32\n\nof its property then the order of the Railroad Commission directing such service or schedule would be in violation of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States\n\nOtherwise the Commission has the authority to prescribe schedules for and to requir sufficient and proper passenger service from the Wadley Southern Railway Company and if it should be necessary to this end can require the Company to restore the former passenger schedule\n\nJames K Hines\n\nAttorney for Railroad Commission\n\nLIABILITY OF CARRIERS FOR SHIPMENTS REMAINING IN DEPOTS\n\nRailboad Commission of Georgia\n\nOffice of Special

instant enclosing letter from the Gailey Drug Company of Conyers Georgia As the Railroad Commission is without jurisdiction in this matter it can not grant any relief to the Gailey Drug Company and an opinion from the Commission on the liability of the express company to the drug company would be of no practical avail\n\nWhether the express company is liable to the Gailey Drug Company depends upon the common law governing the liability of carriers When this package arrived and the drug company was notified of this fact then the liability of the express company as a common carrier ceased and it was only liable thereafter as a warehouseman The liability of the warehouseman depends upon whether it exercised ordinary care and diligence in keeping this package If it exercised such care it is not liable If it did not exercise such care it is liable\n\nI enclose herein letter of the Gailey Drug Co Yours truly\n\nJames K Hines\n\nAttorney for Railroad Commission\n\n33\n\nLIABILITY OF CARRIERS

Commission of Georgia\n\nAtlanta Ga\n\nGentlemen Your letter of the 30th ultimo enclosing letter from Mr A A Joiner assistant cashier of Messrs J S Byron Sons came duly to hand\n\nWhile it does not come within the province and duties of the Commission to furnish opinions of the kind requested inasmuch as this claim will probably come into the courts and inasmuch as the Commission has no jurisdiction over it I will briefly state my opinion out of my high regard for this firm\n\nOur Supreme Court has adopted a narrower view upon the subject of the liability of a common carrier than is held in some other jurisdictions The rule of our Supreme Court is this Where goods are shipped by rail and arrive at destination within the usual time required for transportation and are then deposited by the railroad company in a place of safety and held ready to be delivered to the consignee on demand the companys liability as a common carrier in the absence of a contrary custom of trade as to delivery ceases and its liability as a warehouseman begins\n\nSee Allman vs Ga R R Bkg Co 95 Ga 775\n\nGeorgia Alabama Ry vs Pound 111 Ga 6\n\nUnder this rule of the Supreme Court when this car of cottonseed reached Byron and was put on the sidetrack ready to be delivered to the consignee on demand the liability of the railroad company as a carrier ceased In some other jurisdictions the rule is this A carriers liability does not end upon the arrival of the goods at their destination but continues until they have been accepted by or tendered to the consignee or have been placed in the usual and convenient place for delivery and the consignee has had reasonable time to remove them\n\nSee 7 Current Law p 539\n\nBowden vs A C L R Co A L A 41 So 294\n\nSouthern R R Company vs German National Bank 2 S W Ark 522\n\nSo far as I am advised our Supreme Court has never7 considered the question of whether a consignee should not have a reasonable time in which to remove goods after their arrival at destination before the liability of the carrier ceases Upon proper presentation our Supreme Court might enlarge the rule as above given and adopt the more liberal rule last stated\n\nIf the Supreme Court adheres to the rule above stated then the liability of the railroad company for this car ceased when it arrived at destination and\n\n34\n\nv\n\nwas placed on the sidetrack in a place of safety and held ready to be delivered to the consignee on demand Should the Supreme Court adopt the more liberal rule above stated then the question would turn upon whether the consignees had a reasonable time in which to remove these seed after the car was placed upon the sidetrack for that purpose\n\nIf the railroad company is not liable as a common carrier then the question would arise whether It was liable as a warehouseman That depends upon whether the railroad company exercised ordinary care and diligence in taking care of this carload of seed If the railroad company exercised ordinary care and diligence in protecting this carload of seed then it would not be liable as a warehouseman As the facts touching the origin of the fire are not given I can not give my opinion upon this subject If the railroad company was in no way responsible for the origin of the fire and exercised ordinary care and diligence in taking care of and protecting the carload of seed from this fire then it would not be liable Otherwise it would be liable Yours truly\n\nJames K Hines\n\nAttorney for Railroad Commission\n\nAUTHORITY OF COMMISSION TO REQUIRE PHYSICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN TELEPHONE LINES\n\nRailboad Commission of Georgia Office of Special Attorney to Commission Atlanta\n\nJames K Hines\n\nSpecial Attorney\n\nRailroad Commission of Georgia Atlanta Ga\n\nMay 7 1908\n\nGentlemen Your letter of the 16th ultimo enclosing a letter from the Moultrie Telephone Company and of the 9th ultimo came duly to hand\n\nThis letter raises this question Has the Railroad Commission of Georgia the power and authority to compel telephone companies to make physical connections and to interchange messages This is a big question\n\nThe Act of August 22 1907 enlarging the powers of the Railroad Commission of Georgia is entitled an Act to increase the membership of the Railroad Commission of Georgia to extend its powers and jurisdiction over telephone or telegraph companies or corporations or persons owning leasing or operating any public telephone service in this State\n\nBy section 6 of this Act it is provided that the Railroad Commission of Georgia shall have and exercise all the power and authority heretofore conferred upon it by law and shall have a general supervision of all common carriers telephone and telegraph corporations or companies within this State\n\nIt seems to have been the purpose of the Legislature to confer upon the Railroad Commission of Georgia the same power and authority over telephone com\n\npanies which had been previously conferred upon it by law over railroad companies This is the general purpose and scheme of the Candler Act\n\nPrior to the passage of the Candler Act there was no power conferred upon the Railroad Commission to compel the physical connection of railroads This could be done under section 2213 of the Code but no authority is thereby conferred upon the Railroad Commission to compel such connections Ry section 7 of the Candler Act the Railroad Commission has power and authority when in its judgment practicable and to the interest of the public to order and compel the making and operation of physical connection between the lines of railroad crossing or intersecting each other As the Legislature has conferred this power upon the Railroad Commission as to railroads only and has not given the Railroad Commission the same power over other public utility companies it would seem that the Legislature did not intend to confer upon the Railroad Commission the power to make physical connections between the lines of other companies such as telephones and telegraph companies So it is doubtful whether the Railroad Commission has the power to compel the physical connection of telephone and telegraph companies\n\nBy section 6 of the Candler Act the Railroad Commission has general supervision of telephone companies and is authorized to require all public service companies under their supervision to establish and maintain such service and facilities as may be reasonable and just either by general rules or by speciaL orders in particular cases This power is very broad It authorizes the Commission to require all common carriers and other publicservice companies under its supervision to establish and maintain such public service and facilities as may be reasonable and just If the lines of two telephone companies had the same terminus or connection and the public service required that they should interchange business under this broad power the Railroad Commission has power to require such service if it be reasonable and just If the public service demands the interchange of business between two connecting telephone companies and if such service was reasonable and just then the Commission is authorized to require the establishment and maintenance of such public service Yours truly\n\nJames K Hines\n\nAttorney for Railroad Commission\n\nse\n\nSTOCK AND BOND ISSUES BY LUMBER COMPANIES

Ga\n\nGentlemen I have your letter of the 13th ultimo relating to the issuing of securities by the Perkins Lumber Company and enclosing your file on this subject including a letter from Judge J R Lamar and the petition of this company\n\nI do not think that the CandlerOverstreet Act embraces the issuance of stocks and bonds by the Perkins Lumber Company The original Act creating the Railroad Commission refers to railroad corporations organized and doing business in this State under any Act of incorporation or general ActR of this State or under the laws of any other State doing business in this State Under this original Act the Coifimissioners were authorized to make reasonable and just rates of freight and passenger tariff to be observed by all railroad companies doing business in this State on th railroads thereof Throughout the original Act the jurisdiction of the Commission was confined to railroad corporations or companies\n\nThe CandlerOverstreet Act extended the authority of the Railroad Commission over certain other companies corporations and persons but lumber companies are not embraced in any of the classes over which this extended authority of the Railroad Commission is given\n\nSo I reach the conclusion that under the case of Ellington vs Beaver Dam Lumber Company 93 Georgia 53 which was cited by Judge Lamar this Commission has no jurisdiction over the issuing of securities by the Perkins Lumber Company\n\nYours truly\n\nJames K Hines\n\nAttorney for Railroad Commission\n\n37\n\nWHAT CONSTITUTES PERSONAL BAGGAGE\n\nRaileoad Commission of Geoegia\n\nOffice of Special Attobney to Commission Atlanta\n\nJames K Hines\n\nSpecial Attorney\n\nMay 18 1908\n\np attToah Commission of Geoegia\n\nAtlanta Ga\n\nGentlemen You wish my opinion on this question to wit Is an empty trunk baggage\n\nThis question arises upon a complaint to you that some of the railroads are refusing to check empty trunks\n\nIn a former opinion dealing with the question whether a saddle was baggage\n\nI gave a general definition of baggage This general rule is that all articles which are usually carried by travelers for their personal use and comfort and suitable to their situation in life are baggage\n\nWhat is baggage is often a mixed question of law and fact It is affected by the sex of the passenger What is baggage for a man is often not baggage for a woman and what is baggage for a woman is frequently not baggagefor a man For instance a razor can well form a part of the baggage of a man but it would be hard for a spinster to account for the possession of a razor as baggage A wig can well constitute a part of the baggage of a bachelor but it would be difficult for him to justify the carriage of a rat as a piece of his baggage and yet every maiden may take a rat as a part of her baggage\n\nAt most a trunk is only a receptacle for baggage Generally it must contain baggage to pass muster as baggage Ordinarily an empty trunk is not baggage for the reason that travelers do not usually carry empty trunks for their personal convenience and comfort\n\nYet under some circumstances an empty trunk may be baggage If carried for the personal use and convenience of the traveler and not for the purpose of trade and not as freight it would be baggage For instance a traveler might be at Boston and his duds at a laundry in Troy and the traveler might wish to take his trunk from Boston to Troy to get his clothing at the latter place to be used in a journey In such a case the empty trunk might be deemed baggage To answer your question definitely we would have to have the facts of each particular case Without such facts I can give the general rule Which is if an empty trunk is carried for the personal use and comfort of the traveler and becomes his station in life it would be baggage If it was carried for trade or other purpose than the personal use and convenience of the passenger it would not be baggage\n\nSee also

enclosing letter of Messrs Talmadge Brothers Company of the 25th ultimo in which you inquire whether or not it is the legal right of railway companies to demand that all shipments and each article composing a shipment where the same are not strapped or wired together be legibly marked\n\nUnder our law the common carrier is bound to receive all goods that he is able and accustomed to carry upon the compliance with such reasonable regulations as he may adopt for his own safety and the benefit of the public\n\nCode section 2278 So Ry Co vs Watson 110 Ga 688\n\nAs the carrier has the right under our law to make such reasonable regulations as he may adopt for his own safety and the benefit of the public and as he may require compliance with such reasonable regulations before he receives goods for shipments the only question presented is whether a regulation requiring that goods shipped shall be legibly marked is a reasonable regulation for the safety of the carrier and the benefit of the public It seems to me that such a regulation is reasonable It protects the carrier and is for his own safety and it will benefit the public in preventing the loss mingling w miscarriage of goods\n\nIn cases like the shipment of meal and flour in less than carload lots this may impose additional expense upon shippers but in such cases if the regulation is just and reasonable shippers will have to comply with them If it is reasonable to require the package marked with the name of the consignee the name of the station town or city and the name of the State to which goods are shipped then the railway companies have a right to make such a regulation It is probably within the jurisdiction of the Commission to revise such a regulation if the same can be done for the mutual benefit of the carrier and the public\n\nI return you herewith the file in this matter Yours truly\n\nJames K Hines\n\nAttorney for Railroad Commission\n\nCLAIMS FOR LOST SHIPMENTS\n\nRailroad Commission of

think that the railroad company can reasonably require the original Invoice to be attached to the claim for damages for loss of goods While it would not furnish a measure of damages it would throw light upon the destination value of the goods lost\n\n3 Where a judgment is obtained against the receivers of a railroad company\n\nit can not be forced in the usual way but application would have to

opinion as to the right of the Commission to apply its storage rules to the shipment of goods from without the limits of this State to a point within this State by express\n\nA shipment of goods never ceases to be a transaction of interstate commerce from its inception in one State until the delivery of goods at their prescribed\n\ndestination in the other This seems to be the rule as promulgated by the latest decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States A typical case on that point is that of McNeal vs Southern Railway Company 202 U S 543\n\nMy opinion is that your storage rules do not apply to such a shipment Your rules apply to intrastate shipments alone A shipment from another State into this State does not cease to be an interstate shipment until delivery\n\nI enclose you herein

enclosing copy of telegram from Mr J W Dillon in which he wishes to know if he has the right to refuse a shipment which reaches his place over an unauthorized route\n\nWhen a carrier accepts goods to be carried with the direction on the part of the owner to carry them by a particular route he is bound to obey such direction and if he attempts to perform his contract in a manner different from that directed he becomes an insurer of the goods shipped\n\nSecond Matthews Dickinsons Hutchinsons Carriers Sec 612\n\nIf a common carrier deviates from the regular route and the goods are lost it is conversion\n\nPhillips vs Brigham Kelly Co 26 Ga 617\n\nGeorgia Railroad vs Cole 68 Ga 623\n\nIf notwithstanding an unauthorized deviation from route the goods arrive on time at destination the consignee can not on account of such unauthorized deviation refuse to receive them and claim a conversion by the first carrier In such a case the consignee can recover from the carrier such damages as are the approximate result of the deviation Thus where in consequence of a deviation the consignee fails to receive prompt notice of the arrival of the goods their market value having in the meantime diminished it is held that he is entitled to recover from the carrier for such depreciation in value\n\nSecond Matthews Dickinsons Hutchinsons Carriers Sec 621\n\nIf goods be delayed by such deviation and damage results the first road is responsible therefor\n\nGeorgia Railroad vs Cole 68 Ga 623\n\nMy opinion is that Mr Dillon would not be authorized to refuse to receive these goods because of deviation of carriage from instructions but would be\n\n41\n\nentitled to recover any damage sustained by him by reason of such violation of shipping instructions In any event he would be entitled to recover nominal damages for a breach of contract of carriage although he could not show any such damage Yours very truly\n\nJames K Hikes\n\nAttorney for Railroad Commission\n\nCLOSING TICKET OFFICES

reasonable time before the departure of trains from all stations and it is the duty of passengers to use proper diligence to supply themselves with tickets before getting upon trains\n\nCentral R R Banking Co vs Strickland 90 Georgia 562\n\nUnder a former rule of this Commission it was provided that offices at way stations might be closed one minute before the arrival of trains and this rule was approved by our Supreme Court Railroad companies have a right to make a reasonable rule upon this subject and in my opinion a rule providing that passengers shall purchase their tickets before the arrival of trains would be reasonable at way stations where agents have other duties to perform In order to prevent friction between the public and railroad companies it would be well I think for the Commission to promulgate a rule providing that passengers shall purchase their tickets before the arrival of trains at way stations Such a rule would be just and reasonable both towards the railroad companies and the traveling public Yours truly\n\nJames K Hines\n\nAttorney for Railroad Commission\n\nJURISDICTION OF COMMISSION OVER COTTON COMPRESS COMPANIES\n\nRailboad Commission of Georgia\n\nOffice of Special Attorney to Commission\n\nAtlanta\n\nJames K Hines\n\nSpecial Attorney\n\nJuly 18 1908\n\nRailroad Commission of Georgia\n\nAtlanta Ga\n\nGentlemen In response to your request for my opinion upon the question What are your jurisdiction and powers over cotton compress companies I submit what follows as my opinion on that subject\n\nThis involves the construction of so much of the Act of August 22nd 1907 which enlarged the jurisdiction and powers of the Railroad Commission as is applicable to this particular subject The title of this Act is An Act to increase the membership of the Railroad Commission of Georgia to extend its powers and jurisdidetion over docks and wharves terminal companies cotton compress companies corporations or persons owning leasing or operating railway terminals or terminal stations over telephone or telegraphic companies or corporations or persons owning leasing or operating any public telephone service in this State and over street railroads and street railroad corporations companies or persons owning leasing or operating street railoads in this State over gas and electric light and power companies corporations or persons owning leasing or operating public gas plants electric light and power plants furnishing power to the public etc\n\nSection 5 of this Act provides that the powers and duties heretofore conferred by law upon the Railroad Commission are hereby extended and enlarged so that its authority and control shall extend to street railroads and street railroad corporations companies or persons owning leasing or operating street railroads in this State over docks and wharves and corporations companies or persons owning leasing or operating the same over terminals or terminal stations and corporations companies or persons owning leasing or operating such cotton compress corporations or associations and persons or companies owning leasing or operating the same etc\n\nClearly by this Act the powers and duties which before its passage had been conferred by law upon the Railroad Commission were extended to cotton compress corporations and to all persons owning leasing or operating cotton compresses\n\nNow what were the powers and duties which had been conferred by law upon the Railroad Commission prior to August 22nd 1907\n\n1 The Commissioners were required to make reasonable and just freight and passenger rates to be observed by all railroad companies doing business in this State\n\n2 They were required to make reasonable and just rules and regulations to be observed by all railroad companies doing business in this State as to charges at any and all points for the necessary handling and delivery of freight\n\n43\n\n3 They were required to make such just and reasonable rules and regulations as may be necessary for preventing unjust discriminations in the transportation of freight and passengers on the railroads of this State\n\n4 They were required to make for each of the railroad corporations doing business in this State as soon as practicable a schedule of just and reasonable rates of charges for transportation of passengers freights and cars on each of said railroads\n\nThese duties and powers were embraced in the original act creating the Railroad Commission They were of force on August 22nd 1907 and are found in the\n\nCivil Code Secs 2189 and 2190\n\nThis Commision has the power and it is its duty to make reasonable and just rates to be observed by all cotton compress companies doing business in this State for compressing cotton to make reasonable and just rules and regulations to be observed by all cotton compress companies doing business in this State as to charges for the receiving handling and delivery of cotton to make such just and reasonable rules and regulations as may be necessary for preventing unjust discriminations in the compressing handling and transportation of cotton and to make for each cotton compress doing business in this State as soon as practicable a schedule of just and reasonable rates of charges for compressing and handling cotton\n\nIf the Railroad Commission has not got these powers over cotton compress companies and persons owning leasing or operating cotton compresses then it is difficult to perceive that the Commission has any jurisdiction and supervision over cotton compress companies If the Commission cant prescribe rates for and prevent unjust discriminiations by cotton compress companies what has it to do with these companies If the Commission has not this right what has it it to do with these companies If the Commission has not this jurisdiction over cotton compresses it has no supervisin over them at all\n\nIn addition to these general powers the Commission has some incidental powers over cotton compress companies such as the right to inspect their books to see that the rules and regulations of the Commission are observed by these companies but I do not undertake to enumerate these incidental powers This opinion refers alone to the general and fundamental powers of the Commission over companies and persons owning leasing or operating cotton compresses\n\nYours truly\n\nJames K Hines\n\nAttorney for Railroad Commission\n\n44\n\nTRANSPORTATION OF EXPLOSIVES\n\nRailboad Commission of Geobgia Office of Special Attobney to Commission\n\nJames K Hines\n\nSpecial Attorney\n\nAtlanta\n\nAugust 14 1908\n\nRailboad Commission of Geobgia\n\nAtlanta Ga\n\nGentlemen I have your letter of the 11th instant enclosing letter of King Hardware Company in which this company claims that the Atlantic Coast Line Railway Company refuses to carry for it loaded shells as freight The railroad company refuses this class of freight on the ground that it only runs mixed passenger and freight trains to the points to which the King Hardware Company wishes to ship these shells and that on its mixed passenger and freight trains explosives can not be hauled\n\nBy the common law a carrier is not bound to receive dangerous articles for transportation\n\nFish vs Chapman 2nd Ga 349 Johnson vs Middling R R Company 4 Exch 367 6 Cyc 367 Cal Powder Works vs R R Company 113 Cal 329 Tumell vs Pettijohn 2 Harr Del 48\n\nSo if the common law prevails in this State and if loaded shells are dangerous in their transportation then this company would be justified in refusing to transport them If they were not dangerous as contended for by the King Hardware Company then this company would be compelled to carry them\n\nBut is this the law now of force in this State This raises a very important question The Commission is vested by the Steed Act with full power and authority to make prescribe and enforce all such reasonable rules regulations and orders as may be necessary in order to compel and require the several railroad companies in this State to promptly receive receipt for forward and deliver to destination all freight of every character which may be tendered them for transportation\n\nGa Laws 1905 p 120\n\nLanguage can not be broader The Commission is clothed with full power and authority to make and enforce all such reasonable rules regulations and orders as may be necessary in order to compel and require railroad companies in this State to promptly receive all freight of every character which may be tendered them for transportation All freights of every character includes all goods which may be tendered the railroad companies for transportation It seems to have been the purpose of the Legislature by this Act to change the rule of the Common Law and to clothe the Commission with power and authority to make the railroads of this State receive all freight tendered them for transportation\n\n45\n\nIn pursuance of this Act the Commission adopted Storage Rule 10 which provides that whenever freight of any character proper for transportation whether in car load quantities or less is tendered to a railroad company at its customary place for receiving shipments and correct shipping instructions given such railroad company shall immediately receive the same and issue bills of lading therefor\n\nDoes the phrase proper for transportation in this rule exclude such freight as is dangerous to transport or does it mean that freight tendered for transportation must be properly packed and in proper shape for transportation In view of the Act upon which this rule is based which Act requires the Commission to compel the railroads to carry all freight of every character it should not be construed to exempt from its operation certain classes of freight but should be construed to require the transportation of all goods properly packed for shipment\n\nThis matter is not entirely free from doubt The King Hardware Company can test this matter by bringing a mandamus against this company to compel it to carry these loaded shells or could sue for any damage which it may have sustained by"
