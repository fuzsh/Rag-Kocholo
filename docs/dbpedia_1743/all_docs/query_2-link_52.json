        "text": "Once Upon a Time, before the internet and Amazon, there were bookshops that specialised in Photo books, and the best of these was Beyond Words in Edinburgh. Neil McIlwraith still runs Beyond Words as an excellent online service; nevertheless, it is hard not to feel a sense of loss for the sheer indulgent pleasure of browsing in a place devoted to the photographic image.\n\nOn my last visit to (the analogue?) Beyond Words I acquired Edward Burtynskyâ€™s book, Quarries. I treasure it as much as my Peter Dombrovskis collection, and whenever I do peruse I am left in awe."
