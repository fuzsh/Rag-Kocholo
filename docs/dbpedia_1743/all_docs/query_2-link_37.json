        "text": "\"Please be patient with me and I promise I will try and be brave for us. Because when they write the history of my life I want it to include you and my love for you.\" - Henry to Alex\n\nPrince Henry is the son of Princess Catherine and Actor Arthur Fox. He is the brother of Prince Phillip and Princess Beatrice. He is played by Nicholas Galitzine.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA[]\n\nInstagram\n\nLine of Succession[]\n\nPrince Henry is currently third in the line of succession after his mother Princess Catherine and his elder brother Prince Phillip and before his sister, Princess Beatrice, who is elder than him in the book, but younger than him in the film. Though the laws governing succession have been changed in the Mountbatten-Windsor (our) universe to phase out male-preference primogeniture in favor of absolute primogeniture, it is unclear whether this is also true in the Mountchristen-Windsor universe of the book or the Hanover-Stuart universe of the film. See a detailed analysis here.\n\nEducation[]\n\nPrince Henry attended Eton College, an all-boys boarding school in the town of Eton, near Windsor in Berkshire, England. It was there he met Percy \"Pez\" Okonjo, who became his best friend. Following his time at Eton, he pursued a degree in English Literature (the same field in which his mother became the first princess to obtain a doctoral degree) at the University of Oxford, the oldest university in the English-speaking world.\n\nMeeting Alex Claremont-Diaz[]\n\nIn the book, Prince Henry first met Alex Claremont-Diaz at the 2016 Rio Olympics. He shook Alex's hand, then turned to Shaan and asked if he could \"get rid of him\", which Alex overheard, sparking the rivalry between them.\n\nAfter Alex spends a night with Henry in Kensington Palace, Henry tells Alex that he fell in love with Alex at first sight. Henry also tells Alex that his first impression of Alex was \"happy and animated and fully alive, a person living in dimensions [Henry] couldn't access, and so beautiful.\" In one of Henry's emails to Alex, he says \"I thought, this is the most incredible thing I have ever seen, and I had better keep it a safe distance away from me,\" which explains why he dismissed and distanced himself from Alex initially.\n\nIn the film, their first encounter differs, being set at a party for the first night of the Melbourne Climate Conference. Alex approached Henry to introduce himself, but Henry blew him off. Alex says that Henry \"looked at [him] like [he] had headlice\" then turned to Shaan telling him to \"get me out of here\". While waiting out a security threat at a children's hospital, Alex explains this to Henry who apologizes. He tells Alex that his father had died only a couple of months before and the Crown had insisted on \"parading [him] about\". He adds that he’d said \"I need to get out of here\" to Shaan, as he’d been overwhelmed.\n\nDeath of His Father[]\n\nIn the book, Henry lost his father to pancreatic cancer in 2015, roughly 14 months prior to meeting Alex in the book. It tore a hole in his world that he wasn't able to fill. Losing his father at a young age affected Henry in ways shown throughout the story, especially in his bouts of depression, presumably treated by the medication Alex seen him take.\n\nIn the film, his father died in 2016, a few months before the Melbourne Climate Conference.\n\nComing Out[]\n\nHenry first comes out to his sister, Princess Beatrice, when he is 18. He picks her up from a club to which she escaped after leaving a rehabilitation facility she'd been forced into by her grandmother and Philip. As they sit outside the club, Henry breaks down, telling her that she can't kill herself partying and doing drugs because their father is dead, he's gay, and he doesn't know what to do.\n\nHenry admits to Alex that Bea is the only member of the family he has actually told about his sexuality, but that he believes the others suspect he’s gay. The only people in Henry's life who know aside from Bea are Shaan and Henry's therapist.\n\nHenry tells his elder brother Phillip after meeting Alex. Philip is \"not surprised to discover that [Henry is] not the heterosexual heir [he is] supposed to be, but rather surprised [Henry does] not intend to keep pretending to be the heterosexual heir [he is] supposed to be.\"\n\nIn the book, the world finds out about Alex and Henry's relationship when a picture of them kissing - taken after a decoy date between Henry and June - is released in the British media. Their emails were also lifted from the White House server and news outlets worldwide run them, along with WikiLeaks posting the full contents of their emails under the moniker \"The Waterloo Letters\". While many people disagreed with and slander Alex and Henry's relationship, there is a worldwide outpouring of support. The public's support, along with a thinly concealed threat, gave Catherine (Henry's mother) the foothold she needed to make a case against Queen Mary. (In the film most of this is omitted as Bea is Henry's younger sister and the reconciliation with his mother is entirely removed.) It is revealed that the office of the Republican presidential candidate is responsible for the surveillance and outing of Alex and Henry. This information is discovered by Nora who received an anonymous email with a link to the contents of the Richards email server. Alex decodes a seemingly random series of numbers and letters at the bottom of the email, revealing that Rafael Luna was the source of the evidence.\n\nIn the movie, their relationship is outed when their emails are hacked and released on the internet, along with photos of them taken from the security cameras at the V&A. It's implied that Miguel Ramos was responsible for the hack and the release of their emails/photos, though this is never confirmed.\n\nPhilanthropy[]\n\nPrince Henry is the patron of the Henry Foundation, a royal charity that advocates for and supports LGBT youth worldwide.\n\nHenry frequently visits a children's hospital, visiting with the patients on the cancer ward.\n\nPhysical appearance[]\n\nHe is described by Alex as having \"thick tawny hair,\" \"big blue eyes,\" \"a warm smile,\" and a \"happy sun-bright confidence\" in regards to his poster in June's birthday purchase of a colorful teen magazine. As adults, Henry is described as being roughly 6'0\" tall, having approximately four inches of height on Alex.\n\nIn the film, Henry has green/hazel eyes and is said to be 6'2\", however, Alex insists he isn't as they're almost the same exact height. In many scenes, it's visually discernible that Henry is slightly shorter than Alex (Nicholas is 6'0\" and Taylor is 6'1\").\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn the book, his full name is Henry George Edward James Fox-Mountchristen-Windsor, and is styled His Royal Highness, Prince Henry of Wales.\n\nIn the film, Henry states that his full name is Henry George Edward James Hanover-Stuart Fox, and describes his mother as \"The Duchess of Edinburgh,\" which would render his formal style as His Royal Highness, Prince Henry of Edinburgh.\n\nHis dog David is a beagle and named after David Bowie.\n\nHis dog is also a certified therapy dog but suffers from anxiety.\n\nHe has a tendency to eat ice cream late at night, when he can't sleep.\n\nHe went to Mongolia for one month of his gap year.\n\nIf Henry wasn't a prince, he states, he would be a writer and live in Paris.\n\nHenry plays Polo and Piano and fluent in French.\n\nThough the Crown, for Political Expediency, claims his favorite Author is Charles Dickens, Henry's favorite English Author is Jane Austen.\n\nHis MBTI is INFJ[1] and his enneagram is 2w1.[2]\n\nHis Hogwarts house is Ravenclaw, but with a strong competing argument for Hufflepuff.[3] Alex is strongly of the opinion, that Henry is a Hufflepuff.\n\nNon-royal Henry would go by \"Henry Fox\".\n\nHis codename is \"Bishop\".\n\nDuring his dance with June in chapter one, he asked about how Alex was doing.\n\nPer McQuiston's Threads profile, they support the concept of Henry being autistic."
