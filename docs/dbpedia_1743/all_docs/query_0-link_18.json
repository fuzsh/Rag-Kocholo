        "text": "A Few Good Women\n\nIn 1969, President Richard Nixon created the Task Force on Women's Rights and Responsibilities that marked the beginning of a successful initiative to recruit and train women for upper-level governmental positions. Unfortunately, few of the women who joined the government as a result of this initiative left collections of papers for historians to review. Many of the women are nearing retirement age or have retired; a few have died. Their recollections, along with those of the men who were involved in the effort, make a significant contribution to the documentation of the history of women in modern American political life.\n\nA. E. Bye Drawings\n\nArthur Edwin Bye, Jr., was born in Arnhem, the Netherlands, on August 15, 1919. He came to Pennsylvania at an early age when his father was a professor of art history at Swarthmore. Bye received a bachelor’s degree in landscape architecture from the Pennsylvania State University in 1942. Bye published several books, most notably Art into Landscape, Landscape into Art, filled with photographs, many of his own works, framing landscaped views both natural and man-made that he thought successful. Bye died on November 25, 2001.\n\nAlbert A. Anderson Jr. and Evelynn M. Ellis art education drawing books\n\nThe Albert A. Anderson Jr. and Evelynn M. Ellis art education drawing books offers a selection of examples of digitized 19th century drawing cards. While the broader Anderson Ellis Art Education print collection consists of several hundreds of pedagogical tools that document the field of art education, this digital collection aims to preserve and highlight one of the most ephemeral tools of the 19th century: the drawing card.\n\nAlice Marshall Women's History Collection\n\nThe Alice Marshall Women's History Collection, part of the Penn State Harrisburg Library's Archives and Special Collections, consists of literary, graphic, and manuscript materials dealing with the issues and individuals that comprised women's history from the 15th century to the early 1980s.\n\nAlma Mahler\n\nAlma Mahler-Werfel, wife to composer Gustav Mahler, architect Walter Gropius, and writer Franz Werfel, was given a bound volume containing seventy-seven letters from significant representatives of European and American cultural and intellectual history. The website, in German, consists of a short introduction and presentation of the project including the technical aspects (Das Projekt), a summary of Alma Mahler-Werfel's biography (Biographisches), a bibliography (Bibliographie), and the letters themselves.\n\nAmalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers of North America records\n\nThe Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers of North America (AA) formed in 1876 to support industrial workers working in the United States. The AA lost membership during a series of key strikes in the early to mid-1880s, but regained strength after joining the newly formed American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1887. In 1935, Phillip Murray and the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) largely subsumed the AA’s efforts to unionize the steel workers. At that time, the AA joined the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and ceased to exist as an independent entity. These records document the organizing efforts of the AA from 1892 through the period following its consolidation as part of the CIO in 1935.
