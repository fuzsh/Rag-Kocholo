        "text": "The Willingboro, New Jersey Local History Collection\n\nIn Memory of Rev. Dr. Efiong S. Utuk\n\nArranged and Described By Leah Gass, David Koch, and Jessica Piper\n\nLast modified February 24, 2022 by Linda Cope\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Willingboro Public Library serves as the primary repository for the Willingboro Local History Collection. The major emphasis of the Local History Collection is historical and current information about the Township of Willingboro, New Jersey. Subject areas include early settlers, recent immigrants, ethnic groups, development by Levitt & Sons, business, work, prominent individuals and events. Township government, local individuals, groups and organizations, and the Willingboro Public Library all are responsible for generating materials included in the collection.\n\nExtent: Approximately 20 cubic feet. It is important to note that this collection will continue to grow as more materials are generated in the months and years to come.\n\nAccess: The purpose of the Willingboro Local History Collection is to preserve materials that document the history of Willingboro and to make these materials available to researchers and the general public. The library holds these materials in trust for future generations and therefore, for preservation reasons, materials can only be used in the library.\n\nTour of the collection may be arranged by appointment. Patrons will not be directly allowed into the Rev. Dr. Efiong S. Utuk Local History Room except when accompanied by library staff. Patrons must therefore make their request of local history materials known at the Reference Desk. Patrons must conduct research in a designated area. Loose-leaf paper and pencils are the only items the researcher may have out when archival items are being viewed. Photocopies may be made with the consent of the library staff.\n\nEvery Researcher will be required to fill out a search record form that will be used to document the types of materials being used and to notify the patron if any additional information is found on their subject of research.\n\nThis finding aid is available both digitally and on paper. To search this document digitally for a word, type the “Control” and “F” keys consecutively and then enter the word into the search box.\n\nSuggested Citation: Willingboro Public Library, Willingboro, New Jersey Local History Collection\n\nWe would like to thank all individuals and groups who donated local history materials to us!\n\nII.
