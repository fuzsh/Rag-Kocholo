        "text": "As well as original and photocopied research materials, the subseries includes cross-reference sheets pointing to relevant information organized elsewhere in Subseries B. Subject Files or Subseries C. People Files, and photographic prints including those used in Partners in Business. The latter sometimes include photographic negatives, and information on sources, permissions, and placement in the book's final layout.\n\nThe files give an overview of the evolution of Brown Brothers from a commodities importation firm to a highly influential worldwide bank and investment house. Important events and topics include agent Joseph Shipley's negotiations with the Bank of England during the panic of 1837; bank actions during the panics of 1857 and 1907 and its contributions to the Gold Fund of 1914; funding actions in Nicaragua from 1911 on, and subsequent investigations of its political consequences; Brown Brothers' relationship and eventual merger with the Harriman interests; changes in partnership agreements and personnel; loans and bond issues; and the firm's interest in and promotion of its history through its anniversary celebrations at 100, 125, and 150 years.\n\nMaterials dating after the 1940s contain more information about the daily administration of the bank, including photographs of current employees and production of the 1959 brochure \"Personality of a Bank\". Many materials from the mid-1950s appear to have been taken from the scrapbooks of Catherine Barrett (see Series VI. Scrapbooks and Collected Material). From 1964 to 1968 John Kouwenhoven was a Brown Brothers Harriman staff member. The files from that period, including information routinely routed to the Historical Files about the firm's day-to-day operations, policy, and personnel changes, provide a look at business practices of this period. The files also document Kouwenhoven's activities in interviewing current and past employees and partners, and establishing procedures for his office.\n\nThe material in this subseries complements and often duplicates that in the other three subseries of Series I. For example, material on the 150th anniversary celebrations occurs here under \"1968\" and in the Subject files under both \"Sesquicentennial\" and \"Sun Valley\".\n\nThe subseries is arranged chronologically but, within this order, some materials are grouped by subject. These have been inserted at their beginning dates and the chronological order resumes at their completion. They include information on Brown Brothers & Co.'s involvement in Nicaraguan financing, 1911-1929, which follows 1910-1914; the 1914-1918 partner deliberations on separating the business of Brown Shipley & Co. from that of Brown Brothers & Co., which follows 1917; the merger of Brown Brothers & Co. with W.A. Harriman (1928-1935), which follows 1931; the preparation and publication of the brochure \"The Personality of a Bank\", which follows 1959; funding of Community Research & Development /Rouse Corporation /Columbia MD, which precedes the 1965 files; and the company's 150th anniversary, which follows the other 1968 files.\n\nDuplication of materials is prevalent. For example, a set of Partners' letterbooks, 1851-1859, was photocopied from microfilm housed at the Liverpool Public Libraries. The 1851-1853 letters were also photocopied, individually foldered, and annotated by Kouwenhoven. These are now arranged by date and each letter is preceded by a photocopy of the annotations.\n\nBound volumes 1-6 are listed together at the end of the series, in chronological order.\n\nVarious oversize photographs found organized separately in the Records, but originally marked as belonging to the Chronological files, are included here.\n\nThe subseries is arranged alphabetically by name of person, place, event, or other appropriate subject heading.\n\nPlaced before the alphabetical listing (which begins with \"Alex. Brown & Sons\") is a group of Case History files, which were prepared for inclusion in Partners in Banking, but not eventually used in that format. Information from these proposed Case Histories on the merger of Bangor Aroostook Railroad with the Punta Alegre sugar manufacturing company, and Brown Brothers Harriman's role in the development of Columbia, MD, became instead extended captions describing photographs at the end of the book (pp. 206-208). Original order of these materials has been retained.\n\nThe organization of materials in the subseries is not always consistent, and is often duplicative. For example, information on overseas banks is grouped into Foreign Banks, but there are separate files for Banque de France and Norge Bank; information on Punta Alegre exists in both the Case Files and in alphabetical order; and materials pertaining to the firm's 150th anniversary celebrations are included under both \"Sesquicentennial\" and \"Sun Valley\", as well as in the \"1968\" materials in Subseries I.A. Chronological Files. Material originally filed under \"Metropolitan Museum of Art\" has been included in the folder \"Crosby Brown Collection of Musical Instruments,\" because it is specifically on that subject. Consulting the card catalog to the collection available in the Reading Room, which provides item-level indexing, may be helpful in resolving these inconsistencies.\n\nMaterials within subject headings were originally in chronological order, and that has been retained in smaller files. In larger files, materials have been organized into types (e.g., clippings, correspondence, cross-reference sheets, images) for clearer identification, and then ordered chronologically.\n\nVolumes 7-12, which were originally included in the Subject files, have been removed and are listed in chronological order at the end of the container list.\n\nAll information pertaining to Brown Brothers' Wall Street offices, which was originally out of order (including a chronology found together with some visual materials), is now included in the \"Property\" files. Correspondence between partner Thatcher Brown and Museum of the City of New York director Harding Scholle from the 1940s indicates that the original deeds to the Wall Street property from 1699 and 1708 are on permanent loan to the Museum, available at that time to be borrowed on request.\n\nVarious materials found elsewhere in the collection have been added to the Subject files as appropriate. Binders containing draft and final data printouts with information on attendees at the 1968 Sun Valley sesquicentennial gathering are now included in the \"Sun Valley\" materials as boxes 55-57. Their date order is not consistent because these materials are housed in different-sized boxes.\n\nRecords almost exclusively to do with co-partnership agreements had been culled from the firm's original records for inclusion in Thatcher Brown's 1950 book Brown Brothers & Co. [and] Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., 1900-1950. They were then further culled in early June 1964 and were labeled as awaiting John Kouwenhoven's return to be reviewed.\n\nSome files labeled as originating from the Tax Department are now included under that designation. General files from the Department are in chronological order, followed by client-specific folders in alphabetical order by last name. Information in them includes some of the individuals also represented in Subseries I.C. People.\n\nTwo books of stockholder records for Wall and Hanover Street Realty Co. are included as Volumes 9 and 10. Folders of Brown Bros. & Co. correspondence marked with Kouwenhoven's Subject designation, but not included in the original filing cabinets and not annotated, have been added there.\n\nExtracts of letters and other communications compiled into a volume (with index), which became disbound and is labeled in Kouwenhoven's handwriting as having originated from the Philadelphia office, is now included with those materials. There is some variation in the box order of these items because they are housed in different sized boxes\n\nVarious oversize photographic materials found organized separately in the Records but originally marked as belonging to the Subject files are now included here. Two photographs of lower Manhattan showing the Brown Brothers building at 59 Wall Street were not labeled with a subject heading; these have been added to the \"Property\" files.\n\nThe subseries includes original and photocopied material specific to former and current (as of 1968) employees, partners, clients, as well as genealogical information about various branches of the Brown and related families. A large amount of the information, especially that to do with Brown family members and partners, consists of cross-reference sheets pointing to items in other subseries of the Historical Files.\n\nSome folders in Subseries C.i. had written on them the subject's lines of descent from Brown partners. These have been photocopied onto acid-free paper.\n\nAmong the clients in Subseries C.iii. are nobleman Otto of Hapsburg; playwright Philip Barry and his wife Ellen; poet Archibald Macleish at the time he served as Librarian of Congress; and humorist Dorothy Parker and her husband Alan Campbell, whose records include 1938 ticket stubs they claimed as deductible expenses. These materials may have come from Tax Department employee Catherine Barrett's scrapbooks, which are included in Series VI. Scrapbooks and Collected Materials.\n\nAmong the former employees in Subseries C.iv. who worked briefly for the firm were the son of New York diarist Philip Hone; and Edward Heath, who later served as England's Prime Minister.\n\nThere is some duplication of information about Brown family members in Subseries C.v. and vi., but most information on family members who were partners in the firm is included in the latter subseries. Materials include cross-reference sheets, genealogical information, clippings, photographs and other images, and information submitted by living current and retired partners in response to requests from Kouwenhoven.\n\nSubseries C.vi. provides information on non-business aspects of the partners' lives and interests, including William Brown's donations in his home town of Liverpool, England; John Crosby Brown and William Adams Brown's involvement with Union Theological Seminary in New York City; and the extensive international political careers of W. Averell Harriman, Robert A. Lovett, and Robert V. Roosa.\n\nSarah B. Brown, who was John Crosby Brown's great-granddaughter, donated a significant amount of the material in her great-grandfather's files, including photographs and letters from his son James Brown to his wife Mary Elizabeth Adams Brown from France in 1917, where he was working for the American Red Cross. Subseries C.v. and vi. also document Mrs. Brown's research travels in support of material relevant to the Historical Files.\n\nThe subseries includes material generated by Kouwenhoven, Hoban, Brown, and others related to the research, writing, and publication of Partners in Banking; associated exhibitions; and answering general queries by the Historical Files office.\n\nThe \"Filing\" file includes an October 1968 memorandum from Hoban detailing the structure and function of the Historical Files, how the staff might solicit additional information for it, and ideas for its organization.\n\nThe \"Pending daily\" file provides a snapshot of the staff's daily activities and includes cross-reference sheets, correspondence, and notes to the file that were created but not yet interfiled in their respective series.\n\nThe card catalog (Box 80) was created to document sources containing references to Brown partners, family members, and the history of banking for use in Partners in Banking. It includes two sets of cards organized alphabetically by subject: a \"Periodicals Index\" listing magazine and journal citations; and a \"Book Index\" listing references in published books, including some of the volumes amassed for the Historical Files Library and now found in Series X. Published Material. These document the sources Brown used for research related to the book and their location at local and distant collections including the New York Society Library, Columbia University's Law and Butler Libraries, the Brown Brothers Harriman Central Library, and the Institute of Bankers in London.\n\nPlaced at the end of the subseries are samples of the various files, folders, and identification systems in which the Historical Files, and items used to amass them, were originally housed."
