C. and the\n\nJersey A. C., the final score being six\n\nto two, with the Clevelands in the as\n\ncendency. Welsh fanned eleven whilo\n\nMetier whiffed twelve. The Cleve\n\nlands played inferior base ball and if\n\nthe Jerseys could only learn to play a\n\ngame with fewer unexcusable errors\n\nthey might have had the older fellows\n\nat their mercy.\n\nThe Jersey A. C. meets the Berkeley\n\nHeights aggregation at Berkeley\n\nHeights Saturday afternoon in a re\n\nturn game. When the Berkeley\n\nHeights boys met the locals some time\n\nago the locals triumphed by a score of\n\nten to nothing.\n\nCleveland Field club disappointed\n\n’most every body Saturday afternoon\n\nat New Vernon when they allowed\n\nthe New Vernon team to do them up\n\nby a score of twelve to seven. The\n\nNew Vernons have not been doing any\n\nremarkable playing this year but the\n\nCollinsville push was easy the hosts\n\nplaying all around them.\n\nThe game between the Young Men’s\n\nChristian association juniors and the\n\nGreystone park team turned out to be\n\na joke, the score resulting thirteen to\n\ntwo, the Morris Plains folks of course\n\non top. This is rather late in the sea\n\nson for practice games for the Y. M.\n\nboys are by their youth alone out of\n\ntheir opponents class.\n\n“ Willie ” Holton, pitching for the\n\nNational Turners against the St.\n\nBenedicts, in Newark on Sunday, was\n\ntouched for fifteen hits. He gave two\n\npasses and struck out four. The\n\n“ Saints ” won the. game five to noth\n\ning.\n\nIn a county championship game at\n\nBoonton Sunday the Jerseys hung a\n\ndefeat on the Wharton team by a\n\nscore of three to one, The batteries\n\nwereBoonton, Lewis and Orr;\n\nWharton, Rogers, Kiser and Schiffner.\n\nMadison will receive the attention\n\nof the Alerts Saturday, August 28th,\n\nwhen they will meet the Young Men's\n\nChristian association of that place.\n\nOn Wednesday the Moxies and the\n\nNoe farm boys will play off their rub\n\nber. In order apparently to give the\n\nspectators full value for their money\n\nit will be a double header.\n\n-—*\n\nThis Is From New Vernon.\n\nHow about it looking easy for the\n\nCleveland F. C. at New Vernon last\n\nSaturday with a score of twelve to\n\nseven in favor of New Vernon F. C.?\n\nIt was a good game with a Morristown\n\numpire that was fair. Nevertheless,\n\nwe like the Collinsville combination\n\nof ball tossers and hope that they will\n\ncome again. They will be welcomed\n\nby the onlookers as well as the New\n\nVernon lads. Don’t kick so hard next\n\ntime but take it easy.\n\n-»\n\n, Jn the Swim Early tu Eire,\n\nIn the •• Gossip of the Commuters”\n\nthe New York “ Tribune” says.:—\n\n“ Francis Kluxen, of Madison, has\n\ncommuted from that borough about\n\nas long as any other person there. He\n\nis a grandfather, and the other day,\n\nwhile one of the Lackawanna trains\n\nwas waiting at a station for the time\n\nto leave, said his grandson, ten months\n\nold, had given a surprise to his mother\n\nand the rest of the family that morn\n\ning that they would not be likely to\n\nforget. The little fellow was getting\n\nhis morning bath, and was shrieking\n\nwith joy and splashing right vigorous\n\nly. The bathtub was three-fourths\n\nfull, and the mother was holding him\n\nup as beat tbe water with his chubby\n\nhands. Suddenly he jumped away\n\nfrom her, and, instead of sinking,\n\nswam to the end of the tub. She be\n\nlieved that this was the result of the\n\nimpetus of the jump, but thought she\n\nwould see whether he really could\n\nswim. He was oarried to the end of\n\nthe bub and she placed her hands\n\nlightly under him. She didn’t have\n\nto support him. From that day to\n\nthis the little fellow has a daily swim,\n\ngenerally with the family as specta\n\ntors.”\n\nWhen it is remember, that J. Paul\n\nJamieson is tbe father of this lusty\n\nyoungster no one need be surprised.\n\nThe lad couldn’t help being smart.\n\n_4k_.\n\n“ FlKhttn* Fifteenth’s'* Reunion.\n\nAlonzo A. Doty, president of the\n\n15th Regiment Volunteers Veteran’s\n\nassociation has -issued formal orders\n\nfor the thirtieth annual reunion of the\n\nassociation, which is to be held in*\n\nMorristown on Thursday, September\n\n16tb. Headquarters will be at the\n\nUnited States hotel, where the execu\n\ntive committee will meet on Septem\n\nber 15th at eight p. m.\n\nThe business session will be held in\n\nA. T. A. Torbert Post room on the\n\nday following at ten o’clock. A re\n\nport is expected from the monument\n\ncommittee and plans for an excursion\n\nnext year to the Virginia battle Helds\n\nwill be submitted for approval. Din\n\nner will be served by the ladies of\n\nHope league and at its conclusion a\n\nreunion and social meeting will be\n\nheld by the members of the regiment\n\nand their friends.\n\nThe committee in charge of the lo\n\ncal arrangements, including Mr. Doty,\n\nVice-Chancellor John R. Emery, Fos\n\nter H. Langdon, Charles H. Guerin,\n\nCharles F. Axtell and Manuel John\n\nson, are arranging to give the visitors\n\nan automobile ride about the town.\n\nPAY OF ELECTION OFFICERS,\n\nEntitled to Two Days’ Pay on the\n\nAmendment Election Day.\n\nThere seems to be some unnecessary\n\nuncertainty in regard to the compen\n\nsation of election boards on Septemoei\n\n14,1909. The matter was referred to\n\nthe attorney-general and his decision,\n\nit is stated, was that the boards could\n\nreceive pay but for one day. The act\n\nproviding for the election, however,\n\nset tles the question. It says\n\nFor the services and duties required\n\nand imposed upon them, under and by\n\nvirtue of this act, the members of the\n\nboards of registry and election shall\n\neach receive the sum of three dollars\n\nfor making or revising the registry\n\nand five dollars for conducting the\n\nelection, to be paid as the expenses of\n\nelections for members of the General\n\nAssembly are now paid.\n\nThe compensation of the county\n\nelection boards is also fixed by the act\n\nas follows\n\nThe county boards of election in the\n\nseveral counties shall sit on the Satur\n\nday next preceding such election, and\n\nalso on the day of election, from eight\n\no’clock in the forenoon till five o’clock\n\nin the afternoon of each of said days,\n\nand perform the same duties in respect\n\nto such registry as is now provided by\n\nlaw in respect to the registry for any\n\ngeneral election, and each member of\n\nsaid board shall receive the sum of\n\nlive dollaas for his services under the\n\nprovisions of this act for each of said\n\ndays.\n\nELECTION CALENDAR.\n\nWbat the Law Requires Shall be Done\n\nNext Week.\n\nAugust 31—Outside of cities having\n\na population exceeding 30,000 the\n\nboards of registry and election shall\n\non this date meet for organization and\n\nelect one of its members as judge, who\n\nshall be chairman of said board, and\n\nanother of its members as inspector.\n\nSeptember 7--The terms of office of\n\nthe district board of registry and elec\n\ntion shall begin September 1 of each\n\nyear, and expire on August 31 of the\n\nfollowing year, or when their succes\n\nsors are appointed and qualified.\n\n-*\n\nPaving Contract Signed.\n\nThe contract for the paving of\n\nWashington street was signed by\n\n■ Mayor Theodore Ayers and a repre\n\nsentative of the Jersey Paving corpor\n\nation, of Newark, on Thursday after\n\nnoon. Though the Jersey company\n\nwas not the lowest bidder for the\n\nwork Street Commissioner Cole and\n\nthe street committee of the board of\n\naldermen deemed the brick offered by\n\nthe company superior to that bid upon\n\nby the Atlantic Contracting & Con\n\nstruction Co., also of Newark.\n\nThe Jersey company bid $7,399.50 on\n\na shale brick called Metropolitan. The\n\nAtlantic company’s bid was $&,$42i90\n\nfor Fairmount, a tire clay brick.\n\nIn the estimation of the town offi\n\ncials the shale brick was the harder\n\nof the two bricks and would wear bet\n\nter. The Metropolitan brick is in use\n\non streets in Newark, Camden, Tren\n\nton, Albany, Brooklyn, Wilmington,\n\nBoston, Allentown and other cities.\n\nThe Fairmount brick is in use on\n\nthree streets in Jersey City and in\n\nNew Brunswick, Baltimore and Ha\n\ngerstown. Work is to began within\n\nten days.\n\n-*\n\nVacation for Human o'* Steamer.\n\nHumane Engine company’s steamer\n\nis temporarily out of commission until\n\ntwo new suction pipes can be secured.\n\nThe steamer was taken out for testing\n\nMonday evening and both the suction\n\npipes were buxsted by the water pres\n\nsure.\n\nTne extra suction pipe of Washing\n\nton Engine company’s machine is too\n\nlarge for the Humane steamer. Chief\n\nHay went to Morris Plains this morn\n\ning in company with Frederick Gal\n\nlegher, of the Humanes, to look at an\n\nextra suction pipe the Morris Plains\n\ndepartment had tor sale but this pipe\n\nwas found to be too small. It will be\n\nnecessary to secure a new pipe from\n\nNew York. One of the burst pipes is\n\nsixteen years old and the other was\n\nbought In Chief David L. Fox’s time,\n\nfive years ago.\n\nMr\n\nMot a Legal Holiday.\n\nWhen Samuel H. Grey was Attor\n\nney-General, Governor Griggs asked\n\nfor and gob an opinion that the day\n\nset apart for a special election on Con\n\nstitutional amendments is not a legal\n\nholiday. The holiday act having been\n\namended since then, Governor Fort\n\nreferred the same question to Attor\n\nney-General Wilson last week aud re\n\nceived the same answer. Tuesday,\n\nSeptember 14, will uot be a legal holi\n\nday.\n\nThe law relating to saloons is a dif\n\nferent matter. This is in the general\n\nelection act and it provides that all\n\nsaloons shall close on any election day,\n\nand it is made the duty of sheriffs and\n\npeace officers to see that the saloons\n\nare closed.\n\n-•\n\nProhibition Plonlo.\n\nThe third annual convention and\n\nbasket picnic of Morris County Prohi\n\nbitionists will be held at Landing,\n\nLake Hopatcong, Labor day. Besides\n\nnominating a ticket for the connty\n\noffices the cold water advocates wilj\n\nlisten to an address by Bev. Ernest A.\n\nBoom, a member of the state crimes\n\nand dependency commission.\n\nASSAULT AND\n\nTHENSUICIDE\n\nFrederick Krouse Makes Brutal\n\nAttack on Mrs. Elizabeth\n\nSmith, of Parsippany.\n\nHANGS HIMSELF FROM A TREE\n\nAfter brutally clubbing Mrs. Eliza\n\nbeth Smith at her home near Parsip\n\npany early Wednesday morning Fred\n\nerick Krouse went to a nearby patch\n\nof woods and hanged himself from a\n\ntree. ; *\n\nMrs. Smith is the wife of George W.\n\nSmith, a farmer. As was his custom,\n\nSmith arose and went to the fields\n\nearly. A short time afterward Krouse\n\nentered the house and, unobserved,\n\nmade his way to Mrs. Smith’s room on\n\nthe second floor. He was armed with\n\na club. Evidently he tried to kill the\n\nwoman with a first blow, but in this\n\nhe was unsuccessful, and her cries\n\naroused her daughter, Marguerite,\n\nseventeen years old. The girl rushed to\n\nthe door of her mother’s room and\n\nsaw Krouse beating her mother over\n\nthe head. Badly frightened she\n\njumped from a second story window\n\nto the ground. Unhurt beyond a few\n\nslight bruises she hurried to a neigh\n\nbors and gave the alarm. Krouse saw\n\nher go and running down the front\n\nstairs went out the front door, locked\n\nft and threw the key away.\n\nNeighbors rushed to the Smith\n\nhome and found Mrs. Smith uncon\n\nscious. She was cared for by two\n\nphysicians at her home and later\n\nbrought to Memorial hospital here.\n\nCounty Detective Edward L. Bren\n\nnan was notified and organized a posse\n\nto search for Krouse. About three\n\no’clock in the afternoon his dead body\n\nfound by the searchers.\n\nKrouse was hanging by fhe neck,\n\nhaving choked himself to death with\n\na window cord. He had made two at\n\ntempts. at it, the first time letting\n\nhimself down from the limb of a tree\n\nby a fall. The rope cut his neck, but\n\nbroke. As the rope showed, he then\n\nclimbed the tree again, and, letting\n\nhimself down easily, was strangled to\n\ndeath. His feet were ten feet from\n\nthe ground. He was found in a dense\n\nthicket of woods about one and a half\n\nmiles from the Smith house.\n\nDr. Francis H. Glazeb-ook and Dr.\n\nGeorge L. Johnson, the local coroners,\n\nare both away from town on their va\n\ncations and Coroner George Hitchens,\n\nof Wharton, was away on the free\n\nholders’ outing, so that it was neces\n\nsary to secure a justice of tire peace to\n\ngive permission to remote Krouse’s\n\nbody. Justice Kirwin, of Boonton,\n\nwent to Parslppany and viewed the\n\nbody.\n\nIt is thought that Krouse had de\n\nsigns on Miss Smith and his assault\n\non her mother was for the purpose of\n\nsilencing her.\n\n▼\n\nNon-Partisan Bench Promised by\n\nGovernor Port.\n\nDemocrats as well as Republicans\n\nwill be appointed by Governor Fort to\n\nthe new Supreme Court and the pro\n\nposed new Appellate Division if the\n\nproposed judiciary amendment to be\n\nvoted on September J4th is adopted.\n\nThe committee of the New Jersey\n\nSVfite Bar association lias been auth\n\norized to publish the following letter\n\nfrom Governor Fort in response to a\n\nletter to him from ex-V ice-Chancellor\n\nPitney in regard to the maintenance\n\nof the present non-partisan character\n\nof the Supreme Court and the “Ap\n\npellate Division” in the event of the\n\nadoption of the judiciary amendment.\n\nState of New Jersey,\n\nExecutive Department,\n\nCamp Fort, Sea Girt,\n\nJuly 3Q, 180!).\n\nMy. Dear Vice-Chancellor Pitney.:\n\nYour letter received. As to the ap\n\npointments to the Supreme Court and\n\nassignments to the Appellate Division,\n\nin case the amendments pass, you are\n\nentirely right in saying 1 had declared\n\nthat 1 would maintain the non-parti\n\nsan character of the courts. I said\n\nthat publicly in my address at Atlan\n\ntic City and I repeat it here. No one\n\nneed have any doubt about my course\n\non that question.\n\nWith kindest regards and best\n\nwishes, believe me,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJohn Franklin Fort.\n\n-•\n\nTwombly Leases Farm.\n\nHamilton McKay Twombly has\n\nleased his greenhouses to Charles H.\n\nTotty, a Madison florist, and his farm\n\nhe has leased to W.

Rich\n\nter in Charge In Morristown.\n\nThat the trolley will soon be a real\n\nity and not a dream is patent to all\n\nwho have seen the work now in opera\n\ntion on Speedwell avenue. The Mor\n\nris County Traction Co. has leased a\n\nvacant lot from Eney Grupelli located\n\non Speedwell avenue opposite Speed\n\nwell place and is preparing a tempor\n\nary power station there.\n\nA flat ear belonging to the company\n\nhas been roofed over and a 125 kilo\n\nwatt generator, a 125 horse power\n\nmotor, switchboard, and other neces\n\nsary paraphernalia set up upon It. The\n\ncar was brought down from Dover on\n\nMonday, where the machinery was set\n\nup. It was brought to Morris Plains\n\nover the Lackawanna and there trans\n\nferred to the trolley tracks and was\n\ndragged the rest of the way down\n\nSpeedwell avenue by the trolley com\n\npany’s steam roller.\n\nThe William H. Sheehan Co. is\n\nstringing the wires from the Morris\n\n& Somerset Electric company’s plant\n\nto the temporary station.\n\nA gang of laborers is clearing the\n\nstones and dirt from the trolley tracks\n\nand the trolley wires will be straight\n\nened and made ready for the running\n\nof the first car September 1st.\n\nThe company will probably bring\n\nthe car to be used here down from\n\nDover on Friday. It will be a six\n\nwheel closed car, seating forty people.\n\nIt is one of the first cars used by the\n\ncompany in Dover, bub it has been\n\nrepaired and repainted and presents\n\na fine appearance.\n\nThe work in Morristown is under\n\nthe supervision of Ira J. Richter, who\n\nconstructed the line through Dover\n\nseveral years ago. It gladdened the\n\nhearts of, Morristonians to see Mr.\n\nRichter in charge, for he has the repu\n\ntation of accomplishing results and\n\nwith him directing the work of con\n\nstruction here it would seem that\n\nsomething must come of it.\n\n_A—\n\nQuibbling Over Manholes.\n\nWith work started on the repaving\n\nof Madison avenue a discussion has\n\n1 arisen between the board of freehold\n\ners and the Morristown board of sew\n\nerage over the height of the manholes\n\nand lamp holes of the sewerline on the\n\navenue. When the manholes were put\n\nin they were placed at the grade of\n\nthe road at that time. Now, with the\n\nroad being repaved, it is found they\n\nare about four inches too low.\n\nTo raise them will cost about $100\n\nfor the lot, there being twenty-four\n\nmanholes and ten lamp holes. The\n\nroad committee notitied the sewerage\n\nboard to have them raised but the\n\nsewerage board could not see it, hav\n\ning built them originally at the grade\n\nof the road.\n\nNow the county threatens to lay\n\nthe paving over the manholes, neces\n\nsitating the removal of the stone\n\nwhenever an inspection may be neces\n\nsary.\n\n-*-—\n\nElection Officers Expect Double Pay.\n\nElection officers in districts outside\n\ncities having more than 30,000 inhab\n\nitants are beginning to agitate the\n\nquestion of the pay they will receive\n\nfor their services Tuesday, September\n\n14th, the day of the special election on\n\nthe proposed constitutional amend\n\nments^\n\nIn the election districts mentioned\n\nthat will be a registration day as\n\nwell as an election day, and the offi\n\ncers claim they will be entitled tc\n\npay for both kinds of service. The\n\npay for a registration is $3 per day\n\nfor each officer, and for an election\n\nday it is $5 for each officer. It is\n\nlikely that the question will be re\n\nferred to the attorney genera!, and\n\nit is considered probable that the\n\nruling will be that each officer in\n\nthe districts in question will be en\n\ntitled to the $8 for the special elec\n\ntion day.\n\n-•\n\n#.•500 for Summer Shelter.\n\nThe Morristown Summer Shelter,\n\nnear Collinsville, our well-known fresh\n\nair home for poor city children, has\n\nrecently received a $300 bequest by the\n\nwill of the late Miss Mary Caroline\n\nPierson, of Morristown. This sum\n\nhas been added to the endowment\n\nfund of the society and it would not\n\nbe misplaced confidence if others\n\nshould emulate Miss Pierson’s gen\n\nerous example, and help to provide for\n\nan institution which for twenty years\n\nhas annually brought so much happi\n\nness and benefit to hundreds of needy\n\nchildren. The city charities which\n\nsupply the Shelter with little ones\n\nhave often stated that there is no\n\nhome as popular as the Morristown\n\nSummer Shelter. * * *\n\n•-♦\n\nBaud Concert To-Night.\n\nThe following is the program which\n\nwill be played on the Green to-night\n\nby the Morristown Band.
