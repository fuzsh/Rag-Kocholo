        "text": "This LROC image was taken at a solar elevation of 61 degrees. The relatively small range of surface brightness variation means that enhanced versions show areas of soil disturbed by the astronauts quite clearly. Among the labelled featres as two pieces of reflective material that show up at the same locations relative to nearby craters in both M127049821R and in M124687860R. The latter was taken at a solar elevation of 84 degrees. The fact that these reflections are seen in two LROC images taken under similar lighting conditions makes it likely that they are real, rather than artifacts in the LROC data. Both are labeled 'Kapton', although it is not certain that is what they are.

Assembled by Eric Jones.\n\n109:46:23 Post-landing CDR Window Pan (4 Mb or 0.2 Mb)\n\nThe frames are AS14-65-9209 to 9215. Assembled by Karl Dodenhoff.\n\n109:46:23 Post-landing Combined Window Pans (309k)\n\nCombination of the two window pans by Karl Dodenhoff.\n\n114:53:38 LM 4 O'clock Pan ( 867k )\n\nAl took this pan from a position just northeast of the LM. The frames are AS14-66-9236 to 9257. Assembly by Adam Bootle.\n\nA high-resolution version (11 Mb) and a halfsize presentation with anagylphs in context (6 Mb) have been assembled by Eric Jones. An artistic version (160k) has been assembled by Chris Wells. Sharp-eyed readers will note that, because Al took the pan from a spot close to the LM, the top of the spacecraft is not actually visible. Chris has added black sky to give continuity with adjacent frames.\n\nDave Byrne has created a third version (360k).\n\nRicardo Salamé has assembled frames 9250 to 54 (146k), showing the LM.\n\nErik van Meijgaarden has combined frames 9254 and 9255 as a 4 o'clock portrait of the LM (1.2Mb).\n\n114:53:38 LM 8 O'clock Pan (317k)\n\nAl took this pan from a position southeast of the LM. It consists of frames AS14-66-9271 to 9293. Assembly by Dave Byrne.\n\nWarren Harold at NASA Johnson has assembled an alternate version of this pan.\n\n114:57:20 LM 12 O'clock Pan (289k)\n\nAl took this pan from a position west of the LM. The frames are AS14-66-9294 to 9316. Assembly by Dave Byrne.\n\nA high-resolution version of the eastern portion (9 Mb) and a presentation of anagylphs in context (15 Mb) have been assembled by Eric Jones.\n\nA high-resolution version of the western portion (8 Mb) and a presentation of anagylphs in context (12 Mb) have been assembled by Eric Jones.\n\nMike Constantine has created a continuous version (1.0Mb) in QuickTime format.\n\nDavid Harland has used AS14-66-9305 and 9306 to show the LM with Cone Ridge just to the left of the spacecraft ( 0.9 Mb .\n\n119:42:01 Post-EVA-1 Window Pan (152k)\n\nEd and Al used the color magazine on Ed's camera to take a series of pictures of the site after EVA-1. The frames are AS14-66- 9317 to 9326. Assembly by Dave Byrne.\n\n132:16:44 Station A Pan (252k)\n\nThe frames are AS14-68- 9394 to 9408. Frames AS14-68-9404 and 9405 both show Al walking toward the MET with the double core. This assembly uses Al's image from 9404. Assembly by Dave Byrne.\n\nDavid Harland has combined 9405 and the lefthand portion of 9404 to create a mini-pan (2.0 Mb) of Al at the MET with the double core.\n\nDavid Nathan has assembled a high-resolution partial pan (5.7 Mb) showing Al, the MET, and the LM, using Al's image from 9405. Because Al was moving, the shape and position of his shadow is different in all the frames in which it is visible, namely, 9404-9407. As can be seen in a comparison between the raw assembly and the final assembly (177k), David used the nearly complete shadow available in 9405, added the missing upper portion, and eliminated the shadows in 9406 and 9407 which Shepard produced once he got the front of the MET.\n\n132:34:22 Station B Pan (283k)\n\nAlthough the human eye does a far better job than the camera does of picking out the thin ovals appearance of all but the closest craters, Al's Station B pan gives an idea of the problem involved in trying to figure out where, exactly, they were. The frames are AS14-64- 9049 to 9072. Assembly by Dave Byrne.\n\n132:50:31 Station B1 Pan (345k)\n\nThe frames are AS14-64- 9075 to 9097. Al's pan contains two famous pictures of Ed studying the map, trying to figure out where they are. An assembly by Dave Byrne (276k) uses AS14-64-9088, which shows Ed with his back to us; while an alternative assembly by David Harland (345k) uses a profile portrait of Ed, AS14-64-9089.\n\nMarv Hein has created a VR version (0.5 Mb) of the Harland assembly.\n\nErik van Meijgaarden has created a high-resolution mini-pan (0.8 Mb) using portions of AS14-64-9088 and 9089.\n\n132:57:52 Station B2 Pan (288k)\n\nEd took this pan while Al stows the close-up camera on the MET, having just used it on Big Rock, which is next to Ed. The frames are AS14-68-9415 to 9429. Pan assembled by Dave Byrne.\n\n132:57:52 Station B2 Northern View (262k)\n\nI have cropped Dave Byrne's assembly of the Station B2 pan to show the portion from just south of down-Sun around to the north to just south of up-Sun. Assuming that horizontal distance on the image from down-Sun is proportional to azimuthal distance, a measurement of the distance on the image from down-Sun to up-Sun allows me to calculate the lateral positions of intermediate azimuths. From Station B2, the center of Cone Crater is approximately 52 degrees north of east and a tangent to the rim of Cone drawn from B2 is 34 degrees north of east. These two directions are indicated in the image. Because of camera optics, horizontal distance on the image is not strictly proportional to azimuthal distance; but, because we are interested here only in azimuthal distances across one or more Hasselblad frames, the errors are not important.\n\n132:57:52 Station B2 Up-Sun View (2.0Mb)\n\nI have combined AS14-68-9421 and 9422 to create an up-Sun showing Al pulling the MET and, to the left of the Sun, the high-point he has been moving toward. In a labeled version (2.0Mb), I have indicated the approximate directions of (1) a tangent to the south rim - marked 'South Rim' - and (2) the center of Cone Crater. If Al and Ed want to reach the crater rim, they have to head at least slightly leftward of the 'South Rim' direction.\n\n133:14:34 Station B3 Pan (275k)\n\nEd's pan was taken during a brief rest stop on the climb up Cone Ridge. The frames are AS14-68- 9430 to 9442. Pan assembled by Dave Byrne.\n\n132:57:52 Station B3 Northern View (250k)\n\nCropped version of Dave Byrne's assembly of the Station B3 pan with the approximate directions of the center of Cone Crater (82 degrees north of east) and a tangent to the south rim (42 degrees east of north) marked.\n\n133:23:40 Station C-Prime Pan (325k)\n\nAl took this pan when he and Ed finally gave up their unsuccessful search for the rim of Cone Crater. The frames are AS14-64- 9098 to 9122. Assembly by Dave Byrne.\n\nEric Jones has assembled high-resolution version of the southern portion (6Mb) and a version of the southern portion with analgyphs presented in context (11Mb). Al got enough overlap that the anaglyphs for a continuous stereo pan. The terrain at Station C-prime is quite rugged because of numerous large boulders and craters.\n\nDavid Harland has assembled the portion showing the view to the west and around to the north ( 180k ). The Cone rim is just out of sight to the north.\n\nDavid Harland has combined 9019, 9021, and 9022 to create of protrait of the MET at the Station C-Prime Crater (2.3 Mb). The crater is numbered 1101 in a detail (305k) from Plate 2 in USGS Professional Paper 880. An alternate version (0.9 Mb) has been cropped and the reseau crosses have been removed.\n\nErwin D'Hoore has created red-blue anaglyphs from pairs of frames between 9100 and 9108.\n\nJim Scotti has created an anaglyph from 9102 and 9103 ( 752k).\n\nErik van Meijgaarden has created a mini-pan (0.5 Mb) of Ed at the MET, using AS14-64-9117 to 9120.\n\n133:40:48 Station C-1 Pan (123k)\n\nThis series of photos by Ed Mitchell shows Contact Rock (left), Saddle Rock (right), and Layered Rock (center). In USGS Professional Paper 880, Geology of the Apollo 14 Landing Site, in the Fra Mauro Highlands, the gap between the two portions of the mini-pan is estimated to be 1.5 degrees wide. The frames are AS14-68-9448 to 51. Assembly by Dave Byrne.\n\nFrames 5449-51 have been used in a high-resolution portrait of Saddle Rock ( 3Mb ). Assembly by Eric Jones.\n\n134:04:53 Weird Rock (71k)\n\nAl made a quick side trip to examine this boulder, now known as Weird Rock, during the traverse to Station F. He took a three-photo portrait, which has been assembled by David Harland.\n\n134:07:18 Station F Pan (261k)\n\nAl and Ed stopped to do Station F not far west of Weird Rock. One frame of Al's pan shows Ed working at the MET. Assembly by Dave Byrne.\n\nDavid Harland has assembled the portion of the pan that shows Cone Ridge (122k) and, in the foreground, Weird Rock.\n\n134:36:42 Station G Pan (257k)\n\nAl took this pan after finishing a trench. The LM is down-Sun of their present location, partly obscured by an intervening ridge. The frmaes are AS14-64-9167 to 9187Assembly by Dave Byrne.\n\n134:36:42 Station G Pan Detail - Ed at MET (172k)\n\nThis detail of Ed at the MET from Al's Station G pan was assembled by Mike Constantine.\n\n135:01:30 Station H Pan ( 272k )\n\nEd took this pan near Turtle Rock, the largest member of a boulder field north of the LM. Assembly by Dave Byrne.\n\nErik van Meijgaarden has combined 9486 and 9487 as a portrait of Al at the LM (392k).\n\n136:26:06 Post-EVA-2 Window Pan (4.5 Mb)\n\nAt some point after the PLSS jettison at 136:26:06, Ed Mitchell took a series of photos out his window. The frames are AS14-66-9335 to 9343. Assembled by Eric Jones Journal Contributor Mark Rosen calls attention to two small, fuzzy orange spots just above the lunar horizon and just to the left fo center. As detailed in a discussion, these appear in both 9337 and 9342 and are probably reflections of a light on Al's side of the cabin off the two panes of Ed's window.\n\nCrew and Equipment Pre-Flight\n\n64-Apollo-4 ( 182k)\n\nNASA caption reads,\"\"(USN) Commander Alan B.

Note that Al is wearing a stereocamera that was under development but was never flown. Journal Contributor Markus Mehring tells us that the red dot at the top left on the back of the 16-mm camera in the right foreground is \"the end of film warning light, which lights up when there are less than 6 feet of film left in the magazine.\" The 16-mm camera was manufactured by Mauer and their label is at the bottom left on the back of the camera. A bettery pack (DAC Power Pack) is attached to the righthand side of the camera. Mehring notes, \"The white cable below is the connector cable providing the DAC with power from the batteries. The DAC didn't have internal batteries, it always drew its power via a cable from the spacecraft circuits. And during mobile EVA usage, they of course didn't have that available, so they came up with this battery solution.\" Mission photo AS14-64-9121 shows the flight article. Research by J.L.

Astronauts Alan B. Shepard Jr. (leaning with left hand on ground) and Edgar D. Mitchell (behind Shepard, wearing dark glasses) are the prime crew men scheduled to walk on the moon. Astronauts Eugene A. Cernan (almost obscured at extreme left) and Joe H. Engle (partially visible, on Cernan's right) are backup crew commander and lunar module pilot, respectively, for the mission. Others in the photograph are Pat Crosland (in hard hat), a geologist and a park ranger in Hawaii Volcanoes State Park; Michael C.

The box (lower left) containing the three-component readout gauges, the on/off switch and the high/low-gain switch was mounted on the MET (Apollo 14) or the back of the Rover (Apollo 16). The tripod was deployed 15 meters away from the MET or Rover and, as the tripod was carried out to the deployment site, the ribbon cable unwound off both sides of the centrally-mounted cable reel. Once the astronaut deployed the tripod, he went back to the MET/Rover and initiated a measurement. After waiting a pre-determined amount of time for transients to damp out, he read the X, Y and Z values on each of the two gain settings. He then went out to the tripod and changed the orientation of the sensor head at the top of the tripod, returned to the MET/Rover and made another measurement. Once the measurement series was finished, he retrieved the tripod, brought it back to the MET/Rover and rewound the cable using the handle visible on the right-hand side of the reel. Both Ed Mitchell (Apollo 14) and John Young (Apollo 16) had a great deal of trouble rewinding the cable.\n\n70-H-1686 (1.9 Mb)\n\nFull-width view the landing site model during a simulated descent.

Wilhelm Klink', was the incompetent Commandant of a German POW camp in a popular TV comedy of the time, 'Hogan's Heroes'. Col. Klink was played by Werner Klemperer. The cane is a reference to the fact that, at 47 years of age, Shepard was soon to be the oldest person - by far - to walk on the Moon. 31 January 1971.

These are presented at 300 dpi equivalent and are labeled \"OF300\". See a discussion from Arizona State University about the scanning process used on the original film.\n\nSome images are currently available only as low-resolution scans provided by NASA Johnson in the mid-1990s. The individual scans have TARGA filenames. Markus Mehring has compiled cross-references between those filenames and the NASA photo ID designations customarily used. Other images are available as higher resolution scans from prints and, unless otherwise credited, were provided by Kipp Teague.\n\nMagazine 64/LL (B&W) Frames 9046-9201\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all images processed by Kipp Teague from raw scans provided by NASA Johnson. Images labeled \"OF300\" are from the original film and are presented at the equivalent of 300 DPI on an 7.5 inch by 7.5 inch reproduction.\n\nEd Hengeveld has provided a set of thumbnails images ( 1 Mb ) made from low-resolution scans provided by Glen Swanson of NASA Johnson.\n\nMagazine 64 was used by Al Shepard during EVA-2.\n\nAS14-64-9046 (OF300) ( 310k or 1534k )\n\n132:15:25 Close-up cross-Sun from the north of the double core at Station A.

Note that the lower part of the Ascent stage and all of the Descent stage are hidden by intervening high ground.\n\nAS14-64-9049 (OF300) ( 142k or 1070k )\n\n132:34:22 Al has started a pan at Station B, starting with this down-Sun.

Beyond the DAC, we can see what appear to be two sets of Met tracks crossing at right angles. One set goes from left to right and is obviously the first set Al made. At about 132:33:32 when Ed thinks he may have spotted the planned Station B location, Al may have circled to his left to his left and have ended up crossing his own tracks on his way to the current MET location. See, also, the discussion of 9056.\n\nAS14-64-9056 (OF300) ( 172k or 990k )\n\nRightward of 9055, over the MET, showing the smooth MET tracks near the MET's current location. In the background we can see disturbed soil almost as far as the partially buried boulder on the right. At that point, he seems to have circled to his left and conferred with Ed, possibly directly beyond the DAC., before crossing his own tracks toward the current MET location.\n\nAS14-64-9057 (OF300) ( 198k or 1142k )\n\nRightward of 9056, MET and in-bound tracks.\n\nAS14-64-9058 (OF300) ( 185k or 1074k )\n\nRightward of 9057, in-bound tracks.\n\nAS14-64-9059 (OF300) ( 222k or 1369k )\n\n132:34:22 Rightward of 9058.

Note the large boulders near the apparent horizon about half a fiducial spacing to the right of center. The azimuth to these boulders from Station B is about 30 degrees, which is approximately the direction of the nearest point on the Cone Crater rim.\n\nAS14-64-9060 (OF300) ( 235k or 1465k )\n\nRightward of 9059, almost up-Sun showing a number of boulders.\n\nAS14-64-9061 (OF300) ( 174k or 1194k )\n\nRightward of 9060, with little detail visible in the up-Sun glare.\n\nAS14-64-9062 (OF300) ( 172k or 1226 )\n\nRightward of 9061, showing the Cone Crater ridge.\n\nAS14-64-9063 (OF300) ( 171k or 1202k )\n\nRightward of 9062.\n\nAS14-64-9064 (OF300) ( or)\n\nRightward of 9063.\n\nAS14-64-9065 (OF300) ( 235k or 1267k )\n\nRightward of 9064, showing a group of large boulders at the right edge, southeast of their current location.\n\nAS14-64-9066 (OF300) ( 211k or 1107k )\n\nRightward of 9065, showing the group of large boulders southeast of their current location. In a labeled detail from the original scan, the fresh component (USGS 1202) of Weird dominates the horizon on the right half of the image, while Old Nameless, partially obscured by high ground on the east side of Weird, is on the far horizon above and just to the left of the central reseau cross.

Note that there aren't as many boulders visible in this direction as there were uphill of their current location. This picture is taken more or less toward the south so that shadows cast by any rocks in the scene would be visible.\n\nAS14-64-9094 (OF300) ( 121k or 856k)\n\nRightward of 9093, across the top of the MET. The legs of the magnetometer tripod are sticking up just to the right of the 16-mm movie camera. Note that the MET carries a Hand Tool Carrier (HTC) virtually identical to the one used by the Apollo 12 crew.\n\nAS14-64-9094/5 Red-Blue Anaglyph ( 2.8 Mb or 174k)\n\nRed-blue anaglyph by Erik van Meijgaarden.\n\nAS14-64-9095 (OF300) ( 122k or 875k )\n\nRightward of 9094, over the top of the MET.

The LM is near the lefthand edge. Al and Ed are in the midst of a field of small boulders. As we now know, they are about 75 meters SE of the southern rim of Cone Crater. Note the split boulder at the righthand edge of the photograph.\n\nIn the high-resolution version, a small, light-colored object appears about half a fiducial spacing to the right of the LM and is probably the ALSEP Central Station. Using the USGS map ( 4.3 Mb ), we can calculated that the angular separation of the LM and Central Station as seen from Station C-Prime is about 3.8 degrees, which is consistent with the separation in this image.\n\nAS14-64-9099 (OF300) ( 180k or 1074k )\n\n133:23:40 Rightward of 9098. The Station C1 white boulder, now known as Saddle Rock, is on the local horizon to the right of center, as indicated in a detail.\n\nAS14-64-9100 (OF300) ( 203k or 1198k )\n\nRightward of 9099, showing Saddle Rock just to the left of center.\n\nAS14-64-9100/1 ( 3.5 Mb or 0.6 Mb )\n\nRed-blue anaglyph by Erwin D'Hoore.\n\nAS14-64-9101 (OF300) ( 211k or 1188k )\n\nRightward of 9100.

In this frame from Al's Station C-Prime pan shows Ed at the front of the MET with his back to us. His upper sunshield is raised and the LM is just to the right of the sunshield tab. The ALSEP farther right. The close-up stereocamera is on the lefthand side of the MET. The west wall of the fragment-rich crater is on the left beyond Ed.\n\nErik van Meijgaarden has combined frames 9117 to 9120 in a mini-pan.\n\nAS14-64-9121 (OF300) ( 149k or 897k )\n\n133:23:40 Ed has moved out of the way and this picture gives us good detail of the front of the MET, including the triangular handle brace, the 16-mm camera, and the gnomon. The dustbrush that the astronauts use to dust themselves after each of the EVAs is hanging below the 16-mm camera on the right side of the MET. This brush is identical to the ones flown on the later missions. The white box attached to the side of the camera farthest from us is the battery pack. Training photo S70-34414 shows the battery pack and cables in more detail.\n\nAS14-64-9122 (OF300) ( 139k or 913k )\n\n133:23:47 This down-Sun completes Al's C-Prime pan.\n\nAS14-64-9123 (OF300) ( 291k or 1339k )\n\n133:31:19 Al takes a stereopair of the double core at Station C-Prime. Both are taken cross-Sun to the south. Along the upper edge, we can see the fragment-rich crater that Al photographed in his pan. See AS14-64-9118.\n\nAS14-64-9123/4 Red-Blue Anaglyph ( 9Mb or 388k )\n\nRed-blue anaglyph by Kevin Frank.\n\nAS14-64-9123/4 Red-Blue Anaglyph ( 3.8 Mb or 0.4 Mb )\n\nRed-blue anaglyph by Erwin D'Hoore.\n\nAS14-64-9124 (OF300) ( 304k or 1407k )\n\nAl steps to his right to take this stereo companion of 9124.\n\nAS14-64-9125 (OF300) ( 333k or 1465k )\n\n133:35:48 Al took a stereopair of his sampling area at station C-Prime.\n\nAS14-64-9125/6 Red-Blue Anaglyph ( 2.5 Mb or 433k )\n\nRed-blue anaglyph by Erwin D'Hoore.\n\nAS14-64-9126 (OF300) ( 318k or 1398k )\n\nAl stepped to his left to take this stereo companion to 9125.\n\nAS14-64-9127 (OF300) ( 279k or 1232k )\n\nAl took this \"after\" photograph of the spot from which he took a sample from a small secondary impact. The spot is just up-Sun of the gnomon nearest the camera.\n\nAS14-64-9128 (OF300) ( 293k or 1333k )\n\n133:43:30 This photo documents the football-sized rock that Al collected near Saddle Rock.\n\nAS14-64-9128/9 Red-Blue Anaglyph ( 1.8 Mb or 350k )\n\nRed-blue anaglyph by Erwin D'Hoore.\n\nAS14-64-9129 (OF300) ( 277k or 1258k )\n\nAl stepped to his left to take this stereo companion to 9128.\n\nAS14-64-9130 (OF300) ( 273k or 1357k )\n\n133:51:57 \"Before\" photo of Filleted Rock at Station C2.

The sample location may be at the lower left.\n\nAS14-64-9134 (OF300) ( 162k or 1034k )\n\n134:04:53 During the traverse to Station F, Al made a short detour to this large boulder while Ed continued on with the MET. Al had planned to step behind a large boulder - one bigger than himself - to see if there was any effect on communications with Ed or with Houston, but this boulder proved to be too small for the experiment. Before rejoining Ed, he did take three photographs of the boulder. This boulder is known as Weird Rock, after nearby Weird Crater. Note that Al has not changed focus since taking 9133, so all three photos of Weird Rock are out-of-focus.\n\nAS14-64-9135 (OF300) ( 181k or 1041k )\n\n134:04:53 Al's close-up of Weird Rock.

The prominent foreground crater is Meitner, which has a diameter of 87 km. Journal Contributor Henri Partanen notes that the photos in this sequence are very similar to an Apollo 12 earthrise series that starts with AS12-47-6879. Those photos were also taken at AOS just prior to descent initiation. Because the Apollo 12 and 14 landing sites are both equatorial and are only separated by about 10 degrees of longitude, the orbital planes are similar. A comparison of Celestia images of the Moon as viewed from Earth at the time of the two landings shows that the Moon was in similar libration states. Consequently, the views at AOS should be much the same. See, also, a labeled version ( 2.7 Mb ) by René Cantin.\n\nER*, the online nickname of an anonymous ALSJ contributor and member of Russian-language forums IXBT and Airbase, calls attention to an image of Venus in each of the five frames of the Earthrise sequence, 9224 to 9228.

Al is shading his eyes, probably looking up toward Cone Crater. Note the red stripe on the top of Al's helmet. This and similar stripes on his arms and legs help distinguish him from Ed, who has no stripes.\n\nWatch Detail (OF300) ( 222k )\n\nLennie Waugh has captured a detail which gives us an excellent view of Al's Omega Speedmaster Watch, which reads approximately 9:00. Waugh notes that the picture was taken at about transcript time of 113:52. This time does not reflect a 40 minute 2.9 second mission clock update performed at 54:53:36 but, rather, is the time since the actual launch at 21:03 GMT/UTC on 31 January 1971. Consequently, the photo was taken at about 14:55 GMT/UTC on 5 February, or 08:55 US Central Standard Time. The astronauts kept their watches on Houston time, as confirmed by this detail.\n\nAS14-66-9230 (OF300) ( 121k or 842k )\n\n113:52:32 Ed took this photo of Al out the right-hand, LMP window. Al is shading his eyes, probably looking up toward Cone Crater. Note the red stripe on the top of Al's helmet. This and similar stripes on his arms and legs help distinguish him from Ed, who has no stripes. This photo provides good views of Al's cuff checklist, his Omega watch, and the strap-on pocket on his left thigh.\n\nAS14-66-9231 (OF300) ( 88k or 720k )\n\n114:44:02 Down-Sun Al at the U.S. flag.

Before taking this series, they turned the flag so that it was face on to the 16-mm DAC mounted on the MET. After they finished taking these three tourist pictures, they turned the flag so it was face on to the TV camera. See a discussion following 131:09:18.\n\nAt this point Ed passed the camera to Al Shepard. Note that unlike on Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 there are no pictures of the LMP descending the ladder.\n\nAS14-66-9233 (OF300) ( 89k or 732k )\n\n114:45:46 Down-Sun portrait of Ed at the U.S. flag.

Right side and aft section of the LM, looking south. An excellent picture of the LM with many structural details are visible. The area under, and slightly behind the engine bell shows evidence of disturbed soil resulting from the Descent Engine exhaust. Also visible in the crater next to the rear (-Z) footpad is the track made by the probe as it scraped across the surface. The right (+Y) footpad has dug into the soft rim of a crater, causing the LM to slide slightly. Refer, also, to AS14-66-9269, a view of the left (-Y) footpad to see more evidence of this northward slide.\n\nThe lightweight construction of the LM is apparent in this picture. Minor buckling of panels covering the aft equipment bay and right side of the LM are visible. Notice also thermal damage done to the RCS plume deflectors. The extensive use of gold tape to secure the black insulation blankets can be seen.\n\nAS14-66-9255 (OF300) ( 188k or 1112k )\n\n114:53:38 View of the right side of the LM, and the right (+Y) strut in particular. The footpad is buried in the crater rim, and scrape marks of the probe are visible at the very top of the crater rim. The cosmic ray experiment package is attached to the lower part of the landing gear strut. Forward of the strut is the MESA (partially in shadow) and the S-Band antenna is at the far right of the picture. A labeled detail shows a helium vent associated with the descent stage oxidizer tanks as well and five others. See a discussion in the Apollo 11 Mobility chapter.\n\nErik van Meijgaarden has combined 9254 and 9255 as a 4 o'clock portrait of the LM.\n\nAS14-66-9255-56 Red-Blue Anaglyph ( 0.6 Mb )\n\nRed-blue anaglyph by Eric Jones.\n\nAS14-66-9256 (OF300) ( 150k or 998k )\n\nThis is a good down-Sun portrait of the S-Band antenna. The MESA is beyond the strut at the left edge of the picture.\n\nAS14-66-9256-57 Red-Blue Anaglyph ( 0.4 Mb )\n\nRed-blue anaglyph by Eric Jones.\n\nAS14-66"
