        "text": "Introduction: On Foot, In Saddle, and With Motor, Oar, and Paddle Part I. Primary Explorations Part II. To, Into, and Expressing the Canyon Part III. Down (and Up) the Colorado [¶] So much has been written about the Grand Canyon from personal experience that it may be surprising that a comprehensive record of these impressions has never been put together. Never has every reference been compiled—nor for that matter have so many items been forgotten from the very time they were published. Yes, there are bibliographies, but most of them are specialized or embrace the tremendous hail of everything that goes beyond personal records and impressions. The Grand Canyon! cites, quotes, and annotates the published records of personal encounters with the Grand Canyon, or accounts told on behalf of those who were there, from 1540 to 2022. Many of the items that are now in the public domain (published before 1927) are quoted from, sometimes at length. Numerous publications are in languages other than English; titles and quotations from them are provided in the original languages and in translation. [¶] This volume documents what is otherwise understood only by intuition or supposition— that the Grand Canyon is an intensely attractive draw, and people have “used” its resources intensely. It goes beyond prose, gathering up the works of poets and the publications that record the work of artists, photographers, musicians, cinematographers, and architects—all of those people who have used their crafts to express their impressions of the canyon. And it has seemed logical to split the main part of this volume into the two principal Grand Canyon venues—arriving and seeing it from the rim and on its trails, and experiencing it along the Colorado River. [¶] This bibliography has a complementary volume composed exclusively of edited quotations from the experiences of visitors to the Grand Canyon, 1540–1926. See \"My God, there it is!\" (also uploaded to Acadmia.edu). __________________________ [¶] NOTE To Federal and Native American Administrators [¶] THE GRAND CANYON! documents the “use” of the lands you manage as a resource in and of itself. Much of it probably has never come to your attention and thus it may offer a new perspective of the breadth of interest and participation that people have had with the Grand Canyon. These items are, each in their own way, reports of activities; and however elegantly or not the experiences are described or portrayed, their value is limited if an audience does not know of them. [¶] This bibliography omits publications that pertain to scientific research and to cultural resources of the Grand Canyon. Thousands of these publications are already cited and summarized in other bibliographies and documentary sources [see this website in particular]. Instead, here are personal reports and perspectives, first-hand or told on behalf of the participants. [¶] The people who are cited in this bibliography are from around the world. They express their encounters with the Grand Canyon through writing, lecturing, painting, sculpting, photographing, filming, composing music and theatrical performances, and designing architecture. In their activities they share their experiences and impart their impressions of visits to the Grand Canyon, briefly and indulgently alike. These people are your authorities on the ways the Grand Canyon is “used,” by the general public mostly, your expert witnesses to personal Grand Canyon experiences. [¶] The writers and poets have communicated in many languages. The prose accounts not in English are translated herein—often for the first time, so they are bound to be newly recovered information. Writers’ abilities to communicate themselves are subjective, of course, but they all are undeniable. The record assembled here provides far more information than has previously been available. It shows how the world has interacted with the canyon, over centuries. It forms a set of authentic references that document the attention to, activities on, and impressions of the lands that are today secured by governmental agencies of the United States and Native peoples.\n\nAt least 13 federally recognized Native American tribes are culturally and historically associated with the Great Bend of the Gila, a distinctive stretch of the lower Gila River valley and surrounding landscape in rural southwestern Arizona. The cultural landscape of the Great Bend is renowned for its impressive body of unique and nationally significant archaeological and historical sites, including an abundance of world-class rock art. The vast majority of these cultural resources are attributable to the ancestors, as well as the ancient and contemporary cultural traditions of the 13 associated tribes. To celebrate and better preserve this fragile, multi-cultural landscape—and the contemporary and future human connections to it—a Great Bend of the Gila National Monument (restricted solely to lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management) has been proposed. As assessed through a review of prior cultural affiliation studies, ethnohistorical literature, and ethnographic projects in and around the Great Bend of the Gila, the 13 federally recognized tribes referenced above include: (1) Ak-Chin Indian Community; (2) Cocopah Indian Tribe; (3) Colorado River Indian Tribes; (4) Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation; (5) Fort Mojave Indian Tribe; (6) Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe; (7) Gila River Indian Community; (8) Hopi Tribe; (9) Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community; (10) Tohono O’odham Nation; (11) Yavapai-Apache Nation; (12) Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe; and (13) Pueblo of Zuni. This study provides ethnographic overviews of 11 of the associated tribes (Colorado River Indian Tribes and Fort Mojave Indian Tribe were unable to participate), with specific focus on their cultural, historical, and contemporary ties to the landscape and cultural resources encompassed by the proposed national monument. This study merges background research with contemporary tribal perspectives, as shared through recent meetings with tribal representatives and culturally knowledgeable elders, to: (1) examine each participating tribe’s connection to the Great Bend landscape and its cultural and natural resources; (2) evaluate the heritage value the participating tribes attribute to them; (3) assess the participating tribes’ interests in better conserving the Great Bend landscape and better preserving the cultural resources within it; and (4) ascertain the participating tribes’ support for establishing a Great Bend of the Gila National Monument. The ethnographic overviews demonstrate that each participating tribe maintains a unique connection to the Great Bend of the Gila that is particular to their community’s history, identity, and values. Meetings with the tribes’ cultural resource professionals and advisors, and in some instances, their governing bodies, revealed that each participating tribe is concerned about the long-term preservation of the Great Bend of the Gila’s landscape and the cultural resources within. Further, each participating tribe supports increased effort, investment, and accountability on the part of the Bureau of Land Management for protecting cultural resources on federal lands in the Great Bend area, and for engaging associated tribes more consistently, effectively, and respectfully in the area’s management and the interpretation of its cultural resources. As formal acts of support, to date eight of the 11 participating tribes have issued official Letters of Support or Tribal Resolutions backing the establishment of a Great Bend of the Gila National Monument."
