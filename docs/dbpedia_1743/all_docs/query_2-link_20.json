        "text": "Object history\n\nThe Bettine, Lady Abingdon Collection. Bequeathed by Mrs T. R. P. Hole. Item Provenance: Provenance: (Presumably) Sir Charles Stuart; by descent to his daughter Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford, to her cousin Major-General Edward Stuart Wortley; bought by his son-in-law the 8th Earl of Abingdon; bequeathed to Mrs. T.R.P. Hole 1978.\n\nListed as Lot 751 in the Highcliffe sale.\n\nThe Lady Bettine Abingdon Collection. Bequeathed by Mrs T. R. P. Hole, 1987\n\nHistorical significance: David, one of the Jacobite court's official painters, produced from 1726 several versions of this portrait in a similar format but different costume. Two versions (Scottish National Portrait Gallery and Borghese-Aldobrandini Collection, Rome) are signed and dated 1732. The present painting is presumably a copy or a studio version; the inscribed date of 1740 may not be correct. An earlier attribution, to Alexis Simon Belle (1674-1734), is unlikely."
