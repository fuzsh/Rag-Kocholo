        "text": "The nature of commencement celebrations has taken many forms throughout the university's history. Through taking a look at the speakers, the titles of their speeches, and some photographs exhibiting different traditions associated with the exercises, one can see how commencement celebrations at the University of Missouri have come to be what they are today.\n\nNote: The University Archives does not possess the texts of every speech, but throughout the list more information, possibly including speech texts, is provided when possible. Also, the researcher is encouraged to search our holdings to find more information.\n\nNote: All images are thumbnails to larger photographs.
