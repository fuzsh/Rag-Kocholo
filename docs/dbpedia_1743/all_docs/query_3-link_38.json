        "text": "Who is the fairest of them all?\n\n— Brothers Grimm, “Snow White”\n\nWe are at a crossroads. It is the beginning of a new administration and the end of an old one. There are those who would like to forget the last eight years. It’s the magic-slate idea. As if you could lift up an acetate window and those eight years would suddenly vanish.\n\nPhotographs make this somewhat more difficult. They are a partial record of who we were and how we imagined ourselves. They remind us that we have a past and that we are the sum of our past experiences. They reassert that unassailable fact.\n\nThe traveling pool of press photographers that follows presidents includes representatives from three wire services — AP (The Associated Press), AFP (Agence France-Presse) and Thomson Reuters. During the last week of the Bush administration, I asked the head photo editors of these news services — Vincent Amalvy (AFP), Santiago Lyon (AP) and Jim Bourg (Reuters) — to pick the photographs of the president that they believe captured the character of the man and of his administration. There are overlapping pictures — of the president with a bullhorn at Ground Zero, of the president looking out the window of Air Force One over New Orleans, of the president receiving the news on the morning of 9/11. It is interesting that these pictures are different. They may be of the same scene, but they have different content. They speak in a different way.\n\n(The photos are reproduced here with their original captions, unedited.)\n\nVincent Amalvy (AFP), who started his job a couple of years into the Bush administration, is struck by the uncommon access Americans have to our head-of-state. His selections include shadows, reflections, the unexpected things that happen in an image — the president’s own shadow flanking the seal of the United Nations, the shadow that accompanies Bush and Barack Obama on a walk into the Rose Garden. Santiago Lyon (AP), on the other hand, speaks of the ways in which presidential images are scripted and posed, how very little is left to chance. Jim Bourg (Reuters) has selected images that showcase his fascination with odd juxtapositions and found moments of great emotion.\n\nVincent Amalvy\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: O.K. Now, this is typically George Bush. He is looking very friendly and very comfortable when visiting the troops, et cetera, et cetera. So that’s for me a kind of typical picture of George Bush, what he was during this period. And I remember this picture was taken during a period where the situation was not so comfortable in Iraq. If I am wrong, please let me know. But I think that’s what I mean. And that it’s just George Bush in the middle of the soldiers and the troops. He is looking like the Commander in Chief.\n\nERROL MORRIS: It’s also interesting that the picture is taken, of course, in Texas.\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: Yes. It’s taken at home.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Yes. You know, one thing I wanted to talk to you about before we go through the photographs. This press conference, the last press conference. What fascinates me is that George W. Bush often references photographs. What disturbs him most is the photographs that make him look bad. So, for example, there’ll be “Mission Accomplished,” and he’ll say, “Well, you know, that was a bad idea to put up Mission Accomplished.” But he doesn’t say, for example, it might have been a bad idea to go to war for fraudulent reasons. Or it might have been a bad idea to destabilize an entire country or to immiserate an entire population.\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: But remember, the question that was being asked to him two months ago? Somebody asked him, “What do you have any regrets about, the war in Iraq, et cetera?” And he said, “O.K., maybe I got the wrong information, you know.” He opened the door, maybe the information that I got was wrong. But [at the last press conference], he was not answering those questions.\n\nERROL MORRIS: No. Or in the case of Katrina, the photograph that was taken of him looking out the window of Air Force One. In his last press conference he expresses concern not about the lack of coordinated federal response to a hurricane devastated city, but about the bad impression left by the photograph. It goes back to the photograph, not to the underlying reality.\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: Yes, quite. It’s a kind of caricature from Europe, about George Bush. He’s looking very natural sometimes. But not very engaged. I don’t know exactly what’s part of it. But sometimes, is he reacting? Is he joking? For example, at the Christmas party. When he was joking with this guy who was a [Bush impersonator].\n\nERROL MORRIS: Tell me about that one.\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: I like this picture because I was surprised by the humor. He was able to joke about himself and to party with the guy, you know. And I was a little bit surprised by that.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Why?\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: Because I was not expecting this kind of humor from George Bush or from a head-of-state.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Is this so atypical from Europe?\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: It is not typical for Europe. Try to imagine Sarkozy doing this.\n\nI don’t know, but I was surprised by that. That’s the reason I put this picture in. Because I remember the sequence of these pictures, when we did them. And I like these pictures. But I can’t imagine, really, in Europe the president in the same situation and joking as he did. The story is a real American story. It’s very typical from America, you know. And we don’t have any equivalent of these shows in Europe. The president never attends this kind of show with jokes and impersonators. Here, there is no way for the president to escape.\n\nERROL MORRIS: You also sent a picture of Bush and Putin waving in the Volga.\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: I selected it because it was like the end of the Cold War. Is it a picture of typically what can happen during an official meeting between an American and a Russian? But this is the completion of the Cold War.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Yes. We were on the verge of annihilating each other, and this is how it ends. Tens of thousands of nuclear warheads targeted at each other followed by a ride in a ’56 Volga.\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: The picture was really a huge success. And I liked it.\n\nERROL MORRIS: And then there was the shadow of Bush. Images can be interpreted in a myriad of different ways, but here he’s a ghost haunting the United Nations.\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: George Bush was never part of the U.N., really. And so, that’s a kind of joke, his shadow is enough. Also, the shadow behind Obama and Bush, when Obama was visiting Bush at the White House.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Yes. Why do you like the picture so much?\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: We don’t understand what is going on. Why does the shadow appear? I suppose it’s a shadow of somebody else beyond the corner. But the picture is only of two guys walking. It’s a profile of George Bush and Barack Obama. And he’s near the Rose Garden of the White House. And so in the back is a shadow of somebody who says, “Bye-bye.” And it is looking like a joke, but it is amazing.\n\nERROL MORRIS: And the photograph from Iraq?\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: Because he’s looking a little bit anxious. He’s not looking so comfortable as in the other picture when he was on the base in Texas. This time he’s looking not so comfortable. I like it because you can see his anxiety about the situation in Iraq.\n\nERROL MORRIS: And you have selected the photograph of Andrew Card talking to George Bush. This is the morning of 9/11.\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: O.K., this picture of Bush is very famous, no? Very famous. The moment is unbelievably strong. The guy has just heard something. I was in Paris during this period. I was looking on the TV. What’s happened? And after we got this picture, everybody said, “He doesn’t understand.” It was a big confusion, everywhere, and on his face, too.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Is there anything about the expression on his face?\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: He looks completely blank. He doesn’t understand, really, what’s happened. In the picture we can see his eyes — something very strange has happened; he doesn’t understand. He doesn’t seem to understand what the guy is saying.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Yes. And then there’s a picture in France, Colleville-sur-Mer.\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: We are coming back to Iraq and to the consequences of war. It is a picture of the head-of-state in the middle of a cemetery. That’s the huge responsibility of his job. It’s a difficult job because ultimately you are responsible.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Indeed. And then the umbrella picture?\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: Because always something is wrong. It’s a joke.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Yes, but maybe it’s true.\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: Always something is wrong. The guy grabs the umbrella, but the umbrella is going the wrong way. And he’s looking like, again, something is wrong.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Something is wrong. He doesn’t seem to realize that something has happened to his umbrella.\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: That’s the George Bush attitude, you know.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Yes. So is there a way to say how these photographs sum up an administration, or why the photographs are important in understanding this history?\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: In America it’s interesting because the position when you are part of the press pool, you have access to everywhere the president goes. And for me, that’s very important.\n\nERROL MORRIS: And different from Europe.\n\nVINCENT AMALVY: Yes, different from everywhere else. It’s a different situation in Europe. In America when you are part of the presidential pool, you move everywhere with the president. It’s not that way in other countries. You don’t have the same quantity of free access to all these attitudes, pictures and opportunities. So that’s the reason. And that’s part of my job; it’s very interesting. When Barack Obama became the president-elect, there is the same access, same obligation as from the president to be as transparent as possible. But there’s no choice for him. He can’t decide, “No press now, yes, no.” In France or in Spain or in Germany or in the Middle East or whatever, it is different. The president decides where the press can go and where they can’t go. Here it is different. It’s one of the good points about your democracy. The power of the press is a reality in this country.\n\nSantiago Lyon\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: We should start with Bush at Ground Zero with the bullhorn, three days after 9/11.\n\nHe went to Ground Zero, and was photographed at the site on the wreckage with a fireman. One thing that’s obvious, but it’s worth bringing out there, is that there are very few casual photographs of the president of the United States. The whole thing is managed. With the exception of the guy hurling the shoe at him, these are all photo opportunities that are organized by the White House Press Department and set up for the members of the traveling pool or media group that accompanies him everywhere. So you have to look at them within that framework, that it’s being orchestrated to send a message. And, in this case, the message is that the Commander in Chief is getting his feet dirty at the site of the attacks, and is showing that he cares, that he’s in control, that he’s a leader.\n\nERROL MORRIS: You actually see his feet in the frame.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Exactly. Now, that said, there was an AP photographer who was part of the traveling pool, who went there. It was orchestrated by the White House to show the image of George Bush as president of the United States at the scene of Ground Zero. It’s an historic image.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Well, it’s part of the iconography of 9/11. It’s a photograph that everybody remembers. Well, I remember George Bush with the bullhorn; I didn’t remember the arm around the firefighter.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: He’s got his arm around the guy’s shoulder. He’s concentrating on him. The other fellow in the picture, his lips are tight as though he trying to hold back emotion. He’s got a distant stare. It’s almost as though he’s choking up a little bit, and Bush is comforting him. The next one I have is “Mission Accomplished,” where we’ve got him on the podium on the aircraft carrier with the banner behind. At the time, it produced a raised eyebrow for some, “Well, is the mission accomplished? How do you know the mission is accomplished?” And more importantly, “What exactly is the mission?”\n\nAnd then, of course, the events afterwards bore that out. And this photograph was resurrected as the levels of American soldiers dying in Iraq began to rise.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Bush, at his final press conference, was asked if he regretted something; it’s that regret question. And when Bush said he regretted “Mission Accomplished,” it was as though what he regretted was the photograph. Regret that this photograph had made him look bad, had compromised his public image.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: What I wonder about this picture is, Bush didn’t go up there and put the sign up there. His people did, or the U.S. military did, and they ran it by the White House Press Office, who said, “Great idea.” I don’t know the details, but clearly he agreed to speak in front of that sign, knowing that there would be a picture of him with that sign in the background. He has to take responsibility for it. But, you’ve got to wonder, was he really aware of how silly this looked, given that the war was going on?\n\nERROL MORRIS: Anybody who takes photographs knows that getting the podium, the position of the president, the lighting, the sign in the background, so that it can be framed nicely from certain angles, that’s not something that happens by accident.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: There were the “Turf Builders,” photographers who accompanied the White House advance teams in the Reagan era, sending one photographer to reconnoiter the photo opportunities on foreign presidential travel. They visited the scenes where the president was going to be photographed and took notes on the locations and distances to assist the photographers who would later travel with the president. They produced a guide that told you what lens to use and what the light was going to be. They no longer do that, but I feel that the existence of such a procedure spoke to the orchestration of White House photo opportunities. O.K., the next one is the flight suit with the thumbs up and the headgear on.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Yes.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Talk about hamming it up for the camera. He’s got one of those faces that could belong to another era, to a World War Two-ish war hero era. O.K., moving along, turkey, Thanksgiving in Baghdad.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Another close-up?\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: There are times when I like close-ups. And then there are times when there are moodier pictures that benefit from more atmosphere, but this was a surprise visit to Baghdad, done under cover of night, photographers not allowed, and media people accompanying him not allowed to tell anybody where they were going, and then arriving in Baghdad for Thanksgiving, that most American of things. And there he is, serving a turkey to men and women of the military. It was the classic photo-op, but also pretty daring when you think that, at that time, Baghdad is a dangerous place.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Wasn’t there an accusation (at the time) that the turkey was a fake turkey.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Yeah, I remember something about that, too. There was something as to whether that was an ornamental turkey. The way these mess kitchens work, there’s no time to actually carve a turkey. It’s all pre-carved and put into hot plates. And the troops move along the counter, and the stuff is slopped into their trays, and then off they go. So we concluded that it was a real bird. But that it wasn’t one that was necessarily going to be eaten at that meal at that time. O.K. The next is Bush hugging the Katrina survivor. It’s Biloxi or someplace.\n\nERROL MORRIS: And this is after he received criticism for not landing in New Orleans?\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Yes. I believe it was. Katrina was an important event in his presidency, because of the criticism that he took for not having done all that some people said could have been done. It does show him being human and trying to show the quality of leadership. But it is interesting when you look at the date the picture was made, it’s a couple of days after the hurricane.\n\nERROL MORRIS: When you picked the Katrina photographs, you also included the picture in the airplane. Why?\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Because the picture is on Air Force One. It is his first glimpse of the catastrophe. You can’t see very well through the window. You can see a little bit of a river. It looks like the Mississippi or something in the middle window. But you can’t really tell that it’s flooding. Nevertheless, it became a picture of his response to Katrina. Again, I thought it was engineered. There he is, by himself, in Air Force One, looking out the window. A wider frame would show other photographers, aides surrounding him. But it was one of these photo opportunities designed to show his reaction to the crisis.\n\nERROL MORRIS: You picked a pair of Katrina photographs. One photograph is a response to a criticism of another photograph. Which brings us to another pair of photographs, Bush at Ground Zero and the reading of “My Pet Goat,” in the classroom.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Where Andy Card is whispering into his ear? That’s the moment where he learns of this massive attack. He’s in a classroom setting. That’s one of those pictures where you have to read the caption to know what’s going on.\n\nERROL MORRIS: It is an iconic scene, if not an iconic photograph. Everyone has seen one version of it or another. In the AFP he has a blank look. Your version has a normalcy to it. You can see the kids in the foreground. Card is shielded by the president’s face.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: I don’t have the AFP picture in front of me, but the look on Bush’s face in this picture is not so much blank; he’s listening. And he’s hearing this news in a setting that’s far removed from the normal things that a president does. And he gets this news, and it’s a moment where the so-called leader of the free world is informed of an attack that then is redefined. It is changed from a terrorist attack to an act of war.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Yes, the entire world pivots.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Sure. This is where the man who is so powerful and who has the ability to make decisions gets the news. And then he makes a series of decisions that had a lasting effect on the way America is perceived around the world.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Let’s go to the next one.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Rumsfeld. Bush showing Rumsfeld out of the Oval Office.\n\nThis was the moment where Bush reacts to the political pressure to get rid of Rumsfeld, who had underestimated the number of troops that it would require to secure Iraq after the invasion. Bush is showing him the door, after announcing that he is leaving. This is moment where he thanks Rummy, “See you later.”\n\nERROL MORRIS: Bush is looking at Rumsfeld, but Rumsfeld is looking away – lost in his thoughts, or maybe he’s just looking at the floor.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Moving along to Nancy Pelosi midterm elections, Republican defeat, woman as the Speaker of the House.\n\nBush makes the gesture to come up and shake her hand and look her in the eye and do the polite thing. It represents the loss in those midterm elections, the impatience of the voters.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Are they shaking hands or just thinking of arm wrestling?\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Next one is the Walter Reed scene, where this soldier has got his leg all pinned up.\n\nThe soldier’s wife is presenting Bush with her baby. The image of the politician and baby is such a cliché. How many times have we seen a politician kissing a baby, holding the baby up, looking at the baby? But in this case, there’s something much more sobering, because of the veteran who is in the foreground. He’s got a prosthetic leg and his other leg is being held together with screws and pins. He’s looking over to see what’s going on. And Bush is looking at the soldier’s wife, and there’s the baby in the middle, the quintessential image of innocence. And in the background, you’ve got the reporters taking notes.\n\nERROL MORRIS: You’re very much aware of people setting a stage and creating an opportunity for a photograph. You feel an element of control. Vincent Amalvy (from Agence France-Presse), on the other hand, kept stressing our extraordinary access to the president.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Well, I was born in Europe and grew up in Europe and have worked a considerable amount in Europe and in other parts of the world. And it is true that the American system, and especially the White House, allows much more access because they’re much more media-savvy. The White House understands the power of the image. And that’s where I sometimes get the feeling that we’re all being manipulated. It is true that we do get access to a much larger extent, than many other world leaders allow it. And that’s something to be thankful for, in the sense that we’re able to witness White House activities. But, at the same time, the thing is so contrived and so controlled that like any consumer of information, it behooves one to look at the source of the information, to look at the circumstances of the information, and to be able to cast a critical eye on it.\n\nERROL MORRIS: So let’s go on.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: The shoe-throwing incident, which is not technically a photograph. It’s a high quality still from video. The still photographers missed the moment.\n\nBut there were a number of TV cameras in the back of the room belonging to different agencies. And when this happened, a lot of them zoomed in, or zoomed out, or moved the camera around. And the AP television news cameraman, from whom this videotape is lifted, he held his shot wide, wider than this. This is a crop. I thought it was remarkable, throwing something at a public figure in a press conference. We’re checked for weapons, explosives, x-rayed. We’re sent through magnetometers. The security is pretty rigorous. It just happened to be the guy’s shoe. And then hurl it at the president of the United States, not once but twice? Next image. Oh, all the presidents together, the five — well, four presidents and one president-elect.\n\nIt’s almost as though these could have been cardboard cutouts at first glance, just the way that they’re all standing there with frozen smiles on their faces, and Obama in between the two Bushes, and Carter off to one side, a little bit aloof.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Five presidents, five different ways of looking at reality. And there is Obama leaning away from #43, talking to #41.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: They seem to be having a laugh together, or as they say in caption-English, “sharing a light moment.”\n\nERROL MORRIS: Yup. And the door.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Holding the door, I thought, was funny. This was at a conference or someplace, and he’s ready to exit and goes to the door. And the door’s locked, because the real door was in the wall behind him. When he realized his mistake, he hammed it up. When you look at the video of this scene, you see him putting on this face, a very self-deprecating humor. It showed an ability to realize when he’d made a mistake, and not be shy about it. At the same time, for a certain viewer, it may have confirmed their views of the man.\n\nERROL MORRIS: I couldn’t understand the picture, because I didn’t know that the door was locked. Which changes it.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Because if you don’t know the door is locked, you wonder why he’s making that face. This is the whole thing about the importance of context and captions. Pictures need captions to put them in context.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Your last picture is the one of them lined up at the ranch in Crawford.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Right. That’s Condoleezza Rice, Dick Cheney, Rumsfeld and Admiral Myers. So this is the brain trust. This picture is in a rural setting. Everybody else is business-casual. And Bush is wearing his jeans and his cowboy boots. They’re standing there in the middle of nowhere. And yet, you’ve got all these microphones at the side. It’s clearly a media opportunity.\n\nERROL MORRIS: What are they trying to say by setting up this photograph?\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Bush spent a lot of time down in Crawford. I believe 384 days in total, a full year out of his presidency. But, presumably, they got some work done down there. The protective pool is always sent down there, but is generally left outside. There hasn’t been a lot of access to Crawford. It’s his one sanctuary. You don’t see much. And yet, occasionally they have to talk. The war going on in Iraq, he’s ensconced in Crawford with the vice president, two secretaries and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It’s another press conference, but in a different setting.\n\nERROL MORRIS: His outdoors-iness and ruggedness become part of the underlying story.\n\nSANTIAGO LYON: Right. The whole thing, from yard work to office work.\n\nJames Bourg\n\nJIM BOURG: What we’re looking for in our presidential coverage are striking moments and moments that appear to reveal something about the president or the event or the news that is happening at the time. That’s what we try to achieve; compelling images regardless of what they might say to an individual reader or the viewer and we leave it to them to interpret the images. It’s interesting to see how differently people will interpret the same picture, how a strong supporter of the president will see a picture one way and a critic of the president will see it a different way. There have been some pictures of President George W. Bush where the reactions have actually gone all over the map, where some Bush supporters see interpret the image as taking a cheap shot at him. Other Bush supporters see that same moment as endearing or showing off his character, showing that he’s a regular kind of guy or showing that he’s a common, unpretentious type of person. And then there are pictures where a photo opportunity can totally backfire on the White House. An example of that would certainly be the “Mission Accomplished” banner on the aircraft carrier where that is a very straight photo as you look at it. It’s just the president standing in front of a banner. There’s no great depth to that photo, and yet I would say it’s certainly one of the most discussed photos of his entire presidency. If you asked a member of the public to think of key moments of his presidency, pictures they could remember, this would be very high on the list I would imagine. It was an extremely orchestrated event that was meant to show off their accomplishments and to put him in a good light. But an awful lot of people used the photo against him.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Let’s start with the Andy Card and 9/11.\n\nJIM BOURG: Photo-journalistically, it’s not a great photo. I talked to the photographer who shot it last night, and he was saying that at the time, not having any idea of the content of what was being whispered to the president, it seemed like a very inconsequential moment. And he almost didn’t take the picture as Card whispered to the president because you so often see the president’s aides whispering something to him off stage, or even on stage in a situation like that. And it didn’t seem significant at all. And yet in retrospect, it is perhaps the iconic moment of his presidency. It’s the reaction on his face as he listens to the news of the planes hitting the World Trade Center.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Well, it’s one of the big moments in history; the world changes. Santiago Lyon and Vincent Amalvy picked photographs of this scene that are quite different.\n\nJIM BOURG: Really?\n\nERROL MORRIS: AFP provides a close-up. Yours is wider, AP even wider. In the other photographs, Card’s face overlaps the president’s. In your photograph Card is no longer whispering to the president. And we are aware of the president’s eyes. They are the central element of the photograph. I have the feeling that he’s almost not there. I don’t know how you see the photograph?\n\nJIM BOURG: I’m not sure that I would want to— I really feel pretty strongly that we shouldn’t go too deeply into analyzing the pictures. That we honestly are creating a documentary record of the presidency and of the president and of the events that we cover.\n\nERROL MORRIS: And yet, every photograph cries out for an interpretation, for example, the photograph of Bush at the World Trade Center.\n\nJIM BOURG: That photograph is not the most compelling picture visually unless you know where it took place and when. The caption on that photo is certainly crucial. There are other contexts where George Bush has gone or walked through or stood on mounds of rubble on the heels of hurricanes or earthquakes or other natural disasters. There’s certainly more compelling images graphically than this one. But in the context of 9/11 and the World Trade Center, it really stands alone.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Some people have described this moment to me as the moment that Bush “found his voice.” The bullhorn, which people all remember. This is a scene that people come back to again and again and again. I like your version more. It’s the widest one, it gives a context to what I’m looking at. The one that came from AP, you just see the man’s hand resting on his knee.\n\nJIM BOURG: I actually edited this photo there in New York on the scene in 2001. I was looking to put him in the context of where he was – that he was literally on the rubble with the firefighters. And it was, frankly, not easy to do just because of the logistics of the photographers and the environment that the photographers were facing in the wreckage. I don’t think the average viewer looking at this picture realizes just how close this photographer is to the president. It’s an extremely wide-angle lens, and he’s literally right in front of him. So the ability to put it in context and show where Bush actually was is really a challenge in this situation. This is one image that we thought did that more than some of the others.\n\nERROL MORRIS: I agree. I’m very curious about the photographs of the “black period” between the scene in the classroom and the President being spirited off to somewhere in the midwest.\n\nJIM BOURG: It was a tough thing to cover. The White House left most of us behind. They grabbed one photographer, Doug Mills from AP, out of the pool and took him along with the president on that flight away from Florida, and they left much of the rest of the pool, including our photographer behind; 9/11 is one of the only times when we have been forced — because it was tough to take a stand on that day of all days — to abandon the full travel pool that must always be with the president model and let them narrow it down to just one single photographer leaving Florida. They said we had no choice in the matter; it was a national emergency and this is what they were going to do. And if one didn’t go, none were going to go. So one photographer went off with him.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Have those photographs ever been published?\n\nJIM BOURG: Everything he shot was pooled and went out on our wire as well as AFP’s and AP’s. But he wasn’t allowed to shoot very much.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Next is the turkey picture.\n\nJIM BOURG: It’s all about the moment. There were plenty of photographers there. It’s an open press event at the White House. Any photographer with a White House pass can come and shoot the picture in the Rose Garden. So there’s a whole line of photographers and as far as I can tell, because this picture has gotten as much attention as it has, only our photographer, Kevin Lemarque, had the combination of exactly this moment and exactly this angle, which made it the most published photograph of the event and a photograph that is referred back to and published again and again many years later.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Who are those guys in the background? The turkey wranglers?\n\nJIM BOURG: Yes, the turkey wranglers. Exactly. The New York Times did an entire slide show of these turkey pictures back at Thanksgiving. And someone wrote in on The Times blog and pointed out that in one of the old black and white pictures of Richard Nixon pardoning the turkey, that the guy in between him and the turkey in the background was a Latin American right-wing dictator who must have just been visiting the White House at the time and got in the turkey picture.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Maybe he was also looking for a pardon. Or asylum. The next one you have is President Bush speaks to reporters after meeting with members of the National Economic Council in the Cabinet Room at the White House.\n\nJIM BOURG: Right, but the statement in the second line is clearly one of the things that makes this picture as significant as it is. There was never a paucity of interesting Bush expressions throughout his term, and there were many opportunities to photograph him making many different faces, which could be interpreted in just myriad different ways, endlessly interpreted, as we were talking about before, you know, by supporters and detractors. And what we’ve generally tried to do is just capture some of the more compelling moments that in some cases seem to illustrate the point that he was trying to make, or the seriousness of the situation and sometimes just capturing his reactions.\n\nERROL MORRIS: You could call this “the-die-is-cast” photograph.\n\nJIM BOURG: It is representative of a lot of moments with him during this period of his presidency and of his demeanor throughout a lot of the events in the lead up to the war in Iraq.\n\nERROL MORRIS: And how would you describe that demeanor?\n\nJIM BOURG: You’re trying to lead me into the areas that I don’t like to stray into. Of characterizing and interpreting the moments we capture. And I would go back to my leadoff point once again, is that we are looking for the compelling imagery that grabs people’s attention and that, frankly, is likely to get in print. The first thing it has to do to get in print is grab an editor’s attention. And when you’re talking about something as heavily covered as the White House, the images do have to stand out in some way, either through the moment that’s captured or the content of the image.\n\nERROL MORRIS: “Mission Accomplished.” I’m not sure whether people had any awareness that this was going to be a central complaint about the administration as time went on. What amazes me about these photographs, all of the versions I’ve seen, it is absolutely clear that it was heavily orchestrated. There is very little that is accidental about this picture.\n\nJIM BOURG: Right.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Yes, even the sidelight on the president. Everything had been thought out in advance, the position of the sign, the position of the lectern. I see the lectern in the wider photographs of this same scene. It’s not the photographer in this instance who has manipulated this scene – through cropping or picking one image from many, many, many, many, this is something that was intended by the administration to be seen this way.\n\nJIM BOURG: One of the pictures that created a storm of controversy for us here at Reuters because it was an exclusive picture, was the picture of Bush writing the note at the U.N. asking Condi Rice’s permission to go to the bathroom. Do you remember that photo?\n\nERROL MORRIS: Of course. I had read that there was some controversy about that photograph, that it was enhanced so that you could—\n\nJIM BOURG: No, all we did was darken the paper, darken it down some so that you could actually see that there was any writing on it at all. Anyone who has ever shot pictures in that room at the U.N., and I’m one of them, can tell you then the lighting in that room at the U.N. is absolutely abysmal. The picture was exposed for the skin tones of the president and his jacket as we normally do. And so the paper in front of him was as a result severely overexposed. And all that we ever told anyone we had done, and all that was ever done to the photo, was that the paper was darkened down some so that you could actually see that there was any writing on it at all. Some people, the strongest critics of it, took that and ran with it. Someone having admitted that the photo had been altered in some way, when it wasn’t altered any more than other photos are to either correct the color or lighten a photo which has been shot too dark, or darken a photo which has been shot too light.\n\nERROL MORRIS: And that photograph was controversial because it showed what?\n\nJIM BOURG: That despite the fact that it was shot in a public place with the president fully aware that there were photographers directly above him, there in the U.N. as there always are, people felt that because of the content of the note, it might be an invasion of his privacy and a cheap shot at him. I think if the content of the note had been different, there likely would have been no controversy at all.\n\nERROL MORRIS: In these highly orchestrated images, “Mission Accomplished” being the most obvious example, one looks for things that have not been orchestrated, things that are spontaneous, unrehearsed, unplanned.\n\nJIM BOURG: Certainly that’s very much what we are always looking for. It is often the hardest thing to make, covering the president of the United States, to find anything that does, in fact, look spontaneous or unrehearsed because there is a large team of people and staff there at the White House whose job it is to always try to put the president in the best light possible and to insure that things don’t occur which would potentially make him look bad. And also, to try to convey the message that the administration and the president are seeking to convey, not just through what he says, but also through the images as well. That’s the talent of our White House photographers: to be able to work within the constraints that are imposed upon them by the White House staff, but also to fully document what’s going on.\n\nERROL MORRIS: One of the amazing things about photography is try as you might to control everything, you cannot. The U.N. photograph? Didn’t he have to be aware that he’s being photographed?\n\nJIM BOURG: He was certainly aware that there were photographers behind and above him. There’s no glass between the photographers and the dignitaries, the diplomats and the heads of state there. The U.N. Security Council is not that big a room. The press boxes are one level up and just behind where the leaders and the diplomats sit at the desks. You feel like you’re looming over them. So they’re very clearly aware of the photographers, and that is why we were amazed by some of the reaction, as if we had in some way intruded on a private moment. It was in a most public place being televised live and covered by photographers arrayed around a horseshoe shaped room in all directions around the president.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Here’s the next photograph that I have. Bush looking out the window of Air Force One.\n\nJIM BOURG: It is another photograph that has been repeatedly referred to as a defining moment of his presidency, a very controversial moment that sticks in people’s minds as a historic event. In the early days after Katrina hit, for whatever reason, this is the closest he came to the damage. There was a subsequent trip to New Orleans in later days. There is something to be said for the position that the White House takes, that it is disruptive and sometimes counterproductive for the president to drop into natural disasters too quickly because it distracts the police and law enforcement and otherwise rescue personnel from the challenges at hand in helping the survivors. Those of us in the White House press corps who’ve traveled with the president realize there is something to be said for that. It’s not just an excuse; it really isn’t.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Also interesting, the two photographs I have of Bush in Air Force One looking at New Orleans. The two photographs—\n\nJIM BOURG: Are different?\n\nERROL MORRIS: In the photograph that came from AFP, you don’t see out the windows. You’re aware of the windows, but you don’t see out of them. The president emerges from darkness. He’s illuminated by the light from that one window. And so you’re forced to imagine his POV. There is a sense of his isolation. His removal. The AP photograph looks past him, and the exposure is such that you see out the windows and can see part of landscape below.\n\nJIM BOURG: Really? But you probably see less of his face, right?\n\nERROL MORRIS: Yes. You see less of his face, and the photograph has a different impact as a result – not because someone has tried to put the president in a good or a bad light, but because different photographs of the same scene capture him in a different context, in a different relationship to what he’s looking at.\n\nJIM BOURG: That is the choice of the photographer to decide what it is they’re going for and what they’re going to prioritize. Are they going to prioritize seeing more of the president’s face or trying to put it in context and see out the window? And that’s an individual choice that each photographer scrambling in there has to quickly make.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Next one. George Bush reacts as he tries to open a locked door. Now, I’ve seen a number of these photos.\n\nJIM BOURG: The picture of the locked door, once again just an instant in time. A successful picture of the president is one that gets a strong reaction from people, be it positive or be it negative. He reacted very quickly. He went to the door, gave it a hard yank, it didn’t give. He expected it to pop open and he’d walk out it, but instead it was solidly locked and so he gave this reaction and then he did a very quick, impressively quick, recovery and spun around and went back in the direction he had come and back stage beside the podium. It was very quick. It is one of those presidential moments that the photographers had to be ready for an instant in time that would have been very easy to miss.\n\nERROL MORRIS: And the crying baby? This photograph was widely reprinted?\n\nJIM BOURG: That is one of my most controversial pictures that I shot myself. And one of my pictures that’s gotten the most attention. Bush supporters and Bush detractors seem to love it almost equally. People who support the president see it as a humorous and endearing moment, and detractors of the president and critics of the president see it as a very negative image. But, once again, it’s one of those moments where it was very quick, it was just an instantaneous reaction to the baby screaming and crying and I was lucky enough to capture the moment and it got very extensive publication overseas. It was not published extensively in the United States for some reason.\n\nERROL MORRIS: So let’s go on to the tears.\n\nJIM BOURG: O.K., so the tears. Similar to the baby picture, you know, beloved by his supporters and much used by his detractors. It wasn’t often that you saw George Bush become emotional and cry in the course of his presidency and as far as I remember, this was the first time that anyone saw him shed tears specifically related to casualties and the events in Iraq. It was also not published very much at all in the United States for whatever reason, and I don’t know how to interpret that. I’m not sure I want to try to interpret that, but it’s a very interesting thing to me.\n\nERROL MORRIS: Do you feel as a result of covering him that you got a feeling for him or got to know him in some sense?\n\nJIM BOURG: Considering that I have two pictures in here, I didn’t really cover him personally as much as you might think. Being the supervisor here and the editor in charge of the White House photographers, I’m not at the White House day in and day out. I tend to drop in for bigger events and not be there on a day-to-day basis. You will be very interested to read what my photographers have to say on our Reuters photographers blog on Reuters.com about covering President George W. Bush and about covering the White House. Some of them absolutely have gotten to know him personally and gotten to know him far better than I would claim to. There are a few of them who are on a first name basis with him, who he would call by name or by nickname as is his usual thing. But not nearly as much as his father. His father had a very, very unique and strong relationship with the still photographers. His father had a real attachment to, a real kinship with or a real appreciation for the still photographers. And that’s not something that we’ve ever felt as much from his son. His father knew every still photographer by name, and would inquire about their wives and children. He interacted with them more extensively than any other president we’ve seen in recent decades. That’s not as true with this President Bush, with George W. Bush.\n\nERROL MORRIS: So the picture of him walking back towards the Oval Office you picked?\n\nJIM BOURG: I could have picked a lot of pictures that have a similar tone to them in the last nine months. For whatever reason, he has allowed himself to be to be seen in this context quite a few times. Some of them are really quite compelling pictures of the president appearing alone and in some cases a setting and a stance and a manner that was very somber. It is striking to see the president of the United States heading back into the Oval Office alone. Once again, we don’t try to go too deeply into over-analyzing them, but a compelling picture is a compelling picture.\n\nERROL MORRIS: You mentioned some very recent pictures.\n\nJIM BOURG: I was planning describe to and you had asked me to choose ten photographs, but to tell you the truth, I was pretty tempted to supplement it with one of the pictures by our photographer Jason Reed from last night’s farewell address. I was paging through the thumbnails with our remote editing program as they came in live from the White House. And it is not often, with all the pictures I’ve edited, that I stop dead in my tracks and say, “Oh, my God,” but I did that last night. Bush finished his address to the nation, went back out through the doors, and the doors closed behind him and the national TV broadcast went off the air. And then after the live TV was off, the doors suddenly reopened, and he came back in to say goodbye to all the guests – his former cabinet members, his current cabinet members, Dick Cheney, his daughters, Laura and lots of other friends and supporters. He popped out that door, and when the door opened and he came through it, the look on his face was like no look I’d ever seen on George Bush’s face in my life. I actually flagged three versions as he comes through the door and his expression changes.\n\nAnd I turned to one of my editors — First I said, “Oh, my God.” And he said, “What?” And I said, “You’ve got to see this picture of Bush. This is really stunning.” And I flipped it over to him to process and his first reaction was, “Wow.” And I said, “If he wasn’t just back there behind that door crying, I don’t know what that look on his face is.” Because he just looks absolutely devastated as he comes through this door after essentially ending his eight year presidency. And it’s just really striking. He just looks absolutely devastated.\n\n*****\n\nIn his last press conference, Bush was asked about his critics. He talked about returning to Texas and looking in a mirror.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: …I don’t see how I can get back home in Texas and look in the mirror and be proud of what I see if I allowed the loud voices, the loud critics, to prevent me from doing what I thought was necessary to protect this country.\n\nHe was also asked if he had made any mistakes.\n\nQ: …I’m not trying to play “gotcha,” but I wonder, when you look back over the long arc of your presidency, do you think, in retrospect, that you have made any mistakes? And if so, what is the single biggest mistake that you may have made?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Gotcha. I have often said that history will look back and determine that which could have been done better, or, you know, mistakes I made. Clearly putting a “Mission Accomplished” on an aircraft carrier was a mistake. It sent the wrong message. We were trying to say something differently, but nevertheless, it conveyed a different message. Obviously, some of my rhetoric has been a mistake. I’ve thought long and hard about Katrina – you know, could I have done something differently, like land Air Force One either in New Orleans or Baton Rouge?\n\nFor the outgoing president, the “Mission Accomplished” banner was a mistake. Could the mistake be photography? That even the most heraldic of images could come back to haunt him? It might have been “a mistake” to put up the banner, but it is what he will be remembered for because the decision to put it up was enshrined in a photograph.\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., writing in 1859 (about 20 years after the first daguerreotypes appeared), called photography “a mirror with a memory.” [1] He writes,\n\n“The man beholdeth himself in the glass and goeth his way, and straightway both the mirror and the mirrored forget what manner of man he was…”\n\nFor Holmes, the photograph serves as a reminder to ourselves of who we are and how we are perceived. He might have been commenting on photographic portraits in particular, photography, in general, but his meaning is clear.\n\n“It has fixed the most fleeting of our illusions, that which the apostle and the philosopher and the poet have alike used as the type of instability and unreality. The photograph has completed the triumph, by making a sheet of paper reflect images like a mirror and hold them as a picture…”\n\nIt is interesting to note that Holmes does not say that photography has dispelled our most fleeting illusions, or revealed the reality behind them. Only that it preserves them as if in aspic or a piece of taxidermy. In Holmes’s era, photography was thought to capture reality. We know that photographs do not capture reality, but they can capture our evasions and self-deceptions. Now, more than 150 years after Holmes wrote this essay, we have an opportunity to reflect on the past and to ask that same fleeting question that intrigued Holmes: “what manner of man he was…”\n\n**********\n\nAcknowledgments: I would like to thank my researchers and editors, Ann Petrone and Julie Fischer, I would also like to thank my three interview subjects, Vincent Amalvy, Santiago Lyon and Jim Bourg — without them this article would not have been possible.\n\n**********\n\n[1] Holmes, “The Stereoscope and The Stereograph,” from The Atlantic Monthly, June, 1859."
