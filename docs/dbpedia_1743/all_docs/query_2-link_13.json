        "meta_description": "According to Lac Courte Oreilles oral tradition this petition, originally of birch bark, reflects the plea of the Bands of the Lake Superior Chippewa,  today called the Lac Courte Oreilles, St. Croix, Fond du Lac, Red Cliff and Bad River. It tells the story of what happened at the Sandy Lake Tragedy of the winter of 1850-1851 (see the Dictionary of Wisconsin History at left for a synopsis). The four lakes on the lower left represent the path to Sandy Lake. The double set of lines to the right of the lake mean that they travel over land to the first body of water (St. Louis River). On the way back, the headmen of the Bands/Clans met at Fond du Lac and there this petition was conceived. The line from this point to the CraneÂ¿s eye reflects that this is what Chief Buffalo saw. The lines from the hearts and eyes of the Catfish, Man-fish, Bear, and the three Martens to the heart and eye of the Crane, mean that all the headmen see and feel the same way. They all stand along a wide blue line that represents Lake Superior. The last line going out from the Crane's eye, indicates that the entire group has authorized Chief Buffalo (Crane Clan) to speak to President Fillmore and plead their case. Today it is thought that the Catfish represents Nadaugumbe (Lake Chetac in Sawyer County), the Man-fish represented Nenaangebi (Rice Lake, Barron County), and the Bear represents Ahkeywanzee (of Little Lac Courte Oreilles). The right-most Marten is thought to represent Shinogabe (of Fond du Lac, Minn.), the center Marten Wahbekasho (Big Bend of the Chippewa River), and the left-most Marten is thought to be Laubense (St. Croix River).

Severud, Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal Historical Preservation Office Archivist.",
