        "text": "We know that not only Catholics but Israelites in this country and in Europe are Prominent and bright Masons.. .. The beauty and pride of Masonry is its universal character, its tendency to fraternize mankind.. . .-Rabbi Isaac Wise, Scottish Rite Mason, The Israelite (1855) Heredom Marsha Keith Schuchard these came as second nature to Charles Edward. This helps to explain. .. the achievement involved in his \"invisibility\" during the obscure years from 1749 to 1758.1\n\nThis paper examines the Grand Lodge of All England held at York, otherwise referred to as the York Grand Lodge, which was an independent body of Freemasons that existed during the eighteenth century. The paper explores the origins of this Grand Lodge and how it came into conflict with the dynamic of the Premier Grand Lodge of London. The leading figure of York Masonry Dr Francis Drake will be discussed, and how this concept of independent Masonry survived up until the closing years of the eighteenth century, leaving behind remnants of a Masonic culture that still inspires Masonic researchers to this day.\n\nRevision of paper presented at Symposium on \"Western Esotericism and Jewish Mysticism,\" 18th International Association for History of Religions (Durban, South Africa, August 2000). Examination of ancient tradition that identified Scottish operative stonemasons and Scottish Freemasons as Jews. Two overlooked keys to this tradition lie in the history of Jewish architectural technology and the medieval myths of Scottish nationalism. The preservation of Cabalistic themes within architectural theories and Scottish poetry influenced the 18th-century \"higher,\" Ecossais Masonic degrees."
