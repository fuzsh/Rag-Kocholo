        "text": "CONCLUSION\n\nThe rule of Tiberius possesses many features which warrant its description as an aftermath of the principate of Augustus rather than a prelude to the principates which follow. Thus, in our present study, we have found in a number of fields that changes often attributed to Tiberius prove, on examination, to be features of the preceding principate (often of its final period), which Tiberius maintained as he found them.1 The whole subjects of his colonial coinages2 and attitude to Roman cities3 seem to fall into this category; indeed, in respect of his own titulature (in which he was eager to avoid comparisons),4 and in the honouring of his heirs,5 he was more conservative than Augustus and may even perhaps be said to have introduced a Republican reaction.6\n\nMoreover, in many respects the contrast with the future is no less clear than the link with the past; and Tiberius has been regarded not only as the second, but also as the last, of the true principes.7 For immediately after him came the first of the imperial tyrants, Caligula, in whose brief reign—though the force of continuity and tradition must not be minimised8—the Augustan system received a severe, and at some points a fatal, shock; as was fitting under the first of three emperors descended from M. Antonius.9 In particular Caligula had little patience for the tactful exercise of government by auctoritas.10 This régime died with Tiberius.11 His was the last principate in which other auctoritates survived alongside the auctoritas principis,12 and other principes viri alongside the princeps;13 in which, indeed, the latter liked to seem ut senator et iudex, non ut princeps.14 The significance of the year of his death, a.d. 37, may have been partly clear to those who came after him; at any rate, until the period of detraction set in,15 and his critics began to be read in earnest soon after the fall of his admirer Domitian,16 his memory received from posterity the marked respect17 which it deserved, and which is said to have been his highest ambition.18 Thus the tricennium of his death was commemorated by Nero on an official Alexandrian issue,19 and possibly, too, its half-centenary by a Roman as of Domitian.20 The death of Tiberius represented the end of an epoch, and it was fitting that a great landmark of the Augustan aureum saeculum, namely its half-centenary, was still receiving numismatic commemoration when he died.21\n\nYet, for all these deliberate and far-reaching links with Augustus as with the Republic which had preceded him, it is the feature of the principate of Tiberius that, in another and no less potent sense, it prepared the way for a future which he would have found most distasteful. The very fact of his accession pointed ahead rather than backwards: for it was the first occasion on which a man had succeeded to the statio principis, and this was so decisive an event that it has been described by Syme as \"marking the legal termination of the Republic.\"22 Thus, if in one sense a.d. 37 marked the end of an era, it is equally true to say that, despite the wishes of the new princeps, a.d. 14 marked the beginning of one.23 It is not, therefore, fortuitous or surprising that this great year was one of the dates of which the anniversaries were celebrated longest and most attentively in ancient times.24 To judge by the coinage, other such dates were b.c. 43, 31-30, 27, 23, 17-16 and 12.25 Each of these years was commemorated as having in some degree witnessed the inauguration of the principate; but the same is true in a very special sense of a.d. 14.26\n\nIndeed, this year was remarkable for more than the accession of Tiberius. For in it also, from causes beyond his control, there came into being two other great features of subsequent Roman history. For the first time a princeps, in the new sense, was deified;27 and for the first time, by his testament, a woman was raised high above other women.28 Thus, a dead man still dominated the State; while his widow and priestess hampered it and, despite the official concentration on her religious aspect, set the precedent for a monstrous regiment of women. DEO AVGVSTO and GENETRIX ORBIS, on the coinage of Spanish colonies,29 show respectively the repercussions, ominous for the future, of the embarrassing greatness of Tiberius' predecessor and his no less embarrassing will. By these factors, at the very outset of the reign and through no fault of his own, two serious limitations were set to the auctoritas of the new princeps. Moreover, he himself, for all his outstanding experience and ability,30 was ill-equipped by nature to govern by auctoritas as had Augustus before him. For that system depended greatly on personal relations, and it was in the personal touch31—and so in judgment of men32—that Tiberius was lacking. Indeed, his retirement to Capri, ascribed by Suetonius to a desire to cherish his auctoritas,33 made its tactful exercise impossible.34 So Tiberius himself, cramped by his character as well as by his inheritance, contributed to the failure of the system which it was his greatest desire to maintain.\n\nThe alternative to government by advice was the formal autocracy which was so soon to come into existence. Of this Tiberius was scrupulous to avoid any of the symbolism. But none the less, from the periphery of the empire, many signs of the future were apparent. The greatest of all the achievements of Tiberius, the stabilisation of the imperial Peace, brought on to a colonial mintage a Pax Aug. Perpetua which has in it—like GENETRIX ORBIS and DEO AVGVSTO—little of the past and much of the future; it is strangely suggestive of the contemporary Mission of Christ.35 To the future too point the Tiberian coin-legends of other colonies, like PIETAS AVGVSTA, AETERNITATIS AVGVSTAE and PROVI-DENTIAE AVGVSTI;36 and GENT· IVLI· at Corinth reminds us that the Gens Iulia, a modest enough conception in itself, advanced in this principate towards the status of an imperial family already unofficially called the divina domus.37 The conservatism of Tiberius kept such phrases away from public parlance, but for a time only; they were advancing apace outside Rome . It is to his involuntary coincidence with such pregnant developments, no less than to his conscious and constructive stabilisation of the Pax Augusta , that his principate owes its place—which has begun to be attributed to it in recent years—as a decisive stage in the history of the Roman Empire.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nCf.

Many of the aes pieces with heads of Augustus and Agrippa, and reverses with COL· NEM· and crocodile, are apparently post-Augustan.2 One such group, described on iconographical grounds as belonging to \"Tiberius or probably later,\"3 seems likely to be Claudian. In any case it is doubtful whether the issues of Nemausus are official or colonial,4 and also whether the Augustan colony at Nemausus was a Roman or a Latin one5—probably it was the former (14 b.c.).\n\n(2) Paestum. Muensterberg ascribes to Tiberius the coinage of the Paestan duoviri L. Suei. & M. Nun., and M. I. Ne.;6 but attribution to Augustus seems preferable.7\n\n(3) Uncertain Spanish city. Nicodemi 8 attributes to Tiberius a coin signed by C. Aquinus Mela and P. Baebius Pollio duoviri quinquennales, but the present writer ascribes it to Augustus. However the attribution to Pella must be abandoned owing to Spanish provenance: but A. Beltrán's reversion to Carthago Nova is still not convincing.9\n\n(4) Buthrotum. Sestini's10 attribution to this principate is uncertain. Imhoof-Blumer's 11 and Muensterberg's 12 ascription to Buthrotum concerns a genuinely Tiberian coin, but it is here assigned rather to Cnossus(?) (no. 49; Plate V, 10 and 11).\n\n(5) Patrae. A frequently published coin or medallion at Patrae with a veiled head of Livia(?) and biga, with the legend INDVLGENTIAE AVG· MONETA IMPETRATA,13 is probably not Tiberian.14 It is certainly not of Augustus,15 but its reverse type seems to be taken from dupondii of Germanicus issued in the principate of Caligula.16\n\n(6) Corinth. Edwards 17 rightly attributes to Caligula the duoviri A. Vatronius Labeo and L. Rutilius Plancus, ascribed earlier to Tiberius 18 or Augustus.19 She also abandons the attribution to Tiberius of the Augustans Insteius and L. Cassius.20 But certain other coins of Corinth lacking imperial heads21 may conceivably belong to the principate of Tiberius. So also might a small piece with GER· and DRV·, and two heads,22 though it may also be post-Tiberian and might in any case be official rather than colonial.\n\n(7) Parium. Mionnet quotes as bearing the ethnic of colonia Parium (C·G·I·P·) two small pieces with the usual type of priest or colonist ploughing; one has the head and name of Drusus junior,23 and the other those of Tiberius and Drusus junior 24 (Plate VIII, 10). But it is doubtful whether Mionnet was right in saying that the ethnic occurs on these coins.25 They appear to be of an anniversary character.26\n\n(8) Berytus. The present writer has yet to see a Berytan issue which does not seem more probably attributable either to a later date (e.g. Plate VIII, 5)27 or to an earlier one.28 But the stylistic peculiarities of this series make it impossible to conclude with certainty at what period any of these pieces were struck. Tiberian pieces may well exist.\n\n(9) Cnossus. As Muensterberg 29 suggests, some of the coins of Cnossus ascribed to the principate of Augustus by the present writer30 may conceivably have been issued under Tiberius, to whom some of them are ascribed in the British Museum Cabinet. This applies particularly to a diverse but obscure group bearing the following names:\n\n(i) M. Aemilius (Plate VIII, 4, only partially legible) described on one occasion as praefectus Imperatoris IIvir;31 elsewhere he lacks a title (Plate VIII, 2).\n\n(ii) Labeo, who now seems not to be identical with M. Aemilius as was thought;32 he figures as IIvir,33 possibly as [IIvir?]iter. (Plate VIII, 3)34 and apparently as IIvir quinquennalis iter. (Plate VIII, 1).35\n\n(iii) Pollio, who appears with Labeo as [IIvir?]iter. and IIvir quinquennalis iter. (Plate VIII, 1).36\n\n(iv) Ti. Caesar, who figures as IIvir (Plate VIII, 2)37 and IIvir tier.38\n\nThe present writer has preferred to consider the series Augustan and to identify Ti. Caesar here as Tiberius (in the reign of Augustus);39 it is, however, possible that this duovir is instead Ti. Gemellus (in the reign of Tiberius), as at Paestum.40 What is needed, as so often, is a carefully described Corpus of this coinage.\n\n(10) Antioch in Pisidia. Hill attributes to \"the time of Augustus and Tiberius\" a small piece with the ethnic C·C·AN·;41 but Ramsay ascribes the introduction of the name \"Antiochia\" to Vespasian or thereabouts.42 Hill43 and Babelon44 rightly reject a piece with CAE·ANTIO·COL·S·R·, on which the third century obverse has been tooled to show legend and portrait of Tiberius.\n\n(11) Perhaps Cassandrea (no. 32) should also have been included in this list rather than in the text (PLATE IV, 4).\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nA list of the pieces attributed to Tiberius is given in Chapter I, section i.\n\n2\n\nFITA, pp. 75 ff.; accepted by le Gentilhomme, RN, 1947, p. vii, and viewed with cautious favour by Mattingly, NC, 1946, p. 132, Sutherland, CR, 1947, p. 115; cf. de Laet, AC, 1946, p. 372.\n\n3\n\nFITA, p. 75, n. 11. One of these pieces is illustrated by Willers, NZ, 1902, Plate VII, 9.\n\n4\n\nFITA, pp. 70 ff., describes them as purely official, whereas Mattingly, NC, 1946, p. 131, doubts if this can be formally true, while admitting their de facto official scope. The present writer is now disposed to regard the first issue of c. 28 b.c. as local, the main Augustan and Neronian issues as official (P. P. on the latter is interpreted as Pecunia Publica in FITA, p. 78, n. 11, but this is doubted by Mattingly, op. cit., p. 132); and at least some of the scarcer intervening pieces of Claudius and particularly Caligula, perhaps also the last emissions of a.d. c. 68-69, as medallic or semi-medallic.

M(unicipi?) I(uliae) V(ticae).5 Though not a very common series, the coins of this city show several remarkable features, some of which have been referred to cursorily in the text.6 Most of them show the \"Livia as priestess\" type, and mention, in the Dative or Ablative, the name of the proconsul C. Vibius Marsus (a.d. c. 27-30).7 The names of seven duoviri appear singly,8 two of them being called AVG· or A·,9 signifying Augustalis 10 or [duovir] Augusti.11 Two further varieties are inscribed with the names of Ner. Caes. q(uinquennalis) pr(aefectus?) A·N· Gemellus, Dr. Caes. q(uinquennalis) pr(aefectus?) T·D· Rufus.12\n\nThe second city of this category coining outside Spain after the death of Augustus is Tingis; possibly it was linked with Baetica administratively.13 Carcopino wrongly describes it as a colony.14 Its coins show on either side the heads of Nero and Drusus, the sons of Germanicus, inscribed NERO IVL· TIN· and DRVSVS respectively.15 But it cannot be regarded as certain that this piece was not issued in the principate of Caligula,16 under whom honours to these princes were revived.\n\nAt first sight this paucity of municipal coinages seems to present a contrast to the reign of Augustus, in which about eight non-Spanish municipia coined;17 but the contrast diminishes when we limit the comparison to the last decade or two of the latter's lifetime.18 For in this more limited period not more than three such cities coined,19 and two of those apparently for foundations—that is to say, special occasions which could not be expected to recur under Tiberius. The apparent reduction in the latter's reign becomes even more negligible when it is recalled that Utica's extensive coinage seems to have had no precedent under Augustus,20 and that, in Spain , eight municipia appear to have issued coinage under Tiberius 21and only five in the last years of Augustus.22 It cannot, therefore, be concluded that any diminution of municipal mints started at the accession of Tiberius, any more than a diminution of colonial mints;23 nor is any diminution noticeable during his reign, in which a number of municipal issues are late.24\n\nFrom this point of view, then, no light is thrown on the problem of the relative status of municipia and colonies. The distinction between these two classes of community had been sufficient under Augustus for the municipia to preserve greater outward signs of independence which were sometimes reflected on the coinage; though this did not apply to all coinages. In any case the distinction had already come to be of little practical significance.25 Under Tiberius the numismatic signs of autonomy on the one hand and dependence on the other retain roughly similar proportions, and there are no signs of an increased tempo in the assimilation of the two classes of community.26 For Utica, in portraying Tiberius as princeps, is doing as other municipia had done under Augustus;27 Tingis represents the domus Augusta as Gades had before it.28 Again, municipia Osca, Saguntum and Turiaso begin under Tiberius to describe their fourth magistrates as aediles,29 like colonies; but even under Augustus other municipia had done the same.30 Municipium Dertosa seems to follow a further Augustan precedent by celebrating the jubilee of its foundation by coinage.31 It is true that municipium Bilbilis excels all colonies in its attention to imperial affairs by being the only Roman city, and indeed apparently the only city of any kind, to accord numismatic mention to the consulship of Sejanus.32 But, against this, municipium Emporiae in the same province retains complete \"autonomy\" of type which persisted until the cessation of its issues, which probably occurred in the reign of Caligula;33 and in any case a reference to Sejanus cos. is comparable to the Balbus pont. of Gades under Augustus.34\n\nOn the whole, then, it cannot be concluded that the coinage bears witness either to any diminution of municipal mints under Tiberius, or to any increased assimilation of colonies and municipia. This negative conclusion is in accordance with our literary locus classicus for this principate; for we learn from a speech of Hadrian, reported by Gellius,35 that the distinction between the two classes of community was still considered significant enough under Tiberius for Praeneste to petition for a return from colonial status to the theoretically more independent position of a municipium. Moreover, certain new municipia seem to have been created after his accession as before it, notably Cambodunum and conceivably Anagnia and Carnuntum.36\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nFor the present purpose this term is restricted to municipia civium Romanorum, i.e. does not include the Latin cities which were sometimes likewise described as municipia, cf.

M. Smith under the auspices of the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association. Such analyses as are quoted in the text of the present study, where no reference to From Imperium to Auctoritas is given, were undertaken by the same expert through the kindness of Messrs. Johnson, Matthey and Co., Ltd. The method used, somewhat different from that employed on the earlier occasion, is described as follows: \"A spark (0.005 uF capacity and 0.06 mH added self-inductance, a 2 mm. spark gap) was passed between a pointed rod of pure graphite and the edge of the coin supported in a specially constructed V-shaped holder with spring clip. A pre-spark period of 5 seconds was given and two exposures of 20 seconds on the same spot were photographed with a flat-field medium size quartz spectrograph, on Ilford Ordinary plates. ... In the absence of standard copper alloys of known composition, it is not possible to give the percentages of the alloys in question. The coins showing the highest content are grouped under 'A,' the next highest content 'Β,' and so on. Unfortunately these groups are not very sharply divided and in some cases it has been difficult to assign a coin definitely to one group. Moreover, the relative proportions as represented by the various groups cannot be stated, again on account of the lack of analysed samples.\" Lead and zinc constituents are classified A-C, and tin A-E, since \"tin can be detected in smaller quantities than zinc.\"\n\nIt should be noted that these classifications do not necessarily correspond with those in From Imperium to Auctoritas. The following notes on the new classifications need to be added:\n\n(1) Mr. D. M. Smith points out that all the coins analysed under the auspices of Messrs. Johnson and Matthey—a varied selection including official copper and orichalcum, and the bronze of peregrine cities, in addition to the colonial and municipal coins described here—\"probably contain lead present as an impurity,\"3 even where it is not present as an intended constituent. The spark spectra do not show it in every case, but he considers that the more sensitive arc method probably would. However, the spark method is for our purpose quite sensitive enough, indeed too sensitive, in identifying minute constituents; for, from the metrological standpoint, accidental constituents are of little interest.4\n\n(2) \"E tin,\" in the new classification, is estimated by Mr. D. M. Smith at less than 0.1%. Likewise \"C lead\" and \"C zinc\" are estimated at more than 0.01% but less than 1%: that is to say, for the present purpose they are negligible quantities. This means, however, that the possibility of \"B lead\" and \"B zinc\" also being occasionally accidental cannot be entirely ruled out. This last point raises a question in regard to the old (From Imperium to Auctoritas) classification which deserves to be mentioned here. Does \"C/D zinc,\" in that classification, justify interpretation as orichalcum? \"C zinc\" has been considered by the present writer to do so,5 and this is probably correct; but zinc is known to occur in many cases as an impurity.6 The spectrographic method has remarkable advantages—in respect of the saving of time, coins, labour and expense—which may well lead to its extensive use by numismatists; but there are individual cases of this kind in which chemical analyses, such as have recently yielded good results to Caley, should as far as possible be continued. Only a minute proportion of Roman aes coinage has so far received either chemical or spectrographic analysis.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nSee Chapter I, section ii, subsection A.\n\n2\n\nFITA, p. 493.\n\n3\n\nFor impurities see Caley, pp. 151 ff.\n\n4\n\nPerhaps, however, they might eventually be used to test provenance.\n\n5\n\nFITA, pp. 13, 493, n. 12.\n\n6\n\nE.g.

The results are recorded here in the hope that they will render some small assistance to the much more thorough operations of an eventual corpus.\n\nNo. in list Number of specimens weighed Average weight to nearest grain 4 3 64 5 1 50 6 3 77 8 1 62 11 4 125 12 4 71 13 1 143 15 25 106 16 1 63 18 2 333 19 2 199 20 2 107 21 1 317 22 2 239 23 2 121 24 2 462 25 1 315 26 3 106 29 3 678 30 4 228 31 2 125 32 1 87 33 1 118 34, 37-39 8 172 35 1 72 41 2 101 50 1 51 52 1 96 53 1 82\n\nThis evidence is not complete enough to warrant any confident metro-logical conclusions. Indeed, even if every extant specimen had been weighed, it would still be necessary to bear in mind the likelihood that many different standards existed simultaneously. However, the following conjectural arrangement of denominations is one of a number of possibilities:\n\nSestertii: Nos. 17, 24, 29.\n\nDupondii: Nos. 14 (?), 18, 25, 27, 30.\n\nAsses: Nos. 13, 19, 21 (?), 22, 34, 37-39, 49 (?).\n\nSemisses: Nos. 10, 11, 15, 20, 23, 26, 28, 31, 32 (?), 33, 41 (?), 42- 46, 48, 52, 53.\n\nQuadrantes: Nos. 1-9, 12, 16, 35, 36, 40, 47, 50, 51.\n\nThe coins of Paestum, which weigh the same under Tiberius as in the later years of Augustus, are believed to be quadrantes,2 and in the list given above a number of other pieces are ascribed to the same denomination; but such interpretations are more usually conjectural, since quadrantes often deviated in weight (usually in an upward direction) from one-quarter of the as on which they were based.3\n\nThe bulk of our pieces are here tentatively classified as semisses, a denomination not unknown under the early principate.4 One would have expected the unitary denomination to be the more frequent, and it might have been struck below weight; but, none the less, a low denomination for these small pieces is suggested by the considerable number of larger denominations issued, and particularly by the very large size of certain other coins—e.g. issues of Gades under Augustus (c. 630 gr.),5 and our no. 29 of Hippo Diarrhytus (c. 678 gr.).6 These bronze pieces7 are presumably sestertii, since a higher aes denomination than this is improbable:8 their high weight is not inconsistent with the 421 grains of the official sestertius of orichalcum.9 But if this is what they are, nos. 25, 27 and 30 are likely to be dupondii, nos. 26, 28 and 31 asses; compare nos. 22 and 23 respectively at Thapsus.10 If this is so, then the smaller pieces in this series cannot, if they belong to the same standard (of which, indeed, there is no proof), be asses also, but must be semisses.\n\nOn this assumption our bronze as ranges from c. 234 to c. 160 grains. Within this range, too, fall the abundant Tiberian bronze pieces of many Spanish cities, and also the bronze units (surely asses) of Nemausus during the whole Julio-Claudian period.11 The weight of the copper as at Rome is, appropriately,12 at the bottom of this range (168.5 grains).13\n\nAs stated in the text, however, no tightening of the standard under Tiberius can be deduced from the apparently smaller fluctuations of the colonial as in his reign than in the reign of Augustus. It is true that under Augustus such asses seem on occasion to have been as heavy as 350 and as light as 80 grains,14 but if we limit the comparison to the last sixteen years of his reign (the procedure that has been adopted for other such comparisons15), variations of this magnitude no longer occur. For in that period16 there are practically no colonial pieces over 300 grains and very few over 250; the Spanish coinage already varies within comparatively narrow limits; and such small pieces as are attributable to those years have as much claim to be considered semisses as have similar pieces under Tiberius.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nSee Chapter I, section ii, subsection A.\n\n2\n\nFITA, p. 288 and n. 2 (nos. 1-9 here).\n\n3\n\nCf. Mattingly, BMC. Imp., I, p. xlviii.\n\n4\n\nFITA, p. 125 (references).\n\n5\n\nFITA, p. 172 and n. 6.\n\n6\n\nBut weights here fluctuate so greatly, among the only three pieces weighed, that the average may not be reliable: they are 840, 628.8 and 564.8 grains (Müller). These pieces with the name of P. Cornelius Dolabella weigh considerably more than the corresponding ones with that of L. Apronius (no. 24), which average only c. 462 grains, rather more than Tiberian issues of Acci (c. 415), Tarraco (c. 400), Caesaraugusta (c. 440) and Turiaso (c. 390) : Hill, NNM, 50, 1931, Plates XV, 5, V, 8, XXXIII, 4, etc. But this disparity of weights between the two sets of pieces of apparently the same denomination may conceivably have something to do with the fact that the former overlapped, while the latter preceded, Tiberius' reform of the coinage in A.D. c. 22-23 (RAI, Chapter III, section i). For this reform included the issue of sestertii of orichalcum attaining for the first time the proper weight of 421 grains (no sestertii at all having been issued at Rome for many years), and this may have compelled local mints (which probably had an unfavourable rate of exchange with official issues, cf. Caley, p. 149) to keep their bronze issues heavier.\n\n7\n\nBut the Gades coins have not been analysed, so it cannot be proved that they are of bronze.\n\n8\n\nThere is no evidence of survival of the Republican tressis (FITA, pp. 31, 44, 88, 208).\n\n9\n\nFor the weight of the latter, Mattingly, BMC.

A very considerable proportion of the colonial and municipal issues of Augustus had belonged to this category of \"foundation\" or \"restoration\" coinages.2 In attempting to examine the practice of his successor in this respect, we are faced at the outset with an apparent contrast. Under Tiberius no municipium, and not more than one colony (if that), seems to maintain the custom of celebrating its foundation by coinage. This single colony to which a Tiberian issue of this category is tentatively attributed is Panormus: the present writer has elsewhere offered arguments, albeit admittedly conjectural ones, for attributing our issue no. 10 (Plate 1, 15) to a colonial foundation (or rather re-foundation in the Roman right, after a peregrine hiatus since there had been a long-extinct Julian constitutio as a municipium 3) in the early years of the principate of Tiberius.4 This attribution is chiefly based on the probability that all other names of proconsuls appearing on the coinage of Roman cities in Sicily are ascribable to a similar purpose.5 The other governors in question are Augustan, but a Tiberian date seems not improbable for the foundation of Panormus.6 If this is so, Silva or Silvanus,7 whose coin strikingly resembles a peregrine issue of that city,8 was (by the analogy of the Augustan governors9) perhaps the proconsul who undertook the adsignatio on behalf of the deductor Tiberius. Issues nos. 11 ff., lacking proconsular signatures, could conveniently (though conjecturally) be considered to belong, in whole or in part, to the category, described in From Imperium to Auctoritas, of second mintages from the foundation fund.10 These attributions are, however, it must be repeated, still guess-work. We cannot, for instance, exclude the possibility that another issue, mentioning L. Seius, might be the foundation issue of Panormus, rather than of Haluntium to which it has been ascribed.11\n\nThere is nothing surprising about the idea of a Tiberian colonial or municipal foundation; for recent research has suggested that a number of such foundations may have occurred. Most of the possible instances to which attention has been directed are in the Danubian provinces. Saria 12 and Chilver 13 plausibly ascribe Emona to this class. The present writer has attempted, in Roman Anniversary Issues, to attribute a coin of Gallienus to the quarter-millenary of a Tiberian deductio of Siscia.14 Scarabantia 15 and Narona 16 also may well have been colonised not long after the death of Augustus. The same could apply to Aquincum,17 and possibly to a site on Lake Balaton.18 Cambodunum looks like a Tiberian municipium.19 Perhaps, like other early imperial municipia, it contained a draft of settlers.20 The same may conceivably be true of Carnuntum.21\n\nNor are such possibilities (for they cannot be called more) limited to the Danubian area. In Sicily at least one municipium, namely Haluntium, may have been founded in the immediately preceding period, that is to say in the last years of Augustus.22 A late Augustan \"foundation\" at Haluntium (if there was one) would add plausibility to the suggestion that, under Tiberius, Sicily was still considered a suitable area for city-foundations such as that of Panormus. This would be consistent with the building activity which is known to have occurred in this province under Tiberius.23 Immigration into Africa may also conceivably have caused deductiones,24 and other areas possibly witnessed similar developments.25 As regards Italy , the evidence, if not necessarily more accurate, is at least more positive: we hear of a new deductio at Tifernum,26 and Anagnia is said to have been \"refounded\" by \"Drusus Caesar,\"27 presumably Drusus junior.28\n\nWe cannot, then, confidently accept statements that no colonisation occurred under Tiberius.29 It seems probable that he founded certain colonies in the Western provinces. When Augustus bequeathed to Tiberius a warning to be cautious in his grants of citizenship,30 he would not expect such foundations to be dispensed with altogether. Indeed Augustus himself, while almost totally abstaining from new Eastern foundations, had established or re-established many more Western colonies and municipia than has generally been believed.31 The list of Roman foundations which have here been quoted as possibly ascribable to Tiberius is likewise exclusively Western.32\n\nBesides the Augustan precedents, there are other historical grounds for not rejecting out of hand this view of Tiberian foundations. The conciliatory discharges of troops which, we know, followed the mutinies of A.D. 1433 may well have been accompanied by land allotments, as in the comparable stress of the early Augustan period, rather than by the gratuities which, since 13 b.c., had cost Augustus so much.34 One of our possible Tiberian colonies, Anagnia, seems to have been founded, as has been said, by Drusus junior, and the settlers were possibly men who had been ex-soldiers under him in Illyricum.35 Moreover, a number of the colonies here ascribed tentatively to Tiberius are situated in the very Illyrian lands in which the most serious mutiny had taken place. It was only later that in the interests of economy, Tiberius could venture to be more grudging in the award of civitas to discharged veterans36—and, as an alternative procedure, to grant civitas in lieu of discharge.37\n\nThis obscure subject of Roman foundations by Tiberius reminds us that his enactments on a variety of subjects may have been more numerous and important than our surviving information reports.38 Comparable to deductiones and constitutiones of Roman cities, on a smaller scale, were promotions of communities to Latinitas, and these too may well have continued in the principate of Tiberius.39 This may have been the cause of unprecedented and isolated Tiberian coinages at three Latin cities of Nearer Spain , namely Graccurris, Osicerda and Cascantum.40 Similar isolated issues, both in Spain and elsewhere, have very often proved to commemorate city-promotions and foundations;41 and, indeed, this character has been specifically ascribed to Augustan mintages of Segobriga, Ercavica, Segovia and other Latin cities.42 Finally, outside Roman or Latin foundations, Tiberius, doubtless without exceeding the bounds prescribed by Augustus, also awarded citizenship to a fair number of individuals.43\n\nPerhaps then the policy of Tiberius regarding enfranchisement, if not spectacular in comparison with Caesar, was not altogether negative.44 At first sight, it is true, his foundations and foundation-coinages seem few in comparison with those of Augustus; but if, as is more appropriate,45 we compare his practice with Augustus' last period (2 b.c.-a.d. 14), the apparent contrast vanishes. The last decade or so of the lifetime of Augustus may perhaps have witnessed the constitutio of municipia Agrigentum and Haluntium;46 but a policy of economic retrenchment was being followed, and the ascription to that period of colonies—at least in appreciable numbers—is unlikely. Thus in those years, as under Tiberius, the foundation-coinages that were so common in the first decade after Actium do not recur;47 and there is no reason to suppose that the tempo of foundations was any livelier than it became under Tiberius. But even if we consider, not the sparsity of the late Augustan period only, but the abundance of foundation issues in the early post-Actian years, deductions can only be drawn with great caution. For there is another contrast besides the merely numerical one which would explain, in part at least, the disparity of foundation-coinage. This other contrast is a geographical one: for Spain , the area where Augustan foundation-coinage was most abundant, had no doubt been colonised to capacity, and is not the area in which traces of Tiberian colonisation and municipalisation are prominent. The latter regions are rather those where action was necessitated by one of the great revolts of a.d. 14—namely Illyricum and Pannonia. But unlike Spain , these are areas in which no colonial or municipal coinage of Tiberius, whether celebrating foundations or otherwise, is to be expected. For no such coinage occurs in this part of the world in any other principate either.48 These were provinces where the official aes circulated, and had already circulated,49 too freely for local currencies to be considered necessary;50 and the general ban on the latter evidently comprised foundation-issues.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nSee Chapter I, section ii, subsection B.\n\n2\n\nFITA, pp. 290 ff. sum up.\n\n3\n\nFITA, p. 190.\n\n4\n\nFITA, pp. 197 f., n. 6.\n\n5\n\nFITA, pp. 196 ff., 237 f.

This category comprises mintages signalising the twenty-fifth, fiftieth, hundredth and other anniversaries of the deductio, constitutio or restitutio of the minting city.2 Unlike foundation coinages,3 this custom of jubilee issues shows no sign of waning before the death of Augustus, for the relevant issues of all of these cities except two4 fall within the last decennium of his principate.\n\nAn examination of the issues of Tiberius seems to warrant the suggestion that, as under Augustus, certain cities issued coinage to celebrate anniversaries of their deductio, constitutio or restitutio In considering the coinage of Augustus it was found that isolated colonial issues—that is to say those which followed and were followed by long numismatic silences at the cities in question—were often of this jubilee character. Just such an isolated piece is our no. 52 of Pisidian Antioch (Plate V, 15). Its portrait is of Tiberius' middle period (a.d. 22).5 The only known preceding issues of this mint had portraits imitated from official coinage of c. 19-17 b.c., 6 and no subsequent mintage seems to occur until a.d. 76, under Vespasian. The issue of Vespasian has been ascribed in Roman Anniversary Issues7 to the centenary—which fell in that very year—of whatever change occurred in the status of Pisidian Antioch when the kingdom of Amyntas passed into Roman hands in 25 b.c. The significantly isolated issue of Tiberius may celebrate either the half-centenary of the same occasion, which occurred in a.d. 26, or alternatively the half-centenary of Galatia's provincialisation in c. 20-19 b.c., which was perhaps contemporary with the deductio of the colony at Antioch in Pisidia.\n\nComparable, and a more straightforward example of a likely half-centenary coinage, is an issue under Tiberius of the Spanish municipium of Dertosa (Plate VI, 5).8 This, too, has a portrait of the middle period. It is even more completely isolated in date than the mintage of Pisidian Antioch. For Dertosa does not seem to have coined previously since the single occasion of its constitutio, which has been attributed in From Imperium to Auctoritas to c. 30-28 b.c.;9 and after the single Tiberian issue no further coins of this mint are known.\n\nA variant of the same custom of jubilee coinage seems to be provided by colonia Parium. Here a coinage showing Drusus junior, tentatively interpreted as official10 (Plate VIII, 10), must have been issued just about half-a-century after 30-29 b.c., the date to which a restitutio of this city has been ascribed.11 A restitutio of Pella by Octavian is attributable to the same year,12 and its fiftieth anniversary (a.d. 20-21) would be a suitable date for the early portrait of our no. 34 (PLATE IV, 6-7).\n\nHippo Diarrhytus and Thapsus, however, which seem to have begun their coinage in honour of proconsuls at about the same date13 (Plate II, 7, Plate III, 6, etc.), recall that the anniversaries commemorated by such coinages need not be purely local or even—as perhaps in the case of Pisidian Antioch—provincial in significance. The anniversaries thus celebrated may instead, or as well, possess an imperial character. For the mintages of these two African cities, with their honours—simultaneously paralleled in Asia—to the proconsuls who were also amici principis, coincided, not perhaps with colonial half-centenaries,14 but particularly with the half-centenaries of great occasions which prompted much official anniversary coinage, namely Actium and Aegyptus capta.\n\nThere was nothing new about this Tiberian celebration of imperial anniversaries by Roman cities. The same practice had occurred under Augustus. Moreover he too apparently, on precisely these occasions, had allowed similar numismatic honours to his amici, for he seems to have selected for this purpose an official anniversary, namely the vicennium of the republica restituta (7 b.c.). 15 Indeed, in this whole question of jubilee coinages, as in regard to foundation-issues, our limited evidence suggests that Tiberius did not deviate from the practice of Augustus.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nSee Chapter I, section ii, subsection B.\n\n2\n\nFITA, p. 295 (summary): Dyrrhachium, Cnossus, Patrae(?), Uselis (as municipium), Cirta(??), Carthage(?), Lugdunum(f), Lystra.

(a) At first sight this would seem to be an Accusative, and the same interpretation has been given to CORINTHVM under Augustus.1 But the significance of an Accusative ethnic would be obscure, and the full legend THAPSVM (presumably Subject) IVN·AVG· (presumably Object or recipient2) increases our doubts. The terminations of city-names sometimes vary, especially in Africa .3\n\n(b) This is repeated from Augustan issues.4 At Carthago Nova under Tiberius we find an Ablative Singular following IN,5 which seems rather derogatory to the authority of the city.6 ACHVLLA (no. 14) and similar unvarnished ethnics are usually treated as Nominatives but may in some cases have been intended as Ablatives.\n\n(c) The only known precedents are at Greek cities,7 among which Antioch , as here, associates the Nominative Plural with a dedicatory Dative.8 At Utica under Tiberius we apparently have M(unicipes) M(unicipi) I·V· (Plate VIII, 9).9\n\n(d) A Hellenism: the city had, only a few years earlier while still peregrine, been inscribing its coinage with the Greek Genitive Plural, the normal Ethnic Case in that language. The legend HISPAN-ORVM had been placed by Sex. Pompeius on coinage issued apparently at this very city, and also perhaps at Syracuse.10\n\nFinally, Thapsus 11 and Paestum,12 like other cities under Augustus,13 show varying arrangements of initials comprising ethnic titles.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nFITA, pp. 225, 266.\n\n2\n\nFor its interpretation see Chapter III, section iv, subsection A.\n\n3\n\nE.g.

A.D. 21\n\nMattingly seems to be wrong in suggesting that the revolts of Sacrovir and Tacfarinas led Tiberius to diminish the Western coinage of Roman cities.1 But the same writer links this to a second theory which, because of this link, needs to be mentioned here. According to this theory the revolt of Sacrovir was likewise followed by \"the suppression of the 'Altar' coinage of the 'Council of the Gauls' at Lugdunum.2... There was some justification for mistrust of anything that fostered separatist tendencies in those provinces (sc. Gaul and Africa ). The special Gallic issues, the 'Altar' coins of Lugdunum, were suspended.\"3\n\nBut this view seems to the present writer indefensible, since:\n\n(i) There is no internal reason whatever for fixing c. a.d. 21 as the terminus ante quem for such few \"Altar\" sestertii, dupondii and asses as may have been issued by Tiberius after a.d. 14. If any such coins were issued at all, they are so rare that it is more natural to postulate a single issue, which might equally have been much earlier than a.d. 21. Indeed, the postulation of that date is doubly hazardous since, as Mattingly himself does not deny, it is actually uncertain whether any such pieces exist or ever existed;4 but, even if they turn up, the objection remains valid.\n\n(ii) This being so, the whole onus of Mattingly's theory falls on a Tiberian coinage that does not exceed the most insignificant dimensions. Indeed, though one must not rule out the possibility that some of the coins mentioned in (i) may exist, at present the only piece that remains firmly attributable to the principate of Tiberius is a mere quadrans or semis.5 This issue is undateable: there is no internal reason whatever for attributing it to a.d. 21 rather than e.g. a.d. 15, or any date between the two (or even after a.d. 21); moreover, it is not nearly large enough to be regarded as occupying the seven years a.d. 14-21, i.e. as representing a continuation, until the latter date, of the extensive late Augustan coinage.\n\n(iii) The external arguments also are weak. The \"Altar\" pieces have no \"separatist\" qualities: they were official Roman coinage.6\n\n(iv) Likewise, the Altar itself, far from being a focus for disloyalty, was chiefly devoted (naturally in Gallic forms) to the worship of the ruler: it was the very opposite of \"separatist,\" for it was the deliberately chosen medium through which Gallic religious feeling was linked with emperor-worship.7\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nSee above, Chapter I, section ii, subsection D.\n\n2\n\nBMC.

First, there are a number of exceedingly rare peregrine coinages showing the heads of non-imperial Romans:\n\n(1) Aegina: ΣAB[EINOΣ Α1ΓIN]HΤΩN bare-headed portrait to right of C. Poppaeus Sabinus amicus principum—\n\nAIAKOΣ dead man standing before seated figure of Aeacus: countermark of star.2\n\n(2) Apollonia-Mordiaeum: TIBEPIOΣ ΣEBAΣTOΣ laureate head of Tiberius to right—\n\nAПΟΛΛΩNIΑΤΩN KOPNOYTOΣ EΥEPΓEΤHΣ portrait of Cornutus, perhaps C. Julius Patrinus Cornutus, to right.3\n\n(3) Priene (perhaps of Augustus) [ΠΟΜΠHI]OΣ MAKEP portrait to right of Pompeius Macer, librarian of Augustus or friend of Tiberius— ΠPIHNEΩN Zeus standing to left by tripod-altar.4\n\n(This custom by which peregrine cities honour Romans with coin-portraiture [for the procedure is purely honorary] does not end with Tiberius, for under Claudius [who spoke of his legati as comites,5 thereby following a Republican tradition6] we find portraits of M. Annius Afrinus [legatus Augusti propraetore of Galatia] on local coinage at Iconium and Pessinus;7 and of Veranius,8 Marcellus9 and Antius10 [legati of Lycia-Pamphylia] at Cibyra.)\n\nSecondly, the following mentions of non-imperial Romans—without portrayal—occur on Tiberian peregrine coinages (in the Genitive after EΠI, cf. above, p. 52, n. 92):\n\n(i) Nicomedia:11 P. Vitellius, proconsul and comes of Germanicus 12 (with the latter's head).\n\n(ii) Seleucia in Pieria:13 Q. Caecilius Metellus Creticus Silanus, legatus and proposed relative by marriage of the imperial family.14\n\n(iii) Antioch in Syria : ditto,15 and L.

(?), with the heads of Germanicus and Drusus junior (or Nero Drusus—in which case a Claudian date is perhaps more probable).20\n\n(vii)-(xi) (silver coinage) Cydonia,21 Eleuthernae,22 Gortyna,23 Hierapytna24 and Polyrhenium.25 Cornelius Lupus,26 amicus Claudii.27\n\nThe aes coins of Galatian mintage mentioning T.

He is legatus propraetore.\n\nAPPENDIX 10\n\nThe eastern command of Germanicus\n\nThe whole question of \"vicegerents\"1 must be borne in mind when considering the constitutional situation of other sorts of governors such as the proconsuls. Thus, as an Appendix to our discussion of Tiberian proconsuls in Africa ,2 a brief statement is added here—and such a statement seems somewhat overdue—regarding the position, especially in the East, of the only Tiberian \"vicegerent\" in that area, Germanicus.\n\nTacitus describes the position of Germanicus in the East as comprising mains imperium, QVOQVO ADISSET, quam iis qui sorte aut missu principis obtinerent.3 This raises two main subjects—his relation to other proconsuls, and his relation to Tiberius. As regards the former of these subjects, we have two main possibilities: (1) that he possessed a \"passive\" (Type A) imperium maius, such as Cicero had hoped to secure for C. Cassius 4 before the latter obtained his more comprehensive and \"active\" (Type B) command.5 (2) that he possessed no imperium maius vis-à-vis existing proconsuls, but only superior auctoritas—the latter being interpreted as the former by later anachronisms (such as the present writer has attributed to Dio's description of Agrippa's vicegerency6); in which case any areas which needed to come under his imperium can have been temporarily detached from their usual senatorial province and brought into his provincia.7\n\nIf we consider the second aspect of the problem, his relation to Tiberius, we have three possibilities: (A) he was a proconsul under the imperium maius of Tiberius; (B) he was a proconsul whose imperium was aequum to that of Tiberius (the position ascribed to Agrippa under Augustus by Piganiol 8 and Magdelain9); (C) he was legatus Augusti propraetore, the position attributed to Augustan vicegerents by the present writer.10\n\nBut, in considering either the upward or the downward relations of his imperium, it is important to recall that for part of 18 he was consul (when a clash of imperia would hardly arise11); and that a special problem is raised by Egypt.12 Nor is the question of his auspices any clearer than those of Augustan vicegerents in the East.13 There is some excuse for doubts about the position of Germanicus when we recall that he himself was evidently at variance with Tiberius about his status in Egypt and with Piso about his powers in Syria. There are also ambiguities about his previous Western command, as regards imperium 14 and auspicatio.15\n\nIt is unsatisfactory to finish this note without even a tentative conclusion; but the questions involved are too intricate for further consideration in the present study. As has been said, they are chiefly relevant to it by reason of the possible comparisons and contrasts which the position of Germanicus may present to the position of the proconsuls; but the problems that have been outlined here each require fundamental consideration, and, if necessary, reconsideration, before any profit can be derived from these analogies.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nI.e. of commanders and governors in the provinces who enjoyed a special position owing their membership of the imperial family.\n\n2\n\nSee above, Chapter II, section ii.\n\n3\n\nAnn., II, 43, 2.\n\n4\n\nCic., Phil., II, 30, cf.

Livy (Budé), I, p. xxi, n. 2, believes that Agrippa had possessed the auspices—unlike ordinary legati, Pease, Oxford Classical Dictionary, p. 126. See also above, pp. 61 f.\n\nAPPENDIX 11\n\nThe Augustan origins of the auspices of Tiberius\n\nIt was under Augustus that the doctrine of imperial auspicia took shape;1 and it seems possible that events of 20-19 b.c. and 12 b.c. may have been related to its origins. The case of M. Antonius(?) Primus, a proconsul of Macedonia,2 who invaded Thrace in 24 or 23 b.c. 3 but then tried unsuccessfully to put the responsibility on the princeps, may conceivably suggest that an ambiguous position in regard to the auspices still existed at that time.4 But in 20-19 b.c. no less than three developments occurred which may have clarified this situation. In the first place, it was in 20 that the first ornamenta triumphalia appear to have been awarded:5 the fact that this new honour was, and remained, restricted to the imperial provincia seems to stress the monopolisation of the auspices. Secondly, it was no more than a single year later that the last triumph was awarded to a senatorial proconsul (L. Cornelius Balbus)6—the end of this custom may be associated with the recognition that such officials henceforward lacked the auspices. Thirdly, the same year witnessed the refusal of a triumph by Augustus, a refusal which was, however, far outweighed in historical importance by the simultaneous establishment in his honour of nothing less than a kind of triumphal cult7—indicating his position as the triumphator par excellence—a development highly relevant to the doctrine of the supreme auspicia. There is, it is true, no definite proof that this doctrine owed any part of its evolution to the events of 20-19 b.c., but this seems a not improbable deduction from their character.\n\nIn 12 b.c. Augustus became pontifex maximus , and his possession of that title was thereafter greatly stressed.8 Tiberius stressed it also: thus one of our coins honouring the proconsul L. Apronius (Pl. II, 7, 8) distinguishes his portrait from that of Tiberius by the addition to the latter of lituus and simpulum (simpuvium). Combined in this way in relation to a single person,9 the two implements symbolise the high-priesthood,10 just as they had already under Augustus.11 It has been suggested above that the auspicia principis, at least in so far as they related to Africa , were based primarily on the \"Augustus\"–auctoritas range of ideas. Whether or not high-priests possessed the auspices,12 its tenure by Augustus formally increased his religious authority and so perhaps further facilitated the enhancement of the imperial auspicia.\n\nThe possibility of this connection is underlined by the significance of one of the emblems of the high-priesthood that appear on these coins. This is the lituus.13 Developing a precedent utilised by Sulla,14 Pompey15 and Julius Caesar,16 Augustus had come to use the lituus as a symbol of his religious position with special regard to his triumphal Virtues.17 A lituus had appeared beside his bust on official coinage of 28 b.c., 18 the year after the augurium Salutis.19 It recurred in subsequent periods of the reign of Augustus;20 and colonies21 and peregrine communities22 followed suit. The lituus reminds us of his \"Romulus\" aspect,23 for Virgil24 and Ovid25 both link the lituus with Quirinus.26 Romulus was the originator of the auspices; and especially relevant to the present discussion is the obvious connection of this widely publicised emblem, through the college of augurs which it represented,27 with the name of Augustus, the concept of auctoritas, and (by the false etymology that has been indicated28) the auspicia principis. This again suggests that the high-priesthood, in regard to which the lituus was stressed, was considered as not unconnected with the imperial auspicia.29 This connection may in part account for the prominence of the simpulum and lituus on the colonial issue honouring Tiberius and L. Apronius (no. 20).30\n\nTwo conjectures, then, may be offered regarding the origin of the universal imperial auspices: first, that the doctrine came to be formulated in 20-19 b.c. in connection with the new triumphal cult, and secondly that its development was facilitated by Augustus' acceptance, in 12 b.c., of the high-priesthood.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nSee above, Chapter II, section ii, subsection B.\n\n2\n\nFor his position see Volkmann, Münchener Beiträge zur Papyrusforschung, 1935, p. 55.\n\n3\n\nFor the date see Syme, RR, p. 333 (Stuart Jones, CAH, X, p. 136, n. 6, gives 23 b.c.).\n\n4\n\nFor discussion see FITA, pp. 83 f.\n\n5\n\nTaylor, JRS, 1936, pp. 169 ff., considered probable by Abaecherli Boyce, CP, 1942, p. 140, cf. p. 135.\n\n6\n\nCf.

I, 7-10) show a close link with the coinage of 16 b.c., of which a large part explicitly refers to the new saeculum (p. 73). It may well be that this new Golden Age, which was understood to have been made possible only by the victories of the princeps, witnessed a decisive stage in the development of the idea of Victoria Augusti; just as the crowning 'victory\" (20 b.c.), which shortly preceded the new saeculum, perhaps inspired a \"Triumphal Cult\" and enhancement of the imperial auspicia.2\n\nEach decennium and quinquennium of the new régime of 27 b.c. was made the occasion for fresh propagandist manifestations3—17 b.c. (saeculum aureum), 12 b.c. ( pontifex maximus ), 7 b.c. (vicennium), and 2 b.c. ( pater patriae),4 are conspicuous examples. The assumption by Augustus of the high-priesthood in 12 b.c. may have had its effect on the imperial auspices;5 and a fresh stage in the evolution of the Victoria Augusti may conceivably have been reached at a date not far from the vicennium of the régime in 7 b.c. For it was at this time that the worship of the Genius Augusti was first fully installed in Italy :6 the Genius was very closely linked with the Victoria Augusti,7 and there was a triumph of Tiberius in the same year, apparently accompanied by the issue at Rome of an unparalleled series of aes medallions emphasizing the Victory of the princeps.8 The attribution to this date of a final enhancement of Victoria Augusti would give additional meaning to another numismatic phenomenon attributed to about the same year. For it is to c. 7 b.c. also that we have ascribed the development of the amicitia principis illustrated by the earliest groups of African, and perhaps, also, Asian, proconsuls honoured on local coinage of the principate—the prototype of a similar phenomenon under Tiberius.9 Was Augustus' enhancement of the cachet of amicitia intended, not only to close the ranks round the heirs to the principate, but also to serve as a consolation for the now evident monopoly of Victory (as of the auspices) in hands other than those of the proconsuls? But these are too clouded waters for further exploration here.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nRAI, Chapter III, section ii; cf. above, Chapter II, section iii.\n\n2\n\nSee Appendix 11.\n\n3\n\nRAI, Chapter II, section ii.\n\n4\n\nSee above, Chapter II, section i.\n\n5\n\nSee Appendix 11.\n\n6\n\nCf.
