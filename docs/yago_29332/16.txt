Wladyslaw III Spindleshanks (Polish: Wladyslaw III Laskonogi; b. 1161/67 - 3 November 1231), of the Piast Dynasty, was Duke of Greater Poland (during 1194-1202 over all the land and during 1202-1229 only over the southern part), High Duke of Poland and Duke of Kraków during 1202-1206 and 1228-1231, Duke of Kalisz during 1202-1206, ruler of Lubusz during 1206-1210 and 1218-1225, and ruler over Gniezno during 1216-1217.

He was the fifth son of Mieszko III the Old, Duke of Greater Poland and since 1173 High Duke of Poland, but the third-born from his second marriage with Eudoxia, daughter of Grand Prince Iziaslav II of Kiev.

The nickname "Spindleshanks" (Laskonogi) was given to Wladyslaw in the Chronicle of Greater Poland. Jan Dlugosz assumed that this was in reference to Wladyslaw's unusually long and thin legs
