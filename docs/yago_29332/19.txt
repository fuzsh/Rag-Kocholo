Abstract

Mieszko III the Old (1122/25–1202), Duke of Kujawy, Greater Poland and Cracow was one of the sons of Bolesław III the Wrymouth and Salomea of Berg. His fate was influenced by the fact that after his father’s death, the territory of Piast’s Poland was divided into provinces, and the prince himself was involved in a series of conflicts with his brothers, and later also with other representatives of the Piast dynasty. While his father was still alive (d. 1138), he married the Hungarian princess Elizabeth, and after her death (between 1150 and 1154) he married Eudoxia, daughter of the Grand Duke of Kiev, Isiaslav II. From both these marriages Mieszko had numerous children: five sons and at least five daughters. The aim of the paper is to present Mieszko III not so much as a politician, a ruler, but as the head of the family, also in a broader sense, as a nestor of the Piast family. What is important is that all of Mieszko’s children have happily survived their childhood, which is a peculiar phenomenon, taking into account the high mortality rate of children in the Middle Ages. Six of them died while their father was still alive. The paper will attempt, difficult due to the specificity of the preserved source material, to present the everyday life of the prince’s family, will present the meanders of dynastic politics, realized with the help of arranged marriages, and will finally touch upon the issues of material and court culture.
