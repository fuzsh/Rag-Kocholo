Son of Izyaslav Mstislavich, Velikiy Kniaz' (Grand Prince) of Kiev.\n\nAlong with his father, he participated in the wars against Yury Dolgoruky and the Chernigov princes. After an initial victory against the Cumans in 1153, Mstislav was defeated by the Cumans at the Psyol river. Yury Dolgoruky forced him to flee to Poland in 1155, but the next year Mstislav returned with a new army and defeated Dolgoruky at Volodymyr-Volynsky. Dolgoruky died in 1157, and Mstislav had himself crowned at Volodymyr-Volynsky.\n\nIn 1151 Mstislav married Agnes, the daughter of Duke Boleslaus III of Poland. They had three sons:\n\n1.Roman Mstislavich (c. 1152â1205)\n\n2.Sviatoslav Mstislavich, Prince of Brest\n\n3.Vsevolod Mstislavich of Volhynia, Prince of Belz, Prince of Volodymyr-Volynsky (died 1196)\n\nHis death is reported in 1172 in the book Heraldry of the Royal Families of Europe, Jiri Louda and Michael Maclagan. Clarkson N Potter, New York 1981 in Table 135\n\nNote on Wife: Agnieszka +\n\nAgnes was the penultimate child and youngest daughter of her parents. The date of birth is known thanks to Ortlieb, benedictine monk of Zwiefalten who visited the court of Dowager Duchess Salomea in Leczyca between 1140 and early 1141; in his reports, he mentioned that Agnes was three years old. As in 1138 Salomea gave birth the future Casimir II the Just, Agnes was born a year earlier.[1]\n\nShe was probably named after the wife of his half-brother Wladyslaw II, Agnes of Babenberg, even though it's unwillingness to Salomea of Berg.[2] It's also possible that she was named after his father's half-sister Agnes, Abbess of Gandersheim and Quedlinburg.[3]\n\nIn 1141 Salomea of Berg organized a meeting in Leczyca, where his eldest sons (Boleslaw IV and Mieszko III), and the lords had to decide, among other things, the future of Agnes.[4] They had two options: sent her to the Benedictine monastery in Zwiefalten (where her older sister Gertruda was already a nun) or married her with one of the ruling princes of that time. Eventually it was decided the alliance with Kievan Rus', and thus gain an ally against Wladyslaw II. According to the majority of historians, the chosen groom was Prince Mstislav Iziaslavich.[5] This hypothesis is supported by the fact that ten years later he married Agnes. The second view as a candidate for the hand of Agnes was one of the sons of the Grand Prince of Kiev, Vsevolod II Olgovich.[6] Soon after, he reject the proposal of the Junior Dukes and their mother and choose the alliance with Wladyslaw II, reinforced in 1142 when his eldest son Boleslaw married with Vsevolod II's daughter Zvenislava.\n\nWladyslaw II wasn't invited to the Leczyca meeting, despite the fact that, as the High Duke, he had the final voice on Agnes' engagement. In retaliation for this omission, in the winter of 1142-1143 he supported Kievan military actions against Salomea and her sons. The first clash between the brothers was a complete success by the High Duke.\n\n[edit] MarriageProbably between the end of 1149 and 1151,[7] Agnes married with Prince Mstislav Iziaslavich of Pereyaslavl[disambiguation needed], eldest son of Grand Prince Iziaslav II of Kiev. The Chronicler Wincenty Kadlubek, who knew the Piast-Rurikids affinities, explicitly described in his Chronica Poloniae that Agnes was given to Mstislav as wife. Further confirmation of this fact where: Mstislav's eldest son was called nephew of Casimir II the Just, and the relationship existing between Roman the Great and Leszek the White is described as cousins in the second degree. In addition, Roman is named jatrwia (wife's brother), of Leszek in the Hypatian Codex.[8] Therefore, is Mstislav had to marry with any of Boleslaw III's daughters, the only one who could marry was Agnes.[9]\n\nDuring her marriage, Agnes bore her husband three sons: Roman the Great, Vsevolod and Vladimir. Mstislav's firstborn son, Sviatoslav, is considered by the majority of historians an illegitimate child.[10]\n\nAfter Grand Prince Iziaslav II's death, Mstislav lost his Principality of Pereyaslavl (1155) and took refuge with his wife in Poland. However, the next year he was able to return and conquer Lutzk (during 1155-1157) and Volynia (during 1157-1170). In May 1168, after the death of Rostislav Mstislavich, Mstislav became in the Grand Prince of Kiev and Agnes in the Grand Princess consort.\n\nHowever, Mstislav II's reign was short-lived: in December 1169 a great coalition of Rurikid princes led by Prince Andrei I Bogolyubsky of Vladimir-Suzdal and his son Mstislav was created against him. Unable to defend Kiev, Mstislav II fled to Volynia, leaving his family at the mercy of his enemies. Two months later (February 1170), Mstislav II was able to recover Kiev thanks to the citizenship, who favored his rule; but in April of that year he was again expelled from Kiev, this time for good. The deposed Grand Prince retired to his domains in Volynia, where he died on 19 August 1170.[11]\n\n[edit] Death and AftermathsThe last mention of Agnes as a living person comes from the Chronica Poloniae of Wincenty Kadlubek. Sviatoslav, Prince of Brest, was exiled by his half-brothers as a result of the allegations that he was illegitimate. Then Casimir II the Just invaded Brest and restored him in his domains.[12] The Chronicle of the Chapter of KrakÃ³w informs about an expedition of Casimir II into Kievan Rus' in 1182.\n\nAgnes's later fate is unknown. It's also unknown where she died or where she was buried.\n\nFrom her three sons, only the eldest, Roman the Great and Vsevolod of Bielsk leave descendants. Vsevolod bloodline apparently ended with his four grandchildren, although it's seemed that one of them, Roman, was the direct ancestor of the Princely House of Drutskoy-Sokolinsky, who became extant in the 19th century.[13]\n\nRoman the Great, Agnes' eldest son, reunited almost all the paternal heritage and in 1203 he could conquer Kiev and became in the Grand Prince, but two years later he was killed in battle, leaving two minor sons. The eldest of this sons, Daniel, could conquer Kiev in 1239 and was named King of Galicia in 1253. Vasylko, Daniel's younger brother, succeeded him in Galicia in 1260 and his bloodline ended with his two children.\n\nDaniel's descendants maintain the rule over Galicia until 1349, when Poland absorved the Kingdom. Apparently his bloodline ended with his great-great-granddaughter Euphemia, wife of Liubartas of Lithuania.[14]1\n\nSources"
