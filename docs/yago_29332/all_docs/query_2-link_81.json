Ludovico established himself fully in the duchy to the resentment of his late nephew's widow.\n\nThe continuing struggle for Milan ended in a French victory however in 1512 Maximilian managed to ensure that Ludovico's son was restored to the Duchy and suggested a marriage with Bona Sforza his cousin settling the division in the family. However before the marriage could be formalized Maximilian Sforza was deposed by the French King who once again occupied Milan. In 1516 The Emperor decided to marry Bona to his only son by Bianca Sforza - Frederick of Austria - 18 months later Imperial Armies managed to force the French out of Italy once again and with Papal approval Frederick was installed as Duke of Milan alongside his Sforza wife.\n\nThe Milanese branch of the House of Hapsburg are tended to be described as the House of Austria-Milan or Hapsburg-Milan to distinguish them from the Imperial line descended from Maximilian's first marriage who ruled in the Low Countries, Austria, and Spain.\n\nDuke Frederick or Federigo in Italian and his wife were crafty operators and in the late 1520s made a series of spectacularly profitable alliances with the Medici Papacy - in the late 1520s with the control of the Pope by his nephew he arranged the marriage of his daughter Isabella to Alessandro Medici who his uncle would restore to power in Florence and create Duke of Florence in 1532. Meanwhile Francesco of Milan was betrothed to Catherine Medici Alessandro's legitimate and wealthy sister who was styled Duchess of Urbiuno and had inherited the Auvergne land and wealth in France from her mother. The Duke of Milan was able with papal support to enforce Catherine's claim on Urbino and then using the influence of his cousin Queen Eleanor of France arrange the marriage of his younger daughter to the Duke of Orleans in 1538 using his daughter in law's Auvergne lands to dower her.\n\nWith the assassination of Alessandro Duke of Florence - Milan once again used Papal influence to its advantage the Duke's widowed daughter was married to the Duke of Parma to appease the Pope. After the murder and the installation of Cosimo as Duke of Florence the Milanese Duke appealed to the Pope and his nephew the Emperor not to recognise Cosimo and instead allow his son and daughter in law to rule in Florence - Catherine was his argument went the sole legitimate representative of the senior Medici line and her half brother's lawful heir. War with France prevented the Emperor for supporting his uncle though and the Pope was unwilling to intervene but the claim was not forgotten.\n\nFrancesco II was greatly influenced by his mother and was dominated by his intelligent Medici wife. During the early part of his reign he was prevented from expansion by the wishes of his cousin the Emperor - the death of Charles V and accession of Ferdinand with whom Francesco had a good relationship was the key to helping Milan's expansion. In 1557 his heir was betrothed to AD Joanna - Ferdinand's youngest daughter. With strong support from Austria he also formally invaded Florence - By 1565 he had forced Cosimo into exile and to appease many named his wife Duchess of Florence though he would be dead before her rights received papal approval.\n\nHis son Lorenzo would eventually be formally created Grand Duke of Milan and Tuscany with both Papal and Imperial approval in 1581 however he would be murdered only a short while later.\n\nHis son Fernando I was heavily influenced by his grandmother who acted as regent until her death when the 16-year-old Grand Duke took control in his own right - in the 1590s he broke decades of tradition by allying with France aided by his attractive French wife. French support enabled him to expand his territories gaining full and final control of Siena and wresting Bergamo from Venice. However his subsequent fall out with the papacy saw him lose control of Urbino which was annexed back to the Papal states.\n\nHis son Lorenzo II would add Mantua and Montferrat to his holdings with the marriage to the last member of the House of Gonzago. Though this lead to war and a long conflict with the Duchy of Savoy which also claimed Montferrat. Lorenzo's reign would last over fifty years and would see further advances for the Grand Duchy ensuring its place as the greatest power in Northern Italy. In the 1660s he finally conquered the republic of Genoa which had been in terminal decline - but he was forced to cede Corsica to the French in the Treaty of Liguria.\n\nLorenzo II would be succeeded by his grandson as his son died before him. Carlo Fernando was dominated by his Austrian mother and despite two marriages failed to produce any issue. He would die amidst negotiations for his third marriage and was succeeded by his youngest brother Alessandro who had been known as the Duke of Bergamo.\n\nHis son would succeed him at just 12 year of age under the regency of his Spanish mother - later in his reign he would face the war for the Spanish succession with the extinction of the Hapsburg Spanish line - he himself had a strong claim through his mother to the Spanish Throne after his other cousins the Duke of Lorraine (who was supported by the French King) and the Austrian AD Leopold who had succeeded to the Duchy of Parma through his grandmother. The subsequent Treaty of Nice saw the Duke of Lorraine installed in Spain ending Hapsburg rule there - Milan would lose some of its Genoese territories to France and Savoy but would gain the Duchy of Parma to accept the installation of AD Leopold as King in Naples. Carlo was disappointed because he had hoped to be able to transform his Grand Duchy into a Kingdom (of Lombardy) but his desires were blocked by both his Austrian cousins and the French. His son would marry AD Leopold's eldest daughter.\n\nThe War of the Savoy succession - In 1780 the last Duke of Savoy who was also King of Sardinia died - although he had male relations his nearest relative was his cousin the Grand Duke of Milan - Carlo III immediately invaded Savoy and was acknowledged as Duke of Savoy in Turin in 1782. The great powers however were concerned at the further rise of Carlo's strength in northern Italy. France immediately marched into northern parts of the Duchy of Savoy and Carlo's cousin Leopold in Naples occupied Sardinia. The conflict lasted for some time until finally the Treaty of Avignon was signed - the Duchy of Savoy proper was ceded to France, Milan was permitted to retain Piedmont and Aosta. Reluctant to see Carlo styled King the powers insisted that Sardinia become an independent nation and installed the nearest male relation of the late Duke of Savoy as King.\n\nIn the 1790s Milan and Austria would carve up Venice and her territories between them. In 1794 Carlo proclaimed himself King of Lombardy - this spurious claim was something of a joke to many and was a compromise agreed with the Emperor who had refused to countenance Carlo's claim to the ancient Kingdom of Italy. Carlo retained his earlier regnal numbering as King of Lombardy - styling himself Carlo III.\n\nCarlo IV married a Spanish princess and was succeeded by his second surviving son Luigi I.\n\nLuigi would fan the flames of Italian nationalism throughout his reign - in the hope of finally uniting all of Italy - growing liberalism was proving a threat to the remaining independent Italian monarchs - time had reduced them to the Kingdom of Lombardy in the north. The surviving duchy of Ferrara the sole holdout to Hapsburg domination in the north. The papal states in central Italy and the united Kingdom of Naples in the south. To many nationalists though the absolutism of the Lombard Kings was anathema.\n\nIn 1828 revolution broke out in Milan and the King and his family were forced to flee the city taking refuge in Turin - the insurrection was suppressed but it was the first rumbling of revolution across Italy. Throughout the 1830s further insurrections took place and in 1836 - the Savoy King of Sardinia was forcibly deposed and exiled to France and the revolutionaries declared the Sardinian Republic.\n\nFearing the results of revolution the Crown Prince persuaded his father to grant the Lombard Constitution of 1844 - granting limited voting rights, free assembly and free press and the creation of a Chamber of elected deputies. The same year in an appeal to the nationalists the King announced his renunciation of the Royal Families Imperial titles.\n\nIn 1848 the Chamber declared that His Majesty the King of the Lombards was best placed to unite Italy into one sole Kingdom and urged His Majesty to declare war on those opposed to the ideal and dream of an independent and united Italy.\n\nThe War of Italian reunification would run from 1849 to 1854 and was fought in three stages firstly the swift conquest of Sardinia which was formally merged into the Kingdom of Lombardy with barely a shot fired was followed by the brief war with Austria - The Pope had refused to yield his temporal lands and appealed for Austrian help - however Austria was lukewarm on preventing unification and a small force was swiftly defeated and the Romagna was soon occupied by Lombard forces.\n\nThe remaining sticking point was the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily but revolution in 1854 saw the King deposed - an embarrassment for his daughter the Lombard Crown Princess. The nascent Naples republic initially refused to consider unification with Lombardy. However after a heavily corrupt plebiscite Naples and Sicily were merged on May 10 1857 into the Lombard Kingdom.\n\nOn May 11 on the steps of the Royal Palace in Milan the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed - Lombardy's chamber of Deputies became the National Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy and the first constitution of the Kingdom would be signed into law in 1856.\n\nThe exiled King of Naples and Sicily issued a decree defying the Italian Kingdom and asserting his rights - he refused to speak to his daughter Isabella again after her husband succeeded as King of Italy in 1859.\n\nMilan remained the capital until a final treaty was drawn up with the Papacy in 1868 establishing Vatican City as independent and sovereign and allowing the Italian capital and parliament to be moved to Rome.\n\nUnder the decree of Luigi I of Italy - the royal style was simplified to His or Her Royal Highness Prince or Princess of Italy for members of the family, his eldest son was to be Crown Prince of Italy.\n\nThough the family still bore the surname of Hapsburg much was made of them having been resident in Italy since the 16th Century and their line of descent from the greatest Italian dynasties.\n\nKing Giovanni oversaw Italy's transformation into a fully constitutional monarchy - He and his wife lived a relatively simple life preferring to use the Villa Lombard on the outskirts of Rome than the principal palace in Rome. The King had a long standing relationship with the French-born dancer and actress Elena Vergine and after the Queen's death he married her. She was not granted the style of Queen and did not attend formal public events - though she acted as hostess at private occasions. She was created Duchess of Novaro on her marriage and bore the King one daughter Caterina who later became the 2nd Duchess of Novaro and a prominent society hostess.\n\nI am so tempted to do a 'If Elizabeth I married Robert Dudley' one, but it needs more thought yet. Keep your eyes peeled...\n\nWell, I'm not saying it's any good - family trees aren't my specialty and finding suitable matches for OTL Victorian era, Protestant heirs who aren't German and therefore won't necessarily marry their cousins is hard! I just tried to go for matches between royalty of a similar age, so if any don't make sense, just accept that they're ATL versions of their OTL Counterparts!

for their match in 1551. With a Tudor daughter-in-law, Northumberland never backs Jane Grey, but instead throws his efforts into persuading Edward to name Elizabeth heiress over Mary, which he does. Mary is imprisoned in 1553, Elizabeth ascends the throne with a husband at her side and two daughters. Mary later dies of stomach cancer as OTL, leaving Elizabeth unchallenged Queen.\n\n[2] Elizabeth catches smallpox as OTL, as does the Prince of Wales. Prince Edward dies, Elizabeth survives, but is rendered infertile.\n\n[3] Betrothed 1564. TTL, Margaret's marriage to the Duke of York is Elizabeth's price for allowing the Lennoxes to go home in 1564, thinking she'll bind them to her. Of course that rather backfires when Margaret's older brother catches the eye of Mary Queen of Scots.\n\n[4] OTL’s Winter Queen, daughter of James VI. Yes, they are rather closely related, hence their fertility issues.\n\n[5] ATL sister of Charles XI of Sweden (b. 1652)\n\n[6]Granddaughter to Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. Marriage is in secret – Diana is like her grandmother in character and has great influence over the 18-year-old Prince of Wales, who is six years her junior.\n\n[7] William's only surviving child, from his unequal match to Lady Diana Russell. William is encouraged to marry again after Lady Diana's death, and does so, but none of his other children survive infancy, leaving Parliament with little choice but to accept Diana Sarah Elizabeth as his heiress.\n\n[8] Eldest daughter of the Duke of Manchester. A love match permitted by the King and Queen to create joy following an ALT! Waterloo.\n\n[9] OTL Queen of the Netherlands. Since the English have seized the lands of the Prince of Orange TTL, making her Queen of England instead seemed a suitable compromise.\n\n[10] OTL Haakon of Norway. Let’s assume the union of Denmark and Norway limps on for a little longer in this TL.\n\n[11] Adelaide dies in childbirth with her last child, an unexpected pregnancy, at the age of 40.
