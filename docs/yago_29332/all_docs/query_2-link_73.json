        "text": "History of the world civilization. Book 2, part 2. Middle Ages. To the memory of Ja.N.Ljubarskij (1937-2003). Introduction: The idea of “Middle Ages” was introduced by the Humanists of 15th century, who called so the period from the end of the Western Roman Empire (476) to the epoch of Renaissance, when they lived. Middle Ages were understood by them as a period of decay. The Humanistic point of view was accepted in the Western historiography, albeit already from the beginning of 19 th century one began to find something positive in it, for example, the outstanding part, played by the church (Catholic in the West and Orthodox in the East) and knighthood, the appearance of the cities, universities, secular culture etc. The chronographic frames of the Middle Ages were defined in different ways. His beginning was thought to be not only the date, proposed by Humanists, but also more earlier dates (taking over of Rome in 455 by Vandals or by Goths 410, partition of the Roman Empire into the Western and the Eastern 395 or even the moving of capital to Constantinople 330). The opinions about the date of ending of medieval time differed too (the fall of Constantinople 1453, discovering of America by Columbus 1492 or the beginning of Reformation 1517). By these datings the history of the countries of Asia and Africa was not taken into account at all, albeit they reached exactly in this time the high level of development, which could be compared with the European and oft was ahead of it, but the important events of European history only were taken as the base of periodisation. The traditional Marxist historiography has seen the Middle Ages as the time of domination of the feudal system, which was propagated in the all countries of the world (albeit the other opinions existed too, Marx himself thought that the special Asiatic form of production existed on the East, this theory, condemned in the time of Stalin, was newly revived by Semenov). In such a way, as the base of the periodisation of Middle Ages was taken the criterion of appearing, development and decay of the feudal system, to which the periods accordingly of 5 th -10 th , 11 th - 15 th and 16 th -17 th centuries corresponded. As the end of the medieval era the English bourgeois re<strong>vol</strong>ution was taken, the beginning as earlier was put in 476 (for the East earlier, in 3rd-4 th centuries). Both Western and traditional Marxist understandings of Middle Age are not fully convincing. In the fact the medieval time is very different already in the territory of Europe, much more for Asia and Africa (in America in this time the early class civilizations existed, which were discussed already in the first <strong>vol</strong>ume, in Australia the primitive system was dominating). The early Middle Ages with their “military democracy”, which grew into the barbaric kingdom or even Empires (like Empire of Karl the Great or Kiev Rus), were replaced by the epoch of feudal disintegration, then by the “developed Middle Ages” with the developed cities, universities, secular culture and at the end by the “late medieval times” – epoch of Renaissance, Reformation and geographical discoveries, in the politics of the layers-representative, and then the absolutist state. The cultural differences influence the differences of the systems of “feudal” states from Britain to Japan. But how big they are? Already for the antiquity we defined five main civilizations (Greek, Jewish, Persian, Indian and Chinese), their continuators are the civilizations of the medieval time, which can be defined already by the principle of religion. The “descendant” of the Greek civilization is a Christian, which is divided into the Western (Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox-Monophysitic), the Jewish civilization continues to exist, despite the absence of the own state (non-attention to this fact makes the most of the medieval histories incomplete), some time the Middle Persian Zoroastrian civilization still exists, later on it is replaced by the Islamic civilization, which propagates on the vast territory from Spain to India, conquered from other civilizations. Indian and Chinese civilizations continue to exist, in their sphere of influence more and more countries are in<strong>vol</strong>ved, therefore now one must speak about Hindu-Hinayanic (India, Shri Lanka, Indochina etc.) et"
