Mammals that can adapt to the cold weather prosper. c. 2500000 BC Homo habilis, small intelligent apes, evolve. They walk on their back legs and later learn to use tools. c. 1750000 BC A semicircle of stones 3 m/10 ft in diameter is constructed at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, within a concentration of animal bones and stone tools – the first known homebase or campsite. c. 1700000 BC Homo erectus evolves from Homo habilis. They learn to hunt, build huts, and use fire. c. 1420000 BC Evidence suggests that Homo erectus at Koobi Fora in Kenya may have used fire. c. 1 million BC Acheulian hand axes appear in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Typically 20–25 cm/8–10 in long, the entire surface is flaked to produce a diamond-shaped axe. Since the edges are formed by flaking from both sides they are sharper than the previous choppers and are used primarily as hunters' knives. Some of the earliest hand axes are used in Olduvai Gorge by Homo erectus. c. 500000\n\nBC\n\nHomo erectus in China is the first regularly to use fire.\n\nc. 300000 BC Oval huts 15 m/50 ft by 6 m/20 ft are built at Terra Amata near Nicaea (Nice), France – the first houses to be constructed. c. 200000 BC Scrapers for working hides become common suggesting that Homo erectus begins to wear clothing. c. 200000 BC Tools made from wood and bone begin to be developed and used in Africa, near Lake Turkana in present-day Kenya. c. 40000 BC The Upper, or Late, Palaeolithic cultural period begins. It is characterized by complex and specialized tools and the emergence of regional stone tool industries such as Perigordian, Aurignacian, Solutrean, and Magdalenian in Europe. An important new tool is the burin, or engraver, used to scrape grooves in bone; two parallel grooves are used to detach a sliver of bone to make a needle, awl (pin), or fish hook. Blade tools lacking a serrated edge, and small thin blades, are also made and are used to create long cutting edges when cemented into a piece of wood using resin. c. 35000 BC Homo sapiens produces advanced tools requiring assemblage of head and haft which provides more kinetic energy and allows large trees to be cut down. c. 34000 BC Homo sapiens sapiens, the ancestors of modern humans, are established in Britain. Their emergence has been attributed to their ability to\n\ndevelop tools to cope with the increasingly cold climate. c. 30000 BC Palaeolithic peoples record tallies on bone in central Europe and France; one wolf bone has 55 cuts arranged in groups of five – the earliest counting system. c. 28000 BC The earliest ceramics (small statues and beads) are made from local loess at the Pavlov Hills in what is now the Czech Republic. c. 25000 BC The bullroarer is invented. One of the first musical instruments, it consists of a thin piece of wood, bone, stone, or ivory attached to a long cord. When it is swung around the player's head the disc rotates to produce a tone. The whistle and flute – perforated bone and antler – also appear about this time. c. 14000 BC–c. 12000 Asian wolf.\n\nBC\n\nNear Kirkuk, Iran, the dog is domesticated from the\n\nc. 12000 BC Leaf-shaped projectile points are made in the southwest of North America. They are known as Clovis points. c. 11000 BC Hunters in Somerset, England, develop a rudimentary calendar. The passage of lunar months is etched onto a hare's shinbone. c. 10000 BC Distinctive leaf-shaped arrowheads, as well as scrapers, knives, and blades, known as the Folsom cultural complex, begin to be made by hunting cultures on the Great Plains, North America. c. 10000 BC–c. 7000 BC The Mesolithic or Middle Stone Age begins in northern Europe. It is a food-gathering way of life, based on fishing and fowling rather than wide-range hunting; and it is adapted to new conditions, either a forest or a waterside environment, with humans forced to the periphery by the allpervading forest. Economically and materially it is to some extent a retrograde step from the easy hunting days of the Palaeolithic Age. The 'kitchen midden' sites (as on the Danish coast) show people living close to or on top of a huge dump of the discarded remains of shellfish. c. 9000 BC Humans have reached the southernmost tip of South America by now, as shown by carbon-14 dating at the site of Fell's Cave in Patagonia. c. 9000 BC Many large Pleistocene mammals, such as the camel, mammoth, horse, giant ground sloth, and tapir, become extinct in North America, possibly due to human hunting. c. 8000 BC After a very brief Mesolithic Age, the Neolithic or New Stone Age begins in the Middle East. This is a settled, food-producing way of life, dependent on the cultivation of crops and the domestication of animals, with people moving from struggling against nature to exploiting it for their own benefit.\n\nc. 8000 BC Cattle are domesticated in the Middle East, probably from the wild ox Bos taurus. c. 8000 Syria.\n\nBC\n\nDomesticated wheat is grown at Tell Mureybit on the River Euphrates,\n\nc. 8000\n\nBC\n\nThe population of the world is over 5 million.\n\nc. 8000 BC The woolly mammoth becomes extinct in Europe, possibly due to overhunting. c. 8000 BC–c. 2700 BC The Mesolithic or Middle Stone Age begins in western Europe. It is characterized by the use of microliths (very small stone tools mounted on a shaft), chipped stone tools, and bone, antler, and wooden tools. Important inventions include the barbed fish-hook, harpoon, woven basket, clay cooking pot, and the comb. Some examples of these tools have been found at Star Carr in Yorkshire, England. c. 7500 BC The ice covering much of the Earth has by now melted to roughly modern levels. This destroys many land bridges, for instance across the Mediterranean. The separation of the British Isles from the European mainland occurs about this time. c. 7350 BC The earliest known township of Jericho in the Middle East is surrounded by a wall 6.4 m/21 ft high, and a moat 4.6 m/15 ft wide and 2.7 m/9 ft deep, making Jericho the first fortress, and indicating that organized raiding and warfare have appeared. c. 7000\n\nBC\n\nAgriculture begins to be practised in the Aegean region.\n\nc. 7000 BC Navigation of the open sea begins. Greek seafarers ship obsidian 121 km/75 mi from the island of Melos to the Franchthi cave on the gulf of Argolis in Greece. c. 7000 BC The bow and arrow are developed in North Africa, probably to facilitate hunting in dense woodland. c. 7000 BC The earliest known domesticated pigs are kept at the village site of Cayonu, Asia Minor. c. 7000\n\nBC\n\nThe first pottery is made, in Eurasia.\n\nc. 7000 BC The Neolithic or New Stone Age begins in southern Europe, Asia, north Africa, and South America. It is characterized by polished stone tools, settlement in permanent villages, a more complex social structure, and the domestication of plants and animals. c. 6800\n\nBC\n\nThe first evidence of settled existence in houses appears at the site of\n\nJericho in the Dead Sea valley, Palestine, and settlement expands very rapidly. This can only be explained by the development of new agricultural techniques creating a complex irrigation system leading to larger areas of fertility. Such development implies a considerable degree of social organization and a central authority to organize a workforce. c. 6000 BC At Çatal Hüyük in Anatolia, southeast of the modern Turkish city of Konya, one of the oldest towns is thriving. Pottery is in use here, as is an advanced artificial agricultural irrigation system. Çatal Hüyük is one of the largest Neolithic sites in the Near and Middle East, with a sophisticated trade and urban life. c. 6000 BC Human skulls are made into ornamental masks in Jericho, in what may be a cult of ancestor worship. Painted clay and cowrie shells are used for eyes. c. 6000 BC Rock drawings in Egypt indicate the use of relatively large ships in the eastern Mediterranean and on the Nile. Constructed out of bundles of reeds, the ends of the ships are bound together and bent upward to form the bow and the stern giving the keel-less ship a crescent-shaped profile. c. 6000 BC Rock paintings of the Capsian culture begin to appear in areas of North Africa, such as at Tasili (on the edge of the Sahara) and at Gafsa or Capsa (in Tunisia). Similar paintings are also executed in southeastern Spain, possibly by migrants from Gafsa. They usually depict hunting and food gathering scenes, and may have magical and luck-bringing significance similar to that of Palaeolithic cave paintings. They differ, however, in that the human figure is boldly shown in Capsian art, something that the Palaeolithic artist avoids. Some of the human figures appear strange and terrifying and perhaps represent anthropomorphic gods. c. 5500\n\nBC\n\nCopper is smelted in Persia, the first metal to be smelted.\n\nc. 5500 BC The wheat–barley/cattle–pigs–sheep agricultural complex reaches what is modern Bulgaria. The complex diffuses both east and west at a rate of about 1.5 km/1 mi per year from its centre in the fertile crescent. c. 5000 BC The equal-arm balance is invented in Egypt. It consists of a beam supported by weighing pans hung from both ends. c. 5000 BC The wheat–barley/cattle–pigs–sheep agricultural complex reaches southern Italy. c. 4500 BC The fourth of the great Neolithic river valley civilizations is formed on China's Huang He or Yellow River, the other three being the Nile, the Tigris– Euphrates, and the Indus valley civilizations. The oldest culture in the Huang He region is known as Dang-shao, economically based on millet, the pig, the goat, and the dog. c. 4400\n\nBC\n\nPeople in Europe and Eurasia start to use flint to make axe-heads.\n\nc. 4400 BC The weaving loom is invented in Egypt. It consists of a frame that holds two sets of alternating parallel threads in place (the warp). By raising one set of threads it is possible to run a cross-thread (the weft) between them using a shuttle. c. 4200 BC The Sumerian civilization begins in southern Mesopotamia, although the Sumerian language may have come with later immigrants. Townships begin to form, such as that at Eridu, traditionally the first in the area.The first move is made to occupy the marshland of the twin rivers Tigris–Euphrates, probably from the Iranian plateau to the east. c. 4100 BC The Chalcolithic (copper–stone) Age begins at the end of this millennium and continues for the first half of the next, affecting most of the 'Fertile Crescent', from the Nile valley through Palestine and Syria to the Tigris– Euphrates valley. Tools as well as ornaments are now made of copper as an alternative to stone. Copper beads are used by the Badarian culture of the Nile. c. 4000 BC Rice is cultivated in China and at Non Nok Tha, in present-day Thailand. c. 4000 BC The 'Windmill Hill People', named after a site near Avebury in Wiltshire, appear in Britain. Their settlements, known as 'causewayed camps', show them to be herdsmen rather than agriculturists, and their 'camps' may have been used only for seasonal gatherings. c. 4000 BC The Neolithic way of life develops in northern Europe, including Britain, in this millennium. This development may be spontaneous or it may be indebted to influence, or even migrations, from the Mediterranean area. c. 4000 BC Villages are built over, or on the edge of, lakes in the district of modern Zürich, Switzerland, presumably for protection against attack by people and animals. They house an elaborate and successful culture that lasts into the Bronze Age. c. 4000 BC Wheat, barley, peas, dates, and other fruits are grown in the Indus valley. Water buffalo, camels, and cattle are bred for food and as draft animals. c. 3500 BC The ass, the first draft animal, is domesticated and is in common use in northeast Africa, Egypt, the Mediterranean basin, and both the Near and Far East. They are used as pack animals and are in regular service on caravan routes stretching from eastern Europe and northern Africa to India and China. c. 3500 BC The Grand Menhir of Locmariaquer is erected in Brittany, France. Set among other standing stones, it is the largest in the world, at 20 m/66 ft high and 380 tonnes in weight. c. 3500\n\nBC\n\nThe llama and alpaca are domesticated in present-day Peru.\n\nc. 3500 BC The potter's wheel is in use in the manufacture of Sumerian pottery, giving it a more symmetrical style. c. 3500 BC The Sumerians invent the wheel. Consisting of two or three wooden segments held together by transverse struts that rotate on a wooden pole, its invention transforms transportation, warfare, and industry. It also suggests that draft animals had been tamed by this date and that metallurgy for making saws and axles is also available. Evidence indicates that the wheel was invented only once and then spread to Asia and Europe. c. 3500 BC The wheat–barley/cattle–pigs–sheep agricultural complex reaches Britain and Scandinavia. c. 3400 BC Cuneiform (wedge-shaped) writing is invented by the Sumerians at Uruk. Consisting initially of about 1,500 symbols it is first used to make inventories of goods and to record transactions on clay tablets. One of the earliest documents, the Standard Professions List, gives the titles of officials and professions arranged in hierarchical order. The cuneiform script is gradually improved over the next few centuries but knowledge of it is lost in the 2nd century BC with the development of papyrus and paper. The new technique influences the Egyptian development of hieroglyphics. c. 3400 BC The first important metallic alloy, bronze, is discovered. Alloying copper with tin makes bronze. c. 3400\n\nBC\n\nThe first symbols for numbers, simple straight lines, are used in Egypt.\n\nc. 3300 BC The thin flat stones called palettes, used in Egypt for grinding malachite for eye-painting, develop into significant works of art. Some are inscribed with early pictographic and post-pictographic writing, and others with scenes of intercity warfare. They also show a Sumerian influence, as does an ivory knife handle of the period which pictures 'the master of the beasts', a man or god flanked by tamed lions.The most famous palette depicts King Menes, founder of the 1st dynasty of kings in Egypt, defeating the lord of the Delta Land (the Nile delta area of lower Egypt). 3100 BC King Menes advances from his southern capital of Thinis (Abydos) in Egypt and overcomes the Lord of the Delta Land. He creates the so-called 1st dynasty of the combined prehistoric kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt. c. 3100 BC The earliest form of Egyptian hieroglyphics (sacred carvings) appear. They are used until about AD 40. c. 3100 BC The Egyptian king Menes has a large (15 m/49 ft high) masonry dam built on the Nile south of Memphis (Cairo) to provide water for irrigation and for the city. It is the first large-scale dam.\n\nThe first civilizations (3000–801\n\nBC)\n\nc. 3000\n\nBC\n\nCamels are domesticated in the Middle East.\n\nc. 3000\n\nBC\n\nCandles made of tallow begin to be used in Egypt and Crete.\n\nc. 3000\n\nBC\n\nCotton fabric is first woven in the Indus valley.\n\nc. 3000\n\nBC\n\nIrrigation canals begin to be built in Mesopotamia and Egypt.\n\nc. 3000\n\nBC\n\nPapyrus, derived from reed, is invented in Egypt.\n\nc. 3000 BC The abacus, which uses rods and beads for making calculations, is developed in the Middle East and adopted throughout the Mediterranean. A form of the abacus is also used in China at this time. c. 3000 BC The arch, a fundamental architectural structure, is first used in Egypt at a tomb in Helouan, outside Cairo. c. 3000 BC The building of megalithic monuments begins to spread throughout northwestern Europe. Great stones are used to build either chambered barrows (passage graves such as those found at West Kennet in Wiltshire, England, or at New Grange, Ireland) or, later, impressive monuments of upright stones for religious and/or social purposes (such as those at Avebury and Stonehenge in England, or at Carnac in France). c. 3000 BC The chariot is invented in Ur and Tutub in Sumeria. It is constructed of solid wheels that rotate on a fixed axle, a wooden platform protected by sidescreens framed with wood and covered with skins, and a draft pole linked to the yoke of a pair of oxen. They are mounted by both spear-carriers and charioteers. c. 3000 BC The cubit, the length of the arm from the elbow to the extended finger tips, is devised in Egypt as the standard unit of linear measure. A royal cubit of black granite serves as the standard for all other cubit sticks. c. 3000 BC The Egyptians develop a civil calendar of 365 days divided into twelve 30-day months, plus five intercalated days added at the end. It is based on the lunar cycle and regulated by the appearance of Sirius (the Dog Star) above the horizon, and the flooding of the Nile. c. 3000 BC The Sumerians of Babylon develop a sexagesimal (based on 60) numbering system. Used for recording financial transactions, the order of the numbers determines their relative, or unit value (place-value), although no zero value is used. It continues to be used for mathematics and astronomy until the 17th century AD.\n\nc. 2900 BC The Deluge or Flood commemorated in Sumerian and biblical legend is most likely to have happened at this time. Archaeological evidence suggests more than one flood. c. 2900 BC The Indus Valley civilization (known as the Harappan) is formed. Considerable Sumerian influence is apparent. Its two chief cities are Mohenjo Daro, in modern Sind, about 400 km/250 mi up the River Indus, and Harappa, 560 km/350 mi further upstream on the River Ravi in the Punjab. c. 2800 BC The Neolithic monument Stonehenge is built in England near Salisbury, Wiltshire, comprising a circular earthwork 97.5 m/320 ft in diameter with 56 small pits around the circumference (later known as the Aubrey holes). The position of the 'heel stone' outside the circle suggests a connection with Sun worship and observation. It is probably an astronomical observatory with religious functions; the motions of the Sun and Moon are followed with the aid of carefully aligned rocks. c. 2700 BC A lunar calendar is developed in Mesopotamia in which new months begin at each new moon. A year is 354 days long and the calendar is used primarily for administrative purposes. c. 2700\n\nBC\n\nTea is known in China.\n\nc. 2700 BC The horse is domesticated, probably by pastoral nomads in the Ukraine. 2686 BC Egypt's 3rd dynasty is founded by Sanakht and is the start of Egypt's Old Kingdom (2686 BC–2180 BC). Under Zoser (Djoser), its second king, Egypt's southern boundary is established at the Nile's first cataract, and the first, stepsided pyramid is built at the necropolis of Saqqara in the city of Memphis (Cairo), by his minister Imhotep, physician, architect, and author. The oldest monument of hewn stone in the world, it consists of six steps and is 62 m/200 ft high. 2686 BC The tomb of the Egyptian king Khasekhemui, last king of the 2nd dynasty, and often considered the founder of the Old Kingdom, is built. It is the earliest stone building that can be accurately dated. 2675 BC Gilgamesh, King of the Sumerian city of Uruk, revolts against another Sumerian city, Kish. He becomes a legendary hero and later has an epic written about him. c. 2650 BC Chinese emperor Huang Di begins the canon of internal medicine, with the text Nei Jing/Inner Canon of Medicine, which balances ideas of yin and yang. Most subsequent Chinese medical literature is founded on it. There is some evidence, however, suggesting that the Nei Jing may actually date from only the 3rd century BC. c. 2650 BC The Egyptian Books of Wisdom are written, using papyrus as a writing material. Written for religious instruction, one of them is credited to the\n\nEgyptian physician and architect Imhotep. c. 2650 BC The Egyptian healer Imhotep is the first to attempt to find nonreligious causes of disease. c. 2650 BC The wife of Chinese emperor Huang Di reputedly discovers how to produce silk, and the domestication of the silkworm begins. c. 2600 BC Iron is first used; it is valued as a precious metal without its superior qualities being recognized. Two iron artefacts are placed in the Great Pyramid of at El Gîza. c. 2600 BC The Egyptians begin the art of mummification; internal organs are removed and preserved in jars containing a salt solution. The body is prepared with bitumen, which is thought to have medicinal properties. c. 2590 BC King Snefru has two pyramids built at Dahshur in Egypt; the first, called the 'bent' pyramid, has a double slope and is the first attempt to build a true pyramid (one without steps). The second, the North Stone Pyramid, is the first true pyramid. c. 2575 BC The Egyptian king Khufu (Greek Cheops) builds the Great Pyramid at El Gîza. One of the Seven Wonders of the World, it is the largest pyramid ever built, measuring 270 m/776 ft each side and standing 146 m/481 ft high. Consisting of 2.3 million bricks, each weighing 2,500 kg/2.5 tonnes, the pyramid is a marvel of engineering skill. Its base is an almost perfect square with its right angles deviating by only 0.05%. Alongside the pyramid a separate pit contains a dismantled boat. His nobles are buried in mustabas, mud-brick tombs covered with a flat-roofed superstructure of brick. c. 2550 BC The temple of the Great Sphinx is built at El Gîza by the Egyptian king Khafre (Chephren). It is smaller than those built by Khufu (Cheops). c. 2500 BC A temple in the Babylonian city of Nippur is filled with clay tablets to create the first known library. c. 2500\n\nBC\n\nElephants are domesticated in India.\n\nc. 2500 BC Highly advanced water-supply systems, involving wells, storage reservoirs, aqueducts, and canals, are built along the Tigris, Euphrates, Nile, and Indus rivers. c. 2500 BC Metal mirrors, made of highly polished silver, gold, and bronze, are used in Egypt. c. 2500 BC Ptahhotep, governor of Memphis at the time of the 5th dynasty of Egypt, writes the first known book of philosophy, his Instructions to his son.\n\nc. 2500 BC The art of dyeing fabrics begins in Egypt. The practice probably began earlier in India with indigo. c. 2500 BC The Egyptians make glass beads – the earliest glass objects known. The glass is cut and polished after cooling, rather than moulded while hot. c. 2500\n\nBC\n\nThe practice of acupuncture is developed in China.\n\n2331 BC Sargon of Akkad, a man of humble origin, usurps the throne of the north Sumerian city of Kish and sweeps south, defeating King Lugal-zaggisi of Umma, to make himself master of all Sumeria. He conquers the Elamite city of Susa and may even have conquered Cyprus. He builds a new capital near Kish, which he calls Akkad (the exact site of which is still unknown). c. 2300 BC The Babylonians portray canals, rivers, and surrounding mountains on clay tablets – the first maps. Egyptian map-making is developing at about the same time. c. 2300 BC The statue of Egyptian king Pepi I is made using the lost-wax method – the earliest known example of the method. The statue is cast in wax and then covered with a claylike material to form the mould which is then heated to harden it and to melt the wax. The mould is then filled with molten metal. 2250 BC The Mesopotamian king Naram Sin, third son of Sargon, king of Akkad, erects a stele Victory of Naram Sin, which boasts of his conquests, depicting his military campaigns and the warlike Akkadians, and showing him trampling his enemies. In later legend, however, Naram-sin appears as an unlucky ruler. c. 2250\n\nBC\n\nThe use of the scarab beetle as an amulet begins to appear in Egypt.\n\n2205 BC Chinese civilization traditionally begins with the founding of the Xia dynasty by You the Great, although 1989 BC has been put forward as an alternative date. c. 2200 BC The Avebury stone circles are constructed in Wiltshire, England. Consisting of three circles of about one hundred sandstone pillars, some weighing over 50 tonnes each, it is the largest such stone monument in Europe. 2190 BC The Sumerian Empire of Sargon is swept away by barbarians from the mountains to the north, whom the Sumerians call the Guti or 'the Vipers from the Hills'. The invasion and the ensuing confusion is described as a time of terror by Sumerian literature. c. 2160 BC–c. 2040 BC Egypt's 1st Intermediate Period begins after the death of King Pepi II. It is a time of warring, near anarchy, and a host of local rulers lasting through the 7th to 10th dynasties. 2113\n\nBC\n\nSumeria revives for the last time under the third and most famous of Ur's\n\ndynasties, founded by Ur-nammu. Prosperity lasts for about a century under him and his descendants, Dungi and Ibi-Sin. 2040 BC King Mentuhotep (or Nebhapetre) II of the 11th dynasty, who came to power in 2060, achieves the reunion of Egypt, and establishes Egypt's Middle Kingdom (2040 BC–1786 BC). c. 2000 BC A two-wheeled chariot with spoked wheels is depicted on a seal from Hissar in northern Elam. The body of the chariot is light, consisting of a high wickerwork dashboard and a floor of leather planks. Domesticated horses are yoked on either side of a pole and controlled by a bit made of two links of metal. This military chariot revolutionizes warfare by providing armies with unprecedented mobility. c. 2000 BC Disturbances force Aryan-speaking Indo-Europeans to move southwards into Asia Minor and northern Greece and Italy. The disturbances must have begun in the steppe north of the Caspian Sea where Aryan-speaking IndoEuropeans have been leading a nomadic existence, tending horses, for centuries. c. 2000 BC Sumeria is invaded from the north by the Amorites (Semitic desert tribes), led by the king of Mari, and from the east by the Elamites. The Sumerian city of Ur is besieged. Its great 3rd dynasty comes to an end and King Ibi-Sin is carried away in chains. c. 2000 BC The 'Beaker People', named after their distinctive drinking vessel, the bell beaker, migrate from Spain. They reach areas in modern south Germany, Czechoslovakia, and England. They are agriculturists, their weapon is the bow and arrow, and they introduce the use of bronze. c. 2000 BC The first seed drills are used in Egypt. Seeds are deposited into the ploughed furrow by a funnel attached to the back of the plough. c. 2000 BC The Minoans in Crete develop ships with log keels, ribbing, and planking on the sides from stem and stern to protect the bow against damage from waves. 1991 BC Amenemhet I, the first king of the great 12th dynasty, comes to the throne and consolidates the reunification of Egypt begun by the 11th dynasty. A noble of Thebes, he establishes Itj-towy, a new capital further north, close to the Old Kingdom's Memphis. The 12th dynasty creates a feudal age in Egypt, the king ruling with enhanced economic and religious sanction but through the local nobles, or nomarchs. 1971 BC Amenemhet I makes Senusret (Sesostris) co-regent to ensure continuation of the dynasty. Subsequent rulers continue the practice. 1955 BC A 'lament' is written for the destruction of Ur, the ancient city of Sumerian civilization, in Babylon, Mesopotamia.\n\nc. 1900 BC The 'amber routes', the earliest roads in Europe, are built by the Etruscans and Greeks to transport amber and tin from northern Europe to the Mediterranean and Adriatic. They are used until about 300 BC. c. 1900 BC The tomb of Chnemhotep, administrator of the Eastern Desert, is built in Egypt, with wall paintings depicting the great man fishing and fowling, and such captions as 'how delightful is the day of hunting the hippopotamus'. 1870 BC Egyptian king Senusret (Sesostris) III's engineers cut a channel 79 m/260 ft long, and 10 m/34 ft wide, through the cliffs of the Nile's first cataract at Elephantine so that his war galleys may pass. 1842 BC King Amenemhet III, the greatest monarch of the Middle Kingdom, comes to the throne in Egypt and reigns for 45 years. He is known as 'the good god', who benefits Egypt more than any before him. He restores the outpost garrison at the third cataract of the River Nile. 1800 BC Abraham, generally recognized as the first historical character in the Bible, leaves the Sumerian city of Ur, where he was born. He and his family may well have sojourned in Egypt, along with other wandering Semites. c. 1800\n\nBC\n\nChinese historical records refer to earthquakes.\n\nc. 1800 BC More than 3,000 menhirs, or standing stones, are erected in several parallel rows 4.8–6.4 km/3–4 mi long at Carnac, Brittany, in France. c. 1800 BC Neolithic farming reaches the Orkney Islands, off the northeast coast of Scotland, in the shape of a settlement at Skara Brae of well-built stone huts skilfully protected from the elements. c. 1800 BC The Assyrians enter history in a reference to their merchants' activities at the site of Kanesh (modern Kultepe) at the eastern end of the Anatolian plateau. The city has been excavated showing Assyrian merchants' quarters in one section of the native city. c. 1800 BC The Indus valley Harappan civilization, with its magnificently planned cities, is coming to an end due to invaders who, with little doubt, must be the peoples of Indo-European stock who later write the Vedas (Hindu scriptures). c. 1800 BC The typical barrow or tumulus (burial mound) in northwestern Europe becomes the round barrow rather than the Neolithic or megalithic long or chambered barrow. The use of round barrows continues into the Iron Age. 1792 BC King Hammurabi the Great establishes the first Babylonian Empire and a golden age of peace, prosperity, and law and order. He extends his empire west to the Mediterranean, east to Elam, defeating Rim-Sin, ling of Elam, who occupied most of Sumeria, and north to the land of the Assyrians, conquering their city of Eshnunna.\n\n1790 BC King Hammurabi of Babylon establishes a great bureaucracy to run his empire and personally attends to details such as correcting the calendar. His Code of Laws, although harsh, attempts to fit punishments to crimes; it protects the rights of women and recognizes an upper class, imposing harsher penalties for upper-class transgressors. 1786 BC Egypt's 13th dynasty reigns in the north but is not recognized in Thebes. It begins Egypt's Second Intermediate Period (1786–1567) and consists of a series of short-lived and unimportant kings who rule until the end of the century. The Second Intermediate Period is characterized by a loss of central political control and social upheaval. Power rests in the hands of the vizier, the king's chief advisor. 1780 BC Sophisticated inlay is used to decorate faience (glazed earthenware) at Knossos in Crete. The most famous example is the so-called Town Mosaic which shows houses of considerable sophistication, some with three storeys. 1750 BC Hammurabi, sixth Babylonian king of the Amorite dynasty c. 1792–c.1750 BC, dies. c. 1750 BC The Indus Valley civilization collapses as some of its cities are destroyed and their populations slaughtered, probably by Aryan peoples moving in from the west. The Aryan tribes move gradually eastwards, out of the Indus Valley and into the valley of the Ganges. c. 1700 BC The doors in the palace of Khorsabad in Nineveh, Assyria, are sealed with a device consisting of a pin-tumbler, a large wooden bolt pierced by several holes, and several wooden pins positioned to drop into these holes and grip the bolt – the first lock. c. 1675 BC The horse-drawn war chariot is introduced into Egypt by the Hyksos, a Semitic nomad people. It becomes the great new fighting weapon and status symbol for the military aristocracy of the Middle East. War chariots are also used by the Mycenaeans, but not the Minoans. c. 1600 BC Crete's favourable position on trade routes across the eastern Mediterranean extends Minoan influence throughout the Aegean. The new palaces develop into political, economic, administrative, and religious centres, also containing storehouses and craftsmen's workshops, and the Minoan rulers go down in Greek legend as great lawmakers. c. 1600 BC Greek-speaking invaders in the Aegean have penetrated the Peloponnese, where they begin to prosper and grow rich. They evolve the Mycenaean culture, named after its chief stronghold. Mycenae is ruled by a dynasty of kings, whose 'shaft graves' contain great wealth and fine art and weaponry, indicating that the Mycenaean princes are rapidly accumulating wealth.\n\nc. 1600 BC The snake goddess and other artefacts found at Knossos and elsewhere in Crete probably indicate that the Minoan people worship a mother earth goddess at this time. The bull-leap fresco at Knossos and similar works demonstrate a great Minoan preoccupation with the bull. c. 1600 BC The cat is domesticated in Egypt. (Although it has been proclaimed sacred since c. 2500 BC it is unlikely to have been domesticated at this time.) c. 1600 BC The Edwin Smith papyrus is written. The first medical book, it contains clinical descriptions of the examination, diagnosis, and treatment of injuries, and reveals an accurate understanding of the workings of the heart, stomach, bowels, and larger blood vessels. The papyrus is named after US scientist Edwin Smith, a pioneer in the study of Egyptian science who acquired it in Luxor, Egypt, in 1862. c. 1600 BC The four great Minoan palaces of Crete are built or rebuilt in this century with an architectural and artistic skill and sophistication that causes surprise when they are later discovered. The palaces are at Knossos, Phaestus (with its 'summer residence' at nearby Hagia Triada), Mallia, and Zakro. Frescos are now commonplace, and are used on the walls of Knossos palace. The new Minoan palaces use 'light wells' to give illumination without heat from the Sun, tied to an aqueduct system, and sanitation facilities flushed with water. c. 1570 BC Amose I becomes king and founds Egypt's great 18th dynasty. He finally destroys the Hyksos in their capital of Avaris and pursues what is left of them into Syria. He thus unites Egypt's new kingdom or New Empire (1567 BC–1085 BC). Ahmose I marries his sister, Ahmose-Nofretari. c. 1546 BC The Egyptian king Amenhotep I acceeds to the throne (1546 BC–1526 BC) and changes to an expansionist foreign policy, in direct contrast to the former policy of restoring or maintaining the country's boundaries. In the south he begins to subdue and colonize Nubia ('Kush'), while in the north he reaches the upper Euphrates and possibly penetrates the lands of the Hittites and the Mitanni in Asia Minor. He also initiates the practice of being buried in a rock-cut tomb rather than a pyramid. c. 1525 BC Thutmose I succeeds Amenhotep I as king in Egypt. His is the first tomb to be built in the Valley of the Kings; Egypt's 18th dynasty is now well established, with its capital at Thebes, and experiences a century and a half of greatness. c. 1503 BC Queen Hatshepsut has herself crowned pharaoh of Egypt. She assumes the double crown of Egypt, dresses as a man, and even wears the king's ritual wooden beard. With the help of her chief favourite, Senenmut, she concentrates on internal progress rather than foreign conquest. 1500 BC Chinese astronomers make the earliest record of an appearance of a comet.\n\nc. 1500 BC Neolithic skills similar to those in Europe – weaving, basketmaking, pottery, the building of houses, and the formation of villages – develop in the Americas, as well as a priest class. The use of iron, the wheel, the plough, and money will not develop until the coming of European colonialists. c. 1500 India.\n\nBC\n\nThe Hindu Vedic hymns and religious rituals become established in\n\nc. 1500 BC The Hittites of Asia Minor are the first to discover how to obtain iron from iron ore. Although iron is the second most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, metallic iron is only known from the rare discovery of iron-rich meteorites. c. 1500 BC The Urnfield cultures flourish in this and the following century in England (in Wessex), southern Germany, and Denmark. The Urnfield people are pastoral rather than agricultural, use bronze extensively, and are ruled by a warrior class of aristocracy. They cremate chiefs and their families and place the remains in urns which are then interred in cemeteries. The culture continues into the Iron Age (c. 700 BC). c. 1500\n\nBC\n\nWheeled vehicles appear in China.\n\nc. 1471 BC Egyptian king Thutmose III reaches the height of his success in his eighth campaign by crossing the upper reaches of the Euphrates River and temporarily defeating the Mitanni of Asia Minor, possibly with Hittite help. This is the farthest point that Egyptian armies will reach for nearly 800 years. c. 1470 BC The island of Thera is destroyed in a volcanic eruption. It causes a tidal wave and subsequent famine in Egypt, and destroys the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete over 120 km/75 mi away. It may be the source of the Atlantis myth. c. 1450\n\nBC\n\nA balance with a pointer indicating the weight is developed in Egypt.\n\n1450 BC–1400 BC The Linear B script supersedes Linear A at Knossos, Crete. Linear B is an early form of Greek, and its adoption in Crete demonstrates Mycenaean domination there. It is not as flexible as current cuneiform or Egyptian hieroglyphics, and seems to have been used for administration purposes only, for example in accounting, ration issues, lists of personnel, tallies of tax receipts in kind. These documents (incised on clay but also probably written on papyrus) show signs of agricultural prosperity, particularly in the number of sheep. c. 1400 BC An alphabet is developed in Ugarit, Syria, that consists of 30 characters. c. 1400 BC The clepsydra (water clock), consisting of a vessel with a hole in the base and lines on the inside to indicate the passage of time, begins to be used in Egypt. It has the advantage over the sundial in that it can be used to tell the time at night. It may already have been in use in Babylon.\n\n1374 BC Egyptian king Amenhotep IV changes his name to Akhenaton (or Aknaton, or Ikhnaton) to conform to a new religion which worships the sun god Aton over the previous cult of Amon. Akhenaton institutes a religious and cultural revolution with the worship of Aton. He builds a large temple to Aton at Karnak and constructs a new capital, Akhetaton ('The Horizon of Aton'), halfway between Thebes and Memphis. c. 1370 BC Tutankhamen, King of Egypt (1361–1352 discovered in 1922, born (–1352 BC). 1361\n\nBC\n\nBC),\n\nwhose intact tomb was\n\nChinese astronomers make the first recording of an eclipse of the Moon.\n\n1361 BC The boy king Tutankhaton, son-in-law of Akhenaton (or Aknaton, or Ikhnaton) and younger brother of Smenkhkare, ascends to the Egyptian throne. Two years later he changes his name to Tutankhamen, rejecting the worship of Aton in favour of the worship of Amon-Re, and returns to Thebes. The religious revolution is over and the new capital of Akhetaton is left to crumble. 1352 BC Egypt's wealth is demonstrated by the magnificent grave goods of Tutankhamen, a youthful and comparatively unimportant king. They include iron daggers, a chariot, a wooden chest, depicting the king in battle behind his prancing chariot horses, the throne-panel showing Ankhesenamen endearingly touching her husband, and the scene on an ivory chest of the young Ankhesenamen and Tutankhamen picking flowers. The tomb, which – exceptionally – was not robbed, was discovered by the English archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922, and opened in 1923. 1352 BC Tutankhamen, King of Egypt 1361–1352 discovered in 1922, dies (c. 18).\n\nBC,\n\nwhose intact tomb was\n\n1340 BC The Hittite king Suppiluliumas defeats and ends the power of the Mitanni, capturing Carchemish and making Syria his dependency. The Assyrians, however, absorb the Mitanni's lands. c. 1302 BC The first recording of an eclipse of the Sun is made by Chinese astronomers. 1300 BC The Shang dynasty in China establishes the solar year at 365 1/4 days. The calendar consists of 12 months of 30 days each, with intercalary months added to adjust the lunar year to the solar. c. 1300 BC Tholoi, dry-stone beehive-shaped tombs, are built outside the walls of Mycenae, Greece, demonstrating considerable architectural skill in their construction. Grave goods include engraved gems, ivories, and decorated pottery. c. 1300 BC The first Chinese writing appears. About 2,000 characters of three kinds – pictographs, ideograms, and phonograms – are used to make oracular\n\ninscriptions on bone and tortoise shell. c. 1300 BC The great city of the Shang dynasty in China – Anyang on the Huan River, north of the Huang He – is founded. This is the last of seven capitals of the Shang dynasty. Archaeological digging has shown that the traditional claim for a great city is justified, and that a brilliant but barbaric culture exists for two and a half centuries. c. 1300 BC The people of the Chinese Shang dynasty demonstrate skill in architecture (with rammed earth buildings) and ceramics (with near-porcelain) at their capital, Anyang. The dynasty sees the start of the Bronze Age, with the development of bronze-casting techniques which enable the manufacture of a variety of urns or chalices, probably for use in religious services, each type having a different function. A sophisticated range of skills, including writing, chariot construction, and specialized forms of divination are to be found at this time. c. 1290 BC The Hypostyle Hall at Karnak, Egypt, started by Horemheb in 1320 BC but now completed by Ramses II, shows Ramses II in his chariot behind prancing steeds. 1276 BC With the accession of Shalmaneser I to the Assyrian throne, Assyria enters the first of its three periods of power. Shalmaneser strikes north and west, taking Carchemish but leaving Babylon to his successor. c. 1240 BC The Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt is most likely to have happened at this date, almost certainly in the reign of King Ramses II, though possibly earlier. The Israelites leave after being used to build the city of PiRamses on the Nile delta; they are led by Moses. 1232 BC The Egyptian king Merneptah achieves a victory over the invading Libyans, who are helped by the displaced Peoples of the Sea. Nearly 10,000 Libyans and their allies are killed, with few Egyptian casualties. 1223 BC The reign of Merneptah is followed by a 20-year period of five relatively unimportant kings and internal unrest. The last of these, and the last of the 19th dynasty, is a woman, Tausert – the only queen of Egypt, besides Hatshepsut to be buried in the Valley of the Kings. c. 1200 BC The I Ching/Book of Changes, a Chinese dissertation on divination, may have been written in this century. c. 1200 BC The Dorian Greeks, or at least a new group of Greek speakers, probably first arrive in the Peloponnese. Their arrival is followed during the remainder of the century by the destruction of the Mycenaean palaces. The palaces destroyed are Mycenae itself, Tiryns (probably caused by an earthquake), and Pylos. c. 1200\n\nBC\n\nThe Hallstatt culture appears in southern Germany, named after a\n\nlater cemetery found at Hallstatt, Austria. This culture originates in the Late Bronze Age in southern Germany and Austria and later, in the Iron Age, spreads throughout most of Europe. Burial is by inhumation below a tumulus (grave mound or barrow), with bronze (or later iron) swords, brooches, and pottery. c. 1200 BC The Iron Age begins as iron displaces bronze as the most important metal in Egypt and elsewhere. c. 1200 BC The Olmec civilization begins at San Lorenzo on the Gulf Coast plain of Mexico, near modern Vera Cruz. This is the first civilization of Mesoamerica (the area of the Mexican and Mayan civilizations). San Lorenzo is the predominant centre until 900 BC. Maize is almost certainly the staple crop. The Olmecs are skilled stone workers and also carve small jade objects. c. 1200 BC–c. 1100 BC This century sees the end of the Bronze Age in the Middle East and the Aegean and the beginning of a Dark Age, at least in the latter area. The turmoil caused by the displaced Peoples of the Sea may have been prompted by renewed pressure, from the north, of Indo-European tribes; as the century progresses these tribes, in particular the Phrygians and Dorian Greeks, penetrate Asia Minor and Greece. 1195 BC The death of Moses and the entrance of the Israelites into Palestine under their military leader Joshua probably occur at this time. The Israelites cross the River Jordan and capture Jericho. c. 1140 BC Chinese emperor Wen Wang establishes the first zoo. It covers 1,500 acres and is named the Ling-Yo/Garden of Intelligence. 1122 BC China's Shang dynasty declines, although some sources state that it lasts until 1027 BC, and the Zhou dynasty begins, said to have been founded by kings Wën and Wu. The Zhou dynasty makes China stable and prosperous for at least three centuries. For the first time China is knit, though loosely, into one feudal kingdom. c. 1122 BC Smallpox is first described, in China. Pharaoh Ramses V, who dies in 1157 BC, is considered the first known victim of the disease. 1115 BC King Tiglath-Pileser I comes to the Assyrian throne and consolidates Assyrian power. He strikes northwest into the Taurus Mountains, relieves the pressure of a combination of petty princes on his province of Kummukh (Roman Commegane), and defeats the remnants of the Hittites. He also reaches the Mediterranean coast and extracts tribute from Lebanon, Byblos, and Sidon. c. 1100 BC In the last third of the century there is a struggle among the Israelites, between those who want to continue as a theocracy and those who want to be like other nations with a king. The latter win. c. 1100 BC The Dorians spread to Crete. The Minoans reach the end of their distinctive civilization after three centuries of Mycenaean domination during\n\nwhich they have still retained their identity; for a few generations they flee before the invaders to live in the hills. The dispossessed Mycenaeans escape, partly to Arcadia, but largely to Attica and Athens itself. They also begin the socalled Ionian migration into the Aegean coastline of Asia Minor. The Dorians themselves migrate to the southern corner of this coastline. Cyprus has an influx of Greek immigrants at about this time, or even earlier. c. 1100 BC The Phoenicians are beginning to create a colonial empire, certainly trading with Spain, and possibly founding Tarshish and Gades in Spain, although these foundations may have been later. Similarly the Israelites, left alone for a while by their powerful neighbours, are succeeding in their efforts to develop from a collection of tribes into a united people and to dominate Palestine. c. 1100 BC The spinning wheel is invented in China, derived from the machines used to draw out silk from the silkworm. It subsequently spreads to India and reaches Europe about the 13th century AD. c. 1100 BC With the Egyptian empire much reduced the flow of riches into Egypt diminishes, and the country reverts to a state of near anarchy. The high priest falls and tomb robbery and the depredation of monuments becomes rife. Civil war also rages in Egypt, with Libyans and also Nubians taking part. c. 1100 BC–c. 1000 BC Both Assyria and Babylonia suffer from incursions by a confederacy of tribes, speaking a northern Semitic language called Aramaeans. Even the Assyrians, relapsing into a dark-age period of which little is known, are apparently fighting for their very existence. 1085 BC The death of the Egyptian king Ramses XI brings Egypt's New Kingdom, or New Empire, to an end. The country suffers confusion and rebellion during its 21st, 22nd, and 23rd dynasties, with occasional upsurges of interference in the Middle East, where its reputation, though lessened, is still considerable. Egypt loses control of Nubia and its Asiatic Empire during the 21st dynasty. 1084 BC Greek poet Aeschylus records that in this year Queen Clytemnestra, at her palace in Argos, Greece, is informed of the fall of Troy and her husband Agamemnon's return by a system of signal fires – the first recorded telegraph system. 1050 BC The Israelites in Palestine reach the height of their struggle with the Philistines, originally one of the displaced Peoples of the Sea but now settled along the coast of Canaan, as the Ark of the Covenant (the symbolic residence of the Israelite God) is captured and their holy city of Shiloh destroyed. 1027 BC The Zhou dynasty, traditionally said to have been founded by kings Wën and Wu in 1122 BC, overruns the failing Shang dynasty, establishing the Zhou people as the ruling force in China. 1025 BC Saul is made king of Israel and saves his country from the Amalekites (in the Negeb). Agag, king of the Amalekites, is spared by Saul but is assassinated by\n\nSamuel, the last of the Judges, as a fitting sacrifice in a holy war. 1010 BC King Saul of Israel and his son Jonathan are defeated and slain by the Philistines at the Battle of Mount Gilboa. David, Saul's successor, becomes king of Judah. 1003 BC David becomes king of a united Israel and Judah; he defeats the Jebusites and from their city creates his new capital, Jerusalem, the city of David. The Philistines attack him and he wins two battles over them. c. 1000 BC A Bronze-Age settlement is established at Hallstatt, Austria. The presence of salt is the primary attraction. The salt mines are worked using techniques developed in the Alps for the extraction of copper. At this time the Hallstatt culture is still confined to the area around southern Germany and Austria. c. 1000 BC A clay tablet is made in Babylon depicting the Earth as a disc surrounded by water with Babylon at its centre – the first map of the world. c. 1000 BC Assyria is quiet until at least the end of the century. The Israelites are therefore able, with the help of the Phoenicians, to develop their brief period of political significance and economic greatness. c. 1000 BC Human excrement, manure, and plant waste are used as fertilizer in Mesopotamia and Egypt. The idea of fertilization subsequently spreads throughout the Mediterranean. 1000 BC–961 BC The reign of David, King of Israel and Judah, faces internal dissent. The chief events of his reign (to which exact dates cannot be given) are: David brings the Ark of the Covenant to his new city, Jerusalem. He becomes prosperous and subdues his enemies, including the Edomites, whom he all but exterminates. During the Ammonite War, David has Uriah the Hittite 'put in the forefront of the battle' so that he can take Uriah's wife Bathsheba for his own. She bears David two children, of whom the second is the future king Solomon. David's favourite son, Absalom, murders his half-brother for the incestuous rape of his sister and flees the court. He is forgiven by David, but then revolts against him. David in turn has to flee Jerusalem. Absalom is defeated, slain, and ultimately lamented. Further revolts and wars accompanied by pestilence bring David's reign to a close. c. 990 BC Solomon, King of Israel, traditionally regarded as the author of the Old Testament books, the Book of Proverbs and the Song of Solomon, born (–931 BC). c. 962 BC David, second king of Israel, who established Israel as a united kingdom, and features prominently in the holy texts of the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic religions, dies (c. 70). 959 BC The temple of King Solomon of Israel and Judah in Jerusalem is completed. He proceeds to build palaces for himself and his wives. According to\n\nthe Old Testament, Solomon's temple is made of ashlar stone and with liberal use of gold. However, at 27m/90 ft by 9 m/30 ft (taking the cubit at 46 cm/18 in) it is still smaller than his palace, which measures some 46 m/150 ft by 23 m/75 ft. Solomon's temple is said to be designed more to Canaanite standards than Jewish. 945 BC Libyan chieftains, calling themselves chiefs of the Meshwash, take control in Egypt and begin the 22nd dynasty under Sheshonk I. They rule from the Nile delta. Thebes remains a religious centre, although considerable power is still exerted by the priesthood, which is increasingly dependent on the oracle. 945 BC Queen of Sheba's visit to King Solomon of Israel and Judah takes place about this time. Solomon begins to collect his vast harem of foreign women and attempts to please them with a proliferation of idolatries. 931 BC King Solomon dies, and the combined kingdom of Israel and Judah begins to disintegrate. He is succeeded by his son Rehoboam. c. 930 BC Solomon, King of Israel, traditionally regarded as the author of the Book of Proverbs and the Song of Solomon of the Old Testament, dies (c. 59). 925 BC–914 BC King Rehoboam of Israel and Judah, Solomon's son, is faced with discontent from his people as well as many external enemies. This dual pressure results in splitting the territory into two separate kingdoms: Israel (or the Ten Tribes) in the north, under King Jeroboam I, and Judah (hence 'the Jews') in the south, under King Rehoboam, with Jerusalem as its capital. c. 900 BC–c. 800 (Austria).\n\nBC\n\nThe use of iron spreads into Europe, particularly to Hallstatt\n\nc. 900 BC–c. 740 BC The Iron Age Villanovan culture is spreading in Italy, named after a typical site at Villanova near Bologna. There is greater skill in metallurgy and a gradual increase in the use of iron. Cremation is practised, with ashes being placed in an urn in a round hole in the ground. One of the main areas of Villanovan culture is Etruria. c. 900 BC–c. 500 BC La Venta becomes the major centre of the second phase of Olmec civilization in Mexico. The site of San Lorenzo is abandoned, possibly in a violent overthrow of the local elite, or possibly for religious reasons. La Venta is a ceremonial or elite centre, supported by a large agricultural population. It has a large main pyramid in addition to smaller ones. 879 BC–824 BC The rulers Ashurnasirpal II and Shalmaneser III of Assyria build themselves palaces at Calah, Assyria, (modern Nimrud, Iraq) including outstanding features such as colossal carvings of winged bulls and reliefs showing royal lion hunts and battle scenes. The archaeologist Sir Henry Layard unearths the palaces in the 19th century AD. 876 BC King Ashurnasirpal II of Assyria marches west to the Mediterranean and conquers Syria, founding the fortress of Harran from which to administer the\n\ncountry. He appears to leave the Jews alone, but extracts tribute from the Phoenicians. On his way he subdues the Neo-Hittite city of Carchemish. c. 850 BC The Chauvín de Huantar temple in Peru is constructed. Built without using mortar and with cantilevered ceilings, it is the oldest known building in South America. c. 850\n\nBC\n\nThe first arched bridge is built, at Izmir in present-day Turkey.\n\n841 BC The oppressive Chinese king Li is dethroned in favour of the Gong He or Public Harmony regency. Authentic chronology in Chinese history now begins; a feudal age follows, until the arrival of the Han dynasty in 206 BC. 827 BC The Chinese drive the nomadic Huns out of their domains. This may set in motion a movement of their western neighbours, the Scythians, which becomes apparent in the next two centuries. 814 BC The city of Carthage in north Africa is traditionally founded. It is developed as a Phoenician colony by the city of Tyre.\n\nThe Classical world (800\n\nBC–AD\n\n499)\n\nc. 800 BC Book XXIII of the Greek epic poem The Iliad contains the earliest known extensive description of a sporting event, the Funeral Games of Patroclus. It is mostly devoted to chariot racing, but there are briefer descriptions of boxing, wrestling, discus and javelin throwing, and foot races. In another epic poem, The Odyssey, Homer describes a game resembling team handball, which he says was invented by Angagalla, a Spartan princess. c. 800 BC The Greeks begin colonization and foundation of new cities along the mid-Mediterranean and Aegean coasts. This movement is caused by increased prosperity and the pressure of expanding populations. c. 800 BC The Hindu metaphysical treatises Upanishads, sacred texts in Hinduism, are begun. The earlier Upanishads, written in archaic Sanskrit, are completed before 500 BC, though they continue to be produced for centuries. 776 BC Coriobis of Elis becomes the first recorded victor in the pan-Hellenic games, the Olympiad, winning the only event – the stade running race (a distance of 192.27 m/630.80 ft). This is the first definite date in Greek history. 771 BC The original Zhou dynasty of China (also known as the West Zhou period) ends with the deposing of its king, You, and the shifting of the capital city to Luoyang. The Zhou dynasty continues for another five centuries, but as a much looser confederacy of often-warring barons under a head who is little more than a religious symbol, 'the king of Heaven'.\n\n15 June 763 BC Assyrian archivists record an eclipse of the Sun. This is probably the event described in the Bible, in Amos 8:9. 753 BC Rome is traditionally founded by Romulus and Remus: this is the year from which the Romans date all subsequent events. The date is not completely reliable, though by now Latin-speaking tribes do exist in Italy, probably arriving from further east, with Etruscans to their north and Greek colonial city-states about to be founded to their south. 750 BC The city-state, or polis, is on the rise in Greece; it is distinguished by common gods and common law administered from a fixed place. With the political change come different military needs and the hoplite formation, heavily armed infantrymen in close order behind a wall of shields, is developed. c. 750 BC The Iliad and the Odyssey, the two great epic poems ascribed to the legendary Greek poet Homer, are composed. Though written around this date, they draw on a long tradition of oral poetry dating back to at least 1000 BC. c. 750 BC The Greek 'geometric' style of pottery gives way to an 'orientalizing' style, which introduces new motifs, particularly fantastic animals. c. 750 BC The radiating arch, where each wedge-shaped piece radiates away from its support, is developed by Etruscan architects. 722 BC The Israelite capital of Samaria falls to Assyria after a three-year siege and 27,290 Israelites are deported wholesale into Mesopotamia. This marks the end of Israel as a nation and the start of the so-called Captivity of the Ten Tribes. Judah is left alone. Israel becomes the land of the Samaritans, while Judah, under King Hezekiah, remains inviolate. 705 BC Sennacherib succeeds to the Assyrian throne. Assyria's vassal states and external enemies take the opportunity to stage a general revolt led by the king of Babylon and supported by the pharaoh of Egypt. King Hezekiah of Israel agrees to join the revolt (against the advice of the prophet Isaiah), hoping for Egyptian support. 705 BC The poet and farmer Hesiod of Boeotia, Greece, writes his Works and Days, a compilation of practical and ethical advice based on rural life, which is also the first recorded instructional book on agricultural practice, and his Theogony, which gives an account of the origin of the world and the birth of the Greek gods. He and Homer are said to have 'given the Greeks their gods'. 703 BC–701 BC The Assyrian king Sennacherib reacts energetically to the revolt by vassal states and defeats Babylon, which supported the revolt. He then turns west into Palestine, defeating an Egyptian army and taking Lachish (a city to the south of Jerusalem) as well as 'forty-six walled cities'. He records in stone the feats of his army at the siege of Lachish.\n\nc. 700 BC Oil lamps appear in Greece, replacing torches. The Greeks also invent the fibula (safety-pin), although the idea is lost after the fall of the Roman Empire. c. 700 BC The Assyrian king Sennacherib continues his campaign in Palestine and besieges Jerusalem. Hezekiah, King of Judah, with the prophet Isaiah's moral support, defies the Assyrians and successfully repulses them. Although he has to pay considerable tribute to Sennacherib, Judah remains independent. Sennacherib lists the booty stolen from Jerusalem and taken to his capital, Nineveh, on what has become known as the Rassam cylinder, named after the 19th-century archaeologist who found it, Hormuzd Rassam. c. 700 BC The Greeks develop the bireme, a galley about 24 m/80 ft long with two banks of oars staggered on either side of the vessel. c. 700 BC The Iron Age starts in much of Europe. (In Greece it began much earlier, about 1050 BC, and in Italy about 900 BC. In Britain it is later, about 650 BC.) c. 700 BC The rulers of the old civilizations, Egypt, Babylon, and Assyria, spend much of this period warring amongst themselves and so fail to appreciate the threat presented by new powers of different races, such as the Cimmerians, Scythians, Phrygians, Medes, Lydians, and Ionian Greeks. 691 BC The Assyrian king Sennacherib builds the 20-m/66-ft wide Jerwan aqueduct which brings water from a tributary of the Greater Zab River to Nineveh 80 km/50 mi away. Stone-lined, and constructed in 15 months, according to a surviving plaque, the aqueduct uses advanced techniques including sluice gates and a 275 m/900 ft limestone bridge, 9 m/30 ft high and 15 m/30 ft wide. It is the earliest significant public water-works project. c. 690 BC Ashurbanipal, last great king of Assyria (668–c. 627 BC), who created, at Nineveh, the first ancient library in the Middle East, born (–c. 627 BC). 671 BC Assyria renews its attack on Egypt, taking the city of Memphis. The pharaoh Taharqa is defeated but escapes to Nubia. King Esarhaddon of Assyria appoints local rulers, including Necho of Saïs, and then retires to deal with home affairs. 670 BC The Greek city-state of Argos, under King Pheidon, is at the height of its power, though soon to decline. Mycenae and Tiryns, two client states of Argos, temporarily defeat the city-state of Sparta in the Battle of Hysiai. 668 BC Ashurbanipal succeeds to the Assyrian throne, the last great king of Assyria. He concludes a treaty with the Phoenician city of Tyre, and the Phoenician coastal cities acknowledge Assyrian sovereignty. 668 BC At Nineveh, Assyrian king Ashurbanipal begins to assemble the world's first great library. Consisting of thousands of catalogued tablets (over 20,000 still\n\nexist) accumulated from temple libraries throughout the Middle East, the collection includes medical treatises (including prescriptions and guides to the diagnosis and treatment of disease), tables of multiplication, lists of plants, astronomical and astrological tables, and a treatise on glassmaking. 668 BC The scenes of royal lion hunts decorating the palace of Ashurbanipal in Assyria show Assyrian art at its finest, as do other excellent works in bronze and ivory. Military scenes have declined in popularity as the subject of works of art. 667 BC In his first Egyptian campaign, King Ashurbanipal of Assyria turns Pharaoh Taharqa out of Memphis, reappoints pro-Assyrian governors throughout the country, and then retires. Taharqa flees south to Nubia, where, in 664 BC, he dies. Assyria's puppet king in Egypt, Necho of Saïs, who had joined the rebels against Assyria, is temporarily taken away to the Assyrian capital of Nineveh as a captive. 663 BC In his final Egyptian campaign, King Ashurbanipal of Assyria claims to have penetrated to Thebes and to have carried away vast booty. However, the Egyptians also claim a victory. Both the pharaoh Tanutamon and the Assyrians retire, the former to his native Ethiopia (modern Sudan) where he settles in the city of Meroe. The 25th dynasty of Egypt ends with his passing from the Egyptian scene. 660 BC Japan's first emperor, Jimmu, traditionally comes to power. A Mongolian people begin to enter Japan, probably coming through Korea, and oust the indigenous Ainus. 651 BC Assyria retreats from Egypt for the last time, in order to deal with trouble nearer home. Egyptian pharaoh Psamtik I reforms the Egyptian government and removes the last traces of Cush rule. 650 BC The Hallstatt people learn to make use of iron and emerge as the great Iron Age Celtic culture of northern Europe. As trade routes reach them via the Rhône and Danube rivers, so their influence grows. They bury their chiefs in great style, the dead leader lying in his four-wheeled chariot with his weapons around him. They make their swords of iron or from iron models copied in bronze. 648 BC Archilochus of Paros, one of the earliest of the Greek lyric poets, is writing at this time. He directs some of his poems at the family who barred him from marrying their daughter, reputedly leading some members of the family to commit suicide. 648 BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal besieges Babylon, causing famine in the city and driving its citizens to cannibalism. Babylon capitulates to Assyria and is again devastated, but Ashurbanipal orders that the city be rebuilt. 630 BC The Greek city-state of Sparta wages its second war against Messenia, southwest of the Peleponnese. The revolt and second subjugation of the Messenians may well be the origin of the unique system of government in Sparta,\n\nby which a dedicated military aristocracy perennially suppresses a subjugated serf class of Messenians known as the helots. Particularly noted for its peculiar harsh laws and customs, The Spartans themselves credit their laws and constitution to a semi-mythical figure, Lycurgus. c. 630 BC Solon, Athenian statesman who replaced the ruling aristocracy with a rule by the wealthy, born (–c. 560 BC). c. 627 BC Ashurbanipal, last great king of Assyria (668–c. 627 BC), who created, at Nineveh, the first ancient library in the Middle East, dies (c. 63). c. 627 BC The death of King Ashurbanipal of Assyria marks the start of the disintegration of Assyria's last period of greatness as it finds itself overextended and without allies. 626 BC According to the Old Testament, the Hebrew prophet Jeremiah (credited with writing Lamentations and the Book of Jeremiah) warns his countrymen of a disaster that is about to befall them, in an invective full of phrases that have survived to become part of European literature. His warning refers to the Captivity, in which Jewish deportees are exiled to Babylon. The Hebrew prophets Zephaniah, Nahum, and Habakkuk are also active at this time. 626 BC The Scythians pour down through Syria and Palestine, helping to weaken Assyria, annihilating the Philistines, and reaching the borders of Egypt. 625 BC Sappho of Lesbos, the famed female Greek lyric poet, is active at this time. Her lyric poems are famous for their depiction of erotic love between women. c. 625 BC Spartan lyric poet Alcman writes Partheneia, choral songs for maidens. Parts of two songs survive to modern times. 612 BC The Medes persuade the Scythians to join with them and the Babylonians. They besiege the Assyrian capital Nineveh, which falls after three months and the Assyrian king perishes in the burning city. An Assyrian general, Assuruballit, assumes the kingship and takes up a new stand at Harran. 608 BC Pharaoh Necho II, seeing the chance to fill the vacuum left by Assyria and to reassert Egypt's traditional sway over Syria, sends his full army north. King Josiah of Judah, who still considers himself Assyria's vassal, meets the Egyptians single-handed at Megiddo and is slain. It is this battle that gives its name to the prophetic world-battle of the biblical book of Revelations: 'Har' (the Mountain of) 'Megiddo', Armageddon. 608 BC The Assyrians under Assuruballit fail to recapture Harran from the Babylonians and Medes and fade out of the records. The victorious Medes turn upon the Scythians, their temporary allies, who retire to their own lands.\n\n604 BC The people and towns of the old Assyrian Empire acknowledge Nebuchadnezzar, the Chaldean king of Babylon, as their new master. Only the Phoenician town of Askelon, and Jehoiakim, King of Judah, resist. Askelon is destroyed while Jehoiakim relies on the strength of Egypt, against the advice of the prophet Jeremiah. 600 BC The Athenians undertake their first overseas venture, the capture of Sigeum (a promontory controlling the Hellespont) from their neighbour Megara. The expedition is motivated more by economic than political or military considerations and marks the beginning of Megara's lagging behind in the great rivalry between the various Greek city-states. c. 600 BC Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar begins building the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. One of the Seven Wonders of the World, the gardens, located on terraces on a ziggurat, are irrigated by pumps from the River Euphrates. c. 600 BC Bronze begins to be replaced by iron in central Europe because of the growing ability to smelt and work metallic ores at high temperatures. c. 600 BC Roman king Tarquinius Priscus introduces the Roman Republican calendar. It consists of 12 months with a total of 355 days. An intercalated month is added between February 23 and 24 every two years in order to keep step with the seasons. Intercalations, however, are made irregularly and it becomes hopelessly confused. The calendar forms the basis of the Gregorian calendar. c. 600 BC–c. 480 BC The Greek Archaic period of sculpture is evident, a typical form being the kouros, a rigid freestanding nude. 597 BC King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon lays siege to Jerusalem in January and finally captures the city in March. A puppet king, Zedekiah, is installed, while King Jehoiakim and the leading men and artisans of the city are deported into Babylonia. The future prophet Daniel is a child among them. This period (until 538 BC) is known as the 'Exile' or 'Captivity of the Jews' in Jewish history. 596 BC Sparta, by now the most powerful Greek city, arbitrates in the long dispute and war between Athens and Megara over the island of Salamis and decides in Athens' favour. 594 BC In the Greek city-state of Athens, the statesman Solon is appointed archon with unlimited powers. He lays down new laws and a constitution, which end the practice of selling bad debtors into slavery and make a compulsory reduction in all debts. The reforms also include opening the Assembly to the lowest classes, the codification of the law, democratic reforms in the law courts, and a system of appointment to office by the drawing of lots amongst all citizens. 586 BC King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon resumes the siege of Jerusalem in response to King Zedekiah's rebellion against Babylonian rule, and the city falls – this time it is completely destroyed. This is the end of Judah as a nation, 136\n\nyears after the end of Israel. King Zedekiah of Judah flees but is captured at Jericho, and has to witness the death of his sons before being blinded. 28 May 585 BC The first accurate prediction of an eclipse of the Sun is made in 585 BC, by the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus. 582 BC The Pythian Games are inaugurated at Delphi, Greece, as a Panhellenic festival modelled on the Olympic Games. In the cycle of the four Panhellenic festivals, the Pythian Games are eventually held in the third year of each Olympiad. c. 581 BC Cyrus the Elder ('Cyrus the Great'), Persian emperor who founded the Achaemenid empire which stretched from the Indus River to the Aegean, born in Media Orpersis (–c. 529 BC). 578 BC Servius Tullius becomes king of Rome. He reigns for 43 years and organizes Rome as a soldier state, dividing all citizens into 'classes' according to their material worth. Taxation is based on these classes as is a citizen's role in the army. 570 BC Greek astronomer and philosopher Anaximander of Miletus continues the work of the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus and his speculation on ultimate reality, in On the Nature of Things. 570 BC The Egyptian pharaoh Apries tries to help the Libyans to destroy the Greek city of Cyrene in north Africa but fails and is deposed by the army, which mutinies. After a short civil war, Ahmose II, an Egyptian army general, is elected king of Egypt. Egypt prospers under his reign, during which he marries a Cyrenean, develops the delta town of Naucratis as a (mainly Greek) port, and acquires a reputation for being philhellenic. 570 BC The Greek city-state of Athens finally succeeds in winning the island of Salamis from Megara, the city-state between Athens and Corith. The young politician Pisistratus makes his name on the expedition. c. 570 BC Cleithenes of Athens, statesman and magistrate of Athens (525–524 who founded Athenian democracy, born (–c. 508 BC).\n\nBC),\n\nc. 569 BC Indian sage Mahavira takes up the ascetic life, renounces his family, and spends the next 12 years wandering India and developing the doctrine of ahimsa, or nonviolence, after which he re-organizes Jaina doctrine, founding Jainism. 566 BC The Panathenaea, the greatest of the Greek local festivals, is inaugurated at Athens. Held every year in summer with an even grander celebration (the Greater Panathenaea) every four years, it includes athletic and equestrian events, and musical, dancing, and poetry contests.\n\n563 BC Gautama Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama), Indian philosopher and founder of Buddhism, born in Kapilavastu, India (–c. 483 BC). 560\n\nBC\n\nPisistratus becomes tyrant of the Greek city-state of Athens.\n\n560 BC Under king Croesus Lydia benefits from being well situated for trade between East and West. The Greek cities on the coast of Asia Minor also benefit so, despite their precarious situation, they find it worthwhile to pay tribute to Croesus. c. 560 BC Solon, Athenian statesman who replaced the ruling aristocracy with a rule by the wealthy, dies (c. 70). 556 BC Pisistratus, the tyrant of the Greek city-state of Athens, is ousted and forced into exile. 551 BC Confucius (Chinese: K'ung-fu-tzu, or Pinyin: Kongfuzi), celebrated Chinese philosopher and political theorist, born in Ch'u-fu, Lu, now in Shantung Province, China (–479 BC). 550 BC Celts from Europe begin to arrive in the British Isles, mainly in Ireland, but also in Scotland and England. 550 BC Rome's second Etruscan king, Servius Tullius, achieves his greatest political successes in this decade. He begins an alliance with his neighbours in the shape of a Latin League, while at home he is reputed to have given a modicum of power to the assembly of the plebeians, set up in addition to the existing senate of elders which advises the king. c. 550 BC Lydian king Croesus builds the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. One of the Seven Wonders of the World, it is known for its great size, being 110 m/350 ft by 55 m/180 ft. 546 BC King Croesus of Lydia retires to his capital, Sardis, for the winter and sends for help against Persia from Egypt, Sparta, and Babylon. However, King Cyrus of Persia follows rapidly and Sardis falls; Croesus is probably spared. 545 BC The Ionian Greek cities of Asia Minor are forced to accept Persian suzerainty, although they retain their freedom to trade so long as they pay tribute. However, the Phocaeans, 'pioneer navigators of the Greeks', refuse to submit and flee to Corsica where they reinforce the colony of Alalia (or Aleria). 540 BC Greek astronomer and philosopher Anaximenes of Miletus, who studies cosmogony, the study of the origins of the universe, is active. 540 BC The exiled tyrant Pisistratus returns to the Greek city-state of Athens once more and remains tyrant until his death in 527 BC. His tyranny is remarkable for his respect for law and constitutional procedure, and his encouragement of\n\nagriculture and trade. c. 540 BC Athens, under its tyrant Pisistratus, takes over the Ionian religious festival on the sacred island of Delos. 29 October 539 BC King Cyrus of Persia triumphantly enters Babylon. The Persian Empire takes over from the short-lived Neo-Babylonian Empire and absorbs the kingdom of the Medes. 538 BC King Cyrus of Persia occupies Jerusalem and allows all the Jews in Babylon who wish to do so to return to their native land. 534 BC The last of Rome's kings, Tarquinius Superbus ('the Proud' or 'Arrogant'), traditionally accedes to the throne. He sets the tone of his 24-year reign by putting to death many senators and revoking his predecessor's concessions to the plebeians. Roman territory is extended during his reign. 533 BC King Cyrus of Persia crosses the Hindu Kush mountains (in modern Afghanistan) and receives tribute from the Indian cities of the Indus valley. The Greek historian Herodotus says he forms his twentieth satrapy (administrative district) of Gandhara there. 530 BC Siddhartha Gautama (later Gautama Buddha) leaves his life as a Bengal prince at the age of 30, and becomes an ascetic. c. 530 BC Because it casts an arcuate shadow on the moon during eclipses, Pythagoras of Samos proposes that the Earth might be spherical. c. 530 BC The golden age of Athenian vase pottery begins, in which the pottery is distinguished by red figures, left in the natural colour of the clay, on black. The Greek vase painters Euphronius and Euthymides are working at this time. 529 BC Cambyses becomes king of Persia following the death of his father, King Cyrus II the Great of Persia. The Persian Empire has now been firmly established, and this is considered to be its foundation date. 529 BC King Cyrus II the Great of Persia, who founded the Persian Achaemenid Empire, dies leading an expedition against the Massagetae, an Asiatic people from around the Sea of Aral (c. 52). 525 BC King Cambyses II of Persia invades Egypt, wins the stubbornly fought Battle of Pelusium, and besieges Memphis. Egypt passes into the Persian Empire under Persian kings who form the 27th dynasty. c. 525\n\nBC\n\nAeschylus, first Athenian tragic dramatist, born (–c. 456).\n\n521 BC After dynastic trouble, Darius I becomes king of Persia. There are revolts in Babylon and other parts of the Persian Empire.\n\n520 BC King Tarquinius Superbus makes Rome the undisputed head of the Latin League. He uses a combination of guile, military power, and diplomatic marriage. 520 BC The Sibyl, one of many prophetic priestesses, offers to sell the Sibylline Books, a collection of prophecies, to the king of Rome Tarquinius Superbus. He initially refuses to pay the price of 300 pieces of gold, and only after the Sibyl has burnt most of them does he realize their worth. He purchases the remaining books for the original price. They are consulted by the Roman senate in times of crisis, the last known occasion being in AD 363. c. 519 BC Xerxes I, King of Persia (486–465 Persia (–465 BC).\n\nBC),\n\nwho invaded Greece, born in\n\n517 BC Chinese philosophers Confucius and Lao Zi (Lao Tzu) reputedly meet. Lao Zi, who is credited with Tao Te Ching/The Book of the World Law and its Power, may be a mythical founder figure, invented to support the philosophy of Taoism. 510 BC King Cleomenes of Sparta helps the Athenians oust the tyrant Hippias, the son of Pisistratus, and the period of 'tyranny' in Athens ends. In return, Athens is forced to join Sparta's Peloponnesian League. c. 510 BC The temple of the virgin goddess Aphaea is built on the island of Aegina. It is famed for its sculptures, which in modern times are held in Munich, Germany. 508 BC The exiled king of Rome, Tarquinius Superbus, fights the indecisive Battle of Silva Arsia against the Romans, with the help of the Etruscan people of Veii, and fails to win back his throne He allies himself with the Etruscan Lars Porsena, King of Clusium. c. 508 BC Cleithenes of Athens, statesman and magistrate of Athens (525–524 who founded Athenian democracy, dies (c. 62).\n\nBC),\n\n507 BC Lars Porsena, the Etruscan king of Clusium, marches on Rome and besieges it. It is probable that he captures the city, but his stay there is brief. 507 BC Would-be chief magistrate Cleisthenes' legal constitutional reforms in the Greek city-state of Athens and establishes firmly its particular form of democracy. The four ancient tribes are abolished and replaced by ten new ones, and all citizens are enfranchized with a personal vote in the popular assembly. 506 BC Cleomenes of Sparta organizes a full-scale Peloponnesian invasion of Attica. However, the city-state of Corinth withdraws support and the plan collapses. Athens demonstrates its new-found power by defeating the Boeotians and Chalcidians. 500 BC Greek traveller and geographer Hecataeus of Miletus, writes Ges periodos/ Tour Around the World, a description of the geography and ethnography of\n\nEurope, northern Africa, and Asia – the first book on geography. c. 500 BC Etruscan art flourishes, especially in the fields of bronze, pottery, and tomb wall paintings. c. 500 BC Greek philosopher Heraclitus of Ephesus centres his philosophy on the proposition that 'everything flows', and the belief that the cosmos is in a constant process of change. c. 500 BC Greek physiologist Alcmaeon is the first person to dissect the human body for research purposes. He discovers the optic nerve, describes the difference between arteries and veins, and recognizes that the brain, which he describes in detail, is the source of intelligence. He also possibly practises vivisection. c. 500 BC Phrygian religion influences Greece and, at a later date, Rome, with their mother goddess Cybele and her male attendant-god Attis. c. 500 BC The Greeks introduce the trireme, a galley about 45 m/150 ft long and 6 m/20 ft wide with three banks of oars. The oars are worked from an outrigger that extends down the length of the hull, and the ship carries about 200 people, mostly oarsmen. It becomes the model warship for both the Greeks and the Romans. c. 500 BC The town of Monte Albán is founded in the Oaxaca region of Mexico. It becomes the capital of the Zapotec culture. The town is sited on a steep, high bluff in the centre of a valley, and dominates the surrounding area for the next 12 centuries. 500 BC–490 BC King Darius the Great is enraged by mainland Greek intervention in Asia Minor. He demands earth and water, the symbols of submission, from the Greek city-states. Some, including Aegina, submit but Athens and Sparta disdainfully reject his demand and in 490 BC the Persian Wars begin. c. 500 BC–c. 400 BC Rome and its Latin allies are almost constantly at war with both the Etruscans in the north and the native mountain tribes to the south, in particular the Aequi and the Volscians. c. 500 BC–c. 400 BC The Celts begin to make an impression on European history. They are divided into a number of different tribes, sharing a distinctive decorative style of art, characterized by curving designs and mythical animals. These can be seen on their jewellery (gold and bronze torques), their weapons (decorated shields and sword scabbards), and their pottery and other vessels. The Celts probably originate in northwest and central Europe, France (particularly the area of Champagne), Switzerland, Lower Austria, and western Slovakia. The area of the western Hallstatt, Upper Austria, is also associated with the Celts. 499\n\nBC\n\nAristagoras, tyrant of Miletus in Asia Minor, induces the Ionian cities of\n\nAsia Minor to revolt against Persia. The Spartans fail to respond to a request for help but Athens and Eretria (in Euboea) send troops. During the revolt, the proPersian tyrant of Mytilene is stoned to death. 498 BC–446 BC Greek lyric poet Pindar composes odes in honour of athletes, most of them charioteers, at the Olympic, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemean Games in Greece. 496 BC Sophocles, Greek playwright, author of Oedipus Rex, born in Colonus, near Athens (–406 BC). c. 495 BC Pericles, Athenian statesman chiefly responsible for making Athens the centre of Greece and for Athenian democracy, born in Athens, Greece (–429 BC). 494 BC At the end of a military campaign, the plebeian element in the Roman army (those who do not belong to the privileged patrician class) retires to the Sacred Mount outside Rome – the so-called 'Secession of the Plebs' – and threatens to found a new city. The Senate grants concessions, including establishing the Tribunate, an office charged with the protection of plebeian interests. 492 BC The Persian general Mardonius, nephew and son-in-law of King Darius I the Great of Persia, subdues Thrace and Macedon, but the Persians lose part of their fleet on the promontory of Mount Athos (Chalcidice). 490 BC King Darius I of Persia launches an expedition to mainland Greece, seeking revenge on the Athenians and Eretrians who backed the Ionian revolt against Persian rule. The city of Eretria is destroyed and Athens is in danger. The Persians land in the Bay of Marathon, north of Athens, where they meet in battle against the Athenians, supported by the Plataeans. The runner Philippides (or Pheidippides) is sent to Sparta to get help, but the Spartans delay sending troops, and the Greeks under Miltiades the Younger defeat the Persians without their help. The decisive role of the city-state of Athens in this anti-Persian coalition and the Spartans' failure to back the venture will have great ramifications for Greek politics in the 5th century BC. 486 BC Darius I the Great, Achaemenid king of Persia 522–486 several attempts to conquer Greece, dies.\n\nBC,\n\nwho made\n\n486 BC Encouraged by the news of the Greek victory over the Persians at Marathon in 490 BC, the Egyptians revolt against Persian rule after the death of Darius I. 486 BC Xerxes I accedes to the Persian throne following the death of his father, King Darius I the Great of Persia. He is to be a harsher king than his father. His first act is to quell the Egyptian revolt against Persian rule. He never visits Egypt and uses Persian rather than Egyptian administrators. c. 486\n\nBC\n\nThe Romans make a treaty with the tribe of the Hernici, who live in the\n\nTrerus valley southeast of Rome, between the powerful tribes of the Volsci on the coast and the Aequi in the mountains between the Trerus and Anio rivers. This treaty prevents the Hernici being crushed between its two powerful neighbours and gives Rome a buffer state between its enemies. The triple alliance of Rome, the Latins, and the Hernici fights intermittent wars with the Aequi and Volsci for the next century. 484 BC Herodotus, Greek historian, author of an important history of the GrecoPersian wars, born in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (now Bodrum, Turkey) (–c. 425 BC). c. 484 BC Euripides, one the great Athenian tragic dramatists, whose best-known plays include Medea (431 BC) and Electra (418 BC), born (–406 BC). 483 BC King Xerxes of Persia, having crushed the Egyptian revolt, prepares for his great expedition against the Greeks. The plan is for a land army to cross the Bosporus and to skirt round the Thracian and Macedonian coast, with a fleet always in support. He has a canal cut through the promontory of Mount Athos and builds a pontoon (floating bridge) over the Hellespont (Dardanelles) for his invading army to cross. According to Herodotus, it is 3km/2 mi long and consists of 676 ships positioned in two rows. c. 483 BC Gautama Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama), Indian philosopher and founder of Buddhism, dies in Kusinagara, Nepal (c. 80). 8 August 480 BC A small force under King Leonidas of Sparta holds the invading Persian land force at the pass of Thermopylae (leading from Thessaly to Phocis in central Greece), inflicting heavy casualties on them. The Spartans are wiped out but their bravery becomes almost legendary. 9 September 480 BC The Greek city of Athens is besieged and burnt by the Persians, but the Athenians, under general Themistocles and Aristides, who has recently been recalled from exile, destroy the Persian fleet in a naval battle in the Bay of Salamis. The Persian army retires to winter in Thessaly. 480 BC Celts of the Hallstatt culture of upper Austria begin to arrive in Britain in substantial numbers. This is the main period of Celtic immigration, greatly augmenting and changing the balance of Britain's population, and is known as Britain's 'Iron Age' culture. 480 BC–330 BC The Greek classical style of sculpture develops more realism than the preceding Archaic period. Its leading exponents are Phidias (in the 5th century BC), and Praxiteles, Scopas, and Lysippus (in the 4th century BC). 479 BC Confucius (Chinese: K'ung-fu-tzu, or Pinyin: Kongfuzi), celebrated Chinese philosopher and political theorist, dies in Lu, now in Shantung Province, China (c. 72). 479 BC King Xerxes of Persia leaves the conduct of the war in Greece to his general, Mardonius, and the Persians are defeated at the Battle of Plataea. They\n\nare also defeated at sea in the Battle of Mycale, off the coast of Asia Minor, and their ships are destroyed. The task of freeing the Ionian cities from Persian domination begins: the Athenians under the command of Xanthippus proceed to the Hellespont and capture the town of Sestos. 478 BC Hieron succeeds his brother Gelon as tyrant of the Greek city of Syracuse in Sicily. He defeats the Etruscans in their efforts to win the Greek city of Cumae in Italy: this may be said to mark the end of Etruscan power. 477 BC The Delian League, an alliance of Greek states around the Aegean Sea, is formed to continue the fight against the Persians. Although formally all the allies have an equal say, the confederacy is very much under the leadership of Athenian politician Cimon. 476 BC Greek poets Pindar and Bacchylides write odes celebrating the chariot team of Hieron I, tyrant of Syracuse, winning a victory at the Olympics. Four books of Pindar's victory odes survive to modern times, but only fragments of the rest of his work. Some of the works of Bacchylides, written on papyrus, also survive to modern times. c. 475 BC The two-masted sailing ship, with the forward sail being the smaller, is depicted on the wall of an Etruscan tomb. 475 BC–425 BC In the 50 years that follow the end of the Persian Wars, the Greek city-state of Athens reaches the zenith of its greatness. In addition to its empire and political power, creative and intellectual culture flourish. The great tragic playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides are writing, as is the comic playwright Aristophanes. The sculptor Phidias supervises the construction of the frieze on the Parthenon, and the painter Polygnotus decorates the wall of the Stoa (the colonnade in the marketplace) with murals. Athens is now one of the main commercial centres of the eastern Mediterranean. 472 BC The earliest extant play of the Athenian tragedian Aeschylus, Persae/ Persians, describing the Persians at the Battle of Salamis, wins the Athenian tragedy prize. Aeschylus gained firsthand experience of the wars, having fought at the Battle of Marathon and, probably, at the Battle of Salamis. c. 470 made.\n\nBC\n\nOne of the extant bronze statues at Delphi, that of a charioteer, is\n\nc. 470\n\nBC\n\nSocrates, Athenian philosopher, born in Athens (–399\n\nBC).\n\nc. 470 BC The disciples of the Chinese philosopher Confucius reputedly collect and record his teachings, which are ethical rather than religious and centre on the golden rule of doing to others as one would have done to oneself. 468 BC Athenian tragedian Sophocles defeats Aeschylus in the contest for tragedy at the Dionysia festival in Athens. Of Sophocles's 120 plays, only seven survive,\n\nand of those only two can be dated accurately, Philoctetes, dated from 409 BC and Oedipus at Colonos, produced posthumously in 401 BC, both of which win prizes. The remaining five plays are Ajax, probably written in the period 451–444 BC, Antigone and Trachiniae, which are dated after 441 BC, and Electra and Oedipus Tyrannus, probably written in the period 430–415 BC. An eighth play, the satyr-drama Ichneutai/Trackers, survives in fragments. 467 BC The Greek island of Naxos tries to secede from the Delian League but is blockaded and brought into subjection by the Athenian-dominated fleet, a highhanded action resented by the rest of Greece and widely seen as an early attempt by the Athenians to treat the confederacy as their own personal empire. 467 BC–466 BC Athenian statesman Cimon carries the war against Persia into Asia Minor and rallies all the cities of Lycia to the Greek cause by winning the battle of the River Eurymedon. Persia is decisively defeated, though it remains an enemy of the Greeks. 465 BC Xerxes I, king of Persia 486–465 BC, who invaded Greece, is assassinated in Persepolis, Persia, by Artabanus, his uncle and the head of his bodyguard (c. 54). 465 BC–462 BC The Greek city-state of Sparta is unable to help the island of Thasos fight off the Athenians, despite increasing concern at the rise of Athens as an imperial power, as the Spartans have their own troubles at home – they are suffering the effects of a severe earthquake and the ensuing revolt of the helots (serfs) in Messenia. 463 BC–461 BC The democratic statesman Ephialtes, with the support of the statesman Pericles, introduces a package of radical democratic reforms in the Greek city-state of Athens. They reduce the powers of the Council of the Areopagus, transferring them to 'democratic' popular institutions – the Council of Five Hundred, the Assembly, and the popular law courts. The office of judge becomes paid (so that it is no longer the exclusive preserve of the wealthy) and is recruited by lot from a list open to any citizen. 462 BC The Peloponnesian city of Argos, taking advantage of Sparta's preoccupation with its internal problems, finally conquers the city of Mycenae (which seems to have been temporarily independent). The inhabitants are dispersed, some finding their way into Macedon. 461 BC–446 BC Athenian foreign policy, now under the control of the nationalistic statesman Pericles, becomes very aggressive and imperialist. This period sees intermittent war, known as the First Peloponnesian War, between the Athenianled Delian League, edging ever closer to becoming an Athenian Empire, and the Spartan-dominated Peloponnesian League, consisting of the Peloponnesian states of Laconia (Sparta), Messenia, Ellis, and Arcadia, plus Corinth and Megara. 460 BC–457 BC The temple of Zeus is built at Olympia, Greece. The labours of the Greek hero Heracles are illustrated on friezes in the temple.\n\n459 BC The Athenian politician Pericles' first move in his aggressive foreign policy is to try to isolate central Greece and replace Theban control by Athenian occupation. Athens makes strategic alliances with the city-states Argos and Megara, and the region of Thessaly. Corinth and the island of Aegina feel that these actions threaten their sea trade, and declare war on Athens. 458 BC After a great effort, the Greek city-state of Athens is victorious over its Peloponnesian enemies and the Peloponnesian city of Aegina is forced to join the Delian League. 458 BC The Greek city-states of Sparta and Thebes, the capital of Boeotia, declare war on Athens. A Spartan force, going to the help of Boeotia in a local dispute, is nearly cut off by the Athenians on its return. 458 BC The Old Testament Book of Ezra tells how the Babylonian priest and scribe Ezra is sent by King Artaxerxes I of Persia to Jerusalem to restore the neglected Jewish laws of the Pentateuch. He is accompanied by a large number of Jewish exiles and carries valuable gifts for the temple, from both Jews and the Persian king himself. After fasting and prayer, he and a chosen committee blacklist those guilty of mixed marriage. 458 BC The trilogy Oresteia, by the Athenian dramatist Aeschylus, is performed. It comprises Agamemnon, Choephoroi, and Eumenides. 457 BC On returning from their Boeotian expedition, the Spartans are drawn into fighting with the Athenians, the latter being defeated at the ensuing Battle of Tanagra. The Spartans are unable to follow up their victory, however, and withdraw from the area. Athens then advances into Boeotia, which becomes a member of the Delian League. c. 456\n\nBC\n\nAeschylus, first Athenian tragic dramatist, dies in Gela, Sicily (c. 69).\n\n456 BC–454 BC The Athenian-led expedition to Egypt to assist the pharaoh Inaros in his revolt against Persia ends in disaster: the fleet is defeated with heavy losses and the army retreats in disarray. The army retreats across the Sinai Desert to Byblos before its remnants are rescued; Inaros is crucified. 455 BC The first play by the Athenian tragic dramatist Euripides, Daughters of Pelias, comes third at the Dionysia, a competition held in honour of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, in Athens. 453 BC Achaea, on the southern shore of the Corinthian Gulf, is forced to join the Delian League, which is now all but an Athenian Empire. 451 BC Athenian politician Pericles introduces pay for men serving on juries, who are drawn by lot from a panel of 600. Pay for public service is a recent principle in Greece, starting with pay for the office of judge, c. 462 BC. It is strongly criticized by the oligarchs, but is a great aid to poor citizens. The following year it is extended to soldiers, sailors, officials, and members of the council.\n\n451 BC The warring Greek city-states are temporarily exhausted and a five-year truce is arranged between Athens and the Peloponnese. 450 BC Aristophanes, outstanding Greek comic dramatist, 11 of whose plays survive, including The Clouds, The Birds, and The Frogs, born (–c. 388 BC). 450 BC At La Tène (in modern Switzerland), Lake Neuchâtel becomes a site for Celtic votive offerings, and the artistic style of the same name also flourishes at this time. It is an art of curved lines and patterns. The votive offerings often include imported objects from classical cultures. These mark definite progress in Celtic art and have given their name to the Iron Age culture of northwestern Europe of this time. The La Tène culture lasts until the time, some three and a half centuries later, of Germanic interference and then Roman conquest. 45"
