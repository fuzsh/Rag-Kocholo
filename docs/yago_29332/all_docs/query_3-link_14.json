The migration of populations to and from the area crystallised in the 7th century . Their territory remained outside the sphere of Frankish influence although, according to Dzięcioł, there is little surviving historical and archaeological evidence relating to Poland before the second half of the 9th century . The Slavs living in the area produced their own leadership in the 9th century, the Vistulans, Polanians, Mazovians and Pomeranians emerging as the most important tribes in the northern Slavic lands . However, early references to these peoples in primary source documentation are scarce. For example, Einhard's Annales record a council at Frankfurt in 822 attended by legates from \"orientalium Sclavorum, id est Abodritorum, Soraborum, Wiltzorum, Beheimorum, Marvanorum, Prædenecentorum et in Pannonia residentium Avarum\" , which does not appear to include any representatives from the area which was later to become Poland.\n\nThe Vistulan state held extensive territory in southern Poland around Krakow, Tyniec and Wislica. It was eventually overrun by Moravia and its deposed leader was baptised by St Methodius . The Polanian state was formed in the first half of the 9th century in the area where the towns of Gniezno and Poznan were founded, with the Gopleani (in the Goplo region) and the Lendizi developing as its two political entities . After Moravia was overrun by the Hungarians in 906, the Polanians extended their authority over parts of the former Vistulan state . The Popiel family, ruling dynasty of the Gopleani, were replaced by the house of Piast who came from the Gniezno region and were of native peasant origin . The Chronicæ Polanorum records \"in civitate Gneznensi dux nomine Popel\" who had two sons . Dzięcioł dismisses the theory, prevalent among 19th century Polish historians, that the Piast family were of Norman origin . The dynasty failed to extend its control to western Pomerania which had developed autonomously to the north-west, but its authority was accepted by eastern or Vistulan Pomerania, centred on Gdansk . After Bohemia conquered Krakow and Silesia following the defeat of the Hungarians by Otto I King of Germany at Lechfeld in 955, the Polanian state absorbed the region of Sandomierz and land on the upper Bug and upper Dniester rivers .\n\nPoland, composed of all these areas and united under its Piast rulers, emerged as a stable political entity in the second half of the 10th century. The conversion of Poland to Christianity in 966 reinforced the unity of the new nation state.\n\nBefore Bolesław III Prince of Poland died in 1138, he arranged a division of his lands between his five surviving sons, which marked the dissolution of the centralised Polish state which was to persist until the early 14th century. Poland was reunited when Władysław Prince of Kujavia reasserted control over all the Polish territories, with the exception of Silesia, and was crowned king of Poland as Władysław I in 1320.\n\nChapter 1. PRINCES & KINGS OF POLAND (PIAST)\n\nA. ORIGINS, PRINCES OF POLAND 966-1024\n\nPIAST, son of CHOSTCONIS & his wife [Repka ---]. The Annales Polanorum state that \"Chosiscko genuit Peast\" . The Chronicæ Polanorum add his mother's name, stating \"hospitii domestici Pazt filius Chostconis et uxor eius Repca\" but, as stated below, this contradicts the Annales Polanorum which state that Repka was Piast's wife . Dzieciol highlights a \"plausible theory\" that Piast was maior domus in the palace of the Popiel rulers before seizing power, although there is no evidence of this in the chronicles .\n\nm [REPKA], daughter of ---. According to the Annales Polanorum, which state that \"Peast genuit Semovith de domna Repeka\", Repka was the wife of Piast . The Chronica principum Polonie records that \"Kosiskonis filius Past\" married \"mulier quedam Repisa\" . The Chronicæ Polanorum, on the other hand, suggests that she was Piast's mother, referring to \"hospitii domestici Pazt filius Chostconis et uxor eius Repca\" .\n\nPiast & his wife had one child:\n\n1. ZIEMOWIT (-[892]). The Annales Polanorum state that \"Peast genuit Semovith de domna Repeka\" . The Chronica principum Polonie names \"Symovith\" as son of \"Kosiskonis filius Past\" and his wife \"mulier quedam Repisa\" . The Chronicæ Polanorum names \"Semovith filius Pazt Chossistcomis\" . He overthrew the house of Popiel, previous rulers of Polania, and became ruler of the Polanian state whose borders he extended . m ---. The name of Ziemowit's wife is not known. Ziemowit & his wife had one child:\n\na) LESZEK (-[921]). The Annales Polanorum state that \"Semovith genuit Lisekonem\" . The Chronicæ Polanorum names \"Lestik filius Semovith\", specifying that he succeeded his father . He succeeded his father in [892] as ruler of the Polanians, until 913 . m ---. The name of Leszek's wife is not known. Leszek & his wife had one child:\n\ni)ZIEMOMYSŁ (-before 963). The Annales Polanorum state that \"Listko genuit Semomil\", specifying in an earlier passage dated 915 that he ruled \"in regnum Polonie\" after Leszek . The Chronicæ Polanorum names \"Semimizl filius Lestik\", specifying that he succeeded his father . He succeeded his father in [921] as ruler of the Polanians . Emperor Constantine recorded the existence in [950] of a \"White Croat state under its own pagan prince who recognised the authority of Emperor Otto I\" . m [firstly] GORKA, daughter of ---. The primary source which confirms her marriage has not yet been identified. [m secondly ---. No direct evidence of this supposed second marriage has yet been found. However, as noted below, if it is correct that Adelajda, wife of Geza Prince of Hungary, was the sister of Prince Mieszko, her estimated birth date range indicates the probability that she was born from a later marriage.] Ziemomysl & [his wife] had [four] children:\n\n(a) MIESZKO ([920/30]-25 May 992) . The Chronicæ Polanorum names \"Meschonem\" as son of \"Semimizl\", specifying that he was first called by another name (not specified) and was blind for seven years from birth . He is cited in 963 as MIESZKO I Prince of Poland.\n\n- see below.\n\n(b) son (-killed in battle 963). Widukind of Corvey records that \"Misacam regem fratrem\" was killed in the battles against \"the Slavs\" led by Wichmann in 963 .\n\n(c) CZCIBOR [Cidibur] (-after 24 Jun 972). Thietmar names \"Mieszko's brother Cidibur\" when recording that he fought Hodo Markgraf der Ostmark at the battle of Zehden , dated to 24 Jun 972.\n\n(d) [ADELAJDA [Adleta] ([950/60]-after 997) . The Annales Kamenzenses record that \"Mesco rex Polanorum sororem Atleydem\" married \"Iesse rex Ungarie\" by whom she was mother of \"Stephanum regem Ungarie\" . The Breve chronicon Silesiæ names \"Adilheidem\" as sister of \"primo dux Mesco\", adding that she married \"Jesse rex Ungarie\" and that she was the mother of \"Stephanum regem Ungarie\" born in 975 . The Kronika Węgiersko-Polska records that \"Iesse\" married \"sororem Meschonis ducis Athleitam\", adding that she was a Christian and converted her husband to Christianity . The primary source which confirms her first marriage has not yet been identified. According to Europäische Stammtafeln , Adelajda was the daughter not sister of Mieszko I Prince of Poland, although the primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified. If this is correct, she was an otherwise unrecorded daughter by his first wife (name not known), assuming that Prince Mieszko's marriage to Dobroslawa of Bohemia is correctly dated to 965. Adelajda's birth date range is estimated from the supposed dates of birth of her two sons by her first husband (before his death in [976/78]) and of her three known daughters by her second marriage after [985]. The date range appears chronologically more consistent with her having been the daughter, rather than sister, of Mieszko, but this would be in direct contradiction to the sources quoted above. If she was Mieszko's sister, it is likely that they did not share the same mother, assuming that the estimated birth dates of Mieszko and Adelajda are both accurate. It is probable that her second marriage was arranged in accordance with the Magyar tradition that the oldest male relative should marry the widow of a deceased relative (originally polygamously) and take care of his children. m firstly ([970/75]) MIHÁLY Prince of Hungary Duke between March and Gran, son of TAKSONY Prince of Hungary & his wife --- [Kuman Princess] (-[976/78]). m secondly ([985]) as his second wife, GEZA Prince of Hungary, son of TAKSONY Prince of Hungary & his wife --- [Kuman Princess] ([940/45]-1 Feb 997).]\n\nMIESZKO of Poland, son of ZIEMOMYSŁ of Poland & his wife [Gorka ---] ([920/30]-25 May 992 ) . The Chronicæ Polanorum names \"Meschonem\" as son of \"Semimizl\", specifying that he was first called by another name (not specified) and was blind for seven years from birth . The Annales Polanorum state that \"Semomislaus genuit Miscko cecum\" in 920, and in 931 state that \"Mesko dux mirabiliter illuminator\" . Dzieciol says that the traditional view of Polish historians is that Mieszko was aged about 70 when he died . However, this appears old in light of the dates of his two known marriages and the dates of birth of his known children. He is cited in 963 as MIESZKO I Prince of Poland by the chronicler Widukind of Corvey who records his defeat in two battles by \"the Slavs\" led by Wichman . In 965, Prince Mieszko formed an alliance with Boleslav I Duke of Bohemia, confirmed by his marriage to the latter's daughter, the new queen influencing her husband's baptism at Easter 966 and being instrumental in the start of Poland's conversion to Christianity . In 967, Pope John XIII established a missionary bishopric at Poznan under Bishop Jordan . According to Thietmar of Merseburg, Gero Markgraf von Ostmark obliged Prince Mieszko to pay tribute to Emperor Otto I \"der Große\" . While it is unclear whether any relationship of vassalage to the empire resulted, after his conversion Mieszko was referred to as \"amicum imperatoris\" . Widukind records that \"Misacam\" and his Bohemian allies defeated the western Pomeranians in 967 and killed their leader Wichman . Thietmar records that Prince Mieszko was attacked by Hodo Markgraf der Ostmark but defeated him at Zehden [Cydyna] 24 Jun 972 . The dispute was mediated in Quedlinburg in 973 by Emperor Otto. Prince Mieszko left his son Bolesław at the German court as a hostage, but placed him under the protection of the Holy See by sending a lock of his son's hair to the Pope . Better relations with Germany appear to have been restored by Prince Mieszko's third marriage . This probably gave the necessary diplomatic backing to Mieszko's conquest of Krakow and Silesia from the Bohemians towards the end of his reign . The Russian Primary Chronicle records that in 981 Vladimir Grand Prince of Kiev invaded Polish territory and conquered Czerwień, \"Peremyshl\" and other cities . In [990], Prince Mieszko donated his whole country to the papacy, signalling an assertion of his autonomy from the empire (at that time still controlled by the regent Empress Theophano) while at the same time affirming papal pre-eminence . \"Dagome iudex et Ote senatrix et filii eorum Misica et Lambertus\" donated \"civitatem Schinesghe\" to the papacy by charter dated to [Aug 995/25 May 992] . Thietmar describes Mieszko as \"senex\" at his death .\n\n[m firstly ---. The Chronica principum Polonie records that \"Mesico\" had seven wives whom he repudiated before marrying \"christianisimam mulierem de Bohemia, Dubraucam\" in 966 , which suggests that they were polygamous marriages. While this is probably an exaggeration to contrast his previous pagan ways with his post-baptismal way of life, it does seem probable that Mieszko married earlier than 965 especially if he was born in the earlier part of the estimated birth date range shown above. Dzięcioł suggests that there is no evidence of any children born from an earlier marriage , unless one of them was Adelajda who is recorded elsewhere as Mieszko's sister (as discussed above). However, in line with Hlawitschkas suggestion about the identity of Burislaw Prince of the Wends, discussed below, Burislaws supposed children may in fact have been children of Mieszko, the chronology suggesting that one of his earlier wives was their mother. The Scandinavian names of the children suggest that their mother(s) may have been of Scandinavian/Norse origin.]\n\nm [eighthly] ([965/66]) DOBRAVA [Dobroslawa] of Bohemia, daughter of BOLESLAV I \"der Grausame\" Duke of the Bohemians & his wife Biagota --- ([940/45]-977). The Annales Kamenzenses record that \"Mesco rex Polanorum\" married \"Danbrovcam filiam ducis Boemie\" in 965 . The Chronica principum Polonie records that \"Mesico\" married \"christianisimam mulierem de Bohemia, Dubraucam\" in 966 and converted to Christianity . Thietmar names \"the sister of Boleslav the Elder Dobrawa\" as the wife of Mieszko of Poland . The Chronicæ Polanorum names \"unam christianissimam de Bohemia Dubrovcam nomine\" as wife of \"Meschonem\" . Bearing in mind that Dobrawa gave birth to [four] children, it is unlikely that she was born much earlier than [940/45]. Her marriage was arranged to confirm the alliance between her father and her prospective husband. After her arrival in Poland, she converted Prince Mieszko to Christianity and was instrumental in the conversion of the whole country in 966 . The Chronica Boemorum records the death in 977 of \"Dubrauca\" wife of \"Poloniensi duci\" .\n\nm [ninthly] ([978/79]) ODA [von Haldensleben], daughter of DIETRICH Markgraf über den Gau der Heveller [Nordmark] & his wife --- (-1023). Thietmar records Mieszko's marriage to \"Markgraf Dietrich's daughter Oda\", specifying that she was a nun at the convent of Calbe and married \"without the approval of the church\" . Thietmar records that, after her husband's death, her stepson expelled her and her children from Poland .\n\nPrince Mieszko & his [first/seventh] wife/wives had children (as noted below, Snorre records Gyda and Astrid as children of Burislaw Prince of the Wends. As discussed further in the document MECKLENBURG, Hlawitschka, in his analysis of the wives of Erik King of Sweden and Svend King of Denmark, suggests that Burislaw/Burizleif was the same person as Bolesław I \"Chrobry/the Brave\" Prince of Poland . If Hlawitschka is correct, the chronology suggests that the daughters of Burislaw would have been Bolesławs sisters, the dates of their marriages suggesting that they would have been from Mieszkos children by her [first/seventh] wives.):\n\n1. [GYDA [Geira] (-984) . Snorre names \"Geira, Gunhild and Astrid\" as the three daughters of \"in Vindland a king called Burizleif\", recording that Geira was queen in the part of the country in which Olav landed when returning from Garderike. He records that that they married in 982 and that Olav stayed in Vindland to rule jointly with his wife . Snorre records that Geira died after Olav Trygveson had been in Vindland for three years . m ([982]) as his first wife, OLAV Trygveson, son of TRYGVE Olavsson [Norway] & his wife Åstrid Eiriksdatter (posthumously [968] -drowned Øresund o. b. Svold, near Rügen 9 Sep [1000]). He imposed himself as OLAV I King of Norway in [995].]\n\n2. [ASTRID . Snorre names \"Geira, Gunhild and Astrid\" as the three daughters of \"in Vindland a king called Burizleif\" . Snorre names \"Astrid, a daughter of King Burizleif\" as the wife of Sigvalde . m SIGVALDI, son of STRUTHARALD King in Skåne & his wife ---. Jarl at Jomsborg: Saxo Grammaticus names Bo, Ulff, Karlshefni, Siualdus among the knights at Jomsborg .]\n\n3. [TOVE (-[990]) . Her marriage and parentage are confirmed by a Runic stone at Sönder Vissing, Denmark which records that \"Tufa let gera [make] kuml [monument], Mistiuis do´tter,ept [daughter] Mo´thur [mother] sina.Kona [queen] Haralds hins Goda,Gorms sonar\" . Europäische Stammtafeln identifies her as Tove, daughter of Mstivoj the Wendish prince . The name of Tove´s father, \"Mistiuis\", on the Runic stone bears some similarity to Mstivoj. However, one difficulty is the apparent chronological discrepancy. The only other reference to Mstivoj is dated to 1000 and gives no idea about his age at the time. Nor is there any indication of the date of Tove´s marriage, although it appears unlikely that she married much later than 980 considering the date her husband died. This would place her birth in [960] which, in turn, would mean that Mstivoj would have been over 60 years old when he is mentioned in 1000, not impossible but maybe surprising. Another possibility is that she was the daughter of Mieszko I Prince of Poland, presumably by one of his early wives. The name \"Mieszko\" is just as similar to \"Mistiuis\" as \"Mstivoj\". If this hypothesis is correct, Tove could have been the sister of the first wife of King Harald´s son, King Svend, implying a father/son double marriage with two sisters. m as his second wife, HARALD I\"Blåtand/Bluetooth\" King of Denmark, son of GORM \"den Gamle/the Old\" King of Denmark & his wife Tyre \"Danebod\" (before 935-Jomsborg 1 Dec [986/87], bur Roskilde Cathedral).]\n\nPrince Mieszko & his [first/seventh wife/wives or eighth wife] had one child:\n\n4. SIGRID [Syritha] [Czcirada/Czirada/więtosława] [Storråda/the Haughty] (-[after Summer 1015]) . Thietmar refers to the mother of \"filiis Suenni\" as \"Miseconis filia ducis, soror Bolizlavi successoris eius et nati [=cognati?, [eius?] referring to Svend?]\", commenting that a viro suimet [=Svend] diu depulsa non minimam cum cæteris perpessa est controversiam (\"long exiled by her husband this woman suffered no small amount of controversy\") [suggesting her repudiation, as discussed further below] . As these events occurred only about 15/20 years before Thietmar was writing (in [1012/18?]), his report is probably as reliable as could be expected. Adam of Bremen (writing [1075/85]) broadly reflects the same information, recording the marriage of King Svend and \"Herici relictam, matrem Olaph\" , another manuscript stating that \"Hericus rex Sueonum\" had made a treaty with rege Polanorum Bolizlao·and that Bolizlaus gave filiam vel sororem to Herico . Her two marriages are further confirmed by Adam who records that [her son by her first marriage] Olof King of Sweden (Olaph sane, qui post obitum patris Herici regnum super Suevos accepit) invaded Denmark, expelled infelicem Suein a regno and conquered the kingdom (et ipse optinuit Daniam), but that Olof restored Svend in regnum suum, eo quod matrem suam habuerit\" . Neither Thietmar nor Adam name the Polish kings daughter. Saxo Grammaticus (writing about a century after Adam) confirms her name (but not her family origin) and two marriages, noting that King Svend married \"Syritha Suetiam\" after she was unsuccessfully wooed by Olav I King of Norway, and naming Olof King of Sweden as King Svend's stepson . Morkinskinna confirms Saxo by naming \"Sigridr en stórráda\" as mother of the lady Ástrídr sister of two kings, Knútr the Great and Óláfr the Swede who married Jarl Úlfr sprakaleggr . The name Sigrid/Syritha could of course be a Norse/German adaptation of a Polish name. Hlawitschka analyses secondary sources which discuss Sigrids Polish origin, including those which propose alternative Polish names Czcirada/Czirada or więtosława . The question of her name is complicated by Snorre who names \"Geira, Gunhild and Astrid\" as the three daughters of \"in Vindland a king called Burizleif\" , and in a later passage records Gunhild's marriage to King Svend . In another passage, Snorre complicates matters further by recording that the Danish king Svein Tjuguskeg was married to Gunhild, a daughter of Burizleif king of the Vinds but that Queen Gunhild fell sick and died, and that soon afterwards the king married Sigrid the Haughty, a daughter of Skoglartoste, and mother of the Swedish king Olaf . As noted above, Hlawitschka, in his analysis of the wives of Erik King of Sweden and Svend King of Denmark, suggests that Burislaw/Burizleif was the same person as Bolesław I \"Chrobry/the Brave\" Prince of Poland . The question of the daughter of Skoglar Toste is discussed above under Svends first wife in the document DENMARK KINGS. Thietmars reference to Svend repudiating his second wife appears corroborated by Saxo Grammaticus who records that, after his father's death, Olof returned to Sweden [from Denmark] with \"his mother Syritha, and stayed there exercising his sovereignty under his mother's tutelage\" (Erici filius Olavus cum matre Syritha Suetiam repetivit, ibique degens regnum materno arbitrio subiectum habuit) . This passage suggests that Olof arrived in Denmark with his mother on her second marriage and returned to Sweden with her (presumably after Svend repudiated her), when he was still a minor. At some point, Sigrid presumably left Scandinavia and returned to her native homeland as the Encomium Emmæ Reginæ records that \"Cnuto\" [and his brother?] visited Sclavoniam in [Summer] 1015 and brought back matrem suam, quæ illuc morabatur [who was staying there] . The date of Sigrids death is not known. Sigrid of Poland was studied by Rafal T. Prinke (his article has not been studied in detail as it is in the Polish language) . m firstly ([985?]) [as his second wife,] ERIK Segersäll/the Victorious King of Sweden, son of [OLOF Erikson of Sweden] & his wife --- (-Uppsala [994/95]). m secondly ([995?], [repudiated]) as his second wife, SVEND I \"Tveskæg/Forkbeard\"King of Denmark, son of HARALD I \"Blåtand/Bluetooth\" King of Denmark & his first wife Gunhild --- ([960]-Gainsborough 3 Feb 1014, bur in England, later removed to Roskilde).]\n\nPrince Mieszko & his [eighth] wife had [two] children:\n\n5. BOLESŁAW ([967]-17 Jun 1025) . The Chronicæ Polanorum names \"Boleslavum\" as son of \"Meschonem [et] Dubrovcam\" . He succeeded his father in 992 as BOLESŁAW I \"Chrobry/the Brave\" Prince of Poland.\n\n- see below.\n\n6.WLADIWOY (-[Jan/Mar] 1003) . The primary source which confirms his parentage has not yet been identified. Thietmar records that the Bohemians \"secretly called Wlodowej from Poland\" after Duke Boleslav was deposed and that he \"was unanimously elected in his place because of his consanguinity\" . He succeeded in 1002 as VLADIVOY Duke of the Bohemians.\n\nPrince Mieszko & his [ninth] wife had three children:\n\n7.MIESZKO (after 979-). Thietmar names (in order) \"Miesco, Swentepulk & ---\" as the sons of Prince Mieszko and his wife Oda, recording that the brothers were expelled from Poland with their mother after their father's death by their half-brother Prince Bolesław . \"Dagome iudex et Ote senatrix et filii eorum Misica et Lambertus\" donated \"civitatem Schinesghe\" to the papacy by charter dated to [Aug 995/25 May 992] . m (after 25 May 992) ---. The name of Mieszko's wife is not known. Mieszko & his wife had one child:\n\na) DYTRYK (-after 7 Jul 1032). He is shown in Europäische Stammtafeln as the son of Mieszko but the primary source on which this is based has not been identified.\n\n8. WIĘTOPOŁK (after 980-after 25 May 992 Thietmar names (in order) \"Miesco, Swentepulk & ---\" as the sons of Prince Mieszko and his wife Oda, recording that the brothers were expelled from Poland with their mother after their father's death by their half-brother Prince Bolesław .\n\n9. LAMBERT (after 981-after 25 May 992). Thietmar names (in order) \"Miesco, Swentepulk & ---\" as the sons of Prince Mieszko and his wife Oda, recording that the brothers were expelled from Poland with their mother after their father's death by their half-brother Prince Bolesław . His name is confirmed by the charter dated to [Aug 995/25 May 992] under which \"Dagome iudex et Ote senatrix et filii eorum Misica et Lambertus\" donated \"civitatem Schinesghe\" to the papacy .\n\nB. KINGS OF POLAND 1024-1370\n\nBOLESŁAW of Poland, son of MIESZKO I Prince of Poland & his [eighth] wife Dobrava [Dobroslawa] of Bohemia ([967]-17 Jun 1025) . The Chronicæ Polanorum names \"Boleslavum\" as son of \"Meschonem [et] Dubrovcam\" . The Annales Kamenzenses name \"Bolezlaum Magnum\" as son of \"Mesco rex Polanorum\" and his wife \"Danbrovcam filiam ducis Boemie\", born in 967 . The Annales Polanorum date the birth of \"Boleslaus Chabri\" in 967 . His father left him as a hostage at the German court after the Quedlinburg mediation of 973 following Prince Mieszko's defeat of Hodo Markgraf der Ostmark . He succeeded his father in 992 as BOLESŁAW I \"Chrobry/the Brave\" Prince of Poland. On his accession, he expelled his stepmother and half-brothers from Poland . He offered safe passage through Poland for St Adalbert, expelled as Bishop of Prague, who entered Prussia to convert the pagans. After Adalbert's martyrdom in Apr 997, Bolesław ransomed his body for its weight in gold and buried it in Gniezno cathedral . In 1000, Emperor Otto III visited Gniezno, recognised Polish independence, and established the archbishopric of Gniezno as an independent church metropolis covering the whole of Poland, on the authority of a special bull issued by Pope Sylvester II . After the election in 1002 of Heinrich II as King of Germany, a group of German nobles tried to assassinate Prince Bolesław , triggering the Polish-German war which lasted until 1016. During the course of this, Bolesław occupied Meissen, was invited into Prague by the population, deposed Boleslav III Duke of Bohemia, and installed his brother as duke in his place. After his brother died, Bolesław assumed the position of duke of Bohemia himself until 1004 when he was driven out of Bohemia by Heinrich II King of Germany . He captured Lausitz in 1007, confirmed in peace meetings at Merseburg in 1013 and Bautzen in 1018 . After the Polish-Russian war of 1013, peace was confirmed by the marriage of Duke Bolesław's daughter to the Grand Prince of Kiev, and in [1017] Prince Bolesław asked for the hand in marriage of the daughter of Grand Prince Vladimir, wishing to strengthen the bond between Poland and Russia, but this was refused . He helped restore his son-in-law in Kiev in Jul/Aug 1018, forcing the temporary retreat of Iaroslav Vladimirovich to Novgorod . After the death in 1024 of Emperor Heinrich II, with whom Prince Bolesław had always had poor relations, Pope John XIX agreed to grant Bolesław a royal crown and he was crowned King of Poland in 1024. The necrology of Lüneburg records the death \"17 Jun\" of \"Bolizlauus dux\" . The Breve chronicon Silesiæ records the death in 1025 of \"Bolezlaus magnus\" .\n\nThere is some uncertainty about the order and number of his wives:\n\nm firstly ([984], divorced [985/86]) --- [von Meissen], daughter of RICDAG Markgraf [von Meissen] & his wife ---. The Annales Kamenzenses record the marriage of \"Bolezlaus Magnus\" in 984, presumably referring to his first marriage, but do not name his wife . Thietmar records that Boleslaw married \"the daughter of Markgraf Rikdag but later sent her away\" .\n\nm secondly (end 985, divorced [986/87]) [--- of Hungary, daughter of GÉZA Prince of Hungary & his first wife Sarolt of Transylvania]. Thietmar records that Boleslaw married \"a Hungarian woman\" after repudiating his first wife but \"also sent her away\" . The primary source which confirms her parentage has not so far been identified, but it is chronologically plausible for her to have been the daughter of Prince Géza. This marriage probably ended because of the deterioration in political relations between Poland and Hungary .\n\n[m [thirdly] ([987], divorced) as her second husband, TYRE Haraldsdatter of Denmark, widow of STYRBJÖRN[Björn] den Starke/the Strong\" of Sweden, daughter of HARALD I \"Blåtand/Bluetooth\" King of Denmark & his [first wife Gunhild ---] (-18 Sep [1000]). The primary source which confirms her first marriage has not been identified. The Historia Norwegie, when recording her third marriage, says that \"sororem Sweinonis regis Tyri\" had earlier been betrothed to \"dux quidam de Sclauia\" . Saxo Grammaticus records that Erik King of Denmark deposed her first husband, dated to [984/85] . The following source suggests that Erik received Polish help at the time: one manuscript of Adam of Bremen records that \"Hericus rex Sueonum\" made a treaty with rege Polanorum Bolizlao and that Bolizlaus gave filiam vel sororem to Herico . It is therefore not a great leap to assume that, at the same time, the marriage was arranged between Bolesław of Poland and the widow of Eriks predecessor. A variation on this theme is provided by Snorre, who records Sigvalde...earl over Jomsborg in Vindland capturing Svend King of Denmark (soon after he deposed his father) and taking him to Vindland, to Jomsborg, where he forced him to make peace with Burizleif, the king of the Vinds, the arrangement including Svends marriage to Gunhild, King Burizleifs daughter and the marriage of King Burizleif to Thyre, a daughter of Harald, and King Sveins sister . If Snorre is correct, Tyres second husband was Burislaw Prince of the Wends. Follow his hyperlink for a discussion of Hlawitschkas hypothesis that Burislaw/Burizleif of the Wends never existed and was in fact Bolesław of Poland . She married thirdly (Tønsberg 998) as his third wife, Olav ITrygveson King of Norway: in a later passage, Snorre records Tyre's flight to Norway from her second husband and her subsequent marriage to King Olav . The Historia Norwegie records the marriage of King Olav and \"sororem Sweinonis regis Tyri\" . Adam of Bremen records the marriage of \"Olaph Trucconis filius\" and \"a Dania superbissimam Thore\" soon after he returned to Norway after exile in England . Adam of Bremen records that, after the death of her husband, his wife starved herself to death .]\n\n[m fourthly ([987/92]) HODICA, daughter of BILLUG Prince of the Obotrites & his wife ---. Helmold names \"Hodicam\" as the daughter of \"regulus Obotritorum Billug\" and his wife, recording that her maternal uncle installed her as abbess of Mecklenburg . Helmold records in a later passage that \"Missizlaus, Obotritorum princeps sororem suam Hodicam\" was removed from her monastery to marry Bolesław of Poland, while many other nuns were sent \"in terram Wilzorum sive Ranorum\" and the monastery dissolved .
