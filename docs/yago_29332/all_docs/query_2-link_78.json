Maubergeron/Dangerosse. Willi am IX of Aquitaine (October 22, 1071  February 10, 1126, also known as Gu illaume or Guilhem d'Aquitaine), surnamed \"the Troubadour\" was Duke of Aqu itaine and Gascony and Count of Poitiers as William VII of Poitiers betwe en 1086 and 1126. He was also one of the leaders of the crusade of 1101 a nd one of the first vernacular poets and troubadours. His Occitan names were Guilhèm IX duc d'Aquitània e de Gasconha and Guilh èm VII comte de Peitieus. William was the son of William VIII of Aquitaine by his third wife Hildega rde of Burgundy. His birth was an event of great celebration, but at fir st he was considered illegitimate by religious authorities because of h is father's earlier divorces and his parents' consanguinity. This oblig ed his father to make a pilgrimage to Rome soon after his birth, whe re he sought and received papal approval of his marriage and children. In 1089, he married Ermengarde of Anjou (d 1146, daughter of Fulk IV, Cou nt of Anjou); they divorced by 1090. In 1094 he married Philippa of Toulouse, the daughter and heiress of Willi am IV of Toulouse. By Philippa, William had two sons and five daughters. He was excommunicated twice, the first time in 1114 for some unknown offen se, a favourite weapon of popes of the time to enforce their power. His re sponse to this was to demand absolution from the Bishop of Poitiers at swo rdpoint, thus demonstrating his own power! He was excommunicated the seco nd time for carrying off Dangereuse (Dangerosa in Occitan), the wife of h is vassal Aimery I de Rochefoucauld, Viscount of Châtellerault. He install ed her in the Maubergeonne tower of his castle, and, as related by Willi am of Malmesbury, even painted a picture of her on his shield. This greatly offended both his wife and his son, William. According to Ord eric Vitalis, Philippa protested her treatment in October 1119 at the Coun cil of Reims, claiming to have been abandoned by the duke in favor of Dang ereuse. She later retired to the convent of Fontevrault. Relations with h is son were only repaired when the younger William married Ænor of Châtell erault, Dangereuse's daughter by her husband. His 13th century Provençal biographer remembers him in this way: \"[William IX] was one of the most courtly men in the world and one of t he greatest deceivers of women. He was a fine knight at arms, liberal in h is attentions to ladies, and a fine composer and singer of songs.\" William invited Pope Urban II to spend Christmas 1095 at his court. The po pe urged him to take the cross and leave for the Holy Land, but William w as more interested in exploiting the absence of Raymond IV of Toulouse, h is wife's uncle, to press a claim to Toulouse. He and Philippa did captu re Toulouse in 1098, an act for which they were threatened with excommunic ation. Partly out of a desire to regain favor with the religious authoriti es and partly out of a wish to see the world, William joined the First Cru sade in 1099. He arrived in the Holy land in 1101 and stayed there until the following y ear. His record as a general is not very impressive. William fought most ly skirmishes in Anatolia and was frequently defeated. His recklessness h ad his army ambushed on several occasions, with great losses to his own si de. In September 1101 his entire army was destroyed by the Turks at Heracl ea; William himself barely escaped with a few survivors. Later on in his life, William joined forces with the kingdoms of Castile ( an old ally) and Léon. Between 1120 and 1123, Aquitanian troops fought si de by side with queen Urraca of Castile, in an effort to conquer the Moo rs of Cordoba and complete the Reconquista. During his sojourn in Spain, W illiam was given a rock crystal vase by a Muslim ally that he later bequea thed to his granddaughter Eleanor. The vase probably originated in Sassan id Persia in the 7th century. William IX also provided troops to Philip I of France in his war against W illiam the Conqueror. William's greatest legacy to history was not as a warrior but as a poe t. He was he was the first known troubadour, or lyric poet employing the R omance vernacular called Provencal, or Occitan. Eleven of his songs have s urvived into the 21st century (Merwin, 2002). They are attributed to him u nder his title as Count of Poitou (lo coms de Peitieus). He was one of t he most important troubadours. The topics varied, treating sex, love, wome n, his own sexual prowess, and feudal politics. His brashness, wit, and te mper caused scandal and won admiration at the same time. He stands as t he first surviving troubadour, and one of the first Romance vernacular poe ts of theMiddle Ages, a cultural phenomenon that would culminate in Dant e, Boccaccio, and Villon. Ezra Pound mentions him in Canto VIII: And Poictiers, you know, Guillaume Poictiers, had brought the song up out of Spain with the singers and viels... William was a man that loved scandal and no doubt enjoyed shocking his aud iences. Upon returning from crusade, he abandoned his wife in favo ur of a married woman, known as Dangereuse (Dangerosa in Occitan) from h is poems, and risked excommunication for the deed. He also composed a so ng about founding a convent in his lands, where the nuns would be picked f rom among the most beautiful women in the region, or from the best whore s, depending on the translation. While this confirms William's lusty perso na, it also makes a joke about the penitentiary convents for prostitutes f ounded by the charismatic preacher Robert of Arbrissel. (Bond, xlix) In fa ct, William granted large donations to the church, perhaps to regain the p ope's favour. He also constructed the palace of Poitou, later add ed to by his granddaughter Eleanor of Aquitaine. It survives to this d ay in the city of Poitiers. One of William's poems, possibly written at the time of his first excommun ication, since it implies his son was still a minor, is partly a musi ng on mortality: Pos de chantar m'es pres talenz (Since I have the desi re to sing,/I'll write a verse for which I'll grieve). It concludes: I have given up all I loved so much: chivalry and pride; and since it pleases God, I accept it all, that He may keep me by Him. I enjoin my friends, upon my death, all to come and do me great honour, since I have held joy and delight far and near, and in my abode. Thus I give up joy and delight, and squirrel and grey and sable furs. He died on February 10th, 1126, age 55.\n\nchild 1 - Agnes\\Matilda of Poitiers -\n\nAncestors:\n\n| Paternal Grandfather - name not known -\n\n| Father - name not known -\n\n| | Paternal Grandmother - name not known -\n\n|\n\nAmauberge \"Dangereuse\"\n\n|\n\n| | Maternal Grandfather - name not known -\n\n| Mother - name not known -\n\n| Maternal Grandmother - name not known -\n\nreturn to top of surname index return to top of names list return to \"Dangereuse\" in names list return to Welcome\n\nInformation Page for Geoffrey II \"Ferreol\"\n\nAlso known as Count of Gâtinais /Geoffrey\n\nGender: M\n\nBorn: c 1000 at Chateau Landon, Seine Et marne, France\n\nDied: 1 Apr 1046 at Anjou Data Source OneWorldTreeSM\n\nNotes - Geoffrey II Ferreol, Comte de Gatinois, Count de Chateau-Landon is also kn own as Geoffrey de Gatinois, Comte de Gatinois de Chateau-Landon.
