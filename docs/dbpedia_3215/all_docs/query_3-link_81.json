        "text": "Harriet Anderson Langford\n\nHarriet Anderson Langford is the Founder and President of The Ray and a Trustee of the Ray C. Anderson Foundation.\n\nIn 2014, Harriet secured a memorial highway designation on I-85 in memory of her late father and corporate sustainability pioneer, Ray Anderson. She quickly realized the incompatibility of “the greenest CEO’s” name on a highway – a disproportionate contributor to global carbon pollution. In righting that wrong, Harriet founded The Ray which she spearheads towards the goal of a zero carbon, zero waste, and zero death highway.\n\nPrior to founding The Ray, Harriet spent over 30 years serving in numerous nonprofit leadership roles in her local community. She is a past board member of the Georgia Conservancy and Sustainable Atlanta and a past member of the Troup County Strategic Planning Committee. Harriet also serves on the board of the Biophilic Institute. In addition to her roles in the nonprofit world, Harriet owned a specialty printing business in her hometown of LaGrange, Georgia.\n\nLike her father before her, Harriet feels passionately about sharing her experience and has taken the main stage at conferences like Verge and has given a TEDx talk. In 2018 Harriet received the Red Cross “Hometown Hero Award” in recognition of her lifelong efforts in her community.\n\nPhil Langford\n\nPhil Langford is a trustee of The Ray and the Ray C.

When Phil is not working on Foundation projects, he enjoys playing with the grandchildren, reading, golf and fishing.\n\nJohn Picard\n\nJohn Picard is Vice President of The Ray and an Advisory Board Member for the Ray C. Anderson Foundation.\n\nJohn understood the “internet of things” long before connectivity became the driver that it is today. Celebrated for his keen understanding of the innovative principles of natural systems designs, John connects visionary thinking with emerging technologies to drive successful projects for corporations, commercial buildings, college campuses, and even entire towns.\n\nOne of John’s most personal and profound experiences was with Interface, Inc., the company founded by Ray Anderson, who was inspired in 1994 by John’s sea-changing question, “what is Interface doing for the environment?” John was an integral part of the team that helped the petroleum-dependent company imagine a future without oil and chart a course towards it, and he was recruited to join the Ray C. Anderson Foundation in 2011.\n\nAlan Anderson\n\nAlan Anderson is Treasurer of The Ray and an Advisory Board Member for the Ray C.
