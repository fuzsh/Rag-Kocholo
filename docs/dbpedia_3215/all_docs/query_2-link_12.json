        "text": "Station Park\n\nStation Park is one of the few old fashioned football grounds left in the Scottish League. It presently has a capacity of 4,602, although this has previously been much higher, the record crowd being 10,780 against Rangers in 1970. The total has more recently been reduced for safety reasons. Present attendance averages perhaps around 500 a week but can increase to over 1,000 if a large club with a sizeable travelling support visits, such as Greenock Morton or Airdrie United.\n\nThe ground allows access to all four sides of the pitch with one large terrace behind one goal (at the so called \"mert end\", because a cattle mart is just over the wall!), a main partly covered stand built in the 1960s which includes some seating down the north side of the pitch and two smaller stands on the other sides. The stand on the south side of the pitch is covered. Catering at the ground is quite good and somewhat unique, with the local speciality, Forfar bridies, being popular with home and visiting fans alike, although the more usual pie is avialiable too. There is at present a plan to rebuild the main stand in a more modern style with improved facilities.\n\nThe ground, as the name suggests, was once close to the town's railway station, situated on the ex Caledonian Railway's main line from Aberdeen to Glasgow and London, but unfortunately this station was closed in 1968 as part of the Beeching cuts. As a result the ground is best reached by road."
