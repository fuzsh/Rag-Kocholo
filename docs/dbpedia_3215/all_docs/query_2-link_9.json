        "text": "A must read by all fans, read on……A LIFE-LONG Forfar Athletic fan has put pen to paper to record the tales of ten Loons greats of the past in a book.\n\nThe Station Park club has experienced many peaks and troughs since it was established away back in 1885 and, in his book, entitled “Forfar Greats”, David Potter centres on ten players who played leading roles in the fortunes of Forfar Athletic through the years.\n\nThe book comes in ten chapters – with the focus on Davie McLean, Alec Troup, George Henderson, Frank Hill, Dave Kilgour, David Davidson, Doug Berrie, Archie Knox, Stewart Kennedy and Craig Brewster.\n\n“Apologies are tendered to the likes of Geordie Langlands, “Jummer” Petrie, Allan Smart, Alex Brash, Ian McPhee and others, who may feel they deserve to be called “a Forfar Athletic great”. “The emphasis has been on long ago players with the deliberate intention of keeping their memories alive.\n\n“Indeed I was surprised by a few things in my research – that three ex-Forfar players have scored goals in Scottish Cup finals and that Davie McLean was as well-loved for his cricket as his football.\n\nHe has written a few books on football, notably “Wee Troupie”, about Alec Troup, who features in chapter two of “Forfar Greats.”\n\nSupporters can also look forward to the chance of purchasing a replica kit based on the strips worn by the club some 125 years ago!\n\nA specially designed home kit has been based on the kit of 1885, complete with a special commemorate badge."
