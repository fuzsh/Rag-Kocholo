Burial at Lanes Chapel Cemetery in Clarksville, Texas at 3 pm.\n\nVisitation will be from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm, Friday, July 22, 2022, at Cottle Funeral Home, Troup.\n\nOllie was born in Addielow, Texas to the late Cleveland L. and France Terry Bailey on June 4, 1929. She worked as a manager for Lynnâ€™s Variety Store for 12 years. She was a member of the First Baptist Church of Troup. She worked in the church nursery for over 30 years. As her church babies grew up, they would often show up to introduce her to their babies. There were always random pictures of kids we had never seen on her refrigerator. She loved when her kids, grandkids, and even her great grandkids attended church with her. She was well respected by her community. She was a well-known seamstress in the area and did alterations well into her eighties. She was so proud of her yard. She was an avid gardener and when you went to see her you had to walk around her yard so you could see all her pretty plants. We could go on and on.\n\nOllie is preceded in death by her parents, and husband Carroll E. Rogers; daughters, Felicia Hobbs, and Karen Lowe; sisters, Ursy Williams and Johnnie Adcock; grandson, Alex Schell.\n\nOllie leaves to cherish her memories four daughters, Deborah Rensoner and husband Terry of Wolfford, Tx, Daphne Patrick of Broken Bow, OK, Vickie Roe of Broken Bow, OK, and Toni Rambo and husband Steve of Troup, Tx; sisters, Cleavie Coffin of Bogata, Tx and Opal Green of Rockport, Tx; 16 grandchildren; 22 great-grandchildren; 2 great-great-grandchildren and numerous other family and friends.\n\nTo a Very Special Mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and great-great grandmother. We love you.\n\nArrangements are under the direction of Cottle Funeral Home, Troup."
