Troup, who was the younger brother of my great-grandmother, Mary MacKenzie (nee Troup).\n\nAlexander Stephen Troup was born on 8 November 1873 at Hillhead in Fyvie, Aberdeenshire, the second son of James Troup (a crofter and church officer) and Isabella Geddes.\n\nAm not totally sure when Alexander opened the chemist shop in Monifieth, but he was living in Monifieth in 1901 (he lived in Aberdeen in 1891, where he might have been a student at Robert Gordon's School of Pharmacy) and was the owner of the chemist shop in Monifieth by 1905. But am thinking that the business perhaps opened in around early 1898, as that's when I first noticed newspaper advertisements for 'Alex S. Troup, chemist, Monifieth'.\n\nIn 1915, he is living at 12 Hill Street ('Mount Pleasant'), then later lived at 24 Maule Street ('Belmont').\n\nAlexander married Isabella McCrae (a Monifieth lass, 1887-1964) in Monifieth in 1909. The couple had a son, Ian McCrae Troup (1918-2002), who was a doctor in Dundee. Ian Troup helped to treat some of the T.B. patients who were in Ashludie Hospital in the late 1940s and 50s.\n\n1n 1920, Alexander is listed as owning a lemonade factory in Union Street (North Union Street, I think), Monifieth.\n\nMy grandfather, Ronald MacKenzie, worked in the shop (and served his apprenticeship there) from 1910 to 1932, approx - and think my Mum also worked as a locum in the shop on several occasions.\n\nAlexander S. Troup died in Duneaves Nursing Home (in Broughty Ferry) on 12 December 1938, aged 65, and is buried in Barnhill Cemetery, along with his wife, Isabella.\n\nElizabeth Mary (Troup) MacKenzie, one of Alexander's sisters, is also buried in Barnhill Cemetery, Dundee.\n\nAlexander Stephen Troup, brother of Elizabeth, is buried in the same cemetery.\n\nHe is the son of James Troup and Isabella Geddes.
