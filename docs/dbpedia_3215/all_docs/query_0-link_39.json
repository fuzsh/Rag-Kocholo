        "text": "We will remember them\n\nThis roll commemorates the men who joined the armed forces from what were then known as the General Registry Office of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland), and the Register House Departments: the Record Office, the Sasine Office and the Deeds Office.\n\nThe Record, Sasine and Deeds Offices were the main occupants of General Register House on Princes Street, Edinburgh, while the General Registry Office (later the General Register Office - GROS) occupied most of New Register House next door on West Register Street. Not included here are members of staff who worked in other public offices in the two buildings, such as the Lyon Office and the Accountant of Court.\n\nNational Records of Scotland (NRS) was formed in 2011 and is the descendant of GROS and the Record Office. Registers of Scotland continues the work of the former Sasine and Deeds Offices.\n\nThe first part of the roll lists the men who served and died during the First World War. The names of former members of staff who transferred elsewhere or resigned their posts shortly before the war are marked with an asterisk(*).\n\nThe second part of the roll lists serving members of staff who served in the armed forces and survived the war, arranged by department. Messengers and porters worked in both buildings, but are listed under the departments in which they are documented during the war. This roll of service does not include former members of staff.\n\nNo official roll of honour for the Register House staff was compiled at the end of the First World War. This roll therefore fills a gap but does not claim to be complete. NRS would welcome further information about the men listed here, or suggestions of names of men who may have been missed.\n\nIf you have a connection to Register House, or a story to tell, please share it with us [email protected].\n\nRoll of Staff who died during the First World War\n\nGeneral Registry Office for Scotland (GROS)\n\nRecord Office\n\nDeeds Office\n\nSasine Office\n\nRoll of Staff who served during the First World War\n\nGeneral Registry Office for Scotland (GROS)\n\nRecord Office\n\nDeeds Office\n\nSasine Office\n\nSources\n\nRoll of Staff who died during the First World War\n\nGeneral Registry Office for Scotland (GROS)\n\nDavid Alexander Anderson.
