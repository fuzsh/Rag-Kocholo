        "text": "It appears that all of those persons enslaved by Robert Lachlan Troup in Montgomery County, Georgia were divided into two lots, Lot #1 going to his nephew, a lunatic, George Michael Troup, Jr. and Lot #2 going to his brother, Gov. George Michael Troup.\n\nRobert appears to have owned two plantations in Montgomery County, Horseshoe and Rosemont Plantations, and, according to writings of the time, he also fathered several children that he stated were being left, enslaved, with his brother George.\n\nHis will lists one enslaved woman, Matilda, who was 15-years-of age at the time of the writing, and it is unknown why she is singled out among all the other children Robert presumably fathered; but we can assume she was his daughter, or, possibly, a âconcubineâ, in that maybe he got her pregnant right before he died and he was making sure she did not end up in a field with his soon to be born child.\n\nHe states: ââ¦with the single execution so far as my personal property is concerned of the young girl Matilda now about fifteen years of age and brot up in the family which said girl I will and bequeath to Miss Sarah E. Williams for her heirs Executors and assigns as a small token of my regard Esteem and respect for her.â Dated 21 September 1848.\n\nWho was Sarah Williams to Robert? Was she a woman he wouldâve married? The only person by this name in Montgomery County during the 1850 census was a 4-year-old girl, the presumed daughter of Franklin H. Williams. Was this the same person? Or, did Sarah live elsewhere, or, possibly die before 1850? Very curious.\n\nMatilda was special for some reason; the wording suggests that she was raised as Robertâs child, inside of his home, never having to work.\n\nThe lot of enslaved people that George Sr. presumably inherited from his brother does not match those found in Georgeâs estate when he died in 1856; however, there was an eight-year gap between the brothersâ deaths, so itâs likely many died or were sold away by the time George died.\n\nMatching the lots created against the original inventory in Robertâs estate, we find that Lemon, Abe, Abraham, and a man whose name looks like Zinc or could be June are not in the lots. Then, there is Alex, Patty, Sarah Ann, and Yorrick who were listed in the lots but not the original inventory.\n\nIt is hard to tell if Robertâs enslaved people were listed in Georgeâs estate due to the commonality of names; although, there are some unique names, like Yorrick, which is listed in Georgeâs estate and Robertâs estate, but, again, are they the same man or is it just a coincidence?\n\nIt appears that the lots were divided by family groups because we can find some of these names twenty years later in the 1870 census; therefore, check the âcombined listâ for possible surnames.\n\nIf you have not read Georgeâs page, I will reiterate here, that many African-American descendants claim Gov. George Michael Troup as their Caucasian ancestor, yet, no one has any sort of proof other than a family story."
