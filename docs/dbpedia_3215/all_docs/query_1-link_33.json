        "text": "Stream: Troup, ‘Mercury and Gold’\n\nTroup, the namesake band of Wales-born singer-songwriter Alex Troup, have been crafting new guitar-pop jams since they released their full-length “Last Chance for Romance” in 2014. The frontman and bandmates Claudio Tristano, Graham Roby, Evan Beigel and James Jannetty this week unveiled the title track to a new EP they have planned for a fall release. In “Mercury and Gold” — a shiny apple that seems to have fallen from the Big Star/Matthew Sweet tree and polished with British Invasion influences — Troup assures his objet d’affection “I can be there for you” despite the fact that person can be poisonous as mercury or precious as gold. And by the way, can we in general have more tasty guitar solos like Tristano’s, the kind that don’t wear out their welcome? Recorded at Elliott Smith’s old digs, New Monkey Studios in Van Nuys, and co-produced by Troup and Beigel (the band’s drummer), “Mercury and Gold” came out Friday as a single.\n\n||| Stream: “Mercury and Gold”"
