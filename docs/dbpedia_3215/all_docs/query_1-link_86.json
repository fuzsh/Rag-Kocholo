        "text": "\"What type of glass do you use?\" Apparently if you're a photographer you should know the answer to this question. At the time I was asked said question, I was a straight-out-of-college kid, and I had no idea what this guy was asking me. What's worse? I studied photography in college. After a long pause to try and come up with something, all I could say was, \"Um, what?\" He gave me a smirk as if I was one of those photographers (AKA: a poser).\n\nFive years removed from this situation, I could now come up with a few better responses than the dreaded, \"Um, what?\" After proudly hanging up that piece of paper that says you finally accomplished something in four years of all-nighters, last-minute cramming, and wondering if you can get away with adding one more cliche in your 20-page paper, the expectation is that you should know what you're talking about. Did anyone ever tell those people that two years of a 4-year degree is just more college algebra, English, biology, psychology and other general education classes? So really, us college-goers had 2 real years of focusing on our degree of choice. Two years out of a 100 year life, if we make it that far. Let's not forget that valuable internship where you learned how to do data entry, file years worth of paperwork that someone else didn't feel like organizing, and help you develop a mean phone greeting.\n\nI'm not saying college was a waste, but I'd love for the experienced people of this world to give the inexperienced a bit of a break and also start sharing some knowledge so we aren't trying to work our way through the dark without our night-goggles. Sometimes I wonder if that's why some people I interact with that had to \"tough it out\" and those that say, \"I didn't get handed anything, I had to make it on my own,\" don't really want to help. They want to see others struggle to make it like they had to. There is merit in the struggle, and I think you'll find that millennials aren't looking for a handout (okay, some of us are, but I'm not talking about them). I just need a little advice and a few encouraging words along the way.\n\nIf I could get a farmhouse, calligraphy-etched, wooden sign with the words, \"fake it 'til you make it,\" I would promptly - and gladly - light a match and burn it. There is no reason we should fake what we don't know. The problem with college is that it teaches you how to navigate in a world that is totally different than the job world. There are no more lecture halls, grades for assignments, no last minute tests to cram for, and there's always someone to compare your knowledge and success to. When I graduated, I felt like my support system of professors, counselors, and fellow students fizzled away. I was left with the stark reality that I may not find this unique network again.\n\nAm I There Yet by Mari Andrew is a creatively illustrated book with the tagline: \"The loop-de-loop, zigzagging journey to adulthood.\" How accurate. The author takes the reader through the journey and multiple winding steps of navigating your 20's with poignant illustrations of #Adulting. One of my favorite illustrations is under a section called \"People Worth Admiring\". A drawing of a book with the caption, \"fictional character who does the right thing,\" precedes a long dotted line ----- how do you become a person who does the right thing? ----- Answer? Practice. Other answers are risk taking, taking time to get to know yourself, and to follow your curiosity. None of these things happen by going through this adulting journey alone. Things will get messy. We will all experience a period of loneliness and possibly a quarter life crisis, but this is the real-world classroom. My goal is to take each day as a learning opportunity, and find someone that is willing to help me grow, and I will do my best to share my knowledge with others, too.\n\nNow I know that glass is another term for a camera lens, that I'm not born to be a photographer, and that I'm still trying to figure out how I will contribute my gifts to this world. I am challenging myself to accept that I don't know everything, and I have so much to learn from other people. There's knowledge that comes just from living more years on this earth. I encourage you to burn your \"fake it 'till you make it\" sign, and next time someone asks you something you don't know, confidently respond, \"I don't know, but I'm willing to learn.\" Or better yet, \"Why don't you teach me?\" Then, let the looks and smirks roll off your back, because we are all lifelong learners."
