        "text": "Alex Jackson (A.J.) Middlebrooks, age 45, was born on March 21, 1977, in Columbus, Ohio, to the late parents, Alexa R. Middlebrooks and Joseph J. Austin. At the time of his transition, on Friday, October 28, 2022, he was surrounded by those he loved.\n\nHe graduated from Columbus South High School. He was led to become a member in his early years at Mt. Herman Baptist Church.\n\nAs a Type 1 juvenile diabetes patient, A.J. went through many challenges in his medical journey. Through strokes, operations, and rehabs, he was still fighting his journey. He was a member of Ace of Spades Motorcycle Club and Columbus Steppers Dance Troup. A.J. was an organizing member of Klassay’ Productions Dance and Social Klub, where he danced and taught dance moves created by the group.\n\nHe received a kidney and pancreas transplant and was given the opportunity to sit with his beloved mother, Alexa Middlebrooks, in the “green chair” and place a memorial brick with Ohio Organ and Tissue Ceremony of Life; While both organs failed him, his love for humanity led him to be an eye donor in his death.\n\nAlex was preceded in death by his mother, Alexa Middlebrooks, who was his cheerleader throughout his life journey and did her all to make sure he had any and everything he needed to fight this battle; father, Joseph Austin; and uncle, Ronald Lewis (Doris Jean) Middlebrooks.\n\nHe is survived by: brother, Joseph Middlebrooks; sister, Shanya Fortune; aunts, Darlene (Donald) Middlebrooks Smith and Julie (Steven) Middlebrooks Reid; niece, Joenyia Middlebrooks-Herd; special cousins, Rondale Middlebrooks, Stephanie Reid, and Vanessa Reid; special friends, Michael Ferguson, Loli Solis, Mike Lucas, and Frances Green; cousins, Christina Middlebrooks and Sherrie Middlebrooks; and a host of other family and friends."
