        "text": "Alex Hall is one of the stars of new Selling Sunset spinoff Selling the OC on Netflix.\n\nThe realtor, who is an employee of The Oppenheim Group's new Orange County office, is one of the first new faces fans are introduced to on the premiere episode of the reality series, and is at the center of a lot of show's drama throughout the eight episodes.\n\nSelling the OC landed on Netflix on August 24 and already fans are desperate to know more about the cast, which also includes Kayla Cardona, Polly Brindle, and actress Brittany Snow's husband Tyler Stanaland.\n\nAs the new episodes keep viewers hooked, Newsweek has everything you need to know about Selling the OC star Alex Hall.\n\nAlex Hall Age\n\nAlex Hall is 33 years old.\n\nHer full name is Alexandra Hall but there are already two other Alexandras on the Selling the OC cast (Jarvis and Rose) and, as Hall reveals on the show, the only person to call her by her full name is her mom.\n\nHall also confirms on the series that she was raised in Orange County, where she still lives today.\n\nAlex Hall Instagram\n\nAlex Hall can be found on Instagram @alexhall_o.c where, at the time of writing, she boasts over 13,000 followers.\n\nHall's Instagram posts only began in October 2021, just a month before Selling the OC started filming, so this may be an account she set up after she'd joined the show.\n\nOn her page, Hall posts a mix of stunning selfies, real estate listings, pictures of her kids and funny videos.\n\nAlex Hall Kids\n\nAlex Hall is a devoted mom and mentions her kids throughout her time on Selling the OC. In the first episode, she is seen taking her two children, a daughter and a son, to drop them off at school before making her way to The Oppenheim Group office.\n\nHall's adorable children are from her marriage to her ex-husband. On Selling the OC, Hall confirms that she and her former partner were married for seven years.\n\nAlex Hall Boyfriend\n\nAlex Hall is seen going on a date with a man named Jeremy during one of the Selling the OC episodes, and it seemed to go well, but it is not known what their current relationship status is as he does not make any other appearances on the series.\n\nDuring the show, Hall does suggest she might be too busy to date as she says: \"Now I realize it's just basically another job that I don't need. There's only so many hours in a day, so I'm trying.\n\n\"My career is growing, my business is growing, kids are growing, and it's all really good, but I want to share it with somebody...Well, it's not, probably [going to happen] right now. Too much going on.\"\n\nAlex Hall Job\n\nAlex Hall is, of course, a realtor at The Oppenheim Group in Orange County.\n\nIn her Oppenheim Group bio, Hall is described as \"a skilled negotiator, visionary, entrepreneur and expert strategic planner\" who ranks in the \"top tier of Orange County real estate professionals.\"\n\nBefore working in real estate, Hall enjoyed much success in the world of interior design. She worked in the industry for over a decade before turning her hand at selling properties.\n\nAccording to her LinkedIn, Hall was an agent at Sotheby's and Christie's before joining The Oppenheim Group."
