He's got a certain strength in how he runs and that has never changed. He's played a lot of football here; taken a lot of hits. He's run the ball quite a bit and scored a lot of touchdowns, but he's never been the feature guy. But he's fine with that. He does his job, he gets a lot of tough yards, he's a physical runner, he's in the right place, where you need him to be, and he's doing it with a good attitude. He's another guy who at the end of the day had a very productive year and probably will be measured more for things you can't measure. It will be interesting without him. He's one of those players who has played so much, you feel like he's been here a long time. We're going to miss him.
