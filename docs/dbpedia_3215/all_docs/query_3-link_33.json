        "text": "In his 13 years with the Boston Red Sox, Troup Parkinson has never deleted an email, much to the chagrin of the team’s IT department. Among the messages he often revisits is one from human resources in 2003 informing him that his internship period with the team had come to an end. He forwarded the message along to Sam Kennedy, who had hired him the previous year.\n\nKennedy’s response? “Delete it. You’re staying here for a long time.”\n\nFortunately for the Red Sox, Kennedy proved prophetic. Since joining the club, Parkinson has ascended through the Red Sox’s front office, working with partnerships and clients services for the team. During that same time, the team’s sponsorship portfolio has grown fourfold, from 30 partners to 120.\n\nKennedy, now president of the club, said the team’s partnership revenue has quintupled in that time, something he attributed to Parkinson’s infectious personality and ability to form meaningful relationships.\n\n“I can’t tell you how many times ... CEOs, CMOs have said to me, ‘You know what, Sam? We were considering not renewing or moving money to a different area — outdoor, television, radio, Internet — instead of a Red Sox sponsorship, but we just couldn’t say ‘No’ to Troup,” Kennedy said. “‘We couldn’t not do business with Troup.’”\n\nParkinson said the key to the Red Sox’s sponsorship business has been ensuring that the team and the brands are “completely intertwined in everything we do.” Every baby born at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center — the team’s longtime hospital partner — dons a tiny Red Sox cap. W.B. Mason, a company older than the Red Sox themselves, is a household name in the region thanks in part to its logo presence on Fenway Park’s Green Monster.\n\n“People say, ‘Of course; you’ve had them forever.’ Well, not really, they got here in ’03,” Parkinson said. “We’ve been able to make people comfortable and be part of the fabric of this great old ballpark and the brand.”"
