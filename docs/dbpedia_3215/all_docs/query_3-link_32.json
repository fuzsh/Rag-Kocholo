I see you brought the tears for your eyes Your beauty cannot be televised I’m dancing to your tune ‘cause I’m mesmerized But oh, take a word of my advice It’s a long shot betting on you But that don’t worry me baby, I knew From the moment I saw you do the things you say you don’t do Breakdown Meet me down at the mall Cause you can’t expect us all to get your number and not call Just a young kid in America Everybody’s carried away with ya So come on it’s a beautiful day And won’t ya come and take a fall? Breakdown, breakdown, breakdown Don’t it feel good? You know you gotta set me free, honey Tell me there’s a chance for me Oh ‘cause all I ever wanted to be Was in your heart Just in your heart PRE-CHORUS CHORUS x 2\n\n4.\n\nSensation 03:59\n\nShe touches my leg I feels a sensation I need to get high so I can get down She’s all in my head Her life’s a vacation I got to be laid, I got to be laid right down She drags my heart around She drags my heart around She drags my heart around She’s cold as a stone She got no emotion Whenever we meet, there’s nothing to say Wha’d I say? She’ll hang up the phone in mid-conversation She gives me her body and takes me away Yeah she takes me away CHORUS I feel so lonely I feel so sad Cause she’s my only The best I had CHORUS Drags my heart Oh my heart Dragging it ‘round Drag it ‘round Been feeling so lonely Been feeling so bad Cause she was my only The best that I had I live for tomorrow She lives for today She takes me away\n\n5.\n\nRag-and-Bone Man 03:30"
