        "text": "James Richard (J. R.) Compton was born in 1944 in Boise, Idaho, and grew up in Altus, Oklahoma. After graduating from high school, Compton attended the University of Dallas, where he majored in English Literature. He graduated in 1966, then went to complete some photojournalism studies coursework at the University of Kansas. Compton was then affiliated with the U.S. Air Force, and completed photography coursework there, as well. For most of his life, Compton was primarily a photographer and did editorial work for several publications. Compton worked for student publications while he was in college, as well as small town newspapers. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Compton was a staff photographer for the Dallas Times Herald, and later began doing photography and editorial work for a Dallas underground newspaper, the Dallas NOTES. The Dallas NOTES later formed into Hooka, an acronym for the Humanitarian Order of Kosmic Awareness, after editor-in-chief Stoney Burns left NOTES. Other publications Compton contributed to include the Trinity River Messenger, Moat City Freek, Instant Karma Comix, and Bwana Art. In the 1970s, Compton did photographic work for El Centro Community College in Dallas, Texas, and editorial production work for The Austin Sun and The Austin Rag. Compton also independently published a magazine all about armadillos, armadilla, in 1974. In 1977, Compton began working for Dallas Jazz News (later becoming Texas Jazz), doing typestting, photography, and writing, working his way up to being co-publisher. Around this time, Compton began working with the Artists Coalition of Texas to publish the Dallas Arts Revue for two years, then continued a similar publication independently, called Texas Arts Revue. Compton's work with the Artists Coalition of Texas's Dallas Arts Revue and his own work on the Texas Arts Revue allowed him to develop relationships with local artists in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and across Texas. These connections with Dallas and Texas artists helped him create his own digital art blog, Dallas Arts Revue (dallasartsrevue.com). J. R. Compton's work in photography and publishing, as well as his influence on the arts community in Dallas, Texas, documents late 1960s and 1970s counterculture and contemporary art movements in Dallas from the late 1970s to the early 2000s. His photographic work showcases events such as the Texas International Pop Festival in Lewisville, Texas in 1969, the Lee Park Massacre in Dallas, Texas in 1970, as well as several protests and musical performances. Compton's photography and independent art publications also provided a platform to Dallas artists and helped create and preserve the Dallas arts community, and documented the growth of the Dallas Fort-Worth metroplex for over five decades.\n\nNote written by"
