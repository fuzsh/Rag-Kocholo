Biography

Alexander Stephen Troup, son of James troup and Isabella Geddes was born in Fyvie, Aberdeenshire on 8 November 1873.[1]

Alexander Stephen Troup established the Troup Chemist Shop in the High Street, Monifieth, Angus.

There were newspaper obituaries published in 'The Aberdeen Journal' and 'The Dundee Courier' for Alexander Stephen Troup in December 1938.

Alexander Stephen Troup is buried in Barnhill Cemetery, Broughty Ferry, Dundee (section S, up against the wall).

UPDATE Just a wee history of the Monifieth chemist, Alexander S. Troup, who was the younger brother of my great-grandmother, Mary MacKenzie (nee Troup).

Alexander Stephen Troup was born on 8 November 1873 at Hillhead in Fyvie, Aberdeenshire, the second son of James Troup (a crofter and church officer) and Isabella Geddes.

Am not totally sure when Alexander opened the chemist shop in Monifieth, but he was living in Monifieth in 1901 (he lived in Aberdeen in 1891, where he might have been a student at Robert Gordon's School of Pharmacy) and was the owner of the chemist shop in Monifieth by 1905. But am thinking that the business perhaps opened in around early 1898, as that's when I first noticed newspaper advertisements for 'Alex S. Troup, chemist, Monifieth'.

In 1915, he is living at 12 Hill Street ('Mount Pleasant'), then later lived at 24 Maule Street ('Belmont').

Alexander married Isabella McCrae (a Monifieth lass, 1887-1964) in Monifieth in 1909. The couple had a son, Ian McCrae Troup (1918-2002), who was a doctor in Dundee. Ian Troup helped to treat some of the T.B. patients who were in Ashludie Hospital in the late 1940s and 50s.

1n 1920, Alexander is listed as owning a lemonade factory in Union Street (North Union Street, I think), Monifieth.

My grandfather, Ronald MacKenzie, worked in the shop (and served his apprenticeship there) from 1910 to 1932, approx - and think my Mum also worked as a locum in the shop on several occasions.

Alexander S. Troup died in Duneaves Nursing Home (in Broughty Ferry) on 12 December 1938, aged 65, and is buried in Barnhill Cemetery, along with his wife, Isabella.

Elizabeth Mary (Troup) MacKenzie, one of Alexander's sisters, is also buried in Barnhill Cemetery, Dundee.

Alexander Stephen Troup, brother of Elizabeth, is buried in the same cemetery.

He is the son of James Troup and Isabella Geddes. [2]
