        "text": "Auburn Hills, Mich. (April. 29, 2019) -- Alpine Electronics of America, Inc. - As part of the company’s mission to strengthen its investment in the 12-Volt independent retail channel, Alpine Electronics of America, Inc. has committed to a Diamond ULTRA Partnership with the Mobile Electronics® Association (MEA) for 2019 – 2020. As the facilitator to a growing network of retailers, manufacturers, and service providers of automotive aftermarket technology products, the MEA provides educational resources and networking opportunities that directly support the independent mobile electronics specialist channel.\n\nThe Diamond ULTRA partnership will increase Alpine's presence at MEA-sponsored KnowledgeFest events, a key event for 12-Volt independent retailers. Moving forward, Alpine will have priority access to event space selection as well as a larger booth space for demo vehicles and product displays. The company will also gain hours for event training sessions to create more face time with 12-Volt retailers, as well as an elevated brand presence in events and Mobile Electronics Magazine marketing to all MEA dealer and audience members. The next KnowledgeFest event is August 9 – 11 at the Dallas Convention Center in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSince 2018, Alpine has continued to help the 12-Volt independent retail industry grow their Alpine business through the addition of seven new Brand Specialist positions who service 12-Volt independent retailers with products, sales, and marketing support.\n\nAdditionally, Alpine created the \"X-Perience\" event, a pop-up event facilitated by Brand Specialists and exclusively held at Authorized Alpine retailers. X-Perience events feature Alpine-branded demo vehicles that showcase the Alpine Halo9 iLX-309 9-inch AV Receiver with a complete X-Series sound system. At the event, attendees can take advantage of event-only promotions and free giveaways, all with the intent to drive sales, increase shop awareness, and ultimately foot traffic to the 12-Volt retailer stores. Alpine anticipates a total of 200 events in 2019.\n\nStay updated on Alpine's investment in the 12-Volt industry by subscribing to the monthly Mobile Electronics Magazine that features insights from MEA KnowledgeFest events and product information from the automotive aftermarket industry. You can also find the latest Alpine events schedule and product release news on the Mobile Electronics website and social media."
