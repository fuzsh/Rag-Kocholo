        "text": "Japanese manufacturer of consumer electronics\n\nAlpine Electronics, Inc. (アルパイン株式会社, Arupain Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese consumer electronics subsidiary[1] of the Japanese electronics component manufacturer Alps Electric, specialising in car audio and navigation systems.\n\nEstablished in 1967 as Alps-Motorola — a joint venture between Alps Electric and U.S.-based Motorola — it became Alpine Electronics, Inc. in 1978 when Alps bought out Motorola's share of the company. Alpine's engineering headquarters are in Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. Alpine also has manufacturing facilities in Brazil, Hungary, Mexico, China, and Thailand. In 2006, 76% of Alpine's revenues came from OEM sales. Honda have offered unbranded audio systems manufactured by Alpine for their vehicles, companies such as Dodge and Jaguar Land Rover have offered co-branded Alpine audio systems in their brands of vehicles.\n\nProducts and technologies\n\n[edit]\n\n1981- World's first automotive navigation system, created for Honda as the Electro Gyrocator.\n\n1982 - World's first in-car computerized equalizer.\n\n1983 - Alpine introduces their first remote control auto security systems.\n\n1984 - Alpine introduces the Model 9500 Mobile Cellular Telephone.\n\n1990 - 7909 CD Tuner.\n\n1991 - 5700 DAT head unit.\n\n1993 - 7980 world's first in-dash 3-CD changer and tuner\n\n1994 - World's first speaker utilising DDDrive Technology.\n\n1998 - World's smallest CD Auto Changer.\n\n2001 - World's first swivel in-dash monitor.\n\n2004 - World's first Dolby Digital EX aftermarket in-car product.[2]\n\n2004 - Alpine introduced the BioLite display technology in their 2004 receiver lineup.\n\n2004 - World's first company to manufacture a component which can interact with an iPod.\n\n2005 - First full Class D MOST bus amplifier for the Volvo XC90.\n\n2007 - Introduction of the iDA-x001, the first head unit developed in partnership with Apple to utilise the iPod.\n\n2008 - Introduction of the Imprint sound processor Technology, which allows individual car audio system tuning.\n\n2008 - Introduction of the IVA-W205R Mobile Media Station, which can house a portable Blackbird Navigation device.\n\n2009 - Introduction of head units which have integral bluetooth handsfree capability with an additional module.\n\n2011 - Introduction of ICS-X8 world's first MirrorLink enabled Mobile Media Station.\n\n2017 - Introduction of ILX-107 world's first in-dash receiver with wireless Apple CarPlay.\n\nOther innovations have included the Alpine F#1 Status systems and V12 AccuClass-D power amplifiers..\n\nAt the Alpine Museum in Japan there is a model \"7307\" radio/tape recorder (circa 1981)[3] shot by an American (Roger Holdaway of SpeakerWorks in Orange Ca Archived 2018-08-10 at the Wayback Machine) using a .45-caliber pistol at a distance of 4 feet (approx. 1.22 Meters). The owner, frustrated with the performance of the product, shot the unit and returned it to Alpine. This gesture brought home to Alpine the importance of product quality, and as a result, they spent US$25 million on a testing and evaluation centre in Iwaki-city, Japan.\n\niPod devices\n\n[edit]\n\nAlpine was one of the first in the industry to introduce in-vehicle iPod devices to allow users to control iPod playback using the head unit's front panel buttons or remote; view song information (artist, album and/or song name) on the display; and easily search for songs through the receiver's Quick Search interface. Alpine introduced the first aftermarket Interface Adapter for iPod (KCA-420i) in 2004, letting users experience optimized sound quality and control of digital music files in the car. In 2008, Alpine introduced a full line of iPod integration Digital Media Receivers. In 2009, Alpine introduced the first double-din iPod digital media station, the iXA-W404.\n\nBioLite Display\n\n[edit]\n\nAlpine introduced the BioLite display technology in their 2004 receiver lineup, claiming that it provides \"a much wider viewing angle than conventional displays and outstanding visibility, even in harsh daylight.\"\n\nNavigation devices\n\n[edit]\n\nAlpine continues to develop in-vehicle navigation aftermarket and OEM devices. In 2004, Alpine introduced the NVE-N872A. The DVD-based NVE-N872A was Alpine's fourth generation satellite-linked navigation system, based on an Alpine in-vehicle navigation platform, which won J.D. Power awards four times in six years. In 2006, Alpine introduced their first portable navigation device, the PMD-B100. In 2008, Alpine introduced the PND-K3, an all-in-one portable navigation plus Bluetooth hands-free system. In 2009, Alpine introduced the PND-K3msn with information like traffic and weather updates.[citation needed]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1986 Buick Grand National, modified by SpeakerWorks in Orange, California, is believed to be the only vehicle ever to retire undefeated from the pro division of the national sound-off circuit. The black Buick won the Alpine Car Audio Nationals II Pro Unlimited (751 watts and up) division in 1988, and IASCA's Pro unlimited title in 1989, 1990, and 1991 before being retired by its owner, Richard Clark. Its sound system is composed of five model 3545 amplifiers and the model 7909 head unit.\n\nExamples of vehicles equipped from the factory with Alpine equipment\n\n[edit]\n\nAlfa Romeo 156 Tuner and amplifier module, CD changers (1997–2002)\n\nAudi A8 (D4) (D4) display, DVD and CD changer\n\nJaguar screens, tuner, DVD, amplifiers\n\nLand Rover tuner, DVD, rear screen entertainment\n\nAston Martin amplifier, speakers, rear screen entertainment\n\nBMW All vehicle lines (CD and DVD changer)\n\nBMW 5 series (E60) Displays\n\nBMW 5 series (F10) business navigation and display\n\nBMW Mini radio and navigation systems\n\nChrysler 200 sound system (2015–2017)\n\nChrysler 300 sound system (2011– )\n\nChrysler Town and Country sound system (2011– )\n\nChrysler Pacifica sound system (2017– )\n\nDodge Challenger sound system (2011– )\n\nDodge Charger sound system (2011– )\n\nDodge Dart (PF) sound system (2013–2016)\n\nDodge Journey sound system (2011– )\n\nDodge Grand Caravan sound system (2011–2017)\n\nDodge Ram (1500, 2500, 3500, and Chassis Cabs 3500, 4500, and 5500) sound system (2009– )\n\nDodge Viper sound system (2013–2017)\n\nFiat 500 sound system (2013– )\n\nFiat 500L sound system (2014– )\n\nHonda Ridgeline DVD navigation system (2006–2014)\n\nJeep Grand Cherokee (WK2) sound system (2011– )\n\nJeep Cherokee (KL) sound system (2014– )\n\nJeep Wrangler (JK) sound system (2013– )\n\nLincoln Navigator AM/FM/Cassette (2000-2002)[4]\n\nLincoln Town Car tape deck (1998–2002)\n\nMercedes S-Class W221 tuner and amplifier module, disk changers\n\nMercedes E-Class W211 head units, disk changers\n\nMercedes M/R/GL Class head units, navigation systems, disk changers\n\nShow cars\n\n[edit]\n\nBetween the early 1980s until the end of the 1990s, when the partnership ended; as well as supplying car audio to Lamborghini, Alpine used their top-of-the-range sports model (Countach, later superseded by Diablo) as a mascot car which featured in every product brochure and trade and public shows. The company's UK office, Alpine UK had a yellow Lamborghini Diablo SE30 Jota with the registration L666 LAM (referring to the Diablo name) which was often seen at shows and events.\n\nThe U.S. office, Alpine of America, Inc., onward from 2001, commissioned a series of cars, some with custom airbrush and extensively modified bodywork and interior, which is designed to incorporate as many of its products as possible, the cars usually appear in various shows throughout the country. The cars that were used were:\n\n2001: BMW M3\n\n2002: Acura RSX[5]\n\n2003: Honda Civic[6]\n\n2004: MINI Cooper[7] Unlike previous models, which were closed top, the MINI was more of a speedster, with low rake windscreen.\n\n2005: BMW X5 (E52)[2], was a car that was used previously as a project car,[8] the car's bodywork has a mural of musicians from the last 50 years, they include Ray Charles, Madonna, Jimi Hendrix, Mick Jagger and Bob Marley to create an illusion of how their music will sound with their products.\n\n2006: BMW 645 (aka Sinister 6)[9]\n\n2007: IMPRINT RLS (based on the Mercedes Benz R500)\n\n2008: 25' V-Bottom Alpine Sport Boat trailered by a 2008 Mercedes-Benz GL550[10]\n\n2017: Jeep Wrangler with Smittybilt for SEMA 2017 Alpine and Smittybilt Jeep Wrangler SEMA[11]\n\nMiscellany\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1984 Alpine acquired the Luxman brand of high-end home stereo equipment from Japanese Lux Corporation, and tried to merge their Alpine home hi-fi brand with the Luxman brand by co-branding the resulting products as Alpine/Luxman. Because of the differences in the way the products were built (Alpine used mainly standard stainless metals and plastics, Luxman used high-end exotic metals) and product lines from both brands were branded Alpine/Luxman it created brand confusion in their markets, and nearly destroyed the credibility of the Luxman brand. The company later sold off the Luxman brand in 1994 to concentrate fully on the car audio business.\n\nBetween 1992 and 1995, Ford Australia offered a premium sound system developed in conjunction with Alpine to their high-end Fairlane and LTD models.\n\nIn the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye, the Aston Martin DB5 driven by Bond featured an Alpine 7817R CD Tuner which acted as a communication device and doubled as a colour printer/fax.[12]\n\nIn the past, Alpine sponsored a driver from the Andretti Green racing team in the IndyCar Series. After sponsoring Dario Franchitti in 2005 and Marco Andretti in 2006,[13] they sponsored Tony Kanaan in 2007 and 2008.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2003, Alpine was the main kit sponsor of Spanish La Liga club Deportivo Alavés.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficial website"
