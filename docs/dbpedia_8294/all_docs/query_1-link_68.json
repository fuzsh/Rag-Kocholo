The compatible head units include the new Alpine Halo11 iLX-F511, the Alpine Halo9 iLX-F509, the iLX-507, and Jeep-specific radios i509-WRA-JK and i509-WRA-JL. Alpine is the first aftermarket car audio company with full TIDAL integration, allowing subscribers to the service to stream and download hi-res files in MQA format or lossless audio at CD quality.\n\nHigh-Resolution Audio is quickly becoming the new benchmark for high-quality music reproduction in any type of audio reproduction system. And that also includes automotive audio systems, which are no able to support access to music streaming services that offer high-resolution audio material. Playback of Hi-Res music files or streaming is only made possible through audio sources that support the intended Hi-Res specification such as the combination of TIDAL with Alpine’s new High-Res line of head units Ultra AlpineF#1Status and Alpine Status System, which are able to reproduce music up to 24-bit/96kHz.\n\nCompatible Alpine head unit customers can now access the high-res streaming experience with TIDAL, accessing its catalog of over 90 million songs and 450,000 videos. Users subscribing to the TIDAL Masters service, delivered in partnership with Master Quality Authenticated (MQA), allows HiFi Plus Members to listen to music exactly as it was released in high-resolution audio. TIDAL HiFi and HiFi Plus Members still get lossless audio and high-fidelity music options for superior sound quality that elevates the music experience. And TIDAL offers thousands of expertly curated playlists in all genres, together with TIDAL Rising, allowing the continuous discovery of new artists.\n\nSubscribers can access to select TIDAL features directly on the Alpine head unit, including My Mix, a personalized curation of sound based on listening history, expertly curated playlists, and individualized daily listening insights. The TIDAL feature also has convenient access to music controls like Play/Pause, Repeat, Shuffle, Playing List, and Search, where listeners can browse through featured artists, genres, “moods,” and more.\n\nTo get started, the software update is free to download and can be found on the Alpine Knowledge Center (https://kb.alpine-usa.com). The TIDAL app is available on the App Store or Google Play. A TIDAL subscription is required and sold separately. To access TIDAL on the Alpine Head Unit, the head unit must be tethered to a mobile or smartphone hotspot, which means that access to streaming will be tied to data rate limitations. TIDAL allows downloading files and full playlists while connected to home Wi-Fi, which is highly advisable for hi-res material.\n\nAlps Alpine is a leading manufacturer of electronic components and automotive infotainment systems founded in 1948. The Alps Alpine Group currently operates 110 bases in 26 countries and regions, supplying roughly 40,000 different products and solutions to around 2,000 companies worldwide. Those offerings include devices such as switches, sensors, data communication modules, touch input panels, actuators and power inductors; electronic shifters, remote keyless entry systems and other automotive units; consumer electronics like car navigation and audio-visual systems; and systems and services such as digital keys based on smartphone app and blockchain technology, and remote monitoring.\n\nTIDAL is a global music and entertainment streaming platform, available in 62 countries. The company aims to create a sustainable, artist-first and fan-centric business model for the music industry with innovative experimental features like direct-to-artist payouts and fan-centered royalties. TIDAL is available in Free, HiFi, and HiFi Plus tiers, with the HiFi Plus membership offering access to immersive audio features like Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) recordings, Dolby Atmos Music, and Sony’s 360 Reality Audio recordings.\n\nwww.tidal.com\n\nwww.alpsalpine.com | www.alpine-usa.com"
