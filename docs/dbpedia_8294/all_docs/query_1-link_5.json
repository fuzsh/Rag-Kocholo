Consequently, the Companies will reorganize into a holding company structure through a business integration with the aim of maximizing value for all stakeholders on a global basis and optimizing synergy effects throughout the business.\n\nParallel to this, in Europe, Alpine Electronics (Europe) GmbH/Alpine Electronics GmbH moved its European head office, with 170 employees to Ohmstrasse 4, 85716 Unterschleissheim, where Alps Electric Europe GmbH’s European Head office is located and thus since 3 Dec 2018 both offices and employees are working together in the same building, targeting the creation of synergies and sustainable growth as well as enhancing our customer service in the European region. However, both Alps Electric Europe GmbH and Alpine Electronics (Europe) GmbH/Alpine Electronics GmbH ‘s legal entities remain unchanged.\n\nTo celebrate the integration of the offices, an opening event took place on 4. February 2019. The city mayor of Unterschleissheim, Mr. Böck and Japanese General consul of Munich, Mr. Kimura as well as the landlord of our building, Mr. Graf were invited."
