Altogether, they offer significantly improved output, deeper bass extension, more control and even greater power handling.\n\nSWA Subwoofers – BASSLINE™ subwoofers were born from the collaboration between Alpine and Far East Movement, sharing one thing that is true to our hearts – music you can feel.
