        "text": "The Alpine Group is a bipartisan, bicameral government affairs consulting firm located on Capitol Hill. Our clients include Fortune 100 companies, private equity firms, trade associations, local governments and others. The Alpine Group is consistently ranked one of the top lobbying firms in Washington, and its personnel are recognized as substantive and political experts. Consisting of 25 professionals representing years of experience in a variety of senior political capacities, the firm provides strategic advice and implements those tactics to help clients successfully navigate the halls of Congress, the White House and federal agencies. As trusted advisors to our clients and for many policy makers, the Alpine Group is able to sort through the miasma of perspectives and opinions that derail so many other efforts in a way that consistently achieves the goals our clients set.\n\nThe firm also possesses vast experience in managing coalitions and ad hoc groups united for a common goal. The vast experience of the Alpine team – both within government and the private sector – allows us to create and manage campaigns on behalf of clients on a wide range of issues and policy areas that require managing grassroots activation, messaging, creation of economic analyses and a host of other tools.\n\nAs a bipartisan and bicameral firm, our clients are able to benefit from expertise and far-ranging relationships on both sides of Capitol Hill and both sides of the political aisle. Most issues we address for our clients require an expert sense of how a message or request will be received by policy makers and that can vary by party affiliation, geographical location or larger political dynamics. We are able to lead efforts to tailor each campaign so that it is appropriately tuned to maximum effect.\n\nThe Alpine Group’s offices are located on Capitol Hill, only a few blocks from the House and Senate office buildings and the U.S. Capitol. Even in an era of electronic communication, there remains no substitute to being in the corridors of power each day working with elected officials and their staff.\n\nThe Alpine Group is proud to be part of the Public Policy Holding Company (PPHC) which is a leading bi-partisan, full-service US government affairs business. It operates a portfolio of independent firms offering public affairs, crisis management, lobbying and advocacy services on behalf of corporate, trade association and non-profit client organizations. Clients engage the Group to enhance and defend their reputations, advance policy goals, manage regulatory risk, or otherwise engage with US federal and state-level policy makers, stakeholders, media, and directly to the public at large.\n\nSince its inception in 2014, the Group acquired and integrated eight businesses, now operating as five separate, independent companies, focused at the federal government level in the US and with expanding reach into key US states and metropolitan areas. The five operating entities which form the operating subsidiaries of the Group are Crossroads Strategies LLC, Forbes Tate Partners LLC, Seven Letter, O'Neill & Associates, and Alpine Group Partners LLC.\n\nJune 11, 2024\n\nAlpine Celebrates Jay Hawkins' Retirement After 40 Year Career; Promotes Courtney Johnson to Lead Health Practice (read more)\n\nMay 13, 2024\n\nAlpine Announces Promotions, Elevates Five Advisors to SVP, VP (read more)\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\nSustainable Aviation Fuel Stakeholders Unite to Form the SAF Coalition (read more)\n\nJanuary 24, 2024\n\nAlpine Group Hires Shayne Woods, Adding Health, AI Heft (read more)\n\nJanuary 23, 2024\n\n2023 LDA Rankings Show PPHC in Top Spot Once Again (read more, read more)\n\nDecember 18, 2023\n\nOn the Move: PPHC Ups Reed to Executive Director of Board (read more)\n\nDecember 15, 2023\n\nKeenan Austin Reed Appointed to Executive Director of PPHC Board (read more, read more)\n\nDecember 11, 2023\n\nAlpine Group Promotes Keenan Austin Reed to Principal (read more)\n\nDecember 11, 2023\n\nOn the Move: Alpine Group Ups Reed (read more)\n\nDecember 6, 2023\n\nThe Hill’s Top Lobbyists 2023 (read more)\n\nSeptember 12, 2023\n\nAlpine Group Adds Two, Including Hill Veteran Patrick Satalin (read more)\n\nJuly 26, 2023\n\nPPHC Leader Recognised as Lobbyist of the Year (read more here and here)\n\nJuly 20, 2023\n\nAlpine Group Executive Vice President Keenan Austin Reed Named \"Lobbyist of the Year\" (read more)\n\nMarch 14, 2023\n\nAlpine Group Hires Deborah Rowe, Former Senior Advisor to Democratic Leader Rep.
