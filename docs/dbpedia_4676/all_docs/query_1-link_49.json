        "text": "Martha Joan Wallace, 89, passed away on Monday, April 8, 2024. Joan was born on December 6,1934, in Wrigley, Tennessee to Clyde Lawrence Weatherspoon and Lona Elise (Plunkett) Weatherspoon.\n\nJoan graduated from DuPont High School in 1952. After graduating, she worked at Morris Department Store in Old Hickory. It was here that she and her boss Ms. Pass as a buyer would make trips by train to New York City to buy for the store. Joan was very active in her children’s lives while they were in school. She was the PTA President for many years, a room mother, substitute teacher, and was active in helping with the school carnivals. Joan was involved with both football and cheerleading; watching her son Bubba play and daughter Melinda cheer. Joan was a 50+ member of the Order of Eastern Star serving as Secretary to the Hendersonville Chapter from 1982-2017, was Worthy Matron in 1978 and was Grand Representative to Washington in 1988. Joan and her husband Jim Wallace, Sr. loved old cars and restored a 1922 Model T of which Joan did all the interior work. They enjoyed using the car in parades around the area. In addition, Joan became a huge supporter of Station Camp football and baseball supporting her grandson Joey and then supported the Tennessee Vols where both Joey and Alli attended. Joan attended Gallatin First Nazarene Church. She had a great love of the Lord. Her love, laughter, and sense of humor will be missed.\n\nJoan is preceded in death by her loving husband James E. “Jim” Wallace and her parents Clyde and Lona Weatherspoon. She is survived by her son James E. “Bubba” Wallace (Tammy) and daughter Melinda Jo Pelham (Chuck); grandson Joseph Edward “Joey” Wallace (Allison); sister Ellen Hinson; and soon to arrive great-grandson Bennett James Wallace.\n\nA visitation will be held on Thursday, April 11, 2024, from 4pm-8pm at Hendersonville Funeral Home. A second visitation will be held on Friday, April 12, 2024, from 10am-12pm with a funeral service beginning at 12pm in the Chapel at Hendersonville Funeral Home. Burial will follow at Hendersonville Memory Gardens.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in Joan’s name to the American Cancer Society."
