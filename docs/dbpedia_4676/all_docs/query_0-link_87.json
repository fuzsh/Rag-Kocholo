        "text": "Joan Bennett Lavery OBITUARY\n\nLAVERY, Joan Bennett Joan died peacefully at home on June 30, 2009, after a five year battle with cancer. She was born in upstate New York on October 13, 1929, and lived in Long Beach since 1932, having had her own medical and surgical supply company in the seventies. Joan was an icon that represented love, knowledge, courage, strength, and understanding. We are each wiser and more complete for having had her in our lives. She is survived by her hus band; children; grandchildren; and great-grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, send contributions in her name to your favorite charity."
