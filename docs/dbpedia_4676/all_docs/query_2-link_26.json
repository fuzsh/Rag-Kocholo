        "text": "Joan Bennett Dobricki (born March 24, 1932, East Hampton, New York) passed away quietly in her beloved home on Wolf Hollow Road on Monday morning, November 2nd. She was the wife of Raymond Dobricki, owner of Dobricki Insurance Agency, also deceased.\n\nShe is survived by her 4 children: Elizabeth Dobricki (New York City) John Dobricki (Syracuse, New York), Anne Bennett (Raleigh, North Carolina) and Paul Dobricki (Glasgow, Scotland) and his wife, Nikki Dobricki. Her 3 surviving grandchildren are Emma Elsea, Rachel Dobricki and Jacob Dobricki. Her 4 nieces and nephews from her brother, Donald Bennett, deceased, and sister-in-law Mary Jean Bennett, residing in East Hampton, Long Island, are Donna, Matthew, Vernon and Andrew.\n\nJoan enjoyed working in her garden and was able to do that until quite recently with the help of her devoted son, John, owner of Rockin’ Cool Cookie Co., a local bakery, who lived with her and cared for her until she passed away this week.\n\nJoan was a graduate of Oneonta State Teacher’s College where she was a member of the Arethusa Sorority, and taught grammar school for several years before starting her family. She also worked at Dobricki Insurance Agency.\n\nJoan loved cooking and was a member of several Syracuse based gourmet clubs.\n\nShe traveled to Europe and the Caribbean during her lifetime and was very interested in politics. Joan was a founding parishioner of St. Ann’s Church and attended regularly. Her Family and Wolf Hollow Family will miss her greatly.\n\nServices are at St. Ann's Church on Onondaga Boulevard, Saturday Nov. 6. 9am -10am visiting, 10am Mass, followed by burial at St. Mary's Cemetery DeWitt, NY.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please send a contribution to St. Jude Hospital."
