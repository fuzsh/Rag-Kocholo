        "text": "It was the blood that caught the attention of a passerby, a streak\n\nrunning down one side of the woman's face in a long red tear as she\n\ntried to hoist herself off the Beacon Street sidewalk. She looked like\n\na disoriented street person who had wandered into the Back Bay from the\n\nnearby Boston Common. “She said she was okay, but she did not look\n\nokay,” says Constance Bacon, who shielded the helpless woman from the\n\nrain as they waited for an ambulance. “She was conscious. She had just\n\nhit her head pretty hard. She knew that she had fallen and she tried to\n\nget up and she couldn't. So I just waited until the ambulance came. I\n\nhad no idea who it was, that it was anything special.”\n\nIt took little more than a day for Bacon—and the rest of the world—to\n\nfind out that the woman she had helped had a last name recognized\n\nacross the globe, that this bloody and disheveled person was the former\n\nmodel once nicknamed “the Dish” by her brother-in-law, the late\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy. As with other members of the Kennedy clan,\n\nnotoriety was nothing new to her. Her fall, which resulted in a\n\nconcussion and a broken shoulder, was the latest incident in a long and\n\nvery public struggle Joan Bennett Kennedy has waged against alcoholism.\n\n“No, she did not appear drunk,” Bacon said repeatedly afterward. But a\n\nsource close to Kennedy's three children says Kennedy's blood-alcohol\n\nlevel was well above the legal limit when it was tested at the hospital\n\nthat night. The limits of her ability to look after her own affairs had\n\nalso been exceeded, setting the stage for a battle worthy of any of the\n\npolitical or media skirmishes in which the Kennedy's have engaged over\n\nthe years.\n\nJoan Kennedy had taken to drinking in secret in the months before her\n\naccident, and her drugs of choice were mouthwash and vanilla extract.\n\nBoth contained enough alcohol to assuage her cruel thirst without\n\nproducing the rank odor of hard booze. A caretaker complained that\n\nKennedy, 68, had begun locking her out of the Beacon Street condominium\n\nwhere the one-time presidential in-law lives. (She also has a\n\nwaterfront house in Hyannis Port.) The caretaker told Kennedy's son\n\nPatrick, a congressman from Rhode Island, about the large quantities of\n\nvanilla extract his mother was bringing home from the market. “She said\n\nshe had taken up baking,” the friend of the Kennedy children says. “She\n\nwould tell the caretakers she would meet them somewhere and never show\n\nup. She'd try to lose them.”\n\nSuspicious amounts of mouthwash vanished from the bathroom. And there\n\nwere Kennedy's frequent absences from the Alcoholics Anonymous meetings\n\nshe attended during periods of sobriety. In the world of AA, identities\n\nare closely guarded, and the shapely older woman in the baseball cap\n\nand expensive ensembles was no different there from the homeless,\n\ndisoriented drunks still reeking of alcohol who would wander in from\n\nthe Park Street T station, lured by free coffee and cookies. In the\n\nmeetings she was no longer a Kennedy, but merely “Joan,” a fellow\n\nalcoholic with a soul-sapping disease.\n\nBooze does not discriminate. Still, Kennedy had a lot of people fooled.\n\nShe cleaned up well and continued to travel in elite circles. In fact,\n\nher close friend, philanthropist Ann Gund, insists even now that\n\nKennedy had been staying sober. Kennedy's doctors do not agree. The\n\nvanilla extract and mouthwash she apparently guzzled on a regular basis\n\ncaused enough damage to her kidneys that her children say she was\n\nwithin a year of needing dialysis to stay alive. That, and the spill\n\nshe took on Beacon Street, amounted to much more than just another\n\nembarrassing bout with the bottle. The kidney problems, the concussion,\n\nand the broken shoulder buoyed an argument Kennedy's children had been\n\nmaking for some time: Their mother was incapable of taking care of\n\nherself.\n\nAbout a day after his mother's tumble, Patrick Kennedy decided not to\n\npursue his ambition to follow his father, Edward M. Kennedy, into the\n\nUnited States Senate. He and his siblings, Edward Jr. and Kara Kennedy\n\nAllen, launched a complex court case aimed at taking over their\n\nmother's life. In addition to alcoholism, at issue was her involvement\n\nof a distant relative, Webster E. Janssen, to control her $9 million\n\nestate, which includes the Back Bay condo and the house on Squaw Island\n\nin Hyannis Port. Janssen, a financial planner who lives in Connecticut,\n\nrailed against the Kennedy offspring for hiring a “zookeeper” to\n\nscrutinize their mother's routine. “I don't know why they would put\n\ntheir mother through this misery,” he said.\n\nThat dispute would drag out through the spring as bitter Kennedy v.\n\nKennedy lawsuits were filed in Barnstable Probate and Family Court on\n\nCape Cod. Court papers were submitted as discreetly as possible, but\n\none incendiary element, according to the family friend, was a reference\n\nto the bipolar disorder and depression from which the children claimed\n\ntheir mother suffered, in addition to her alcoholism. “The children are\n\nthere for her as much as they can be, but she has no husband and no\n\nsignificant other, and she's someone who really needs someone to be\n\nwith her,” this source says. “It's been a very draining situation for\n\nthe children, and they don't wish this on anyone else, but they know\n\nthis is happening to families all across the country.”\n\nThe acrimonious battle began in July 2004, when Joan's older son,\n\nEdward Jr., cofounder and president of a New York business development\n\nand government-relations firm, was appointed her legal guardian.\n\nBarnstable Judge Robert Terry had ruled that Joan was “incapable of\n\ntaking care of herself by reason of mental illness.”\n\nEdward Jr. was the most qualified for the responsibility, having spent\n\nthe bulk of his adult life advocating for the disabled. It was a cause\n\nhe could relate to, having lost a leg to bone cancer at age 12. For a\n\nfew months, the relationship was an effective one. The children took\n\nturns being with their mother as much as possible and took care of her\n\nfinances. But Joan's resentment ultimately bubbled over. That fury was\n\nwhat Janssen, 70—a second cousin on Joan's mother's side—tapped into\n\nwhen he showed up on the scene.\n\nIt remains unclear how Webster Janssen managed to track down and make\n\ncontact with his distant cousin. He insists that he has been a part of\n\nthe family all along and claims to have attended Kara Kennedy Allen's\n\nwedding. Patrick Kennedy says he does not remember meeting Janssen. Nor\n\ndo any of the other children, according to the family friend. He grew\n\nup in Bronxville, New York, not far from where Joan was raised, and is\n\na licensed securities professional, but he could not explain what\n\nbenefit he would bring to Joan Kennedy's life, merely insisting in an\n\ninterview that he “never took a dime” from her.\n\nJanssen quickly assumed complete control, denying Joan's children\n\naccess to records of her assets, according to both Patrick and Edward\n\nJr. He put Joan's Hyannis Port house on the market, a violation of the\n\ncourt order that had put her elder son in charge of her affairs.\n\nJanssen also set up two trusts, of which he was the sole trustee.\n\nThose moves were questionable enough that the Kennedy children got a\n\ncourt order preventing the sale of either of their mother's properties.\n\nThen they filed a complaint against Janssen. “We are contemplating\n\nother legal action against Mr. Janssen,” Edward Jr. said, “for\n\nfinancial advisor malpractice.”\n\nJanssen fired back, accusing the Kennedy offspring of ruining Joan's\n\nlife. “I have been in business for 45 years and never had a client\n\ncomplain about me,” he said. “So lotsa luck.”\n\nIt was not the first time Joan Kennedy had found herself mired in\n\nchaos. The alcoholism, the drama and despair that would soon become\n\nsynonymous with the Kennedy name—all were a part of her life from the\n\nstart.\n\nVirginia Joan Bennett was born September 9, 1936, in the Riverdale\n\nsection of the Bronx, a neighborhood that closely resembles the\n\nlace-curtain Irish communities in Boston where paintings and\n\nphotographs of JFK still hang on the walls. She was named for her\n\nmother. Her parents, Henry Wiggin Bennett Jr. and Virginia Joan Stead\n\nBennett, were both successful professionally but also lived with\n\nuntreated alcoholism. “It's a terrible disease,” says the Kennedy\n\nfamily friend. “Her parents were both alcoholics and it's just a\n\ndisease that gets worse and worse unless you try and get some control\n\nover it.”\n\nManhattanville College in Purchase, New York, was the ideal escape for\n\nJoan—close enough to home that she could drop in on her parents, but\n\nstill removed from the claustrophobic environment of an alcoholic\n\nhousehold. It was there that she met her future sisters-in-law, Jean\n\nKennedy—JFK's youngest sister—and Ethel Skakel, who would later marry\n\nRobert Kennedy. The three women had all grown up among garrulous Irish\n\nCatholics, but Joan and Jean were the shy and reserved members of their\n\nrespective families. Jean's mother, Rose, once remarked of her\n\ndaughter, the second youngest of nine children: “She was born so late\n\nthat she only was able to enjoy the tragedies and not the triumphs.”\n\nThere would be plenty of tragedies in the lives of all three women.\n\nJoan Bennett was a startlingly beautiful blonde. Leggy and coquettish,\n\nshe caught Ted Kennedy's eye in 1957, when he was a dashing young law\n\nstudent visiting his sister's campus during a building dedication. At\n\nthat time she was a part-time model and did the occasional TV ad for\n\nRevlon or Coca-Cola. After a yearlong courtship, they were married.\n\nThey had their first child, Kara, in 1960. In typical Irish-Catholic\n\nfashion, the couple continued to expand their family: Edward Jr. was\n\nborn in 1961, and Patrick came along five years later.\n\nThere was little hint of trouble between the handsome politician and\n\nthe TV model. Laurence Leamer, author of The Kennedy Women, described\n\nJoan in a recent interview as having “this incredible guileless\n\nquality. She's a total innocent even now.” Then, in 1964, the Kennedys\n\nhad a stillborn baby boy. That baby is buried in the Kennedy plot at\n\nHolyhood Cemetery in Brookline, a site that has become a sad symbol of\n\nwhat many now see as the Camelot curse. The baby is buried alongside\n\nMichael Kennedy, one of Senator Robert F. Kennedy's children, who was\n\nkilled in a ski accident in 1997. Joan and Ted would lose three\n\nchildren, including a baby that was miscarried in the aftermath of the\n\nChappaquiddick tragedy.\n\nThat famous accident, which would dash any chance Ted Kennedy had to\n\nbecome president, occurred on a sultry July night in 1969, when the\n\nsenator drove off a bridge on the island of Chappaquiddick, at the\n\neastern end of Martha's Vineyard. A young woman named Mary Jo Kopechne\n\nwas beside him. His car plunged into a shallow waterway, Poucha Pond,\n\nlanding upside down. Kopechne drowned; Kennedy swam to shore, leaving\n\nher body in the water to be found by Edgartown police. Afterward, his\n\nwife stood by her man, even at Kopechne's funeral. Already pregnant\n\nwith another child, Joan would lose the baby a month later. “For a few\n\nmonths everyone had to put on this show, and then I just didn't care\n\nanymore. I just saw no future. That's when I truly became an\n\nalcoholic,” she told Laurence Leamer.\n\nJoan's show came to a grinding halt in 1974, when she was arrested in\n\nVirginia for drunken driving and lost her license for six months. The\n\nKennedys were all too familiar with public scandal, but even they were\n\nhorrified by Joan's unraveling. Her marriage to Ted ended in 1982, two\n\nyears after his disastrous run for the presidency.\n\nThe divorce did not end Joan's drinking, however. In 1988, she crashed\n\nher car into a fence in Centerville on Cape Cod and was ordered to\n\nattend an alcohol education program; she lost her license for 45 days.\n\nIn 1991, she was arrested after being observed drinking vodka straight\n\nfrom the bottle while weaving her car along the Southeast Expressway.\n\nShe would go through drying-out stints, including ones at Belmont's\n\nMcLean Hospital and also at New York's St. Luke's?Roosevelt Hospital\n\nCenter, which has treated other celebrity alcoholics, including\n\nbaseball players Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry and author Truman\n\nCapote. And with each misstep came more intense media scrutiny. “It has\n\nbeen hard,” she said in a 1992 interview. “It is easier now. I have all\n\nthis support. There's wonderful forgiveness from people.” Referring to\n\nher sobriety in a July 2000 interview, she said, “It's such a relief to\n\nbe free.”\n\nThat freedom apparently ended in the fall of 2000 with another drunken-\n\ndriving arrest on Cape Cod. A motorist called 911 saying a blue Buick\n\nhad been all over a road in Marstons Mills. When cops arrived, they\n\nfound Joan on unsteady feet outside her car. Later she failed a\n\nBreathalyzer test at the station. It was her fourth arrest, and it was\n\nserious now. Even the Kennedy name might not be enough to keep her out\n\nof jail this time. It is not uncommon, however, for a judge to\n\nrecognize alcoholism as a disease and recommend probation and\n\nrehabilitation rather than jail time, which is how matters were dealt\n\nwith.\n\nPatrick then called on the media to give his mother “the room and\n\nprivacy to be able to deal with this latest incident as she has handled\n\nother setbacks in her life.” He added, “I love my mother very much.”\n\nThe 2000 arrest came just a few months after Joan told the Boston Globe\n\nshe had been sober for nine years. “After that amount of time people\n\nstart to forget,” she said. “So I'd rather not bring it up and have\n\npeople say, 'Ohh, Joan. She's the alcoholic.' Because a lot of places I\n\ngo, people don't know.”\n\nThe duration of Joan's sobriety may have been in question, but what she\n\naccomplished during the dry times was not. While her children were busy\n\nwith their own lives and careers, and with her ex-husband remarried,\n\nJoan combated her loneliness by turning to charitable endeavors and the\n\narts. An accomplished pianist with a master's degree in education, she\n\nis well known in Boston for her support of the symphony, the opera, and\n\nthe Pine Street Inn homeless shelter. She has served as chairwoman of\n\nthe Boston Cultural Council and remains a fixture on the social scene,\n\nrubbing elbows with the city's movers and shakers.\n\nShrugging off her checkered past, she wrote a family guide to classical\n\nmusic, and in early 2000 she hired a personal trainer and started\n\nworking out at a Back Bay gym. Her children were excited that she was\n\npulling her life back together—again. Then came the humiliating stumble\n\nin the Back Bay, and Joan found herself back in the swirling cycle of\n\naddiction.\n\nPatrick Kennedy feared the worst when he received the\n\nmiddle-of-the-night call. His brother's voice on the other end of the\n\nline told him only that their mother had been found on a Beacon Street\n\nsidewalk and was now in New England Medical Center. “Anyone who\n\nreceives a call in the middle of the night saying a loved one is in a\n\nhospital fears the worst,” he says through a spokeswoman.\n\nWhen Patrick arrived at the hospital, his eyes were red-rimmed with\n\nsleeplessness and he was clearly shaken as he spoke with reporters\n\nabout the difficulties of helping his mother. “You want to make sure\n\nthere's someone there for her all the time . . . but at the same time\n\nyou don't want to encroach on her privacy too much,” he said. “When\n\nthings like this happen, it makes you feel as though maybe you should\n\nhave done more to make sure there's someone with her 24/7, and perhaps\n\nthat might become necessary.”\n\nIt was then that Patrick added he was dropping out of the Senate race.\n\nHe had too much to tend to. One such concern was a bill he is\n\ncosponsoring in Congress that proposes clear-cut laws to protect the\n\nelderly from con artists and make it easier for relatives to step in to\n\nprotect their loved ones' interests.\n\nThe family's public sniping finally ended in June, when all parties\n\ncame to an agreement hammered out in a Barnstable courthouse a few days\n\nbefore Kennedy v. Kennedy would have become an embarrassingly public\n\ntrial. Under the deal, the trusts established by Janssen were dissolved\n\nand the Hyannis Port house was taken off the market. Joan Kennedy\n\nagreed to strict court-ordered supervision, with a guardian to make\n\nsure she stayed away from the bottle. It was a deal she could live\n\nwith.\n\n“I'm feeling fine,” she said to a reporter outside her Back Bay condo a\n\nday after she signed the agreement that put her fortune in the hands of\n\na new trust overseen by two court-appointed trustees. Joan Kennedy has\n\nessentially become a ward of the state, her every move monitored by the\n\ncourt. She is required to stay sober, comply with her live-in\n\ncaretakers, and refrain from any slip-ups. Otherwise, her children will\n\nbe granted permanent custody of her."
