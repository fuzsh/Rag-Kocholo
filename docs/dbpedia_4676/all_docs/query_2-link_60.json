        "text": "Joan Carol Bennett, (73) of Laurel, MD, died peacefully on Wednesday, March 8, 2023 of cancer.\n\nJoan was born on October 6, 1949 to Gloria Natalie Rinaldi and Marvin Thomas Bennett in Los Angeles, CA. The family moved to Albuquerque, NM in 1956. Joan graduated from Sandia High School in 1967 and went on to Ripon College, in Wisconsin with a Speech and Debate scholarship. She double majored in English and French, then spent a year in France teaching English.\n\nShe studied at the University of La Verne College of Law where she met and married Albert Louis Bernal II in 1975. They had one daughter, Anne Louise Bernal. While in Law School, Joan enlisted in the US Army Reserves. She and Al divorced in 1978 and she moved to Northern California where she worked for the Port of Oakland. She joined the San Francisco District Attorney’s office as an Assistant DA where she worked for 12 years, trying a variety of cases from major and minor felonies to heading the Welfare Fraud Division. She then became an Attorney for the State of California.\n\nJoan transferred from the US Army to the US Navy Reserves where she specialized in loading non-nuclear weapons. Her Naval service took her to such places as Panama, Hawaii, Washington, DC, and of course, sailing the open seas on the USS Anzio. She retired in 1996 after reaching the rank of Commander.\n\nJoan met Gwendolyn Lanette Gentry in 1999 and they moved to Conroe, TX a few years later. Joan opened her own Immigration Law practice and helped hundreds of people to realize the American Dream. Her kindness and generosity established herself as a pillar in the Conroe community.\n\nJoan and Gwen were married in Maryland, November 2, 2013. Joan sold her practice and retired in 2017, when she and Gwen moved to Maryland to be near Anne, her husband Shawn, and their children Emmaline (El) and Genevieve. Joan loved to spend time with her grandchildren, they especially adored making chocolate chip cookies together.\n\nJoan was an active member at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, where she played in the Handbell Choir, was a member of the Reconciling in Christ ministry team and Bookends Book Club. Her handmade aprons were in high demand, and she could always be counted on to host the most excellent “Crepe Parties.” She loved cooking, especially experimenting with different cultural cuisines such as tamales, dim sum, Moroccan dishes, and Cowboy cooking. She enjoyed listening to audiobooks and gardening.\n\nJoan was preceded in death by her parents, beloved Aunt Nancy Dufresne, and wife Gwen. Joan is survived by Anne, Shawn, Emmaline and Genevieve Seifert, her sisters Judith Delgado and Cynthia Montoya, and her brother Robert Bennett.\n\nJoan’s Celebration of Life will be held at 3 pm on Saturday, March 25, 2023 at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, 7607 Old Sandy Spring Road, Laurel, MD 20707. Friends and family are welcome to gather at Anne and Shawn’s house at 7108 Old Sandy Spring Road after the services.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made in honor of Joan Bennett to Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, or Saint Mary of the Mills School, 114 St Mary’s Place, Laurel, MD 20707."
