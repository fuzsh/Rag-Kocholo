        "text": "Joan H Bennett passed away peacefully Saturday, January 28, 2023 at her home in Seven Lakes, NC surrounded by her children. She was 92 years old.\n\nShe was married for 60 years to the love of her life, Bob Bennett, who predeceased her by 9 years. They had 5 children in 8 years.\n\nShe was born in Bismarck, ND, to Charles and Edythe Hammes. She received her Nursing Degree from St. Luke’s Unit-Aberdeen, ND and practiced as a Surgical RN for a few years. Her greatest role in life was that of a devoted mother and wife to her beloved family.\n\nJoan and Bob were former residents of Corning, NY. His job at Corning Glass Works sent them to Warsaw, Poland and Seoul, Korea for the construction of two new color TV plants.\n\nUpon retirement, they built a beautiful camp on Long Lake, NY. They named the compound, “Drom Holm”. She had a very special love and talent for refinishing and restoring antique furniture which adorned their various homes.\n\nSeven Lakes, NC was their final residence. They enjoyed an active social life with many friends, Seven Lakes Country Club, Bob’s music and awaiting children and grandchildren to arrive for special visits. Joan was fiercely protective and lovingly loyal of her family. She was very thoughtful and faithful of her friends. She gave everything she had to bring comfort and care to those around her. She set an incredible standard of what it is to be a family Matriarch. She succeeded and we all were blessed.\n\nShe was predeceased by Bob Bennett(husband), Bill Bennett (son), and survived by Jeff and Cindy Bennett(son), Steve and Linda Bennett (son), Susan and Jack Wheeler(daughter), Barbara and Peter Droelle (daughter), Lark Bennett( daughter- in – law); 12 grandchildren and 11 great grandchildren.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, we ask for love and prayers …. especially for your own Matriarchs.\n\nServices are entrusted to Boles Funeral Home of Seven Lakes."
