        "text": "Love her. She's fun as a blonde in some of her 30s films, such as Raoul Walsh's Me and My Gal and George Cukor's Little Women (where she plays Amy).\n\nBut she really came into her own as an actress when, in the 1940s, she reinvented herself as a brunette femme fatale. She had a smokin' hot sexiness combined with a warm, down-to-earth quality that is very appealing. I especially like all four of the noirs she made with Fritz Lang (Scarlet Street, Woman in the Window, Man Hunt, Secret Beyond the Door), especially those first two which are classics.\n\nBut perhaps my favorite Joan Bennett performance is in a noir called Hollow Triumph, where she plays a smart, cynical secretary having an affair with her psychiatrist boss. Paul Henried is her co-star. There's a classic bit of dialogue where she expresses her disllusionment about romance and Henried remarks, \"You're a bitter little lady.\" Bennett replies, \"It's a bitter little world.\"\n\nIndeed.\n\nVanity Fair produced a good podcast about the scandal involving Bennett's husband, producer Walter Wanger, shooting Jennings Lang, Bennett's agent with whom she was having an affair. The podcast hosts are Karina Longworth and Bennett's granddaughter Vanessa Hope. The differing narrations/perspectives of Longworth and Hope are sometimes awkwardly mixed. Hope doesn't really add much and Longworth has much smarter things to say. Overall I think it would have worked better as a season on Longworth's podcast You Must Remember This, with Longworth as the sole narrator.\n\nBut it's still extremely interesting and well-done--and certainly well worth a listen if you have any interest at all in Bennett.\n\nIt's true that after the shooting Bennett's career was seriously damaged, while Wanger's career thrived, and that reflected a harsh sexual double standard. At the same time, Bennett was by then in her early 40s, and because of her age her career would probably have declined anyway, because at that time there were very few good parts for older women, and many other actresses of her generation also faced career troubles after age 40.\n\nWanger and Bennett finally divorced in 1965, after 25 years of marriage, and after that Bennett took up with a man named David Wilde, whom she eventually married and stayed married to until her death. Their relationship was . . . strange. Wilde was a cross-dresser and may well have been transgender.\n\nJoan Bennett made about six more films between playing a hooker in Scarlett Street (1945), and a suburban wife and mother in \"Father of the Bride\". Her remaining films mostly saw in wife/mother roles, with some more spicy than others. By \"spicy\" one means Joan Bennett played married women who strayed, but things worked out in end.\n\nJoan Bennett worked steadily after the shooting scandal, but mostly on stage and television. Though her marriage survived shooting incident, Joan Bennett's Hollywood career did not, she was largely passed over by studios.\n\n\"She made only five movies in the decade that followed the 1951 shooting incident, and only two films in the 1970s, for the incident was a stain on her career and she became virtually blacklisted. Blaming the scandal that occurred for destroying her career in the motion picture industry, Bennett once said, \"I might as well have pulled the trigger myself.\" Although Humphrey Bogart, a longtime friend, pleaded with Paramount Pictures on her behalf to keep her after her role as Amelie Ducotel in We're No Angels (1955), the studio refused.\"\n\nIt also didn't help Ms. Bennett was getting on, and as we know Hollywood had then very little use for \"older\" women. As the lyrics to famous song go \"first your another sloe eyed vamp, then someone's mother, then your camp\"...\n\n[quote] I wonder if Joan was threatened by Grayson, a recent Oscar nominee, not only joining the series, but also effectively eclipsing Joan as the female lead, even if Joan continued to get top billing?\n\nI watched an interview with Bennett with someone from the DS convention circuit, conducted at her home about 2 years before she died. She said she did not want to work as rigorously as she had the first year and liked being able to take time off from the show. My guess is they kept Grayson around to function as the defacto mistress of the house in order to give Bennett that time off (though it's also entirely possible that audiences weren't as interested in her). There was absolutely no reason for Julia to stick around, and she basically lived off the Collins' for 4 years.\n\nI always found it hilarious that Bennett would disappear sometimes for 2 dozen episodes or more. Where the fuck would she go? She never left the grounds of Collinwood. One episode midway through the run of the series, after Maggie became the governess, someone asked her who was home and she said, I've been the only one here all night (with the children). Where the hell were Elizabeth, Roger, Carolyn, the housekeeper and her son? That house was supposedly always filled with freeloaders yet no one was ever around.\n\nI think it's the absolute cheapness of the production, R111. I am in the middle of watching the entire series right now. I'm on episode 700, actually, the middle of the storyline where Quentin possesses David and Amy, so I've seen a lot in a short amount of time. The show was absolutely rushed in terms of writing, rehearsing and shooting. All of those actors were lucky to even be able to have the time to get the lines out of their mouths- forget about giving a performance. If Dan Curtis was going to shoot at such a breakneck speed and not allow for time to rehearse or even memorize lines, then he should have cast actors who were quick studies. If you don't have your lines down, it's nearly impossible to give a performance. Bennett was in the (larger) camp of those who were at sea with breakneck speed, which is one of the reasons I think she was glad to get so much time off.\n\nBut she was far from the worst offender, who was Frid, hands down. Frid was such a fucking joke on that show, it was maddening. I am having a real hard time trying to comprehend how he was such an idol because of that show. He was not attractive, he was a terrible actor, he never knew his lines and he went up and stuttered and wound up needing his scene partner to cover for him nearly every scene. And when you're playing a menacing vampire and you're mincing about, searching for your next word, the effect is somewhat lost. When they finally decided he wasn't cutting it as a villain and they took away his \"curse\" and made him a living human being again, he was completely useless.\n\nAt least Bennett didn't have to be anything other than regal. And Louis Edmonds was about as bad as Bennett was in terms of fluffing his lines, and Grayson Hall was even worse (though no one could touch Frid), but Edmonds was a good actor who had a very campy spirit and a great sense of humor, and Hall was just a dreadful overactor whose inability to learn dialogue just fed into her hamminess. Frid is the weakest link on Dark Shadows and I wish they would have jammed a stake through his heart after a year and found another villain.\n\n[quote] I think Frid's constant line flubbing and obvious nervousness unintentionally gave Barnabas some vulnerability and layers, rather than the one-dimensional villain he could've been, which is probably part of the reason he became so popular. Frid was no great actor or much in the looks department.\n\nSee, to me, it just comes off as unprepared. He isn't able to fold it into the character the way Grayson Hall did. Hall was not a great actress by any stretch, but she knew how to take her unpreparedness and make it part of the character. She played Hoffman as always nervous and high strung, and a little bit pre-menopausally horny. This was a woman who so badly wanted to get fucked by Barnabas but was too frigid a schoolmarm to actually do anything about it. And she somehow made it work. She completely had no validity as a doctor. There was one scene where she was checking a character's blood pressure and put the cuff on, squeezed the ball and never bothered to put the stethoscope in her ears, then proudly proclaimed the BP as normal. But it worked. You believed she was the most incompetent doctor who ever lived and pretty much glommed onto the Collins family before the AMA took her license away from her.\n\nFrom Louis Edmonds' biography, \"Big Lou,\" by Craig Hamrick:\n\n[quote] Louis' lover, Bryce Holman, never visited the set of Dark Shadows, however, he did get to know some of Louis' castmates, including Joan Bennett and Joel Crothers. \"Bryce met Joan because she would very sweetly invite both of us to her house in Scarsdale, New York, where we would be given a very delicious dinner and we would play bridge,\" Louis said. \"Bryce loved to play bridge.\"\n\n[quote] Louis appreciated Joan's acceptance of his off-screen companion as his domestic partner. \"Joan was absolutely dear,\" he said. \"She was real. And when she said, 'Hello, Bryce, it's so nice to see you,' she meant it. I think she was one of those people who had a little twinkle of love in her eyes that ignites it in other people's eyes.\" Joan often visited Louis and Bryce at the Rookery.\n\nI'm not saying that Joan Bennett was the best actress ever or anything, but she was playing the part of a woman who had not left her house for 18 years and who was haunted by the lie that she had murdered her husband. Plus she was New England aristocracy and trying to be the keeper of the family legacy and name. Her performance, at least to me, makes sense. It wasn't a showy role. I think Elizabeth, in the beginning, saw her key role as ensuring that troubled David, as he was the only male Collins, made it to adulthood to carry on the family name.\n\nThe only thing I can say about Jonathan Frid is that it was the 60s, a different time. Did anyone take a good hard look at the Beatles, not exactly Instagram thirst traps. Tastes were different. Plus Frid was playing a vampire, which probably helped his popularity. They went the hottie route with Adam, Chris/Tom Jennings, and Quentin.\n\nPeople forget how close she came to playing Scarlett after she she died her hair brunette in 1938. Only the four finalists were tested in Technicolor: Jean Arthur, Bennett, Paulette Goddard and Vivien. Arthur was never really in the running. Selznick just kept giving her tests to keep her happy because he was fucking her at the time. Selznick and Cukor both preferred Goddard to Bennett but Selznick had serious concerns about casting her because she had been living publicly with Charles Chaplin for several years but they couldn't produce a marriage license (they claimed they had been married on an ocean liner on a trip to Asia). That was a very big deal back then.\n\nOf course, Selznick's dark horse Vivien solved everything a few days later when she showed up in LA with Larry and her tests blew everyone else's out of the water.\n\nThe Frid film is on Tubi, as is (I believe) the Dan Curtis doc which is primarily about Dark Shadows. Both are fun watches (the Frid one a little less so because it felt stretched a bit thin) and Frid comes off well.\n\nAs much as I bitch about how bad an actor Frid is, I would like to recommend a film he did in the early 1970s called Seizure, which was Oliver Stone's first film, and also stars Herve Villechaize, Christina Pickles, Mary Woronov and Troy Donahue. It's a very odd horror movie, but in a good, eerie way. For years it was OOP, and was finally reissued on DVD about a decade ago, and then blu-ray a few years later.\n\nR223\n\nRead bio in R209.\n\nJonathan Frid was hugely famous in America at least for being Barnabas Collins on DS. Usually television productions would want something new and fresh instead of the old and familiar.\n\nThis and by 1980's or so supernatural as plot lines virtually faded out from American daytime soap operas. It was all about sex, money, more sex, more money, who was plotting or actually killed who, those sort of things.\n\nDark Shadows had heyday about same time as Bewitched and other programs featuring supernatural were all over television (1960's through about early to middle 1970's). By late 1970's they were all largely gone.\n\nDaytime soaps like evening television dramas by 1970's and certainly into 1980's began to go with more gritty plot lines to entice audiences. Abortion, adultery, unwed mothers, murder, theft, etc... were in; witches, warlocks, ghosts and vampires were out.\n\nEvening television soap drama \"SOAP\" did go there with a child supposedly fathered by the devil. But that was in keeping (IIRC) with taking a page from then highly rated film \"The Omen\", and of course \"Rosemary's Baby\".\n\nIt's funny how lead actors/characters would disappear for weeks, even months at a time. I think that Frid and Hall were the only two that worked consistently. I remember Kathryn Leigh Scott being gone for nearly two months between Josette dying in 1795 and Maggie's first appearance when they switched back to the present. They barely used Louis Edmonds after Roger became irrelevant after the swift conclusion of the Burke revenge story, and he really didn't appear very much until they went back to 1795, where he seemed to be on almost every day as Joshua. Then there were people who seemed to come and go, disappearing for an eternity, like John Karlen, Jerry Lacy, Diana Millay, Clarice Blackburn, etc.\n\nJoan Bennett settled into \"mother\" roles quite well. As Mrs. Stanley Banks in both \"Father of the Bride\" and \"Father's Little Dividend\", she played Ellie Banks perfectly.\n\nThe Banks weren't wealthy, but sort of solid middle to upper middle class making their way post WWII. Nice house in in the suburbs, Stanley Banks a steady attorney who makes partner at his firm..\n\nEllie Banks is pure cool Yankee patrician sort; not unlike Myrna Loy's Muriel Blanding (Mr. Blanding Builds His Dream House. These were college educated women who were practical, level headed (most of the time), and saw keeping up the home front as their part of the team that allowed their husbands to get on professionally.\n\nJoan Bennet was still rather young and an attractive woman in both Father of the Bride films. When Stanley Banks feels his wife on way out of door in clip below, Ellie's reaction is priceless.\n\nEllie Banks had a strong moral steak of what was right and wrong, and when certain things were appropriate or not. In \"Father of the Bride\" when Banks sit down to eat dinner Mr. Banks and his sons begin discussing something, and Ellie instantly disapproves and tells them to pipe down. She motions to \"her in there\" (nodding towards kitchen where their black maid was) and warning about \"her\" over hearing.\n\nMany actresses of Joan Bennett's generation detested being kicked down to \"mother roles\", but JB seems to have made most of what was on offer.\n\n[quote]It's odd they only had that one maid, Mrs. Johnson, to clean that huge mansion, and she didn't even arrive until a few months into the show when Burke placed her there to spy on the family.\n\nThat's why we had to close down the East Wing of the mansion...and eventually the West Wing too...\n\nand then...well, we were all forced to live in the Foyer, the Drawing Room, and that little room under the stairs.\n\nMrs. Johnson was actually the laziest cleaning woman I've ever encountered in all my life - she single-handedly drove one of the great mansion of New England into ruin.\n\nShe's the reason I often slept in the family mausoleum!\n\nI'd like to pitch a prequel to the 1960s Dark Shadows - a world in which the beautiful young debutante Elizabeth Collins is one of the most sought-after young women in New England - even having a serious romance with one of the Kennedy boys during her years at Middlebury College.\n\nHer younger brother Roger, equally handsome and sought-after, styled himself as a carefree-young tennis player who had no time for romance, (but plenty of time for sex with hot men, much to the disappointment of his parents).\n\nElizabeth eventually married a most handsome, elegant man who reminded her of a Collins relative whose portrait hung in the front hallway of Collingwood, Barnabas Collins.\n\nMr. Stoddard, of course, turned out to be a flaming homosexual (like her cousin Barnabas). But he left her with some beautiful jewels and designer clothing before his untimely demise. (Contrary to Elizabeth's face-saving stories, Mr. Stoddard actually left Collinsport with his young twink lover and with whom he opened a operated a very successful Fire Island Gay B & B for many years)\n\nElizabeth's daughter Carolyn was the product of a drunken night at the Blue Whale...was her real father Jason McGuire, Sam Evans, or some handsome unknown sailor?\n\nBesides Constance, Joan had another sister, Barbara Bennett.\n\nIncluded within this recap of The Bennett sisters:\n\n[quote] Things seemed to have turned in Barbara's favor when she married singer Morton Downey in 1929. They had 5 children (one of them talk-show host Morton Downey, Jr.) and their marriage seemed to be a happy one.\n\n[quote] However, things were apparently not what they seemed. Around 1940, Louise introduced Barbara to Addison Randall, a B Cowboy star she had been dating. Barbara apparently went gaga over Randall and left her family. Downey crucified her in court and Barbara lost custody of her 5 children. She and Randall married in 1941, but life was never easy for Barbara Bennett. As a result of an accident while filming a western, Randall suffered an injury and died in 1945. Barara married again, but, in 1958, committed suicide. Said friend Louise Brooks: \"Only her death, in 1958, achieved in her fifth suicide attempt, could be termed a success.\"\n\nIt's very interesting that they used so many actors for multiple roles. And I don't even mean the parallel time frames where they had a reason to do that. But for instance, someone like Roger Davis- he played a character who started in the 1795 timeline. Then he played a character in the 1968 timeline, but hw was supposed to be a reincarnation of the 1795 character, so it made sense. But then they brought him back months later as a 3rd character in 1969 who had zero ties to those other characters or their stories. Yet they had to for some reason acknowledge it was the same actor by saying- My god, you look just like so-and-so when it had nothing to do with anything. It was very odd. But I'm guessing if they found someone who could handle the schedule, they stuck with them.\n\nR276\n\nIt's almost as if Dark Shadows became a hit (far as some fans are concerned) in spit of itself.\n\nDan Curtis learned a few things by time Kolchak: The Night Stalker television series and film \"The Night Stalker\"\n\nDark Shadows OTOH was often a hot mess. It wasn't just the flubs, but choice of actors (and quality thereof) and other quibbles.\n\nDan Curtis tended to cast actors he knew for Dark Shadows, which was a plus as well as minus.\n\nDaytime soaps then and now long gave spots to new actors fresh out of school or whatever, but many clearly were better than others. In end ensemble cast along with DC became sort of a tight group which worked well one supposes in certain ways, but stunk in others.\n\nBarnabas Collins helped put Dark Shadows on the map, but Johnathan Frid simply was not a great or even that good of an actor. One might forgive his mistakes and flubs early on, as usually it takes a season before even best actor finds his or her character, but Johnathan Frid never really improved. But again since he by then was \"Barnabas Collins\", replacing him was not likely to happen, and the vampire storyline was a huge draw for DS audiences.\n\nLet's compare Joan Bennett and her sister Constance. When they were younger, Constance was always the more successful, more highly regarded sister. And if Dark Shadows had never happened, then she would likely be the more remembered one simply by reputation.\n\nBut Dark Shadows did happen and Joan was introduced to entire new generation of fans. What's more because of that show, her fandom has lasted another two generations beyond that.\n\nSo I don't believe anyone on here considers her time on Dark Shadows \"sad,\" R283. On the contrary, I think we're all fans who are celebrating it, despite the fact that we understand it was a somewhat silly show."
