Proudly raised in Lynn, she was the oldest of 5 children. Joan graduated from St. Mary’s High School in 1946. Soon after graduation she started her career as a secretary at the Chancery of the Boston Archdiocese and then at General Electric. It was there she met her true love, Jeremiah E. McQuillan. Joan and Jerry were married on April 20, 1968. They settled in Avon, CT and raised their family on Tamara Circle, where they met lifelong friends. Joan and Jerry had 23 wonderful years together, traveling, summering in Chatham, MA, attending Holy Cross football games, and spending time with family. After Jerry’s death in 1992, Joan moved to Middleton, MA to be closer to her siblings and childhood friends. She lived in Middleton for 26 years.\n\nJoan was fiercely devoted to her family and is survived by her two daughters, Sara Nicolai (Keith) of Chatham, MA and Alicia M. Bennett of Greenville, RI.
