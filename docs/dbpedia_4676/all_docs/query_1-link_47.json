        "meta_description": "Joan Evelyn Hofmann, 91, of Hamden, CT, died Sunday, July 21, 2024. Joan was born on September 25, 1932 in New Haven, CT to Frederick and Gertrude Durlach Hofmann. Joan graduated from The Day School in New Haven and earned a BA from Vassar College in 1954. After working various jobs at Yale and working in London for several years, Joan returned home to work as a librarian for the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale for over a decade. She then moved to Jackson Heights, NY in 1981 and became the Administrator of the Laboratory of Investigative Dermatology, established by Dr. Martin Carter at Rockefeller University, where she worked for over 20 years. She was well regarded by her coworkers and was described as “a kind person who was super-organized and always did work with high spirits and good humor. Many people in the laboratory—and beyond at the University— regularly sought her sage advice on a variety of personal and professional matters.” Joan’s love for her job and respect for her coworkers was very evident to family and friends. Joan was also an officer for her co-op and cherished her friends there. Joan had a thirst for knowledge, was a voracious reader, frequent museum and opera attendee and loved attending the various concert series at The Rockefeller.\nJoan is predeceased by her parents and her sister, Mary Louise Passarelli. She is lovingly survived by her brother-in-law Nicholas M. Passarelli, her niece Carol Passarelli Fedorchak and children Kathleen and Dean, her nephew James Passarelli (wife Marianne) and children Rachel and Natalie, and nephew Marc Passarelli (wife Alfia) and children Maria and Emily.\nA graveside service will be held at Beaverdale Memorial Park, 90 Pine Rock Ave., Section C, New Haven, CT on August 9th, 2024 at 1 p.m. To send a condolence to her family, please see her obituary at: www.beecherandbennett.com.",
