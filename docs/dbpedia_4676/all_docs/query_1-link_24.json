        "text": "Tag: Joan Bennett\n\n10 Things You Should Know About Lupe Vélez\n\nHere are 10 things you should know about Lupe Vélez, born 114 years ago today. Vélez, known for her spirited personality and fiery temper, died far too young.\n\n10 Things You Should Know About Donald Cook\n\nHere are 10 things you should know about Donald Cook, born 120 years ago today. He was the rare film actor who kept just as busy on the Broadway stage as he did in Hollywood.\n\n10 Things You Should Know About Joan Bennett\n\nHere are 10 things you should know about Joan Bennett, born 110 years ago today. She exhibited excellent range as an actress and enjoyed success on the stage, in films and on radio and TV.\n\nHappy 112th Birthday, Constance Bennett!\n\nActress Constance Bennett was born 112 years ago today in New York City. Here are 10 CB Did-You-Knows:\n\nBennett was born into a theatrical family. Both her parents, Richard Bennett and Adrienne Morrison, were actors, as was her maternal grandparents, Rose Wood and Lewis Morrison.\n\nBennett’s two sisters, Joan and Barbara, were also actresses (though Barbara’s career was brief), but it was Constance who was the first to enter motion pictures, appearing in silent pictures filmed in and around NYC and making her Hollywood debut in Cytherea (1924).\n\nAfter giving up films upon marrying Philip Plant in 1925, Bennett, after divorcing Plant, returned to her film career just as talking pictures were taking off.\n\nBennett was, for a brief time in the early 1930s, the highest paid actress in Hollywood.\n\nLike Kay Francis, Bennett’s ability to wear fine clothes well played a big role in her success.\n\nBennett Was cast in the role of Ellie Andrews in It Happened One Night but withdrew when Columbia Pictures declined to allow her to serve as producer of the film. Claudette Colbert, who took over the role, won the Best Actress Oscar for her work in the picture.\n\nBennett starred in the Janet Gaynor/Judy Garland/Barbra Streisand role in What Price Hollywood (1932), which was a clear inspiration for the A Star Is Born pictures.\n\nLess in demand in pictures by the 1940s, Bennett began working in radio and in the theatre. Her stage debut came in 1940 in Noël Coward‘s Easy Virtue.\n\nBennett Was married five times; the final marriage, to US Air Force Colonel (later Brigadier General) John Theron Coulter, lasted by far the longest—from June 1946 until Bennett’s death in July 1965.\n\nBecause of her marriage to Coulter and in recognition of her efforts in providing relief entertainment to US troops stationed in Europe during and after World War II, Bennett was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nHappy birthday, Constance Bennett, wherever you may be!\n\nHappy 106th Birthday, Joan Bennett!\n\nJoan Bennett, sister of Constance Bennett, another Cladrite favorite, was part of a theatrical family that went back to the 18th century. She had a few tiny bits in the silent era, but got really busy once talkies came in and acted into the early 1980s.\n\nBennett, who was born 106 years ago today in Pallisades, New Jersey, left a legacy in two of our favorite cinematic genres—Pre-Code and Film Noir—and we wish her the happiest of birthdays, wherever she may be."
