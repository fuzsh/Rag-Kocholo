        "text": "(1910–90). American actress Joan Bennett began her career in motion pictures but later was a regular on television. She was active in show business from the 1930s through the beginning of the 1980s.\n\nJoan Geraldine Bennett was born on February 27, 1910, in Palisades, New Jersey. Her father was the actor Richard Bennett, and her sisters were the actresses Constance Bennett and Barbara Bennett. Joan Bennett began her film career at the age of 19. Among the most notable of her many roles during the 1930s were as a wisecracking waitress in Me and My Gal (1932); as Amy, the youngest sister in Little Women (1933); and as a woman slipping into mental illness in Private Worlds (1935).\n\nBennett’s third husband, producer Walter Wanger, suggested that Bennett change her hair color from blonde to brunette, which led to her successes in leading roles. They included a series of film noirs directed by Fritz Lang, including Woman in the Window (1944) and Scarlet Street (1945), followed by Jean Renoir’s dark melodrama Woman on the Beach (1947). In 1950 Bennett won acclaim for a comic role as the mother in the film Father of the Bride.\n\nIn 1951 Wanger shot Bennett’s agent, believing the two to be lovers. Bennett’s film career declined drastically as a result. Bennett subsequently toured American theaters in stage productions and also appeared on television, including a regular role in the daytime supernatural soap opera Dark Shadows (1966–70). Her autobiography The Bennett Playbill was published in 1970. Bennett died on December 7, 1990, in Scarsdale, New York."
