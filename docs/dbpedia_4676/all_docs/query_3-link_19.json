        "text": "HER voice is still husky, her eyes are as arresting as ever, her mouth remains painted in a cupid's bow. She continues to perform in occasional movies, plays and television shows. Yet Joan Bennett, an actress who has been in more than 75 films and who was part of Hollywood's most glamorous period, today describes herself as ''just keeping house.''\n\n''I love the garden, the flowers, the house,'' she proclaims. ''I don't go to New York City any more than I have to.'' The 71-year-old Miss Bennett lives with her husband, David Wilde, in an 11-room Colonial-style home in Scarsdale. This evening, her long and distinguished career and her residency in the county will be acknowledged by Westchester Community College, when the school presents her with its first Communications and Media Arts Award.\n\n''She's been a great contributor, culturally speaking,'' said Joseph N. Hankin, president of the college. ''I view films as one of our cultural contributions in society; she has been in 75 films in half a century.''\n\nThe award, Mr. Hankin explained, coincides with the first year that the college will be offering associate degrees in communications and media arts. It will be presented at 5:30 at the college's Academic/Arts Center by the actress Myrna Loy, Chuck Scarborough, the television anchorman, and Robert Merrill, the opera singer, and will be followed by a champagne supper and a showing of the film ''Woman in the Window.'' Proceeds from the benefit will go to the Westchester Community College Foundation Academic Arts Fund, which helps support student arts projects and supplement activities in the arts center. (Tickets are $50 and $100 and are available at the door.)\n\nThe festival will continue Tuesday at 1:30 P.M. with screenings of two Joan Bennett films, ''Scarlet Street'' and ''Man Hunt,'' and Saturday at 1:30 P.M., when ''Little Women'' and ''Woman in the Window'' will be shown. Miss Bennett is scheduled to appear briefly at all films, and the public is invited free of charge.\n\n''I am very honored,'' Miss Bennett said recently of the award and festival. She also said she felt media curriculums such as the one the college has just instituted, are ''very good'' and that the cultural opportunities in this county are increasing.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
