        "text": "By Britta DeVore |\n\nThere’s no denying that since his appearance in 2022’s blockbuster super-hit, Top Gun: Maverick, Glen Powell’s career has taken off like – well – like jet fuel. One of the hottest actors of the time, the actor recently appeared in the box office-crushing rom-com Anyone But You and, most recently, the highly-anticipated Twisters. But if you want to see Powell in the days just before he would start jogging up the biggest stepping stones on his climb to the top, then look no further than Hulu as the actor’s hit horror comedy series, Scream Queens, is now streaming in its entirety."
