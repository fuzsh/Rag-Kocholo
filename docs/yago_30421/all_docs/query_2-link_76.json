        "text": "Welcome.\n\nWhether you are encountering everyday life stressors, relational conflicts, dealing with anxiety, adjusting to life transitions, walking through and grieving the death of a loved one, end of a relationship, beginning to heal from past trauma, or just wanting to feel better, therapy can be a place to share what you are experiencing and move through and beyond any pain, hurt or challenges.\n\nI create a supportive, safe environment where clients can comfortably and with confidence speak of their life experiences, gain a deeper understanding of and appreciation for who they are, while gaining the tools to meet and walk through life challenges and meet personal goals.\n\nAny moment is an opportunity to create life shifts and meaningful change. I believe that you have the ability to continue to discover and create the life you want."
