        "text": "Baseball is officially back, despite an Opening Day that had almost no nationally televised games. It should have been a day of wall-to-wall baseball if you ask me.\n\nSure there were games available to watch, but a Thursday afternoon at the end of March should have had several televised games. No worries, right? Social media is going to certainly pick up the slack.\n\nWell, not exactly. Initially, the day was fairly slow over on Instagram. There wasn't a ton of content flowing from influencers or some of baseball's biggest named WAGs.\n\nIt was so slow, in fact, a soccer influencer, two months out from her next planned major tournament, slid in and took some of the spotlight. Thankfully, we didn't go an entire Opening Day without some action.\n\nAileen Hnatiuk, best known as an NFL reporter, fired off a heater at 10:30 pm from Tropicana Field and let the algorithm know that baseball season had arrived. From there, hope that all was not lost on Opening Day had been restored.\n\nMLB hosts started popping up on timelines across platforms. That includes Kelly Nash, who made a cameo on Nightcaps on the eve of Opening Day. She dropped a \"BASEBALL IS BACK SNITCHES\" on Instagram that was the perfect welcome to the new season.\n\nKelly Nash Swung For The Fences With Her First Offering Of The New MLB Season\n\nLike Aileen's, it was much later in the evening than would be expected on Opening Days of the past. But, better late than never. And when you're getting into late, you have to bring your \"A\" game.\n\nKelly did that. The Quick Pitch host, and I get that the show is on late which could explain the late arriving content, hit the MLB Network field, Studio 42, and was heels on the artificial turf dirt.\n\nThis is a sport all about the numbers and Kelly Nash's first offering of the season to her 100k followers delivered a couple of hundred comments and 3,500 plus likes and counting. Not bad for taking a 6-week break between posts.\n\nWhile there might be some questions about whether her husband, free agent pitcher Dallas Keuchel, still has enough on his fastball, there aren't any questions about hers. She joined the MLB Network back in 2015 and is still bringing it."
