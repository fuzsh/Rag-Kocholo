        "text": "Bernard \"Noel\" Brennan, 83, formerly of Florham Park, NJ, more recently of Highland Park, NJ, passed away on September 28, 2022 at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, NJ.\n\nBorn in the county of Roscommon, Ireland, Noel came to the United States at the age of 12. He resided in West Orange and Florham Park before he moved to Highland Park two years ago. He graduated from West Orange High School in 1958.\n\nNoel proudly served his country in the U.S. Army from 1958-1964.\n\nNoel worked as a Principle Inspector for the NJDOT for 35 years; before retiring in 1996. In his spare time, Noel enjoyed being a member of the Frank O'Hara Association, Friends of the Shillelagh Club, Green Mountain Club, and The 200 Club. He also was an avid outdoorsman, who enjoyed hunting, fishing, and hiking. Noel will also be remembered as a practical joker with a dry sense of Irish humor.\n\nNoel is survived by his devoted children, Kelly Brennan, and Kevin Brennan, and his wife, Debbie. He is also survived by his adored grandson, Kyle Brennan; his dear sisters and brothers, Elizabeth (\"Lilly\") Richardson, Margaret (\"Maggie\") Abel, Christine Mulvaney, Ellen Nash; and Betty Ann Gillen; as well as his many cherished nieces and nephews, and their extended families. Noel was predeceased by his first wife, Dorothy Brennan (2008); his second wife, Maureen Flynn (2013); and his siblings, Patrick (\"Pakie\") Brennan, Mary Ellen (\"Nellie\") Bolan, Gertrude (\"Terry\") Tierney, Winnie (\"Una\") Flarity, and Attracta Critzer.\n\nA Memorial Mass for Noel will held on Wednesday, October 5, 2022 at 11:00am at The Pilgrim Chapel at The Shrine of Saint Joseph, 1050 Long Hill Road, Stirling, NJ. Interment of ashes will be private.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests donations in memory of Noel may be made to: St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (www.stjude.org).\n\nArrangements are under the care of Burroughs, Kohr & Dangler Funeral Home, Madison."
