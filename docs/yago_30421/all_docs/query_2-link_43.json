        "text": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nJoni Mitchell will open the vault this fall, unearthing gems and rarities from the late Seventies.\n\nJoni Mitchell Archives, Vol. 4: The Asylum Years (1976-1980) arrives Oct. 4 via Rhino Records. It documents the creative process behind her studio albums Hejira (1976), Don Juan’s Reckless Daughter (1977), and Mingus (her collaboration with jazz legend Charles Mingus in 1979). It also includes her time on Bob Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Revue tour in 1975 and 1976, as well as the Bread & Roses Festival and the Anti-Nuclear Rally.\n\nAhead of the release, Mitchell shared a live cut from the Rolling Thunder Revue tour when she introduced her future Hejira track “Coyote” to the stage in Montreal in December 1975.\n\n“It’s kinda like running away from home to join the circus,” she says of the trek. “Anyway I’ve got this tune that has been growing, started off with two verses and couple of nights later I added another one. Last night I got a fourth one. I think it’s finished, but I don’t know, maybe there’s a couple of more chapters to go. But it’s called ‘Coyote,’ and it goes like this.”\n\nVol. 4 will be released via CD and LP editions, both containing rare photos, liner notes, and a conversation between Mitchell and Cameron Crowe. Check out the track lists below.\n\nAs with her previous Archives releases, Vol. 4 is accompanied by The Asylum Albums (1976-1980), a box set of the remastered studio LPs she released earlier this summer. The series began with 2020’s Vol. 1: The Early Years (1963-1967), a documentation of her folkie days, followed by 2021’s Vol. 2: The Reprise Years (1968 To 1971) — the remastered release being The Reprise Albums (1968-1971). In 2022, she released Vol. 3: The Asylum Years (1972-1975) alongside The Asylum Albums (1972-1975).\n\nVol. 4 CD Track List\n\nDisc One:\n\nRolling Thunder Revue\n\nLive In Niagara Falls\n\nConvention Center, Niagara Falls, NY, November 15, 1975\n\nRecorded by L.A.
