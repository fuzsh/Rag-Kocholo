        "text": "Last Thursday Llanview lost one of its most popular residents, and at the same time One Life to Live fans everywhere became overwhelmed with grief by the death of Nash Brennan (Forbes March).\n\nSound a bit too melodramatic? Maybe, but I couldn’t ignore all of the outpouring posts left under the daily recap surrounding Nash’s death or left in our messages boards without giving the character, and the amazing actor who played him, a proper send off.\n\nAlthough I found out, back on April 29, 2008, that Forbes March would be leaving his role, I’ll admit, there hasn’t been an episode in daytime that has brought me to my knees and had me reaching for a ton of tissues like Nash’s death. All I can say is I’m glad that I don’t have to look at the keys on my keyboard in order to type or I never would have been able to bring you all the recap for that episode. I was literally bawling my head off – as were many fans around the world who watched Nash take his final breath after tracing a heart shape on Jessica’s (Bree Williamson) palm.\n\nSince coming to the show in July of 2005, Nash has had to fight for the affection of fans, especially Jessica/Antonio fans. However, after their affair broke up that married, fans didn’t become totally sold on the Jessica/Nash union until Jessica’s near death. It was then that the love between Nash and Jessica became ‘real’ and nothing about her alter Tess.\n\nWhile I love all the actors on the show and feel their pain when they move on and leave their beloved characters behind, it killed me to have to mark ‘past’ next to Nash’s/Forbes’ name in his profile under our One Life to Live Cast List. But, this is daytime after all, and as fans we’ve been forced to deal with these types of disappointments in the past and will continue to do so in the future.\n\nI know I can speak for a lot of fans when I say… Forbes, we are going to miss you dearly and have enjoyed watching you for the last three years. We wish you the very best and hope to see you in daytime again very soon! Speaking of which, there have been some rumors circulating the net claiming that Forbes has been spotted in the General Hospital studios. However, at this time, there has been no word on a possible west coast role for the actor.\n\nTo close out Soaps.com’s In Memory, I have to give props to Bree Williamson (Jessica) for her fabulous performance. Her tears, like ours, were real, and Bree’s scenes were definitely Emmy deserving!"
