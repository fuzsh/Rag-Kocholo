        "text": "Matilda (c.February 7, 1102 – September 10, 1167) was born at Sutton Courtenay, in Berkshire to King Henry I of England and Duke of Normandy, and his first wife, Matilda of Scotland.\n\nMatilda of Scotland was the daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and the Anglo-Saxon princess Margaret of Wessex, who was born in the Kingdom of Hungary to the expatriate English prince Edward the Exile, Margaret and her family returned to England in 1057.\n\nFollowing the death of KingbHarold II Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, her brother Edgar Ætheling was elected as King of the English but never crowned and never reigned.\n\nMargaret of Wessex’s father, Prince Edward the Exile (1016 – 1057), also called Edward Ætheling, was the son of King Edmund Ironside of the English and of Ealdgyth. Historians are unsure of the identity of Ealdgyth, that may or not have been her name. She was first the wife of Sigeferth son of Earngrim, thegn of the Seven Burghs, and later of King Edmund Ironside.\n\nPrince Edward the Exile spent most of his life in exile in the Kingdom of Hungary following the defeat of his father by King Canute of Denmark and England.\n\nKing Henry I was the youngest son of William the Conqueror, who had invaded England in 1066, creating an empire stretching into Wales.\n\nThe daughter and heir of King Henry I of England, Matilda went to Germany as a child when she was married to the future Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich V.\n\nEmperor Heinrich V was the fourth and last ruler from the Salian Dynasty. He was made co-ruler by his father, Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich IV, in 1098. His mother was Bertha of Savoy daughter of Otto, Count of Savoy and his wife Adelaide of Susa from the Arduinici noble family, and as such a member of the Burgundian House of Savoy.\n\nMatilda travelled with the Emperor to Italy in 1116, was controversially crowned Empress in St Peter’s Basilica, and acted as the imperial regent in Italy. Matilda and Heinrich V had no children, and when he died in 1125, the imperial crown was claimed by his rival Lothair of Supplinburg.\n\nUpon her widowhood in the Holy Roman Empire, Matilda was recalled to Normandy by her father, who arranged for her to marry Geoffrey of Anjou to form an alliance to protect his southern borders in France.\n\nMatilda’s younger and only full brother, William Adelin, died in the White Ship disaster of 1120, leaving Matilda’s father and realm facing a potential succession crisis. Henry I had no further legitimate children and nominated Matilda as his heir, making his court swear an oath of loyalty to her and her successors, but the decision was not popular in his Anglo-Norman court.\n\nKing Henry died in 1135, but Matilda and Geoffrey faced opposition from the barons. The throne was instead taken by Matilda’s male cousin Prince Stephen, Count of Blois, who enjoyed the backing of the English Church and was proclaimed King in place of Empress Matilda. Stephen took steps to solidify his new regime but faced threats both from neighbouring powers and from opponents within his kingdom.\n\nThis usurpation by Stephen of Blois resulted in the period of English history known as the Anarchy which was a Civil War in England and Normandy between 1138 and 1153, which resulted in a widespread breakdown in law and order.\n\nAfter many years of Civil War the Treaty of Wallingford allowed Stephen to retain the throne but recognised Matilda’s son, Prince Henry Curtmantle (also know as Henry Fitzempress)as his successor.\n\nOver the following year, Stephen began to reassert his authority over the whole kingdom, but died of disease in 1154. Henry was crowned as King Henry II of Englandl0, the first Angevin king of England, then began a long period of reconstruction.\n\nThe conflict had been considered particularly destructive\n\nEmpress Matilda worked extensively with the Church, founding Cistercian monasteries, and was known for her piety. She was buried under the high altar at Bec Abbey after her death in 1167, until much later her tomb was moved to Rouen Cathedral.\n\nOn February 13, 1820, tragedy struck when Prince Charles Philippe, Count of Artois’ younger son, Prince Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, was assassinated by the anti-Bourbon and Bonapartist sympathiser Louis Pierre Louvel, a saddler.\n\nSoon after, the royal family was cheered when it was learned that Princess Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Two Siciles, Duchess of Berry was pregnant at the time of her husband’s death. On September 29, 1820, she gave birth to a son, Prince Henri, Duke of Bordeaux, the so-called “Miracle child”, who later, as the Bourbon pretender to the French throne, assumed the title of Count of Chambord.\n\nMadame la Dauphine\n\nKing Louis XVIII died on September 16, 1824, and was succeeded by his younger brother, the Count of Artois, as King Charles X of France and Navarre. Princess Marie-Thérèse’s husband, Prince Louis Antoine, was now heir to the throne, and she was addressed as Madame la Dauphine. She is the only Dauphine whose father was a former King of France. However, anti-monarchist feeling was on the rise again. King Charles X’s ultra-royalist sympathies alienated many members of the working and middle classes.\n\nThe French Revolution of 1830, also known as the July Revolution (French: révolution de Juillet), Second French Revolution, or Trois Glorieuses (“Three Glorious Days”), was a second French Revolution after the first in 1789. It led to the overthrow of King Charles X.\n\nOn August 2, 1830, after Les Trois Glorieuses, the Revolution of July 1830\n\nKing Charles X abdicated, bypassing his son the Dauphin in favor of his grandson Prince Henri, Duke of Bordeaux, who was not yet ten years old. At first, the Duke of Angoulême (the Dauphin) refused to countersign the document renouncing his rights to the throne of France.\n\nAccording to the Duchess of Maillé, “there was a strong altercation between the father and the son. We could hear their voices in the next room.” Finally, after twenty minutes, the Duke of Angoulême reluctantly countersigned his father’s declaration:\n\n“My cousin, I am too deeply pained by the ills that afflict or could threaten my people, not to seek means of avoiding them. Therefore, I have made the resolution to abdicate the crown in favor of my grandson, the Duke of Bordeaux. The Dauphin, who shares my feelings, also renounces his rights in favor of his nephew.”\n\nIt will thus fall to you, in your capacity as Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, to proclaim the accession of the Duke of Bordeaux (King Henri V) to the throne. Furthermore, you will take all pertinent measures to regulate the forms of government during the new king’s minority. Here, I limit myself to stating these arrangements, as a means of avoiding further evils. You will communicate my intentions to the diplomatic corps, and you will let me know as soon as possible the proclamation by which my grandson will be recognized as king under the name of King Henri V.”\n\nFor this twenty minute period the Dauphin is considered to have been King Louis XIX of France and Navarre.\n\nKing Charles X named Prince Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans, ascLieutenant général du royaume, and charged him to announce his desire to have his grandson succeed him to the popularly elected Chamber of Deputies.\n\nPrince Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans, did not do this, in order to increase his own chances of succession. As a consequence, because the chamber was aware of his liberal policies and of his popularity with the masses, they proclaimed Prince Louis Philippe as the new French king, displacing the senior branch of the House of Bourbon. For the prior eleven days Prince Louis Philippe had been acting as the regent for the young King Henri V.\n\nCharles X and his family, including his grandson, went into exile in the United Kingdom. The young ex-king, the Duke of Bordeaux, in exile took the title of Comte de Chambord. Later he became the pretender to the throne of France and was supported by the Légitimists.\n\nOn August 4, in a long cortège, Marie-Thérèse left Rambouillet for a new exile with her uncle, her husband, her young nephew, as well as his mother, the Duchess of Berry, and his sister Louise Marie Thérèse d’Artois. On August 16, the family had reached the port of Cherbourg where they boarded a ship for Britain. King Louis-Philippe had taken care of the arrangements for the departure and sailing of his cousins.\n\nJune 1832, two years after the overthrow of Charles X, an unsuccessful royalist insurrection in the Vendée was led by Princess Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Two Siciles, widow of Charles Ferdinand, in an attempt to restore their son Henri, Comte de Chambord to the French throne.\n\nBianca Lancia d’Agliano (also called Beatrice, c. 1210 – c. 1248), was an Italian noblewoman. She was the mistress and later, possibly the last wife of the Hohenstaufen Emperor Friedrich II. The marriage was conducted while she was on her deathbed, therefore it was considered non-canonical.\n\nLife\n\nBianca lived most of her life at the Castello di Brolo, the ancestral seat of the Lancia family. It is not known when her relationship with Emperor Friedrich II began and how long it lasted. It is widely believed that her meeting with the Emperor took place in 1225, when he married Queen Isabella II of Jerusalem.\n\nAccording to Renato Bordone, it is unlikely that the Emperor met her in Agliano in 1225; in fact their meeting would have taken place between 1226 and 1230 in Sicily. In any case, the children of Bianca and Friedrich II were born in the period after the death of Queen Isabella II of Jerusalem in 1228, and before the Emperor’s third marriage to Isabella of England, which took place in 1235.\n\nIssue and possible marriage\n\nBoth the chronicles of Salimbene di Adam and Matthew Paris wrote that a “marriage ceremony at the moment of death” (Latin: confirmatio matrimonii in articulo mortis) took place between Bianca Lancia and Emperor Friedich II when she was dying.\n\nAs Matthew Paris writes, Bianca wanted to marry for the salvation of her soul and the safety of her children’s future, who were subsequently legitimated (Latin: legitimatio per matrimonium subsequens). With this, the Emperor probably also wanted to increase the number of his legitimate descendants and possible successors. The Church did not recognize this marriage as canonical. Matthew Paris also writes that the circumstances of the marriage were kept secret: there are neither witnesses nor any records.\n\nThere is only circumstantial evidence that this marriage took place. In 1250, in Friedrich II’s will, Manfred was recognized and mentioned as a legitimate son. At the same time, on April 21, 1247, when he married, was under the name of “Manfred Lancia”. This means that Manfred was legitimized between 1247 and 1250.\n\nBianca and Frederick II had three children together:\n\n1. Constance (1230 – April 1307), who married the Emperor of Nicea, John Vatatzes in 1244, and thereupon her name changed to Anna.\n\n2. Manfred (1232 – 26 February 1266), who succeeded his father as ruler of Sicily (initially as regent, before usurping the throne for himself).\n\n3. Violante (1233 – 1264), who married Richard Sanseverino, Count of Caserta in 1246 and had a son, Corrad. She died during an other childbirth.\n\nThe Chronica regia Coloniensis and Salimbene di Adam mention her, although they do not mention her name.\n\nDeath\n\nContemporary sources, such as the Annales ianuenses, dated Bianca’s death between 1234 and 1246. For example, Matthew Paris reported that Bianca died 20 years after the first meeting with Emperor Friedich II. This gives approximately 1246. Elsewhere, the chronicler wrote that this was 20 years before 1256, indicating around 1236.\n\nHowever, since marriage to the Emperor was a necessary condition for legitimizing his children, it must be admitted that she died no earlier than 1247. At the same time, Bianca probably died before Emperor Friedrich II, since the castle of Monte Sant’Angelo, located in the cities of Vieste and Siponto (which, according to King William II of Sicily’s will, was the traditional possession of the Queens of Sicily as a “gift morning” after the wedding night and would remain in their possession as a dower), was granted by the Emperor to his son Manfred.\n\nAlfonso VII (March 1, 1105 – August 21, 1157), called the Emperor (el Emperador), became the King of Galicia in 1111 and King of León and Castile in 1126. Alfonso, born Alfonso Raimúndez, first used the title Emperor of All Spain, alongside his mother Urraca, once she vested him with the direct rule of Toledo in 1116. Alfonso later held another investiture in 1135 in a grand ceremony reasserting his claims to the imperial title. He was the son of Urraca of León and Raymond of Burgundy, the first of the House of Ivrea to rule in the Iberian peninsula.\n\nAlfonso was a dignified and somewhat enigmatic figure. His rule was characterised by the renewed supremacy of the western kingdoms of Christian Iberia over the eastern (Navarre and Aragón) after the reign of Alfonso the Battler. Though he sought to make the imperial title meaningful in practice to both Christian and Muslim populations, his hegemonic intentions never saw fruition. During his tenure, Portugal became de facto independent, in 1128, and was recognized as de jure independent, in 1143. He was a patron of poets, including, probably, the troubadour Marcabru.\n\nSuccession to three kingdoms\n\nIn 1111, Diego Gelmírez, Bishop of Compostela and the count of Traba, crowned and anointed Alfonso King of Galicia in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. He was a child, but his mother had (1109) succeeded to the united throne of León-Castile-Galicia and wished to retain the sole rulership of the kingdom.\n\nBy 1125 he had inherited the formerly Muslim Kingdom of Toledo. On March 10, 1126, after the death of his mother, he was crowned in León and immediately began the recovery of the Kingdom of Castile, which was then under the domination of Alfonso the Battler.\n\nBy the Peace of Támara of 1127, the Battler recognised Alfonso VII of Castile. The territory in the far east of his dominion, however, had gained much independence during the rule of his mother and experienced many rebellions. After his recognition in Castile, Alfonso fought to curb the autonomy of the local barons.\n\nOn May 26, 1135, Alfonso VII was crowned “Emperor of Spain” in the Cathedral of León. By this, he probably wished to assert his authority over the entire peninsula and his absolute leadership of the Reconquista. He appears to have striven for the formation of a national unity which Spain had never possessed since the fall of the Visigothic kingdom.\n\nThe elements he had to deal with could not be welded together. The weakness of Aragon enabled him to make his superiority effective. After Afonso Henriques recognised him as liege in 1137, Alfonso VII lost the Battle of Valdevez in 1141 thereby affirming Portugal’s independence in the Treaty of Zamora (1143). In 1143, he himself recognised this status quo and consented to the marriage of Petronila of Aragon with Ramon Berenguer IV, a union which combined Aragon and Catalonia into the Crown of Aragon.\n\nA vague tradition had always assigned the title of emperor to the sovereign who held León. Sancho the Great considered the city the imperiale culmen and minted coins with the inscription Imperator totius Hispaniae after being crowned in it. Such a sovereign was considered the most direct representative of the Visigothic kings, who had been themselves the representatives of the Roman Empire. But though appearing in charters, and claimed by Alfonso VI of León and Alfonso the Battler, the title had been little more than a flourish of rhetoric.\n\nIn November 1128, he married Berenguela, daughter of Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona. She died in 1149. She was the daughter of Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, and Douce I, Countess of Provence.\n\nIn 1152, Alfonso married Richeza of Poland, the daughter of Ladislaus II the Exile. Richeza was the third child and only daughter of Władysław II the Exile, the High Duke of Poland and ruler of Silesia, by his wife Agnes of Babenberg, daughter of Margrave Leopold III of Austria and half-sister of Conrad III, King of the Romans.\n\nFrom The Emperor’s Desk: Prior to the Coronation of King Charles III of the United Kingdom I had been working on my series “Are They A Usurper?” aand my topic had been King Richard III of England. I would like to conclude my evaluation of King Richard III.\n\nMy verdict, quite simply, is yes I believe King Richard III usurped the throne from his nephew, and the rightful King, Edward V.\n\nAs previously mentioned the case hinged on the legality of the marriage of King Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. It is alleged that Edward IV had a pre-contracted betrothal to Lady Eleanor Butler. There is no evidence of such a pre-contract.\n\nThe Richard III Society has an excellent article online addressing this topic.\n\n“The fact of the pre-contract cannot now be proved, although it could have been known to many persons in 1483, but there is no doubt that Edward’s marriage to Elizabeth was clandestine.”\n\nThe author of the article admits that there is no historical evidence that the pre-contract existed. The author of the article even states the pre-contract “could have been known to many persons in 1483” with emphasis on the words “could have” which demonstrates that there was no evidence in 1483 for the pre-contract. The article goes on to justify Richard III taking the throne based on the clandestine nature of Edward IV’s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville.\n\nAnother point is the entire questioning of Edward IV’s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville suddenly after all these years. It’s too convenient: we have the young under aged and helpless Edward V, with Richard, Duke of Gloucester in control – who had a long history of tension and animosity toward Elizabeth Woodville, and suddenly along comes information that makes Richard the rightful king. As I said there had not been a sniff of this before. Sorry, it’s just too easy.\n\nIn conclusion. Although I do see Richard III as a usurper I don’t go as far to demonize him and to suggest that he was a bad King. As I mentioned at the beginning of the series on Richard III, I was not going to address whether or not he was the one who had his nephews, the Princess in the Tower, murdered. If they were even murdered at all. Those are topics for another day.\n\nThere was a lot of Tudor propaganda aimed to demonize Richard III. That’s understandable given that Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, defeated King Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field to take the throne.\n\nI think we need to see Richard III in light of his contemporaries and the times in which he lived. From the Wars of the Roses to his defeat at Bosworth Field, the fact that Richard may have been ambitious and power-hungry towards the throne does not make him unique to the times whatsoever. History of the era shows that lusting for power and lusting for the throne was pretty common place.\n\nAlso, his short rain and defeat and with the possible association with the mysterious disappearance of the Princes in the Tower, overshadow the fact that while he was king, Richard III did do some good.\n\nI will examine the reign of Richard III more closely.\n\nWhen I began examining whether or not King Richard III was a usurper it seemed pretty cut and dried given the fact that Richard’s reputation as a usurper is well known. I’d even go as far to say that Richard III is the best known super in history.\n\nAs I’ve researched this topic I’ve realized that it’s isn’t as cut and dried as generally thought. I actually could drag this topic out over many more entries. In this entry I will examine the “pro-Richard III” stance. Then in the following entry next week I will examine the “anti-Richard III” stance. After that I will give you my assessment.\n\nAs I said in previous entries the legality of Richard III’s reign, as mentioned in the Titulus Regius document, rests on the core claim that when Edward IV married Elizabeth Woodville, he was already promised in marriage to Lady Eleanor Butler. This pre-contract, according to the laws of the day, would make his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville null and void.\n\nHowever, the issues that Titulus Regius outlines which make King Edward IV’s reign illegal stretch beyond the pre-contract with Lady Eleanor Butler (Talbot). The issues which Titulus Regius claims makes Edward IV’s reign illegitimate are:\n\n1) The kingdom was badly ruled and the laws and customs of the land flouted\n\n2) The Queen (Elizabeth Woodville) was guilty of witchcraft\n\n3) Edward got married secretly against the customs of the church\n\n4) Edward was already bethrothed – so the marriage and its offspring were illegitimate\n\n5) George, Duke of Clarence was attainted by parliament- so his son is also illegitimate\n\nAnd so in conclusion, Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester and his line has the only rightful claim to the throne.\n\nWere these claims valid? If based on fact, the petition had a case to be answered.\n\nIn my research I’ve read a considerable amount of information from the Richard III Society.\n\nThe Richard III Society was founded in 1924 by Liverpool surgeon Samuel Saxon Barton (1892-1957) as The Fellowship of the White Boar, Richard’s badge and a symbol of the Yorkist army in the Wars of the Roses. Its membership was originally a small group of interested amateur historians whose aim was to bring about a re-assessment of the reputation of Richard III.\n\nThe Fellowship of the White Boar was renamed The Richard III Society in 1959.\n\nIn 1980, Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, became the society’s Patron. (Richard III was Duke of Gloucester before ascending the throne, therefore he was before his accession (Prince) Richard, Duke of Gloucester).\n\nIn 1986, the society established the Richard III and Yorkist History Trust, a registered charity, to advance research and publication related to the history of late medieval England.\n\nThe society publishes a scholarly journal, The Ricardian.\n\nThe Richard III Society supports the Titulus Regius document along with validity of the pre-contract. However, the Society does admit that the historical accuracy of the pre-contract cannot be proven:\n\n“The fact of the pre-contract cannot now be proved, although it could have been known to many persons in 1483, but there is no doubt that Edward’s marriage to Elizabeth was clandestine.”\n\nMarriage and betrothal was easy in the middle ages – no need for priests, banns all the rest of it – you just had to tell each other you married each other. So, secret or not, a pre-contract was valid. However, the process of banns being proclaimed did work in favor of those that supported Richard III.\n\nDespite that, Edward’s secret marriage to Elizabeth Woodville was held against them; because it suggested bad faith by the king and/or Queen – they went ahead and got married without the light of publicity that might have exposed the existence of an impediment, namely, the pre-contract.\n\nAlthough Lady Eleanor Butler was dead by the time the Queen Elizabeth gave birth, that didn’t matter back then; for if Edward IV was in fact a bigamist, this stain on his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville could have been cleared and forgiven if reviewed in some way by an ecclesiastical court, which hadn’t happened.\n\nThe fact that an ecclesiastical court did not address the marriage could help the pro-Richard III” stance with their claim that the pre-contract remained was valid. The fact that an ecclesiastical court did not address the marriage could help the pro-Richard III” stance by claiming there was no need for the examination of the Royal marriage because the pre-contract was a work of fiction.\n\nThe Richard III Society also states that the fact that the marriage between King Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville was Clandestine is another factor in the establishment of the illegality of the union.\n\nAlthough a clandestine marriage (a marriage conducted in secret) was deemed legal in many cases and the children born of such a marriage were considered legitimate; what made a clandestine union like the marriage between King Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville suspect was because it blocked the legal repercussions in case there were pre-existing impediments such as the aforementioned pre-contract which would mean any such marriage was made in error and would be considered fraudulent.\n\nIf such a clandestine union that covered up legal impediments occurred any children produced by the union would be illegitimate.\n\nBack in the day pre-contractual unions had the ritual of the “calling of banns” which aimed to publicise a proposed marriage and prevent such misfortunes, and to proclaim the good faith of the contracting parties. Edward’s hasty and secret marriage to Elizabeth proclaimed his bad faith: if the banns had been called and his councillors informed, the impediment of the pre contract might have been revealed and circumvented.\n\nIt is theorized that had their marriage obeyed the church’s laws and had not been clandestine, their many years which Edward IV and Elizabeth lived together openly as man and wife would have been in favour of the legitimacy of the children of their union.\n\nBut because of the Clandestine nature of their union, Canon Law allowed questions of legitimacy to be raised after the parent’s deaths. Immoral or wrong behavior, such as adultery or bigamy, was not excused by the passage of time. Medieval Canon Law allowed Richard, Duke of Gloucester to raise the question of the children’s legitimacy as late as 1483.\n\nFrom the Emperor’s Desk: As I focus on the issues surrounding Richard III becoming King I will not be addressing the fate of the Princes in the Tower. Although it is a related topic, I view it as a separate issue, for their fate was a result of Richard taking the throne, therefore I will address that in another blog entry in the near future.\n\nKing Richard III succeeded to the English throne based on the claims of Titulus Regius. Titulus Regius (“royal title” in Latin) is a statute of the Parliament of England issued in 1484 by which the title of King of England was given to Richard III.\n\nThe act ratified the declaration of the Lords and the members of the House of Commons a year earlier that the marriage of King Edward IV of England to Elizabeth Woodville had been invalid and so their children, including King Edward V, Richard and Elizabeth, were illegitimate and thus debarred from the throne.\n\nRichard III had been proclaimed the rightful king. Since the Lords and the Commons had not been officially convened as a parliament, doubts had arisen as to its validity and so when Parliament convened, it enacted the declaration as a law.\n\nEdward’s marriage was invalidated because Bishop Robert Stillington testified that the king had precontracted a marriage to Lady Eleanor Butler. The document also claimed that Elizabeth Woodville and her mother had used witchcraft to get the king to marry her.\n\nSince Richard’s brother George, Duke of Clarence, had been executed and attainted, his descendants forfeited all rights to the throne, leaving Richard the true heir. For good measure, the document also hinted that George and Edward (born in Ireland and Normandy, respectively) were themselves illegitimate and stated Richard, “born within this land” was the “undoubted son and heir of Richard, late Duke of York”.\n\nIf Bishop Robert Stillington was correct and King Edward IV had pre-contract with Lady Eleanor Butler (Talbot) then his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville would have been invalid.\n\nAfter the overthrow and death of King Richard III at the hands of Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, the precontract alleged by Richard was presented as a fiction to justify Richard’s usurpation of power and to cover his murder of the princes. Some historians have agreed with this view. Supporters of Richard, however, have argued that the precontract was real and that it legitimised his accession to the throne.\n\nWhat do we know of Lady Eleanor Butler (Talbot)?\n\nLady Eleanor Talbot (c. 1436 – June 1468), also known by her married name Eleanor Butler (or Boteler), was an English noblewoman. She was a daughter of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury.\n\nIn 1449, 13-year-old Eleanor married Sir Thomas Butler (or Boteler), son of Ralph Boteler, Lord Sudeley. Thomas died at an unknown date before Edward IV of England’s overthrow of the House of Lancaster on 4 March 1461. Her father-in-law Lord Sudeley took back one of the two manors he had settled on her and her husband when they married, even though he did not have a license for the transfer. Edward seized both properties after he became king.\n\nEleanor died in June 1468. She was buried on 30 June in Norwich.\n\nBecause author Philippe de Commines does not name the “beautiful young lady”, and the official copy of Titulus Regius in parliament had been destroyed, Tudor historians confused Talbot with Edward’s long-standing mistress Elizabeth Lucy (also known as Elizabeth Wayte). Elizabeth Lucy was probably the mother of Edward IV’s bastard son, Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle.\n\nThomas More in his life of Richard III states that Lucy was interrogated at the time of Edward’s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, because Edward’s mother was strongly opposed to the marriage and had suggested that Edward was pre-contracted to Lucy. But Lucy denied that any contract had been made. He says that Richard revived the claim of Lucy after Edward’s death.\n\nThis threw further doubt on the case, but later historians correctly identified her. George Buck, who found the only surviving copy of Titulus Regius, was the first to identify Eleanor Talbot as the woman in question. Buck, a defender of Richard, accepted the validity of the precontract. His view has been followed by many defenders of Richard since, including Horace Walpole and Clements Markham.\n\nLater Ricardians have also either accepted it as fact, or argued that Richard sincerely believed it to be true. It is also commonly argued by Ricardians that Stillington was imprisoned by Edward IV in 1478 because he incautiously spoke of the precontract to George, Duke of Clarence.\n\nPart V will come next week.\n\nMaria II (April 4, 1819 – November 15, 1853) was Queen of Portugal from 1826 to 1828, and again from 1834 to 1853. One of the two surviving children born when future King Pedro IV was still heir apparent to Portugal, she inherited Portuguese titles and was placed in the line of succession to the former Portuguese throne, even after becoming a member of the Brazilian imperial family, from which she was excluded in 1835 after her definitive ascension to the Portuguese throne.\n\nBirth\n\nMaria II was born Infanta Maria da Glória on April 4, 1819 in the Palace of São Cristóvão in Rio de Janeiro, Kingdom of Brazil. She was the eldest daughter of Prince Dom Pedro de Alcântara, future King of Portugal as Pedro IV and first Emperor of Brazil as Pedro I, and his first wife Archduchess Caroline of Austria, herself a daughter of Franz II, Holy Roman Emperor and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily.\n\nInfanta Maria da Glória was titled Princess of Beira upon her birth. Born in Brazil, Maria was the only European monarch to have been born outside of Europe, though she was still born in Portuguese territory.\n\nHer father, Infante Pedro of Portugal, living in Brazil after the Portuguese Royal Family escaped there in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars, was acclaimed Emperor Pedro I on his 24th birthday, which coincided with the inauguration of the Empire of Brazil on October 12. He was crowned on December 1 in what is today known as the Old Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nSuccession crisis\n\nThe death of Maria’s grandfather, King João VI of Portugal in March 1826 sparked a succession crisis in Portugal. Before his death, the king had nominated his favourite daughter, Dona Isabel Maria, to serve as regent until “the legitimate heir returned to the kingdom” — but he had failed to specify which of his sons was the legitimate heir: the liberal Emperor Pedro I or the absolutist, exiled Miguel. However, Infante Miguel, had been exiled to Austria after leading a number of revolutions against his father and his liberal regime.\n\nMost people considered Pedro to be the legitimate heir, but Brazil did not want him to unite Portugal and Brazil’s thrones again. Aware that his brother’s supporters were ready to bring Miguel back and put him on the throne.\n\nThe Emperor was proclaimed King on March 10, 1826, and succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Pedro IV.\n\nAware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable to the people of both nations. Pedro decided for a more consensual option: he would renounce his claim to the Portuguese throne in favor of his eldest daughter Maria (who was only seven years old). His abdication on May 2 was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and Maria II was to marry his brother Miguel (her uncle) who would accept the liberal constitution and act as a regent until his niece reached the age of majority.\n\nMiguel pretended to accept, but upon his arrival in Portugal, he immediately deposed Maria II and proclaimed himself King of Portugal on June 23, 1828. Then began the Liberal Wars that lasted until 1834. King Miguel abrogating the liberal constitution in the process. During his reign, Maria traveled to many European courts, including her maternal grandfather’s in Vienna, as well as London and Paris.\n\nAfter a three-year civil war, Miguel I was forced to abdicate at the Concession of Evoramonte (May 26, 1834). Miguel embarked on June 1, 1834 on a British warship from Sines bound for Genoa; he lived in exile first in Italy, then in England, and finally in Germany. He never returned to Portugal.\n\nMaria was thereupon restored to the throne, and obtained an annulment of her betrothal. Soon after her restoration to the throne, her father died from tuberculosis.\n\nOccupying the Portuguese throne, Maria II was still heir presumptive to her brother Emperor Pedro II of Brazil as Princess Imperial of Brazil, until her exclusion from the Brazilian line of succession by law no. 91 of October 30, 1835.\n\nQueen Maria II married Auguste, Duke of Leuchtenberg, son of Eugène de Beauharnais and grandson of the Empress Josephine of France, on 26 January 26, 1835, at the age of fifteen. However, he died only two months later, on March 28, 1835.\n\nOn April 9, 1836, Maria married the cultured and able Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Saalfeld, eldest son of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and his wife Princess Maria Antonia Koháry de Csábrág et Szitnya, heiress to the House of Koháry.\n\nIn accordance with Portuguese law, he had a right to be King of Portugal through jure uxoris as the husband of Queen Maria II. However, according to the law he would not be proclaimed King until the birth of their first child and heir, Pedro. He was Co-sovereign as King Fernando II rom the birth of their first son in 1837 to her death in 1853.\n\nIn 1842, Pope Gregory XVI presented Maria with a Golden Rose.\n\nMaria’s reign saw a revolutionary insurrection on May 26, 1846, but this was crushed by royalist troops on February 22, 1847, and Portugal otherwise avoided the European Revolution of 1848. Maria’s reign was also notable for a public health act aimed at curbing the spread of cholera throughout the country. She also pursued policies aimed at raising the levels of education throughout the country.\n\nDeath\n\nFrom her first pregnancy at the age of eighteen, Maria II faced problems in giving birth, with prolonged and extremely difficult labor. An example of this was her third gestation, whose labor lasted 32 hours, after which a girl was baptized in articulo mortis with the name of Maria (1840).\n\nAt 25 years of age and in her fifth gestation, Maria II became obese and her births became even more complicated. In 1847, the fetal distress that preceded the birth of her eighth child – the Infante Augusto, Duke of Coimbra – brought to the world a child “quite purple and with little breathing”.\n\nThe dangerous routine of successive pregnancies, coupled with obesity (which eventually caused her heart problems) and the frequency of dystocic births (worrisome, especially as a multiparous woman) led doctors to warn the queen about the serious risks she would face in future pregnancies. Indifferent to the warnings, Maria II merely replied: “If I die, I die at my post.”\n\nOn November 15, 1853, thirteen hours after the onset of labor of the stillborn Infante Eugénio, her eleventh child, Maria II died at the age of 34.\n\nQueen Maria II was succeeded by her eldest son as King Pedro V of Portugal. As the eldest son of Queen Maria II and King Fernando II, Pedro was a member of the House of Bragança. As heir apparent to the throne he was styled Prince Royal and was also the 23rd Duke of Braganza (Duque de Bragança.\n\nPedro V, along with his brothers Fernando and João and other royal family members, succumbed to typhoid fever or cholera in 1861.\n\nFrom the Emperor’s Desk: I would like to get back to the series on examining who was or was not a usurper to the English or British throne. The next person to focus on is King Richard III. This should be a no-brainer because he is famously known for usurping the throne from his 12-year-old nephew. However, I would like to focus on some evidence and information that may cast a little doubt on this. First I would like to provide a little background information on Richard.\n\nRichard III (October 2, 1452 – August 22,1485) was King of England from June 26, 1483 until his death in 1485. He was the last king of the House of York and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty. His defeat and death at the Battle of Bosworth Field, the last decisive battle of the Wars of the Roses, marked the end of the Middle Ages in England.\n\nRichard was born on October 2, 1452, at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire, the eleventh of the twelve children of Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville, and the youngest to survive infancy.\n\nLike his father and brother, King Edward IV, Richard was born with a strong claim to the throne. Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York (also named Richard Plantagenet) was a leading English magnate and claimant to the throne during the Wars of the Roses. He was a member of the ruling House of Plantagenet by virtue of being a direct male-line descendant of Edmund of Langley, King Edward III’s fourth surviving son.\n\nHowever, it was through his mother, Anne Mortimer, a descendant of Edward III’s second surviving son, Lionel of Antwerp, that Richard inherited his strongest claim to the throne, as the opposing House of Lancaster was descended from John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, the third surviving son of Edward III.\n\nRichard’s mother, Cecily Neville, also strengthened the House of York’s claim to the English throne. Cecily Neville was the youngest of the 22 children of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, in this case born to his second wife Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby, and Maud Percy, daughter of Henry de Percy, 2nd Baron Percy. Her maternal grandparents were John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and his third wife Katherine Swynford. John of Gaunt was the third surviving son of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault\n\nThe future King Richard III’s childhood coincided with the beginning of the ‘Wars of the Roses’, a period of political instability and periodic open civil war in England during the second half of the fifteenth century, between the Yorkists, who supported Richard’s father (a potential claimant to the throne of King Henry VI from birth), and opposed the regime of Henry VI and his wife, Margaret of Anjou, and the Lancastrians, who were loyal to the crown.\n\nIn 1459, his father and the Yorkists were forced to flee England, whereupon Richard and his older brother George were placed in the custody of their aunt Anne Neville, Duchess of Buckingham, and possibly of Cardinal Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nHis eldest brother Edward inherited the Yorkist claim when his father, Richard, Duke of York, died at the Battle of Wakefield on December 30, 1460. After defeating Lancastrian armies at Mortimer’s Cross and Towton in early 1461, Edward deposed King Henry VI and took the throne as King Edward IV of England.\n\nHis marriage to Elizabeth Woodville in 1464 led to conflict with his chief advisor, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, known as the “Kingmaker”. In 1470, a revolt led by Warwick and Edward’s brother George, Duke of Clarence, briefly re-installed Henry VI.\n\nWhen their father and elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed at the Battle of Wakefield, Richard and George were sent by their mother to the Low Countries. They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton.\n\nRichard and George participated in the coronation of their eldest brother King Edward IV on June 28, 1461, when Richard was named Duke of Gloucester and made both a Knight of the Garter and a Knight of the Bath. Edward appointed him the sole Commissioner of Array for the Western Counties in 1464 when he was 11. By the age of 17, he had an independent command.\n\nRichard married Anne Neville on July 12, 1472. Anne had previously been wedded to Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales and only son of Henry VI, to seal her father’s allegiance to the Lancastrian party, Edward died at the Battle of Tewkesbury on May 4, 1471, while Warwick had died at the Battle of Barnet on 14 April 1471.\n\nRichard’s marriage plans brought him into conflict with his brother George. John Paston’s letter of February 17, 1472 makes it clear that George was not happy about the marriage but grudgingly accepted it on the basis that “he may well have my Lady his sister-in-law, but they shall part no livelihood”.\n\nThe reason for George not supporting the marriage was the inheritance Anne shared with her elder sister Isabel, whom George had married in 1469. It was not only the earldom of Warwick that was at stake; Richard Neville had inherited it as a result of his marriage to Anne Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick. The Countess, who was still alive, was technically the owner of the substantial Beauchamp estates, her father having left no male heirs.\n\nThe Croyland Chronicle records that Richard agreed to a prenuptial contract in the following terms: “the marriage of the Duke of Gloucester with Anne before-named was to take place, and he was to have such and so much of the earl’s lands as should be agreed upon between them through the mediation of arbitrators; while all the rest were to remain in the possession of the Duke of Clarence”.\n\nThe date of Paston’s letter suggests the marriage was still being negotiated in February 1472. In order to win George’s final consent to the marriage, Richard renounced most of the Earl of Warwick’s land and property including the earldoms of Warwick (which the Kingmaker had held in his wife’s right) and Salisbury and surrendered to George the office of Great Chamberlain of England. Richard retained Neville’s forfeit estates he had already been granted in the summer of 1471: Penrith, Sheriff Hutton and Middleham, where he later established his marital household.\n\nMichael Hicks has suggested that the terms of the dispensation deliberately understated the degrees of consanguinity between the couple, and the marriage was therefore illegal on the ground of first degree consanguinity following George’s marriage to Anne’s sister Isabel.\n\nThere would have been first-degree consanguinity if Richard had sought to marry Isabel (in case of widowhood) after she had married his brother George, but no such consanguinity applied for Anne and Richard. Richard’s marriage to Anne was never declared null, and it was public to everyone including secular and canon lawyers for 13 years.\n\nIn 1482, King Edward IV backed an attempt to usurp the Scottish throne by Alexander Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany, brother of James III of Scotland. Gloucester invaded Scotland and took the town of Edinburgh, but not the far more formidable castle, where James was being held by his own nobles. Albany switched sides and without siege equipment, the English army was forced to withdraw, with little to show for an expensive campaign, apart from the capture of Berwick Castle.\n\nEdward’s health began to fail, and he became subject to an increasing number of ailments; his physicians attributed this in part to a habitual use of emetics, which allowed him to gorge himself at meals, then return after vomiting to start again. He fell fatally ill at Easter 1483, but survived long enough to add codicils to his will, the most important naming his brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, as Protector after his death. King Edward IV died on April 9, 1483 and was buried in St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle. His twelve-year-old son succeeded him as King Edward V of England and Lord of Ireland."
