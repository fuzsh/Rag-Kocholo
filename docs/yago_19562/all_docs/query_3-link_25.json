        "text": "We don't know.\n\nFirst let us take into consideration what this matters for Portugal - Afonso would surely continue his fathers policy of centralization and absolutism instead of Manuel's more moderated early modern style monarchy due to his conflicts with John of Lancaster and due to the fact that his base of support was mainly the higher aristocrats. Thus Portugal continues on a path of heavily developing it's bourgeousie and more importantly maintains it's very powerful, very important jewish merchants and money lenders.\n\nThen we take another path - the Joannine monarchy was much more averse to the Catholic Monarchs than the Manueline was. Manuel had plenty of connections with the Spanish while John the II was pretty much disliked by the Spanish court and those are the origins of the suspicions that it was the Spanish who arranged for Alfonso to be murdered so that John could be supplanted by Manuel. Thus we can expect that Portugal (If Afonso and Isabella junior don't have children) will keep a very much neutral spanish policy unlike the Manueline very Pro-Spanish appeasement policy.\n\nSecond is the Jews. I doubt very much that either Alfonso or his father are accepting any request to expel the jews in this timeline.\n\nThird is the Iberian Union born out of this - it will be probably headed by Portugal or we will end up with a pretty less Castillian union than in our timeline. Also, otl Spain will be just that more powerful now.\n\nAs of late, I think Afonso's death was closer to an accident than to an assassination. From the chronicles, it seems Afonso was closer to Manuel's style than to John II as Garcia de Resende describes him as somewhat softer and with John II being slightly disappointed in him but with hopes to still shape him to be like him. Thus considering this and that the Catholic Monarchs still have a male heir that can produce children I find it hard for it to not be an accident but I will not set aside that his death had some help to make Manuel the heir.\n\nJohn II was more than likely poisoned and his relationship with his wife Eleonor got strained after Afonso's death because John wanted his bastard Jorge de Lencastre to be his heir instead of Manuel, so if Afonso does not die, then husband and wife may continue on good terms. The poisoning could perhaps be avoided too meaning that John II lives longer or if he is less depressed about his son's death and the state of things in his family, he might live a couple of extra years which could enable him to see his goal be accomplished with a perhaps slightly earlier voyage of Vasco da Gama.\n\nThe chronicles also say that Afonso and Isabella the Younger had a very...active couple life. Since they produced no children this can be debatable but they seemed to genuinely be in love. As stated if Afonso didn't die, Isabella would be in much better shape and perhaps could produce a bunch of children though I don't think she would reach the fertility of her sisters Joanna and Maria. Maria would probably marry James IV of Scotland which could potentially provide Margaret Tudor his OTL wife for a potential son of Afonso but this is just speculation.\n\nManuel wanted to marry Isabella the Younger and later Maria hence why he accepted the Catholic Monarchs' terms and they took advantage of it. He still tried to make the jews remain in Portugal by forcing them to convert but it's not the same thing. Unless Afonso gets manipulated by Ferdinand and Isabella, the Jews will remain in Portugal and the Inquisition will not be installed.\n\nIf John of Asturias dies without children then the Iberian Union would be formed by Portugal which in my opinion would be the power base of the King because not only it has the largest city (Lisbon) but it's more centralized than Castille and with less powerful nobles. If this Spain follows the traditional Portuguese diplomatic policy, debatable if they inherit Naples and Sicily, then it's likely their wealth will be wasted in countless wars which would definitely make the country go to the path of a wank country."
