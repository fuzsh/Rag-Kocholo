        "text": "It seems we've had this exercise before but I do like considering the various potential matches. So, here's my attempt for suitable royal (or noble) candidates for the European heirs (or heir's heirs) - preferably about their own age and religion (for which I group all protestants together):\n\nSweden: Princess Estelle (Feb 2012)\n\nAfter Denmark had a Swedish princess as their queen, why not a Danish prince as the future prince consort; and several family members also have British spouses:\n\n- Prince Vincent of Denmark (Jan 2011)\n\n- James, Earl of Wessex (Dec 2007)\n\nNorway: Princess Ingrid-Alexandra (Jan 2004)\n\nA sporty prince (or count ?) would be preferable... Not sure about the athletic abilities of the various candidates.\n\n- Count Felix of Monpezat (July 2002) [3rd cousin once removed]\n\n- Count Claus-Casimir of Orange-Nassau, Jonkheer van Amsberg (March 2004)\n\nDenmark: Prince Christian (Oct 2005)\n\nOne of the younger Dutch princesses might work out (we know for sure that they know each other, so that helps - Ariane might be the better match imho) or a daughter of one of his parents' German royal friends:\n\n- Princess Alexia of the Netherlands (June 2005); or her younger sister: Princess Ariane of the Netherlands (April 2007)\n\n- Princess Paulina of Hesse (March 2007)\n\nUK: Prince George (July 2013)\n\nA match between their parents was often suggested but never worked out, so what about their children (and another option among the many descendants of queen Victoria):\n\n- Princess Leonore of Sweden (Feb 2014) [also a descendant of queen Victoria]\n\n- Princess Emma of Prussia (April 2015) [also a descendant of queen Victoria]\n\nThe Netherlands: Princess Catharina-Amalia (Dec 2003)\n\nAmalia has stated that she likes German guys because they are more polite/gallant than Dutch guys. So, based on that criterion:\n\n- Hereditary Prince Leopold of Baden (May 2002); or his middle brother: Prince Friedrich of Baden (March 2004)\n\n- Duke Kirill of Oldenburg (June 2002); or his second brother: Duke Carlos of Oldenburg (April 2004)\n\nBelgium: Princess Elisabeth (Oct 2001)\n\nA Roman-Catholic prince seems the best match - so, maybe someone from the Liechtenstein family or a non-reigning Roman Catholic royal (or imperial) house:\n\n- Prince Georg vuz Liechtenstein (April 1999); or his brother: Prince Nikolaus vuz Liechtenstein (Dec 2000)\n\n- Infante Dinis of Portugal (Nov 1999)\n\nLuxembourg: Prince Charles (May 2020)\n\nMy youngest niece born in May 2020... oh no, she isn't royal nor noble Of course, we could look for a potential bride in Belgium but preferably not the royal family as they are still relatively closely related - and the same goes for example for some Habsburgs and Liechtensteiners, so including both a daughter of a Belgian princess and close friend of Charles's mother (princess Blanche de Mérode, she was one of the witnesses at the wedding of Guillaume and Stéphanie!) and a German princess (living in Madrid with a Peruvian mother):\n\n- Freiin Cléo vuz Bodman (Feb 2020)\n\n- Princess Sofia of Hanover (July 2020)\n\nLiechtenstein: Prince Joseph-Wenzel (May 1995)\n\nSome princesses of his age group are already married or engaged, so, we need a young woman that is still available. Astrid's family is very much Switzerland-focused, so they already are used to (living in) the Alpes (and for a bit of fun: a Greek princess ):\n\n- Princess Luisa Maria of Belgium (Oct 1995)\n\n- Princess Maria-Olympia of Greece (July 1996)\n\nMonaco: Prince Jacques (Dec 2014)\n\nA French princess sounds unlikely but perfect (so, I'm landing at one of the Count of Paris's daughters); alternatively, one of the daughters of prince Jaime and princess Viktoria de Bourbon de Parme could be a match:\n\n- Princess Louise-Marguerite of Orleans (July 2014); or her younger sister: Princess Jacinthe of Orleans (Oct 2018)\n\n- Princess Zita de Bourbon de Parme (Feb 2014); or her younger sister: Princess Gloria de Bourbon de Parme (May 2016)\n\nSpain: Princess Leonor (Oct 2005)\n\nI really liked MagdalenaS's idea of one of the sons of prince Guillaume of Luxembourg. Because of age, I'll settle on the youngest - but a Belgian prince would of course also be a great option:\n\n- Prince Jean of Nassau (July 2004)\n\n- Prince Gabriel of Belgium (Aug 2003); or his younger brother: Prince Emmanuel of Belgium (Oct 2005)\n\nI thought Peter Philips - princess Anne son - would have made a good partner for crown princess Victoria. I also thought Alexandra of Luxembourg and prince Rafael of orleans braganza would be nice as would prince Josef Wenzel & Alexandra of Hanover\n\nPeter isn’t royal, he’s not even the son of a baronet so a hypothetical marriage to Victoria would be no different than her marriage to Daniel.\n\nIt seems we've had this exercise before but I do like considering the various potential matches.
