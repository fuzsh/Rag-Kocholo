        "text": "On May 12, 1191, Richard and Berengaria were married at\n\nLimassol in Cyprus. I’ve mentioned\n\nbefore that Berengaria has four unique distinctions—she was the only Queen of\n\nEngland to be married and then crowned in Cyprus, the only royal bride to spend\n\nher honeymoon in a war zone, and the only English queen who never set foot on\n\nEnglish soil; John did issue her several safe-conducts during her long\n\nwidowhood, but there is no evidence that she ever used them. I recently realized that she has another\n\ndistinction, a very sad one—she is the only medieval English queen who did not\n\nprovide her husband with an heir. William Rufus did not even bother to get married, Richard II’s Anne was\n\nstill young enough when she died to have harbored hopes, Richard III’s Anne became\n\nterminally ill soon after their son’s death, and once we leave the Plantagenet\n\ndynasty for those ubiquitous Tudors, their fertility track record was a sad\n\none. But only Berengaria had to struggle\n\nwith history’s cruel judgment of being a “barren” queen, and it is likely she also\n\nblamed herself, although Richard was certainly at fault, too, given how little\n\ntime he spent with her upon his release from his German captivity and the\n\ncriticism he got from the Bishop of Lincoln for his flagrant adulteries. Berengaria\n\nis one of the least-known of the English queens and has not been treated very\n\nkindly by historians, many of whom assumed that she must have been dull and\n\nboring and not lively enough to hold her husband’s attention. This is obviously unfair and lets Richard\n\noff the hook for the part he played in the deterioration of their\n\nmarriage. Lastly, I think she has the\n\nmost beautiful name of any English queen—not the clunky Berengaria, but her real\n\nSpanish name, Berenguela.\n\nA little\n\nwhile ago, I’d promised to quote from the contemporary chronicles from time to\n\ntime. So here is what they had to say\n\nabout Richard and Berengaria.\n\nFrom the Itinerarium, translated by Helen Nicholson: “While they were each making arrangements\n\nto begin the journey, messengers came running to inform King Richard that his\n\nmother Queen Eleanor was hurrying after him. She had traveled a great distance, but was now very close, and had\n\nbrought with her a noble young woman, daughter of the King of Navarre. Her name was Berengaria and she was the\n\nking’s intended wife. Attracted by her\n\ngraceful manner and high birth, he had desired her very much for a long\n\ntime—since he was first count of Poitou. So her father the king of Navarre had entrusted her to King Richard’s\n\nmother so that she could take her to King Richard and he could take her as his\n\nwife before he set off on his planned journey across the sea. Everyone was delighted at their\n\narrival.”\n\nThe Itinerarium describes the wedding as follows: “On the following day, a Sunday, on the\n\nFeast of St Pancras, Richard and Berengaria were married at Limassol. The young woman was very wise and of good\n\ncharacter. She was there crowned queen. The Archbishop of Bordeaux was present at the\n\nceremony, as was the bishop of Evreux and the bishop of Bayonne, and many other\n\nmagnates and nobles. The king was merry\n\nand full of delight, pleasant and agreeable to everyone.”\n\nThese passages are from Ambroise’s The History of the Holy\n\nWar, translated by Marianne Ailes.\n\n“He (Richard) then made his way beyond the straits, straight\n\nto Reggio whence news had been sent to him that his mother had arrived there bringing\n\nto the king his beloved. She was a wise\n\nmaiden, a fine lady, both noble and beautiful, with no falseness or treachery\n\nin her. Her name was Berengaria; the\n\nKing of Navarre was her father. He had\n\ngiven her to the mother of King Richard who had made great efforts to bring her\n\nthat far. Then she was called queen and\n\nthe king loved her greatly. Since the\n\ntime when he was count of Poitiers she had been his heart’s desire.”\n\nAmbroise describes the wedding: “The next morning the young woman was married\n\nand crowned at Limassol. She was\n\nbeautiful, with a bright countenance, the wisest woman, indeed, that one could\n\nhope to find anywhere. There was the\n\nking in great glory, rejoicing in his victory and in his marriage to the woman\n\nto whom he had pledged his troth.”\n\nWhat is\n\nimmediately striking about these accounts is that both chroniclers were under\n\nthe impression that Richard was quite smitten with his bride. I find that very sweet, but I tend to be a\n\nbit skeptical, in part because royal marriages were not love matches and\n\nbecause I personally don’t think Richard had a romantic bone in his body. But it is interesting to see what Richard’s\n\ncontemporaries thought of his relationship with his bride.\n\nFor a more\n\ncynical view, I give you Richard of Devizes, who was not present for these\n\nevents, here describing Richard’s departure from Sicily. “The fleet of Richard, king of the English, put\n\nout to sea, and proceeded in this order. In the forefront went three ships only, in one of which was the queen of\n\nSicily and the young damsel of Navarre, probably still a virgin.” Richard and Berengaria were plight-trothed and\n\nin the MA, that was often considered as binding as the marriage ceremony\n\nitself, so the chronicler thinks Richard may have jumped the gun, so to\n\nspeak. Not very gallant of him to\n\nspeculate about that, of course, but he was always a bit snarky. Listen to what he said about Eleanor, “Queen\n\nEleanor, a matchless woman, beautiful and chaste, powerful and modest, meek and\n\neloquent, which is rarely wont to be met with in a woman, who was advanced in\n\nyears enough to have had two husbands and two sons crowned kings, still\n\nindefatigable for every undertaking, whose power was the admiration of her\n\nage…”\n\nSo far so good, right? (Although this must surely be the one and\n\nonly time that anyone described Eleanor as “meek.”) But then he cannot resist making a snide\n\nallusion to the scandal in Antioch, more than forty years in the past. “Many knew what I wish what none of us had\n\nknown. This same queen, in the time of\n\nher former husband, went to Jerusalem. Let none speak more thereof; I also know well. Be silent.”\n\nThis same monk is the only one to\n\ncast aspersions on Berengaria’s appearance. He described her as “a maid more accomplished than beautiful,” though\n\nthis is sometimes translated as “more prudent than pretty.” Richard of Devizes never saw Berengaria,\n\nthough. William of Newburgh, a very\n\nreliable contemporary chronicler, called her “a virgin of famous beauty and\n\nprudence,” although he never saw her, either. I find it interesting that historians have usually chosen to quote\n\nRichard of Devizes’s unfavorable assessment of Berengaria’s looks over that of\n\nAmbroise, who actually did see her, possibly because they think royal brides\n\nwere described as beautiful as a matter of course. But why, then, do they accept at face value\n\nthe praise given to other queens and princesses? I think their willingness to see Berengaria\n\nas plain ties in with the tendency to blame her for the failure of her\n\nmarriage. But since both Ambroise and\n\nthe author of the Itinerarium believed that Richard had desired Berengaria long\n\nbefore he wed her, it is unlikely that she was plain, for medievals were as\n\nsuperficial as we are today and expected their heroes to be handsome and\n\ndashing and their heroines fair and chaste. Okay, we’ve done away with the chaste requirement.J\n\nTo show that medieval chroniclers\n\nwere not like today’s press agents for Hollywood stars, I thought I’d conclude\n\nwith some descriptions of historical figures that were far from\n\nflattering.\n\nKatalina of Lancaster,\n\ndaughter of John of Gaunt and Constanza of Castile, wife of Enrique III of\n\nCastile (1372-1418)\n\n“The queen was tall of body and very fat. She was pink and white in her\n\ncomplexion and fair. In her figure and movements she seemed as much like a man\n\nas a woman… she was not very well ordered in her body and had a serious affliction\n\nof palsy which did not leave her tongue properly loose or her body movements\n\nfree.”\n\nFrom the Generaciones y semblanzas of Perez y de Guzman\n\nGuifred Pilosus, Count of\n\nBarcelona (died 897)\n\n“…[H]e was hairy in places not normally so in men…”\n\nFrom the Gesta comitum barcinonensium\n\nFrederick II, Holy Roman\n\nEmperor, son of Heinrich von Hohenstaufen and Constance de Hauteville.\n\n“The Emperor was covered with red\n\nhair, was bald and myopic. Had he been a slave, he would not have fetched 200\n\ndirhams at market.”\n\nFrom the Muntazam by Sibt Ibn al-Jawzi\n\nKálmán, King of Hungary, son\n\nof Géza I and Sophie of Looz, father of István II (1170-1116)\n\n“…shrewd and learned… hairy, shaggy, squinting, hunchbacked, lame, and\n\nstuttering.”\n\nFrom the Chronicon Pictum Vindobonense\n\nAmaury I, King of Jerusalem,\n\nson of Fulk and Melisende of Jerusalem, husband of Agnes of Edessa and Maria\n\nKomnene, father of Baldwin IV and Isabella (1136-1174)\n\n“He was a man endowed with worldly experience, very shrewd and circumspect\n\nin his deeds. He had a slight impediment of the tongue, not so much that could\n\nbe considered a defect, but so that he had no elegance in spontaneous, flowing\n\nspeech… His body was of pleasing stature, as if it had been measured\n\nproportionally so that he was taller than the average, but smaller than the\n\nvery tall… His face was attractive… His eyes were bright, and somewhat\n\nprotruding; his nose, like his brother’s, aquiline; his hair yellow, and\n\nslightly receding; his beard covered his cheeks and chin with pleasing\n\nfullness. However, he had an uncontrollable laugh, which made him shake all\n\nover… He was fat beyond measure, in such a way that he had breasts like a\n\nwoman, hanging down to his belt…”\n\nFrom the Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum of William of\n\nTyre (c.1130-1185)\n\nThe description of King Amaury of\n\nJerusalem comes from Deeds Beyond the Sea by the man considered one of the\n\ngreatest medieval historians, William, Archbishop of Tyre. He also gives us a fascinating glimpse of\n\nWilliam de Montferrat, older brother of Conrad de Montferrat, who was wed to\n\nSybilla, Queen of Jerusalem, later the wife of Guy de Lusignan. He describes William as handsome and bold and\n\nintelligent, but then adds that he was inclined to drink too much and when he\n\ndid, he was very quick to anger. Such a\n\npity he died in 1186, for I’d have loved to have read what he would have said\n\nabout the English-French feuding during the Third Crusade!\n\nWell, it is time to return to the\n\ndungeons of Trifels Castle, where the most dangerous enemies of the Holy Roman\n\nEmpire were imprisoned and where Coeur de Lion spent a few very uncomfortable\n\nweeks in April of 1193. Once I can\n\nspring Richard from Trifels, I will surface again."
