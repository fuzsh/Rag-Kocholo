It was established as a separate administrative territory by the kings of Asturias towards the end of the ninth century, with a governor (\"dux\") appointed for life by the crown. The name Portugal is first found in a document of 883. By the middle of 11th century, the office of dux was no longer being filled, the King of Castile and León appointing local administrators (\"meirinhos\") to supplant the influence of the local aristocracy . Under the division of territories decreed by Fernando I King of Castile and León after his death, the territory of Portugal was part of the kingdom of Galicia which fell to Fernando's youngest son García. The local barons rebelled against his rule, and Galicia was invaded by García's brother Alfonso VI King of León who incorporated it into his territories. The county of Portugal was established when King Alfonso's granted land to his son-in-law Henri de Bourgogne in [1096/97]. The new county of Portugal asserted its independence systematically over the subsequent decades. Count Henri's widow Teresa adopted the title Queen of Portugal in 1117. Her son Conde Afonso expelled Queen Teresa from Portugal in 1128 and proclaimed himself king of Portugal in 1139.\n\nChapter 1. KINGS OF PORTUGAL 1113-1383 (BURGUNDY-CAPET)\n\nHENRI de Bourgogne, son of HENRI le damoiseau de Bourgogne [Capet] & his wife --- ([1069/72]-killed in battle Astorga, León 22 May 1112, bur Braga Cathedral) . \"Heynricus frater meus\" witnessed the donation to Cluny of \"Oddo dux Burgundie\" . An indication of his age is given in the charter dated to [1081/84] under which \"Odo dux Burgundie\" confirmed a donation by \"frater meus domnus Hugo\" to the abbey of Molesme with the consent of \"fratres mei Robertus archidiaconus, Henricus puer, Beatrix et Helia sorores mee\" . His parentage is confirmed by an early 12th century document at Fleury which records that \"Ainrico uni filiorum, filio ducis Roberti\" married \"alteram filiam non ex coniugali\" of Alfonso VI King of Castile . His aunt Constance Queen of Castile invited him to the court of Castile. He may have arrived in Spain with the expedition of the Eudes I Duke of Burgundy in 1086/87, following a call from the abbey of Cluny to fight \"the infidel\" . Señor de Braga [1093], count in Tordesillas 1096/97. He made a mutual pact [Dec 1094/Jul 1095] with Raymond de Bourgogne, husband of Infanta doña Urraca de Castilla, under which he promised support in securing Castile and León for Raymond in return for a pledge to grant him Toledo (or in default, Galicia) . Alfonso VI King of Castile made him a large grant of land, from the River Minho in the north to Santarem in the south, in [1095/96], which in effect resulted in his installation as HENRIQUE Conde de Portugal. This grant may have been motivated as much by a desire to offset the growing power of his son-in-law, Raymond de Bourgogne, as to increase the power base of Henri de Bourgogne. Comite Dono Henrico...cum uxore mea Infante Dona Taraxea granted privileges to Villa Constantin de Panonias, confirmed by Infans Dono Alfoso filius Henrici comiti et uxor mea Infante Dona Taraxia, by charter dated 1096 . The dating clause of a charter dated 9 Oct 1096, under which \"Pelayo Xemeniz\" donated land en Ville Ceide... to the monastery of San Salvador, records Sanxus comes in Toro et alius comes domino Ancricco in Auctario de Selles, comes Remundus tenente in Coria et in Zamora . The dating clause of a charter dated 19 Jan 1097, under which \"Brabolio Gutierrez\" sold land en territorio de León las villas Cubillas to Ordoño Sarraciniz y a su mujer Fronilde Ovéquiz, records comes Raimundus in Galicia et in Zamora, comes domno Enrriz in Otero de Sellas, comite Petro Ansurez in Saldania . Henrique established his residence at Guimarães, winning several battles against the Moors, although he was defeated at Malagón, south of Toledo, 16 Sep 1100 . \" Taraxia Adefonsi regis filia Henrik comes \" subscribed the charter dated 14 Mar 1099 under which Alfonso VI King of Castile donated the monastery of Santa María de Algadefe to the monastery of Eslonza . Comes domnus Henricus et uxor mea Domna Theresia, domini Regis Alfonsi filia donated property to La Charité-sur-Loire by charter dated Mar 1100 . He went to Palestine after 8 Jun 1101, but had returned by 1103 when he confirmed several of his father-in-law's charters . After the death of Alfonso VI King of Castile in 1109, the county of Portugal enjoyed de facto independence, due largely to the troubles faced by Queen Urraca in Castile after her accession. Henrique took advantage of this situation by joining forces with Alfonso I King of Aragon and defeating Urraca at Candespina, near Sepúlveda 26 Oct 1111. However, he changed sides after the battle and besieged Alfonso at Peñafiel jointly with Urraca's forces. The dating clause of the charter dated 21 Dec 1111, under which Tello Telliz...cum coniuge mea Maior Suariz donated \"divisa...in villa...Oterolo iusta flumen Aratogie territorio Castro Froila...que fuit de Pelagio Pelaiz\" to Iohan Flainiz, records Henricus comes in Alcamora et in Astorica simul in Portugal... . He was killed at the siege of Astorga, supporting doña Urraca Queen of Castile against her second husband don Alfonso I King of Aragon. The Chronicon Lusitanum records the death Kal Mai in 1152 (1114) of Comes D. Henricus . The Nobiliario of Pedro Conde de Barcelos records that \"El Conde D. Enrique\" died \"en Astorga\" .\n\nm ([1095]) doña TERESA de Castilla y León, illegitimate daughter of ALFONSO VI King of Castile & his mistress Jimena Muñoz de Guzmán ([1081/82]-1 Nov 1130, bur Braga Cathedral). The Chronicon Regum Legionensium names \"Jimena Muñoz\" as the first of two concubines of King Alfonso, and their daughters \"Elvira the wife of count Raymond of Toulouse and Teresa the wife of Count Henry\" . Her parentage is confirmed by the charter dated 23 Mar 1143 under which her daughter Sancha Enríquez property in Trobajo del Cerecedo, which she inherited from \"avia mea dompna Hensemena Muñiz et de mater mea eius filia regina dompna Teresa\", to the parents of Juan Albertino Bishop of León . The 13th century history of Sahagún monastery records that \"el Rey D. Alonso una hija Teresa\" married \"un Conde Enrique que venia de sangre Real de Francia\" . An early 12th century document at Fleury records that \"Ainrico uni filiorum, filio ducis Roberti\" married \"alteram filiam non ex coniugali\" of Alfonso VI King of Castile . Comite Dono Henrico...cum uxore mea Infante Dona Taraxea granted privileges to Villa Constantin de Panonias, confirmed by Infans Dono Alfoso filius Henrici comiti et uxor mea Infante Dona Taraxia, by charter dated 1096 . \" Taraxia Adefonsi regis filia Henrik comes \" subscribed the charter dated 14 Mar 1099 under which Alfonso VI King of Castile donated the monastery of Santa María de Algadefe to the monastery of Eslonza . Comes domnus Henricus et uxor mea Domna Theresia, domini Regis Alfonsi filia donated property to La Charité-sur-Loire by charter dated Mar 1100 . Regent of Portugal 1112-1128. She continued her husband's expansionist policy, harrying her half-sister Queen Urraca at every opportunity, probably with a view to replacing her as Queen of Castile. She adopted the title TERESA Queen of Portugal from Nov 1117. She became the mistress (1124) of Fernando Pérez de Traba Conde de Trastámara, son of Pedro Froilaz de Traba & his first wife Urraca Froilaz, who appeared first as a confirmant of one of Teresa's charters 1 Feb 1121 . The Historia Compostelana records that Fernando Perride, Petris Comitis filio left his lawful wife and lived in adultery with Regina Tarasia . The Chronica Adefonsi Imperatoris records that Alfonso VII King of Castile met \"Teresa queen of the Portuguese and with Count Fernando\" at Ricobayo and made peace with them after his accession in 1126 . \"Tarasia regina domni Adefonsi Yspaniarum imperatoris filia\" donated \"monasterio Sancte Marie quod cognomento Viminerium\" to Cluny by charter dated 23 May 1127, confirmed by \"Infans Ildefonsus Comes Fernandus Comes Monio Infanta Sancia\" . Her rule caused resentment among local leaders, and she and her second husband were defeated and expelled from Portugal in 1128 by her son dom Afonso Henriquez. The Chronicon Lusitanum records the death Kal Nov in 1168 (1130) of Regina Donna Tarasia mater Donni Alfonsi anno secundo regni .\n\nHenrique & his wife had [seven] children:\n\n1. [AFONSO Henriques ([1095/1096]-before 1110, bur Braga Cathedral). Comite Dono Henrico...cum uxore mea Infante Dona Taraxea granted privileges to Villa Constantin de Panonias, confirmed by Infans Dono Alfoso filius Henrici comiti et uxor mea Infante Dona Taraxia, by charter dated 1096 . It is possible that this document is misdated and that Afonso was born later, considering the likely birth date of his mother. One possibility is that the document is misdated by more than 15 years and that the confirmant was in fact the same person as the future King Afonso I whose birth is dated to 1110 (see below). It does appear inconsistent with usual naming patterns that the eldest son of Henrique and Teresa should be named after the boy´s maternal grandfather, although it is recognised that such patterns do not amount to hard and fast rules and that exceptions to the norm may have applied in the case of a particularly illustrious ancestor.]\n\n2.URRACA Henriques ([1097/1105]-after 21 Sep 1161) . The Chronicon Regum Legionensium names (in order) \"Urraca, Elvira and Afonso\" as the children of Count Henrique & his wife . \"[Uere]mundus Petri\" granted arras to \"uxori mee infanti domne Orrache filie comitis domni Anrrich et regine domne Tarasie\" by charter dated 25 Jul 1122, subscribed by \" comitissa domna Maior, comitissa domna Lupa, Munia Froilaz, Uisclauara Froilaz\" . \"Ueremudus Petriz filius dompni comitis Petri Froyle et uxor mea infans dompna Urracha comitis Henriqui filia et regine Tharasie cum filiis et filiabus nostris\" refounded the monastery of San Pelayo de Genroso for \"filie mee dompne Urrache Ueremundi\" by charter dated 9 Oct 1138, subscribed by \" Domna Lupa comitissa Petri comitis filie\" . The Chronicon Lusitanum records the rebellion in 1169 (1131) of Vermudus Petri gener Reginæ Donnæ Tarasiæ in Castello Sene and that he was expelled by Infans [Alfonso] . The Nobiliario of Pedro Conde de Barcelos names \"D. Teresa hija de la Reina usurpada i del Conde D. Enrique\" as the second wife of \"D. Vermuiz Perez potestade de Trava\" . A charter dated 21 Sep 1161 records the settlement of a dispute between \"Domnus Ueremudus Petri cum uxore mea infantissa domna Urracha et cum filiis et filiabus meis\" and the monks of Tojos Outos, which records that \"predictus domnus Ueremundus Petri\" had become a monk \"in monasterium Superaddi\" and that \"uxor eius infantissa domna Urracha\" had become a nun \"in monasterio de Nogueirosa\", subscribed by \"filia eius Urracha Uermuiz, Fernandus Ueremudi, Sudarius Ueremudi, Santia Ueremudi, Tarasia Ueremudi \" . m (before 25 Jul 1122) VERMUDO Pérez de Trava Conde de Trastámara, son of PEDRO Froilaz de Traba & his first wife Urraca Fróilaz (-Sobrado [1168]).\n\n3.ELVIRA Henriques . The Chronicon Regum Legionensium names (in order) \"Urraca, Elvira and Afonso\" as the children of Count Henrique and his wife .\n\n4. daughter . Her parentage and marriage are confirmed by two charters of Afonso I King of Portugal dated Dec 1166 in which the son of Sancho Núñez, conde don Velasco Sánchez, is described as \"filius sororis eius\" . This daughter may have been the same person as either Sancha or Teresa who are named below. m [as his first wife,] SANCHO Núñez, son of conde NUÑO Velásquez & his wife condesa doña Fronilde Sánchez.\n\n5.SANCHA Henriques (-after 1147) . Her parentage is confirmed by the charter dated 23 Mar 1143 under which she donated property in Trobajo del Cerecedo, which she had inherited from \"avia mea dompna Hensemena Muñiz et de mater mea eius filia regina dompna Teresa\", to the parents of Juan Albertino Bishop of León . Sousa says that Sancha married D. Fernando Mendes, Rico-homem, Senhor de Bragança, dying sem successaõ, but cites only Antonio Brandaõ´s 1632 Monarchia Lusitana and the Nobiliario of Pedro Conde de Barcelos . Brandaõ quotes a charter dated 1147 under which Sancia reginæ Taresiæ ac comitis Henrici filia donated hum Casal em Saõ Pedro de Gostem to Braga cum concilio mariti mei Fernandi Mendes . The Nobiliario does not support Sousa´s statement at all: it records the wife of D. Fernan Mendez el Bravo Bragançon as D. Teresa Alonso, daughter of Afonso I King of Portugal by \"D. Elvira Gualtar\", adding that the king had separated Teresa from her previous husband don Sancho Nuñez with whom he had fought . The Livro Velho does not name the wife of \"D. Fernão Mendes o bravo\" at all . The mid-14th century Nobiliario and Livro Velho cannot be considered reliable sources for events which occurred more than 200 years earlier, in the absence of corroboration from earlier documents. The Braga charter must therefore be preferred. Barton, citing Mattoso, on the other hand names Sancha Henriques as the wife of Sancho Núñez (whose marriage to an unnamed daughter of Conde Henrique is confirmed above) . As noted below under her possible sister Teresa, one solution to the problem would be if Sancha married both noblemen in turn, as reported by the Nobiliario, which would have merely mistaken her parentage and her name. m [as his second wife,] FERNANDO Mendes o Bravo Senhor de Bragança de Langroiva e Noman (in Galicia), son of MENDO Fernández Senhor de Bragança & his wife ---.\n\n6. [TERESA Henriques . The Nobiliario of Pedro Conde de Barcelos names \"D. Teresa Enriquez\" as the daughter of \"El Conde D. Enrique\" and his wife \"la Reina D. Teresa\" . Sousa says that Teresa died sem estado, but adds that Antonio Brandaõ (writing in 1632) states that she could have been the wife of D. Sancho Nunes de Barbosa . Brandaõ cites no document in support of the statement, other than the Nobiliario´s report concerning the daughter, not sister, of King Afonso I who married in turn Sancho Núñez and Fernando Mendes (see above under her sister Sancha) . He also refers to one of the Dec 1166 charters of Afonso I King of Portugal, referred to above, in which Sancho´s son, conde don Velasco Sánchez, is described as \"filius sororis eius\" . As noted above, the mid-14th century Nobiliario can hardly be considered a reliable source for events which occurred more than two centuries earlier. One solution to this confused situation may be that the same sister of King Alfonso I (presumably Sancha) married both noblemen, as reported by the Nobiliario, which merely mistook her parentage and her name. If that is correct, it is possible that there never was a daughter of Conde Enrique who was named Teresa (although that does seem unlikely considering the name of Enrique´s wife).]\n\n7. --- Henriquez (-[before 1110], bur Braga Cathedral). Sousa refers to the Chronica do Conde D. Henrique which records the birth of a son (unnamed) who died young and was buried em Braga .\n\n8. AFONSO Henriquez (Guimaraes 25 Jul [1106/12]-Coimbra 6 Dec 1185, bur Coimbra, Church of the Cross) . The Chronicon Regum Legionensium names (in order) \"Urraca, Elvira and Afonso\" as the children of Count Henrique & his wife . He succeeded his father in 1112 as AFONSO I Conde de Portugal. Ruling through his mother, he overthrew and expelled her from Portugal in 1128. He proclaimed himself AFONSO I \"the Conqueror\" King of Portugal in 1139.\n\n- see below.\n\nHenrique had [one illegitimate son by an unknown mistress]:\n\n9. [PEDRO Afonso de Portugal . Sousa refers to the Chronica do Conde D. Henrique which records D. Pedro Affonso as illegitimate son of Conde Henrique by huma mulher de qualidade . However, if this information is correct, the patronymic Affonso makes little sense, especially as the use in the Iberian peninsula of variable patronymics, adopted from an illustrious ancestor not just the father, is not observed with frequency before the 13th century. Sousa also notes that the same person was Maestre of the Order of Aviz. However, the charter dated 1162, issued by the Cistercians to confirm the rules of the Order of Aviz, in the presence of regis Aldephonsi, is subscribed by ...Petrus proles Regis Par Francorum et Magister novæ militiæ... . The reference to proles Regis in this document suggests that Pedro´s father must have been King Afonso I and not Conde Henrique, who never adopted the royal title. Until the emergence of more information, it is assumed that this person never existed and that he has been confused with the illegitimate son of King Afonso who was called Pedro (see below). Sousa quotes an epitaph in Alcobaça which records the death 9 May 1175 of Domnus Petrus Alphonsus Alcobatiæ monachus Alphonsi regis frater and adding that his body was transferred to the monastery in 1293 . However, the epitaph itself says that it was placed in 1678, and it would not therefore be surprising if the inscription contained errors.]\n\nAFONSO Henriquez, son of HENRIQUE Conde de Portugal & his wife Teresa de Castilla y León (Guimaraes 25 Jul [1106/12]-Coimbra 6 Dec 1185, bur Coimbra, Church of the Cross) . The Chronicon Regum Legionensium names (in order) \"Urraca, Elvira and Afonso\" as the children of Count Henrique & his wife . The year in which Afonso was born is uncertain. Barbosa quotes a document dated XVII Kal Oct in 1173 which records the transfer of the body of San Vicente which states Regni autem regis Alfonsi 45 vitæ vero eiusdem 67, which would place his birth in 1106, and another document dated era 1222 [1184] which records the death of Rex Portugallensium doñus Alfonsus año vitæ suæ 78 . The former would place his birth in [1106], and the latter in [1107/08] assuming that Alfonso´s death can be dated to 1185. Brandaõ quotes a breviary from Alcobaça which records the birth era 1147 [1109] of Aldefonsus primus rex Portugaliæ, filius comitis Henrici, a manuscript about the works of San Fulgencio which records events in era 1186 [1148]...37 ætatis annum et regni 19 [1110/11], and a historia dos Godos which records era 1163 [1125] Infans Alfonsus Henrici comitis filius ætatis anno 14 [1111] . The Chronicon Lusitanum records the birth in 1151 (1113) of Infans Alfonsus Comitis Henrici et Reginæ D. Tarasiæ filius, Regis D. Alfonsi nepos , although a posthumous birth would probably have been noted. As can be seen, the full range of years from 1106 to 1112 is covered by these various contradictory sources. There appears no way of deciding which is more accurate than the others, although Brandaõ suggests that 1110 is correct. He succeeded his father in 1112 as AFONSO I Conde de Portugal. \" Infanta dna Sancia, Infans dns Adefonsus regis consanguineus \" subscribed the charter dated 13 Nov 1127 under which King Alfonso VII donated \"el castillo de San Jorge en la Sierra del Pindo\" to Santiago de Compostela . It is probable that the second subscriber was Afonso de Portugal. Ruling through his mother, he overthrew and expelled her from Portugal in 1128. In 1135 he refused to swear homage to Alfonso VII King of Castile, from that time using the title 'Prince of Portugal'. He moved his capital to Coimbra. In 1139 he won a notable victory against the Muslims in Santarem who were reduced to tributary status. He proclaimed himself AFONSO I \"the Conqueror\" King of Portugal in 1139. His establishment of the archbishopric of Braga gave Portugal ecclesiastical independence. Alfonsus, Portugaliæ rex, comitis Henrici et reginæ Theresiæ filius, magni quoque regis Alfonsi nepos cum uxore mea regina donna Malfada, filia comitis Amedei de Moriana confirmed donations to La Charité-sur-Loire by his father by charter dated Jul 1145 . He swore allegiance to the Pope, although Papal recognition of his title of king of Portugal was only given in 1179. He expanded his territory to the south, capturing Lisbon in 1147 with the help of a force of English, French and Flemish crusaders . The De Rebus Hispaniæ of Rodericus Ximenes records that \"Aldefonsus\" was buried \"Coimbræ in Monasterio S. Crucis\" . The Chronicon Conimbricensi records the death VIII Id Dec in [1185] of Rex Ildefonsus Portugalensis .\n\nm ([Jan/Jun] 1146) MATHILDE de Savoie, daughter of AMEDEE III Comte de Maurienne et de Savoie & his first wife Adélaïde --- ([1125]-Coimbra 4 Nov 1157, bur Coimbra, Church of the Cross). The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines refers to the wife of \"Aldefonsus rex Portugallie\" as \"filia comitis Sabaudie\" but does not name her . The De Rebus Hispaniæ of Rodericus Ximenes records the marriage of \"Aldefonsum\" and \"Mafaldam filiam Comitis Maurienæ\" . The Chronicon Lusitanum records the marriage in 1183 (1145) of Rex Donnus Alfonsus and Donnam Matildam, Comitis Amadæi de Moriana filiam, adding that they had three sons, of whom two died young, and three daughters . Brandaõ quotes a charter of the king dated 1146 which records anno...quo duxeramt Mahaldam and a charter dated Jul 1146 in which he records a donation cum uxore mea Regina Dona Mafalda . Her origin was evidently not widely known in Portugal, as a Chronica Breve records that King Alfonso I married \"dona Maffalda Manrique, filha do conde dom Manrrique de Lara e senhor de Mollina e de dona Ermesenda filha do Almerique primeiro senhor de Barbona\" . She was known as dona MAFALDA in Portugal. Alfonsus, Portugaliæ rex, comitis Henrici et reginæ Theresiæ filius, magni quoque regis Alfonsi nepos cum uxore mea regina donna Malfada, filia comitis Amedei de Moriana confirmed donations to La Charité-sur-Loire by his father by charter dated Jul 1145 . The Chronicon Lusitanum records the death III Non Dec in 1196 (1158) of Regina D. Matilda Comitis Amadæi filia, uxor D. Alfonsi Portugallensium Regis .\n\nMistress (1): ELVIRA Gualtar, daughter of ---. The Nobiliario of Pedro Conde de Barcelos names \"D. Elvira Gualtar\" as the mother of \"D. Urraca Alonso, D. Teresa Alonso\" daughters of \"D. Alonso Enriquez\" .\n\nKing Afonso I & his wife had seven children:\n\n1. Infante dom HENRIQUE de Portugal (5 Mar 1147-[before 1156]). Brandaõ quotes a manuscript about the works of San Fulgencio in the archives of Alcobaça which records the birth III Non [Mar] of primogenitus...Henricus filius, which from the context refers to March 1147 .\n\n2. Infanta dona MAFALDA de Portugal ([1149]-[1173/74]) . A Chronica Breve names \"dona Mafalda\" first among the daughters of King Afonso I, adding that she married \"comde Reymon de Barcelona\" (although this source is inaccurate in other details) . Betrothed ([30 Jan 1160]) to RAMÓN de Barcelona, Infante de Aragón, son of RAMÓN BERENGUER IV Conde de Barcelona & Petronilla Queen of Aragon (Villamayor del Valle, Huesca 1/25 Mar 1157-Perpignan 25 Apr 1195, bur Poblet, monastery of Nuestra Señora), who succeeded his father in 1162 as Conde de Barcelona and his mother in 1174 as don ALFONSO II King of Aragon.\n\n3. Infanta dona URRACA de Portugal ([1151]-Valladolid 16 Oct 1188) . The De Rebus Hispaniæ of Rodericus Ximenes names \"Sancium et Urracam et aliam filiam Tarasia\" as the children of \"Aldefonsum\" & his wife, specifying that Urraca married \"Fernandi Regis Legionensis\" . The Chronicon Lusitanum records that D. Orracam daughter of Rex Donnus Alfonsus and his wife Donnam Matildam, Comitis Amadæi de Moriana filiam married Regi Legionensium Donno Fernando, adding in a later passage that they married in Aug 1209 (1171) . The Crónica Latina records that el rey Fernando married Urraca, hija de Alfonso rey de Portugal but that they were related in the third degree of consanguinity . \"Regina Sancia comitis Raymundi et regine Urrache regia proles\" donated an inn near Mucientes to Sahagún monastery by charter dated 15 Mar 1158, subscribed by \"Regina Urracha de Asturias, Stephania Infantissa filia imperatoris \" . The dating clause of a charter dated 13 Feb 1171 records \"regnante Rege Donno F. in Legione, Galesia, Asturiis et Extrematus cum uxore sua regina donna Urracha\" . Lucas de Tuy records that \"Rex Fernandus\" repudiated \"uxorem suam Urracam filiam Regis Adefonsi, eo quod erat consanguinea eius propinquo gradu\" . m ([May/Jun] 1165, repudiated [Feb 1171/1172]) as his first wife, FERNANDO II King of León, son of ALFONSO VII \"el Emperador\" King of Castile and León & his first wife Berenguela de Barcelona (1137-Benavente 22 Jan 1188, bur Santiago de Compostela, Cathedral Santiago el Mayor).\n\n4. Infanta dona SANCHA de Portugal ([1152/53]-14 Feb ----). Sousa says that the necrology of Santa Cruz de Coimbra records the death 14 Feb of Infanta D. Sancha daughter of King Afonso I but does not quote the original text or give the precise citation reference .\n\n5. Infante dom SANCHO Martino de Portugal (Coimbra 11 Nov 1154-Coimbra 26 Mar 1212, bur Coimbra, Church of the Cross) . The De Rebus Hispaniæ of Rodericus Ximenes names \"Sancium et Urracam et aliam filiam Tarasia\" as the children of \"Aldefonsum\" & his wife . He succeeded his father in 1185 as SANCHO I o Poblador King of Portugal.\n\n- see below.\n\n6. Infante dom JOÃO ([1156]-25 Aug ----). Brandaõ quotes the necrology of Santa Cruz de Coimbra which records the death VIII Kal Sep of Ioannes infans donni Alfonsi regis Portugalliæ et donnæ Mafaldæ reginæ filius .\n\n7. Infanta dona TERESA de Portugal ([1157]-drowned off Furnes, Flanders 6 May 1218, bur Abbaye de Clairvaux, Jura) . The De Rebus Hispaniæ of Rodericus Ximene s names \"Sancium et Urracam et aliam filiam Tarasia\" as the children of \"Aldefonsum\" & his wife, specifying that Teresa married \"Philippo Comiti Flandriæ et Hannoniæ\" and died childless .
