She married Ferdinand II of León (c. 1165) with whom she had Alfonso IX of León. This marriage failed to prevent her father Afonso I from declaring war on Ferdinand after he became his son-in-law. This short war culminated in disaster when Afonso was captured in Badajoz. Perhaps due to his marriage to Urraca, Ferdinand was generous to Afonso, and let him leave. However, the marriage of Ferdinand II and Urraca was annulled in 1175 by the Pope, the two being second cousins, great-grandchildren of Alfonso VI of León and Castile. That this was political in nature is shown by Ferdinand's remarriage to Teresa Fernández de Traba, the half-aunt of Urraca and thus a generation closer to Alfonso VI.\n\nAfter the dissolution of her marriage, Urraca returned to the court of her father at Valladolid, and died there, aged only 37, nine months after the death of her former husband.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nThere are no references cited for ths Wikipedia article.2\n\nNote on Marriage to Fernando II OF LEÓN\n\nannulled 1175\n\nSources\n\n1Weis, Frederick Lewis & Sheppard, Walter Lee, Jr, \"Ancestral Roots of Certain American Colonists Who Came to America before 1700: Lineages from Alfred the Great, Charlemagne, Malcolm of Scotland, Robert the Strong, and other Historical Individuals\". p 112, 112-26; 114, 114-26."
