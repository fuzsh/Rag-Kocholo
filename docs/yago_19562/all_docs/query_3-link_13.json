        "text": "Afonso VI (born Aug. 21, 1643, Lisbon—died Sept. 12, 1683, Sintra, Port.) was the king of Portugal, whose reign was marked by internal disputes between his partisans and those of his brother Pedro.\n\nAfonso succeeded his father, John IV, in 1656, but his mother acted as regent until 1662. His reign saw a series of victories against Spain, including the battles of Ameixal (1663), Castelo Rodrigo (1664), and Montes Claros (1665), which in 1668 led to Spanish recognition of Portuguese independence. When Afonso’s wife left him, their marriage was annulled on grounds of his incapacity. She married his brother, the future Peter II, who was declared Defender of the Realm. After surrendering the throne in 1667, Afonso was kept a virtual prisoner in the Azores and at Sintra until his death."
