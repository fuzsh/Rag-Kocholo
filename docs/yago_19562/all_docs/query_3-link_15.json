        "text": "Portugal royalty news - Prince Afonso of Portugal, the heir to the Portuguese throne if Portugal were a monarchy, is one of Europeâ€™s most sought-out bachelors. Who is the Crown Prince of Portugal?\n\nPortugalâ€™s golden Prince, Afonso de BraganÃ§a, Prince of Beira, is the eldest son of the Duke of BraganÃ§a who would have been King if Portugal were a monarchy. His eldest son, Prince Afonso of Portugal was born on March 25, 1996, and is now 27 years old.\n\nWho is the Crown Prince of Portugal?\n\nWhen he turned 18 in 2015, Prince Afonso de BraganÃ§a was consecrated Crown Prince of Portugal.\n\nPortugalâ€™s would-be heir to the throne, Prince Afonso has a bachelorâ€™s degree in political science and international relations from the Catholic University of Portugal. Prince Afonso of Portugal is a discreet young man with a good reputation. Moreover, he has no known romantic relationship and is therefore seen as one of the most sought-out bachelors of the European aristocracy.\n\nPortugalâ€™s Prince Afonso is already a subject of matchmaking conversations, and among the most favorable relationships for the young heir to the Portuguese throne are the heirs to the Spanish throne, since this would unite the two Iberian countries.\n\nAmong potential wives that are perceived for the young Portuguese Prince is the niece of King Juan Carlos 1, Victoria Federica de Todos os Santos de Marichalar e Bourbon who was born in September 2000.\n\nHowever, the Portuguese aristocracy is not placing much emphasis on royal unions and very recently, on October 7th, 2023, Portuguese Princess Maria Francisca de BraganÃ§a married lawyer Duarte de Sousa AraÃºjo Martins."
