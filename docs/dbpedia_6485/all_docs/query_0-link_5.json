        "text": "To help you make informed decisions this election year, KATU News is publishing a series of interviews with people who will appear on your ballot.\n\nWe are asking local candidates running for the same office the same series of questions, so you can compare their answers.\n\nWe sent questionnaires to candidates for this office. We will post them as we receive them.\n\nOther candidates running for this office:\n\nWHO ARE YOU?\n\nI am a graduate of the US AF Academy and a former B-52 pilot, Goodwill Director, and a veteran 18-year State Legislator. I have 16 years’ experience serving on the election committee and have served as Chair of the Elections Committee in the Senate. I am a proven statewide leader and expert on election issues and the only person with professional Audit and Quality experience in both government and the private sector. The next Secretary of State needs to be an audit, performance, and quality expert with the passion, knowledge and experience who can solve the problems in, and fix our election system in a nonpartisan manner.\n\nWHY ARE YOU RUNNING?\n\nI intend to fight for election integrity and pass the policies needed to make our election system the best and fairest and most trustworthy in our Country. I intend to reach out and rally the county auditors and activists and leaders in both parties and build a bipartisan statewide movement that will bring integrity and trust back to our election system. The appointed incumbent will do nothing to address the current concerns of many Washingtonians, while I will measurably fix our current system.\n\nWHAT MAKES YOU UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO BE WASHINGTON’S SECRETARY OF STATE?\n\nI have a proven record for being a passionate fighter for justice and integrity. I know how to implement audits and quality in all our county election system, and bring true transparency and accountability to every process\n\nHOW WOULD YOU IMPROVE ELECTION SECURITY IN WASHINGTON STATE, IF AT ALL?\n\nI would insure we have a voter ID system in place to accurately ensure all voters meet all legal requirements and record consistently this metric. I would pass legislation to set up and fund election Fraud, Audit and Quality Divisions to insure election security and integrity and benchmark results between all WA counties and all 50 states. With constant audits, results of all elections will be proven trustworthy.\n\nHOW CAN YOU AS SECRETARY OF STATE HELP INCREASE VOTER TURNOUT?\n\nPromote greater participation by public in all election processes such as observers, PCOs, voter registrations, and integrity. We will investigate all claims of voter suppression and insure equal opportunity for all citizens.\n\nDO YOU SEE ANY SERIOUS THREATS TO OUR DEMOCRACY? IF SO, WHAT ARE THEY AND WHAT WILL YOU DO TO STOP THEM?\n\nYes, very much so. Our constitutional Democracy will continue to deteriorate, and ultimately fail soon, if we do not heed President John Adams warning, “Our constitution was only made for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other.”\n\nEvery poll indicates things are getting worse in America, and many people and candidate are oblivious to the danger and threats. Unless WA reverts to reason, science, and a consistent morality or faith, we can expect division, violence, and madness to increase, and our political divide will worsen. I intend to help lead, promote, and bring integrity and basic values, such as described in RCW 28A.150.211, back to our election systems, governments, and our culture. These basic values and character traits are essential to individual liberty, fulfillment, and happiness and our Democracy. Bringing these traits to the Secretary of State’s office and to our election system will be essential to restoring trust and integrity to our government and culture.\n\nWHAT IS THE SECRETARY OF STATE’S MOST IMPORTANT JOB?\n\nBe a passionate, effective moral leader for government integrity and just results, without being biased or partisan.\n\nWHAT WILL BE YOUR TOP PRIORTIY, IF ELECTED?\n\nIntegrity in everything we do.\n\nWHO IS YOUR HERO, AND WHY?\n\nOther than recognizing Jesus Christ as my savior, the Rev MLK Jr has best exemplified true justice and sacrifice for the greater good."
