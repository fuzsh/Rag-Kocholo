        "text": "Federal\n\nWashington State 3rd Congressional District\n\nCarolyn Long (D) v. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-incumbent)\n\nCarolyn Long is a political science professor at Washington State University in Vancouver who teaches constitutional law, civil liberties and judicial process. She has a strong statement on gun violence on her website and is endorsed by The Alliance for Gun Responsibility.\n\nHer competitor, Jaime Herrera Beutler, has the NRA’s “A” rating as a legislator, meaning that she has been consistently supportive of the NRA position on gun rights during her tenure in office.\n\nThe race was originally not thought to be competitive — Beutler is seeking a fifth term — but after Long carried Clark County in the primaries, “this one-time long shot has developed into a competitive race,” per the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan political analysis newsletter.\n\nIf Long wins in November, the Congressional seat would flip from Republican to Democrat.\n\nFederal\n\nWashington State 5th Congressional District\n\nLisa Brown (D) v. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-incumbent)\n\nLisa Brown has held statewide office before, both in the House and Senate. She has strong record on health issues including increasing mental health insurance coverage.\n\nThis district is located in eastern Washington and has elected Republicans to this seat for two decades, making Brown's near tie with McMorris Rodgers in the primary national news.\n\nBrown is endorsed by both Moms Demand Action and The Alliance for Gun Responsibility. In February, she published a formal statement regarding gun violence following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Fla.\n\nThis seat would flip from Republican to Democrat should Brown win in November.\n\nState\n\nWashington State Senate 6th Legislative District\n\nJessa Lewis (D) v. Jeff Holy (R)\n\nJessa Lewis has a varied background as a park ranger, timber sale planner and, most recently, the eastern Washington director of Health Care for All, which promotes single payer health plan.\n\nShe's also open about her stance on guns. \"Jessa grew up in a household where hunting was how they put food on the table and as a teenager she competed in marksmanship in 4-H,\" reads her website. \"She currently has a concealed carry permit.\"\n\nLewis is also endorsed by both the Alliance for Gun Responsibility and Moms Demand Action."
