        "text": "I’m running for Secretary of State to restore trust and integrity to government, especially our election systems. From registering voters, to eliminating irregularities, and to auditing and validating all votes, I will insure 100% accuracy and compliance with laws!\n\nWe need a passionate, experienced leader to head this critical agency who will work with county auditors and fight for election integrity and fairness. I’ve spoken to many Washingtonians, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike, who feel as I do that our concerns with government performance are not welcome. It shouldn’t be controversial for Washingtonians to ask for transparency or demand audits and evidence of zero fraud. Yet many who have merely asked questions about problems or irregularities, have been mocked, silenced, or labeled as conspiracy theorists.\n\nCitizen oversight over government is uniquely American! I will support all people, of any political party or belief, who want to be involved to ensure that their voices, and the voices of all others, are heard.\n\nIf I accomplish one result as Secretary of State, it would be to ensure that all Washingtonians are 100% convinced that elections were accomplished with integrity, and the results are true. I would be honored to get your vote!"
