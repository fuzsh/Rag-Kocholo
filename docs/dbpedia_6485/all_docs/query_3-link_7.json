        "text": "The Mirror is providing an opportunity for District 30 state representative candidates to speak to readers in their own words by answering questions related to Federal Way voters.\n\nCandidates Mark Miloscia and Shawn Sullivan answer the following question: Describe a successful accomplishment related to leadership, whether in public or private life, and how it relates to serving voters in the 30th District.\n\n———-\n\nMark Miloscia\n\nFive years ago, I brought together a diverse coalition of businesses, nonprofits and bipartisan elected officials to help draft and pass a series of significant new legislation that completely reformed the way our state addressed homelessness. Based on a creative homeless reform initiative by the Bush Administration, Washington became the first state in the nation to set up a “Ten Year Plan to End Homeless” that focused on real results, not just spending money to house the homeless.\n\nThis nationally recognized legislation included a number of groundbreaking accountability and program initiatives. Our state now focuses on the root causes of homelessness and our new state goal is to move people to self-sufficiency, rather than keeping people in expensive long-term housing. Other key changes include mandated quality audits of certain program vendors, publishing key indicators to measure the performance of our homeless efforts, and required yearly “One Night Counts” of homeless individuals all across this state.\n\nWe should all be very proud that our own City of Federal Way and many of our local business, civic and nonprofit leaders have taken up this effort to count the homeless in our midst each year and work to reduce this “hurt” in our community.\n\nSubsequently, I was honored by the federal U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness in Washington, D.C., and received their 2008 State Legislative Award “in recognition of political will, partnership, and innovation in ending chronic homelessness.”\n\nFast facts: Miloscia, a Democrat, is currently serving his sixth term in office.\n\nWebsite: www.markmiloscia.com\n\n———-\n\nShawn Sullivan\n\nIn my career in the Army, I became an innovative team builder who expedited projects and reduced operating costs. In my most challenging mission, I organized unrelated personnel into team-centered project units. These projects strengthened my leadership skills, and I developed as a negotiator. These skills are critical in serving the 30th District because I am working with people who have diverse views and interests. The ability to balance those interests is crucial to provide for the needs of our district."
