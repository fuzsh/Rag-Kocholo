        "text": "The race is on to replace indicted Washington State Auditor Troy Kelley. Republican state Senator Mark Miloscia announced Thursday he will campaign for the seat in 2016.\n\nIn a statement, Miloscia said Kelley, a Democrat, has brought “shame and embarrassment” to the office of state auditor. Miloscia said he will “bring back respect and leadership.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Miloscia has run for state auditor. In 2012, he campaigned as a Democrat, but lost to Kelley in the primary. Miloscia then switched parties and was elected to the state Senate. He’s been a vocal critic of Kelley’s since the auditor was indicted in April on charges related to his former real estate services business.\n\nKelley has pleaded not guilty to all charges and his trial is scheduled for next March. He is on an indefinite leave of absence, but previously vowed to return to office vindicated.\n\nKelley has not said if he plans to run for re-election next year."
