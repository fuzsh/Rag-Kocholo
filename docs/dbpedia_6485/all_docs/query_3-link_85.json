        "text": "Who will be our state's Ron Desantis?\n\nMark Miloscia, Family Policy Insitute of Washington|Apr 28, 2022\n\nThrough multiple initiatives, the Biden Administration is promoting harmful lies. In a direct, panicked response to states across the country successfully passing bills that protect women's sports, the morally corrupt U.S. Department of Education is amending Title IX rules for college sports, making it illegal to discriminate against athletes on the basis of \"gender identity\" and sexual orientation. In other words, biological men will be able to compete against women. Schools will be forced to...\n\nWhy is UW trafficking baby body parts?\n\nMark Miloscia, Family Policy Institute of Washington|Apr 7, 2022\n\nA group of pro-life organizations uncovered a freezer at University of Washington containing the remains of aborted babies, exposing the university’s cruel and evil experimentation. The groups released a photo showing bags that contained the fetal body parts. The Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust, Pro-Life San Francisco and Rehumanize International located the freezer “by examining invoices previously exposed via public records requests by Indiana Right to...\n\nSchool district set racist policy\n\nMark Miloscia, Family Policy Institute of Washington|Mar 31, 2022\n\nThe cult of social justice is perpetuating racism in the Clover Park School District with a new student discipline policy requiring staff to consider a student’s race and background before determining their punishment. Instead of disciplining students consistently based on conduct, as justice would require, it is mandating discrimination based on race. In other words, skin color determines whether one receives easy or harsh punishment for the same offense. Isn’t this the textbook definition of...\n\nVaccination, mask mandates erode parental rights\n\nMark Miloscia, Executive director Family Policy Institute of Washington|Sep 2, 2021\n\nIt’s clear: Parents in Washington are sick of their children being used as pawns by radicals in power who wish to destroy family, children, and faith. Widespread protests against mask mandates at school and vaccine mandates at work have erupted statewide, with many calling out Gov. Jay Inslee for his aggressive misuses and abuses of emergency powers. This has largely been a fight for religious freedom and individual liberty, but it is creeping onto another deeply disturbing frontier — the fig...\n\nVaccination segregation coming soon\n\nMark Miloscia, Family Policy Institute of Washington|Aug 26, 2021\n\nIt has now has been over 530 days since Gov. Jay Inslee proclaimed a state of emergency and again issued another order without going through the Legislature. He ordered that all state employees and health care professionals working in private facilities must get the COVID-19 vaccine or face termination. Workers have until Oct. 18 to show proof of full vaccination. If they do not, they will likely be shown the door with “non-disciplinary dismissal.” It is beyond debatable that the governor has...\n\nWhy is Olympia still locked down?\n\nMark Miloscia, Family Policy Institute of Washington|Apr 15, 2021\n\nThe world is beginning to unfreeze after more than a year of physical and economic lockdowns. Many states have ended mask mandates, citing increasing vaccinations and decreasing cases. Others are allowing normal activities to resume. By and large, it seems as though America is ready to turn a corner and return to normal life. That is, unless you're in Washington. As our state Legislature moves closer and closer towards the conclusion of its 2021 session, the Capitol in Olympia still sits in...\n\nThe Age of Derangement\n\nMark Miloscia|Dec 31, 2020\n\nSince the moment our founders signed their names to the bottom of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, the U.S. has been organized by a successful moral and ethical code. We were a nation formed by protestant immigrants and a smattering of Catholics that broke free of England under a new Constitution and Bill of Rights. Over time, Catholics, American Indian, blacks, Hispanics, Asians and other new Americans, to include Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, and atheists, have...\n\nAll churches should be open\n\nMark Miloscia|Sep 24, 2020\n\nAbout 800 miles south of my office, the leaders of North Valley Baptist Church in Santa Clara, Calif., are no doubt having conversations about how to move forward. The church, which was mandated to close and remain closed earlier this year due to California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Santa Clara county’s decrees, chose not to comply. After moving ahead with what they believed was the mission of the church, they are now faced with more than $52,000 in fines from various governments and agencies. H..."
