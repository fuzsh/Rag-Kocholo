        "text": "Rep. Rick Larsen is a moderate Democrat who is seeking his eleventh term representing Washington's 2nd Congressional District. Before serving in Congress, he served on the Snohomish County Council and worked on economic development for the City of Everett.\n\nLarsen has been a reliable vote on House Democrats' legislation. Since his last election, he voted for both the bipartisan infrastructure bill and Build Back Better, President Biden's more ambitious effort to fund clean energy, child tax credits, and other progressive priorities. In past years, Larsen supported the Lower Drug Costs Now Act to give Medicare the power to negotiate directly with the drug companies and pass on the lower drug prices to all Americans. He also voted for the Voting Rights Advancement Act, supported the coronavirus pandemic relief packages, and sought to reform student loans.\n\nLarsen has faced criticism from some on the left, including Jason Call, for not supporting more ambitious policies and legislation. Larsen declined to sponsor Rep. Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal and Rep. Jayapal's Medicare for All Act, which earned the support of more than half of the House Democrats. Larsen also continues to raise significant amounts of money from corporate PACs, including the oil and gas industries, according to OpenSecrets.org.\n\nLarsen is a reliable Democratic vote and has earned the support of all our progressive partner organizations who chose to endorse in this race. Larsen is a good choice if you're looking for a steady, moderate voice in Congress.\n\nDemocrat Steve Hobbs is running to retain his position as secretary of state for the remainder of the two-year term. He is a first-generation Japanese American and 30-year member of the military, serving tours in Kosovo and Iraq before becoming a lieutenant colonel in the Washington Army National Guard.\n\nHobbs was appointed as secretary of state in November of last year after Kim Wyman resigned to join the Biden administration. Prior to his appointment, he served four terms in the Washington state Senate representing the 44th Legislative District. His voting record was consistently progressive on social issues and more conservative on taxes, environmental issues, and workers' rights.\n\nDuring his first eight months in office, Hobbs has been laser-focused on protecting our electoral systems from attacks. He has used his background in national security to partner closely with the Department of Homeland Security to stop digital threats to our voting systems, both foreign and domestic. Hobbs also understands the challenge misinformation poses to the integrity of our elections. He has been working to set up a division within his office specifically to combat misinformation and wants to work closely with social media companies to ensure they take down dangerous conspiracy theories.\n\nAs many things re-open from the pandemic, Hobbs is committed to restarting his office's voter outreach program. He is very enthusiastic about a trusted messenger program he's launching to utilize community leaders to talk about the importance of voting. He also wants to improve outreach to reduce the racial disparities in rejected ballots because of signature mismatches.\n\nThe only issue of concern with Hobbs is his personal opposition to ranked choice voting. During our interview, he shared that he's concerned about implementing a complicated new voting system at a moment of low trust in our elections. He is particularly concerned that voters like his mother, who speaks English as a second language, will have a difficult time learning and participating in the new system.\n\nHobbs made a compelling case that the secretary of state must adapt to the new and complex challenges of running modern elections. Hobbs is a good choice if you're looking for someone with national security experience to safeguard and rebuild trust in our electoral system."
