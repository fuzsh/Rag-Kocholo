        "text": "For Immediate Release: February 19, 2018\n\nContact: Claire Wilson, 253-237-4799\n\nWilson will challenge Republican Mark Miloscia in Democratic leaning swing district\n\nFEDERAL WAY- Claire Wilson, President of the Federal Way School Board and career education professional will challenge Republican State Senator Mark Miloscia in the 30th Legislative District. Wilson, a mother of two children who attended Federal Way Schools, worked for over three decades in PreK-12 education-teaching at risk and non-traditional students before a 25-year career at the state’s largest Educational Service District, leading pre-K, parent engagement, and other programs in school districts throughout King and Pierce Counties.\n\n“I have spent my life working to help children and families get access to education and opportunity,” said Wilson, who has worked as a school board member to improve outcomes at Federal Way Schools-including graduation rates and preparedness for career or higher education. “We need leaders in Olympia with that same commitment to helping all people, uniting communities and investing in our children and our future. Instead, we see too much partisanship and too many excuses in a State Senate that has for too long been mired in gridlock.”\n\nWilson, who has never sought partisan office, will run as a Democrat against longtime incumbent Miloscia, who has also run two unsuccessful statewide elections for State Auditor in the past 6 years, once as a Democrat and the other as a Republican.\n\n“My opponent cynically changed parties to try and improve his chances at election, has carried a hardline conservative voting record, and now proven twice that he’d rather have another job than serving the people of the 30th district,” said Wilson. “I have no interest in statewide office, I am only running to continue working for the families of our region-who need leaders focused on their needs, not partisan ambitions.”\n\nIn addition to leadership on education, Wilson will focus on improving efficiency in transportation investments and protecting health care access and affordability-issues central to a strong local economy and healthy, secure families.\n\n“We are a growing region with a strong economy, but when too many of us are stuck in traffic and too many working people, women, and seniors are struggling with access to quality, affordable health care, something is very wrong,” said Wilson. “We can hold transportation agencies accountable to taxpayers-not to create political problems and delays, but to streamline delivery of highway improvements, light rail and other transit needs. On health care, we need strong policies that reject Federal rollbacks of Medicare and family planning, and make sure we direct needed funds to mental health coverage for children.”\n\nWilson, who will formally kick of her campaign in the coming weeks, intends to run a strong door-to-door campaign meeting with voters throughout the district, which includes Federal Way, parts of Auburn and Milton.\n\n“I’m excited to continue meeting with voters to discuss issues and hear ideas on how we can unite around common values to solve problems,” said Wilson. “There is so much divisiveness in our politics these days-we need a positive approach focused on the need of people, not parties and special interests.”"
