Sam Johnson [chairman of the subcommittee] presiding. Present: Representatives Johnson, Kline, McKeon, Platts, Tiberi, Wilson, Musgrave, Foxx, Kildee, Payne, McCarthy, Tierney, McCollum and Grijalva. Staff Present: Robert Borden, General Counsel; Byron Campbell, Legislative Assistant; Steve Forde, Communications Director; Aron Griffin, Professional Staff Member; Jessica Gross, Legislative Assistant; Richard Hoar, Professional Staff Member; Kimberly Ketchel, Deputy Press Secretary; Jim Paretti, Workforce Policy counsel; Steve Perrotta, Professional Staff Member; Molly Mclaughlin Salmi, Deputy Director of Workforce Policy; Deborah L.

Chairman Johnson. Good morning, everyone. A quorum being present, the Subcommittee on Employer-Employee Relations of the Committee on Education and the Workforce will come to order. We are holding this hearing today to hear testimony on examining the impact of State mandates on employer-provided health insurance. Under committee rule 12(b), opening statements are limited to the chairman, the ranking minority member of the subcommittee. Therefore, if other members have statements, they will be included in the hearing record. With that, I ask unanimous consent for the hearing record to remain open 14 days to allow member statements and other extraneous material referenced during the hearing to be submitted in the official hearing record. Hearing no objection, so ordered. Good morning, again. Let me extend a warm welcome to all of you, to the ranking member, Mr. Andrews, who isn't here, and my other colleagues who are here. Most folks know I have a devout respect for democracy. Some of the cornerstones of democracy include freedom and free enterprise. Another hallmark of democracy is empowering States and cities and counties to be the laboratories of ideas, and as local areas experiment, the best ideas always seem to rise to the top. Today I want to hear what local areas are doing to find health insurance solutions. Are they increasing the insured? Are they protecting patients? Are the costs rising or declining? We can use these test cases, if you will, to see what works and what doesn't. In Congress, we have a civic obligation to make sure that the proposals developing in the States don't override Federal law. That is especially true when it comes to health insurance because, one, peoples' lives are on the line; two, the laws that govern many health insurance plans are protected by Federal law called ERISA. As you know, the vast majority of Americans with health insurance have their coverage through an employer. Let's be clear, employer-provided health insurance is a benefit to the employee. It is not mandatory. Governments that value freedom and free enterprise don't tell businesses how to operate. If States are tinkering with ERISA, we must make sure that the results are fair and have no unintended consequences, or, worse, giant problems in the future. Close to Capitol Hill, we all watched the State of Maryland chart a new course. In Maryland, some believe that employers must be forced not only to provide health coverage to their employees but to provide a specific set or level of benefits. For example, a much discussed law that recently passed in Maryland seeks to penalize companies--well, at this point, only a single company--that do not provide what politicians deem adequate health insurance for employees. In short, the folks in the State Capitol of Maryland are legislating what one company must do for its employees. In my mind, mandating certain health benefits on one company from a State Capitol, that is not freedom and that is not free enterprise. I am very concerned about what that would mean in the future for people, for States and for companies. There is such a thing as good government. Overreaching government, it is not. Listen, as a former State legislator in Texas, I am happy to see these State legislatures working on solutions for the uninsured. However, I am deeply alarmed that some of these proposals override the good intentions of ERISA, the Federal law that governs employer benefits. I am also concerned that these proposals largely ignore the problem of skyrocketing insurance costs and instead simply add additional burdens on employers and their employees who may end up with the short end of the stick. As such, today we will hear from large and small business owners on how legislation in their States would affect their employees' livelihood and their businesses. In addition, we will hear from someone who can look at the issue from 30,000 feet and talk about potential results of enacting such mandates. I welcome our witnesses and look forward to their testimony today. I now yield to the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Payne, today for whatever opening statement you wish to make, sir. [The prepared statement of Chairman Johnson follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Sam Johnson, Chairman, Subcommittee on Employer-Employee Relations Good morning.

Thank you, very much, Mr. Chairman, and let me thank you for calling this very important hearing examining the impact of State mandates on employer-provided health insurance. I think your background in the State legislature before coming here to Congress certainly sits you well on this committee. Let me just say, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about what States are doing to address the health care crisis facing our country covering the uninsured. The urgent crisis demands our continued attention and debate; 46 million Americans are uninsured, and millions more are struggling to pay the skyrocketing cost of health care, and many are underinsured. So we really have a crisis, a dilemma in health care. I think really it is a crisis that has to be shared by all of us. We have to come up with a solution to the problem because it is a gigantic problem, and our Nation's health is going to be very important to our future development. This is a life or death problem, as we know. The Institute of Medicine estimates that 18,000 Americans die unnecessarily each year because they lack health insurance. That is here in the United States of America, not a Third World country. People who need health care or medication are risking their lives because they just can't afford needed care. As we talk about this, I hope that we can keep in mind the families that are forced to decide between paying for cancer treatments or their weekly groceries. With the skyrocketing cost of petrol and home heating fuel coming up this winter, serious dilemmas and crises are going to impact even millions more Americans. I hope that we can think of the families who are trying to figure out how to keep a loved one alive and healthy when they are hit with a illness they simply can't afford to live for. While health care costs are always a major problem for low- income workers, even people who have health insurance are having trouble keeping up with the bills, as we all here know. A survey done by USA Today to Kaiser Family Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health found that 62 percent of people struggling to pay their bills actually have health insurance. The Labor Center at Berkley recently reported that Americans who have job-based family coverage paid 50 percent more for their health care in 2004 than they did in 2000, an a increase of $3,264 in out-of-pocket costs. I would like to see this Congress do something to really address the rising cost of health care, to find creative ways to cover those people who can't afford it. But until that happens, we must not stand in the way of States that are working hard to come up with ways to provide their citizens with quality, affordable health care. I have good, honest employers in my district who are working hard to provide health care to their employees. Rather than being rewarded for prioritizing the health of their workers, these employers are at an unfair disadvantage and are unable to compete with the larger employer, especially highly profitable ones that refuse to provide health care for their employees. I understand that some of our witnesses today are opposed to requiring even those very large employers to provide workers with health coverage. I also know that, in my State, Wal-Mart tops the list of employers with employees on New Jersey Family Care, our State's Medicaid program, with 589 employees in the program. Currently, in New Jersey, there is legislation pending that is similar to the Maryland legislation which requires companies with over 10,000 employees to spend 8 percent of their payroll on health care or pay the State the difference. There is also a bill that would require companies with at least 1,000 employees to pay at least $4.17 per hour on health care. So, as I conclude, this is a timely and important issue to discuss. I know that companies are trying to do better. I know Wal-Mart has started some scholarship programs and is discussing these issues. We can't have a piecemeal approach, and I think that we really have to take this issue head on. I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Johnson. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Payne. I figured I would yield back before you said it. Chairman Johnson. You all watch those lights. The green light comes on, you have got 5 minutes. When the little yellow light comes on, you have 1 minute. And we would appreciate it if you would try to close it down when the red light comes on, unlike Mr. Payne, who went a half a second over. Mr. Payne. I am color blind. Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Payne. We have got a distinguished panel of witnesses before us today, and I thank you all for coming, and I would like to introduce them one at a time. Mr. Greg Garthwaite is a research fellow in economics at the Employment Policies Institute where he manages research projects with labor economists at major universities across the country. Mr. Garthwaite's research focuses on issues such as minimum wage, health care mandates and the economic benefits of employment.

So I would like to recognize the first witness, from my left to my right, for your testimony, sir. STATEMENT OF CRAIG GARTHWAITE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EMPLOYMENT POLICIES INSTITUTE Mr. Garthwaite. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, ranking member, members of the committee, for inviting me to testify today. My name is Greg Garthwaite, and I am a research fellow in economics at the Employment Policies Institute. Founded in 1991, EPI is a nonprofit research organization dedicated to studying public policy issues surrounding employment growth. In particular, EPI focuses on issues that affect entry-level employment. The vast majority of employees receive health insurance through their employer. Recent escalations in the cost of health insurance, however, has put added pressure on the continuation of these benefits. Faced with double-digit increases in premium costs, many employers are changing their health plans by either requiring employees to pay a larger share of the cost, increasing copays and deductibles, or restricting coverage in general. Economists at Dartmouth University found these higher rates for employer-provided insurance have already led to significant job loss throughout the economy. As a result of these factors, a recent Gallup Poll ranked health care as the public's top concern. Over two-thirds of Americans said they personally worry a great deal about the affordability and availability of health care. Due to these facts, it is no surprise that States have devoted so much energy this year to health care legislation. If States were examining policies that attempted to address the fundamentals behind the dramatic increases, their efforts would go toward expanding coverage. Unfortunately, States are largely avoiding this potentially productive discussion, instead, with the most blunt policy tool available, simply requiring someone to pay for it. Invariably these efforts are focused on forcing all employers to provide health benefits to their employees. Nominally, they require for increased coverage. Research shows, however, that the burden of these mandates will actually fall on employees through decreased job opportunities and wages. Economic studies on mandated benefits reveal that, where possible, employers will pass these new costs onto their employees through lower wages. For the least skilled employees in the economy, lower wages are often not an option. Government data shows approximately 43 percent of all uninsured employees are working at or near the minimum wage. Bound by the minimum, employers are forced to react to the newly imposed health cost through layoffs. The end result is the least skilled employees in the economy end up footing the bill for these newly mandated benefits, often with their jobs. As a result, many of these employees are forced to confront the bitter irony of a bill designed to provide employer-based coverage, leaving them with neither an employer or coverage. The recent history of employer-mandated health care can be traced back to California's Proposition 72. This initiative would have employers with more than 20 employees provide individual health coverage, and those with more than 200 employees provide family insurance. Economists estimated that this legislation would have cost California employers upwards of $12.9 billion and up to 150,000 jobs would have been destroyed. Furthermore, those who lost their jobs would have been disproportionately younger, poor, less educated and minority. While Proposition 72 narrowly lost at the ballot box in 2004, the defeat did nothing to stem the tide of these costly mandates. In 2005, legislators in Washington debated the Health Care Responsibility Act, a similarly destructive mandate. This year, 26 States considered legislation requiring employers to provide health benefits to their employees. The legislation varied significantly across the States. Some were limited to employers of a certain size while others sought to require a minimum level of benefit. High cost and fewer jobs may be justifiable if these mandates significantly reduce the problem of the uninsured. But research shows that employer mandates, due to their dependence on the workplace as the source of insurance, do little to address the problem of the uninsured. Often they leave the vast majority of uninsured without new coverage. In California, for example, the $12.9 billion dollars in new spending would have only decreased the uninsured population by 31 percent, a shocking cost of nearly $6,600 per newly insured individual. Due to poor targeting, only 30 to 35 cents of every dollar spent on the legislation would have gone toward the uninsured. Similar results should be expected from any mandate that attempts to address the problem of the uninsured solely through the labor market. Often the very characteristics that have left these employees without insurance in the first place deny them the benefit of workplace dependent mandates. True progress toward addressing the pressing problem of rising health cost and the uninsured will not come from simply shifting the cost and the responsibility onto the backs of employers. Rising health care costs have made it prohibitively expensive for many small businesses to either offer or continue to offer coverage. These same hire rates already contributed to significant job loss throughout the economy. It is critical that States and Congress attempt to enact meaningful reforms to our health care market that will actually decrease the number of uninsured instead of simply trying to pass the buck. Thank you. I am happy to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Garthwaite follows:] Prepared Statement of Craig Garthwaite, Research Fellow in Economics, Employment Policies Institute Thank you Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member and members of the subcommittee for inviting me to testify today. My name is Craig Garthwaite, Research Fellow in Economics at the Employment Policies Institute. Founded in 1991, the Employment Policies Institute is a non- profit research organization dedicated to studying public policy issues surrounding employment growth. In particular, EPI focuses on issues that affect entry-level employment. It is supported by contributions from private citizens and businesses and foundations. We also engage a panel of distinguished academic advisors, including Dr. James Heckman, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, Dr. June O'Neil the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, and Dr. Kevin Murphy, a recipient of the 2005 MacArthur ``Genius'' Grant. A recent Gallup poll ranked health-care as the public's top concern. Over two-thirds of Americans said they personally worry ``a great deal'' about affordability and availability of health-care. While policy issues are often cyclical, it is likely that health-care will remain a top concern for the foreseeable future. As our population ages there will be increasing demands on our health-care system. At the same time, companies in all industries are striving to restrain costs to better compete in the global economy. Many are finding it increasingly difficult to provide the kind of comprehensive health coverage the public has come to expect. It is no surprise then that state legislatures are engaged in robust deliberations on health-care issues. Their efforts have largely been driven by the goal of expanding the number of people with health insurance. These efforts try to cement coverage that is already in place and reduce the ranks of the uninsured With these policy currents, naturally, states have devoted a great deal of energy this year to health-care legislation. Unfortunately, most of their efforts have been misdirected. Rather then delve into the underlying pressures that make health insurance increasingly unaffordable, state lawmakers have largely directed their energies at determining who should pay for it. Invariably, there efforts have focused on forcing employers to provide health benefits to their employees. Employer-Provided Health-Care In many respects, employer-provided health benefits are an historical anomaly. They arose during World War II, when wage and price controls made it difficult for businesses to compete for labor or retain valued workers. Offering health insurance as a benefit got around these controls, but created a lasting expectation that employment and health benefits were inextricably linked. Today, around 60% of employees receive health insurance through their employer. Recent escalation in the cost of health insurance, however, has put added pressure on employers providing these benefits. Faced with double-digit increases in premium costs, many employers are changing their benefits: requiring employees to pay a larger share of the cost, increasing co-pays and deductibles, or restricting coverage in general. Policies that fail to address the fundamentals behind the increases in the cost of health insurance will not make meaningful progress in expanding access to health insurance. This is an area where state legislative action can have a dramatic and positive impact. State policies that mandate the coverage of certain procedures have an enormous impact on the cost of health insurance. While any one mandate may seem inexpensive, the cumulative effect of 30 or 50 specific mandates can make insurance unaffordable. Research shows that across the states, the impact of these mandates can increase the cost of insurance by 20-50%. The other consequence of these state mandates is that today's health insurance marketplace is a patchwork quilt of coverage requirements. Policies have to be designed to meet the requirements of each individual state, lessening the ability to achieve savings through economies of scale. Worse, state mandates are continually being adapted. Each year, states consider hundreds of pieces of legislation that seek to change the minimum benefit package that can be offered in the state. This creates enormous uncertainty within the insurance market. Passing the Buck Reforming coverage mandates or increasing the availability of ``basic'' health plans that are exempt from certain mandates would go far in increasing the affordability of health insurance. Unfortunately, states are largely avoiding this discussion. Instead, they are addressing the increase in the lack of health coverage with the most blunt policy tool: simply requiring someone to pay for it. Nominally, these bills require employers to foot the bill for increased coverage. Economic research shows, however, that the burden of these mandates will actually fall on employees through decreased job opportunities and wages. While only one state has successfully implemented an employer- mandated health-care system, economists have used other mandate programs to estimate the economic impact of these policies. In total, the research reveals that-where possible-employers will pass the cost of mandated benefits onto employees through lower wages. For the lowest-skilled employees in the economy, however, this is not an option. Government data shows that about 43 percent of all uninsured employees are working at or near the minimum wage. Bound by this minimum wage, employers are forced to react to the increased costs of the mandate through decreased hours and positions. The end result is that the least-skilled employees of the economy end up footing the bill for these newly mandated benefits. Many of these employees are forced to confront the bitter irony that legislation designed to provide employer-based health-care leaves them with neither an employer nor healthcare. Estimated Effects of Mandated Health Insurance The recent history of employer mandated health-care can be traced back to California's defeated Proposition 72. This initiative would have required employers with more than 20 employees to provide individual health coverage to all employees working more than 100 hours a month. Employers with more than 200 employees would have to provide family insurance. The legislation would have cost California employers upwards of $12.9 billion and destroyed up to 150,000 jobs. While Proposition 72 was narrowly defeated at the ballot box in 2004, the defeat clearly did nothing to stem the tide of these costly mandates. In 2005, legislators in Washington debated the Health-care Responsibility Act which would have cost employers in that state upwards of $1.6 billion and destroyed up to 25,500 jobs. This year, 26 states considered legislation to require employers to provide health benefits to their employees. The legislation varied significantly across the states; many were limited to employers of a certain size, while others sought to additionally require a minimum level of benefit. These costs may be justifiable if these mandates significantly reduced the problem of the uninsured. But, research shows that employer mandates-due to their dependence on the workplace as the source of insurance-do little to address the problem of the uninsured. In California, for example, the $12.9 billion in new spending would have only decreased California's uninsured population by 31%--a shocking cost of nearly $6,600 per newly insurance individual. Due to poor targeting, only 30 to 35 cents of every dollar spent under the legislation would have gone towards covering the uninsured. Similar results should be expected from any mandate that attempts to address the problem of the uninsured, particularly the working uninsured, through the labor market. Often, the very characteristics that have left these employees without insurance in the first place deny them the benefits of these mandates. Employer mandates often exempt small businesses and require employees to work a certain number of hours. Recent research from the University of California-Santa Cruz found that employees working in small firms were the most likely to lose insurance from year to year. In addition, the rates of working uninsured clearly increase in smaller firms. These companies may very well want to provide insurance to their employees, but find it to costly. Employer mandates will do little to address that problem. Employer mandate legislation is based on a false premise of the labor market and a misunderstanding of the nature of today's uninsured population. It is not only ineffective at solving the problem, but it results in unintended consequences that are counter-productive. By attempting to simply require employer-provided care, rather than address the underlying problems plaguing the nation's healthcare market, state legislators are doing little to address the problem of the uninsured. Even without the mandate, attempting to rely on employers as the primary provider of health coverage is already leading to significant job losses for American. Economists at UCLA and Harvard University found that the rising healthcare rates have potentially forced millions of Americans out of the labor force. Even without the presence of a mandate, employers have reacted to rising costs by laying off employees; mandating coverage would only exacerbate this problem. Conclusion True progress towards addressing the pressing problem of rising health-care costs and the uninsured will not come from simply shifting the cost and responsibility onto the backs of employers. Rising health- care costs have made it prohibitively expensive for many small businesses to either offer or continue to offer coverage. These same higher rates have already contributed to significant job loss throughout the economy. It is critical that states, and Congress, attempt to enact meaningful reforms to our health-care market that will actually decrease the number of uninsured instead of trying to simply pass the buck to employers. ______ Chairman Johnson. Thank you, sir. I appreciate your testimony. How quick we forget World War II price controls. I bet there is not a single one of you that remembers it. Are there? Anybody in the audience remember World War II price and wage controls. Outstanding. I guess you and I are the only ones. Mr. Payne. I am trying not to admit it. Chairman Johnson. There is a guy that remembers it, I know that. Ms. Kofman, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF MILA KOFMAN, ASSOCIATE RESEARCH PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY HEALTH POLICY INSTITUTE Ms. Kofman. Thank you. Thank you very much. My name is Mila Kofman and I am an associate research professor at Georgetown University. Thank you for having me here today. It is both an honor and a privilege to have a chance to chat with you for 5 minutes. As you know, I have studied the insurance markets for over a decade, various health care reforms. I am currently co- chair--co-editor, excuse me, of the Journal of Insurance Regulation, and I am also a member of the Consumer Board of Trustees of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and before that, I was a Federal regulator working on ERISA-related issues at the Department of Labor. I want to thank you for your leadership in holding this hearing during Cover the Uninsured week. As the number of uninsured people continues to rise, the problem gets greater and greater, and as you have heard, 18,000 Americans die each year preventable deaths because they don't have any health coverage whatsoever. This problem may cost our economy as much as $130 billion dollars each year. It is timely to examine the interplay between ERISA and State health care reform initiatives. As States continue to find ways to address the health care crisis in the United States, ERISA continues to present a number of challenges to State-based reform, and today I will discuss just a few of those challenges. Importantly, despite ERISA challenges, Governors and State- Elected officials are undeterred and continue to develop new strategies and successful programs to finance medical care for their residents. Federal interventions you look at now and in the future should support all of these State-based initiatives and efforts. First, I would like to talk about why coverage is so expensive, then I want to talk about briefly some of these more recent State initiatives, as well as some of the older State- Based programs that seek to address the uninsured problem and then I want to make you aware of one ERISA related issue that prevents States from doing what they are supposed to in the criminal area, if there is time. So, first, health coverage is expensive because medical care is expensive. And you all know this, this is nothing new. We know the cost drivers behind health coverage is higher prices for prescription drugs, higher prices for provider costs. We also know that we use more health care. We are an aging population, and more of us have chronic conditions. Millions of Americans suffer from chronic conditions, and so we use more health care. So as we think about solutions to the uninsured problem and the ever-increasing costs, we need to address those factors, the cost drivers, as well as come up with a more fair way to finance the medical care, more equitable way to finance care. Many States have sought to address the Nation's health care crisis. State-based initiatives like fair-share health care seek a more fair way to finance medical care, and I believe will help employers in the long run. Cost shifting for uncompensated care costs of privately insured people are over $40 billion each year out of your pockets to pay for uncompensated care. It is estimated that each family pays more than $900 per year just to make up for uncompensated care. So State initiatives that seek to achieve cost savings like the one in Massachusetts, like the one in Maryland will help employers because there will be less cost shifting. Maryland's lawmakers as you know passed a fair-share law program in response to financial pressure on public programs. One large employer, their employees use public programs extensively, and so Maryland found a way to pay for that coverage. Similar things are happening in Massachusetts. State lawmakers are just trying to find a more fair way to finance medical care. Many States having enacted programs in the past decades that have worked to help people finance medical care and access company coverage. Things like high-risk pools and purchasing coalitions and reinsurance programs, those are all helping. None of them are free, and, in fact, they are very difficult to finance in the ERISA environment because self- funded employer plans don't pay into those programs, don't help finance those programs. So as you consider new initiatives at the Federal level, keep in mind that any ERISA expansion will financially hurt those existing State-based programs. And I see that the light is on, so I will stop and take any questions. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Kofman follows:] Prepared Statement of Mila Kofman, J.D., Associate Research Professor, Georgetown University Good morning. My name is Mila Kofman and I am an associate research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute (Institute). Thank you for inviting me to testify today. It is both an honor and a privilege to be here. As a way of background, researchers at the Institute conduct a range of studies on the uninsured problem. My specific focus is private health insurance. For the past decade I have studied regulation of health insurance products and companies, state and federal reform initiatives, and market failures like insolvency and fraud. Currently I am the co-editor of the Journal of Insurance Regulation and serve on the Consumer Board of Trustees of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Before joining the faculty at Georgetown University, I was a federal regulator at the U.S. Department of Labor, where I worked on issues affecting ERISA health plans. Prior to that, I was Counsel for Health Policy and Regulation at the Institute for Health Policy Solutions, a non-profit, non-partisan firm, assisting small businesses in establishing health insurance purchasing coalitions and studying state small group reforms. My knowledge, therefore, is both practical and academic. I want to thank you for your leadership in holding a hearing on state health reform initiatives and employer-sponsored medical benefits during ``Cover the Uninsured Week.'' As the number of uninsured continues to rise, now at over 45 million people without any health coverage, you and other members of Congress, as well as state policymakers are trying to address this problem. As you know, 18,000 Americans die preventable deaths each year because they are uninsured. This problem is estimated to cost our economy $60 to $130 billion annually.\\1\\ It is very timely to examine the interplay between ERISA and state health care reform initiatives. As states continue to find ways to address the health care crisis in the United States, ERISA continues to present a number of challenges to state-based reform. Today, I will discuss some of those challenges. As you deliberate about state health reform efforts by looking at ``fair share health care'' and ``pay or play'' proposals, it is important to remember that there are practical considerations and legal parameters, e.g., ERISA. One such consideration is the cost of medical care. Health coverage is expensive because medical care is expensive. The double-digit premium increases of the past five years, can be explained in part by certain cost drivers including increased prescription drug costs and higher provider costs (in part due to mergers).\\2\\ Utilization of services is also increasing--we are using more health care services as our population ages and the number of people with chronic conditions continues to grow. It is important to address the cost drivers of medical care. ERISA's limitations on what states can require of employers, lawsuits using ERISA to question state authority and challenge state reform initiatives, and other ERISA-related issues make it difficult for states to address the health care crisis. This makes it difficult to adopt successful reforms, to cover millions of Americans who do not have health insurance, to address the ever growing cost of health coverage for people who are insured, and to assure that in fact health insurance is adequate, accessible, and secure for people who are sick today and those of us who will become sick in the future. Despite ERISA challenges to state initiatives, however, governors and state legislators are undeterred and continue to develop new strategies and successful programs to finance medical care for their residents. Newest State Initiatives Background In recent years, many states have sought to address the nation's health care crisis. State-based initiatives like ``fair share health care'' seek a more equitable way to finance medical care and I believe will help employers. Cost-shifting (for uncompensated care) costs over $40 billion per year and hurts employers that provide comprehensive and generous benefits. The cost-savings from eliminating uncompensated care that state initiatives like ``fair share'' seek to accomplish will help those businesses. ERISA has been used to challenge state reforms. For example, the Maryland Legislature passed a law, called ``The Fair Share Health Care Fund Act'' that requires companies with more than 10,000 employees in Maryland to pay for medical care and coverage for their employees in the amount equal to or more than 8% of salaries (6% for non-profits). The law requires a company that falls below 8% to pay an assessment to help fund Maryland's health care programs for moderate and low-wage income earners and poor people and families.\\3\\ Maryland's lawmakers passed this law in response to financial pressure on public programs, after learning that Maryland's public programs covered many employees of at least one large national company, drawing down the programs' resources; similar bills have been introduced in 18 other states. Scheduled to go into effect in January 2007, Maryland's law was immediately challenged using ERISA.\\4\\ In April, Massachusetts lawmakers enacted broad health care reforms called the ``Health Care Access and Affordability'' (a.k.a. Massachusetts Health Care Reform Plan), which include a requirement that employers with more than 10 employees provide health coverage or pay an annual fee per employee to help finance medical care that their employees use (currently care provided for free to patients but financed through public funding and other sources) in the state.\\5\\ Although both laws were carefully crafted to avoid ERISA preemption and many experts (including me) believe that these laws would not be preempted, it is difficult to predict (even for ERISA experts) how a federal court may interpret the scope of ERISA.\\6\\ It remains to be seen whether Maryland, Massachusetts, and other states seeking to implement meaningful reforms to address the nation's health care problems will be precluded from achieving their goal of universal, affordable, and meaningful coverage for all residents. Background: ERISA In 1974 the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was passed to regulate job-based health and pension benefits. Under ERISA, state laws that ``relate to'' an ``employee benefit plan'' are generally preempted. Not all state laws have been found to ``relate to'' an ERISA plan, however. And ERISA explicitly exempts regulation of insurance from its broad preemption, thus allowing states to regulate health insurance products and companies that sell coverage to ERISA plans. Employers that self-insure (also called self-funding) are not subject to state insurance laws, however. Self-insurance means that an employer is responsible for paying medical claims of workers and their dependents. When an employer buys health insurance, it pays a premium to an insurance company; this is called ``fully-insured'' and the insurance company not the employer is obligated to pay medical bills. Insurance Reforms ERISA presents challenges to meaningful state health reforms. As a way of example, take state benefit mandates. These are requirements for health insurance policies to cover certain benefits, like specific medical conditions and treatments. States have a wide range of such standards. For example, in 46 states health insurers are required to either cover (or offer to cover) benefits for diabetes supplies and education. Twenty-seven states require insurers to cover cervical cancer screening. Fifty states require coverage for mammograms and 32 require coverage for well-baby care (childhood immunizations and visits to pediatricians). Mandated benefits also include requirements that insurers reimburse certain types of medical providers, such as nurse practitioners. And they include state laws requiring coverage for special populations, e.g., adult handicapped children who age-off their parent's policy and newborns (required to be covered from birth by their parent's insurer).\\7\\ Benefit mandates are used to spread the cost of a medical condition or treatment among a broad population, making it less expensive for the group of people who need such coverage. Policymakers also use benefit mandates to encourage people to seek certain care (immunizations and preventive services) that otherwise may not be obtained if people have to pay for it out-of-pocket.\\8\\ In the absence of mandates, adding optional benefits to a policy can distort the price if only people who need that benefit select coverage. For example, in Washington State premiums for policies that covered maternity and mental health benefits were anywhere from 30 to 100 percent more expensive than policies that excluded those two benefits. The choice in benefit design led consumers to select those specific benefits based on their expectation of using them, with adverse selection fueling a steep increase in premiums for those products.\\9\\ Also, absent a requirement, some services and benefits may not be available even as an add-on (or ``rider''). For example, in states that do not require maternity to be covered, an individual policy with a maternity rider is rarely available; and even when available, the price for a maternity rider is higher than paying for the average pregnancy out-of-pocket. With respect to mandated benefits, state policymakers make tradeoffs: balancing the cost (added to the premium) with the need to help their constituents finance costly illnesses. Here, the impact of ERISA is felt. Self-funded ERISA health plans are not subject to benefit requirements and thus can avoid helping to finance the cost of such coverage. This, however, frustrates the public policy goal of broadly spreading the cost of certain medical conditions and achieving public health goals (such as immunizing the population against certain diseases, stabilizing mental health conditions, encouraging treatment for substance abuse, or financing supplies to control diabetes). It is important to note that many self-funded large employer plans are comprehensive, covering for example diabetes supplies. Absent federal mandates, not all self-funded plans provide such coverage. When employers choose to self-fund, because the cost of mandates is spread across a smaller population (among those in state-regulated products), the price is higher than it otherwise would be had the cost been spread over the entire population (self-funded and fully-insured plans). How mandated benefits add to the cost of health insurance has been an issue of longstanding controversy and depends on the extent to which mandates spread the cost of a particular health care service over a large number of policyholders. Literature on the cost of mandates generally does not consider the true cost of the benefit because many benefits would have been covered absent the mandate.\\10\\ Even so, a recent industry study, for example, found that mandates add minimally to the cost of premium (an estimated 5 percent).\\11\\ Given the recent double-digit premium increases for employers (for some in the range of 20%-30% annually), the anticipated cost savings from a mandate-free environment would be minimal. Importantly, both employers exempt from state mandates (self-insured) and fully insured have seen their premiums increase. There is a reason why GM, for example, adds $1500 to the price of each car to pay for health coverage for workers and retirees. It is because the cost of medical care is expensive and thus reflected in the price of coverage; it is not because of mandates. So eliminating mandates will not address the rising costs of coverage. Also, the studies on the cost of mandates generally do not consider the cost to the patient. In other words, if a health plan is excused from covering a treatment, then it does not mean that your illness disappears. It just means that you pay for it out-of-pocket, if you can afford it. And if not, then assuming you still receive the care, the cost of your treatment is added to the cost of uncompensated care (generally paid with public funds and cost-shifting to privately insured patients).\\12\\ The question here is who pays for your illness: your health plan because it is required by a mandate, you pay out-of- pocket if you can afford it, or other people with comprehensive coverage pay for it (through cost-shifting). Additionally, studies on the cost of mandates generally do not consider system-wide costs, that is affordability issues and the increased costs of delayed or foregone medical care when patients cannot afford needed medical services.\\13\\ State Regulated Health Insurance Products: ERISA 's impact ERISA influences prices for regulated health insurance products. Self-insuring allows employers to avoid having their medical claims pooled with other employers; especially for mid-size (500 employees or less) and small businesses that employ a relatively healthy workforce, this may be an advantage.\\14\\ Smaller firms that employ workers with higher medical needs are less likely to self-insure and are more likely to buy state-regulated products. Since guaranteed-issue laws were enacted, requiring insurers to sell products to any small business, it has in fact become easier to buy insurance. In the past insurers were free to sell insurance only to businesses with healthy workers. In addition, state small group rate reforms require insurers to pool risk and in some states insurers are prohibited (or restricted) from charging higher rates to businesses with sicker workers. Through risk pooling requirements, firms with sicker workers pay less than they otherwise would, which helps them to offer and maintain coverage. If employers with self-funded plans (small and mid-size) in fact have more favorable risk than other employers, the cost for state regulated products may be lowered if all businesses participated and everyone's claims experience was pooled.\\15\\ State Market Reforms and Programs: Background and ERISA Challenges State insurance regulation has sought to promote several policy objectives, such as assuring the financial solvency of insurance companies, promoting risk spreading, protecting consumers against fraud, and ensuring that consumers are paid the benefits that they are promised. Also as products and markets evolve, e.g., managed care in the 1990's, states have responded to some abusive industry practices through ``patient protections'' like guaranteed access to emergency services and specialists, and external review of denied claims for medical care. State policy makers have also instituted certain rules for insurance companies, establishing who they must sell coverage to, how products must be priced, and the types of benefits that must be covered. Absent legislative interventions, in a private health insurance market, insurers adopt practices to avoid incurring high medical claims, including denying coverage to applicants who have health conditions or a history of health problems. An estimated 20% of people account for about 80% of health care spending.\\16\\ Avoiding even a small number of high-cost individuals can substantially reduce an insurer's losses. In addition to market reforms, state policymakers have tried a variety of ways to help their residents and businesses to access and afford health coverage. ERISA presents a number of challenges to states in how to finance certain health coverage programs. For instance, states require insurers to pay premium taxes and assessments, which helps to pay for certain state health programs for residents including high-risk pools. Risk pools are state programs for people with high medical needs who insurance companies won't cover. Thirty-three states have such pools. In 2004, they covered approximately 180,000 people. States fund high-risk pools in a variety of ways, but many rely on revenue from premium taxes and assessments on health insurance companies. For self-insured plans, an exemption from premium taxes is a small cost savings, but it cuts the amount of available revenue from health insurance companies by approximately 50%--the estimated portion of the insured population that is in self-funded plans.\\17\\ Another approach to expand access to health insurance has been through public/private partnerships called ``HIPCs'' (health insurance purchasing cooperatives)--these are also known as purchasing alliances and purchasing pools for small businesses. These programs use the state's purchasing power to negotiate rates and coverage with private insurance companies.\\18\\ Participating employers have a choice of products and typically a choice of insurers. Arizona, California, New Mexico, and New York City have such purchasing pools for small businesses.\\19\\ One of the newest operational programs was established in 2005 in Montana. The state has used its purchasing power to negotiate rates that are better than available in the private market and is using tobacco taxes to help pay for the cost of coverage in the pool for moderate income wage earners. Other states have tried to make coverage more affordable through ``reinsurance,'' subsidizing the cost of big losses (claims). This would limit insurers' losses and thus seeks to keep premiums lower. Reinsurance programs have been tried in 21 states. Healthy New York, a state-wide program, for example, covers over 100,000 people and uses the state's tobacco settlement funds to subsidize a portion of high- cost claims under the program.\\20\\ While these state coverage expansion efforts vary, none are free. They all rely on some funding, and ERISA self-insured plans generally do not contribute to financing such programs. However, self-funded plans benefit when people with medical needs have insurance--there is less uncompensated care and therefore less cost-shifting. In other words, the cost of uncompensated care is borne by all people with insurance as the costs are shifted to all privately insured people-- self-insured and fully insured plans. In addition to funding, these state programs rely on insurers assuming significant risk. As policymakers provide new incentives for employers to withdraw from state-regulated policies (as some bills pending before Congress would do), insurers would have greater incentive to dump their poor risks.\\21\\ States may allow insurers to do so but pressure on state coverage expansion programs will be great. Expansion of ERISA is likely to escalate this pressure and impact adversely state coverage programs that rely on insurers taking on significant risk and on insurer assessments to spread cost broadly across the insured population. ERISA Abuses Operators of unauthorized entities (a.k.a. phony insurance companies) have used ERISA as a way to avoid or to delay state regulator actions. By way of background, phony insurance entities collect premiums but don't pay medical bills, instead using the money for personal gain. During the most recent cycle of health insurance scams, more than 200,000 policyholders were left with over $252 million in unpaid medical bills. The federal government and the states identified 144 scams between 2001 and 2003; the federal government shut down 3 and the states shut down 41.\\22\\ Operators of health insurance scams claim that they are regulated by the federal government under ERISA and therefore exempt from state regulation. Some create complex legal documents that, at least on paper, raise questions about their legal status under ERISA. Although Congress clarified ERISA in 1983, some ambiguities remain and operators of phony health plans continue to use ERISA preemption as a shield to avoid state enforcement actions, challenging state authority by removing cases to federal court. Operators of phony plans use this tactic to delay final court action, which gives them an opportunity to spend or hide assets. This use of ERISA makes it difficult for states to protect their residents against criminal behavior.\\23\\ Expanding ERISA, for example through AHPs or similar legislation, is likely to increase ERISA-related scams.\\24\\ Conclusion As the number of people in the United States without health insurance continues to rise, governors and state legislators continue to look for ways to address the problem, financing medical care through private and public insurance despite ERISA challenges. States are looking for equitable and effective ways to finance medical care for their residents. For this reason, Congress should be cautious when looking at proposals that seek to expand ERISA or to deregulate the market. Not only will some proposals not accomplish their desired goal, but they may actually add to the uninsured problem, make it even more difficult for state-based reforms to succeed and drive-up costs for people who have insurance. I encourage you to look for measures that will encourage and support state initiatives. It is also important to remember that many self-funded large employer plans provide generous benefits to workers and dependents, covering expensive medical conditions and covering people with significant medical needs. America's businesses need real help to address factors driving cost increases for medical care so they can keep their workers healthy and stay competitive in a global economy. Thank you for your consideration of this important issue, and I look forward to assisting you as you look for ways to address the ever growing problem of millions of Americans without health insurance and rising costs of coverage for all Americans.

Additionally, self-insurance allows employers to save money by avoiding the cost of paying for reserves and minimum capital. Such requirements apply to insurers and are designed to ensure solvency. There are no solvency requirements for health plans in ERISA. While saving some cost, the trade-off here is that people in ERISA self-insured plans have fewer protections than those in fully-insured plans, and as such may be stuck with medical bills if their employer goes bankrupt. When an insurer becomes insolvent, outstanding medical claims are paid for by guaranty funds. There is no similar safety-net for people in self-insured arrangements. A problem for state policy makers is that ERISA self-funded plans do not contribute to state programs like guaranty funds, which are financed through assessments on health insurance companies. A broader financing base would make these safety-nets less costly; and of course, protect all workers against their health plan's insolvency. \\16\\ See Berk, Marc and Alan Monheit, ``The Concentration of Health Care Expenditures, Revisited,'' Health Afairs, (March/April 2001): 145- 149. \\17\\ Financing risk pools is also a question of fairness. Arguably because former workers of ERISA self-funded plans may enroll in high- risk pools, it is fair to ask self-funded employers to help finance that coverage.

Among its many features, is it helps pay for the cost of private health insurance for moderate income wage earners insured through the program. The coverage is through a private insurer. Funding for the program partly comes through Medicaid. \\19\\ Kofman, Mila, Issue Brief: Group Purchasing Arrangements: Issues for States, State Coverage Initiatives, April 2003 available at http://www.statecoverage.net/pdf/issuebrief403.pdf. \\20\\ Chollet, Deborah, The Role of Reinsurance in State Eforts to Expand Coverage, State Coverage Initiatives, October 2004; see also, Chollet, Deborah and Carolyn Watts, Pooling and Reinsurance in Washington State Insurance Markets, 24 Journal of Insurance Regulation 81 (Winter 2005); Swartz, Katherine, ``Reinsurance: How States Can Make Health Coverage More Affordable For Employers and Workers,'' Commonwealth Fund, July 2005. \\21\\ For example, prior to guaranteed-issue requirements in the small group market, states allowed commercial insurers to choose to whom to sell coverage. In many states, Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans were looked to as insurers of ``last resort'' and generally offered coverage on a guaranteed issue basis. With a changing marketplace in the 1980s, as more large employers began to take themselves out of the insurance market (and self-funding their medical benefits), the market became more fragmented. Commercial carriers became more selective in who they would cover. Financial pressure on many Blues plans as insurers of last resort became significant. Taxpayer subsidies and whole scale market reforms became necessary requiring commercial insurers to bear more risk for sick groups.

Unlike the outright scams these schemes straddle the line between regulatory violations and criminal conduct. \\24\\ In the case of American Benefit Plans, although the Texas Insurance Department had a letter from the U.S. Department of Labor stating that the arrangement was subject to state regulation, one of its promoters, nonetheless, removed the state case to a federal court.

Thank you very much. I am sure we will have an opportunity for increased dialog when we get to the question-and-answer session. You have the floor, sir. STATEMENT OF LARRY DROMBETTA, PRESIDENT AND CEO, H.R. STORES, INC. Mr. Drombetta. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Larry Drombetta, and I am the president and CEO of a small Maryland based company, H.R. Stores, Incorporated. I am pleased to be here today on behalf of the national retail federation. I commend you for holding these timely meetings focusing attention on health care mandates as they impact employees, employers and particularly on small retail businesses like my own. The NRF is a large retail trade association, membership that comprises all retail format and channels of distribution. The NRF also represents more than a hundred State, local and national and international retail associations. Mr. Chairman, as the employer of more than 23 million employees, about 1 in every 5 Americans, the retail industry is one of the biggest supporters of employer-based health insurance. We also are mainstays of the economy with 2005 sales of $4.4 trillion. Ours is not an easy employee population to cover with health insurance. Our employees are fairly young; they have high turnover rates. We employ half of all the teenagers in the workforce, and one-third of all workers under the age of 24 years old. More than a third of our retail workforce is part-time, and two-thirds of that part-time workforce are women. Often retail industry employees are second-wage earners and mainstays of family economies. I am the president and CEO of a very small company. We operate shoe stores in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and soon in Pennsylvania. We have a staff of 35; 33 are full time, and 18 participate in the company health insurance program. My health care costs have steadily increased through the years and are increasingly unbearable. Coverage costs have increased by 155 percent in the period 2000 through 2006. My company has not grown 155 percent, and we cannot continue to sustain these coverage cost increases. The cost increases are directly related to the impact of not just my business and company but the people who work for me and I work with. Let me explain how that relates. The younger members of my staff drop insurance out of a belief that they really don't need it. Some of us can recall how invincible we felt when we were young. This leaves in turn my group aging, having an increasing average age that in turn drives up the rate. This process repeats itself each year as my group becomes older and older. My health insurance program is in what insurance industry people call a health insurance death spiral. I appreciate the Chairman's leadership in sponsoring legislation for association health plans. I am hopeful the Senate will soon develop a bipartisan counterpart bill and catch up with the House. We as retailers offer good benefits but do not support mandated provisions of benefits, particularly the entire--the current cost environment and given the unique workforce mix we contain, State health mandates do nothing to address the cost of health care. In fact, they make matters worse. Legislation mandating that employers spend arbitrary percentages on benefits tends to--excuse me, a little nervous. I believe that health care mandates amount to an ill- advised tax. It will result in a tax on workers, a tax on consumers and a tax on the economy in general. The National Retail Federation has established a Tax on Jobs Coalition to fight State health care mandates. With the Chairman's permission, I would like to insert the coalition matrix of spending State health care mandates at the conclusion of my testimony.

Without objection, that will be inserted and all your written testimony will be inserted. Mr. Drombetta. The special interest groups that are at the State level make no secret of the ambition to move to expand mandates to cover employers of all sizes. Let me be specific with two examples. In the aftermath of the Maryland veto override, legislation, House Bill 1510, was introduced by the original law sponsors that would apply the same Maryland payroll tax to all businesses in the State with fewer than 10,000 employees. These employees would be required to spend at least 4.5 percent of their payroll on health expense. To the committee, I would tell you my raw dollars spent in support of health care exceed that. And if my costs had gone up from 2000 through 2006, which you heard me mention, I don't know how mandating a percentage changes that. In New York, legislation is currently being considered that would mandate all employers in the State with more than 100 employees spending at least $3 per hour on employee hours worked to pay for health cost. No distinction is made between part-time and seasonal employees. Obviously, the legislation would do nothing to address the fact in the State of New York the health care costs are the highest in the Nation. I see my time has expired, and I haven't done a good job of delivering my entire text but you certainly have it, and I would welcome any questions the committee may have. [The prepared statement of Mr. Drombetta follows:] Prepared Statement of Larry Drombetta, President and CEO, HR Stores, Inc., on Behalf of the National Retail Federation Mr. Chairman and honored members of the committee, my name Larry Drombetta and I am the President and CEO of HR Stores, Inc. I am pleased to appear today on behalf of the National Retail Federation (NRF). On behalf of my fellow NRF retailers, I commend you for holding this hearing to focus attention on the effect of health care mandates on employees and employers, particularly on smaller retail businesses like my own. The NRF is the world's largest retail trade association, with membership that comprises all retail formats and channels of distribution including department, specialty, discount, catalog, Internet, independent stores, chain restaurants, drug and grocery stores as well as the industry's key trading partners of retail goods and services. The NRF represents an industry with more than 1.4 million U.S. retail establishments and 2005 sales of $4.4 trillion. As the industry umbrella group, NRF also represents more than 100 state, national and international retail associations. www.nrf.com. As the employer of more than 23 million employees (about one of every five Americans), the retail industry is one of the biggest supporters of the employer-based health insurance system. We are also mainstays of the economy. Our 1.6 million retail and restaurant establishments had sales of $4.4 trillion in 2005, or 8.6% of our nation's Gross Domestic Product. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, our industry will add some 1.65 million new jobs over the next decade: an increase of 11%. We added 500,000 new jobs in 2005 alone. Ours is not an easy workforce population to cover with health insurance. We have a fairly young workforce (though with a significant senior cohort) with a high turnover rate. We employ half of all teenagers in the workforce and a third of all workers under 24 years old. More than a third (35%) of this workforce is part-time. Two-thirds of our part-time employees are women. Often retail industry employees are second wage earners, mainstays of family economies. Some qualified retail workers opt-out of the coverage we offer because they already have alternative coverage through a family member or another job. HR Stores, Inc. Let me tell you a little about my own company. I am the President and CEO of a small company that operates 12 shoe stores in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. We have a staff of 35 of which 33 are full time and 18 participate in the company health insurance program. My health care costs have steadily increased through the years and are increasingly unbearable. Coverage costs have increased by 155% from 2000-2006, a level my business cannot sustain with related growth. My company has not grown 155% in this same period and cannot continue to sustain these cost increases. These cost increases directly impact my staff. This results in younger members of the staff dropping out in the belief that they are not likely to need the coverage at this price. This in turn results in the group having an increase in the average age, driving up the rates yet again. This process repeats itself year after year with the group becoming older and more costly to cover each year. My health insurance program is in what insurance industry people call a ``health insurance death spiral.'' Under current law, there is nothing that I can do. The end result will be no more insurance for my employees. A Federal Solution Needed I believe that what is needed is a federal solution that allows a small business the same access to large group insurance rates that is now available to larger companies and unions. The mechanics needed to do so must be provided at a federal level and soon to avoid more small businesses like mine reaching the end of company provided/supported health insurance coverage. We appreciate the work this committee has done to this end and especially appreciate the leadership of Chairman Johnson in sponsoring legislation for Association Health Plans (AHPs). I am hopeful that the Senate will vote soon on the bipartisan counterpart bill introduced by Sens. Enzi and Nelson. Perhaps then the Senate will at last catch up to the House in supporting health insurance relief to small businesses like my own. I realize that there are many complexities involved in the cost of health coverage and that my request only impacts a small part of the solutions that we need nationally. The National Retail Federation stands ready to work with you and your colleagues from both parties to find these solutions. I do hope that, on the way to seeking these solutions, we don't overlook the more immediate needs of companies like mine--small businesses caught in the health insurance death spiral. I also urge you and your colleagues to avoid adding additional costs to my health insurance burden. I refer here to the health insurance mandates and mandates to provide coverage that are the focus of today's hearing. Health Insurance Mandates Exacerbate Cost Pressures Retailers provide their workers with good benefits that accommodate the unique dynamics of the retail workforce. As I noted previously, our workforce is dominated by young people, non-heads of household, retirees and part-time and seasonal employees, many of whom have coverage through sources other than their retail employer. We offer coverage to help attract workers and to maintain a productive workforce. Nevertheless, we are greatly concerned by the mandated expansion of these benefits, particularly in the current cost environment and given our unique workforce challenges. State Health Care Mandates: Anti-Job, Anti-Business and Anti-Consumer State health care mandates do nothing to address the real health care challenge: rising health care costs and reduced accessibility. In fact, they make matters worse. Legislation mandating that employers spend arbitrary percentages of their payroll on health care does not solve cost pressures but instead will jeopardize current employment levels, stunt future job growth and raise consumer prices. We believe state health care mandates amount to an ill-advised tax on jobs. This is also a tax on workers, a tax on consumers and a tax on the economy. We believe that we are already taxed quite enough, thank you. Through my trade association, the National Retail Federation, my fellow retailers and I have established the Tax on Jobs Coalition to fight these state health care mandates. Anti-Retail Industry Many of these proposed state mandates have unfairly singled out the retail industry. Imposing an arbitrary payroll tax on an industry with already slim profit margins (averaging between two and three percent) will force retailers to make a choice between laying off workers and raising prices. Too often there is no choice but to look to both options. States that pass mandated health care legislation should not be surprised to see job losses, higher "
