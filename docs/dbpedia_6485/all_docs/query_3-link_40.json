        "text": "Bio\n\nChad Magendanz (pronounced like HÃ¤agen-Dazs) served two terms as state representative for the 5th Legislative District, which comprised the eastern third of King County. He was elected to caucus leadership his first year and served as ranking Republican on the House Education Committee and as a member of House Higher Education, Technology and Economic Development, Appropriations and Rules committees. Previously, he served as the Issaquah School Board president and in leading roles of other regional and statewide education-related committees and boards. After almost unseating the incumbent state senator in 2016 with 49.7% of the vote, heâs running again now that Mark Mullet is vacating the seat to run for governor.\n\nChad has a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell and a Master of Arts in Teaching from Central Washington University. He served in the U.S. Navy for 12 years as a nuclear submarine officer and then developed software at Microsoft for over 20 years. He joined Voter Science in 2017 as its Director of Product Development and has also been teaching computer science full-time in the Bellevue School District since 2019. He and his wife of 35 years reside on Tiger Mountain and have two boys who recently graduated with CS degrees from MIT and the University of Utah.\n\nFor two terms he represented the 5th Legislative District as Ranking Minority Member on the House Education Committee as a lead negotiator for the McCleary remedy, which resulted in the state increasing its K-12 funding over 8 years by 105% while also easing the tax burden on 44% of districts by reducing net school levy rates. He was also prime sponsor of the charter school funding fix in the House, which along with our McCleary remedy was ratified by the Supreme Court in 2018."
