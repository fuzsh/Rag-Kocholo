The class voted on the entries. The winner was our classmate, Tim Gulliver; however, Linda (Garcia) Cubero came-up with the modified motto that was used. Most of what you see are the mandatory elements: class year, falcon, chapel, Polaris star, saber, etc. The crest includes the space shuttle and part of the class motto. The space shuttle is applicable because it was on the horizon for the decade we had just entered. The entire class motto is Strive not to Equal, but to Excel. Although the class joke was to shorten the somewhat long motto to Strive Not; you will note the crest , from Linda's input, has the words, Strive to Excel.\n\nTHE SPACE SHUTTLE - Represents a transition from one environment to another. As the Shuttle makes thetransition from Earth to space, we are making a transition from cadet to officer life.\n\nTHE CADET CHAPEL - Represents the high moral standards and strong sense of ethical leadership that we willtake with us when we leave the Academy.\n\nTHE MOUNTAINS - Represent the goal that the class sought to achieve by the end of the fourth class year.\n\nContributions of Graduates:"
