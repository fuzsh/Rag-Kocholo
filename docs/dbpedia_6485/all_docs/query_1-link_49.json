        "text": "Forward-looking approach aims to head off problems before they occur\n\nOngoing problems at the scandal-plagued state Department of Corrections are prompting a trio of Senate Republicans to introduce a package of sweeping reforms to address what they call a costly and fatal record of mismanagement.\n\nSen. Mike Padden, R-Spokane Valley, said recent inmate deaths due to inadequate medical care demonstrate the agency’s problems are far from being solved. Padden led a comprehensive Senate investigation into management failures at the agency four years ago.\n\nPadden said, “Corrections keeps saying, ‘trust us,’ and look what happens. It has gotten to the point that our Democratic colleagues are expressing interest in reform as well. The package we have introduced is the kind of comprehensive reform I think both parties can support. We shouldn’t just react to problems – we should keep them from occurring in the first place. We have seen the governor’s watered-down, no-accountability approach already, and it hasn’t done the job.”\n\nThe Department of Corrections suspended the medical director at the state prison in Monroe last year following an investigation that uncovered a pattern of inadequate care that may have contributed to at least three inmate deaths. A scathing report released last month about one inmate death indicates prison officials ignored his cancer diagnosis for 15 months and failed to provide treatment.\n\nSenate Republicans are introducing four measures this year to address systemic management problems, encourage greater accountability, improve safety for inmates and corrections workers and support whistleblowers who identify problems at the agency.\n\nPadden and Sen. Steve O’Ban, R-University Place, introduced their bills this week, joining Sen. Keith Wagoner of Sedro-Woolley, who filed two measures prior to Monday’s start of the 2020 legislative session.\n\nSystemic DOC Reform\n\nSenate Bill 6298, sponsored by Padden, would\n\nexplicitly establish that DOC’s central duty is the protection of public safety;\n\nrequire performance audits of the agency’s information-technology and medical units;\n\nmandate that DOC put a higher priority on re-imprisoning felons who have violated community-supervision requirements; and,\n\npermit sentencing reviews when sentencing calculations are performed incorrectly.\n\n“These reforms are way overdue,” Padden said. “We offered some of them in a comprehensive reform bill in 2017. Unfortunately, the governor’s office took offense, and the bill was blocked in the House. At this point I think all of us have to recognize something is haywire. I hope these recent deaths will help change the governor’s mind.”\n\nIn 2016, the Senate Law and Justice Committee, then chaired by Padden, conducted an exhaustive investigation of Corrections’ early release of some 3,000 prisoners convicted of violent and dangerous crimes. Those early inmate releases spanned a 13-year period, and they continued three years after DOC employees learned of the problem and attempted to flag it to the attention of their supervisors. At least two deaths and numerous other crimes were linked to inmates who should have been behind bars at the time.\n\nProtecting Inmates and Corrections Officers\n\nWagoner’s SB 6063 directly tackles management problems in the agency’s medical unit. The bill would establish minimum qualifications for a prison medical director, set criteria for transferring a patient to a health care facility for medical assistance and standardize policies and procedures for offsite medical treatment.\n\n“I represent all the people at Monroe – the inmates we are entrusted to care for during their incarceration, as well as the corrections officers who deserve a work environment that is as safe as possible,” Wagoner said.\n\n“While accountability for this and other recent failures will undoubtedly be the highest concern for victims’ families, we also need to look forward and address the serious safety concerns for all involved. We also have a duty to ensure we provide medical care to inmates under the state’s watch.”\n\nWagoner’s other measure, SB 6064, would require DOC to install body scanner devices in prisons by July 1, 2024. Wagoner said he was inspired by a body-scanner pilot program that intercepted as much contraband in two months as in an entire year of pat-downs, strip searches and other traditional methods.\n\nIncreasing Accountability\n\nO’Ban’s proposal, Senate Bill 6322, addresses failures of leadership and accountability within the agency’s upper management. The measure would give greater authority to the ombuds office created in the wake of the early-release scandal. The office, created with the governor’s support, was crippled by management structure and restrictions that prevented investigation into concerns raised by DOC staff, O’Ban said. The bill would remove the ombuds office from the governor’s office and allow it to operate independently, and would direct the state to staff it with an outside provider. Retaliatory measures against whistleblowers would be prohibited, including settlement agreements with whistleblowers that bar them from future employment with the state.\n\nO’Ban said DOC’s front-line employees are among the most knowledgeable about management problems. During the Senate’s DOC investigation, many alerted lawmakers to agency waste, fraud, mismanagement and abuse.\n\n“Recent disclosures of problems with DOC’s medical programs offer conclusive evidence the agency still hasn’t cleaned up its act,” O’Ban said. “Where there are problems, we want to know about them.”\n\nO’Ban voiced optimism that the time is right for bipartisan action on the package of DOC reforms but noted that the Democrats who control both chambers of the Legislature may not yet be ready to hold a Democratic administration accountable.\n\n“We have been fighting for vital reforms and accountability at DOC for nearly five years,” O’Ban said. “The package Republicans have introduced is the kind of comprehensive reform I hope Democrats will finally support.”\n\nToday Sen. Mike Padden’s anti-discrimination legislation to protect people with developmental disabilities who are seeking organ transplants was signed into law.\n\nSubstitute Senate Bill 5405 cleared the Legislature on April 24 with unanimous support.\n\n“I am pleased that Washington has spoken clearly, with one voice, that all lives have value,” said Padden, R-Spokane Valley. “No transplant should be denied on the grounds of disability alone, and all those involved in making life-and-death decisions about eligibility should be clear about where the law stands on this important issue of justice and fairness.”\n\nUnder the new law mental or physical disability can no longer be used as the sole reason to deny transplant eligibility, surgery, medical care, or insurance coverage related to a transplant. Disability also cannot be used as the sole reason for moving a transplant candidate to a lower-priority position on a waiting list. Also, a person’s inability to comply with post-transplant medical requirements can’t be used as a reason for denial, if he or she has support from others who can provide assistance. Discrimination against those with disabilities is already prohibited under federal law.\n\nAshley Helsing of the National Down Syndrome Society applauded the signing of Padden’s legislation.\n\n“Senator Padden was wonderful to work with on this bill; he was very passionate about this issue,” said Helsing, who was instrumental in the bill’s passage, testifying on its importance before a Senate committee hearing.\n\n“I am happy that Washington will be the ninth state to put this law on the books, and we’ll be working to get it done in others as well.”\n\nEric Matthes with the ARC of King County also attended today’s bill signing.\n\n“This bill is important because people who are on the list for the longest period of time, and then finally come up, could then hear from the doctor that they aren’t going to take you because you have a disability,” said Matthes, who himself has Down syndrome. “It could be me. It could be anyone with Down syndrome or a different kind of disability. This aspect of saving someone’s life is really important.”\n\nPadden pointed out that his new legislation alone won’t solve the problem, and that education and enforcement will be key to ending discrimination practices. He cited a recent high-profile California case in which a disabled man was denied a kidney transplant because he has Down syndrome, despite California already being one of the states that have laws similar to Padden’s new legislation.\n\nHelsing agreed, pointing to a Stanford study showing 85 percent of pediatric transplant centers consider intellectual or developmental disabilities when determining eligibility for transplants. Some 71 percent of heart programs also consider disabilities as a factor.\n\n“We all have a responsibility to work towards a culture that has respect for all life, and views the value of all lives equally,” said Padden. “This new law is an important step in that march towards justice.” The law created by Padden’s bill will go into effect July 28."
