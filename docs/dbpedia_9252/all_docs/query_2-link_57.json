        "text": "AJ Michalka is an American actor, singer-songwriter, musician, and former model, best known as one half of the musician duo ‘Aly and AJ.’ She performs along with her sister, Aly Michalka. Born in Torrance, California, AJ was inspired by her mother, Carrie, who herself was a musician. AJ spent most of her childhood years in Torrance, Seattle, and Milwaukee. The sisters grew up playing the guitar and the piano at an early age. By the time they stepped into teenhood, they were well-versed in their domain. AJ began acting when she was 5 years old and played roles in theatrical productions held at churches. AJ was also active in her school’s musical productions. AJ made her acting debut in 2002, as an 11-year-old child with a small role in the series ‘Passions.’ Over time, she appeared in key roles in series such as ‘The Guardian,’ ‘Oliver Beene,’ and ‘All My Friends are Getting Married.’ She is perhaps best known for appearing in a recurring/regular role in the sitcom ‘The Goldbergs.’ She has appeared in films such as ‘Secretariat’ and ‘Angels in Stardust.’ Forming a musical duo with her older sister, Aly, she released her debut album, ‘Into the Rush,’ in 2005 and has since released two more albums."
