        "text": "UTA has signed California-based musicians and sisters Aly and AJ for worldwide representation in all areas.\n\nIn 2004, Aly and AJ Michalka launched their music careers after making key appearances on the Disney Channel as teens. After the release of their gold-certified debut album “Into the Rush” (Hollywood Records) in 2005, Aly & AJ’s mainstream breakthrough came with the platinum success of “Potential Breakup Song” from their 2007 album, “Insomniatic,” which peaked at No. 17 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song remained popular throughout the years and found a new life on social media apps like TikTok. In 2020, in tandem with the song’s growing online attention, the sisters decided to release a new version with explicit lyrics.\n\nThen, Aly & AJ delivered a string of anthemic studio albums, including “A Touch of the Beat Gets You Up on Your Feet Gets You Out and Then Into the Sun” in 2021,and their most recent album, “With Love From,” in 2023.\n\nAJ starred on the hit ABC series “The Goldbergs,” which ran for 10 seasons, as well as its spinoff “Schooled” which revolved around her character as the lead. Both Aly and AJ have had several other acting appearances in shows as diverse as “Birds of Prey,” “Oliver Beene,” “Six Feet Under,” “Phil of the Future,” “The Good Doctor,” and more, along with starring in the Disney Channel Original movie, “Cow Bells.” They have also worked with filmmakers such as Will Gluck, JJ Abrams, and Peter Jackson to name a few.\n\nThis signing comes after the duo’s performances at the Greek in Los Angeles, Hammerstein Ballroom in New York, and the Ryman in Nashville. Additionally, they have played festivals Lollapalooza, Governors Ball, BottleRock, ACL and Hyde Park.\n\nAly & AJ will continue to be represented by Scott Felcher at Felcher & Freifeld, LLP, Joel McKuin at McKuin Frankel Whitehead LLP, Jared Rosenberg at Redlight Management and Andrea Pett-Joseph at Brillstein Entertainment."
