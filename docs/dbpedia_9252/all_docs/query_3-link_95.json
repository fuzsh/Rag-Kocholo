        "text": "In the race for most creative and longest album title of 2021, sister duo Aly and AJ Michalka are off to an early lead with their first album in 14 years. The name? A Touch Of The Beat Gets You Up On Your Feet Gets You Out And Then Into The Sun.\n\nThe lengthy album title is significant on multiple levels. Besides the fact they say it is the perfect title, especially given the release this week (May 7), as things start to open up a bit from the COVID lockdown of a year plus and there is a sense of optimism, the length and creativity of the title make a powerful statement.\n\nNow 14 years older than when they made their last album, 2007's Insomniac, the older, more accomplished and more confident sisters aren't making music for radio, to sound cool or for anything else. They are making the music they want to make.\n\nThe result is a captivating and confident collection, one that melds Americana with Beach Boys jangle and pop and occasional twang, which they will debut live on release night, this Friday, May 7, with a virtual performance from the Ace Hotel in Los Angeles.\n\nI spoke with the sisters at length about the making of the new record, how the mystique of Laurel Canyon influenced the songs and the recent live shows that have excited them.\n\nSteve Baltin: Where is home base these days?\n\nAJ Michalka: We are in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. We grew up in the Valley and then ended up both in the canyons, just across the way from each other. So we're super close.\n\nBaltin: Laurel Canyon has such a rich and deep musical history. Do you feel like the \"Ladies Of The Canyon\" when you are making music in the canyon?\n\nAJ: Very much so, we refer to ourselves as that. It's funny cause Haim kind of coined the sisters of the Valley and we're like, \"Alright...\"\n\nAly Michalka: We'll take the canyon.\n\nAJ: But it's funny, Aly and I lived here together, before she got married off. And hilariously enough a big turning point for us was making a movie centered around that time in our lives. We're like, \"We're in Laurel Canyon, we're in an incredibly creative artful neighborhood, we need to honor this moment. We're not gonna be here forever. We just left our parents' homes, we're living together for the first time as adults, entering our 20s, let's make a film.\" So we ended up hiring a bunch of close friends, we raised all the money ourselves. Aly's then boyfriend, who's now her husband, ended up shooting it, he wrote it and directed it. And it was all just taking place in Laurel Canyon in this small little home, we shot it in the home. It's about kind of our lives as sisters. And that was kind of a huge moment where we realized, \"Oh, there's a lot of art to be made here.\"\n\nAly: Yeah, and that we just loved the nature aspect of Laurel Canyon and how it doesn't feel like you're in Los Angeles. But you're still close to everything and we can get to meetings easily and all of the lots and such.\n\nAJ: But it's sweet because there's this community at the hub of it where you have the Laurel Canyon Country Market and every year they take the big neighborhood photo and Pace and the dry cleaners we've been going to for years. It is very much a little community. It's very small, but it is very poignant for Aly and I. And now not only have we made a movie here, we've made our first record here in 15 years and now we're back in the canyon living next door to each other.\n\nBaltin: When did you realize you were ready to make another album?\n\nAJ: For me, it was when we were making the Sanctuary EP. We were really inundated with our work with Yves Rothman, who was producing part of that EP and we all had this come to Jesus moment of like, \"Okay, we're all three probably going to make an album together and it's gonna be great. And let's start talking about it now.\"\n\nAly: Yeah, what does that exactly consist of and what kind of a record do we actually want to make. So we started kind of daydreaming about it with him back then. And I would say when we got off the road from touring in the summer of 2019 we did some sessions with Yves early on and we were kind of dusting up songs like \"Pretty Places\" and a song called \"Way Way, Back\" and looking at some of the songs that were just kind of floating around in our catalogue that we hadn't yet released or we were looking to release. And he said, \"I think we start making this record when AJ's show wrapped in 2020 around April. We'll start making this album and we're gonna kind of shoot for this Americana vibe that is a bit of a shift from the music that we've done.\" I do feel like there's a little bit of coming back to our roots in a sense, but I also feel like we're just more confident in the music that we're making and the messaging behind it. And just kind of not giving a f**k about writing for radio or writing for a specific genre. We just wanted to make music we felt really good that we were proud about, and about things that were not only important to us, but important to the fan base. So obviously the pandemic happened; AJ's show ended up wrapping earlier than April, it wrapped end of March, and then we took April and May to work out some of the demo tracks we had delivered to Yves at the beginning of the year. Then from that point on we started really diving into these songs and forming a really great basis for able to sing vocals on and then got in the studio at Sunset Sound and cut it.\n\nBaltin: Were there things that emerged in the making of this record that surprised you because as you say you are whole different people now? You are so much older and more confident.\n\nAly: Which can sometimes be hard to describe to people, but you just nailed it. We are whole different people. Yes, there's still the essence of Aly and AJ in there because it's just who we are as humans. But we've experienced so much more just when it comes to being out on the road, loving life and not writing music in our family home anymore. We now own our own places and we're functioning adults. So I think our perspective has completely shifted from when we were 14 and 16 and we were just writing about things that were either happening to us at the time or we were writing about love that we had yet to experience. So e always felt that title really fit the album and when we started describing what this record was supposed to feel like those lyrics came to mind from a song called \"Don't Need Nothing.\" And it felt like a complete no-brainer for the record to be called that. But now looking back on it, and that was in June when we decided on that title, it feels even more right. Because people are finally getting out and into the sun and into life and just being a normal human again. And if this record can capture some bit of that then we've really done our job.\n\nBaltin: As you say going back to your roots were there influences that really shaped this record?\n\nAly: I think, for us, a lot of the going back to our roots was just writing songs on the guitar, on an acoustic. I think that was a big thing for us. And also I think just going back to trying to get the best vocal performance from the two of us, whether that was one of us singing or the two of us singing together in harmony. I think a lot of it had to do with trying to get really authentic performances and not perfecting them too much.\n\nAJ: This record just feels like it has raw edges to it. It doesn't feel like super, sparkly pop, which the last two EPs we made a lot of it was electronic '80s-inspired pop. Which I love that kind of music. That's where we felt most comfortable in that moment when we were writing. And now it's changed. When you were talking about a through line for the record I think the coolest thing about this record is that it was all played live in a live space with four musicians at a time. And for Aly and I to visit a studio like Sunset Sound, which a lot of records we listened to in the past and currently have been made out of there, performing in that room and in a live band room with four or five musicians at one time there's something it does to the record that brings such a life and an energy that next thing you know you're recording vocals onto live instrumentation and you're singing differently. It felt good to go in that kind of record making.\n\nBaltin: Are there shows that really inspire you when it comes to the idea of playing these songs live?\n\nAly: AJ and my husband went and saw War On Drugs and I was very jealous. I think I was out of town. But they said that show was incredible.\n\nAJ: They could jam for hours and you were totally engaged. It just works.\n\nAly: We love the National, we've been to a ton of their shows.\n\nAJ: Sufjan [Stevens], Ray Lamontagne, we connect with a lot of male musicians.\n\nAly: One of my favorite shows I've seen live that was a female artist was Feist. I saw her in Vancouver and it was during that latest record, Pleasure. I thought she was unreal live. I felt like I knew who she was as an artist because I knew her songs, but I didn't really know her artistry that deep. And it was a brilliant show. It was quite intimate, it was maybe not even a 2000-seater type venue."
