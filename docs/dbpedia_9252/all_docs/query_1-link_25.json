        "text": "Music duo Aly & AJ, also known as Alyson and Amanda Joy Michalka, just saw their hit \"Potential Breakup Song\" go viral on TikTok, but they're not letting their music career be a thing of '00s nostalgia. The sisters just teased the sound of their upcoming album, and it could be the optimistic soundtrack we need for 2021.\n\nAly & AJ's last album Insomniatic debuted in 2007, and featured singles like the recently resurfaced \"Potential Breakup Song\" as well as \"Like Whoa\" and the Joe Jonas-inspired track \"Flattery.\" While the pair released songs like \"Take Me\" and \"Church\" in recent years, they have yet to release a full length album. That will change in 2021, when the singers drop their yet-untitled album."
