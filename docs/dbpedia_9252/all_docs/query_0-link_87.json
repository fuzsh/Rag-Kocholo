        "text": "When Alyson and AJ Michalka decided to release new music, as independent artists, back in 2017, the sisters had no way of knowing whether fans of their work a decade earlier would still be around to listen.\n\nSigned to Disney’s Hollywood Records in the early aughts, Aly & AJ dominated the radio with a string of pop hits like “Potential Breakup Song” and “Chemicals React.” After stepping away from music to pursue more acting projects—Aly starred on the CW hit iZombie for five seasons; AJ was a fan favorite on the long-running sitcom The Goldbergs—the duo returned with the slinky “Take Me.” Fans rejoiced at their return, while new listeners delighted in the discovery of a sister duo who made flawless synth-pop—and also happened to be former Disney Channel stars.\n\nTwo EPs, two albums, and four tours later, Aly & AJ have rebuilt their fanbase from the ground up. They recently wrapped the biggest headlining tour of their careers in support of their latest album, With Love From. Swapping the electronic synths of their last few releases for acoustic guitars, the album was made to be heard live with a flock of screaming fans. There’ll be plenty of opportunities to hear those songs and more—yes, even “Potential Breakup Song”—on the second leg of the With Love From tour this fall.\n\nAhead of those performances, which include a stop at LA’s famed Greek Theater in September, Aly & AJ shared some recent snapshots from life on the road."
