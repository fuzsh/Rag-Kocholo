In rare circumstances, the union offers cash help during times of illness or other emergencies. It facilitates negotiations between employees and management and serves as a tool for resolving conflicts. A union unifies the workforce under one banner and encourages members to use peaceful means to meet their demands, which is also advantageous to the business. The workers gain confidence from joining a union and come to feel like valuable members of the company. It helps the workers advance to senior positions and offers promotions and education.

When textile mills were first constructed in Bombay in 1851, the first trade union was organised there. With the opening of jute mills in Calcutta in 1854, trade unions also developed there. C.P. Mazumdar and Shorabji Shapuri Bengali were among the leaders of these first labour upheavals in the nation. The Madras Textile Workers' strike was noteworthy. The first world war's worsened lifestyle and exposure to the outside world led to a rise in class awareness among the workforce. The growth of the movement found fertile footing as a result. The early trade union era is referred to as this time frame.

Since a Trade Union makes decisions for the employeesâ€™ good, it relies on collective community action to do so. Therefore, it requires the demography of workers from all aspects of administration. It takes more than 7 people to start a trade union. This must contain employees from all faces of the company, including administrative managers, sanitation workers, and executives. Most of these include members with a shared interest within themselves who strive to make changes to improve a work environment.
