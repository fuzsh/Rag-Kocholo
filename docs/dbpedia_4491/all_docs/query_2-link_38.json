        "text": "Effective January 1, 2009, Designated Subjects Career Technical Education (CTE) Teaching Credentials may be issued to individuals who meet the requirements for either the preliminary or clear credential as outlined below. All applications must be submitted for processing through a Commission-approved CTE program sponsor. See the Commission website for a list of Commission-approved program sponsors.\n\nAuthorization\n\nThe Preliminary Designated Subjects CTE Teaching Credential authorizes the holder to teach in the subject or subjects named on the credential in grades twelve and below and in classes organized primarily for adults, in career technical, trade or vocational courses. The Clear Designated Subjects CTE Teaching Credential authorizes the holder to teach in the subject or subjects named on the credential in grades twelve and below and in classes organized primarily for adults, including services to English learners in Specially Designed Academic Instruction Delivered in English (SDAIE) in career technical, trade or vocational courses.\n\nAvailable subjects, also known as industry sectors, are as follows:\n\nPeriod of Validity\n\nThe preliminary credential is valid for three years. The clear credential is valid for five years and must be renewed online every five year renewal cycle. Once issued, there are no additional academic requirements to renew the clear credential.\n\nTransition from Vocational Education and Five-Year CTE Teaching Credentials\n\nHolders of Life or Clear Designated Subjects Vocational or CTE Teaching Credentials issued under previous regulations and statutes may choose to either maintain their documents or transition to CTE credentials issued under the provisions of SB 1104, outlined in this information leaflet. Due to significant changes to the program standards, holders of these credentials may not qualify for the Clear CTE Teaching Credential under the new\n\nprogram standards. For additional information, please see Coded Correspondence 09-01.\n\nTransition to New Industry Sectors\n\nEffective September 1, 2014, five of the 15 Industry Sectors listed on the Designated Subjects CTE Teaching Credential will have new titles. The new Industry Sector titles will be issued on all first time, new type, and renewed Designated Subjects CTE Teaching Credentials on or after September 1, 2014.\n\nA Preliminary or Clear Designated Subjects CTE Teaching Credential originally issued prior to September 1, 2014 based on an occupation that moved to a new Industry Sector remains valid and appropriate for the service aligned with their occupation. Employing agencies should confirm the original issuance date of the credential and use the Crosswalk Guidance Chart in Appendix B and/or Table 2 found in Coded Correspondence 14-08 to determine if an educator’s occupational experience is appropriate for their assigned Industry Sector.\n\nThe holder of a Preliminary Designated Subjects CTE Credential who completes a Clear program after September 1, 2014 has the option of keeping their original authorization or, if their occupation has moved, may transition to the new Industry Sector. Educators who elect to change Industry Sectors must work with their program sponsor to verify that the occupational training and experience held at the time the initial Preliminary CTE Credential was recommended was appropriate for the newly aligned Industry Sector. See the guidance chart in Appendix A of\n\nCoded Correspondence 14-08. The previously issued Industry Sector authorization will be removed from their credential. Educators should confirm with their local employing agency whether any change in Industry Sector is necessary for employment purposes.\n\nBack to top\n\nTerms and Definitions\n\nWork Experience\n\nVerification of work experience means written confirmation of the applicant’s qualifying experience, signed by the applicant’s past or present employer(s) on company letterhead that attests to and/or includes all of the following:\n\nEmployer’s name, address, and telephone number.\n\nThe working relationship of the person signing the verification to the applicant.\n\nBeginning and ending dates of employment.\n\nComplete description of duties.\n\nA statement as to whether or not the employment was full-time (If employment was less than full-time, an accounting of the number of hours the applicant was employed is required).\n\nIf the applicant was self-employed or if the applicant’s experience was avocational, verification shall include a statement, signed by the applicant under penalty of perjury, detailing the information described in 1–5 above, and must be further substantiated, in writing, by other person(s) having first-hand knowledge of the applicant’s self-employment or avocation, such as the applicant’s accountant, major supplier of goods, or major user of goods or services.\n\nAt least one year of the required work experience must be within the last five years, or two years within the last ten years, immediately preceding the issuance of the preliminary credential. 1000 clock hours shall be the minimum required for each year of work experience. Part-time work experience may be cumulated to equate to the required 1000 clock hours of work experience.\n\nCompletion of forty-eight (48) semester units of postsecondary vocational training related to the industry sector(s) named on the credential may be substituted for a maximum of two of the three years of required work experience. The course work must be verified by official transcript and may be made on a pro rata basis up to the two-year maximum.\n\nAdditionally, one of the following may be used as one year of work experience toward meeting the three years of required experience:\n\nPossession of an advanced industry certificate related to the industry sector to be named on the preliminary credential, as determined by a Commission-approved CTE program sponsor.\n\nOne year of full-time general education teaching experience providing instructional services in preschool or grades K-12 earned in a public or private school of equivalent status.\n\nAn individual must have at least one year of actual work experience to qualify for the three-year preliminary credential.\n\nFor more information, visit the Professional Preparation Programs or the Commission's website.\n\nBack to top"
