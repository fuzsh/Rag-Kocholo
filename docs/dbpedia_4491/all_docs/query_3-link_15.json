Trade unions debate that their proposals on the budget will increase economic growth and improve job creation. This essay will analyze whether trade union alternatives will support or improve economic growth, the way the national budget proposes.

This will definitely be to the benefit of the community.

For example: the UK Commission for Employment and Skills came to the conclusion that over 80% of the United Kingdom’s 2020 workforce is already employed. Taking this shift into account, employers should take part in skills development activities to invest for training their employees."
