        "text": "As a professional association and recognised trade union for doctors in the UK, no one better understands your day-to-day working lives or the challenges you face.\n\nWe provide individual and collective representation; we’re here to stand up for your rights and fight hard to champion the profession.\n\nEvery member receives protection in the workplace, and we ensure the collective interests of all doctors are defended and promoted.\n\nSince the inception of the NHS, we have been recognised for collective bargaining purposes within national negotiating machinery and by individual employers.\n\nThat means we’re not just the voice of the profession but have responsibility for negotiating your pay and other conditions of service at both national and local levels.\n\nWe are officially recognised by government and the DDRB (the Review Body on Doctors’ and Dentists’ Remuneration) as an association representing the views of GPs in the health service and NHS doctors in hospitals, public health and community services, employed under national agreements.\n\nWe are also one of only two organisations to give evidence to the Armed Forces’ Pay Review Body.\n\nIn 1971, we were registered as an independent trade union, and we’re currently included on the list of trade unions maintained by the Certification Officer in accordance with the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992.\n\nWe represent members’ interests in developing and maintaining their terms and conditions of employment.\n\nWe protect individual members and the collective interests of doctors in the workplace. We offer support in local negotiations, personal advice and assistance, and representation to and on behalf of members.\n\nOver two thirds of practising UK doctors are in membership.\n\nAs we are recognised for collective bargaining purposes, we and our representatives benefit from legislative rights, including those relating to:\n\nthe provision of information\n\nthe right to be consulted on proposed changes\n\nrepresentation of members, individually and collectively\n\nfacilities and time off work for accredited representatives.\n\nMembers play an integral part in our process decision making process.\n\nRead more about our democratic structure and governance\n\nNational negotiations\n\nWe have bargaining rights in respect of all employed doctors in the NHS, whether or not they are BMA members. Members and officers of our branch of practice committees sit on joint negotiating committees, and produce guidance on the implementation of national agreements.\n\nWe are in continual contact with ministers, government departments, members of both Parliaments, the National Assemblies and many other influential bodies. Through these contacts and the media we promote doctors’ views and campaign on health issues.\n\nNational pay scales for medical staff employed in the NHS are determined by ministers in light of recommendations from the DDRB. Each year we submit evidence to the review body. Other NHS conditions of service are agreed between the Departments of Health and the BMA.\n\nWorkplace and local negotiations\n\nUntil NHS trusts were established in 1991, all NHS-employed medical staff were subject to national terms and conditions of service. Now, however, most NHS employers can determine the pay and conditions of service for all their staff, except doctors in training who remain subject to nationally negotiated terms and conditions. As a response to this local freedom, we introduced local negotiating committees (LNCs).\n\nEmployers are obliged to consult with and provide information to recognised trade unions and this is often through the local representative.\n\nLNCs are now established in almost all NHS organisations that employ doctors. They meet regularly to identify issues for negotiation with local management, monitor the application of local agreements, and agree and monitor arrangements for the implementation of national agreements in their organisations.\n\nWe accredit members to act as local representatives for a particular geographic location or branch of practice within employing organisations.\n\nLNCs also usually nominate BMA representatives for other joint committees (such as the Joint Medical Consultative Council or health and safety committees), and work with other trade unions in areas of common interest.\n\nAdvice and representation for BMA members is provided by our team of advisers and member relations staff across the UK."
