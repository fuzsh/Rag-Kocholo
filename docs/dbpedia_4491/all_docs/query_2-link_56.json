Compare your school matches and apply to your top choice today.\n\nTrade careers feature growth and salaries that can rival or surpass bachelor's degree jobs.\n\nMichigan's over 60 trade schools fuel the state's extensive blue collar workforce.\n\nTrade schools in Michigan provide many financial aid options, including scholarships.\n\nMichigan trade schools and programs need accreditation in fields with mandated licensure.\n\nTrade schools offer career-based technical training in specialized skilled trades. These programs typically take less than two years to complete, cost less than full degrees, and provide direct access to the workforce.\n\nAccording to the College Navigator from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Michigan has more than 60 schools that offer two-year or less programs. Here, we look at the available trade jobs and best trade schools in Michigan.\n\nTrade Jobs and Salaries in Michigan\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the following jobs have some of the highest employment numbers in the state. These careers can be accessed without a postsecondary degree education. We also outline the projected growth rates and median annual salaries for each position.\n\nDental Hygienist\n\nProjected Employment Growth (2020-2030): 11%\n\nMedian Annual Salary (May 2021): $77,810\n\nEarn nearly $200 more per week than the median wages for bachelor's graduates\n\nCardiovascular Technician\n\nProjected Employment Growth (2020-2030): 14%\n\nMedian Annual Salary (May 2021): $75,380\n\nEarn just under $150 more per week than the median wages for bachelor's graduates\n\nTruck Driver\n\nProjected Employment Growth (2020-2030): 6%\n\nMedian Annual Salary (May 2021): $48,310\n\nEarn a similar wage to the median annual wages for all occupations\n\nTrade Schools in Michigan\n\nTrade school programs feature more specialized and career-focused training than traditional postsecondary programs. The studies omit general education coursework in favor of hands-on training for a specific trade. Tradespeople provide us with many essential services, including automotive, construction, plumbing, and HVAC work.\n\nAccording to NCES, there are 63 Michigan trade schools, including institutions for cosmetology, boat building, aviation, and medical education. The Center for Economic and Policy Research's most recent Blue Collar Job Tracker reported that Michigan had the fifth-highest percentage of blue collar jobs in the country in 2016, a positive sign for prospective tradespeople.\n\nAverage Cost of Trade School in Michigan\n\nTo get an average cost of trade schools in Michigan, we looked at programs lasting less than two years. These schools have an average annual tuition of $12,735, as per the Education Data Initiative. Comparatively, the average annual tuition at four-year schools was $13,315 in Michigan's public schools and $29,405 in private schools in 2019-20, as per NCES data.\n\nAccording to the BLS, professionals with some college but no degree made a weekly average of $877 in 2020, whereas bachelor's graduates made $1,305. That suggests that trade school graduates take about 14-29 weeks to earn what they paid for their training, depending on the program length. Conversely, bachelor's graduates need between 40-90 weeks to earn what they paid for their training, depending on whether they attended public or private school.\n\nFinancial Aid for Trade Schools in Michigan\n\nMichigan trade schools offer several financial aid options for their students, including federal aid programs, loans, and scholarships. Scholarships usually offer awards to promising students or those with financial need. The following are just a few of the available scholarship programs for Michigan students.\n\nScholarships for Trade Programs\n\nWilliam Cayen Skilled Trades Scholarship\n\nThis scholarship is available to students enrolled in a skilled trade program in Oakland, Macomb, or Wayne County. They also need a 2.5 minimum GPA to qualify.\n\nFour $2,500 awards\n\nDeadline to Apply: March\n\nApplicants must submit a short essay and letters of recommendation for consideration. They also need to be members or become members of the Michigan Schools and Government Credit Union.\n\nScholarships for Welding Programs\n\nAmerican Welding Society Welder Training Scholarship\n\nThis scholarship is available to students from the AWS district attending a trade school for welder training.\n\nUp to 25 $1,000 awarded in each district\n\nDeadline to Apply: November\n\nOnly students in a certificate program less than two years in length qualify.\n\nScholarships for Construction Programs\n\nGreater Michigan Construction Academy Scholarship\n\nThis scholarship is available to new high school or GED graduates attending the Greater Michigan Construction Academy in a craft training program.\n\nCovers tuition and book costs for the first year of training\n\nDeadline to Apply: March\n\nCandidates must submit two recommendation letters. The scholarship committee will evaluate candidates on their grades, attendance, skills, extracurricular activities, and awards.\n\nIn most cases, scholarship funds do not require repayment, and some programs offer renewable funds for multiple semesters or years. Scholarships may come from the government, private organizations, or schools. Applicants should pay close attention to the application requirements, as they vary by program.\n\nFor more information on paying for trade school, check here: Vocational Education Financial Aid\n\nAccreditations in Michigan\n\nTrade schools in Michigan have several accreditations depending on their field. Some possible organizations include the Council on Occupational Education, the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education and Training, and the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges.\n\nOther institutional accreditation organizations specialize in certain fields, such as the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities and the Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools. Institutional accreditation in trade schools helps assure students that they will receive a high-quality education recognized by the industry.\n\nProgrammatic accreditation or recognition may also be available and required by certain industries. For example, accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs or approval from the Federal Aviation Administration may be required for postgraduate licensure.\n\nApprenticeships in Michigan\n\nIn addition to trade schools in Michigan, aspiring tradespeople can pursue apprenticeships. These programs combine on-the-job training and coursework to help provide practical and career-specific skills. The MI-Apprenticeship program connects students with employers and mentors in many industries, including healthcare, automation, and information technology.\n\nTrade high schools and programs for high school students are also available in Michigan. These programs and institutions help prepare students for career and technical training or allow them to access the workforce directly after high school.\n\nBest Michigan Trade Schools\n\nEach program on the list will meet our criteria, being:\n\nRankings Methodology:\n\nMust offer less than one-year certifications\n\nAccredited\n\nLess than 18-to-1 student-to-faculty ratio\n\nLess than $35,000 in tuition\n\nAbcott Institute\n\nChevron Down\n\nChevron Up\n\nType: Private for-profit\n\nCost: $2,846\n\nLocation: Southfield, Michigan\n\nAdmission requirements: Applicants need a high school or GED diploma.\n\nGraduation requirements: Graduates must complete 39-60 credits and the certification exams if applicable.\n\nAccreditation: The school is accredited by the Council on Occupational Education.\n\nAbout the Program:\n\nAbcott Institute enrolls nearly 150 undergraduate students in its medical assistant, practical nurse, surgical technician, and HVAC/R systems technician programs.
