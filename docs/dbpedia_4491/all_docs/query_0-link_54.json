        "text": "Statement: Labour delivers important first step to protecting right to strike\n\nThe ETUC congratulates the TUC and their affiliated trade unions on an important union victory for workers in Britain and throughout Europe. We welcome the commitment by the UK government that the anti-worker anti-strike Minimum Service Levels legislation will be repealed through the upcoming Employment Rights Bill. This legislation represented an attack on the ability of workers to win a decent, secure and dignified working life.\n\nETUC sorry to hear of passing of Fritz Verzetnitsch\n\nFritz Verzetnitsch passed away on 18 July 2024. He was ETUC President for 10 years between 1993 and 2003 and long-time President of Austria’s ÖGB. “We pay tribute to a trade union leader who was committed to building workers’ power across Europe,” said Esther Lynch, ETUC General Secretary. “Our sympathy goes out to his wife, family and to the ÖGB.”\n\nTraineeship Package\n\nTraineeship Package Adopted at the Executive Committee Meeting of 25-26 June 2024.\n\nJoint statement by ETUC and Argentinian trade unions\n\nJoint statement by ETUC and Argentinian trade unions\n\nAdopted Resolution - On the offensive to combat gender-based violence in the world of work\n\nAdopted at the Executive Committee meeting of 24-25 June 2024 Introduction Preventing and combatting gender-based violence in the world of work is a key priority of the ETUC. The recently adopted Directive combatting violence against women and domestic violence fails to deliver meaningful provisions to make the world of work safer for women workers. It also fails to recognise our role as trade unions to end gender-based violence.\n\nEnsuring security: New impulse for peace needed\n\nEnsuring security: New impulse for peace needed&nbsp; Adopted at the Executive Committee meeting of 24-25 June 2024. In line with its Constitution and with its Charter of Values, the ETUC recalls that peace is a precondition for the full exercise of human rights and stable democracy and that there is no peace and security without social justice."
