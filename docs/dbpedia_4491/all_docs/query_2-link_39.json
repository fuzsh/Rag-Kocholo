        "text": "While it might seem like a college education is essential for a successful post-high school career, don’t give in quite yet. Maybe college isn’t your thing. And maybe, just maybe, you’d excel in a more hands-on, trade-oriented career. To get there, you may not need a 4-year school, as some jobs don’t require a Bachelor’s degree. So don’t get pressured to attend a 4-year school if you don’t need to.\n\nIf you think that a trade-oriented career is up your alley, you can start the process by enrolling in a trade school, or also commonly called vocational or tech school. A trade school is a technical post-secondary institution that teaches you a specific skill or trade, preparing you for a technical occupation. You’ll get hands-on education and relevant job training for less time and less money.\n\nThe stereotype is that getting a trade school degree means that you won’t land a mid-level or high paying job. But, that isn’t necessarily the case at all. Research gathered by the U.S Bureau of Labor and Statistics tells us which trade school degrees will produce the highest paying jobs. In addition, you can earn just as much money (if not more!) by learning a trade, and you won’t have the student loan debt that most people have who pursue a 4-year degree. Plus, it won’t take you as long to learn your trade, so you can get to work a whole lot quicker than the traditional path.\n\nAnd if you’re worried about finding a job–don’t.\n\nMany of the careers we mention below have a positive job outlook for the next decade, so for the most part, you’ll be in good hands. In addition, with the surge of college education in recent years, there’s been less of an emphasis on learning a trade, which is creating a void in those careers in our society. So while a college graduate with a Business degree might find it hard to land a job, you could go to school for fewer years, spend less money, and come right out with a skill that can benefit the area in which you live.\n\nLet’s talk a little about the kinds of degrees, certifications, and continuing education programs you could pursue. Not every program will result in a degree–and that’s ok–because you may not need one for your trade. But–it will still be important to have specific training to get you ready for the job. When looking at trade school degrees, you might see the following ways to earn a trade school degree:\n\nDiploma/Certificate\n\nAt a trade school, you could earn a diploma or certificate for your study in a specific area, which could take considerably less time than a degree. They will not be the same as an Associate or Bachelor’s degree, but could be exactly what you need to begin work in your career.\n\nAssociate Degree\n\nSome careers, like a Respiratory Therapist, will require an associate degree from a junior/community college or trade school. An associate degree can typically be completed in 2 years. While you’ll be able to enter your profession right away, having an associate degree is a good starting place for anyone who thinks that maybe in the future a 4-year degree will be necessary.\n\nNon-Credit Programs\n\nSome trade school careers might require a basic education but no formal degree. That’s where non-credit programs come in. They will give you a fundamental background and get you ready for your career, without any credit.\n\nContinuing Education\n\nOther careers might require continuing education in your field, but not require a certification or degree. These classes are targeted towards professionals in a field that need extra or specific training.\n\nHow do I pick the right job path?\n\nUltimately the decision about what career to pursue is your decision. But, here are a few factors to consider:\n\nyour interests: what do you like to do? what brings you joy? what makes you want to get out of the bed in the morning?\n\nyour skillset: in what areas are you skilled? what past experiences do you have that will help you in a job?\n\nyour dreams: what do you want to do with your life? what big dreams do you have?\n\nHow do I find the right career for me?\n\nfind your passion: the best way to find out what job could be best for you is to discover your passion, and it’s okay if that takes time. Don’t feel like you have to rush into a trade school if you aren’t sure yet. If you are sure, then great! If not–consider a ‘gap’ year and take some time.\n\nconsider job shadowing: take your top 3 career interests and shadow a few people. Take a good look at what their day looks like and see if you would enjoy what they do. Job shadowing is a great way to nix potential careers off your list or fall in love with a specific trade.\n\nMasonry\n\nMedian Pay 2020 (BLS): $47,710\n\nMasons will work with building materials like bricks, stones, limestone, tile, or concrete to create structures, including chimneys, walkways, walls, and more. The job could include basic construction work like tearing down existing structures or designing and rebuilding them.

You will need an extensive apprenticeship to learn the trade and to be able to work unsupervised.\n\nSkills you’ll need:\n\nread and comprehend technical and safety instructions\n\ncreativity to create beautiful, unique patterns\n\nmathematical skills\n\nability to carry or lift heavy materials\n\ncommunication with team members about job details\n\nJob Outlook for 2019-29: down 3%\n\nLicensed Practical Nursing\n\nMedian Pay 2020 (BLS): $48,820\n\nLicensed Practical Nurses, or LPNs, will provide basic nursing care in hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, or in private care.

It is important to remember that construction operators could have harsh working conditions, with having to work outside in all weather conditions or working at night due to road construction. If you enter into this field, you’ll definitely need to love getting dirty, as this profession will involve a lot of manual labor, greasy work, dusty environments, or muddy construction sites.\n\nYou can specialize in three areas:\n\nPaving and surface equipment operators\n\nPile-driver operators\n\nConstruction equipment operator\n\nEducation and training you’ll need:\n\nEducation: High school diploma or equivalent\n\nApprenticeship: typically, you’ll need 3-4 years of apprenticeship coupled with technical training in addition to on-the-job training\n\nLicensure: some states might require you to earn your CDL license to operate/drive machinery\n\nSkills you’ll need:\n\ncommunication skills with co-workers\n\nhand-eye coordination\n\nability to complete manual labor/lift heavy objects\n\ntroubleshooting skills to identify/fix problems with equipment\n\nmachine operation skills\n\nJob Outlook for 2019-29: up 4%\n\nDiesel Mechanic\n\nMedian Pay 2020 (BLS): $50,200\n\nDiesel Technicians and Mechanic will inspect and repair any vehicle with a diesel engine, like a bus or truck.

Dental hygiene offers you a good solution–you’ll still get to work with clients and their teeth under the supervision of a dentist.
