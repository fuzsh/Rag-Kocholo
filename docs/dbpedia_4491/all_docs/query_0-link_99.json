        "text": "“The labor movement was the principal force that transformed misery and despair into hope and progress.” A few words by King Martin Luther describe the change in the industry that the labor movement or trade unions brought into the world.\n\nIt was in the year 1918 when the first Trade Union in India was formed. It was called the Madras Labor Union. Since then a large number of unions sprang up in all the industrial centers of India. Hence, the Trade Union Act came into being in 1926. In this article, we will learn all about the Trade Union Act of 1926. Let’s get started!\n\nThis article covers the following:\n\nWhat is a trade union?\n\nWhat is the trade union act of 1926?\n\nThe extent of the act and commencement.\n\nMode of registration\n\nRights and liabilities of registration\n\nState amendment\n\nChange of name\n\nDissolution\n\nReturns\n\nHow can Deskera assist you?\n\nWhat is a Trade Union?\n\nA trade union is a group of workers or employees intending to maintain employees' rights and ensure that they are not discriminated against. Along with this, they mainly form ideas on how to improve their conditions as employees.\n\nHere is a list of things that a trade union works after:\n\nAttainment of better wages.\n\nAttainment of better benefits.\n\nImprovement of their living conditions.\n\nImprovement of working conditions.\n\nAligning complaint procedures.\n\nWork after getting proper holidays, healthcare, and retirement benefits.\n\nProtection of their integrity and rights.\n\nHelping employees strengthen the unity amongst them.\n\nWhat is the Trade Union Act of 1926?\n\nWay before the rise of industrialization, a monstrous scope, there were private agreements between employees and their managers. Hence, there was no real necessity for developing any apparatus administering the connection among the employees or laborers and businesses that emerged up to that point.\n\nHowever, after the mechanization of factories, this intimate relationship between the two parties got lost. Its importance or significance too faded away with time. While it was still easy for employees of a specific position to continue their jobs peacefully and enjoy the benefits, the lower class of laborers who were completely dependent on the wages had to suffer. They were being exploited by their managers and their\n\nThis irreconcilable situation among laborers, managers, and the pain of laborers brought about the development of the Trade Union Act of 1926. The Trade Union Act of 1926 is an act to provide for the registration of Trade Unions and, in certain respects, to define the law relating to registered Trade Unions.\n\nThe Extent of the Act & Commencement\n\nTrade Union Act of 1926 extends to the whole of India.\n\nIt came into force after the approval of the Central Government in the year 1926\n\nBefore we learn more about the act, let us quickly understand all the terminologies concerning the act that you will find in this article.\n\nExecutive- The body by whatever name called, to which the management of the affairs of a Trade Union is entrusted.\n\nOffice Bearer- In the case of a Trade Union, this includes any member of the executive thereof but does not include an auditor.\n\nPrescribed- By prescribed, it means prescribed by regulations made under the Trade Union Act of 1926.\n\nRegistered Office- Under this Act, the registered office means the head office.\n\nRegistered Trade Union- Trade Union registered under the Trade Union Act of 1926.\n\nTrade Dispute- Trade Dispute is any dispute between employers and workmen or between workmen and workmen, or between employers and employers which is connected with the employment or non-employment, or the terms of employment or the conditions of labor, of any person, and “workmen” means all persons employed in trade or industry whether or not in the employment of the employer with whom the trade dispute arises.\n\nAppointment of Registrars\n\nThe appropriate Government shall appoint a person to be the Registrar of Trade Unions for each state. The appropriate Government may appoint as many Additional and Deputy Registrars of Trade Unions as it thinks fit for exercising and discharging, under the superintendence and direction of the Registrar, such powers and functions of the Registrar under this Act as it may, by order, specify and define the local limits within which any such Additional or Deputy Registrar shall exercise and discharge the powers and functions so specified.\n\nSubject to the provisions of any order under sub-section, where an Additional or Deputy Registrar exercises and discharges the powers and functions of a Registrar in an area within which the registered office of a Trade Union is situated, the Additional or Deputy Registrar shall be deemed to be the Registrar about the Trade Union for this Act.\n\nMode of Registration\n\nAny seven or more members of a Trade Union may, by subscribing their names to the rules of the Trade Union and by otherwise complying with the provisions of this Act concerning registration, apply for registration of the Trade Union under this Act.\n\nApplication for Registration\n\nEvery application for registration of a Trade Union shall be made to the Registrar.

the Registrar to register the Union and to issue a certificate of registration under the provisions of section 9 or setting aside the order for withdrawal or cancellation of the certificate, as the case may be, and the Registrar shall comply with such order.\n\n(3) For an appeal under sub-section\n\n(1) an appellate Court shall, so far as may be, follow the same procedure and have the same
