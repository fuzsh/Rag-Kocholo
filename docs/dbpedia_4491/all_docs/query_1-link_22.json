        "text": "Trade Union and Employment Forum\n\nH&P's Trade Union and Employment Forum meets several times a year, bringing together trade unionists with professional historians and other interested groups. It considers trade union issues against their historical background, exploring different perspectives on the past and the present in order to suggest new lines of policy for the future.\n\nIts regular meetings have covered such themes as: political funding and relations with the main political parties; attitudes towards the European Union; democracy in the workplace; and apprenticeship and training. It has also organised higher-profile events to mark the anniversaries of pivotal moments, such as the 1986 Wapping dispute in the printing industry, and the 1984 miners’ strike. When the opportunity presents itself, the Forum works in partnership with other organizations, including a session at the Unions 21 annual conference and a fringe event at the Trades Union Congress.\n\nWe are always keen to hear from potential participants, co-organizers and sponsors. If you or your organization would like to be involved, please contact one of the Management Committee.\n\nEuropean Works Councils: The Effects of Brexit\n\nJoin Catherine Barnard: Brexit and the Legal Challenges facing European Works Councils & Jonathan Hayward: Brexit and the Practical Challenges facing European Works Councils, for this online event on 23 January 2024.\n\nRead More\n\nDemocracy at Work: 150 years of the TUC\n\nIn October this year, to celebrate the TUC’s 150th anniversary, the History and Policy Trade Union and Employment Forum held a conference in King’s College, London at which a series of experts and practitioners presented a picture of key figures during that time and discussed past and current roles of the TUC.\n\nRead More\n\nThe future of UK labour law\n\nTrade Union Forum\n\nFour experts from the academic history and policy making fields explore how the entire framework of labour law in Britain might be revisited following Britain's departure from the EU.\n\nRead More\n\nFlexible work and its consequences: historical perspectives\n\nTrade Union Forum\n\nOn 6 April Noel Whiteside, Professor of Comparative Public Policy at the University of Warwick and Sally Brett, Head of Equality, Inclusion and Culture at the British Medical Association discussed flexible working now and in the past.\n\nRead More\n\nWorkers in the Boardroom\n\nTrade Union Forum\n\nDuring her bid for the Tory leadership in July 2016, Theresa May called for employee representation on company boards.
