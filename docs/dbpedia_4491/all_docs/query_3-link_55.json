        "text": "A cartel, as defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), is when firms create a formal agreement to \"raise or fix prices and to reduce output in order to increase profits.\" This agreement harms consumers because it makes products unavailable or overly-expensive. Industries that are made up of a few large companies, have high start-up costs, and produce less complex goods are more likely to collude on price and production. Historically, cartels have existed in the steel, railroad transportation, and vitamin industries. In the oil and gas industry, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is often used as an example of a cartel. Although there is debate around whether the economic evidence demonstrates it is a true cartel, OPEC's member countries do exert market influence. The focus of OPEC is to control oil output in order to influence prices. As natural gas may be produced with with oil, some view OPEC as also being an indirect natural gas cartel. Additionally, a group of countries have formed what is called the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), which some refer to as a gas-OPEC. The GECF does not try to limit production, nor influence prices in other ways, but some members have called on the organization to change its mandate and try to control production to \"make the market more stable.\" The GECF has been around for about ten years, which is about the same amount of time that it took OPEC to gain its footing and insert itself into the oil market.\n\nPrior to OPEC, the oil market was dominated by seven major oil companies often known as the Seven Sisters, who colluded to manipulate price and production, sometimes under the direct request of the U.S. Government, and other times investigated by the U.S. Government for violating antitrust laws. After World War II, faced with threats of nationalizing oil production, the Seven Sisters agreed to split oil profits fifty-fifty with oil exporting countries. However, as competition from Russian oil increased, Standard Oil of New Jersey (Exxon) concluded they needed to drastically reduce oil prices. The other majors reluctantly followed suit, which ultimately reduced income to the oil exporting countries. In 1960, as a response to the price drop, the oil exporting countries created OPEC to diminish the influence of multinational oil companies."
