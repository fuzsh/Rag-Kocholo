The WTO, as the cornerstone of the multilateral rules-based global trading system, plays a key part in supporting climate action. It provides a framework of disciplines to facilitate global trade and serves as a forum to negotiate further trade openness and to discuss trade concerns. The WTO rules require members to be transparent when adopting new measures impacting trade with legitimate policy objectives, such as combatting climate change. The WTO seeks to ensure that such measures are coherent and fit-for-purpose and do not create unjustifiable discrimination.\n\nThe issue of climate change, per se, is not found expressly in the WTO agreements. However, the goals of sustainable development and environmental protection are central to the WTO, as captured in the preamble to its founding charter, the Marrakesh Agreement. The WTO gives members the opportunity to hold open and informed dialogue on trade and climate change, to discuss related measures and to share knowledge and experiences. Trade and climate change policies can contribute towards climate action while at the same time ensuring opportunities for economic growth and diversification.\n\nStaff information notes\n\nInformation briefs\n\nOverview of trade policies adopted to address climate change\n\nClimate change in Regional Trade Agreements\n\nThe resilience of trade in the face of increasingly frequent natural disasters\n\nThe carbon content of international trade\n\nAfrica under a changing climate: the role of trade in building resilient adaptation in agriculture\n\nWhat yardstick for net-zero?
