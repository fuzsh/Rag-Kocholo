        "text": "2 What the European Union does\n\nThe second part of this publication presents a summary of what the EU does in different policy areas, including useful links to more information.\n\nCOVID-19 response\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to human tragedy, lockdowns and economic slowdown. The EU rapidly took action to protect lives and livelihoods and developed a common European response to the public health and economic challenges.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nSolidarity is at the heart of the common EU response to COVID-19. The EU is mobilising all resources available to help Member States coordinate their national responses. This includes providing objective information about the spread of the virus, effective efforts to contain it and action to repair the economic and social damage resulting from the pandemic.\n\nThe rescEU medical reserve, the first common EU stockpile of emergency medical equipment, has helped Member States facing shortages of equipment. The EU vaccine strategy aims to speed up the development, manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. The EU financed some of the upfront costs faced by vaccine producers to speed up the development and production of promising vaccines as part of its vaccine purchasing strategy. To date, five safe and effective vaccines have been authorised for use in the EU following positive scientific recommendations by the European Medicines Agency.\n\nThe Commission had secured up to 2.6 billion vaccine doses by April 2021 and negotiations continue for additional doses. In January 2021, the Commission called on Member States to speed up the roll-out of vaccination across the EU. Vaccine deliveries to EU Member States are increasing steadily and vaccination is gathering pace. The Commission is also working with the industry to increase vaccine manufacturing capacity.\n\nWork has started to rapidly produce effective vaccines for new variants. In February 2021, the Commission launched the HERA Incubator to prepare for COVID-19 variants of concern and ensure the swift development and production of effective vaccines to counter them.\n\nThe EU budget for 2021â2027 and NextGenerationEU, the recovery plan, will provide â¬1.8 trillion to support people, companies and regions, particularly those most affected by the crisis. In addition, the SURE initiative (Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency) helps preserve jobs and support families in 19 Member States.\n\nIn March 2021, the Commission presented a proposal to create an EU Digital COVID Certificate to facilitate the safe free movement of citizens within the EU during the pandemic.\n\nThe EU is committed to ensuring that safe vaccines reach all corners of the world. The Commission and EU Member States have pledged over â¬2.2 billion to COVAX, the global initiative aimed at ensuring fair access to COVID-19 vaccines, and are supporting vaccination campaigns in partner countries.\n\nHealth\n\nHealth is a major priority for the European Union. The EUâs health policy complements Members Statesâ policies to ensure that everyone living in the EU is protected from serious cross-border health threats and has access to quality healthcare.\n\nWhile the organisation of healthcare is the responsibility of individual Member States, the EU complements national policies to reach shared objectives. The EUâs health policy focuses on tackling serious EU-wide health threats, preventing diseases and ensuring an equal chance of good health and quality healthcare for all. Working together also means pooling resources, which generates economies of scale.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EUâs ambition is to ensure accessible, effective and resilient health systems in the EU. The EUâs work includes action on vaccination (including against COVID-19), fighting antimicrobial resistance, and preventing and limiting pandemics and other infectious diseases.\n\nThe EUâs role in preparing for and responding to serious cross-border health threats is essential to protecting people in Europe. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a stronger European Health Union to tackle health crises, cancer and medicine shortages together.\n\nCancer is a major cause of death in the EU and a high cost to health systems. The EU is supporting prevention, detection, early diagnosis and treatment as well as quality of life for cancer patients and survivors through Europeâs Beating Cancer Plan. The EU is active in combating smoking through tobacco legislation and promoting healthy lifestyles.\n\nThe pharmaceutical strategy aims to improve access to affordable medicines for patients, including those suffering from rare diseases. It will also support innovation and diverse supply chains, with a view to enhancing our crisis preparation.\n\nThe main instrument for financing EU health policies is the â¬5.1 billion EU4Health programme. It will fund interventions to boost disease prevention and the preparedness and resilience of healthcare systems in the EU. In addition, the Horizon Europe programme will invest â¬5.4 billion in health-related research and innovation.\n\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control assesses emerging threats so the EU and national health authorities can respond rapidly. And to ensure patients get the best treatment, all medicines in the EU must be approved at the national or the EU level (through the European Medicines Agency) before going on the market.\n\nThe European Health Insurance Card helps travellers obtain treatment if they fall ill while visiting another EU Member State, while EU law on cross-border healthcare sets out citizensâ rights when crossing borders for planned care. Through European reference networks, patients with rare or complex diseases benefit from the best expertise from across Europe without even leaving their home country.\n\nFind out more: https://ec.europa.eu/health/\n\nEuropean Green Deal\n\nThe European Green Deal is the EUâs action plan to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent. It is a growth strategy that aims to create, by 2050, a modern, resource-efficient and competitive European economy with no net emissions of greenhouse gases that leaves no one behind.\n\nClimate change and environmental degradation are threatening Europe and the world. The atmosphere is warming and the climate is changing.\n\nEnvironmental protection and economic growth can go hand in hand. Between 1990 and 2019, the EU cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 24 % while its economy grew by around 60 %.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe European Green Deal sets out how to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Reaching this target means creating a clean, circular economy, restoring biodiversity and cutting pollution. It requires action in all sectors of the economy, including:\n\ninvesting in environmentally friendly technologies;\n\nsupporting innovation in industry;\n\ncleaner, cheaper and healthier forms of private and public transport;\n\ndecarbonising the energy sector;\n\nensuring buildings are more efficient;\n\nworking with international partners to improve global environmental standards.\n\nThe EU is committed to becoming climate neutral by 2050 and has set the target of cutting net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % below 1990 levels by 2030. The first-ever European climate law will set these goals in stone and ensure that all EU policies contribute to meeting them.\n\nSignificant investment from both the EU and the national public sector, together with the private sector, will be required. The European Green Deal investment plan will mobilise at least â¬1 trillion in sustainable investments, while the Just Transition Mechanism will ensure that no region is left behind, providing targeted support to help mobilise at least â¬55 billion in the most affected regions. Climate action is a part of all the main EU spending programmes, with at least 30 % of the budget for 2021â2027 dedicated to climate-related initiatives.\n\nThe Green Deal is underpinned by an ambitious goal to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by transforming our food systems and our forest, land, water and sea use, as well as energy, cities and industry. The new EU industrial strategy will help Europeâs industry lead the twin transitions towards climate neutrality and digital leadership. Digital technologies will play an important part in achieving the EUâs 2050 climate goal, for example, by optimising energy use in many sectors including agriculture, transport and manufacturing.\n\nClimate change and biodiversity loss are global threats and the EU will continue to lead international efforts to promote the implementation of ambitious environment, climate and energy policies across the world.\n\nClimate action\n\nThe EU is working hard to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The European Green Deal is the plan to make this happen by cutting greenhouse gas emissions, investing in green technologies and protecting our natural environment, while also addressing the unavoidable consequences of climate change.\n\nThe EU is taking action in response to changes in the earthâs climate, in particular the rise in global temperatures due to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activity. Higher average temperatures have many consequences, including more frequent extreme weather events such as floods, droughts and storms. As well as posing a direct threat to people, these can also jeopardise food production and create water shortages, which can in turn trigger famine, conflicts and migration.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EU is leading global efforts to fight climate change. It is actively working with other countries and regions to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global warming to well below 2 Â°C above pre-industrial levels, and it is making efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 Â°C.\n\nThe EU is committed to becoming climate neutral by 2050 and has set the target of cutting net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % below 1990 levels by 2030. The first European climate law will set these goals in stone, while the ambitious package of measures that make up the European Green Deal will enable European citizens and businesses to benefit from a sustainable green transition that leaves no one behind.\n\nThis transition requires action by all parts of the economy and society. Individuals and communities can play their part through the European Climate Pact, which invites everyone to participate in building a greener Europe.\n\nThe EUâs strategy to adapt to climate change promotes measures such as building flood defences, developing drought-tolerant crops and changing building regulations, and supports international action for climate resilience.\n\nFailure to address climate change would be very costly for the EU and the rest of the world. At the same time, the growing demand for clean technologies presents opportunities for innovation, industrial modernisation and green jobs and growth. The European Green Deal represents the growth strategy through which these opportunities will be harnessed. Climate action is a part of all the main EU spending programmes, with at least 30 % of the budget for 2021-2027 dedicated to climate-related initiatives.\n\nThe EU has a comprehensive set of measures in place to reduce emissions from all sectors of the economy. The EU emissions trading system cuts emissions from industry, power plants and aviation within Europe in a cost-effective way. EU Member States have also agreed national targets for reducing emissions in other sectors, such as transport, construction and agriculture.\n\nFind out more: https://ec.europa.eu/clima/\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe EU has some of the worldâs highest environmental standards, which protect nature and peopleâs quality of life, green the economy and ensure careful use of natural resources.\n\nHowever, we are currently facing major global challenges, which include climate change, biodiversity loss and resource scarcity. Meeting these challenges is urgent and will need a deep and fast transformation of our society, the way we live and the way we produce and consume. The EUâs recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic must be green, it must make Europe more resilient and it must be fair and inclusive for all.\n\nEU environment policy plays a crucial role in supporting the European Green Deal in accelerating the transition to a climate-neutral, resource-efficient and regenerative economy that gives back to the planet more than it takes.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EU is striving to reduce the environmental impacts of the production and consumption of goods and services. Becoming a circular economy, in which the value of products and materials lasts for as long as possible and waste and resource use is minimised, is essential to achieving the EUâs target of reaching climate neutrality by 2050 and halting biodiversity loss.\n\nThe new Circular Economy Action Plan, one of the main blocks of the Green Deal, aims to make sustainable products the norm in the EU. It focuses on areas with the most potential such as electronics, batteries and vehicles, textiles, construction and food. Under the plan, the plastics strategy aims to make all plastic packaging in the EU reusable or recyclable by 2030, while new rules target single-use plastics.\n\nThe EU must safeguard natural resources and halt the decline of endangered species and habitats. The EUâs biodiversity strategy will expand protected areas on land and at sea, plant billions of trees and encourage sustainable farming practices, among other initiatives. It will build on its existing Natura 2000 network of protected natural areas across the EU where sustainable human activities can coexist with rare and vulnerable species and habitats.\n\nTo protect people from environment-related pressures and risks to health, the EU aims to guarantee safe drinking water and clean bathing water, improve air quality, reduce noise and reduce or eliminate the effects of harmful chemicals.\n\nThe EU also plays a leading role in international efforts to promote sustainable development. Environmental challenges do not stop at borders. More action is needed globally to ensure clean air, oceans and other water resources and to ensure that land and ecosystems are used sustainably and that climate change is kept to manageable levels. Environmental standards are upheld through the EUâs trade deals with other countries.\n\nEnergy\n\nThe EUâs energy policy aims to ensure a secure, competitive and affordable supply of energy, while meeting our climate targets.\n\nEurope faces a number of major energy challenges. In addition to ensuring secure energy supplies at reasonable prices for everyone, the EU must shift from a fossil-based economy towards a cleaner, carbon-neutral system.\n\nTo make this transition, the EU needs to become more energy efficient, scale up renewable energy, embrace innovation and new technologies, improve cross-border energy connections and reduce dependence on energy imports.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nEach Member State defines its own energy mix, but the coordination of rules at the EU level allows them to meet common political objectives.\n\nClimate and energy are inextricably linked. Energy accounts for 75 % of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. To achieve its goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050, the EU is seeking to completely redefine its energy system.\n\nThe Energy Union will deliver this transformation by coordinating with other policy areas such as transport, research and innovation, digitalisation, the circular economy and sustainable financing.\n\nThe clean energy for all Europeans legislative package will help to speed up the clean energy transition and deliver on the EUâs Paris Agreement commitments.\n\nThe decarbonisation of the power sector through renewable energy is one of the key elements of the European Green Deal. Offshore renewable energy is among the technologies with the greatest potential. In addition, the EU is taking steps to improve energy efficiency, including by renovating millions of Europeâs buildings and through ecodesign and energy labels.\n\nThe proposed EU strategies for energy system integration and hydrogen pave the way towards a fully decarbonised, more efficient, flexible and interconnected energy sector. In addition, the Commission is looking at new challenges such as decarbonising the gas sector, for example, by reducing methane emissions.\n\nTackling these challenges at the EU level also provides new opportunities for growth, jobs, research, and a more competitive and sustainable energy market. Consumers should also benefit significantly in terms of their rights to change energy suppliers, and, ultimately, lower household bills and less air pollution. Some additional policies and measures that help ensure that the EU meets its goals include:\n\nnew cross-border networks for gas and electricity, including projects to better integrate renewables into the grid;\n\nmeasures to step up efforts on batteries, including the creation of the European Battery Alliance to build up battery technology and production capacity in the EU;\n\nthe initiative for coal regions in transition towards clean energy sources, leaving no one behind;\n\ncontributing to the ITER international fusion project, one of the worldâs most ambitious energy projects.\n\nTransport and travel\n\nThe EUâs transport policy helps keep the economy moving by developing modern infrastructure that makes journeys quicker and safer, all while promoting sustainable and digital solutions.\n\nEurope needs efficient transport connections to drive business, growth and employment, for tourism and leisure, and to keep people connected. Transport is a major contributor to the economy, directly employing around 10 million people. The EUâs transport policy focuses on creating a crisis-proof single European area with cleaner and greener transport and fair competition.\n\nThe Re-open EU platform provides practical information on COVID-19 and national coronavirus safety and travel measures, such as quarantine and testing requirements in the Member States.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThanks to the EU, the last 20 years have seen considerable progress in Europeâs transport sector, with safer skies, seas and roads, better working conditions for transport workers, more and cheaper mobility options and fast progress towards cleaner and digital solutions.\n\nTransport accounts for a quarter of the EUâs greenhouse gas emissions and the European Green Deal aims to reduce them by 90 % by 2050. Achieving more sustainable and smart mobility means providing more affordable, more accessible, healthier and cleaner alternatives. A key objective is to boost the uptake of clean vehicles and alternative fuels and strengthen the role of sustainable transport modes, such as rail. In 2021, the European Year of Rail shone a light on the benefits of rail as a sustainable, smart and safe means of transport.\n\nImproving efficiency is crucial. Digital technologies enabling automated mobility and smart traffic management systems, for example, will help with efficiency while also making transport cleaner.\n\nFunded through the Connecting Europe Facility, with a budget of over â¬25.8 billion, the EUâs transport infrastructure policy aims to connect the whole continent. This includes bridging gaps between national transport networks and supporting investments in cross-border connections. It also prioritises environmentally friendly modes such as rail and the development of infrastructure for vehicles using alternative fuels.\n\nTransport is the backbone of the single market, keeping the EUâs economy moving. By building a single European market in aviation and advancing on the Single European Sky initiative, flying continues to become easier and cheaper. Licensed rail companies can now offer their services anywhere in the EU and shipping companies can operate in more countries.\n\nSafety and security are paramount. While there is progress in the right direction, around 18 800 people still lost their lives in road accidents in 2020. This is why the EU actively works to improve road safety. EU transport policy also helps travellers in other ways: air, rail, ship and bus passengers travelling in the EU have rights when they experience delays or cancellations.\n\nFood and farming\n\nThe common agricultural policy ensures a stable food supply produced in a sustainable way and at affordable prices for the EUâs 447 million consumers. It also helps tackle climate change, manage our natural resources and support jobs and growth in rural areas.\n\nThe common agricultural policy (CAP) is applied in all EU countries and is funded from the EU budget. It supports the EUâs vital food and farming sector, which provides nearly 40 million jobs.\n\nCrises such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic are a reminder that our food system is under threat and must become more resilient. A healthier and more sustainable EU food system is a cornerstone of the European Green Deal.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe CAP provides support through the following.\n\nDirect payments that support farm incomes. These offset the risks and uncertainties associated with farming and are allocated on the condition that strict food safety, environmental and animal health and welfare rules are followed.\n\nMarket measures to deal with difficult situations, such as a sudden drop in demand due to a health scare or a fall in prices due to temporary oversupply.\n\nRural development programmes (co-financed by EU countries) that foster innovation and competitiveness to make rural areas attractive places in which to live and work.\n\nIn 2019, the EU supported farmers to the tune of â¬57.98 billion, with income support comprising nearly three quarters of the total amount.\n\nProposals for the future CAP seek to shift the emphasis from rules and compliance to performance and results. They aim to foster a sustainable and competitive agriculture sector that can contribute to the goals of the European Green Deal. Farmers, agri-food businesses, foresters and rural communities have an essential role to play on many issues. One such issue is the Farm to Fork strategy that aims to protect the environment through sustainable food production and consumption. The strategy aims to promote healthy food for everyone and prevent food loss and waste, while ensuring farmersâ livelihoods. The future CAP is closely linked to the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and is due to be implemented from 1 January 2023, pending final agreement between the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.\n\nThe EUâs General Food Law aims to protect peopleâs health and consumer interests, while ensuring the single market works efficiently. The European Food Safety Authority advises on food-related issues to protect people, animals, plants and the environment. The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed helps ensure that food that does not comply with European rules is removed from the shelves. Whenever significant outbreaks of animal disease or food poisoning occur, EU authorities can follow the movement of food products via the TRACES system.\n\nOceans and fisheries\n\nOur oceans produce most of the oxygen we breathe, regulate our weather and climate and are home to the majority of the planetâs species. They are also important drivers of the European economy, providing us with food, jobs, transport and recreation. The EU works to protect our seas and oceans and to ensure that they remain environmentally and economically sustainable for future generations.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nWith a turnover of â¬650 billion in 2018, and employing close to 4.5 million people, the EUâs âblueâ economy sector is in good health. The EUâs Sustainable Blue Economy strategy seeks to harness the potential for sustainable growth in the marine and maritime sectors as a whole.\n\nThanks to research and innovation, the seas and oceans are a source of renewable energy, minerals and pharmaceuticals. The EU is in a unique position to develop offshore renewable energy thanks to the number and variety of its sea basins and the steadily falling costs of new installations. Proposals to maximise this potential will help the EU to meet its goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050.\n\nWhile nurturing these new opportunities, the EU also plays an important role in promoting the responsible and sustainable exploitation of seas, both in Europe and globally.\n\nThe EUâs common fisheries policy aims to ensure that fishing and aquaculture (farming fish under controlled conditions) are environmentally, economically and socially sustainable. Its goals are to foster a dynamic and sustainable fishing industry, conserve resources and protect the marine environment, while ensuring a fair standard of living for fishing communities. It contains a set of rules for managing European fishing fleets and for conserving fish stocks. To prevent overfishing, quotas for EU Member States set limits on how much of each species can be caught, while a landing obligation avoids the wasteful practice of dumping unwanted fish.\n\nThe EU has introduced protected areas to safeguard marine ecosystems and their biodiversity, along with the services they provide, and aims to protect at least 30 % of the EUâs seas by 2030. In addition, EU rules to tackle marine litter reduce the negative impacts of the 10 single-use plastic products most often found on Europeâs beaches and seas, along with lost and abandoned fishing gear.\n\nThe EUâs common fisheries policy and maritime policy will be financed through the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund. Pending its final approval, this fund will provide over â¬6.1 billion (2021â2027) for sustainable development in the sector, with a particular focus on supporting small-scale coastal fisheries.\n\nEconomy, finance and the euro\n\nThe Economic and Monetary Union provides a common foundation for stability, jobs and growth across the EU.\n\nThe Economic and Monetary Union binds the EUâs economies together through coordinated economic and fiscal policies, harmonised rules for financial institutions, a common monetary policy and a common currency, the euro. It is a powerful tool to deliver jobs, growth, social fairness and financial stability. However, while there have been important institutional reforms to strengthen the Economic and Monetary Union in recent years, it remains a work in progress.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EUâs economic and financial policies aim to:\n\ncreate jobs and boost investment;\n\npromote economic stability;\n\nimprove the efficient functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union;\n\nregulate financial institutions and complex financial products;\n\npreserve financial stability and protect taxpayers in financial crises;\n\nstrengthen the international role of the euro.\n\nWhile all 27 Member States are a part of the Economic and Monetary Union, many have taken their integration further and adopted the euro as their currency. Together, these countries make up the euro area. Today, the euro is used by more than 340 million people in 19 Member States. Euro notes and coins are a tangible symbol of the freedom, convenience and opportunities that the EU makes possible.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the EU took action to address some of the institutional weaknesses the crisis exposed in the Economic and Monetary Union and create a safer financial sector. The EU has strengthened economic governance, designed a system to safeguard financial stability in the euro area, improved Member Statesâ public finances and promoted reforms to encourage investment. Moreover, the EU put in place harmonised rules to increase the resilience of EU financial institutions and strengthen supervision of banks in the euro area.\n\nThe strong foundations provided by the Economic and Monetary Union have helped Member States weather the unprecedented economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic highlighted the necessity of responding to crises quickly, decisively and in a coordinated manner. The EU responded by allowing Member States to depart from their normal budgetary requirements, creating the â¬100 billion SURE initiative to help protect jobs and workers and launching the unprecedented â¬723.8 billion (current prices) Recovery and Resilience Facility, the centrepiece of NextGenerationEU. The facility is financing the investments and reforms contained in the recovery and resilience plans prepared by Member States. These measures will support the green and digital transitions while helping EU countries to emerge stronger from the pandemic.\n\nEmployment and social affairs\n\nThe EU contributes to the creation of more and better jobs across Europe and aims for fair social standards for all, including through the â¬99.3 billion European Social Fund Plus for the 2021â2027 period.\n\nResponsibility for employment policies and social affairs is shared between the EU and its Member States. The Commission has made jobs, growth and investment a top priority, backed up by NextGenerationEU, the EUâs recovery plan to tackle the social and economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EUâs employment and social affairs policies are designed to:\n\ncreate quality jobs throughout the EU;\n\nhelp workers to find employment in their own or another Member State;\n\npromote skills and entrepreneurship;\n\ncoordinate and modernise social security schemes;\n\ncreate better working conditions through common minimum standards;\n\nsupport social inclusion and combat poverty and homelessness;\n\nprotect the rights of people with disabilities.\n\nThe EU provides and coordinates funding to help Member States to invest in areas like childcare, healthcare, training, accessible infrastructure and help with finding a job. The European Social Fund Plus will help millions of people to acquire new skills, in particular those required for the green and digital transitions, and find better jobs. The Youth Guarantee helps ensure that all people under 30 receive a good quality and concrete offer of a job, apprenticeship, traineeship or continued education within 4 months of leaving formal education or becoming unemployed. Meanwhile, the new aim, learn, master, achieve (ALMA) initiative aims to help disadvantaged young people who are vulnerable as regards their chances of accessing work or training for individual or structural reasons.\n\nThe European Skills Agenda is designed to help individuals and businesses develop more and better skills, and sets ambitious objectives to be achieved by 2025.\n\nThe European Pillar of Social Rights enshrines principles and rights in the areas of equal opportunities on the labour market, fair working conditions and social protection. An action plan to turn the principles into reality sets key targets for employment, training, and social protection and inclusion to be reached by 2030.\n\nEU rules on social security coordination do not replace national systems but protect the social security rights of people when they move within the EU (and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland). The European Labour Authority ensures that EU rules on labour mobility are enforced in a fair, simple and effective way. EURES, the European job mobility portal, helps connect jobseekers and companies offering a job, while the Europass service helps people build their CVs.\n\nJobs, growth and investment\n\nThe EU is committed to creating a more attractive investment environment that will drive economic growth and create jobs. It aims to do this by removing barriers to investment and ensuring that EU citizens are equipped with the skills needed for the jobs of the future.\n\nThe EU is addressing the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, while working to help EU citizens successfully navigate the green and digital transitions. It aims to ensure that the transformation of the EUâs economy is fair and inclusive so that every citizen can reap the benefits offered by the twin transitions and to make sure no one is left behind.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe InvestEU programme is an important element of the EUâs recovery plan to tackle the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and achieve the EUâs long-term priorities. It builds on the success of the investment plan for Europe, which mobilised more than â¬500 billion between 2015 and 2020 to help close the gap in investment caused by the 2007â2008 financial crisis. To help investment recover even further, InvestEU provides an EU budget guarantee to help businesses in the EU access and attract the funding they need. It aims to trigger at least â¬372 billion in additional investment between 2021 and 2027. The programme focuses on four key policy areas:\n\nsustainable infrastructure,\n\nresearch, innovation and digitisation,\n\nsmall and medium-sized businesses, and\n\nsocial investment and skills.\n\nTo complement the programme, the InvestEU advisory hub will act as a one-stop shop for the identification, preparation and development of investment projects across the EU.\n\nThe rapid shift towards a climate neutral and digital Europe is changing the way we work. The European Skills Agenda is already helping to address this challenge and sets objectives to be achieved by 2025. It puts into practice key principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights, which aims to create a fair and inclusive European labour market. To ensure concrete benefits for citizens, key targets for employment, training, and social protection and inclusion have been set for 2030.\n\nThe Just Transition Mechanism, the Recovery and Resilience Facility and, in the future, the proposed Social Climate Fund will provide support to reduce regional and social disparities. The Commission is also working to identify concrete measures and solutions for Europeâs demographic challenges, so as to support people, regions and communities that are most affected.\n\nRegions\n\nRegional policy targets all regions and cities in the EU in order to support job creation, business competitiveness, economic growth and sustainable development, and to improve citizensâ quality of life.\n\nModernising the airports of Riga and WrocÅaw; improving urban mobility in Athens, Sofia and Cluj-Napoca; preserving Mont Saint-Michel and safeguarding Pompeii; developing broadband infrastructure across Lithuania; supporting businesses in Utrecht and Paredes; renewing wastewater treatment in TrenÄÃ­n and Slavonski Brod; and promoting the use of information technologies in universities in Nicosia and Ljubljana â these are just some examples of the thousands of projects co-funded by the EUâs regional policy.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nRegional policy underpins European solidarity, boosting economic growth and improving quality of life through strategic investment. It dedicates the bulk of its funding to help the EUâs less-developed countries and regions to catch up and to therefore reduce the economic, social and territorial disparities that still exist in the EU.\n\nRegional policy is jointly managed by the Commission and the EU Member States and their regions, which choose the projects that will be co-financed by the EU under programmes agreed on in advance with the Commission. EU funds are always topped up with national (private and/or public) funds.\n\nThrough the European territorial cooperation (Interreg) programmes, regional policy pays particular attention to the needs and potential of border regions.\n\nAlmost a third (â¬392 billion) of the EUâs 2021â2027 budget has been set aside for regional policy. These resources are used to finance strategic transport and communication infrastructures; to favour a transition to a more environmentally friendly economy; to help small and medium-sized enterprises to become more innovative and more competitive; to create new and lasting job opportunities; to reinforce and modernise education systems; and to build a more inclusive society.\n\nIn addition, under NextGenerationEU, the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU) will provide more than â¬50 billion of fresh resources to existing programmes in the Member States until 2023 to support the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTo achieve the EUâs goal of becoming the first climate-neutral continent, the Just Transition Mechanism will help mobilise around â¬55 billion between 2021 and 2027 to support regions most affected by the shift to a climate-neutral economy. The proposed Social Climate Fund also aims to help Member States support the transition to climate neutrality for people most reliant on fossil fuels.\n\nResearch and innovation\n\nThe â¬95.5 billion research and innovation programme Horizon Europe is helping to boost jobs and growth and tackle some of our biggest challenges.\n\nResearch and innovation are essential to our economy and society. They are at the heart of European efforts to create jobs and boost growth and investment, and help make peopleâs lives better through improvements in areas such as healthcare, transport and energy. They also provide us with the knowledge and solutions to tackle both urgent problems such the COVID-19 pandemic and longer-term challenges such as climate change and the fight against cancer.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EU is the worldâs biggest knowledge factory, accounting for almost a third of global science and technology production. However, in the face of increasing competition, the EU must keep turning excellent research and innovative ideas into successful technologies and products. All EU Member States have their own research policies and funding programmes, but many important issues can be best tackled by helping researchers and innovators in different countries to work together. This is why research and innovation is supported at the EU level, in particular through the Horizon Europe programme.\n\nHorizon Europe is one of the largest and most ambitious research programmes in the world, investing â¬95.5 billion of funding (2021â2027), in addition to the other public and private investment that this money attracts. Building on the achievements of the Horizon 2020 programme, it continues to drive Europeâs scientific excellence through the European Research Council and the Marie SkÅodowska-Curie fellowships and exchanges. It also draws on the scientific advice, technical support and dedicated research of the Commissionâs science and knowledge service, the Joint Research Centre.\n\nHorizon Europe has established a series of EU missions â a new way of working together to tackle big challenges in health, climate and the environment. Each of the five missions work as a set of actions to achieve concrete results by 2030.\n\nHorizon Europe also supports European partnerships, which bring the EU, national authorities and the private sector together to address some of Europeâs most pressing challenges through concerted research and innovation initiatives. They will help strengthen the new European research area, which aims to create a single EU market for research, innovation and technology and enables countries to be more effective by aligning their research policies and programmes.\n\nMandatory open access to publications and open science principles are applied throughout the Horizon Europe programme.\n\nSingle market\n\nThe single market is one of the EUâs greatest achievements. For 30 years it has helped to make everyday life easier for citizens and businesses, allowing goods, services, people and money to move freely around the EU.\n\nThanks to the single market (sometimes also called the internal market) EU citizens can study, live, shop, work and retire in any EU Member State and enjoy products from all over Europe. Companies are able to expand their operations, while competition helps to bring prices down and give consumers more choice. At the same time, the EU works to ensure that these greater freedoms do not undermine fairness, consumer protection, workersâ rights or environmental sustainability.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nUnderpinned by the EUâs industrial strategy, the single market plays an essential role in supporting businesses on the path to the green and digital transitions. It also helps shield companies from supply shocks and crises while strengthening their global competitiveness.\n\nThe EU is working to:\n\nbuild on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, for example, by addressing supply chain disruptions;\n\nensure the single market creates more opportunities for companies and entrepreneurs to expand their businesses;\n\ntackle obstacles that prevent people from easily buying or selling goods and services from or in another Member State and workers from moving freely;\n\nmake sure the same rules on fairness, opportunities and obligations also apply to the digital economy;\n\nimprove reskilling and upskilling across industrial sectors;\n\nensure access to finance, standards and patents to build, scale and protect European leadership in innovative technologies.\n\nNew industrial alliances in key areas where the EU is dependent on non-EU countries play a key role in achieving its goals. As part of these efforts, the EU has presented new measures to improve the shift to a circular economy and to secure a more sustainable supply of critical raw materials.\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises, which make up 99 % of all companies in the EU, provide two-thirds of total private-sector employment. EU policies encourage the creation of new businesses and support innovative enterprises in their efforts to scale up.\n\nWith a budget of â¬4.2 billion for 2021 to 2027, the Single Market Programme consolidates a wide range of activities in areas such as food safety, consumer protection, standardisation and competitiveness, reducing overlaps and improving coordination.\n\nThe Your Europe portal contains information on living, working, travelling, studying and doing business in another Member State. It also offers access to services such as Your Europe Advice and the SOLVIT problem-solving network.\n\nConsumer protection\n\nEU consumer policy safeguards consumersâ rights, ensures products are safe, helps people make informed choices when they buy goods and services and offers tools to solve problems if something goes wrong.\n\nThe EU single market offers consumers access to greater choice, flexibility, quality and value for money. EU consumer policy ensures that peopleâs rights will be upheld if they encounter any problems when buying goods or services from other Member States, building trust and encouraging trade, including online.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe New Consumer Agenda sets out the EUâs strategy up until 2025. It outlines the measures that the EU will take to respond to new challenges such as COVID-19 and the green and digital transitions. These include addressing environmental and sustainability concerns, enforcing consumer rights and protecting vulnerable consumers.\n\nThe EU offers consumers a set of practical rights when something goes wrong.\n\nOnline shoppers have 14 days to reconsider their purchase and withdraw. They may return a product within 2 weeks and get their money back.\n\nIf an item bought in the EU (online or in a shop) is not as advertised or does not work properly, the consumer has the right to at least a free repair or replacement.\n\nEU rules on mortgage credits ensure clear information in advertisements and timely information to consumers before signing a contract.\n\nThere are minimum standards for passenger rights across all modes of transport, including information, assistance and compensation in the event of cancellations or long delays.\n\nThe EU also provides help to resolve disputes with traders quickly and efficiently. The online dispute resolution platform allows consumers and traders to resolve disputes over online purchases. The European Consumer Centres Network provides free help and advice to consumers on their cross-border purchases. New EU rules will, by mid 2023 at the latest, make it easier for organisations to defend the collective interests of consumers and bring actions to court.\n\nStringent safety, health and environmental standards apply to toys, electrical appliances, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Strict rules ensure that unsafe products are recalled from the market, with hundreds of products notified via the EUâs rapid alert system for dangerous non-food products every year. In 2021, the Commission proposed to revise rules on product safety, including new rules for online marketplaces, along with a revision of EU rules on consumer credit.\n\nThe EUâs Circular Economy Action Plan aligns consumer and environmental rights, focusing on higher quality, longer lasting, sustainable products.\n\nFair competition\n\nEU competition rules aim to ensure that all companies compete fairly and equally in the single market to the benefit of consumers, businesses and the European economy as a whole.\n\nTogether with national competition authorities and national courts, the Commission enforces EU competition rules to make sure that companies compete fairly with each other. This helps to reduce prices and improve quality, encourages innovation and efficiency and creates a wider choice for consumers.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe Commission takes action in regard to:\n\ncartels or other illegal arrangements between companies to avoid competing with each other or that set artificially high prices;\n\ncases where major players abuse their dominant position in markets to try to squeeze out competitors or charge excessive prices;\n\ncompany mergers and takeovers that could restrict competition in the single market;\n\nfinancial support (State aid) from EU governments to companies, which may distort competition in the single market by favouring some companies over others; and\n\npromoting competition culture internationally so that EU companies enjoy fair competition in markets elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe enforcement of competition policy benefits EU citizens. For example, in 2020, conservative estimates by the Commission put customer savings from cartel prohibitions and merger interventions at between â¬14 billion and â¬23.3 billion.\n\nEU investigations into anti-competitive practices cover goods, professions and services. The Commission monitors the assistance EU governments give to businesses to ensure that it does not give certain companies an unfair advantage over their competitors. State aid may be allowed if it helps or promotes disadvantaged regions, small and medium-sized businesses, research and development, environmental protection, training, employment or culture.\n\nNew rules on State aid introduced in January 2022 align with the EUâs important objectives under the European Green Deal. They aim to help EU Member States meet their ambitious EU energy and climate targets, supporting projects for environmental protection, including climate protection and green energy generation.\n\nThe EU is also working to ensure its legislation keeps pace with the digital transformation. The Digital Markets Act, for example, will prevent online platforms that act as gatekeepers from imposing unfair conditions on businesses and consumers through a clear list of dos and donâts. Meanwhile the Digital Services Act will impose binding EU-wide obligations on intermediaries providing digital services that connect consumers to goods, services or content, making it easier for smaller platforms to scale up across the EU single market.\n\nTax and customs\n\nWhile national governments independently set and collect taxes, the EU is responsible for a customs union that ensures the free movement and safety of goods in the single market.\n\nEU Member State governments are broadly free to design their tax laws according to their national priorities. However, in doing so, they must respect certain fundamental principles and ensure that national tax rules do not hinder the EUâs single market.\n\nThe EU customs union makes it easier for companies to trade, harmonises customs duties on goods from outside the EU and helps protect EU citizens and the environment.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EU does not have a direct role in raising or setting tax rates, rather it oversees national tax rules to ensure they promote jobs and growth and to ensure that one countryâs taxes do not discriminate against consumers, workers or businesses from other Member States.\n\nThe governments of all Member States must agree when it comes to making EU decisions so that everyoneâs interests are taken into account. For some taxes â such as value added tax or excise duties on petrol, tobacco and alcohol â Member States have agreed common rules to simplify online and offline cross-border commerce and ensure a level playing field between EU and non-EU companies and platforms.\n\nIn 2021, the Commission set out its vision for a new, fairer and more transparent EU business tax system for the 21st century. It includes actions to cut red tape, support small businesses and fight tax abuse. With its proposal for a minimum corporation tax rate of at least 15 % for all multinational companies, the Commission aims to make the EU among the first to implement the 2021 historic global tax reform agreement. This should ultimately ensure that all companies are taxed fairly, wherever they do business.\n\nTo ensure a level playing field across the single market, the EU must function as a single customs union, with the same tariffs, standards and procedures to handle goods imported from abroad. No customs duties are applied to goods that are transported from one Member State to another.\n\nIn practice, the EUâs customs union is managed by the national customs services. They protect consumers, animals and the environment from goods that could be harmful, and they contribute to the fight against organised crime, terrorism and smuggling. Once goods have cleared customs, they can circulate freely or be sold anywhere within Europe.\n\nSpace\n\nThe EUâs space policy actively contributes to fighting climate change, stimulates technological advances and innovation, and improves the lives of EU citizens.\n\nSpace technology, data and services are essential to the daily lives of Europeans (e.g. for using mobile phones, car navigation systems and automated teller machines (ATMs)). Satellites also provide valuable data and services for a wide array of applications, from transport, agriculture and the environment to crisis response.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EU has a competitive and growing space industry â estimated to be worth up to â¬62 billion â that employs more than 230 000 people and is responsible for one third of all satellites currently in orbit.\n\nThe following flagship components deliver European space-based services on a daily basis.\n\nCopernicus is the EUâs Earth-observation system. The data generated by its satellites is used in many areas, from monitoring climate change and its effects to directing emergency and humanitarian services. Copernicus data has been used to locate vessels in distress and to respond to forest fires, earthquakes and floods, helping save lives and property.\n\nGalileo, the EUâs global satellite navigation system, provides accurate and reliable positioning and timing information for all modes of transport, vehicles, railways, aviation and other sectors. Thanks to Galileo, 3.2 billion smartphones are equipped with a safe and independent positioning system.\n\nThe European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) monitors and corrects satellite navigation signals for aviation, maritime and land-based users over most of Europe. 426 airports in the EU are already using EGNOS to make landings in adverse weather conditions safer, avoiding delays and rerouting.\n\nThe 2021â2027 EU space programme, with a budget of â¬14.9 billion, builds on their success with a focus on more coordination with other EU policy areas. It aims to encourage scientific and technical progress and support the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the European space industry, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, start-ups and innovative businesses. The Commission has also proposed two new flagship initiatives to boost satellite-based secure connectivity and space traffic management.\n\nThrough individual EU Member States and the European Space Agency, the EU has developed world-class technology in space exploration. Achievements include the development of new rockets and satellites and robot explorers on the Moon and Mars. While space exploration is strategically and politically important, the EU is also helping scientists to unlock the secrets of the universe; in 2019 EU-funded researchers unveiled the first-ever photograph of a black hole.\n\nInternational affairs and security\n\nThe common foreign and security policy enables the EU to speak and act as one in world affairs, allowing Member States to tackle challenges they cannot solve alone and ensuring the security and prosperity of EU citizens.\n\nThe policy is implemented by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and supported by the European External Action Service, the EUâs diplomatic service. The EUâs external actions are guided by the principles that inspired its own creation and development, and which it seeks to promote in the wider world, including peace, democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nAt a time of increasing and complex security threats, the EU Strategic Compass on security and defence will strengthen the EUâs ability to react to crises and threats over the coming decade. The Strategic Compass focuses on:\n\nacting more quickly and decisively when a crisis happens;\n\nsecuring citizens against fast-changing threats;\n\ninvesting in the capabilities and technologies the EU needs;\n\npartnering with others to achieve common goals.\n\nThe EU supports countries facing conflicts and crises. With the European Peace Facility, the EU is taking on more responsibility as a global security provider. The facility funds the common costs of military missions and operations under the common security and defence policy and peace support operations in cooperation with partners such as the African Union. It also strengthens the defence capacities of partner countries and regional and international organisations and has been instrumental in supporting Ukraine in its response to Russiaâs military aggression.\n\nSince Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU has also taken steps to ensure that global food security is restored through international cooperation.\n\nThe EU and its Member States have remained the largest donors in the international response to the Syria crisis, supporting people in Syria and the region through investment totalling more than â¬27 billion since 2011.\n\nThe Global Gateway is the EUâs new investment strategy to boost smart, clean and secure energy, transport and digital infrastructure, and strengthen health, education and research systems across the world. The EU, its Member States and its financial institutions, acting together as Team Europe, aim to mobilise up to â¬300 billion in public and private investment between 2021 and 2027. The Global Gateway is the EUâs contribution to the G7âs Global Partnership for Infrastructure and Investment.\n\nInternational partnerships\n\nPartnerships and development cooperation lie at the heart of the EUâs foreign policy. The EU and its Member States are the worldâs largest provider of development aid.\n\nDevelopment assistance is one of the pillars of the EUâs action around the world, alongside foreign, security and trade policies. The EU promotes poverty eradication, human development, sustainable growth and good governance. It does this by creating partnerships to address global challenges such as climate change, natural resources depletion and irregular migration. The EU upholds effective multilateralism and works with all stakeholders, since current challenges call for more multilateral governance and rules-based international cooperation.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EU sees international partnerships as an investment in a viable, sustainable and shared future. The EU is a leading advocate of the UNâs 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the Paris Agreement on climate change. The European consensus on development sets out how the EU focuses on people, the planet, prosperity, peace and partnership in working towards the sustainable development goals. The EU structures its external action around:\n\ngreen deal alliances;\n\nalliances for science, technology, innovation and the digital transition;\n\nalliances for sustainable growth and jobs, including through investment in education and skills;\n\nmigration partnerships;\n\ngovernance, peace and security, and human development, with a particular focus on women and youth.\n\nThe AfricaâEU partnership remains a key priority for the EU.\n\nIn 2020, the EU responded quickly to the COVID-19 crisis. The Team Europe approach, which combines resources, expertise and tools from the EU, its Member States and financial institutions, has helped the EUâs partners mitigate the impact of the pandemic. The EU is also leading the charge to make safe and effective vaccines accessible to all. The Team Europe approach is now being applied in the EUâs budget for external action: the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument â Global Europe.\n\nThe EU dedicates around 10 % of its budget to external action. The EUâs delegations work hand in hand with governments, international organisations, EU Member States and the private sector to increase the impact of Europeâs support. Collectively, the EU and its Member States provided â¬66.8 billion of aid in 2020.\n\nThe values of respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law guide the EUâs action around the world. The EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy focuses on protecting and empowering individuals, building resilient, inclusive and democratic societies and promoting human rights worldwide. Thanks to the Gender Action Plan, gender equality and womenâs empowerment are at the forefront of the EUâs work.\n\nEU neighbourhood and enlargement\n\nThe EU encourages stable democracies and economies in neighbouring countries by building tailor-made partnerships based on shared interests and cooperation at bilateral or regional level.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nEuropean Neighbourhood policy governs the EUâs relations with 16 of its closest neighbours. To the south: Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine*, Syria and Tunisia. To the east: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.\n\nThis cooperation aims mainly to:\n\nstabilise neighbouring countries by addressing economic development, employment and opportunities for young people, transport and energy connectivity, security and migration;\n\npromote the values of good governance, democracy, the rule of law and human rights;\n\nfacilitate cooperation at regional level, for example through the Eastern Partnership and the Union for the Mediterranean.\n\nIn addition, in the Southern Neighbourhood the EU works alongside its partners to resolve crises such as in Syria or Libya, and to regulate migration flows.\n\nEU Enlargement policy covers Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo**, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and TÃ¼rkiye. The prospect of EU membership is a powerful stimulus for democratic and economic reforms in European countries that want to join the EU. It helps to foster reconciliation and stability. A European country can only become an EU Member State if it meets democratic standards (including the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities), has a functioning market economy and the capacity to cope with competition and market forces in the EU, and can take on the responsibilities of EU membership.\n\nTÃ¼rkiye is the EUâs partner in many essential areas, however, in recent years it has been moving further away from the EUâs core values and principles. Therefore, TÃ¼rkiyeâs accession negotiations are effectively frozen. The EU has a strategic interest in a stable and secure environment in the eastern Mediterranean and in the development of a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with TÃ¼rkiye.\n\nIn 2020, the EU provided aid worth â¬7.47 billion to neighbourhood and enlargement regions to help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The EU has provided emergency response, supported research, health and water systems and addressed the economic and social consequences of the pandemic.\n\nThis designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue.\n\nThis designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence.\n\nTrade\n\nThe EU champions free trade. 35 million EU jobs are, directly or indirectly, supported by trade with countries outside the EU. The EU fights for open, rules-based markets, a level playing field and the highest international standards across the world.\n\nThe EU is the worldâs largest trading power and one of the most open economies. A third of the EUâs gross domestic product depends on trade. 85 % of future global growth is forecast to come from outside Europe. The EU negotiates and agrees international trade agreements on behalf of its Member States.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EUâs trade policy covers trade in goods and services, but also in matters such as the commercial aspects of intellectual property and foreign direct investment.\n\nIn February 2021, the Commission presented a new EU trade strategy, which sets out three main objectives:\n\nsupporting the recovery and transformation of the EU economy in a way that supports our green and digital ambitions;\n\nshaping global rules to ensure that they are fair and sustainable;\n\nincreasing the EUâs ability to pursue its interests and enforce its rights.\n\nAt the heart of the strategy is a commitment to reforming the World Trade Organization so that it is better able to respond to the challenges of modern trade.\n\nTrade policy can play an important role in combating climate change and environmental degradation. Therefore the EU will improve the implementation and enforcement of sustainable development chapters in its trade agreements. Specifically, the EU will propose to make respect for the Paris Agreement on climate change an essential element in future trade and investment agreements.\n\nThe EU stands for open and fair trade and fights against protectionism. It strikes a balance between being open and ensuring that people and companies are defended against unfair trade practices. With the newly appointed Chief Trade Enforcement Officer, the EU is putting a specific focus on maximising the benefits of trade agreements for companies, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises and farmers, and on ensuring that its trade partners honour their commitments, including on sustainable development.\n\nThe EU has 46 trade agreements in force with 78 partners around the world. In 2020, the EU reached a new agreement on trade with Mexico, and its trade deal with Vietnam entered into force. In its first year, the agreement with Japan had already boosted EU exports, with almost 7 % growth in the first 10 months of the agreement.\n\nFollowing the United Kingdomâs departure from the EU on 31 January 2020, the EU and the United Kingdom signed the EUâUK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on 30 December 2020.\n\nHumanitarian aid and civil protection\n\nThe EU, together with its Member States, is among the worldâs leading donors of humanitarian aid. It provides critical relief to millions across the globe, and coordinates emergency assistance in Europe and worldwide.\n\nThe EU responds to crisis situations and ensures rapid and effective delivery of relief assistance through two main channels: humanitarian aid and civil protection. The EU aims to:\n\nsave and preserve life, prevent and alleviate suffering and safeguard the integrity and dignity of populations affected by natural disasters and human-made crises;\n\nprovide rapid response to emergencies both inside and outside the EU;\n\nreduce disaster risks, for example, through action to mitigate the consequences of climate change;\n\nimprove disaster preparedness, for instance, with early warning systems;\n\nensure a smooth transition when an emergency operation comes to an end, by linking up with development aid strategies;\n\nstrengthen the overall resilience of populations, for example, by investing in measures to help them prepare for future disasters; and\n\nprotect and ensure the future of children caught up in disasters.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nWorking with a diverse range of partners, the EU has been supporting humanitarian operations in 110 countries for over 30 years. The EU provided more than â¬2.4 billion in humanitarian aid in 2021. It is a leading humanitarian donor in many crises, for example, by providing:\n\nemergency assistance to support people fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine;\n\nhumanitarian assistance to refugees and internally displaced people in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen;\n\nemergency relief to displaced people inside Syria and refugees in neighbouring countries;\n\nlife-saving humanitarian projects and assistance in the worst affected communities in the Central African Republic and South Sudan;\n\nemergency assistance through the humanitarian air bridge in fragile and conflict-affected countries such as Afghanistan.\n\nThe EU also sends emergency response teams and channels aid to affected regions within the EU and across the globe through its Civil Protection Mechanism, for example, by:\n\nresponding to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and worldwide, including delivering COVID-19-related supplies via rescEU and repatriating EU citizens stranded abroad;\n\nsending experts and equipment to countries affected by earthquakes (Haiti), volcanic eruptions (Tonga), forest fires (the western Balkans and the Mediterranean) and to contain the outbreak of Ebola in Guinea in 2021;\n\nchannelling millions of emergency items (such as first aid kits, tents and beds) to Ukraine and neighbouring countries in the largest operation since the mechanism was created.\n\nFind out more: https://ec.europa.eu/echo/\n\nFundamental rights\n\nThe EU guarantees a range of fundamental rights. Respect for fundamental rights is a common value for the EU and its Member States, and guides the EUâs action both inside and outside its borders.\n\nThe EU is not simply a single market for goods and services. Europeans share values and rights set down in the EU treaties and in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EU Charter of Fundamental Rights brings together all the personal, civil, political, economic and social rights enjoyed by people in the EU. These rights are guaranteed in EU countries and wherever EU law is applied and include human dignity, freedom of expression and association, right to non-discrimination, right to asylum and the right to a fair trial.\n\nIn addition, the charter enshrines specific rights linked to EU citizenship under the EU treaties, by granting EU citizens:\n\nthe freedom to move, live, work and study in any EU country;\n\nthe right to vote and to stand as a candidate in local and EU elections;\n\nthe right to lodge a petition to the European Parliament;\n\nthe right to submit a complaint to the European Ombudsman;\n\nthe right to consular protection outside the EU.\n\nThe protection of fundamental rights is also ensured through specific EU laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation, legislation that aims to prevent discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation, and laws protecting whistle-blowers and victims of crime.\n\nThe EU also ensures the protection of fundamental rights through dedicated policy measures and close cooperation with EU countries and civil society, for instance, on hate crime and hate speech, gender equality and non-discrimination, civil and criminal justice, the digitalisation of justice, data protection, upholding the rule of law, rights of the child and consumer rights.\n\nThe EUâs legislative and policy work in the area of fundamental rights is supported by the Citizens Equality Rights and Values programme.\n\nThe EU is working to achieve a Union of equality through a set of strategies, which aim to challenge stereotypes and create conditions that ensure that everyone can participate fully and freely in European society.\n\nThe EU also promotes and defends universal values worldwide. In 2021, the EU launched the Global Human Rights and Democracy programme, worth â¬1.5 billion, from 2021 to 2027. The EU has also put in place a global human rights sanctions regime, which allows it to better target those responsible for serious violations globally.\n\nJustice and the rule of law\n\nThe EU works to ensure the uniform application of EU law, to solve cross-border legal problems for its citizens, and to promote and uphold the rule of law.\n\nThe EU strives to create an area of justice where citizens and businesses can resolve legal issues in other EU Member States in the same way as they can at home. A borderless and seamless common justice area will ensure that citizens can rely on a set of rights and can access justice throughout the EU.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nEU citizens can live, study, work and do business anywhere in the EU. This could mean having to deal with the judicial authorities of another Member State.\n\nThe EU seeks to strengthen mutual trust between the courts and administrations of the Member States so they recognise each otherâs judicial decisions. This is especially important in civil cases such as divorce, child custody or maintenance claims.\n\nThe European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) facilitates cooperation between national justice authorities to help fight serious crimes such as corruption, terrorism, and drug trafficking and distribution. The European Arrest Warrant, for example, has replaced lengthy extradition procedures to return suspected or convicted criminals back to the country where they will be or have been tried. Meanwhile, the EU strategy on victimsâ rights aims to ensure that all victims of crime in the EU have the support and protection they need.\n\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union ensures that EU law is applied in the same way in all Member States. The EU is working towards the modernisation of EU justice systems to keep pace with the digital transformation and ensure easier and faster access to justice. Progress can be tracked through the EU justice scoreboard, which provides data on the efficiency, quality and independence of the justice systems in all Member States, while the e-Justice portal offers a one-stop shop for all justice matters.\n\nThe rule of law â one of the fundamental values of the EU â means independent and efficient justice systems must offer adequate judicial protection to everyone in the EU. It is necessary to protect all other values and is essential to the functioning of the EU. It guarantees the application of EU law, the efficiency of the internal market and fosters mutual trust, enabling a business-friendly environment.\n\nThe EU works with Member States to uphold and strengthen the rule of law through the Rule of Law Mechanism and by providing technical support and funding for justice reforms.\n\nGender equality\n\nEquality between women and men is a fundamental value of the EU, dating back to the 1957 Treaty of Rome. The EU continues to work to tackle gender-based discrimination and to make gender equality a reality.\n\nAlthough women in Europe should enjoy equality, empowerment and safety, they are still over-represented in the lower-paid sectors, under-represented in decision-making positions in politics and business and earn on average 13 % less than men across the EU. Gender-based violence and harassment also remain widespread.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EUâs work on gender equality is driven by the 2020â2025 gender equality strategy. Its goal is to end gender-based violence, challenge gender stereotypes, close gender gaps in the labour market and promote gender balance in decision-making and in politics. The strategy builds on decades of EU initiatives on gender equality.\n\nTo enforce the principle of equal pay for equal work enshrined in the Treaty of Rome, the Commission has proposed pay transparency measures, including gender pay gap reporting obligations for big companies. Employees will also have the right to compensation for discrimination in pay.\n\nViolence against women is one of the most persistent forms of gender-based discrimination in Europe. The Commission has proposed new EU-wide rules to combat violence against women and domestic violence, which aim at punishing offenders and ensuring better protection of women, including online. All Member States and the EU have signed the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (the Istanbul Convention).\n\nThe EU is also working to help women break the glass ceiling in business and politics and to boost womenâs participation in the digital sector. In particular, the Commission is seeking to improve gender balance in company boards in the EUâs largest listed companies.\n\nBut life is not just about work and money. The workâlife balance directive, which entered into force in July 2019 and had to be transposed by Member States by August 2022, introduces new rights to help balance the sharing of care responsibilities between women and men. This covers paternity, parental and carersâ leave, along with flexible working arrangements for parents and carers.\n\nThe EU aims to improve the lives of girls and women worldwide through its Gender Action Plan III. This promotes gender equality issues in its external action, including in areas such as development cooperation and trade negotiations. The EU also led the way in negotiating the inclusion of gender equality targets in the UNâs 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nRacism and equality\n\nThe EU aims to ensure that everyone can enjoy their fundamental rights, freedoms and equal participation in society, irrespective of their origin.\n\nAlthough discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin is prohibited in the EU, racism and racial discrimination persist. The EU is working to combat racism and intolerance on all fronts.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EU is stepping up its efforts to tackle racism and discrimination through the 2020â2025 EU anti-racism action plan, and the appointment of the first ever coordinator for anti-racism.\n\nThe EU rejects and condemns all forms of racism and intolerance. The anti-racism action plan sets out a series of measures to:\n\ntackle racism and racial discrimination through and beyond legislation and ensure that EU legislation prohibiting hate speech and hate crime, including online, is applied on the ground;\n\nstep up action against structural racism;\n\nhelp amplify the voices of people with a minority racial or ethnic background and bring together actors at all levels in a common endeavour to build a life free from racism and discrimination for all;\n\nprovide funding for building inclusive societies and promoting tolerance and pluralism;\n\npromote diversity among Commission staff and ensure a discrimination-free and inclusive workplace for all, irrespective of peopleâs racial or ethnic origin or skin colour.\n\nUnequal treatment on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin, including relating to employment, is prohibited under the Racial Equality Directive, the Employment Equality Directive and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.\n\nPolicies are in place to combat specific forms of racism. For example, the EU strategy on combating antisemitism aims to prevent all forms of antisemitism, foster Jewish life and promote remembrance and education about the Holocaust. Another strategic framework is in place to advance Roma equality.\n\nThe Victims' Rights Directive protects victims of hate crime. The EU strategy on victimsâ rights (2020â2025) aims to ensure that all victims of crime receive support and protection no matter where in the EU the crime takes place.\n\nThe EU is also devoted to preventing and countering the spread of online hatred while always protecting freedom of expression. The 2016 code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online has enabled users to flag online hate speech and allows platforms to swiftly review and remove illegal or harmful content.\n\nLGBTIQ equality\n\nThe EU guarantees a range of fundamental rights for its citizens and protects them from discrimination. This includes members of the LGBTIQ community.\n\nAround 76 % of Europeans polled in 2019 agreed that gay, lesbian or bisexual people should have the same rights as heterosexual people. However, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, non-binary, intersex and queer people (LGBTIQ) can face discrimination in many areas of life, along with hate speech and violence.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nIn 2020, the Commission adopted its first LGBTIQ equality strategy, addressing discrimination, safety, inclusivity and equality.\n\nThe strategy builds on over 20 years of action at the EU level. Since 1999, the EU has had the power to act in cases of discrimination based on sexual orientation. EU actions include the following.\n\nThe Employment Equality Framework Directive, which obliges all EU countries to provide legal protection against discrimination and harassment on the basis of sexual orientation in respect of job applications, promotion, training, working conditions and pay and dismissal.\n\nThe Gender Recast Directive that protects trans people against discrimination in their professional life arising from gender reassignment and the Directive on Sex Equality in Social Security to protect people against discrimination in social security.\n\nThe Victimsâ Rights Directive, which created a set of binding rights for victims of hate speech or violence and obliges EU countries to ensure they are put into practice.\n\nAcross the world, same-gender relationships are still criminalised in several countries, with little protection for LGBTIQ people. The EU encourages other countries to ensure that sexual orientation, gender identity or sexual characteristics cannot be grounds for violence or criminal penalties.\n\nThe EU is also a major donor worldwide to projects aimed at combating discrimination, mainly through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. Since 2016, the EU has supported projects in Asia, Africa, Latin America and eastern Europe. In 2018, the EU launched a fund to support activists and organisations in areas where LGBTIQ people are at greater risk of discrimination.\n\nDisability\n\nThe EU promotes the active inclusion and full participation in society and the economy of people with disabilities on an equal basis with others, and protects them from discrimination and violence.\n\nAround 87 million people in the EU have some form of disability. They have the same rights and fundamental freedoms as everyone else, including the right to equality and non-discrimination and to be free from exploitation, violence and abuse. The EU is working to create a barrier-free Europe that empowers and enables people with disabilities to fully enjoy their rights.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EU and its Member States are parties to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Moreover, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the EU treaties further commit the EU to promote policies that address the rights and needs of people with disabilities.\n\nThe 2021â2030 strategy for the rights of persons with disabilities, anchored in the UN convention and building on its predecessor and the European Pillar of Social Rights, sets out concrete initiatives to ensure that people with disabilities can:\n\nenjoy the same right to free movement as everyone else â the EU parking card and the EU disability card, already piloted in eight Member States, facilitate the mutual recognition of disability status and entitlements between EU countries;\n\nbetter participate in the labour market through specific measures to improve their employment opportunities;\n\nlive independently, wherever and with whomever they choose â the AccessibleEU resource centre will contribute to improving access to transport, buildings, information, audiovisual media, communications and technologies;\n\nparticipate in society and the economy and be protected from discrimination and violence â the strategy also aims to ensure equal opportunities in and access to justice, education, culture, sport and tourism.\n\nIn recent years, a number of EU initiatives and legislation have contributed to improving the lives of people with disabilities in Europe. The European Accessibility Act sets out binding requirements for the accessibility of certain key products and services. Specific rules are also in place to ensure protection against discrimination and equal treatment in employment and occupation.\n\nThe EU is also committed to raising awareness of the challenges people with disabilities encounter every day and the tools they need to improve their lives. The European Day of Persons with Disabilities, celebrated at the beginning of December each year, helps bring disability issues to the attention of the broader public. Each year, the Access City Award rewards a city that has made outstanding efforts to become more accessible.\n\nOver 50s\n\nThe EU is working to help people live healthy, active and independent lives for as long as possible. It complements Member Statesâ actions in areas such as employment, health and education, and coordinates joint action on epidemics.\n\nDemographic trends show that in the coming decades, the share of older people in the EU will increase significantly. The Commissionâs green paper on ageing has launched a debate on the challenges and opportunities of Europeâs ageing society. EU countries are addressing the impacts of ageing by improving education and skills systems, encouraging longer and fuller working lives and advancing reforms of social protection, including pensions and long-term care.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EU has made it illegal for employers to discriminate on the grounds of age. The European Network of Equality Bodies helps ensure that EU rules on equality and non-discrimination are applied in a uniform way across the EU.\n\nEU initiatives such as the European Skills Agenda, the Pact for Skills and the Digital Education Action Plan help prepare people for the changing world of work. Projects funded by the European Social Fund Plus help millions of Europeans learn new skills and find better jobs each year.\n\nWhether itâs for career advancement or for personal development, itâs never too late to learn. A wide range of opportunities for the over 50s â from work-based learning courses and training to EU-funded projects â are available through Erasmus+.\n\nEURES, the European job mobility network, helps those looking for a job in another Member State, while EU rules facilitate the coordination of national social security systems, protecting the rights of people moving or retiring within Europe.\n\nA new voluntary pension scheme, the pan-European personal pension product (PEPP), now offers people more choice and enables them to keep saving in the same product, even if they move to another EU country. Every 3 years, the Commission publishes a report on the current and future adequacy of old-age incomes in Member States. Through the 2021â2030 strategy for the rights of persons with disabilities, the EU will contribute to tackling gaps in social protection, including pension schemes, for people with disabilities.\n\nThe EU is active in many different areas, such as promoting healthy lifestyles, supporting more effective and sustainable healthcare services, disease prevention and stepping up the fight against cancer.\n\nThe EU financially supports non-governmental organisations promoting the right to fair treatment and working to address age discrimination, such as AGE Platform Europe.\n\nDigital economy and society\n\nThe EU is determined to make the 2020s Europeâs digital decade. It is working to ensure that digital technologies work for everyone, while helping to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, and securing Europeâs place as a leader in the digital economy.\n\nDigital technologies have never been more important in our lives. During the COVID-19 crisis, they have kept people connected and businesses working, and have proved essential for education and training. They are also crucial in fighting climate change, including through smart energy and transport systems.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe groundwork for the digital transformation has already been laid. EU action has brought benefits such as:\n\nan end to additional roaming charges when people use their mobile devices when travelling in the EU;\n\naccess to online content when traveling in the EU;\n\nstrict EU rules on personal data protection;\n\nfree public Wi-Fi hotspots across the EU;\n\nnew rules to ensure better access to public websites for people with disabilities;\n\naction to fight fake news and online disinformation.\n\nThe EUâs proposed digital strategy will continue to work on digital solutions that benefit people, businesses and the planet. It focuses on three main objectives: technology that works for people, a fair and competitive economy and an open, democratic and sustainable society.\n\nThe Commission has proposed a comprehensive set of rules for online platforms operating in the EU to protect the fundamental rights of citizens online, to address online harm and to foster innovation. Beyond that, the strategy also covers everything from cybersecurity and data to digital education and democracy. The proposed Digital Compass translates the EUâs goals for 2030 into concrete targets. Safeguarding EU values and peopleâs fundamental rights and security is a key element.\n\nThe Digital Europe programme, with over â¬7.5 billion in funding between 2021 and 2027, will boost investments in areas such as supercomputing, artificial intelligence and digital skills. It will also ensure wide use of digital technologies across the economy and society, including through digital innovation hubs.\n\nOther programmes will also support the digital transition, including Horizon Europe, which focuses on research and technological development, and the digital aspects of the Connecting Europe Facility. In addition, under the NextGenerationEU recovery fund, Member States should allocate 20 % of their financial support from the Recovery and Resilience Facility to the digital transformation.\n\nFind out more: https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en\n\nA safer internet\n\nThe EU has the strictest data protection and privacy rules in the world. These help ensure that the online environment is safe and fair for citizens and businesses alike and protect people, in particular children, from illegal and harmful content.\n\nThe rapid growth of online services in recent years has brought many benefits for Europeans, but also potential new risks. This is why the EU is continually working to ensure that its legislation keeps pace with the digital transformation and that what is illegal offline is also illegal online.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe protection of personal data and privacy are fundamental rights in the EU. The EU has been applying high standards for data protection and privacy for decades. The law gives people rights as regards data protection and confidentiality of communications, which must be respected by organisations that process their data. In response to the realities of the internet age, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives individuals enforceable rights, including the right to be forgotten.\n\nIn parallel, the EU is leading efforts to make the digital world a secure place. The cybersecurity strategy aims to strengthen the EUâs collective resilience against cyber threats and help ensure that all citizens and businesses can benefit from trustworthy and reliable services and digital tools.\n\nThe Commission is tackling the spread of online disinformation and misinformation to ensure the protection of European values and democratic systems. Initiatives include the Action Plan and Code of Practice on Disinformation to fight fake news and disinformation; the European Democracy Action Plan and the European Digital Media Observatory.\n\nThe EUâs Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online aims to ensure that requests to remove racist and xenophobic content are dealt with speedily. Companies, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat, have committed to reviewing the majority of these requests in less than 24 hours and to removing the content if necessary.\n\nThe safety of children online is paramount. The European strategy for a better internet for children has influenced national policies in most Member States and set a global benchmark for the protection and empowerment of children online. The EU-funded network of Safer Internet Centres helps raise awareness of online safety and foster child participation. New rules on audiovisual media services require online video-sharing platforms to take steps to restrict childrenâs access to harmful content, while the proposed Digital Services Act anticipates specific obligations to address significant risks to the well-being of children. The Commission has also presented an EU strategy for a more effective fight against child sexual abuse.\n\nCitizens and democracy\n\nThe EU encourages transparency and democratic participation in a just and fair European political system, and actively promotes citizen engagement in the EU decision-making process.\n\nThe EU is governed by the principle of representative democracy, with citizens directly represented at the EU level in the European Parliament and Member States represented in the European Council and the Council of the European Union. The EU works to safeguard European democracy, promote free and fair elections and uphold the electoral rights of EU citizens.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe 2019 European parliamentary elections saw the highest voter turnout in 20 years (over 50 %), indicating a healthy level of democratic participation of EU citizens and a desire to be heard.\n\nThe Conference on the Future of Europe was launched as part of the EUâs commitment to listen to citizens and to give them a greater say on what the EU does and how it works for them. The year-long initiative provided a unique opportunity for Europeans to share their ideas and expectations through a series of citizen-led debates and discussions.\n\nEU citizens can contribute to the European decision-making process in a number of ways. The âHave your sayâ website gives citizens and businesses the chance to share their views on new EU policies and existing laws. Meanwhile, the European Citizensâ Initiative allows citizens to call on the Commission to propose legislation on areas under EU responsibility, once an initiative has gathered 1 million signatures across at least seven Member States. Citizensâ dialogues give people the chance to ask EU politicians questions, make comments and say how EU policies affect them.\n\nThe European Democracy Action Plan aims to empower citizens and strengthen democracy in the EU, with measures to promote free and fair elections, fight disinformation, and strengthen media freedom. As part of its work in this area, the Commission has set out concrete action to improve the safety of journalists and media professionals and to protect them from abusive lawsuits.\n\nThe Commission has proposed new rules to ensure greater transparency on paid political advertising, which has grown in importance in campaigning in the EU in recent years. It has also proposed to update the current EU rules concerning the funding of EU political parties and the electoral rights of mobile citizens. The Commission reports every 3 years on progress towards effective EU citizenship and new priorities for the years ahead in the area of EU citizenship rights.\n\nThe EU budget\n\nThe EU budget provides the resources that the EU needs to deliver on its policy agenda. By pooling resources at the EU level, Member States achieve more than by acting alone and can successfully address challenges that know no borders, like climate change or the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe EU budget consists of long-term plans that cover 7 years. The European Parliament and EU countries in the Council decide on the budget for each year on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. In 2022, the annual budget was about â¬170 billion, a large sum in absolute terms but only about 1 % of the wealth generated by EU economies every year. Less than 7 % is spent on EU administration.\n\nThe EU budget is financed mainly through revenue from customs duties, contributions based on value added tax (VAT), contributions based on non-recycled plastic packaging waste and a direct contribution by EU countries, known as the gross national income-based contribution. To fight any misuse of EU money, the European Anti-Fraud Office independently investigates corruption, fraud and other illegal activities involving EU funds and develops anti-fraud policy for the Commission.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nThe EU budget has been at the heart of Europeâs response to the COVID-19 crisis, through a â¬2 trillion investment package. It consists of the EUâs long-term budget for 2021 to 2027 of â¬1 211 billion, topped up by â¬807 billion through NextGenerationEU, a temporary instrument to power the recovery. Funds from this package are being used to support Europeâs economic recovery and steer the transition towards a modern, sustainable and resilient EU. To finance NextGenerationEU, the EU is borrowing on the capital markets. The borrowed amounts will be repaid over a long-term period, until 2058. To help with the repayments, the EU is looking into introducing new sources of revenue for the EU budget.\n\nTo give some examples, funds from the EU budget enabled the EU to sign advance purchase agreements with pharmaceutical companies for COVID-19 vaccines. On this basis, the EU secured up to 4.2 billion vaccine doses.\n\nIn 2022, in the aftermath of Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, the EU budget was mobilised to provide emergency assistance, support at the border and in EU countries, and to alleviate the humanitarian consequences of the war.\n\nMigration and asylum\n\nThe EUâs migration and asylum policy helps Europe deal with migration challenges in an effective manner.\n\nThe EU works to combat irregular migration and people smuggling, save lives and secure the EUâs external borders while still attracting new talent and skills.\n\nThanks to measures taken by the EU to control its external borders and manage migration, irregular arrivals have fallen by almost 90 % since 2015.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nBuilding on progress made since 2016, the Commissionâs 2020 proposal for a new pact on migration and asylum will put in place an effective system to manage migration and deal with irregular arrivals, including in times of crisis. The new framework will ensure the fair sharing of responsibility and solidarity between Member States while providing certainty for individual applicants.\n\nThe pact ensures that those in genuine need will have the right to stay in the EU, while the first EU strategy on voluntary return and reintegration aims to help people with no right to stay in the EU to return voluntarily to and seize opportunities in their home country.\n\nA new policy on legal migration aims to attract people with new skills and talent that will benefit the EU economy, strengthen cooperation with non-EU countries and improve overall migration management in the long term.\n\nIntegration and inclusion are key for people coming to Europe, local communities, the long-term well-being of our societies and the stability of our economies. While integration policy is primarily the responsibility of Member States, the EU is stepping up action in this area. The 2021â2027 action plan on integration and inclusion aims for inclusion for all through better access to jobs, healthcare, housing and education.\n\nStepping up the response to migrant smuggling is a common challenge for the EU, its Member States and partner countries alike. Since 2015, over 650 000 lives have been saved at sea by EU and Member State operations. The renewed EU action plan against migrant smuggling sets out measures to counter and prevent smuggling in cooperation with partner countries.\n\nThe EU is an area of protection for people fleeing persecution or serious harm in their country of origin. Following Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU acted swiftly to offer immediate support to people fleeing the war, including temporary protection in the EU. The temporary protection scheme gives people rights such as residence permits, access to the labour market and housing, healthcare and access to education for children.\n\nThe Schengen area\n\nThe EU provides a border-free travel area to more than 425 million people in 26 countries, as well as to non-EU citizens living in the EU or visiting as tourists, exchange students or for business purposes.\n\nThanks to the Schengen Agreement, checks at many EU internal borders have been progressively abolished. Today, almost 1.7 million people live in one Schengen country and work in another, while 3.5 million travel between Schengen countries every day. The Schengen area also contributes to the functioning of the single market, enabling goods and services to circulate freely.\n\nWhat the EU does\n\nSince 1985, the Schengen area has grown to encompass most EU countries (except Bulgaria, Ireland, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), plus four non-EU countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland).\n\nHowever, the abolition of internal borders cannot come at the expense of security. Since no checks are carried out at their internal borders, Schengen countries have joined forces to improve security through tightened controls at their external borders based on a set of common rules.\n\nOperational cooperation between Member Statesâ law enforcement authorities is essential to ensuring security inside the EU. One of the main tools is the Schengen information system, used to exchange data on wanted and missing persons and objects in real time.\n\nIn 2017, the EU introduced new rules to reinforce checks against relevant databases on all people crossing its external borders, including EU citizens, to make sure that they do not represent a threat to internal security or public order. By the end of 2023, a new system will be in place to pre-screen travellers from outside the EU who donât require a visa to visit the Schengen area. The European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) will also apply to Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania. It will help close existing security information gaps while avoiding delays at the border for travellers.\n\nBuilding on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, proposed new rules aim to ensure that controls at internal borders are only introduced as a last resort. They also introduce common tools to manage the external borders more efficiently in the event of a public health crisis.\n\nThe European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) plays an important role in protecting the EUâs external borders and managing migration. The first deployment of the agencyâs new standing corps started on 1 January 2021. It will reach it"
