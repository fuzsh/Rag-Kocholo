        "text": "The FTUB specialists analyze the correlation between salaries and prices in the country. In 2017, the Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus suggested exercisingÂ âpublicâ control over prices for socially important goods and services. The proposal was backed by the Head of State.\n\nIn order to prevent unreasonable growth in prices for goods and services, a council on prices and tariffs was set up in May 2019 on the initiative of the Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus. The council includes representatives of the Ministry of Antimonopoly Regulation and Trade, the FTUB, the National Bank and the National Statistical Committee. Its aim is to monitor the situation with prices in the country, give a detailed analysis of the monitoring results, and prepare recommendations to make decisions on prices and duties.\n\nThe trade unions pay close attention to the development of childrenâs sport. There are 107 sport schools run by the trade unions in the country, with about 41,000 students going in for 48 sports. Every year over 500 students graduate from the sport schools and begin training on a higher level. The trade unionsâ sport system for children offers not only professional athlete training but additional social support for families, opportunities for affordable and useful recreation for the younger generation.\n\nThe Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus places a high priority on preserving memory about the historic past of the country. Together with employees of various companies and enterprises, young Belarusians and veteran organizations the trade unions tidy up memorable places, war graves of soldiers and civilians. The trade unions help recover names of the fallen, raise funds for erecting and renewing memorial complexes.\n\nIn 2017, the Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus was honored with Belarus Presidentâs award For Spiritual Revival. The organization received the award for a number of projects aimed at promoting the patriotic education of citizens, including children, students and working youth. The renovation of the Mound of Glory memorial complex was one of the FTUBâs biggest projects. In 2019, the Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus helped expand the exposition of military hardware at the Mound of Glory museum. On its initiative Belarusâ first renovated legendary attack aircraft Il-2 was mounted there.\n\nâTrade unions have always been in the center of crucial economic and political events. They make up the essential foundation for maintaining balance in the society,â Aleksandr Lukashenko,Â President of BelarusÂ said at the 8th Congress of the Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus in February 2020.\n\nThe Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus was awarded the Honorary State Banner in recognition of outstanding achievements in the social and economic development, protection of rights and interests of Belarusian workers."
