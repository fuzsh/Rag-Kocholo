None of our movement’s achievements would have happened without the effort, organization and advocacy of our brothers and sisters. But injustice still runs amok. We must look to the past not only for inspiration, but for the tools we need to continue the fight. The roots of the problems we face today can be found in our past. So can the beginnings of the solutions we need for our future.\n\nThe labor history timeline highlights the key events and the people who helped bring about radical changes in the workplace and society.\n\nPower concedes nothing without demands.\n\nFrederick Douglass\n\nThe Labor Movement and Gender Equality\n\nSome of the earliest organizing efforts in the United States were young women working at mills. From that point forward, the labor movement has played a central role in the advancement of women’s rights.\n\n1834 First turnout of “mill girls” in Lowell, Massachusetts, to protect wage cuts\n\n1843 Lowell Female Labor Reform Association begins public petitioning for 10-hour day\n\n1871 After her dress shop is destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire, Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones begins working as a labor organizer\n\n1903 Women’s Trade Union League formed at the AFL convention\n\n1909 “Uprising of the 20,000” female shirtwaist makers in New York strike against sweatshop conditions\n\n1911 Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire in New York kills nearly 150 workers\n\n1912 Bread and Roses strike begun by immigrant women in Lawrence, Massachusetts, ended with 23,000 men, women and children on strike and with as many as 20,000 on the picket line\n\n1933 Frances Perkins becomes the U.S. secretary of labor, the first woman to be appointed to the U.S. Cabinet\n\n1963 Equal Pay Act bans wage discrimination based on gender\n\n1974 Coalition of Labor Union Women founded\n\n2009 President Barack Obama signs the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which restored the rights of working women to sue over pay discrimination\n\nThe Labor Movement and Immigrant Rights\n\nOne of the driving forces in immigration to the United States is the search for good jobs. Fighting for the rights of immigrant workers has long been part of the labor movement.\n\n1877 National uprising of railroad workers 10 Irish coal miners (\"Molly Maguires\") hanged in Pennsylvania; nine more subsequently were hanged\n\n1909 Unorganized immigrant steelworkers strike in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, and win all demands\n\n1912 Bread and Roses strike begun by immigrant women in Lawrence, Massachusetts, ended with 23,000 men, women and children on strike and with as many as 20,000 on the picket line\n\n1973 Labor Council for Latin American Advancement founded\n\n2000 AFL-CIO Executive Council calls for reform in the nation’s immigration laws for undocumented workers\n\n2006 The AFL-CIO and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network form a partnership to collaborate with local worker centers on immigration reform and other issues\n\nThe Labor Movement and Workplace Safety\n\nMuch of the labor movement’s history is a response to dangerous work conditions. Making sure that workplaces are safe is one of the driving reasons that working people organize to express their voice.\n\n1909 “Uprising of the 20,000” female shirtwaist makers in New York strike against sweatshop conditions\n\n1911 Triangle Shirtwaist factory in fire in New York kills nearly 150 workers\n\n1945 Frances Perkins ends her long tenure as secretary of labor, leaving behind a legacy that reduced workplace accidents, created laws against child labor and expanded workers' rights\n\n1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act passed\n\nThe Labor Movement and Civil Rights\n\nThe civil rights movement and the labor movement have been intertwined from the beginning. Civil rights leaders have always been labor leaders, too. America's union movement champions those who lack a voice in our society. Union members played a critical role in the civil rights struggles of the past and that involvement continues today.\n\nWhen Martin Luther King Jr. was jailed for civil disobedience, unions and union members frequently came to his aid with the legal and financial help he needed. Union members marched in Washington in 1963 and in countless cities around the country. King was killed while in Memphis to aid striking sanitation workers.\n\nToday, the union movement is in the forefront of efforts to ensure that the gains of the past are maintained and to fight for those still denied opportunity and equality. From its struggles to ensure U.S. workplaces are free of discrimination to its battles to ensure that the hard-earned right to vote is secure for all, the union movement continues to fight for the poor and the oppressed.\n\n1619 Slaves from Africa first imported to colonies\n\n1664 First slavery codes begin trend of making African servants slaves for life\n\n1676 Bacon’s Rebellion of servants and slaves in Virginia\n\n1800 Gabriel Prosser’s slave insurrection in Virginia\n\n1865 Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution abolishes slavery\n\n1869 Colored National Labor Union formed\n\n1870 Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution adopted; states the right to vote may not be abrogated by color\n\n1925 A.

Good wages are part of that calculation, but so are health care, paid sick leave and other rights that make sure that working people can do their jobs and take care of their families.\n\n1619 The first labor strike on American soil was organized and staged by Polish workers and artisans in Jamestown\n\n1677 First recorded prosecution against strikers in New York City\n\n1791 First strike in building trades by Philadelphia carpenters for a 10-hour day Bill of Rights adopted\n\n1835 General strike for 10-hour day in Philadelphia\n\n1843 Lowell Female Labor Reform Association begins public petitioning for 10-hour day\n\n1847 New Hampshire enacts first state 10-hour-day law\n\n1860 Great shoemaker’s strike in New England\n\n1885 Successful strike by Knights of Labor on the Southwest (or Gould) System; the Missouri Pacific; the Missouri, Kansas and Texas; and the Wabash\n\n1886 General strike in Chicago turns bloody in Haymarket Square; seven “anarchists” charged and sentenced to death\n\n1890 Carpenters President Peter J.
