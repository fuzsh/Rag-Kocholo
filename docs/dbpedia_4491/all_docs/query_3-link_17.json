        "text": "Regional integration helps countries overcome divisions that impede the flow of goods, services, capital, people and ideas. These divisions are a constraint to economic growth, especially in developing countries. The World Bank Group helps its client countries to promote regional integration through common physical and institutional infrastructure.\n\nDivisions between countries created by geography, poor infrastructure and inefficient policies are an impediment to economic growth. Regional integration allows countries to overcome these costly divisions integrating goods, services and factorsâ€™ markets, thus facilitating the flow of trade, capital, energy, people and ideas.\n\nRegional integration can be promoted through common physical and institutional infrastructure. Specifically, regional integration requires cooperation between countries in:\n\nTrade, investment and domestic regulation;\n\nTransport, ICT and energy infrastructure;\n\nMacroeconomic and financial policy;\n\nThe provision of other common public goods (e.g. shared natural resources, security, education).\n\nCooperation in these areas has taken different institutional forms, with different levels of policy commitments and shared sovereignty, and has had different priorities in different world regions.\n\nRegional integration can lead to substantial economic gains. Regional integration allows countries to:\n\nImprove market efficiency;\n\nShare the costs of public goods or large infrastructure projects;\n\nDecide policy cooperatively and have an anchor to reform;\n\nHave a building block for global integration;\n\nReap other non-economic benefits, such as peace and security.\n\nHowever, there are risks to regional integration that need to be identified and managed."
