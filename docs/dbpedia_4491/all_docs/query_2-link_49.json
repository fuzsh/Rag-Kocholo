        "text": "A student has opted out of directory information and wants to be anonymous in an online course. Are we required to allow the student to take the course anonymously?\n\nNo. Under FERPA, a student may not use his or her right to opt out of directory information disclosures to prevent school officials from identifying the student by name or disclosing the student’s electronic identifier or institutional e-mail address in class.\n\nAn eligible student that opted out of directory information has left the school. Now that the student is no longer in attendance, may the school disclose that students directory information?\n\nNo, a school is required to honor the eligible student’s request to opt out of the disclosure of directory information made while the student was in attendance, unless the student rescinds the opt out request.\n\nAre educational agencies and institutions required to notify parents and eligible students of their rights under FERPA?\n\nYes. Educational agencies and institutions must annually notify parents and eligible students of their rights under FERPA. Specifically, schools must notify parents and eligible students of the right: to inspect and review education records and the procedures to do so; to seek amendment of records the parent or eligible student believes are inaccurate and the procedures to so do; to consent to disclosures of education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent; and to file a complaint with SPPO concerning potential violations. Postsecondary institutions are only required to notify eligible students of their rights under FERPA.34 CFR § 99.7\n\nAre law enforcement records considered education records?\n\n“Law enforcement unit records” (i.e., records created by the law enforcement unit, created for a law enforcement purpose, and maintained by the law enforcement unit) are not “education records” subject to the privacy protections of FERPA. As such, the law enforcement unit may refuse to provide a parent or eligible student with an opportunity to inspect and review law enforcement unit records, and it may disclose law enforcement unit records to third parties without the parent or eligible student’s prior written consent. However, education records, or personally identifiable information from education records, which the school shares with the law enforcement unit, do not lose their protected status as education records just because they are shared with the law enforcement unit.\n\nAre law enforcement records protected under FERPA?\n\n“Law enforcement unit records” (i.e., records created by a law enforcement unit at the educational agency or institution, created for a law enforcement purpose, and maintained by the law enforcement unit) are not “education records” subject to the privacy protections of FERPA. As such, the law enforcement unit may refuse to provide a parent or eligible student with an opportunity to inspect and review law enforcement unit records, and it may disclose law enforcement unit records to third parties without the parent’s or eligible student’s prior written consent.\n\nResources:\n\nFERPA General Guidance for Parents\n\nAre LEAs or schools required to have written agreements with the Child Welfare Agency (CWA) or tribal organization prior to disclosing personally identifiable information (PII) from education records to the welfare agency or tribal organization?\n\nNo. The written agreement requirements in the FERPA regulations do not apply to a disclosure of PII from education records made under this exception by an LEA or school. However, LEAs and schools may want to consider a written agreement, data sharing agreement, or memorandum of understanding (MOU) with a CWA or tribal organization to ensure that the CWA or tribal organization is aware of its responsibility under FERPA to protect PII from education records from unauthorized disclosure.\n\nAre private schools subject to the military recruiter requirements?\n\nPrivate secondary schools that receive funds under the ESEA are subject to 10 U.S.C. § 503. However, private schools that maintain a religious objection to service in the Armed Forces that is verifiable through the corporate or other organizational documents or materials of that school are not required to comply with this law.\n\nAre School Resource Officers (SROs) or other outside local law enforcement officials who serve as a school’s law enforcement unit automatically considered school officials?\n\nNo, not automatically. These officials may be considered “school officials” with “legitimate educational interests” and have access to students’ education records, but only if they:\n\nPerform an institutional service or function for which the agency or institution would otherwise use employees;\n\nAre under the direct control of the agency or institution with respect to the use and maintenance of education records;\n\nAre subject to the requirements in § 99.33(a) that the personally identifiable information (PII) from education records may be used only for the purposes for which the disclosure was made, e.g., to promote school safety and the physical security of students, and governing the redisclosure of PII from education records; and\n\nMeet the criteria specified in the school or LEA’s annual notification of FERPA rights for being a school official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records.\n\nAre schools required to record the disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) from students’ education records whenever they make disclosures?\n\nSubject to certain exceptions addressed below, schools must maintain a record of each request for access to, and each disclosure of PII from, the education records of each student, as well as the names of state and local educational authorities and federal officials and agencies listed in § 99.31(a)(3) that may make further disclosures of PII from students’ education records without consent. The school must maintain this record with the education records of the student as long as the education records are maintained.\n\nSchools do not have to record disclosures of PII from education records that were made to: 1) the parent or eligible student; 2) a school official under § 99.31(a)(1); 3) a party with written consent from the parent or eligible student; 4) a party seeking directory information; or 5) a party seeking or receiving records in accordance with the provisions in FERPA related to disclosures pursuant to certain types of subpoenas or court orders as set forth in § 99.31(a)(9)(ii)(A)-(C). See § 99.32(d).\n\nAre SEAs required to have written agreements with the Child Welfare Agency (CWA) or tribal organization prior to redisclosing education records to the CWA or tribal organization?\n\nNo. The written agreement requirement of FERPA does not apply to disclosures of education records made under this exception to FERPA’s general consent requirement including the redisclosure of education records by an SEA. The written agreement requirement applies only in the context of other exceptions to FERPA’s general consent requirement (e.g.., the studies exception and the audit/evaluation exception). See §§ 99.31(a)(6) and 99.35(a)(3).\n\nAre there any limitations as to what education records may be disclosed to a community-based organization to which a school has outsourced an institutional service under the school official exception?\n\nYes.\n\nFERPA (§ 99.31(a)(1)(i)(B)) permits schools to outsource institutional services or functions that involve the disclosure of education records to contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other third parties provided that the outside party:\n\nPerforms an institutional service or function for which the agency or institution would otherwise use employees;\n\nIs under the direct control of the agency or institution with respect to the use and maintenance of education records;\n\nIs subject to the requirements in § 99.33(a) that the personally identifiable information (PII) from education records may be used only for the purposes for which the disclosure was made, e.g., to promote school safety and the physical security of students, and governing the redisclosure of PII from education records; and\n\nMeets the criteria specified in the school or local educational agency’s (LEA’s) annual notification of FERPA rights for being a school official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records.\n\nIt is a best practice to enter into a written agreement with the community-based organization prior to sharing any PII from education records.\n\nAre there any limitations to sharing information based on personal knowledge or observations?\n\nFERPA applies to the disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) from education records that are maintained by the school. Therefore, FERPA does not prohibit a school official from releasing information about a student that was obtained through the school official’s personal knowledge or observation unless that knowledge is obtained through his or her official role in making a determination maintained in an education records about the student. For example, under FERPA a principal or other school official who took official action to suspend a student may not disclose that information, absent consent or an exception under § 99.31 that permits the disclosure.\n\nAre there any restrictions on how a community-based organization can use and protect the personally identifiable information (PII) from education records it receives to conduct a study?\n\nYes. Under the studies exception, the school or LEA may non-consensually disclose PII from education records to the community-based organization only if\n\nThe study is conducted in a manner that does not permit personal identification of parents and students by individuals other than representatives of the organization that have legitimate interests in the information;\n\nThe information is destroyed when no longer needed for the purposes for which the study was conducted; and\n\nThe school or LEA enters into a written agreement with the community-based organization.\n\nAre there limitations as to how the community-based organization may use the personally identifiable information (PII) from education records it receives from a school under the school official exception?\n\nYes\n\nFERPA (§ 99.31(a)(1)(i)(B)) permits schools to outsource institutional services or functions that involve the disclosure of education records to contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other third parties provided that the outside party:\n\nPerforms an institutional service or function for which the agency or institution would otherwise use employees;\n\nIs under the direct control of the agency or institution with respect to the use and maintenance of education records;\n\nIs subject to the requirements in § 99.33(a) that the personally identifiable information (PII) from education records may be used only for the purposes for which the disclosure was made, e.g., to promote school safety and the physical security of students, and governing the redisclosure of PII from education records; and\n\nMeets the criteria specified in the school or local educational agency’s (LEA’s) annual notification of FERPA rights for being a school official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records.\n\nIt is a best practice to enter into a written agreement with the community-based organization prior to sharing any PII from education records.\n\nAre there situations in which school officials may non-consensually disclose personally identifiable information from education records of students who have been disciplined for conduct that posed a significant risk to the safety of the school community?\n\nYes. Under FERPA, a school may share PII from education records with school officials within the school whom the school has determined to have legitimate educational interests in the behavior of a student who has been disciplined for conduct that posed a significant risk to the safety or well-being of that student, other students, or other members of the school community. See § 99.36(b)(2) and Q&A 9 and § 99.36(b)(1) and (2).\n\nThe school may also disclose PII from education records about a student who has been disciplined for conduct that posed a significant risk to the safety or well-being of that student, other students, or other members of the school community, to school officials at another school who have been determined to have legitimate educational interests in the behavior of the student, if deemed necessary.\n\nFor instance, if a school official knows that a student, who has been disciplined for bringing a gun or knife to school or threatened to hurt students and/or teachers, is planning to attend a school-sponsored activity at another high school, FERPA would allow that school official to notify school officials at the other high school who have been determined to have legitimate educational interests in the behavior of the student. See § 99.36(b)(3).\n\nAre there ways that a school or LEA may disclose personally identifiable information (PII) from education records (other than directory information) to a community-based organization without obtaining written consent of the parent or eligible student?\n\nYes. If the disclosure meets one of the exceptions set forth in § 99.31 of the regulations, a school or LEA may disclose PII from an education record of a student without consent.\n\nCan a school provide local or other law enforcement officials with “directory information” on students?\n\nYes. If the school or school district has a directory information policy under FERPA that permits this disclosure, then the directory information of those students whose parents (or the eligible students) have not opted out of such a disclosure may be disclosed.\n\nCan a school’s law enforcement unit officials be considered schools officials with legitimate educational interests?\n\nYes, if certain conditions apply. These officials may be considered “school officials” with “legitimate educational interests” and have access to students’ education records, but only if they:\n\nPerform an institutional service or function for which the agency or institution would otherwise use employees;\n\nAre under the direct control of the agency or institution with respect to the use and maintenance of education records;\n\nAre subject to the requirements in § 99.33(a) that the personally identifiable information (PII) from education records may be used only for the purposes for which the disclosure was made, e.g., to promote school safety and the physical security of students, and governing the redisclosure of PII from education records; and\n\nMeet the criteria specified in the school or LEA’s annual notification of FERPA rights for being a school official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records.\n\nCan off-duty police officers or School Resource Officers (SROs) be considered school officials under FERPA and, therefore, have access to students’ education records?\n\nYes, if certain conditions are met. FERPA (§ 99.31(a)(1)(i)(B)) permits schools to outsource institutional services or functions that involve the disclosure of education records to contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other third parties provided that the outside party:\n\nPerforms an institutional service or function for which the agency or institution would otherwise use employees;\n\nIs under the direct control of the agency or institution with respect to the use and maintenance of education records;\n\nIs subject to the requirements in § 99.33(a) that the personally identifiable information (PII) from education records may be used only for the purposes for which the disclosure was made, e.g., to promote school safety and the physical security of students, and governing the redisclosure of PII from education records; and\n\nMeets the criteria specified in the school or local educational agency’s (LEA’s) annual notification of FERPA rights for being a school official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records.\n\nCan parents be informed about students' violation of alcohol and controlled substance rules?\n\nFERPA permits a college or university to let parents of students under the age of 21 know when the student has violated any law or policy concerning the use or possession of alcohol or a controlled substance.\n\nCan parents view a child’s post-secondary education record?\n\nFERPA generally prohibits the nonconsensual disclosure of information derived from education records, except in certain specified circumstances. One of these exceptions permits the nonconsensual disclosure of information derived from education records to that student's parent if the student is a dependent for tax purposes. Neither the age of the student, nor the parent's status as custodial parent, is relevant to determining whether disclosure of information from the education records of eligible students to a parent without written consent is permissible under FERPA. If a student is claimed as a dependent by either parent for tax purposes, then either parent may have access under this provision, absent a court order specifically prohibiting it.\n\nCan schools disclose education records to community-based organizations performing outsourced tutoring programs using the school official exception?\n\nYes. If a school chooses to outsource to a community-based organization a tutoring program that it would otherwise use school employees to provide, then the school may disclose the education records without the consent of the parents or eligible students under the school official exception.\n\nFERPA (§ 99.31(a)(1)(i)(B)) permits schools to outsource institutional services or functions that involve the disclosure of education records to contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other third parties provided that the outside party:\n\nPerforms an institutional service or function for which the agency or institution would otherwise use employees;\n\nIs under the direct control of the agency or institution with respect to the use and maintenance of education records;\n\nIs subject to the requirements in § 99.33(a) that the personally identifiable information (PII) from education records may be used only for the purposes for which the disclosure was made, e.g., to promote school safety and the physical security of students, and governing the redisclosure of PII from education records; and\n\nMeets the criteria specified in the school or local educational agency’s (LEA’s) annual notification of FERPA rights for being a school official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records.\n\nIt is a best practice to enter into a written agreement with the community-based organization prior to sharing any PII from education records.\n\nCan stepparents, grandparents, and other caregivers be considered parents under FERPA?\n\nIn some cases, a stepparent may be considered a “parent” under FERPA if the stepparent is present on a day-to-day basis with the natural parent and child and the other parent is absent from that home. Conversely, a stepparent who is not present on a day-to-day basis in the home of the child does not have rights under FERPA with respect to the child’s education records. A grandparent or other caregiver who is acting in the absence of the parent(s) may also be considered a “parent” under FERPA.\n\nSource: 34 CFR § 99.3\n\nCan the same recorded image be the education record of more than one student under FERPA?\n\nYes. For example, a surveillance video that shows two students fighting on a school bus that the school uses and maintains to discipline the two students, would be “directly related to” and, therefore, the education record of both students.\n\nColleges and the 2020 Census\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education (ED) is working with Census to share updates on the 2020 Census.\n\nCensus has posted an updated document here.\n\nGiven that many students who usually reside on college campuses may not currently be on campus, Census has 3 updates/reminders:\n\nColleges that chose the paper (drop off/pick up) method are urged to move to e-response;\n\nIn most cases, students who would ordinarily be on campus full-time but are living away from home at school should be counted at school, even if they are temporarily elsewhere (such as home) due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\nOff-campus students can complete a response through the Internet at my2020census.gov.\n\nThe Student Privacy Policy Office or SPPO has provided information on the implications of FERPA under each of the enumeration methods here.\n\nPlease contact SPPO at FERPA@ed.gov if you have questions.\n\nThe Department recently issued techncial assistance on the applicability of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) to the disclosure by IHEs or postsecondary institutions of certain personally identifiable information (PII) from student education records to representatives of the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) in connection with the 2020 Census.\n\nDepartment of Education Resources\n\nLetter on \"2020 Census and FERPA\"\n\nColleges and the 2020 Census Webinar - Recording\n\nColleges and the 2020 Census Webinar - Slides\n\nLetter to Postsecondary Institutions about the American Community Survey (ACS)\n\nCensus Resources\n\nEnsuring an Accurate Count of College Students and Towns in the 2020 Census\n\nGroup Quarters Enumeration\n\nGroup Quarters Advance Contact\n\neResponse website\n\nInformational Copy of the Individual Census Questionnaire - Stateside English\n\nInformational Copy of the Individual Census Questionnaire - Stateside Spanish\n\nInformational Copy of the Individual Census Questionnaire - Remote Alaska English\n\nInformational Copy of the Individual Census Questionnaire - Puerto Rico English\n\nInformational Copy of the Individual Census Questionnaire - Puerto Rico Spanish\n\nDo students under the age of 18, not in college, and not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian have rights under FERPA?\n\nFERPA does not specifically afford minors who are separated from their parents the rights that are afforded to parents and eligible students under the law. However, schools may use their judgment in determining whether an unaccompanied minor is responsible enough to exercise certain privileges, such as inspecting and reviewing education records and providing consent for disclosure. 34 CFR § 99.5(b).\n\nDoes a school have to explain or interpret education records when requested by a parent or eligible student?\n\nFERPA requires that an educational agency or institution respond to reasonable requests for explanations and interpretations of education records. 34 CFR § 99.10(c).\n\nDoes a school have to record disclosures made under FERPA’s health or safety emergency exception?\n\nYes. When an educational agency or institution makes a disclosure under the health or safety exception, it must record in the student’s education records the articulable and significant threat that formed the basis for the disclosure, and the parties to whom the information was disclosed. See § 99.32(a)(5).\n\nDoes a school have to use only employees to staff its law enforcement unit?\n\nThe manner in which a school establishes its law enforcement unit is outside the scope of FERPA. Accordingly, FERPA does not require a school to use only employees to staff its law enforcement unit. Local police officers and other law enforcement personnel employed by local or state authorities also may serve as the “law enforcement unit” of an educational agency or institution.\n\nDoes a spouse of an eligible student have rights with respect to that student’s education records?\n\nNo, spouses of eligible students have no rights under FERPA. Before an education institution discloses information from a student’s education records to his or her spouse, the student would have to provide written consent.\n\nDoes an educational agency or institution have discretion over what education records it decides to create and keep?\n\nYes. FERPA does not require schools to create education records nor does it require schools to maintain education records, unless there is an outstanding request by a parent or eligible student to inspect and review the records.\n\nSource: 34 CFR § 99.10(e)\n\nDoes FERPA distinguish between School Resource Officers (SROs) and other local police officers who work in a school?\n\nNo. An SRO typically serves as an on-site law enforcement officer and as a liaison with the local police or sheriff’s department. An SRO also works with teachers and school administrators to promote school safety and to help ensure physical security. An SRO may be designated by the school as a “law enforcement unit” official under FERPA (§ 99.8). However, in order for a school to disclose personally identifiable information (PII) from education records to an SRO, the SRO must be considered a “school official” under FERPA in accordance with § 99.31(a)(1)(i)(B) concerning outsourcing. A school may only non-consensually disclose PII from students’ education records to its law enforcement unit if those individuals in the law enforcement unit meet the requirements set forth in FERPA’s school official exception or if some other FERPA exception to the general consent rule applies.\n\nA school must have direct control over an SRO’s maintenance and use of education records in providing SRO services in order for the SRO to be considered a school official. Further, under the school official exception (as well as any FERPA exception to consent), SROs may only use the PII from education records for the purposes for which the disclosure was made, e.g., to promote school safety and the physical security of the students. See §§ 99.31(a)(1)(i)(B)(3) and 99.33(a)(2). In addition, SROs are subject to the redisclosure requirements of § 99.33(a). This means that an SRO who is serving as a “school official” under FERPA may not disclose PII from education records to others, including other employees of his or her local police department who are not acting as school officials, without consent unless the redisclosure fits within one of the exceptions to FERPA’s consent requirement.\n\nDoes FERPA permit educational agencies and institutions to disclose PII from education records to CWAs or tribal organizations, without consent, when the student reaches 18 years of age or attends a postsecondary institution but remains in foster care?\n\nYes. Once a student reaches 18 years old or attends a postsecondary institution at any age, the student becomes an eligible student and the rights under FERPA transfer to that student. FERPA governs the disclosure of PII from the education records of an eligible student in the same fashion as it governs the disclosure of PII from the education records of a student under the age of 18. As a practical matter, most States consider an individual who has reached the age of 18 to be an adult; therefore, the individual would generally not remain in foster care placement. However, if under State or tribal law an individual is who is 18 or older or is attending a postsecondary institution remains in a foster care placement, then the educational agency or institution may choose to disclose education records to the CWA that is legally responsible for the care and protection of the eligible student without the consent of the eligible student.\n\nDoes FERPA permit educational agencies and institutions turn over videos to the police upon request or following an incident that may warrant police involvement?\n\nIf the law enforcement unit of an educational agency or institution creates and maintains videos for a law enforcement purpose, then the videos would not be education records and FERPA would not prohibit the law enforcement unit of an educational agency or institution from disclosing the videos to the police. If the videos are education records, however, educational agencies and institutions may not turn over videos to the police upon request without having first either obtained the written consent of the parent or eligible student or determined that the conditions of an exception to the general requirement of consent have been met, such as if the disclosure is made in connection with a health or safety emergency (20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)(I) and 34 CFR §§ 99.31(a)(10) and 99.36) or the law enforcement officer has presented the educational agency or institution with a judicial order or a lawfully issued subpoena (20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)(J) and (b)(2) and 34 CFR § 99.31(a)(9)).\n\nDoes FERPA permit legal representatives of parents or eligible students to inspect and review videos with the parent or eligible student?\n\nYes. FERPA permits legal representatives of a parent or an eligible student to inspect and review videos with the parent or eligible student. While FERPA does not require educational agencies and institutions to allow parents or eligible students to bring their attorney or other legal representative with them when they exercise their right to inspect and review the student’s education records, nothing in FERPA prevents educational agencies and institutions from allowing parents or eligible students to bring their attorney or other legal representative with them when they exercise their right to inspect and review the student’s education records under FERPA.\n\nDoes FERPA permit school officials to release information that they personally observed or of which they have personal knowledge?\n\nFERPA applies to the disclosure of education records and of personally identifiable information (PII) from education records that are maintained by the school. Therefore, FERPA does not prohibit a school official from releasing information about a student that was obtained through the school official’s personal knowledge or observation, rather than from the student’s education records. For example, if a teacher overhears a student making threatening remarks to other students, FERPA does not protect that information from disclosure. Therefore, a school official may disclose what he or she overheard to appropriate authorities, including disclosing the information to local law enforcement officials, school officials, and parents.\n\nDoes FERPA permit schools to disclose a student’s education records to the state or local Child Welfare Agency (CWA) or tribal organization?\n\nThere are exceptions to consent in FERPA that permit, but do not require, local educational agencies (LEAs) and schools to disclose personally identifiable information (PII) from education records under certain conditions without the written consent of the parent or eligible student. FERPA permits LEAs and schools to disclose education records of students placed in foster care, without consent of the parent or eligible student, to an agency caseworker or other representative of a state or local child welfare agency (CWA) or tribal organization authorized to access a student’s case plan, when such agency or organization is legally responsible, in accordance with state or tribal law, for the care and protection of the student.\n\nA “case plan” is defined at 42 U.S.C. 675(1) as a written document that must include a number of specified items that, among other things, must address both the proper care of children in foster care placement. The plan also addresses the services that are provided to children in foster care placement, their parents, and their foster parents. The plan also includes, but is not limited to, ensuring the educational stability of children in foster care.\n\nThis exception to FERPA only applies to those children for whom the CWA or tribal organization is legally responsible, in accordance with state or tribal law, for the care and protection of a child in foster care placement. FERPA would not permit LEAs and schools and to disclose PII from education records to the CWA or tribal organization for children who are not in foster care placement, even if those children are receiving other services through the CWA or tribal organization (e.g., vocational and skill assessments, training, tutoring, educational services, family services, and community enrichment activities).\n\nDoes FERPA permit schools to disclose any and all education records on a student to another school where the student seeks or intends to enroll?\n\nYes. FERPA states a school may disclose education records, without parental consent (§ 99.31(a)(2)), to another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll, subject to conditions set forth in § 99.34. This exception to FERPA’s general consent requirement also permits a school to disclose education records when a student is being placed in a juvenile justice facility that is considered a school.\n\nDoes FERPA permit the disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) from education records to officials of a state’s juvenile justice system?\n\nFERPA permits schools to non-consensually disclose PII from education records to state and local officials or other authorities if the disclosure is allowed by a state law adopted after November 19, 1974, and if the disclosure concerns the juvenile justice system and its ability to serve, prior to adjudication, the student whose records are disclosed. See §§ 99.31(a)(5) and 99.38. The officials and authorities to whom such information is disclosed must certify in writing to the school that the information will not be provided to any other party, except as provided for under state law without written consent.\n\nDoes FERPA permit the sharing of education records with outside law enforcement officials, mental health officials, and other experts in the community who serve on a school’s threat assessment team?\n\nYes. Under FERPA, a school or school district may disclose personally identifiable information (PII) from education records without consent to threat assessment team members who are not employees of the school or school district if they qualify as “school officials” with “legitimate educational interests.”\n\nIn establishing a threat assessment team, the school must follow the FERPA provisions in § 99.31(a)(1)(i)(B) concerning outsourcing this function if team members will be privy to PII from students’ education records. While not a requirement of FERPA, one way to ensure that members of the team do not redisclose PII obtained from education records would be to have a written agreement with each of the team members specifying their requirements and responsibilities.\n\nSchools are reminded that members of the threat assessment team may only use PII from education records for the purposes for which the disclosure was made, i.e., to conduct threat assessments, and must be subject to FERPA’s redisclosure requirements in § 99.33(a). For example, a representative from the city police who serves on a school’s threat assessment team generally could not give the police department any PII from a student’s education records to which he or she was privy as a member of the team. However, if the threat assessment team determines that a health or safety emergency exists, then the police officer may disclose, on behalf of the school, PII from a student’s education records to appropriate officials under the health or safety emergency exception under §§ 99.31(a)(10) and 99.36, as discussed below.\n\nDoes FERPA protect the education records of students that are deceased?\n\nConsistent with our analysis of FERPA and common law principles, we interpret the FERPA rights of eligible students to lapse or expire upon the death of the student. Therefore, FERPA would not protect the education records of a deceased eligible student (a student 18 or older or in college at any age) and an educational institution may disclose such records at its discretion or consistent with State law. However, at the elementary/secondary level, FERPA rights do not lapse or expire upon the death of a non-eligible student because FERPA provides specifically that the rights it affords rest with the parents of students until that student reaches 18 years of age or attends an institution of postsecondary education. Once the parents are deceased, the records are no longer protected by FERPA.\n\nDoes FERPA require educational agencies and institutions to disclose personally identifiable information (PII) from education records to Child Welfare Agencies (CWAs) or tribal organizations whenever requested?\n\nNo. Under 20 U.S.C. § 1232g(b)(1)(L), FERPA permits, but does not require, LEAs and schools to disclose PII from the education records of a student who is in foster care placement to CWAs or tribal organizations. Further, under FERPA, an LEA or school may choose to disclose all or part of the education records it maintains on a student who is in foster care placement. We encourage LEAs and schools to disclose the information from education records that a child’s welfare caseworker would need to effectively implement a child’s case plan and to ensure the child’s education needs are met.\n\nFAQs on Photos and Videos under FERPA\n\n1. When is a photo or video of a student an education record under FERPA?\n\nAs with any other “education record,” a photo or video of a student is an education record, subject to specific exclusions, when the photo or video is: (1) directly related to a student; and (2) maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution. (20 U.S.C. 1232g(a)(4)(A); 34 CFR § 99.3 “Education Record”)[1]\n\nDirectly Related to a Student:\n\nFERPA regulations do not define what it means for a record to be “directly related” to a student. In the context of photos and videos, determining if a visual representation of a student is directly related to a student (rather than just incidentally related to him or her) is often context-specific, and educational agencies and institutions should examine certain types of photos and videos on a case by case basis to determine if they directly relate to any of the students depicted therein. Among the factors that may help determine if a photo or video should be considered “directly related” to a student are the following:\n\nThe educational agency or institution uses the photo or video for disciplinary action (or other official purposes) involving the student (including the victim of any such disciplinary incident);\n\nThe photo or video contains a depiction of an activity:\n\nthat resulted in an educational agency or institution’s use of the photo or video for disciplinary action (or other official purposes) involving a student (or, if disciplinary action is pending or has not yet been taken, that would reasonably result in use of the photo or video for disciplinary action involving a student);\n\nthat shows a student in violation of local, state, or federal law;\n\nthat shows a student getting injured, attacked, victimized, ill, or having a health emergency;\n\nThe person or entity taking the photo or video intends to make a specific student the focus of the photo or video (e.g., ID photos, or a recording of a student presentation); or\n\nThe audio or visual content of the photo or video otherwise contains personally identifiable information contained in a student’s education record.\n\nA photo or video should not be considered directly related to a student in the absence of these factors and if the student’s image is incidental or captured only as part of the background, or if a student is shown participating in school activities that are open to the public and without a specific focus on any individual.\n\nExamples of situations that may cause a video to be an education record:\n\nA school surveillance video showing two students fighting in a hallway, used as part of a disciplinary action, is directly related to the students fighting.\n\nA classroom video that shows a student having a seizure is directly related to that student because the depicted health emergency becomes the focus of the video.\n\nIf a school maintains a close-up photo of two or three students playing basketball with a general view of student spectators in the background, the photo is directly related to the basketball players because they are the focus of the photo, but it is not directly related to the students pictured in the background. Schools often designate photos or videos of students participating in public events (e.g., sporting events, concerts, theater performances, etc.) as directory information and/or obtain consent from the parents or eligible students to publicly disclose photos or videos from these events.\n\nA video recording of a faculty meeting during which a specific student’s grades are being discussed is directly related to that student because the discussion contains PII from the student’s education record.\n\nMaintained by an educational agency or institution:\n\nTo be considered an education record under FERPA, an educational agency or institution, or a party acting for the agency or institution, also must maintain the record. Thus, a photo taken by a parent at a school football game would not be considered an education record, even if it is directly related to a particular student, because it is not being maintained by the school or on the school’s behalf. If, however, the parent’s photo shows two students fighting at the game, and the parent provides a copy of the photo to the school, which then maintains the photo in the students’ disciplinary records, then the copy of the photo being maintained by the school is an education record.\n\nExclusion for Law Enforcement Unit Records\n\nThe FERPA statute and regulations (20 U.S.C. 1232g(a)(4)(B)(ii) and 34 CFR §§ 99.3 and 99.8) exclude from the definition of education records those records created and maintained by a law enforcement unit of an educational agency or institution for a law enforcement purpose. Thus, if a law enforcement unit of an educational agency or institution creates and maintains the school’s surveillance videos for a law enforcement purpose, then any such videos would not be considered to be education records. If the law enforcement unit provides a copy of the video to another component within the educational agency or institution (for example, to maintain the record in connection with a disciplinary action), then the copy of the video may become an education record of the student(s) involved if the video is not subject to any other exclusion from the definition of “education records” and the video is: (1) directly related to a student; and (2) maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution.\n\n2. Can the same recorded image be the education record of more than one student under FERPA?\n\nYes. For example, a surveillance video that shows two students fighting on a school bus that the school uses and maintains to discipline the two students, would be “directly related to” and, therefore, the education record of both students.\n\n3. If a video is an education record for multiple students, can a parent of one of the students or the eligible student view the video?\n\nWhen a video is an education record of multiple students, in general, FERPA requires the educational agency or institution to allow, upon request, an individual parent of a student (or the student if the student is an eligible student) to whom the video directly relates to inspect and review, or \"be informed of\" the content of the video, consistent with the FERPA statutory provisions in 20 U.S.C. § 1232g(a)(1)(A) and regulatory provisions at 34 CFR § 99.12(a). FERPA generally does not require the educational agency or institution to release copies of the video to the parent or eligible student.\n\nIn providing access to the video, the educational agency or institution must provide the parent of the student (or the student if the student is an eligible student) with the opportunity to inspect and review or \"be informed of\" the content of the video. If the educational agency or institution can reasonably redact or segregate out the portions of the video directly related to other students, without destroying the meaning of the record, then the educational agency or institution would be required to do so prior to providing the parent or eligible student with access. On the other hand, if redaction or segregation of the video cannot reasonably be accomplished, or if doing so would destroy the meaning of the record, then the parents of each student to whom the video directly relates (or the students themselves if they are eligible students) would have a right under FERPA to inspect and review or \"be informed of\" the entire record even though it also directly relates to other students.\n\nFor a fuller legal analysis and explanation of this issue, please see the 2017 Letter to Wachter.\n\n4. If a video is an education record for multiple students, can the parent of one of the students (or the eligible student) receive a copy of the video?\n\nWhile we do not advise on an educational agency’s or institution’s obligations under any state open records laws that may apply, we note that FERPA does not generally require an educational agency or institution to provide copies of education records to parents and eligible students[2]. That said, it would not violate FERPA for an educational agency or institution to non-consensually disclose to an eligible student or to his or her parents copies of education records that the eligible student or his or her parents otherwise would have the right to inspect and review under FERPA.\n\nFor a fuller legal analysis and explanation of this issue, please see the 2017 Letter to Wachter.\n\n5. If redaction or segregation of an education record of multiple students can be reasonably accomplished without destroying the meaning of the education record, can educational agencies and institutions charge parents or eligible students for the costs of the redaction or segregation?\n\nNo. FERPA provides parents and eligible students with the right to inspect and review the student’s education records, and nothing in the FERPA statute or regulations permits educational agencies and institutions to charge parents or eligible students for fees or costs associated with exercising that right.\n\nIf a school elects to provide a parent or eligible student with a copy of the education records, then the FERPA regulations (34 CFR § 99.11(a)) generally permit (with the exception noted below) the school to charge for the costs required to make the copy. FERPA regulations (34 CFR § 99.11(b)) also provide that the school may not charge a parent or eligible student for the costs to search for or retrieve the education records. We view the costs, if any, to the school of redacting, or segregating, education records of multiple students as being like the costs of search and retrieval that may not be charged to parents or eligible students, rather than like the costs for copies that generally may be charged to parents and eligible students. As noted above, if an educational agency or institution can reasonably redact or segregate out portions of an education record that is directly related to other students, without destroying the meaning of the record, then the educational agency or institution must do so and therefore cannot charge parents or eligible students for the costs associated with exercising their right to inspect and review such education records.\n\nIn contrast, parents and eligible students generally may be charged for the costs of making copies of education records precisely because FERPA generally does not require the school to provide them with such copies. Thus, where the redaction or segregation of education records of multiple students can be reasonably accomplished without destroying the meaning of the education records, nothing in FERPA permits educational agencies or institutions to charge parents or eligible students for the costs of making the required redactions or segregation. Please note that the FERPA regulations (34 CFR § 99.11(a)) similarly provide that if a fee for copies effectively prevents a parent or an eligible student from exercising the right to inspect and review his or her education records, an educational agency or institution would be required to provide copies without payment. Such cases would be limited to a parent or an eligible student providing evidence of the inability to pay for the copies due to financial hardship.\n\n6. Does FERPA permit legal representatives of parents or eligible students to inspect and review videos with the parent or eligible student?\n\nYes. FERPA permits legal representatives of a parent or an eligible student to inspect and review videos with the parent or eligible student. While FERPA does not require educational agencies and institutions to allow parents or eligible students to bring their attorney or other legal representative with them when they exercise their right to inspect and review the student’s education records, nothing in FERPA prevents educational agencies and institutions from allowing parents or eligible students to bring their attorney or other legal representative with them when they exercise their right to inspect and review the student’s education records under FERPA.\n\n7. Does FERPA permit educational agencies and institutions turn over videos to the police upon request or following an incident that may warrant police involvement?\n\nIf the law enforcement unit of an educational agency or institution creates and maintains videos for a law enforcement purpose, then the videos would not be education records and FERPA would not prohibit the law enforcement unit of an educational agency or institution from disclosing the videos to the police. If the videos are education records, however, educational agencies and institutions may not turn over videos to the police upon request without having first either obtained the written consent of the parent or eligible student or determined that the conditions of an exception to the general requirement of consent have been met, such as if the disclosure is made in connection with a health or safety emergency (20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)(I) and 34 CFR §§ 99.31(a)(10) and 99.36) or the law enforcement officer has presented the educational agency or institution with a judicial order or a lawfully issued subpoena (20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)(J) and (b)(2) and 34 CFR § 99.31(a)(9)).\n\n[1] The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) also contains privacy protections that apply to children with disabilities. 20 U.S.C. 1417(c) and 34 CFR §§ 300.610-300.626 and 34 CFR §§ 303.401-303.416. Under the IDEA, participating agencies must protect the personally identifiable information (PII), data, or records that are collected, maintained, or used by the participating agency. While the definition of “education record” under Part B of the IDEA cross-references the FERPA definition in 34 CFR § 99.3, the application of IDEA requirements may raise different questions.\n\n[2] If circumstances effectively prevent the parent or eligible student from otherwise exercising their right to inspect and review the student’s education records (e.g., if the parent lives outside of commuting distance to the school), then the educational agency or institution would be required to either provide a copy of the records or to make other arrangements for the parent or eligible student to inspect and review the records. 34 CFR § 99.10(d)\n\nHow are Military Recruiter requirements under 10 U.S.C. § 503 enforced?\n\nIn addition to the potential for loss of funds under ESEA for failure to comply with § 9528 of the ESEA, an LEA that denies a military recruiter access to the requested information on students after July 1, 2002, will be subject to specific interventions under 10 U.S.C. § 503.\n\nIn this regard, the law requires that a senior military officer (e.g., Colonel or Navy Captain) visit the LEA within 120 days. If the access problem is not resolved with the LEA, the Department of Defense must notify the state’s Governor within 60 days. Problems still unresolved after one year are reported to Congress, if the Secretary of Defense determines that the LEA denies recruiting access to at least two of the armed forces (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, etc.). The expectation is that public officials will work with the LEA to resolve the problem.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Defense has developed a national high school data base to document recruiter access. Presently, 95 percent of the nation’s 22,000 secondary schools provide a degree of access to military recruiters that is consistent with current law.\n\nHow are the Military Recruiter requirements under § 9528 of the ESEA enforced?\n\nSchools that do not comply with § 9528 of the ESEA could jeopardize their receipt of ESEA funds.\n\nHow does § 544 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 amend the former Military Recruiter requirements under 10 U.S.C. § 503?\n\nThe law’s recruiting provisions apply only to LEAs (including private secondary schools) that receive funds under the ESEA. These provisions require access by military recruiters to students, under certain conditions, and to secondary school students’ names, addresses, and telephone listings. They also require LEAs to notify parents of their right to opt out of the disclosure of their children’s names, addresses, and telephone numbers and to comply with any such requests from the parents or the students.\n\nHow does a school know when a health or safety emergency exists so that a disclosure may be made under this exception to consent?\n\nAn educational agency or institution must make this determination on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the totality of the circumstances pertaining to a threat to the health or safety of a student or others. If the school determines that there is an articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals and that a third party needs personally identifiable information (PII) from education records to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals, it may disclose that information to appropriate parties without consent.\n\nHow long does an educational agency or institution have to comply with a request to view records?\n\nFERPA requires that educational agencies and institutions comply with a request by a parent or eligible student for access to education records within a reasonable period of time, but not more than 45 days after receipt of a request. Some States have laws that may require that parents and eligible students be granted access in a shorter time period. 34 CFR § 99.10(b).\n\nHow long must the Child Welfare Agency (CWA) or tribal organization maintain the education records of a child, and what must the CWA or tribal organization do with the education records when no longer needed?\n\nSome of the FERPA exceptions to consent require the recipient of education records to destroy personally identifiable information (PII) from education records when it is no longer needed. We recommend that the school or LEA and the CWA or tribal organization work together to determine how long the CWA or tribal organization should maintain the education records disclosed under the exception. For example, the CWA or tribal organization could use its standard records retention and destruction guidelines or return the records to the disclosing school or LEA. Further, CWA and tribal organizations should be aware of the potential consequences of improperly redisclosing PII from the education records that are received from the school or LEA under the FERPA exception.\n\nHow may a parent or eligible student file a FERPA complaint with the Department of Education?\n\nA parent or eligible student may file a written complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office regarding an alleged violation under of FERPA. The complaint must be timely (submitted to the office within 180 days of the date that the complainant knew or reasonably knew of the violation) and state clearly and succinctly specific allegations of fact giving reasonable cause to believe that the school has violated FERPA.\n\nI want to use online tool or application as part of my course. However, I am worried that it is a violation of FERPA. What should I do?\n\nA teacher should first check with their school/district administration to see if that application or service is approved for use in the classroom. Any applications or services that collect personally identifiable information (PII) from students’ education records under the school officials exception to prior consent in FERPA must:\n\nProvides a service or function that the school would otherwise use its own staff\n\nBe under the direct control of the school with regard to the use and maintenance of the PII from education records\n\nCollection and use of the PII must be consistent with the school or district’s annual notification of rights under FERPA\n\nNot re-disclose or use the education data for unauthorized purposes.\n\nRemember that the use of some applications or services may introduce security or privacy vulnerabilities into the school or districts IT systems. Teachers should always consult their IT representatives to discuss the use of these types of software tools prior to use to ensure compliance with FERPA requirements and promote a safe, secure computing environment.\n\nIf a parent opts out of the public, non-consensual disclosure of directory information (or any subset of such information), must the three data elements be released to military recruiters upon their request?\n\nIf a parent opts out of providing directory information to third parties, the opt-out relating to name, address, or telephone number applies to requests from military recruiters as well. For example, if the opt-out states that telephone numbers will not be disclosed to the public, schools may not disclose telephone numbers to military recruiters.\n\nIf a school or LEA discloses personally identifiable information (PII) from education records to a community-based organization under a FERPA exception to consent, what and how much PII from education records can it disclose to the organization?\n\nThe school or LEA has discretion under FERPA to decide what and how much PII from education records to disclose to community-based organizations (except in certain cases such as a court order or a subpoena). The school or LEA should determine which data elements are necessary for the activity in question and provide only those elements. Often LEAs and schools will discover that the organization can do the work in question without receiving PII from education records.\n\nIf a video is an education record for multiple students, can the parent of one of the students (or the eligible student) receive a copy of the video?\n\nWhile we do not advise on an educational agency’s or institution’s obligations under any state open records laws that may apply, we note that FERPA does not generally require an educational agency or institution to provide copies of education records to parents and eligible students[1]. That said, it would not violate FERPA for an educational agency or institution to non-consensually disclose to an eligible student or to his or her parents copies of education records that the eligible student or his or her parents otherwise would have the right to inspect and review under FERPA.\n\nFor a fuller legal analysis and explanation of this issue, please see the 2017 Letter to Wachter.\n\n[1] If circumstances effectively prevent the parent or eligible student from otherwise exercising their right to inspect and review the student’s education records (e.g., if the parent lives outside of commuting distance to the school), then the educational agency or institution would be required to either provide a copy of the records or to make other arrangements for the parent or eligible student to inspect and review the records. 34 CFR § 99.10(d)\n\nIf an LEA has not provided notice relating to directory information, may it release a students name, address, and telephone number when requested by a military recruiter?\n\nAn LEA may provide a single notice regarding both directory information and information disclosed to military recruiters. If an LEA does not disclose “directory information” under FERPA, then it must still provide military recruiters access to secondary students’ names, addresses, and telephone listings. In addition, the LEA must notify parents that they may opt out of this disclosure. In other words, an LEA that does not disclose “directory information” must nonetheless provide a notice that it discloses information to military recruiters. The notice must be reasonably calculated to inform parents.\n\nIf redaction or segregation of an education record of multiple students can be reasonably accomplished without destroying the meaning of the education record...\n\ncan educational agencies and institutions charge parents or eligible students for the costs of the redaction or segregation?\n\nNo. FERPA provides parents and eligible students with the right to inspect and review the student’s education records, and nothing in the FERPA statute or regulations permits educational agencies and institutions to charge parents or eligible students for fees or costs associated with exercising that right.\n\nIf a school elects to provide a parent or eligible student with a copy of the education records, then the FERPA regulations (34 CFR § 99.11(a)) generally permit (with the exception noted below) the school to charge for the costs required to make the copy. FERPA regulations (34 CFR § 99.11(b)) also provide that the school may not charge a parent or eligible student for the costs to search for or retrieve the education records. We view the costs, if any, to the school of redacting, or segregating, education records of multiple students as being like the costs of search and retrieval that may not be charged to parents or eligible students, rather than like the costs for copies that generally may be charged to parents and eligible students. As noted above, if an educational agency or institution can reasonably redact or segregate out portions of an education record that is directly related to other students, without destroying the meaning of the record, then the educational agency or institution must do so and therefore cannot charge parents or eligible students for the costs associated with exercising their right to inspect and review such education records.\n\nIn contrast, parents and eligible students generally may be charged for the costs of making copies of education records precisely because FERPA generally does not require the school to provide them with such copies. Thus, where the redaction or segregation of education records of multiple students can be reasonably accomplished without destroying the meaning of the education records, nothing in FERPA permits educational agencies or institutions to charge parents or eligible students for the costs of making the required redactions or segregation. Please note that the FERPA regulations (34 CFR § 99.11(a)) similarly provide that if a fee for copies effectively prevents a parent or an eligible student from exercising the right to inspect and review his or her education records, an educational agency or institution would be required to provide copies without payment. Such cases would be limited to a parent or an eligible student providing evidence of the inability to pay for the copies due to financial hardship.\n\nIf the school does not list one or more of name, address, and telephone listing among its directory information, may it release that information to military recruiters?\n\nIf a school does not designate one or more of the three items as “directory information” under FERPA, it still must provide all three items to military recruiters upon request. Also, in that case, the school would have to send a separate notice to parents about the missing “directory information” item(s), noting an opportunity to opt out of disclosure of the information to military recruiters. An easier method, of course, would be for the school to designate all three items – name, address, and telephone listing – as “directory information.”\n\nIn the case of a divorce, do both parents have rights under FERPA?\n\nGenerally, yes. Unless a school is provided with evidence that there is a court order, state law, or other legally binding document relating to such matters as divorce, separation, or custody that specifically provides to the contrary, FERPA gives custodial and noncustodial parents alike certain rights with respect to their children’s education records. A school may ask for legal certification denoting parenthood, such as a birth certificate or court order, from the parent requesting access.\n\nSource: 34 CFR § 99.4\n\nIs an educational institution or agency permitted to disclose student records without consent to accrediting organizations?\n\nYes, an educational institution or agency is permitted to disclose student records to the extent accrediting organizations need the records in order to carry out their accrediting function.\n\nIs it permissible to release grade point average (GPA) to honors organizations without consent?\n\nNo. FERPA does not generally permit a school to disclose a student’s GPA without the parent’s or eligible student’s consent.\n\nIs prior written consent of the parent or eligible student required to disclose information to community-based organizations?\n\nIn most cases, yes. Written consent is generally required before personally identifiable information (PII) from students’ education records may be disclosed to community-based organizations. Except as set forth in § 99.31 of the regulations and in the statutory exceptions to consent at 20 U.S.C. 1232g, FERPA requires written consent from parents or eligible students before PII from education records are disclosed (34 CFR § 99.30). For activities that do not fit within the statutory exceptions to consent, we recommend that schools, local educational agencies (LEAs), and/or community-based organizations build written consent into the registration process so that when parents sign students up for services offered by a community-based organization, the organization obtains the consent needed to access those education records of the student that will be needed to provide its services to that student.\n\nMay a Child Welfare Agency (CWA) or tribal organization redisclose personally identifiable information (PII) from education records to other individuals or entities?\n\nIn some cases, FERPA does permit a CWA or tribal organization to redisclose PII from education records for a limited purpose. Specifically, it provides that redisclosures may only be made to an individual or entity “engaged in addressing the student’s education needs” and authorized by such agency or organization to receive such disclosure and such disclosure must be consistent with the state or tribal laws applicable to protecting the confidentiality of a student’s education records. 20 U.S.C. § 1232g(b)(1)(L).\n\nMay a Child Welfare Agency (CWA) or tribal organization that receives personally identifiable information (PII) from education records through the exception in FERPA use the PII for purposes other than addressing the education needs of the child?\n\nNo. FERPA is clear that the PII from education records disclosed to the CWA or tribal organization under the 2013 exception to FERPA must only be used to address the educational needs of children in foster care placement.\n\nMay a parent or eligible student have an attorney at an amendment hearing?\n\nYes, the parent or eligible student may, at their own expense, be assisted or represented by one or more individuals of his or her own choice, including an attorney.\n\nMay a postsecondary institution disclose financial aid records without written consent?\n\nFERPA permits institutions to disclose, without consent, personally identifiable information from students’ education records when the disclosure is in connection with a student's application for, or receipt of, financial aid. Disclosures under this exception to consent may be made if the information is necessary for such purposes as to: (a) determine eligibility for the aid; (b) determine the amount of the aid; (c) determine the conditions for the aid; or (d) enforce the terms and conditions of the aid.\n\nMay a postsecondary institution disclose information about a disciplinary proceeding to the victim of a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense?\n\nYes, a postsecondary institution may disclose only the final results of the disciplinary proceeding to a victim of an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense. The institution may disclose to the victim the final results of the disciplinary proceeding regardless of whether the institution concluded a violation was committed.\n\nMay a school disclose de-identified data to community-based organization?\n\nYes. Schools do not need to obtain written consent or to inform parents or eligible students when releasing properly de-identified information.\n\nMay a school disclose directory information to a community-based organization without written consent?\n\nGenerally, yes. FERPA allows schools that have adopted directory information policies to disclose properly designated directory information without consent on students whose parents (or eligible students) have not opted out of the disclosure of directory information. See § 99.37(a). However, if a school adopts a directory information policy specifying that disclosure of directory information will be limited to specific parties, for specific purposes, or both, then the school is required to limit its directory information disclosures to those specified in its public notice. See § 99.37(d).\n\nMay a school make disclosures under FERPA’s health or safety emergency provision for emergency preparedness exercises?\n\nNo. Disclosures made under the health or safety emergency provision must be “in connection with an emergency,” which means it must be related to an actual, impending, or imminent emergency, such as a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, a campus shooting, or the outbreak of an epidemic disease.\n\nMay a social security number or other student identification number be listed as directory information?\n\nA school may not designate a student’s social security number as directory information. However, directory information may include a student’s user ID or other unique identifier used by the student to access or communicate in electronic systems, but only if the electronic identifier cannot be used to gain access to education records except when used in conjunction with one or more factors that authenticate the student’s identity, such as a personal identification number (PIN), password, or other factor known or possessed only by the student or authorized user. 34 CFR § 99.3\n\nMay an educational agency or institution disclose directory information without prior consent?\n\nEducation records that have been appropriately designated as \"directory information\" by the educational agency or institution may be disclosed without prior consent. See 34 CFR §§ 99.31(a)(11) and 99.37. FERPA defines directory information as information contained in an education record of a student that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. 34 CFR § 99.3.\n\nFERPA provides that a school may disclose directory information if it has given public notice of the types of information which it has designated as \"directory information,\" the parent or eligible student’s right to restrict the disclosure of such information, and the period of time within which a parent or eligible student has to notify the school in writing that he or she does not want any or all of those types of information designated as \"directory information.\" 34 CFR § 99.37(a). A school is not required to inform former students or the parents of former students regarding directory information or to honor their request that directory information not be disclosed without consent. 34 CFR § 99.37(b). However, if a parent or eligible student, within the specified time period during the student's last opportunity as a student in attendance, requested that directory information not be disclosed, the school must honor that request until otherwise notified.\n\nMay an educational agency or institution disclose education records if they are involved in litigation against a parent of student or an eligible student?\n\nYes, the educational agency or institution may disclose to the court the education records of the student that are relevant for the educational agency or institution to proceed with or defend against the legal action. 34 CFR § 99.31(a)(9)(iii).\n\nMay an educational agency or institution disclose information over the phone?\n\nWhile FERPA does not specifically prohibit a school from disclosing personally identifiable information from a student’s education records over the telephone, it does require that the school use reasonable methods to identify and authenticate the identity of parents, students, school officials, and any other parties to whom the school discloses personally identifiable information from education records. 34 CFR § 99.31(c).\n\nMay an educational agency or institution disclose personally identifiable information from students education records for the purpose of a specified audit, evaluation, or for compliance and enforcement purposes under FERPA?\n\nFERPA permits schools to disclose PII from students’ education records, without consent, to authorized representatives of state and local educational authorities, the Secretary of Education, the Comptroller General of the United States, and the Attorney General of the United States for specified purposes. Disclosures may be made under this exception as necessary in connection with the audit or evaluation off federal- or state-supported education programs, or in connection with the enforcement of federal legal requirements that relate to those programs. 34 CFR §§ 99.31(a)(3) and 99.35.\n\nMay an educational agency or institution disclose personally identifiable information from students education records to third parties for the purpose of conducting a study on its behalf?\n\nFERPA contains an exception to its general consent rule under which an educational agency or institution may disclose personally identifiable information from education records without consent to organizations conducting studies for, or on its behalf. Studies must be only for the purpose of: developing, validating, or administering predictive tests; administering student aid programs; or improving instruction. A written agreement with the organization is required, specifying the purposes of the study and the use and destruction of the information. 34 CFR § 99.31(a)(6)\n\nMay an LEA non-consensually disclose personally identifiable information (PII) from education records to a community-based organization in order to conduct an audit or evaluation of the school system’s education programs?\n\nYes. FERPA’s audit or evaluation exception allows an LEA to designate a community-based organization as its authorized representative and disclose PII from education records without consent of parents or eligible students to audit or evaluate a federal- or state-supported education program, or to enforce or comply with federal legal requirements that relate to those education programs (audit, evaluation, or enforcement or compliance activity). See 34 CFR § 99.35. (This provision does not apply to individual schools that are not considered local educational authorities under state or local law.)\n\nMay an SEA redisclose, on behalf of its LEAs, the education records of students in foster care placement to the students’ Child Welfare Agencies (CWAs) or tribal organizations that are legally responsible for their care and protection?\n\nYes. An SEA may redisclose personally identifiable information (PII) from the education records of students in foster care placement to a CWA or tribal organization that is legally responsible for the care and protection of the student. The disclosure must be made on behalf of the LEA, as permitted under § 99.33(b)(1) of the FERPA regulations.\n\nMay parents or eligible students be provided access to education records that contain information on more than one student?\n\nIf the education records of a student contain personally identifiable information on other students, the parent or eligible student may inspect or review or be informed of only the specific information about the student in question. 34 CFR § 99.12.\n\nMay postsecondary institutions disclose results of disciplinary proceedings?\n\nPostsecondary institutions may disclose the final results of disciplinary proceedings if the institution has found that the student has violated the institution’s rules or policies in regard to a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense. However, the institution may not disclose the name of any other student, including a victim or witness, without the prior written consent of that student.\n\nMay schools comply with a subpoena or court order for education records without the consent of the parent or eligible student?\n\nYes. FERPA permits disclosure of education records without consent in compliance with a lawfully issued subpoena or judicial order. See § 99.31(a)(9)(i) and (ii).\n\nMay schools publish honors and awards received by a student?\n\nSchools may disclose honors and awards received by students if it has properly designated “honors and awards” as a category in its directory information policy and has followed the requirements in FERPA for notifying parents and/or eligible students about the policy.\n\nMay the community-based organization receiving personally identifiable information (PII) from education records redisclose PII from education records without written consent?\n\nNo. Regardless of whether the community-based organization received the PII under the school official, studies, or audit/evaluation exception, the answer is the same – the community-based organization may not redisclose it unless such redisclosure is on behalf of the disclosing entity and is consistent with FERPA. (34 CFR § 99.33). If further redisclosure is contemplated, we recommend that provisions addressing authorized redisclosures be included in any agreement with the community-based organization.\n\nMay the LEA disclose personally identifiable information (PII) from education records to a community-based organization under the audit or evaluation exception for the purpose of the community-based organization evaluating its own program?\n\nGenerally, no. The audit or evaluation by an community-based organization of its own program (i.e., to determine whether or not the organization’s program is effective) in most cases would not be permitted under the audit or evaluation exception because the audit or evaluation exception only permits the audit or evaluation of federal- or state-supported education programs, which FERPA defines as any program principally engaged in the provision of education, including, but not limited to, early childhood education, elementary and secondary education, postsecondary education, special education, job training, career and technical education, and adult education, and any program that is administered by an educational agency or institution.\n\nMay the school or LEA non-consensually disclose personally identifiable information (PII) from education records to a community-based organization that is conducting a study for the school or LEA?\n\nYes. The studies exception allows for the disclosure of PII from education records without consent to community-based organizations conducting studies for, or on behalf of, the school or LEA. FERPA limits the purpose of the studies conducted under this exception to: (1) developing, validating, or administering predictive tests; (2) administering student aid programs; or (3) improving instruction. See 34 CFR § 99.31(a)(6)(i).\n\nMust a school have a written agreement or contract with a community-based organization to which it non-consensually discloses education records to outsource an institutional service under the school official exception?\n\nNo. While FERPA does not require written agreements or contracts when a school chooses to outsource an institutional service or function to a community-based organization under the “school official” exception, it is a best practice to do so. Written agreements help ensure that the community-based organization understands its obligations and responsibilities with respect to the use of and privacy protections accorded to the FERPA protected information. Further, appropriate contractual provisions can establish the direct control required by FERPA under this exception. Additionally, local or state policies or laws may require the use of written agreements or contracts for procurement.\n\nMust a school inform parents and eligible students if the school non-consensually discloses personally identifiable information from their education records to a community-based organization to which the school has outsourced an institutional service?\n\nNo. While there is no specific notification requirement regarding disclosures under the exceptions to consent, FERPA does require that each school or LEA annually notify parents and eligible students of their rights under FERPA. 34 CFR § 99.7. As a part of the annual notice, the school or LEA must include in the notification a specification of the criteria for determining who constitutes a school official and what constitutes a legitimate educational interest. 34 CFR § 99.7(3)(iii).\n\nMust a school or LEA record the non-consensual disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) from education records to a community-based organization?\n\nYes. Generally, when a school or LEA discloses without consent PII from education records to a community-based organization, with the exception of disclosures made under the “school official” exception, the disclosure must be recorded. FERPA require schools to record all requests for access to, and all disclosures of, PII from the education records of each student, except for disclosures to school officials, disclosures related to some judicial orders or lawfully issued subpoenas, disclosures of directory information, and disclosures to the parent or eligible student. See 34 CFR § 99.32(d). Schools and LEAs must maintain these records with the student’s education records for as long as the student’s records are maintained. The recorded information must include the parties who have requested or received PII and their legitimate interests in requesting or obtaining the information. Parents and eligible students have a right to inspect and review the record of disclosures. See 34 CFR § 99.32 for the full list of recordation requirements.\n\nMust an educational agency or institution have a written agreement to disclose personally identifiable information (PII) from education records without consent for the purposes of conducting a study or an audit or evaluation of an education program?\n\nYes. Both the studies exception and the audit or evaluation exception specifically require that the parties execute a written agreement when disclosing PII from education records without consent.\n\nMust educational agencies and institutions record any disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) from education records to the Child Welfare Agencies (CWAs) or tribal organization?\n\nYes. FERPA requires recordkeeping on requests for access to and disclosures of education records. See § 99.32. Thus, if a school discloses education records to the Child Welfare Agency (CWA) or tribal organization under this exception, the school must be compliant with the recordation requirements under FERPA and also must include: (1) the parties who have requested or received PII from the education records, and (2) the legitimate interests the parties had in requesting or obtaining the information. If an educational agency or institution discloses PII from education records with the understanding that further disclosures will be made, the educational agency’s or institution’s record of disclosure must include the names and legitimate interests of the additional parties.\n\nMust postsecondary institutions provide a parent with access to an eligible student’s education records?\n\nWhile the rights under FERPA transfer from the parents to the student when the student turns 18 or enrolls in a postsecondary institution at any age, FERPA provides ways in which an institution can share education records on the student with his or her parents. Schools may disclose any and all information to parents, without the consent of the eligible student, if the student is a dependent for tax purposes under the IRS rules. FERPA also permits a school to disclose information from an eligible student’s education records to parents if a health or safety emergency involves their son or daughter. Another provision in FERPA permits a college or university to let parents of students under the age of 21 know when the student has violated any law or policy concerning the use of possession of alcohol or a controlled substance. School officials may also share information with a parent about an eligible student that is based on that official’s personal knowledge or observation and that is not based on information contained in an education record.\n\nMust the Child Welfare Agency (CWA) or tribal organization record any redisclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) from education records made by the welfare agency or tribal organization to an individual or entity?\n\nNo. FERPA does not require the CWA or tribal organization to record any redisclosure of PII from education records that it may make to an individual or entity, such as a contractor providing services to address a student’s education needs. However, if the CWA or tribal organization does redisclose PII from an education record on a student in foster care placement to anyone other than an agency- or organization-employed caseworker or other representative who has the right to access a student’s case plan, the Department recommends, as a good data management practice, that the CWA or tribal organization record the redisclosure and inform the school of the redisclosure for record keeping purposes.\n\nMust the LEA ensure that a community-based organization designated as its authorized representative complies with FERPA?\n\nYes. Before the LEA discloses personally identifiable information (PII) from education records to a community-based organization designated as an authorized representative, the LEA is required to use “reasonable methods” to ensure to the greatest extent practicable that the community-based organization is FERPA-compliant. This specifically means ensuring that the community-based organization:\n\nUses PII from education records only to carry out an audit or evaluation of federal- or state-supported education programs, or for the enforcement of or compliance with, federal legal requirements related to these programs. The LEA should make sure that the proposed audit or evaluation is legitimate, and require in the written agreement that the community-based organization use the PII from education records only for that audit, evaluation, or enforcement or compliance activity.\n\nProtects the PII from education records from further disclosures or other uses, except as authorized by the LEA in accordance with FERPA. The agreement must specify that the community-based organization may not further disclose the PII from education records, unless authorized.\n\nDestroys the PII from education records when no longer needed for the audit, evaluation, or enforcement or compliance activity. The agreement must specify that the community-based organization is required to destroy the PII from education records when it is no longer needed and specify the time period in which the PII must be destroyed. See 34 CFR § 99.35(a)(2).\n\nMust the LEA have a written agreement with the community-based organization prior to disclosing personally identifiable information (PII) from education records under the Audit Evaluation Exception?\n\nYes. The LEA must use a written agreement to designate the community-based organization as its authorized representative. The written agreement must include certain mandatory components as described in § 99.35(a)(3)(ii) of the regulations. The specific policies and procedures outlined in the agreement should be consistent with FERPA and all other applicable laws.) For additional information, see § 99.35 of the regulations\n\nMust the school or LEA have a written agreement with the community-based organization conducting the study?\n\nYes. Written agreements are required under the studies exception, §99.31(a)(6)(iii)(C), and must\n\nSpecify the purpose, scope, and duration of the study and the information to be disclosed.\n\nRequire the community-based organization to use personally identifiable information (PII) from education records only to meet the purpose(s) of the study as stated in the written agreement.\n\nRequire the community-based organization to conduct the study in a manner that does not permit the personal identification of parents and students by anyone other than representatives of the organization with legitimate interests. This typically means that the organization should allow internal access to PII from education records only to individuals with a need to know, and that the organization should take steps to maintain the confidentiality of the PII from education records at all stages of the study.\n\nRequire the community-based organization to destroy all PII from education records when the information is no longer needed for the purposes for which the study was conducted, and specify the time period in which the information must be destroyed.\n\nMust the SEA record the redisclosure of education records to the Child Welfare Agency (CWA) or tribal organization?\n\nYes. Section 99.32(b)(2)(i) of the FERPA regulations generally requires that an SEA that makes further disclosures of personally identifiable information (PII) from education records must record the names of the additional parties (e.g., the CWA) to which it discloses PII from education records on behalf of the LEA and their legitimate interests in the information under FERPA. However, the SEA would not have to make a record of the redisclosure if the LEA had made a record of the disclosure to the SEA and included in that record the name of the CWA or tribal organization and its legitimate interest (i.e., to permit the CWA or tribal organization to address the education needs of the child) to which the additional disclosure of the education records would be made.\n\nPreguntas frecuentes sobre fotos y videos bajo FERPA\n\n1. ¿Cuándo una foto o un video de un estudiante es un registro educativo según FERPA?\n\nAl igual que con cualquier otro “registro educativo”, una foto o un video de un estudiante es un registro educativo, sujeto a exclusiones específicas, cuando la foto o el video: (1) está directamente relacionado con un estudiante; y (2) mantenido por una agencia o institución educativa o por una parte que actúa en nombre de la agencia o institución. (20 U.S.C. 1232g(a)(4)(A); 34 CFR § 99.3 “Registro educativo [Education Record]”)[1]\n\nDirectamente relacionado con un estudiante:\n\nCuando hacen referencia a los registros educativos, las regulaciones de FERPA no definen exactamente lo que significa ser “directamente relacionado” a un estudiante. En el contexto de fotografías y videos, determinar si una representación visual de un estudiante está directamente relacionada con un estudiante (en lugar de tan solo incidentalmente relacionada con él o ella) a menudo es específico del contexto, y las agencias e instituciones educativas deben examinar ciertos tipos de fotografías y videos caso por caso para determinar si se relacionan directamente con alguno de los estudiantes representados en ellos. Entre los factores que pueden ayudar a determinar si las fotos o videos deben considerarse “directamente relacionados” con un estudiante se encuentran los siguientes:\n\nLa agencia o institución educativa utiliza la foto o el video para medidas disciplinarias (u otros fines oficiales) que involucren al estudiante (incluida la víctima de dicho incidente disciplinario);\n\nLa foto o el vídeo contiene una descripción de una actividad:\n\nque haya resultado en el uso de la foto o el video por parte de una agencia o institución educativa para medidas disciplinarias (u otros fines oficiales) que involucren a un estudiante (o, si hay medidas disciplinarias pendientes o aún no se han tomado, que razonablemente resultarían en el uso de la foto o el video para la acción disciplinaria que involucra a un estudiante);\n\nque muestre que un estudiante ha violado las leyes locales, estatales o federales;\n\nque muestre a un estudiante siendo lesionado, atacado, victimizado, enfermo o teniendo una emergencia de salud;\n\nLa persona o entidad que toma la foto o el video tiene la intención de convertir a un estudiante específico en el centro de la foto o el video (por ejemplo, fotografías de identificación o una grabación de una presentación de un estudiante); o\n\nEl contenido visual o de audio de la foto o video contiene información de identificación personal contenida en el registro educativo de un estudiante.\n\nThe person or entity taking the photo or video intends to make a specific student the focus of the photo or video (e.g., ID photos, or a recording of a student presentation); or\n\nUna foto o video no debe considerarse directamente relacionado con un estudiante en ausencia de estos factores y si la imagen del estudiante es incidental o capturada solo como parte del fondo, o si se muestra a un estudiante participando en actividades escolares que están abiertas al público y sin un enfoque específico en ningún individuo.\n\nEjemplos de situaciones que pueden hacer que un video sea un registro educativo:\n\nUn video de vigilancia escolar que muestra a dos estudiantes peleando en un pasillo, utilizado como parte de una acción disciplinaria, está directamente relacionado con la pelea de los estudiantes.\n\nUn video en el aula que muestra a un estudiante sufriendo una convulsión está directamente relacionado con ese estudiante porque la emergencia de salud representada se convierte en el foco del video.\n\nSi una escuela mantiene una fotografía en primer plano de dos o tres estudiantes jugando baloncesto con una vista general de los estudiantes espectadores al fondo, la foto está directamente relacionada con los jugadores de baloncesto porque son el foco de la foto, pero no está directamente relacionado con los estudiantes que se muestran al fondo. Las escuelas a menudo designan fotografías o videos de estudiantes que participan en eventos públicos (por ejemplo, eventos deportivos, conciertos, representaciones teatrales, etc.) como información del directorio y/u obtienen el consentimiento de los padres o estudiantes elegibles para divulgar públicamente fotografías o videos de estos eventos.\n\nUna grabación de video de una reunión de profesores durante la cual se discuten las calificaciones de un estudiante específico está directamente relacionada con ese estudiante porque la discusión contiene Información de Identificación Personal (PII) del expediente educativo del estudiante.\n\nMantenido por una agencia o institución educativa:\n\nPara ser considerado un registro educativo según FERPA, una agencia o institución educativa, o una parte que actúe en nombre de la agencia o institución, también debe mantener el registro. Por lo tanto, una fotografía tomada por un padre en un partido de fútbol escolar no se consideraría un registro educativo, incluso si está directamente relacionada con un estudiante en particular, porque la escuela no la mantiene ni tampoco el padre la mantiene a nombre de la escuela. Sin embargo, si la fotografía de los padres muestra a dos estudiantes peleando en el juego, y el padre proporciona una copia de la fotografía a la escuela, que luego mantiene la fotografía en los registros disciplinarios de los estudiantes, entonces la copia de la fotografía que mantiene la escuela es un registro educativo.\n\nExclusión de registros de la unidad de cumplimento de la ley (policía de la escuela)\n\nEl estatuto y los reglamentos de FERPA (20 U.S.C. 1232g(a)(4)(B)(ii) y 34 CFR §§ 99.3 y 99.8) excluyen de la definición de registros educativos aquellos registros creados y mantenidos por una unidad de cumplimiento de la ley (unidad policial) de un agencia o institución educativa con fines de aplicación de la ley. Por lo tanto, si una unidad policial de una agencia o institución educativa crea y mantiene videos de vigilancia de la escuela con fines policiales, dichos videos no se considerarán registros educativos. Si la unidad policial proporciona una copia del video a otro componente dentro de la agencia o institución educativa (por ejemplo, para mantener el registro en relación con una acción disciplinaria), entonces la copia del video puede convertirse en un registro educativo de el/los estudiante(s) involucrado(s) si el video no está sujeto a ninguna otra exclusión de la definición de \"registros educativos\" y el video está: (1) directamente relacionado con un estudiante; y (2) mantenido por una agencia o institución educativa o por una parte que actúa en nombre de la agencia o institución.\n\n2. ¿Puede la misma imagen grabada ser el registro educativo de más de un estudiante según FERPA?\n\nSí. Por ejemplo, un video de vigilancia que muestra a dos estudiantes peleando en un autobús escolar que la escuela usa y mantiene para disciplinar a los dos estudiantes estaría “directamente relacionado” y, por lo tanto, ser parte del expediente educativo de ambos estudiantes.\n\n3. Si un video es un registro educativo para varios estudiantes, ¿puede ver el video un padre de uno de los estudiantes o el estudiante elegible?\n\nPor lo general, cuando un video es un registro educativo de varios estudiantes, la FERPA requiere que la agencia o institución educativa da acceso a un padre o un estudiante elegible a inspeccionar y revisar, o “ser informado” del contenido del video, a petición de un padre particular de un estudiante (o de un estudiante si es un estudiante elegible) de que el video se relacione directamente, en conformidad con las disposiciones legales de FERPA en 20 U.S.C. § 1232g(a)(1)(A) y las normas reglamentarias en 34 CFR § 99.12(a). Aun así, generalmente, la FERPA no requiere que la agencia o institución educativa da copias del video a los padres o al estudiante elegible.\n\nAl brindar acceso al video, la agencia o institución educativa debe brindarle al padre del estudiante (o al estudiante si el estudiante es un estudiante elegible) la oportunidad de inspeccionar y revisar o \"ser informados\" del contenido del video. Si la agencia o institución educativa puede redactar o segregar razonablemente las partes del video directamente relacionadas con otros estudiantes, sin destruir el significado del registro, entonces la agencia o institución educativa debe hacerlo antes de proporcionar acceso al padre o al estudiante elegible. Por otro lado, si no se puede lograr razonablemente la redacción o segregación del video, o si hacerlo destruiría el significado del registro, entonces los padres de cada estudiante con quien el video se relaciona directamente (o los propios estudiantes si son estudiantes elegibles) tendrían derecho bajo FERPA a inspeccionar y revisar o “ser informados” de todo el expediente, aunque también se relacione directamente con otros estudiantes.\n\nPara obtener un análisis legal más completo y una explicación de este problema, consulte la Carta a Wachter de 2017.\n\n4. Si un video es un registro educativo para varios estudiantes, ¿puede el padre de uno de los estudiantes (o el estudiante elegible) recibir una copia del video?\n\nSi bien no asesoramos sobre las obligaciones de"
