        "text": "Promoters of fraudulent business opportunities run ads where their targets are likely to see them: in daily and weekly newspapers, in magazines, and on the Internet.

Industry members also should consider long-standing FTC guidance regarding products collected from the wild state.\n\nSome resumes list credentials — like a college degree or professional certification — that sound credible, but were bought from “diploma mills.” Human resources professionals need to educate themselves on the steps to take to suss out suspect degrees.\n\nIf the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent an ad from being deceptive, the disclosure must be clear and conspicuous. Read more about why fine print is not so fine in advertising and what you need to do to disclose the details of the deal.\n\nDo you have questions about multi-level marketing? The FTC staff has guidance to help members of the MLM industry apply core consumer protection principles to their business practices.\n\nDo you sell products by mail, by phone, or online?

This guide explains the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, the federal law governing warranties on consumer products.\n\nIf you use email in your business, you need to know about the CAN-SPAM Act. The law establishes requirements for commercial messages and gives recipients the right to have you stop emailing them. The FTC enforces the CAN-SPAM Act and the accompanying CAN-SPAM Rule.\n\nThe Consumer Review Fairness Act protects consumers’ ability to share their honest opinions about a business’s products, services, or conduct in any forum – and that includes social media. The FTC has tips to help your company comply with the law.\n\nPeople who rely on online reviews of companies, products, and services should be getting an accurate picture of what other consumers think. If you operate a website or platform that features reviews, have processes in place to ensure those reviews truly reflect the feedback received from genuine customers.\n\nThe primary purpose of the FTC’s CARS Rule is to add truth and transparency to the car buying or leasing process by making it clear that certain deceptive or unfair practices are illegal – for example, bait-and-switch tactics, hidden charges, and other conduct that harms consumers and honest dealers. Why is it called the CARS Rule? Because the Rule is about Combating Auto Retail Scams that cost consumers billions of dollars each year and cause honest dealers to lose business.\n\nIf your business is an online marketplace or a \"high-volume third party seller\" on one of those platforms, the INFORM Consumers Act requires certain information collection, verification, and disclosure requirements.\n\nMarketers and publishers are using innovative methods to create, format, and deliver digital advertising. One form is “native advertising,” content that bears a similarity to the news, feature articles, product reviews, entertainment, and other material that surrounds it online. But as native advertising evolves, are consumers able to differentiate advertising from other content?\n\nThis article is part of the FTC’s efforts to help small business owners avoid scams. It explains common scams that target small businesses and non-profit organizations, describes scammers’ tactics, and provides steps people can take to protect their company from scams. Copies can be ordered for free at ftc.gov/bulkorder.\n\nDo you know the buzz words that may be a tip-off to a rip-off? By spotting – and stopping – deceptive ads before they run in your publication or on your station, your sales staff can help maintain your reputation for accuracy."
