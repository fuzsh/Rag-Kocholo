The module sets out the structures of the EU constitutional order which enable it to act internationally and establish relations with third countries and international organisations. The analysis starts with the examination of the theoretical foundations of external EU policies and focuses on the EU competences and the scope and content of the Common Commercial Policy. In this context, students are expected to obtain knowledge of the EU's external relations legislation and its operation in practice. In this respect, the module aims to identify the frameworks for cooperation with third countries and international organisations with an emphasis on the participation of the EU in the WTO. Further, the module aims to analyse the basic autonomous instruments of trade policy, like customs legislation, rules on imports and exports and measures taken against unfair trade like dumping and subsidies.\n\nContent\n\nThe content of the module will typically be:\n\nA) Foundations\n\nIntroduction to the Union Legal Order\n\nLegal personality and the Community competence to act on the international plane\n\nThe classification of Community competences\n\nThe Common Commercial Policy\n\nThe negotiation and conclusion of international agreements. Mixed international agreements\n\nThe effect on international agreements in the Community legal order. The special case of the WTO Agreement\n\nB) Frameworks\n\nBilateral Agreements as a preliminary to membership\n\nOther Bilateral Agreements\n\nMultilateral Agreements and Membership of International Organisations\n\nCase study: The EU and the WTO\n\nC) Policies Commercial Policy in practice\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nSubject-specific Knowledge:\n\nStudents will obtain knowledge of the theoretical foundations of the EU's external relations policies; they will possess an advanced understanding of the EU external competences and the scope and content of the Common Commercial Policy; they will be able to identify the frameworks for international cooperation with third countries and international organisations available to the EU with an emphasis on EU participation in the WTO; they will obtain detailed knowledge of the EU's autonomous trade legislation in the field of customs, rules on imports and exports and rules against unfair trade like dumping and subsidies.\n\nSubject-specific Skills:\n\nStudents will develop subject-specific intellectual skills. They will be able to accurately and effectively describe the constitutional underpinnings of the European Union as an actor in the world trading system; they will be able to identify the legal basis for EU external action in any given case; they will be able to advise on the procedures available to the EU to defend its interests on the international trading plane and in particular in the WTO; they will be able to identify the rules and procedures applicable in areas involving EU trade policies.\n\nKey Skills:\n\nStudents will be able to retrieve and utilise sources in the field of EU external trade relations; they will be able to identify resources on their own initiative; develop oral communication skills; they will be self-reliant, able to take responsibility of their own learning.\n\nModes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute to the learning outcomes of the module\n\nTeaching and learning will take place by virtue of a combination of lectures, seminars and tutorials. The lectures will introduce the basic concepts and provide basic information. Students will be provided with the basic subject-specific knowledge, guidance towards further reading and sources of information, available both in print and electronically, and encouragement to pursue independent learning. Seminars and tutorials, which will require student preparation in advance, are aimed to enable students to assess the progress of their own learning. In particular, they will be invited to describe the theoretical foundations of the EU external trade relations, to identify the legal basis for EU external action in any given case, to identify the rules and procedures applicable in areas involving EU trade policies.\n\nSummative assessment consists of a 3-hour exam. The exam will typically consist of a selection of essay and problem questions and students will be required to answer at least one question from each category. Essay questions aim to assess the students' subject-specific knowledge and their ability to describe, identify and analyse the relevant concepts and rules. Problem questions aim to assess the students' ability to identify the rules applicable in a given case and apply their theoretical knowledge in practice.\n\nTeaching Methods and Learning Hours\n\nActivity Number Frequency Duration Total/Hours Lectures 2 When appropriate, to introduce module subsections 1 2 ■ Tutorials 2 In regular intervals 1 2 ■ Seminars 13 Weekly 2 26 ■ Preparation and Reading 270 Total 300\n\nSummative Assessment\n\nComponent: Essay Component Weighting: 40% Element Length / duration Element Weighting Resit Opportunity Essay 3000 words 100% Component: Unseen Written Examination Component Weighting: 60% Element Length / duration Element Weighting Resit Opportunity Unseen Written Examination 1 hour 30 mins 100%\n\nFormative Assessment:\n\nNone."
