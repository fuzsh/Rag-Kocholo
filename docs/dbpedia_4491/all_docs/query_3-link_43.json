Students will explore the principles of lifecycle assessment (LCA) and circular economy to understand their impact on environmental sustainability. Utilizing collaborative group projects, students will engage in creating circular economy solutions, implementing LCA software tools for analyzing product design, and developing strategies to minimize waste and gas emissions. The course aims to equip students with a critical understanding of sustainable development challenges and the skills to innovate for a greener future.\n\nStudents learn:\n\nFundamentals of sustainability and renewable energy; LCA methodologies, circular economy principles and their applications.\n\nLearn and use of industry LCA software (openLCA) to quantify environmental impacts.\n\nTeamwork and collaboration, including strategies to collect and analyze data, develop sustainable strategies for product design, and visually and verbally present the results.\n\nAnalyze case studies to extract sustainability lessons, and create new solutions.\n\nInstructors: Professor Hejintao Huang and Cooper Union Undergraduate Teaching Assistants\n\nParticipants: Students currently enrolled in 10th or 11th grade in the 2023-2024 school year.\n\nSession information: This six-week program offers one session starting Monday, July 8, 2024. Classes meet Monday - Thursday, 9 am to 3 pm.\n\nPrerequisites: none\n\nTeaching method: In person. The instructor and teaching assistants will lead students through lectures, discussions, and hands on activities at 41 Cooper Square.\n\nMaterials: All materials are included. Students can opt to bring a personal computer.\n\nSTEM24-1\n\nSustainable Futures\n\nAs the world’s population grows, the grand challenges of maintaining the progression of civilization while simultaneously enhancing the quality of life become more pressing. The planet we live on has such finite resources that its growing population is depleting them at an unsustainable rate. This course addresses the urgent need for sustainable practices in product design and development.

Students explore college, learn about engineering research and develop problem solving skills using engineering design practices. Students also learn sketching, technical drawing, computer-aided design and strategies for communicating ideas. By the end of the program, student teams will identify a problem, design and fabricate a solution, and create a presentation to share how they imagine and engineer a better world.\n\nStudents learn:\n\nDrawing and Computer Aided Design (CAD)\n\nPrototyping and fabrication, including 3D printing\n\nEngineering design and decision-making tools\n\nInstructors: Professor Matt Grattan, Professor Anastasiya Islamova, and Cooper Union student teaching assistants\n\nParticipants: Students in 9th grade in the 2023-2024 school year.\n\nSession information: This Three-week program offers two sessions. Session 1 starts Monday, July 8, 2024. Session 2 starts Monday, July 29, 2024. Classes meet Monday - Thursday, 9 am to 3 pm.\n\nPrerequisites: none.\n\nTeaching method: In person. The instructor and teaching assistants will lead students through daily scheduled lectures, discussions, and practice sessions at 41 Cooper Square. Off campus field trips and site visits will also be scheduled.\n\nMaterials: All materials are included. Students may opt to bring a personal computer.\n\nCost: $1950\n\nApply now: https://connect.cooper.edu/apply/\n\nRead the Summer STEM FAQs\n\nSTEM24-3\n\nLinear Algebra for Engineering Research\n\nDesigned for students interested in research, this course will cover topics in introductory linear algebra and their applications to mathematics, science and engineering. Students will learn about vectors, systems of equations, linear transformations, matrix algebra, determinants and vector spaces and apply them to an engineering research problem.\n\nTopics covered:\n\nAlgebra of vectors and matrices\n\nSolving systems of equations using matrices\n\nUnderstanding the algebraic and geometric views linear algebra\n\nCollaboration and study skills for college\n\nInstructors: Dr. Michael Kumaresan, Cooper Union Alumni and Adjunct Faculty, and Cooper Union student teaching assistants\n\nParticipants: Students in 10th, 11th or 12th grade during the 2023-2024 school year can apply. 12th grade students beginning college in the fall 2024 for an engineering or STEM major are encouraged to apply.
