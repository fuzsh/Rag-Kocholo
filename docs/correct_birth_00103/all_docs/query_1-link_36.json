        "text": "The energy crisis together with inflation and expanding indebtedness are significant economic but also social challenges and risks in the Czech Republic. The briefing analyses the main political measures addressing the rocketing prices of energythe introduction of a price ceiling and windfall tax. Attention is paid to the energy policy of the incumbent cabinet and concrete steps that are to offset the suspension of supplies from Russia. The anti-Russian position requires seeking alternative sources of gas which is seen especially in LNG supplies from the US, however at much higher prices. At the same time, possible diversification can be a positive result of the current unfavourable circumstances.\n\nEnergy is main resources for economy development in every country and have important and significant influence in all societies. The well-being of people, industry and economy depends on safe, secure, sustainable and available energy. Energy sector plays an important role for the Czech Republic’s economy and for the regional energy security. The country has established a commitment with the EU to achieve an 8% share of electricity generated from RES in domestic electricity generation by 2010 and achieve a share of 13% of energy made from RES per final consumption before 2020. This paper deals with renewable energy sources in general and with special emphasis on renewable energy sources in the Czech Republic.\n\nIn this dissertation I study why countries under comparable international conditions prioritize energy security differently. Why do their domestic responses of coping with structural position of energy import dependence vary over time, and what explains the type of variation and its timing? By answering these questions, this dissertation contributes to the broader research field on temporal and spatial variation of domestic responses to comparable international conditions. In order to understand the factors of prioritizing security in energy policy, and their facilitating and inhibiting conditions in countries in transition, through case selection, I isolate effects of fundamentals and external factors. As I observe in the Central and East European countries in transition, policies enhancing energy security are prioritized when three aspects coincide and interact: When popular perception of threat, which can plausibly be connected to the energy supply, is high and concentrated among supporters of ruling parties; when former elites who can draw on personal links with the perceived source of threat, and thus can dampen the effects of threat, are removed from power; and when incumbent industrial interests are de-concentrated and face obstacles in promoting their interests. I also argue that specific timing of change of ownership lowering the control of government over energy assets i.e. privatization, was an obstacle to prioritizing policies aiming to increasing energy security. The broader theoretical contribution of this dissertation consists of argument for reframing the energy policy debate by bringing back domestic politics, and by contributing to understanding of security policy prioritization during transition. Energy security, albeit important, is only one of the aspects that are being pursued by governments. Through this project I also lay the foundations for broader conceptual model for analyzing energy security, within more inclusive context, as one, but not the only one of the energy policy priorities.\n\nThe feasibility and consequences of replacing nuclear power plants (NPP) in the Czech Republic with other energy sources are discussed. The NPP produced about one-third of electricity in the Czech Republic in 2017. Renewable energy sources such as hydropower, wind and solar power plants and biomass/biogas burning power plants produced about 11% of electricity in 2017. Due to the geographical and other constraints (intermittency, land footprint, and public acceptance), the renewables do not have the potential to entirely replace the capacity of the NPP. The only feasible technologies that could replace NPP in the Czech Republic in the near future are the power plants using fossil fuels. The combined cycle power plants running on natural gas (NGCC) are technically and environmentally fea-sible alternative for NPP at the moment. However, the natural gas imports would increase by two-thirds and the total greenhouse gas emissions would go up by about 10% if the power production of the NP...\n\nThis paper is focused on analysing the impacts brought by economic instruments of energy policy in the Czech Republic towards generation of renewable electricity. The main area of analysis will be the effects of both feed-in tariffs and grants. Firstly, a description of how generation of renewable energy is supported is provided, followed by an overview of used literature. For the purposes of the paper, correlation and regression analysis methods are used. Based on the results, there is a dependence mainly between minimal feed-in tariffs and generation of electricity from both biomass and wind power plants. As for grants, dependence lies between State Environment Fund grants and generation of electricity from both biogas and wind power plants."
