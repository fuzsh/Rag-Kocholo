        "text": "The heat kicked in at Flushing Meadows on the first day of the US Open but only a couple of tall poppies wilted – notably the former world top-10 player Radek Stepanek, who lost in straight sets to the world No 235, Matthias Bachinger.\n\nThe 27-year-old German, who has a big serve and solid ground strokes, plays Andy Murray next – for the first time since they were juniors. On Monday he was simply too lively for Stepanek, who beat Murray at Queen’s this year, and he took an hour and a half to win 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.\n\nElsewhere Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, maddeningly inconsistent but never dull, lived up to his ninth seeding and finished strongly after a mid-match dip to beat Juan Mónaco 6-3, 4-6, 7-6, 6-1.\n\nAt times the Frenchman reproduced the form of his Toronto blitz of a couple of weeks ago, when he beat Novak Djokovic, Murray, Grigor Dimitrov and Roger Federer to win the Rogers Cup. He belted 20 aces and 48 winners past a bemused Monaco.\n\nTsonga is in Murray’s quarter of the draw and they could meet in the fourth round. He next plays Aleksandr Nedovyesov, who broke Irish hearts out on Court No 13 by beating James McGee 4-6, 6-2, 6-1, 7-6 in the 27-year-old qualifier’s first main draw appearance in a major.\n\nFernando Verdasco is through to the second round as well. The former world No7 recorded the 400th win of his career by beating the occasionally dangerous Blaz Rola 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, 1-6, 6-4 in an up-and-down struggle.\n\nNick Kyrgios provided further proof that his win over Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon was no fluke when he fought through three tie-breaks to beat the still excellent Mikhail Youzhny 7-5, 7-6, 2-6, 7-6. He would seem to have fortitude to go with his flare and daring.\n\nIn the women’s draw there were some slow starts from favoured players.\n\nSimona Halep, whose form has dipped ever so slightly since her rise in mid-summer, lost the first set before beating the American wild card Danielle Rose Collins 6-7, 6-1, 6-2 in a little under two hours.\n\nVenus Williams, seeded 19th, also dropped the first set – to a player who was on the Tour before she was even born, Kimiko Date-Krumm – before winning 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 on Arthur Ashe Court. The sixth seed, Angelique Kerber, was caught cold on a hot day, as well, before taking two hours 17 minutes to quell the challenge of the Russian qualifier Ksenia Pervak 6-2, 3-6, 7-5.\n\nThere were no such dramas for Poland’s Agnieszka Radwanska, who blitzed the Canadian Sharon Fichman 6-1, 6-0 in only 47 minutes on Louis Armstrong (which was of great inconvenience to Robin Haase, who said he was caught unprepared before his match on that court against Murray, and dropped the first two sets).\n\nSloane Stephens, who is still to provide sustained evidence of her pedigree since her heroics in Australia last year, breezed past the German Annika Beck 6-0, 6-3."
