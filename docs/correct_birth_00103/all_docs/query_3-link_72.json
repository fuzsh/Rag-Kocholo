        "text": "An audacious between-the-legs lob from Nick Kyrgios was the highlight of the Australian's four-set win in the opening round of Wimbledon.\n\nKyrgios saw off dogged Czech Radek Stepanek 6-4, 6-3, 6-7 (9-11), 6-1 on Tuesday night to preserve his flawless first-round record at the All England Club.\n\nAustralia's 15th seed turned on the style in the opening game of the third set, lobbing Stepanek from behind the baseline with the stunning \"tweener\" shot.\n\nThe shot had shades of the Australian's famous tweener against Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon in 2014 â€” a tournament where Kyrgios announced himself on the world stage.\n\nLoading...\n\nOn Tuesday, the combustible youngster also engaged in a running battle with umpire Mohamed Lahyani after receiving a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct after losing the tense third-set tiebreaker.\n\nKyrgios has history with Lahyani, the pair clashing in several of the 21-year-old's matches since his emergence on the world stage, and branded the Swede's sanction for swearing as \"rubbish\".\n\nDespite his advancing age and wildcard status, 37-year-old Stepanek had shaped as a potential banana skin match-up for Kyrgios.\n\nThe former Wimbledon quarter-finalist remains one of the craftiest players on tour and had Andy Murray down two sets to love in the first round of the French Open last month.\n\nAnd once again, Stepanek caused his more-fancied opponent a scare, denying Kyrgios a routine straight-sets win after fighting back from a service break down in the third to briefly unsettle the world No.18.\n\nStepanek would not go quietly, keeping Kyrgios on court for two hours and 26 minutes.\n\nKyrgios said he was relieved to get through.\n\n\"He knows how to play on grass. He serves well. He volleys well,\" he said.\n\n\"I couldn't lapse at all today. Otherwise I would have got beat.\"\n\nKyrgios was also wary of his next opponent Dustin Brown, who famously took out Rafael Nadal last year as well as fellow former champion Lleyton Hewitt in 2013.\n\nHe next faces German wildcard Dustin Brown who beat Dusan Lajovic of Serbia 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.\n\n\"This is by far his best surface. He can do dangerous things,\" he said of the dreadlocked wildcard.\n\nMixed news for other Aussies\n\nHeavy rain brought an early end to the day's play on outside courts, with 28 of the scheduled 65 matches not completed.\n\nOne of the matches interrupted was Australia's Bernard Tomic versus Spain's Fernando Verdasco.\n\nTomic lost the first set 6-4, then won the second and third sets 6-3, 6-3 but Verdasco hit back to take the fourth 6-3 before play was stopped. The match will resume on Wednesday.\n\nMatthew Barton's match was also interrupted, with the Australian 5-5 in a second-set tie-break, having lost the first set 7-6 (9/7) to Frenchman Albano Olivetti.\n\nThere were mixed results for the other Australians in action on day two.\n\nDaria Gavrilova joined Kyrgios in the second round with a stirring 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 comeback win over Wang Qiang.\n\nBrisbane-born right-hander John Millman also advanced to the second round, but only after being pushed to five sets by Spain's Albert Montanes before winning 7-5, 4-6, 5-7, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nLuke Saville won his first set against American Dennis Novikov before bowing out of the tournament in a 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-4 loss.\n\nAlso losing in the first round was Jordan Thompson, who went down 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 to Spanish 14th seed Roberto Bautista."
