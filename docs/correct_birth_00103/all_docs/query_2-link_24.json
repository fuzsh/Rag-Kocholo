        "text": "Radek Stepanek etched his name in history earlier today clinching the Czech Republic’s second ever Davis Cup title. Czech great Ivan Lendl led his 1980 team to glory and now it was Stepanek would edged Nicolas Almagro in four sets 64, 76(0), 36, 63 this afternoon in Prague to give the Czechs a 3-2 win over Spain in the Davis Cup final.\n\n“I was dreaming about it my whole life and now we’re standing here as Davis Cup champions, it’s amazing,” said Stepanek. “I had a lot of chances in the second set. I was playing very aggressive today; I wanted to be the one who was more active. Even though I lost the third set, I had no doubt about my tactics. I came on the court with a mindset that I had to stay calm, hungry and concentrated. That’s what I did tremendously well today.”\n\nStepanek lost in straight sets to David Ferrer on Friday, but then teamed with Tomas Berdych to win the doubles point yesterday. After Berdych failed to clinch it against Ferrer, it was Stepanek’s turn and he didn’t let his country down.\n\nInterview:\n\nHighlights:\n\nYou Might Like:\n\nStepanek the Hero in 3-2 Czech Davis Cup Win Over Spain\n\nStepanek, Czechs Repeat As Davis Cup Champions\n\nSpain, Stepanek-led Czech Republic Advance to 2009 Davis Cup Final\n\nRadek Stepanek And Petra Kvitova Have Broken Up!\n\nDjokovic Leads Serbia Against Czechs In Davis Cup Final This Weekend"
