        "text": "After a right-wrist injury derailed his season, he came back on court in the second half of April, but he resembled his old self only after the US Open – reaching his sixth career final in Astana (lost to Adrian Mannarino), followed by his first Masters semi-final appearance in Shanghai. The American with Czech heritage currently sits at a career-high ranking of No 23 – speaking to Tennis Majors, shares thoughts on his coach, the off-season, and the one thing he would change in his game if he had a magic wand among many other things.\n\nWas it difficult to get to your highest level following the injury?\n\nTo be honest, I am trying to do so, to get back to the level I had last year. Every match counts. I am just happy to be playing, especially in Adelaide, it’s such a nice place to play. I had success here last year as well.\n\nHow would you describe the coaching style of Radek Stepanek?\n\nA lot of energy!! He coaches the same way he played, with a lot of energy and positivity. He has known me since I was born and we work pretty well together – there is great chemistry and hopefully we will make some good results together.\n\nWe know you are close with Andre Agassi, could you maybe share some pearls of wisdom that he has passed onto you over the years?\n\nI will keep those gems a secret, but yes, we do spend a lot of time together. I talk to him quite a bit. Andre is a very, very special person in my life – he helps me with every aspect of my tennis, and everyday life as well, because he helps me grow as a person.\n\nMy dad (Petr Korda) won in Melbourne in 1998, and both of my sisters (Nelly and Jessica) won the Australian open in golf. We have a lot of history here\n\nSebastian Korda\n\nParticularly considering the injury you had, what did you spend your off-season working on?\n\nWell, preventing myself from getting injured again – putting on some muscle, building the body, trying to get faster, quicker and more agile. Nowadays, you gotta be fast or else you don’t stand a chance. I put in a lot of work in the gym, but on the court as well, trying to work on specific things I am going to need in matches.\n\nWhat kind of memories does the Australian Open evoke, especially after your brilliant run to the quarter-finals in 2023?\n\nAs a family, we love Australia. My dad (Petr Korda) won in Melbourne in 1998, and both of my sisters (Nelly and Jessica) won the Australian Open in golf. We have a lot of history here, people always treat us great and we always have a wonderful time here. We’re super comfortable playing here and I look forward to Australia every year – hopefully I will make some more good memories along the way.\n\nIf you had a magic wand that could change any aspect of your game, what would it be?\n\nProbably getting faster. Not probably – definitely getting faster, that would be the key for me.\n\nLastly, what is the toughest thing in tennis mentally?\n\nStaying calm, particularly in important points, and not overthinking – I think those two are the big ones, the rest is trying your hardest and fighting."
