Their family was poor and couldnât even afford to own a car, but despite everything, they were content. Interestingly, Petra was introduced to tennis by her father, who not only coached her but also coached her brothers to play, but it was Petra Kvitova who grew up with a real talent for the sport.\n\nDue to the amount of time she had to spend training and playing tennis, the Czech national didnât have many friends growing up. While she started practicing since she was a child, her father who wept deeply when she won the Wimbledon title in 2012 continued to practice with her until she was 16 years old. They still practiced in Fulnek, his hometown.\n\nWith an ongoing career since 2006, Petra Kvitova began to gain fame quite early, but it was from 2010 that her career took shape. This helped her win WTA Newcomer of the Year in 2010, then WTA Player of the Year in 2011, among other accolades.\n\nPetra Kvitova has won many titles, including 2012 Wimbledon where she defeated Maria Sharapova and in 2014 when she defeated Eugenie Bouchard.
