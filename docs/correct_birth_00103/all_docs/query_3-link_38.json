        "text": "By Scoop Malinowski\n\nStatus: ATP no 129. Winner of five career ATP singles and 14 doubles titles. Winner of 2012 Australian Open in doubles. Helped lead Czech Republic to win two Davis Cups – winning both deciding matches (2012 and 2013). Reached career high singles rank of #8 in 2006.\n\nHt: 6-1 Wt: 167\n\nDOB: November 27, 1978 In: Karvina Czech Republic\n\nFirst Tennis Memory: “My father, tennis coach in Karvina.”\n\nInspirations: “My tennis inspiration – I’m taking all my inspiration from somewhere else because I see a lot of great athletes playing well in a higher number of ages. And this is what is inspiring me to do the same in my sport.”\n\nFirst Famous Tennis Player You Met: “Hmm, good question…Thomas Muster. He was playing an exhibition against Slava Dosedel in Czech Republic, in a town where I lived for a few years. And I think I was 12 or 13, I just had to warm him up for the exhibition. And I was badly nervous [smiles].”\n\nGreatest Sports Moment: “Winning the Davis Cup twice and I think, singles-wise, my first title, definitely, in Rotterdam (2006 def C Rochus). And winning doubles with Leander in Australian Open. Winning Grand Slam is always a memory which stay with me forever.”\n\nMost Painful Moment: “When I got in 2006 to top ten. I had a great year, I felt on top of my game. And I woke up in the morning and I didn’t feel my right hand. I had a dislocated disk in the neck and couldn’t play tennis for six months.”\n\nFavorite Tournaments: “Grand Slam – Australian Open. Super Nine – Indian Wells. The other – Dubai, Basel.”\n\nWhy Do You Love Playing Tennis: “Because I grew up playing tennis, I love the competition. I love the one to one – it’s like in a boxing arena. The one to one – there is no draw. You win or lose. I like that gamble. That’s the only gamble I do in my life – playing tennis. I don’t do gambling in casinos and stuff. I have a passion for tennis. And it’s the thing I know best in my life, so far.”\n\nWhich Match Did You Feel Your Very Best: “I think that was the finals of Rotterdam when I won my first title. There I played really good.”\n\nStrangest Match: “Definitely they happen in the Davis Cup, that’s where all the strange things happen. As I remember it was 2007 in Prague when we played against Switzerland when they had on the team Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka. And I played the final match against Wawrinka at two-all and I was two sets to love up. And suddenly on one of my serves, my knee didn’t hold up. I didn’t know what happened and I had to finish that match really injured. And I don’t know how, I don’t know where it came from, but I was able to close out the match in the third set. And the atmosphere and everything that comes with it was just amazing feeling which I will never forget.”\n\nThree Athletes From Other Sports You Like To Watch: “Jaromir Jagr in hockey. Peter Cech in soccer, he’s goalkeeper for Chelsea. And Tiger Woods in golf.”\n\nFunniest Players Encountered: “I think Gael Monfils is very funny. I used to watch Yannick Noah in the times before, he was a little funny. Mostly the past generation, they were bringing to the game something special, something where the crowd laughed. They brought up some energy with the umpires. It was more of a show which I like.”\n\nCurrent Car: “BMW.”\n\nLast Book Read: “Pavel Nedved, soccer player of Czech Republic.”\n\nNo tags\n\n<< Did you see what Alize Cornet Did?"
