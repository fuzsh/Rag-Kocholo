        "text": "NOVAK DJOKOVIC is arguably one of the best tennis players of all time.\n\nHaving won 24 Grand Slam titles, Djokovic has had plenty of time to perfect his celebration.\n\nWhat is Novak Djokovic's violin celebration at Wimbledon?\n\nAfter his victory against Alexei Popyrin at Wimbledon, the illustrious seven-time champion, Novak Djokovic, celebrated by copying a violinist.\n\nHe placed his tennis racket over his shoulder and pretended to play.\n\nThe star then affectionately blew a kiss to the crowd.\n\nThis unique celebration was also seen after his victory over Holger Rune in the same tournament.\n\nDjokovic later shared that there is a sentimental reason behind this new celebratory gesture.\n\nKnown affectionately as Djoker, he has an impressive collection of titles under his belt, including 24 Grand Slam titles, seven ATP Finals crowns, and 40 ATP Masters 1000 titles, alongside nearly 90 other tour titles.\n\nNotably, at the French Open 2024, he surpassed Roger Federer's record, setting a new benchmark with the most men's singles Grand Slam match wins.\n\nWith his recent achievements, Djokovic has become the most successful men’s singles player in the history of Grand Slam tennis.\n\nWhat does Novak Djokovic's violin celebration at Wimbledon mean?\n\nOver the weekend, the father-of-two revealed to Serbian media that his post-match celebration, which involved miming playing the violin, was a tribute to his daughter.\n\nDjokovic explained that his six-year-old daughter, Tara, had recently started violin lessons, and he had promised to honour her progress in this unique way.\n\nThis gesture first puzzled many online, prompting questions about its significance.\n\nHowever, Djokovic clarified, \"That was for Tara.\n\n“My daughter has been playing violin for some time already, six months, and we agreed that I would celebrate that way.\"\n\nWhat has Novak Djokovic said about his violin celebration?\n\nAccording to talkSPORT, Djokovic expressed his desire for a signature celebration, explaining, \"I had always wanted a trademark celebration of my own.\"\n\nWhen asked about any celebratory gestures from other athletes he admired, Djokovic enthusiastically listed several icons: \"[Usain] Bolt! [Cristiano] Ronaldo and that ‘sui’, I also like [Andre] Agassi’s waving with a kiss when he bows.\"\n\nHe continued to detail the inspirations drawn from various sports, \"Guga [Gustavo Kuerten] at Roland Garros with heart, [Jo-Wilfried] Tsonga had that interesting football one, there are interesting ones, [Jude] Bellingham, it simply spreads its arms, [Carlos] Alcaraz did that, I did that at Roland Garros.\"\n\nDjokovic talked about the dynamic nature of these celebrations, stating, \"It’s interesting and fun that we can take it from other sports, combine sports, it travels quickly through networks.\"\n\nReflecting on his personal evolution in celebratory gestures, he noted, \"Everyone has their own thing, I changed it, it depends on the moment and feelings, now I have a violin.\"\n\nHe reminisced about an amusing interaction with former professional tennis player Radek Stepanek, sharing, \"Stepanek was the first to do that, I was joking with him, he had that celebration, we even remembered when I played against him at the US Open in 2007 in five sets in some great heat.\n\n“It was some crazy point, then he did it, then I responded to him with a point or two, it dates from then.\""
