        "text": "Radek Stepanek of Czech Republic holds up his trophy after defeating Gael Monfils of France in the final match at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington August 7, 2011. [Photo/Agencies]\n\nWASHINGTON - Unseeded Radek Stepanek's net-charging style carried him to the Legg Mason Tennis Classic title at age 32, making him the tournament's oldest champion since Jimmy Connors was 35 in 1988.\n\nThe unseeded Stepanek of the Czech Republic won an ATP final for the first time in 2 years by upsetting top-seeded Gael Monfils of France 6-4, 6-4 Sunday at the hard-court tuneup for the US Open.\n\nStepanek won the point on 29 of his 39 trips to the net. Monfils, in contrast, was content to stay close to the baseline and only made it forward four times.\n\nMonfils, who is ranked No. 7, might have been feeling the effects of his semifinal, which ended about nine hours after Stepanek's did Saturday. Monfils' 2{-hour, rain-delayed victory over big-serving John Isner finished at 1:15 a.m., with the Frenchman winning in a third-set tiebreaker after saving a match point.\n\nMore showers came Sunday, resulting in two delays that totaled about an hour.\n\nStepanek entered the week ranked 54th, but he won six consecutive matches, including three against seeded players. He earned $264,000 for his fifth career title and ended a drought that extended to San Jose in February 2009, then celebrated by dropping to the court and contorting his body in a dance move known as \"The Worm.\"\n\nHe never faced a break point against Monfils, who lost serve once in each set.\n\nGael Monfils of France hits a return to Radek Stepanek of Czech Republic during the final match at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington August 7, 2011. [Photo/Agencies]\n\nAbout an hour before the first point of Sunday's final was played, Monfils headed out to a practice court _ and he was toting a soccer ball, which he used to get his blood flowing. Still, rather understandably, Monfils got off to something of a sleepy start against Stepanek, double-faulting twice in the opening game before managing to hold. Then, in Monfils' next service game, he got broken to trail 2-1.\n\nClearly not at his best, Monfils did manage to delight the crowd with his usual athleticism and showmanship. At 15-30 in the third game, Stepanek hit a volley too strongly, and Monfils - at the baseline - leaped and let the ball sail through his legs and drop long.\n\nThere were other such moments, including a tremendous jumping save of an overhead to extend another first-set point, and a misguided attempt at reaching another overhead in the second set, resulting in Monfils' racket flying end-over-end and landing at least 10 feet away from him. Seconds later, after Stepanek won a point thanks to a favorable net-cord bounce, Monfils juggled the ball with his feet as though playing football, then kicked it over the net, drawing applause from the crowd.\n\nStepanek, ranked as high as No. 8 in 2006, closed the first set with a 119 mph serve, one of his two aces. Monfils hit eight aces - including one at 141 mph - but was less dominant when the ball was in play.\n\nKeeping the pressure on, Stepanek opened the second set by breaking Monfils again. At 30-all, both men wound up at the net, Monfils hit a tentative volley, and Stepanek replied with a crisper volley to earn a break point. He converted the chance by putting a volley into the corner that Monfils slapped into the net.\n\nStepanek then held at love to make it 2-0, while Monfils chucked his racket to the blue court after each of two consecutive unforced errors at the baseline. Later, Monfils slid and stumbled while chasing a shot. He dropped his racket and stayed down on his back for a few seconds, before checking his right elbow.\n\nHe played on. Stepanek played better."
