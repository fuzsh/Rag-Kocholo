        "text": "MLB 10 The Show\n\nPosted 12-08-2009 at 09:02 AM by jbonax\n\nUpdated 02-10-2010 at 09:07 AM by jbonax (wrong idea expressed)\n\nWith the '09 winter meetings convening and several off-season transitions already inked and videod on franchised web pages, MLB 10 The Show's pre-season sightings are soon to be noticed. The inevitable and expected cover boy of the game will soon be announced, along with several poses on which to vote or suggest, and then come the long-awaited screen shots. We'll be tempted like Eve in the Garden with Jeter's diving stop or Howard's long sweeping swing, the red-and-white stripes illuminating, the creases of his uniform shadowed perfectly, the crowd faded in the background, the textured dirt temptingly sizzling beneath the highly resolutioned sun, the grass as green as Irish parade in Boston, and other such well-designed and still shots. And sometime in Jaunary, two months before the release of \"the game\", we shall have our first video bytes, short, little glimpses into the promised land. The sounds of the crowd, the umpires' chants, the sporadic yellings from the stands, the sound effects of that bat hitting the ball, the hot dog vendor tripping the light fancy down the concrete isle, screams from the shadows, the familiar color commentator and play-by-play man, and more. We will salivate and our anticipations will build, giving us hope to wait longer for the demo in February. Build it and it will come. We will download it. (It's the only download that I actually sit and watch, and count...99%) When it gets to 100%, I can hardly sit still. I want to see on my 50-inch plasma, the colors of spring, the crispness of America's pastime, the life-blood of sports, baseball. I will play that 3-inning game a thousand times with the same lineups, pitchers, and stadium. It will soothe my every spare second of late-winter existence. I am transported to summer and beyond with my MLB 10 The Show demo. It's my fix. It's my addiction in a next-gen console. The blackness of my PS3 and XBOX360's become symbolic of the rich sin I purposely expose my soul to in those late-night 3-inning-ers. Just to guess pitch an inside screamer and send it chalk-dusting over first base or meet the 2-finger up and out to left center; sorry I'm assuming a leftie at the plate here. It's a on college flash back. I apologize. Then it happens...the night before. The night before the release of the real game. I drive by Gamespot several times before I have the nerve to actually enter the store and ask the dumb question: \"Has it arrived?\" I'm then told it will be here tomorrow. I can't sleep, so I play several rounds of 3-inning-ers. I arrive at the store while the owner is still opening UPS and FedEx boxes. My eyes search the area behind the front desk. I spot the game. I stare like a lion having seen a limping, infant gazelle in open range. I drool. The store owner, having seen my emotional routines from past springs, quickly grabs a fresh copy of the game, places it in a bag, and hands it to me. I walk away. Get in car. Translucently float home. Open box. open game. insert it. Talk to you later. I'm hyper-ventilating!!...\n\nBanned\n\n2009 NFL Week 14 Picks and Predictions - NFL Picks Week 14\n\nPosted 12-08-2009 at 06:17 AM by lauradaisy\n\nUpdated 12-08-2009 at 06:21 AM by lauradaisy (style formatting)\n\n[FONT=Verdana][URL=\"http://www.zimbio.com/go/sZ6duv7CpNH/http://www.sportsbetting.com/betting-odds/\"][B]2009 NFL Week 14 Picks and Predictions: [/B][/URL]\n\nI feel 2009 NFL Week 13 was a quite weird. Did Oakland beat Pittsburgh? Did New Orleans and Washington go to overtime? Does really Brett Favre looks human?[/FONT]\n\n[URL=\"http://www.zimbio.com/go/y2txUkZjQXE/http://www.sportsbetting.com/betting-odds/nfl/17.html\"][IMG]http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/DEy20I0Sx6vl.jpg[/IMG][/URL] [FONT=Verdana]\n\nAny way, NFL Week 14 continues to entertain. [/FONT][FONT=Verdana]The AFC wildcard race is completely up for grabs as is the AFC East and West divisional races and the NFC East and West have some uncertainty at the top.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Verdana][B]Here are [URL=\"http://www.zimbio.com/go/sZ6duv7CpNH/http://www.sportsbetting.com/betting-odds/\"]2009 NFL Week 14 picks & predictions[/URL]:[/B]\n\n[B]\n\nThursday, December 10th, 2009\n\n[/B][/FONT]\n\n[B][FONT=Verdana]Pittsburgh vs. Cleveland, 8:20PM ET[/FONT][/B][FONT=Verdana]\n\nThe Steelers have lost four in a row. This clearly tells how far Pittsburgh has fallen. However, they are playing the Browns and will get a win to stay relevant in the wildcard race.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Verdana]Pittsburgh[/FONT][FONT=Verdana] 20, Cleveland 10\n\n[B]\n\nSunday, December 13th, 2009[/B][/FONT]\n\n[B][FONT=Verdana]New Orleans vs. Atlanta, 1:00PM ET[/FONT][/B][FONT=Verdana]\n\nWith Matt Ryan back the Falcons will be more in competitive spirit than they were in NFL Week 13. Against the Redskins, after seeing the Saints exposures this could be a challenging contest. Still the Saints are the Saints, you can not pick against them until they give a lawful reason.\n\nNew Orleans 31, Atlanta 21[/FONT]\n\n[B][FONT=Verdana]Detroit vs. Baltimore, 1:00PM ET[/FONT][/B][FONT=Verdana]\n\nThe Lions rank near the bottom. If Baltimore hopes to stay in the playoff race, then they will need this one.\n\nBaltimore 24, Detroit 13[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Verdana][B]\n\nGreen Bay vs. Chicago, 1:00PM ET[/B]\n\nIf the Bears win, then they win against low level opponents. The Packers are better but a low level opponent. Green Bay stays in the game and constantly works whether they win or lose.\n\nGreen Bay 20, Chicago 13\n\n[B]Seattle[/B][B] vs. Houston, 1:00PM ET [/B]\n\nLast week, the Seahawks posted a win against the 49ers. However, they were less than dominant in their endeavors. The Texans are toughest division in the NFL and need to prove this time.\n\nHouston 27, Seattle 17\n\n[B]\n\nMiami vs. Jacksonville, 1:00PM ET, CBS[/B]\n\n5-1 home record for the Jaguars. They are tied for the lead in the wildcard. The Dolphins are coming off of a confidence with their win over the Patriots. These teams are evenly matched and will play a close contest.\n\nJacksonville 20, Miami 17[/FONT]\n\n[B][FONT=Verdana]NY Jets vs. Tampa Bay, 1:00PM ET, CBS[/FONT][/B][FONT=Verdana]\n\nThe Jets have ranked in first in defense and the Buccaneers are bad.\n\nNY Jets 24, Tampa Bay 10\n\n[B]Carolina[/B][B] vs. New England, 1:00PM ET[/B]\n\nThe Patriots are mortal in NFL season. Tom Brady had a throw for 352 yards but when they were in need, the New England defense could not come up with a stop.\n\nNew England 28, Carolina 17\n\n[B]Cincinnati[/B][B] vs. Minnesota, 1:00PM ET, CBS[/B]\n\nI think the best featured match up of the week. Cincinnati has changed its position scorer to a meager defensive squad. Last week, Minnesota took a beating but still carries a more balanced team.\n\nMinnesota 24, Cincinnati 17\n\n[B]Buffalo[/B][B] vs. Kansas City, 1:00PM ET, CBS[/B]\n\nOn Thursday Night, the Bills lost a tough one but still they have a respectable crowd. We never know when Kansas City is going to have a decent game there by to surprise an opponent.\n\nBuffalo 17, Kansas City 13\n\n[B]Denver[/B][B] vs. Indianapolis, 1:00PM ET, CBS[/B]\n\nBroncos did not turn things around last week. Against the sad Chiefs, they may play. Indianapolis continues to impress still.\n\nIndianapolis 30, Denver 17\n\n[B]St. Louis[/B][B] vs. Tennessee, 4:05PM ET[/B]\n\nIn the 2010 NFL Draft, Rams are continuing to compete for the #1 pick. Titans may not be there yet but are definitely better than the Rams.\n\nTennessee 35, St. Louis 20\n\n[B]Washington[/B][B] vs. Oakland, 4:05PM ET[/B]\n\nWith a new QB at the helm for the Raiders, it is hard to judge just how good or bad they are. The Redskins should have a much better record and their semi respectable defense will shut down the inconsistent Oakland offense.\n\nWashington 21, Oakland 12\n\n[B]San Diego[/B][B] vs. Dallas, 4:15PM ET[/B]\n\nThe Chargers have been on a roll while the Cowboys have been all over the page. So far this NFL season Dallas has been hardnosed at home. San Diego has been playing equally well on the road. The consistency of the Chargers will tip the scales here.\n\nSan Diego 24, Dallas 21[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Verdana]\n\n[/FONT][B][FONT=Verdana]Philadelphia vs. NY Giants, 8:20PM ET[/FONT][/B][FONT=Verdana]\n\nJust when you thought the Giants were toast they come back with a win to stay in the thick of things. Statistically New York has a better team but the record says otherwise. The Eagles have been rolling along nicely lately and will carry that momentum into Week 14.\n\nPhiladelphia 27, NY Giants 20\n\n[B]Monday, December 14th[/B][/FONT]\n\n[B][FONT=Verdana]Arizona vs. San Francisco, 8:30PM ET[/FONT][/B][FONT=Verdana]\n\nA week ago this was building up to be a much more interesting game. Unfortunately for the 49ers they made some poor end of game decisions in Week 13 that could have cost them a playoff spot.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Verdana]Arizona[/FONT][FONT=Verdana] 31, San Francisco 17[/FONT]\n\n[B][URL=\"http://www.zimbio.com/go/sZ6duv7CpNH/http://www.sportsbetting.com/betting-odds/\"][B]2009 NFL Week 14 Picks and Predictions - Free NFL Week 14 Picks [/B][/URL][/B]...\n\nBanned"
