        "text": "Andy Murray claimed his epic victory over Radek Stepanek on Tuesday could be “one of the biggest wins of my career”.\n\nBut the world No.2 admitted he needed the noisy support of Team Murray to escape a first-round upset at the French Open following his recent split with coach Amelie Mauresmo.\n\nThe Scot required two days and five tense sets before beating the Czech veteran 6-3 6-3 0-6 3-6 7-5. The gripping final set lasted 71 tense minutes and Murray came within two points of defeat before finally seeing off the world No.128.\n\nIn his post-match press conference, Murray insisted he has not fallen out with Mauresmo.\n\nBut the Olympic champion pointedly praised the animated backing of his support team – including his assistant coach Jamie Delgado - as he took the first laboured step towards a first title here.\n\nGallery: Murray beats Stepanek\n\n“It’s an extremely important match for me,” he said.\n\n“It could turn out to be one of the biggest wins of my career. It may not, also, but to get through that match, it was really, really important for me.\n\n“And it easily could have gone the other way. When it is pretty much one set to stay in the tournament, you have to have as much energy, intensity as you can. I’m glad that my team’s right behind me in situations like that.”\n\nMauresmo sat away from Murray’s box in the last match she was courtside as his coach when he lost to Grigor Dimitrov at the Miami Masters in March. But the Scot said: “Me and Amélie have a good relationship. We certainly didn’t fall out.”\n\nThe Scot even agreed with the Frenchwoman’s assessment that he was “complex” - and proved it with his 32nd consecutive first-round win in Grand Slams. Murray was driven crazy by the wiley old Czech mixing up aggressive serve and volleying with cunning drop shots. But somehow Murray always seems to find his way out of such tight spots.\n\nAsked if he was complex, Murray responded: “Away from the court, probably not. On the court, yeah.\n\n“Sometimes it can be frustrating for me when it’s looking at the negative things. There are also some good attributes that I have on the court, too.\n\n“I displayed them in abundance today and yesterday. Yes, I was getting frustrated, but I gave everything to try to win and got myself out of a situation that not all players would have been able to get themselves out of. So I fight through to the end in all of the matches.”\n\nMurray will today face Mathias Bourgue, the 22-year-old French wildcard who won his first ever Grand Slam match in the first round.\n\nAljaz Bedene beat Austrian qualifier Gerald Melzer 4-6 6-3 6-4 6-4 to see three British men through to the second round here for the first time since 1975. Kyle Edmund will face No 15 seed John Isner on Wednesday."
