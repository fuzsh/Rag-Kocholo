        "text": "LAKEWOOD RANCH — He is called “Steps” by those closest to him and it is steps that are now on Radek Stepanek’s mind as he gets ready to walk onto the court in a match that counts for the first time in more than six months.\n\nSure, Stepanek would like to hit the court running and immediately recapture the magic that made him one of the most dangerous players in the game.\n\nCertainly, the part-time Bradenton resident would like to win in his own back yard in his first tournament since the U.S. Open last fall and take the title at this week’s $100,000 Sarasota Open at the Lakewood Ranch and Tennis Center.\n\nOf course, Stepanek, at age 36, the second oldest active player on the men’s professional tour, would like to quickly return to the level he was at before a back injury threatened his livelihood.\n\nBut Steps is also a realist.\n\n“I am thinking step by step because I know how difficult it is to come back after being away such a long time,” Stepanek said, conjuring up the ghost of Rafael Nadal. “When Rafe came back, he was out just three months. He has been back four months now and still is not where he was before his injury. It is a physical game out there. It is tough.\n\n“I am going to take it day by day. I am very humble and very happy that I am back on the court.”\n\nStepanek tested his tennis strokes and his conditioning Friday in a practice session at the tournament site with Stefan Kozlov, a 17-year-old who many believe to be the top American hope in the game. Today the competition for Stepanek and the other players in the 32-man draw starts for real in the USTA Pro Circuit event that has a strong field and is filled with players who hope to make their mark against a player of his caliber.\n\nStepanek opens his run in the tournament against American Jared Donaldson, an unseeded 18-year old just getting his start on the pro tour. In the other half of the draw is top-seeded Tim Smyczek, ranked No. 68 in the world.\n\nThe draw has quality at the top, with four players ranked in the top 100, and is deep, with the last direct acceptance ranked No. 176. It is just the type of competition that will be a good test for Stepanek’s first steps in his latest comeback.\n\nStepanek, once ranked No. 8 in the world and known for his passion and celebrations, has been battling on the courts for nearly two decades. Forced inactivity only heightens the addiction of competing and performing in front of tennis fans.\n\n“It is going to be my first match in a long time,” he says. “I am looking forward to seeing the chair umpire, to see the ball kids. To feel the tournament buzz. I am very excited for my first match after such a long time.\n\n“Seeing how I do in the first match is the most important thing. I am looking forward to it. I don’t know what to expect for myself but it is going to show very soon.”\n\nIf the past is any indication, Stepanek should expect to climb back up the rankings. He has dealt with injury before and always made a comeback. Consistency has been a hallmark of his career, being ranked in the top 70 for 13 consecutive years.\n\nStepanek has won five ATP singles titles and 17 doubles titles. He has clinched two Davis Cup wins for the Czech Republic, the only player to win the deciding fifth match in consecutive years. He has played in the Olympics and has won a pair of Grand Slam doubles titles — Australian Open and U.S. Open — with Leander Paes.\n\nStepanek says the Davis Cup experience, especially playing at home in front of his country’s fans and his parents, was special. But there are so many moments in a lengthy journey.\n\n“I believe every single day of my career is a highlight,” he insists. “I achieved so much more than anybody expected as a player. I say it is better to overachieve than to be an underachiever.”\n\nStarting as a doubles specialist, Stepanek made his mark in singles after seeking help from his Czech Republic countryman, and Bradenton resident, Petr Korda.\n\nIt was Korda who believed in Stepanek and, eventually made Stepanek believe in himself.\n\n“I was practicing hard, doing the stuff I had to do but was unable to win matches,” Stepanek said about struggling as a young player. “That is why I picked up the telephone and asked Petr if he could help me.\n\n“I said to myself, ‘Who better to give me advice than someone who won a Grand Slam title and was ranked No. 2 in the world?’ ”\n\nThey had some rough moments early on, disagreements on and off the court. But now Korda, who won the Australian Open and reached that No. 2 in the world during his playing career, refers to Stepanek as his fourth child. The two have been together for 13 years and are close friends.\n\nThough age may be catching up, Stepanek still believes he can hold off father time.\n\n“My love for the game is the No. 1 motivation,” said Stepanek, who has had a home in Bradenton for a dozen years. “I have been playing tennis since I was a kid and I still have the same fun like when I was 5 years old. For me that is the most important thing.\n\n“My whole career I have played with love, with all my heart, with all my feelings and that is what is bringing me back to the court every day.\n\n“I know one day if I wake up and it is not there, I am done. But I still love this game. I loved to compete in a great sport where there is only one winner and one loser.”\n\nThis week he returns to the game he loves, eager to take those first steps to see how much farther he can go."
