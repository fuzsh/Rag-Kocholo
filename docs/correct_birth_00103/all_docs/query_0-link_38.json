She epitomises the perfect modern day tennis player, capable of playing on all surfaces and on all conditions. 'We are extremely delighted to have Martina compete in India,\" said Bhupathi, with whom Hingis won the mixed doubles title at the Australian Open in January.\n\n\"The Swiss player has shown admirable resilience in fighting back a career threatening injury and storming into the Top 20 within six months.\"\n\nBhupathi, whose company manages Indian teenager Sania Mirza, said the rest of the field would be finalised closer to the tournament.\n\nAsked if Martina would also play the doubles, Bhupathi said, \"As of now she is committed to play the singles. Lets see what happens next.\"\n\nHe also confirmed the participation of Sania Mirza and the Oberoi sisters in the tournament.\n\nAsked who is Bhupathi's favourite mixed doubles partner, he said, \"It's a very difficult question. The kind of game I play suits all my partners. But I will say Martina is the most impressive of them all.\"\n\nOn whether Anastasia Myskina would come to defend her title, he said, \" It's too early to say. The list of the other players and their confirmation will be available only six weeks before the tournament.\"\n\nAnastasia Myskina of Russia won the 2005 event defeating Karolina Sprem of Croatia in the final.\n\nJokes\n\nThese are the jokes my friend send me via e-mail. have a laugh!!! lol\n\nThere is a book called Disorder in the Court.
