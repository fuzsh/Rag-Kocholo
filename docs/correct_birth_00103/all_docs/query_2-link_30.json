        "text": "PARIS — For just the ninth time in his career, Andy Murray escaped from a two-sets-to-love deficit. The world No. 2 and two-time Grand Slam champion had to wait overnight, but then come through in a tight finish over 37-year-old qualifier Radek Stepanek.\n\nHere’s how it happened.\n\nScoreline: [2] Andy Murray (GBR) def. [Q] Radek Stepanek (CZE) 3-6, 3-6, 6-0, 6-3, 7-5\n\nMurray took two days and five sets to overcome Stepanek, a former world No. 8 who was forced to qualify here after an injury last season. Serving 4-5 down in the fifth set, Murray was twice two points from defeat.\n\nBut Murray survived and will meet French wildcard Mathias Bourgue in the second round on Wednesday. Bourgue, 22, is ranked No. 164 in the world.\n\nWhat it means: Murray, like No. 3 seed Stan Wawrinka, needed five sets to move on, while Rafael Nadal, also in action on Tuesday, lost just three games in a 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 win over Australian Sam Groth.\n\nMurray came back from two sets down for the third time at Roland Garros. He trailed by two sets during the 2011 French Open fourth round against Viktor Troicki. The British No. 1 has been a semifinalist here the last two years, and three out of the previous four.\n\nHow it happened: It was a bizarre match to watch – over two days – as Murray was coming into Paris fresh off a Rome victory over Novak Djokovic. Stepanek was at his crafty peak, however, when this match started Monday evening. He jumped to a two-set lead as Murray grew more and more frustrated.\n\nBut Murray would turn the tide, winning the third set going away and then warning the chair umpire to watch Stepanek’s time on a post-set bathroom break, saying he was trying to get the match pushed overnight. Murray, always chatty on court, was particularly tense, and chair umpire Damien Dumusois did give Stepanek a time violation warning, though only because he changed his shirt on court after returning from the bathroom.\n\nHe would lead 4-2 when the match was called for darkness on Monday.\n\nMurray won two of three games for the fourth set, but then had to deal with Stepanek in the fifth, the two holding for the first 10 games of the set as it raced to a decisive finish. Murray, in fact, was two points away from defeat twice at 4-5 down, but held and then broke Stepanek, serving out the match in three hours, 41 minutes on his second match point.\n\nKey stat: Murray was helped in the latter part of this match by his serve, belting 14 aces in total. Stepanek hit more winners – 57 to 39 – but also committed 74 unforced errors to Murray’s 35.\n\nWhat he said: “It is unbelievable what he’s doing,” Murray said on court of Stepanek. “He had a bad injury last year and was out for eight or nine months. At 37 years old, coming out and playing that way, fighting… I hope to be doing that myself at that age. I’m just glad to come through it.”\n\nMurray continued: “He’s always been extremely difficult to play. He uses a lot of drop shots, hits the ball very flat… it’s a credit to him and the way that he played. I knew that just playing a fifth set that anything can happen. We both had our chances today.”"
