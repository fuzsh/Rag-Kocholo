        "text": "Biography:Radek Stepanek Radek Å tÄpÃ¡nek (born November 27, 1978 in KarvinÃ¡) is a professional tennis player from the Czech Republic, who turned professional in 1996. His career-high world ranking in singles is no. 11, achieved in May 2006. He won his first ATP singles title in 2006, beating Christophe Rochus in Rotterdam, but he has yet to progress beyond the 3rd round of a Grand Slam tournament. He has also won 11 doubles titles. His style of play is aggressive with a strong serve and hard, flat groundstrokes, particularly off his doublehanded backhand. In May 2006 he is on verge of getting into the top ten of ATP rankings as he defeated Jose Acasuso in the semifinals of Masters Series Hamburg. He went on to lose the final in straight sets against Spain's Tommy Robredo. He is currently dating fellow tennis player Martina Hingis."
