        "text": "MELBOURNE, Australia — Ten days ago, Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic was battling toe-to-toe with Andy Roddick of the United States in the finals of the Brisbane International tournament. Stepanek, the defending champion, lost an epic encounter, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (7) and drew Roddick’s praise as an indefatiguable opponent.\n\nToday, in the fading light of a windy, rain-drenched afternoon, Stepanek, seeded 13th, bowed out in the first round of the Australian Open.\n\nHis conquerer, Ivo Karlovic of Croatia, won, 2-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, in 3 hours 56 minutes. Stepanek shrugged off the fact that his opponent had won only three more points, 158-155.\n\n“It was enough,” he said. “He won the last one.”\n\nThere was no looking back to Brisbane, Stepanek told a reporter: “I had chances, I wasted a lot of chances to break his serve, but it has nothing to do with 10 days ago.”\n\nIn the tale of statistics that often mean so little, there was fresh confirmation: Karlovic, the winner, lost his serve four times, once more than Stepanek, the loser.\n\nLooking for lessons, Stepanek found none. “Maybe the rest of the three I will do better,” he said, referring to the French, Wimbledon and U.S. Open championships ahead.\n\nIn other men’s play, the results were often ordinary and expected, with only an occasional hiccup: Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina, seeded fourth, dropped a set to Michael Russell of Houston, winning, 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.\n\nRussell, 31, is a journeyman competitor ranked 90th in the world, high enough to earn him a place in the main draw. In a less-than-stellar performance, Del Potro, who at 6 feet 6 inches stands nearly a foot taller than Russell’s 5 feet 8 inches, hit many more winners, 49 to 29, but more unforced errors, as well, 61 to 54.\n\nRoddick, seeded seventh, swept aside Thiemo de Bakker of the Netherlands, 6-1, 6-4, 6-4; Andy Murray of Britain, seeded fifth, made short work of Kevin Anderson of South Africa, 6-1, 6-1, 6-2; Fernando Gonzalez of Chile, seeded 11th, defeated Olivier Rochus of Belgium, 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1.\n\nSouth African-born Wayne Odesnik of Weston, Fla., defeated Blaz Kavcic of Slovenia, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-2.\n\nMardy Fish of Tampa, Fla., a quarterfinalist here in 2007, lost to Andrey Golubev of Kazakstan, 6-2, 1-6, 6-3, 6-3."
