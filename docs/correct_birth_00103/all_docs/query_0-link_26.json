        "text": "BCS Rankings - Alabama and Texas Meet For National Title\n\nPosted 12-06-2009 at 06:26 AM by kriston\n\n[URL=\"http://www.betrepublic.com/\"][B]Final Projected BCS Rankings: Alabama and Texas Meet For National Title[/B][/URL]\n\nWe waiting weeks for this weekend to come, hoping that it would deliver the drama and intrigue that the rest of the season was missing, and it did not dissapoint.\n\nTexas, playing in what was supposed to be a cakewalk of a Big 12 Championship Game instead needed instant replay on the clock and a 46-yard field goal that just sneaked in the uprights to clinch victory and a likely shot at the national title game.\n\n[URL=\"http://www.betrepublic.com\"][IMG]http://cdn.bleacherreport.com/images_root/images/photos/000/769/271/94027321.jpg.1655.0_feature.jpg?1260077729[/IMG][/URL]\n\nAlabama and Florida were supposed to play in the seasons most intriguing game. Instead what we got was an Alabama romp, blowing out the Gators and likely clinching their shot at the national title.\n\nSo its likely that well get that SEC Champ vs. Texas game when the last BCS standings are released tomorrow.\n\nBut it could have been much different.\n\nIf Texas had lost, we would have entered one of the messiest final BCS rankings in the systems history, but we avoided that by the slimmest of margins.\n\nSo heres our reality for tomorrow, and what we know so far:\n\n* We know that Oregon and Ohio State will make the Rose Bowl game and continue the Big Ten vs. Pac-10 rivalry.\n\n* We know that Cincinnati will receive a BCS bowl bid, we just dont know from where.\n\n* We know that Georgia Tech is going to get a bid to the Orange Bowl with their victory over Clemson in the ACC Championship Game, as the bowl and the conference have ties that allow for the conference champion to receive an automatic bid there.\n\n* We are almost 100% sure that Alabama and Texas will meet for the national title game after winning every game they needed to in order to get to the biggest game of the season.\n\n* We can also be pretty sure that Florida will receive a Sugar Bowl bid despite losing the SEC Championship Game, as the Sugar Bowl will likely want an SEC team despite the SEC Champ going to the National Title Game.\n\n* Another thing thats guaranteed: TCU will get a BCS bowl bid due to the BCSs automatic bid qualifying policy for non-BCS schools.\n\nSo the six BCS conference bid are set, and two at-large bids are also nearly set in stone.\n\nThat leaves two openings. Iowa, Penn State, Boise State, Virginia Tech, LSU and BYU will all likely be eligible tomorrow.\n\nIt seems like the Big Ten teams that trail behind Ohio State; Iowa and Penn State, will be one of the at-large selections. The other selection cannot be a Big Ten team, but could be any of the other teams mentioned.\n\nIf logic holds up, Boise State would receive that bid, and we at BCS Know How project that they will in fact get that final bid.\n\nHeres a look at what the BCS standings might look like when they are released tomorrow:\n\n[CENTER][URL=\"http://www.betrepublic.com/cricket-betting\"][B]Projected BCS Standings December 6th[/B][/URL]\n\n[/CENTER]\n\nRank Team\n\n1 Alabama\n\n2 Texas\n\n3 Cincinnati\n\n4 TCU\n\n5 Florida\n\n6 Boise State\n\n7 Oregon\n\n8 Ohio State\n\nBanned\n\nIndia claim top spot in Test cricket rankings\n\nPosted 12-06-2009 at 06:13 AM by kriston\n\n[B][URL=\"http://livesportsupdates.sportsblognet.com/2009/12/06/india-to-the-top-of-the-official-test-cricket-rankings/\"]India to the top of the official Test Cricket rankings[/URL][/B]\n\nIndia became the number one Test team on Sunday after routing Sri Lanka by an innings and 24 runs in the third and final cricket Test in Mumbai to clinch the series 2-0.Pace spearhead Zaheer Khan took 5-72 as Sri Lanka, trailing by 333 runs in the first innings, were shot out for 309 in their second knock 35 minutes into the fifth day's play at the Brabourne stadium.\n\n[URL=\"http://www.betrepublic.com/cricket-betting\"][IMG]http://livesportsupdates.sportsblognet.com/files/2009/12/Official-Test-Cricket-Rankings.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nThe 2-0 scoreline lifted India to the top of the official Test rankings with 124 rating points, two more than previous leaders South Africa.\n\nSri Lanka, who had also lost the second Test by an innings and 144 runs, slipped from second place to fourth with 115 points, one behind Australia (116).\n\nAbout 10,000 home fans cheered lustily as the Indian players and the support staff, led by the team's South African coach Gary Kirsten, hugged each other after the fall of the last wicket.\n\nSenior pro Sachin Tendulkar, the world's leading batsman in Test and one-day cricket, was esctatic when he spoke to television commentators after the match.\n\n\"It is fantastic to be the number one Test team,\" said Tendulkar, 36, who completed 20 years in international cricket at the start of this series.\n\n\"I have been waiting a long time to get to this position. Not just me, but the entire country waited for it.\n\n\"The players have worked very hard over the last 18 months to get there and the coach has handled the team superbly.\"\n\nSince November 2007, India have won home series against Pakistan, Australia, England and Sri Lanka, won an away series in New Zealand, and drawn at home against South Africa.\n\nThe Indians lost two away series in Australia and Sri Lanka in the same period.\n\n\"The real tough job starts now to maintain this performance,\" said Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.\n\n\"When we are pushed against the wall, we come out with special performances. It was a terrific team effort in the entire series. The batsmen got big scores, the bowlers bowled well in difficult conditions and our fielding was good.\"\n\n\"The important thing is to maintain this consistency in future.\"\n\nIndia needed just 7.4 overs to wrap up Sri Lanka's second innings after they had resumed at Saturday's total of 274-6.\n\nSri Lanka's resistance ended with the day's third delivery when captain Kumar Sangakkara was caught behind off Zaheer for 137.\n\nSangakkara, who was on 133 overnight, smashed the second ball to the point fence but failed to take his bat away in time as the next delivery moved away after pitching.\n\nTwo overs later, Rangana Herath miscued a pull off Zaheer to mid-wicket where Pragyan Ojha dived in front to take a low catch and reduce Sri Lanka to 282-8.\n\nMuttiah Muralitharan and Nuwan Kulasekara hit a flurry of boundaries to lift Sri Lanka past the 300-run mark, but Zaheer was not to be denied his fifth wicket.\n\nThe seamer lifted a ball outside Kulasekara's off-stump and the batsman edged a waist-high catch to Venkatsai Laxman at second slip after making 19.\n\n\"India outperformed us in all departments of the game in the last two Tests,\" Sangakkara admitted.\n\n\"We nearly put 400 on the board, which is a good score, but (Virender) Sehwag took the game away with his 293.\n\n\"The guys fought hard through the series but it was just not good enough.\"\n\nBanned"
