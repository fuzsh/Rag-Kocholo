        "text": "The original, official, list of players who have entered to compete in the 2015 Sarasota Open has been released by the USTA and if it holds the tournament should be the strongest in its seven year history.\n\nThe ranking cutoff of the 22 direct acceptance players is 173 and currently includes four players ranked in the top 100 of the world.\n\n\"As far as the cutoff, it is the best group we have had,\" tournament director Tony Driscoll said.\n\nThe list could change between now and the time the tournament is played April 11-19 at the Lakewood Ranch Tennis Center, but it will also be enhanced by four wild cards that are still available.\n\nTopping the field of the top 22 players now committed in ranking is Federico Delbonis of Argentina at No. 77, but leading the list in name recognition is Radek Stepanek, a part-time Bradenton resident who is currently ranked No. 86 and getting ready to come back from an injury.\n\nStepanek, who often works with Bradenton resident Petr Korda, has a career-high ranking of No. 8. The third oldest player currently competing on the ATP Tour, Stepanek, 36, had his 2014 season cut short because of a back injury.\n\nBorn in the Czech Republic, Stepanek has won five singles titles and reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 2006. He has also been a member of the winning Czech Republic Davis Cup team and won a pair of Grand Slam titles — U.S. Open and Australian Open — in doubles.\n\nDelbonis won Brasil Open in 2014 and reached a career high of No. 34 last year.\n\nAlso among the players ticketed for the main draw is Bradenton resident Ryan Harrison, who was the No. 2 seeded player in the 2013 Sarasota Open and Paolo Lorenzi, a finalist in the 2012 Sarasota Open who has a career-high ranking of No. 49 and is now ranked 87.\n\nAmong the players currently scheduled for qualifying is Alex Kuznetsov, the 2013 Sarasota Open champion, Michael Russell, who was the top-seeded player in the 2013 tournament and Robbie Ginepri, who was once ranked No. 15 in the world.\n\nFor more tournament and ticket information, visit sarasotaopen.org or call (941) 444-3952."
