Come to the River Olše valley at the edge of the Beskydy Mountains and visit a town founded on the trade route from Hungary to the Baltic. Find out more about its chequered history. Although in the past Karviná was usually connected with coal mining, its present days are far from it. A wide choice of tourist opportunities, historic sights and spa facilities make Karvina the perfect place for your holiday.
