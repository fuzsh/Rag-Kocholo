The documentary film Hot Coffee explores the famous McDonald's hot coffee case and presents a side of the case you may not be familiar with. Filmmaker and public interest lawyer Susan Saladoff uses the legal battle that began with a spilled cup of coffee to investigate what's behind America's zeal for tort “reform.”
