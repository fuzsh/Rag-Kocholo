        "text": "There’s an ideal in our collective cultural mind of the first-time director at the Sundance Film Festival: a wet-behind-the-ears young thing just out of film school, putting a movie together with baling wire, duct tape and maxed-out credit cards, and becoming famous (and, not incidentally, rich) after debuting his or her celluloid baby in a Park City, Utah, screening room one sunny, freezing January day.\n\nSusan Saladoff\n\nisn’t that director.\n\nOh, some of that stereotypical story fits her perfectly, mind you. Just this past winter, at Sundance 2011, she premiered her first feature film, the documentary\n\nto great acclaim from audiences and\n\nand secured a deal from\n\nThe film has played at dozens of film festivals all over North America, winning prizes in Florida and Seattle, and has been acquired for distribution in theaters and on home media.\n\nSo the whole overnight success thing is there.\n\nBut Saladoff isn’t some wunderkind who has been wanting to make movies since infancy and grew up on a diet of “Star Wars” and YouTube. Rather, the 13-year Ashland resident is a distinguished attorney of decades of experience who got into filmmaking not because she wanted to prove herself another Steven Spielberg but because she felt that a crucial part of American democracy was crumbling and that the public had to know about it.\n\nSaladoff spent much of her legal career as a malpractice, consumer rights, and civil injuries lawyer, and she watched with frustration and anger as the so-called ‘tort reform’ movement of the past decades eroded American citizens’ constitutional right to petition the courts for redress when they were wronged by corporations and physicians.\n\n“The public is being duped,” she declares. “The information we get is distorted by lots of money and by public relations campaigns. I got tired of waiting for somebody else to tell the truth and get the message out. The other side was so good at it, and I kept waiting and finally I said, ‘Damn it: I’m gonna do it.’”\n\nIn “Hot Coffee,” Saladoff details the various ways in which, as she puts it, “corporate America is buying out our civil justice system, and we’re losing our constitutional rights every day.” Using such phrases as “frivolous lawsuits,” the U. S. Chamber of Commerce and other pro-corporate lobbying groups have sought to paint all consumers who fight corporations in the courts as greedy abusers of the system, and they have been winning in the realm of public opinion as well as in state and federal legislatures and courts.\n\n“Hot Coffee,” Saladoff explains, is an effort to push back. “I never made this film to 1) make a lot of money or 2) to become a filmmaker,” she says. “I made it because I had something to say and nobody was saying it. The truth wasn’t getting out. Only one side of the story was getting out. A jury gets to decide based on both sides of a story, but for 25 years the American public has only heard one side of this story.”\n\nIn truth, Saladoff was already something of an amateur filmmaker. Over her years as a trial attorney, Saladoff had made a couple of short films to illustrate various aspects of her cases to juries and fellow attorneys, and she even made some comic roast films to honor colleagues at celebrations. But she had no experience of lighting, photographing, editing, or scoring a feature film, and she had no idea what kind of ride she was setting out on. “I thought I was taking a one-year sabbatical and during it I was going to make a movie,” she reveals. “I said to my producer, ‘We can do this in one year.’ And she said, ‘Uh, reality check....’”\n\nUndaunted by the prospect of teaching herself filmmaking, Saladoff set out on the unlikely quest to turn the complex issues of civil justice and tort reform into something that would, in its way, entertain audiences while educating them about what was happening to their ability to access the court system.\n\nThe film that resulted from her efforts is, it happens, entertaining. But it is also fact-filled, eye-opening and deeply disturbing. “Hot Coffee” demonstrates how a carefully orchestrated public relations campaign has distorted the truth about the civil justice system; it details the impact of capping limits on injury awards; it chronicles the attacks made on judges who defend the rights of individuals to use the courts; and it reveals the commonplace (and frankly frightening) mechanisms by which virtually every American has signed away the right to seek redress in front of a judge and jury.\n\n“Hot Coffee” takes its title from one of the most notorious lawsuits of recent decades, maybe of all time: the case of\n\nYou probably think you know the story behind the 1994 trial -- and you’re probably wrong. Here are the undisputed facts: The victim, 79-year-old Stella Liebeck, wasn’t the driver of the car in which the spill happened, nor, indeed, was the car moving; she suffered third-degree burns over six percent of her body (mainly the thigh, buttocks and groin) and lesser burns over an additional 10 percent of her body; she spent eight days in the hospital receiving skin grafts, lost 20 percent of her body weight, and required two years of medical care as follow-up.\n\nLiebeck initially asked McDonald’s for $20,000 to pay for medical care and loss of income (prior to being burned, she was still vital and employed); the company instead offered her $800. When her lawyer investigated the company, he found that McDonald’s had been maintaining their hot beverages at 180-190 degrees despite more than 700 reports of injuries from spills; at the trial, a McDonald’s manager testified that he wouldn’t -- indeed,\n\ncouldn't\n\n-- drink anything that hot. The jury found for Liebeck and awarded her $2.9 million -- a sum equivalent to a mere two days’ worth of coffee sales at all McDonald’s nationwide. (The award was cut to $640,000 and then cut again in a settlement aimed at avoiding further litigation.)\n\nWhen she decided to make the film, Saladoff knew that the Liebeck case had to be front and center, but the woman’s family were reluctant to participate. They’d seen their mother, who died in 2004, mocked by comedians and sitcom writers and used as shorthand for the notion that greedy consumers are constantly seeking unfair sums from innocent corporations. At a lunchtime meeting with Saladoff, Liebeck’s son, demonstrating why he didn’t want to participate in the film, asked their waitress, without identifying himself, if she knew anything about the case; the woman answered, predictably, that she did and then spoke authoritatively about the money-hungry old lady who tricked McDonald’s out of millions.\n\nBut eventually Liebeck’s family did agree to participate, and was joined in telling its story by several other families and individuals who found that the ‘tort reform’ movement had severely limited their access to the justice system. “Hot Coffee” also tells the stories of a Nebraska boy who will require a lifetime of all-day care after a physician’s error during his birth (his identical twin brother was delivered normally) but whose family had to accept a severely curtailed award for his needs; a Mississippi judge who favored consumer rights and was chased off the bench by an election campaign funded by millions of out-of-state dollars and by twice-disproven charges of corruption; and a Texas woman who was drugged and gang-raped by fellow employees in her first week of work in Iraq for a U. S. military contractor and then learned that she couldn’t sue or press criminal charges because she’d signed a binding arbitration clause as part of her employment contract.\n\nIt’s hard to say which of these stories is the more provocative, but the net effect is deeply convincing. Saladoff tested a rough cut of the film with a select group in Phoenix, Arizona viewers -- “a very conservative group,” she says. “And 14 out of 15 said afterwards that they had changed their minds about the civil justice system.”\n\nSaladoff’s road to Sundance and beyond actually began at Sundance. She attended the 2009 festival as a member of the moviegoing public, taking notes about how other documentarians told complex stories. Then she went about researching the stories she’d tell, contacting principals and experts to interview, and acquiring the budget for the project.\n\nWhen it came to assembling the film, she relied on lessons she learned as an attorney. “You know, in many ways I put this together like I would prepare for a trial,” she explains. “I had the stories and I wanted, originally, to weave them all together and overlap them, but that wasn’t happening. And that’s when I realized that I’m a lawyer and these are exhibits, and so we used the graphics of an exhibit box and file folders to show that they all went together. And we go through them in order, and then at the end we go back to each one to present action items for the audience who wants to follow up.”\n\nSince first hearing back in November that “Hot Coffee” had been accepted to Sundance, Saladoff has been bracing for backlash from the corporate interests who have thus far been so successful in unilaterally shaping conversation about the civil justice system. “I usually start the Q-and-A session after screenings by asking ‘Will the representative of the US Chamber of Commerce please identify his- or herself?,’” she jokes.\n\nAnd she knows that her own career might tend to make her and her message easy for opponents to dismiss: she is, for instance, past president of\n\n, a nationwide law firm dedicated to ensuring that citizens retain their constitutional rights to use the courts when they’ve been wronged.\n\nBut she is entirely forthright about who she is and where she’s coming from. “I’m not trying to hide anything,” she declares. “I’m not trying to fool anybody. I have a point of view based on 25 years of professional experience and living this life. And my point of view is that we as a society are giving up our rights to our third branch of government, and the only people who benefit from that are corporations, and we as individuals are getting screwed.”\n\nUltimately, she feels, the audience of “Hot Coffee” will, like jurors, decide if she’s being fair. And they are the only sort of jury she plans on addressing for a while. On the strength of her post-Sundance success, which is still unfolding, she is working up toward making a second documentary feature.\n\n“I have loved this process every step of the way,” she says, adding with a laugh: “It really beats the hell out of practicing law.”"
