Starring John Travolta, Robert Duvall. A well told story based on Jonathan Harr's book of a true story involving a class action lawsuit against environmental polluters that involves multiple ups and downs including the potential bankruptcy of the lawyer (played by John Travolta) handling the case. Read Roger Ebert's review (3.5 out of 4 stars).\n\nClass Action (1991). Starring Gene Hackman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. An unlikely scenario where father and daughter act on opposite sides on a products liability case involving cars that explode. He is the liberal plaintiff's lawyer, representing the underdog, she is a corporate type, acting for the defendant. Read Roger Ebert's review (3 out of 4 stars).\n\nHot Coffee (2011). Directed by Susan Saladoff. This documentary, based in part on the spilled hot coffee lawsuit in Liebeck v Macdonald's Restaurants, discusses the need for tort reform in the United States.\n\nLiar, Liar (1997). Starring Jim Carrey. A young boys wish that his father not be able to lie for 24 hours comes true but haunts his father (played by Carrey), a lawyer whose court appearances require him to \"bend the truth\" on behalf of his client. Some fairly funny courtroom scenes involving Carrey. Read Roger Ebert's review (3 out of 4 stars).\n\nMiracle on 34th Street (1994). Starring Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle. This modern remake of the 1934 \"classic\" recounts the story of a young girl who questions the existence of Santa Clause. When the Macy's Santa Clause, who claims to be the real Kris Kringle, is institutionalized, he is defended in court by the boyfriend of the young girl's mother who tries to prove his client is not insane. Read Roger Ebert's review (3 out of 4 stars).\n\nMisconduct (2016). Starring Josh Duhamel, Anthony Hopkins, Al Pacino. This drama appears to involve a pharmaceutical executive caught up in blackmail and a class action lawsuit, as per its Wikipedia entry. I say \"appears\" since I have not yet seen it, and although it is on Netflix Canada, (after what appeared to be a very limited theatrical release), it hovers only in the 7% approval rating range on Rotten Tomatoes so I will eventually try to watch it.\n\nNorth Country (2005): For some reason, I was never a huge fan of Charlize Theron, but she does a good job in this story as a mistreated female employee in a male-dominated workforce in a mine in Minnesota, based on a true story, that resulted in the first class action sexual harassment lawsuit in the United States (the Wikipedia entry here has a nice overview of the real-life lawsuit). Read Roger Ebert's review here.\n\nThe Rainmaker (1997). Starring Matt Damon and Danny DeVito. A dramatization of the John Grisham novel that tells the story of a young lawyer (played by Damon) who teams up with a grizzled veteran (played by DeVito) to take a case against an insurance company that is denying medical coverage for a dying boy. Read Roger Ebert's review (3 out of 4 stars).\n\nThe Social Network (2010). Starring Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake and directed by David Fincher with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. This dramatization of the early days in the history of Facebook is told largely through flashbacks from examination for discovery transcripts related to lawsuits between the founders of Facebook, including Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg). Aside from the litigation issues itself, there are stories of legal intrigue relating to private equity investment and the role played by Sean Parker of Napster fame (played by Justin Timberlake). issues of intellectual property, and issues of privacy law.\n\nThe Trial (1963). Starring Anthony Perkins. Directed by Orson Welles. Based on the classic novel by Franz Kafka, it tells the nightmarish story of Josef K who is arrested one morning and put on trial despite never really knowing what the charges are. A must view (or read) for any law student. Read Roger Ebert's 4 out of 4 stars review here.\n\nTrial and Error (1997). A fairly silly comedy in which Michael Richards, who plays an actor, agrees to step in and \"act\" in place of his friend, a lawyer played by Jeff Daniels, who is sick/hungover and cannot appear in court. Hilarity ensues since, as can be imagined, the Michael Richards character of course knows nothing of trial procedure or the law. Roger Ebert's 3 star review is here.\n\nThe Verdict (1982). Starring Paul Newman, James Mason. Directed by Sidney Lumet. A good courtroom drama involving Paul Newman as a down-and-out lawyer who is forced to \"crash\" funerals and wakes looking to drum up business. When he takes a medical malpractice case on a contingency basis, he encounters a strong defence from the defendant. Make sure to yell \"objection\" in a loud voice during some of the courtroom scenes where rules of civil procedure are ignored in favour of dramatic tension. Read Roger Ebert's 4 star review here.\n\nContract Law\n\nThe Paper Chase (1973). Starring Timothy Bottoms, Lindsay \"The Bionic Woman\" Wagner and John Houseman as Professor Kingsfield. The now classic \"must see\" movie for law students about the struggles of a first-year law student and the battles he faces with his contracts professor (especially after he finds out he has been dating his daughter). Now somewhat dated, it is still a lot of fun to watch. Note the scenes with the law librarian. Parts of the movie were filmed in Toronto. Houseman won the Academy Award for his performance. Read the original New York Times review here.\n\nShrek Forever After (2010). In Shrek and the Law of Contract, Dr Eoin ODell neatly describes the contractual theories that apply to this tale of Shrek's Faustian bargain with the evil Rumpelstiltskin, as described in the IMDB summary, \"to get back to feeling like a real ogre again, but when he's duped and sent to a twisted version of Far Far Away  where Rumpelstiltskin is king, ogres are hunted, and he and Fiona have never met  he sets out to restore his world and reclaim his true love.\"\n\nWorth (2020). Directed by Sara Colangelo. Starring Michael Keaton as Kenneth Feinberg, appointed Special Master of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund and Amy Ryan as Camille Biros, law partner to Feinberg, appointed as his administrative deputy. Feinberg is tasked with difficult job of coordinating payments to victims of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nCorporate Law\n\nBillions (2016 to current). Starring Paul Giamatti (as \"Chuck Rhoades\"), a New York district attorney battling Damian Lewis (as \"Bobby Axelrod\" or \"Ax\"), the head of wildly successful hedge fund. Delicious behind-the-scene-dramas in the office of the district attorney. Ax's criminal defence lawyer (brilliantly played by Glenn Fleshler) also has a number of highly interesting scenes.\n\nThe Laundromat (2019). Directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring Gary Oldman (playing lawyer Jürgen Mossack) and Antonio Banderas (playing lawyer Ramón Fonseca). This drama, available on Netflix, tells the story of the law firm Mossack Fonseca, caught up in the Panama Papers scandal. This story, about money-laundering and Panamanian shell companies, is narrated by the actors playing the two main lawyers and tells, among other things, the story of a character played by Meryl Streep who investigates why her insurance company refuses to pay a claim for the wrongful death of her husband. The film has a Rotten Tomatoes score in only the low 40 percent range.\n\nOther People's Money (1991). Directed by Norman Jewison and starring Danny DeVito as a corporate raider and Gregory Peck as the patriarch of the company targeted by Danny DeVito. Penelope Ann Miller plays a lawyer, the daughter of the wife of Gregory Peck, who tangles with Danny DeVito's character regarding ownership and survival of the company. See Roger Ebert's 3.5 star review here.\n\nThe Social Network (2010). Starring Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake and directed by David Fincher with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. This dramatization of the early days in the history of Facebook is told largely through flashbacks from examination for discovery transcripts related to lawsuits between the founders of Facebook, including Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg). Aside from the litigation issues itself, there are stories of legal intrigue relating to private equity investment and the role played by Sean Parker of Napster fame (played by Justin Timberlake). issues of intellectual property, and issues of privacy law.\n\nSuccession (2018 to current). This drama series involves a fictional corporate media empire run by family patriarch Logan Roy (played by Brian Cox) and the role his children will play if and when he retires (hence the title of the series). Many scenes relate to corporate intrigue involving potential takeovers with good scenes involving the company's in-house corporate counsel (played by J. Smith-Cameron).\n\nCriminal Law | Death Penalty\n\n13th (2016). Directed by Ava DuVernay. This documentary, nominated for best documentary in 2016 by the Academy Awards and by the same film-maker of Selma, takes its title from the 13th Amendment of the US Constitution, which abolished slavery. By focusing on the disproportionate amount of African-Americans (and other people of color) in US jails, the film discusses US history following the abolishment of slavery and the extent to which the exception in the 13th amendment for \"punishment for crime\" has substituted the initial form of abolished slavery into one that has seen Jim Crow laws, segregation, and mass incarceration as a new form of slavery. The movie has a very high approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, hovering in the 97% range.\n\nThe Accused (1988). Starring: Kelly McGillis, Jody Foster. Courtroom drama involving rape victim Sarah Tobias (played by Jody Foster) who at times seems to be the one on trial. Read Roger Ebert's review (3 stars).\n\nAnatomy of a Murder (1959). Starring Jimmy Stewart, Lee Remick, Ben Gazzara, directed by Otto Preminger. A courtroom drama involving a murder trial where the accused, a lieutenant in the army, is charged with murdering a bar owner who had raped his wife. Will the defence of temporary insanity prevail? Multiple Academy Award nominations. Read an online review from the New York Times.\n\nAnd Justice for All (1979). Starring Al Pacino, directed by Norman Jewison (a University of Toronto graduate). Al Pacino defends a judge who is charged with rape, a judge with whom he has had run-ins in the past. A good examination of the justice system, corruption and legal ethics. Read Roger Ebert's review (3 stars).\n\nBeyond a Reasonable Doubt (2009). Starring Michael Douglas, Jesse Metcalfe, and Amber Tamblyn. An extremely implausible story (and Hollywood remake of a better 1956 version). It tells the story of a journalist who suspects that the publicity-seeking District Attorney (played by Michael Douglas) has too good of a conviction rate and might be causing evidence to be planted at crime scenes. What the journalist does next is stupid (in allowing himself to be framed for murder in order to see if the D.A. will plant evidence against him). Stereotypical courtroom scenes with a \"You better be going somewhere counsellor\" judge. Read the Rotten Tomatoes reviews here.\n\nBody Heat (1981): Although not really law-related per se, this drama, directed by Lawrence Kasdan, tells the story of a not very reputable small town lawyer, played by William Hurt, and his affair with a married woman, played by Kathleen Turner, and their plot to murder her husband. Read Roger Ebert's review here.\n\nBody of Evidence (1993). Starring Madonna, Willem Dafoe, Joe Mantegna, Anne Archer, and one of Julianne Moore's earlier movie roles. A fairly implausible story of an accused (play by Madonna) charged with murdering a wealthy old man for his money (through sex). Joe Mantegna plays the prosecutor; Willem Dafoe plays her lawyer. Many stereotypical courtroom scenes. See the original New York Times review here.\n\nCapturing the Friedmans (2003). Directed by Andrew Jarecki. A captivating documentary of a high school teacher, his wife and their three sons and their involvement in the criminal justice system when the father and youngest son are charged with sexual crimes involving children. The movie's tagline  \"Who do you believe?\"  is reflected in the questions raised by the director regarding the prosecution and defence of the accused. Read Roger Ebert's online review (3.5 out of 4 stars).\n\nThe Central Park Five (2012). Directed by Ken Burns, Sarah Burns and David McMahon. This documentary tells the stories of five young black men who in 1989 were charged and convicted of a grisly rape in Central Park, New York, despite their claims of innocence based on what were alleged false confessions. Read Roger Ebert's online review (3.5 out of 4 stars).\n\nThe Chamber (1996). Starring Chris O'Donnell, Gene Hackman and Faye Dunaway. Based on John Grisham's novel, the story of a young lawyer who defends his racist grandfather who is on death row for murdering two Jewish boys.

Read Roger Ebert's review (2.5 stars out of 4).\n\nClosed Circuit (2013) Directed by John Crowley and starring Eric Bana (as defence lawyer Martin Rose) and Jim Broadbent (as the Attorney General of England and Wales). This drama relates to the prosecution of an alleged terrorist bomber in London using the court's \"closed material\" procedures where trials are partially closed to the public due to national security interests (with a sub-plot of a romance between the defence lawyer and an MI5 agent played by Rebecca Hall). The film has a Rotten Tomatoes score in only the low 40 percent range.\n\nCompulsion (1959): This is one I was surprised I had never seen. Orson Welles stars as a defence lawyer in what IMDB describes as: Two wealthy law-school students go on trial for murder in this version of the Leopold-Loeb case. Read the original New York Times review here.\n\nThe Conspirator (2010). Directed by Robert Redford and starring James McAvoy, Robin Wright, Kevin Kline, Evan Rachel Wood and Tom Wilkinson. James McAvoy plays the young lawyer assigned to defend Mary Surratt (played by Robin Wright), the mother of the alleged co-conspirator of John Wilkes Booth in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, arrested for failing to provide the location of her son.\n\nConviction (2010). Directed by Tony Goldwyn and starring Hilary Swank and Sam Rockwell. Tells the true story of Bette Ann Waters, a single mother whose brother was (as it turns out) wrongfully convicted of murder.

Read Roger Ebert's review (3 out of 4 stars).\n\nDead Man Walking (1995). Starring Susan Sarandon, Sean Penn. A well told story of a nun (played by Susan Sarandon) who visits and cares for a prisoner on death row (played by Sean Penn). The movie raises important questions about the ethics of the death penalty versus the impact of crime on victims and their families and spirituality and forgiveness. Read Roger Ebert's review (4 out of 4 stars).\n\nThe Fear of 13 (2015). Directed by David Sington. This documentary tells the story of death row inmate Nick Yarris, who at one point in his incarceration, requests that his death penalty be carried out despite the possibility that he is innocent of the crime he is charged with (no more details provided to avoid spoiler alerts).\n\nFracture (2007): I saw this movie when it came out and thought it was a bit silly. It is a courtroom drama of a young prosecutor, played by Ryan Gosling, prosecuting his last murder case before jumping ship to become a plaintiffs lawyer. The prosecution is of a wealthy businessman, played by Anthony Hopkins. It seems like an open-and-shut case, but is not. To avoid any spoiler alerts, I wont say anything more. Read Geoff Pevere's review here.\n\nGhosts of Mississippi (1996): Rob Reiner directed this courtroom drama, based on a true story of the trial of a white supremacist (played by James Wood) accused of murdering civil rights activist Medgar Evers in 1963. Alec Baldwin plays the prosecutor who brings charges years after the murder with the support of Everss spouse, played by Whoopi Goldberg. Read Roger Ebert's review here (2.5 of 4 stars).\n\nGideons Trumpet (1980): This is one I dont recall seeing. It appears to have been a TV movie starring Henry Fonda playing Clarence Gideon based on the true story of a Florida convict who seeks the right to have counsel appointed. His claim for such a right ended up in a Supreme Court ruling in his favour in Gideon v Wainwright, 372 US 335 (1963).\n\nGive up Tomorrow (2011). Directed by Michael Collins. This documentary tells the story of the criminal prosecution in the Philippines of Paco and six other young men for the alleged rape and murder of two women. It portrays a criminal justice system rife with corruption and injustice. The film has a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nGoliath (series) (2016-current) (Prime Video). Created by David E. Kelley and Jonathan Shapiro and starring Billy Bob Thornton as lawyer Billy McBride. Currently available in its second season (with a different storyline in each season), the courtroom drama features a delicious portrayal of a brilliant but slightly sketchy street lawyer who was formerly a partner in a large Los Angeles law firm against whom he does battle in Season 1 in a courtroom trial about corporate coverup by a military defence contractor (with apparently no concern for the concept of conflicts of interest). Highly recommended.\n\nGuilty as Sin (1993). Sidney Lumet directs Starring Rebecca as a female defense attorney defending Don Johnson, accused of murdering his wife. Fairly typically Hollywood portrayal of lawyers and the legal system and the ethical dilemmas facing criminal lawyers. Read Roger Ebert's 3-star review here.\n\nThe Hurricane (1999). Starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman Jewison. Tells the true story of Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter's wrongful imprisonment on murder charges and the efforts made by his lawyers to free him from prison.

This documentary, directed by Justin Webster, tells the story of Rodrigo Rosenberg, a Guatemalan lawyer, who predicted his own murder, suggesting by video that if he was found murdered that he was killed by the President. This fascinating film documents a number of conspiracy theory twists and turns.\n\nIn Cold Blood (1967). Based on Truman Capote's \"fictional\" re-telling of a true crime story of two drifters who brutally murder a farm family during a botched robbery. One of the criminals is played by Robert Blake, who himself was later charged (but acquitted) in the murder of his wife. Read Roger Ebert's review here.\n\nIn the Name of the Father (1993): Based (loosely, as noted by Roger Ebert) on the true story of the Guildford Four wrongfully accused of an IRA bombing of a British pub in 1974, this drama has Emma Thompson playing the hard-working defence lawyer and focuses on the trials and tribulations of Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his father (Pete Postlethwaite) wrongfully convicted for the crimes.

Loosely based on the true story of the 1925 \"Scopes monkey trial\" involving the prosecution of a teacher for teaching Darwin's theories of evolution. Read an online review.\n\nJagged Edge (1985). Starring Glenn Close, Jeff Bridges. A fairly absurd murder mystery / trial movie in which the defence lawyer (played by Close) start to fall in love with her client (played by Bridges), who is accused of murdering his wealthy wife. Read Roger Ebert's review (3.5 out of 4 stars).\n\nThe Judge (2014 film). Starring Robert Duvall as the judge and Robert Downey,Jr as his son, a lawyer who ends up defending his father in court. Despite having these two strong lead actors, the movie was not well-received, in party due to its schmaltzy story line. Not necessarily recommended.\n\nJust Cause (1995). Starring Sean Connery, Laurence Fishburne. The story of a young man accused of murder and facing the electric chair. Can Law Professor Paul Armstrong (played by Sean Connery) save his client? Read Roger Ebert's review (2 out of 4 stars).\n\nJust Mercy (2019). Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton and starring Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx.

Jordan), to reverse his wrongful conviction. Note: this movie is premiering at TIFF in September 2019 and is not slated for wider release until later in the year.\n\nKids for Cash (2013). Directed by Robert May. This documentary tells the story of the \"kids for cash scandal\" involving private juvenile jails and allegations against two judges who were alleged to have received payments from these private facilities for sentencing young offenders to those institutions.\n\nLegal Eagles (1986). Starring Robert Redford, Debra Winger and Darryl Hannah. A prosecutor (played by Redford) starts to fall for a defence lawyer (played by Winger) and gets involved with her defence of an off-the-wall performance artist (planned by Hannah).

Based on a true story in the early 1950's in England where two young men are tried for and found guilty of the murder of a policeman. One of the young men avoids the death penalty because of his age but the other is hanged, despite his having the mental capacity of a young child. Gripping courtroom scenes (based on actual transcripts). An excellent movie. Read Roger Ebert's review (3.5 out of 4 stars).\n\nLong Shot (2017). This short documentary, available on Netflix Canada, tells the story of Juan Catalan, convicted for a murder he says he didn't commit in Los Angeles and the efforts of his lawyer, Todd Melnik. If you have not heard of the \"long shot\" involved in his defence, I have intentionally not described what happens. Essential viewing.\n\nM (1931). Directed by Fritz Lang. Tells the story of a child murderer in Germany and the police hunt to track him down, resulting in a staged trial used to force a confession from the accused and obtain a conviction, making the point of the importance of legal representation in criminal trials to ensure justice, even for the most abhorrent crimes.\n\nMaking a Murderer (2015, 2018). This 10-episode documentary with a 10-episode second season released in 2018 (and both available on Netflix Canada), tells the story of Steven Avery, and his fight within the Wisconsin judicial system regarding his wrongful conviction for rape and his fight with the police officers who put in him jail (note: this summary is brief to avoid including spoiler alerts). A compelling story.\n\nMurder in the First (1995). Starring Christian Slater, Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman.

Strong courtroom (and prison) scenes Read Roger Ebert's review (2 of out 4 stars).\n\nMusic Box (1989): I remember seeing this movie as a young lawyer being bothered by the improbability or inappropriateness of a daughter representing her father against charges of war crimes.

Read Roger Ebert's review here.\n\nMy Cousin Vinny (1992). Starring Joe Pesci, Marisa Tomei (and Fred Gwynne as the Judge). A funny courtroom drama in which a bumbling and newly-called New York lawyer (played by Pesci) is asked by his nephew and his nephew's friend to save them from wrongful murder charges in a \"redneck\" Alabama court system.

In the movie  as in real life  the family defends the honour of the young lad who is eventually exonerated. However, in what was a first of its kind, the family then goes on to petition the U.K. Parliament for compensation for the wrongful prosecution. Read Roger Ebert's review here.\n\nThe Witness (2016). Directed by James Solomon. This documentary follows William Genovese, the brother of Kitty Genovese, as he seeks to better understand his sister's death in Queen's, New York, in 1964, a crime made famous by so-called \"bystander apathy\" where it was alleged over 30 persons witnessed or heard the crime being committed but failed to get involved.

Read the original New York Times review here.\n\nThe Young Philadelphians (1959): We of course have seen Paul Newman as a veteran lawyer in The Verdict. Here he plays a young, rising lawyer in Philadelphia. This is another older movie I have not seen.

This award-winning Russian film tells the story of a Russian man and his wife whose house and property is targeted by a small-town, corrupt Russian Mayor seeking to illegally expropriate the couple's property.

By focusing on the disproportionate amount of African-Americans (and other people of color) in US jails, the film discusses US history following the abolishment of slavery and the extent to which the exception in the 13th amendment for \"punishment for crime\" has substituted the initial form of abolished slavery into one that has seen Jim Crow laws, segregation, and mass incarceration as a new form of slavery.

The Simpsons take on this movie (with Homer being the lone holdout juror) is from Season 5 (The Boy Who Knew Too Much).\n\nThe Juror (1996). Starring Demi Moore, Alec Baldwin.

I seriously debated whether to include a Pauly Shore movie and may regret its inclusion. However, the cast includes Stanley Tucci. The story, if it matters, is the comedic notion - stretched for 86 minutes - that the Pauly Shore character realizes it is in his interest as a jury member on a criminal trial to stretch the duration of the trial to continue to earn his \"per diem\" stipend. Janet Maslin's original New York Times review pretty much sums it up with this comment: \"If you have odd socks that need matching, you've got something better to do than watching Jury Duty.\"\n\nRunaway Jury (2003). Starring John Cusack, Rachel Weisz, Dustin Hoffman, and Gene Hackman.

A fairly light comedy about a sorority girl (played by Witherspoon) who applies to Harvard Law School in order to \"show up\" her ex-boyfriend, also accepted at Harvard. She soon discovers her pre-law skills serve her well in defending a client charged with murder. Some fairly preposterous court scenes, but this is a comedy after all, not a documentary. Good for a few laughs if you are willing to ignore rules of evidence and civil procedure. Read the original New York Times review here.\n\nMichael Clayton (2007). Starring George Clooney, Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson. This movie tells the story of lawyer Michael Clayton, played by Clooney, who is described as the law firm's \"fixer\" or \"janitor,\" cleaning up the \"messes\" of the firm or its clients. In this case, it is a large corporate client sued for environmental pollution (Swinton is superb as the in-house general counsel), represented by a lawyer (played by Wilkinson) from the firm who suffers a nervous breakdown, thereby jeopardizing the client's defence. Read Roger Ebert's review (4 out of 4 stars).\n\nThe Paper Chase (1973). Starring Timothy Bottoms, Lindsay \"The Bionic Woman\" Wagner and John Houseman as Professor Kingsfield. The now classic \"must see\" movie for law students about the struggles of a first-year law student and the battles he faces with his contracts professor (especially after he finds out he has been dating his daughter). Now somewhat dated, it is still a lot of fun to watch. Note the scenes with the law librarian. Parts of the movie were filmed in Toronto. Houseman won the Academy Award for his performance. Read the original New York Times review here.\n\nPhiladelphia (1993). Starring Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington. Tom Hanks plays a successful lawyer fired by his law firm because he has AIDS.

A court-martial drama in which a lawyer/military man (played by Tommy Lee Jones) agrees to defend his colleague (played by Jackson) who is charged of breach of duty for a botched embassy rescue mission.

Directed by Canadian Norman Jewison and starring Howard Rollins, Adolph Caesar, Robert Townsend and, in one of his earlier roles, Denzel Washington. Although the movie is a military criminal investigation, I have included it here (and under \"Court Martial movies, even though it is not really a court martial movie).

This documentary, which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2014, tells the story of Edward Snowden and his whistle-blowing of what he regarded as illegal or excessive wiretapping by the NSA. The movie raises issues of privacy, national security, whistle-blowing, and state immunity.\n\nDefending Your Life (1991). Starring Albert Brooks, Meryl Streep. Only marginally law-related, this comedy is the story of Daniel Miller who, after being killed in a car accident, must \"defend\" his life before a tribunal in Judgment City, a sort of waiting room for the afterlife. Read Roger Ebert's review (3.5 out of 4 stars).\n\nDiva (1981). Only marginally law-related. I decided to include this movie since it was included in a University of Chicago Law School Film Festival, presumably because of the copyright issues raised by bootleg concert tapes. The movie tells the story of a young man who makes a bootleg recording of an elusive opera singer. His tape gets mixed up with a surveillance tape and he is chased through the streets of Paris on his motor-scooter with some of the best chase scenes ever. Very art-filmish in its look and feel. Read Roger Ebert's review.\n\nEight Men Out (1988). Cast of many, directed by John Sayles. Tells the true story of the 1919 Chicago White Sox players who took bribes to lose the World Series. Involves court room scenes. Read Roger Ebert's review (2 out of 4 stars).\n\nA Fish Called Wanda (1998). Starring John Cleese, Kevin Kline, Eric Idle and Jamie Lee Curtis. A hilarious movie in which John Cleese plays a barrister who gets tangled up with a group of bungling diamond thieves. Extremely funny. Only marginally law related but the funny scenes with Cleese getting caught dancing in the buff are worth it. Read Roger Ebert's review (4 out of 4 stars).\n\nGandhi (1982). Starring Ben Kingsley and a cast of thousands. Directed by Richard Attenborough.

Nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, this Lebanese drama tells the story of an insult by a Lebanese Christian apartment owner of a Palestinian refugee worker fixing the gutter at the apartment building that results in an assault and a subsequent lawsuit that exposes the complicated nature of life and politics in the Middle East. Rotten Tomatoes rates this movie here at 88%.\n\nJFK (1991). Starring Kevin Costner and a cast of thousands. Director Oliver Stone's recounting of John F.

Starring Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love and Edward Norton as the lawyer. Directed by Milos Forman. A bio-pic that tells the story of Hustler founder Larry Flynt and his \"battle\" to defend his freedom of expression (to publish men's magazines and to parody public figures). Some nice courtroom scenes and discussions of the issue of freedom of expression. Some viewers may find other content objectionable. Read Roger Ebert's review (4 out of 4 stars).\n\nSilkwood (1983). Starring Cher, Meryl Streep. Arguably not a law-related movie in the \"lawyer\" sense but it is a good movie about law-related themes, including unionization of employees and \"whistleblowing\". Based on a true story of contamination at a nuclear plant. Strong performances by Cher and Meryl Streep. Read Roger Ebert's review (4 stars).\n\nThe Story of Qiu Ju (1992). Directed by Zhang Yimou and starring Gong Li. This movie tells the story of Qiu Ju, a peasant woman who fights the Chinese bureaucracy at pursuing justice for injuries caused to her husband by the village chief.

An Atom Egoyan film starring Ian Holm as a class action lawyer who investigates a school bus crash in a small Canadian town that killed 14 students. Although ostensibly a \"class action\" movie, Roger Ebert correctly characterizes the movie as a study on how people handle grief: \"This story is not about lawyers or the law, not about small-town insularity, not about revenge (although that motivates an unexpected turning point). It is more about the living dead--about people carrying on their lives after hope and meaning have gone. The film is so sad, so tender toward its characters. The lawyer, an outsider who might at first seem like the source of more trouble, comes across more like a witness, who regards the stricken parents and sees his own approaching loss of a daughter in their eyes.\" Read his 4 star review here.\n\nTrue Grit (2010). Although perhaps more correctly thought of as a Western than a law-related movie, I have included the Coen Brothers version of this movie for the many law-related references made by the young girl Mattie Ross (played by Hailee Steinfeld) in pursuit of the killer of her father, aided in her efforts by Marshall Rooster Cogburn (played by Jeff Bridges) and Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (played by Matt Damon). An excellent movie on a tale of justice with an entertaining scene early on of a criminal trial during which the character played by Jeff Bridges gives testimony on his role in capturing and shooting a gang of criminals.\n\nWhose Life Is It Anyway? (1981). John Badham directs Richard Dreyfuss who plays an artist paralyzed in a car accident. The movie, based on a play, raises issues of euthanasia and the right of a patient to die and the role of the government or doctors in prolonging life. Actor Bob Balaban plays the lawyer who represents the main character who seeks to be discharged from the hospital where he is being kept alive. Read Janet Maslin's original New York Times review here.\n\nWild Things (1998). Starring Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon, Neve Campbell, Denise Richards and Bill Murray as the lawyer. Only marginally law-related, the movie has some hilarious scenes with a lawyer played by Bill Murray. There are so many twists in this movie, you will be kept on edge. Thoroughly entertaining but perhaps not for all tastes. Read Roger Ebert's review (3 out of 4 stars).\n\nProperty law\n\nFinders Keepers (2015). Documentary directed by Bryan Carberry and Clay Tweel about John Wood and Shannon Whisnant. This documentary tells the bizarre story of John Wood attempting to recover his amputed leg that was inadvertenly purchased by Shannon Whisnant when he bought a BBQ in which the amputed leg was being stored. Although lawyers and the legal system do not play a dominant role, the movie does raise issues of property law and the maxim \"finders keepers.\" The movie has a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nWills & Estates\n\nAll of Me (1984). Starring Steve Martin, Lily Tomlin. A rich but sick millionaire (played by Lily Tomlin) decides to have her soul transferred into the body of a younger women but by mistake her soul ends up in the body of Steve Martin, who plays a lawyer whose body is now partly controlled by Lily Tomlin's character.
