        "text": "Prerequisites: Evidence(LAW 6330)\n\nThis is a nuts-and-bolts one-credit course designed by experienced trial lawyers, judges, and recent graduates to provide aspiring lawyers with the basic, practical tools necessary to be productive and contributing members of a law firm’s civil litigation team. While students will gain an understanding of the lifecycle of a civil case, this course will focus on the components a new law firm associate is most likely to need. Students will receive opportunities to practice and receive feedback from experienced professionals on assignments mirroring those they are likely to be tasked with during their first few years of civil litigation. After taking this course, students should be able to effectively support more experienced attorneys in their law firm from Day One and add value to the legal representation.\n\nThis course is not designed to substitute the Pre-Trial Practice or Trial Practice courses, but rather to supplement those courses by providing an opportunity for focused, hands-on training. While not prerequisites of this course, it is recommended that students take either the Pre-Trial Practice or Trial Practice courses. However, students are required to have successfully completed an Evidence course to enroll in this course.\n\nIf time and opportunity permit, students may observe actual court proceedings.\n\nFor centuries, women have been severely disadvantaged under the common law of England and the United States. Some of those disadvantages are the result of social inequalities, while others are the result of legal disabilities. Over the past 200 years, women have struggled to equalize their legal rights and responsibilities, but gender-based stereotypes and social prejudices have severely hampered that progress. In 1972, after nearly 50 years of yearly introductions, an Equal Rights Amendment (the ERA) was proposed by Congress and sent to the states for ratification. When the deadline finally expired for ratification in 1982, 35 of the requisite 38 states had ratified. But beginning in 2016 there was a push for continued ratification and Nevada and Illinois both ratified the ERA in 2017 and 2018 respectively. All indications are that the ERA will be ratified by Virginia in early 2020, to reach the requisite 38 states. When that happens, there will be a host of unprecedented legal issues facing the courts, Congress, and the states. This course will be an examination of those legal issues through the lens of the ERA. We will begin by examining the procedural issues facing the ERA and the constitutional questions they raise about the amendment power under Article V. We will then examine how, if at all, the ERA might affect the legal rights of women and non-gender-conforming individuals. By examining issues such as family law, property law, labor law, criminal law, health care law, military law, and even the right to single-sex bathrooms, we will explore how, if at all, the ERA might affect the long-entrenched legal disabilities of women. And we will also explore whether we even need an ERA, as the Fourteenth Amendment has been expanded to prohibit sex-based discrimination in certain contexts. Requirements for the course will be extensive research and class participation, weekly or bi-weekly reflection papers, a presentation, and a final essay composition. It will entail significant reading and research and we will be joined by graduate and senior undergraduate students from other departments. There will be both collaborative and individual assignments.\n\nPrerequisites: Evidence(LAW 6330)\n\nThis course is designed for 3Ls who are planning to become civil litigators after graduation. More than 95% of civil cases settle before trial, so most of your legal practice will be “pre-trial” practice. The course therefore offers in-depth study and training in civil litigation up until trial, with the aim of making you practice-ready by the end of semester. We will cover fact and theme development, pleadings, the discovery process—including written requests and responses, motion practice, and depositions—settlement negotiation, and strategic decision-making at each step of the process. You will be assigned to four-person “law firms” and will litigate against an opposing firm in the other section, using a simplified but realistic case file. The sections will sometimes meet together for lecture classes, and you will sometimes receive feedback from the other section’s professor as well as your own. The assignments and workload are the same regardless of which section you join. Please note that although this course is graded Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory, the workload is no less than in any graded course, including near-weekly written assignments.\n\nThe course has two main parts. The first part is broadly introductory and considers such basic issues as:\n\nWhat is religion? Defining religion. Is there a distinctly “legal” definition of religion? Is the “truth” of a religious doctrine ever legally at issue? (United States v. Ballard). Relationship to defamation law. The role of sincerity (Ballard). Should social change affect the interpretation of the Religion Clauses?\n\nWhy protect religion? Religion vs. science. The Bible vs. Darwin. Belief vs. knowledge (Ballard). Relationship to philosophies of free expression. Belief vs. conduct (Reynolds v. United States). The police powers of the states. Standards of review (Carolene Products). Readings in philosophy, social psychology, sociology of knowledge, and the history of religious thought will be considered.\n\nOrigins and theory of the constitutional Religion Clauses. Historical sources and documents. Jefferson’s “wall of separation” between church and state (McCollum v. Board of Education). The Garden and the Wilderness [the church and the world] (Roger Williams, Mark DeWolfe Howe). Interplay between the two Religion Clauses.\n\nSecond part. In this part the main doctrines and caselaw of the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause will be studied. Two or more group presentations will be designed and planned around the two Religion Clauses and possibly additional topics (for example, the role of the Jehovah’s Witnesses in litigating religion law), depending on student interest.\n\nThis compressed course offers an introduction to the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, which provides that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” These provisions, referred to as the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause, are the first rights enumerated by the Founders in the Bill of Rights, and they form the constitutional basis of religious liberty in the United States. This course will first explore the historical and jurisprudential foundations of both Clauses and then address the contours of the provisions as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court, asking how and why the Court’s analysis has evolved. The course will also touch upon statutory causes of action that are closely related to the Religion Clauses, such as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. The goal of the course is to understand the original meaning of the Clauses, their development throughout American history and the Court’s jurisprudence, and to examine potential doctrinal directions of the pressing issues in the religious-liberty field of litigation.\n\nThe Florida Constitutional Law Endowment in memory of Justice Ben F. Overton was created by Judge Karen Miller in 2013. This fund supports lectures and presentations by Justices of the Florida Supreme Court at the Fredric G. Levin College of Law.\n\nHISTORY\n\nJustice Overton, who earned his B.S. in 1951 and his Juris Doctor in 1952 from the University of Florida, was the first merit appointment to the Florida Supreme Court. Throughout his career he was active in legal education and served as an Adjunct Professor at the Levin College of Law through December 2012, the month of his death. Although he resided at Oak Hammock at the University of Florida, a continuing care retirement community developed in cooperation with UF, he also considered the Florida Supreme Court “home.” Among the high points of his later years was hosting Justices of the Florida Supreme Court in Gainesville and taking his class to Tallahassee to hear oral arguments at the Florida Supreme Court.\n\nJudge Miller, who earned her B.S. cum laude from New York University in 1974 and her Juris Doctor from New York Law School in 1977, served as Chief Administrative Law Judge of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, New York City’s business regulatory agency, before she retired to Oak Hammock at the University of Florida. Having accompanied Justice Overton on his excursions to Tallahassee and joined him in welcoming guests to Oak Hammock at the University of Florida, she created the endowment in memory of Justice Overton to ensure that the Levin College of Law continues to have the funding necessary to continue and enhance the interaction between its students and the Florida Supreme Court.\n\nJudge Miller remembered the event that motivated the endowment.\n\nPrior to a dinner at the home of Dean Robert Jerry and Lisa Jerry shortly after Justice Overton’s death, Justice Barbara Pariente and I were discussing a suitable memorial. Justice Pariente, who had been Justice Overton’s colleague on the Florida Supreme Court and who understood the importance to him of the interaction between his students and the Court, suggested the outline of what has become the Overton lectures. Dean Jerry, who has since retired, as has Dean Emeritus Jon Mills, who assumed responsibility for implementing the Overton lectures, were very supportive from the beginning. Since Dean Mills’ retirement, Professor Timothy McClendon, who assisted both Justice Overton and Dean Mills teaching Florida Constitutional Law and who co-authored the recent Florida Constitutional Law casebook, has continued the Overton lectures with the support of Interim Dean Merritt McAlister and CGR director, Professor Danaya Wright.\n\nJustice Overton was a devoted jurist, educator, and ethical leader of the Florida legal profession. The Overton Lecture Series brings Florida Supreme Court Justices to the University of Florida, Levin College of Law, and serves to introduce students to the inner workings of the Court. CGR and the students of the College of Law extend our deepest gratitude to Judge Karen Miller for making the Overton Lectures possible in perpetuity.\n\nYou can watch an interview for the Florida Historical Society by Mary Adkins, professor emeritus of the UF Levin College of Law, with Justice Overton here.\n\nJustice Overton was also interviewed for the Samuel Proctor Oral History Project and a transcript of his interview is available at the Smathers Library, and here.\n\nJustice Overton sat on the Constitution Revision Commission of 1977-78 that proposed a right to privacy in the Florida Constitution. Although it failed as part of the Constitution Revision Commission recommendations, it passed in 1980 when proposed by the legislature. The bill was co-sponsored by our very own Jon Mills. The privacy provision prevailed by greater than 60%. Justice Overton then wrote a concurrence in a critical reproductive rights case in 1989 affirming that the privacy provision of the Florida Constitution included the right to obtain an abortion. That decision was overruled in Planned Parenthood of SW and Central Florida v. Florida. You can read about the role of Justice Overton, Jon Mills – director emeritus of CGR, and the history of the 1989 case here."
