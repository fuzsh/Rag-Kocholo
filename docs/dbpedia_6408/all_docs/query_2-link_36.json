        "text": "Posting a photo does not require permission of the subject as long as the photo was taken lawfully (i.e. taken when the subject does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy).\n\nDid the subject have a reasonable expectation of privacy when the photo was taken?\n\nSome examples of photos taken when a subject has a reasonable expectation of privacy:\n\nA photo of someone standing in their bedroom in their underwear, taken from the yard outside looking through the window\n\nA photo of someone in a public bathroom, taken with a hidden camera in the bathroom\n\nSome examples of photos taken without a reasonable expectation of privacy:\n\nA photo of someone standing on a public street saying \"You don't have my permission to photograph me\"\n\nA photo of a friend in a friend's house, taken by another friend while at the house, assuming the photographer was not there unlawfully (i.e. was invited)\n\nA photo of another student in class/on campus at school/university, taken by someone lawfully at that place.\n\nThe point is whether the person the photo was taken of could reasonably have expected privacy when the photo was taken.\n\nIf a reasonable person wouldn't expect privacy in the same situation, then you had their permission to take the photo, and then whether or not it is lawful to post (i.e. publish) the photo without their permission becomes the question.\n\nSo is it lawful to post the photo without the subject's permission?\n\nAssuming you took the photo lawfully (i.e. you took the photo with their permission), then you are free to post it (i.e. publish it).\n\nHow about posting a photograph without the photographer's permission?\n\nIf someone else took the photo and owns the copyright, you would need their permission or to purchase the copyright from them, otherwise you could be liable to them for civil damages, even more so if you could reasonably expect to profit from publishing the photo (including adsense revenue on a blog).\n\nIt would be useful to know the circumstances of how the photo was taken and who owns the copyright for your specific example.\n\nI think the above analysis misses the mark in some respects by overplaying the significance of whether you took the picture lawfully and underplaying the significance of what the photo shows.\n\nWhile you're of course in a better position if you didn't commit a crime to obtain the photo, publication could still expose you to a privacy-invasion claim, either for intrusion upon seclusion or for public disclosure of private facts.\n\nLiability would turn in large part on what exactly the picture showed. If the picture was embarrassing because it showed your friend picking her nose, that's probably not going to be actionable. If it shows her having sex, it would be a much stronger basis for liability, regardless of whether you or someone else took the picture legally.\n\nOn the other hand, publishing a relatively innocuous photo you took while trespassing probably wouldn't subject you to any additional liability, though it might be useful evidence in a trespass case.\n\nMost of this remains true even if you weren't the one who took the picture. Regardless of what the photo showed, though, you would have to work about copyright. Unless it shows something newsworthy, sharing the photo on social media is probably going to constitute a copyright violation.\n\nYou can stop a website's use of your image for three reasons: invasion of privacy, violation of right of publicity, or defamation.\n\nInvasion of privacy can occur if you are portrayed falsely and in a highly offensive manner. For example, your photo was posted at an America's Most Wanted type of website, and you are not wanted by the law. Your privacy might also be invaded if the photo was taken by someone who intruded on you in a situation in which you had a reasonable expectation of privacy—for example, in your own home. It is not an invasion of privacy to photograph someone in a public place or at any event where the public is invited.\n\nAnother reason to stop the use is known as the right of publicity. This occurs if your image is used for commercial purposes such as to sell products or to imply that you endorse a product. If the photo is used in a commercial website—that is, one sponsored by a business or that sells products or services—the unauthorized use of your image would probably violate your right of publicity. The public must be able to identify you in the photograph.\n\nYou can also stop the website use if the photo defames you—that is, it creates a false impression and injures your reputation. For example, it would be defamatory to doctor a photo to make it seem as if you were shoplifting. The fact that an unmodified photo is unflattering is not enough to claim defamation. The photo must falsely portray you and must cause people in the community to think less of you.\n\nFinally, if you created the photo, then nobody may publish it without your permission."
