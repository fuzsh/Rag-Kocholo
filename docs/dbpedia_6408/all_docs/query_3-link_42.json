        "text": "Second and Third Year Courses\n\nAdministrative Law\n\n#210 - 2 credits\n\nThis course reviews the legal doctrines that empower and constrain the “fourth branch” of government—administrative agencies. Primary emphasis is placed on case law developed at the federal level; state law is covered where it differs substantially from its federal counterpart. Major topics include the creation of administrative agencies, agency use of power and limits on that power, public and individual participation in agency processes, and judicial review of agency action. Grades will be based on a final in-class exam.\n\nAdvanced Legal Ethics\n\n#236 - 3 credits\n\nIn many ethical decision-making situations that a practicing lawyer will encounter, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct do not provide a single answer. Instead, a lawyer often has discretionary choices to make in responding and acting in a given situation while still complying with the requirements of the Rules. In this course on Advanced Legal Ethics, students will be continually challenged to think critically and carefully about legal ethics and moral responsibility. We will study and actively discuss foundational concepts of moral philosophy and jurisprudence, and apply those concepts by analyzing questions and problems involving lawyers and ethical challenges they face as persons in the legal profession. We will relate the ethical and moral concerns raised by the assigned readings, questions, and problems to the Rules studied in Professional Responsibility. We will also devote our attention to several works of world literature and film with important lessons to teach us about legal ethics and moral responsibility in the lives of practicing lawyers. Students will be graded based on (1) a scholarly paper on a topic relating to legal ethics, which will also satisfy the required 2L Intensive Writing Experience; and (2) class participation and professionalism.\n\nAdvanced Legal Research\n\n#280 - 2 credits\n\nAdvanced Legal Research will teach students to be efficient, thorough, and cost-effective legal researchers. Students will learn how to find and use the core sources of legal information, both primary and secondary, including: statutes, cases, administrative regulations and decisions, other executive branch materials, legislative history, constitutions, court rules, and secondary sources. Students will also learn how to research non-legal and interdisciplinary materials relevant to the law. Coverage will focus primarily on federal legal research and state legal research (with a special emphasis on North Dakota and Minnesota). Time permitting, sessions on municipal legal research and tribal legal research may also be provided. Both paid and free legal research resources will be examined.\n\nAdvanced Torts\n\n#323\n\nThe course will in greater detail examine tortious theories against property and persons with specificity toward products liability, misrepresentation and choice of law conflicts with respect to jurisdictional considerations. Further, the course will take a closer look at how tort law intertwines with other core areas of the law such as property, contract and constitutional law and that these areas work in concert and sometimes in conflict with each other in the broader legal environment.\n\nAdvanced Trial Advocacy\n\n#397 - 3 credits\n\nAdvanced Trial Advocacy offers students who have exhibited advanced skills and acumen at trial advocacy an opportunity to improve, practice, and hone those skills in an experiential learning environment that simulates the intensity of a real trial. The course provides a unique opportunity to students who are drawn to trial advocacy work to practice their advocacy skills and receive individualized feedback in a concentrated time span. The intense instruction culminates in a regional trial competition that requires students to make strategic decisions, think on their feet, present themselves well under pressure, understand the law (both procedurally and substantively) in a full-trial experience, and receive input and feedback from the course professor, invited on-site guest judges, and lawyers and judges from several states in the competition region.\n\nAgricultural Law\n\n#201 - 2 credits\n\nThis class will focus on common legal issues agriculture producers and agribusinesses encounter. The course will include such topics as real estate law, agricultural leases, commodity contracting and marketing, common agricultural dispute resolution systems and issues in North America, secured transactions as it relates to agriculture, real property, cooperatives, and succession planning issues and the impacts on the family farm. This class should be taken by anyone who has an interest in agricultural law issues. A farm background is not necessary to succeed in the class or in an agribusiness law practice.\n\nAir Pollution Law and Regulation\n\n# [TBD] - [TBD] credits\n\nAir pollution prevention and regulation is an integral part of Environmental Law and essential to the health, safety, and well-being of society. Energy and industrial activities are critical aspects of the modern economy. Although, externalities from the energy, transportation, and industrial sectors contribute significantly to air pollution and environmental issues. Focusing primarily on these sectors, the course will survey the legal, policy, and regulatory approaches to prevention and cleaning up air pollution in the US context. First, the class will consider the basic tenets of environmental law and regulation as a means for controlling air pollution. Second, it examines the key legal and regulatory programs relating to air pollution, especially as provided under the Clean Air Act (CAA). Third, the class will explore the major sources of air pollution, the innovative control technologies available, as well as the role of designated institutions such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in setting relevant standards and rules, facilitating policy objectives, and assessing the impact of adopted measures for air pollution control and regulation.\n\nAirline Labor Relations Law\n\nLaw #348 / AVIT 517 - 3 credits\n\nThis course is an exploration of the impact and application of the Railway Labor Act and the National Labor Relations Act as they pertain to commercial airline operations in the United States. The role of international labor law, arbitration and alternate dispute resolution, global business trends, federal discrimination law, state labor laws, pension benefits, Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, drug and alcohol testing, application of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and technology developments, among other topics, are discussed. The primary focus of this course is on the federal labor statutes, although distinctive state rules and statutes are covered as well. Course requirements will include class participation, small group assignments, a labor negotiation and a final exam.\n\nAlternative Dispute Resolution\n\n#281 - 2 credits\n\nThis course provides an overview of the regional dispute resolution methods of mediation, negotiation, arbitration, custody investigation, early neutral evaluation, parenting time coordination, and collective bargaining. Students will learn how to use and effectively participate in dispute resolution processes as a neutral third party. This course includes practical, skill-building exercises and presentations in an experiential learning environment.\n\nBankruptcy\n\n#282 - 3 credits\n\nThis course is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of federal bankruptcy law. The course briefly examines some key elements of state debtor/creditor law at the outset of the semester, and then moves on to more deeply examine consumer and business bankruptcy.\n\nBar Exam Preparation (Reading, Writing, and Analysis Skills for the Bar Exam)\n\n#344 - 3 credits\n\nThis course involves preparation of students for the bar review and exam process with a focus on improving reading, writing, and analysis skills to approach and do well on practice bar exam questions, including essay, multiple-choice, and performance questions. The course will cover a few specific topics tested on the bar exam with additional emphasis on refining memorization skills and learning how to self-assess understanding of concepts. The course is NOT intended to be a comprehensive review of the black letter law covered in law school, or a substitute for a commercial bar preparation course and dedicated study in the time period immediately preceding the bar. It is open to 40 third year law students and will be graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis. The principal assessed assignments will be regular in and out of class exercises, practice examination questions, and a timed \"mini- bar exam\" to be administered during the final examination period. and the class will adhere to a strict attendance policy. The course fulfills the Level II Skills requirement.\n\nBusiness Associations\n\n#254 - 4 credits\n\nThis first course in the Business Associations sequence represents an introduction to business law. This course is designed for those with no exposure to business issues, as well as those with a business background who need to understand how the law regulates structured economic activity. This course covers issues related to the law of agency and unincorporated entities, including general and limited partnerships and limited liability companies (LLCs). The course will also provide an introduction to corporations, including fiduciary duties, the scope of limited liability protections (i.e., piercing the corporate veil, alter-ego liability), and an introduction to basic federal securities laws.\n\nBusiness Associations II\n\n#213 - 3 credits\n\nThe course will be a continuation of the curriculum of Business Associations I by examining the common duties under the law imposed upon officers, directors and shareholders; changes in control of the business entity; derivative litigation and dispute resolution; indemnification and insurance; proxy regulation; tender offers; and insider trading and securities fraud. Additional subjects will include Sherman Anti-Trust violations and civil RICO actions. The course will cover distinct subject matter that is different from Business Associations I.\n\nBusiness Associations I is not a pre-requisite to enrolling in this course. This is a 3 credit course and will be graded by a closed book and closed material comprehensive essay exam given at the end of the semester.\n\nCarrigan Cup\n\n#561\n\nThe Carrigan Cup Intramural Trial Competition is a one-credit, experiential course, designed to develop students’ competence and confidence in court. The goal of the course is to build foundational trial skills. These skills include how to analyze a case, develop and implement a case theory, prepare and examine both lay and expert witnesses, make and respond to objections, and deliver opening statements and closing arguments.\n\nConflict of Laws\n\n#257 - 3 credits\n\nThe practice of law in the 21st century will increasingly require lawyers to advise and assist clients in cross-border and multi-jurisdictional legal matters involving a “conflict of laws.” In this course, students will study the principles and standards courts have applied in resolving “conflict of laws” problems. Conflict issues typically arise when significant facts concerning a matter litigated in state court have connections with more than one state, when federal courts adjudicate state law claims, or when a party seeks recognition of a judgment in a jurisdiction other than where the judgment was entered. The course will focus on choice of law in state and federal courts; the scope and enforcement of state, federal and foreign judgments (including claim and issue preclusion); and constitutional limitations on courts in making decisions on these matters. Conflict of Laws is among the subjects identified for testing on the Uniform Bar Exam, and the course will cover selected Civil Procedure topics (such as choice-of-law doctrine in federal diversity actions and preclusion doctrine) that also are regularly tested on that exam. Grading is based on a comprehensive final examination and consideration of class participation.\n\nConstitutional Law II\n\n#238 - 3 credits\n\nThis required course introduces students to the constitutional system of the United States and the modes of thought and criticism appropriate to constitutional law. It provides a broad introduction to the Courts constitutional decisions to ascertain the political values and processes it has defended historically, the standards it has developed to implement its principles, and its relationship to other institutions in the American political system. The course focuses on the following themes of civil rights and civil liberties: the right of privacy, equal protection, free speech, fundamental rights, economic due process, and takings.\n\nCriminal Advocacy\n\n#293 - 2 credits\n\nThis course will provide students with hands-on opportunities to learn and develop practical skills related to different phases of a criminal trial (e.g., preliminary examination, bail hearings, motion hearings, etc.). While advocacy skills will be emphasized, this course is designed to supplement, not substitute for, subjects covered in other trial advocacy courses. Class exercises will include conducting discovery, drafting and litigating motions, conducting witness examinations, and engaging in settlement negotiations. Evidence and Criminal Procedure are pre- or co-requisites for this course. Enrollment is limited; preference will be given to students who have completed Evidence and Criminal Procedure, then to third-year students generally. This course will be graded on an S/U basis, and attendance at each class session is mandatory.\n\nCriminal Procedure I\n\n#218 - 3 credits\n\nThis course will cover the constitutional rights and actual practices associated with criminal investigations from the occurrence of the crime to trial (the exclusionary sanction, constitutional doctrines relating to law enforcement conduct, issuance and execution of arrest and search warrants, detentions of persons and related searches, \"warrantless\" searches, electronic surveillance, interrogation and confessions, undercover investigations, grand jury investigative functions, and eyewitness identification).\n\nCriminal Procedure II\n\n#286 - 3 credits\n\nThis course will cover: Prosecution and Adjudication (The Initial Appearance and Detention, Discretion to Prosecute, The Preliminary Examination and the Grand Jury, Right to a Speedy Trial, Competency to Stand Trial, Discovery and Disclosure, Right to an Impartial Trial, Joinder and Severance of Charges and Defendants, Double Jeopardy, Pretrial Hearings and Related matters, Adjudication of Guilt by Plea, Adjudication of Guilt or Innocence by Trial, Effective Assistance of Counsel, Sentencing, and Appeal and Collateral Attack), as time permits. Criminal Procedure I is not a prerequisite.\n\nCybersecurity\n\n#416 – 3 credits\n\nAttorneys must have a solid understanding of cybersecurity to protect themselves and their clients against cyberthreats. In fact, the standards for attorney ethics and professional responsibility require attorneys to be knowledgeable about cybersecurity, and attorneys are required to implement sound cybersecurity into their practices. This course will cover the fundamentals of cybersecurity, which include the following: cybersecurity ecosystems and categories of cyberthreats; data security regulations and enforcement actions; industry-specific cybersecurity mandates; cybersecurity and corporate governance; federal cyber structure and public-private cybersecurity partnerships; cybersurveillance; international and comparative cybersecurity laws; cyberwarfare; cybersecurity planning and cyberattack response; cybersecurity litigation; and attorney best practices for cybersecurity. Students will complete the course having gained a solid understanding of the cybersecurity landscape, and students will be well-prepared to protect themselves and their clients from ever-increasing cyberthreats.\n\nDrones and the Law\n\n(Law #350 / AVIT 526)\n\nThis course introduces students to the laws and policies governing UAS operations including flight regulations, remote sensing issues, and data and cybersecurity issues related to UAS. The class scope of inquiry includes US and international law and examines both civil and military use.\n\nDrug Use: Criminal Law, Policy, & History\n\n#291\n\nThis course will introduce students to the major legal and policy issues regarding illegal drug use. In doing so, it will first provide a historical background on drug use within the United States and then spend the majority of its sessions considering the laws and policies that govern illegal drugs. Alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine regulation will also be considered. While focused on drug use in the United States, the course will also address drug law and policy internationally.\n\nEmployment Discrimination\n\n#203 - 3 credits\n\nFederal and state laws protect workers from discrimination based on certain characteristics, and require employers to base employment decisions on factors other than, for example, a person’s sex or race. Employment discrimination is an area of law that is applicable in every jurisdiction, to every person who has an employer, owns or operates a business, or is looking for a job. This course will cover the major federal statutes, and time permitting, state statutes and common law theories, upon which litigants suing for adverse employment actions can rely.\n\nEnergy and Mining Law\n\n#362 - 3 credits\n\nThe mining of natural resources for energy production and the supply systems developed as a result are integral to modern living standards. This course surveys the energy law and policy framework in the US, North Dakota, and relevant international contexts. It looks at how energy from primary sources, such as coal, oil, gas, nuclear water, wind, and the sun, are extracted, transported, and converted into secondary and useful energy. The course explores the physical, market, and legal structures governing each energy resource, including models of regulation and policy governing their utilization. The laws and policies designed to promote energy efficiency, renewable and alternative forms of energy such as geothermal and hydrogen are also studied. Course grades will be based on course participation and a final take-home examination.\n\nEnvironmental Law\n\n#263 - 3 credits\n\nThis course surveys the major federal statutory programs restricting private and governmental activities that may adversely affect human health and the environment. The course examines the common law origins of environmental law, “regulatory” schemes designed to prevent activities from causing excessive environmental harm, and “remedial” schemes designed to clean up or remedy environmental harms. Major topics include the structure of Federal, State, and Indian tribal governmental power over the environment, air, and water quality, and hazardous waste disposal and cleanup. Course grades are calculated based on class participation and a reflective paper on a topic assigned on the first day of class. The paper is not eligible for the school’s graduation writing requirement.\n\nEstate Planning\n\n#287 - 2 credits\n\nThis simulation course examines various problems encountered in the planning and administration of an individual's estate. Included are such issues as the drafting of wills and trusts, the use of the marital deduction, lifetime gifts, testamentary trusts, the selection of trustees, valuation problems, apportioning the tax burden, the charitable deduction, deferred compensation plans, and life insurance. The course grade will be determined by take-home writing assignments designed to simulate actual work assignments.\n\nEvidence\n\n#222 - 4 credits\n\nIn this required course, students will study the rules that govern the admissibility of evidence in American trials. The course will examine the concepts of relevance, hearsay, and character evidence; issues relating to opinion evidence and the reliability of expert testimony; rules governing the admissibility of physical and digital evidence and devices designed to ensure an orderly and efficient trial; the federal common law of privileges; and constitutional provisions impacting the admission of evidence at trial. Because of their prominence and their pervasive influence on the development of rules for state courts, as well as their importance for bar preparation purposes, the course will focus primary attention on the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nExternship Class (Learning from Practice)\n\n#557\n\nThe Externship Program requires both in-class sessions (Law 557: Learning From Practice) and an out-of-class placement experience (Law 555, 563, 564, 565 & 550). The Learning From Practice sessions are the required in-class sessions that accompany the out-of-class field placement/externships of Externship I, II, III & IV and the Legal Practicum. These class sessions, along with your field placement/externship experience, are intended to bridge your professional competence from law student to practicing lawyer, and your professional skills from classroom to workplace. In particular, the class sessions are designed to help you to build professional skills and habits, including reflective learning and intentional professional development, that will serve you throughout your legal career.\n\nAt the end of your field placement/externship experience, you will have gained the experience of working as a practicing lawyer in a real-world setting. Through the Learning From Practice class sessions, you will have leveraged your field placement/externship experience to (1) develop your professional identity, (2) gain perspective on the role of ethical and effective attorneys in our legal systems, (3) practice and hone professional skills, including communication, public speaking, interpersonal interactions, problem solving, time management, and attention to detail, (4) address issues related to ethics, cultural competence, and professionalism in the context of a legal practice, and (5) successfully progress from an academic environment to a professional workplace.\n\nExternship I - IV\n\nvariable credit\n\nThis program offers credit for students selected as externs within the various placement sites (including both state and federal agencies). Students selected for this program are required to work the requisite number of hours within the placement site in order to receive credit.\n\nFamily Law\n\n#265 - 3 credits\n\nThis course examines the creation, legal significance, and dissolution of family relationships. Major topics covered may include: the substantive and procedural requirements to marry; the rights and responsibilities of married couples; the divorce process; the allocation of child custody; the financial consequences of dissolution (including property distribution, spousal support, and child support); non-marital families; and the formation and dissolution of the parent-child relationship (including adoption, surrogacy, and the termination of parental rights). This course combines both a substantive and a practical focus; teaching methods include a mixture of readings, lectures, videos, quizzes, in-class exercises, group work, and guest speakers.\n\nFamily Law Clinical Practicum (I-IV)\n\n#461 / #462 / #463 / #464\n\nFamily Law Clinical Practicum I & II is a two-semester course sequence (Fall 1 credit/Spring 4 credits). The FLCP focuses on the development of practical and transactional skills to see family law and/or guardianship cases through from potential client interview to final judgment. The student attorney performs all tasks while under the supervision of a North Dakota licensed attorney. The student attorney will engage in client interviews, witness preparation, preparation and attendance in mediation, court appearances, document management, and preparation of pleadings. Continuation in FLCP III (4 credits) and FLCP IV (4 credits) is permitted with instructor approval.\n\nFederal Courts\n\n#267 - 3 credits\n\nThis course examines the nature and scope of federal courts’ authority in the American system of government, including their role as fora for vindicating federal rights, and the relationship of federal courts with state and local governments and state courts. In particular, we will explore the constitutional foundations of federal judicial power and principles of justiciability; basic and advanced concepts relating to federal subject matter jurisdiction; the law applied in cases in federal courts in both diversity cases (the Erie doctrine) and non-diversity cases (e.g., federal common law and implied private rights of action for federal statutory violations); and doctrines of federalism integral to defining and limiting the roles of federal courts, such as state sovereign immunity, abstention, and related doctrines limiting federal jurisdiction and authority. Grading is based on a comprehensive final examination and consideration of class participation.\n\nFederal Indian Law\n\n#204 - 3 credits\n\nThis course builds on Constitutional Law I (constitutional structures, separation of powers, and federalism) to explore the special status of Indian Tribes and Indians under United States law. Topics include: the historical development of Indian law and policy, from their origins in international law, to their domestication, to new conceptions of international human rights; determining who is an “Indian” and what is an “Indian Tribe,” and whether such distinctions are constitutional; the scope of Federal power and Federal responsibility in Indian affairs; and the collective rights of Tribes to land, water, and other property interests.\n\nFirst Amendment\n\n#302 - 3 credits\n\nThis course is intended as a survey of the substantive law of the First Amendment - the Establishment and Free Exercise of Religion Clauses, and the Freedom of Speech, Press, Assembly, and Petition Clauses. We will also explore the philosophical underpinnings of First Amendment jurisprudence from its inception to the modern day. Our ultimate goal is to enhance students' ability to create and critically analyze constitutional arguments, both orally and in writing. The grade for the course will be principally based on a paper and on demonstrated oral skills in the form of class participation, exercises, debates, and presentations. This course satisfies the Upper-level Legal Writing Requirement. There will be no examination.\n\nGender and the Law\n\n#242 - 3 credits (Prof. Ernst)\n\nGender and the Law provides an opportunity for students to explore a wide variety of legal issues concerning gender, which intersects with nearly every other legal issue—such as those related to the judicial system (e.g., judges, juries, witnesses, law enforcement, lawyers, law firms), employment, taxation, health, the environment, education, athletics, the military, immigration, indigenous rights, sexual harassment, sexual orientation, gender identity, international law, and so on. This course also enables students to review numerous bar-tested subject areas, such as constitutional law (e.g., the First Amendment regarding freedom of expression and freedom of religion, the Fourteenth Amendment regarding equal protection), criminal law (e.g., domestic violence, sexual assault), family law (e.g., marriage, divorce, reproduction, parenthood), and torts (e.g., invasion of privacy). Meeting online, once-per-week, in the evening enables lawyers, judges, and other experts to give presentations and interact with students in this course. To make this seminar both practical and economical, we will utilize free online resources instead of a casebook. To enable students to explore an issue of personal interest in greater depth, each student will select a topic on which you will write a legal research paper analyzing a problem concerning gender and the law and proposing legal solutions. Therefore, please think about what aspects of gender and the law you are interested in studying that combine with your other interests for your legal career. Grades are based on the research paper along with class participation and professionalism. This course may be used to fulfill the second-year writing requirement.\n\nHealth Law\n\n#303 - 3 credits\n\nThis course will provide a comprehensive review of state and federal laws associated with cost, quality and access in the delivery of health care throughout the United States. The focus will be on how regulations and laws are utilized to ensure compliance for health care providers and health care institutions, including the professional-patient relationship; legal liability for health care professionals and institutions; discrimination and unequal treatment in health care; public health care financing programs; tax-exempt health care organizations; and specific population health and public health law regulation. Federal laws such as the False Claims Act; Anti-Kickback Statutes; Stark Laws; and laws addressing fraud and abuse in health care will also be covered. In addition, the course will cover sensitive subjects such as medically assisted suicide, organ transplantation and the determination of death.\n\nStudents will master an understanding of these concepts and how the law is utilized in the delivery of health care. Students will be evaluated for grading purposes on a series of written materials assigned by the instructor and will be expected to select an appropriate topic approved by the instructor for research and writing in lieu of an exam.\n\nHousing Discrimination Law\n\n#346 - 3 credits\n\nFederal and state laws forbid discrimination in all housing-related transactions (including sales, rentals, financing, insurance, and zoning). Housing discrimination law applies in every jurisdiction, to every person who seeks a home, and to businesses that affect residential properties. A foundational knowledge of these issues is especially recommended for lawyers working in government, real estate, and civil rights contexts. Neighborhoods powerfully shape residents’ access to social, political, and economic opportunities and resources. This course explores the nature, extent, consequences, and causes of housing discrimination and segregation. We also will examine the nature and adequacy of the legal framework enacted for the purpose of ending discrimination and segregation in housing. Evaluation will be based on written reflections on the readings, class participation, and completion of a written book review. There will be no final exam.\n\nImmigration Law\n\n#219 – 3 credits\n\nThis course explores the law of the admission of foreign nationals into the United States, their treatment and status while here, and the processes of deportation and naturalization. Constitutional, statutory, and regulatory sources of law will be considered, in both their substantive and procedural aspects. Additionally, we will situate the law and its socio-historical and cultural context. Grading will be based on a final paper.\n\nIncome Taxation\n\n#226 - 3 credits\n\nThis course is intended to give students an understanding of the fundamental concepts underlying the U.S. individual income tax. Examination of the concept of gross income and net income, including investigation of what constitutes income, when it should be taxed, to whom it should be taxed, and its character as unearned, earned, or capital gain income. Deductions and their nature as genuine or as artificial deductions are considered in detail. The course will focus on the statutory framework of tax law, Treasury Regulations and Rulings and illustrative judicial authorities.\n\nIndian Law and Tribal Law Seminar\n\n#324 - 3 credits\n\nThere are three components to this course.\n\n(1) Research: The practice of Indian and Tribal Law often requires familiarity with treaties, tribal codes, tribal court decisions, and other authorities you might not have learned about in Lawyering Skills. The first part of the course will focus on finding and becoming familiar with these legal authorities. Students will demonstrate their research skills by compiling a “legal history” of a federally recognized tribe.\n\n(2) Writing: Building on the research skills developed in the first part of the course, students will select a topic (with faculty guidance) in Indian Law or Tribal Law and write an article suitable for publication in a bar journal on that topic. Readings will demonstrate the forms that bar journal articles take, and serve as examples for student pieces, while also exposing students to a wide variety of Indian law topics. Students will turn in and refine multiple drafts of their article, so that by the end of the semester each student should have a piece suitable for publication in The Gavel (the journal of the State Bar Association of North Dakota) or another similar publication.\n\n(3) Presentation: Attorneys often are called on to present for continuing education or in other professional settings. For the final unit of this course, students will turn their article into a presentation, which they will present to the class, allowing each student to learn from each other’s research.\n\nFulfills 2L intensive writing requirement.\n\nPrerequisite: Federal Indian Law, or concurrent enrollment in either Tribal Law or Jurisdiction in Indian Country, or consent of instructor.\n\nIndian Child Welfare Act\n\n#294 - 2 credits\n\nThis course will combine an academic and historical analysis of the Indian Child Welfare Act with an examination of how native children are treated in the legal system in the child welfare area, as well as other areas (health care, education, and child support enforcement). The final grade will be based upon the students writing a brief for an Indian tribe, Indian parent, adoptive parent, or other party to an ICWA proceeding in an actual case that has been litigated or completing a comprehensive paper. Students will have the opportunity during the class to hear from tribal leaders, native persons who have been adopted out, and others about the historical displacement of Indian children from their Tribes and the impact of this legacy.\n\nIndian Country Environmental Law\n\n#340 - 3 credits\n\nThis course examines how the confluence of federal environmental, administrative and Indian Law creates, but may also solve, environmental injustice in Indian countries. For Indigenous Peoples who seek to maintain connections with their ancient spiritual and religious cultural traditions, effective protection of the natural environment is critical to their cultural identity. The course examines the various Indian country approaches taken by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including treating Indian tribes “as states,” and the federal cases brought by states and non-Indians challenging EPA’s and tribes’” authority to make binding value judgments about Indian country environmental protection. This seminar fulfills the intensive writing requirement.\n\nIndian Gaming Law\n\n#276 - 3 credits\n\nWhat is Indian gaming, and how did it turn into a multi-billion dollar industry and the most prominent public policy issue concerning Native Americans today? Framed by tribal sovereignty and the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA), this course examines the substantive law governing Indian gaming, as well as the broader political context of reservation economic development through gaming. In just over two decades, Indian gaming has become a $26.5 billion industry with some 440 casinos operated by 230 tribes in 28 states. The course will explore the history of tribal gaming, substantive provisions of IGRA as well as other pertinent federal, tribal, and state law, and the continuing development of case law, statutory and administrative law, and, of course, politics. Topics include regulatory authority, casino-style gaming and tribal-state compacts, socioeconomic effects, revenue sharing, and \"off-reservation\" gaming.\n\nInnocence Project\n\n#570 – 2-3 credits\n\nWorking with Prof. Morrison and lawyers from the Innocence Project in Minneapolis, students will investigate current prisoners’ claims of innocence. They will gather documents from prior attorneys, courts, and other entities, review those documents, identify further steps for investigation, and take those steps. They will also study and apply the relevant law on post-conviction review for claims of actual innocence and related law. This course provides the opportunity to work on actual individuals’ criminal cases and learn how the criminal justice system operates in the real world. Enrollment is by application only.\n\nInsurance Law\n\n#269 - 3 credits\n\nThe course provides a comprehensive introduction to those laws on the business of insurance. The focus will be on basic insurance contract foundations such as first-party and third-party coverage, liability insurance and insurance regulation. Further, the course will examine the duties of insurers and the insured with respect to the insurance contract. It will extend to several lines of insurance such as property, bodily injury, general liability, health, life, ERISA, professional lines, subrogation and environmental coverage. Students will have an introduction to concepts relating to reinsurance and fronting arrangements between and among insurance companies.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\n#295\n\nMore than ever, intellectual property (IP) plays a critical role in our society. It governs our rights, liabilities, and freedoms with regard to innovation, market control, and artistic expression. For many companies, it represents the key assets, majority of net worth, and bedrock for competitive advantage.

We adapt this course each year to meet the specific interests of the students, who help select the human rights issues and countries we will explore (including the United States and Canada). No textbooks are required for this course—instead, we use free on-line and library materials. This seminar enables students to enhance transferrable skills sought by all legal employers, such as research, writing, and editing. Grades are based on a research paper on a topic relating to international human rights law, along with class participation and professionalism. This seminar will satisfy the required 2L Intensive Writing Experience. No prior knowledge of international law is necessary—everyone is welcome.\n\nInternational Petroleum Transactions\n\n#321 - 2 credits\n\nThis course examines the legal issues and structure of international transactions relating to the exploration, production, and marketing of petroleum (oil and gas). Petroleum is a source of energy and feedstock for products used in essential economic and industrial processes worldwide, including manufacturing, agriculture, and domestic applications. Consequently, crude oil, in particular, has been a globally traded commodity for decades, while regional or local natural gas markets have become increasingly interconnected and international. In this class, students will learn how crude oil and gas are exploited and marketed worldwide. The course covers how countries establish sovereignty over petroleum resources and how host governments or national (state-owned) oil companies contract with private companies to explore and develop oil and gas resources. Students will review key provisions of model contracts between international oil and gas companies and agreements between such companies and service contractors that facilitate petroleum exploration, development, and marketing. Additionally, students will learn about the dynamics of public and private international law with oil and gas transactions as the context. The class will examine topics such as the extraterritoriality of US anti-bribery laws, managing political risks and the role of bilateral investment treaties, protecting indigenous and human rights, and regulating community impacts.\n\nJurisdiction in Indian Country\n\n#256 - 3 credits\n\nThis course examines the overlap of Tribal, State, and Federal jurisdiction on Indian lands, with attention to criminal law and law enforcement powers; the powers of (and limitations on) Tribal, State, and Federal courts; the power of Tribes to regulate the activities of non-Indians in Indian country, and the power of States to regulate the activities of Indians outside of Indian country; and jurisdiction-regulating statutes in fields such as Indian child welfare, Indian gaming, and environmental law.\n\nFederal Indian Law or Tribal Law recommended, but not required.\n\nLaw & Technology\n\nCourse #TBD - 3 credits\n\nLaw & Technology is a survey course that will expose students to an array of contemporary areas where law and technology intertwine, including: cybersecurity, computer crimes, privacy and information law, electronic discovery and digital evidence, artificial intelligence and machine learning, technology and attorney ethics, the regulation of cyberspace, and the effect of legal rules on technological innovation.\n\nLaw Practice Management\n\n#243 – 3 credits\n\nIn Law Practice Management, students will address the following: perceptions of the legal profession, legal profession trends, law office operations, legal products and services, case planning, fee contracts and arrangements, common ethical concerns and methods of avoidance, civility in the profession, marketing and promotion of legal services, firm performance evaluations, law firm financial analysis, strategic planning, modern law office technology, pro bono obligations, and law office human resource management.\n\nLaw Practice Technology\n\n#317 - 2 credits\n\nTechnology is drastically changing the face of legal practice.

The North Dakota Law Review is the journal of the State Bar Association of North Dakota.\n\nLegal Research and Writing for Practice\n\n3 credits; course number TBD\n\nLegal Research and Writing for Practice develops legal-writing skills through frequent research and writing assignments involving documents commonly drafted in law practice. The course runs like a fictional law firm wherein the curriculum consists of client files. The first assignment for each file is to research and write about the client’s issue. Each successive assignment tracks the document path that the client’s issue would take through the legal system. Students will draft documents such as client engagement letters, advice letters, demand letters, complaints, answers, motions to dismiss, responses to motions, affidavits, motions for summary judgment, settlement letters, motions to suppress, fee applications, blog posts, and contracts.\n\nThe key to student learning in this course is frequent practice and personalized feedback. There will be a weekly writing assignment. Students will have individual conferences with the professor each week at the same day and time, during which the professor coaches students on their particular strengths and weaknesses, giving them a solid research and writing foundation with which to confidently begin practice right after law school.\n\nThis class is an online, but synchronous course. A few weeks we will meet synchronously on Zoom as a class at the time in the course schedule. But most weeks students will meet individually via Zoom with the professor to receive feedback, talk through client issues, and receive the next assignment. Individual meetings will be scheduled during class time as much as possible, however, depending on the number of students enrolled, some students may have to meet during a mutually agreeable time outside of that instead; in any event, students’ assigned meeting time will be the same day and time every week.\n\nLegislation\n\n#309 - 3 credits (Prof. Ernst)\n\nLegislation affects every area of law. Lawyers must understand how judges interpret statutes in order to make the strongest arguments in court on behalf of their clients. Lawyers must also interpret statutes to advise their clients on how best to attain their clients’ goals while complying with the law. Clients also frequently call upon lawyers to advocate on their behalf before legislative bodies to influence statutory reforms or to enact new legislation. This course provides law students with the practical and legal skills necessary in each of these situations at both the state and federal levels. These skills are also highly valuable when working with city governments and municipal ordinances, as well as tribal governments and laws. It is designed to be a fun and interactive seminar that fulfills the required 2L Intensive Writing Experience. This course also fulfills the prerequisite for the Legislative Externship Program with the North Dakota Legislative Assembly.\n\nModern Real Estate Transactions\n\n#285 - 3 credits\n\nStudy of the contracting process in real estate transactions; deeds and deed covenants; recording issues; title insurance and abstracts of title; and mortgage loans, foreclosure, and other real estate financing issues.\n\nMoot Court\n\n#553 - 1-2 credits\n\nThe Moot Court Association provides interested students the opportunity to participate in an appellate moot court intra-school competition.

In particular, the course compares various approaches to federal resource management, including the cross-boundary regulation of endangered species and wetlands, the multiple-use mandates of Bureau of Land Management lands, and the notion that nature can be preserved by setting it aside in wilderness areas and national parks. The course also addresses state responsibilities for natural resources management (focusing on the public trust doctrine) and issues raised by the regulation of natural resources on private lands (focusing on the constitutional takings doctrine). A persistent theme is the question of development versus preservation. Grading is based on class participation and a research paper on a topic selected by the student.\n\nOil & Gas Contracts and Regulation\n\n# [TBD] - 3 credits\n\nThis course surveys contractual provisions and frameworks for upstream oil and gas production operations and midstream (processing, storage, and supply) activities in the US.

The class examines how the constitution treats the poor, what federal entitlement programs exist to address poverty, and the factors contributing to poverty that are amenable to legal challenges such as education, healthcare, and consumer laws. The student will either write a comprehensive final exam or complete a paper on a topic approved of by the instructor.\n\nPretrial Practice (civil)\n\n#410 - 3 credits\n\nThe majority of civil litigation is not resolved at the trial level, but instead at the pre-trial level. Competent pre-trial preparation is the key to a successful civil litigation practice. The course will familiarize the student with pre-trial practices and procedures through a combination of lectures, guest lectures, reading assignments and pre-trial activities in a mock civil case. Students will become familiar with the relevant Rules of Civil Procedure and other pre-trial techniques, including client interviewing and counseling, witness interviewing, informal discovery techniques, litigation planning, expert development and discovery, pleadings, interrogatories, depositions, requests for production of documents and things, requests for admission, pre-trial motion practice, settlement strategies, settlement brochures, settlement conferences, pre-trial conferences, and settlement agreements.
