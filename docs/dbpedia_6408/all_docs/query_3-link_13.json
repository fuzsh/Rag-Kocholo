I make short films in my free time with my friends, I go to the movies twice a week. I analyze the box office, and the careers of directors and producers. Its the only thing I have ever loved.\n\nCut to my freshman year of community college, and I took a tort law class. Im not gonna lie, I love it. Nowhere near as much as I love movies...But I do like Law. Im good at law. I have gotten straight As in all law classes, and spoke with my Contract Law teacher who thought I should end up in law school, and it got me thinking. Im now torn becuase a career in law is stable. Its interesting. Im really good at it. But a career in filmmaking is all I've ever wanted. Its my passion. Its my dream. How do I pick between my passion and what I'm good at? I also don't know If I will be able to afford law school, due to the fact that Im having trouble affording undergrad. Im really torn. I come from a very poor family, and dont want to end up poor and miserable later in life. I want to make the right decision. In a perfect world, I would be able to do both...\n\n#college #lawyer #film #Movie #Law #Director #Producer #Cinema #law-school"
