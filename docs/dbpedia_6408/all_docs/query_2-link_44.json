        "text": "This page contains summaries of significant recent court opinions involving tort liability cases of importance to agricultural producers and rural landowners.\n\nPosted April 18, 2023\n\nFarmer Sues Crop Salesman for Ruining Relationship with Landowner the Farmer Rented From. The plaintiff, a farm tenant, sued the defendant landlord and a third-party ag salesman. The plaintiff claimed that the salesman wrongly advised the landlord and encouraged the landlord to complain about the plaintiff’s farming practices. Specifically, the plaintiff’s claims against the salesman were for interference with contract, interference with business relationship, and fraud. The salesman moved to dismiss each claim, but the trial court denied the motion with respect to the contract interference and interference with business relationship claims. The trial court, however, dismissed the fraud claim involving the efficacy of corn seed. Walt Goodman Farms, Inc. v. Hogan Farms, LLC, No. 1:22-cv-01004-JDB-jay, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134192 (W.D. Tenn. July 28, 2022).\n\nPosted April 18, 2023\n\nFarming Operation Entitled to Costs and Fees of Dismissed Nuisance Claims. The plaintiff township filed a civil infraction citation against the defendant for the building of a “junkyard” on his property without a permit and for an insufficient fence. The defendant claimed he was immune from nuisance claims under the Michigan Right-to-Farm law (RTF). The trial court determined that the defendant was using his property as a farm and was therefore immune from nuisance claims and dismissed the case The district court denied both parties award of costs and expenses, and the defendant appealed on that issue, claiming that he should recover reasonably incurred costs and expenses. The appellate court agreed and remanded the case for a determination of the appropriate amount of costs and fees to be awarded. James Township. v. Rice, No. 163053, 2022 Mich. LEXIS 1179 (Mich. Sup. Ct. Jun. 22, 2022).\n\nPosted April 18, 2023\n\nCAFO Not in Violation of State Law. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant’s neighboring confined animal feeding operation (CAFO) violated federal law due to manure runoff that caused excessive nitrate levels in the plaintiff’s water sources. The federal court dismissed the suit on summary judgment for lack of expert testimony to establish the plaintiff’s claim. The federal court also declined supplemental jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s state law claims. The plaintiff then sued the defendant in state court for nuisance, trespass and violation of state drainage law. The defendant moved for summary judgment based on statutory immunity of Iowa Code § 657.11 and the plaintiff’s lack of evidence or expert testimony. Iowa Code §657.11 provides nuisance immunity to a CAFO if the CAFO is following all applicable regulations and is using accepted management practices. The plaintiff, relying on Gacke v. Pork XTRA, L.L.C., 684 N.W. 2d 168 (Iowa 2004) claimed that Iowa Code §657.11 as applied to him was unconstitutional under Iowa’s inalienable rights clause. The trial court, noting that the plaintiff’s own CAFO had benefited from immunity, rejected the plaintiff’s constitutional challenge for failure to satisfy the three-part test in Gacke. The trial court then granted the defendant’s summary judgment motion based on the plaintiff’s failure to provide any expert testimony (the plaintiff’s ag engineering degree from Iowa State University was insufficient to qualify himself personally as an expert) or other evidence to support any exception to the statutory immunity defense or to prove causation or damages. On further review, the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed and applied rational basis review to reject the plaintiff’s constitutional challenge to Iowa Code §657.11. The Iowa Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiff failed to preserve error on his takings claim under article I, section 18 of the Iowa Constitution and failed to generate a question of fact precluding summary judgment on statutory nuisance immunity or causation for his trespass and drainage claims. The Court did not address the plaintiff’s constitutional challenge to the damages limitations in Iowa Code §657.11A(3). Garrison v. New Fashion Pork LLP, No. 21-0652, 2022 Iowa Sup. LEXIS 86 (Iowa Sup. Ct. Jun. 30, 2022).\n\nPosted April 18, 2023\n\nFact Issues Remain in Auto/Livestock Accident. The plaintiffs, a married couple from Indiana, were westbound on I-70 when the Ford F-150 pickup they were driving hit the defendant’s deceased bull in the roadway. The pickup rolled numerous times injuring the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs sued the defendant in federal court for negligence in allowing the bull to escape its enclosure. The defendant claimed there were three other responsible parties: the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT), the pickup driver (who was speeding at the time of the accident) and an unknown trespasser who allegedly released the bull. The defendant moved for summary judgment on the plaintiff’s negligence claim. The defendant claimed he checked the pens that contained the bull multiple times daily and always ensured the gates were properly closed. The defendant claimed his fence was a legal fence under state law but admitted there was a portion of the fence that was inadequate for holding a bull. However, the defendant asserted that he locked the bull into a section where the bull would not be able to exit from the unsecured section. The plaintiffs’ livestock fencing expert testified that the defendant failed to exercise due care in enclosing the bull by not fixing the broken panel and not posting “No Trespassing” signs. Ultimately, the court determined that facts remained in dispute on the negligence issue. On the defendant’s comparative fault claim, the court found that KDOT had no duty to build and maintain a fence to keep livestock off of the Interstate and did not fail to remove the bull in a reasonable time after notification. But the court determined that fact issues remained concerning the speed of the plaintiffs’ pickup at the time of the accident, and that a reasonable jury could find that a trespasser did entered the premises and allowed the bull to escape without fault to the defendants. The motion for summary judgment was granted in part as to KDOT but denied otherwise. Lee v. Kaup Kattle Co., No. 19-2600-JAR-ADM, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93306 (D. Kan. May 24, 2022).\n\nPosted April 18, 2023\n\nAppellant’s Claims Against Dog Food Producer Held to be Wrongfully Dismissed. A veterinarian prescribed Hill’s Pet Nutrition dog food for the appellant’s dog. The plaintiff sued Hill’s Pet Nutrition upon discovering that the dog food did not contain medicine or drugs, had not been tested and approved for medicinal purposes by the FDA, but was priced higher than “normal” dog food. The plaintiff claimed the defendant and other pet food manufacturers had conspired to monopolize the prescription pet food market and they had artificially inflated the prices by claiming the food required a prescription. No federal or state law required pet food to be sold with a prescription from a vet. The plaintiff claimed the defendant had violated the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act (KRTA) and the Kansas Consumers Protection Act (KCPA) and brought an unjust enrichment claim. The trial court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim under KCPA, the plaintiff had to allege that the defendant was engaged in a deceptive act or practice involving the plaintiff that caused the plaintiff damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had misrepresented that the dog food required a prescription so as to sell at a premium price. The appellate court determined that the plaintiff had clearly alleged sufficient facts to put the defendant on notice of the allegations under the KCPA. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff failed to show a causal connection between the prescription practices and the injury, but the appellate court noted that the plaintiff did not need to show she was misled, only that the defendant’s actions were deceptive. On that point, the appellate court noted that the plaintiff had provided enough detail in the complaint to show that the prescription requirement could be deceptive and was the cause of her spending more money (the injury). As such, the plaintiff’s KCPA claims should not have been dismissed. With respect to the KRTA claim, the court noted that the plaintiff was required to allege that the defendant was creating a restriction in trade, increasing, or reducing the price of merchandise to prevent competition, and had entered into an agreement establishing a set price for a good in the market. The plaintiff alleged the defendant had entered a contract with other dog food producers to set prices higher for prescription dog food, which violated KRTA. The plaintiff also claimed that the defendant had entered a conspiracy to monopolize the prescription dog food market. As such, the appellate court held that the plaintiff had properly presented the KRTA claims. The appellate court reversed the trial court’s dismissal and remanded the case for furthering proceedings. Kucharski-Berger v. Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc., 60 Kan. App. 2d 510, 494 P.3d 283 (Kan, Ct. App. 2021).\n\nPosted April 18, 2023\n\nSmall Claims Court Case Gets New Trial. The defendant sold a vehicle to the plaintiff for $2,292.75, that was advertised as being in good condition and reliable. The plaintiff drove the vehicle only 20 miles before the vehicle overheated and had to be towed 90 miles to the plaintiff’s home. A mechanic inspected the car, and repairs were estimated to be between $2,000 and $3,000. The plaintiff sued in Small Claims Court for false advertising and was awarded the damages in the amount paid for the car plus interest. The defendant sought a new trial in the local trial court, which affirmed based on the record without conducting a new trial. On further review, the appellate court concluded that the trial court should have conducted a new trial based on Kan. Stat. Ann. §61-2709(a) and remanded the case. Brown v. Zimmerman, 61 Kan. App. 2d 537, 506 P.3d 300 (2022).\n\nPosted January 23, 2022\n\nHoney Farm Makes Various Claims Arising From Dicamba Drift. The plaintiff is a honey farm that sued the defendant based on 12 claims associated with damages to the honey crop allegedly arising from the defendant’s sale of Dicamba and use by nearby farmers from whose crops Dicamba drifted. The defendant moved to dismiss the claims. The court allowed the plaintiffs Lanham Act claim to proceed based on the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant knew that it was making false statements that caused farmers to purchase and use dicamba herbicides when the defendant knew or should have knows that Dicamba would move off-target and damage non-tolerant plants. The court determined that the plaintiff had standing to bring a Lanham Act claim and adequately alleged a Lanham Act claim for the purpose of a motion to dismiss. The court dismissed the plaintiff’s claims for breach of implied warranty of merchantability (by plaintiff’s concession); nuisance (for failure to allege that the defendant owned land in the state where the nuisance was alleged, and failure to allege that the nuisance-conduct occurred on land the defendant owned); trespass (for failure to allege the defendant new the off-target movement was directed at plaintiff’s bee-keeping operation, and because the Dicamba was not in the defendant’s control after being sold); strict liability – ultrahazardous activity (because this “repackages” the Lanham Act claim); violation of Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (because Dicamba use had been federally approved, and no allegation made of fraudulent intent); statute of limitations (because state law does not recognize a continuing-tort theory of tolling the statute of limitations). Coy’s Honey Farm v. Bayer Corp., No. 1:18md2820 SNLJ, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10514 (E.D. Mo. Jan. 20, 2022).\n\nPosted December 29, 2021\n\nState Law Imposes Corporate Liability for Employee Wrongdoing. A fire started on the plaintiff’s property and eventually consumed about 7,500 acres. The fire was started by one of the plaintiff’s employees who was responsible for maintaining a camp and conference cent that the plaintiff owned and operated. A chimney malfunctioned in one of the cabins on the property which caused the cabin to fill with smoke. The employee moved a smoldering log for the fireplace in the cabin and put it in the outdoor fire pit. Unfortunately, sparks from the log caught the nearby dry vegetation on fire and started the fire. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection incurred $12 million in fighting the fire. An investigation by the State revealed numerous fire safety violations on the premises such as kindling a fire in a malfunctioning fireplace; lack of fire extinguishers or water source; and failure to clear dry vegetation. The State sought reimbursement for the cost of fighting the fire and investigating the source of the fire from the employee and the employee’s employer. The plaintiff claimed that state law eliminated respondeat superior and asserted that a corporation can only be held directly liable by its own failure to act or when it authorizes its employees or agents to act a certain way. The state Supreme Court disagreed, noting that respondeat superior was part of the common law and that the state’s Health and Safety Code incorporated the common law theory of respondeat superior to allow the State to recover the taxpayer dollars it spends on fighting and investigating wildfires caused by human negligence. Presbyterian Camp & Conference Centers, Inc. v. Superior Court, No. S259850, 2021 Cal. LEXIS 8914 (Cal. Sup. Ct. Dec. 27, 2021).\n\nPosted December 28, 2021\n\nLandlords Not Liable for Death Caused by Tenants’ Dogs. The plaintiffs, family members of the decedent sued the defendants (a married couple) for the decedent’s death. The decedent died when he fell backwards and hit his head while out walking and dogs barked and approached him. The dog was owned by the defendants’ son-in-law and daughter and resided with them at the home they leased from the plaintiffs. The defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis that they didn’t owe any duty to the plaintiffs because they did not own or keep the dogs, and had no actual or constructive knowledge of any dangerous of vicious propensities of the dogs, and no actual or constructive knowledge of any dangerous condition on their property. The trial court agreed with the defendants and granted their summary judgment motion. On appeal, the appellate court affirmed. The appellate court noted that state (CA) law did not base liability solely on knowledge that the tenants had dogs which may not be restrained or leashed at all times. There is no vicarious liability for alleged negligent acts of tenants. The injury (here, death) was not reasonably foreseeable to the defendants and, as such, the defendants had no duty to terminate the lease because of unleashed, non-dangerous dogs on the leased premises. Kim v. Vivas, No. D078843, 2021 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 8125 (Cal. Ct. App. Dec. 27, 2021).\n\nRight-To-Farm Law Upheld. The plaintiffs challenged the state (North Carolina) Right-to-Farm (RTF) law. The RTF law was originally enacted in 1979 with the state policy goal to: \"[R]educe the loss to the State of its agricultural and forestry resources by limiting the circumstances under which an agricultural or forestry operation may be deemed a nuisance.\" After many nuisance suits were filed against confinement hog operations, the legislature amended the RTF in 2013. The amendment specified that an ag operation that has been in business for at least a year and has not fundamentally changed is protected from a nuisance action as a result of changed conditions surrounding it if the ag operation was not a nuisance at the time it began. The plaintiffs refiled their suits in 2014 in federal district court based on the amended law. The federal court held that the RTF law did not apply to shield hog producers and five juries rendered verdicts for the plaintiffs. The legislature again amended the RTF in 2017 and 2018 to expand its protection for agricultural operations. The plaintiffs sued in 2019 challenging the constitutionality of the RTF law on its face because they claimed the law exceeded the scope of the state’s police power. The defendants moved to dismiss the case and the trial court granted the defendants motion to dismiss and denied the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the appellate court affirmed. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that limiting the potential nuisance liability from ag, forestry, and related operations furthered the state’s goal of protecting ag activities and encouraging the availability and continued production of agricultural products. The appellate court also determined that the RTF law amendments were a valid exercise of legislative and state police powers and did not violate the state Constitution’s Law of the Land Clause or the Due Process Clause. The appellate court also determined that the amendments were not a special or private law, and didn’t deprive any prospective plaintiff of the right to a jury trial. Rural Empowerment Association for Community Help v. State, No. COA21-175, 2021 N.C. App. LEXIS 733 (N.C. Ct. App. Dec. 21, 2021).\n\nPosted November 26, 2021\n\nFarmers Detrimentally Relied on Crop Supply Salesman to Check Crops. The plaintiff corporation is a tenant farmer. Over a period of at least 25 years, a close friend would check the corporation’s crops for stinkbugs. The friend became employed by the defendant and continued checking the plaintiff’s crops for stinkbugs. Eventually, confusion over the corporation’s credit account arose and the defendant’s location manager told the friend that he should tell the plaintiff’s owner and his father that they probably needed to find somewhere else to do business. The manager also told the friend that the friend might not need to go back to the plaintiff’s fields. The friend never communicated this to farmers, and neither did anyone with the defendant. The manager did have a phone conversation with the farmers and thought they knew what he meant, but never told the farmers that the friend would no longer be checking their fields. In late summer, the farmers discovered that their soybean fields had not been checked and that, by then, stinkbugs had caused major damage to the crop. Upon harvest, yield was dramatically reduced. The plaintiff sued the defendants after harvest for lost profit and also alleged that a different crop consultant could have been found if the friend and/or the defendants had given timely notice that crop consulting services had stopped. The plaintiff’s petition was later amended to add an allegation that the reduced soybean yield caused a premature sale of a cattle herd in order to compensate for the lack of revenue from the sale of harvested crops. The trial court heard testimony from various experts as to economic loss, and concluded that the plaintiff justifiably relied to its detriment on the defendants to advise concerning the products to use on the plaintiff’s fields and when to apply them. That justifiable reliance, the trial court concluded, caused the plaintiff to change position to its detriment. The trial court also determined that the defendants owed a duty to the plaintiff and failed to conform to that duty resulting in substantial crop damage which could have been avoided if the defendants had inspected the crops. As to damages, the trial court accepted the methodology of a CPA that examined yield on nearby farms and concluded that the plaintiff sustained damages of $246,334, The trial court rejected the defendants’ argument that the plaintiff failed to mitigate damages by waiting at least two weeks to spray for stinkbugs after discovering the infestation. At the time of discovery of the stinkbug problem, the trial court determined, the crop damage had already occurred and the second wave of bugs didn’t arrive until two weeks later. However, the trial court, rejected the plaintiff’s claim that it was forced to sell 600 head of cattle to pay down debt because of the lost crop revenue. The trial court also rejected an emotional distress claim. On appeal, the appellate court upheld the trial court’s finding of causation of damages to the soybean crop by the defendants. On the damages issue, the appellate court reduced the award to $148,946 based on the best historical yields over a five-year span rather than the yield from nearby field in 2016 (the year of the crop loss) based on the standard for calculating damages set forth in Aultman v. Rinicker, 416 So. 2d 641 (La. Ct. App. 1982). The appellate court also determined that, based on the evidence, the plaintiff failed to mitigate damages and, as a result, reduced the damage award further to $134,051. Dettenhaim Farms, Inc. v. Greenpoint Ag, LLC, et al., No. 54,162-CA, 2021 La. App. LEXIS 1729 (La. Ct. App. Nov. 17, 2021).\n\nPosted November 18, 2021\n\nEgg Stacker Not Entitled to Workers’ Comp. Egg stacking involves repetitive lifting, twisting, and carrying packed cases to stack on pallets. Throughout his employment the plaintiff, an egg stacker, saw a doctor multiple times to discuss his back pain, a lumbar spine herniation from years prior, and pain treatment. Also, during his employment, the plaintiff told his supervisor that he was experiencing significant pain, but that it was due to him sleeping wrong. On another occasion, the plaintiff told a workplace administrator that he injured his back when he fell while mowing the lawn. For this he supplied a doctor’s note. However, when the note expired the plaintiff failed to provide another one and failed to return to work. The plaintiff’s employment was terminated. About a month after his termination, the plaintiff resumed seeing a doctor. Each doctor visit after his termination referenced a work injury. The plaintiff brought a workers’ compensation claim, but the workers’ compensation commissioner found that the plaintiff failed to establish that his injury ‘arose out of” or “in the course of” his employment. The plaintiff appealed the commissioner’s determination to the court. The court noted that an injury “arises out of” the employment if a causal connection exists between the employment and the injury. An injury occurs “in the course” of employment when the injury and employment coincide as to time, place, and circumstances. Both tests must be satisfied for the injury to be deemed compensable. While the plaintiff’s back injury could be the result of or aggravation from his work activities, the court determined that his testimony was inconsistent and that he failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the injury arose out of his employment. Thus, the court upheld the commissioner’s finding. Tew v. Sparboe Farms, Inc., No. 20-1202, 2021 Iowa App. LEXIS 867 (Iowa Ct. App. Oct. 6, 2021).\n\nPosted August 29, 2021\n\nPrivate Zoo Deemed a Public Nuisance. The plaintiffs visited the defendant’s drive-by zoo where the defendants exhibited exotic animals such as a cougar, a lion, and “the world’s ugliest llama.” The defendants obtained their license to operate a zoo and exhibit wild animals from the USDA in 2002. The USDA would periodically inspect the premises. The plaintiffs visited the zoo on at least one occasion and subsequently sued the defendants claiming animal neglect under state law. The plaintiffs also alleged the zoo was a public nuisance and sought an injunction to prohibit the defendants from confining animals in inhumane and unsafe conditions. The plaintiffs also sought to divest the defendants of ownership in the animals and requested the animals be seized. The trial court allowed the plaintiffs to proceed with their animal neglect cause of action and found the defendants’ conduct constituted a public nuisance. The trial court also granted the injunction and divested the defendants of their ownership in the animals. On appeal, the defendants argued that the trial court incorrectly allowed the plaintiffs to pursue their animal neglect claim, because state law did not provide a private remedy. The plaintiffs alternatively argued that the defendants’ appeal was moot. The plaintiffs pointed to the defendants’ agreement with the USDA to refrain from exhibiting wild animals in the zoo. The USDA and the defendants had come to an agreement whereby the defendants admitted to willfully violating federal regulations under the Animal Welfare Act and the USDA revoked the defendants’ license to operate a zoo exhibiting wild and exotic animals. The appellate court noted that the relief granted by the trial court was broader, as the defendants were divested of all ownership of exotic animals and wildlife, some of which were used in their livestock operation. The appellate court also noted that while ruling in favor of the defendants would not result in the return of the seized animals, doing so would allow the defendants to reaffirm ownership in the livestock they maintained for their livestock operation. As a result, the appellate court determined the appeal was not moot. However, the appellate court noted that the defendants failed to preserve the error on the issue. At trial, the defendants did not present the affirmative defense that the state animal neglect law did not provide for a private remedy. Therefore, the appellate court declined to consider the issue on appeal. On the defendants’ challenge to the public nuisance ruling, the appellate court again noted the defendants failed to preserve error on the issue. The appellate court also noted that even if error had been preserved, the plaintiffs’ failure to provide a legal description of the land did not void the public nuisance claim. Lastly, the defendants claimed they did not receive a fair trial as the judge made a site visit and acted as an advocate for the plaintiffs. The trial court judge made several comments regarding the poor conditions of the zoo during the trial and to some of the witnesses. The appellate court noted that although it is best for a trial court judge to exercise restraint and avoid questioning witnesses, the trial court judge was allowed greater leeway to comment during the bench trial than he would be during a jury trial, and therefore the trial court judge did not deprive the defendants of a fair trial. Kuehl v. Sellner, No. 19-1980, 2021 Iowa App. LEXIS 669 (Iowa Ct. App. Aug. 4, 2021).\n\nPosted April 30, 2021\n\nDefendant’s Removal of Trees Within Conservation Easement Deemed Not a Nuisance. The developers of a subdivision agreed to record a conservation easement twenty feet wide along two boundaries of the subdivision after complaints by local farmers. The conservation easement’s purpose was to preserve the visual aesthetic for residents who enjoyed the rural setting. Although the restrictive covenants that were recorded did not reference the conservation easement, the developer recorded a final plat that explicitly referred to the conservation easement. The defendant purchased a lot in the subdivision and proceeded to remove some trees and brush from within the conservation easement. The defendant had reviewed the restrictive covenants, which had not been updated after the final plat was recorded. The defendant also had met with a representative of the subdivision’s homeowner’s association, who advised the defendant that he could clear the trees and brush so long as he did not change the grade of the land. The plaintiff was an adjoining neighbor outside the subdivision who sought damages for the loss of quiet enjoyment of his property. The trial court found that the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the activity within the conservation easement. Further, the trial court noted that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that he had been denied a property right. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that although he lacked standing to enforce the conservation easement, he was entitled to damages to address a nuisance. The plaintiff noted that the developers had set aside a conservation easement pursuant to state law and that the defendant’s conduct amounted to nuisance per se. The appellate court noted that the conservation easement enabling statute did not provide the plaintiff with a private right of enforcement. Alternatively, the plaintiff argued that the defendant’s conduct created a nuisance per accidens as the right to the quiet enjoyment of his property had been destroyed. The appellate court noted that whether the defendant’s conduct qualified as a nuisance per accidens depended on whether his conduct would cause actual physical discomfort to a person of ordinary sensibilities. The appellate court found that the plaintiff failed to show any such evidence, and as a result, affirmed the trial court’s decision and denied the nuisance damages sought by the plaintiff. Cergnul v. Bradfield, 2021 Ind. App. Unpub. LEXIS 295 (Ind. Ct. App. Apr. 9, 2021).\n\nPosted March 27, 2021\n\nMeasure of Damages for Destroyed Trees at Issue. The plaintiff owned a ranch used for commercial hunting purposes that was adjacent to the defendant’s property. The ranch had a row of hedge trees approximately 20 yards wide and 300 yards long adjacent to the defendant’s property. The hedge trees were mature trees. The defendant’s tenant contacted the plaintiff requesting permission to cut down the hedgerow and install a fence. The plaintiff told the tenant to not cut down the trees or disturb the vegetation. However, the tenant proceeded to cut down the hedgerow and installed a fence. In the process about 156 mature trees were destroyed. The plaintiff sued alleging negligence, conversion and trespass claiming that that the loss of the trees decreased the value of the property for hunting purposes. The defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to bar the plaintiff from presenting evidence about the trees’ replacement value, claiming that Kansas law did not recognize replacement value as a proper measure of damages for tree destruction. The defendant specifically referred to the plaintiff’s two experts, arborists that were prepared to testify that the replacement cost of the trees was $1,092,361. The trial court granted the motion. The defendant then moved for summary judgment, claiming that the trial court’s grant of the motion in limine established that the plaintiff could not establish that damages existed and, thus, had no claim. The trial court granted the summary judgment motion on the negligence issue, finding that the plaintiff did not know the market value of the ranch before and after the trees were removed and, thus, could not prove damages. In its response to the summary judgment motion, the plaintiff claimed that the ranch was damaged by virtue of the tree removal reducing the quality of hunting on the ranch. However, the trial court viewed this assertion did not convert any of the defendant’s statement of facts. The plaintiff appealed. On appeal, the issue was whether the plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence of damages to present its case to a jury. The appellate court first determined that the plaintiff had not abandoned its claims for conversion and trespass because the defendant didn’t specifically address the conversion and trespass claims in the defendant’s trial court motions focusing solely on negligence. The appellate court also determined that the trial court did not err in granting the defendant’s motion in limine. The appellate court noted that damages must be calculated in a manner that is reasonable, citing the fact that replacement cost of the trees with mature trees would exceed three times the value of the ranch. Thus, it was proper for the trial court to exclude the plaintiff’s proposed evidence on replacement cost of the hedgerow with mature trees. On review of the grant of summary judgment on the negligence claims, the appellate court noted that the general rule that the measure of damages for negligent destruction of trees is difference in market value of the land immediately before and after the damage. However, the appellate court noted that this rule is not inflexible, and the parties may present evidence supporting alternative measures of damages – trees having value independent of the land; loss of income from fruit trees; sentimental value of a tree, etc. On this point, the appellate court concluded that the plaintiff had submitted sufficient evidence of damages to overcome the defendant’s summary judgment motion. The appellate court noted that the plaintiff had provided sufficient evidence to overcome the motion by showing that the removal of the trees impacted the quality of hunting on the ranch which justified reasonable replacement costs as a measure of damages. The appellate court also determined that the plaintiff had provided sufficient evidence of damages on the conversion and trespass claims. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. Ringneck Farms, LLC v. Steuwe, 471 P.3d 33 (Kan. Ct. App. 2020).\n\nNuisance Case Against Hog CAFO Continues. The plaintiff sued the defendant for trespass, negligence, civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment arising from odor, dust, feces, urine and flies from a neighboring hog facility that housed 20,000-head of the defendant’s hogs. The plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages. The defendant sought to dismiss the complaint for failure to join to the lawsuit the farmer that operated the hog facility via a contact with the defendant as an indispensable party. The court disagreed as the farmer’s conduct was likely irrelevant to the outcome of the litigation and any impact that an adverse judgment against the defendant might have on the farmer’s interests at the farm was speculative. The defendant also sought dismissal on the basis that the plaintiff’s complaint failed to state a claim for relief that was other than speculative. The defendant cited the state (NC) right-to-farm (RTF) law as barring all of the plaintiff’s claims. However, the court disagreed noting that conditions that constitute a nuisance can also constitute a trespass (and other causes of action). Thus, the plaintiff’s complaint was not restricted to allegations of a nuisance cause of action which the RTF law would bar. The court noted that the NC RTF law was different from other state RTF laws that covered non-nuisance tort claims related to farming operations along with nuisance claims. The NC RTF law only covered nuisance-related claims and had no application to non-nuisance claims. As to whether the plaintiff adequately alleged the non-nuisance claims, the court concluded that the plaintiff sufficiently alleged, at a minimum, a claim for unintentional trespass by not consenting to dust, urine and fecal matter from entering its property. On the plaintiff’s negligence claim, the court determined that it was reasonably foreseeable that if the defendant did not act reasonably in managing the facility that dust and animal waste would be present on the plaintiff’s property. As such, the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty and there was a causal link with any potential breach of that duty. Thus, the plaintiff properly stated a claim for negligence. The plaintiff also alleged that the defendant conspired with its corporate parent to mislead the public about the science of hog manure removal and various constitutional violations. The court rejected this claim because any conspiracy was between the defendant and its corporate parent and not with any independent party. The plaintiff also claimed that the defendant unjustly enriched itself by using the plaintiff’s property for a de facto easement without paying for it. The court rejected the claim because the plaintiff had conferred no benefit on the plaintiff which gave rise to any legal or equitable obligation on the defendant’s part to account for the benefit received. However, the court refused to strike the plaintiff’s allegations relating to the defendant’s Chinese ownership, influence and exploitation as well as the defendant’s financial resources. The court determined that such allegations had a bearing on the defendant’s motivation, extent of harm and ability to implement alternative technology. Barden v. Murphy-Brown, LLC, No. 7:20-CV-85-BR, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47809 (E.D. N.C. Mar. 15, 2021).\n\nPosted February 27, 2021\n\nAnimals Running At-Large Result in Criminal Citations; Deemed Nuisance. The plaintiffs owned a farm where they resided along with various farm animals. The defendants lived to the west and north of the plaintiffs. The county animal control officer had visited the plaintiffs’ farm on several occasions in response to complaints of animals running at-large. After receiving more complaints about the plaintiffs’ horses and cattle running unrestricted, the officer issued civil citations to the plaintiffs. The civil citations were eventually dismissed because the county ordinance only applied to dogs running at-large. The officer then issued criminal citations, which made it a misdemeanor to permit any animal to run at large, when complaints continued. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants were tampering with the fence and letting the animals loose in a neighborhood-wide conspiracy to get the plaintiffs to move away. At trial, the plaintiffs argued the defendants committed malicious destruction of property by tampering with the electric fence and causing it to short out. The plaintiffs also argued that the officer had maliciously issued civil and criminal citations. The defendants counterclaimed that the plaintiffs’ animals habitually being at large constituted a nuisance. The trial court concluded that summary judgment was appropriate on the issue of the whether the officer had maliciously issued the civil and criminal citations because the plaintiffs failed to allege they suffered a special injury. At trial, the jury found that the defendants had not maliciously destroyed the plaintiffs’ fence and that the plaintiffs’ animals habitually being at large constituted a nuisance. On appeal, the plaintiffs argued that the trial court erred in dismissing their claim of malicious prosecution against the officer. The appellate court determined that although the officer may have acted with malice in making threatening statements to the plaintiffs, the officer had more than probable cause in issuing the citations. The appellate court noted that the officer had made numerous complaints and made several trips to the plaintiffs’ farm over a two-year span to help return animals to the farm. Additionally, the appellate court held that the plaintiffs failed to preserve their claims for appeal by not filing for a new trial. The appellate court did note that even if the plaintiffs had preserved their claims, the evidence was overwhelmingly not in their favor. Zlatkin v. Roggow, No. 346247, 2020 Mich. App. LEXIS 2144 (Mich. Ct. App. Mar. 19, 2020).\n\nPosted February 12, 2021\n\nNo Liability for Escaped Prescribed Burn. An individual owned a 15-acre property to provide a place for his brothers and other family members to hunt. The defendant, a retired USDA employee, managed the property and planned to burn the 15-acres to burn off crop residue and a small of pine stumps. The defendant had many years of experience with conducting prescribed burns. The purpose of the burn was to replant it as a food plot for deer hunting. In preparation for the burn, the defendant cut firebreaks on three sides of the property with a harrow The Georgia Forestry Commission (GFC) cut a firebreak on the fourth side of the field. The defendant acquired a fire permit for the day of the burn from the GFC. The defendant’s brother assisted with the burn and a GFC employee was nearby to assist if needed. On the day of the burn the defendant tested the wind and started the fire, stringing a line of fire along the four sides with the intent that the fire lines would meet in the middle of the field. The fire jumped the firebreak and the defendant called for the GFC employee made two other firebreaks that doubled the size of on of the existing firebreaks. The fire jumped the widened firebreak, escaping to the plaintiffs’ property. The fire destroyed the plaintiffs’ garage, workshop and various tools and car part contained in the workshop. The plaintiffs sued and the defendant moved for summary judgment based on the Georgia Prescribed Burning Act (OCGA) §§ 12-6-145 – 12-6-149. The trial court granted the motion, finding that the OCGA protected the defendant from liability. On appeal, the plaintiffs claimed that the OCGA didn’t apply because the fire was not a prescribed burn. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the fire met the statutory definition of “prescribed burn” and that the plaintiff bore the burden to prove that the defendant conducted the burn with gross negligence. The appellate court noted that the OCGA also protected the defendant from liability to damages from smoke, drifting, ashes or heat as well as damages or injury caused by fire. Thus, the appellate court concluded that the OCGA liability protection applies even if the fire which was intended to be confined to a predetermined area escapes the predetermined area. The appellate court also rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that the OCGA didn’t apply because the burn was no conducted in accordance with the permit. The appellate court rejected this argument, finding that the property burned was “’agricultural land,” a permitted property type specified in the permit. While the permit noted that the burn could begin at 9:30 a.m., the appellate court determined that did not mean that the burn had to begin at that time. The appellate court noted that the defendant was experienced in conducting prescribed burns; had cut firebreaks completely around the property; checked the wind before starting the fire; carefully selected the ignition point; and had assistance to help with the burn. Accordingly, the appellate court determined that the defendant did not conduct the burn with gross negligence and upheld the trial court’s grant of summary judgment for the defendant. Newton v. Jacobs, No. A20A1787, 2021 Ga. App. LEXIS 28 (Ga. Ct. App. Jan. 27, 2021).\n\nPosted January 16, 2021\n\nEmployee Refurbishing Property to Make Horse Farm Subjected Employer To Workers’ Compensation. The defendant employed the plaintiff to clean and maintain structures on the defendant’s property which was zoned for agricultural use. Part of the plaintiff’s job was to also mow certain areas of the property. The defendant intended to operate a horse farm on the property after it was refurbished. While working on the property, the plaintiff severely injured her right foot. The plaintiff suffered various complications which lead to her foot being amputated. As a result of the injury, the plaintiff sought workers’ compensation benefits. The defendant argued that it was a business engaged solely in agriculture exempt from state (KY) workers’ compensation and, alternatively, the plaintiff was engaged in an exempt agricultural activity. The administrative law judge found that the defendant was solely engaged in agriculture as the defendant had purchased the property for no other purpose than to operate a horse farm. The administrative law judge also found that the plaintiff was a person employed in agriculture under state law because her activities qualified as “work performed as an incident to or in conjunction with the farm operations.” The plaintiff appealed to the Workers’ Compensation Board. The Board agreed that the defendant was engaged solely in an agricultural activity at the time of the injury, but determined the plaintiff was a domestic employee who engaged primarily in tasks not typically associated with agriculture. As such, the defendant was not exempt from the state workers’ compensation law. The defendant appealed, arguing that an employee of an entity engaged solely in agriculture should be automatically exempted from workers’ compensation coverage because they are also engaged in agriculture. The appellate court held that the plaintiff was hired in a non-agricultural capacity and that her tasks consisted of activities not normally associated with agriculture. The appellate court noted that the fact that the defendant was engaged solely in agriculture did not necessarily mean the plaintiff’s work was primarily agricultural. The appellate court also noted that although the plaintiff engaged in some agricultural activities, such as mowing, the bulk of the plaintiff’s duties were considered non-agricultural. Therefore, the appellate court affirmed the Board’s decision that the defendant was not exempt from paying workers’ compensation benefits to the plaintiff. Brownwood Property, LLC v. Thornton, 2020 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 250 (Ky. Ct. App. 2020).\n\nPosted December 30, 2020\n\nCourt Reduces Dicamba Drift Damage Award; Case Continues on Appeal. The plaintiff claimed that his peach orchard was destroyed after the defendants (Monsanto and BASF) conspired to develop and market dicamba-tolerant seeds and dicamba-based herbicides. The plaintiff claimed that the damage to the peaches occurred when dicamba drifted from application to neighboring fields. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants released its dicamba-tolerant seed with no corresponding dicamba herbicide that could be safely applied. As a result, farmers illegally sprayed an old formulation of dicamba herbicide that was unapproved for in-crop, over-the-top, use and was \"volatile,\" or prone to drift. While many cases had previously been filed on the dicamba drift issue, the plaintiff did not join the other litigation because it focused on damages to soybean crops. Monsanto moved to dismiss the claims for failure to warn; negligent training; violation of the Missouri Crop Protection Act; civil conspiracy; and joint liability for punitive damages. BASF moved to dismiss those same counts except the claims for failure to warn. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss in part. Monsanto argued that the failure to warn claims were preempted by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (\"FIFRA\"), but the plaintiff claimed that no warning would have prevented the damage to the peaches. The trial court determined that the plaintiff had adequately plead the claim and denied the motion to dismiss this claim. Both Monsanto and BASF moved to dismiss the negligent training claim, but the trial court refused to do so. However, the trial court did dismiss the claims based on the Missouri Crop Protection Act, noting that civil actions under this act are limited to “field crops” which did not include peaches. The trial court did not dismiss the civil conspiracy claim based on concerted action by agreement, but did dismiss the aiding and abetting portion of the claim because that cause of action is no recognized under Missouri tort law. The parties agreed to a separate jury determination of punitive damages for each defendant. Bader Farms, Inc. v. Monsanto Co., et al., No. MDL No. 1:18md2820-SNLJ, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114302 (E.D. Mo. July 10, 2019). At the jury trial, the jury found that Monsanto had negligently designed or failed to warn for 2015 and 2016 and the both defendants had done so for 2017 to the present. The jury awarded the plaintiff $15 million in compensatory damages and $250 million in punitive damages against Monsanto for 2015 and 2016. The jury also found that the defendants were acting in a joint venture and in a conspiracy. The plaintiff submitted a proposed judgment that both defendants are responsible for the $250 million punitive damages award. BASF objected, but the trial court found the defendants jointly liable for the full verdict in light of the jury’s finding that the defendants were in a joint venture. Bader Farms, Inc. v. Monsanto Co., et al., MDL No. 1:18-md-02820-SNJL, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34340 (E.D. Mo. Feb. 28, 2020). BASF then moved for a judgment as a matter of law on punitive damages or motion for a new trial or remittitur (e.g., asking the court to reduce the damage award), and Monsanto moved for a judgment as a matter of law or a new trial. The trial court, however, found both defendants jointly liable, although the court lowered the punitive damages to $60 million after determining a lack of actual malice. The trial court did uphold the $15 million compensatory damage award upon finding that the correct standard under Missouri law was applied to the farm’s damages. Bader Farms, Inc. v. Monsanto Co, et al., MDL No. 1:18md2820-SNLJ, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 221420 (E.D. Mo. Nov. 25, 2020). The defendants filed a notice of appeal on December 22, 2020.\n\nPosted December 16, 2020\n\nRight-to-Farm-Act Defense Deemed Frivolous. The plaintiff township sued the defendants for operating a commercial contractor’s business on property that was zoned as agricultural land under the local zoning ordinance. The defendants had previously owned land in another area of town, where they ran their commercial landscaping business, before moving to the agriculturally zoned land. The defendants stored commercial vehicles and equipment on the land, which also violated the zoning ordinance. The defendants argued that they were operating a tree farm and nursery, and the vehicles were being used to prepare the land to conduct tree farming operations. Specifically, the defendants argued that the local zoning ordinances were preempted by the Right to Farm Act. The trial court determined that the defendants use of the property was not protected under the Right to Farm Act. The plaintiff then sought court costs and attorney fees, contending that the defendants’ defense was frivolous. The trial court awarded the plaintiff costs and fees against the defendants, but not the defendants’ attorney. On appeal, the defendants argued that the trial court erred in finding that their defense under the Right to Farm Act was frivolous. The appellate court held that the defendants provided little to no evidence to show that they were operating a tree farm as opposed to an excavation and gravel business. The defendants argued that their improvements and alterations to the land were necessary to prepare the property for a tree farm. The appellate court found that the scale of the improvements coupled with the number of trucks and heavy equipment strongly implied the land was being used in furtherance of the defendants’ commercial landscaping business. Therefore, the appellate court held that the defendants’ assertion of a defense under the Right to Farm Act had no merit and was frivolous. The plaintiff appealed the trial court’s decision to not order costs and fees against the defendants’ attorney. The appellate court held that under state law, a court is required to sanction an attorney who asserts a frivolous claim. The appellate court then remanded the issue of determining the reasonable amount of costs and fees the plaintiff incurred from the frivolous Right to Farm Act defense. Lima Township v. Bateson, 2019 Mich. App. LEXIS 8179 (Mich. Ct. App. Dec. 19. 2019).\n\nPosted November 25, 2020\n\nAppellate Court Upholds $750,000 Compensatory Damage Award in Hog Nuisance Suit. The plaintiffs were pre-existing neighbors to the defendant’s large-scale confinement hog feeding facility conducted by a third-party farming operation via contract. The facility annually maintained nearly 15,000 of the defendant’s hogs that generated about 153,000 pounds of feces and urine every day. The waste was disposed of via lagoons and by spreading it over open “sprayfields” on the farm. The plaintiffs sued in state court in 2013 for nuisance violations, but later dismissed that action and refiled in federal court after learning of the defendant’s control over the hog feeding facility naming the defendant as the sole defendant. The trial court coordinated 26 related cases against similar hog production operations brought by nearly 500 plaintiffs into a master case docket and proceeded with trials in 2017. In the instant case, the jury awarded $75,000 in compensatory damages to each of 10 plaintiffs and $5 million in punitive damages to each plaintiff. The punitive damage award was later reduced to $2.5 million per plaintiff after applying a state law cap on punitive damages. On appeal, the appellate court determined that the trial court had properly allowed the plaintiffs’ expert testimony to establish the presence of fecal material on the plaintiffs’ homes and had properly limited the expert witness testimony of the defendant concerning odor monitoring she conducted at the hog facility. The appellate court also rejected the defendant’s claim that the third party farming operation should be included in the case as a necessary and indispensable party. The appellate court also affirmed the trial court’s holding concerning the availability of compensatory damages beyond the rental value of the property and the jury instruction on nuisance. The appellate court also concluded that the trial court properly submitted the question of punitive damages to the jury. The appellate court reversed the trial court’s admission of financial information of the defendant’s corporate grandfather and combining the punitive damages portion of the trial with the liability portion, but held that such errors did not require a new trial. However, the appellate court remanded the case for a consideration of the proper award of punitive damages without consideration of the grandparent’s company’s financial information (such as compensation amounts to corporate executives). As a result of this litigation several states, including Nebraska and Oklahoma, have recently amended the state Right-To-Farm law with the intent of strengthening the protections afforded farming operations).

Smithfield Foods, Inc. said that the settlement, \"takes into account the divided decision of the court.\"\n\nPosted October 1, 2020\n\nFarmer Omitted From New Trial After Jury’s No Liability Finding. The plaintiff was a passenger on her fiancé’s motorcycle when he collided with a farm tractor. The defendant was driving the tractor on a county road and was attempting to turn left while the motorcyclist was attempting to pass the tractor. The collision resulted in injuries to the plaintiff and she sued the defendant for negligently operating the tractor. The defendant filed a claim against the motorcyclist, alleging that the motorcyclist’s negligence caused the plaintiff’s injuries. The plaintiff subsequently amended her claim to allege her own direct negligence claim against her fiancé. At trial, the jury returned a verdict finding the defendant was not negligent. The jury verdict form instructed the jurors to leave questions pertaining to the motorcyclist’s fault and damages unanswered if they found the defendant was not at fault. The plaintiff sought a new trial against the defendant and motorcyclist based on the flawed verdict form. The trial court granted a new trial as to the motorcyclist alone and concluded the verdict was complete as to the defendant because he had been exonerated of all fault. On appeal, the appellate court reversed and remanded for a new trial on all issues as to both the defendant and motorcyclist. The appellate court held that a complete retrial was necessary because the question of the fault of the two drivers was intertwined. The defendant appealed to the Iowa Supreme Court, arguing he had been found not negligent in the original trial. The Supreme Court held that the jury’s finding that the defendant was not negligent was untainted by the erroneous instructions on the verdict form. Further, the Supreme Court held that the error on the verdict form only prejudiced the plaintiff’s claim against the motorcyclist. The plaintiff argued that both drivers must be on the verdict form to compare their fault in the retrial. The Supreme Court held that the jury had exonerated the defendant, which only left the plaintiff’s claims against the motorcyclist to be determined in the retrial. Whitlow v. McConnaha, 935 N.W.2d 565 (Iowa Sup. Ct. 2019).\n\nPosted September 9, 2020\n\nBulk of Property Damage Claims Fail. The parties resided on adjacent properties. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant was responsible for damages arising from the removal of trees from within a natural buffer zone; removal of a 30-year old drainage pipe on the defendant’s property; intentionally altering the natural grade of the property so as to interfere with the natural flow of water; and trimming a maple tree located along the boundary line. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant installed an underground storage tank (UST) on the defendant’s property without a permit. As a result, the plaintiffs sued for both public and private nuisance and property destruction. The plaintiffs claimed that they suffered mental anguish; flooding caused by the removal of trees; invasion of privacy; residing adjacent to a hazardous condition due to the UST; and other potential damages to their property’s foundation as a result of the defendant’s actions. The plaintiffs also claimed that the defendant trespassed multiple times to alter the natural drainage flow of water and cut the plaintiffs’ trees. The defendant claimed that the plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the tree removal, as the land where the tree removal occurred was owned by the City. Additionally, the defendant argued that the plaintiffs failed to provide expert evidence and that the defendant was entitled to summary judgment. The state trial court held that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue under a public nuisance claim and that there was no private right of action for an ordinance violation. As for private nuisance, the court held that the plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient facts to support the nuisance claim, had not submitted expert reports to show necessary elements of their claims, and had not submitted expert reports to prove they suffered damages. Although the plaintiffs alleged the defendant’s UST was an abnormally hazardous activity, the trial court noted the plaintiffs failed to provide an expert witness and report that could explain the hazardous nature of the activity. The court also held that the plaintiffs needed to submit expert witness reports to show how they suffered damages from the defendant’s action. The plaintiffs claimed they were able to give an opinion as to the value of the real estate, but the trial court noted that plaintiffs may only do so in condemnation proceedings. As for the other claimed damages (and potential damages) the court held that the plaintiffs failed to causally connect the defendant’s actions to any property damage. The trial court also noted that the plaintiffs failed to identify an expert witness and submit an expert report to show how the defendant’s actions caused the destruction of the plaintiffs’ property. The court granted summary judgment to the defendant on all claims, except for the trespass claim and the claim for damage to a maple tree. On those claims, fact issues remained to be resolved. Dayton v. Collison, No. N17C-08-100 CLS, 2019 Del. Super. LEXIS 446 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 24, 2019).\n\nPosted September 6, 2020\n\nPlaintiff Unable to Establish Solar Farm as Nuisance. The plaintiff owned land zoned as “Exclusive Farm Use.” The plaintiff alleged that construction of a collection of solar panels (solar array) built on an adjacent property constituted a nuisance by interfering with her use and enjoyment of her property. The plaintiff’s suit was against the adjacent landowner; a company that held a conditional use permit for the solar array; and the construction company. The plaintiff alleged that all three defendants were responsible for the nuisance and trespass claims. The trial court granted summary judgment to all three defendants, finding that the plaintiff failed to offer any material evidence to establish either her nuisance or trespass claim. The court held that the defendant landowner did not engage in any activity constituting a nuisance or trespass. Landowners are generally not responsible for nuisances occurring after the execution of the lease, unless the landowner knew the activity being carried on would involve an unreasonable risk causing the nuisance or had control over the activities on the land. The trial court also noted that merely because the solar company obtained the permit that ultimately allowed construction to happen did not show they had any control over the construction workers’ actions. As for the actions of the construction company, the trial court held the plaintiff failed to allege evidence of an unreasonable interference with her private use or enjoyment of her land. Although the plaintiff complained of increased traffic and leftover debris, she was unable to establish that she had to adjust any daily habits or the manner in which she enjoyed her property as a result of the construction company’s conduct. The plaintiff alleged that a ditch built between the array and her property caused flooding on her property. However, the trial court noted the plaintiff could not show that the defendant construction company built the ditch or that the ditch directly diverted water onto her property. Yates v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, No. 6:17-cv-1819-AA, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 160799 (D. Or. Sept. 20, 2019).\n\nPosted September 4, 2020\n\nLandowner Owes No Greater Duty of Care Under Recreational Use Statute. The plaintiff is the administrator of the estate of a three-year-old who drowned in a brook on the defendants’ property. The defendants are the parents of the owners of the daycare where the decedent had been attending when the accident occurred. The defendants’ land was connected to the daycare property, and the daycare would regularly use a small area of the defendants' land to access a brook beach. The daycare used the defendants’ land for various outdoor activities. The defendants did not profit from the daycare and were not involved in any of the daycare’s business activities. The defendants' land was not posted, and they had always held it open to the public for recreational use. The plaintiff sued the defendants alleging their negligence was the direct and proximate cause of the incident. The state recreational use law encourages owners to make their land and water available to the public for no consideration for recreational uses without increasing liability potential for the owner. Under the statute, a recreational user is treated as an adult trespasser. The defendants claimed that they merely had to avoid willful or wanton misconduct for the statutory protection to apply. The trial court found that the activities engaged in by the daycare on defendants’ land were both recreational and educational, therefore qualifying as a recreational use. However, the trial court dismissed the defendants' motion for summary judgment because questions remained as to whether the defendants’ property was open and undeveloped land that qualified for protection under the statute. On appeal, the appellate court reversed the trial court and held that the statute applied. The appellate court held that the daycare’s use of the defendants’ property was without consideration, as the defendants received no benefit from the daycare’s use of their land. Additionally, the appellate court agreed with the trial court that the daycare’s use of the defendants’ land qualified as a recreational use. The appellate court further held that the defendants’ land was open and undeveloped. The general public was freely permitted to use defendants’ land, along with the daycare. Although the defendants had placed a sandbox and brook bridge on their land, the appellate court noted that the legislature had expressly stated that the presence of such objects on land would not, by itself, preclude land from being open and undeveloped. Therefore, the defendants were covered under the recreational use statute and were needed to only avoid willful or wanton misconduct to recreational users. Nolan v. Fishman, 218 A.3d 1034 (Vt. 2019).\n\nPosted August 30, 2020\n\nRailroad Responsible For Faulty Railroad Fence. The plaintiffs collided with a cow on a public highway. The defendant was responsible for building and maintaining the adjacent fence along a ranch that it had a right-of-way through. The plaintiffs alleged that the railroad company negligently maintained the fence, which allowed a cow to escape onto the highway. The defendant claimed that it did not own the cow that escaped, and that the plaintiff’s theory for recovery hinged on the defendant first being found liable in an action against the owner of the livestock. The defendant removed the action from New Mexico state court to federal court and sought a judgment with respect to both of the plaintiffs’ negligence claims. The court interpreted the New Mexico legislature’s intent of whether the plaintiffs were a protected class under the state’s fence law and determined that the plaintiff failed to establish a negligence per se claim requiring railroads to build fence lines. The purpose of the railroad fencing portion of the fence law, the court determined, was to protect owners of livestock rather than the motoring public. The plaintiffs’ second claim was that the defendant was per se negligent by permitting the cow to wander upon the road. The statute at issue stated that it was unlawful for “any person” to “negligently permit” livestock to wander upon any unfenced highway. The defendant argued that the term “permit” required that the negligence of the owner of the livestock must be established before liability would attach. Although the court determined that the phrase “any person” had not been construed to mean persons other than owners of livestock, it concluded that the New Mexico legislature had limited the application of similar statutes and failed to do so in this instance. According to the court, the failure to limit the statute by the state legislature meant the statute was intended to be interpreted broadly in order to protect a broader class of people. The court held that the plaintiffs had established themselves as members of the class sought to be protected by the fence law and that the defendant had permitted the cow to wander on the road. Upon further consideration, the plaintiff must establish whether the defendant had negligently permitted the cow to wander upon the road. Leslie v. BNSF Ry. Co., No. Civ. 1:16-cv-1208-JCH-JHR, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154460 (D. N.M. Sept. 10, 2019).\n\nPosted April 12, 2020\n\nNo Liability For Damages to Cattle in Quarantine. The plaintiff sought monetary damages against the federal government for cattle sale losses due to a state declared temporary fever tick quarantine that placed restriction on the movement and sale of the cattle and required that they be submitted for inspection and treatment. The plaintiff claimed that its cattle were injured and died as a result of the quarantine. The plaintiff claimed that the government personnel negligently rounded up the cattle for treatment. At least 14 cattle died and more were injured. The trial court dismissed the case due to lack of jurisdiction under the quarantine exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). The appellate court affirmed. The appellate court noted that the quarantine exception applies when the plaintiff’s damages are reasonably foreseeable. Because the damages were caused by the implementation of the quarantine, the defendant’s action fell within the quarantine exception to the FCTA. Cascabel Cattle Co., LLC v. U.S., No. 19-40077, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 10712 (5th Cir. Apr. 6, 2020).\n\nPosted April 7, 2020\n\nPetition to Quiet Title Over Disputed Boundary Denied. The parties had been adjoining rural landowners since 1988. When the defendant bought his tract, a survey and that survey was relied on in litigation between the parties concerning a dispute over logged timber on a five-acre parcel where ownership between the parties was not clear via the respective deeds. A few years later the plaintiff sued to quiet title to the disputed area claiming that the true boundary was the existing fence line based on either the theory of adverse possession or boundary by acquiescence. The trial court determined that the plaintiff had failed to establish the requirements for either theory and refused to quiet title in the plaintiff. On appeal, the appellate court agreed. Based on the evidence, the appellate court determined that the plaintiff failed to establish exclusive use of the disputed area for the statutory period and did not substantially maintain or improve the area, all elements of adverse possession and did not bring the quiet title action for six years after the initial dispute over timber. The appellate court also determined that the defendant did not treat the fence line as the boundary. Thus, no boundary by acquiescence was established because both parties did not assume the fence line was the boundary. Liddiard v. Mikesh, No. 19-0143, 2020 Iowa App. LEXIS 267 (Iowa Ct.

The defendant, a commercial watermelon grower, bought a pollinizer plant (SP-6) and other seeds from the plaintiff. The SP-6 was used to pollinate seedless watermelons. The defendant instructed the plaintiff to plant the SP-6 with seedless watermelons at a 1:3 ratio. The plaintiff did so for the 2015 season and experienced unprecedented amount of hollow heart (cracks and hollow spaces inside the watermelon) in their watermelon crop. The defendant refused to pay on part of the invoices because of the hollow heart issue. The plaintiff filed suit seeking payment of the outstanding balance. The defendant filed a counter claim, claiming breach of express and implied warranties and breach of contract on the basis that SP-6, used as recommended by the plaintiff, caused the hollow-heart issues. The trial court granted summary to the plaintiff finding that the defendant failed to present enough causation evidence to support its theory that SP-6 caused hollow heart and that contractual disclaimers and limitations on liability precluded the defendant’s claims. The trial court awarded the plaintiffs $53,413.36 including interest. On appeal, the appellate court affirmed. On the causation issue, the appellate court was not persuaded that the evidence supported the defendant’s theory that SP-6 caused the hollow heart problem. While the maker of SP-6 had released a new product (SP-7) that improved upon SP-6, that fact was insufficient to establish that the maker knew SP-6 was a faulty product. In addition, the appellate court noted that the defendant’s own expert referenced numerous factors that could have caused the problem such as overfertilization; nutritional deficiencies; high temperature; excessive moisture; and other pesticides. The appellate court also upheld the award of interest. Rispens Seeds v. Bailey Farms, No. 347079, 2020 Mich. App. LEXIS 1901 (Mich. Ct. App. Mar. 12, 2020).\n\nNuisance Case Fails To Be Made. The plaintiff sued the defendant on nuisance and negligence theories concerning the defendant’s hog operation on an adjacent tract. The plaintiff claimed that before the defendant’s hogs arrived in 1995, the plaintiff’s property was “quiet and peaceful.” After the arrival of the hogs, the plaintiff claimed it was impossible to enjoy being outdoors. The plaintiff also claimed that the hogs negatively impacted his health and contaminated his drinking water. The defendant moved to dismiss the case and the court agreed. The court noted that under the state (North Carolina) Right-to-Farm Act, to bring a nuisance claim, the plaintiff must be the legal owner of property affected by the conditions alleged in the complaint; the property affected by the conditions must be located no more than a half mile away from the agricultural operation; and the claim must be brought within one year of the agricultural operation being established or undergoing some fundamental change. The defendant argued that the plaintiff violated all three of these mandatory provisions and had therefore alleged insufficient facts to bring his case. The court agreed and ordered the plaintiff’s complaint to be dismissed, and the case closed. Lewis v. Murphy-Brown, LLC, No. 7:19-CV-127-BR, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44997 (E.D. N.C. Mar. 16, 2020).\n\nPosted March 12, 2020\n\nContractor Liability and Workers’ Compensation. The defendant farmer had a production contract with the defendant chicken company to grow chickens on the farm. The chicken company hired the defendant chicken catchers and a trucking company to load and remove the chickens from the farm. The decedent drove truck for the trucking company and was at the farm to have chickens loaded into the truck. One of the employees of the chicken catchers turned on a forklift and left it running while he left to go to the bathroom. Another employee of the trucking company got on the forklift and began loading chicken cages on the decedent’s truck. This employee was not authorized to operate the forklift and was reprimanded for forklift operations in the past. While operating the forklift, the employee ran over the decedent and killed him. The decedent’s estate file a worker’s compensation claim against the trucking company for the accident. The estate also sued the defendant farmer, chicken company, and the chicken catchers. All of the defendants moved for summary judgment and the trial court granted each motion. On further review, the appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The appellate court affirmed summary judgment for the chicken company on the basis that it was the decedent’s statutory employer and, as such, immune from liability under state workers’ compensation law. However, the appellate court reversed the award of summary judgment to the chicken catchers because fact issues remained concerning immunity under the workers’ compensation law and the catchers’ duty to the decedent. The appellate court also reversed the award of summary judgment for the farmer. The farmer failed to raise at trial the affirmative defense of assumption of risk and a question remained concerning whether the farmer was in a joint venture with the chicken company that is relevant for purposes of the workers’ compensation statute. Mullinax v. Pilgrim's Pride Corp., Nos. A19A1899, A19A1900, A19A1901, 2020 Ga. App. LEXIS 143 (Ga. Ct. App. Mar. 9, 2020).\n\nPosted March 1, 2020\n\nSuit To Recover Fire Damage on Federal Land Continues. A wildfire started on private land at the base of the defendant’s power pole. A jumper cable at the top of the pole between two of the service drop transformers failed, sparked and discharged a piece of molten wire into combustible material at the base of the power pole. The fire burned for a month, burning 49,600 acres, most of which was federal land. The fire cost the federal government $17.7 million, including $15.8 million fighting the fire and nearly $2 million in rehabilitation costs. The government claimed that the defendant improperly installed the jumper cable and installed undersized equipment, which caused the fire. The government claimed that the landowners were at fault for failure to inform the defendant of increases in their electrical load at the ice plant, which aggravated the problem with the undersized equipment. The private landowners also didn’t install electricity-regulating equipment and didn’t remove combustible material near the power pole. The government filed suit based on theories of negligence, res ipsa loquitor, trespass, and nuisance against the defendant. The defendant moved for summary judgment. The court allowed the case to proceed on the negligence, nuisance and trespass theories (provided there was a single recovery), but not the res ipsa loquitor theory. On the res ipsa loquitor theory, the court could not conclude that, based on common knowledge and experience alone, a layperson could infer that the fire would not have happened without negligence on the defendant’s part. Accordingly, the court denied the defendant’s motion for summary judgment with respect to negligence, nuisance and trespass theories, but granted it with respect to res ipsa loquitor. United States v. Idaho County Light & Power Cooperative Association, No. 3:17-cv-00391-CWD, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30437 (D. Idaho Feb. 21, 2020).\n\nFamily Farming Operation Generates Multiple Legal Issues. The family farm was transferred from the mother to four of her eight children in 1977. Many of the children also bought land together. In 1980 a farm partnership was formed by three of the children, with each of them having a one-third interest in the partnership. Land was transferred to the partnership. In 1990 the partnership assets, except the land, were transferred to a corporation. Each sibling maintained one-third interest in the corporation. Two siblings later died, and a surviving sibling (a brother) maintained the interests in the partnership and corporation that passed to him. In 2011 a barn on the partnership property was damaged in a fire, with insurance proceeds being placed in the corporate account. The land that the partnership owned was logged with the proceeds from the timber placed in the corporate account. In 2013 the plaintiff filed suit against the brother, partnership and corporation seeking partnership dissolution, partition, and breach of fiduciary duty. The defendant brother countered with breach of fiduciary duty, offset, and unjust enrichment. A referee was subsequently appointed to provide a report to the trial court regarding the partition claim. The trial court jury found that the defendant breached his fiduciary duty, but that the plaintiff did not, and awarded the $10,500 to the plaintiff. The jury also found the plaintiff had been unjustly enriched and awarded the defendant $15,106. The plaintiff filed a post-verdict motion asking the court to change the jury's answer to Question 10 on the special verdict, regarding whether the plaintiff had been unjustly enriched—from \"Yes\" to \"No\" and to change the jury's answer to Question 11 — regarding damages for the unjust enrichment — to zero. The court granted this motion. At the bench trial, the court divided the property into thirds, one third to the plaintiff and two thirds to the defendant. A survey needed to be completed and the court ordered that the parties pay for it according to their new ownership amount. The court found that the insurance proceeds were not to be included in this division but the income from the timber was. Ultimately, the land was partitioned, the partnership dissolved, and the plaintiff awarded income from the sale of timber. Both parties appealed. The appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The appellate court reversed and remanded on the adverse possession issue because the trial court did not require the partnership to prove that the partnership’s possession was hostile, open and notorious, and exclusive. However, the court upheld the trial court’s finding of a breach of fiduciary duty and that the trial court properly denied an award of attorney fees to the plaintiff. Springer v. Springer Bros., No. 2019AP249, 2020 Wisc. App. LEXIS 77 (Wisc. Ct. App. Feb. 25, 2020).\n\nLivestock Trespass Law Applies In Both “Fence-In” and “Fence-Out” Counties. Texas is a “fence-out” jurisdiction unless state law specifies that a particular area utilizes the “fence-in” rule with respect to livestock that escape their enclosure. All livestock owners owning land adjacent to a State or U.S. highway in Texas are to fence-in their livestock. In addition, voters in counties may approve a change from utilizing the fence-out theory to using the fence-in theory unless otherwise barred by statute. Some counties are also statutorily barred from changing the rule in the particular county from fence-out to a fence-in. For escaped livestock, state law provides that a landowner owning land on which escaped livestock have been found is to call the local sheriff to report the escaped animal(s). The sheriff is to search for the owner and may impound the livestock if the owner isn’t found within five days. If the owner cannot be found after giving notice, the sheriff can sell the livestock at public auction. On the question from a county statutorily barred from using the fence-out theory, the State Attorney General opined that a local county sheriff must follow the rules for handling escaped livestock regardless of whether the sheriff presides in a fence-in or fence out jurisdiction. This is the case even though the livestock owner may not have any obligation to prevent the livestock from running at large (as is the case in a fence-out jurisdiction). Texas Att’y. Gen. Op. No. KP-0278 (Dec. 4, 2019).\n\nPosted February 21, 2020\n\nLivestock Owner Not Liable For Collision With Bull. The plaintiff was injured when the vehicle he was driving collided with a bull on a state highway. The plaintiff filed sued the defendant, the owner of the bull and the land from which the bull escaped, alleging the defendant was negligent in various ways. The trial court granted the defendant’s motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff appealed, claiming that the defendant had a statutory duty under two provisions of Chapter 143 of the Texas Agriculture Code: §143.071 and §143.102. The primary dispute on appeal was whether defendant also owed the plaintiff a statutory duty under the stock law provisions of Chapter 143. The stock law provisions refer to the provisions of Chapter 143, subchapter D, that authorize a county to adopt a stock law and opt into additional statutory regulations regarding certain classes of animals roaming at large. If a county adopts a stock law, then \"a person may not permit any animal of the class mentioned in the proclamation to run at large in the county or area in which the election was held.\" The defendant argued that the statutory duty imposed by the stock law provisions did not apply for two reasons: (1) the plaintiff did not properly prove that Wilson County actually adopted a stock law; and (2) the stock law provisions conflict with §143.102 and Chapter 143 provides that §143.102 prevails in case of a conflict. In his summary judgment response, plaintiff produced a 2010 Proclamation by the County Judge of Wilson County. The 2010 Proclamation contained the County Judge's order showing the results of the election to adopt a local stock law prohibiting cattle from running at large throughout Wilson County. The appellate court determined that this order is prima facie evidence that the requirements of this chapter have been complied with in relation to presenting the petition, ordering the election by the commissioner’s court, giving notice, holding the election, counting and returning votes, and declaring the results. As such, the appellate court held that plaintiff properly proved that Wilson County adopted the stock law. In addition, the appellate court held that the stock law provisions and §143.102, when their meanings are ascertained from a plain language reading of their statutory terms, do not conflict. Section 143.102 prohibits individuals from knowingly permitting an animal to traverse or roam at large, unattended, on the right-of-way of a highway. The stock law provisions authorize counties to adopt a stock law and opt into an additional set of statutory regulations. No part of the stock law provisions authorize individuals to knowingly permit an animal to traverse or roam at large, unattended, on the right-of-way of a highway. They also do not allow a county to authorize individuals to knowingly permit an animal to traverse or roam at large, unattended, on the right-of-way of a highway. Consequently, the court held that, facially, there was no conflict between the stock law provisions and §143.102. The appellate court also concluded that \"knowingly\" in §143.102 is not violated if a person who is responsible for controlling a bull merely should have known the bull had been permitted to traverse or roam at large, unattended, on a highway's right-of-way. The plaintiff relied on the fact that the defendant knew cattle had escaped on a previous occasion when the gate was left open; and that the defendant always kept the gate locked because he believed cattle would get out if the gate was not locked but used a latch, and did not use the lock, on the date of the accident. However, the appellate court determined that this evidence did not support a reasonable inference that the defendant was aware his bull had broken the latch and wandered onto the highway. Therefore, the court held that plaintiff failed to produce summary judgment evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact that the defendant knowingly permitted the bull to traverse or roam at large, unattended on a highway. Consequently, the appellate court affirmed the trial court’s judgment as it related to the plaintiff’s allegation that the defendant was negligent by violating §143.102. However, the appellate court also determined that the statutory duty in the stock law provisions of chapter 143 is that \"a person may not permit any animal of the class mentioned in the proclamation to run at large in the county or area in which the election was held.\" The appellate court held that this provision, which did not include a knowing requirement, may be breached by evidence showing the person was at fault in allowing any mentioned animal to run at large. Therefore, because the plaintiff produced evidence showing the defendant failed to take reasonable measures to ensure his cattle would not escape, such as locking the gate and using a cattle guard, the plaintiff’s evidence showed that there was a sufficient risk of cattle escaping that the defendant believed it necessary to keep the gate locked. As such, the appellate court reversed the remainder of the trial court’s decision. On further review, the Texas Supreme Court dismissed all claims against the bull owner. The Texas Supreme Court held that when a livestock/auto collision occurs on a state or U.S. highway in a county with a stock law, the applicable standard is “knowingly permit.” The plaintiff failed to satisfy the heightened standard.

Jan. 31, 2020).\n\nPosted February 9, 2020\n\nRight to Maintain Road Creek-Bed Eliminates Erosion Claim. The plaintiff purchased his 199-acre farm in 1979. The defendant purchased his adjacent and upstream farm in 1999. The county road is the only access to both farms, which was allegedly impassable when the defendant purchased his farm. The parties had to drive in the creek bed to get to their farms. The defendant filled in the existing road, added concrete walls to maintain the creek bed, and dredged the creek to help with the flow of water. The defendant claimed that he never moved the location of the road or creek, but merely fixed each of them. The plaintiff admitted that the defendant had the right to maintain and repair the road and the erosion to his land from the repairs were tolerable. In April 2015, 4 inches of rain fell in a brief period which caused flooding. In response to the flooding the defendant added a third wall to the creek edge. The plaintiff argues that this wall is now causing erosion to his land. The plaintiff also stated that he has not spent money maintaining the road and likes driving in the creek. There is also an underlying boundary dispute with this cause of action as well, but neither party disputes the trial court order on appeal. The plaintiff sued to settle the boundary dispute and for damages caused by erosion. Before trial, the judge went to the site twice. The plaintiff testified that the defendant had moved the road and the creek with the work that the defendant had done. On cross examination, the plaintiff admitted that the defendant had returned the creek to its original channel. There was also testimony from engineers, contractors, surveyors, realtors and neighbors. The defendant moved for directed verdict on the causation and damages issue. The trial court granted the motion and then heard arguments on the boundary dispute which included other defendants. The trial court agreed with the defendants’ surveyor who utilized deeds, rather than an old fence which was partially in the dirt, to make their suggestion to the court. The plaintiff appealed on the erosion issue and the appellate court affirmed. The appellate court pointed out that entering a directed verdict on the causation in the boundary dispute was an error, but that the issuance of an early dismissal was the correct procedure and would achieve the same result. However, the appellate court did not grant an early dismissal. On the motion for directed verdict, the appellate court determined that the evidence supported the defendant’s arguments. The appellate court also concluded that the site visits had not unduly influenced the trial court judge. Thompson v. McCoy, No. 2018-CA-000527-MR, 2019 Ky. App. LEXIS 157 (Ky. Ct. App. Aug. 23, 2019).\n\nOwner Not Liable in Negligence or Strict Liability For Butting Lamb. The defendant owned a farm with many animals. He kept a sheep named “Lamby” in his home as a \"guard sheep\" because of prior break-ins. Lamby is friendly, but territorial and would head butt the defendant and his girlfriend when agitated. In 2013 the defendant called the company that employed the plaintiff to schedule an appointment at the farm. The plaintiff and her co-worker were told to call before the appointment because the defendant was not always home and keeps a guard sheep. At the appointment, Lamby was penned up with the other sheep and the plaintiff and coworker petted him. The defendant had to see another specialist before getting fitted for a hearing aid, so the defendant said to call before coming to his home for another appointment. The defendant never received another call. In August 2013 the plaintiff and co-worker returned to the defendant’s home when he was at his other residence. The plaintiff and co-worker went past the gate which had a no trespassing sign and up to the house. Lamby headbutted the co-worker while unloading things from the truck. After realizing the defendant wasn’t there the plaintiff offered to “handle” Lamby so that the co-worker could get back to the truck. According to the plaintiff, Lamby butted her several times with enough force that she \"went airborne\" and \"everything went black.\" According to the co-worker, when Lamby caught up with the plaintiff, Lamby butted one time, and she \"hit the license plate a little bit.\" The plaintiff’s sunglasses and flip-flops \"fell off,\" and she suffered a scrape on her foot. The plaintiff and co-workers laughed about the incident back at the office, and the plaintiff did not seem to be in distress. The plaintiff sought medical assistance the day after the incident. According to the plaintiff, she suffered a traumatic brain injury, underwent shoulder and back surgeries, and would require additional surgeries as a result of the incident. The defendant did not know about the incident until he got a letter from the plaintiff’s lawyer months later. The plaintiff sued claiming strict liability and negligence. The trial court found for the defendant and ordered that the plaintiff take nothing against the defendant. No party filed a post-judgment motion or requested findings of fact and conclusions of law. On appeal, the appellate court affirmed. The plaintiff claimed that the trial court’s implied findings on the strict liability claim was not supported by sufficient facts or law. To prove strict liability the plaintiff had to prove that the defendant was the owner or possessor of the sheep; that the sheep had dangerous propensities abnormal to its class; that the defendant knew or had reason to know the sheep had dangerous propensities; and that those propensities were a producing cause of her injury. The court held that the record did not establish that the defendant knew or had reason to know the sheep had a dangerous propensity. The defendant testified that all sheep \"will butt you to a certain extent\" because \"it's their nature.\" Further the defendant contended Lamby sometimes butted him and his girlfriend, but such behavior was not \"vicious\" or \"the kind of aggression that a guard dog would have where they [sic] continually attack . . . and try and really put you down\"—Lamby \"just butts you.\" The defendant and his girlfriend had never been injured by the headbutting and compared it to running in to something. Further the defendant had no knowledge of anyone being hurt by Lamby when he was gone. Gonzalez v. Ahrens, No. 14-18-00417-CV, 2019 Tex. App. LEXIS 7936 (Tex. App. Aug. 29, 2019).\n\nJanuary 14, 2020\n\nAerial Application of Ag Chemical Not Inherently Dangerous Activity. This case involves a dispute involving alleged damage to the plaintiffs’ trees caused by chemicals that allegedly drifted during aerial application. The plaintiffs attempted to hold liable both the aerial applicator and the landowner that hired the applicator. The plaintiffs claimed the landowner was vicariously liable for the applicator’s actions because aerial spraying of burndown chemicals is an \"inherently dangerous activity.\" The trial court granted the defendants’ motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law on the plaintiff's trespass claim, but the remaining issues were left for the jury to resolve. The rest of the issues were left to a jury. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants on the negligence and negligence per se claims. The plaintiffs filed a motion for a new trial, arguing the verdict was against the weight of the evidence; that the trial court erred in excluding evidence; and that the trial court erred in granting the defendants’ Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law. The trial court, however, denied the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial. On appeal, the appellate court affirmed. The appellate court determined that the jury’s verdict was not against the weight of the evidence, and that the aerial application of herbicides was commonplace and not inherently dangerous. In addition, the appellate court noted that the defendants’ evidence was that the herbicides did not actually drift onto the plaintiffs’ property and that the applicator complied with all label requirements and sprayed during optimal conditions. The appellate court also determined that the trial court had ruled properly on evidentiary matters and that the plaintiff had not proven the alleged monetary damages to the trees properly. The appellate court also upheld the trial court’s denial of the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial. Keller Farms, Inc. v. Stewart, No. 1:16 CV 265 ACL, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 210209 (E.D. Mo.

Dec. 11, 2019).\n\nJanuary 11, 2020\n\nCattle Feedlot Permanent Nuisance, But Each Manure Runoff Was a Temporary Nuisance – Case Not Time-Barred. The plaintiffs owned property adjacent to the defendants’ cattle feedlot. The feedlot began operating in 2006 and was investigated in 2009 and 2013 by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) due to manure run-off issues. The IDNR required that the defendants take remedial action. In 2016 the plaintiffs sued for negligence, trespass, and nuisance. The plaintiffs claimed, \"from approximately 2009 to the present there have been multiple occasions when manure from [the defendant’s] cattle lot has entered upon, and traversed over, [the plaintiffs’] property.\" The defendants countered with defamation, arguing that the plaintiffs made false statements about the feed lot and published it to third parties. The defendants moved for summary judgment arguing that the nuisance cause of action was barred by the five-year statute of limitations. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment. The trial court determined that the plaintiffs were claiming that the feedlot was a permanent nuisance from its inception in 2006. The plaintiffs did not make separate nuisance claims for each instance of runoff which would make their claims an intermittent nuisance. On further review, the appellate court reversed and remanded. The only issue on appeal concerned the statute of limitations. The parties agreed that a five-year statute of limitations applied. Thus, the statute of limitation issue turned on whether the manure runoff is a permanent issue or a continuing issue. If the manure runoff constituted a permanent nuisance, the statute of limitations was tolled in 2006 and would have expired in 2011. Conversely, If the manure runoff amounted to an intermittent nuisance, the statute of limitations would be tolled upon each occurrence. The appellate court determined that the defendants failed to meet their burden of proof that the runoff was a permanent nuisance in order to sustain their motion for summary judgment. Permanence of a nuisance, the appellate court held, goes to the injury itself and the defendants did not show that the damage to the plaintiffs’ property could not be cleaned up or abated. Instead, the defendants relied upon the contention that the runoff from the feed lot was not temporary. The appellate court determined that he feedlot itself is a permanent nuisance but the runoff itself is a temporary nuisance. Thus, the plaintiffs’ suit was not time barred. Dvorak v. Oak Grove Cattle, L.L.C., No. 18-1624, 2019 Iowa App. LEXIS 743 (Iowa Ct. App. Aug. 7, 2019).\n\nNovember 23, 2019\n\nSome Dicamba Drift Claims Proceed. The plaintiff claimed that his peach orchard was destroyed after the defendants (Monsanto and BASF) conspired to develop and market dicamba-tolerant seeds and dicamba-based herbicides. The plaintiff claimed that the damage to the peaches occurred when dicamba drifted from application to neighboring fields. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants released its dicamba-tolerant seed with no corresponding dicamba herbicide that could be safely applied. As a result, farmers illegally sprayed an old formulation of dicamba herbicide that was unapproved for in-crop, over-the-top, use and was \"volatile,\" or prone to drift. While many cases had previously been filed on the dicamba drift issue, the plaintiff did not join the other litigation because it focused on damages to soybean crops. Monsanto moved to dismiss the claims for failure to warn; negligent training; violation of the Missouri Crop Protection Act; civil conspiracy; and joint liability for punitive damages. BASF moved to dismiss those same counts except the claims for failure to warn. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss in part. Monsanto argued that the failure to warn claims were preempted by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (\"FIFRA\"), but the plaintiff claimed that no warning would have prevented the damage to the peaches. The trial court determined that the plaintif"
