Prerequisites, Co-requisites, and other limitations on enrollment are announced in advance.\n\nAfrican American Males & the Law From Dred Scott to the Scottsboro Boys, to Rodney King to possibly Trayvon Martin, African-American males are negatively impacted by the American Justice system. African-American males are disproportionately represented in every aspect of the criminal justice system, from being racially profiled, stopped, arrested, prosecuted, sentenced, incarcerated, and placed on death row. Indeed, the over representation of African-American males in the criminal justice system negatively impacts their ability to gain meaningful employment, health care, the ability to vote, and to obtain a quality education, if any education at all. The purpose of this seminar is to identify, explore and determine the impact of the criminal justice system, court decisions, federal and state legislation, federal regulations, and the Constitution on the social and economic status of black males. Students will address issues related to black males in the areas of employment discrimination, the death penalty, the constitutionality of separate schools, Federal sentencing guidelines, AIDS, arrests and police brutality, NCAA’s Rules and Propositions, incarceration, education, exclusion as jurors in jury trials, harassment, and stereotypes. Other faculty members and members of the legal community may be invited to share their expertise on some of the topics covered. Students will be required to prepare an extensive research paper. This paper may be used to fulfill the Upper-class Writing Requirement. The seminar is also approved to meet perspective requirements.\n\nCriminal Responsibility The typical sanction for breaking a criminal law is punishment. But because punishment may be considered a social evil, the institution of punishment must itself be justified. In this course, we will consider the retributive and utilitarian justifications for punishment, both in execution and amount. We will then apply those theories to types of cases in which punishment seems unjustified, including cases of involuntary acts, insane actors, mentally retarded murderers, and battered spouses. The question in all of these cases is: Why—and to what extent—should such actors avoid punishment for the social harm they have caused? Students will read and discuss dense philosophical and legal texts on these and other related issues. Each student will be required to submit a 20-page publishable paper on a relevant (and approved) topic of her choosing. This course fulfills the perspectives requirement.\n\nIdeas of the First Amendment The first focus of the seminar will be the pivotal doctrines of first amendment law. For example, why is it important that we regulate speech after, rather than prior to, its expression; or why is viewpoint regulation more problematic than “neutral” regulation of speech; or should there be “paternalistic” reasons for regulating speech, designed to protect audiences from their own susceptibilities, to name a few. Although these doctrines are quickly canvassed in the core Constitutional Law courses, they are not given center stage as they will be in this seminar. The second focus of the seminar is that such questions are best studied by engaging a few of the greatest writings on the freedom of speech that have been generated in the Anglo-American tradition. The seminar will study these doctrines through the writings – some political polemic, some judicial opinions – of John Milton, James Madison, John Stuart Mill, Learned Hand, O.W. Holmes, Louis Brandeis, A. Meiklejohn and assorted “contemporary” replies. The course will fulfill the upper-level writing and perspectives requirements.\n\nInternational Criminal Law This seminar will deal with the following topics: sources of international criminal law; jurisdiction (nationality; protective, territorial, passive personality, universal); crimes against humanity; war crimes, genocide; torture; terrorism; aerial hijacking; hostage taking; extradition; money laundering; environmental crimes; narcotics trafficking; international judicial assistance; and prisoner exchanges.\n\nLatinx & the Law The seminar will cover salient legal issues that affect the Latinx community including workplace discrimination, voting rights, cultural stereotypes and hate speech/crime, immigration, and the criminal justice system. The courses will also address cross-cultural competencies and trauma informed client centered legal representation. The assigned materials will include cases, scholarly articles, films/documentaries, and popular commentary. Our class discussions will be student-centered emphasizing how attorneys may employ legal theories and strategies to address these daunting issues. The grades earned in the seminar will be based on class participation, a final paper (15 pages), and short reflection pieces. Student interested in serving underrepresented communities via direct legal representation or working in legislative and policy circles should find the course helpful for their professional development. Students may use the seminar to satisfy the upper-level writing and perspective requirements.\n\nLaw and Religion In this course, we will focus on the Supreme Court’s role in adjudicating issues regarding religious liberty. We also will raise issues regarding constitutional interpretation and will examine the development of substantive doctrine in this First Amendment area. After examining the basic historical and methodological materials, we will engage in a detailed examination of the most recent cases decided by the Supreme Court.\n\n982 INDEPENDENT RESEARCH PROJECT (1-3 credits): Significant research paper or an independent research project under the guidance of a member of the faculty.
