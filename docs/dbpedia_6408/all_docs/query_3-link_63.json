The focus of the seminar is to explore how social justice may be affected by seemingly neutral policies and laws. The objective of this seminar is three-fold: (1) to provide the opportunity to explore a wide variety of issues relating to different laws and policies through a social justice lens; (2) to provide exposure to comparative evaluations of various state statutes, federal laws and policies, international rules and laws; and (3) to provide advanced instruction in the history, goals, structure, values, rules and responsibilities of the legal professionals and their roles in social justice paradigm.\n\n2 credits\n\nThis course presents a summary overview of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes, focusing on the facilitative model of mediation. The fundamentals of the facilitative mediation model are explored to gain an understanding of the primary causes for conflict, the fuel that keeps conflict going, and the methods to resolve conflict through the use of collaborative problem solving and principled negotiation. It is a skills development course that emphasizes the importance of the mediator’s empowerment of the parties to help them resolve their dispute through more effective communication. Because of a strong emphasis on the nuances of communication, the skills developed in more precise and effective communication are generally very helpful in human interaction.\n\nStudents will gain an understanding of the mediation process and through participation in role plays will be able to experience the significance of the empowerment of the parties in the resolution of their own disputes.\n\n3 credits\n\nThis course will survey the uses of different payment mechanisms (negotiable and nonnegotiable instruments, credit cards and electronic funds transfer and wire transfer systems) in both credit and cash transactions. The course will consider allocation of risks for fraud, countermands, defenses on the underlying contract, mistake, timeliness and unauthorized payments. In each case the allocation of risks in connection with different payment mechanisms will be considered, along with whether these allocations should be the same or different for each mechanism. The course will focus on Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code and consider letters of credit under U.C.C. Article 5 and international payment regimes as well. The impact of federal legislation on the state payments law (U.C.C. Articles 3, 43 and 4A) may also be treated.\n\n3 credits\n\nThis course covers every aspect of pretrial preparation of a civil or criminal case. The focus of the course focus varies by semester. When the course covers civil pretrial practice, students proceed from initial client interview through formulating client representational strategy, developing a theory of the case, drafting pleadings, fact investigation, discovery and disclosure (depositions, issues, requests for production), motion practice, settlement conferences and negotiations, and final pre-trial preparation. When the course covers criminal pretrial practice, students proceed from initial client interview through formulating client representational strategy, developing a theory of the case, drafting motions, fact investigation, discovery and disclosure (depositions), Motions to Suppress, Arthur Hearings, Richardson Hearings and Motions in Limine.\n\nThis course also covers professionalism issues that arise in pretrial practice.\n\nPrerequisite: Evidence.\n\n3 credits\n\nThe goal of this course is to acquaint the student with the arsenal that benefits and protects both the debtor and the creditor. Specifically, the student will be introduced to the legal system and rules governing the relationship between the debtor and the creditor (in those instances where the creditor has or has attempted to acquire an interest in the debtor’s property as a means of ensuring satisfaction of the underlying obligation) and between that creditor and all of the debtor’s other creditors including, on frequent occasion, a bankruptcy trustee. Students will also be introduced to the concepts of secured financing transactions using the problem approach.\n\n3 credits\n\nThis course exposes students to a study of the federal and state securities laws and the industry they govern.

We will address the racial and legal history of major racial groups in the U.S., including African Americans, Native Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Whites. In addition to these histories, the course includes the following topics: competing definitions and understandings of race and racism; the legal system’s contribution to the construction of race; race, voting, and participation in democracy; developing notions of equality; segregation and education; and crime.\n\n2 credits\n\nThe focus of this seminar is to provide the student with the essential skills needed in order to become an effective legal researcher. This seminar will build upon the basic principles of legal research introduced in the first year and in other upper-level research courses. Topics generally covered include the use of primary and secondary sources; case law research; statutory law and legislative history; administrative law; effective use of legal research databases; and specialized research topics. Strong emphasis will be placed on developing those skills needed to develop efficient and effective search strategies to locate and evaluate authoritative sources, electronic, that are appropriate for the researcher’s information needs.\n\n2 credits\n\nThis seminar will explore the barriers to workplace equality, and the laws that touch upon those barriers. Specifically, we will examine both constitutional and statutory efforts to curtail discrimination including the Equal Protection Clause, Title VII, the ADA, the ADEA, the Equal Pay Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and others as well as the theoretical underpinnings of these statutes. Covered topics include sexual and racial harassment, sexual orientation discrimination, and affirmative action and other interventions aimed at increasing the minority and/or female representation in certain job categories or segments of the labor market. In addition to surveying the doctrine—as it stands and as it has developed over time—we will also study the array of social forces that led to the expansion of these laws and the recent retrenchment away from them.\n\n2 credits\n\nThis course explores the government's regulation of sexuality and gender. This course will cover legal doctrines relating equal protection, family law, employment, First Amendment, and privacy law.

There is also some study of the NCAA regulation of collegiate athletics.\n\n2 credits\n\nFew tax lawyers have formal training in tax policy even though a good foundation in tax policy helps in the understanding of the tax laws. Tax policy involves generally two broad questions: (1) does this particular tax law makes sense? And (2) is Congressional intent being followed? This course will begin by looking at the rationale behind some of the basic tax concepts such as gross income and the various deductions provided by the code. We will also look at whether some of the current code sections can be improved. This course is highly recommended to the student specializing in tax.\n\n2 credits\n\nThis course will examine the law, theory and practice of international, regional and sub-regional courts and other justice mechanisms such as truth and reconciliation commissions in South Africa, Sierra Leone, Liberia, El Salvador and Colombia, among others. It will examine the structure and practice of international courts and justice mechanisms, particularly the International Court of Justice as well as introduce a variety of other international tribunals including the International Criminal Court and the International tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights, European Court of Justice, World Trade Organization dispute settlement regime, World Bank Inspection Panel, and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.\n\n3 credits"
