        "text": "Comparing Upton Sinclair's The Jungle And The Progressive Era\n\n1401 Words | 3 Pages\n\nRings and alliances within political forces allowed powerful individuals to dictate the outcomes of decisions that would further increase their power and influence. By exploiting the desperation of powerless workers and immigrants, prominent figures like Mike Scully were able to rig elections, keeping specific people in power by buying votes with money replaceable to him, but invaluable to the desperate. The democratic party, to which Scully belonged, remained in power by giving the poor man so little that he was eager to undertake any task for the sake of money. When Jurgis was offered bribes for his vote, he realized that it was not “supposed to be right” to sell his vote, but also that refusing the money would not make “the slightest difference in the results” (Sinclair 134). Sacrificing the bribing money to take a stand was not an expenditure that the poor man could afford, and the working class was thus forced to facilitate the medium of their\n\nFried Green Tomatoes at the WhistleStop Cafe\n\n1741 Words | 4 Pages\n\nFried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Café, one of my finest works. Who am I? I am the author Fannie Flagg. I’ve been writing since the fifth grade, when I wrote, produced, directed and starred in a three-act comedy titled “The Whopee Girls”. It made the audience laugh, but it got me expelled because it had the word “martini” in it. I’ve always had dry wit. I then entered a Miss Alabama contest winning a scholarship to the Pittsburg Playhouse. I was the only girl who failed ballet.\n\nCampaign Finance Reform\n\n2679 Words | 6 Pages\n\nCampaign finance reform has a broad history in America. In particular, campaign finance has developed extensively in the past forty years, as the courts have attempted to create federal elections that best sustain the ideals of a representative democracy. In the most recent Supreme Court decision concerning campaign finance, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the Court essentially decided to treat corporations like individuals by allowing corporations to spend money on federal elections through unlimited independent expenditures. In order to understand how the Supreme Court justified this decision, however, the history of campaign finance in regards to individuals must be examined. At the crux of these campaign finance laws is the balancing of two democratic ideals: the ability of individuals to exercise their right to free speech, and the avoidance of corrupt practices by contributors and candidates. An examination of these ideals, as well as the effectiveness of the current campaign finance system in upholding these ideas, will provide a basic framework for the decision of Citizens United v. FEC.\n\nThe Marshall Court\n\n1506 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThe life of every American citizen, whether they realize it or not, is influenced by one entity--the United States Supreme Court. This part of government ensures that the freedoms of the American people are protected by checking the laws that are passed by Congress and the actions taken by the President. While the judicial branch may have developed later than its counterparts, many of the powers the Supreme Court exercises required years of deliberation to perfect. In the early years of the Supreme Court, one man’s judgement influenced the powers of the court systems for years to come. John Marshall was the chief justice of the Supreme Court from 1801 to 1835, and as the only lasting Federalist influence in a newly Democratic-Republican government, he and his fellow justices sought to perpetuate their Federalist principles in the United States’ court system. In one of the most memorable court cases of all time--the case of Marbury v. Madison-- Marshall established the idea of judicial review and strengthened the power of the judicial branch in the government. Abiding by his Federalist ideals, Marshall decided cases that would explicitly limit the power of the state government and broaden the strengths of the national government. Lastly, the Marshall Court was infamous for determining the results of cases that dealt with the interpretation of the Constitution and the importance of contracts in American society. The Marshall Court, over the span of a mere three decades, managed to influence the life of every American citizen even to this day by impacting the development of the judicial branch, establishing a boundary between the state and national government, and making declarations on the sanctity of contracts (\"The Marshall Court\"...\n\nAnalysis Of Kenneth Vogel's Big Money\n\n1391 Words | 3 Pages\n\nKenneth Vogel’s Big Money explores the invasion of money into our political system. In the novel, Vogel explains one of the most important important events that is currently happening in today’s elections: donors. This, according to Vogel, has been brought on by a ruling in the case Citizens United vs. the Federal Election Commission. The result of this case destroyed finance restrictions, giving Corporations and Unions the same laws of freedom of speech as individual Americans. The novel opens in February of 2012 where Vogel sneaks into a donor banquet. As our current president, Barack Obama, gives his speech, Vogel makes a note of the President’s words. In particular, Vogel focuses on one line “You now have the potential\n\nIt’s Time to Tell the True History of Texas\n\n1246 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe first exhibit I saw was the “It Ain’t Braggin’ if it’s True” (one of my friends told me I had to see the shrine to Lance Armstrong and the rhinestone car). The name of the exhibit didn’t make much sense to me though; aren’t all museum exhibits, especially ones about history, supposed to be true? The big banner in the middle of the room didn’t help much either. It simply said “Vision” and had a quote about how only those with great vision can see opportunity where others see empty space. Maybe those who have this type of vision get the braggin’ rights?\n\nThe Case Of Enso Martinez And Rebecca Fielding Against John Hopkins Hospital\n\n718 Words | 2 Pages\n\nMedical malpractice cases are difficult for the families who have lost their loved one or have suffered from severe injuries. No one truly wins in complicated court hearings that consist of a team of litigation attorneys for both the defendant and plaintiff(s). During the trial, evidence supporting malpractice allegations have to be presented so that the court can make a decision if the physician was negligent resulting in malpractice, or if the injury was unavoidable due to the circumstances. In these types of tort cases, the physician is usually a defendant on trial trying to prove that he or she is innocent of the medical error, delay of treatment or procedure that caused the injury. The perfect example of being at fault for medical malpractice as a result of delaying a procedure is the case of Waverly family versus John Hopkins Health System Corporation. The victims were not compensated enough for the loss of their child’s normal life. Pozgar (2012) explained….\n\nInterest Groups and Political Parties\n\n1676 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThe advocacy explosion is strongly linked to the decline of the American political party and the role of the political parties in elections. As interest groups have gained more power and had a larger control over politics and political goods the power that is exerted by political parties has dwindled. The power of the interest group has grown larger with the amount of members and the financial rewards that have come with the new members. In elections interest groups do not usually participate directly with the candidate or the election. Berry points out that “Groups often try to leverage their endorsement to obtain support for one of their priorities” (Berry, 53). With interest groups spreading their resources around the actual election can be affected very minimally by the many interest groups that contribute money to the election. However, the candidates who obtain political office through the help of special interest money still owe some sort of loyalty to the interest group regardless of which party wins the election. This loyalty and the promise of more money in the future gives the elected of..."
