        "text": "Any one film can sustain a myriad of compelling intepretations. A collection of films, however, sharing formal and substantive qualities, reveals a common effect more than a diversity of meanings. This essay traces the shared formal and substantive qualities of a group of films, as I name them ‘trial films’. It documents this genre of film by identifying the genre’s norms of viewing and identification. It also investigates peculiar hybrid discourse of the trial film genre that combines both filmic and legal discursive practices to show how trial films cultivate support for the American system of law through its constitution of a specific viewing audience. In so doing, I broach the following questions: how do images of law in film help sustain the power and legitimacy of legal institutions? How does the study of film genres, like the courtroom drama, reveal the way law lives beyond its formal processes?\n\nJon Van Dyke was not only a brilliant teacher and scholar but also a wonderful colleague and friend, so it is a privilege to participate in this conference organized in his honor. During the years we were colleagues, I benefited many times from his open-door policy: I could always discuss China and international law issues with Jon, and I’m still grateful for his expertise and support. Some years ago, I remember, we both spoke at a Law School panel on China and human rights, for which I focused on criminal justice. As part of my presentation, I raised a general question for our group: when would the criminal justice system be reformed in China, when would people there enjoy the rights essential to a fair trial? “When Chinese people make these criticisms themselves and press for their rights,” was Jon’s immediate reply. Since then, Chinese legal scholars and reformers have indeed worked hard to expand procedural rights in criminal trials and to limit the extrajudicial administrative ...\n\nAlthough the practice of law has long provided source material for works of fiction in literature, drama and film, the transformation of the judicial process into spectacle is commonly perceived as a serious problem. However, an analysis of trials that received heavy media exposure, and of various genres of fiction based on legal cases, demonstrates that it is crucial to distinguish between detrimental excesses and the fundamental characteristics of judicial proceedings: they are communicative events bringing together performers and spectators for a session whose efficacy demands their co-presence in a determined space and time. Since the rendering of justice is, essentially, a form of spectacle, we need to question the exact role of fiction in both: while the presence of fiction does not invalidate a trial, from a legal perspective, some real trials are essentially shows whose main purpose is entertainment or propaganda."
