        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn 2019, the Los Angeles-based fashion retailer MadHappy began selling sweatshirts featuring a remarkable new design. Alongside a “MadHappy” logo on the arm of the sweatshirt, the front of the sweatshirts displayed a circular rainbow with two psychedelically colored cornstalks shaped into a crest that enclosed four multicolored mountains bearing the names of Aspen, Colorado ski resorts.[2] Not long after the sweatshirts appeared in the Instagram feeds of celebrities, a Twitter storm from the Navajo Nation erupted chiding the retailer for appropriating what was immediately recognized as the Nation’s official seal.[3] The seal’s design, an original two-dimensional graphic work created in 1952 by Tribal member John Claw, Jr., is a cultural icon that, according to the Tribe, remains under copyright.[4] This latter consideration seems to have convinced MadHappy to stop production, divert proceeds from sales of the shirts to the Navajo Nation, and agree to undertake cultural sensitivity training for its staff.[5]\n\nThis instance of cultural appropriation ultimately ended amicably. But what result can Navajo Nation and other Indigenous peoples[6] expect in future copyright disputes should they be forced to litigate to protect their culture from unauthorized exploitation?[7] The answer to this question turns, in part, on whether courts will consider appropriations like MadHappy’s to be infringements or will sanction them under equitable legal doctrines like “fair use.”\n\nDebates surrounding the unauthorized appropriation of Indigenous peoples’ “intangible” culture—songs, dance forms, oral histories, designs—by those with power or privilege have been slowly unsettling the foundations of American copyright law for decades.[8] A growing stream of scholarship and news reports documenting cultural appropriations, from the seemingly innocent to the more intentional and obscene, have raised concern nationally and internationally, leading in some cases to protests and other forms of direct action.[9] In response, legal scholars working to theorize cultural rights have articulated what Indigenous peoples have intuited for centuries—that cultural appropriation functions as an extension of European-settler conquest, which has systematically dispossessed Indigenous communities of their lands, natural resources, family relationships, identities, and even their own bodies.[10]\n\nCongress has failed to adequately curtail unauthorized appropriations of Indigenous cultural expressions and other forms of intellectual property, despite its duty to protect Native American Tribes within its jurisdiction.[11] To be sure, Congress has provided some limited solutions to curb appropriation or desecration of “tangible” objects that are culturally important to federally recognized Indian tribes (hereinafter “Tribes”).[12] And Congress enacted a truth in advertising law, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act, which prohibits selling and displaying arts and crafts or “Indian Products” while falsely suggesting they are “Indian” made.[13] But, there are currently no federal laws other than copyright that prohibit the appropriation of Indigenous songs, dances, or other forms of Indigenous cultural expression. This is despite emerging global consensus that such forms of cultural expression should be protected from appropriation absent the free, prior, and informed consent of the Indigenous groups who created them.[14]\n\nScholars have proposed a number of ways to remedy harmful cultural appropriations. Some have looked to human rights principles, treaties, and customary international law as a basis for protecting Indigenous culture from non-Indigenous exploitation.[15] However, the United States has yet to ratify any of the international treaties specifically protecting intangible Indigenous culture. Others have advocated for the creation of new property frameworks, or the adaptation of existing ones under domestic law, to provide Indigenous groups enforceable rights against those who misuse their expressive cultures.[16] These innovative proposals, however, have yet to be fully taken up by Congress or the federal courts.\n\nWhile a comprehensive solution for protecting Indigenous culture from unauthorized exploitation remains elusive, a number of scholars have suggested that existing copyright law may provide Indigenous groups some limited rights to remedy misuses of cultural materials they or their members own.[17] Copyright protects the original expressions of authors—e.g., books, music, movies, fine art, dance, and other forms of “culture”—from unauthorized appropriation by granting copyright holders an enforceable property right to govern their use.[18] But, a number of exceptions limit the right, in part to ensure that culture is not completely “locked up” for future creators.[19] Determining copyright liability in instances of cultural appropriation from Indigenous peoples, then, requires robust analysis and careful balancing of Indegenous peoples’ interests in protecting their cultural contributions from misappropriation and the interests of society in having access to Indigenous culture.[20]\n\nTo date, while neither Congress nor the courts have dealt with the application of copyright law to Native Americans’ specific forms of cultural creativity,[21] both have provided several general mechanisms to assist in weighing the interests of copyright holders against the public’s interest in access to culture.[22] Foremost among these is copyright law’s fair use doctrine, which functions as a gatekeeping mechanism of sorts for unauthorized appropriations of culture.\n\nWhen assessing the fairness of an unauthorized appropriation of another’s copyrighted work, courts generally apply a statutorily prescribed four-factor test.[23] Courts must examine the “purpose and character” of the use to determine how compelling the case is for the use in light of copyright’s overarching goal of promoting the “[p]rogress of [s]cience and the useful [a]rts.”[24] Also, courts must consider carefully the “effect” of the appropriation “upon the potential market” for the original work, assessing the economic harms an unauthorized use may inflict on the current copyright owner.[25] Additionally, courts will weigh “the amount and substantiality of the [work] used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole,” sometimes performing a line by line comparison of the original work to the purportedly infringing copy to see precisely how much (quantitatively and qualitatively) has been appropriated.[26]\n\nFinally, courts must also inquire into “the nature of the copyrighted work”—what I call here the “forgotten factor.”[27] While the other factors ask questions such as who is appropriating a work, why they are doing it, how much they are appropriating, and how the appropriation will affect the market for the work, the forgotten factor asks what is being appropriated—its creative or intellectual values—and whether allowing the appropriation would stifle future creativity.[28] Though the forgotten factor’s utility was substantial enough for Congress to include it in the Copyright Act, the factor “has rarely played a significant role in the determination of a fair use dispute,” particularly in isolation from the other fair use factors.[29] This is likely either the consequence of the factor being “only superficially discussed and little understood,”[30] or it may also reflect how courts often construe the factor narrowly as only encompassing two somewhat limited and largely duplicative considerations.[31] Whatever the reason, the factor has been all but erased from the fair use analysis in some circuits.\n\nThis Article argues that the forgotten factor has the potential to play a pivotal role in providing more robust protections to copyrightable Indigenous works in the fair use analysis by requiring fact-finders to consider what a work is from the point of view of the community that creates it. Rather than forgetting this factor, as some courts have done, I propose reclaiming it in a manner consistent with both the fair use doctrine’s ultimate purpose of fostering cultural progress and the need for copyright law to support the production of culture in all its diversity of forms and natures.[32] This entails reconceptualizing the factor’s inquiry into the “nature” of a work as an ontological one, situating the work within its creative context and determining what impact, if any, unauthorized use of the work might have on this kind of creativity going forward. Thus, to help courts better determine whether a particular unauthorized use is “fair,” the inquiry should direct a court to inquire into (1) the creative environment from which the work has been produced and (2) the potential impact of unauthorized appropriation on that creative environment.\n\nSuch a methodological change necessarily involves displacing the current distinctions relied on in most courts’ analyses (“published” vs. “unpublished; “factual” vs. “creative”). As I explain, not only have these distinctions been considerably narrowed by Congress and the courts, they also tend to privilege European-descended cultural forms and their creative-industrial complexes. The hope is that this shift will ultimately protect and catalyze creative growth across a much broader spectrum of cultural economies, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous. At the same time, this is admittedly a small contribution to resolving the overarching problem of cultural appropriation, which should ideally be addressed through congressional consultation with Indigenous and other marginalized peoples and subsequent legislative interventions. But a reclamation of the forgotten factor now should make fair use a more equitable gatekeeping device for unauthorized uses of culture, particularly that of Indigenous peoples.\n\nThis Article proceeds in four parts. In Part I, I examine the current stakes of cultural appropriation for Indigenous peoples, placing cultural appropriation within the broader project of settler-colonialism and Indigenous struggles for cultural sovereignty. In doing so, I highlight through a series of case studies how copyright, despite its current constitutional limitations, might still be helpful for Indigenous peoples seeking to combat cultural appropriation. In Part II, I discuss the fair use doctrine and its gatekeeping function for instances of cultural appropriation. I examine the historical importance of the forgotten factor, showing that this factor, far from being insignificant, played a crucial role in complex cases involving the value of a work within its creative environment. In Part III, I offer a new approach to the forgotten factor that may provide a more robust analysis in instances of cultural appropriation, and apply that factor to the case studies discussed in Part I.\n\nBefore proceeding, a few caveats are in order. First, it goes without saying that cultural appropriation impacts intellectual property interests of many diverse ethnic, racial, religious, and other minority groups.[33] This Article focuses specifically on the ways cultural appropriation affects the creative, social, economic, and political interests of Indigenous peoples, and resists attempting to provide a global solution to all forms of cultural appropriation.[34] Second, this Article focuses on the appropriation of copyrightable cultural products and processes. It does not attempt to resolve the thorny issue of what James O. Young has termed “subject appropriation,” or the appropriation of cultural identities.[35] While copyright’s subject matter encompasses some aspects of an individual’s or group’s personhood or peoplehood,[36] the use of offensive caricatures or stereotypes of racial groups as sports mascots[37] or the names of deceased tribal leaders on products which they would have found repugnant[38] are modes of appropriation that have been more thoroughly debated within the domains of trademark and rights to privacy and publicity. Finally, this Article presumes that copyright law applies, at least to some extent, on Tribal lands—a presumption that is far from certain, and which I leave for future writing.[39] Many tribes maintain and enforce laws, customs, and protocols governing the circulation and reproduction of culture that derive from authorities the United States Constitution cannot reach.[40] Whether Congress’s assumed plenary power over Indigenous peoples could ever extinguish, preempt, or limit the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous peoples to govern the production, use, and circulation of culture remains a deeply contested issue even today.\n\nI. Indigenous Culture and the Legacy of Appropriation\n\nUnauthorized cultural appropriation subsumes a wide variety of activities within its ambit, each involving some sort of transfer or use of something socially valuable to those who, from a particular point of view, should not be entitled to it.[41] Culture remains, for many Indigenous peoples, the very material of their sovereignty. Thus, when copyright fails to adequately protect Indigenous cultural creativity from unauthorized appropriations, it works particular harms on Indigenous peoples, potentially divesting them of their autonomy and self-determination.\n\nThis Section explores the tensions underlying appropriations of Indigenous peoples’ culture. Part I.A acknowledges important arguments in favor of free access to culture[42]—arguments often leveraged against efforts to expand copyright protection to better protect Indigenous cultural creativity. Part I.B reviews recent scholarship that situates appropriations of Indigenous culture historically within the broader context of settler-colonialism in the United States.[43] These scholars point out that as the federal government was actively dispossessing Indigenous peoples of their lives, lands, and resources to provide space for growing settler populations, settlers actively participated in the pillaging, collection, and use of all imaginable forms of Indigenous culture.[44] Part I.C discusses how copyright law’s subject matter has expanded from its origins, offering protection against unauthorized appropriations to increasingly diverse forms of cultural creativity. And yet, copyright law ultimately has excluded many forms of Indigenous culture, relegating them to the public domain and thereby further divesting tribes of their autonomy and self-determination.[45]\n\nImportantly, not all forms of Indigenous culture are excluded from copyright protection. I conclude this Section with three contemporary case studies of appropriations of copyrightable Indigenous culture that tease out the complex intersections of copyright policy and settler-colonialism. These examples are by no means exhaustive of the kinds of copyrightable works Indigenous peoples create, nor does it fully encompass the problems cultural appropriation presents for Indigenous creators. But as each case study turns, at least to some degree, on our normative views of what kinds of culture should or should not be available for appropriation, they provide a valuable entry point for discussing copyright’s fair use doctrine in Parts II and III.\n\nA. Cultural Appropriation as Social Necessity\n\nThe appropriation of culture is a fundamental aspect of human behavior. We all appropriate the culture that surrounds us, whether at home, at school, in our neighborhood, at social events, or in the workplace, to function as individuals within society.[46] As Rosemary Coombe has argued, “[c]ultural categories provide the very possibilities for perception.”[47] We draw on culture throughout our lives to contextualize our own experiences and communicate them to others. The ability to acquire, possess, or control culture is necessary for our personal and collective development and the establishment of our identities.[48] Given that “culture” covers a large swath of each person’s existence, it may be unsurprising that cultural appropriation has become somewhat normalized into the domain of intellectual property, particularly in copyright law.[49]\n\nHaving unrestricted access to “culture,” then, may seem an ideal public policy goal and one that our intellectual property laws should favor.[50] Lawrence Lessig has argued that, historically, the public’s ability to appropriate local culture has never been regulated by government[51]—at least not in European and predominantly European-settler societies. Government regulation, so the argument goes, has rarely encroached on even “ordinary” or “noncommercial” appropriations of mass-mediated commercial culture. For example, quoting an article, making a copy of a TV program for later viewing, and giving a copy of a book you own to a friend all seem to be exempt from government control.[52]\n\nAnd, there may be good reason for this. As Professor Coombe explains, in a society where everyday culture is primarily encountered in commodity form, being able to appropriate or reference texts that make up our “cultural milieu”—YouTube videos, memes, tweets, etc.—enables us to develop a shared reality with others, to generate an individual identity, or to transform the social narratives these cultural texts come to represent.[53] In a “world of extraordinarily diverse creativity that can be easily and broadly shared” via digital means, limitations on the freedom to appropriate culture are often seen as censorship and, potentially, the loss of “an extraordinary amount of creativity [which] will either never be exercised, or never be exercised in the open.”[54]\n\nB. When Cultural Appropriation Harms\n\nWhile some amount of cultural appropriation is necessary for individuals to develop within their particular social contexts, the unauthorized taking of Indigenous culture involves something more, particularly within the context of settler-colonialism.[55] As I explain in this Section, the processes by which the United States and its European predecessors took control of the lands and resources of Indigenous peoples drew upon the mass appropriation of tangible and intangible Indigenous culture. This was both to inform strategies and policies of conquest and to generate legitimizing narratives about the new settler-state.[56] Paradoxically, while Indigenous culture became the target of destructive and assimilative federal policies,[57] American settlers took up Indigenous culture as a freely available resource from which the new American nation could draw for its identity.[58]\n\nThe historical record is replete with examples of unauthorized appropriations from Indigenous cultures by the American public that occurred concurrently with federal policies of conquest, removal, assimilation, and contained self-determination (multiculturalism).[59] Professors Angela Riley and Kristen Carpenter have coined the term “Indian appropriation” to denote categorically the way the U.S. legal system has “facilitated and normalized the taking of all things Indian for others’ use, from lands to sacred objects, and from bodies to identities.”[60] Indeed, the history of federal Indian policy taken as a whole reveals a process of consuming or repurposing nearly every aspect of Indigenous existence: the killing of Indigenous peoples and the mutilation of their bodies for bounties or scientific research; the acquisition of Tribal lands and natural resources for foreign settlement, often without consent or just compensation; the inhabitation of Indigenous identities, physical appearances and vestments to stimulate settler political or social movements; the taking of ritual objects as national antiquities; the forced removal of children to boarding schools for intellectual, physical, religious, and/or sexual exploitation; the commodification of Indigenous expressions, histories and knowledges into settler intellectual, artistic or other kinds of private property; and, more recently, the re-appropriation of the vehicles used to inflict social harms on Indigenous peoples (stereotypes, racial slurs, narratives of conquest) for political or economic gain.[61] While some might view the unauthorized incorporation of Indigenous culture into mainstream American life as a step forward—making American society more “diverse,” “open” or “inclusive,”—cultural appropriation from Indigenous peoples without their free, prior, and informed consent can only be described as a continuation of the dispossessive work of settler-colonialism.[62]\n\nIn addition to furthering the dispossession of Indigenous lands and resources, unauthorized appropriations of Indigenous cultures have had a tendency to compound psychological, social, and political harms already experienced by Indigenous peoples. Failure to combat unauthorized appropriations risks perpetually inflicting these harms on current and future generations. As Professors Riley and Carpenter explain, cultural appropriation has long-term effects on Indigenous peoples individually and collectively:\n\nIndian appropriation . . . has deep and long-lasting impacts, with injuries ranging from humiliation and embarrassment to violence and discrimination. [Collectively], it makes it difficult for tribes to foster religions, economies, and governance systems that reflect tribal values. All of these experiences diminish both tribal sovereignty and impede the [now] prevailing federal policy of advancing American Indian “self-determination” in socioeconomic, political and cultural life.[63]\n\nPut differently, cultural appropriation has the potential to destroy Indigenous peoples’ political and territorial sovereignty. The ability to perform unique artistic, religious, or social practices is often what makes Indigenous communities culturally distinct. Cultural difference has in turn historically justified the recognition of Indigenous groups as independent sovereigns.[64] Still, while ownership of and control over a specialized expressive culture is clearly important to many Indigenous peoples today, both for cultural continuity and differentiation as independent political groups,[65] protecting Indigenous culture from unauthorized appropriation or misuse can be justified through more than just difference-based identity politics.[66]\n\nAs Rebecca Tsosie and Wallace Coffey have argued, Indigenous culture may itself be generative of sovereignty.[67] Indigenous peoples often draw from existing social structures and orders, relationships between members of a community, and understandings of shared belief systems rather than deferring solely to documents as a source of sovereign power.[68] Ceremonies continually reproduce and replenish social relationships and establish authorities; traditional and non-traditional modes of performance become spaces for political discourse; recitations of oral histories in all their many forms lay out precedents, adjudicative principles, and community norms. Creativity and expressive modes of safeguarding memory often generate authority within Indigenous communities, as they help produce and maintain the material that fuels Indigenous peoples’ autonomy and self-determination.[69] To the extent that the kinds of Indigenous creative works just mentioned fall under the umbrella of “culture,” Indigenous sovereignty is, as Professors Tsosie and Coffey explain, perhaps best characterized as a “cultural sovereignty.”[70]\n\nThus, telling Indigenous peoples’ stories for them, singing their songs, and publishing their oral histories without permission diminishes Indigenous sovereignty, just as the dispossession of Indigenous lands and assimilation of Indigenous peoples into the settler-state diminished that sovereignty.[71] When all Indigenous peoples have left is their culture—when political autonomy has been destroyed, rights to land and resources diminished or taken outright, the right to practice Indigenous religions all but extinguished—the last place where Indigenous peoples can be sovereign and experience the real nature of their culture is through modes of expression. Those modes embrace shared symbols, stories, songs, performed social norms, and ways of relating with one another.[72]\n\nUnless Indigenous peoples are able to control the production of their cultures, the possibility for continuing Indigenous sovereignty appears bleak. Counterfeits, parodies, state and corporate narratives, anthropological accounts, National Geographic photo essays, natural history museum exhibits, and History Channel documentaries begin to define what Indigenous sovereignty is or can be. Appropriators transform the material of sovereignty into aesthetic or historical objects or “style[s],”[73]—products to be owned rather than aspects of autonomous modes of existence. American settler-colonization historically deprived Indigenous peoples of their lives, lands, and resources, and then unilaterally transformed them into United States citizens.[74] However, the conversion of the substance of Indigenous sovereignty into various types of settler property, each with their own peculiar limitations, is a form of conquest that seems remarkably out of place in the twenty-first century.[75]\n\nC. Copyright and Indigenous Culture\n\nCopyright exists to promote cultural production,[76] regardless of the social group that creates it. As American society has grown and evolved over time, copyright has historically crept in to regulate the production and circulation of culture by granting exclusive rights to creators for the original works they produce.[77]\n\nConsider the way the subject matter of copyright has expanded in step with changes in the ways Americans have defined culture. As professor Raymond Williams points out in his history of the term, culture at the time of the founding meant a “general process of ‘inner’ [intellectual, spiritual, and aesthetic] development,” one that had become nearly synonymous with term civilization (i.e., being “cultured”).[78] But, with the rise of the industrial revolution and public dissatisfaction with the changes it wrought on society, culture acquired a second definition, signifying a “set of higher standards” or intangible ideals often embodied in art, music, and literature, that pointed out civilization’s weaknesses.[79] In parallel, the original Copyright Act of 1790, passed by the first Congress, was narrow in its scope and protected only books, maps, and charts[80]—objects reflective of the new country’s cultural priorities, such as intellectual cultivation, political discourse, and Enlightenment science.[81] But, over the course of the nineteenth century, Congress added to the Act the “arts of designing, engraving, and etching” in 1802,[82] followed by musical compositions in 1831,[83] and plays and other dramatic works in 1856.[84] These expansions no doubt reflected the public’s new priorities as American culture developed in response to growing industrialization.[85]\n\nToward the turn of the twentieth century, growing resistance to a universal, European‑descended “high culture” ultimately produced a third definition of “culture”: “the way of life . . . of a people.”[86] Scholars in the emerging social sciences began to focus on comparing and taxonomizing cultures in other parts of the world, at times defining some as primitive or ancient and others as modern.[87] With the diversity of cultural creativity happening in the United States by the beginning of twentieth century, American copyright law likewise evolved to cultivate much more than European-descended forms of “high culture.”[88] In Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Company, the Court considered whether a set of circus posters could be considered copyrightable. Writing for the majority, Justice Holmes opined that works of “little merit or of humble degree” and those “addressed to the less educated classes,” at least from the point of view of elite judges, were eligible for protection under the copyright law.[89] He rejected the notion that copyright protects only the cultural creativity of certain social groups:\n\n[I]f [the posters] command the interest of any public, they have a commercial value,—it would be bold to say that they have not an aesthetic and educational value,—and the taste of any public is not to be treated with contempt. It is an ultimate fact for the moment, whatever may be our hopes for a change.[90]\n\nAccording to Justice Holmes, advertisements—such as those depicting the creative work of Barnum and Bailey—should be protected under the same rationale as the “fine art” of Goya, Manet or Degas.[91] Effectively, copyright provided a means for “any public” to develop and protect its creative interests, regardless of whether its “tastes” or forms of expression conflicted with the “hopes” of the “higher classes” for society’s overall “civilization.” Thus, by the turn of the twentieth century, the scope of copyright had grown to include the creative products of any cultural group, as long as those products met the minimum constitutional requirement of being a “writing” of an “author.”[92]\n\nBut, while Justice Holmes’s broadly inclusive view of the nature of copyrightable works rejected any explicit distinction between various forms of culture, over the twentieth century Congress and the courts have perpetuated and developed limitations on the subject matter of copyright. These limitations have left Indigenous peoples’ and other marginalized groups’ cultural creativity significantly under-protected in comparison to other forms of culture.[93]\n\nCommentators have generally located the source of the Copyright Act’s unequal treatment of Indigenous creative works in the three requirements for copyrightability that Congress and the courts have inferred from the Constitution.[94] First, copyright requires that all works be “written” or otherwise “fixed in any tangible medium of expression” to qualify for protection against unauthorized appropriation.[95] As many Indigenous creative works historically have not been written or recorded in physical objects, but instead have been retained in collective memory—such as songs, oral histories, stories, and dances—the fixation requirement may render these works ineligible for copyright protection.[96] Second, copyright’s authorship requirement requires that all works be “original,”[97] meaning a work owes its origin to one or more authors[98] and is sufficiently creative to qualify as a “work of authorship.”[99] Thus, a ceremonial song or ritual object that has been faithfully performed or exactly replicated since time immemorial likely does not qualify for copyright protection, nor will one that does not have human origins.[100] Finally, copyright protection does not extend to “any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery,” regardless of the form it takes; it protects only “expression.”[101] Often, Indigenous peoples value cultural products precisely for the histories, processes, or principles they contain. When they attempt to protect those aspects of creative works from unauthorized appropriation, they unfortunately find that copyright law explicitly makes these aspects of a creative work freely available to the public. Thus, owing to these three threshold requirements, many forms of Indigenous culture may be considered, at least from the perspective of U.S. copyright law, to be in the public domain and can be readily appropriated without permission.[102]\n\nBut even with the burden these requirements place on Indigenous creators, a large amount of Indigenous cultural material is currently eligible for copyright protection. Indeed, in the following subpart, I explore three examples of copyrightable Indigenous creativity. And yet, while these works likely qualify for copyright protection, the fair use doctrine and other limitations on a copyright holder’s rights as currently interpreted may allow for their unauthorized appropriation.\n\nD. Appropriating Copyrightable Indigenous Culture: Three Case Studies\n\nTo evaluate how copyright law operates in instances of cultural appropriation, I explore three paradigmatic examples of Indigenous cultural works that are currently being used without permission. These case studies provide concrete examples of Indigenous cultural expressions that likely qualify for copyright protection. But they also show how easily non-Indigenous appropriators can disregard that protection.\n\nFurther, these cases point out just how difficult it is to generalize about the harms cultural appropriations cause. Often, the harms stemming from cultural appropriations depend on the nature of the culture in question, including the relationships and creative networks that support, develop, and produce it. As Bethany Yellowtail, a prominent Indigenous fashion designer recently explained, “It’s so complicated trying to explain cultural appropriation because people are like, oh it doesn’t matter, get over it. But I’m not going to get over it, this affects my family.”[103] Given this complexity, I argue in Part III that analyses of copyright infringements involving cultural appropriations should include a more contextualized look into the nature of the culture in question and the impacts on the kinds of relations and environments that generate it and are affected by it.\n\n1. Educational Experimentation: Boy Scout Indigeneity\n\nThe borrowing of Indigenous ceremonial culture for seemingly “educational” purposes is a perpetually common mode of cultural appropriation from Indigenous communities. For example, The Boy Scouts of America operates a number of youth programs, including the Venturing program for fourteen- to twenty-year-olds, which engage youth (organized into local Venture “Crews”) in long-term team projects through which they develop life skills and personal ethics. Remarkably, a number of non-Indigenous Venture Crews focus on performing powwow, a form of Native American ceremonial and social dance, as their site of self-development.[104] Crews craft regalia, learn dance steps, and perform at public powwows.[105]\n\nOver the course of anthropological fieldwork exploring Boy Scout appropriations,[106] I learned that unauthorized uses of powwow culture are widespread and take a variety of forms.[107] At one lodge I visited, nearly every Tuesday night, Venture Crew participants would sit at long wooden tables covered with sewing machines; hot clothing irons; white, black, red, and yellow feathers and ribbons; and images they had copied from the Internet.[108] Each Crew member worked for several hours at a time carefully creating their regalia for the next powwow. In preparation for their handiwork and performances, the Crew members I met dedicated their time to researching the history of American colonization and its devastating effects on Native American communities. But, they also spent considerable time researching and copying the themes, designs, and artworks of Indigenous and non-Indigenous creators they found in articles, on websites, and through various image searches, many of which they then incorporated into their own powwow regalia.\n\nCrew members were keenly aware that some in the Indigenous communities in which they performed found their appropriations of Indigenous culture—including appropriations of at least some copyrightable pictorial or graphic works—deeply offensive. Beadwork, ornaments, and other conceptually separable designs affixed to or embedded in powwow regalia are often newly created, original, and fixed in the regalia by the dancer that wears them, likely qualifying them for copyright protection.[109] These works typically carry significant personal meaning for the dancer, not to mention they provide an important space for creativity within this vibrant cultural form. Nonetheless, many of the scouts and their leaders I spoke with pointed to powwow’s history of inclusion, community-building and sharing, and their own desires to respectfully support their local Indigenous community, as justifications for their assumption of powwow culture.\n\nOver the course of my fieldwork, I also had the opportunity to speak with members of the Native American communities alongside whom the Boy Scouts danced. These communities took a variety of positions on the Boy Scouts’ appropriations of powwow culture. Some vehemently opposed it, while others welcomed the Scouts openly.[110] Most erred on the side of hesitant inclusion while acknowledging that these Scouts held the kind of privilege that made it possible for non-Indigenous suburban teenagers to “play Indian”[111] at regional powwows, including those hosted by the federally funded National Museum of the American Indian.[112]\n\nBoy Scout appropriations of Native American powwow culture, then, may involve the unauthorized use of copyrightable materials owned by Indigenous artists and their fellow powwow participants. While these uses are offensive to some in the Native American community and less concerning to others, whether they give rise to a legally enforceable copyright infringement claim will likely depend on whether these Boy Scout appropriations fall within copyright’s fair use exception.\n\n2. Commodifying the Exotic: The Music Hunter\n\nThe unauthorized reproduction and distribution of Indigenous culture as an exotic commodity is a second paradigmatic form of cultural appropriation.[113] For example, Laura Boulton, the self-proclaimed “music hunter,”[114] collected a vast number of ceremonial songs from Indigenous peoples around the world from the 1920s until the late-1960s.[115] In 1929, she traveled to Africa together with her soon-to-be ex-husband, an ornithologist, to record Indigenous songs that she would later play for paying audiences as she traveled the public lecture circuit in the United States.[116] In 1933, she then traveled to Chicago to record Indigenous peoples hired to inhabit a troubling exhibit entitled “The Indian Villages” at the A Century of Progress exposition. This was a world’s fair of sorts displaying the most advanced American technological innovations of the day purposefully juxtaposed against exhibits of traditionally dressed, living citizens of Native American Tribes.[117] Seven years later, she traveled to the Southwestern United States to collect additional Indigenous songs from several Tribes[118] and then proceeded to record Indigenous peoples in Central America, Canada, Alaska, and several locations in Asia.[119] Altogether, she collected roughly 30,000 song recordings.[120]\n\nOver her career, Boulton assembled numerous albums of these Indigenous song performances, which she then licensed to two commercial labels, Victor Records and Folkways Recordings.[121] These labels sold thousands of copies of Boulton’s albums to the public through 1986, after which the Smithsonian Institution purchased Folkways records and continued to produce its catalog.[122] Boulton sold the rights to her remaining recordings to Columbia University as part of a $400,000 deal between the University and a wealthy octogenarian suitor.[123] Boulton’s recordings remain the primary research collection for Columbia’s Center for Ethnomusicology,[124] while Smithsonian-Folkways continues to sell or license Boulton’s albums of Indigenous songs through physical sales, digital downloads, and streaming.[125]\n\nHistorical evidence in Boulton’s papers suggests that she was an astute negotiator and understood copyright law at far more than a cursory level.[126] Yet, she, together with her labels, apparently managed to create tens of thousands of copies of Indigenous music without ever obtaining a copyright assignment or license from her Indigenous informants.[127] Such a transfer, explicit or implied, would have been necessary under the common-law rule of the day for her to reproduce and publish the recordings unilaterally. That is because sound recording copyrights—at least for the recordings made in the United States— generally vested in performers rather than recordists.[128] Boulton likely knew that at least some of the recordings she made were of original compositions, and that the sound recordings of her Indigenous informants’ musical performances were copyrightable.[129] She also likely knew that some of her recordings were subject to special Tribal protocols or local laws governing their circulation and performance, and in at least one documented instance she agreed to uphold those protocols.[130]\n\nBoulton’s unauthorized use of her Indigenous informants’ copyrightable musical works and sound recordings, and the Smithsonian’s continued sale of these recordings, demonstrates either a doubtful ignorance or a complete disregard for the intellectual property rights and local protocols of these Indigenous peoples. But whether it amounts to copyright infringement likely depends on whether her use of the recordings falls within the contours of copyright’s fair use doctrine.\n\n3. Indigenous Renaissance: Reclaiming Ancestral Voices\n\nFinally, consider a contrasting, contemporary example of Indigenous artists who are actively re-appropriating their ancestors’ cultural works, sometimes against the copyright interests of non-Indigenous individuals and institutions who own them. One of the most prominent examples of this Indigenous renaissance is First Nations artist Jeremy Dutcher,[131] who recently won the prestigious Polaris Prize for best Canadian music album of the year, based on artistic merit.[132] The album, titled Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa, showcases Dutcher singing his original compositions that reinterpret and reincorporate traditional Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) songs recorded by William Mechling, an anthropologist who visited the Wolastok First Nations in the early 1900s. Dutcher, who is Wolastoqiyik from the Tobique First Nation in present-day New Brunswick, traveled to the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec, after being directed by an elder in his community to learn more about his community’s songs held in the Museum’s archives.[133]\n\nDutcher’s reanimation of the Mechling recordings is a striking manifestation of contemporary Maliseet culture. Dutcher, an operatic tenor and classical composer by training, spent nearly five years transcribing and internalizing the recordings in preparation for the album—a creative process he refers to as “deep listening.”[134] Meanwhile, Dutcher consulted with his Tobique First Nation community about the meaning of the songs, the language used, and his intended uses of the song recordings.[135] Dutcher’s use of the recordings included copying and deriving new works from the musical material contained in them and directly sampling excerpts from the recordings in his album and live performances.\n\nThe resulting work is impressive. Dutcher elongates and develops the sweeping melodies contained in the recordings, layering in powerful chord progressions that help generate new tension and drama. The looped samples from the Mechling recordings help to create a sung dialog between Dutcher and his ancestors as they sing in canonic counterpoint in the Wolastoqiyik language .[136] The piece demonstrates, in an emotional and powerful way, cultural continuity across the intervening decades in which the Canadian government suppressed and criminalized performances of Indigenous culture.[137]\n\nI draw on Dutcher’s work because it represents an increasingly common and important mode of Indigenous cultural creativity happening across North America and around the globe. This mode of creativity involves the re-appropriation and creative development of previously captured Indigenous culture in deliberate and decolonizing ways.[138] These appropriations often explicitly copy and derive new works from documentary works owned by non-Indigenous collectors or the institutions for whom they worked, and thus may constitute copyright infringement, unless copyright law provides a viable exception.[139]\n\nWhile cultural appropriations may be necessary for normal human development and the progress of creativity generally, unauthorized appropriations of Indigenous culture carry the prospect of causing significant harm through further dispossession of critical aspects of Indigenous lives. While some Indigenous works do not qualify for copyright protection, many do, such as those at issue in the case studies just discussed. In some cases, copyrighted Indigenous works are owned by Indigenous peoples themselves, who seek to defend them from unauthorized use by non-Indigenous appropriators. In others, non-Indigenous individuals or institutions hold the copyrights with Indigenous artists and traditional practitioners seeking to use them without permission. As these and other Indigenous works are appropriated, questions remain as to whether copyright law can effectively balance the public benefits of those appropriations against the interests of the copyright owners.\n\nII. Fair Use’s Forgotten Factor\n\nGiven that many Indigenous works are copyrightable, Indigenous peoples should be able to rely on copyright infringement claims as a means of defending their creative works against cultural appropriations. Importantly, however, not all unauthorized uses of a copyrighted work constitute infringement. Copyright is a porous form of protection, allowing unauthorized uses of a creative work under certain exceptions.[140] Foremost among these is copyright law’s fair use doctrine.[141]\n\nNow codified in 17 U.S.C. § 107, the fair use doctrine is a “flexible,” “equitable rule of reason” that permits the unauthorized use of a copyrightable work when four factors, applied variably depending on context, lead a court to believe that the public interest in the specific use outweighs the copyright holder’s interest.[142] In practice, fair use prevents culture from being completely “locked up” for follow-on creators.[143] But, in doing so, it also weakens cultural creators’ ability to control uses of their expressions by others, allowing others to exploit the culture they create for certain publicly beneficial purposes. In its role of balancing the public’s interest in creative progress against the rights of copyright holders, fair use acts as a gatekeeping mechanism for cultural appropriations. Whether copyrightable Indigenous creativity can be protected against appropriation may turn on how a court balances the statutory fair use factors.\n\nThis Section provides an overview and history of the fair use factor test, focusing specifically on a critical part of the test for cases involving cultural appropriation. Part II.A gives a brief overview of the four statutory factors.[144] It shows why the second fair-use factor—the “nature of the copyrighted work”—is of particular importance to Indigenous creators seeking to defend their cultural works from appropriation. As the second factor has rarely played a significant role in copyright cases since its codification in 1976, Part II.B reviews the common-law development of the second factor to recover its underlying purposes, its early role helping judges understand the nature and value of a work, and the reasons behind its seeming demise. Part II.C discusses the codification of the second factor and its apparent import to Congress at the time. Part II.D explains how the factor’s scope narrowed through subsequent interpretations by the Supreme Court. Part II.E then shows why the current second factor test fails to adequately assess the nature of certain forms of cultural creativity. This Part sets the stage for the factor’s proposed rehabilitation in Part III.\n\nA. The Fair Use Doctrine, In Brief\n\nA copyright holder generally has the right to prevent others from reproducing, making derivative works from, distributing, publicly performing or displaying, or (if the work is a sound recording) digitally transmitting a work she owns.[145] But the right is limited. Fair use is among the devices courts and Congress have developed to temper a copyright owner’s rights. It allows members of the public to use copyrighted material without the owner’s permission when the benefits of the use to the public outweigh the private benefits to the copyright holder. Ad hoc fair use assessments are part of everyday life in many fields: activities like news reporting, criticism, academic research, classroom teaching, and similar uses would be difficult or impossible without the doctrine of fair use.\n\nBut finding a balance between the public’s interest in access to culture and the private rights of authors who produce it has been elusive. Not long after the first Copyright Act became law in 1790, American courts borrowed and further developed the common law doctrine we know today as fair use.[146] In 1976, Congress codified its understanding of the fair use doctrine in a fact‑seeking four-factor test.[147] The test is not a checklist, but a balancing test, with each of the factors weighed together to determine whether an unauthorized appropriation of a copyrighted work is an infringement of the copyright owner’s rights, or a use permitted by law.\n\nCourts typically focus most of their analysis on the first, fourth, and third factors, respectively.[148] The first of the four fair use factors, “the purpose and character of the use,” seems to be the most influential, as it assesses how compelling an unauthorized use may be.[149] It raises questions such as whether the use of the work is transformative in a way that advances the goals of copyright law,[150] whether the sole purpose for the use is commercial exploitation without a public benefit,[151] and whether the use of the work serves non-profit educational purposes.[152] The fourth factor, “the effect of the use upon the potential market or value of the copyrighted work,” is also highly influential.[153] It addresses the potential changes in economic value an unauthorized use would impose on the current copyright owner[154] and whether the use will preempt future authorized uses of the work,[155] and compares these to the public benefits of the use of the work.[156] The third factor, “the amount and substantiality of the portion used [without permission] in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole,” may also play a significant role, particularly when the copied proportion of the work seems excessive in comparison to any publicly beneficial use being claimed,[157] or when the unauthorized use captures the “heart” of the original work.[158]\n\nFinally, courts give surprisingly little attention—that is typically only a few sentences—to the second factor, or “the nature of the copyrighted work.”[159] This is remarkable, considering that analysis of the nature of the work being appropriated seems to have played a vital role from the earliest American fair use cases through fair use’s codification in 1976.[160] For many Indigenous cultural works, such as the ones discussed in Part I, their nature should play a significant role in determining whether or not their unauthorized appropriation can be justified. For example, the unauthorized use of an Indigenous song might be treated differently if it is sacred or ceremonial, like a Diné blessingway song, than if it is a popular Navajo country song meant to circulate in the local or global entertainment economy.[161] While lower courts have struggled to find a meaningful use for this factor in recent years, understanding its historical development and the variety of purposes it has served may prove insightful for those seeking to understand when unauthorized uses of Indigenous culture, or Indigenous re-appropriations of their culture owned by others, is “fair.” [162]\n\nB. The Common-Law Development of the Second Fair Use Factor\n\nThe Supreme Court locates the origins of the contemporary fair use doctrine in the mid-nineteenth century case Folsom v. Marsh, which “distilled the essence of law and methodology” of prior English common law rules to the four-part fair use framework we have today.[163] Admittedly, few cases prior to the codification of the fair use factor test in 1976 cited Folsom as supplying the scope and methodology for the fair use analysis.[164] Indeed, some commentators have gone so far as to reject Folsom as creating ‘fair use” in American copyright law, arguing instead that it represents a “redefinition” of copyright infringement itself.[165]\n\nStill, this subpart takes the Supreme Court at its word and performs a close reading of Folsom to flesh out what the essence of the second fair use factor might be. Then, it proceeds to track the factor’s common-law development through its codification in the 1976 Copyright Revision Act. Finally, this subpart gives an overview of the ways the second fair use factor has been interpreted in more recent cases through its recent demise in some federal circuit courts of appeal.\n\n1. Folsom v. Marsh\n\nThe Copyright Act’s second fair use factor traces its roots to the American common law doctrine, whose factors were first articulated by Justice Story in his 1841 opinion in Folsom v. Marsh.[166] The Folsom litigation came about when Jared Sparks and Charles Folsom, publishers of a twelve-volume set of George Washington’s papers,[167] brought a copyright infringement action[168] against Rev. Charles W. Upham and his publisher for allegedly duplicating a few hundred pages from the set in their much shorter, two-volume biography of Washington made for school libraries.[169] A fair use defense was never raised in the litigation.[170] However, the court in Folsom established what the Supreme Court later referred to as the doctrine of fair use, an exception to a copyright holder’s exclusive rights justified by copyright law’s overriding purpose of supporting cultural and intellectual development.[171]\n\nA core challenge Justice Story faced in this case was deciding how to assess the nature of George Washington’s letters, memos, and other documents, and then determining whether their nature made them more or less susceptible to Upham’s educational but unauthorized use. Given the “peculiar nature and character” of the issues presented in the case, Justice Story famously penned:\n\nit is not . . . easy to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion, or to lay down any general principles applicable to all cases. Patents and copyrights approach, nearer than any other class of cases . . . to what may be called the metaphysics of the law. . . .[172]\n\nThough clearly laced with humor, Justice Story’s preoccupations over the ontological complexities at the core of copyright law certainly linger today as courts seek to understand the proper scope of the fair use analysis.\n\nJustice Story explained that the test for whether an unauthorized but educational use infringes another’s copyright turns on “the nature and objects of the selections made [by the unauthorized user], the quantity and value of the materials used, and the degree in which the use may prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or supersede the objects, of the original work.”[173] As he applied this framework to Upham’s unauthorized use of Sparks’s documents, Justice Story articulated each of the four contemporary fair use factors. To start, Justice Story suggested that the purpose and character of Upham’s copying from Sparks’s volume for use in school libraries would be, in the absence of the other factors, a “lawful and justifiable use.”[174] But, the amount and substantiality of the work copied by Upham, in proportion to his work as a whole, outweighed that educational purpose. [175] The copied material amounted to more than one third of Upham’s work and unabashedly copied the documents “of most interest and value to the public.” [176] According to Justice Story, those key documents incorporated into Upham’s secondary work the “essential value” of the original.[177] And, having copied the most important parts of Sparks’s work, the resulting effect on the market for the original work would be that “the plaintiff’s copyright be totally destroyed.”[178]\n\nIn addition to these considerations, Justice Story’s analysis of the nature of the copyrighted work, or the second fair use factor, was also key to the outcome of the case.[179] The Folsom opinion instructs that whether an unauthorized appropriation of another’s work is justifiable hinges on “not only quantity, but value” being appropriated: the “nature . . . of the selections made,” the “value of the materials used,” and “the degree in which the use may . . . supersede the objects, of the original work.”[180]\n\nFor Justice Story, the analysis of the nature of the work involved the relationships George Washington had to the documents he produced and to the publics who would ultimately use and value them. Justice Story suggested that Washington’s letters were, to some degree, an extension of his persona and genius; they “illustrat[ed] the life, the acts, and the character of Washington,” and were thus as singular as he was.[181] But while they “show[ed] his style and his mode of constructing sentences, and his habits of composition,”[182] they perhaps more importantly demonstrated Washington’s contributions to American culture and the intellectual networks of which he was a part.[183] Thus, in assessing the “nature” and the “value” of the material copied, Justice Story took into account the relationship of the papers to their creator and their value to the creative sphere in which the papers circulated.\n\nImportantly, the nature of Washington’s papers—at least for the purpose of evaluating the justness of their unauthorized appropriation—had little to do with whether he intended for them to be published or even valued as “literary compositions.”[184] Washington likely knew at the time he authored each document that he had generated something of expressive and intellectual value for those to whom the documents would circulate. Also, he continued to value them even after they had served their original, information-conveying function. As the court explained, their preservation and bequest by Washington demonstrated their nature as “a subject of value to himself and to his posterity.”[185] Thus, even in the nascent stages of fair use in the United States, the nature of a work being copied—its mode of production, its relationships to existing intellectual and cultural networks, and its value to those networks—were key sites of inquiry for adjudicating the justness of an unauthorized use against the rights of the copyright holder. At the same time, the Folsom Court rejected methods for understanding the “nature” of a work which fixated on the work’s publication potential or level of creativity.\n\nNot all would agree with this reading of Folsom and the importance of the nature inquiry to the fair use analysis. Some commentators have taken particular issue with the way Justice Story accounts for the value of a creative work to the author. Professor Patterson, for example, argues that such a move incorporated into federal copyright law the notion that works could receive protection simply because the author exerted effort to create them and not because a copyright was needed to encourage their dissemination.[186] A copyright system premised on granting property rights to reward an author’s labor was not the intention of the drafters of the Intellectual Property Clause, who were more concerned with maintaining a robust public domain free of censorship.[187]\n\nBut Justice Story’s inclusion of the nature of a work, and its value to the author and her creative networks, need not be read as only according undue private property interests to authors on account of their labor. Rather, exploring the nature of a work in the manner articulated by Justice Story in the fair use analysis may usefully show how a given unauthorized appropriation impedes creative progress.[188] It might highlight, for example, the way unauthorized appropriation stifles the incentives to create and disseminate cultural expression. Or it may reveal how an appropriation violates protocols and norms necessary for creative production in some communities. As I explore in Part III, these concerns are particularly salient to Indigenous peoples and their cultural creativity, and they must be accounted for in the fair use analysis if copyright law is to promote the progress of science and the useful arts in all their diversity of forms and natures.\n\nHowever legitimate Justice Story’s underlying theory may have been from our contemporary vantage point, it is clear that the second fair use factor as originally articulated in Folsom included an analysis of how authors and the networks within which they operate understand and value the work they create.\n\n2. Subsequent Common-Law Development\n\nIt took well over a century after Folsom for Congress to codify the doctrine of fair use as we know it today. Still, as Professor Reese points out, fair use was regularly relied on in copyright disputes in the intervening years.[189] During those years, the fair use doctrine entered a period of somewhat erratic development.[190] In fact, in 1961, a Senate subcommittee study identified roughly eight factors that courts had been using to conduct fair use analyses, any of which could be determinative.[191] Thus, it is quite remarkable that, less than a decade later, the House, Senate, and the Federal Court of Claims, citing that same study, were able to reduce the fair use doctrine to the four factors initially introduced by Justice Story.[192]\n\nCourts’ approaches to the “nature of the copyrighted work” factor in the fair use analysis during this time often intersected with other fair use factors. Courts used language like “[the] effect on the original work,” “the nature of the works involved,” or the “relative value” of the appropriated work in relation to the original work to describe their methodology.[193] In some cases, courts would use this factor to compare the function of the original work to the copy to assess the level of actual or potential harm posed by an appropriation—such as whether making unauthorized copies effectively substituted for or competed with the original work or actually reduced demand for it.[194]\n\nAn important line of cases that emerged in the early twentieth century relied on the nature inquiry as a potentially deciding factor. Courts of this era considered some works to be more susceptible to fair uses than others due to the purpose behind their creation, their methods of construction, or the value and importance of the work for future developments within certain creative and intellectual networks. Publications of “the arts and sciences,” for example—works circulated “ not only for their own pecuniary profit, but for the advancement of science”—were just the sort of works for which fair use existed.[195] One variant on this logic looked to the “nature of the [copyrighted] materials” to determine “whether their distribution would serve the public interest in the free dissemination of information and whether their preparation requires some use of prior materials dealing with the same subject matter.”[196] These courts examined how the particular appropriation at issue would either hamper or further the kinds of relations and modes of intellectual production that existed within a particular creative field. For example, in a case involving the unauthorized appropriation of biographical writing on Howard Hughes, the court looked at what was “reasonable and customary” among biographers to determine the appropriation’s fairness, noting that it was common for biographers “to refer to and utilize earlier works dealing with the subject of the work and occasionally to quote directly from such works.”[197] Other courts relied on the nature of the work to suggest that if an appropriation actually furthered the goals of the original work’s authors, it would tend to favor fair use.[198]\n\nDespite its marginalized status in fair use cases today, the “nature” of a copyrighted work played a significant role in the fair use analysis at common law. Courts looked to this factor to reveal formal differences between an original work and unauthorized copies, to discuss the necessity of freely disseminating the work to serve public purposes, and as a support for the other fair use factors. But its evolution certainly did not diminish its importance. Indeed, these cases show that inquiring into the aesthetic form of a creative work and its function and intellectual value within its creative networks remained integral to the nature inquiry.\n\nC. Codification of the Second Fair Use Factor\n\nThere is relatively little written about why Congress ultimately included the “nature of the copyrighted work” in the fair use provision of the 1976 Copyright Revision Act. And yet, the available House and Senate subcommittee reports suggest that Congress found this factor to be integral to the fair use doctrine at the time of the Copyright Revision Act’s passage. As I discuss below, these subcommittee reports reveal that Congress intended to maintain the fair use framework as it existed at common law while considering technological issues pertinent to the era.\n\nCodifying the fair use doctrine involved decades of complex negotiation. A major overhaul of the copyright law passed in 1909, but Congress could not garner sufficient agreement on the scope of a fair use provision to include one into statutory law.[199] From the 1920s to the 1940s, numerous fair use amendment bills were introduced but were never passed.[200] Ultimately, the Supreme Court’s 4-4 split over the fairness of the National Institutes of Health’s unauthorized photocopying of medical journal articles appears to have increased the urgency of codifying the fair use doctrine.[201]\n\nFor roughly a decade, the House and Senate subcommittees debated what factors, if any, should be included in the new fair use provision. In early versions of the 1976 Copyright Revision Act, the House of Representatives inserted a much more abbreviated fair use provision, containing one straightforward line: “the fair use of a copyrighted work is not an infringement of copyright.”[202] But after receiving significant criticism for its bare-bones approach, Congress instead sought to codify specific factors that could provide both courts and the public a rubric for making everyday decisions about the use of copyrighted works.[203] Instead of developing its own fair use factors based on its contemporary policy priorities, the congressional subcommittees who drafted the provision made clear in their reports that the 1976 Act restated the judicially created principle of fair use while not changing, freezing, narrowing nor enlarging it in any way.[204] Thus, Congress likely presumed that the common law fair use doctrine’s focus on assessing the mode of creation of a work, its function within its creative networks, and its creative or intellectual value to those networks previously undertaken by courts would continue on under the new statute.\n\nWhile asserting that the new fair use provision was merely a restatement of the common law fair use doctrine, the House and Senate subcommittees that drafted the second fair use factor also provided some limited commentary on ways it might be used. The subcommittees explained that the second factor could shed light on both (1) the character of the work being copied and (2) its availability to the public.[205] It is important to note, however, that these comments were made in response to very narrow debates about fair use in the classroom and were unlikely to have been intended as a limitation on what the “nature” factor could embody.[206]\n\nTo elucidate what they meant by the “character” of a work, the subcommittees used an example of a teacher making copies of two different kinds of work for their classroom: “[A] news article from the daily press would be judged differently [under the second factor] from a full orchestral score of a musical composition.”[207] To explain this distinction, the subcommittees posited that “by their nature” musical compositions, dramas, and movies, are “intended for performance or public exhibition,” while newspaper articles contain material that is “of current interest to supplement and update the students’ textbooks.”[208] While concrete, the distinction the subcommittees attempted to draw regarding the nature of these two kinds of works did little to clarify what method or standard, if any, courts were to use for the second factor.[209]\n\nIn addition to the orchestral score vs. newspaper article distinction, the subcommittees provided two other distinctions relevant to assessing the “nature of the copyrighted work.” One distinction looked at the extent to which a copy takes the same form as the original, mirroring the existing common law.[210] Another looked at whether an original work is “out of print,” as this may justify fair use in some cases, unless the author intentionally chose not to publish the work.[211] This distinction has since been subsumed under the fourth factor.[212] Neither of these distinctions shed any additional light on what should be encompassed by the second fair use factor. Thus, perhaps the primary takeaway from a contemporary reading of the legislative history of the 1976 Copyright Revision Act is that, as Robert Kasunic has pointed out, Congress left significant room in its construction and interpretation of the second fair use factor for a host of potential inquiries.[213]\n\nD. Contemporary Interpretations\n\nNotwithstanding the potential Congress left for a broad range of inquiries under the second fair use factor, federal courts have used its analytical power sparingly. This may owe in large part to the way it was first articulated in Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises. The Supreme Court in that case recognized two basic distinctions on which the “nature” of a work might rest: (1) whether the work is published or unpublished, and (2) whether a work is creative (“fictional”) or factual.[214] As I explain below, these distinctions have been significantly narrowed by Congress and lower courts, effectively hollowing out the second factor.\n\nIn Harper & Row, the Court considered whether the news magazine The Nation fairly used Gerald Ford’s then unpublished memoir, A Time to Heal, when it reproduced portions having to do with Ford’s pardon of Richard Nixon in a “scoop” of the book.[215] The courts below had taken distinct approaches in applying the second factor. The Southern District of New York analyzed the nature of Ford’s memoir by looking only to its publication status, noting that the manuscript was soon-to-be-published and, therefore, was generally protected against unauthorized pre-publication uses.[216] On review, the Second Circuit rejected that approach and instead looked to the proportion of factual content contained in the work.[217] Examining the content of Ford’s memoir, the Second Circuit majority noted that because facts are not copyrightable, fact-laden historical works like memoirs are generally accorded thinner copyright protection.[218] Ford’s memoir was thus more susceptible to fair use.[219]\n\nThe Supreme Court seemingly found both the District Court and Second Circuit’s inquiries worthwhile under the second factor, and proceeded to provide further guidance on both.[220] First, the Court explained that the unpublished status of a work was “a critical element of its ‘nature’”[221] and that an author’s interests in “confidentiality and creative control” prior to publication would generally outweigh other fair use considerations.[222] The special treatment of unpublished works in the statutory fair use analysis was necessary because, prior to the Copyright Revision Act, unpublished works had not been protected automatically by federal copyright law.[223] By distinguishing unpublished works from published ones in the fair use analysis, the Court hoped to embed values previously embodied by the common law right of first publication, such as an author’s pre-publication interest in deciding “whether and in what form to release his work.”[224]\n\nFollowing the Court’s adoption of the published-unpublished distinction in Harper & Row, subsequent lower court opinions placed “special emphasis on the unpublished nature” of a work for at least a short period of time, when such work was appropriated without the copyright owner’s permission.[225] But this approach produced a number of anomalies, such as a biographer becoming subject to a copyright infringement suit for drawing quotes from a major literary figure’s papers that had been donated to publicly accessible archive.[226] Shortly after the Harper & Row decision, Congress cast doubt on the published-unpublished distinction when it passed an amendment to the Copyright Act’s fair use provision, clarifying that the unpublished status of a work “shall not itself bar a finding of fair use.”[227] While still material to the second factor analysis, publication status would no longer be a deciding factor in fair use cases.[228]\n\nThe Harper & Row Court’s second distinction, whether the copyrighted material is creative or factual in nature, has survived much longer. In assessing the nature of the Ford memoir, the Supreme Court began by observing that “[t]he law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy.”[229] Still, when analyzing Ford’s work, the Court resisted relying on categorical characterizations like “factual” or “creative.”[230] While it characterized the memoir as “an unpublished historical narrative or autobiography,” the Court’s assessment of the book’s nature focused on the author’s craftsmanship—the “inseparab[ility]” of Ford’s expressions from the facts, his “portraits of public figures”—and the cultural power that craftsmanship conveyed to the audience.[231]\n\nThe Court further refined the factual-nature assessment of the second fair use factor in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music. There, the Court was asked to determine whether the hip-hop group 2 Live Crew’s parody of Roy Orbison’s song, Pretty Woman, qualified as a fair use. [232] The Court framed its inquiry into the “nature” of Pretty Woman as an assessment of how “close[] to the core” of copyright the original work might be.[233] Without providing guidance on its methodology, the Court strung together a list of distinctions it had drawn between different types of works in prior fair use cases: “fictional works,” “soon-to-be-published memoirs,” “motion pictures,” and “creative works,” the Court suggested, would require more compelling support from the other fair use factors than “factual works,” “published speeches,” “news broadcasts,” and “factual compilations” for a claim of fair use by an unauthorized appropriator to be successful. In applying its framework to the case at hand, the Court held simply that Pretty Woman was the kind of expressive work copyright was designed to protect, but that its expressive nature was ultimately of little consequence in an instance of parody—which the Court argued generally requires appropriation from an original, expressive work to carry out its special kind of criticism and commentary.[234] Thus, the second factor analysis adopted by the Court in Campbell at most increases reliance on the other fair use factors, but does little to inform courts about what aspects of the “nature” of a work might foreclose unauthorized uses.\n\nCourts have subsequently reduced considerations over the “need to disseminate factual works” in Harper & Row and the protection of works that are at the “core of” copyright in Campbell to a binary question of whether the appropriated work is “creative” or “factual.”[235] In contemporary practice, courts have been reluctant to permit unauthorized appropriation when a work is more “creative” than “factual.”[236] Still, these cases reveal the inherent subjectivity of the factual-creative distinction as courts often must either exert their own creativity to find a work is non-factual, or simply dismiss the utility of the second factor altogether.[237]\n\nE. Why the Current Distinctions Fail\n\nIt isn’t yet clear why the now-forgotten second factor has failed to develop beyond the published-unpublished and factual-creative distinctions since its codification. It may be that few instances of copyright infringement have been litigated involving works that, by nature, should not be susceptible to unauthorized uses. Whatever the case, as Indigenous and other marginalized groups begin to assert their rights to cultural creativity, the current fair use test will likely be of little benefit to judges who must decide the fairness of complex cultural appropriations.\n\nThe inadequacy of the second factor has already been seen in the case of sacred religious works that have been used without permission. For example, in Religious Technology Center v. Lerma, the district court hearing the case struggled to identify the “nature” of the Church of Scientology’s Advanced Technology documents after the Washington Post claimed in an infringement suit that its copying and proposed publication of the documents was a fair use.[238] The Southern District of California and the Second Circuit had reached opposite conclusions about the nature of the very same works.[239] Ultimately, the court looked to the Church’s understanding contained in its historical records and found the “nature” of the documents to be factual, supporting the Washington Post’s fair use defense.[240]\n\nOther cases have turned out the opposite way. In Worldwide Church of God v. Philadelphia Church of God, one church had appropriated and published a racially intolerant religious book owned by another without the latter’s permission (the church had attempted to use the work’s copyright to keep it out of the public eye). As with Lerma, the District Court in Worldwide Church also struggled with the factual-creative distinction. The court reasoned that the book might appear “‘factual’ by readers who share [the author’s] religious beliefs,” but ultimately held that “the creativity, imagination and originality embodied in [the book] tilt the scale against fair use.”[241] As these cases demonstrate, sacred or spiritual works are often left in appropriation limbo as judges try to figure out their proximity to copyright’s “core” by attempting to compare them to genres that they believe are inherently “factual” or “creative.”[242]\n\nThe ambivalence of the forgoing opinions raises serious doubts that the current second factor analysis could fairly weigh the specific harms appropriation causes to Indigenous creators against the public interest. For example, how would a court classify the expression of a tribe’s origination story by a tribal elder? As more creative or more factual? And which way should such a determination weigh, particularly if Tribal protocols or community norms heavily restrict who can create such expressions and how they circulate? To better address such ambiguities in the case of sacred works, the “nature” inquiry should do much more.\n\nIn his Second Circuit opinion in Author’s Guild, a 2015 case deciding whether Google Books’ “snippets view” feature could be considered a fair use of millions of copyrighted books, Judge Pierre Leval cast significant doubt on the second fair use factor’s continuing relevance, holding that the factual nature of a work “should not imply that others may freely copy it.”[243] Then, in a 2018 opinion he went so far as to say that the second factor is only relevant when considering the first fair use factor’s “transformative use” test[244]—rejecting it as an independent source of analysis. The second fair use factor, at least in the Second Circuit,[245] has been all but written out of the Copyright Act.\n\nAnd yet, the forgotten factor has received renewed prominence in the Supreme Court’s most recent exposition of the fair use doctrine. In Google LLC v. Oracle, Inc., the Court was tasked with determining whether Google’s copying of a portion Oracle’s Java API code was a fair use.[246] The court relied on the second fair use factor to show that the copied code functioned differently than other kinds of computer code within the broader programming environment.[247] Because the code in question was not intended to be innovative, but instead provided programmers a well-known package of commands organized in a familiar way, the Court found it did not merit the same level of protection from unauthorized appropriation afforded to other kinds of code protected by the Copyright Act.[248] Thus, the Court fell back on the factual-creative distinction previously established in Campbell to support its holding that Google’s unauthorized use of Oracle’s code was fair.[249]\n\nWhile Justice Story originally framed the inquiry into the nature of a work as one analyzing the value of a work within its creative or intellectual milieu, subsequent articulations of the factor, including by Congress, have left the factor open to numerous interpretations. And yet, the Supreme Court has in recent years seemingly limited the factor to two narrow distinctions—its publication status and its level of facticity. The result is that the current fair use analysis has little space in its current form to address the unique harms cultural appropriations pose to the creativity of Indigenous and other marginalized communities.\n\nIII. Rehabilitating the Forgotten Factor\n\nIf the purpose of American copyright law is to incentivize production of culture as that term has evolved over time, how might we rehabilitate fair use in a way that accomplishes this goal without enabling the patterns of settler-colonial cultural appropriation identified in Part I within our copyright jurisprudence? As Part II revealed, the portion of the fair use analysis that was supposed to shed light on the impact of appropriation by looking at the particular nature of the work being appropriated has been all but written out of the Copyright Act by some courts or greatly narrowed in others. This is deeply problematic for all creators, but particularly for creators of Indigenous cultural works. In this Section, I propose a rehabilitation of the second fair use factor, reconceptualizing it in a way that gives “nature” its due meaning.\n\nAt the outset, I acknowledge that there may be other ways to reorient the fair use doctrine to combat cultural appropriations without transforming the second factor. Congress did not limit the fair use analysis to just those factors included in the Copyright Act’s section 107.[250] Indeed, Congress left the possibility of adding additional factors open to courts applying the fair use doctrine,[251] and commentators have taken this leeway to propose numerous alternative factors.[252] A new fair use factor that evaluates an unauthorized use of Indigenous culture in terms of its effects on the community that produced it may certainly make fair use more responsive to the interests of Indigenous groups.\n\nBut the underlying problem is not that Indigenous peoples’ (or any other group’s) cultural products are incommensurable with the underlying concept of fair use and, therefore, should be relegated to some alternative universe of analysis. Indigenous peoples, after all, make sculptures, hip hop albums, poetry, building blueprints, and feature films—works that fit easily within copyright’s landscape. Rather, the fundamental problem is that fair use currently fails to account for the ontological diversity of culture being produced in the United States today, instead privileging European-descended cultural forms and their creative environments. Copyright must respond and evolve as it has in the past, even if this means disrupting the settled expectations of our established creative-industrial complexes.\n\nThus, this Section advocates for letting the second factor do the work for which it was historically designed but which it has never fully realized. Part III.A begins by reviewing applicable commentary on the second fair use factor. Part III.B then proposes how the second fair use factor might be rehabilitated to better address the needs of Indigenous peoples. After Part III.C makes some brief notes on how this rehabilitated factor might be implemented, Part III.D concludes by applying it to the case studies discussed in Part I.\n\nScholarly commentary has begun to develop alternative approaches to the second fair use factor. Some advocate for drawing on the second factor to assess the effects of an unauthorized use on creative production.[253] Others suggest using the second fair use factor to inquire about the fair user’s engagement with Indigenous peoples’ laws and protocols.[254] These approaches inform my proposal for a rehabilitated second factor in the following Section.\n\n1. Using “Nature” to Assess Effects on Creative Production\n\nRoughly twenty years before Judge Leval penned the Second Circuit’s Authors Guild opinion, his formulation of the second factor seemed full of analytical possibilities, some of which have yet to be fully explored. At that time, the second factor had been “only superficially discussed and little understood,” and merited much deeper consideration than the bright-line rules regarding publication status and facticity courts adopted post-Harper & Row.[255] In an article extensively cited by the Supreme Court in Campbell,[256] Judge Leval argued that the primary focus of the second factor should be on “protecting the incentives of authorship” including “protect[ing] the reasonable expectations of one who engages in the kinds of creation/authorship that copyright seeks to encourage,”[257] while also providing space for authors to “practice the craft in the privacy of the laboratory” without running the risk of premature critique.[258]\n\nFor Judge Leval, there were two analytical questions the second fair use factor was supposed to help answer. The first was whether the original work “is the type of material that copyright was designed to stimulate,” and the second, whether the unauthorized appropriation of a work “would interfere significantly with the original author’s entitlements.”[259] The type of work was key to his framework, as those works considered to be “creative endeavor[s] for the public edification” should be afforded greater protection from unauthorized uses than those that “are, at best, incidental beneficiaries.”[260] Thus, works “created for publication”—works “of the creative or instructive type that the copyright laws value and seek to foster”—would be more resistant to unauthorized appropriation while shopping lists and personal calendars, for example, could be made more vulnerable.[261] Still, Judge Leval’s framework resisted any bright-line rules: “no category of copyrighted material is either immune from use or completely without protection.”[262]\n\nThough Judge Leval seems to have backed away from a categorical approach to the second fair use factor in his Author’s Guild opinion,[263] his second point of analysis—whether a use might interfere with an original author’s entitlements—may be a point of productive development for the fair use doctrine in cases of cultural appropriation. Building on Judge Leval’s approach, Robert Kasunic suggests that “[o]nce we understand the work and the reasonable and customary expectations of authors for that type of material, we can better understand how various uses might affect the incentive to create such works.”[264] In other words, the “nature” that the second factor is meant to reveal to the fact finder should include the economic drivers for a work—including the networks of publishers, producers, and performers, as well as the funding sources and licensing regimes that incentivized its creation—and the potential harms an unauthorized use may cause to those drivers.[265]\n\nRather than a bright-line rule, this sort of approach seems to suggest two analytical steps. First, a court would examine the creative environment for a work to understand the “reasonable and customary expectations” under which an author created it.[266] Second, a court would analyze how the unauthorized use in question would impact the incentives on which participants within that creative environment rely. The second factor would weigh against fair use when actual or potential harms to the work’s creative environment were found. However, where the creative environments would suffer no harm from unauthorized appropriation—perhaps the environments incentivizing doodles during long meetings, selfies, or text messages—such a fact might weigh in favor of fair use.[267]\n\n2. Using “Nature” to Determine Alignment with Indigenous Protocols\n\nOther commentary on the second fair use factor points to the factor’s unique capacity for incorporating Indigenous customs, norms, and protocols into the fair use analysis. Recent debates in Australia over whether to adopt a fair use doctrine to replace its current doctrine of fair dealing have specifically looked at fair use’s potential impact on Indigenous peoples.[268] In 2013, the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) recommended to the Attorney General of Australia that a fair use provision—with a second factor nearly identical to that found in U.S. copyright law—be incorporated into the Australian copyright act.[269] Importantly, the ALRC’s recommendation was tempered with an overarching proviso that stated “cultural considerations, in particular issues relating to Indigenous culture and cultural practices, need always to be considered, alongside economic rights.”[270] Unlike U.S. copyright law, Australian copyright law affords some explicit protection to Indigenous creativity, owing in part to the 1998 Bulun Bulun opinion from Australia’s high court.[271]\n\nWhile the proposed fair use provision has not yet been adopted in Australia, commentators Natalie Stoianoff and Evana Wright argue that the Australian fair use doctrine’s second factor, if adopted as proposed, may play a key role in ensuring Indigenous peoples’ rights and interests relating to copyrightable culture are respected:\n\nAny fair use exception needs to take into account the special relationship between Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander communities and their cultural production . . . . [T]he application of fair use provisions to use of traditional cultural expressions should be subject to the rights and interests of the relevant Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community.[272]\n\nGiven the ALRC’s proviso, and Australia’s recognition of the copyrightability of some Indigenous cultural expressions, Stoianoff and Wright interpret the second fair use factor as potentially requiring appropriators to consult with Indigenous communities before a use of their cultures can be considered “fair.”[273] Consultation would allow potential fair users (and courts, ex post) to determine what the work is from an Indigenous point of view, and then take the necessary precautions to ensure Indigenous interests are protected.[274] In effect, this interpretation of the second factor would mean fair users likely would have to comply with existing protocols adopted by Indigenous communities prior to making publicly beneficial use of their cultural materials without express permission.\n\nWhile scholarship dedicated to the second fair use factor is sparse, commentators recognize the factor’s continued importance in assessing its potential impact on creative networks and its potential to account for Indigenous protocols governing the creation and circulation of culture.\n\nB. Identifying the “Nature” of Culture\n\nGiven these insights, how should courts shape the forgotten factor going forward, particularly in cases of cultural appropriation from Indigenous peoples? Based on the commentary just discussed, the second factor should at least reveal an unauthorized appropriation’s impact on the specific drivers supporting the particular kind of cultural production at issue.[275] But it should also be grounded in the actual relationships involved in producing cultural creativity—relationships that may be governed by local community protocols and cultural norms. By looking at the “reasonable and customary expectations” of creators within their particular creative networks, a court may be able to assess whether an unauthorized use will disrupt motivation to create similar works.[276]\n\nBut developing a methodology that actually takes stock of how culture is produced and accurately assesses the effects of appropriation on creative production without incorporating cultural bias poses significant challenges. Take, for example, Kasunic’s taxonomic approach to the second factor, which suggests that courts afford greater protection to works that fit within the categories listed in section 102 of the Copyright Act than those that do not. Section 102 provides a non-exhaustive list of creative works that presumably fall within the subject-matter of copyright. However, the list contains predominantly European-descended cultural forms that Congress has periodically expanded to meet industry demands.[277] If we were to apply his proposed framework, unless a cultural form conforms to the characteristics of these cultural categories, the works produced might be at an elevated risk for unauthorized appropriation. In effect, creators of copyrightable Indigenous works (e.g., copyrightable songs, dances, ceremonies, or visual works) would be compelled either to create their works in such a way that they could be read by a court as being part of a European-descended creative tradition, industry, or class, or otherwise face legally sanctioned appropriations going forward. Such a result seemingly would run counter to the broadly inclusive approach to copyright enunciated by Justice Holmes more than a century ago.[278]\n\nAscertaining the “nature of the copyrighted work” for fair use purposes must be more than an exercise in taxonomy. This is because determining the nature of a thing it is not strictly an empirical question or one that can be answered by applying a single standardized metric. Relying on a taxonomy of creative works, like whether a work fits within the categories codified in section 102 or whether a work is “factual” or “creative,” can only give us information about how a work differs from others, not specific information about how a creative work is generated. Rather, framing the “nature” question as an ontological one reveals the position of a thing in relation to others in the world, allowing the fact-finder to examine the work in the context of the creative networks that produce it and depend on it.[279]\n\nFor example, a taxonomic approach might make assumptions about the nature of a work based the work’s features. It might ask questions like: does it seem like a sculpture, a painting, or a musical score based on one’s perception of it?[280] But taxonomies always seem to privilege certain distinctions over others. They depend on the priorities and values of those with power to produce their underlying categories and their units of analysis. At bottom, taxonomies are maps of socially salient differences or distinctions; they actualize the prevailing epistemes in which the taxonomy is created.[281] Thus, they inescapably derive from a particular cultural point of view and moment in history.[282]\n\nA taxonomic approach to the second fair use factor based on section 102 would be especially ill-suited to meet the needs of the increasingly diverse creative environments copyright is meant to serve.[283] Perhaps, at the time of the first Copyright Act in 1790, assessing the “nature” of a creative work by comparing it to European-descended cultural categories might have passed muster as a viable focal point for determining whether a work should or should not be widely appropriated.[284] But, as Folsom and its progeny make clear, the “core of copyright” cannot easily be defined without reference to the networks producing creative works and the intellectual value those networks place on them. [285] Defining the nature of a creative work in terms of set categories that inherently favor European-settler culture seem out of step with the trajectory of copyright law since the early twentieth century.[286] Indeed, Congress codified the second fair use factor in 1976, well after theories of unilinear (European-descended) cultural development had been abandoned and Indigenous cultures and worldviews had been widely recognized as worthy of state recognition.[287]\n\nIf the “nature of the copyrighted work” analysis is not about how comfortably the work fits into our present-day section 102 categories, how do we assess it in a way that helps us know when a work should or should not be available for unauthorized appropriation for a publicly beneficial purpose? Building on Judge Leval’s and Robert Kasunic’s proposals for assessing the creative environment for a work, I argue that the second fair use factor should examine:\n\nthe ontological nature of the work, including the creative environment from which the work is produced, and\n\nthe potential impact of unauthorized appropriation on that creative environment.\n\nAn ontological approach to assessing the nature of a thing would avoid categorical declarations to justify or reject a fair use claim, and instead examine the relations surrounding the original work in question. First, this approach would take stock of its inputs and mode of production, such as remixing existing cultural materials, adding new content to current cultural forms, or synthesizing abstract artistic motifs. Also, it would consider how the work functions within its creative networks and ask whether the work is, for example, an object to be contemplated by others, a means of communicating an idea, a mode of governmental proceeding, or an expressive tool meant to cause an effect. Finally, it would consider how the work’s creativity is valued within those networks, considering questions like whether the work is an asset within a film distribution network, a political commentary to be shared on social media, a major work for the international art market, or a ceremony meant to connect a community to the land. Once the court understands the nature of the work, it would then ask what potential loss of creativity would likely result from the unauthorized appropriation. This might include loss of creative inputs and production capability, loss of the ability to serve its intended expressive function, and loss of creative and intellectual enrichment to the environment that produces it. These are among the questions a fact finder would need to ask to really understand the scope of the creative environment and the potential effects an unauthorized use of a work would have on current and future cultural production.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s majority opinion in Google LLC v. Oracle Inc. seems to indicate the Court’s movement toward such an approach. There the court attempted to analyze the nature of a presumably copyrightable “user interface” created for computer programmers.[288] Instead of merely categorizing the computer code in question as a “literary work,” or even a “computer program”—two terms defined by the Copyright Act[289]—and granting greater protection to it against unauthorized uses, the court looked instead to the ontological nature of the work, examining what the work is from within the work’s creative environment. First, the court examined the inputs and outputs that created the interface, including the different kinds of computer code that made up the interface and the kinds of programming (creative, problem-solving vs. more functional or organizational) necessary to produce each component.[290] Second, the Court spent considerable space describing how the user interface functions within the creative environment for computer programming. It found that the code at issue effectively acted as a system of “file cabinets, drawers, and files” for programmers, organized with labels that “would prove intuitively easy to remember.”[291] Finally, the "
