        "text": "Order Granting Defendants' Motion To Dismiss For Lack of Personal Jurisdiction and Denying Motion For Sanctions [...]\n\nHaving reviewed the parties’ briefs in support of and in opposition to the motions, the relevant exhibits and case law, and the remainder of the record, the Court grants Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, and denies Defendants’ Motion for Sanctions. The Court’s reasoning follows [...]\n\nDefendant [...] is a resident of Minnesota. Her company, Defendant [...] , is a Minnesota limited liability company. [Defendant] is an internet “blogger and vlogger who makes, produces, and uploads ‘drama’ and/or ‘tea’ videos and internet postings on various internet-based platforms, including but not limited to YouTube and Twitter.” Defendants have an estimated 135,000 YouTube followers. [...]\n\nPlaintiffs claim that in these videos, Defendants have “intentionally harassed and maligned Plaintiffs and/or otherwise maliciously portrayed them in a false light and sought to financially harm them.” [...]\n\nDefendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction. Because the Court grants Defendants’ motion to dismiss on these grounds, it does not reach Defendants’ remaining challenges to the Complaint\n\nCourts apply a three-part test to determine whether the non-resident defendant has the requisite quantum of “minimum contacts” with the forum state for the exercise of specific jurisdiction to be appropriate: (1) the defendant has purposefully directed his activities toward the forum; (2) the plaintiff’s claims arise out of those forum-related activities, and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable. See Burger King Corp., 471 U.S. at 472–76; Schwarzenegger, 374 F.3d\n\nPersonal jurisdiction may be general or specific. Helicopteros Nacionales de Colom., S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 415–416 (1984). General jurisdiction requires that a defendant’s contacts in the forum state are “continuous and systematic.” See id. Because Plaintiffs here do not claim that Defendants are subject to this Court’s general jurisdiction, the Court considers only the question of specific jurisdiction. Defendants challenge the first prong of the “minimum contacts” test, and deny that they “purposefully directed” their activities towards Washington. [...]\n\nEven in this context of constantly and rapidly evolving technology, whether a defendant accused of an intentional tort such as defamation has “purposefully directed” its activities toward a forum sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction is still governed by the “effects” test outlined nearly 40 years ago by the Supreme Court in Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783 (1984); see Picot v. Weston, 780 F.3d 1206, 1214 (9th Cir. 2015). Under this test, courts are to determine whether the defendant “(1) committed an intentional act, (2) expressly aimed at the forum state, (3) causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state.” Mavrix Photo, Inc. v. Brand Techs., Inc., 647 F.3d 1218, 1228 (9th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). Apparently conceding prongs (1) and (3), Defendants claim that Plaintiffs have failed to establish the second element of the Calder effects test: that Defendants’ conduct was “expressly aimed” at Washington.[...]\n\nAs noted above, in the context of internet-based conduct in particular, courts “ have struggled with the question whether tortious conduct on a nationally accessible website is expressly aimed at any, or all, of the forums in which the website can be viewed,” and have required “something more” than maintenance of a passive website, available anywhere with an internet connection. Mavrix Photo, 647 F.3d at 1229. The Ninth Circuit has found jurisdiction where a defendant “continuously and deliberately exploited” the forum-state market for its website, and a “substantial number of hits to [defendant’s] website came from” the forum. Mavrix Photo, 647 F.3d at 1230. It has declined to exercise jurisdiction, however, even where almost 20% of a defendant’s total circulation was located in the forum, where plaintiff did “not establish that [defendant] expressly aimed at” the forum or “tailored the website to attract [forum-specific] traffic.” AMA Multimedia, LLC v. Wanat, 970 F.3d 1201, 1211 (9th Cir. 2020). [...]\n\nAfter examining Defendants’ connections to the state of Washington, the Court concludes that the Defendants’ contacts in this case are the kind of “random, fortuitous, or attenuated” contacts with the forum state that Walden cautioned courts against relying on. See Burger King Corp., 471 U.S. at 475; see also, e.g., Axiom Foods, Inc. v. Acerchem Int’l, Inc., 874 F.3d 1064, 1068 (9th Cir. 2017)\n\n[...]\n\nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that Defendants “expressly aimed” their video content at Washington, and thus have not shown that Defendants “purposefully directed” their actions toward the state of Washington. Therefore, the Court concludes that Washington is an improper forum, and this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Defendants."
