        "text": "Administrative Law & Practice (3) Law-7503\n\nThis course provides a study of the processes of decision making by administrative agencies and their control by legislators and courts. It centers on the tension between the need for delegation of power to agencies sufficient to ensure effective government, and the need to limit that power and protect the citizen from government oppression. The course focuses particularly on administrative procedure (including notice and comment rulemaking) and deals with the concept of administrative discretion and the constitutional, statutory, and common law doctrines that control discretion in administrative decision making. Also considered are contemporary issues that bear upon the fairness of governmental action (e.g., the right to notice and hearing, confrontation of witnesses, ex parte communications, institutional decisions, and combination of functions). There will not be an exam. Students will be graded on a series of short practice-oriented writing assignments designed to replicate practice in administrative law. This course will satisfy the Practice Oriented Writing Requirement.\n\nAdvanced Federal Income Tax (2) Law-7879\n\nThis course is a continuation of the basic Federal Income Taxation course. It includes federal income tax topics that are not generally addressed in detail or at all in the basic course, such as: in-depth coverage of tax accounting issues, taxation of intellectual property, taxation within families, tax consequences of litigation, alternative minimum tax, employee benefits and deferred compensation, and an introduction to basic issues of tax policy. This course is a core requirement for the Taxation certificate. (Prerequisite: Federal Income Taxation.)\n\nAdvanced Legal Research (2) Law-7803\n\nThis course will focus on the resources, process, and strategy of legal research. The course will include instruction on primary law such as legislative and administrative documents, and secondary sources, including practice materials. Students will be required to complete several research assignments to demonstrate competence using print and online resources to research and analyze legal issues. There is no final exam. (This course may satisfy either the Experiential Course requirement or Practice-Oriented Writing requirement, but one course cannot satisfy both requirements at the same time.)\n\nAdvanced Seminar: The Holocaust, Genocide and the Law (3) Law-7823\n\nThis seminar, through readings and class discussion, documentaries and guest speakers, examines international human rights law through the legacy of the Holocaust. Topics to be covered are: 1) the legal system of Nazi Germany and its lessons for today; 2) prosecution of Nazi war criminals over the last seventy years; 3) Holocaust restitution litigation in the United States to recover stolen wartime assets, including Nazi looted art; and 4) the legal legacy of the Holocaust upon the modern international criminal prosecutions for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Final grade is based upon a research paper on a topic selected by the student, class presentations of course materials and class participation.\n\nAdvanced Seminar: U.S. Copyright Law (3) Law-7822\n\nThis course offers an in-depth analysis of the rights and remedies afforded to copyright owners under U.S. law. We will discuss the theoretical, economic, and policy aspects of copyright law and engage in a number of practical exercises such as preparing correspondence with (hypothetical) clients, cease and desist letters, legal memoranda, and licensing agreements. Work prepared for these practical exercises will apply toward satisfying the course’s writing requirement (which is in lieu of a final exam). At the end of the course, students will be able to interpret and apply the relevant statutory provisions, identify and articulate the scope of U.S. copyrights and their limitations, and exhibit familiarity with the essential elements of a copyright infringement claim, the defenses and strategies available to a defendant, and the related bodies of law typically involved in copyright disputes. The classes will focus on applying case law and the statute to various hypothetical situations with the goal of preparing students to handle the copyright issues and problems typically encountered by a lawyer in practice. This course is an approved elective for the Entertainment Law certificate. This course will satisfy the Practice-Oriented Writing Requirement.\n\nAdvanced Topic: Art Law - (3) Law-7928\n\nThis three-unit class will provide an overview of law relating to art and cultural heritage. Transactions in the rapidly growing legitimate global art market are estimated at almost $70 billion annually, and art institutions, auction houses, dealers, museums and collectors have holdings valued well into the multi-trillions of dollars. Lawyers are involved in all aspects of the art world, and the legal issues they deal with are varied and fascinating. Students in this class will gain an understanding of the nature of art and cultural heritage institutions, services, and transactions, both domestic and international; an appreciation of the legal doctrines and regulations relevant to the art world; and an understanding of the dynamics of art and cultural heritage transactions. In addition, the class will examine the policy, political and ethical considerations that relate to the art market. Specific topics will include the role of copyright law, freedom of speech and expression, and government support (and censorship) of artistic expression; the role of museums and galleries and the legal obligations of trustees; the role of auction houses and dealers; question of title for works of art; the law of war and cultural heritage (for example the destruction of archaeological treasures by ISIS and others); responses to the problem of looting and illegal export of cultural heritage; the looting of art works by the Nazi’s; and the global trade in antiquities.\n\nAdvanced Topic: Comparative Law and Religion – (2) Law-7603\n\nThe Jewish Christian and Islamic Legal Traditions. This course, through readings and class discussion, documentaries and guest speakers, introduces the American law student to the legal thought of the three Abrahamic religions – Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Following introductory sessions on the history and tradition of each religion, the course will examine and compare the sources and structure of each religion and its basic precepts. Selected legal topics will be examined in-depth, including the \"personal status\" laws of marriage, divorce, inheritance; the relationship of the church/synagogue/mosque to the state; and the approaches of each religion to protection of the environment and to the role of armed conflict.\n\nAdvanced Topic: Constitutional Law (2) Law-7812\n\nThis course covers the limitations on the state and federal governments imposed by three individual liberties guaranteed by the Constitution: equal protection of the laws, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech. Prerequisite or Concurrent Enrollment: Constitutional Law.\n\nAdvanced Topic: Food Law - (2) Law-7672\n\nThis course focuses on the federal regulatory framework for food and its history, basic requirements, and goals; law’s role in agriculture emphasizing large-scale production, public health and sustainability goals; and other regulations impacting food’s production, distribution, consumption, and sale. (This course will satisfy the Practice Oriented Writing Requirement.)\n\nAgency and Partnership - (3) Law-7507 California Bar Tested\n\nThis course covers the law of agency and unincorporated business entities. The course will explore the definition and nature of a principal-agent relationship; the rights and duties of principals and agents; the scope of agents’ actual and apparent authority; the liability of disclosed and undisclosed principals for agents’ acts; agent fiduciary duties; third party rights and remedies; employer-employee and independent contractor relationships. The course also addresses the nature of unincorporated business entities, including general and limited partnerships, limited liability partnerships, and limited liability companies. Students will study statutory and case law discussing the formation, operation, and management of these entities, and students will learn the basic internal/external rights, powers, duties, and liabilities of the entity members vis-à-vis one another and vis-à-vis outside third parties. (This course is an approved elective for the Business Law certificate.)\n\nBusiness Planning (2) Law-7515\n\nThe goal of this course, through reviewing actual documents and agreements (and through class discussion), is to have students become familiar with certain legal and business relationships/issues raised in documents, business agreements and other contracts -- from a practical (real life) perspective. Generally, class discussions track the formation, growth, and eventual sale of a California business. We begin by analyzing and comparing different business entity structures. We then examine the relationship and conflicting motivations of owners, officers, and employees of the business. With the growth of the business, we move to a review of the various interactions a business has with its consultants, employees, venture investors, banks, and vendors. We end the course with an examination of the eventual merger/acquisition of the business. Practical problems and solutions are the focus of this course. It is intended to provide an important component of preparing students who will be advising and/or interacting with California businesses. The application of new technologies, including blockchain and cryptocurrency, will also explored. (This course is an approved elective for the Business Law Emphasis. May satisfy either the Experiential Course or Practice-Oriented Writing requirement with faculty approval; one course cannot satisfy both requirements at the same time.)\n\nCalifornia Civil Procedure (3) Law-7817 California Bar Tested\n\nThis course continues the study of civil procedure with advanced focus on California's procedural structure, including ways in which California procedure differs from federal civil practice. Areas of study include state practice in complex civil litigation, discovery, pleading, summary judgment, former adjudication and other advanced principles. Students will be expected to analyze complex fact patterns and to discern the ways in which California procedure differs from federal practice. (Prerequisite: Civil Procedure I and II.)\n\nCalifornia Evidence (3) Law-7318 California Bar Tested\n\nThis course addresses both civil and criminal provisions of the California Evidence Code, examining among many topics: relevance, character evidence, the hearsay rule and its exceptions, impeachment, expert testimony, and privileges. The course focuses on the California Evidence Code, with a practical focus on tactical and procedural introduction of evidence at trial in state court. The class will also cover differences between California Evidence Code and the Federal Rules of Evidence. (Prerequisite: Evidence.)\n\nNote: Evidence with Professor Mainero covers both the Federal Rules of Evidence and the California Code, and thus covers two bar tested subjects. Students who take Evidence with Professor Mainero may not take the elective California Evidence course because the elective is duplicative of the material covered in Professor Mainero’s Evidence course.\n\nCalifornia Street Gangs (2) Law-7934\n\nThis class will study the statutes of the “Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act of 1988” [STEP] (criminalizing active gang participation) from a legal and practical standpoint. Besides an in-depth understanding of this expansive and ever-changing area of jurisprudence in California, the course will provide an analysis of how gang-related felonies proceed through California courts. It will include study of the complicated and frequently used theories of extended criminal liability used by prosecutors including conspiracy, aiding and abetting, natural and probable consequence theory and provocative-act murder. A study of selected evidence code sections and related case law will be included to facilitate an understanding of issues, as well as common problems of proof at every gang trial. The use of guest speakers and selected autobiographical readings will provide context to this otherwise counter-intuitive culture of violence and respect. (Pre-Requisites: Criminal Law and Evidence. This course is an approved elective for the Criminal Law certificate. This course will satisfy the Practice Oriented Writing Requirement.)\n\nClient Interviewing and Counseling (3) Law-7520\n\nStudents will learn and practice skills involved in interviewing and counseling clients. Through the course of the semester, students will take one simulated case from the initial phase of gathering and evaluating facts supplied by a client, conduct substantive legal research, write a memorandum to the client file, and provide oral and written advice to the client based on consideration of facts and applicable law. The course will focus on interpersonal aspects of client relationships as well as ethical problems that may arise in the context of client representation. Students participate in simulated interviews and counseling sessions, portraying both client and attorney. Students will be videotaped in at least one interview or counseling session and will complete several written products, including a client letter, a memo to the file, and papers analyzing the lawyering process from the perspective of both attorney and client. (This course will satisfy the Practice-Oriented Writing Requirement OR the Experiential Course Requirement; one course cannot satisfy both requirements at the same time. This is a core requirement in the Certificate in Advocacy and Dispute Resolution.)\n\nClimate Change and the Law - (3) Law-7308\n\nClimate change is a defining legal issue of our times. The scope and scale of response it warrants is multijurisdictional and interdisciplinary. Climate change law is therefore fragmented and diverse, arising from constitutional, corporate, investment, torts, energy, international, environmental, land use and insurance laws, in addition to discrete climate laws. Disputes over the proper scope of legal action has resulted in multi-level litigation, from international and national to cities and local government. Equally, numerous regulations and legislative measures have resulted in substantial transactional work as well. Not surprisingly climate change has emerged as a distinct subject of legal studies. This course is designed to introduce students to the wide scope of legal developments in regard to climate change and prepare them to analyze complex legal issues on the matter. Students will also be encouraged to think about the broad normative and policy implications of the legal responses to climate change. The course will primarily focus on international law and U.S. domestic law. However, notable legal developments in other jurisdictions, including in Asia and in Europe will be considered as well. Given the extreme complexity of the problem, students will be encouraged to think innovatively. There will be no exam for this course. Students will be evaluated through a series of classroom exercises and a final research paper. Credits for this course will count towards an ENLURE Certificate.\n\nCommercial Leasing (2) Law-7521\n\nThis course introduces students to one of the most important areas of real estate practice: commercial lease law and negotiation. Students are required to master elements of legal substance and theory concerning the leasing of commercial property, as well as methods of practice and negotiation. In addition to studying sophisticated commercial leases, case opinions, and other textual materials, students draft and revise provisions of commercial leases and related lease documents. (This course is an approved elective for the ENLURE certificate and the Business Law certificate. This course will satisfy the Practice Oriented Writing Requirement.)\n\nCommunity Property (2) Law-7302 California Bar Tested\n\nThe organizing idea for the text and the course is that California community property is a “classification” system; property is either community or separate property based upon the date and source of acquisition of the property. Problems arise when spouses claim separate property interests in community property, community property interests in separate property, devote community effort to separate property, or make agreements, before or during marriage, or after date of separation or dissolution of the marriage, but before judgment is entered, on their property issues. All of these issues, and more, from acquisition of community property to its division upon dissolution of marriage, will be explored.\n\nConstitutional Law: Equal Protection & First Amendment - (3) Law-7812 California Bar Tested\n\nThis course covers the limitations on the state and federal governments imposed by three individual liberties guaranteed by the Constitution: equal protection of the laws, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech. (Prerequisite or Concurrent Enrollment: Constitutional Law.)\n\nCopyright Law and Practice (3) Law-7822\n\nCopyright law is critical across many different arts, technologies and industries. The digital revolution has transformed how we think about this body of law. We will examine its application to, and implications for, music, books, film and computer software, for example. Students will learn how to interpret and apply the statutory provisions, to identify and articulate the scope of U.S. copyright protection and its limitations, the essential elements of a copyright infringement claim, the defenses and strategies available to a defendant, and the related bodies of law typically involved in copyright disputes. The classes will focus on applying case law and the statute to various hypothetical situations with the goal of preparing students to handle the copyright issues and problems typically encountered by a lawyer in practice. (This course is an approved elective for the Entertainment Law certificate. This course will satisfy the Practice-Oriented Writing Requirement.)\n\nCorporate Tax (3) Law-7613\n\nThe basic federal income tax consequences to regular corporations and their shareholders of incorporations, capital contributions, corporate operations, dividend and other distributions, stock dividends, redemptions and liquidations, the accumulated earnings tax, and the personal holding company tax. S corporation taxation will also be briefly discussed.\n\nCriminal Law and Psychology (3) Law-8021\n\nThis course covers the forensic mental health issues that prosecutors and defense attorneys regularly encounter in practice, with an important part of the course being developing skills in evaluating actual cases. Topics covered include competence to stand trial, the insanity defense, battered women's syndrome, juvenile offenders, sex offenders, the role of mental health evidence in sentencing, rehabilitation of offenders, working with mental health experts, and the use of psychiatric and psychological evidence. (This course is an approved elective for the Criminal Law Emphasis Program.)\n\nCriminal Procedure/Police Practices (3) Law-7301 California Bar Tested\n\nThis course provides a close examination of the laws of criminal investigation. Topics include constitutional limits on arrests and stops, search and seizure, interrogation of suspects, right to counsel, and the privilege against self-incrimination.

Students will understand how to independently handle misdemeanor filings, pre-trial negotiations, motions, felony preliminary hearings and misdemeanor jury trials. This course is designed to prepare you for your spring semester externship by providing an understanding of criminal terminology, common penal and evidence code sections, and the most common type of jury trials that you will likely handle including domestic violence and driving under the influence. There will be a take-home exam.\n\nDirected Research (1-3; 12 and ½ pages minimum per credit based on standard format) Law-7850\n\nCourses are available to 2-4Ls only to study and research topics which are not provided for by regular curricular offerings. To register for Directed Research, students must complete a Directed Research form and submit the completed form to the Registrar’s Office for processing. The signatures of the supervising full-time professor and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs are required. The completed Directed Research form must be submitted to the Registrar’s office by the given Add/Drop deadline for the semester. Students cannot register for a Directed Research project online. Students must have a cumulative GPA of 2.6 at the end of their first year to partake in a Directed Research project.

Emphasis will be placed on the business aspects in each of these areas and the economics of the various revenue streams exploited in such distribution. Deal structures will be taught for the customary transactions entered into for both “in-house” productions as well as films financed and/or produced by third parties but distributed by the studio (i.e. acquisitions, negative pick-ups, co-productions, split rights arrangements, etc.) as well as studio deals with financial partners to lay off economic risk. The course will conclude with an exercise in which the students will select a motion picture slate made up of various genres, cast and deal models they will select based upon the project elements of actual (but anonymous) Hollywood studio productions. The success of those slates will then be projected as revealed by the actual performance of the movies from which those elements were taken. (This course is an approved elective for the Business Law certificate and the Entertainment Law certificate. This course will satisfy the Practice Oriented Writing Requirement OR the Experiential Course Requirement; one course cannot satisfy both requirements at the same time.)\n\nEntertainment Industry Contracts (3) Law-7830\n\nThis course provides a detailed review and analysis of the contracts involved in the making of a feature film and other media. Students will have hands-on experience with contracts from the inception of an idea to acquiring rights and hiring writers, directors and actors. The attorney’s role throughout the process of creating media will be examined. Students draft and negotiate contracts, draft client correspondence, and create client files. The skills learned in this course are applicable to drafting and negotiating transactions in many areas of law. (This course may satisfy the Practice Oriented Writing Requirement OR the Experiential Course Requirement; one course cannot satisfy both requirements at the same time. This course is an approved elective for the Entertainment Law Certificate and the Business Law Certificate.)\n\nEntertainment Law (3) Law-7538\n\nThis course explores the legal issues connected with the development, production, and exploitation of entertainment product, focusing predominantly on filmed entertainment, to some extent on musical compositions and recordings, and incidentally on other forms of entertainment.

Copyright law is not a prerequisite, and this course should not be considered as a replacement for the copyright course. (This course is a core requirement for the Entertainment Law Certificate.)\n\nEntrepreneurship and the Law (3) Law-7944\n\nToday’s firms demand more than legal proficiency. They are all looking for rainmakers who can bring in significant amount of business to their firm. Rainmakers aren’t built by accident, and they aren’t just born. This class will walk you through how to bring in clients to a firm you work for, or your own firm. We will cover topics such as clients trust in you, expertise, marketing, business acumen, and real case studies of how lawyers built their firms from $0 to 7 and 8 figure books of business. Whether you are going to work for a firm or start your own, every lawyer should have the skillset to build a book of business that will make them (a) more marketable, (b) less expendable and (c) able to dictate their compensation, terms of employment and put them in the driver’s seat.\n\nEnvironmental Law (3) Law-7541\n\nThis course constitutes an analysis of the ends and means of environmental protection through study of statutes, administrative regulations and practices, and judicial decisions treating the protection of the environment in the United States.

It considers the relationship of the federal courts to the legislative and executive branches of the federal government, and the relationship of the federal courts to the state courts. As such, class discussion naturally focuses on separation of powers and federalism principles. Topics may include Supreme Court jurisdiction, congressional control of federal court jurisdiction, justiciability, non-Article III courts, state sovereign immunity, federal court abstention, section 1983, federal review of state court decisions, and federal habeas corpus. (Prerequisite or concurrent enrollment: Constitutional Law.)\n\nFederal Income Tax (3) Law-7133\n\nThis course introduces students to the system of federal income taxation of individuals.

This course is a core requirement for the Taxation certificate. (Prerequisite: Federal Income Taxation.)\n\nFederal Tax Research – (2) Law-7889\n\nAn area often ignored in traditional legal research courses is the array of materials dealing with tax matters. These specialized materials are often separated from other library materials, and many practicing attorneys possess little ability to research tax matters for their clients. This course explores techniques in tax research and is also an extensive survey of primary and secondary sources in taxation. Classes focus on online research; there are several homework assignments and a short final paper. (Prerequisite: Federal Income Tax. This course is an approved elective for the Certificate in Taxation.)\n\nFinancial Accounting (3) Law-7855\n\nThis course represents an introduction to accounting for students with little background in the field. Initial emphasis is on established accounting principles and the analysis of financial statements. The course’s perspective is that of a business attorney who might use financial statements to advise clients in various legal settings (e.g., the drafting of financial contracts and the valuation of businesses). Applications to securities law are also considered.\n\nNote: This course is a core requirement for the Business Law Emphasis program; however, this may be waived upon verification that the student previously completed a comparable course in their undergraduate/graduate studies. The course previously taken will not be accepted in transfer, but it is only to waive out of this requirement for the emphasis. Students must contact the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs to request a waiver based on an accounting course previously taken.\n\nFirst Amendment Law Seminar (3) Law-7325\n\nThis course is a study of the fundamental freedoms of speech, press, association, and religion.

The course will focus on developing a skill set for an in-house corporate generalist addressing issues related to: corporate formation and administration, real property acquisition, facilities management (e.g., construction contracts), work force and labor issues (e.g., ADA compliance and workplace harassment/discrimination), litigation, and the management and defense of intellectual property. Students will have the opportunity to perform exercises relating to each of the substantive areas of in-house practice through actual case studies of corporate legal issues and simulating actual assignments as corporate counsel. Outside reading consists of articles and excerpts of published materials. Class sessions consist of lecture, class discussion, practical exercises and presentations, with some prominent in-house lawyers and general counsel as guest speakers, and networking opportunities. (This course will satisfy the Practice Oriented Writing requirement.)\n\nImmigration Law (2) Law-7552\n\nThis course provides an introduction into the examination of US law (constitutional, statutory, and administrative) governing the entry, presence, and expulsion of foreign nationals (aliens).

From the Sony hack to the NSA to iPhone encryption, information privacy law is now essential knowledge in boardrooms and courtrooms. This course will provide an introduction to the constitutional and common law origins of the law of privacy and to the statutory framework in California and at the federal level for protecting private information. There will be no final examination; rather, grading will be based on student writing and class exercises, such as oral arguments. This course will satisfy the Practice Oriented Writing Requirement.\n\nIntellectual Property (3) Law-7555\n\nThis course surveys the primary types of intellectual property under federal and state law.

We will examine the various methods of doing business abroad, moving from relatively simple to progressively more involved transactions -- for example, beginning with a basic sale and financing of goods across national borders to the establishment of a productive operation abroad through foreign franchisees, technology licensing arrangements and finally, direct investment in foreign enterprises. The last part of the course will focus on the resolution of international commercial disputes.\n\nWe will study these transactions in a variety of political and economic settings -- economically developed nations, developing-country markets and non-market economies in transition. Even though there will be some discussion of national controls and international regulation of trade, for example, the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement, the primary focus of the course is on private international business law (sales contracts, trademark licenses, intellectual property infringements, investment contracts, etc.). We will touch on an extensive range of substantive laws, such as the law of corporations, commercial transactions and the uniform commercial code, antitrust, intellectual property (copyright, trademark, patent), conflict of laws, civil procedure, contracts, international trade as well as public international law. Any knowledge or background in some of these areas will be helpful. However, there are no prerequisites for this course.\n\nThe course is designed to help students become “practice ready.” That is, students will learn transactional skills and work with actual contracts. In addition to learning substantive laws and legal doctrine, students will also learn different strategies of negotiation. Negotiation skills will be incorporated into and seamlessly mesh with the substantive laws in different sections of the course. In this respect, students will not only learn how to draft and mark up different types of contracts but will also be exposed to different approaches to negotiation by engaging in simulated negotiations. These simulated negotiations play out in different settings – transactions, dispute resolution and other situations lawyers encounter in practice. (This course will satisfy the Experiential Course requirement. This course is an approved elective for the Business Law Certificate and the International Law Certificate.)\n\nInternational Comparative Law (3) Law-7524\n\nThis course, through readings and class discussion, documentaries, and guest speakers, introduces the American law student to the rich legal traditions around the world. We begin by examining English law, the legal system most comparable to our own and which forms the basis of Anglo-American law. We then move to the European Continent and civil law by studying law in Germany. The course then examines a non-Western legal tradition by examining Chinese law. The tremendous growth of the Chinese economy and the growing political importance of China in the 21st century is the motivation for examining Chinese law. This course provides an important component of preparing the future lawyer to practice in a globalized legal world. (This course will satisfy the Practice Oriented Writing Requirement. No final exam. Grade is based on writing assignment.)\n\nInternational Criminal Law (3) Law-7332\n\nThis course will study the development of international criminal law since the mid-20th century.

The objective of the course is to explore legal responses a range of environmental challenges, from climate change to ozone layer depletion, biodiversity depletion, and human rights violations from environmental harms. The course is designed to develop international lawyering skills, and to think creatively in using law as a tool to address a host of critical environmental problems. Students will not only acquire knowledge about treaties and other international environmental law instruments, but also regarding intersection between domestic law and international law in addressing environmental problems.

Trade laws are applicable and relevant in many areas of legal practice, for example, international sales where goods and services are transferred across national borders and licensing of intellectual property. Trade lawyers practice at the international and national level, including trade bodies at the United Nations, the European Union, and the WTO itself, as well in private international law firms and at government agencies in the U.S. such as U.S. Customs, the U.S. International Trade Commission, the U.S. International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Trade Representative Office, to name a few. As part of the course, we will discuss some basic provisions of the central treaty, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), as well as some specific agreements such as those related to rules of origin, antidumping, subsidies and safeguards or escape clauses. We will also consider exceptions to trade commitments, such as environmental and public health exceptions. We will also study these rules within a policy framework that explores the economics of protectionism vs free trade and the controversies between “free trade” vs “fair trade” and those related to outsourcing or offshoring of jobs and the role trade rules play in this regard. (This course counts for the International Law Emphasis.)\n\nLand Use Regulation (3) Law-7626\n\nThis course examines the politics, policy and law of land use development.

(This course is an approved elective for the EntertainmentLaw Certificate.)\n\nLegal Analysis Workshop (3) Law-7504 California Bar Tested\n\nThis course will focus on two of the three portions of the bar exam: the performance test and multiple choice. The performance test is a closed-universe test of your skills; bar takers are given a task memo, a file (set of documents from which to extract their client’s facts), and a library (a set of cases and/or statutes to determine the relevant law). Bar takers have ninety minutes to determine what their task is, what the legal issues and relevant law are, their client’s relevant facts, and to draft the legal document they have been asked to write. This could be a memo, a portion of a brief, a client letter, interrogatories, etc. This class will teach students how to approach a performance test, what is expected of them, and how to accomplish the task within the requisite time.

Generally speaking, a secured transaction is one in which a debtor borrows money from a creditor and designates property as collateral to secure repayment of the loan. A classic example would be the financed purchase of an automobile. Should the debtor fail to make the required payments, the secured party may take legal action or (in some instances) repossess the property. Secured transactions fuel a substantial part of the American economy. In this course, we will examine various rules governing debtor/creditor and creditor/creditor relationships, addressing several key questions: how do financial institutions protect themselves against borrower default, what happens when the debtor files for bankruptcy protection, and who wins when similarly-situated creditors must square off against each other in the fight for the debtor's vulnerable assets? Given that many of the rules governing secured transactions in personal property are found in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, we will frequently consult its provisions. In laying a core conceptual foundation, we will also address secured transactions in real property, including the ramifications of mortgaging property and the legal and equitable rights of mortgagors and mortgagees prior to and during the foreclosure process. In each session, we will apply the law to hypothetical problems presented, and as a result, students completing the course will have a knowledge base critical to the effective representation of average consumers, growing businesses, insolvent/bankrupt debtors, and sophisticated financial institutions. The course provides a solid foundation for courses in Bankruptcy Law.

(This course is an approved elective for the Business Law certificate.)\n\nSelected Topics in American Law (3) Law-7636 California Bar Tested\n\nThis is a skills-development course that provides students with an intensive substantive review of selected legal material routinely tested on the bar exam and relevant to law practice, including contracts, torts, civil procedure, criminal law and procedure, real property, evidence, corporations, constitutional law, professional responsibility, wills and trusts, community property, and remedies. Through the use of problems and exercises in a bar exam format, students will become familiar with the techniques for analyzing, organizing, and writing essay questions based on California law. This is not a substitute for a bar review course, but a course on how to write good legal analysis in a particular area in a short window of time.\n\nAll students entering their final year of law study ranked in the bottom 25% of their class MUST take Selected Topics in American Law in the fall semester and MUST take Advanced Selected Topics in the spring semester.\n\nBecause of the helpful and important nature of Selected Topics in American Law, all students are strongly encouraged to enroll even if it is not required.\n\nAdvanced Selected Topics in American Law (3) Law-7676 California Bar Tested\n\nThe enrollment in Advanced Selected Topics in American Law in the Spring will give priority to students entering their final year of law study ranked in the bottom 25% of their class and will be a small section course with no more than fifteen (15) students per section that will focus entirely on intensive writing practice in advance of the Bar Exam. Advanced Selected Topics will thus not be offered in the Fall Semester. All students are eligible for Legal Analysis Workshop, which will be offered both in the Fall and in the Spring.

This course blends traditional case readings with readings from other disciplines to give students a context for understanding modern local government. The course will have a take-home exam that students can complete over the course of the final exam period that counts for approximately 50% of the total grade, with the remaining percentage of the grade determined by a series of short reaction papers assigned during the semester as well as class participation. The take-home examination will have a strict word/ page limit.
