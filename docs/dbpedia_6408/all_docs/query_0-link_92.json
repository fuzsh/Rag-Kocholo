        "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- Law groups from around Alabama this week have been sponsoring screenings of \"Hot Coffee\" the documentary film running on HBO that includes a serious look at the sometimes trivialized case of a woman who won a $2.7 million dollar punitive damage verdict against McDonald's after she spilled scalding coffee on herself.\n\nThe documentary takes a critical look at tort reform efforts -- fueled in part by the coffee cup case -- and the push by some in federal and state governments to put limits, or caps, on the awards of money by juries. It also looks at the trend of companies putting in mandatory arbitration in contracts with their employees or the consumers who purchase their goods or services, and the attempts by groups to elect judges more favorable to businesses.\n\nThe documentary, released in 2011 and shown at the Sundance Film Festival, is now in re-runs on HBO after its initial release.\n\nTonight's free public screening begins at 5:30 p.m. at Birmingham's B&A Warehouse, 1531 1st Avenue South. A panel also will answer questions after the viewing. The panel includes the documentary's director and producer Susan Saladoff, former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Sonny Hornsby who was interviewed for the movie, and John Wittig, interim chair of the Department of Communication Studies at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nThe documentary was shown to a group of about 90 students at Samford University's Cumberland School of Law today. With Saladoff to answer questions after that screening was former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Ralph Cook, who also was among those interviewed in the documentary.\n\nCook said after the Samford screening that one thing that has bothered him is companies that provide goods or a service, such as a cell phone or credit card company, later send a notice saying that if they use the card or service again they agree to mandatory arbitration, rather than filing a lawsuit, if they have a problem.\n\nThat's one of the issues looked at in the movie.\n\nPeople can waive their constitutional rights, Cook said. \"But it should be a knowing and voluntary waiver,\" he said.\n\nSaladoff, a lawyer herself, told students they can try to cross out and initial the mandatory arbitration clause if they choose to and see if the sales person accepts it. \"They need to be savvy,\" she said.\n\nThe documentary leads off with a look beyond the perceptions about the case of Stella Liebeck, 79, who filed a lawsuit in the 1990s against McDonald's after she was scalded by a cup of coffee she had just bought at a drive-through. Liebeck originally had asked McDonald's to pay her hospital expenses, but the company refused. The jury awarded her $2.7 million, an amount later reduced by the courts.\n\nThe lawsuit and verdict became the butt of jokes and a rallying cry for those who wanted to cap the amount of money people could be awarded in verdicts. But the documentary shows the third-degree burns Liebeck received, which caused her to spend eight days in the hospital, and resulted in skin grafting and scarring.\n\nAt the end of the program Saladoff encouraged the students to question people who criticize cases such as the Liebeck case. \"Say wait a second, do you have all the information,\" she said."
