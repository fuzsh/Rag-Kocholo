We examine the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) Triad, the NIST Cybersecurity and Privacy Frameworks, and essential principles of Privacy by Design (PbD), along with qualitative and quantitative methods of cyber risk assessment. We apply these frameworks and methods to realistic cybersecurity and privacy scenarios. We further explore methods of transferring cyber risk, including third-party contract terms and cyber insurance. Finally, we discuss legal requirements relating to data breach response and other forms of legal process concerning digital information.\n\nPrerequisite: INDL7550 Cybersecurity I\n\n2\n\nSeminar\n\nonline\n\nINDL7605\n\nCybersecurity Law and Policy I\n\n2\n\nLecture\n\nhybrid\n\nINDL7610\n\nCybersecurity Law and Policy II\n\n2\n\nLecture\n\nhybrid\n\nINDL8340\n\nCybersecurity: Computer Crimes and Personal Security\n\nThis module evaluates the nature of cyber crime and the legal framework for fighting cyber crime. We will learn about common modes of cyber attack, the use of mass crime tools such as \"botnets,\" and the role of organized crime in cyberspace. We will study the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and related U.S. and international laws that apply to computer crimes. We will also consider threats to personal safety arising out of cyberspace, including bullying, stalking, harassment, and child pornography, and we will study the unique legal challenges involved in crafting statutes to address such conduct without unduly impinging on rights of free speech and free association.\n\nPrerequisite: Internet Law and Governance Foundations\n\n1\n\nLecture\n\nin-class/online\n\nINDL8341\n\nCybersecurity: National Security, Surveillance, and Cyber-War\n\nThis module considers the problem of cyber-terrorism, cyber-espionage, and cyber-war. The U.S. military now considers \"cyber\" a \"fifth domain\" of warfare, after land, sea, air, and space. We will consider how the laws of war and emergencies relate to cyber incidents. We will also discuss the nature of Internet surveillance of private citizens, through an in-depth review of cases and materials relating to the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court.\n\nInternet Law and Governance Foundations\n\n1\n\nLecture\n\nin-class/online\n\nPRMD9238\n\nD.NJ Representation in Settlement Conference Practicum\n\nBuilding upon foundational professional skills acquired through the S.D.N.Y. Representation in Mediation Practicum, this offering affords a master class capstone experience. Under licensed faculty supervision, Student Advocates will appear before Magistrate Judges in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.\n\nEnrollment is restricted to Third- and Fourth-Year students who earn invitation through a competitive application/interview process facilitated by Prof. David M. White, Director of the Conflict Management Program.\n\nUnder Professor White’s direct supervision, Student Advocates will represent federal litigants for the limited purpose of settlement conference in civil actions which sound in a variety of tort and contract causes of action.\n\nStudent Advocates will: hone interviewing and legal writing skills through the preparation of confidential, ex parte settlement conference submissions; negotiate complex matters; refine their approach to client counseling; and explore the practical contours of professional responsibility.\n\nStudent Advocates will assume several client representations in sessions projected to span 3 to 8 hours each in the Newark, NJ or Trenton, NJ federal vicinages. Settlement conferences occur between the hours of 9:00am – 5:00pm to coincide with judicial chambers hours of operation.\n\nUpon successful completion of this semester-long opportunity, Student Advocates will receive 2 Legal Practice Curriculum credits. Academic achievement is graded on the High Pass, Pass, Low Pass or Fail scale.\n\nPre- or Co-requisite: PRMD9235 (S.D.N.Y. Representation in Mediation Practicum)\n\nNote: Practicum courses require Student Advocates to make a more substantial investment of time than would ordinarily be expected in a 2-credit elective. Student Advocates must demonstrate significant flexibility in scheduling to accommodate meetings and proceedings that fall outside of regular class time. Due to the heightened demands of practicum participation, students are strongly discouraged from taking this offering concurrent with a Center for Social Justice clinic.\n\n2\n\nSkills\n\nin-class\n\nINDL9337\n\nDigital Asset Law: Cryptocurrency, Non-Fungible Tokens & the Metaverse\n\nBlockchain technology has led to an explosion in the value and use of digital assets.

By the end of the class, students will understand the real-world applications of the technology and how the resulting innovations fit into existing legal frameworks.\n\n2\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nPRMD8209\n\nDispute Resolution Processes\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the traditional forms of interpersonal and commercial conflict management: negotiation, mediation and arbitration. The class also explores lesser known and emerging hybrid processes including arb-med, early neutral evaluation, med-arb, mini trial, ombuds, online dispute resolution, private judges/juries and summary jury trial. Each method of dispute resolution is explored in a series of classes, and students are introduced to these methods through limited lecture informed by authoritative texts followed by experiential exercises. Students translate theory into practice through frequent participation in demonstrations, fishbowls and role play exercises that approximate real world legal practice. Each student receives detailed faculty and peer critique through the use of the 360-degree feedback model.\n\nCourse is graded High Pass, Pass, Low Pass or Fail.\n\n2\n\nSkills\n\nin-class\n\nPRMD9275\n\nDrafting and Dealmaking in Transactional Law\n\nThis course is intended to provide students with a preview into the early years of practice as a transactional lawyer. It will ground students with a foundational understanding of the business issues routinely encountered in transactional practice, particularly in the context of M&A transactions. It will also teach the fundamentals of contract drafting; students will gain an understanding of the various parts of an agreement and learn how to translate the business deal into provisions that address their client’s needs.\n\n2\n\nSkills\n\nin-class\n\nPRMD8218\n\nElectronic Discovery\n\nIt is a fact of modern life that an enormous volume of information is created, exchanged, and stored electronically. Conventional documents originate as computer files; email, text messaging, instant messaging, and social media are taking the place of both telephone calls and postal letters; and electronically stored information (ESI) is commonplace in our personal lives and in the operation of the businesses, public entities, and private organizations. In the past decade, discovery involving word-processed documents, spreadsheets, email, and other ESI has become more routine and no longer a product of large cases involving sophisticated entities. This interactive course is designed to give students an understanding of (1) the legal landscape that has developed since the 2006 electronic discovery (eDiscovery) amendments to federal and state court rules were enacted, (2) how to manage and balance eDiscovery issues that will inevitably arise in their practice, (3) the technology behind the legal issues that arise in the eDiscovery context, and (4) how best to apply traditional legal principles to the ever-changing technologies that continue to develop and contribute meaningfully to the legal discourse on eDiscovery through bi-weekly blog posts about new developments in the law.\n\nCourse is graded High Pass, Pass, Low Pass or Fail.\n\nPrerequisites: Persuasion and Advocacy, Evidence or Evidence: Theory and Practice\n\n2\n\nSkills\n\nin-class\n\nLABR8106\n\nEmployment Law\n\nThis course develops the legal theories underlying the employment relation.

The travel component builds upon the EUBL course by affording a small group of law students the opportunity to travel to Belgium and Luxembourg during fall break (with faculty) to learn about EU institutions and various business law issues. The program will engage with educational partners at the Catholic University of Louvain, in Louvain-la-Neuve and the University of Luxembourg on a wide range of topics, including state aid, EU tax issues, EU company law, EU external relations, and tax transparency. The program will also offer students the opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge about the EU institutions through visits to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg and the European Commission and Parliament in Brussels. (The travel component of European Business Law is not a mandatory component of the European Business Law AWR seminar.)\n\nCo-requisite: European Union Business Law\n\nCourse is graded on a Pass/D or Fail basis.\n\n1\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nINTL9602\n\nEuropean Union Business Law\n\nThis seminar will concentrate on the basic legal rules of the common market and the constitutional structure of the European Union. The developing jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union will be analyzed with a particular focus on the free movement of persons, both the rights of workers and establishments, to be free of discriminatory tax obstacles. The seminar will also explore special topics such as Brexit, company law, EU taxation of the digital economy, EU external relations, intellectual property law, and the Treaty articles on state aid. U.S. constitutional principles are compared throughout the course. There is an optional fall break one credit travel component that may be taken by the students in this course. This course fulfills the requirement of EU law and an EU paper that is necessary for application to the Externship at the Court of Justice of the European Union (Dean Acheson Stage Program).\n\nThis seminar meets one day a week in the fall for two hours.\n\n3\n\nSeminar\n\nin-class\n\nINTL9607\n\nEuropean Union Law Seminar\n\nThe EU has changed dramatically over the last decade. Accordingly, this course will look at its origins in the Schuman Declaration, May 9, 1950, to see the values and times as the Founders lived them and compare that with the changing times and values of today, almost 70 years later. EU citizenship, the status of women and the achievement of an internal market will be considered as a basis for examining core values and assaultive challenges. New developments will be examined such as keeping the peace with NATO, intervening in Kosovo and coping with the stance of the Russian Federation, including their Eurasian Economic Union and its oil interests. All-consuming discussions of what Brexit means for the European constitutive treaties dwarfs the crisis in Turkey, the threats in Hungary and Poland and the need for fuller relations with Africa. Other challenges demand legal and political attention. Finally, the culture of corporate and political corruption, security, crimes-and-justice, the status of refugees and forgotten peoples in an age of terrorism and the state of the people's trust and confidence in the institutions of the EU have only become more important in the wake of Brexit.\n\nThere is an optional fall break one credit travel component that may be taken by the students in this course. This course fulfills the requirement of EU law and an EU paper that is necessary for application to the European Court Externship Program (Dean Acheson Stage Program).\n\nThis Seminar meets one night a week in the fall for two hours. The student may choose 3 credits, which requires a 25-page paper fulfilling the AWR requirement or 2 credits, which requires a take- home examination instead of a paper.\n\n3/2\n\nSeminar\n\nin-class\n\nPRMD7201\n\nEvidence\n\nThis course analyzes the regulation of proof in judicial proceedings.

A single grade will be given for the course, but it will be derived from at least two anonymous grading exercises.\n\nNOTE 1: Students cannot apply both Evidence: Theory and Practice (PRMD7205) course and Evidence (PRMD7201) towards degree requirements.\n\nNOTE 2: Year-long course; 3 credits Fall, 3 credits Spring\n\n6\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nPUBG7806\n\nExecutive Power and the Constitution\n\nThis course will examine the issue of executive power under the Constitution. The course will consider the legal framework for the exercise of executive power, its place within the Constitution's structure, and the constraints on it. Particular attention will be given to recent uses of executive power to address perceived national security and foreign policy challenges, including actions taken in the War on Terrorism and restrictions on immigration.\n\n1\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nPRMD8212\n\nFact Investigation and the Marshalling of Evidence\n\nThe purpose of the course would be to introduce the students to the practical problems involved in regard to the following:\n\n1. Determining what information to look for in a case in litigation, or under consideration for litigation (how to craft the legal theory of the case and its implications for investigation). This part of the course concentrates on identifying the elements of the substantive law that are in play in whatever case is under consideration, and also identifying the distribution of the burden of introducing evidence in regard to those issues, in order to outline which issues require the lawyer to insure that information bearing on those issues is obtained.\n\n2. Determining how best to go about trying to obtain the information identified as potentially available in number 1, above, in other words, how to formulate a specific investigation plan. This requires detailed fact analysis of the available facts.\n\n3. The practical problems of carrying out the investigation plan, and how these differ in different litigation settings and role contexts (civil v. criminal; civil plaintiff v. civil defendant; prosecution v. criminal defendant.). The interaction between resources, discovery rights (or the lack thereof), and private investigation, and the role of the lawyer in each context, will be considered.\n\n4. Updating and modifying the theory of the case and the investigation plan as new information is obtained.\n\nCourse will require written exercises which will be graded based on students’ clarity of analysis and exposition, and improved proficiency over time.\n\nCourse is graded High Pass, Pass, Low Pass or Fail.\n\n2\n\nSkills\n\nin-class\n\nCLIN7182\n\nFamily Law Clinic\n\nThe Family Law Clinic offers students the opportunity to further develop their legal analytical abilities, learned in core courses, in the context of actual casework while beginning to hone the full range of advocacy skills they will need to be effective in the practice of law. Students serve as counsel to clients in a range of family law cases, including those involving domestic violence restraining orders and adoption, from initial client interview through final judgment. They are supervised in their activities by a clinical faculty member but have primary responsibility for their cases. For example, students draft all pleadings, negotiate with opposing counsel, and represent their clients in court proceedings. Students gain this experience while providing critical legal services to those who are unable to afford legal representation. The clinic is open to all students who have completed 2/3 of the credits required for graduation.\n\nThe course is letter-graded for both the clinical and class components.\n\nPrerequisites: Minimum Cumulative 2.60 GPA, Evidence, Professional Responsibility, and Persuasion and Advocacy.\n\nNOTE: Students cannot participate in an externship in the same semester in which they are enrolled in a clinic.\n\n3\n\nClinic\n\nin-class\n\nCLIN7183\n\nFamily Law Clinic\n\nThe Family Law Clinic offers students the opportunity to further develop their legal analytical abilities, learned in core courses, in the context of actual casework while beginning to hone the full range of advocacy skills they will need to be effective in the practice of law.

The pre-market approval system governing drugs will be examined along with the debate about the length of testing. Other topics include the prescription status of drugs, consumer advertisements, and the impact of commercial speech protections. Major issues concerning food regulation are considered such as the appropriateness of a no-risk policy for carcinogens and the use of biotechnology in foods. The justification for the deregulation of dietary supplements will also be explored. The course aims to provide students with an understanding of the principal regulatory means used by the agency, such as rulemaking, and court enforcement. In addition students will be able to consider the appropriateness of schemes based on disclosure and those that impose additional restrictions.\n\n3\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nCRJU9407\n\nForce and Fraud in Criminal Law\n\nForce and fraud are forms of malicious, wrongful conduct. But in some contexts, they are also accepted ways of exercising political power. Today, force and fraud are at the core of the substantive criminal law, and at the core of law’s enforcement mechanisms. This seminar examines force and fraud from both perspectives. Approximately the first half of the course will be devoted to the substantive criminal law. Topics include: the types of physical force that are criminalized; the classification of offenses as “violent”; perjury and other forms of criminalized lying; theft-by-deception in contrast to theft-by-force; rape-by-deception in contrast to rape-by-force. Approximately the second half of the course will be devoted to force and fraud as methods of law enforcement. Here we will consider the use of physical force by police officers and prison officials; the deceptions of undercover work; “testilying” (police perjury); and interrogation techniques that employ either physical force or deception. Students will be asked throughout the course to reflect on the relative vices – or virtues – of force and fraud. *Students may write a seminar paper in this course to fulfill the AWR requirement, or they may elect to complete a take-home exam rather than an AWR paper.\n\nPrerequisite: Criminal Law\n\n2/3*\n\nSeminar\n\nin-class\n\nINDL9328\n\nFoundations of Intellectual Property Law and Policy\n\nThis seminar examines the foundations and policies underlying intellectual property law.

Students may serve as counsel providing full representation to clients in housing cases including landlord-tenant actions and evictions, as well as housing discrimination, accessibility, and housing conditions cases. Students may provide representation from original interview through final judgment. Students may also serve as advisors to clients seeking to put in place advance directives such as health care proxies or instruction directives, documents which are designed to ensure that the client’s wishes are carried out. In addition, students may provide advice, brief service, and counsel to individuals without providing full representation.\n\nStudents are supervised in their activities by clinic faculty who are attorneys licensed to practice in New Jersey, but the students will have primary responsibility for the conduct of the case. Students draft all pleadings and make court appearances on behalf of their clients.

Topics include healthcare access and payment, the organization and governance of nonprofit hospitals and other health care organizations, health care fraud and abuse, antitrust issues for healthcare providers, hospital and managed care liability, confidentiality of medical information, informed consent, and medical decisions at the end of life.\n\nPre/co-requisite for JD only: Business Associations\n\n3\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nHLTH7518\n\nHealth Privacy\n\nAs our health information is being digitized and stored in electronic records, this transformation poses novel challenges for the laws designed to protect the privacy and security of our personal health information. This class will provide students with a substantive overview and analysis of the laws that directly govern or have an impact on health information privacy and security in the United States. The main focus of this course will be the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the foundation for federal protections of health information. Additionally, the course will examine the interplay between HIPAA and other federal and state health privacy laws and the application and enforcement of those laws in a variety of health care settings.\n\n2/3\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nHLTH8504\n\nHealthcare Access and Payment\n\nThis course examines the public and private insurance programs connecting people to needed health care. The basic structures of the relevant law – Medicare, Medicaid, and the regulation of private insurance – are undergoing rapid change. We will examine sometimes-competing economic, political, and policy principles undergirding the structure of the system by which access and payment are governed, as well as less contested innovations in payment, such as social accountable care organizations and performance based reimbursement, that promise to improve care and moderate costs.\n\n3/4\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nHLTH7405\n\nHealthCare Compliance Certificate Program\n\nThis live course, offered over the course of four days, immerses students in the statutes, regulations and other guidance that comprise the body of law known as “fraud and abuse law.” Topics covered include:\n\nData Privacy - HIPAA, HITECH, and others\n\nFDA approval and regulation of new drugs and devices\n\nFederal Anti-Kickback Statute\n\nFederal and State False Claims Acts\n\nFederal and State Sunshine Laws\n\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) - including worldwide anti-corruption and enforcement\n\nGovernment Investigations\n\nHealthcare fraud sentencing, penalties, damages, and other considerations\n\nOIG Compliance\n\nPrescription drug and device marketing and advertising\n\nPrerequisite/Co-requisite: Health Law\n\nRecommended: Health Care Fraud and Abuse\n\n2\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nHLTH9524\n\nHealthCare Fraud and Corruption\n\nThis course introduces students to the various statutes and regulations used to address corrupt behavior in the health care system and the various government actors who enforce them. The course comprises a study of the health and non-health related laws that address corruption, both domestically and abroad, including the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law, False Claims Act, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Students will also learn about various Department of Justice and HHS-OIG policies (and those of other enforcers) which drive government efforts to prevent fraud and abuse and as a result impact the provision of care throughout the health care system.\n\nNote: Course offered as a seminar up until the end of Spring 2020 and will transition to a lecture format after Spring 2020 semester has concluded.\n\n3/4\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nHLTH7504\n\nHIPAA Privacy and Security\n\nThis course explores the federal regulatory scheme designed to protect the privacy and security of health information. Topics covered include:\n\nEntities and information to which HIPAA applies\n\nWhen consent is required for the use and disclosure of health information\n\nTypes of health information requiring heightened protection\n\nUse of health information for research and marketing\n\nSecurity measures required to protect digitized health information\n\nIndividuals’ right to access their health information\n\nBusiness associate agreements\n\nHIPAA compliance and enforcement\n\n2\n\nonline\n\nINTL8611\n\nHuman Rights in The Hague\n\nTaking advantage of the unique attributes of The Hague, this 1 credit course will explore International Dispute Resolution mechanisms in The Hague such as the International Court of Justice, the Permanent Court of Justice, and international criminal courts such as the International Criminal Court and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. It will focus on how human rights affect their mandate with regards to process and substance. From a procedural standpoint, we will look at due process guarantees, the right of access to justice, and how human rights affect the operation of court proceedings in the criminal and context. From a substantive point of view, we will look at recent international cases to examine how human rights connect with investment, business, state-to-state disputes and international criminal proceedings. Visits to two international courts will be included.\n\n1\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nCLIN7191\n\nImmigrants' Rights/International Human Rights Clinic\n\nThe Immigrants’ Rights/International Human Rights Clinic represents people from all over the world who are in need of protection from persecution, trafficking and torture. In addition to representing clients before asylum officers and in Federal Immigration Court, students may also represent clients in appeals to the Board of Immigration Appeal, the Second and Third Circuits, or the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Students may also be engaged in human rights reporting and fact-finding as well as comparative law and human rights projects. They also assist immigrant victims of domestic violence and other crimes in seeking visas to grant them legal status to remain in the United States. Another key aspect of the clinic is providing assistance to detained immigrants in the greater Newark area. The classroom component combines trial skills with substantive immigration law. Clinics are open to all students who have completed 2/3 of the credits required for graduation.\n\nThe course is letter-graded for both the clinical and classroom components.\n\nPrerequisites: Minimum Cumulative 2.60 GPA, Evidence, Professional Responsibility and Persuasion and Advocacy.\n\nNote: Students cannot participate in an externship in the same semester in which they are enrolled in a clinic.\n\n1\n\nClinic\n\nin-class\n\nCLIN7190\n\nImmigrants' Rights/International Human Rights Clinic\n\nThe Immigrants’ Rights/International Human Rights Clinic represents people from all over the world who are in need of protection from persecution, trafficking and torture.

In light of the globalization of the economy and the increasing significance of immigration matters and consequences, familiarity with basic immigration law is essential for practice in areas including civil rights law; criminal law; employment and labor law; family law; and international law. In addition to lecture and working with problems, this class incorporates a practical skills component by having students engage in oral arguments; draft legislation; and observe hearings in federal immigration court.\n\n3\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nCLIN7184\n\nImpact Litigation Clinic\n\nThis is a year-long course with students receiving 2 credits in the fall semester and 2 credits in the spring semester. Each Impact Litigation Clinic student works on a team that briefs and argues an appeal in federal court, or files amicus briefs in a federal appellate court or the Supreme Court of New Jersey, over the course of this year-long clinic. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit appoints the Impact Litigation Clinic to represent indigent, pro se litigants in federal appellate cases that raise noteworthy legal issues. Cases include a range of subject areas such as immigration, employment and housing discrimination, police brutality, and unconstitutional prison conditions. Students work closely with clinical faculty, reviewing the trial court record, preparing the appendix for appeal, consulting with the client, researching and writing the appellate briefs, and preparing for oral argument. If a Second Circuit case does not settle, each team of students will argue its case before the Second Circuit. (Teams filing amicus briefs ordinarily help prepare for and attend oral argument, but the Supreme Court of New Jersey does not permit students to argue.) Both the clinical and classroom component of the course address the legal rules and strategic considerations involved in the appellate process; the course focuses more generally on advanced legal research, analysis and writing, and preparation for effective oral advocacy in the courtroom. The clinic is open to all students who will have completed two-thirds of the credits required for graduation prior to the start of the clinic; weekend and evening students need to have considerable schedule flexibility, including the ability to attend the two weekly class sessions and to be able to schedule office hours overlapping with their teammate(s) and professor.\n\nThe course is letter-graded for both the clinical and class components. The course is generally appropriate for students who have a demonstrated high capacity for and interest in complex, sophisticated legal writing.\n\nPrerequisites: Minimum Cumulative 2.60 GPA, Evidence, Professional Responsibility and Persuasion and Advocacy.\n\nNote: Students cannot participate in an externship in the same semester in which they are enrolled in a clinic.\n\n2/2\n\nClinic\n\nin-class\n\nCLIN7185\n\nImpact Litigation Clinic\n\nThis is a year-long seminar course that accompanies the clinical portion of the course. Though the work is equal both semesters, or sometimes somewhat greater in the fall, students receive 0 credits in the fall semester and 1 credit in the spring semester for this seminar. The seminar portion of the course generally meets twice per week, for two hours. Most weeks, one of those sessions will be in a seminar format and one will be a working session in which the class may meet collectively, but will split up into the teams working on each case to consult with each other and with the clinical faculty member, to speak with clients, and to work on their cases.\n\nPrerequisites: Minimum Cumulative 2.60 GPA, Evidence, Professional Responsibility and Persuasion and Advocacy.\n\nNote: Students cannot participate in an externship in the same semester in which they are enrolled in a clinic.\n\n0/1\n\nClinic\n\nin-class\n\nPUBR7907\n\nIncarceration, Social Inequality & the Law\n\nStarting in the early 1970s, the incarceration rate in the United States increased dramatically. Today, the United States incarcerates citizens at a rate five times the rate at which it incarcerated them for the first three quarters of the twentieth century. No other nation incarcerates such a large proportion of its population. Historically, racial disparity is inherent in the criminal system and has direct connections to the founding of the country. The black to white ratio in imprisonment today is around six to one. One in four black men and one in eight Latino men will go to prison before their mid-thirties. Two in three black men who did not finish high school will be imprisoned in their lifetimes. This course asks several questions: How did we get here? How did the United States become the world’s leader in incarceration? What laws and policies supported this carceral state? How did racial and class inequality in incarceration become so stark? What laws and policies can be implemented to rectify our past and present? What are the consequences of the high rate and dense social concentration of incarceration in the United States? Finally, what can we do about it as lawyers? The course will examine the causes of the growth in the US penal population and historical roots of such growth, from the mid- 20th century to present-day. It will examine the legal framework that enabled the policies – the war on drugs, emphasis on punishment and retribution in lieu of rehabilitation or restoration; structure of sentencing (mandatory minimums, discrimination in same); inequities in bail, and less known topics like the ways in which criminalization affects pregnant women and leads to the carceral child welfare system.\n\n2\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nWRTG9142\n\nIndependent Research\n\nThis offering consists of faculty-directed research for one semester on a topic approved by a faculty member supervising the research and by a committee of the faculty. The resulting paper must be a minimum of 40 pages and is required to meet law review student publication standards. It must be defended before the Independent Research Committee. A student seeking to enroll in Independent Research must receive the consent of a full-time faculty sponsor and the Independent Research Committee prior to enrollment. Those students interested in registering for Independent Research must obtain the appropriate form from the Registrar's Office and return it with the required signatures before being permitted to register for the course. Registration must be completed no later than the Drop/Add period of the semester in which the course is taken.\n\nNOTE: This course can only be taken once and is not open to first year and second year evening students.\n\nPrerequisites: Minimum Cumulative 3.00 GPA and good academic standing.\n\n2\n\nWriting\n\nin-class\n\nINDL7304\n\nInformation Privacy Law\n\nInformation technology has transformed our everyday lives, but at the same time, it has profound effects on our personal privacy. A vast amount of our personal information is digitized. This includes details about our health and genes, purchasing and reading habits, chats with friends and even our physical location. Government and private companies can access, collect, store, transfer to other parties, and sometimes misuse our personal information. U.S. law has grappled to regulate privacy through a growing amalgamation of judicial decision-making, statutes and regulations. This course will examine the regulation of privacy in the United States. But since information is not confined by national boundaries, it will also examine global privacy regulation (particularly in the European Union) and its impact on privacy regulation in the United States.\n\n2\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nPRMD8225\n\nIn-House Counsel Skills\n\nStudents will learn the unique challenges of working in-house as corporate counsel, developing the perspectives and skills to think and be effective business partners. Each week the students will work either individually or in teams to address simulations and problems covering the different dimensions of an in-house counsel’s job. The simulations may include, risk management, compliance, ethics, governance of the board of directors, crisis management, business strategy, regulatory interpretation for business executives, dealing with regulators, administrative proceedings, internal investigations, contract negotiation, litigation and the management of outside counsel, and employment matters. The intention of the course is to advance the notion that an in-house counsel is a business partner that plays a pivotal role in leading the organization through the anticipation of legal needs to avoid potential disputes. The course will highlight the fact that in-house counsel must not only advise on the law, but additionally navigate complex internal politics, the board of directors, external stakeholders, and regulators. The class will include several in-house guest lecturers and one class consisting of a panel of in-house counsel covering different legal specializations and backgrounds.\n\n2\n\nSkills\n\nin-class\n\nCOML7123\n\nInsurance\n\nThis course considers the role of insurance in American society, emphasizing: the nature of the insurance contract, including standard clauses; the notion of wager and insurable interest; concealment; representation; contributions; warranty; illegality; waiver; estoppel; and subrogation. It examines both common law principles and state supervision and regulation of the insurance industry.\n\n2\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nINDL7301\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nThis course will survey the basic doctrines of intellectual property (“IP”) law, including patent, trademark, and copyright law. We will also briefly look at state law doctrines focusing on trade secrets. The course is intended both for those who intend to practice in an IP field and for those with a more general interest in the topic. Given the interrelations and analogies among IP rights, any specialized IP practitioner should have a working knowledge of IP areas outside his or her area of expertise. Since most lawyers’ business models depend on the commodification of information, any practitioner would benefit from an understanding of this field.\n\n3\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nINDL8317\n\nIntellectual Property Licensing\n\nThe seminar will provide a comprehensive study of all aspects of Intellectual Property licensing and related issues. Students will analyze and draft various trademark, copyright, character, right of publicity/privacy, merchandizing, music, software, confidentiality, patent/technology, and new media licenses, and develop related negotiation skills and litigation strategies. The focus will be practical and will show how value can be unleashed in Intellectual Property Assets through licensing.\n\n2\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nINDL9336\n\nIntellectual Property, Technology, and Justice\n\nThis seminar covers issues relating to intellectual property and technology law and social justice, including patents on essential medicines, copyright policy and cultural products, technology-enabled data collection and surveillance, Western intellectual property regimes and indigenous cultural appropriation, and related issues.\n\n3\n\nSeminar\n\nin-class\n\nINDL7303\n\nInternational & Comparative IP Survey\n\nIntellectual property rights are global assets. Any business that provides goods or services across territorial borders must understand how to protect its intellectual property rights and to engage in intellectual property transactions across different parts of the world. Although there are international treaties that coordinate intellectual property protection internationally, there are no fully harmonized or unified international intellectual property rights. This course will examine differences in patent, copyright, trademark, and related protections in the United States, the European Union, and other parts of the world, with attention to treaties such as the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) agreement that provide some degree of international cohesion. The course will also consider practical aspects of securing, enforcing, and transacting in intellectual property rights across national borders. The course is suitable both for students with specialized interest in intellectual property as well as for students more interested in international business and technology law who will benefit from some familiarity with the course's themes. A primer on basic intellectual property principles will be provided for students who have not previously taken an intellectual property course or who need a refresher.\n\n3\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nINTL8602\n\nInternational Business Transactions\n\nInternational business transactions are business transactions that are transactional in character. The transnational aspect typically arises from the fact that (1) the transacting parties operate in or from different national jurisdictions; (2) the transaction involves the movement of goods, services, technology or capital across national boundaries; or (3) the transaction, where it occurs between parties in one country, has legally significant extraterritorial effect in another country. The course is designed to give students a broad overview of the law - domestic, foreign and international - governing international business transactions. Students will be introduced to the contractual and regulatory issues and risks that confront private parties in a variety of transnational transactional settings, including the settlement and resolution of disputes that may arise in such transactions. The transactions that form the subject matter of the course include documentary international sales, agency and distributorship agreements, licensing, foreign direct investment, international mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, and natural resource development.\n\n2\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nINTL9615\n\nInternational Criminal Law\n\nThis seminar covers the dynamic and rapidly growing field of international criminal law. Traditionally, international crimes related to universally condemned practices, such as piracy or the slave trade. However, advances in technology and communications, as well as increased transnational mobility, have led to new categories of conduct being recognized as international crimes and a new approach towards transnational justice. The seminar will focus on key topics in international criminal law, including the modern development of the law of war; the creation of war crimes tribunals from Nuremberg to the present; the emergence of a permanent International Criminal Court; and the challenges posed by transnational crimes such as terrorism and drug trafficking.\n\n3\n\nSeminar\n\nin-class\n\nENVR7609\n\nInternational Environmental Law and Policy\n\nThe course is designed to provide students with practical knowledge that will assist them in serving clients in the increasingly global marketplace. It will emphasize subjects that will be relevant not just for those focusing on environmental law, but to a broad cross-section of legal practices, including litigation, business law, securities law and trade law. In addition to general theory and policy, the course will cover: global climate change, including an analysis of the evolving international greenhouse gas regulatory regimes as well as the anticipated legislation to be enacted by the incoming administration for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions -- regimes and legislation that are expected to affect a broad cross-section of the global economy and will impact areas of legal practice; the making of international environmental law, including treaties and customary international law principles; the global reach of US environmental laws; international trade and the environment; the role of multinational corporations in the formulation of environmental law and policy at the international level , as well as international corporate environmental standards by multinational corporations; the imposition of global environmental standards on international projects by multinational lenders (e.g. the World Bank and the IFC) and, increasingly, private lenders.\n\n2\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nINTL8600\n\nInternational Law\n\nThis course is an introduction to public international law as applied between independent states and in national courts. It includes selected problems in the sources, development, authority and application of international law; the law of treaties; recognition; territory, nationality, jurisdiction and immunities; the United Nations and other international organizations; international protection of human rights; state responsibility and international claims, and aspects of the law of war.\n\n4\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nINTL7638\n\nInternational Legal Research\n\nThis course is offered in the Fall semester primarily for students competing in the Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition. Students will learn the structure of international legal institutions, the nature of the materials they produce, and the unique way these materials are indexed and cataloged. This course addresses how these materials can best be used in legal advocacy, both in written submissions and during oral argument. The course also provides instruction on the international legal issues at stake, including an in-depth study of opinions of the International Court of Justice and issues that generally arise in Jessup problems.\n\n1\n\nSkills\n\nin-class\n\nTAXN8120\n\nInternational Tax Planning\n\nThis course considers the basic principles and policies governing the U.S. taxation of international transactions using a problem-oriented approach. Students will analyze various problems from the perspective of an attorney responsible for advising American individuals and corporations earning income abroad. Some consideration will be given to the perspective foreign interests that receive income from the U.S. sources, but the primary focus will be on outbound transactions.\n\nPrerequisite: Federal Income Taxation\n\n2-3\n\nLecture\n\nin-class\n\nINDL7330\n\nInternet Law and Governance Foundations\n\nInternet Law and Governance Foundations. This is the required foundational course module. It asks the questions \"what is cyberspace\" and \"what does it mean to govern in cyberspace?\" We will examine questions relating to jurisdiction, enforcement, democratic control, speech, and commerce from the early days of the Internet to the present. This study raises the basic questions addressed throughout all four modules: what is the relationship between \"liberty\" and \"security\" in cyberspace?\n\n1\n\nLecture\n\nin-class/online\n\nPRMD8215\n\nInterviewing and Counseling\n\nThrough interactive discussion, drills, and simulation exercises, this intensive three-day course offers students a basic model for interviewing and counseling, provides the opportunity to practice the skills involved, and exposes students to the kinds of problems and ethical issues that can arise in client counseling. Skills addressed in the interviewing segment include: active listening, question formulation, preliminary problem identification, recognizing legal and non-legal dimensions of a client’s problems, development of a chronological overview, theory development, and concluding the interview. The counseling segment addresses the process by which, having determined what the client's legal problems are, the lawyer helps the client make decisions by clarifying the client's objectives, identifying potential strategies and solutions and their likely consequences and, when appropriate, providing advice. The final day of class will address more advanced topics such as handling language and cultural barriers, working with translators, ethical issues that may arise in counseling, and assisting difficult clients.\n\nThe final grade is based on evidence of student preparation; active participation in class discussions, drills, and simulations; and on quality of interviewing and counseling simulations.\n\nCourse is graded High Pass, Pass, Low Pass or Fa"
