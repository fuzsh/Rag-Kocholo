        "text": "Hot Coffee, a documentary\n\nCar accident victim. Hurt in a slip/trip and fall. Injured by an uninsured motorist. In Michigan, accident victims are regularly deprived of their Constitutional rights. It is not fair and it is not just. You need a good car crash lawyer in Michigan to help you through this difficult time.\n\nThe McDonalds coffee case is one of the most famous instances of a personal injury lawsuit. People think they know what happened, but most don’t know the true story. They think it’s about frivolous lawsuits and our litigious society, but it’s not. Once people understand the extent of the injuries innocent victims suffer they start to think about things very differently.\n\nthe movie will be airing on HBO starting this week.\n\nFrom the movie’s website:\n\nSeinfeld mocked it. Letterman ranked it in his top ten list. And more than fifteen years later, its infamy continues. Everyone knows the McDonald’s coffee case. It has been routinely cited as an example of how citizens have taken advantage of America’s legal system, but is that a fair rendition of the facts?\n\nThe new documentary Hot Coffee reveals what really happened to Stella Liebeck, the Albuquerque woman who spilled coffee on herself and sued McDonald’s, while exploring how and why the case garnered so much media attention, who funded the effort and to what end. After seeing this film, you will decide who really profited from spilling hot coffee.\n\ncheck out the movie’s website here: http://hotcoffeethemovie.com/\n\nFilmmaker Susan Saladoff tells HBO why she decided to make a movie about an injured victim.\n\n“I practiced law for 25 years and knew that most people had a completely distorted view of our civil justice system. People are voting against their own self-interest or signing contracts without knowing what’s in them, and I wanted to make sure they knew what they were doing.”"
