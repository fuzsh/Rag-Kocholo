The documentary \"Hot Coffee\" examines the impact of tort reform through the lens of four legal cases, including Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants. In that case, Stella Liebeck suffered third degree burns after spilling McDonald's coffee between her legs. She sought $20,000 to cover medical costs but McDonald's only offered $800. At trial, it was shown the coffee was served at temperatures high enough to cause burns within seconds. Liebeck was awarded compensatory and punitive damages to deter McDonald's from similar conduct and compensate her losses, though the amounts were later reduced. The documentary explores how damage caps and mandatory arbitration have affected victims' ability to receive compensation through the civil justice system.",
