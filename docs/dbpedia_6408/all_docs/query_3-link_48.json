The Criminal Justice System continues to evolve as perceptions regarding judges, law enforcement officers and criminal attorneys (both prosecution and defense) change. This class will analyze how our sense of justice is formed and what it looks like in the actual practice of criminal law. The class will discuss the legal standards for arrest, charging, and conviction along with the ethical conduct required of prosecutors and defense attorneys. The goal of the class is to take a global view of the criminal justice system through a focus on policy and practice issues, using actual case specific facts. We will question and discuss the systemic issues in case outcomes, ethical prosecutorial charging and bargaining discretion, and sentencing -- aspects of the criminal process that affect huge volumes of cases and require more thought in global terms.\n\nPrerequisite: Criminal Law and prior or concurrent enrollment in Criminal Procedure\n\nFinal Assessment: Take-home exam\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nDiscussion - 3 hours. This course will be a semester long negotiation simulation intended to produce a multinational convention on a topic that is timely and meaningfully contributes to real-world discourse on the subject matter. We will begin by introducing the fundamentals of treaty and international agreement practice under U.S. and international law. Then students will go through the steps necessary to obtain authorization to initiate negotiations from the Secretary of State. This will be followed by written and oral simulation exercises for every stage of drafting, negotiating, problem-solving, and finally concluding a multinational convention. Students will get exposure to, among other things, the careful drafting of treaty provisions, the nuances of negotiation, and the strategic thinking that is essential to achieving conclusion of a complex international instrument.\n\nLaw 248 International Law is recommended\n\nFinal Assessment: Oral Exercises and Papers\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: Counts towards Professional Skills Requirement.\n\nLecture - Society’s expectations of companies are changing and companies are responding. Many companies go beyond compliance with the law to address environmental and social issues, from climate change to diversity. This new articulation of corporate purpose raises complex legal, ethical, and business questions. This class uses the case study method to examine this paradigm shift in the business and investment community. Each week we will analyze a particular company or business trend. The companies we will examine include Salesforce, Patagonia, Nike, Uber, Unilever, Amazon, ClifBar, and Clorox, among others. Students will get a “file” for each week which includes lectures, podcasts, and readings. Class time will be used primarily for discussion and debate.\n\nAttendance Policy: This class is very interactive and attendance is mandatory.\n\nPrerequisite: Prior or concurrent enrollment in Law 215 Business Associations\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nFinal assessment: Take home final will account for 60% of the grade. Other assessments include a brief written assignment (blog post), attendance and participation, and a group presentation.\n\nSeminar – 3 hours. Climate change is redefining the business and investment community's business norms and transforming traditional corporate law paradigms. This highly interactive seminar will use case studies to explore the current intersection of business law and climate risk. We will discuss and debate the following questions:1) Do corporate boards have a fiduciary duty to oversee climate risk? In all industries or only \"high impact\" ones?2) Will the evolution of \"green\" or sustainable investing minimize or exacerbate the impacts of climate change?3) What is the role of national and global securities regulators in the transition to a greener economy?4) How do existing corporate and securities laws enable and constrain the ability of boards and investors from mitigating the climate crisis?5) What corporate law reforms can address existing limitations?6) What is the role of local, national, and global governments in addressing the climate crisis through corporate law reforms?\n\nPrerequisite: Prior or concurrent enrollment in 215 Business Law\n\nFinal Assessment: Other – (series of papers and an oral argument)\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nSeminar – 3 units. The course will cover the fundamentals of the corporate governance theory, discussing the most important topics on a worldwide perspective focusing on the 2023 version of the “G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance”. We will discuss the challenges in the implementation of such principles depending on the characteristics of the region and other relevant factors. In this sense, students will assess some cases of countries where these difficulties are higher than others, as well as examples of good practices that have been implemented with success. Historical, social, political, economic, legal, and cultural factors will be discussed considering the wide background and origin of the students and the professor.\n\nFinal Assessment: Paper\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: May satisfy Advanced Writing Requirement with instructor's permission.\n\nSeminar – 2 units. As both an area of academic inquiry and legal practice, business law routinely undergoes rapid evolution and change. That dynamism has seen punctuated acceleration in recent years. Many of the fundamental precepts of business law have been critically interrogated, questioned, and litigated. This seminar seeks to expose students to these recent development in business law with a focus on modern issues in corporate law, securities, and antitrust. Students will leave the class with a better understanding of the issues in business law situated at the frontier of academic research and legal practice, as well as a better understanding of the pressure points in business law that can be expected to be the subject of future evolution and development. The course will be structured around a set of readings drawn from the academic literature, as well as more practice-oriented work. Student assessment will be based on a research paper to be presented to the class and in-class participation.\n\nPrerequisite: Law 215 or Law 215C Business Associations; prerequisite will not be waived.\n\nFinal Assessment: Paper\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: May satisfy Advanced Writing Requirement with instructor's permission.\n\nDiscussion - 2 units. This is an introductory course into the role of governance, risk management and compliance in business organizations. It will provide a foundational understanding of this increasingly growing and complex area, and of the common legal and regulatory frameworks underpinning effective corporate risk and compliance programs.\n\nThis course will examine the characteristics and elements of a good risk management and compliance program using case studies to understand effectiveness of compliance programs. Examples of case studies may include: Enron and the collapse of Arthur Anderson, Wells Fargo bank account scandal and subsequent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigation, Boeing 737 Max plane crashes and subsequent U.S. Justice Department’s Investigation. The course will also consider public policy and social responsibility issues as well.\n\nPre-requisite/Co-Requisite: Law 215 Business Associations\n\nFinal Assessment: Paper\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: May satisfy Advanced Writing Requirement with instructor's permission.\n\nDiscussion - 4 hours. This course principally covers the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause. The First Amendment materials and discussion involves an examination of freedom of speech and assembly: focusing on how the protection provided speech changes depending on the kind of speech that is regulated, the location where speech occurs, and the nature of the regulation that limits expression. The Equal Protection materials and discussion examine suspect class doctrine, including discrimination on the on the basis of race, gender, alienage and other characteristics, affirmative action, and the problem of invidious motive. State action doctrine will also be discussed.\n\nStudents who completed either Law 218(A) Constitutional Law II—Equal Protection or Law 218(B) Constitutional Law II—First Amendment may not take this course.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nDiscussion - 2 hours. Students who have previously taken Law 218, Constitutional Law II, or who plan to take Constitutional Law II for 4 units may not take this course. Students are not required to have taken Constitutional Law II- First Amendment to register for this course, although priority will be given to those students. This course focuses on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Class materials and discussion will examine, among other things, suspect class doctrine, including the judicial treatment of classifications based of race, gender, alienage, sexual orientation and other characteristics, so-called \"affirmative action,\" the constitutional treatment of laws and policies that have a disparate impact along racial or gender lines, and the related problem of invidious government motive. \"State action\" doctrine will also likely be discussed.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nStudents who have previously taken Law 218, Constitutional Law II, or who plan to take Constitutional Law II for 4 units may not take this course.\n\nLecture - 2 hours.

This course principally covers the free speech and religion clauses of the First Amendment. The course will cover issues relating to freedom of speech and the press: focusing on how the protection provided speech changes depending on the kind of speech that is regulated, the location where speech occurs, and the nature of the regulation that limits expression. It will also cover the free exercise of religion as well as the Establishment Clause: focusing on the circumstances in which religiously motivated conduct will be exempted from generally applicable laws, and the extent to which the Constitution permits religious institutions to receive government benefits.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nSeminar - This discussion-based course will focus on academic articles, mostly drawn from critical race and critical feminist traditions, that examine the theory and doctrine covered in 218A: Constitutional Law II--Equal Protection. The choice and sequence of readings will be tied to those assigned in 218A in order to create dialogue between Equal Protection doctrine and critical perspectives on that doctrine. Topics will include race, gender, and sexual orientation discrimination, affirmative action, disparate impact, and the erasure of Native Americans from the traditional Equal Protection canon.\n\nPrerequisite: Must be taken concurrently with 218A: Constitutional Law II--Equal Protection or, with permission of the instructor, by a student who has previously taken 218 or 218A.\n\nFinal Assessment: Other – (class presentations and reflection papers)\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: May satisfy Advanced Writing Requirement with instructor's permission.\n\nGraduation Requirements: Satisfies the Bias, Antiracism and Cultural-Competency requirement.\n\nDiscussion - 3 hours. Many of the most important developments in California law and politics have been the result of reforms made in 1911 granting voters the power of initiative, referendum, and recall. This course will explore how these mechanisms work, both in theory and in practice. We will study some of the most consequential initiatives in California history, focusing on the initiatives themselves, challenges to them, and how they have impacted law, public policy, and politics in California. We will then turn to the impact of the recall power on executive and judicial branch officials. Finally, we will take a step back and consider whether these tools of direct democracy have functioned as intended and explore whether they can be improved upon.\n\nPrerequisite: 205 Constitutional Law I\n\nGraduation Requirements: Counts towards Professional Skills Requirement.\n\nFinal Assessment: Students draft an initiative, title and summary, and arguments in favor and opposition for a class voter information guide.\n\nSeminar - 2 hours. Discrimination in the workplace has taken center stage in the country's legal and political arena. Despite extraordinary progress for women and minorities since the first state and federal anti-discrimination laws were enacted, we have recently seen an uptick in litigation, lawmaking, and government agency enforcement designed to address today's more subtle and nuanced forms of discrimination, including implicit bias. The goal of this course would be to analyze these modern forms of discrimination, evaluate the perspectives of both employers and employees, and explore effective ways to address these issues through the law.\n\nLaw 260 Employment Discrimination and/or Law 260A Employment Law is recommended but not required.\n\nFinal Assessment: Paper\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: May satisfy Advanced Writing Requirement with instructor's permission.\n\nLecture/Discussion - 3 or 4 hours. This course covers rules regarding the admissibility of testimonial and documentary proof during the trial of civil and criminal cases, including rules governing relevancy, hearsay, the examination and impeachment of witnesses, expert opinion, and constitutional and statutory privileges.\n\nThe 3-hour version of the course is a faster-paced course that will cover only the Federal Rules of Evidence, and students intending to do trial work in California are advised to take the 4-hour version.\n\nThe 4-hour version of the course covers primarily the Federal Rules of Evidence with some discussion of the California Evidence Code by comparison and reference\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam.\n\nDiscussion - 4 hours. There are no prerequisites, although this course is a prerequisite for most other tax courses. This course surveys the federal income tax system, with consideration of the nature of income, when and to whom income is taxable, exclusions from the tax base, deductions and credits, and tax consequences of property ownership and disposition. Our objective will be to explore and critically evaluate the concepts and policies underlying the federal income tax, as well as to learn to interpret the statutory provisions by which these concepts and policies are implemented.\n\nTaxes touch every aspect of our lives, from cradle to grave, from the child tax credit to what the ill-informed call the \"death\" tax. Taxes raise revenue, to be sure. But they also stimulate and stunt economic growth; redistribute and concentrate wealth; reward and punish families; influence and distort economic and social behavior. Indeed, taxes reflect and reinforce societal norms and values. Thus, while you will be exposed to the elegant and chaotic intricacies of the Internal Revenue Code (\"the Code\") in this class, you will also be exposed to the peculiarities of U.S. society, economics, politics, culture, and government. This course is geared to the future general practitioner as well as the future tax and business law specialist.\n\nThis course is not particularly numbers or math intensive and prior knowledge of accounting is not necessary (if you can add your fingers together, you'll be fine).\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nSeminar - 3 hours. This seminar presents tax policy as an exploration in public finance, politics, special interests, and sociology as well as a reflection of society’s biases, priorities, perceptions of distribution and redistribution, and justice in the most fundamental sense of fairness and opportunity. It embraces the view that tax law is constructed and contingent. And it exposes students to a generation of “critical tax” scholarship, which has been influenced by critical legal studies and its progeny, including critical race theory, feminist legal theory, and queer theory.\n\nThe course contains a writing requirement that students can satisfy in one of two ways: (i) four “reaction” papers (of at least 5 pages) on issues covered in class; or (ii) a long research paper (at least 20 pages excluding footnotes) on a topic that may or may not have been covered in class and that, at a student’s choosing, can qualify for the law school's upper-level writing requirement as well as the Tax and Business Certificates.\n\nFinal Assessment: Other: Participation, Presentation, Paper (s)\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: May meet Advanced Writing Requirement with the instructor's permission; Satisfies the Bias, Antiracism and Cultural-Competency requirement.\n\nSeminar – 2 hours. This course focuses on the practical and procedural aspects of tax controversy before state and federal tax authorities. We will provide a mix of theory and practical skills for students wishing to engage in controversy practice before the IRS and the various California tax agencies (FTB, CDTFA, BOE, and OTA). We will cover the entirety of the lifecycle of a tax controversy, beginning with the filing of a return through the completion of an audit and ending with administrative appeals or litigation. We will also cover settlement procedures and methods to achieve negotiated settlements in tax disputes. This course will also provide practice tips and go over the variety of tools that are available to assist the modern-day tax practitioners.\n\nPrerequisite/Co-requisite: Law 220 Federal Income Taxation.\n\nGraduation Requirements: May satisfy Advanced Writing Requirement with instructor's permission.\n\nFinal Assessment: Paper\n\nDiscussion - 2 hours. This streamlined version of Trusts, Wills, and Estates is designed for students who are mainly interested in taking the course to prepare for the bar exam. It covers the basics of intestate succession and the creation and interpretation of wills and trusts under the Uniform Probate Code and the California Probate Code. Although it does not delve deeply into these issues, it sets the stage for students to master them during the bar review period.\n\nDiscussion - 3 hours. The general public assumes that all lawyers can do two things: try a case and write a Will. Most lawyers can’t do either. This course is designed to rem­edy that situation in part by introducing students to the basics of estate planning and ad­min­is­tration. It should be taken by most students--if for no other reason than that it is a Bar course. The course will cover: the changing nature of the family; the law of intestate succession; statutory Family Protection schemes; re­stric­tions on Testation; the role, preparation and construction of Wills; the uses, cre­ation, construction and termination of Trusts; rudimentary tax consid­era­tions in the estate planning process; the use of future inter­ests and pow­ers of appointment; the mechanics of Estate Administration (in­clu­ding an examination of Probate and of alter­natives to Probate); the role and responsibil­ities of fiduciaries; the role of the attorney in the Estate Planning process; and the Rules of Profess­ional Respon­sibility as they apply to the estate attorney.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nLaboratory/Discussion - 2 hours. This hands-on, experiential course is designed to provide the students the practical skills and familiarity needed to practice law in the area of estate planning and probate/trust administration. Through discussion and drafting of documents, the students will learn the basic laws, practices, resources, and techniques commonly utilized today. The class will follow a typical estate planning client from initial client interview through end of life administration, enabling the students to draft actual estate plan documents including wills, trusts, powers of attorney, and transfer documents required to establish funds, and administer the estate plan during the client’s lifetime and then through post-mortem administration of the estate, including drafting formal probate and non-court administration documents. A series of related topics will be explored, including issues of capacity, elder abuse, end of life decision making, non-probate transfers of wealth, and litigation involving will/trust contests, creditor claims, recovery of assets, and accounting disputes.\n\nGraduation Requirements: Counts towards Professional Skills Requirement.\n\nPrerequisites: Trusts, Wills & Estates recommended.\n\nDiscussion - 2 hours. This course examines the relationship between racial power and the law. Contrary to the dominant legal paradigm which contends that racial subordination is a deviation from the liberal legal ideal, the Critical Race Theory movement views the U.S. legal apparatus as complicit in upholding white supremacy, capitalism and heteropatriarchy. We will begin the course by focusing on the origins of Critical Race Theory and its relationship to Critical Legal Studies. Throughout the semester, we will examine CRT's relationship with other radical legal movements, including Feminist Legal Theory and Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL), as well as evaluating critiques of CRT from the right. Course materials will include case law and theory, in addition to some legal history. As part of the class, students will attend and participate in the Aoki Center Interdisciplinary Research Seminar Series on Tuesdays from 12:00-1:00 PM, where a range of scholars will discuss their research.\n\nDiscussion - 3 hours. This course examines the relationship between racial power and the law through the lens of Critical Race Theory. As an intellectual movement that began in the late 20th century, Critical Race Theory has provided an oppositional perspective on race and racism that challenges traditional race discourses found in doctrinal and civil rights discussions. This seminar explores Critical Race Theory's contributions and limitations by examining its history, concepts, and applications to contemporary issues in law and society. Students will examine the role played by legal rules and doctrines in creating the conditions for persisting systems of racial subordination and privilege that shape people's lives. The seminar will also cover the intersections of race, class, gender, and sexuality and the ways in which law responds (or fails to respond) to discrimination along multiple dimensions of human identity. Special attention will be paid to contemporary theories of colorblindness and post-racialism and their roles in re-framing race and racism in the 21st century.\n\nGraduation Requirements: May satisfy Advanced Writing Requirement with instructor's permission; Satisfies the Bias, Antiracism and Cultural-Competency requirement.\n\nFinal Assessment: Paper\n\nDiscussion - 3 hours. This course examines the federal constitutional limits on government authority to gather evidence and investigate crime. Topics to be covered include Fourth Amendment limits on search, seizure, and arrest; the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination; and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. While the course emphasizes current law and the evolution of Supreme Court doctrine, it also considers related policy questions on the role of police in a democratic society.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nDiscussion - 4 hours. This course will focus primarily on criminal procedure at and after trial. It examines such topics as charging decisions and the grand jury, the right to counsel, discovery, plea bargaining, jury trials, double jeopardy, sentencing, and appeals. It will concentrate primarily on federal constitutional law with some coverage of state procedure. It is helpful to have taken Evidence but it is not required. The final grade will depend on the individual student’s class participation, a motions exercise, and a final exam.\n\nDiscussion - 3 hours. Introduction to fundamentals of statistical analysis and how statistical analysis is used in the law and public policy. Course goal is to help students become excellent consumers of statistical information and evidence. No prior background in statistics will be required or assumed. The class will begin by introducing students to the basic tools of statistical analysis (mean, variance, correlation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, etc). Thereafter, the course will cover various topics including how statistical evidence is used in legal cases (for example, employment discrimination cases, death penalty cases, antitrust cases) and how statistical evidence is used to make public policy arguments and decisions.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nDiscussion - 3 hours. Elective Course for Environmental Law Certificate Program. This course provides an overview of the structure and basic principles of international environmental law and policy. The course considers the challenge of addressing global environmental problems in a system characterized by multiple sovereign governments, the regulatory limitations of U.S. law, and the basic structure and principles of international environmental law, as well as substantive areas such as climate change, biodiversity and wildlife protection, and the intersection of international trade and the environment. The course grade for this class is based primarily on a student paper and also has a significant class participation component.\n\nPrior course work in International Law (248) and/or Environmental Law (285) is helpful, but not required.\n\nFinal Assessment: Paper\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: Satisfies Advanced Writing Requirement.\n\nSeminar - 1 hour. The wine industry is the subject of intense activity in many legal subject areas, including constitutional law, intellectual property, environmental and land use regulation, trade protectionism, and internet commerce. This reading group is designed to serve as an introduction to this complex legal landscape. We will focus specifically on examining America's complicated relationship with the wine industry. We will chart the country's early support for wine, the moral and religious fervor that resulted in Prohibition, and the governmental controls that followed Repeal. We will end the course with an examination of the broader contemporary regulation of alcohol and drugs. Students will complete a series of written reactions to the weekly readings.\n\nFinal Assessment: None\n\nDiscussion - 3 hours. This course will examine the legal and social regulation of sexual orientation and gender identity. The course will analyze various legal principles, including statutory, constitutional, and public policy doctrines, which might be used to limit the ability of government and other institutions to disadvantage people because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. We will look at how courts have used these doctrines to help - or to harm - lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals in critical aspects of their lives including employment, schools, family relationships, and parenting.\n\nFinal Assessment: Paper\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: May meet Advanced Writing Requirement with the instructor's permission.\n\nSeminar - 2 hours. When surveyed, Americans consistently report high confidence and trust in the United States Military and service members. This trust and confidence has come from a history of devotion to the defense of the United States, which includes a culture of teamwork and discipline. To this end, the military has developed laws and regulations tailored to the unique mission. As the United States has seen social change, these unique laws and regulations can be at odds with or promote change within our society. This course will look at social change in the areas of race, gender, and LGBTQ identity though the eyes of military law and regulation. The course will explore those area where the military promoted positive change and where it hindered change. Students will have the opportunity to analyze the issues using military law, provide their personal perspective, and discuss ideas for change.\n\nFinal Assessment: Paper and Presentation\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: May satisfy Advanced Writing Requirement with instructor's permission\n\nSkills – 2 units. In this course students will learn from discussion and practice about the range of ways that law, regulation, and government action impact transgender and nonbinary identities. Discussion will be informed by and prepare students for interactions with clients in the student-run Gender and Name Change Project (GNCP). Over the course of the semester, students will be asked to examine specific areas of law that intersect with the name and gender change process, including identification documents, health care, parenting, immigration, employment, criminal legal system involvement, and special circumstances faced by young people under the age of majority. Students will be asked to read and prepare case studies for class meetings. Additionally, students will participate in monthly name and gender change clinics. Clinic components include developing client relationships, performing intakes, and preparing name and gender change forms under attorney supervision. Course credit will be based on biweekly discussion sections (2 hours every other week) and approximately 6 hours of Clinic preparation and participation throughout the month. Prior coursework related to gender and sexuality is recommended. Prior participation in the name and gender change clinic as a 1L counselor is required; or similar demonstrated commitment to and experience working with transgender and nonbinary clients. The course will have limited enrollment. Students already registered in a clinic or planning an externship for the spring 2024 semester may enroll in this practicum after consultation and permission from Dean Scivoletto.\n\nFinal Assessment: Other – (Combination of paper and skills assessment)\n\nGraduation Requirements: Counts towards Professional Skills Requirement.\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nSeminar - 3 hours. This seminar will cover some of the bedrock legal principles that inform U.S. asylum and refugee laws, policies and practices in the last 50 years. Informed by international norms, the U.S. adopted its domestic legal regime in this area of law in the 1980s. Through significant advocacy and litigation, asylum and refugee protections expanded over decades to include victims of persecution by non-state actors. The U.S. also retracted important protections based on national security, fraud, floodgate concerns, and most recently, pandemic. At the same time, ongoing global crisis and unrests continue to push new waves of forced migration adding to a backlog of displaced persons, many of whom fall outside existing asylum and refugee protections. We study the transformation of this area of the law and the strategies and efforts to preserve and expand protections.\n\nLaw 235 Administrative Law and 292 Immigration Law and Procedure are recommended\n\nFinal Assessment: Paper\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: Satisfies the Bias, Antiracism and Cultural-Competency requirement.\n\nThis course is a foundation course for the immigration law certificate and satisfy the writing requirement for the certificate and/or the advanced writing requirement.\n\nSeminar - 2 units. Forced displacement is a phenomenon that can occur within a nation’s borders or across international borders. By far the largest trend of forced displacement is internal. Under international law, a person’s crossing of an international border is legally significant. Refugees (and asylum seekers) especially are protected by important international treaties, including the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. In addition, humanitarian laws or the laws of war, human rights treaties, and other specialized treaties seek to prevent forced displacement or dictate protections when these do occur, including the right of return. And while there is also an important emerging body of norms focused on IDPs, in general, the more widely accepted international norms focus on nation’s obligations to safeguard the right of people forced to flee their homes to seek protection in another country.\n\nThis course will focus on five active (meaning these are ongoing situations) case studies involving the plight of five people who have been forced to flee their homes either due to civil or international wars or based on significant internal human rights violations or climate change. This course studies five of the largest displacements of people in the world today. I selected these cases studies based on the scope and their regional diversity, in addition to their relevance to U.S. interests and degree of U.S. involvement. Based on these criteria: Our focus will turn to: Afghanistan (Central Asia); East Horn of Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia), Palestinians (Middle East), and Ukraine (Eastern Europe), Venezuela (the Americas).\n\nRecommended pre or co-requites can include Asylum and Refugee Law and Human Rights\n\nFinal Assessment: Final Paper\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: May satisfy Advanced Writing Requirement with instructor's permission; Satisfies the Bias, Antiracism and Cultural-Competency requirement.\n\nThis course satisfies the immigration certificate and may be used to satisfy the writing requirement for the certificate and/or the advanced writing requirement.\n\nSeminar – 2 hours. Much of our modern federal government relies on administrative agencies exercising authority delegated to them by Congress. Federal courts have traditionally deferred to agencies’ implementation of the statutes they administer, although these courts also set aside (or “vacate”) agency actions they find to be unlawful. In recent years, however, several justices on the U.S. Supreme Court have openly called for revisiting several administrative law doctrines that underlie this system. They have questioned, for example: Congress’s constitutional capacity to delegate regulatory authority to federal agencies, whether courts should defer to agencies’ interpretations of statutes, and whether a district court has the power to strike down unlawful agency actions. Each of these topics may have profound implications for the separation of powers and the practice of law in fields ranging from immigration to financial regulation to the environment and public health. And debates over these topics are playing out, in real time, in the Supreme Court. This course will critically assess each of these topics, exploring the existing doctrines’ origins and seeking to understand arguments both for and against revisiting them.\n\nGraduation Requirements: May satisfy Advanced Writing Requirement with instructor's permission.\n\nFinal Assessment: Paper\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nDiscussion - 2 hours. This course uses history to answer the question, “Why does the United States have the legal system that it does?” Why do we operate under the common law rather than the civil law? How have legal rules and institutions changed over time? The course traces the development of the common law from its origins in medieval England through the twentieth-century. Topics include the development of substantive doctrine in areas such as property, contract, and torts; the development of civil and criminal procedure; the rise of the jury trial; the role of judges; the history of the legal profession and legal education; and the origins of constitutional government in England.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nSeminar - 2 hours. The history of Athenian democracy is entwined with our own – often as the negative example that our founders wished to avoid in designing our political institutions. This critical view of Athenian democracy, and particularly its lawlessness, largely derived from the critical views of contemporary elite authors, such as Plato. More recent analysis of Athenian democracy has demonstrated that in fact the democracy was a success across many dimensions and that it was particularly lawful rather than lawless. This observation raises a number of important questions that we will address in this class. The Athenian legal system was very different from our own and in particular was far less formal. How did it work and why did it work? More profoundly, why have political and legal theorists misunderstood Athens for so long and what can we learn from that failure?\n\nFinal Assessment: Take-home exam\n\nDiscussion. Satisfies Professional Skills Requirement. The focus of this interactive course is on attorney representation of clients in mediation. Through reading, discussion, role play, and interaction with local practitioners, students will develop the ability to effectively combine advocacy skills and collaborative problem-solving tools, learning to think and act strategically from the beginning of any dispute.\n\nMediation has become an integral part of the litigation process. At both the trial and appellate levels, court-sanctioned mediation programs have become the rule rather than the exception. In some cases, mediation is strongly encouraged. In others, participation is ordered by the court. In still other contexts, wise attorneys may be able to utilize the mediation process to resolve disputes in ways that leave their clients with greater satisfaction than they could have achieved through trial. As a result, becoming an expert in the use of mediation is essential to effective client representation. The course will examine (1) ethical issues in representing clients in mediation, (2) practical issues in preparing both the case and the client for mediation, and (3) strategies involved in representing clients effectively in a mediation session.Students will be graded on preparation, participation, and several short papers. Class limit: 24 students.\n\nDiscussion - 2 hours. This two-credit, skills-based course will offer students hands-on training in the fundamentals of negotiation and mediation, in the specific context of federal court-sponsored mediation. Although it is hardly news that most of today’s law school graduates will spend far more time negotiating than they will trying cases, the need for ADR training continues to outstrip supply. There is a particular need for trained negotiators and mediators in federal court, where it can take a half-decade for civil litigants to reach the courtroom. Increasingly, federal courts are not only encouraging parties to take advantage of court-sponsored mediation, but are mandating it. And mediation in federal court presents particular, recurring issues, including assigned mediators (i.e., not chosen by parties), mediator-judges, rules set by court order, strict time constraints, sophisticated parties with entrenched positions, and less straightforward confidentiality protections than under state law. This course will begin with fundamental concepts, including an analysis of why negotiated resolutions can make economic sense. We will then use simulations, lectures, and reading assignments to build students’ understanding. Students will have the opportunity to draft, and to receive feedback on, mediation statements. In the later portion of the course, as students’ skills grow, we will consider the role of irrationality and critical perspectives.\n\nFinal Assessment: Paper\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: Counts towards Professional Skills Requirement.\n\nSeminar - 2 hours. This seminar will explore the right to vote under the U.S. Constitution and Voting Rights Act of 1965. The course will explore voter eligibility issues that are brought to light by current social movements such as Black Lives Matter and immigrant rights movements. Students will learn about contemporary voting rights issues including efforts to both expand and suppress the vote; efforts to eliminate noncitizens in the U.S. Census and redistricting processes; and efforts to dilute the vote through redistricting and gerrymandering. Students in the seminar will learn how apportionment, gerrymandering and redistricting are affected by VRA claims; and how current discussions over voting procedures (e.g., mail-in ballots, voter ID laws) affect VRA protections. Students will demonstrate their knowledge through activities such as creating redistricting maps; writing activities about specific policies and procedures; and class participation. This course will be held in conjunction with students from Texas A&M Law School, and will concentrate on comparative voting rights issues in Texas and California.\n\nPrerequisites: None\n\nFinal Assessment: summative memo, writing assignments throughout the semester, and class participation will make up the grade for the semester.\n\nThis course will be taught as an accelerated course.

This seminar investigates the right to vote as a matter of constitutional and statutory law, with particular emphasis on the voting rights of racial and ethnic minorities, and the relationships among law, electoral structures, and the risk of authoritarianism. It covers the Warren Court cases that established the right to vote as a fundamental right under the Equal Protection clause; the emergence and transformation of the right of racial minorities to an “undiluted” vote under the Equal Protection clause and the federal Voting Rights Act; and the limits of the non-dilution principle, as reflected in partisan gerrymandering cases. Finally, we consider the law of disputed elections, and the incentives of candidates and co-partisan legislators to accept and legitimate their own losses.\n\nPrerequisites: None.

This course investigates the constitutional and statutory frameworks that channel and regulate the efforts of individuals, corporate and nonprofit entities, and political groups to convey their ideas to the electorate, to mobilize voter turnout, and to get their preferred candidates on the ballot and elected to office. We will examine the legal status of contributions and expenditures of money and other goods—whether directly to candidates, or through intermediary political groups—and the line between political influence and political corruption. We will also consider political groups’ claims to autonomy with respect to their “internal” affairs, to autonomy in the selection of nominees for elective office, and to a place on the ballot for their nominees.\n\nPrerequisites: None. (This course may be taken before or after “Election Law: Voting Rights.”)\n\nGraduation Requirements: May satisfy Advanced Writing Requirement with instructor's permission.\n\nFinal Assessment: Summative memo, reading response papers, and class participation.\n\nThis course will examine the process of selecting Presidents of the United States within the structure created by Article II and other provisions of the U.S. Constitution, as well as federal and state enactments. Among the topics to be considered are: the creation of the electoral college and modern reform possibilities; so-called \"faithless\" electors; the Bush v. Gore dispute; the so-called \"Independent State Legislature\" theory; presidential succession; vice-presidential selection; Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and various presidential immunities that might bear on ability to serve. The course will examine, among other things, Supreme Court caselaw, academic commentary and state-law reform efforts.\n\nPrerequisite: Law 205 Constitutional Law I is required.\n\nLaw 218 Constitutional Law II is recommended.\n\nClassroom Policies: This course has a participation policy.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: Satisfies the Bias, Antiracism and Cultural-Competency requirement.\n\nLecture/Discussion - 2 or 3. The course starts with an overview of the law of debt collection when the debtor is not in bankruptcy, including both the tools for collection and some of the restrictions on use of those tools. It then moves into Chapter 7 individual bankruptcy, where the debtor's nonexempt property is liquidated for the benefit of creditors and debts are discharged. This is the simplest and most common type of bankruptcy. It then covers Chapter 13 individual bankruptcy, in which the debtor keeps their property but must complete a payment plan to discharge debts. Finally, it addresses several aspects of business bankruptcy in Chapter 11, which is designed to allow businesses to restructure debts by proposing plans on which creditors vote. Students should be aware that basic math (through fractions and percentages) is used extensively in bankruptcy and will come up a lot in class. The final will require some calculations (calculator allowed).\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nSeminar - 2 hours. Course offers an overview of the constitutional law governing the death penalty in the United States with an emphasis on Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.

A study of the subject-matter jurisdiction of federal courts. The constitutional and statutory grants of authority to federal courts to adjudicate actions arising under federal law or between parties of diverse citizenship are examined in contemporary detail and from the perspectives of history and the Constitution. The course begins with a close examination of the scope and sources of the rules governing the jurisdiction of the federal district courts, and proceeds to develop a general theory of federal jurisdiction that includes federal appellate jurisdiction, writs of habeas corpus, abstention, justiciability, and state sovereign immunity. Fundamentally this course seeks to elaborate the constitutional themes of separation of powers and federalism as guides to critical understanding and evaluation of the Supreme Court's leading cases on the scope of federal jurisdiction.\n\nPrerequisite: 205 Constitutional Law I.\n\nClassroom Policies: This course has a no-laptop policy.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nDiscussion- 2 hours.

Topics to be covered include natural law, legal positivism and legal realism. The readings related to this question will be drawn primarily from legal philosophy. The second (related) question to be considered is: What are the main traditions in current American legal thought as to the role of law in society? Topics to be surveyed include law and economics, critical legal studies and formalism. The readings related to this second question will be drawn primarily from legal academics. Coverage of the first question will occupy approximately two-thirds of the class, though the two questions overlap considerably.\n\nFinal Assessment: Take-home exam.\n\nDiscussion - 3 hours. In today’s world, disputes increasingly involve foreign parties, foreign laws, and foreign courts. Such disputes raise questions that go beyond those covered in the first-year course on Civil Procedure. This course explores the resolution of international disputes involving private parties, with a focus on doctrines that apply in U.S. courts. Topics covered include jurisdiction, foreign sovereign immunity, the act of state doctrine, service of process abroad, parallel litigation, the discovery of evidence abroad, choice of law, extraterritoriality, the enforcement of foreign judgments, and international commercial arbitration. Because the course assumes familiarity with the topics covered in Civil Procedure, students who have not taken that course must obtain the permission of the instructor to enroll.\n\nPrerequisite: Civil Procedure or instructor consent.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nDiscussion - 3 hours. International Public Interest Law and Advocacy is a proposed new simulation course to introduce students to the applied legal and policy skills necessary to become effective lawyers and advocates in the international public interest/non-governmental organization community. The course will use individual and group roleplaying exercises and written assignments that will require students to plan and execute legal and policy campaigns to influence multilateral negotiations, international organizations, individual governments, and the public. Non-Governmental Organizations are important actors in shaping international law and policy. Students will participate in several individual and group roleplaying scenarios to guide them in thinking strategically about the most effective ways to affect governments (multilaterally and individually) and public opinion on issues of great international consequence. The course will consider several approaches to achieving these goals: (1) national and international litigation; (2) national and international lobbying campaigns; (3) mobilization of worldwide public opinion (using traditional media, social media, civil disobedience, etc.).\n\nFinal Assessment: Other – Simulations/Paper\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading.\n\nGraduation Requirements: Counts towards Professional Skills Requirement.\n\nSeminar - 3 hours. This seminar considers rural manifestations of various legal, social and economic phenomena. We will survey various subfields of legal study, e.g., criminal justice, poverty, environment and land use, local government, family, constitutional, agricultural, access to justice, as they relate to the rural-urban continuum. We will debate rurality as an aspect of identity and consider its intersections with race, gender, sexuality, (dis)ability and other identity variables.\n\nOur multi-disciplinary approach will feature scholarly literature in law, rural sociology, geography, and other fields. Readings will also include reports from reputable media sources, and we will view and discuss excerpts from movie and television programs depicting rural people and places. We will consider various aspects of rural-urban difference, along with the challenges of getting law-makers and policy-makers to attend to these differences. All of these tools will be used to debate current events that have particular implications for rural people and places, e.g., Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, deaths of despair, abortion regulation, and work requirements for public benefits.\n\nPlease note: students who have already taken the White Working Class and the Law Seminar are not eligible to take this course.\n\nFinal Assessment: Other (Students may write a final paper or they may write for the course blog or in other formats).\n\nGraduation Requirements: May meet Advanced Writing Requirement with the instructor's permission; Satisfies the Bias, Antiracism and Cultural-Competency requirement.\n\nClassroom Policies: This course has a no-laptop policy.\n\nGrading Mode: Letter grading.\n\nDiscussion - 2 hours. Legislative Drafting at UC Davis School of Law provides practical experience in researching, analyzing, and drafting legislative measures in the State of California, including bills, resolutions, and constitutional amendments. The course is one semester in length, offered during the fall semester, and worth 2 credits. The course is offered to both 2Ls and 3Ls, with priority going to 3Ls. This is a skills-based course for students to be trained in drafting and amending legislative measures. As such, we have a limit of 12 students.\n\nLegislative drafting is a particular genre of legal writing. It has been called the most difficult form of legal writing because it often addresses complex, societal problems. This course will provide insight into the California legislative process and students will develop extensive research and writing skills related to legislative drafting. They will engage in constitutional and statutory research, including federal and state laws, and draft and revise legislative measures. Students will read and study about the theoretical and practical aspects of legislative drafting, how statutory law is created, constitutional limits to lawmaking, and more. This academic work will be combined with a few guest speakers and numerous drafting exercises, with at least one drafting assignment due each week throughout the semester.\n\nAmong the goals of the course are for students to gain a deeper understanding of the state legislative process, legislative drafting, theories of statutory interpretation, and constitutional restrictions on lawmaking, and to develop the tools needed to craft effective legislation. Drafting guidelines and techniques are studied and applied in practical exercises each class.\n\nLaw 257 Legislative Process is recommended, but not required.\n\nGraduation Requirements: Counts towards Professional Skills Requirement.\n\nFinal Assessment: Take-home\n\nDiscussion - 2 or 3 hours. This course covers the ethical duties of lawyers in a variety of different contexts. Students will examine topics such as client control over the major decisions in a case, the duty of zealous advocacy, representation of organizations, and the unique role of government attorneys. This course will also cover the American Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct and the California Rules of Professional Conduct, which are tested (respectively) on the MPRE and the California Bar Exam. Students who take Law 258A Legal Ethics and Corporate Practice are not eligible to enroll in this course.\n\nGraduation Requirements: Satisfies the Professional Responsibility graduation requirement.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nDiscussion - 3 hours. This course explores the formal rules of ethics governing the legal profession, including the affirmative duties reflected in different states’ Rules of Professional Conduct (RPCs), which, in turn, largely reflect the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct. These rules are tested on state bar exams and the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam (MPRE). We discern how the RPCs in various jurisdictions differ, particularly with respect to the California RPCs. Furthermore, we apply these different rules to real-life situations encountered on the above examinations and in your legal practices, particularly in the context of working for and within organizations, by far the most common attorney-client relationship.\n\nStudents who take Law 258/258H Professional Responsibility are not eligible to enroll in this course.\n\nGraduation Requirements: Satisfies the Professional Responsibility requirement.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nSkills – 1 unit - This course will introduce students to the practice of conscious lawyering, including concepts in professional and personal identity, self-awareness, focus, emotional intelligence, cultural and personal values, mindfulness, meditation, and mind-body connection. This course will help train students to be mindful and aware while engaging in the practice of law including litigation, negotiations, transactional deals, client management, and day-to-day work in a law practice.\n\nStudent learning in this course will be supported by assigned readings, discussion and practice of the skills taught, including somatic breathwork and meditation. Students will read a selection of supporting materials each week and come to class ready to discuss and put the reading into practice. Students will also respond to weekly prompts on Canvas in order to demonstrate synthesis of the material and to document their experiences. Students should be prepared that the practices in this course may involve non-sexual touching of hands (e.g. handshake, “high-five”, holding of hands) and/or ritualistic or socially accepted expressions of gratitude (e.g. pat on the shoulder, hug or embrace, light touch on the arm).\n\nThis course is graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory (“pass/fail”) basis primarily due to the personal and subjective nature of the course. Therefore, attendance and meaningful participation in the readings, practice and writing exercises will be required to complete the course satisfactorily.\n\nClassroom Policies: This course has an attendance policy.\n\nClassroom Policies: This course has a participation policy.\n\nGrading Mode: Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory\n\nFinal Assessment: Small papers each week\n\nGraduation Requirements: Counts towards Professional Skills Requirement.\n\nLecture - 3 units.

This course provides an overview of employment law, labor law and employment discrimination law and aims to serve as a foundation for understanding the law and policy (statutory and common law) that surround the employer-employee relationship. Rather than focusing on the various statutes that govern workplace relationships, this course is organized topically around the areas that tend to create tensions between employer and employee interests. The course will focus on the interests of the parties as much or more than their legal rights as they currently exist in the law. The questions we focus on in this course include the following:How should law mediate conflicts between employer and employee rights?What is the significance of constructing disputes as individual versus collective? What is the effect of increasing racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in the workplace on law and policy? Is law the most effective way of mediating employer and employee interests? What is the role of organizing, self-help efforts, and other employee initiatives?\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nSeminar – 2 units.

What can we learn from the way other countries or legal institutions (such as international courts) decide cases? How can the knowledge of other legal systems and methods of adjudication inform the understanding of the US legal system? How can this knowledge help lawyers who will practice in an international context (foreign clients, international litigation, practice of law abroad, interaction with foreign professionals, etc.)?\n\nFinal Assessment: Paper\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: May satisfy Advanced Writing Requirement with instructor's permission; Satisfies the Bias, Antiracism and Cultural-Competency requirement.\n\nSeminar - 2 hours. This seminar is devoted to in-depth coverage of various state and federal environmental laws and their relationship to federal constitutional principles that are increasingly invoked by regulated persons and business groups to block, narrow or invalidate the application of those environmental laws. Constitutional principles we’ll be examining in an environmental/natural resources setting include the Supremacy Clause (federal preemption); the Takings Clause (private property rights); the scope of federal authority under the Commerce Clause; Dormant Commerce Clause principles; the Privileges & Immunities Clause; and the Foreign Affairs Doctrine and Treaty Clause. These related seminar topics will include integrated study and analysis of legal, policy, scientific and governance issues affecting the natural resources in question. Enrolled students are expected to regularly attend class sessions, and oral participation will be factored into students’ final course grades.\n\nElective course for Environmental Certificate Program.\n\nPrerequisite: 285 Environmental Law or 256 Land Use Planning are recommended but not required.\n\nFinal Assessment: Final Paper\n\nDiscussion - 3 units.

These topics include attachment and perfection of security interests in personal property and general principles of negotiability. The primary goals of the course are to provide students with foundational knowledge and understanding of several articles of the UCC and improve students problem-solving skills in this area. Accordingly, this course will be taught with an emphasis on solving problems. Cases are used to supplement the problems, but the main focus is on solving problems utilizing the UCC.\n\nLaw 202 Contracts is recommended.\n\nFinal Assessment: Final exam\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nSeminar - 2 hours. This course examines from a globalized perspective a broad range of internet governance issues, ranging from free speech ideologies, criminal speech regulations, copyright, digital intermediary liability, administrative censorship online, online anonymity regulation, “right to be forgotten”, privacy and data protection, net neutrality, MLAT, cybersecurity, intersection with AI, etc., drawing from established cases and practices of constitutional law, antitrust law, communications law, and international human rights/economic law around the world. Unlike the mainstream scholarship which focuses on the gap between the U.S. jurisprudence and international human rights law, the seminar attempts to identify a globally consistent set of theories and arguments that have gained normative and prescriptive traction in the relevant regional or international debates. This course will prepare students for a career in international media/digital law practice. Grading will be based 90% on a final paper and 10% on class participation (NO CURVE).

Artificial intelligence (\"A.I. \") plays an increasingly prominent role in our lives and multiplies our ability to innovate and produce. But if society fails to create meaningful legal rules for A.I., innovation can come at a high cost for individuals' rights and liberties. This course looks at A.I.'s seemingly infinite possibilities and discusses where should the legal boundaries begin and end, including: What risks should be evaluated and mitigated when building A.I. systems? Who should \"own\" the knowledge derived from personal information, and how should it be used? What rights should individuals have in the context of A.I.? This course's core lecturing centers on the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and the proposed E.U. A.I.

This seminar course will provide a survey of key California environmental law and policy issues. Those issues include the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA); coastal planning and regulation; renewable energy law and policy; California's leadership role regarding the law of global warming/climate change; property rights and the environment; the ecosystem crisis affecting the California Delta; Proposition 65 (the Safe Drinking Water & Toxic Enforcement Act); the public trust doctrine; and environmental federalism (i.e., the respective California and federal roles in environmental regulation). A special feature of this course will be a number of guest speakers on the above topics, including practicing environmental attorneys, judges, policymakers and non-legal experts (e.g., scientists and economists). The course grade for this class will be based primarily on a student paper, in lieu of a final exam. The course will likely include a field trip to UC Davis’ Tahoe Environmental Research Center at Lake Tahoe to bring students into direct contact with some of the resources and issues being studied.\n\nClassroom Policies: This course has an attendance policy.\n\nSeminar - 2 hours. Emerging technologies such as genetic engineering, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, and geoengineering have the potential to transform lives, economic systems, and entire societies. The health and environmental risks and uncertainties associated with these technologies also pose novel and fascinating challenges for regulators. Existing laws, domestic and international, in some instances offer a starting point for managing risk and uncertainty, but often constitute an imperfect fit. Emerging technologies present new and unanticipated circumstances, and their rapid development frequently outpaces the ability of legislators and regulators to respond. This course will examine legal regimes that might apply to various emerging technologies and consider governance mechanisms and reforms that might enable more foresighted and participatory development and management of technology. Students will do extensive reading of cases, statutes, treaties, and scholarly analyses. Each student will write a 25-page research paper on a topic of emerging technology regulation.\n\nGraduation Requirements: Satisfies Advanced Writing Requirement.\n\nSkills - 2 hours. Drafting a Solar Farm Bill is a practicum in which the class acts as an advisory law firm for its client, a solar farm bill solution and its facilitator, the educational non-profit Climate Solutions Advocacy Institute (CSAI). The class objective is to provide the client with a white paper that can advise CSAI in its development of a massive solar farm bill, financed by green bonds. Students in this class will work together like attorneys providing advice to a client by acting as investigator, organizer and evaluator of the key modular elements needed for a solar farm bill: green bond financing, regulatory oversight, power purchase agreements and land leasing. Students will investigate other renewable energy projects in the USA and abroad, as well as business agreements between solar farm operators, utilities, and land owners. They will consult with legislators & legislative experts, and incorporate feedback from various stakeholders, advancing their knowledge of legal investigation, collaboration and memo drafting.

Public health law, seen broadly, is the government's power and responsibility to ensure the conditions for the population's health. The use of this power results in a series of trade-offs between the collective good of public health and the individual's interests in liberty and property. We will look at the debate over paternalism, as well as issues raised by methods such as surveillance, health education campaigns, immunization and testing, quarantine, and criminal prosecution. We will do case studies of specific topics, including issues related to the response of government and public health officials to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nSeminar – 2 units. As California moves into its second decade of criminal justice reform, we now turn our focus to how those with mental health conditions interact with law enforcement and the justice system. This class will explore the work of crisis intervention teams, collaborative courts, and California's new CARE courts. Our effort will build on a foundational study of competency, insanity, protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act, hospital holds, forced medication, and conservatorships. Special attention will be given to children and the elderly. The class is a broad survey of the law as it relates to mental health and the courts. It is designed to educate future leaders on how to better serve those with mental health needs, their families, and our communities.\n\nFinal Assessment: Paper\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nGraduation Requirements: Satisfies Advanced Writing Requirement.\n\nSeminar - 3 hours. In this course, students will take on the role of Justices of, and advocates before, the Supreme Court of the United States. The 16 students in the course will be divided up into two panels of 8 Associate Justices (with the instructor to serve as the Chief for both panels). The course will begin with a short unit on the certiorari process, the crucial procedure through which the Supreme Court decides the cases it will hear. Each panel will review the materials for a case pending before the Court at the certiorari stage and debate whether to grant review.\n\nThe course will then transition to our primary undertaking: a series of between four and eight oral arguments involving actual cases before the Supreme Court. The cases will involve a mix of statutory and constitutional issues, as well as criminal and civil issues. Between two and four students will argue each case to the panel of Justices on which they do not sit. Arguments will be based on the briefs that have already been filed in the Court as well at least one class session previewing and preparing students for the substance of each case. After argument, the panels of Justices will meet to vote on argued cases, with the instructor assigning majority and dissenting opinions for each case. The written opinions will represent the final work product for the class, and constitute the primary portion of each student’s grade.\n\nClassroom Policies: This course has a no-laptop policy.\n\nFinal Assessment: Skill Class Final Assignment (e.g. Trial, Mediation, Brief)\n\nGraduation Requirements: May satisfy the Advanced Writing Requirement OR count towards the Professional Skills Requirement, student must choose one.\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nLecture - 2 hours. This course explores the what and how of national security. Specifically, what does national security mean and how does it play out institutionally, jurisprudentially, and policy-wise in the United States? Combining historical, legal, and normative perspectives, this seminar explores how the meaning of national security has shifted and expanded over time. Rather than being exclusively limited to notions of war and foreign policy, the concept of national security also intersects with a wide-range of domestic legal and policy issues, from civil rights and immigration, to private law, business, and environmental and economic issues. Instead of presenting a rigid notion of national security, this course aims to chart the term’s complexity, malleability, and capacity to serve ends that are both corrosive and supportive of the public good.\n\nPrerequisites: Constitutional Law. A prior law course or background in Public International Law is recommended\n\nClassroom Policies: This course has a participation policy\n\nFinal Assessment: Simulation exercises and written assignments\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nSeminar - 2 hours. While there is no fixed definition of privacy, most experts would agree that technology now makes it easier than ever for private and public actors to exploit it. Our personal information can be found in massive databases as well as in multiple places on the Internet. Not only do advertisers, creditors, and employers want this information, so do law enforcement agencies. This course examines several topics that arise in field of information privacy law, with a special emphasis on government access to this information.\n\nPrerequisite: 227A Criminal Procedure is recommended.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nGrading Mode: Please note: Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory\n\nDiscussion - 3 hours. China has become factory to the world, India its back office, and the United States its information intermediary. Our lives are increasingly intertwined with international trade.

The business of professional sports has evolved significantly over the past decade, driven by both urban development trends, along with an explosion in technology, and social change. These forces, along with others, have dramatically influenced the economic shape and arc of professional sports teams, which in turn impacts all aspects of professional sports. This course focuses on providing the students with a basic understanding of (1) how sports teams are legally structured, (2) the diversification of business lines (e.g., real estate, hospitality, non-profits, venture capital, marketing), (3) the role, structure, and importance of the arena/facility as the modern community campfire, (4) legal areas of focus (e.g., contracts, intellectual property, finance, legislation, and risk management), and (5) the cutting edge legal issues on the sports landscape today (e.g., music license rights and sports betting).\n\nLaw 215 Business Associations is recommended\n\nFinal Assessment: Paper\n\nGrading Mode: Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory\n\nLecture - This course examines the law surrounding art and cultural heritage. The focus will be on copyright, cultural property, and cultural heritage laws. Students will have the opportunity to consider U.S. law, international regulation, and the laws of other countries in order to broaden their perspectives on the issues, explore what the United States and other countries can learn from each other to improve the status of art and culture, and grapple with the cross-border dimensions of problems such as art forgery, theft or illicit export of cultural property, and the restoration of artworks confiscated during World War II. The class will also explore interdisciplinary perspectives, considering the issues involved for artists, cultural institutions such as museums, and the local, national, and international public. Finally, it will consider the implications of technology, including digitization and the advent of innovations such as 3D printing, for this area.\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nFinal Assessment: Take-home exam\n\nDiscussion. This course will introduce students to a wide variety of alternative dispute resolution procedures, with an emphasis on negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. Although basic skills and effective strategies for each procedure will be discussed, the course will focus primarily on the laws and policies that affect how the procedures are structured and conducted. Successful completion of the course will prepare students for the widespread availability and growing popularity of ADR in almost every area of modern legal practice.\n\nClassroom Policies (Instructor expected to elaborate on Syllabus): This course has an attendance policy.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nDiscussion - 2 hours. This course will provide students with an introduction to the theory and practice of international arbitration--the preferred method of dispute-resolution in international business. We will start by developing a sound working knowledge of the principal international treaties and national laws that undergird the international arbitral system and will analyze the elements of an international arbitration clause, including the relevance of the stipulated arbitration rules, the significance of the agreed-upon place of arbitration, and contractual options concerning number of arbitrators and the method of their selection. As the term advances, students will gain a practical, in-depth understanding of each of the principal stages of the international arbitral process, including: enforcement of the arbitration agreement; initiation of arbitral proceedings; pursuit of provisional remedies; and conduct of the arbitration itself – from the pleading stage, through the exchange of written submissions, to the handling of the merits hearing. Having learned the fundamentals of the international arbitral process, we will spend several sessions exploring how that process typically plays out in the context of investor-state arbitration, where public international law provides the substantive rules of decision in claims between private parties and sovereign states. We will conclude by examining procedures for enforcing and challenging arbitral awards and will evaluate certain contemporary critiques of the international arbitral system.\n\nLaw 202 Contracts is recommended.\n\nFinal Assessment: Exam\n\nGrading Mode: Letter Grading\n\nDiscussion. For Fall 2024, enrollment in this course is limited to those with a significant role within a student organization or Law Student Association officer/committee member. Please add yourself to the waitlist during registration or contact Senior Assistant Dean Emily Scivoletto for admission to the course. NOTE: Course day/time indicates Tuesdays at 12:00 p.m., but this is a place-holder and the 5 weekly meeting times will rotate. However, students must be available Friday, September 6, 2024 from noon to 5:00 p.m. for the Leadership and the Law Retreat.\n\nThis course allows students to study and apply methods of leadership, conflict resolution and ethical decision-making to their current work at King Hall and in their future practice areas in the law and government. Lawyers are frequently asked to take on leadership roles in law firms, government, non-profit and business settings, and political, social and educational organizations. Yet many of our law students graduate from law school without studying methods of effective leadership or assessing their own leadership traits and capabilities. This course will help prepare students for responsible leadership and service in the many roles that lawyers perform both in and out of legal practice, and in their roles as social change agents. Students will assess their own leadership skills and abilities and critically examine the leadership traits, styles and decision-making processes of prominent leaders who are lawyers.\n\nThis course will be taught as an accelerated course. Class will meet for the first five weeks of the fall semester, including the Leadership Retreat on Friday, September 6, in addition to small grou"
