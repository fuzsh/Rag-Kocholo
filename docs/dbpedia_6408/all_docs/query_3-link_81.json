        "text": "[courses | faculty ]\n\nAll courses, faculty listings, and curricular and degree requirements described herein are subject to change or deletion without notice.\n\nLaw and Society is an interdisciplinary minor that emphasizes the complexity and interrelationship of legal, social, and ethical issues in their historical context. Although it is administered by Warren College, it is available to all UC San Diego undergraduate students considering law-related careers or those with a general interest in law as a social institution. The purpose of the program is to enhance students’ critical analysis of social and ethical issues related to law and of the legal implications and ramifications of policy and decision-making in their major fields of study. Students examine the role of the legal system and specific legal issues from the perspectives of the social sciences and humanities. Social forces, historical questions, and issues of values will be considered in the context of the legal system. The focus of the minor is on the process of law—how the law both reflects and defines basic social values—and its relation to the political, economic, and social conflicts within society.\n\nThe interdisciplinary content of the Law and Society minor offers students the opportunity to examine law-related issues from the perspectives of a broad range of disciplines, including anthropology, communication, critical gender studies, economics, environmental studies, ethnic studies, history, linguistics, philosophy, political science, psychology, sociology, and urban studies and planning.\n\nStudents should consult an academic adviser at their college to determine how the Law and Society minor can best meet their college graduation requirements. Minor declarations must be made online using the TritonLink major and minor application.\n\nStudents are urged to supplement the Law and Society minor with a law-related internship. The Academic Internship Program offers local placements with lawyers, judges, elected officials, government offices, and public interest groups. In addition, placements are available in Washington, D.C. with senators, representatives, legislative committees, and political action committees.\n\nA number of extracurricular events and programs are also available to students interested in law. Information on these programs and activities is available in the Warren College Interdisciplinary Programs Office, EBU 3B, Computer Science and Engineering Building, Room 1108, Warren College, or call (858) 534-3068.
