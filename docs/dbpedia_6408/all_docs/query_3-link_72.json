        "text": "Unit name Law of Tort II: Other Liabilities Unit code LAWD10019 Credit points 20 Level of study C/4 Teaching block(s) Teaching Block 2 (weeks 13 - 24)\n\nUnit director Professor. Ken Oliphant Open unit status Not open Units you must take before you take this one (pre-requisite units)\n\nnone\n\nUnits you must take alongside this one (co-requisite units)\n\nnone\n\nUnits you may not take alongside this one\n\nnone\n\nSchool/department University of Bristol Law School Faculty Faculty of Social Sciences and Law\n\nUnit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis unit builds on the compulsory unit Law of Tort I: Liability for Negligence. Tort is the general law of civil liability and in fact embraces a very diverse set of liabilities other than negligence, including intentional interference with the person, product liability, nuisance, defamation (libel and slander) and misuse of private information. These other liabilities—which are, like negligence, important areas of professional legal practice—provide this unit’s focus. Studying this unit will introduce you to the rich and stimulating diversity of the law of tort beyond liability arising in the tort of negligence and enable you to acquire knowledge and understanding of concepts and principles that you will need if you intend to qualify as a lawyer. The unit also addresses the theme of sustainability in considering how the tort of nuisance guards against interference with the occupation and use of land, for example by environmental pollution.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nThis optional unit gives you the opportunity to build on your learning in compulsory unit Law of Tort I: Liability for Negligence. It will highlight interconnections between tort law and other subjects you will study in your first year so that you understand, for example, that wrongdoing can have consequences in both criminal law and tort law, and how tortious liability can both protect and undermine human rights and freedoms. The unit incorporates the theme of sustainability in the context of tortious liability for interference with land, providing valuable context if you decide to take the optional unit Environmental Law later in your studies.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThis unit introduces you to tortious liabilities other those arising in the tort of negligence, including intentional interference with the person, defamation, misuse of private information, product liability and nuisance. The unit incorporates the theme of sustainability in considering how the tort of nuisance guards against interference with the occupation and use of land, for example by environmental pollution.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nYou will gain knowledge and understanding of important concepts and principles of the law of tort, and of the rich and stimulating diversity of tort law beyond the tort of negligence.\n\nYou will reinforce and consolidate your legal reasoning skills, equipping you better for further study, as well as for professional practice if you decide to become a lawyer.\n\nYou will be able to engage in legal analysis of real or hypothetical facts, applying rules of tort law to determine whether liability arises or not, and critically assess the bases on which liability can arise.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nKnowledge and understanding. You will be able to describe key concepts and principles of the law of tort beyond liability for negligence.\n\nApplication. You will be able to analyse factual scenarios (real or hypothetical) to determine the tortious liabilities that may arise, identifying relevant legal rules and applying them to the facts.\n\nCritical analysis. You will be able to identify areas where the law or its application is uncertain and to demonstrate critical thinking in presenting your preferred legal analysis. You will be explain and evaluate the role of tort law (especially the tort of nuisance) in promoting the goal of sustainability.\n\nLegal writing skills. You will be able to write clearly about legal concepts and to produce well-structured analyses in both problem question and essay formats.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe unit will be taught in TB2 and will include lectures, large group sessions and seminars. These activities will typically take place on campus. The unit will also require directed and self-directed learning, which will include activities such as reading materials included in the unit’s reading list, watching videos, accessing web-based supplementary materials, completing online tests and performing tasks for seminar discussion. Teaching is student-centred, and you will be expected to contribute to seminar discussion and to engage in peer-to-peer learning.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nSeminars in this unit are centred around assessment-style problem and essay questions, which give you the opportunity to test your knowledge and practise important legal skills. These tasks provide immediate feedback through peer discussion and oral feedback from academic staff. A formative assessment will take place midway through the unit in which you will answer an essay question (500 words) and a problem question (500 words). Individual written feedback and lecture-based cohort feedback will be provided. This formative assessment gives you direct experience of the types of task you will be required to undertake as your summative assessment.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nThe summative assessment will take the form of a Timed Assessment in which you will be required to answer two questions, one problem question and one essay question. Each question has a word limit of 1500 words. This unit covers all Intended Learning Outcomes for this unit.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, the unit will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis.\n\nThe Board of Examiners will consider all cases where students have failed or not completed the assessment required for credit in the usual way.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it via the Resource Lists homepage. Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. LAWD10019).\n\nHow much time the unit requires\n\nEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours of study to complete. Your total learning time is made up of contact time, directed learning tasks, independent learning and assessment activity.\n\nSee the University Workload statement relating to this unit for more information."
