        "text": "We posted a long time ago in anticipation of this movie. Now that Hot Coffee has been released and shown to audiences for a number of months, we are again suggesting people take a look at the work that Susan Saladoff and others did in creating a movie that gives a great depiction of what the current landscape of personal injury litigation looks like. Hot Coffee does a good job of presenting the side of insurance claims and injury lawsuits that is most often not experienced by the general public. The movie uses the famous McDonaldâ€™s hot coffee case as a backdrop for further discussion on how the insurance industry and big business lobby and spend enormous amounts of money to sway public opinion in an effort to limit their liability exposure.\n\nhttp://www.hotcoffeethemovie.com/default.asp"
