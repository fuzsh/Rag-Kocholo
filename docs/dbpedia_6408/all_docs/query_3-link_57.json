        "text": "You probably have some sense of what a lawsuit is, and how it works. Civil procedure deals with how the legal system lets you identify, bring and resolve non-criminal disputes in federal court. In other words, civil procedure is about the “rules of the road” for preparing, defending, conducting, and concluding a civil lawsuit in federal court. These rules are determined by the constitution, statutes, formal rules (the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure), and court practices, and they have evolved as the courts and our cases have evolved over time. This course will teach you how to read legal materials and how to apply them to actual factual situations, which are skills you will use in every area of your legal study and practice. The course teaches a new language – law and procedure. Recurring themes that you can expect to focus on the rules themselves, fairness, access to justice, legal and practical strategy, and the relationship between state and federal laws and courts.\n\nThis course will examine selected legal topics not addressed – or addressed only at an introductory level – in Business Associations regarding the formation, organization, operation, and capitalization of the principal forms of business associations used today, including partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and for-profit business corporations. The content of the course may vary from year to year depending on the instructor and the matters previously covered in Business Associations. However, topics will likely include an examination of customary organizational, and related operational documents for the various forms of business enterprises; issues arising in connection with the issuance of stock, and other ownership interests, dividends and distributions; an enterprise’s redemption or repurchase of its shares or other ownership interests; valuation of a corporate or other business enterprise; the rights and remedies of preferred shareholders, bond holders and others who hold debt (convertible or other senior securities); mergers, acquisitions and other fundamental transactions; the securities regulation process and the exemptions therefrom; and the rights and liabilities of purchasers and sellers of securities.\n\nPre-requisite: Business Associations (LAW 601)\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThis course provides an integrated examination of sales of goods and secured transactions as governed by Articles 2 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code and related bodies of law, including Articles 1, 2A, 3, 5 and 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code and the federal Bankruptcy Code. Commercial law in general – and sales of goods and secured transactions in particular – provide the legal foundation for our economic system, and virtually all lawyers (regardless of practice concentration, and including both litigators and transactional practitioners) will encounter these matters in their practices (both for themselves and on behalf of their clients).\n\nStudents taking the course will learn not only the substantive law upon which these transactions are based, but also the commercial and transactional context and vocabulary relevant to these transactions and the role that transactional lawyers play in planning and executing them. Stressing careful statutory analysis and problem solving, we will analyze issues that arise in these transactions from a multitude of perspectives, including those of the buyer, the seller, their creditors and third parties. Additionally, we will examine more modern concepts of contract formation in the age of electronic commerce. The format of this class will be problem and transactional based, providing a more hands-on and practical approach to applying the UCC provisions. Finally, we will consider the impact of bankruptcy on these transactions.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThis course examines the social and environmental obligations, if any, imposed on corporations beyond pure profit maximization. Milton Friedman famously wrote that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits,” and, indeed, a course in the law of business associations likely reinforces the commitment to profit-maximization as a legal obligation as well. However, as evidenced by the development of new corporate forms (such as the “benefit corporation”) and the policies of Fortune 500 companies, the recent trend has been towards a recognition a broader corporate purpose in law and practice.\n\nThis course will examine corporate social responsibility, with a particular focus on sustainability and the environment. The course begins with the question of whether such a responsibility exists, drawing on potential legal, ethical, and societal sources. We will then turn to how corporations can meet their environmental obligations, or fail to, under existing law. Looking at what has already been done by some of the “best” actors, we will ultimately aim to determine the proper role for corporate governance in the pursuit of a healthier climate system and planet as a whole.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nBusinesses, governments and other entities are all at risk of suffering anything from a minor to a catastrophic cyber security attack and data breach. The resulting damages can be financial, reputational or even physical. Consequently, it is important for businesses and other entities of every size and in every sector to engage in best practices to minimize the risk of a cyberattack and data breach, and to be prepared for how to respond if (and, really, when) a cyber data breach occurs. Among the many tools that should be in a business’s cyber risk management arsenal is cyber insurance.\n\nWith a focus on commercial business entities, this course will introduce the world of cyber insurance (sometimes more specifically called “cyber liability insurance,” “cyber risk insurance,” “network security insurance” or “privacy breach insurance”). The course will primarily identify the most common types of losses and costs associated with cyber attacks and other privacy and data security breaches, address potential sources of insurance coverage for cyber losses under traditional business insurance policies and newer cyber-specific policies, review some of the more common cyber coverage provisions, consider what contractual obligations an insurer has to a policyholder or other insured under the policy, and review how courts have analyzed coverage for cyber losses under traditional property and liability policies and cyber-specific insurance policies.\n\nStudents will also look at how insurers are reforming cyber insurance to shape the required security practices businesses must take to protect themselves from cyberattacks and obtain insurance protection.\n\nEnrollment is limited to 12 students.\n\nOffered: Occasionally\n\nEntertainment law is a mashup of different types of substantive law that converge when creators and distributors package and deliver content to stages, screens, and headphones. This two credit survey course will introduce students to the primary issues and legal dynamics that operate behind the scenes of arts and entertainment ventures within the United States. Because media and entertainment issues can arise in all practice areas, whether in criminal law, estate planning, or otherwise, Entertainment Law will equip students with the skills to spot and steward potential entertainment issues for adequate disposition.\n\nSpecifically, this course will explore the legal basis for exploitation and disposition of rights in entertainment ventures, beginning with free expression and sources of ideas and acquisition of underlying rights. Because entertainment law is heavily grounded in copyright law, the course considers the scope of protection and limits of use with respect to original works of authorship (film; tv; literary works). Entertainment Law also explores common ethical issues in representation of entertainment clients, including the California Talent Agencies Act and related agent and attorney regulations; representation of minors; and gender, race, and equity issues in creator/studio deals. The course includes substantive introductory coverage of the intersection of trademarks, rights of publicity, and creative control in entertainment transactions.\n\nEntertainment Law will examine practical applications of entertainment law, including theatrical adaptations; music law (publishing; recording contracts; and distribution); film and television development (financing; production; and distribution); literary publishing (author and publishing agreements); and visual art and cultural property law, including topics in traditional knowledge, source disclosure, and cultural heritage trends. The course concludes with an examination of contemporary issues in entertainment and technology, including digital piracy and artificial intelligence.\n\nOffered: Occasionally\n\nThe course examines the goals of the U.S. health care system, which is designed to provide high-quality, affordable, and accessible health care. We will explore the regulation of health care professionals and institutions. The course will also discuss the contract, tort, and administrative law issues that come up in cases of informed consent, liability, malpractice, and end-of-life care. The course will also examine legal efforts to make health care affordable and accessible. We will study the regulation of both public and private insurance systems and use basic insurance principles to explore this area of law. Health law is complex for many reasons, including because it involves the interactions of state and federal statutes (and regulations) with longstanding principles of contract and tort law. The intersections between state and federal statutes and policies are also challenging. The 2010 Affordable Care Act will of course be a focus of the course.\n\nOffered: every other year\n\nThere are few fields of law more immediately pressing than information privacy law. The amount of personal information that businesses and governments collect about people, and the ways in which these actors use and share people’s personal information, are rapidly expanding. New technologies raise far-reaching questions about our society’s privacy expectations and cultural values; questions that the law plays a key role in answering.\n\nWhile the privacy challenges posed by the use of emerging technologies involving big data, artificial intelligence, facial recognition, biometrics, and more are indeed cutting-edge, in some respects they are nothing new. The law has been grappling with how to balance the tension between one person’s right to be let alone and another’s right to know for well over a century. The legal principles developed in response to earlier privacy threats find continued relevance as lawmakers and courts decide how to respond to the privacy threats of our day.\n\nThis course is designed to provide you with an introduction to the study of information privacy law and to equip you with the broad issue-spotting and other practical skills needed to navigate the complex array of legal, business, and public policy issues in this area. The course will span foundational privacy issues in the fields of constitutional law and tort law; consumer privacy protections; laws regarding the collection, use, storage, and transfer of personal information; sectoral privacy laws in the U.S.; and emerging issues in privacy law.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThis course is designed to cover the “how” of being a privacy lawyer, including the ethics challenges confronted by in-house privacy counsel serving roles like Chief Privacy Officer and Data Protection Officer. Students will develop practical skills using real world problems in the information privacy and cybersecurity areas. Pragmatic guidance will be provided from experienced in-house and outside privacy counsel. Students will assume the roles of lawyers to perform tasks in hypothetical situations. The goal is to give students the chance to integrate legal theory, practical skills and ethics while engaging in a number of professional skills in a classroom setting.\n\nCase studies will be drawn from various real world examples such as: Cambridge Analytica/Facebook, Equifax data breach and compliance with GDPR to form the basis for a number of different exercises. The exercises will focus on key areas of privacy and cybersecurity legal practice. By way of example, such exercises might focus on the following topics:\n\nPrivacy impact assessments – providing advice with respect to when and how to use them, how to go about completing them, tools available for completing assessments and how to utilize the results of the assessment, including action steps to take based on the assessment.\n\nCommercial transactions between parties involving the transfer and handling of personal information – drafting and negotiating contract provisions (from the perspective of both parties) that address privacy and data security concerns (e.g. Data processing agreements) and the related regulatory and other risks associated with handling personal information.\n\nData breach notification – providing end to end advice to a business that is the victim of a data breach, beginning with the initial notification of the security incident, working with the IT and forensics teams to figure out what happened and how to contain the incident, determining whether there are any breach notification obligations, crafting the breach notification letter, responding to regulatory inquiries and enforcement actions, crafting notice of claim to insurance carriers of third party providers that may be at fault, pursuing insurance claims, defending and bringing litigations, and negotiating resolution of such claims and disputes.\n\nOffered: every other year\n\nIssues of risk management and compliance are attracting increasing focus and attention throughout society and legal practice. Government regulation and regulatory oversight, industry-based codes of ethics, and standards of social responsibility and conduct all have been proliferating in recent years. These developments raise many issues for lawyers. This course will explore the law and practice relevant to these issues, principally from a transactional lawyer’s perspective. After a general introduction to risk and risk management, we will address a number of specific topics such as the reputational, operational and enterprise implications of risk, the transactional lawyer’s role in helping clients develop and manage appropriate and effective risk management and compliance programs, the tools available to the transactional lawyer to identify and help manage risks in the client’s transactions and business operations, and the transactional lawyer as “whistle blower” or “gate keeper.” Finally, we will examine the transactional lawyer’s own management of the risks she or he encounters in client representation (including the “bad actor” client, conflicts of interest, engagement letters and advance waivers, theories of attorney liability, transactional legal opinions, audit letter responses, and dealing with wayward partners and associates). We will use actual case studies to supplement our discussions.\n\nOffered: every other year\n\nBusiness start-ups and entrepreneurial ventures present a unique set of legal and business problems and challenges both to the principals undertaking them and to their lawyers and other advisors. The success of these ventures relies heavily on building a world-class team around the founders where the totality of those working to move the startup forward have a common language and goals. Building these ventures requires not only substantive expertise, but also emotional intelligence, an understanding of the risks, goals and personalities involved, and capacity for counseling and guiding the parties on an often wildly unpredictable journey. This course, taught collaboratively by Professors Harkins and Kaufman and including both law and MBA students, will examine these issues through these various lenses.\n\nTopics will include case and client management, business plans, basic financial literacy, entity selection, capital formation (including the unique types, sources and roles of start-up and entrepreneurial financing), operational challenges, intellectual property identification and protection, and the roles of lawyers and other advisors in representing start-ups and entrepreneurs.\n\nEnrollment limited to 12 students, selected by lottery.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nThis course will introduce students to the lawyer’s role in transactional practice and provide practical experience in the dynamics of a corporate “deal.” Students will examine a hypothetical, Maine-based transaction that includes a business acquisition component, a financing component, and an equity component. Students will “represent” the various parties to the transaction and work through the required tasks and challenges to bring the transaction to fruition, resulting with a “closing” at the end of the course. Deliverables will include negotiated “deal documents” and other related closing items. The course will meet twice per week in 1-1/2 hour sessions. Focus of the sessions will alternate between an examination of the substantive issues and their practical application in a “deal” context.\n\nPre-requisites: Business Associations (LAW 601) and Taxation I (LAW 649)\n\nOffered: every other year\n\nThis course is designed for students who want to have the broadest possible clinical experience. Each student is admitted to practice in Maine courts as a “student attorney,” and will maintain an active case load of four to eight cases, which may include general civil, family, probate, appellate, or criminal cases. The course is practice- and skill-oriented, covering client counseling, ethics, investigation, pre-trial practice, negotiation, document drafting, trial experience, and appeals. You will learn how to be a lawyer, and how to interact with other lawyers, the courts and clients. Students will work with the close supervision and mentoring of a faculty supervisor. Along with regular work on cases, students also participate in a weekly one-hour seminar to discuss ongoing cases, ethical issues, lawyering skills, and other topics.\n\nStudents must have completed at least three semesters of law school to enroll.\n\nPre-Requisites: Evidence (LAW 644), Trial Practice (LAW 650) [or Trial Advocacy and Evidence (Law 755)], and Professional Responsibility (LAW 632).\n\nCo-Requisite: Lawyering Skills for Clinical Practice (Law 667) is a co-requisite for all students enrolling in a clinical course for the first time. Students must have completed at least three semesters of law school to enroll.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThe purpose of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive overview of the strategies and practical skills necessary to advocate effectively for public policy reform. Students will learn to think beyond litigation and other traditional legal strategies to solve problems and meet societal goals. Students will be required to identify and define a problem that speaks to a pressing systemic racial, economic, or social injustice in the community, which could be addressed through a change in law, regulation, ordinance, or other public policy.\n\nWorking individually and in small groups, students will learn and practice key skills to advocate for a policy solution. Students will gain an understanding of the varied strategies involved in developing and advancing a public policy reform as well as the particular skills and tactics required to engage in those strategies. Students will learn how to employ equity-based criteria for policy development, conduct a landscape analysis of decision-makers and influencers, determine a strategy for change, and implement the tactics necessary to carry out that strategy. Specific skills covered include “power mapping”; drafting legislative and/or regulatory proposals, policy papers and reports; locating, evaluating, and using social science research and data; lobbying elected officials; preparing and delivering written and oral testimony; working in coalitions; and developing an external communications plan and targeted messaging. Students will also explore how coalition building, grassroots organizing, and public policy advocacy are used to enhance more traditional legal strategies.\n\nIn addition to learning the strategies and skills to advance a policy change, students will gain an understanding of the broader context for influencing law and public policy and the possible roles lawyers can play in change efforts. The goal of the course is to help students become effective advocates and allies for social change as well as good lawyers.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nThis course serves as both a foundation for and complement to students’ client work in a Cumberland Legal Aid Clinic course, as they will learn specific skills and strategies for serving their clients now and throughout their legal careers. The course gives students an opportunity to dig deeply into the key aspects of lawyering, develop and hone skills through simulations and role playing, work on specific aspects of their current cases, give and receive peer feedback and support, engage in critical reflection, among other activities. During the course the students will learn the specific skills and competencies related the following aspects of lawyering, among others:\n\nprofessional relationships and communication\n\ndeveloping a meaningful and effective attorney-client relationship\n\ndeveloping and cultivating a cultural humility framework to explore and learn from the perspectives of clients, peers, and instructors in the Clinic\n\ndeveloping key professional and leadership skills for an attorney, including time management, receiving and giving feedback, and deep listening\n\nusing narrative theory for persuasion\n\nclient interviewing\n\ncase theory\n\nfact investigation\n\nnegotiation\n\nclient counseling\n\ntrauma-informed lawyering\n\ntrial advocacy\n\nreflection and developing a professional identity\n\nidentifying and managing ethical issues\n\nStudent must be enrolled for the first time in a Cumberland Legal Aid Clinic class, (General Practice Clinic, Juvenile Justice Clinic, Prisoner Assistance Clinic, or Refugee and Human Rights Clinic) each of which has enrollment caps.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThis course provides students with extensive opportunities to serve clients on a wide range of civil matters, such as family law, trust and probate, contracts, insurance, consumer rights, wages, and any other civil legal issue that might arise. Students enrolled in this clinic are admitted to practice in Maine courts as student attorneys and provide the full range of civil legal services to prisoners in the Maine prison system. Students go to the Maine Correctional Center or Southern Maine Reentry Center (both located in Windham) each week to meet with prisoners seeking legal help. On a few occasions prisoners in other facilities are assisted through telephone and written correspondence. The legal services provided by students can range from answering questions and providing assistance with completion and filing of legal forms to full representation in court proceedings (including trials and appeals). Since the level of representation varies, students in the Prisoner Assistance Clinic will have between six and ten cases at any given time. We do not provide assistance on criminal, post-conviction or prisoners’ rights matters in this program. Along with regular work with with the faculty supervisor on cases, students also participate in a weekly one-hour case rounds meeting to discuss cases.\n\nStudents must have completed at least three semesters of law school to enroll.\n\nPre-Requisites: Evidence (LAW 644), Trial Practice (LAW 650) [or Trial Advocacy and Evidence (Law 755)], and Professional Responsibility (LAW 632).\n\nCo-Requisite: Lawyering Skills for Clinical Practice (Law 667) is a co-requisite for all students enrolling in a clinical course for the first time. Students must have completed at least three semesters of law school to enroll.\n\nEnrollment is by lottery.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThe Refugee and Human Rights Clinic provides an exciting opportunity for students to advocate on behalf of low-income immigrants in a broad range of cases and projects. Clients include, for example, asylum applicants who have fled human rights abuses in their home countries and are seeking refuge in the United States, immigrant survivors of domestic violence, immigrant victims of certain crimes, and abandoned or abused children seeking legal status in the United States. Under faculty supervision, student attorneys not only develop their substantive knowledge of immigration law and human rights laws and norms but they also build core legal skills relevant to the general practice of law. Students’ clinical work includes interviewing clients and witnesses and preparing their testimony, conducting factual and legal investigation and marshaling of evidence, analyzing and presenting human rights documentation, developing case strategies, writing legal briefs, appearing in administrative hearings, and participating in human rights advocacy projects. Along with regular work with the faculty supervisor on the cases, students also participate in a weekly one-hour seminar to discuss ongoing cases, ethical issues, lawyering skills, and substantive and practical aspects of immigration law.\n\nStudents must have completed at least three semesters of law school to enroll.\n\nPre-Requisites: Evidence (LAW 644), Trial Practice (LAW 650) [or Trial Advocacy and Evidence (Law 755)], and Professional Responsibility (LAW 632).\n\nCo-Requisite: Lawyering Skills for Clinical Practice (Law 667) is a co-requisite for all students enrolling in a clinical course for the first time. Students must have completed at least three semesters of law school to enroll.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThe Rural Practice Clinic (RPC) is an immersive clinic located in Fort Kent, Maine, where the students will live and work for the semester. The RPC provides students the opportunity to provide direct representation to low-income clients in need of legal assistance in a rural setting– in other words, to practice law. While Clinic faculty provide instruction and supervision, the students are, in every respect, the lawyers for the RPC’s clients. Students will interview and counsel clients, develop case theory, conduct discovery, negotiate outcomes with opposing parties and counsel, prepare cases for court, and handle hearings, trials and other contested evidentiary proceedings. Students represent clients in matters involving a broad range of issues at the trial level including: family, criminal, civil, guardianship, constitutional, administrative, consumer, and probate law.\n\nAnother significant component of the RPC is Case Rounds, student-led classes modeled after “rounds” in the medical setting which will provide you with opportunities to learn from and support other students. In each rounds, one or more students will present a particular case (generally one in which a challenge of some kind has arisen) to the group, and all students discuss the case and help the student develop a plan. RPC students will participate in Case Rounds via Zoom with the Portland-based clinical students.\n\nIn addition to traditional clinic experiences, RPC students will present to the community and students at the University of Maine at Fort Kent (UMFK) on a variety legal topics, participate in educational outreach and assistance activities at the courthouse, act as Lawyer of the Day in Fort Kent and Madawaska District Courts, and represent clients in jury trials should the opportunities present themselves. RPC students will live in a suite on the UMFK campus at no cost to them. Fall and spring students will be provided a meal plan. Students will have access to a wide variety of outdoor recreational activities, from Nordic and Alpine skiing to canoeing, biking, and hiking. Most importantly, students will get to experience working with a tight-knit group of lawyers, clerks, and judges on a regular basis while developing their own voices and roles within the community.\n\nPre-Requisites: Evidence (LAW 644), Trial Practice (LAW 650), and Professional Responsibility (LAW 632).\n\nCo-Requisite: Lawyering Skills for Clinical Practice (Law 667) is a co-requisite for all students enrolling in a clinical course for the first time.\n\nEnrollment is limited to 2 students, selected from applications.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThe purpose of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive overview of the strategies and practical skills necessary to advocate effectively for public policy reform.

Students must have completed at least three semesters of law school to enroll.\n\nEnrollment is by lottery, 2 spots are pre-selected.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThe course examines the goals of the U.S. health care system, which is designed to provide high-quality, affordable, and accessible health care. We will explore the regulation of health care professionals and institutions. The course will also discuss the contract, tort, and administrative law issues that come up in cases of informed consent, liability, malpractice, and end-of-life care.

The goal of the course is to help students become effective advocates and allies for social change as well as good lawyers.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nIn an address given at Harvard in 1905, Justice Brandeis noted that “the legal profession does afford in America unusual opportunities for usefulness . . . the lawyer has played so large a part in our political life [because their] training fits [them] especially to grapple with the questions which are presented in a democracy.\n\nThis course will draw on select case law and seminal legal, philosophical, and sociological writings to explore and answer questions such as:\n\nWhat is the “common good”?\n\nWhat is justice?\n\nAre inequities the same as injustices? Does it matter?\n\nIs the legal system just? Is the legal system equitable? How do we know?\n\nIf we seek to eliminate inequities and/or injustices – wherever they appear – what are effective mechanisms for change?\n\nWhat is the role of the impacted community or person?\n\nWhat is the role of the advocate/lawyer?\n\nHow does the advocate/lawyer address inevitable flaws in their position and client or community and still achieve the desired outcome?\n\nWhat skills are needed to be most effective when addressing difficult topics across cultures?\n\nContrary to historical depictions of a lone lawyer against a system, addressing matters of public interest and social justice are often accomplished through collaborative and communal efforts. An advocate’s efficacy depends, then, less on individual might and more on harnessing collective power. This course equips students with a broad understanding of foundational theories and concepts that shape how “justice” and “common good” are understood today. Students will also have the opportunity to reflect on their personal leadership development where knowledge of the law and legal strategies are combined with self-awareness, resilience, and cultural awareness to enable students to engage persuasively on various topics of national interest.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nA growing number of lawyers market themselves as appellate specialists. This course aims to interest students in the appellate specialty; provide an overview of the different types of appeals and appellate rules of procedure; and provide a forum to practice written and oral appellate advocacy.\n\nStudents will ghost write at least two appellate pleadings in pending cases, litigated contemporaneously with the course offering in state and/or federal court. The course also will simulate client management skills and students will have the opportunity to practice oral arguments. In the process, students will learn a variety of fungible skills, e.g. how to evaluate strategic litigation choices and how to communicate those choices to the client; how to work with “good” and “bad” facts; how to best frame the legal questions presented by the case; and how to appropriately confront the ethical issues that routinely confront courtroom lawyers.\n\nAt the conclusion of the course, students should feel comfortable independently prosecuting a direct appeal in state or federal court. Students should also pass any question about the Maine Rules of Appellate Procedure on the Maine Bar Exam.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nAt the heart of the criminal process is discretionary decision-making by prosecutors and defense counsel. The prosecutor has vast, unreviewable power over the charging decision. But with that power comes the responsibility to evaluate the truthfulness of potential testimony by cooperating witnesses, police officers, law enforcement experts, and alleged victims. Law by agreement of the prosecutor and defense counsel is the “law” that settles more than 90 percent of criminal cases, and the most important advocacy of defense counsel is often directed to the prosecutor. Before plea bargaining, the lawyers must evaluate everything that has gone before, such as the results of formal and informal discovery, the amount of time served pending trial, and the likelihood of conviction and of a particular sentence. Mutual trust between prosecutors and defense counsel, or its lack, significantly influences the functioning of the criminal process. Having identified the powers of prosecutors and defense counsel, the course attempts an extended inquiry onto how these powers should be exercised.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThis course provides: (1) an orientation to the key rules, concepts, and controversies concerning the presentation and admission of evidence in criminal and civil trials; and (2) an introduction to the specific skills used by attorneys in litigation as proponents and opponents of evidence. Specifically, we will examine: the overall structure of trials; how evidentiary disputes are raised and resolved; the examination and impeachment of witnesses; relevance; character evidence; hearsay; and opinion testimony. The goal is to gain a solid grounding in the key rules, concepts, and controversies to enable you to use the rules strategically and effectively in your own cases (whether in Trial Practice, a clinical or externship course, or your practice), to critically evaluate the evidence rules and their application, and to understand how the rules operate in conjunction with substantive law (i.e. criminal law, tort law, etc.). Accordingly, we will study not only the rules’ explicit requirements and prohibitions but also the policy goals and assumptions underlying the rules. The Federal Rules of Evidence will be our primary focus for the course; however, you are also responsible for learning some important distinctions between the Federal and Maine Rules of Evidence.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThis course will cover the criminal court process in Maine from arraignment/initial appearance all the way up to jury selection. Very few cases these days go to trial. The part of the criminal court process this class will cover will be the lion’s share of a criminal defense lawyer or prosecutor’s practice when they graduate. The course will start with a high level over view of the entire criminal procedure process. I anticipate this will take up the first class. Each class after that will focus in more detail on every step in the process starting with the arraignment and bail hearing, then proceeding as follows: discovery letters and motions for sanctions, dispositional conference, motion in limine, motion to suppress, docket call, trial call, jury selection.\n\nThe course will require the students to observe the following court hearings at least once during the semester: arraignment, bail argument, one “other” motion hearing (could be a motion in limine, motion to terminate deferred disposition, motion to revoke bail, mental health list hearing etc.), dispositional conference, and motion to suppress. The Cumberland County Criminal Court currently conducts three arraignments, three all day dispositional conference lists, two motions lists every week. The Court also has docket call, trial call, and jury selection at least once if not twice a month. Because of this, I believe the students will be able to meet this requirement.\n\nThe course will also require the students to write a motion to amend bail, discovery request letter, motion for sanctions, motion to suppress, and a closing argument brief relating to the motion to suppress hearing. After each written assignment is done, the student will participate in a mock hearing to put their motion to the test. For example, a mock arraignment, mock bail hearing, and mock motion to suppress.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nStudents will acquire a fundamental knowledge of Arctic law and science coupled with applied skills in field research compliance. The course will begin with an in-depth study of the Arctic including regional challenges of climate change, commerce and geopolitics. The remainder of the course will entail working with University of Maine scientists (the clients) to prepare an Arctic field expedition to Greenland. Students will review proposed field projects to identify plausible risks and mitigation means. They will determine regulatory requirements including, inter alia, necessary permitting, Government of Greenland regulations, National Science Foundation guidelines, University of Maine Office of General Council directives, the Arctic Science Agreement and related treaties. Students will draft a comprehensive field manual for responsible research in the Arctic. This course may be applied as an elective for the Environmental and Oceans Law Certificate. In addition to class meetings, students must expect to devote at least four hours and forty minutes out of class.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nIn Climate Change, we are confronted with the defining policy challenge of our generation. Every institution of power, whether it be a national government or a corporate board of directors, must decide how to respond to it. The aim of this course is to inform the leaders who will guide those climate change policy decisions. We will build from an understanding of the fundamental facts of climate change, and its potentially devastating impacts, to the study of the tools available to governmental and non-governmental actors for climate mitigation and adaptation. The course will focus on not only the legal mechanisms targeted at climate change (laws, regulations, litigation), but also on the perhaps equally important measures taken by corporations and other private actors. We will discuss what can, what will, and what should be done.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nMark Twain observed “Climate is what you expect; weather is what you get.” What we understand as climate is the sum total of weather as it evolves day upon day. Weather hazards, such as hurricanes and heatwaves, or persistent unusual weather over time, such as diminished rainfall leading to drought, are climate extremes. It is now understood that many climate extremes are increasing in frequency and intensity with accelerating climate change. When people and property are vulnerable to these hazards, a disaster can result, but meteorological science has devised sophisticated predictive and analytical tools that provide advance warning. The tools are global and thus intersect with international law at every stage of the extreme climate event—prior, during and post. This class will place students at the center of climate and law operations and debates in the experiential learning venue of the United Nations World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nFor the next generation of lawyers, scientists, policy makers, public health professionals, business executives and entrepreneurs —and for any other career path—understanding and seeking solutions to the complex problems currently faced by humanity and the ecosystem is essential. This requires, more than ever, that students be exposed to multi-method, inter- and trans-disciplinary, experiential learning. Maine and the world are experiencing multiple existential security threats (eg., climate change, geopolitics, health, economy) that are interrelated to one another. While complex problems such as climate change are often identified within the context of a single discipline; they require solutions based on multiple disciplines that not only work together, but also beyond disciplinary boundaries. Further, complex problem-solving requires investigation at local-regional-global scales and must include perspective gained by understanding and engaging past analogs to learn from past successes, avoid repeating past mistakes, and considering new modes of co-creating solutions. The foregoing is our best option to achieve win-win pathways forward. This course will train students in the application of interdisciplinary methods for the resolution of complex problems. Instruction will be delivered by experts from multiple disciplines. Students will work in teams applying explicit methods to a broad range of critical challenges. The course is hosted by the University of Maine Portland Gateway and is open to graduate students in any field across the University of Maine System.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nThis course examines the social and environmental obligations, if any, imposed on corporations beyond pure profit maximization. Milton Friedman famously wrote that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits,” and, indeed, a course in the law of business associations likely reinforces the commitment to profit-maximization as a legal obligation as well. However, as evidenced by the development of new corporate forms (such as the “benefit corporation”) and the policies of Fortune 500 companies, the recent trend has been towards a recognition a broader corporate purpose in law and practice.\n\nThis course will examine corporate social responsibility, with a particular focus on sustainability and the environment. The course begins with the question of whether such a responsibility exists, drawing on potential legal, ethical, and societal sources. We will then turn to how corporations can meet their environmental obligations, or fail to, under existing law. Looking at what has already been done by some of the “best” actors, we will ultimately aim to determine the proper role for corporate governance in the pursuit of a healthier climate system and planet as a whole.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nThis is a hands-on, experiential skills building course. Increasingly, attorneys who litigate are doing so not before judges or juries, but before regulatory bodies or officers—for example, on issues of planning and zoning, unemployment/social security benefits, environmental permitting, tax review, and asylum to name just a few. The art of advocating for clients in a regulatory arena has differences from a courtroom—oftentimes the adjudicators are laypeople, the rules of evidence do not apply, there may be no discovery, and one must master varying (by agency) procedural rules. This course will begin with an overview of the administrative adjudicatory process, with a primary focus upon Maine law, and then an overview of the relevant environmental law and regulations relating to development projects. As a “practicum” students will develop necessary practical lawyering skills by engaging in a variety of written and oral advocacy exercises using a Maine wind power project simulation; you will one class be representing the developer, the next class representing the opponents. You will draft and orally present to classmates a client memo, op-ed, and a recommended decision on the project. You also will do an expert witness exercise, present an opening or closing argument, and address ethical issues.\n\nOffered: every other year\n\nA seminar providing law students the opportunity to teach a formal course in Environmental Law to undergraduate nonlaw students. Enrollment initially limited to two University of Maine School of Law students for the 2022-2023 academic year. The Maine Law student teachers will be conjoined for the 2022-23 academic year with 10 law student teachers from Boston College, Boston University, and Harvard Law Schools in the BCLS4450-01 Law-Teaching Program Seminar. The intention is to have the program seminar continue thereafter based at the University of Maine School of Law. Under the professor’s direction, two-person teams of law students are trained for the teaching program during the Fall semester in six extensive working sessions plus simulation exercises. They then teach, with faculty status, a Spring semester course in the structures and doctrines of environmental protection law, within an undergraduate curriculum. The initial year’s undergraduate teaching placement for the Maine Law teachers will be within the curriculum of the Center for Sustainable Leadership at St. Joseph’s College of Maine, Standish, Maine. In the program, each team-teaching pair is assigned an enrolled course section comprising fifteen to thirty-five undergraduate students registered for the course, from a variety of undergraduate departments. A weekly law school seminar in the Spring semester coordinates the course preparation, the classroom teaching, and the processes of evaluating their students’ work and assigning grades.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nThis course examines how land use is regulated and controlled. It begins by discussing why and when government regulation, rather than private market ordering, might be necessary to control land use and development patterns. It considers different regulatory and market-based tools that are available to control land use, including flexibility devices such as transferable development rights, contract zoning, and planned unit development. It then explores land use from the perspective of a project proponent, or developer. It examines the rights that an owner of land has if a particular land use regulation is inefficient, unfairly burdensome, unfairly disruptive of the owner’s settled expectations, or an infringement upon the owner’s civil liberties. The course then looks at land use issues from the other side, examining the rights of those who oppose the landowner’s plans (these project opponents are often neighbors). Finally, the course focuses on particular problems that plague the land use regulatory system, such as exclusionary zoning, the equitable distribution of undesirable land uses, sprawl, and smart growth.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nMany young lawyers at the beginning of their careers find that child protection is an area of the law where they can gain valuable litigation experience that may be increasingly hard to come by in other areas. Further, child protection is, of course, an area of the law where young lawyers can provide a valuable service to their clients and their community, no matter which one of the various parties to the case they represent. In this course, students will take a deep dive into Maine’s Child and Family Services and Child Protection Act, 22 M.R.S. §§ 4001 et seq., and related issues. They will gain facility with not only the Child Protection Act but also other vital areas of the law, including the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901 et seq.; the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, 5 M.R.S. §§ 8001; and relevant portions of the Probate Code, Title 18-C of the Maine Revised Statutes. They will leave the course familiar with key child protection-related decisions of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court and the United States Supreme Court, many of which turn on questions of Constitutional interpretation that will be translatable to any other area of the law.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nThis seminar will provide an in-depth examination of a number of today’s most salient family law issues. Early in the semester, each student, after consulting with the professor, will select a modern family law issue about which the student will become the “class expert.” Each student will then prepare materials for and lead a one-hour class session on the legal issue the student has chosen. In addition, each student will write a substantial paper on a topic that falls within their chosen modern family law issue. A wide variety of topics are available to students, including: adoption and the foster care system, assisted reproduction, non-marital relationship recognition, divorce mediation, intra-family violence and abuse, how family law addresses issues related to race, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and religion, and more. Finally, prior to each class, students will submit an informal, two-page reflection paper in which they respond to the materials assigned for the day. Grading is based upon class participation, weekly reflection papers, and a substantial scholarly paper on a topic of the student’s choice.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nRecently, there has been an explosion of legal battles involving efforts to undo old regulations and laws, as well as over how statutes and regulations should be interpreted. Moreover, today the vast majority of attorneys who litigate are doing so not before judges or juries, but before regulatory bodies or non-judicial officers without the Rules of Evidence or Civil Procedure, and that have special standards for issues like standing and finality. The American Bar Association estimates that 65 to 70 percent of the practice of adjudication actually occurs in an administrative setting, rather than a courtroom.\n\nThis course will first review the fundamental principles of and tools for interpretation of statutes and regulations. We then examine work that federal and state agencies do, the procedures they utilize, and the ways in which the political judicial branches seek to control administrative actions. Students will undertake practical exercises on relevant issues throughout the semester to best develop their oral and written advocacy skills, and to better learn and remember the legislative and regulatory doctrines. Maine Law alums who practice in a variety of regulated areas of law will share their insights with students. The goal is to better enable students to address issues in their other courses, as well as in any jobs they pursue.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThis is a hands-on, experiential skills building course. Increasingly, attorneys who litigate are doing so not before judges or juries, but before regulatory bodies or officers—for example, on issues of planning and zoning, unemployment/social security benefits, environmental permitting, tax review, and asylum to name just a few.

You will draft and orally present to classmates a client memo, op-ed, and a recommended decision on the project. You also will do an expert witness exercise, present an opening or closing argument, and address ethical issues.\n\nOffered: every other year\n\nThe purpose of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive overview of the strategies and practical skills necessary to advocate effectively for public policy reform. Students will learn to think beyond litigation and other traditional legal strategies to solve problems and meet societal goals. Students will be required to identify and define a problem that speaks to a pressing systemic racial, economic, or social injustice in the community, which could be addressed through a change in law, regulation, ordinance, or other public policy.\n\nWorking individually and in small groups, students will learn and practice key skills to advocate for a policy solution. Students will gain an understanding of the varied strategies involved in developing and advancing a public policy reform as well as the particular skills and tactics required to engage in those strategies. Students will learn how to employ equity-based criteria for policy development, conduct a landscape analysis of decision-makers and influencers, determine a strategy for change, and implement the tactics necessary to carry out that strategy. Specific skills covered include “power mapping”; drafting legislative and/or regulatory proposals, policy papers and reports; locating, evaluating, and using social science research and data; lobbying elected officials; preparing and delivering written and oral testimony; working in coalitions; and developing an external communications plan and targeted messaging. Students will also explore how coalition building, grassroots organizing, and public policy advocacy are used to enhance more traditional legal strategies.\n\nIn addition to learning the strategies and skills to advance a policy change, students will gain an understanding of the broader context for influencing law and public policy and the possible roles lawyers can play in change efforts. The goal of the course is to help students become effective advocates and allies for social change as well as good lawyers.”\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nThis course examines how land use is regulated and controlled. It begins by discussing why and when government regulation, rather than private market ordering, might be necessary to control land use and development patterns.

Finally, the course focuses on particular problems that plague the land use regulatory system, such as exclusionary zoning, the equitable distribution of undesirable land uses, sprawl, and smart growth.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nIssues of risk management and compliance are attracting increasing focus and attention throughout society and legal practice. Government regulation and regulatory oversight, industry-based codes of ethics, and standards of social responsibility and conduct all have been proliferating in recent years. These developments raise many issues for lawyers. This course will explore the law and practice relevant to these issues, principally from a transactional lawyer’s perspective. After a general introduction to risk and risk management, we will address a number of specific topics such as the reputational, operational and enterprise implications of risk, the transactional lawyer’s role in helping clients develop and manage appropriate and effective risk management and compliance programs, the tools available to the transactional lawyer to identify and help manage risks in the client’s transactions and business operations, and the transactional lawyer as “whistle blower” or “gate keeper.” Finally, we will examine the transactional lawyer’s own management of the risks she or he encounters in client representation (including the “bad actor” client, conflicts of interest, engagement letters and advance waivers, theories of attorney liability, transactional legal opinions, audit letter responses, and dealing with wayward partners and associates). We will use actual case studies to supplement our discussions.\n\nOffered: every other year\n\nThe course examines the goals of the U.S. health care system, which is designed to provide high-quality, affordable, and accessible health care. We will explore the regulation of health care professionals and institutions. The course will also discuss the contract, tort, and administrative law issues that come up in cases of informed consent, liability, malpractice, and end-of-life care. The course will also examine legal efforts to make health care affordable and accessible. We will study the regulation of both public and private insurance systems and use basic insurance principles to explore this area of law. Health law is complex for many reasons, including because it involves the interactions of state and federal statutes (and regulations) with longstanding principles of contract and tort law. The intersections between state and federal statutes and policies are also challenging. The 2010 Affordable Care Act will of course be a focus of the course.\n\nOffered: every other year\n\nThe principal objects of this course are to introduce law students to the civil law system, which is the legal system which exists in most counties in the world today, and to compare it to the common law system, the legal system which exists in the United States and in other countries whose legal systems were modeled on the law of England. The course will focus on the law of France, which is one of the principal civil law countries and whose legal system has been a model for many other nations in the civil law world. This course examines both private law (e.g., contracts, torts, property, inheritance, family law) and public law (e.g., constitutional law, administrative law, international law) as well as civil and criminal procedure. The course will also touch on those aspects of European Union law that intersect with French law. Comparisons with American law and legal institutions will be considered throughout the course.\n\nOur consideration of the civil law system as it exists in France today seeks to provide a systematic exposure to French law, both public and private, and its relevant contexts. Certain features of the French legal system which differ from U.S. institutions, doctrines, values, and practices are highlighted. Coverage is limited to France to allow for in-depth treatment of its legal system in keeping with another major goal of the course which is to provide a model of how to approach the study of foreign legal systems. France was chosen for a number of reasons.\n\nFor historical reasons, constitutional law developed quite differently in France from the way that it developed in the United States. France does not share many of the assumptions about constitutionalism which Americans take for granted or regard as self-evident (like judicial review, the role of judges, sources of law, federalism, etc.). The French also attach meanings different from ours to certain fundamental constitutional ideas, like separation of powers, separation of church and state, and equality. But France has a long tradition of enlightened and progressive government. It has pursued these ends through different legal and institutional arrangements. In the process, it has developed institutions, doctrines, procedures, attitudes, and preconceptions which differ from those with which we are familiar in the United States. Furthermore, French law and institutions have had an enormous influence in many parts of the world, including much of Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nThis is a foundation course in public international law that is primarily, though not exclusively, concerned with legal relations among states and public entities in the global system. The course explores the dynamics by which international law is made and applied by appraising trends and outcomes in international decision bearing on problems of world public order. The goal is to equip students to understand why past decisions were made, to devise methods for predicting future decisions, to develop methods for inventing decision alternatives both at the structural or constitutive level, and to identify the conceptions and skills necessary for influencing future decisions in the range of arenas in which international law is made and applied: parliamentary, diplomatic, judicial, and arbitral in national and international settings. Topics covered include: origins of international law, sources of international law, establishment and transformation of states and other actors, state recognition, diplomatic protection, jurisdiction, international courts and tribunals, international organizations, international human rights, resort to and use of force, nation-building, the regulation of international agreements, sovereign immunity, and enforcement of foreign judgments.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThis course provides an introduction to cybersecurity law, with a focus on the nuts and bolts of how lawyers assist organizations with managing cybersecurity risk, including regulatory compliance and response to data security incidents. It is designed to help students develop the research, analytical and practical skills necessary to deal with the technical and legal issues that may arise in connection with a data security incident, including data breach notification, regulatory investigations and enforcement, and litigation.\n\nThis course will use real world case studies, including a ransomware attack and the exfiltration of sensitive data from an organization involving exploitation of a network vulnerability, to illustrate and to teach some of the key technology fundamentals that lawyers need to understand to be able to work effectively with technical experts to assess the legal implications arising from cybersecurity incidents.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nThere are few fields of law more immediately pressing than information privacy law. The amount of personal information that businesses and governments collect about people, and the ways in which these actors use and share people’s personal information, are rapidly expanding. New technologies raise far-reaching questions about our society’s privacy expectations and cultural values; questions that the law plays a key role in answering.\n\nWhile the privacy challenges posed by the use of emerging technologies involving big data, artificial intelligence, facial recognition, biometrics, and more are indeed cutting-edge, in some respects they are nothing new. The law has been grappling with how to balance the tension between one person’s right to be let alone and another’s right to know for well over a\n\ncentury. The legal principles developed in response to earlier privacy threats find continued relevance as lawmakers and courts decide how to respond to the privacy threats of our day.\n\nThis course is designed to provide you with an introduction to the study of information privacy law and to equip you with the broad issue-spotting and other practical skills needed to navigate the complex array of legal, business, and public policy issues in this area. The course will span foundational privacy issues in the fields of constitutional law and tort law; consumer privacy protections; laws regarding the collection, use, storage, and transfer of personal information; sectoral privacy laws in the U.S.; and emerging issues in privacy law.\n\nThis course is a prerequisite for the Information Privacy Law Practicum – LAW 735.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThis course is designed to cover the “how” of being a privacy lawyer, including the ethics challenges confronted by in-house privacy counsel serving roles like Chief Privacy Officer and Data Protection Officer. Students will develop practical skills using real world problems in the information privacy and cybersecurity areas. Pragmatic guidance will be provided from experienced in-house and outside privacy counsel. Students will assume the roles of lawyers to perform tasks in hypothetical situations. The goal is to give students the chance to integrate legal theory, practical skills and ethics while engaging in a number of professional skills in a classroom setting.\n\nCase studies will be drawn from various real world examples such as: Cambridge Analytica/Facebook, Equifax data breach and compliance with GDPR to form the basis for a number of different exercises. The exercises will focus on key areas of privacy and cybersecurity legal practice. By way of example, such exercises might focus on the following topics:\n\nPrivacy impact assessments — providing advice with respect to when and how to use them, how to go about completing them, tools available for completing assessments and how to utilize the results of the assessment, including action steps to take based on the assessment.\n\nCommercial transactions between parties involving the transfer and handling of personal information — drafting and negotiating contract provisions (from the perspective of both parties) that address privacy and data security concerns (e.g. Data processing agreements) and the related regulatory and other risks associated with handling personal information.\n\nData breach notification — providing end to end advice to a business that is the victim of a data breach, beginning with the initial notification of the security incident, working with the IT and forensics teams to figure out what happened and how to contain the incident, determining whether there are any breach notification obligations, crafting the breach notification letter, responding to regulatory inquiries and enforcement actions, crafting notice of claim to insurance carriers of third party providers that may be at fault, pursuing insurance claims, defending and bringing litigations, and negotiating resolution of such claims and disputes.\n\nPre-requisite: Information Privacy Law (Law 777)\n\nOffered: every other year\n\nThis course is designed for students interested in developing practical litigation skills and strategies applicable to a wide variety of disputes. We will focus on issues that frequently emerge in civil litigation, both straightforward and complex. For example, we will cover questions relating to aggregate litigation, such as class actions and multidistrict litigation. We will also cover certain aspects of the discovery process, including management of discovery in an age when significant amounts of information exists in electronic form. Finally, we will cover the interaction between alternative dispute resolution and litigation, including mandatory and non-mandatory mediation, individual arbitration, and mass arbitration. The course will cover theory (understanding the legal doctrine that underlies the rules and statutes we discuss), practice (how these rules and statutes operate in day-to-day civil litigation), and strategy (developing holistic approaches for managing a case beginning-to-end). Student evaluation will be based on written assignments; there will be no final examination.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nThis course deals with legal problems that have contact with more than one jurisdiction (i.e., with more than one state in the United States or with the United States or a U.S. state and a foreign country). As one would expect, given modern transportation and communication (especially the Internet) and the globalization of the economy, the number of transactions, relations, and occurrences across state and national lines having legal implications is now enormous. Today it is very likely that a contract, tort, real or personal property, probate, domestic relations, or other common legal problem implicates more than one jurisdiction. This course considers the structuring of transactions so as to anticipate and provide for many of these problems (e.g., in drafting legal documents like commercial contracts, shareholder agreements, wills and trusts, prenuptial agreements, etc.) and the conduct of litigation involving multi-jurisdictional elements. Specific matters covered are the jurisdiction of courts to litigate matters involving out-of-state actors (like tortfeasors or contractual partners), the recognition and enforcement of sister-state and foreign-country judgments, and choice of law (i.e., what substantive and procedural rules a court will apply to a legal matter with multi-jurisdictional contacts).\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nThis is a hands-on, experiential skills building course. Increasingly, attorneys who litigate are doing so not before judges or juries, but before regulatory bodies or officers—for example, on issues of planning and zoning, unemployment/social security benefits, environmental permitting, tax review, and asylum to name just a few. The art of advocating for clients in a regulatory arena has differences from a courtroom—oftentimes the adjudicators are laypeople, the rules of evidence do not apply, there may be no discovery, and one must master varying (by agency) procedural rules. This course will begin with an overview of the administrative adjudicatory process, with a primary focus upon Maine law, and then an overview of the relevant environmental law and regulations relating to development projects. As a “practicum” students will develop necessary practical lawyering skills by engaging in a variety of written and oral advocacy exercises using a Maine wind power project simulation; you will one class be representing the developer, the next class representing the opponents. You will draft and orally present to classmates a client memo, op-ed, and a recommended decision on the project. You also will do an expert witness exercise, present an opening or closing argument, and address ethical issues.\n\nOffered: every other year\n\nThis course provides: (1) an orientation to the key rules, concepts, and controversies concerning the presentation and admission of evidence in criminal and civil trials; and (2) an introduction to the specific skills used by attorneys in litigation as proponents and opponents of evidence. Specifically, we will examine: the overall structure of trials; how evidentiary disputes are raised and resolved; the examination and impeachment of witnesses; relevance; character evidence; hearsay; and opinion testimony. The goal is to gain a solid grounding in the key rules, concepts, and controversies to enable you to use the rules strategically and effectively in your own cases (whether in Trial Practice, a clinical or externship course, or your practice), to critically evaluate the evidence rules and their application, and to understand how the rules operate in conjunction with substantive law (i.e. criminal law, tort law, etc.). Accordingly, we will study not only the rules’ explicit requirements and prohibitions but also the policy goals and assumptions underlying the rules. The Federal Rules of Evidence will be our primary focus for the course; however, you are also responsible for learning some important distinctions between the Federal and Maine Rules of Evidence.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nIssues of risk management and compliance are attracting increasing focus and attention throughout society and legal practice. Government regulation and regulatory oversight, industry-based codes of ethics, and standards of social responsibility and conduct all have been proliferating in recent years. These developments raise many issues for lawyers. This course will explore the law and practice relevant to these issues, principally from a transactional lawyer’s perspective. After a general introduction to risk and risk management, we will address a number of specific topics such as the reputational, operational and enterprise implications of risk, the transactional lawyer’s role in helping clients develop and manage appropriate and effective risk management and compliance programs, the tools available to the transactional lawyer to identify and help manage risks in the client’s transactions and business operations, and the transactional lawyer as “whistle blower” or “gate keeper.” Finally, we will examine the transactional lawyer’s own management of the risks she or he encounters in client representation (including the “bad actor” client, conflicts of interest, engagement letters and advance waivers, theories of attorney liability, transactional legal opinions, audit letter responses, and dealing with wayward partners and associates). We will use actual case studies to supplement our discussions.\n\nOffered: every other year\n\nTrial Evidence and Advocacy is a 6-credit, integrated course that will both teach students the Federal and Maine Rules of Evidence and how to apply them in practical, experiential exercises based upon simulated adjudicatory proceedings. The combination of subjects will enable students to immediately put into practice the concepts they are learning, and to better remember the rules of evidence and advocacy principles. Because 65-70% of adjudication actually occurs in an administrative setting, rather than a courtroom, and people are ten times more likely to be tried by an agency than by a court, this course will train students to be effective advocates in whatever forum their future clients find themselves. Thus, students will learn the basic skills that are necessary to be an effective advocate whether involved in a jury or non-jury trial, or in an adjudicatory hearing before an agency or board.\n\nStudents will learn how to develop both a “theme” and “theory” for their client, and learn to how to make proper opening and closing statements, conduct direct and cross-examinations of witnesses, and how to properly present and object to evidence, including expert testimony. Faculty will utilize simulations, role-playing, demonstrations, and individual evaluation and feedback. At the end of the semester, students will try both a Bench Trial and a Jury Trial, which serve to bring together all the elements of a trial in simulated settings.\n\nThis class is designed to help you develop (1) a working knowledge of the FRE and MRE; (2) an ability to quickly and accurately solve evidentiary problems; (3) knowledge and understanding of key cases that discuss and analyze the FRE; (4) an understanding of the theory, purpose, goals, and implications of the FRE and MRE; and (5) the ability to both prepare and present persuasive, focused and compelling oral and written communication of your issues, regardless of whether you are representing the moving party or defendant, and regardless of whether your audience is a trial judge, jury, administrative law judge, or other tribunal.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThis course is designed to prepare law students to conduct effective legal research in any setting; while working on a scholarly article or paper, or working as a judicial clerk, as a practitioner in a firm, government, or solo practice. Students will learn about the development of legal research tools and how to evaluate print and electronic resources for currency, authority, comprehensiveness, and utility. By the end of the course, students should be familiar with the entire universe of legal resources, be confident when using online sources, and be able to conduct professional-level legal research in any field, on any legal topic. The course will be divided into two major segments: a lecture and discussion section and a practical “lab” meeting in the library. During these lab sessions the students will use the resources discussed in the lecture portion of the course to conduct hands-on research using traditional print resources as well as electronic resources. Grades will be based on a combination of class participation, research assignments, and two larger writing assignments: a website review and a pathfinder on a topic of the students’ choosing.\n\nOffered: occasionally\n\nThis course is designed to prepare students for the bar exam by focusing on skill development. Specifically, students will receive in-depth skill instruction on legal problem solving, reading comprehension, issue identification, rule mastery, critical thinking, legal analysis, and time management. Students will also gain a strong conceptual understanding and knowledge of highly tested doctrines on the Maine Bar Exam and will be taught how to develop, use, and apply a flexible but strong analytical framework to solve bar exam problems. Students will complete several diagnostic exams and assessments during class and will be provided with written feedback on their performance.\n\nAlthough the major focus of this class is material that is specific to the Maine Bar Exam, we will spend significant time addressing general bar exam test-taking strategies with a keen focus on the Multistate Bar Exam (MBE), essay, and Multistate Performance Test (MPT), which are non-state specific and common to almost all bar exams across the country. Therefore, even though the primary focus of the class is the Maine Bar Exam, students who will sit for bar exams in other jurisdictions will greatly benefit from the class.\n\nThe course is intended to supplement, not replace, commercial bar preparation courses.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nUpper-class students may form a group under the guidance of a professor for the purpose of studying an area of the law that is not the subject of a currently-offered course. Group studies may not be composed of fewer than four or more than fourteen students. Such groups must be approved by the Curriculum Committee at least four weeks prior to the beginning of the semester. The members of the group must conduct weekly meetings and each member must submit an individual paper at the end of the semester.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nOn occasion an upper-class student may wish to pursue independent study, leading toward an original work of publishable quality. If the student secures faculty supervision and the approval of the Vice Dean / Provost, two course credits may be given. Among the factors which the Vice Dean / Provost will consider are whether the study and the resultant paper will be of substantial educational value, the amount of time and effort required to ensure compliance with ABA Standards and Maine Law policies, and whether the study will not be duplicative of the student’s other efforts or previous work. In exceptional circumstances the Vice Dean/Provost may approve the granting of one credit for reworking a previous paper toward publication.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThe Law Review provides students with an invaluable two-year research, editing, and writing experience that allows each to explore in-depth a legal issue of particular interest. Recent editions have contained student notes examining diverse issues of Maine law, such as the enforceability of local food ordinances, gestational surrogacy contracts, and the extent to which Miranda applies to matter-of-fact-communications with arrestees. Membership on the Law Review is by invitation based on academic performance and writing skills. The Law Review’s staff and board members usually total a combined 29 students. In general, the top six students from the rising second-year class are invited to join the Law Review based on their academic performance, leaving 9 membership positions available for those individuals who are selected after participating in an extensive summer writing competition.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThe Ocean and Coastal Law Journal (OCLJ) is dedicated to facilitating discourse on legal issues related to domestic and international use of the sea and seashores. OCLJ provides two years of research, writing, and editing experience to its student editors, who are required to produce a comment or two case notes of publishable quality on an ocean or coastal issue during their second year. In addition to fulfilling their writing requirement, student editors become familiar with current issues in the field of ocean and coastal law while carefully editing works accepted for publication. Generally, OCLJ will select ten (10) rising second year students to join the Journal each year. Five (5) of these positions are awarded based on first-year academic performance alone, while the other five (5) are selected based on the write-on competition held each summer after the end of students’ first year.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nThe Student Journal of Information Privacy Law (SJIPL) is dedicating to publishing student-authored scholarship on the topic of information privacy law. Published papers may be written by students at Maine Law or solicited from students at other schools. The SJIPL publishes three categories of papers: (a) shorter-form commentary blog posts; (b) papers written by Maine Law students to satisfy their Information Privacy Law Certificate requirement; and (c) traditional law journal articles, in paginated volumes published online. Student editors will gain experience researching, writing, and editing papers about information privacy law. Membership on the journal is by invitation based in part on students’ commitments to the study of information privacy law. As the SJIPL is new, the number of students selected to join the journal and the specific process for joining will vary over the next few semesters. The SJIPL’s executive board will make an announcement with more detail on applying for membership on the journal around the time when registration opens up.\n\nOffered: every year\n\nFederal income taxation of partners and partnerships (and other business entities such as limited liability companies that are treated as partnerships for tax purposes) is governed by a tax regime that is separate and distinct from those that govern the taxation of individuals (Taxation I) and corporations and their shareholders (Taxation II). The course focuses on various aspects of this unique tax regime including the considerations that affect choice of entity and qualification as a partnership, and the tax consequences to the partnership and its partners in connection with the formation, operation and termination of a partnership, the sale of partnership interests and property, distributions from the partnership to its members and allocations of income, losses, deductions and credits.\n\nPre-requisites: Taxation I (LAW 649).\n\nOffered: occasionally"
