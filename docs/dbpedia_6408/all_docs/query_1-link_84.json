        "text": "Congratulations on the publication of The Asian Law and Society Reader. Given that this is a developing field in Asian scholarship, was it difficult to find enough strong contributors? How do you hope the book will be used?\n\nAcross Asia, there is a growing demand among policymakers for law-related research that goes beyond the study of legal theory and philosophy and asks how Asian legal systems actually work. My co-authors, Lynette Chua and Sida Liu, have been key figures in addressing this need. We’ve witnessed exciting initiatives in the training of Asian law students and a new generation of scholars eager to learn about Law and Society research in their own countries.\n\nThis reader is meant to benefit them, but it’s also designed for a general audience interested in learning more about the countries and cultures of Asia. We considered hundreds of books and articles—there were plenty to choose from—and ended up with studies of 29 countries. We also provide extensive commentaries on each topic. This book is intended as a general introduction to the field of Law and Society scholarship and to the laws, cultures and societies of Asia.\n\nThe new book’s cover image is your own photo. Can you speak to the discussions that led to that choice?\n\nWorking with Cambridge University Press to find an appropriate image for the cover raised some of the same issues that the book itself deals with. Typically, books about Asia feature images of temples or religious art or dance, but our book deals with many different religions—Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity among them. We didn’t want to feature one religious tradition to the exclusion of others. Moreover, in some belief systems it might be offensive to portray any sentient being at all. So it became a challenge to find an image that seemed “Asian” yet was not religious and didn’t show people or animals.\n\nWe settled on a photo I had taken while walking in the mountains of northern Thailand. It shows this amazingly beautiful pond full of reflected palms and flowers and the image—and reflection—of a pink water lily. In its totality, this photograph seemed to capture some of the deeper meanings of our book.\n\nThrough your workshops in Singapore, you’ve put great energy into developing Law and Society scholarship among Asian academics. Are there aspects of Asian societies that particularly lend themselves to study through this lens?\n\nAlmost all Asian societies feature legal systems that have been transplanted from other countries, including England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the U.S. and Russia. These foreign laws were superimposed on centuries-old legal traditions and on localized village-level customary practices. As a result, there are striking differences between the official legal system of judges, lawyers and legal scholars and the law-related practices and beliefs that are more familiar to Asian people.\n\nJapanese legal scholars in the early 20th century were among the first to recognize the importance of these differences, and they helped to create the field of Law and Society worldwide. Many other researchers came to recognize that studying transplanted legal doctrine alone would tell them very little about the hybrid, pluralistic quality of law in Asian settings. Perhaps for that reason, scholars of Asian law have been drawn to the Law and Society field in growing numbers.\n\nAnother recent project is co-editing a compilation of U.S. and international scholars writing about the civil justice system. What draws you to this area of study, and how might this volume inform thinking about making the civil justice system more accessible to all who might have a claim?\n\nAnne Bloom, Richard Jolly and I are preparing the Research Handbook on the Civil Justice System (Elgar Publishing) with contributions from 28 distinguished scholars based in the U.S. and in other countries. All of them are concerned with how and whether legal institutions offer meaningful remedies for individuals who seek justice when their rights are infringed.\n\nMy own interest draws on my four decades as a torts professor and on my interviews with hundreds of individuals who have been injured or whose civil rights have been violated yet feel hopeless when it comes to seeking help from the legal system. The task of making the civil justice system more accessible may be a bit like pushing the same boulder repeatedly up the mountain, yet the authors contributing to this volume have never given up hope.\n\nYour book The Myth of the Litigious Society: Why We Don’t Sue has drawn the attention of, among others, Ralph Nader, who recently invited you to present in a panel discussion he chaired. What if anything has changed in Americans’ attitudes toward the tort system since its publication in 2016?\n\nAmericans will always have an ambivalent attitude toward the tort system. They will cheer Erin Brockovich for fighting the system on behalf of the little guy, but ridicule Saul Goodman for trying to convert human misfortune into big bucks. I don’t expect that to change."
