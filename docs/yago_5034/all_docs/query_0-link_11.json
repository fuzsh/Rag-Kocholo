        "text": "Is Jimmy Fallon headed for divorce? The Tonight Show host has taken another hit as reports that his “marriage is in crisis” make headlines. Just last month, Fallon had to answer for allegations of a toxic working environment on set, and now, sources close to the couple say that Jimmy Fallon and his wife Nancy Juvonen are “fighting a lot.”\n\nThe couple have been married for 16 years and have two daughters together, and while sources say it isn’t uncommon for there to be tension in their marriage, “this is different,” and “it’s been particularly bad recently.” Keep reading to find out more about Jimmy & Nancy’s rocky relationship.\n\nJimmy Fallon parties hard while his wife stays at home with the kids\n\nA source close to the couple told In Touch that things between Jimmy and Nancy started to go downhill during the writers’ strike. “They were fighting a lot, arguing over money, living arrangements, and his drinking,” the source says. “She’s very, very controlling, and it’s taking a toll.”\n\nThe same source also added that while Jimmy “can be a great guy,” he has “demons and he can be selfish.” Reports of this selfishness include Jimmy’s habit of going out and partying while his wife stays home with their children, Winnie, 10, and Frances 8. The comedian has been spotted at many local spots including Basil Leaf, Laura’s, and Garvies Point, and is “always drinking and rowdy” at these locations.\n\n“He would jump on stage and sing, take pics, he was not subtle,” a second source says. And Nancy’s patience is apparently wearing thin: “Nancy has let him get away with murder in the past,” the source continued. “But this is different, they’re never together.”\n\nShutterstock/Splash News\n\nJimmy Fallon faces backlash for toxic working environment at The Tonight Show\n\nOne former employee of The Tonight Show told Rolling Stone that the set has a \"glum atmosphere\" and it wasn't uncommon for Jimmy to have \"outbursts.\" Other employees report three different instances of the actor showing up to work drunk, once in 2017, 2019, and 2020.\n\n\"When something was wrong, we all knew how to behave afterward,\" the former staffer recalled. \"Avoid eye contact and don't make another mistake.\" They also added that \"it would happen over the smallest thing… We would have to shut the whole thing down, the sketch isn't happening, and when things like that would happen, you would just beat yourself up.\"\n\nAnother former employee spoke up and shared how the show affected him mentally: \"Mentally, I was in the lowest place of my life,\" they said, \"You never knew which Jimmy we were going to get and when he was going to throw a hissy fit.\"\n\nA spokesperson for NBC gave a statement in response in September. \"Providing a respectful working environment is a top priority,\" the statement read. \"As in any workplace, we have had employees raise issues; those have been investigated and action has been taken where appropriate.\"\n\nJimmy himself responded to the backlash in a private Zoom meeting with Tonight Show employees. \"It's embarrassing and I feel so bad,\" Jimmy said. \"Sorry if I embarrassed you and your family and friends...I feel so bad, I can't even tell you.\"\n\nShutterstock/Splash News\n\nFans are not happy with Jimmy Fallon\n\nMany fans shared their opinions on Jimmy's recent bad press in comments on In Touch’s article. One user wrote, \"Once you have children, both parents need to stop partying all the time. One going out all the time getting drunk is not good. I find it selfish.\"\n\nAnother commented, \"Jimmy's a known partier… that will never change ‘til his liver gives out,\" while a third user replied, \"hearing how he treated his staff made me like him less. Behavioral problems need to be addressed.\"\n\nAnother comment reads, \"If you have two young kids, you should not be out partying and boozing it up all the time.\" A final comment took it a step further, calling out Fallon and saying, \"he needs to go to rehab!\"\n\nBut, as always, there is another side to the story. Other sources close to the couple are very happily married, and that Jimmy is very involved in his childrens' lives. \"Jimmy is constantly seen out at drop-off, with his wife and kids both in the valley and the city,\" the source says. \"They love to hang out and do activities all together.\""
