        "text": "Jimmy Fallon enjoyed some quality family time during Fourth of July weekend.\n\nThe late-night talk show host, 48, shared a rare family photo alongside his wife Nancy Juvonen and daughters Frances Cole, 8, and Winnie Rose, 9, on Sunday.\n\nIn the snap, the foursome flashed huge smiles while posing on a sunlit dock during their vacation at Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire.\n\nFallon, who dressed casually in khakis and a pink polo-shirt, held up his youngest daughter as Juvonen, 56, wrapped her arms around their eldest.\n\nWhile their two girls donned white tops and skirts, the film producer stunned in an all-black ensemble and platform sandals.\n\n“I agreed to take this photo only if I could stand on the dry side of the dock. Happy 2nd of July!” the comedian captioned the photo on Instagram.\n\nAlthough Fallon rarely shares photos of his daughters online, the former “Saturday Night Live” star gave insight into how fatherhood has changed him back in 2020.\n\n“My biggest revelation is how much I ended up caring for other people’s kids if that makes any sense. You get it more,” he told Fatherly.\n\n“When I didn’t have kids, if I heard a crying baby in the restaurant, I would think, ‘Can you stop the crying and go around the block?’ Now I would be like, ‘Just give me the baby — how can I help? I’ve been there.’”\n\nNot only did he gain a bit more compassion, but he also became more in tune with his emotions.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“I was always kind of emotional — I think it’s my Irish-Catholic upbringing,” he continued. “Now, Hallmark is for me now. I’m ready for a good cry.”\n\nThe “Tonight Show” host has also released two best-selling children’s books since becoming a dad.\n\nFallon, who wed Juvonen in 2007, has had a bit more time to spend with his family amid the ongoing writers strike.\n\nThe talk show host has been supportive of his writing staff ever since they decided to go on strike in May — even paying his workers out of his own pocket while the “Tonight Show” is put on pause."
