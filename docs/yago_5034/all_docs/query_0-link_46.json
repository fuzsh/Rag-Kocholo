She was also set to guest host the fourth hour of the show with Hoda Kotb. However, Kelly decided to pull the plug on the hosting gig because she and her team were displeased with her dressing room — Team Kelly apparently wanted the bigger dressing room Jennifer Lopez was occupying at that moment.\n\n\"Kelly and her team were not happy. They did not like the dressing room, so they decided to pull her off the show, leaving Hoda without a guest host for the 10 a.m. hour,\" a source told Page Six.\n\n_\n\nKelly Rowland's sudden exit stunned \"Today\" show producers.\n\n\"She's beloved at 'Today.'

It's the oldest building. There are major space limitations, [it's] not glamorous. It's not fresh flowers and candles and gourmet food. It's basically [a] white box,\" the insider said.\n\n_\n\nIt seems that Kelly Rowland was offered multiple dressing room options, including a large utility makeup and hair area.\n\n\"They didn't want that.

Due to the hospitalization of Democratic Rep. Al Green, Republicans believed they had the votes to impeach the cabinet member. However, the Texas congressman stunned his colleagues after rushing back following abdominal surgery to vote \"no,\" all while sitting in a wheelchair and wearing hospital scrubs. The vote failed 216-214. Four Republicans joined the Democrats in their \"no\" votes, but one of those votes was done as a procedural matter so that the vote can be brought up again.\n\nFollowing the House drama and the unsuccessful vote, many in the House chambers reacted. From his hospital bed, Al Green, himself, told The New York Times, \"I was determined to cast the vote long before — I had no idea how close it was going to be. I didn't come assuming that my vote was going to make a difference. I came because it was personal.\"\n\nKeep clicking to see how others in Congress are reacting….\n\nMORE: Follow Wonderwall on MSN for more fun celebrity & entertainment photo galleries and content\n\n_\n\n\"The sham impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas was demanded by Donald Trump and is being led by Marjorie Taylor Greene.

In fact, they were so committed that they reportedly \"exchanged vows\" in 2017.\n\nOn Aug. 8, DailyMail.com published a video of the couple dancing on the beach in the Bahamas allegedly following an intimate ceremony during which they exchanged vows.\n\nThe Grosby Group / BACKGRID\n\n\"They really did this for the children, to kind of seal the deal and show them this was a forever thing. After the ceremony [Sandra's kids] Louis and Laila started calling Bryan dad,\" a source shared.\n\nThe Academy Award-winning actress and began dating the model-turned-photographer in 2015 after they met when he photographed her son's birthday party. Although Sandra has spoken publicly about never wanting to marry again, she called Bryan \"the love of my life\" on a 2021 episode of \"Red Table Talk.\"\n\n\"We share two beautiful children — three children, [including Bryan's] older daughter. It's the best thing ever,\" she said. At the time, she didn't reference his health issues.\n\nBryan passed away on Aug. 5 following a secret three-year battle with ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. He was 57.\n\nSkyler2018 / BACKGRID\n\nWhile Sandra's sister said the actress was there until the end, an insider told DailyMail.com that Bryan's illness did strain their relationship. But they were \"more together than ever\" at the time of his death, the insider added. Sandra also arranged and paid for his around-the-clock care.\n\nInterestingly, split rumors had surrounded the couple for the better part of a year, largely due to the fact they hadn't been seen together in public for a while. That speculation actually helped them keep his health battle private.\n\nJim Ruymen/UPI/Shutterstock\n\n\"Sandra kept Bryan hidden away in the back of the house. It's so big that you could conceal what was going on with him but towards the end she really didn't let people into the home beyond the doctors and nurses who were looking after him,\" the insider said. \"It was quite convenient for them to have these rumors that they'd broken up because it helped conceal what was really going on. It was easier to let people assume they hadn't seen him because they were no longer together.\"\n\nA separate source noted, \"The relationship was absolutely strained by it, and it was really hard for the children. He had been living in one of her Malibu properties for a while just because it was nicer for him to be there, by the ocean, and I think some people assumed they had split because it looked like they were living separately, but there weren't. She'd have the house stocked up with everything he needed, and his nurses would go there.\"\n\nBACKGRID\n\nAccording to a statement from Bryan's family released after his death, \"Bryan chose early to keep his journey with ALS private and those of us who cared for him did our best to honor his request.\" The statement continued, \"We are immensely grateful to the tireless doctors who navigated the landscape of this illness with us and to the astounding nurses who became our roommates, often sacrificing their own families to be with ours. At this time we ask for privacy to grieve and to come to terms with the impossibility of saying goodbye to Bryan.\" The statement was signed by, \"His Loving Family.\"\n\nBizarre, terrible incident\n\nSinger's nanny killed in freak accident after elderly driver crashed SUV into reception area at car dealership\n\nYadira Calito — who nannied Katharine McPhee and David Foster's son — died in a freak accident after she was run over by an SUV at a car dealership in the Los Angeles area.\n\nAccording to reports, an unnamed 84-year-old woman went to a San Fernando Valley car dealership on Aug. 11 to get her Toyota RAV4 serviced. She then somehow hit the gas pedal rather than the brakes, launching her vehicle from the service bay driveway into the customer reception area.\n\nMediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nYadira, who was at the dealership, suddenly found herself pinned under the car and was dragged for about 20 feet, TMZ reported. Kat and David's nanny was eventually freed from under the car and, according to DailyMail.com, an off-duty nurse started performing CPR on her before emergency services arrived.\n\nThe nanny to Kat and David's 2-year-old son, Rennie, was eventually transported to a hospital in critical condition but later died.\n\nTwo men working at the dealership were also injured in the shocking incident, but their injuries were not life-threatening. The driver of the car stayed on site to answer authorities' questions and declined to be taken to the hospital. She was not arrested.\n\nImages from the crash — which occurred around 9 a.m. — show the white SUV parked among shattered glass.\n\nJason Merritt/Radarpics/REX/Shutterstock\n\nUpon learning about Yadira's injuries and death Katharine — who found fame as a runner-up on \"American Idol\" in 2006 — canceled two shows in Asia, where she was touring with her Grammy-winning husband.\n\n\"Dearest Jakarta fans, it's with heavy heart I announce I have to miss our final two shows of our Asia run,\" she wrote on Instagram on Aug. 11 without providing further details. \"David and I have had a horrible tragedy in our family and at least one of us need to get back home to our family.\"\n\nShe added, \"Please know how sorry I am and how much I wish to return one day and perform for you all. Love Katharine.\"\n\nThe songstress flew back to Los Angeles the same day. TMZ reported that the superstar couple considered Yadira \"family.\" After several celebrity friends, including David's ex-wife Linda Thompson, commented with well wishes, Kat disabled the comments section of her Instagram.\n\nOn Aug. 17, the car dealership, Hamer Toyota, issued a statement about what happened. \"We extend our deepest condolences to Yadira's family, friends, and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time. The loss of such a vibrant life in such tragic circumstances is a heavy burden to bear, and we share in their grief,\" the dealership's director of communications told Us Weekly.\n\n\"At Hamer Toyota, we take the safety of our customers and our community very seriously. We are fully cooperating with the Los Angeles Police Department as they conduct their investigation into this unfortunate event,\" the spokesperson added. \"Our commitment is to ensure transparency, assist the LAPD in every possible way, and to learn from this incident so we can prevent such tragedies in the future. In these moments of profound sadness, we ask our community to join us in remembering Yadira and extending our collective support to her loved ones.\"\n\nRunning for office\n\nViral tanning salon mom reveals why she's running for a U.S. Senate seat in Florida as a Republican\n\nRemember \"Tan Mom\"? In 2012, she went viral after she took her 5-year-old daughter to a New Jersey tanning salon. Now the pop culture personality — whose real name is Patricia Krentcil — is running for office.\n\nKristina Bumphrey/Starpix/Shutterstock\n\nOn Jan. 15, 2023, Patricia filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for a U.S. Senate seat in Florida, TMZ confirmed. She's challenging incumbent GOP senator Rick Scott in the 2024 election — and she's running as a Republican despite not exactly following the party line on multiple issues, especially amid a controversy-filled political climate in Florida, where she now calls Boca Raton home.\n\nPatricia spoke to \"TMZ Live\" to explain why she's running, explaining that she's not a fan of some of Republican governor Ron DeSantis's controversial policies and thinks others in her party feel the same way.\n\nMORE: Stars who became politicians\n\n\"I was blessed and was able to be a part of raising money for the Sunshine Cathedral in Florida. I saw the amazing work they had done and it really impressed me,\" Patricia told TMZ, referring to the Ft. Lauderdale church with a ministry based in progressive Christianity that has a constituency of same-gender and gender non-conforming people and prides itself on being a safe and open community for LGBTQ+ people to worship.\n\nPatricia also said she's concerned about the banning of books in her new home state. \"I was horrified about the book banning [in schools] in Florida … just a lot of the episodes that are going on here,\" she told TMZ. \"And nobody is addressing them.\"\n\nMediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nShe also said Medicaid was an issue for her, as she believes it's \"just being abominably banished for the elderly especially. That's three reasons I started doing this,\" she added of what sparked her interest in going to Washington.\n\nDuring their chat, TMZ founder Harvey Levin pointed out that Patricia's positions make her sound more like a Democrat than a Republican. But according to her, she's running as Republican because \"I've always been a Republican and my feeling and my issues may sound more Democratic but I am a Republican through and through,\" she insisted.\n\n\"I'm trying to embrace it for people who realize the situation at hand, more today than it ever was, and maybe if I sound more like a Republican, Republicans need to take this not for granted,\" she continued.\n\nTaylor Hill/Getty Images\n\nShe's hoping people will see her in a new light. \"I don't want to be known as what I was as 'Tan Mom.' I've grown and I'm here to help and want to help people that are struggling,\" she said. \"And maybe more Republicans should have a different taste in their mouth when they're trying to help people in the world today.\"\n\nPatricia further told TMZ, \"I know that I am different. And I have suffered for it. But us all being different is what makes this country so amazing and unique.\"\n\nAccording to the New York Post, her candidacy comes as she's starring in the TV docuseries \"Tan to 10,\" which chronicles her efforts to stop tanning and change her life. Patricia – who went to rehab for alcohol addiction in 2013 – named her producers Gregg Maliff and Adam Barta as her campaign managers.\n\nDone deal?\n\nPrincess of Pop and actor-trainer husband of 14 months are divorcing\n\nBritney Spears and her husband of 14 months, Sam Asghari, are divorcing.\n\nTMZ reported on Aug. 16 that the duo separated the previous week after a \"nuclear argument\" during which Sam confronted her over unconfirmed rumors that she'd been unfaithful.\n\n\"It's only a matter of time before Sam files for divorce,\" a source shared.\n\nVivien Killilea/Getty Images for GLAAD\n\nSam filed for divorce later the same day, citing \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason for the split and listing July 28 as their date of separation. In court documents, he's asking for spousal support and attorneys fees.\n\nThe writing was seemingly on the wall, as reports of blowout fights and arguments between the two have been floating around for several months. In May, a TMZ documentary claimed their marriage was in \"deep trouble\" and that Sam was rarely staying in their home. Britney even ditched her wedding ring during a spring vacation in Puerto Rico.\n\nSam was simply at his \"wits' end\" with Britney's often erratic behavior, the webloid reported.\n\nPublicly, though, Sam has backed his wife, recently defending her following a physical incident with an NBA player in Las Vegas in July.\n\nMediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nBritney and Sam met in 2016 when he starred in one of her music videos. They quickly began dating and became rather inseparable. The couple got engaged in the midst of her conservatorship battle, and they eventually tied the knot in June 2022.\n\nPrior to their 2022 wedding, the \"Toxic\" singer's lawyers set up an \"ironclad prenup\" to ensure the finances and assets Britney had going into the marriage would remain hers should she and Sam ever call it quits. Britney has an estimated net worth of $60 million. Regardless, it's believed that she will likely settle things with Sam financially. Divorce docs hint at a potential prenup challenge, TMZ reported, with Sam's attorney noting the actor-trainer \"has yet to determine the full nature and extent of the separate property assets and obligations of each party\" and that \"There are various items of community and quasi-community assets and debts, the full nature and extent of which are unknown to [Sam] at this time.\"\n\nHer crumbling marriage is just one piece of the troubling puzzle involving the Princess of Pop. According to a February TMZ report, those close to Britney felt an intervention was direly needed because people around her had become deeply alarmed by what TMZ described as \"her erratic, volatile behavior.\" A source told the webloid that the singer was taking medications that \"hype her up\" — but not taking the medications that stabilize her — and that she'd been \"flying off the handle\" with increasing regularity. But an intervention was suddenly scrapped, TMZ reported, after Britney caught wind of it. \"I'm afraid she's gonna die,\" one source in regular contact with Britney told TMZ at the time.\n\nHome Depot lawsuit\n\n'Fast & Furious' star sues The Home Depot for $450M for discriminating against him\n\nSinger-actor Tyrese Gibson is accusing The Home Depot of discrimination and racial profiling after an incident in February that occurred at one of the brand's California stores.\n\nDia Dipasupil/Getty Images\n\nOn Aug. 9, the \"Fast & Furious\" franchise star and two other plaintiffs — Eric Mora and Manuel Hernandez, craftsmen who've provided construction services to the singer-actor — filed a lawsuit claiming \"outrageous discriminatory mistreatment and consumer racial profiling\" at a Home Depot in West Hills, California, on Feb. 11, 2023.\n\nNBC News reported that in the complaint, Tyrese says he, Eric and Manuel went to The Home Depot together to buy some materials for a project they were doing at his home. A cashier allegedly took 20 minutes to ring up the items. Meanwhile, other shoppers began recognizing and approaching the actor, prompting him to wait in his vehicle to prevent a disturbance. Before he went outside, Tyrese told the cashier that the craftsmen with him would complete the sale on his behalf. The suit claims Eric and Manuel were not allowed to do so, which led Tyrese to come back inside to show ID so they could finish the transaction. He asked to speak to a manager, who allegedly refused.\n\nRob Latour/Shutterstock\n\n\"The actions of the cashier and manager were discriminatory based on race and origin,\" the complaint states. \"There is no other plausible explanation for the mistreatment of Plaintiffs. The transaction was refused, despite Gibson's repeated authorizations, because of Plaintiffs' skin color and, in the case of Mora and Hernandez, also because of their national origin.\"\n\nThe suit calls the \"humiliating and demeaning\" interaction \"a clear and deplorable instance of discriminatory mistreatment and consumer racial profiling\" and further alleges that The Home Depot has \"doubled down, lawyered-up\" instead of holding itself accountable for what transpired. In short, The Home Depot \"invited this civil rights lawsuit,\" the complaint further alleges. \"This is the absolute height of hypocrisy for a company that disingenuously promotes itself to the world as 'an environment of mutual respect that is free of harassment and discrimination.'\"\n\nAccording to court documents, the three plaintiffs are seeking more than $1 million in damages, which Entertainment Weekly reported is how much Tyrese estimates he's spent at The Home Depot over the years, plus statutory damages, attorney's fees, punitive damages, a declaratory judgment confirming that The Home Depot's actions violated California's Unruh Civil Rights Act, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest and also \"such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper.\"\n\nKristina Bumphrey/Starpix/Shutterstock\n\nThe actor's team released a statement on his Instagram page on Aug. 11 alongside a video of Tyrese speaking to The Home Depot staff inquiring about their policies. According to the social media post, they're seeking a total of $450 million in damages.\n\n\"Craftsmen Eric Mora and Manuel Hernandez are an integral part of my team and have made significant contributions to my visions for over a decade. Together, we ardently uphold our commitments to civil rights, promoting empathy, and understanding,\" the statement began. It continued, \"The Home Depot, we envision a world free from discriminatory practices and consumer racial profiling. Just as I have done for the past 20-plus years, I pledge to continue to utilize my platform to empower the voiceless, fostering a spirit of unity and hope, while illuminating our shared path forward.\"\n\nThe Home Depot claims they've tried to address what happened: \"Diversity and respect for all people are core to who we are, and we do not tolerate discrimination in any form,\" a company spokesperson told Today.com in a statement on Aug. 11. \"We value Mr. Gibson as a customer, and in the months since this happened, we've reached out to him and his attorneys several times to try to resolve his concerns. We will continue to do so.\""
