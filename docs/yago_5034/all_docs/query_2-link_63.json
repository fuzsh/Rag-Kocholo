        "text": "Jimmy Fallon’s show has become a family affair as he works from home amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOn Tuesday's episode of “The Tonight Show,” Fallon convinced his wife, Nancy Juvonen, to step out from behind the camera for a quick interview.\n\nJuvonen, who co-founded the production company Flower Films with Drew Barrymore, has been her husband's camera operator for the last week during his at-home versions of the show.\n\nDuring a segment Fallon introduced as \"ask the Fallons,\" the parents of two took a stroll around their neighborhood while Jimmy asked his wife about her life.\n\nIn one moment, Fallon read a question from a fan who wanted to know if the host and former \"Saturday Night Live\" star was a romantic.\n\n“I think you are!” she said.\n\n“You do? How cute!” he laughed.\n\nJuvonen, who is 52, went on to describe the incredible gift he got her for her 50th birthday.\n\nFallon had gotten her a slew of her favorite albums on cassette tape, but told her he’d forgotten the boombox to play them on in the garage.\n\n“I thought that was it! And I was like, ‘That is the most thoughtful!’” Juvonen said. “'You listened to me! All we want as women is to be heard, blah blah blah.'”\n\nBut as she ran outside to grab the boombox, her brother drove up in a classic Volkswagen Bus.\n\nJuvonen said she loved the car because she had learned to drive in one growing up near San Francisco, and drove it all through high school and college.\n\nThe hippie bus has been a hit with strangers who spot the Fallons in it.\n\n“More people stop us for that thing, they don’t even care that it’s me in the car,\" Fallon said.\n\n“They’re like ‘I had one of those! I lived in that … bus, I took it all the way to California from New York,’” he added. “People have really beautiful stories about that VW Bus.”\n\n“Those who it touches, it touches deeply,” Juvonen agreed.\n\nFallon and Juvonen share two young daughters, Winnie, 6, and Franny, 5, who have been helping produce the lo-fi versions of “The Tonight Show.\"\n\nDuring their walk, the two also revealed the girls have a cute habit of sneaking into bed with them at night.\n\n“They don’t ever start out with us, but let’s just say at 5 and 6 when they do crawl in at night with us, we’re not kicking them out,” Juvonen said. “And the dog — it’s usually five of us!”"
