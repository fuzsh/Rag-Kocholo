        "text": "You’re on your own, kids.\n\nJimmy Fallon, 49, revealed that he doesn’t get his daughters Winnie, 10, and Frances, 9, tickets to Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour despite his Hollywood connections.\n\n“I didn’t get them tickets to see Taylor. I said, ‘No, you have to earn certain things. I can’t just do this for you,'” the late-night host recently told E! News.\n\n“I want them to be as normal and less bratty as they can possibly be. And they’re the nicest kids,” Fallon added about his daughters that he shares with wife Nancy Juvonen.\n\nFallon could probably snag tickets to the Eras Tour considering Swift, 34, has been a guest on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” several times.\n\nThe last time Swift was on the NBC late-night show was one month after she released her tenth album, “Midnights,” in late 2022.\n\n“We’ve got to talk about ‘Midnights,’ ” Jimmy told the pop star, before touting the album’s “unbelievable” success at the time.\n\n“I’m beside myself, really,” Swift excitedly told Fallon on his show.\n\nWhile he has no plans to hand out concert tickets to his daughters, Fallon is a loving father to his two little girls.\n\nThe former “Saturday Night Live” star gave insight into how fatherhood has changed him in 2020.\n\n“My biggest revelation is how much I ended up caring for other people’s kids if that makes any sense. You get it more,” he told Fatherly.\n\n“When I didn’t have kids, if I heard a crying baby in the restaurant, I would think, ‘Can you stop the crying and go around the block?’ Now I would be like, ‘Just give me the baby — how can I help?’ I’ve been there,” he added.\n\nFallon married the film producer in 2007.\n\nJuvonen, 56, helped produce “The Tonight Show” when Fallon hosted it from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFallon gushed over his talented wife on an episode of his show in June 2020.\n\n“You really want to pick someone who you don’t have to like every single thing the same, but you kind of have to have the same values in a way,” he said. “What makes you both laugh is fun because then you laugh together at the same stuff.”\n\nFallon will celebrate the 10th anniversary of his show with a two-hour special airing Tuesday, May 14. He previously hosted “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon” from 2009 to 2014, before taking over the “Tonight Show” from Jay Leno."
