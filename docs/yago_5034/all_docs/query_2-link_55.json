        "text": "There was a reason no one knew “Late Night” host Jimmy Fallon’s wife Nancy Juvonen was pregnant.\n\nShe wasn’t.\n\nFallon told “Today” host Savannah Gutherie in a clip that aired Friday that the couple used a surrogate to carry daughter Winnie Rose, who was born July 23 weighing 5 pounds 9 ounces.\n\n“My wife and I had been trying a while to have a baby,” Fallon, 38, told Guthrie. “We tried a bunch of things – so we had a surrogate.”\n\nHe called the experience “so emotional.”\n\n“We said, ‘We’re not going to tell anybody,’” Fallon explained. “It’d be just more fun if it’s just private between me and my wife. And then we get to introduce her to everybody.”\n\nGuthrie’s interview with Fallon will air next week on “Today.”\n\nHere are a few clips of Jimmy talking about his bundle of joy."
