        "text": "Jimmy Fallon is already thinking about ways he can get his daughter back after a recent April Fools' Day prank.\n\nWhile talking with Willie Geist for the May 12 edition of Sunday Sitdown, Fallon said his 9-year-old daughter, Frances, pranked him April 1 by throwing whipped cream in his face.\n\nThe moment started sweet.\n\n\"I get home early enough to put the kids to sleep, which is a great night, you know? So I get home. And they go, 'Daddy’s here. Daddy’s here,'\" he said. \"The world’s the best. Everything’s awesome. I love my life.\"\n\nBut he knew something was up after his daughters asked him to put on a shirt that he wouldn't mind getting \"messy.\"\n\n\"She comes across with a paper plate full of whipped cream and slaps me hard across the face,\" Fallon said. \"I mean, a real wallop and whipped cream all over my face, all over the walls. Nothing on the T-shirt, of course.\"\n\n“I go, ‘That’s terrible what you just did.’ I go, ‘I’m going to get you back,’” he recalled with a laugh. “‘I’m going to take a year of my life, and I’m going to really get you back.’”\n\nAt first, he told his daughter, \"I'm gonna put snakes in your bed or something.\"\n\n“She goes, ‘I like snakes,’” he laughed.\n\nBut later that night at bedtime, Fallon said she backed down from the challenge.\n\n“She goes, ‘I don’t really like snakes,’ and I looked at her and I go, ‘You think I care?’” he recalled. \"I shut the door.\"\n\nFallon shares his two daughters, Winnie and Frances, with his wife, Nancy Juvonen.\n\nRead on to learn more about Jimmy Fallon’s kids.\n\nWinnie, 10\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Fallon welcomed his first child, daughter Winnie Rose, with his wife, Nancy Juvonen, via a surrogate.\n\nAfter she was born, he told TODAY anchors that he was enamored with his daughter.\n\n“I can’t stop looking at her,” he said. “When I’m not holding her, I’m looking at photos of her on my phone. She’s the coolest — the best thing to ever happen to me.”\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Winnie made an appearance on the at-home edition of \"The Tonight Show\" when she interrupted her dad on camera to tell him that she lost a tooth.\n\n“I lost a tooth!\" she told Fallon and his guests on the show.\n\nFallon, surprised to discover it had just happened, responded, “Oh, my gosh. Winnie, I’m so happy.\"\n\nOther than telling her dad about exciting things that happen in her life, Winnie also adores being an older sister to Frances.\n\n“They’re totally pals,” Fallon told People of his daughter in 2018. “There’s some arguments, but it’s baby arguments. They’re automatic best friends because they’re around each other all day long.”\n\n“But Winnie’s still the oldest and now she’s kind of helping Franny,” he added. “She’s talking to her and she’s like, ‘No Franny. You don’t do that.’ It’s interesting the way they help each other out. You can tell they’re bonded forever.”\n\nFrances, 9\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2014, Fallon and Juvonen welcomed their second daughter, Frances, via a surrogate.\n\nIn 2017, the dad of two celebrated Frances' 3rd birthday when he gave her a sweet shoutout on Instagram.\n\n“Happy Birthday to our littlest noodle!” he wrote on the social media platform alongside a photo of Frances rocking a stylish hat and sweater combo.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Fallon talked about his kids and shared what it's been like to work from home when his kids are around."
