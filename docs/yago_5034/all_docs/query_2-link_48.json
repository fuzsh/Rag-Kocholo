        "text": "Fans are curious about Jimmy Fallon’s personal life, including whether he’s married and if he has kids. He’s fairly reserved about his home life, and millions of viewers have watched him for years without knowing anything about his family. In fact, we know more about his dog Gary Frick than his wife and kids. So, if you’re interested in learning about Fallon’s marriage and whether he has kids or not, read below.\n\nIs Jimmy Fallon Married?\n\nJimmy Fallon has only been married once. His first and only wife is Nancy Juvonen. She co-founded Flower Films with Drew Barrymore in 1993 and worked as a producer on the following films:\n\nNever Been Kissed\n\nCharlie’s Angels (2000)\n\nDonnie Darko\n\nCharlie’s Angels: Full Throttle\n\nDuplex\n\n50 First Dates\n\nFever Pitch\n\nHe’s Just Not That Into You\n\nHow to Be Single\n\nThe Stand-In\n\nShe was also an executive producer on these films:\n\nMusic and Lyrics\n\nWhip It!\n\nCharlie’s Angels (2011 TV series)\n\nCharlie’s Angels (2019)\n\nJuvonen and Fallon met on the set of Saturday Night Live but didn’t get to know each other until later when they were working on the set of Fever Pitch in 2005. Fallon proposed to Juvonen in August 2007, and the two were wed on December 22, 2007.\n\nDoes Jimmy Fallon have kids?\n\nJimmy Fallon has two children:\n\nWinnie Rose Fallon (Born July 23, 2013)\n\nFrances Cole Fallon (Born December 3, 2014)\n\nBoth daughters were born via surrogate as Fallon and Juvonen encountered fertility issues when trying to conceive.\n\nDespite his reserved nature about his personal life, Fallon occasionally shares endearing stories and moments about his family on his show and social media. These glimpses reveal his deep love and dedication to his wife and daughters, adding a personal touch to his public persona and connecting with fans on a more intimate level."
