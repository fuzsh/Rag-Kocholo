        "text": "We have been watching the at-home episodes of the Tonight Show for quite some time and it’s interesting to see Jimmy Fallon in action. We always knew him as being somebody that was interesting on one side of an interview, but it seems as if he is quite a family man as well.\n\nOne of the things that there is to love about the Fallon household is the fact that they own a retro Volkswagen bus. It’s been decorated beyond belief on the inside, and I’m sure that the whole neighborhood is aware of its presence. The old school van is a bright cherry red and you can find it outside of the treehouse-style Fallon household. Occasionally, they take it out for a drive.\n\nAlthough Jimmy Fallon may love the VW bus, it seems to be his wife, Nancy Juvonen, that loves it the most. Looking at the blue-green carpet that covers the floor and the windows with red and white shades put you in mind of a nice picnic. There is even a vintage cabinet that is able to store things from water bottles to tissues.\n\nJimmy and Nancy came up with their first “Ask the Fallon’s” segment and they talked about the nostalgic van and how it came to be. Apparently, Jimmy had surprised her with it on her 50th birthday. Nancy learned how to drive the VW bus and she had always had one in high school and college. Her collection of albums was put on cassette tape and then he pretended as if he forgot the boombox. When they went out into the garage, her brother pulled up in the red VW. She describes it even today is one of the many “romantic gestures” that came from her husband."
