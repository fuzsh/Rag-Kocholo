        "text": "Jimmy Fallon and his wife Nancy Juvonen have opened up about what makes their marriage successful.\n\nDuring a segment of Ask The Fallons, the couple was asked to answer: “What is your secret for keeping your marriage strong?”\n\nIn response to the question, Juvonen, who has been married to the late-night host since 2007, said: “My answer’s almost unromantic, but I don’t mean it to be unromantic.\n\n“But all of those crazy, googly notes and exciting and the bad boy and all that kind of stuff, it does not pay off in the long term, and I know you won’t trust me because I didn’t trust anyone who told me that, either.”\n\nAccording to Juvonen, you should instead look for a partner that shares the same values as you - even if it means you don’t like the same exact things.\n\n“So you really want to pick someone who you don’t have to like every single thing the same, but you kind of have to have the same values in a way,” she continued. “What makes you both laugh is fun because then you laugh together at the same stuff.”\n\nJuvonen also acknowledged the importance of not compromising when it comes to the things that “matter a lot to you” because “it’s just a struggle after awhile.”\n\nTo highlight her point, Juvonen, who shares two daughters with Fallon, used the example of mayonnaise, which her husband apparently hates.\n\n“Dating is so cute and everyone’s like: ‘I’ll do anything. Oh, my God, I love mayonnaise,’ you know,” she said, adding to her husband: “I’m sure you would’ve eaten mayonnaise for me. Look at his face. Let’s just pretend he would’ve. But now it can’t even be in the house.”\n\n“It’s just an example of when you’re dating you’ll do anything for that person, and then as you really are together and come together, you hopefully get more real,” Juvonen continued, explaining that the truth eventually comes out so it’s best to be honest about your likes in the beginning.\n\nJuvonen concluded her advice telling viewers to have a list of “things that really you can’t tolerate or must tolerate and make sure they just line up enough that they’re not opposing the other person.”\n\n“And I think keep your sense of humour. And I think keep some independence,” she added.\n\nThe clip ended with Juvonen and Fallon giggling, before Juvonen attempted to direct the question towards her husband who said: “Unfortunately we have to go to commercial.”\n\nThe couple first met on the set of Saturday Night Live, but didn’t officially begin dating until 2005 when they met again on the set of the movie Fever Pitch."
