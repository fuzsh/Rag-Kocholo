        "text": "Do Not Give Up\n\nAdvice is simple after looking back at Jimmy Fallon’s fertility journey with his wife, Nancy Juvonen. “Do not give up”! Nancy says “I think if anyone’s out there wanting the dream, do not give up,” At one time, Jimmy referred to 5 years of trying as “awful”, but now he looks at his family as proof of perseverance and love.\n\nJimmy Fallon’s Fertility Journey\n\nBeing a celebrity, Jimmy Fallon’s fertility journey had the added pressure of the world quietly watching. However, with a beautiful family today the journey was well worth it.\n\nJimmy confides, “At a certain point it had to almost become a job because it’s way too emotional to live emotionally through all that stuff. Therefore, you just keep going and going and going, and if you really want something, you just make it happen. Then, all of a sudden, you’re like, ‘Hey, I’ll do that. If it’s for my family, I’ll do anything.’”\n\nJimmy and his Family\n\nThe popular Tonight Show host and his wife are raising two daughter’s together. Winnie is 6 years old and Franny is 5. Due tp the quarantine period, Jimmy has been hosting the show from home. In turn, it has introduced his family more closely to fans. https://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show\n\nThere was a time the couple wasn’t sure when or how kids would ever be in the cards for them. Today, watching the happy family is a joy and gives others hope.\n\nCongratulations from SWFC"
