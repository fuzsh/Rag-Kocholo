Speaking to Marie Claire Australia, she said: \"I don't think that me and my partner, Nancy Fallon, went into it thinking, 'As females we're going to take this opportunity and kill it.'\n\n\"We went in as hardworking producers and we killed ourselves to earn a seat at the table, and to earn the trust of the studios.\"\n\nHow did Jimmy Fallon and Nancy Juvonen meet?\n\nJimmy and Nancy have been married for over 15 years! But did you know that the lovebirds would never have crossed paths if it wasn't for Nancy's friend, Drew?\n\nBack in 2005, Drew and Jimmy co-starred in a baseball-themed romantic comedy called Fever Pitch.

He said: \"Hands down, one of the best days and nights of my entire life.\"\n\nNancy, meanwhile, added: \"So we had 12 people at our wedding. I just got a dress done as fast as I could.

Both Fallon babies were born via surrogate\".\n\nMORE: Jimmy Fallon stirs the pot with hilarious on-air arguement\n\nJimmy and Nancy struggled with infertility for five years. The TV host has been incredibly open about the couple's parenthood journey. Opening up to Savannah Guthrie on the Today show, Jimmy said: \"My wife and I had been trying [for] a while to have a baby. We tried a bunch of things—so we had a surrogate\".\n\nWhilst Jimmy tends to keep his daughters off social media, Winnie and Frances made a starring appearance on TV when Jimmy hosted his show from home during the pandemic. Fans were delighted to see the sibling duo steal the limelight with their charming homemade signs. How sweet!\n\nWhere do they live?\n\nJimmy, Nancy and their children Frances and Winnie split their time between two stunning homes. They own a sleek downtown Manhattan apartment in addition to a luxurious mansion hidden in the Hamptons.\n\nTheir Hamptons home boasts a farmhouse, two cottages, two barns and an apple orchard.
