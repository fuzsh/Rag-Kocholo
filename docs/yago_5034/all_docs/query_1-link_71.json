        "text": "Tonight Show host and former SNL funny man Jimmy Fallon and his wife Nancy Juvonen struggled for more than 5 years to start their family. Now, they want to tell other couples “Don’t Give Up.”\n\nThe couple recently gave a candid interview during their “Ask the Fallons” segment about their “difficult but ultimately rewarding” journey to have their two daughters. Winnie, 6, and Franny, 5, have become regular fixtures on the “The Tonight Show: At Home Edition”\n\nNancy, 52, and Jimmy, 45, have been married for more than 12 years, but for many years they were unsure if they would be able to have children. As Nancy puts it, it took, “five years of really, really, really, really, really deciding not to give up.”\n\nTrying to conceive became a job\n\n“At a certain point it had to almost become a job because it’s way too emotional to live emotionally through that. So you just keep going and going and going, and if you really want something, you just make it happen. And you have all of these things where you go, ‘Yeah, but I would never do that. Yes, but I would never to that, but I would never …’ Then, all the sudden, you’re like, ‘Hey, I’ll do that. If it’s for my family, I’ll do anything.’”\n\nJimmy has been open in the past about what he calls the ‘awful’ process of dealing with infertility. When the couple was asked if they needed a special kind of perseverance to withstand this fight, Nancy responded that countless couples do indeed have this determination.\n\n“I think if anyone’s out there having the dream, do not give up. Because I realized, too, that unlike even becoming a multibillionaire, you can stumble upon a lottery ticket and win it and win the lottery — but you will not ever stumble upon a child that you can love and have as your family. So, don’t give up!”\n\nThey revealed that it required a lot of strange experiences to withstand the fertility process. “Gosh, that was just crazy.” Jimmy reminisced. “That was nuts. At one point, it was just shots and things and drinking weird teas, remember that one?”\n\nHowever, now that Winnie and Franny are in this world, they are happier than ever that they made the choice to go ahead with their treatments. Jimmy exclaimed, “Gosh, it was the best move we ever made.” Nancy agreed. “Couldn’t be happier and more lucky and more in love with them and each other.”\n\nDoes Jimmy and Nancy’s story give you hope and encouragement during your own fertility journey?
