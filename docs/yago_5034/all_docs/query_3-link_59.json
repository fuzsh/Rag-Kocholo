        "text": "Jimmy Fallon is getting into the (summer) holiday spirit two days early. On July 2, the late-night TV host shared a rare family photo featuring his wife, Nancy Juvonen, and their daughters, Winnie and Frances. In the photo, the family of four is all smiles as they stand on a dock, but Fallon makes it clear in his caption that he had conditions in place before taking the photo.\n\n\"I agreed to take this photo only if I could stand on the dry side of the dock,\" Fallon wrote. \"Happy 2nd of July!\" While his request may seem strange, the dock is absolutely drenched, and in his defense, he is wearing pristine white sneakers. Meanwhile, his wife is wearing wedge sandals, and the girls are rocking the ultimate summer footwear: bare feet.\n\nFallon's family vacation snap quickly garnered lots of love from his famous friends. Chance the Rapper commented, \"Beautiful,\" alongside an emotional emoji, while Chelsea Handler added, \"I love this photo.\" However, Justin Long had the best comment of them all. \"Nan!!! Winnepesaukee! I'm thinking about driving up there and yelling your name in the town square until you respond 'What About Bob'-style,\" he wrote."
