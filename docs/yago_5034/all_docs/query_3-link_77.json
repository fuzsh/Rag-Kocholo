        "text": "Planning a wedding is hard, but when you only have three weeks to do it, it's even more challenging. Such was the case for Jimmy Fallon and wife Nancy Juvonen's Dec. 22, 2007 nuptials.\n\nOn Tuesday episode of \"The Tonight Show: Home Edition,\" the couple answered a fan question about what their wedding was like.\n\nAt the time, Juvonen said she was producing \"He's Just Not That Into You\" and Fallon was working on a different project all while they were trying to plan their wedding for the summertime.\n\n\"We kept trying to talk to these wedding people, and they wanted to talk about napkins and all these things we just could not have cared about less, really, on any level,\" Juvonen said.\n\nThen, when they were home for Thanksgiving after the movie had wrapped, Fallon chatted with his travel agent about his dream wedding destination.\n\n\"I go, 'The dream is easily Richard Branson's Necker Island,'\" Fallon explained, referring to the billionaire's private island. \"He goes perfect, that's good to know. You have to rent it out for at least two weeks. So he said, 'Yeah, that's out of the question.' And I go, I gotcha, no big deal. Life goes on, we'll find a place.\"\n\nBut then Fallon got an exciting call back from his agent saying Branson would be out of the house for the first time ever around Christmas to be with his daughter who was giving birth to his first grandchild.\n\n\"(My agent) goes, Richard is a fan, he likes you, so he'll rent you the island for (three) days,\" Fallon continued.\n\nCoping with COVID-19: Are you breathing correctly? Plus, more weekend tips and hacks\n\n\"So Jimmy goes, 'What if we got married in three weeks? Instead of next summer?'\" Juvonen chimed in. \"And I'm like 'This is the best of all human time!'\"\n\nShe continued, \"So, we had 12 people at our wedding. I got a dress done as fast as I could, we didn't care... some people are still mad, but no aunts came.\"\n\nDespite the short timeframe to plan, the couple said it was so much fun.\n\n\"Man, we had a rager time,\" Fallon said.\n\nAnd what they lacked in wedding guests they made up for in island animals.\n\n\"All the flamingos, and the giant turtles,\" they recalled at the same time, laughing.\n\n\"We just had the best time,\" Fallon said.\n\nFallon and Juvonen share two daughters: Winnie, 6, and Frances, 5.\n\nLove is in the air!
