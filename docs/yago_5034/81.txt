Jimmy Fallon has been married to his wife, Nancy Juvonen, for nearly two decades and the pair have kept most details about their relationship out of their high-profile lives.

The couple was introduced by their mutual bestie Drew Barrymore in 2004, but they didn’t start dating until one year later when they worked on the film Fever Pitch. While Jimmy and Drew played onscreen lovers, Nancy produced the baseball romcom – as her love story with the talk show host just began.

The Tonight Show host and Nancy tied the knot on December 22, 2007, and started a beautiful family. However, sources told In Touch in October 2023 that their marriage was in “crisis” amid the writers’ strike, as they were “fighting a lot, arguing over money, living arrangements and his drinking.”
