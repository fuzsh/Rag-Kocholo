About The Landmark

Fraunces Tavern is known as the place where George Washington gave his famous farewell address to his officers in 1783, but the building traces its history to 1719 when it was built as a home for Stephen DeLancey. Over the years it has had several changes due to fires and alterations. The building was converted into a tavern by Samuel Fraunces in 1763 and eventually into a museum by the Sons of the Revolution in 1907.

The Museum features a restaurant and an extensive collection of Colonial America, Revolutionary War, and Early Republic artifacts, including a lock of George Washington’s hair and the world’s largest collection of John Ward Dunsmore paintings.

Fraunces Tavern was one of New York’s earliest preservation projects and one of the first New York City landmarks designated in 1965. The Landmarks Conservancy helped to save the Fraunces Tavern block as a historic district in 1978.
