        "text": "Built in the early 18th century in what is now the Financial District, the Fraunces Tavern Museum—a bustling bar during the Revolutionary War—is said to occupy the oldest existing building in Manhattan. It was there where George Washington gave a moving farewell address to his officers, and peace talks with the British took place after the war. Nowadays, visitors can browse thousands of letters, artworks, furnishings, and more from that era in history.\n\nThe museum offers permanent and temporary exhibits, and hosts a range of events, from guided tours and evening lectures to annual Flag Day celebrations and reenactments of Washington’s address. To save time at the entry, book your admission ticket online in advance.\n\nMost visitors spend one to two hours at the Fraunces Tavern Museum.\n\nThe museum is accessible to wheelchairs and strollers.\n\nLocated on Pearl Street in the Financial District, the Fraunces Tavern Museum is easy to reach by subway. Take the 1 train to South Ferry, the 4 or 5 train to Bowling Green, or the N, R, or W train to Whitehall Street. Multiple bus lines and ferries (including the Staten Island Ferry) also serve the area.\n\nThe museum is open every day except Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, and New Year’s Day. Hours are Monday through Friday from 12pm to 5pm, and Saturday and Sunday from 11am to 5pm. The attached Fraunces Tavern restaurant and bar is open daily from 11:30am to 2:30am.\n\nPart of the same complex as the museum, the Fraunces Tavern is an atmospheric restaurant that’s been in operation since 1762. Featuring numerous dining rooms complete with heritage architecture and fixtures, the tavern is celebrated for its whiskey selection and its beers made by the Porterhouse Brewing Company."
