        "text": "When you think of historic house museums in New York City, what pops to mind? Click To Tweet\n\nThe opulent mansions of Westchester and the Hudson Valley filled with refurbished period art, architecture, expansive grounds, and resident spectres, right? Well … you’re not wrong, because that is my mental image as well.\n\nAlas, even though New York City does not boast of these grand old homes, she does have historic houses that pack a punch in colonial, Revolutionary, and Civil War history, and yes, the occasional haunting as well. I mean, you don’t expect houses as old as four centuries to be free of spirits now, do you? These houses have since been turned into museums, some under the care of NYC Parks, and some on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nLet’s delve into some historic museums in New York City, some of which I’ve experienced, and some I hope to do soon.\n\nMerchant’s House Museum: Historic House Museums in New York City\n\nOne solid piece of architectural history left in NYC as a throwback to a bygone era is Merchant’s House, built in 1831 and bought in 1835 by Seabury Tredwell, a wealthy merchant from Long Island. Seabury and his family lived and died here until his last child, Gertrude, died in the house at the age of 93 in 1933. Gertrude is said to still be wandering Merchant’s House… 👻\n\nMerchant’s House is unique in that it still houses the 19th century art, furnishings, and possessions of the Tredwell family and those furnishings that have decayed over the decades have been refurbished to their original state. The parlour has Rococo Revival furniture, a pianoforte, gilt marble mirror, a detailed ceiling, and massive chandeliers, all of which were very opulent by NYC standards of the day. All these furnishings were indicative of family wealth in the era, and the Tredwell’s were rolling in it by all accounts.\n\nDo you know that Merchant's House also had an elevator installed? It's been removed but the shaft is still on display. Click To Tweet\n\nThis piece of NYC architectural history in NoHo is full of NYC stories and interesting family life of the 19th century era. For example, do you know that Victorian men did the food shopping? Yes. Men. Bucking gender roles in the 1800s. Furthermore, experience a wee bit of Victorian fashion by trying on a massive hoop skirt for giggles. I do so and wonder how women managed to sit in those things let alone pee!\n\nMerchant’s House also mentions the female Irish immigrants, some as young as 14, that emigrated to the U.S. to be domestic servants in grand homes. There were so many of them in domestic service that it was seen as a stigma and as such, American women refused to do domestic work and saw it as beneath them. Ring a bell?\n\nTake a socially distanced self-guided tour through Merchant’s House or stay cooped up with historic virtual tours from food of the day to life of an Irish servant girl.\n\n29 E 4th St., New York, NY\n\nSat-Sun 12p-5p\n\nAdmission: $15\n\nLefferts Historic Home: Historic House Museums in New York City\n\nThis simple homestead bungalow is in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, and is the home of the Lefferts family of the Netherlands. They were Dutch settlers that arrived in the 1630s to New Amsterdam – New York City’s first name – originally a Dutch colony before the Brits took over. The house was built in the 1780s and is currently owned by the NYC Parks Department.\n\nThe original homestead was on Flatbush & Maple St. and it was moved to its present location in 1918 for the City to preserve it historically. Click To Tweet\n\nLefferts Home is an 18th century living museum exhibiting colonial Dutch life with a working garden, chopped wood, and historic remnants of colonial life. Tours are available – pandemic has scuttered that now – to show family life and the lives of the enslaved Africans that catered to their every desire and lived on the property with them.\n\nThe Lefferts family is one of the most popular Kings County (families) and descendants married into prominent colonial Dutch families of the day like Vanderbilts and Bergen, names of which are popular in NYC and on its landmarks. There are many remnants of colonial Dutch history in Brooklyn and Lefferts Home is one of the few remaining historic house museums in New York City in which to experience this.\n\nLefferts Historic Home is currently closed for restoration.\n\n452 Flatbush Ave., Brooklyn\n\nFraunces Tavern Museum: Historic Houses in New York City\n\nEver been to a tavern that doubles as a historic house museum? No? Then, hello Fraunces Tavern in downtown New York City!\n\nKnock back a few as you learn about the history of 54 Pearl Street from its initial grant to Stephanus Van Cortlandt in 1686, its journey through the Revolutionary War – change of ownership, business designation, serving War generals – to its designation as a Historic District in 1977.\n\nLittle is known about the original tavern owner, Samuel Fraunces, and his portrait at the tavern is being disputed by a German historian who believes that the gentleman in the portrait was one of the intimate friends of Frederick the Great. Verily, the plot thickens!\n\nFraunces Tavern is famous for George Washington dining in and ordering take-out – like a regular human – after the British were routed out of New York City, the last U.S. city there were still in. In fact, November 23, 1783, is Evacuation Day in New York City where the Continental Army marched from the Bowery to Wall St.\n\nIn its heyday, the tavern has been a boarding house, grocery, events place, dance hall, leased to the government’s War Office and Foreign Affairs Office… and of course, a political meeting place where Burr and Hamilton attended a Society of Cincinnati meeting before their duel.\n\nIn 2017, Fraunces Tavern celebrated 110 years as a historic house museum and in 2019, it celebrated its 300th birthday! Click To Tweet\n\n*With NYC opening indoor dining at 25% occupancy, Fraunces Tavern is open for dining.\n\n54 Pearl Street, New York, NY\n\nHistoric Hunterfly Road Houses (Weeksville): Historic Houses in New York City\n\nWeeksville is an independent, free, Black community in present-day Bed Stuy and Crown Heights, named for James Weeks. Click To Tweet\n\nIn 1838, James purchased a part of the Lefferts estate to create a landowning community, in conjunction with other African-American investors of the day. It is a historic site and cultural centre dedicated to preserving and documenting the history of Weeksville in pre-Civil War U.S.\n\nThe historic Hunterfly houses are on an old Native American trail with houses from the 1860s through 1930s still standing. They are single to two-story, wood-framed houses with backyard fences, containing historic artifacts reflective of the period the families lived in them, and are one of the well preserved African-American historic house museums in New York City.\n\nWeeksville holds exhibits on diaspora art and oral histories of the former inhabitants of the community and is a wonderful experience for anyone wanting to learn about African-American communities in NYC of that era. Not much is known or told about these Black communities in NYC so Weeksville/Hunterfly Houses are the ideal historic homes to learn of them.\n\n*In-house events and exhibits are on pause due to the pandemic but walk-in tours still available.\n\n158 Buffalo Ave., Brooklyn\n\nWalk in tours: Tues-Thurs 3p; Sat- 12p, 2p & 3.30p\n\nSmallpox Hospital: Historic Houses in New York City\n\nThis is more a historic ruin than a historic house museum, but it was once a complete property until the 1900s.\n\nThe Smallpox Hospital – located on the narrow strip of land that is Roosevelt Island – was once the primary healthcare facility in the 1800s to receive and quarantine smallpox patients in New York City.\n\nFast forward two centuries later and quarantining is still happening in NYC, not for smallpox, and not at this hospital... Click To Tweet\n\nAnyway, once a viable smallpox vaccine was created in late 1800s and inoculations began, affliction rates rapidly dropped, and the number of patients dwindled at the hospital, thus forcing its inevitable closure. The empty structure was pilfered and roof collapse came next thus leaving only the walls standing for nature to take over… which she has done very well.\n\nAs with all ruins, there are alleged hauntings of Smallpox Hospital. Click To Tweet\n\nPresently, it is overgrown with ivy and is a home to nestling birds, ducks, and other species, with a new park is under construction around it. Smallpox Hospital is one of the highly recommended free things to do on Roosevelt Island on a cheap day trip from NYC.\n\nMorris-Jumel Mansion: Historic Houses in New York City\n\nThe mansion is completed in 1765 as a Harlem summer home for British Colonel, Roger Morris and his wife, Mary Philipse – of the family for which Philipse Manor in Westchester is named for. I would’ve chosen anywhere with sun and sea as a summer retreat, but given the situation of the day – Revolutionary War – the mansion was built atop the highest point in Manhattan with surrounding views of the NY harbour, Jersey and Connecticut. It was also a working farm so you can be sure there were enslaved people here.\n\n1776 rolls in and the Morris’ abandon the mansion, which Washington and his army quickly occupy for its vantage point and space. It changes hands several times until 1810 when Eliza and Stephen Jumel purchase the property and its farmlands. Eliza is much smarter than her husband and it is she who manages their real estate holdings even after her husband’s death. She passes in 1865 and the property is contested for over a decade!\n\nThe mansion goes through the Harlem Renaissance as the area draws in Black artists and writers of high calibre – Duke Ellington, Paul Robeson, and their peers. Paul Robeson even mentions Morris-Jumel as where an enslaved ancestor of his – he later buys his freedom – offers his baking services to feed Washington and his troops.\n\nWander remotely through a virtual house tour of the mansion’s grand rooms and its furnishings and listen to the history behind them.\n\nToday, the mansion is one of the oldest historic houses in New York City and is said to be so haunted that it is featured on paranormal investigative series. Click To Tweet\n\nThurs – Sun 11a – 5p\n\nSelf-guided tour $10\n\n65 Jumel Terrace, New York\n\nOld Stone House: Historic Houses in New York City\n\nOld Stone House is one of the oldest farmhouses in New York City erected in 1699 by Dutchman, Hendrick Vechte. The property changed ownership from the Vechtes to the Cortelyous and then to Edwin Litchfield, the latter two names Brooklynites recognize. In fact, Litchfield Villa in Prospect Park is the site of spectre sightings since 1864 till present, where gargoyles and spirits are said to roam from a seance that released them into this world. Interesting…\n\nOld Stone House is the site of one of the bloodiest battles of the Revolutionary War – the Battle of Brooklyn – where the “Maryland 400” were slaughtered by the British. 400 Maryland soldiers were sent against 2,000 British troops and even though they fought valiantly, it was a losing battle as many Maryland soldiers perished.\n\nAfter this battle, a Maryland Major commented that, “the killed, wounded, and missing amount to two hundred and fifty-nine.” Until this day, it is unknown where these bodies are, buuuttt…\n\n… it is presumed that they were buried across the street in the area that is now Staples on 348 4th Ave. In fact, this area is known to be one of the spookiest spots in Brooklyn.\n\n336 3rd Street, Brooklyn\n\nFri 3p – 6p\n\nSat – Sun 11a – 4p\n\nHistoric Richmond Town: Historic Houses in New York City\n\nThis is one of my favourite historic house museums in New York City for its living museum qualities and historical re-enactments.\n\nHistoric Richmond Town on Staten Island is a community of buildings once inhabited by colonial Dutch families and their English in-laws from the 1700s to 1890s. In the 1930s, an opportunity was seen for historic preservation of the area by the Staten Island Historical Society after the community had been abandoned in the late 1890s.\n\nThere are a number of areas that make up the larger Richmond Town community, such as:\n\nMain Village\n\nDecker Farm\n\nBilliou-Stillwell-Perrine House\n\nOver the decades, the community of historic houses and their untold histories have been brought to life by re-enactments from expert historians and craftspeople who have spent decades learning historic trades of carpentry, hearth-cooking, tin smithing, forgery, just like colonial craftspeople of the community.\n\nOther interesting historical sights to see at Richmond Town are:\n\nA brightly coloured printing shop in Main Village with 1800s era circulars seen in windows;\n\n18th century menus visible in windows of what seems to be a community kitchen,\n\nA homestead generational graveyard of the Rezeau-Van Pelt Family\n\nHistorical Museum – once the County Clerk’s and Surrogate’s Office\n\nThis is definitely one of the more underrated historic house museums in New York City and is part of beautiful and safe places to travel in New York State this pandemic period.\n\nHistoric Richmond Town is open and offers capped weekend guided tours as well as online and limited in-person workshops & exhibits.\n\n441 Clarke Ave., Staten Island, NY\n\n*********************************************************\n\nWhen next you’re in NYC, don’t forget to pop by one of these historic house museums for a taste of history.\n\nRemember that pandemic protocols apply so verify opening days and times before hand.\n\nShare in comments which ones you’ve experienced and which stories you find interesting.
