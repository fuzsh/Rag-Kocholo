        "text": "As a tour guide, I show guests around Lower Manhattan and it is one of my favorite parts of NYC to share with others.\n\nIt's where New York City was born. It's home to one of the city's oldest structures, one of the world's tallest buildings and what I think is the most beautiful bridge in the world.\n\nIn this post, I cover more than 40 great attractions and activities to do in Lower Manhattan, many of which are free or low-cost.\n\nAlso included are things to do at night and places to eat. Lastly, I'll let you know which activities in this post are good for families!\n\nTop Things To Do\n\nWhere To Eat\n\nWhere To Stay in NYC\n\nThe Best Things To Do In NYC\n\nBEST THINGS TO DO IN LOWER MANHATTAN\n\nBefore I dive in, let me tell you what areas are included in this post.\n\nLower Manhattan (also called Downtown) is the area south of 14th Street between the East River on the east and the Hudson River on the west.\n\nThe area is divided into several neighborhoods as you can see on this map.\n\nI can't possibly cover everything there is to do in each of these neighborhoods.\n\nFor that, you'll have to look at our neighborhood-specific posts. You'll find links to those in our NYC Neighborhoods post and also throughout this post.\n\nAs I said at the start of this post, many of the things to do and see are free or low-cost. I am all about saving money!\n\nIf you are as well, take a look at our posts, Free Things to Do in NYC and NYC on a Budget.\n\nHowever, some of the best things to do aren't free but totally worth the cost, like going to the top of One World Observatory.\n\nYou might want to look into purchasing one of NYC's tourist attraction passes which include free entry to many sights and activities in NYC.\n\nI'll let you know which of the things to do in this post are included in some of these passes.\n\n1. Take in the Sweeping Views from One World Observatory\n\nOne World Observatory (sometimes called the Freedom Tower) is currently the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nI've been up here twice, once on a crystal clear day and once in the early evening when a lightning storm hit.\n\nTicket costs are steep but I didn't regret paying as the views are breathtaking.\n\nYou have a 360-degree panoramic view of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and New Jersey and on a clear day, you can see about 50 miles in any direction!\n\nRead more about going to One World Observatory, what to expect, and ways to get reduced-price tickets.\n\nThis is both family-friendly and great at night as well.\n\n2. Discover Lower Manhattan on a WalkingTour\n\nLower Manhattan is quite a large area. You can explore it on your own, though I recommend you decide in advance what you want to see or you may end up spending your entire day there.\n\nIf you want to narrow down what you see to the highlights consider joining our two-hour Lower Manhattan walking tour.\n\nAll of our local guides are knowledgeable, entertaining and friendly, like our guide Renee below in this video!\n\nWe also have longer guided walking tours that include Lower Manhattan and other neighborhoods.\n\nSearching Availability...\n\nTo explore at your own pace we have a GPS-enabled audio tour and a downloadable self-guided tour of Lower Manhattan.\n\nTip: If you are like me and are an American History buff, check out these tours run by another reputable tour company: an Alexander Hamilton tour and a Revolutionary Era tour.\n\n3. Ride the Free Staten Island Ferry Day or Night\n\nThis is perhaps the very best free thing to do in NYC!\n\nI always take visiting friends on the ferry and I love to watch their jaws drop when they see the spectacular views of Lower Manhattan.\n\nThe ferry passes the Statue of Liberty so if you aren't planning on visiting Lady Liberty, you can still get great photographs.\n\nRead our post on taking the Staten Island Ferry to find out the best times to ride to avoid crowds.\n\nThis is a very family-friendly thing to do in Lower Manhattan!\n\n4. Visit the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island\n\nAs the granddaughter of immigrants, I have a personal relationship with these two sights, that may be your ‘must-see’ list.\n\nPerhaps you are a descendant of immigrants wanting to hunt down family roots at Ellis Island.\n\nOr maybe you are a visitor from another country who has seen Lady Liberty in countless movies.\n\nEither way, if you want to visit, our detailed post on the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island goes over ticket options and advice on the best times to go so you can plan a perfect visit!\n\n5. Walk Across the Brooklyn Bridge\n\nIf you have just one day in New York City, take the time to walk over this magnificent bridge that connects Brooklyn with Lower Manhattan.\n\nI never get bored of walking over this bridge and have crossed it countless times.\n\nI suggest you start on the Brooklyn side of the bridge and walk into Manhattan as the approach offers fantastic views of the Manhattan skyline.\n\nAnother option is to end your day in Lower Manhattan with a walk over the bridge into historic and gorgeous Brooklyn Heights or the interesting neighborhood with the silly name, DUMBO.\n\nWe have both day and night guided walking tours of the Brooklyn Bridge as well as a GPS-enabled audio tour that you can use any time.\n\nIf you are traveling with young children, the walk can be a bit long for some. It takes about 25 minutes from end to end.\n\n6. Explore Chinatown, Little Italy and SoHo\n\nThese three amazing enclaves within Lower Manhattan are close together yet so different!\n\nI love Chinatown's narrow curvy streets and colorful signs in Chinese.\n\nI feel like I am in another time in another place when I am there. Plus, I love the delicious cheap food you can get there!\n\nThough Little Italy is getting smaller every year, its main street, Mulberry Street has lots to offer in the way of both history and culinary delights.\n\nGet cannoli from Ferrara, which opened in 1892!\n\nSoHo has a great mix for all interests, from gorgeous cast-iron buildings to contemporary art galleries, from designer boutiques to chain stores galore.\n\nOn our free SoHo, Little Italy, and Chinatown Tour, you'll see the highlights of these three neighborhoods, learn about their history and current culture and get recommendations on where to eat!\n\n7. The High Line\n\nWalking the High Line, a fantastic public park built on an abandoned elevated train track is one of the most interesting things you can do in New York City.\n\nAs a lifelong New Yorker, I remember when the railroad tracks were fenced off and filled with overgrown weeds. It was an eyesore and a waste of space.\n\nIn 2006, a non-profit organization turned the tracks into a public greenspace and the High Line was born.\n\nThe park runs parallel to the Hudson River, so it is more of a walkway than a park.\n\nBut the High Line has more than 150 species of plants. There's no denying it's a park!\n\nWhat makes the High Line so special is the juxtaposition between the greenery and the cutting-edge design of the nearby buildings.\n\nPlus the views all around are great! Learn all about the High Line.\n\nTip: The High Line’s southern entrance is next to the Whitney Museum of American Art. Entry is free on Fridays from 7 pm to 10 pm.\n\nWhy not combine your High Line walk with some free art? Read about the Whitney and other museums with free hours.\n\n8. Visit the 9/11 Memorial and Museum\n\nThe 9/11 Memorial is both a remembrance of those who perished that day but also a symbol of perseverance.\n\nThe glorious cascading fountains, built into the Twin Towers 'footprints' are a one-of-a-kind architectural wonder.\n\nI lived through the events of 9/11, albeit from the safety of my distant rooftop and I find the memorial to be a peaceful and introspective place.\n\nIt's accessible 24 hours a day which is something I really like.\n\nWhen I have friends in town for the first time, I like to bring them to the memorial in the evening when the fountains are lit up and the whole area is quiet.\n\nUse our guide to the 9/11 Memorial which has directions there, the best times to visit, and what sights are nearby.\n\nOne such nearby site is the National September 11 Museum A visit can help put the events of 9/11 in perspective.\n\nThe memorial is fine for children, but you should seriously consider whether or not to bring your kids to the museum. Younger children in particular may find it disturbing.\n\n9. Discover Wall Street's History\n\nTo some people, Wall Street is synonymous with money. To me, it's about American History, which is one of my favorite topics.\n\nYou probably have heard of the New York Stock Exchange, with an attractive facade. But unless you have an invitation, you can't go inside.\n\nBut you can go inside Federal Hall, just across the street. It's free to enter and has some cool exhibits inside.\n\nThe current structure on the site where George Washington was inaugurated and where the Bill of Rights was passed.\n\nI find this very inspiring and when I am in the area I always think about the birth of America and the freedoms Americans enjoy.\n\nAnd yes, there really was a wall here!\n\nRead more about the wall, these historic buildings and other things to see here from our self-guided tour of Wall Street.\n\nIf you want to learn about Wall Street's connection to money and history, you might also enjoy a Wall Street history and finance tour.\n\nTip: There are restrooms inside Federal Hall!\n\n10. See the City Lights on a Night Cruise\n\nFor gorgeous views of the city in a relaxing environment, consider a night cruise.\n\nThere are many choices, including dinner and jazz cruises, sailboat sunset rides, and cruises around the Statue of Liberty.\n\nSee if one of these tours interests you by reading our post on NYC night cruises.\n\n11. Save Money on Lower Manhattan Attractions with a Tourist Pass\n\nAs this post shows, there are both free things to do in Lower Manhattan as well as attractions that charge an entrance fee.\n\nWhen you buy a NYC tourist attraction pass, you get free entry into many of the city's most popular attractions and activities, many of which are included in this list.\n\nHere are the most popular Lower Manhattan attractions and activities included in many of the tourist passes you can buy.\n\nStatue of Liberty & Ellis Island\n\nOne World Observatory* exclusively offered by the Sightseeing Pass\n\n9/11 Museum\n\nHop-on, Hop-Off Bus tours\n\nSeveral boat rides and cruises\n\n9/11 Tribute Museum\n\nSouth Street Seaport Museum\n\nThe Skyscraper Museum\n\nMuseum of American Finance\n\nMuseum of Jewish Heritage\n\nFraunces Tavern Museum\n\nBike Tours and Rentals\n\nWalking Tours of Wall Street, the Underground Railroad, and more\n\nLiberty Helicopters\n\nAnd more!\n\nThere are many different passes so if you are thinking of getting one, our post comparing the NYC tourist passes can help you decide which one, if any, is best for you.\n\n12. Nosh Your Way Through the Lower East Side\n\nHistory, hipsters and delicious food are what the Lower East Side is all about!\n\nIt’s one of my favorite neighborhoods to wander around with friends because it's lively and filled with lots of places to grab food, like the famous Katz's Delicatessen.\n\nThere are plenty of other places to grab snacks. Plus there's so much history about the Lower East Side.\n\nYou might want to look into joining us for our free Lower East Side Food and History Tour!\n\n13. Hang Out in the East Village\n\nThe neighborhood that never sleeps! This was where I spent my college years and boy, was it fun!\n\nThere’s a great music club and bar scene at night. By day, there’s vintage shopping and people-watching.\n\nOur post, Top Things to See and Do in the East Village, tells you where to find the good stuff.\n\nPlus, it's one of the best places in NYC to see street art.\n\nOf course, like all my favorite neighborhoods, there’s cheap, scrumptious food, especially lots of ethnic foods.\n\nLet our guides take you to the best of the cheap (and delicious) foods on our pay-what-you-wish East Village Food Tour.\n\n14. Chill Out in Greenwich Village\n\nAnother awesome NYC neighborhood jam-packed with things to do day and night.\n\nIt's filled with cafes, great nightlife and some of the best and cheapest foods in NYC.\n\nI've been eating my way through Greenwich Village for decades!\n\nThen there's Washington Square Park, the ultimate place to go for people-watching.\n\nFind out all the fun things you can do in the area from our post, The Best Things to Do in Greenwich Village.\n\nIf you want to be led straight to the delicious, cheap food, join us for our pay-what-you-wish Greenwich Village Food Tour.\n\n15. Enjoy Stand-up Comedy in Greenwich Village\n\nYet another thing that makes Greenwich Village a fun place to hang out is the variety of things to do at night.\n\nIt's one of the city's hubs for stand-up comedy. There are a bunch of good clubs, including the Greenwich Village Comedy Club.\n\nAlthough they don't always attract the biggest comics, you never know what could happen!\n\nKeep an eye on the Greenwich House Theater schedule as well, because they usually host at least a few notable comedians or other performers each month.\n\nFor more after-dark fun, see our post, Things to Do at Night in NYC.\n\n16. Hear Live Music\n\nSince I am already talking about nightlife, here's another suggestion -- see some live music!\n\nNYC is bursting at its seams with music venues and so many of them are in Lower Manhattan, especially on the Lower East Side, Greenwich Village and the East Village.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing a concert, check to see who is playing at the following locations:\n\nCafe Wha?\n\nBlue Note Jazz Club\n\nWebster Hall\n\nBowery Ballroom\n\nMercury Lounge\n\nIf you want to see the biggest bands, Madison Square Garden is where they play.\n\n17. Take a Night Tour\n\nAnother nighttime option is to take a tour. From April through October, we offer our 9/11 Memorial and Brooklyn Bridge Night Tour.\n\nWe have a number of self-guided tours and our GPS audio tours of Lower Manhattan and you can take them at night if you wish.\n\nNight Bus tours are especially popular and many include Lower Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge. They are also family-friendly.\n\n18. Get Out on The Water\n\nWhile the free Staten Island Ferry ride gets you out on the water, it's not as thrilling as sailing in New York Harbor or taking a speed boat near the Statue of Liberty!\n\nWith Manhattan by Sail, you can hop on the Clipper City and sail through NYC Harbor, passing near the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Governors Island, and the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nThen there’s the Beast, a speedboat that travels 45 mph (73 kph) and gets within 100 feet of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nFor a slower pace, sit back and enjoy the popular Circle Line.\n\nTaking a boat ride or cruise will be a big hit with the whole family!\n\nRead more about these options from our post, Boat Tours and Cruises in NYC.\n\n19. Stroll Around South Street Seaport\n\nThe South Street Seaport consists of two blocks of cobblestone streets and restored 19th-century two-story buildings located next to the East River.\n\nYou can shop, eat and enjoy the incredible views of the East River, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the Brooklyn Promenade from the Esplanade at Pier 15.\n\nThere is also a small maritime museum that is perfect for kids!\n\n20. Relax along the Hudson River in Battery Park City\n\nBattery Park City is located on the west side of the tip of Manhattan along the Hudson River.\n\nIt's a residential neighborhood lined by parks and playgrounds making it a nice place to relax.\n\nKids will love the area too.\n\nTip: There is a $4 ferry that goes from Battery Park City to Staten Island which goes past the Statue of Liberty. You can take this ferry there and then the free Staten Island Ferry back!\n\n21. Marvel At The Oculus\n\nThe space-age-inspired Oculus is a stunning architectural structure. This is a must-see for photography buffs!\n\nIt's also a great place to do some shopping or grab a bite to eat. Read more about The Oculus.\n\nIt is also a transportation hub that connects the New Jersey PATH trains to the NYC Subway.\n\nFor help with navigating the subway, check out our post on using the NYC subway.\n\n22. Admire Trinity Church's Beauty Inside and Out\n\nThis Anglican parish was first established on this site in 1697 under charter by King William III.\n\nSince that year, three different structures have stood here housing Trinity Church.\n\nThe current church, a National Historic Landmark, houses some of America's oldest and most beautiful stained glass.\n\nYou can also see free musical performances here. Read more about this church's history from our post on Trinity Church.\n\n23. Get Some Good Luck From The Charging Bull\n\nThis is one of the most photographed sights in NYC - and one of the most touched!\n\nMost people pose with the bull's front side, but there is a myth that touching the bull's most private parts at his rear end brings financial good fortunes!\n\nHe appeared mysteriously on December 15, 1989, in front of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nRead more about the Wall Street Bull's fascinating history.\n\nOn March 8, 2017, the Charging Bull was joined by a smaller, but just as fierce bronze statue, \"Fearless Girl\".\n\nShe was dropped in front of the overly-masculine bull to raise awareness about the importance of gender diversity in corporate leadership.\n\nShe has since been moved to a spot across from the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n24. Frolic at Governors Island\n\nGovernors Island is a small recreational vehicle-free island just 7 minutes by ferry from Lower Manhattan.\n\nIt's open year-round, though I prefer coming here in the warmer months.\n\nYou can ride rental bikes, and kayak for free, have a picnic and visit the various playgrounds.\n\nThen there is this view!\n\nThis is an especially family-friendly activity.\n\nFor all the details on visiting, read our post on Governors Island.\n\n25. Go Ice Skating in the Winter\n\nSeasonally, there are two ice skating rinks in Lower Manhattan: one at the South Street Seaport and the other at Brookfield Place.\n\nNaturally, this is a great thing to do with kids. Read more about this rink from our post on Ice Skating in NYC.\n\n26. Bike Ride Along the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway\n\nThis dedicated two-way bike lane along the Hudson River goes all the way from the tip of Manhattan to the top of Manhattan!\n\nRide as much or as little as you want. Whatever you decide, it's a beautiful ride.\n\nHere's the map of the entire Greenway. Find bike rentals here.\n\nIf you are traveling with kids, most bike rental companies have kid-size bikes.\n\nMUSEUMS AND CITY BUILDINGS IN LOWER MANHATTAN\n\nHere are just a few museums found in Lower Manhattan. Some of these are free or have free hours.\n\nFind out about free museums in NYC.\n\nAlso, some are included for free in one or more of NYC's tourist attraction passes.\n\n27. National Museum of the American Indian\n\nHoused in the exquisite Beaux-Arts for Customs House, the National Museum of the American Indian is an amazing free museum.\n\nIts collection features over 700 Native American objects from across the continents.\n\nPublic tours for adults and families explain the exhibitions and the architecture of this beautiful building.\n\nFor more information on tours, times, and exhibits, check out our in-depth post on this museum.\n\nTip: There are restrooms here!\n\n27. Museum of Jewish Heritage Heritage\n\nThis is an excellently curated museum that honors the victims of the Holocaust by examining Jewish traditions, achievements, and religious faith, thus keeping the Jewish people’s legacy alive today.\n\nVisit their website for more information.\n\n28. African Burial Ground National Monument\n\nThis is the oldest and largest known excavated burial ground for both free and enslaved Africans in North America.\n\nBoth the adjacent interactive visitor center and the outdoor memorial highlight the significant role that enslaved people played in building New York City.\n\nIt is also a Historic Landmark. Find out more from their website.\n\n29. Castle Clinton\n\nIn preparation for the War of 1812, this round fort was built at the southernmost tip of Manhattan in what is known then as The Battery.\n\nThe fort and its cannons were never used, and now it is a landmarked outdoor museum with replica cannons.\n\nCastle Clinton National Monument is especially fun for kids to see.\n\nThere is a small but quite interesting exhibit room with documents, maps, and photographs.\n\nOur post on Battery Park has information on visiting Castle Clinton.\n\nTip: Castle Clinton is the location of the ticket office for all Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island tours.\n\n30. Fraunces Tavern Museum\n\nThis is the only Manhattan museum that is dedicated to Revolutionary War history.\n\nFraunces Tavern was where George Washington bid farewell to all of his officers in 1783, at the end of the American Revolution.\n\nThough small by museum standards, the history of this place is immeasurable.\n\nDownstairs is an actual tavern where you can dine!
