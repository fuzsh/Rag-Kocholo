        "text": "As the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States approaches, there is no better time than Black History Month (February 2024) and Women’s History Month (March 2024) to highlight the under told stories of the black soldiers, indigenous soldiers and women who fought for and created this country. The local non-profit organization Revolutionary Westchester 250 (RW250) is working to share a more complete picture of Westchester County’s crucial role in the war that includes the diversity of those involved in the war effort.\n\nRW250 President Constance Kehoe commented, “There was much broader participation in the American Revolution than many realize. Women played an essential role in local encampments, caring for soldiers and sometimes themselves fighting. Free black men picked up their muskets to enlist as did enslaved men who were promised freedom at the end of the war.” She continued, “Wappinger Sachem Daniel Nimham, Captain in the American Army, along with his son and nearly every adult Wappinger male gave their lives fighting for America in what was then Westchester County. It is important that our county’s commemoration be an inclusive depiction of local sacrifice and success.”\n\nRW250 is sponsoring a presentation in Ossining by author Shirley L. Green, Ph.D. as part of the Bethany Arts Community (BAC) Black History and Culture Exhibit: Black Presence. Profound Influence. The exhibit, running February 2 through March 8, will include the role of black soldiers in the Revolutionary War.\n\nJoyce Sharrock-Cole, BAC board member, Village of Ossining Historian, and member of RW250 Advisory Committee said, “RW250 connected us to the Living History Co. We are excited that they will portray Revolutionary era black soldiers and black women who were camp members during our February 2 opening reception.” Sharrock-Cole continued, “We are grateful to RW250 for sponsoring Dr. Green’s presentation on her book Revolutionary Blacks: Discovering the Frank Brothers, Freeborn Men of Color, Soldiers of Independence as part of our exhibit.” Dr. Green’s February 22 presentation will start at 7 pm after a 6 pm reception at the Ossining Public Library (free but registration required at www.ossininglibrary.org).\n\nRW250 is also sponsoring a presentation by Dr. Green on February 24 at 10 am at the Grinton I. Will Public Library in Yonkers (free but registration required at www.ypl.org/grinton-i-will-library). In both presentations, Dr. Green will discuss the experiences of William and Benjamin Frank, brothers who enlisted in Rhode Island Regiments during the American Revolutionary War in 1777. The brothers’ experiences include two major battles and the tragic circumstances met by Rhode Island soldiers at Pines Bridge (Yorktown, NY) in 1781. Dr. Green will talk about the significant distinction between free Blacks in military service and those who had been enslaved, and how they responded in different ways to the harsh realities of war.\n\nRW250 is sponsoring a one woman living history experience by Judith Kalaora, founder of History at PlayTM LLC, at the Greenburgh Public Library on March 27 at 6:30 pm. In A Revolution of Her Own,TM Kalaora portrays Deborah Sampson, the first woman to enlist, fight, and be honorably discharged from the American Military. Disguised as a man and fighting in the Fourth Massachusetts Regiment, Sampson was wounded near Tarrytown. Families are encouraged to bring school-aged children given the youth focus of this experience (free but registration required at www.greenburghlibrary.org).\n\nGeorge Latimer, Westchester County Executive stated, “Westchester County holds a unique position in the tapestry of the American Revolution, boasting numerous crucial historical sites. In the narrative of our heritage, it is imperative to illuminate the pivotal roles played by indigenous, African-American, and female figures. Through RW250, we embark on a journey to tell the complete story, ensuring that these historical figures' voices and contributions are acknowledged and celebrated, forging a richer and more inclusive understanding of our shared past.”\n\nKehoe added, “Our commemoration of Westchester’s singular role in the Revolutionary War cannot be fully understood without including the names and stories of Captain Sachem Daniel Nimham, the Frank Brothers of the Rhode Island Regiment, Deborah Sampson, and other black and indigenous soldiers and women.”\n\nResidents and visitors can stay informed about these and other upcoming events by subscribing to Revolutionary Westchester 250’s monthly e-newsletter here.

RW250 was created to further the purpose of the national Semiquincentennial Commission, established by Congress in 2016 to commemorate the coming 250th Anniversary of the founding of the United States, 1776-2026.\n\nAbout the Bethany Arts Community\n\nBethany Arts Community in Ossining is a space and environment where all forms of art can be learned and expressed, where hope & acceptance are the norms. Nurturing the creative process, Bethany welcomes artists, from young to old, and all levels of experience, to explore and create art that the community can engage with. Bethany fosters sharing, connection, and collaboration, in an inclusive culture where people experience the power of art to improve lives and expand their perceptions and perspectives of the world. https://bethanyarts.org/\n\nThe British are coming! And the French! In fact, representatives from countries around the world will arrive in the region in July of 2026 to celebrate the 250th Anniversary of the founding of the United States. The local non-profit organization Revolutionary Westchester 250 (RW250) is working to ensure that Westchester County plays a central role in these regional celebrations, matching the crucial role the county played during the Revolutionary War itself. The organization has set an ambitious agenda for 2024, seeking to build momentum towards the “semiquincentennial,” while rolling out new programming ranging from free, GPS-enabled audio tours to presentations across the county.\n\nRW250 President Constance Kehoe commented, “Many Westchester residents remember the excitement of the Bicentennial celebrations in 1976. As we approach the 250th Anniversary of our nation’s founding, we want to ensure that new audiences, including our young residents, gain an appreciation for the role that Westchester County played in the American Revolution.” She continued, “Perhaps we can even inspire a sense of wonder at the origins and future of our nation’s grand democratic experiment while we continue to work together to build a more perfect union.”\n\nDuring 2024, RW250 plans a number of special initiatives. During Black History Month in February, the organization plans programming drawing attention to the often overlooked contribution of Black soldiers of the Rhode Island Regiment. During Women’s History Month in March, a program will highlight the remarkable story of Deborah Sampson, a courageous woman who disguised herself as a man and fought in the Continental Army.\n\nIn spring 2024, the organization will launch a free, GPS-enabled audio tour, created in partnership with TravelStorysGPS, that highlights key Revolutionary-era sites throughout Westchester County. Residents and visitors will be able to download the free app and the tour to their iPhone or Android devices and listen as they travel to the various locations. RW250 will also be debuting a free map and guide to key Revolutionary War sites across the county for residents and visitors to access.\n\nIn fall 2024, RW250 will partner with the Rockefeller Brothers Fund on a special exhibition at The Pocantico Center in Tarrytown with details to be announced.\n\nOne area of focus for RW250 in 2024 is working with regional partners including Sail 4th 250. This organization is well underway in its work to create the “Sail4th 250” celebration in New York, featuring tall ships from around the world. While New York City will be a focus for these vessels in celebrations culminating on July 4, 2026, RW250 is working closely with organizers to extend a Parade of Sail for selected vessels to sail north up the Hudson River immediately after the NYC event. Potential docking in cities including Yonkers and Peekskill, as well as spectator viewing from shoreline communities and the Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge Path, would enable local residents to experience these magnificent ships from distinctive vantage points. The county’s sound shore communities would also experience selected ships sailing into New York City’s breathtaking celebration in advance of July 4th. Long Island Sound was a hunting ground for privateers, smugglers, and spies during the revolution.\n\nThe Hudson River played a pivotal role in the Revolutionary War, so a parade of ships up the river is historically relevant and will also provide access to anniversary celebrations for a broad cross-section of New York State residents. Such maritime displays do require financial support, however, and for this reason RW250 and its regional partners are urging NY State lawmakers to allocate funds towards the initiative. Likewise, the group is urging Governor Kathy Hochul to complete the appointments needed to seat New York State’s 250th Commemoration Commission. Formation of the commission will qualify the State for Federal Funding related to the 250th Anniversary Celebration.\n\nNatasha Caputo, Director of Westchester County Tourism and Film, and a member of the RW250 Advisory Board, added, “Westchester played a vital role in America’s battle for independence. We look forward to welcoming visitors this year and in the years ahead who seek to learn more about the people and places that led to our country’s founding. We’re confident that the combination of historic sites, special events, natural beauty and recreational opportunities here in Westchester will have visitors coming back for more!”\n\nVisitors can stay informed about upcoming events by subscribing to Revolutionary Westchester 250’s monthly e-newsletter at www.rw250.org.

Dr. Michael Crowder, ITPS Public Historian, will moderate the discussion.\n\nThe first book in the Pulitzer Prize-winning author’s Revolution Trilogy recounts the first twenty-one months of America’s violent war for independence. From the battles at Lexington and Concord in spring 1775, to the Battle of White Plains in the fall of 1776 and to those at Trenton and Princeton in winter 1777, American militiamen and then the ragged Continental Army take on the world’s most formidable fighting force. It is a gripping saga alive with astonishing characters: Henry Knox, the former bookseller with an uncanny understanding of artillery; Nathanael Greene, the blue-eyed bumpkin who becomes a brilliant battle captain; Benjamin Franklin, the self-made man who proves to be the wiliest of diplomats; George Washington, the commander in chief who learns the difficult art of leadership when the war seems all but lost. The story is also told from the British perspective, making the mortal conflict between the redcoats and the rebels all the more compelling. Full of riveting details and untold stories, The British Are Coming is a tale of heroes and knaves, of sacrifice and blunder, of redemption and profound suffering.\n\nGet your copy from a local library or bookseller and plan to join us on January 21.\n\nRevolutionary Rye 250 Formed\n\nRW250 president Constance Kehoe was pleased to join more than 30 invitees to the in-person and virtual kick off meeting of Revolutionary Rye 250 on November 28 at the Rye Free Library.

Historian and author Russell Shorto will talk about how the Dutch created the colony of New Netherland, why the English wanted it, and how the clash between these two cultures and the local inhabitants resulted in the unique entity that became New York. Mr. Shorto is the director of the New Amsterdam Project at the New York Historical Society and a senior scholar at the New Netherland Institute. Admission is free.

Herrera uncovers what daily life was like for soldiers during the darkest and coldest days of the American Revolution at the Valley Forge. Here, the army launched its largest and riskiest operation—not a bloody battle against British forces but a campaign to feed itself and prevent starvation or dispersal during the long encampment. Herrera brings to light the army’s herculean efforts to feed itself, support local and Continental governments, and challenge the British Army. Highlighting the missteps and triumphs of both General George Washington and his officers as well as ordinary soldiers, sailors, and militiamen, Feeding Washington’s Army moves far beyond oft-told, heroic, and mythical tales of Valley Forge and digs deeply into its daily reality, revealing how close the Continental Army came to succumbing to starvation and how strong and resourceful its soldiers and leaders actually were.

He was a superb leader, a brilliant tactician, a supremely courageous soldier and one of the most successful military officers of the early years of the Revolutionary War. His capture of Fort Ticonderoga, his Maine mountain expedition to attack Quebec, the famous artillery duel at Valcour Island and the turning point at the Battle of Saratoga all laid the groundwork for our independence. Although his new book doesn’t exonerate Arnold for his treason, historian Jack Kelly forces us to reexamine our understanding of Arnold by offering a fresh new perspective on the events and decisions that led to his momentous change of heart and the permanent stain on his character.

Lemuel Snow, Patriot and Pioneer\n\nWhile serving for eight years in the Revolutionary War, Lt. Lemuel Snow, like most of the Massachusetts Line, spent most of his time in the Hudson River Valley. From Peekskill to Saratoga, Valley Forge, Monmouth, and Providence he endured the hardships that every soldier faced. He was a witness to the execution of André, was at Verplanck’s Point with his regiment to greet Rochambeau and with Washington for the British evacuation of New York City and Washington’s farewell. After the war, he returned to Barnstable, Massachusetts before taking his family West to settle in what would become Indiana.

In addition to objecting to taxation without representation, the participants were also protesting the Tea Act of 1773, which forced them to pay a tax on top of the monopoly prices set by the East India Company and benefitting the family of the royal governor of Massachusetts. To commemorate the 250th anniversary of this harbinger of the Revolution, Benjamin Carp, professor of history at Brooklyn College, discusses the event by examining the actions of those who carried out the raid in the context of the global story of British interests in India, North America and the Caribbean.

Radicals vs. Moderates in the Diplomacy of the American Revolution\n\nDuring the American Revolution, American policymakers were divided into two factions: radicals and moderates. Radicals saw the United States as a great power, equal to France and worthy of alliances with as many foreign powers as possible. Moderates, however, doubted American military power and were content to rely on military assistance from France alone. In each case, battlefield results determined who held the upper hand when it came to diplomacy. Radicals prevailed when the war went well, but power quickly shifted in favor of the moderates when it went poorly. Robert Smith, professor of history at Worcester University, discusses the turbulence surrounding American diplomacy during the Revolution and how the Treaty of Paris was the final diplomatic triumph for the radicals. John Jay, one of the U.S. representatives at the Treaty of Paris, grew up in Rye and retired to Katonah.\n\nThis event is free on Zoom.

The failures, defeats and eventual occupation of the area at the hands of the British forged the resolve and strength of character that would later ensure Patriot victories on distant battlegrounds throughout the rest of the colonies. The British did not evacuate western Queens County until November of 1783, but the events of 1776 would not soon be forgotten during the seven long years of occupation that followed. Join author Richard Melnick as he charts the military, political and cultural history 1776 in Long Island City.\n\nThis lecture will take place in-person and via Zoom.

It was a stunning loss for the British Empire, and thousands of British troops and even more Loyalists were still in the American colonies. Although evacuations occurred in all the major Atlantic ports, New York City was one of the largest, and the last to evacuate. The British under General Sir Guy Carleton had begun evacuating New York in August 1783, and all British citizens were to be gone by noon on November 25. Like many Loyalists, the Philipse family went with them, abandoning Philipse Manor for the safety of England. November 25th became known as “Evacuation Day,” and became an early American holiday as the Patriots celebrated their victory and the freeing of New York City from British occupation.\n\nIn this talk, Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site programs and events manager Sarah Wassberg Johnson outlines the end of the Revolution and Evacuation Day itself. Learn what happened to the Philipses, Philipse Manor, their tenants, and the people they enslaved following the American Revolution.\n\nTickets are $6 for adults, $3 for seniors and students and include museum admission.

The standard narrative tracks their activism from the mid-1760s until the Battles of Lexington and Concord. This story, however, misunderstands and omits the importance of those who became loyalists in the American Revolution. Many, if not most, future loyalists opposed the British Parliament’s reorientation of the British Empire—just like those who became patriots. This talk will focus on a group of New Yorkers who became loyalists and document their paths to the American Revolution. In doing so, it will challenge traditional understandings of not only loyalists but also the coming of the American Revolution, the origins of American political practice, and the history of New York City.\n\nVirtual tickets are free.

Had they not followed their instincts that something was amiss and searched him… had they not rejected his bribes to let him pass… the War could have had a different outcome. As we approach the 250th celebration of the Revolutionary War, we are especially grateful to Rae Faith Van Wart Robinson for sharing her family heirloom with all the people of New York State.”\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, Westchester County was contested ground between British-occupied New York City to the south and the Hudson Highlands to the north where the Continental Army was active.\n\n“This medal is a tangible connection to one of the many important events that occurred in Westchester County during the Revolutionary War,” said Constance Kehoe, president of Revolutionary Westchester 250. “Despite the fact that Westchester was quite literally torn apart by the war, tenant farmers like Van Wart, Paulding and Williams picked up their muskets and fought for their new country and, by extension, us. Theirs is one of many stories that Revolutionary Westchester 250 will be highlighting throughout the 250th Commemoration.”\n\nThe medal is expected to be on periodic display at the New York State Museum and perhaps at other sites.\n\nLiving History-to-Go Catalog & Funding Support\n\nIf you’re looking for a professional living history reenactor for a presentation or event, RW250’s Living History-to-Go catalog is now online.

In a dramatic event in the courthouse two days earlier, delegates of “the Provincial Congress of the Province of New-York” voted to approve the Declaration of Independence. This crucial vote made it unanimous — all 13 colonies had now agreed to fight Great Britain for their independence. The vote on July 9 was also the official birth of the State of New York. A little more than three months later the Battle of White Plains raged, with more than 13,000 troops engaged on both sides and with casualties in the hundreds.\n\nEVENTS\n\nColonial Candle Making\n\nJoin living history presenter Tom Hunt for Colonial candle making.
