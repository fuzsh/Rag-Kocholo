Rest assured that our paperback editions measure only 5″ x 8″ and weigh just 8 ounces. At around 200 pages, our travel books contain all the info needed for an incredible trip, and are not the size of a “brochure.” They have normal sized fonts, and what is not Googleable in them are our concise, personal opinions of each sight, hotel, restaurant, and transport option, which is the very point of our books. Thank you.\n\nBeating the heat in NYC – August 2024\n\nHigh summer temps are notorious here, so how should visitors to our fair city deal with it? Just do what locals do: stay inside with air-conditioning! Let’s see… there’s AC at Broadway shows, there’s AC at Bergdorf Goodman, and oh yeah (our favorite) -there’s AC at the world famous Metropolitan Museum of Art. A person could stay in there all day no problem; seeing the incredible artwork, having lunch at their cafe, attending a film presentation in their theatre, and even enjoying cocktails while a live quintet plays. Well, that last one is only on Friday and Saturday evenings, but you get the point. The Met is beyond your expectations and yes, is bigger than the Louvre in Paris. Do yourself a favor and just go there.\n\nIn Focus: Hunting for Pasticcini in NYC – July 2024\n\nWe know, we know… there are suddenly Eataly stores everywhere now, even in Italy! But at Manhattan’s downtown location something very special is happening. Head Pastry Chef Katia Delogu has created teensy-weensy Italian pastries and desserts that are simply stunning. Even though these little “pasticcini” are bite-sized, no exception has been taken in regard to using only the finest ingredients and that makes them quite delicious. Go and discover them yourself at the Eataly location attached to the new Oculus transportation hub. (There are usually a few at the Flatiron location too, but not many.) Open daily from 7am to 11pm: 150 Greenwich Street, 3rd floor, Downtown Manhattan – 212-897-2895\n\nCentral Park has come alive – June 2024\n\nNew York City should call June “Central Park Month.” That’s because it’s simply perfect there, with lush trees, uncrowded events, and perfect temperatures. We want to share some of the best spots inside this 843-acre, 19th-century, man-made park that was once nothing more than rocks and dry brush. Check out romantic Belvedere Castle, the lakeside Boat House, the remote-controlled Boat Pond, the fancy Conservatory Gardens, the relaxing frog pond, the C.P. Zoo, and our favorite, the Bethesda Fountain. We hope you’ll get to see them all! Be sure to screenshot a map to take it with you… it really helps keep you from inadvertently going in circles.\n\nIn Focus: Rooftop Bars/ May 2024\n\nIt never fails. In New York City, the month of May has simply glorious weather which inevitably brings a desire for us to be out on a rooftop somewhere. NYC has many great rooftop spots, each in their own way special and unique. This is why our 2024 Clued In New York edition has an entire page dedicated the rooftop bars. We adore the one named after its own address: 230 FIFTH. They have both an indoor penthouse restaurant with a view and an outdoor garden area with umbrellas and heat lamps. It’s as if they’re determined to maintain an accessible rooftop area year round–and so they do. Two other rooftops that we love in-season are The Refinery and the Empire Hotel. The ideal time to visit these? Just before sunset of course.\n\nIn Focus: Where to enjoy brunch in New York City – April 2024\n\nApril brings better weather and moderate temperatures to the Northeast so why not make a celebration of it by enjoying a really delicious brunch. In Manhattan, that means a leisurely couple of hours with friends and loved ones at Maison Pickle. This charming restaurant on the upper west side packs a wallop when it comes to food and cocktails. Try their spectacular French toast with fried chicken, amazing French dip heroes, or the legendary patty melt. You’ll be stuffed until dinnertime. Book ahead through their website well in advance if possible. The portions are huge, the ingredients fresh, and the menu offers something for everyone in your party. And their twenty-four-layer chocolate cake is our reason for living. (Don’t be distracted by their sister-restaurant called Jacob’s Pickles because it does not compare.)\n\nExperience New York’s jazz scene – March 2024\n\nThere are more than a few jazz clubs in NYC but no one will dispute that the Blue Note in Greenwich Village (downtown Manhattan) is the historic, quintessential place to go. Every famous jazz musician has played there, which is really all you need to know. Plan ahead for a special evening that you’ll not soon forget; while the Blue Note club is open every night, you’ll need a reservation to get in. Their various performers are listed right on their website. They even offer Sunday brunch jazz events!\n\nIn Focus: The Neue Galerie – February 2024\n\nWhether you’ve seen the Helen Mirren film, The Woman in Gold or not, don’t miss a chance to visit Manhattan’s fabulous Neue Galerie on the upper east side. Inside, like a shining star, is the famous Klimt painting from that film and she is stunning. After being stolen by the Nazi’s and then later displayed at Vienna’s Belvedere art museum, it is now permanently at the Neue. This is thanks to the subject’s niece who fought for it to come to NYC, and also because philanthropist Ronald Lauder paid $135 million specifically so it could be here. By the way, the sausages and cakes at the museum’s lovely Café Sabarsky are super delicious.\n\nPlan ahead for the trip of a lifetime – February 2024\n\nThe more you can plan beforehand, the better your visit to New York City will be. At Clued In Travel Books, we are big believers in having reservations at the restaurants we most desire rather than settling for our second or third choices. Restaurants tend to fill up fast, especially around Valentine’s Day (which has become a global holiday.) As for the city’s top sights, book most of them ahead too because everyone else will be doing the same; times have definitely changed. You didn’t come this far only to find the fabulous Neue Galerie is sold out. Having reservations and tickets brings about the amazing effect of keeping your sight-seeing on track. No flaking out allowed!\n\nIf you are the type of traveler who likes to go to an undiscovered city with no plans (just to see where fate takes you) then we say, “Good luck and bless your heart.” Instead, go ahead and grab one of our travel books and peruse through it to the end. You’ll be shocked at how a place you knew nothing about is suddenly as clear as can be. It’s almost magical.\n\nOne of our newest fans recently stated, “I thought I would “dog -ear” a few pages to go back and read later, and I simply could not put the book down. I ended up with over half of the pages with a turned down corner! I am fortunate to have traveled to over 30 countries and have used all of the popular guidebooks; Rick Steves, Frommers, and Lonely Planet… and this one is best of all.”\n\nThe truth about Christmas Day in Manhattan – December 2023\n\nIf you had the good taste to choose New York City for your Christmas holiday then you might be wondering how to spend your time on Monday, December 25 when most of the city’s sights and restaurants will be closed in observance of Christmas Day. New Yorkers typically have the day off from work to spend time at home with loved ones. The Manhattan restaurants that will be open and happily serving seem to be on the increase lately, a fabulous thing for locals who don’t observe it or simply don’t like to cook. While the dining choices are not at all shabby, they do come with a price and get booked up quickly. That means you may have to be strategic and plan ahead…\n\n1) If you want to be served a nice meal and don’t mind paying a premium price, book your table now. Our favorite restaurant, Red Farm is open that day and happily serves its regular menu. 2) In midtown, the gorgeous Saint Patrick’s Cathedral will be celebrating Mass at many times during the day with no ticket required so check the link above for the exact schedule. 3) If you like shopping, the Holiday Shops at Winter Village will be open on December 25 inside Bryant Park. 4) You can go for an uncrowded view from the top of the Empire State Building or Top of the Rock as both will be open that day as well. 5) Stroll past the Christmas window displays at Saks Fifth Avenue without the usual crowds! 6) The city’s two outdoor ice rinks will be open, one in Central Park and one at Rockefeller Center. 7) The Rockettes will be performing that day at Radio City Music Hall, and many Broadway shows will also be welcoming audiences in. 8) Be out and about after twilight too; slowly but surely other folks will begin to fill the streets and it’s actually quite fun. Merry Christmas!\n\nIn Focus: Cathedral of St. John the Divine decorated – November 2023\n\nMany visitors to New York City have no idea that on Manhattan’s upper west side (at 110th St. and Amsterdam Avenue) there’s a stone-mason’d Gothic/Romanesque Revival cathedral that is the second largest in the world, surpassed only by St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. It is currently being decorated for the holidays which only adds to its appeal.\n\nNeedless to say, St. John the Divine is totally worth a visit and is easily accessible by subway or taxi from midtown. The immensity of its interior must be seen to be believed and is awe inspiring, especially when one considers that it has been being built stone-by-stone the old fashioned way and is still being built as we speak! For something different, check it out and don’t miss the huge pipe organ. Admission is free, and Marlow Bistro (across the way on the diagonal corner) is a great place to stop for an upscale brunch if you find yourself in this area on a weekend day.\n\nHallowe’en in New York – October 2023\n\nNew York’s famous costumed parade on Halloween night in Greenwich Village hardly needs to be mentioned. This year it celebrates its 50th anniversary! If you have a costume, just join in by lining up anytime between 6:30pm and 9pm at Sixth Avenue and Canal Street… if you don’t have a costume, watch others vie for attention in this fun and memorable celebration. This year’s theme is appropriately named, “Upside Down/Inside Out.” There’s an official after-party at the famous Webster Hall.\n\nFor something else spooky, stop by Central Park’s Harlem Meer pond at Fifth avenue and 110th Street around 4pm on October 26th. The annual Pumpkin Flotilla could make your own jack o’lantern a star! And that’s your NYC October need-to-know.\n\nPlanning ahead for an autumn visit – September 2023\n\nIf you’ll be heading to New York City for an autumn getaway, we have a few suggestions for you. With the heat of the summer behind us, there are some fabulous events you might want to take part in. The first is the beloved Feast of San Gennaro, an Italian parade and celebration in Manhattan’s “Little Italy” neighborhood which duly features Italian foods and heritage from September 14 to 24. Next is the New York City Wine & Food Festival where celebrity chefs and great food are featured from October 12 to 15. If you’ll be here over Halloween, be sure to bring a costume so that you can march in the famous, annual Greenwich Village Halloween Parade. So fun!\n\nSometimes you just want a great sandwich – August 2022\n\nIn New York, that means heading over to an Italian deli. The best one in town is called Pisillo Italian Panini. Their hoagies (as we New Yorkers call them) are giant and cannot be eaten by one person. This means that the $16.00 price tag is really only $8.00 or less per person. Their salumi, hams, and other sliced meats are the best quality you can find anywhere. Pisillo is open daily until 4pm and located at 124 West 25th Street.\n\nIn focus: Bad Roman – June 2023\n\nThings are beginning to happen here again. The opening of a new restaurant has been a rare thing of late, and there just hasn’t been much to report on. That’s why we’re so pleased to recommend a newcomer to the dining scene: Bad Roman. For those travelers who are familiar with the Quality Branded restaurant group, this is one of theirs. The decidedly over-the-top plating and wild interior designs remind us of the style of the Big Mamma Group restaurants in London. That means we were already disposed to love it even before eating there. Top notch ingredients define their Italian cuisine and bring justice to the place. It’s sudden popularity means that it’s not easy to get a reservation, but you should try anyway. Open Table automatically opens up reservations for Bad Roman at midnight three weeks prior. The fastest clickers will be rewarded. It’s located on the third floor of 10 Columbus Circle.\n\nIn focus: NY’s Museum of Modern Art – March 2023\n\nThere are modern art museums all over the world and some are just not that great. This one is the exception, and is an important, major museum. Located right in mid-town at 11 West 53rd Street, it’s also easy to get to. Some of the best reasons to visit MOMA are often their highly unusual temporary installations. Currently, there’s one by artist Georgia O’Keeffe. While best known for her flower paintings, she also excelled at works in charcoal, pencil, watercolor, and pastel. This special exhibition actually features O’Keeffe’s working methods. You’ll see how she reworked the same subject matters over and over, transforming them as she did. These pieces from the 1930s and ‘40s are amazing but won’t be at MOMA long. If it peaks your interest or if you just crave truly great modern art masterpieces, reserve a convenient timed-entry ticket here.\n\nAirport transfer fees and taxi fares increase – February 2023\n\nAnyone purchasing our Clued In New York ebook previous to this announcement should note the change in prices listed for getting to and from the airports. For arrivals at JFK Intl. Airport, see the new listing is below. We are currently working to update all of the fares for airport transfers and will republish on Amazon in the coming days to reflect this.\n\nFor around $87: Taxi flat fare of $70 plus bridge tolls, assorted fees, and tip.\n\nFor around $14: AirTrain’s Metrocard fare of $9 to the Long Island Railroad’s (LIRR) shuttle service in Queens for another $5. This new “Madison” line pulls right into Manhattan’s Grand Central Terminal near 47th Street.\n\nFor around $12: AirTrain’s Metrocard fare of $9 to the subway in Queens for another $2.75 with continuing service to Manhattan,\n\nFor around $60 to $100: Use an online car service; NYC has both Lyft, Uber, and Carmel.\n\nFor free: Complimentary Hotel Shuttle Vans can be made available if you are lucky enough to have been offered one by your hotel.\n\nIn focus: The brand new Madison train line – February 2023\n\nWhen other websites are touting where to eat on Valentine’s Day, we’ve decided to go in a different direction due to some wonderful news regarding airport transfers in and out of NYC. Okay –not terribly romantic perhaps but important for your wallet. Let us explain…\n\nSince the pandemic, those convenient and affordable coach-style buses that ran every few minutes from spots in Manhattan to JFK International Airport understandably vanished. Now it’s three years later and they have not returned. This means that all travelers have to take a very expensive taxi or Uber for around $80 to $100, or take the short AirTrain ride to an area of Queens to catch the subway which was cheap but not safe –especially with all your luggage!\n\nAll that changed last week with the grand opening of the new Madison Train Line created by the Long Island Railroad (LIRR). It takes travelers from Grand Central Terminal in midtown to connect directly with the AirTrain which runs the JFK terminals. The total price is around $13 in either direction. And bypassing all that traffic means it’s fast too. The $11 billion project included putting a new entrance on Madison Avenue as well as making this line conveniently connected inside to the rest of Grand Central. So fancy! It’s the biggest LIRR expansion in a century. Check this website for hours and details.\n\nBy the way, for those travelers who thought the AirTrain was one of those rail lines that whisked visitors from JFK to Manhattan, that is incorrect. The AirTrain is (and has always been) a short-route ‘loop’ that connects the airport terminals to a section of Queens that is not far from the airport itself. Now it has something viable to connect to!\n\nPastry obsession solved – New York City- January 2023\n\nThere’s nothing that can fill a cold, empty feeling in the tummy like pastry… really good pastry. It’s true that our local obsession with it switches around depending on the season, but right now it lies firmly with Maz-eh-dah Bakery at 28 Greenwich Avenue in Manhattan. The incredible assortment, and especially the custard-filled donut, offers their clientele a mind-blowing bakery experience. Opens early everyday.\n\nThe truth about Christmas Day in Manhattan – December 2022\n\nIf you had the good taste to choose New York City for your Christmas holiday then you might be wondering how to spend your time on Sunday, December 25 when most of the city’s sights and restaurants will be closed in observance of Christmas Day. New Yorkers typically have the day off from work to spend time at home with loved ones. The Manhattan restaurants that will be open and happily serving seem to be on the increase lately, a fabulous thing for locals who don’t observe it or simply don’t like to cook. While the dining choices are not at all shabby, they do come with a price and get booked up quickly.

Merry Christmas!\n\nIn Focus: Ice Skating in NYC – November 2022\n\nMost people know about the small ice rink at Rockefeller Center because it’s world famous. But we prefer the larger Wollman Rink in Central Park, which is situated just off Fifth Avenue near 65th Street. It’s behind the Central Park Zoo so you can’t see it from the street. It is glorious somehow, with both trees and skyscrapers all around you as you skate. Are you just visiting here and and not packing those old ice skates? Not a problem…they have a large indoor rental service right there on the property. (Their season runs from late October through the first Sunday in April.)\n\nVisit real speakeasy bars with a knowledgeable guide – September 2022\n\nYou might not have considered taking a night tour while you’re away from your daily grind but it’s a fun way to learn about New York’s fascinating past. This one will undoubtedly become a cherished memory. Our friends at Alex’s Tours know just where to go so that you can experience prohibition era speakeasies, secret taverns, and the famous bars that have survived the decades. An award winning cocktail is included and you can purchase additional beverages if you desire. Here’s a handy link to his informative nighttime tour that’s held in the historic lower east side neighborhood of Manhattan. Just book it through the website calendar. Details about other speakeasies in Manhattan can be found in our Clued In New York book.\n\nClimb on the outside of a skyscraper – August 2022\n\nIf you’re coming to New York and have nerves of steal, don’t miss this new, ultimate heart-pounding experience. Our friends at City Climb will literally hook you up and let you go. They boast the highest open-air building ascents in the world where climbers can now scale the outside of a Manhattan skyscraper more than 1,200 feet above the ground. It’s an adventure unlike any other and will be an achievement that you’ll remember forever. Quick tip: If you can’t stand to look at the photos they’ve posted then you may not be ready for this adventure. If you are, you can book it right on their website. Good luck.\n\nVisit something special that’s probably off your radar – June 2022\n\nThis month, all of our City-Extras will highlight an awesome local sight that you’ve probably never heard of. (If you have, kudos to you!) In New York City that has to be the ultra-historic Fraunces Tavern in Lower Manhattan. Since its opening in 1762, this tavern has been the place where important events surrounding the Revolutionary War took place. The infamous Sons of Liberty group regularly held their meetings here. Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton also dined here just one week before their duel.\n\nFraunces Tavern is one of the top spots for true Americana in NYC. Originally built as a private residence in 1719, it was turned into a tavern and has remained so ever since. It is open everyday until late and offers visitors dining, a bar room, an upstairs piano bar, and a small museum room. Don’t miss the Happy Hour oysters!\n\nVisit the Met Museum’s reopening of its Costume Institute – May 2022\n\nThis anthology of fashion is titled In America and takes a deep look at what has defined American fashion through the years. Opening to the public on May 7, it features truly amazing finds from the cape worn by George Washington at his inauguration to the actual jacket that Abraham Lincoln was wearing when he was assassinated. Presented in rooms that display a decidedly more theatrical style than we have seen here before, this exhibit is extremely visual and a lot of fun. Pertinent info can be found at the website above. Don’t miss it!\n\nEaster Treats abound at Manhattan’s “Stick With Me” – April 2022\n\nAs the holiday approaches, so does the need for new sweets. If you want to go lux this year, head over to the fabulous candy shop called Stick With Me. This place will solve all of your gifting challenges albeit for a price. Homemade bonbons in unexpected gourmet flavors like Bananas Foster, Black Sesame, Cassis, and Passion Fruit taste as good as they look. The candymaker was a pastry chef before turning her passion to chocolates, and none of her artistic skill has gone to waste. They also offers delicate caramels and fudge wrapped in clear twisted cellophane. Don’t miss this place! Open daily from noon to 7pm at 202 Mott Street, NYC – Telephone 646-918-6336\n\nNeed a good reason to come to NYC? – February 2022\n\nWe have just the one! Elton John will be bringing his final tour to New York’s Madison Square Garden amphitheater this month. Be part of history as the famed musician winds down his long career with live performances of his chart-topping, original songs. Grab your tickets here as soon as possible to avoid disappointment. This is definitely a once in a lifetime event.\n\nPlan ahead for the trip of a lifetime – January 2022\n\nYou might not think so right now, but travel will be returning in a big way and those who plan now will reap the benefits. As the pandemic fades, try to be one of the first to make a trip to New York and enjoy it in a blissfully uncrowded way. Try making a detailed yet fluid itinerary without precise dates. Pencil in the days of the week only, noting which of your preferred sights are closed on Sundays or Mondays, etc. This will give you a basic framework on which to build your dream journey.\n\nThe more you can plan beforehand, the better it will be. At Clued In Travel Books we are big believers in having reservations at the restaurants we most desire rather than settling for our second or third choices. Dinner reservations are especially likely to fill up if not made in advance. As for the best sights, well, these must be booked ahead (due to the requirements of contactless service.) And with absolutely everyone now booking ahead, these too are more likely to sell out.\n\nTravelers visiting our particular website probably understand this so we won’t beat a dead horse. If you are the type of traveler who likes to go somewhere with no plans or reservations in order to just see where fate takes you, we say, “Good luck and bless your heart.”\n\nSo, grab one of our travel books and peruse through it to the end. You’ll be shocked at how a city you knew nothing about is suddenly as familiar as can be. It’s almost magical.\n\nMerry Christmas & Happy New Year!\n\nThe folks here at Clued In Travel Books wish you and yours a wonderful and safe holiday season filled with lots of love and lots of food. If you avoid conversations about religion, politics, and mask mandates you’ll be just fine! Let’s hope we get back to some normalcy in 2022, especially in regard to travel. It’s what we live for.\n\nAll the best to all of you, Dean & Andie\n\nOur brand new edition for 2022 has arrived – December 2021\n\nSome things have changed in New York, but much has stayed the same. We’ worked hard on finishing our brand new version of Clued In New York for 2022. If you’re curious about it, use the link above to see the current product page. Enjoy!\n\nAn Effortless Thanksgiving in Manhattan – November 2021\n\nMost of us cooked our own meal for Thanksgiving last year (for obvious reasons.) This is not necessarily the norm in New York City; many New Yorkers like to enjoy an upscale holiday meal at one of the city’s great restaurants. As a visitor, this would be a necessity. So for all you travelers to NYC this year (on the holiday or otherwise!) we must mention the exquisite culinary experience that awaits you at Lincoln Ristorante. Yes, it usually serves up incredible Italian food but it not limited in this way on Thanksgiving.\n\nCentrally located at Lincoln Center near Broadway and 65th Street, we can honestly say that Lincoln is one of our all-time favorite restaurants in the world. It is where we spent our Thanksgiving right before the pandemic hit. Obviously, reservations are necessary so give them a call at 212-359-6500. Bon appetit!\n\nSummer Happenings / July 2021\n\nThere have not been many major events in New York City lately, but the ones that are here are hard to miss and positively worth mentioning. The Natural History Museum (AMNH) at 86th Street and Central Park West has just opened a new exhibit in their gems wing and it’s a winner! With its 2,000 permanent specimens of gems and jewelry, this wing was already great. Add to that a temporary exhibit titled Beautiful Creatures and a visit is definitely in order. Check out the current safety details right there on their website.\n\n“Opening in the new Melissa and Keith Meister Gallery, Beautiful Creatures showcases exquisite historic and contemporary jewelry inspired by the animal kingdom.”\n\nWe’re back! May 2021\n\nClued In cities all over the place are beginning to come back to life. Because of all the recent positive changes, we have just updated our travel books to be current for summer 2021. We will continue to update them as things change further. In anticipation of future travel, we welcome you back to New York and to the world!\n\nTaxi Clues for NYC / March 2020\n\nSince some travelers are looking to avoid crowds and mass transit this spring, we’re providing at-a-glace info regarding official taxi cabs in the Big Apple. While not as inexpensive, a taxi will make you feel more confident and get you where you’re going in style. And if your party is more than a single rider, it can be a great value. Just budget it in!\n\nOfficial NYC taxis are yellow. Don’t hire unauthorized drivers to take you anywhere.\n\nOnly taxis with their center roof light numbers lit are available for hire. Don’t hail one with its roof light off unless you want everyone to know you are a tourist.\n\nIf you are having trouble finding one that is available, go where taxis go. This could be the nearest hotel or hot spot and wait your turn in their active taxi queue.\n\nTips are expected but don’t need to be more than a dollar or two (within the city). If you’re taking a taxi to or from the airport, the driver’s tip should be at least 15% of the total fare, especially if he/she assists with any luggage.\n\nA maximum of four people are allowed in a yellow cab, although a child 7 or under may sit on someone’s lap. Due to space constraints, the fourth person will have to sit in front with the driver.\n\nNYC also offers Uber, Via-Car, and Lyft\n\nAROUND TOWN:\n\nWithin the city the rates are $2.50 initial charge, plus 50 cents per 1/5 mile, 50 cents MTA State Surcharge, 30 cents Improvement Surcharge, 50 cents overnight surcharge 8pm to 6am, a $1.00 rush hour surcharge from 4pm to 8pm on weekdays, excluding holidays, plus a New York State Congestion Surcharge of $2.50\n\nThe good news? There is no extra charge for more than one passenger, your luggage, or paying with a credit card. The on-screen rate message should read: “Rate #01 – Standard City Rate.”\n\nMake sure to always take your receipt in case you leave something in the cab!\n\nGreen Taxis operate locally and pick up in areas north of 116th Street.\n\nAIRPORT TRANSFERS:\n\nTrips between the LGA Airport are charged the standard metered fare.\n\nTrips between Manhattan and the JFK Airport charge a fixed rate of $52. plus 50 cents MTA State Surcharge, 30 cents Improvement Surcharge, a $4.50 rush hour surcharge (4pm to 8pm weekdays, excluding legal holidays, any road tolls, plus a New York State Congestion Surcharge of $2.50. We know, it’s ridiculous.\n\nTrips between Manhattan and the EWR Airport charge the standard metered fare plus a $17.50 Newark Surcharge, 30 cents Improvement Surcharge, plus road tolls… and will include the drivers’ return tolls too. The on-screen rate message should read “Rate #3 – Newark Airport.”\n\nOur Manhattan NTK / February 2020\n\nEvery so often, we like to add a Need-to-Know for our favorite cities. With a new year and new decade upon us, it’s time to mention a seasonal pastime that has all of New York talking! Bumper Cars on Ice is back again this year in mid-town’s Bryant Park but will end on February 28th. That means you need to book by February 9th if you want to get reserved tickets! Slide, spin, and laugh your day away with this unique diversion. So fun!\n\nTreat yourself to a totally amazing pie – January 2020\n\nWe’ll be adding this humble pie shop to the “Treats” section of our next edition but since that’s a ways off, we just had to tell our readers about it right now. Petee’s Pies on the Lower East Side of Manhattan (and in Brooklyn too) is definitely our latest obsession. Their homemade pies are all butter and taste better than any we have ever had. Voted best pies in New York state, it’s clearly not just us that thinks so! The pecan-enhanced crumble on their Pear Crumble Pie is simply to die for and is our current favorite, but everything they make is divine and worth a trip downtown. Trust us on this one.\n\nWhere to enjoy an amazing holiday dinner – December 2019\n\nWe love having a meal with a festive menu at holiday time, and for a very cool one, head uptown to Harlem and savor some hearty soul food at Red Rooster (owned by celebrity chef Marcus Samuelson.) This is the perfect place to eat good food without the “stuffy” atmosphere of those expensive hotel restaurants in mid-town. Red Rooster is offering both an a la carte menu and a prix fix family-style menu on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Here’s a sampling of their prix fix dishes:\n\nHousemade cornbread with pumpkin butter / Jerk Short Ribs or Roasted Branzino / Cheesy grits, collard greens, or garlic mashed potatoes with chives / Chocolate cake with pistachios or cranberry gateau\n\nSee the Met Museum as never before – November 2019\n\nOur friends at Viator are now offering a fabulous “Empty Met” opportunity! You can now take a special guided tour and see its best treasures before the museum opens. No lines to get in, no crazy ticket queues, and no crowds! This is how true enthusiasts should see The Metropolitan Museum, the largest art museum in the world. Fantastic! Click here for more information.\n\nHalloween party-time in New York City – October 2019\n\nOur recommendations for NYC in autumn usually include gallery openings or new restaurants, but our new series of “Bored In” travel books have inspired us to go in a spookier direction this year. While the creepiest thing in Manhattan is probably just walking through the garment district late at night, there are some fun Halloween parties going on. The biggest one is held at on the west side of Manhattan in midtown. Yes, it’s the huge Monster Ball, where ghouls can dance and party until 5am. If you want to attend this costumed event, you’ll need to book your tickets as soon as possible at their official website here. You can choose either regular admission or a VIP spot that includes alcohol. (Note that the ball takes place on Saturday, October 26th this year.) Happy Halloween!\n\nIt’s the start of the social season in NYC – September 2019\n\nThere’s a lot going on in this so-called capital of the world, so if you’re planning to visit during the fall season, snag a ticket soon for the famed Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center beginning on September 23rd. Whether you’re an opera fan or not, a performance in this impressive opera house should definitely be on your bucket list, and they offer so many different performances that there’s definitely something for everyone. As of this posting there are still seats available this month and next.\n\nIn addition, legendary comedian Jerry Seinfeld will be performing stand-up at the Beacon Theatre (on the Upper West Side) on September 20, October 25, October 26 and November 22. As of this posting, tickets are still available. Check the Beacon’s website for more info.\n\nYes, bliss can be found for free in NYC – August 2019\n\nNYC’s annual Yoga in Bryant Park (Sixth Avenue at 42nd Street) continues through the month of August. This is a huge free event that you can join just by showing up with your mat. The one hour classes have different instructors throughout the event which are held on Tuesday mornings at 10am on the upper terrace, and also on Thursday evenings at 6pm right on the lawn. All levels are welcome so come find your inner peace among the trees and skyscrapers!\n\nIn focus: Fraunces Tavern – July 2019\n\nWhile writing about the famous Tolbooth Tavern on our City-Extras page for Edinburgh, we got to thinking about New York’s oldest: the Fraunces Tavern. It is very famous to locals but not as well known to visitors. We think it’s worth the trip downtown for its historical significance as well as just to down a few pints of lager. Ever wonder where General George Washington gave his formal farewell to the officers of the Continental Army? It was right here in 1783. There’s even a famous engraving of the event. You’ll find Fraunces Tavern where it’s been since 1719 (making it 300 years old) at 54 Pearl Street at the corner of Broad Street. It is New York’s oldest surviving building. There’s now an adjoining museum too.\n\nStart of the ballet season – May 2019\n\nThe famed American Ballet Theatre company will once again take over the gorgeous Metropolitan Opera House with performances from May 13 to July 6. Classic favorites and new premieres will be featured and you can still snag a good seat if you book now. Never been to a real ballet performance? Give it a try; you’ll be very surprised. Visit their website for all the current offerings and seasonal calendar. Feeling fancy? Their special Gala performance is scheduled for the evening of May 20th.\n\nIn Focus: Where to brunch in New York City – April 2019\n\nApril and May bring better weather and moderate temperatures to the Northeast so why not make a celebration of it by enjoying a really delicious brunch… in Manhattan that means a leisurely couple of hours with friends and loved ones at the Clinton Street Baking Company. This charming cafe on the lower east side is unassuming but packs a wallop when it comes to the food! Try their spectacular blueberry pancakes or chicken with waffles and feel stuffed until dinnertime. Book ahead through their website, get your name on the waitlist, and then stroll the historic neighborhood while you wait for your table-is-ready text!\n\nIn Focus: Dog Show – February 2019\n\nFor a completely different experience in New York in February, there’s nothing better (or more unusual) than an evening at the annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show at the famed Madison Square Garden indoor super-arena. This huge televised event is held over two consecutive nights with judging of different breed groups on each. You can buy tickets for one or both starting at $40, and can find out which breeds are scheduled at the website below. If you’ve never been in an arena with 20,000 dog enthusiasts, let us tell you it’s a trip. Held this year on February 11 & 12: See the dogs!\n\nWhere to shop the sales – January 2019\n\nLike many cities across the U.S., New York puts its best designer items on sale after the holidays and begins presenting its spring collections. If you’re visiting New York in January and have the urge to do some shopping (or just want to come home with one really special item) now is the time. The most famous shopping streets in New York are Fifth Avenue (between 50th and 59th Streets) and Madison Avenue (between 59th and 72nd Streets.) These two shopping avenues run north/south on the city’s East Side, not far from Central Park. For those who are unfamiliar with Manhattan, this means that the best shopping can be found right in the city center, not far from most of its famous museums. This may be helpful to know even if you don’t plan on hitting the boutiques… being aware of this type of location also tells you precisely where a city’s most desirable neighborhoods are. That’s usually where you’ll also find some of the best hotels, and some top-notch restaurants too.\n\nNew Year’s Eve in New York City – December 2018\n\nIf you’ll be one of the thousands coming to New York for New Year’s Eve, you’ll probably end up in Times Square. This is a travel destination that many have on their bucket lists and hope to do at least once. The problem with this particular celebration is two-fold: NYC is always very cold on December 31 and has been known to hit the below zero mark; it’s also so popular, that to gain entrance to the main part of the square (which is free) you have to go there at least six hours early. No bathrooms, no heaters, no freedom to move about because all the entrances to the area are controlled by the NYPD. You can’t run in and out to get a coffee or more handwarmers. If you have this kind of perseverance than good for you– you might even be seen on TV! If something a bit calmer is needed, don’t worry. There are many places that celebrate, including top restaurants like Hakkasan which will be offering a prix fixe menu. If you want to get dressed up and spend some real money, grab a reservation for dinner and dancing at the Rainbow Room located on the 65th floor of 30 Rock. Wherever you end up, treat yourself to an award-winning brunch the next day at Norma’s on West 56th Street. Check out their incredible menu here.\n\nAutumn In New York – November 2018\n\nIf you’ll be one of the clever travelers coming to NYC before the onslaught of visitors who descend upon it for Christmas and New Year’s then good for you. You may not have the opportunity to spend your actual holiday in the Big Apple, but you’ll get a taste of what this incredible city is really like for its local residents. Why not try for a table at the fabulous restaurant, Buddakan or finally see the musical, The Book of Mormon ? Both will make for great memories. We welcome you to our city and hope you’ll grab a copy of Clued In New York. It has info not found in other guides which is exactly why it stands apart from the rest!\n\nIn Focus: Halloween – October 2018\n\nNYC is famous for its huge, free-participation Halloween Parade and this year promises to have temperatures that are 15 degrees warmer than usual. That’s a real plus, especially for those sexier skimpy costumes. If you plan on being in Manhattan on Wednesday, October 31, be sure to pack a costume and join the fun. This year’s theme is “I Am A Robot” but all styles of costume are welcome. (Only persons in costume may join in the parade.) Enter the procession at 6th Avenue and Canal Street between 6:30 pm and 8:30pm to show off your look to the thousands that watch from the sidewalks. You will have the time of your life!\n\nDining Update – September 2018\n\nWe’ve discovered another restaurant that’s worthy of our “food made with love” standard. It will be included in the soon-to-be-unveiled 2019 edition of Clued In New York but as usual we can’t wait because we’re too excited for our readers to know about it. It’s called Maison Pickle and is a kind of southern meets French-American cuisine. Whatever it is, it’s delicious! The portions are huge, the ingredients fresh, and the menu offers something for everyone in your party. Their website doesn’t do it justice but here it is anyway. Their twenty-four layer chocolate cake is our new reason for living.\n\nIn Focus: September Happenings – September 2018\n\nWe simply adore “Broadway Week.” It’s a Buy-One Get-One-Free ticket event and it’s coming up soon. If you’re heading to the Big Apple between September 3-16, go online and purchase two for one tickets to a Broadway show! Once the participating shows are announced on August 15, Ticketmaster will provide direct links to purchase some of these special tickets. Just use code BWAYWK before check-out. Shows not handled by Ticketmaster will be listed for purchase through Telecharge after the announcement at NYCgo.com.\n\nHint: Based on past experience, Ticketmaster will probably offer Aladdin, Frozen, Kinky Boots, The Lion King, SpongeBob SquarePants, and Wicked. The shows offered through nycgo.com will probably be A Bronx Tale, Anastasia, Beautiful: The Carole King Musical, Chicago, The Children, Farinelli and the King, Hello, Dolly!, John Lithgow: Stories by Heart, Latin History for Morons, Once on This Island, The Parisian Woman, Phantom of the Opera, and School of Rock. If you’re wondering about Hamilton being a participant in Broadway Week, the answer is yes, when hell freezes over.\n\nIn Focus: Casablanca Hotel, NYC – July 2018\n\nThis summer we’re featuring some of our favorite hotels and in Manhattan that means the Casablanca Hotel. Their motto is generous hospitality but we think that’s an understatement. Not only does this charming place make you feel like you’re staying inside someone’s grand home, the complimentary offerings are many. A sumptuous breakfast, evening wine and cheese, WiFi, bottled water, concierge services, all-day coffee, cookies and fruit, comfortable beds, and in-room DVD player & library are some of what you can expect. This is a very rare thing in New York City. Once inside, the bustling city seems to simply slip away and you’ll have a hard time believing you’re just sixty feet from Times Square!\n\nIn Focus: To bike or not to bike – June 2018\n\nOkay, you’re planning a New York visit (or are already there) and you’re curious about bike rentals. This is perfectly understandable, especially considering the crazy traffic and weaving taxis of Manhattan. We actually think it’s a super-fun thing to do and heartily recommend it. Here’s why:\n\nYou can rent a bike from the inexpensive and very reputable bike service BikeRent NYC right at the 59th Street/ Fifth Avenue entrance of Central Park. This means that you and your loved ones don’t even have to get near the traffic. Central Park is huge and has miles of paths for you to speed along with the wind at your back. Helmets and locks come-with for free so you’ll be able to stash your bike whenever you want an take advantage of some of the beautiful things to see there. We simply love the Bathesda Fountain! Give it a try… just dress comfortably, and “work off” that glorious Red Farm dinner from the night before. (Skip the horse carriage ride because it’s boring, you can’t see the horse when you’re in the carriage, it’s too quick, it’s super expensive, and it’s cruel for the horses.) Go biking instead.\n\nMay update: Awaiting your upcoming trip\n\nIf you’re like us, you like to think about your travel almost as much as doing it! For those dreamers and planners, we thought we’d take a moment to introduce you to our favorite live viewers, Skyline Webcams. Through their terrific website, we’ve watched everything from the New Year’s celebration at Times Square to the traffic jams in midtown. You just never know what you’re going to see. You might just get inspired to travel somewhere you’ve never even considered, like Malta where Skyline actually has an underwater live cam checking out all those fish! So fun.\n\nIn Focus: The Chinese New Year takes Manhattan – February 2018\n\nIf you’re visiting New York City in late February this year, don’t miss the exotic and colorful Chinese New Year Parade & Festival. On February 25 from 1pm to 5pm, downtown’s Chinatown neighborhood will rock with spectacle. The parade will start on Canal Street and continue on Mott Street and then over to Broome Street. Viewing is free, as is the neighborhood festival. Meal suggestions are our specialty so here are a few for that day: Chinese Tuxedo (expensive), or 456-Shanghai (cheap). Both are delicious! Or, you could simply head up to the West Village and have an early supper at our favorite, Red Farm on Hudson Street. Gong hei fat choy and Gong she fa tsai!\n\nUpdate for the Met Museum – February 2018\n\nThere will be a change in the admission policy at New York’s famed Metropolitan Museum of Art which is our #1 sight recommendation in Clued In New York. Beginning in March 2018, their forty year policy of allowing visitors to “pay what they want” for admission will be replaced with a mandatory fixed amount of $25 (unless you can show proof of local residency in the tri-state area.) The full price ticket will be good for entry for three days in a row. Revisions to the Clued In New York ebook are underway and will be reflected in books purchased from February onward.\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy New Year from New York City 2017!\n\nEnjoy a spectacular holiday season in New York. The giant Christmas Tree at Rockefeller Center is lit, the Broadway shows and the Met Opera are in full swing, New York City Ballet is presenting its delightful production of The Nutcracker with a full orchestra, and the Rockettes are kicking up their legs at the world famous Radio City Music Hall. Need some last minute gifts? The Big Apple’s huge department stores are decked out, and the city vibe is spirited everywhere you go. Want a delicious holiday meal? Our top pick, Red Farm, has two locations and you can snag a table there for a truly scrumptious meal on Christmas or New Year’s much easier than on regular days. And don’t forget to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art –it will take your breath away. If you are heading to Times Square for the New Year’s Eve celebration, be sure to get there several hours early so you’re not too far back. We like the area closest to 45th Street. Tip: Choose a hotel in the central section of Manhattan to make your visit truly special.\n\nIn Focus: Special Event/ April 2017\n\nThe annual Tribeca Film Festival takes place in lower Manhattan from April 19 to April 30 and will once again bring celebrities and movie aficionados to the Big Apple. You too can be part of this wonderful event so visit their official website for more information.\n\nUpdate: January 2017\n\nWe are pleased to announce the fabulous 2017 edition of Clued In New York, available only at Amazon.com… Boqueria is a new recommendation from our Manhattan team and is definitely worth a look. We just adore their bacon-wrapped, stuffed dates. Yum!\n\nOur other new fav is the petite Greenwich Village restaurant Quality Eats. You will have a memorable meal there for sure– if you can get in. Reserve early exclusively through their website. We just love their bacon-peanut butter-jalapeno jelly appetizer.\n\nUpdate: Fall 2016\n\nVisitors to the Big Apple this fall will be among the first to discover and explore downtown’s newest spectacle: the Oculus transportation hub and shopping mall, which is just steps from the 911 Memorial and 1 World Trade Center. This enormous, winged-dove arcade is unusual to say the least, and is likely to impress even the booshiest New Yorker."
