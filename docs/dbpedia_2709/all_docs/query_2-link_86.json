        "text": "PROJECT DETAILS:\n\nFrances' Tavern was originally built in about 1700 as a private residence, turned warehouse. in 1762 it was bought by Sam Fraunces, who opened it as a tavern under the sign of \"Queen Charlotte\", later changed to \"Fraunces' Tavern\". It is most famous for it's Long Room, where the first meeting of the New York Chamber of Commerce took place, and where Washington bade farewall to his generals and officers at the close of the War of Independence. That is where countless history-making meetings and social gatherings took place during more then 300 years of the Tavern's history.\n\nIn 1985, this historic landmark underwent another renovation. The exterior restoration of Fraunces Tavern Restaurant included the cleaning of all brick and trim , and replacement of all cracked and eroded mortar joints , mismatched brick and metal cornices and the marble portico . In the existing portico, extensive deterioration and discoloration of the stone were observed. A marble similar in color, with greater density was sought: Georgia Marble was chosen.\n\nThe existing portico was dismantled and delivered to a stoneyard for the making of templates. Details were achieved by numerous cuts made with carborundum wheels . Dentals were carved by a stone carver . Blocks of marble were shipped to New Castle, Pensylvania, where the columns, column caps and bases were produced. New footings were set at the tavern, and the portico was installed by late September 1984. In 1998, Robert Young & Sons, Inc. was honored by Tucker Architectural Award.\n\nPROJECT DETAILS:\n\nFrances' Tavern was originally built in about 1700 as a private residence, turned warehouse. in 1762 it was bought by Sam Fraunces, who opened it as a tavern under the sign of \"Queen Charlotte\", later changed to \"Fraunces' Tavern\".
