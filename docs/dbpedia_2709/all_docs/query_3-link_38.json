        "text": "Founded in 1967, the South Street Seaport Museum honors the legacy of one of the busiest seaports in the world, New York. Located in the heart of the historic Seaport District in downtown Manhattan overlooking the East River and the Brooklyn Bridge, the museum campus includes indoor exhibits, a fleet of vessels docked at adjacent Pier 16, a print shop, and tons of weekly and seasonal programs, sailing excursions, and family friendly activities.\n\nThe museum’s fleet includes the 1930 tug boat W.O. Decker (offering 75 minute, weekend afternoon boat rides throughout New York Harbor- and a great option for families with kids!), the 1885 schooner Pioneer (offering daytime, sunset, and sea chantey singing sails through New York Harbor from late May through early October), the 1885 Tall Ship Wavertree (visitors can explore on self guided tours), and the 1908 lightship Ambrose (guided tours included in admissions).\n\nThe museum’s collection includes close to 80,000 pieces of art and artifacts documenting the nautical history of New York City as a major port in America. Rotating exhibits showcase items from the collections in an exhibition space located on Fulton Street. Be sure to walk around the corner to Water Street to check out the 19th century style Bowne & Co. Stationers, one of the oldest printing firms in America. The shop opened in 1975, the Bicentennial of the Bowne & Co company, in a location that was ideal for the busy maritime industries, which needed printed materials for their businesses.\n\nThe museum campus is a wonderful way to learn about New York’s thriving maritime history. Be sure to check the weekly programs and family friendly activities as well as special themed events throughout the popular spring, summer, and fall seasons.\n\nTravel Tips:\n\nThe museum and access to the ships are open Wednesdays through Sunday from 11am-5pm, with pay what you wish admission fees. Admission includes the museum, Wavertree, and Ambrose.\n\nWe parked just around the corner from the museum in an outdoor lot on Pearl Street (Icon), but there are several lots on Front and Johns Streets; check here for more information on parking and public transportation.\n\nRestrooms are located inside the museum building.\n\nNote that the Wavertree and Ambrose are not handicap accessible. Access to both ships include walking up and down steep gangways and climbing up and down steep stairs to lower decks. Be sure to hold on to the toddler crew carefully on board the ships.\n\nThere are dozens of dining options in the Seaport– check here for a comprehensive list. We had a great, family friendly lunch at Malibu Farm.\n\nThe Seaport offers tons of seasonal activities and programs– check here for the calendar for the museum and here for the calendar for the Seaport. Families will enjoy special activities on the weekends, including on board Wavertree and Ambrose.\n\nPlan on a couple of hours to explore the museum exhibit, boats, and seaport area. Consider downloading the Bloomberg Connects app ahead of time, and use the guide while on site- there are tons of points with information throughout the campus.\n\nFive Things to Do throughout the Museum Campus:\n\nStart at the indoor museum gallery, located at 12 Fulton Street, where visitors also check in for admissions. Exhibits include the history of the Seaport and South Street and a comparison of first and third class passengers aboard ocean liners (and see some of the artifacts from the ships including dining menus). There is also a small gift kiosk and docents on site to help with exploring the campus.\n\nExplore the 1885 cargo ship Wavertree, docked on Pier 16 (across the street from the museum). Museum admission includes self guided tours of Wavertree, which was built in England in 1885. The Wavertree used for almost 25 years to transport jute between Scotland and Bangladesh before being damaged in a storm and used as a floating warehouse. It was then “saved” by a ship preservationist and purchased for the Seaport Museum in 1970. There are docents throughout the ship who provide historical anecdotes about the ship and its crew and explain how the ship operates. Visitors can climb down to the twin decks (used for storage and repair workshops) and the cargo hold (check out how long it is!), walk through the Forecastle (the crew’s quarters) and climb up to the Quarter Deck for great views of the harbor (and a chance to turn the ship’s wheel).\n\nWould you like to save this?\n\nWe'll email this post to you, so you can come back to it later.\n\nI agree to receive emails from Coast2CoastwithKids\n\nTake a 30 minute, guided tour of the Ambrose, also docked on Pier 16. Officially known as US Light Vessel #87, the Ambrose, named after John Ambrose, was built as a “floating lighthouse” to help guide ships from the Atlantic Ocean into the New York City Port. The Ambrose, in service from 1908 until 1932, had a crew of 14 that helped ships, some of which carried over six million immigrants into Ellis Island. The US Coast Guard donated the Ambrose to the Seaport Museum in 1968. While on board, visitors can learn about how the Capstan (used to lift heavy objects) works and ring the bell on the Main Deck, go inside the Wheelhouse (Pilot House) to spin the ship’s wheel, check out the Engine Room and learn about the diesel engine that was installed in the 1930s to make the ship more efficient, and sit in the Officers’ Quarters to plot a ship’s course on the maps. Note: the Ambrose is scheduled for restoration in 2025 and will be out of commission for most of the year.\n\nCheck out the Pearl Street Playground, located across the street from the entrance to the Seaport. There are climbing structures, slides, benches and a sand pit with toys.\n\nWatching a letterpress printing demonstration in the Bowne and Co. Stationers shop. Located on Water Street before the Seaport entrance, the print shop, also home to the museum gift emporium, has 30 presses in its collection and currently uses two for personalized stationery: a 1858 Columbia press and a 1901 Golding press. On the first Thursday of the month, the shop hosts a free Fresh Prints workshop, open to the public, and on the last Saturday of the month, the shop hosts a Print Your Own Stationery workshop (fee applies). Note: Visitors do not need museum admission to visit the Bowne and Co. Stationers shop.\n\nLeave time to explore other parts of the Seaport, including the Tin Building (tons of restaurants and shops), IPIC (for movies), weekly outdoor pop up markets, and various restaurants. Check the calendar for weekly programs and events.\n\nLooking for other adventures in the downtown Financial District?

Rockefeller appropriately used it as the namesake for the 1908 mansion he built 500 feet above sea level on the banks of the Hudson River. “JDR” Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil and widely considered one of the richest men in history, originally purchased 400 acres at the start of the twentieth century.\n\nKykuit was home to four generations of Rockefellers until JDR’s grandson Nelson, upon his death in 1979, left Kykuit to the National Trust for Historic Preservation instead of his own children. Now, the Historic Hudson Valley nonprofit coordinates public tours and the house remains as it was in 1979. We’ve been members of the HHV for a couple of years and enjoy exploring their properties and program. One of our most favorite fall traditions is the Great Jack O’Lantern Blaze at Van Cortlandt Manor. You can read about our adventures at the Blaze here.\n\nForsyth Nature Center and Park in Kingston New York\n\nWe’ve spent a lot of 2020 taking day trips to the western part of Connecticut and the Hudson Valley and Catskill areas of New York state. We have close friends that live near Utica New York and we recently met them in Kingston, New York. We were looking for an outdoor space and discovered the Forsyth Nature Center- the perfect spot to entertain the kids for a few hours and enjoy the outdoors.\n\nPlaying “I Spy” at the Colorado State Capitol\n\nVisiting about a state’s history is one of our favorite activities and whenever we’re in a capital city, we make time to tour the state Capitol complex. The buildings are architecturally beautiful and the guides are usually enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and engaging. To date, we have toured capitol buildings in Massachusetts, Rhode Island (#5), New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Arkansas (#6). On our summer 2021 road trip, we spent the day in Denver (we were in town primarily to see the Rockies) and made time for a tour of the Capitol.\n\nAt one time, Denver was the second largest city in the West (behind San Francisco) and was part of the Gold Rush of the 1860s. Originally, what is now considered the state of Colorado was part of the Kansas, Nebraska, Utah, and New Mexico territories. In 1861 Colorado was declared a territory and became the 38th state in America. At first, Colorado City and then Golden were declared state capitals until 1867 when Denver became the permanent state capital. Construction on the Capitol building started in 1886, was completed enough for the building to be occupied in 1893, and then fully operational in the early 1900s. The building was designed on an axis in the form of a Corinthian Cross and closely resembles the design of the Capitol in Washington, D.C.\n\n10 Gardens Kids Will Love at the Berkshire Botanical Garden\n\nOn a recent trip to the Berkshires, we made an impromptu stop on our way to the Berkshire Botanical Garden– and we’re so glad we did!
