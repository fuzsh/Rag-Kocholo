        "text": "The other Fraunces Tavern, possibly Mason's Arms, as it would have looked in 1777. Illustration engraved by Samuel Hollyer (1826-1919), title Fraunces' Tavern, N.Y.C., 1777. Published in 1905, in the Old New York, Views by S. Hollyer, Volume I.\n\nHollyer was possibly inspired by an older illustration, the same way he did with the View of the Bowling-Green, originally published in 1830, and the Canal in Heere Gracht, 1659, originally published in Valentine's Manual 1862. Many illustrations he engraved for his three volumes of Old New York were dated before his birth and based on older drawings.\n\nSamuel Fraunces owned a few taverns in New York. At least three of them were known as Fraunces' Tavern: Mason's Arms, Queen's Head and 49 Cortlandt Street. This should not be the Queenâs Head Tavern, the historic tavern owned by Samuel Fraunces at the corner of Dock Street (now Pearl St.) and Broad St. A similar drawing made by Robert Shaw (1859-1912) makes it even clearer, because this is not the kind of landscape that would be expected to be found in a tavern close to the docks and to the old Royal Exchange. In the 18th century, the old ports area of big cities were usually crowded, with almost no trees, as the view of New York in 1798 (on the right) shows.\n\nThe Plan of the City of New-York, surveyed in the winter of 1775 by John MontrÃ©sor, engraved by Peter Andrews, shows regularly spaced trees on both sides of Broadway, consistent with the trees in this Hollyer's illustration. This Plan does not represent trees on other streets, only in some parks."
