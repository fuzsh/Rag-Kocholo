        "text": "New York is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. The streets are alive from day until night and it’s quite true that the city never sleeps. Its iconic skyline is one of the most recognizable with impressive skyscrapers and historic landmarks and the age-old promise of the American Dream never feels too far away. New York City points of interest are too many to count on one hand but here are top 10 places to visit in New York. In no particular order, some of the best New York landmarks are:\n\nWilliamsburg Bridge\n\nWhile not as famous as its sister bridge, Brooklyn, the Williamsburg Bridge is a great option to avoid the crowds but still enjoy the same experience. Whether you rent a Citi bike and cycle over or take the pedestrian route, it’s a fun adventure leaving Manhattan to explore this hipster-friendly up and coming area that has fast become one of the most sought-after boroughs in Brooklyn. Williamsburg is full of quirky cafes and bars, independent boutiques, tattoo shops and vegan restaurants waiting to be found.\n\nTimes Square\n\nIt’s cliché, but Times Square has to be on the New York City points of interest list. It would be like visiting London and not seeing Buckingham Palace. Times Square is a vibrant, loud, bustling, exciting, overwhelming experience – a real sensory overload but that’s part of it. High story buildings loom overhead with dynamic digital advertisements, shop fronts are wide and beckoning with all manner of tourist souvenirs and you can find some of the city’s most famous Broadway shows, comedy venues and theatres a stone’s throw away.\n\nCentral Park\n\nMeasuring in at an impressive 843-acres, Central Park is an urban oasis amid the bustling streets of this vibrant city. Framed by skyscrapers and townhouses owned by some of the wealthiest names in the world, Central Park is one of the New York landmarks favoured by all. In the summer you’ll find visitors and locals alike relaxing with their picnics and idle rowers boating on the lake. Even in the winter you can go ice skating or enjoy a stroll through the snow-dusted paths with a hot drink. Whether you're strolling or cycling through - Central Park should be on everyone's must-visit list when in New York.\n\nHigh Line\n\nPerhaps one of the newest New York City points of interest: the High Line. Built along an old freight railway line, it’s a creative urban green space elevated above Manhattan’s West Side. It has become a wonderground for nature, art and design making it one of New York’s most unique cultural experiences. Take half a day and walk along the woodlands, stay a while at the sundeck and water feature, stop for lunch at the Chelsea Market food court and enjoy the buskers and artists along the way. There is also a programme of events held throughout the year such as performances, salsa dances and thought-provoking discussions and debates.\n\nTop of the Rock\n\nThe Empire State Building is one of the most iconic New York landmarks but rather than wait in line to get to the top like everyone else, head over to Rockefeller Plaza instead and up to the 360-degree Top of the Rock Observatory Deck to see it from a new perspective. At night the experience is especially breath-taking when the iconic New York skyline is illuminated so you can see the Empire State Building, as well as the Chrysler Building and even over to Times Square.\n\nWall Street’s Bull & Fearless Girl\n\nOtherwise known as the Charging Bull, Wall Street’s Bull is one of the many New York City points of interest to be found in Downtown Manhattan’s Financial District. How they managed to sneak a 3000kg bronze bull into the city is anyone’s guess, but thanks to its popularity it’s staying for good. Tip: catch the Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, who stares down the bull with hands on hips, before she is relocated in 2019.\n\nMOMA\n\nIf you have a few hours to spare, the Museum of Modern Art (known locally as the MOMA) is an endless display of visual treats that will inspire and also challenge with their range of diverse cultural, artistic, social and political offerings. The permanent exhibitions showcase world-famous pieces from renowned modern artists and there’s a sculpture garden with works by Picasso and Rodin, as well as an art-house cinema. Tip: make the most of the Free Fridays to save on the entry fee.\n\nStatue of Liberty\n\nThere aren’t many other New York landmarks that quite have the same wow-factor as the Statue of Liberty. A symbol in Hollywood films, a chance to get up close to this iconic statue in real life is on most people’s To Do list when planning a trip to New York. Lady Liberty offers unparalleled views of the city from a new vantage point, her crown, and on your way back it would be worth visiting the Liberty Island museum to learn more about her history and how she came to be here, all the way from France.\n\nApollo Theatre\n\nHead to the Harlem institution, the Apollo Theatre. It was here that Ella Fitzgerald debuted in 1934, in 1962 the venue catapulted the talented James Brown into households around the country and a mere two years later Jimi Hendrix won first prize at an Amateur Night. Now, you’ll find headliners like Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen on stage, but you can still attend the renowned Wednesday Amateur Night to witness some of the hottest up-and-coming talent emerging from the city, too.\n\nYankee Stadium"
