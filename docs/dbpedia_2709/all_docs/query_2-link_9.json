        "text": "New York City is a city known for constantly rebuilding itself, and despite the constant flurry of new construction each year, old, historic buildings remain incorporated into the city’s built fabric thanks to community-led preservation efforts and city landmarking laws. Lying amidst the towering skyscrapers and increasing number of chain stores, Manhattan hides several centuries-old gems: buildings dating back to the 1700s, many of them playing an important role in the American Revolution – from colonial taverns to actual farmhouses.\n\nBelow we explore the oldest buildings in Manhattan, listed from oldest to most recent:\n\n1. Fraunces Tavern, 54 Pearl Street (1719)\n\nHolding both the title of “Manhattan’s oldest building” and “New York’s oldest restaurant,” Fraunces Tavern played a crucial role in the American Revolution and even housed several federal offices afterwards. Located at the corner of Pearl and Broad Street, the legendary tavern now functions as both a museum (on the second and third floors) and an expansive restaurant (taking up the first floor)."
