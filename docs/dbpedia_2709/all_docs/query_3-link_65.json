        "text": "I’m one of those NYC moms who thinks it’s a waste not to take advantage of everything the city has to offer. My guide to entertaining teens in NYC is thoroughly comprehensive. We break activities down into categories of personality traits. You will quickly find things to do for your sporty kid, your bookworm kid or even your magic loving kid.\n\nAn afternoon with nothing to do is an opportunity to explore something new. We pay the premium to live in NYC, we might as well experience all the benefits too, right? Over the last 19 years we have done it all. From seeing Pinkalicious off broadway (5 times!) to glamping on Governors Island. With NYC as a teens playground, the opportunities are endless! Whether you live here or are visiting, you will return to this guide for entertaining teens in NYC again and again.\n\nOur NYC History\n\nI moved to New York City in 1995, young and newly single. At the time I was a volleyball player so my social life revolved around club games during the week and tournaments on weekends. I did the nightclub scene for a while, but tired of it pretty quickly.\n\nWhen I started dating my now husband, we mostly explored NYC through food. Each week we chose a theme and the goal was to find a restaurant that fit that theme every time we ate out – which was a lot! Themes included things like restaurants with a view, a specific type of cuisine (think Ethiopian or Australian) and restaurants with a fireplace. The challenge caused us to get out of our own neighborhood to explore other areas. We soon felt like we knew every nook and cranny of Manhattan.\n\nAfter we got married, we decided to raise our family in New York City. When the kids were new, we explored NYC by “playground hopping ” to lots of different neighborhoods. A typical Saturday would consist of an adventure to a playground in a neighborhood we had not yet explored. By the time they had grown out of their strollers, we had been to almost every playground on the island of Manhattan plus a few in Brooklyn. As they got to be school age, we tried to expose them to as many museums, art exhibits, performances, types of food, and people that we could.\n\nWhen they became teenagers, we had to rediscover a new way of seeing our city. We spent several years with our tweens (ages 8-12) finding unique things to do. Something that would give them just enough freedom to feel some level of independence but not get into trouble. As older teens, they have spent several years exploring NYC with their friends and have basically left us parents behind!\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to Entertaining Teens in NYC\n\nI’ve put our years of wisdom into this comprehensive guide to entertaining teens in NYC. While I tried to make it easy to find activities based upon interests, I recognize that teens don’t fit cleanly into just one category. Use these categories as a base to get started. Then mix and match ideas to create some New York moments your teen will guaranteed not soon forget. There is a printable PDF attached with checkable boxes at the bottom of the post!\n\nA few notes before you get started\n\nI started working on this comprehensive list of entertaining teens in NYC in March of 2020. Coronavirus caused so many terrific businesses to shut down permanently in our city. As of this publication (October 2021) everything is current and temporary closures are listed in red. Be sure to call and check before you go. Most events in NYC are open with limited capacity. Museums generally offer timed ticket entry now so be sure to buy tickets online before you go.\n\nMy recommendations are geared for the under 21 set. They can be enjoyed by teens alone or with their families. No drinking, drugs, or illicit activity is included.\n\nThis list is not limited to teenagers! There are plenty of ideas here that adults will enjoy as well. Even better if you and your teen enjoy them together. Get ready to conquer NYC with teens!\n\nIndex\n\n1) The Sporty Teen\n\n2) The Lover of Things that Go\n\n3) The Goth Teen\n\n4) The LGBTQ Teen\n\n5) The Instagram Fanatic\n\n6) The NYC History Buff\n\n7) The Bookworm\n\n8) The Comic Book Fan\n\n9) The Music Lover\n\n10) The Daredevil\n\n11) The Collector of Oddities\n\n12) The Theater Kid\n\n13) The Gamer\n\n14) The Sleuther\n\n15) The Fashionista\n\n16) The Artist\n\n17) The Film Critic\n\n18) The Science Geek\n\n19) The Dancer\n\n20) The Magic and Mystery Lover\n\n21) The Sweet Tooth\n\n22) The Design/Architecture Guru\n\nThe Sporty Teen in NYC\n\nThe popular:\n\nNo matter the time of year, you can always catch a game at one of NYC’s many great stadiums. Madison Square Garden is the home of the Knicks and the Rangers. The Barclay Center houses the Brooklyn Nets. If it’s baseball season, the Mets and the Yankees can provide a few hours of great family entertainment. All of these stadiums are just a subway ride away.\n\nFor the sporty teen, run don’t walk to Chelsea Piers on the west side highway between 18th and 23rd St. You will find a plethora of drop-in sporty activities for the whole family, including batting cages, golf, bowling and rock climbing. 11th Ave between 17th and 23rd Streets – Manhattan.\n\nOff the beaten path:\n\nCombine an afternoon in the Flatiron district with a stop at Spin New York, a ping pong social club that welcomes kids and families before 9pm. While they take advance reservations, last minute walk-ins are ok too. 48 E. 23rd Street – Flatiron\n\nSome lively and competitive family fun games can be had at Area 53 in Dumbo, Brooklyn. Laser tag is one of our favorite family activities when we travel with teens. Combine it with a tour of the Dumbo waterfront for some serious instagram moments. 53 Bridge Street – Dumbo\n\nNYC is serious about skateboarding and there are plenty of skate parks to catch some air. Pier 62 near Chelsea Piers is pretty rad and overlooks the Hudson River. The LES skatepark (Coleman playground) is a classic. It can be combined with a stop for dumplings or dim sum in Chinatown. Highbridge Skate Park in Washington Heights is the largest skatepark. If your teen is in NYC without their board, Skate Brooklyn has a ramp that is free to try out. 4th Ave and Saint Marks Place.- East Village\n\nDuring the summer months, free kayaking can be had in many places along the water. We like Hudson River Park at Pier 96 in Manhattan or in Brooklyn Bridge Park at Pier 4 in Brooklyn.\n\nBrooklyn’s Gowanus neighborhood is a mecca for sports oriented teens in NYC. During one afternoon, you and your teen can rock climb at Brooklyn Boulders, or workout at Crossfit (drop-in classes). For something a little more unusual, try the super cool Axe throwing joint right across the street. Lastly, Gotham Archery is just a few blocks away on Baltic. Kids under 18 need an adult present for Axe throwing and Archery. De Graw Street between 3rd and 4th Ave., Brooklyn\n\nLover of Things That Go\n\nThe popular\n\nThere is nothing like viewing the island of Manhattan from the water but Circle Line cruises can get expensive. Gawk at the skyline and Lady Liberty for FREE on a round trip on the Staten Island Ferry. Note: you have to disembark in Staten Island and reboard through the waiting room. Ferry runs 24/7 generally every 15 min\n\nWe love the Double Decker Tour Bus for families and teens on a lazy Saturday in NYC. Whether you are a long time resident or just visiting, guaranteed you will learn more than a few random facts about NYC.\n\nNY Transit Museum – this decommissioned subway station in downtown Brooklyn is a must no matter what borough you are in. I love the first hand view of how the NYC subway system was created. Also, how it has dealt with a myriad of challenges such as 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. The best part is a look at subway cars from the early 1900’s to today. Your teen will love reading the advertisements from that time. Bonus if you bring a parent/grandparent that remembers some of the ads! Open Friday – Sunday. 99 Schermerhorn Street – Downtown Brooklyn.\n\nOff the beaten path\n\nCity Hall’s Secret Subway Station can be found at the end of the downtown 6 local train. It has been out of service since the 1940’s. The conductors usually allow you to stay on the train after the last stop at Brooklyn Bridge City Hall . Watch as the train does a loop through that secret station to turn around and head back uptown.\n\nSpend a night at the TWA Hotel at JFK airport and watch the planes come in. Opened in May 2019, the TWA Hotel was created out of the abandoned and landmarked TWA Flight Center. Complete with a rooftop pool, a cocktail lounge created out of a 1958 airplane, and floor to ceiling noise proof windows in your room. You and your transportation loving teen will not soon forget a night watching the planes fly in and out in this 1960’s inspired hotel. JFK Airport, Queens\n\nOr, try the Ride which delivers a unique take on the traditional bus tour. The bus is tricked out into theater style seating where the streets of NYC are the theater. Comedic tour guides put on a different show every day depending on the activity in the streets. 42nd & 8th Ave. Midtown Manhattan\n\nThe Goth Teen in NYC\n\nThe popular\n\nThe countercultural magnet of Manhattan has been the East Village for decades. Specifically, St. Marks Place on 8th St between 3rd Ave and Ave A. It was the home of hippies in the 60’s, punks in the 70’s and anarchists in the 80’s. and since has been a home for “anything goes”. While some may argue it has lost its edge, it remains an essential stop for the goth and/or punk teen in NYC.\n\nOnce the centerpiece of St. Marks Place, Trash and Vaudeville moved its location to E. 7th St. near 1st Ave in 2016 but remains the punk clothing mecca of NYC and a must stop for the Goth Teen.\n\nOff the beaten path\n\nPay homage to Joey Ramone Place at 325 Bowery.\n\nTry this Punks and Poets walk and audio guide through the village, tracing the birth of punk.\n\nIf you’ve already explored the East Village and want more punk, head over to the Bushwick flea markets Punk Alley. Housed in shipping containers on 861 Broadway in Bushwick, you will find a handful of shops carrying punk junk and rarities. Plus, its the home of KPISS, Bushwick’s punk radio station.\n\nLearn about the death and mourning rituals of many Brooklyn neighborhoods on Madame Morbids Trolley Tour. 9th St and Driggs in Williamsburg\n\nHouse of Wax – quirky and a bit creepy this cabinet of curiosities is a family friendly bar located right outside the dine-in Alamo Drafthouse in downtown Brooklyn. Make a night of it, but note that the both locations allows kids under 18 only with a parent. 445 Albee Square – Downtown Brooklyn\n\nThe LGBTQ Teen in NYC\n\nThe popular\n\nGreenwich Village – the 1969 Stonewall Inn riots are widely considered to be the genesis of the modern day gay rights movement. A visit to NYC wouldn’t be complete without paying homage to this history in the Greenwich Village and the Stonewall Inn (note: Stonewall is a bar and strictly 21+ – but a photo outside is required for the LGBTQ teen). See this post about the 17 LGBTQ landmarks for a more complete Greenwich Village tour. 53 Christopher St. – Greenwich Village\n\nOne of the largest pride marches in the world can be found in NYC at Pride. All of NYC celebrates this fun and interactive event. It takes place the last two weeks of June culminating in the Pride Parade the last Sunday in June.\n\nOff the beaten path\n\nLocated on the lower East Side, Bluestocking Bookstore, Cafe and Activist Center features over 6,000 titles. All are based on feminism, queer and gender studies as well as climate/environment and race and black studies. They also have a robust calendar of activities. 116 Suffolk Street – Lower East Side\n\nThe Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art, located in Soho on Wooster St. was built by its founders to preserve LGBTQ identity and examines the intersection between art and social justice. 26 Wooster St. – Soho\n\nEvery September, the Brooklyn Museum hosts the Queer Fashion show featuring designers whose work is rooted in gender non-conformity.\n\nOne of NYC’s rites of passage is a Brunch or Dinner and a drag show at the famous Lucky Chengs. This is NYC’s longest running drag cabaret and is tons of fun. Recommended for ages 15+, but it’s up to the parent. 707 8th Ave. Greenwich Village\n\nThe Alice Austen House in Staten Island was designated as a National LGBTQ Historic Site in late 2017. Austen raised LGBTQ awareness in the early 1900’s through her photography. Some of her 8,000 photo collection, as well as exhibits showcasing modern photographers can be seen at her house. 2 Hylan Blvd. Staten Island\n\nThe Instagram Fanatic\n\nThe popular\n\nTake a free ride on the Staten Island ferry for spectacular water views of the Statue of Liberty and the NYC skyline.\n\nStroll over the Brooklyn Bridge to capture this majestic suspension bridge up close and personal.\n\nThe flatiron building is one of NYC’s most photographed landmarks. Combine it with a stop at Eataly or the very first Shake Shack. Madison Square Park, Flatiron\n\nFight the crowds trying to take some of the most memorable shots in Brooklyn bridge park in Dumbo. Don’t miss pebble beach and Jane’s Carousel along the waterfront. The view of the Empire State Building from Washington and Front Street has the most iconic shots. New Dock Street – Dumbo\n\nOff the beaten path\n\nThe Oculus is the World Trade Center transportation hub consisting of a train station, plaza, food and shops. Your instagram obsessed teen won’t want to miss a shot of this building. It is designed to look like a dove leaving a child’s hand. Be sure and see it from both outside and inside. Combine it with your tours of the 9/11 memorial.
