The following itinerary covers the most historical sites of Manhattan for you to visit on a NYC itinerary.\n\nDisclaimer: This post contains affiliate links. I may earn a commission at no cost to you!\n\nA Brief History of New York City\n\nNew York City officially became a settlement by the Dutch West India Company in 1624, named New Amsterdam. In 1664, the British captured New Amsterdam from the Dutch and renamed it New York. It then became a major port city and trading center.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, NYC served as a headquarters for the British military. Throughout the coming years, NYC rapidly developed and became a center for immigration and continued to be a major trading hub.\n\nThroughout the 1900s, NYC continued to develop and become industrialized as well as a hotbed for social and political movements. Present day, NYC continues to be one of the most iconic cities in the world.\n\nLooking for a good history book about NYC? Check out New York: The Novel by Edward Rutherford.\n\nBest Time to Visit NYC\n\nNew York City is such a fun place to visit any time of the year and each season has something special to offer.\n\nFall: In fall you can catch fall colors in Central Park, the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, and if you go in early fall -cheaper prices.\n\nWinter: I love NYC in wintertime, especially around the Holidays. The winter markets pop up as well as the entire city is decked out in Holiday decorations. There are also many ice skating rinks!\n\nSpring: Spring is another shoulder season for New York. Sometimes winter ends early and the weather is pleasant. Other years, you may still have snow. Thus, you can typically catch good deals in the Springtime.\n\nSummer: Summer is typically peak season for NYC but there are a ton of outdoor activities to partake in. July and August can get very hot and humid so keep that in mind.\n\nWhere to Stay in NYC\n\nTripAdvisor is a great place to start your hotel search. Search for the best New York hotels here!\n\nMy favorite area to stay in NYC is Midtown due to its central location to everything. You can typically find a good deal to stay in this area. I recommend anywhere between 34th Street and 60th Street.\n\nSome of my favorite hotels include:\n\nHampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central*\n\nHampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square South*\n\nHilton Times Square*\n\nNew York Marriott Marquis\n\nHilton Garden Inn New York/West 35th Street*\n\nHotel Edison\n\nVoco Times Square South*\n\nClub Quarters Hotel Times Square, New York\n\nAC Hotel by Marriott New York Downtown\n\nDoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown\n\n*Means my personal favorites!\n\nHow to Get Around NYC\n\nI love taking the subway to get around NYC. It is very easy to use and also affordable. Although Lyft, Uber, and Taxis are all always available, they can really add up. The subway makes it easy to get everywhere. You could also get a ticket for the Hop On Hop Off Bus.\n\nHow to Get to NYC\n\nNew York City has three major airports: John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), LaGuardia International Airport, and Newark International Airport. JFK usually has the cheapest flights and the most international flights. You can read more about how to get to a from the airports here.\n\nYou can also check out these transfers.\n\nShared Transfer to LaGuardia\n\nShared Transfer to Newark\n\nShared Transfer to JFK\n\nJFK Airport Private Transfer\n\nHistoric Sites in NYC Itinerary\n\nGoCity Pass\n\nGoCity offers a ton of different sightseeing passes for cities around the world. These passes allow you to visit the best of each city for one low price, rather than paying individually for each attraction.
