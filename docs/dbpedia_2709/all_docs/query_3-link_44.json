        "text": "• Explore New York City's history at the Tenement Museum. The Museum's two historical tenement buildings were home to an estimated 15,000 people between 1863 and 2011.\n\n• Stand in the footprints of General George Washington and his officers in Fraunces Tavern Museum. Standing on the corner of Pearl Street is the Fraunces Tavern Restaurant and Fraunces Tavern Museum, both preserved due to the historical significance. In 1783 George Washington and his officers attended a dinner in the Long Room on the second floor in Fraunces Tavern to celebrate the British evacuation (what would later become known as “Evacuation Day”) and the tearful goodbye of Washington to his closest confidants.\n\n• Gasp at the stunning Grand Central Terminal and be transported by its iconic architecture and interior design. Grand Central Terminal was designated a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior in 1967. The terminal features more platforms (44) than any other railroad station in the world and has played prominent roles in movies and television. More than just a transportation hub, it is also a shopping, dining, and cultural destination.\n\n• Visit Ellis Island. Nearly 12 million immigrants passed through Ellis Island on their way to New York City and the rest of the United States between 1892 to 1954. The Ellis Island Immigration Museum tells the story of many of these individuals and sheds light on their life after coming to America.\n\n• Tour the Statue of Liberty, a neoclassical sculpture that was gifted to the people of United States from the people of France. The copper statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886, and has since become an icon of the United States, as well as a symbol of freedom and a new life to the many immigrants who have arrived by sea.\n\n• Walk the High Line, a former New York Central Railroad spur that has been converted into a green space that is open to the public. The 1.45 mile long stretch of railroad track was used up until the 1980s when it was abandoned. Today the park sees millions of visitors every year.\n\n• Marvel at the grand architecture and impressive collections at the Morgan Library & Museum. The East Library features three levels of bookcases, some of which can only be accessed via balcony, as well as a stunning tapestry and a fireplace imported directly from Italy. The library was originally founded in 1906 as the personal library of financier J.P. Morgan, and was made into a public institution by Morgan’s son in accordance with his will."
