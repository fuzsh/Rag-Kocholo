        "text": "July 15, 2024\n\nWe don't always consider the powerful impact that the War of Independence had on the physical landscape of 18th century America – much less how those impacts might still be seen and felt today. Join Professor David C. Hsiung for fascinating insights into the lasting legacies of the Revolution on the natural world, including deforestation at Valley Forge, raids that seized animals but also produced some surprisingly \"positive\" effects, and lead musket balls left on battlefields that may only now be poisoning the land.\n\nThanks to the Paul Revere House for collaboration and promotion.\n\nJuly 8, 2024\n\nPerhaps no single day in US history was as threatening to the survival of the nation as August 24, 1814, when British forces captured Washington. This unique moment might have significantly altered the nation's path forward, but the event and the reasons why it happened are often forgotten. In this lecture, Dr. Robert Watson explores the British campaign and American missteps that led to the fall of the capital city, but also tells the redeeming stories of the courageous young clerks and the bold first lady who risked their lives to save priceless documents from the flames, including the Constitution. Join Dr. Watson for the shocking, behind-the-scenes story of the British attack on Washington and the rebuilding of the capital and nation.\n\nThanks to The Society of the Second War with Great Britain in the State of New York and The State of New York Society, United States Daughters of 1812 for co-sponsoring this event.\n\nJuly 4, 2024\n\nIt is a truism that Lower Manhattan has been America's town square since its founding in 1524, even though its history is much deeper. Virtually every aspect of global, local and national significance can be in some manner traced to this Downtown stage. Some have been forgotten and some have been transformative in our culture and many have fallen between. This is both a project in urban archaeology and a way of describing the city over time. It Happened Here captures the multiple and overlapping stories that are woven throughout our city's life. It embraces America's history as the museums, monuments and memorials that dot its streetscape do. It highlights many of the concerns, events, and places that the people who lived, fought, worked and visited here thought were important at their moment in time.\n\nThe July 4, 2024 program at Fraunces Tavern Museum was the fifth prequel event leading up to the United States’ upcoming 250th birthday and a 4-day It Happened Here celebration the weekend of July 4, 2025. This year's event included speakers on the following topics: Lower Manhattan: The Most Historic Spot in the Unites States; Upcoming Anniversaries: United States's 250th and New York's 400th; Fraunces Tavern: Its Revolutionary Story; The Promise of Liberty: An Authentic Originalism; Lafayette: A Hero's Return - Commemorating the 200th Anniversary of Marquis de Lafayette's Grand Tour of the United States in 1824; First Reading of the Declaration of Independence in New York and the Destruction of the Statue of King George III.*\n\nWatch the video on YouTube.\n\nMay 13, 2024\n\nWhat did “the pursuit of happiness” mean to our nation’s founders and how did that famous phrase become the foundation of our democracy?\n\nThe Declaration of Independence identifies “the pursuit of happiness” as one of our unalienable rights, along with life and liberty. In his new book, National Constitution Center President and CEO Jeffrey Rosen profiles six of the most influential founders—Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton—to show what pursuing happiness meant in their lives.\n\nIn this lecture Rosen not only elucidates the meaning of the Declaration’s famous phrase, but also takes us on a revelatory journey into the minds of the Founders, providing a deep, rich and fresh understanding of the foundation of our democracy.\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\nMartha Washington’s worst memory was the death of her husband. Her second worst was Thomas Jefferson’s awkward visit to pay his respects subsequently. Indeed, by the time George Washington had died in 1799, the two founders were estranged. But that estrangement has obscured the fact that for most of their thirty-year acquaintance they enjoyed a productive relationship. In this lecture, Francis D. Cogliano considers the significance of one of the most important but understudied personal relationships of the founding era: the connection between George Washington and Thomas Jefferson that spanned three turbulent decades.\n\nJanuary 22, 2024\n\nOn Monday, January 22, 2024, SRNY commemorated the birthday of Frederick Samuel Tallmadge, the second President of the Sons of the Revolution℠ in the State of New York, Inc., whose generosity enabled the Society to acquire Fraunces Tavern in 1904.\n\nOur featured speaker was Eric Schnitzer, co-author of a recent book, Campaign to Saratoga - 1777. This book was created jointly by master historical painter Don Troiani and Eric Schnitzer, who is an historian. Mr. Schnitzer also serves as an interpretive ranger at the Saratoga National Historical Park.\n\nNovember 16, 2023\n\n1775 belonged to Boston but after April of 1776, the Revolutionary War's focus became New York City and the highly strategic Long Island, from Brooklyn's terminal moraine high ground to Queens's Hell Gate. 1776 was the year when revolution came to Long Island, and in particular the future Long Island City. The failures, defeats and eventual occupation of the area at the hands of the British forged the resolve and strength of character that would later ensure Patriot victories on distant battlegrounds throughout the rest of the colonies. The British did not evacuate western Queens County until November of 1783, but the events of 1776 would not soon be forgotten during the seven long years of occupation afterword. Join author Richard Melnick as he charts the military, political and cultural history 1776 in Long Island City.\n\nOctober 26, 2023\n\nWhen John Hancock needed to win people over, he didn’t talk about resisting taxes or policy improvements; instead, he served alcohol. He offered rum punch and wine at his home and paid for lavish meals in taverns to bring people together. Guests included lower class men, French officers, and Black women and men. By throwing parties, Hancock gained social and political power among myriad groups, which repeatedly paid dividends. He was consistently elected to political office and when he smuggled madeira into Boston, one of the most memorable and violent mobs during colonial resistance defended him.\n\nIn this forty-five-minute talk, Brooke Barbier discusses an oft-ignored aspect of colonial life: the high rate of alcohol consumption. Listen to lively and evocative stories that illuminate the critical and complex role that alcohol played in the social, political, and cultural fabric of the American Revolution and how John Hancock used it to his advantage.\n\nJuly 4, 2023\n\nIt is a truism that Lower Manhattan has been America’s town square since its founding in 1524, even though its history is much deeper. Virtually every aspect of global, local and national significance can be in some manner traced to this Downtown stage. Some have been forgotten and some have been transformative in our culture and many have fallen between. It Happened Here captures the multiple and overlapping stories that are woven throughout our city’s life. It embraces America’s history as the museums, monuments and memorials that dot its streetscape do. It highlights many of the concerns, events and places that the people who lived, fought, worked and visited here thought were important at their moment in time. The July 4, 2023 program at Fraunces Tavern Museum was the first of many prequels to the United States’ upcoming 250th birthday and a 4-day It Happened Here celebration the weekend of July 4, 2025 and included speakers on the following topics: Fraunces Tavern: Its Revolutionary Story; The Birch Trials at Fraunces Tavern; the New York City Revolutionary Trail by The Gotham Center for New York City History; George Washington’s First Command; Alexander Hamilton; Revolutionary Forebears; It Happened Here.\n\nWatch the video on YouTube.\n\nMay 18, 2023\n\nOn September 21, 1776, five days after the British occupied New York City, a devastating fire burned down about a fifth of the city. This mystery brings together a startling cast of characters from around the Atlantic World: soldiers and officers, but also Loyalists, women, and people of African and Indigenous descent.\n\nFraunces Tavern Museum hosts the New York Genealogical & Biographical Society and author Benjamin L. Carp to explore these themes in the context of his new book, The Great New York Fire of 1776: A Lost Story of the American Revolution.\n\nThis lecture was sponsored by the New York Genealogical & Biographical Society.\n\nApril 3, 2023\n\nBetween 1776 and 1783, Great Britain hired more than thirty thousand German soldiers to fight in its war against the American rebels. Collectively known as Hessians, the soldiers and accompanying civilians, including hundreds of women and children, spent extended periods of time in locations as dispersed and varied as Canada in the North and West Florida in the South. In this presentation, Friederike Baer highlights some of the key experiences of these participants in a war on a distant continent against a people that had done them no harm.\n\nJanuary 23, 2023\n\nOn Monday, January 23, 2023, SRNY commemorated the birthday of Frederick Samuel Tallmadge, the second President of the Sons of the Revolution℠ in the State of New York, Inc., whose generosity enabled the Society to acquire Fraunces Tavern in 1904. Our speaker was Alyssa Loorya, Ph.D., RPA, founder and president of Chrysalis Archaeological Consultants, who received her Ph.D. in 2018 from the CUNY Graduate Center. Chrysalis Archaeological Consultants is a cultural resource management company in New York City that researches, excavates, and analyzes sites to assess their historical or archaeological impact. Since opening in 2001, the company has worked on hundreds of projects, including some which uncovered artifacts relating to the Revolutionary War. Alyssa presented “Revolutionary New York: An Archaeological Perspective”.\n\nNovember 10, 2022\n\nThere is always something new to be found in America’s past that also brings greater clarity to our present and the future we choose to make as a nation. In this lecture, Adam Van Doren explores well-known and lesser-known historic sites in the 13 original North American colonies, accompanied by his paintings.\n\nFrom the Bunker Hill monument in Massachusetts to the Camden Battlefield Site in South Carolina, this is a tour of an American cultural landscape with a curious, perceptive, and insightful guide.\n\nAugust 11, 2022\n\nIn this lecture, David Gellman explores the contradictions of the Jay family’s attitudes toward slavery over multiple generations. Enslaved and formerly enslaved people living in Jay households experienced isolation, even as members of the Jay family took increasingly radical approaches to law, policy, politics, and advocacy, culminating in John Jay’s signing of An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery in 1799 as Governor of New York, which helped bring about the emancipation of enslaved people in New York in 1827. Gellman aims to bring new light and a fresh understanding of the Founder’s legacy.\n\nApril 28, 2022\n\nIn this lecture, Thomas Balcerski discusses New York City as the capital of the nation, beginning in 1785 under the Articles of Confederation Congress. Despite debates over whether the capital should be relocated, the first Congress determined to meet there in March 1789, and the first inauguration of an American President happened there in April of the same year. Balcerski reviews the many sites associated with the early capital, between 1785 and 1790, and considers their significance to later developments in the new government, as well as how the legacy of this important history has been largely forgotten today.\n\nJanuary 13, 2022\n\nIn this lecture, Norman Desmarais will discuss recent discoveries about the Count de Rochambeau’s army that counter popular assumptions—focusing primarily on the recently published diary of the Count de Lauberdière, which includes details that are not covered in any other French diaries. Serving as an aide-de-camp on General Rochambeau’s staff, the young and well-educated Lauberdière provided a unique perspective of the war, including descriptions of the French army’s camp in Newport, the long march to Yorktown, the siege and capture, and a fascinating examination of the people and their distinctive colonial culture.\n\nNovember 11, 2021\n\nIn this lecture, Nina Sankovitch will present the intimate connections between leading families of the American Revolution—the Hancock, Quincy, and Adams families—and explore the role played by such figures as John Hancock, John Adams and Abigail Smith (Adams), Josiah Quincy Junior and Dorothy Quincy (Hancock) in sparking the flames of dissent and rebellion that would lead to the Declaration of Independence in 1776. By focusing in on Braintree, Massachusetts and these three prominent families of the village, Sankovitch will demonstrate how the desire for independence cut across class lines, binding people together as they pursued commonly held goals of opportunity, liberty, and stability.\n\nAugust 19, 2021\n\nOn the stormy night of August 29, 1776, the Continental Army faced capture or annihilation after losing the Battle of Brooklyn. The fate of the Revolution rested upon the shoulders of the soldier-mariners from Marblehead, Massachusetts, who saved the army by navigating the treacherous waters of the river the Manhattan. White, Black, Hispanic, and Native American, this uniquely diverse group of soldiers set an inclusive standard the US Army would not reach again for more than 170 years. In this lecture, Patrick O’Donnell discusses how the Marbleheaders repeatedly altered the course of events during the Revolution—from forming the elite Guard that protected General Washington to ferrying Continental forces across the Delaware River on Christmas night of 1776.\n\nMarch 11, 2021\n\nIn this lecture, Johnson will explore how, in the midst of British military occupation, men and women from a variety of backgrounds navigated harsh conditions, mitigated threats to their families and livelihoods, took advantage of new opportunities, and balanced precariously between revolutionary and royal attempts to secure their allegiance. In so doing, Johnson argues that these people and their experiences shaped the course of the Revolution, gradually discrediting Britain’s ability to govern the former colonies and rotting their attempts to restore order from the inside out.\n\nJanuary 21, 2021\n\nEveryone knows about the Revolutionary War, but few know of Benjamin Franklin's secret plan to turn the northern and southern colonies against their oppressors, and how the freeing of one enslaved man, Somersett, was the catalyst for the colonies to come together against the crown. In this lecture, Goodrich will discuss the little-known story behind the origins of the Revolutionary War and explains how several well-known but random events during the war culminated in the creation of the United States of America.\n\nOctober 2, 2020\n\nPreserving the Past is a digital lecture that takes a comprehensive look at the architecture, design, and history of 54 Pearl Street, one of the oldest buildings in New York City. Led by historian Mary Tsaltas-Ottomanelli, the lecture explores three hundred years of the building’s history – from its early construction on some of the city’s oldest landfill, to the extensive restoration in the 20th century, to how the building continues to survive surrounded by skyscrapers.\n\nThe lecture includes a brand new, exclusive look in the museum’s collection with Collections Manager Lisa Goulet who offers in depth descriptions/close ups of pieces from the Museum’s collection that are rarely shown to the public."
