All of these are mentioned in this post.\n\nGerlinde (and the 23 ‘likes’ her comment received) knows what many New Yorkers and visitors know -- that the New York Public Library is a fantastic place to visit, even if it isn't a museum!\n\nTwo lesser-known museums, but still worth checking out, came up in the group suggestions.\n\nThe Folk Art Museum is always free and all of the Morgan is free to visit on Fridays from 5 pm - 7 pm.\n\nThe always-free Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) museum came up several times.\n\nBesides the FIT Museum, Deborah also recommends the National Museum of the American Indian which is always free and is excellent.\n\nThese are just a handful of the many suggestions our Facebook Travel Tips group made.\n\nYou don't have to be a member to search the group for specific recommendations though you might like to join and post a question about free museums to see which ones you might enjoy!\n\nOTHER BUDGET TRAVEL TIPS\n\nFree Things to Do in NYC\n\nCheapest Time to Visit the Big Apple\n\nSave 55% on Tours + Attractions\n\nNYC on a Budget\n\n3 Days in NYC on a Budget\n\nHow Much Does NYC Cost to Visit?\n\nFree Things to Do with Kids\n\nShop at an Outlet Center\n\nTips for Inexpensive Shopping\n\nHow to Get Cheap Broadway Tickets\n\nAffordable Accommodations in NYC\n\n25 Cheapest Hotels in NYC\n\nCheap Airfare to NYC\n\nCheap Eats\n\nLearn how to use the NYC Subway and which MetroCard to buy."
