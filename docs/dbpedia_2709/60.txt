Nestled in the heart of New York's financial district, the historic 18th century Fraunces Tavern, along with four adjacent 19th century buildings, houses a fine museum that is dedicated to the study and interpretation of early American history and culture.

When New York was the Capital City, Fraunces Tavern housed the Departments of Foreign Affairs, the Treasury, and War, from 1785 to 1787. George Washington delivered his famous farewell to his officers here.

Today the Museum offers changing exhibitions, such as the former title, The Changing Image of George Washington and Wall Street: Changing Fortunes. Each exhibition focuses on some unique aspect of American history, delivering a presentation that shows us our past as we have not seen it before.

Among the period room displays, is the Long Room, the site of Washington's Farewell Address. This and other rooms give us a glimpse of what life must have been like in those exciting times.

Tours and public programs, such as lectures and performances, coordinated with the current exhibition, make this Museum complete..

Special events are held on Washington's Birthday and Independence Day.

School Programs consist of thematic Guided Tours that last one hour and fifteen minutes. One of the themes is Taverns as Centers of 18th Century American Life (grades 3 - 8): From meeting place, to post office, to entertainment center, taverns played an important part in society in the 18th century. This program invites a lot of group participation to explore this interesting phenomenon. Guided Tours include pre- and post-visit materials.

Other exciting programs are offered for grades 7 through adult.

Self-Guided Tours may also be taken by high school and college groups. Elementary groups must have a guide.

This is a great museum, housed in a building rich in American history. Just about everyone will enjoy and learn from it.
