        "text": "Changing Capitals in Central Luzon. The Index Guide for Travelers in the Philippine Islands, first printed in 1885, identifies the town of Bulacan, now spelled as Bulakan (23) as the seat of the Province of Bulacan. Malolos (18) became the provincial capital in 1901 and it became a city 98 years later. The Index Guide also names Bacolor (121) as the capital of Pampanga, a distinction it held on to until 1904 when the seat of the provincial government transferred to San Fernando (15), which became a city in 2001. Meanwhile, San Isidro (4) remained the provincial capital of Nueva Ecija until 1912 when it was moved to Cabanatuan (259) which became a city in 1950. But 15 years later, a new capital was formed with the creation of Palayan City (258).\n\nTotal Recall. This article is on the first 23 towns and cities in my quest to visit all of the PH. For some reason, I always look back on the first three days of my attempt to see all of 1,634 PH towns and cities. From March 27-29 in 2013, I visited a total of 21 towns and two cities in the provinces of Bulacan, Nueva Ecija and Pampanga, the first three provinces. I took some time in March and April 2016 to revisit these places. A handful of these towns, plus San Fernando City (15), were part of the itinerary for the Maundy Thursday Visita Iglesia with friends last March 25.\n\nThese three provinces are among the first eight that violently shook off the heavy yoke of Spanish rule more than 120 years ago— distinctions represented in the national flag by the eight rays of the sun. With its centuries-old parishes, they are also the elite cornerstone of Roman Catholicism in Central Luzon, established by exacting a heavy toll on its society and economy under Spain. It became both the hotbeds of rebellion and war against the Spanish crown, and later against the military might of United States in the 1900s. It became one of spheres of insurgency by the Hukbalahap against capitalism more than 40 years later. The 23 towns and cities are part of the expansive Pampanga River Basin, a thriving heartland of a rice economy with shifting political boundaries but one that has been supplying the needs of Manila for centuries.\n\nOf intertwined origins\n\nDuring family trips to Cagayan in the 1970s and 1980s and the guided tours to Banawe (721) in the 1990s, I often just passed through San Ildefonso (1), located along the Maharlika or Pan-Philippine Highway on the northern part of Bulacan. I had nary a thought for its history or attractions, if it had any. It was just one of the towns en route between Metro Manila and North Luzon. What I always knew is that the town is famous for its production of chicharon or pork cracklings and sweets made from tamarind and from macapuno (coconut sport). These products make their way throughout Luzon and are often sold by peddlers who board buses passing through the town.\n\nThe rice producing municipality had undergone various name changes. Named during the pre-Hispanic times as Bulak after the kapok or Ceiba pentandra trees that once proliferated in the area, it was governed from nearby San Rafael (66) during the Spanish era. Most sources acknowledge the town’s year of founding at 1885, and at the church’s premises is a marker celebrating its 100th anniversary. Renamed in the 1870s in honor of Spanish King Alfonso XII, San Ildefonso is however more popularly known to be named after its patron saint, the 6th century Visigoth theologian Saint Ildefonsus of Toledo. Bulak is still used to refer to the Poblacion area. The name appears in the signboards of jeepneys plying between San Miguel to Baliwag (67), a main transport hub between northern and southern Bulacan.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Bahay na Pula became the set for horror films or macabre-themed television programs. Featured on television about its past, it became a magnet for ghost hunters and people into Dark Tourism. But whatever historical or architectural value and attractive pull the Ilusorio Mansion had, all these failed to translate into effective efforts to preserve it. Some 70 years after the end of World War II, the windows and walls of the former garrison’s upper floors are missing, with just the roof house posts remaining. I have read blogs saying that the house is in the process of being relocated to the ostentatious Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar in Bagac (349) in Bataan where architectural jewels like it have become part of a privately-owned museum of fully restored period houses. It is heartbreaking to see its colorful Machuca tiles and red and white crazy cut steps broken into pieces. If they were really going to have it transferred, the method being used appears to be heartless. I deeply regret not stopping to see it while it was still intact in 2013, but even if the house is no longer there in the coming years, the space where it stands remains sacred ground.\n\nAncestral homes are also part of the landscape in San Miguel (2), located just 12 km north of San Ildefonso. The opening of the railway to Nueva Ecija and the introduction of mechanized rice threshers further contributed to the affluence of San Miguel’s elite and landowning families who have built their palatial bahay na bato on peasant blood. While most of these period houses are not open to the public, their exteriors testify to the fortune of San Miguel’s landed elites who have built their fortunes starting in the late 1880s through supplying Manila with rice and other foodstuffs.\n\nAmong the many names that continue to resonate along Rizal Street is that of Pelagio de Leon, whose descendants still own three large houses. In only one were we allowed to take photographs. The kind lady who briefly chatted with us said that the owners of the other de Leon houses shunned visitors. The main house owned by Pelagio de Leon boasts of an NHI marker identifying it as the birthplace of Sen. Ceferino de Leon, one of the signatories to the Malolos Constitution. His daughter, Trinidad, married Manuel Roxas, who later became the 5th PH president, the last under the Commonwealth and the first under a post-war, independent republic. It was no wonder ubiquitous campaign posters of 2016 Presidential Candidate Manuel “Mar” Roxas II were hanging above the front door of Pelagio de Leon’s ancestral house. Political posters also hung on the iron fences of another de Leon ancestral house, the one that belonged to film producer and star maker of the 1950s Doña Narcisa “Sisang” Buencamino de Leon.\n\nOne of the largest houses on Rizal Street, belonging to Gen. Simon Tecson, once hosted Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. At its gate is a marker of the NHI describing in Filipino the life of general and his involvement in the Philippine Revolution and the Philippine-American War. In 1901, the 40-year old Gen. Tecson, unlike his one-time distinguished guest and commander, the 32-year old Aguinaldo, preferred exile to Guam than to acknowledge American rule. He returned to the PH in 1902 only to die a year later at the age of 42. Meanwhile Aguinaldo acquiesced with US authorities, ran against Quezon in 1935 and lost, and lived to the age of 94, dying of coronary thrombosis in 1962.\n\nSome historians and the general’s descendants place the Tecson ancestral home as location of the signing of the 1897 Pact of Biak na Bato. This account says that this truce between the revolutionaries and Spanish authorities was not signed, as commonly believed, in the cave complexes to the east, declared as a national park in 1937 by Pres. Quezon. Located near the Balaong River in the Sierra Madres, only a fraction of the hundred caves are open to visitors at the Biak na Bato National Park, which extends to parts of San Ildefonso and Doña Remedios Trinidad (63). Having heard of it from my high school history teacher many times, I have always wanted to go to this national park, which was unfortunately closed for renovation during the time of my visit in March 2016. However, I was allowed only to go as far as the wooden hanging bridge spanning the Balaong.\n\nAfter seeing it only in photographs, I finally came face to face with the nearly forgotten monument that had a concrete anvil on top. A US-based secret society made by but later made distinct from the Masons, the Legionarios del Trabajo, or the Legionnaires of Labor, built the monument in 1924. The weathered marble inscription read in Spanish that it was built to commemorate the signing at the area of the Pact of Biak na Bato, a treaty that was never faithfully implemented by the Filipino revolutionaries and the Spanish authorities. Forgotten names spoke in crumbling silence, from the chipped marble plaques peppered with graffiti and some barely readable. A couple of steps away stood another forlorn reminder of the great historical value of the park. Erected in 1973 by the NHI, it commemorated the establishment in the vicinity of the short-lived Republic of Biak na Bato on May 31, 1897 and the promulgation of its constitution in November of the same year.\n\nOf towns origins, parish and church histories\n\nJust like their neighbors to the south, the tagá-ilog later called Tagalog, the pangpangans later called Kapampangan resided along the banks of the life-rich rivers whose waters originate from the Cabusilan Mountain Ranges in the west and the Sierra Madre Mountains in the northeast. Ancient settlements like Lubao (13) and Candawe, now Candaba (7), and Masicu, now Mexico (117) have already established strong trade links with China and other states. Their wealth attracted the Spanish and they were among the first kingdoms in Luzon to be subjugated under their rule and brought to Roman Catholicism. Betis, now part of Guagua and formerly of Lubao until 1904, was the among first to fall to the Spanish who were aided by the firstborn son of Rajah Lakandula.\n\nThree months after the fall of Manila to Miguel Lopez de Legazpi in June 1571 and the subsequent defeat in the same month of a naval force led by Bambalito or Tarik Sulayman of Macabebe (11) in the Bangkusay Channel near Tondo, the Spanish moved to conquer what they would call the Provincia de Pampanga. On the Feast Day of the Triumph of the Cross or Sept. 14, Maestro de Campo Martin de Goiti with soldiers led by Lt. Antonio Carvajal invaded Lubao (13). Rather than sharing the same fate as the Macabebe leader Bambalito and those of Betis, Datu Macabulus submitted to the Spanish. I admit never to have heard of Datu Macabulus or of Tarik Sulayman, described in his memorial in front of the municipio as a brave young man and the first Filipino martyr for freedom.\n\nThe Augustinians did not waste time in converting the people into Catholicism. Macabulus is said to be among Lubao’s one first converts to Christianity, but other accounts state that Macabulos remained steadfast to Islam and moved north to the Tarlac area. Oral history nonetheless strongly links the datu to the devotion to black wooden cross which he supposedly received from Goiti but buried it before leaving Lubao. But the cross, revered as the Apu Santo Cristo, was recovered in the 17th century and has since been enshrined at the Holy Cross Parish, Brgy. Sta. Cruz, also in Lubao. It was carbon-dated to be 400 years old, the same age when Catholicism had set foot in the Pampanga River Basin.\n\nIn a span of more than 315 years from 1571 to 1893, the Spanish founded 23 parishes distributed in what would become Pampanga’s three cities and 19 municipalities. One of these is located in San Fernando City (15), two are in Guagua (12) and the rest are located in each of the nine other municipalities that I visited in the last days of March 2013. It was my first time to see most of these towns, and I was astonished and inspired by the different churches of Pampanga and their respective narratives. The Spanish had the first churches of these parishes built using various materials, only to be destroyed later by war, earthquakes, floods and fires and then rebuilt, but not without much social and economic costs.\n\nThe founding of the towns in Pampanga are placed at the same year the parishes were established. Most of these were already populated and flourishing settlements even before the arrival of the Spanish. For example, with their parishes established from between 1571 to 1575, the towns of Lubao (13), Candaba (7) and Macabebe (11) are among the oldest in Pampanga. Lubao’s San Agustin Parish is acknowledged to be among the oldest in the province and in the Philippines. The church moved to its present site in Brgy. San Nicolas 1st in 1602 after the flooding of its original site in what is now Brgy. Santa Catalina.\n\nAlso located along the Pampanga River, Candaba (7) or Candawe to the Spanish, was founded in 1575 with the establishment of the San Andres Apostol Parish as a visita. Like Macabebe, it fell under the jurisdiction of Calumpit. Four years earlier, it became an encomienda of Alferez General Amador de Arriaran. Twenty years later it changed hands to Don Juan Ronquillo and Don Goncalo de Ballesteros. It was only in 1665 that construction of the stone church began under Father Jose de la Cruz, and was completed within four years.\n\nLike Guagua, it had a Chinese population that was attracted to the trade links the town had with San Miguel de Mayumo (now San Miguel) and Baliwag (now spelled as Baliuag). In 1784, 200 Chinese Christians resettled in the Pinac de Candaba or the Candaba Swamp. At the Candaba Parish Museum, I saw a copy of a 1784 petition of the Sangleys, who contributed much to the town’s socio-economic life. At the main door of the San Agustin Parish Church, I saw the three tombstones, all with fading Chinese characters identified by local historians as Jose Tecson, the same surname with the Katipunero general from San Miguel. Along Rizal Street, I visited a large house dating from the 1930s and a nearby old stone structure being used as a grains and milling facility, belonging to a family with Chinese ancestry.\n\nOf an indomitable and unsinkable faith\n\nAs centuries-old bastions of devotion to the Catholic Church, each of the parishes I visited continue to serve as religious and community centers, the hearts of feasts and the town fiestas. In my visits during Holy Week to the San Agustin Parish in Lubao in 2013 and 2016, and to the San Pedro Apostol in Apalit (19) in 2013, I saw people preparing for the traditional procession of religious images. When I visited the Apalit Church in April 2016, there was a wedding taking place.\n\nFrom the side altar, I watched the couple exchange their vows. I felt happy for them, and wished them happiness and good health as the two are to start a journey of being together. I moved to the other end of the church, stepping on rose petals covering the center aisle. I continued watching the ceremony from beside a seated image of Saint Peter, the same one I saw looking at people preparing for the Lenten procession in 2013. Time seems to stop at the San Pedro Apostol Parish Church.\n\nEstablished in 1590, Apalit takes its name from the Kapampangan of the narra or the Pterocarpus indicus that proliferated in the area. An older church was destroyed in the 1863 quake and from 1876 to 1880, the construction of the present church began, headed by Mariano Santos of Guagua under the supervision of Rev. Antonio Redondo. Following the initial plans of Don Ramon Hermosa, the construction of the church took seven years, with its inauguration in June 1883. A few years later, Rev. Toribio Fanjul finished the additional towers which were made low to combat the effects of earthquakes.The latest addition to the church design were aluminium fonts of the parish name in English placed above the arch, which shone brightly under the sun.\n\nFrom the northbound Pampanga section of NLEX, I had always seen a large dome near the banks of a wide river. It turned out to be that of the Apalit Church. When I first visited it in 2013, I noticed the neglected NHI marker, but on my second visit, I saw that it had been repainted. What is interesting about the church is its interior decoration using trompe l’oeil. The ceiling murals depict scenes from the Bible, like the Noah’s ark and the temptation of Jesus Christ by Satan. The dome meanwhile presents an interpretation of the Apocalypse. While I was reminded of the San Agustin Church in Intramuros, the design of Apalit’s murals had a “folksy” feel. The paintings were done by Apalit artists under the direction of freelance scenographer Caesare Alberoni, who co-designed the San Agustin Church."
