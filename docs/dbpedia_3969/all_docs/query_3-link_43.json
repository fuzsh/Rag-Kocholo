        "text": "This church is the most prized architectural gem for those who reside in this Magical Town. It started out as a church devoted to St. Francis of Assisi, when Fray Martín de Jesús established the second oldest monastery in the west of New Spain. After a few years, the name was changed to San Andrés de Ajijic, and St. Andrew became the town’s patron saint, with celebrations held November 30th each year. There are few other churches in Mexico where you’ll also be able to hear a mass given in English."
