        "text": "4.4/5\n\nExcellent\n\nSSHUN1. The apartment is located in the ancient city, close to the Bisagra Gate. In the afternoon, I drove to the front of the apartment. The Spanish lady next door was very helpful and informed that the car could be parked for a period of time (resident parking spaces can be parked before 5 pm), and also informed that the front desk is in the building opposite to the apartment, which is a hotel front desk of the same name. deposit luggage). The front desk service is very enthusiastic. 2. For overnight parking, you need to go to a large parking lot three to four hundred meters ahead. The stamped parking fee of the hotel can be discounted about 13.5 euros a day. 3. The ancient city basically walks to visit various scenic spots. There are many restaurants nearby, and it’s even more lively when you walk up to the center of the ancient city. There is also a Carrefour supermarket three to four hundred meters away. 4. On the second day of the tour, I was stolen by similar immigrants with gifts, 30 Euro worth of children’s T-shirts and refrigerator stickers. I would have known that I would reveal my wealth earlier so that I would not let others go from the cathedral to the old bridge in regret. We are not happy anymore, well, it's worthwhile to train children to analyze the memories afterwards. 5. The room seems to have a little retro romance. It is not old and clean. We only need to go up three steps on the first floor and take the spiral staircase upstairs. The kitchen facilities are fairly complete, including a washing machine and refrigerator. The living room and dining room are also quite big. In the bedroom, the quilt on the bed is covered with blankets out of the bedspread. I don’t feel comfortable with the quilt. Let’s go for one night. The toilet is very large, and the electric water heater is like a large 100-liter tank, which is enough to take a shower.\n\nShow More\n\n4.4/5\n\nExcellent\n\nAangrybirdaThe hotel staff were helpful . We were given a room on the ground floor. The hall way in between the rooms are spacious . To our great surprise, despite the furniture inside the room were very old fashion , they were very clean and all the amenities in the bedroom and bathroom were very well designed and handy. We think this hotel must be a very expensive hotel in the good old days. The bath room and the bedroom was really spacious. The room was bright with lamp lights and the bed was comfortable. And we were lucky to be able to met some very helpful and polite spanish in the entrance hall of the hotel. The hotel was located on the the foot of the slopes leading to the tourist attractions uphills. We could easily find a free carpark around the hotel . We think this is the best hotel we had during our 16 days trip to Spain. It is really value for money. If we come back to Toledo, we will definitely choose this hotel again.\n\nShow More\n\n4.3/5\n\nExcellent\n\n欧欧The hotel is located in the center of the ancient city of Toledo. It is close to the bus station, commercial plaza and pedestrian street. We are driving, except for the narrow roads, it is easy to find! The facilities in the room can only be said to be normal, the room is relatively small, but it is very clean, the hotel front desk service is super enthusiasm, and I also burned boiling water for me to make instant noodles! The hotel has a cooperative parking lot. Now the small square at the entrance of the hotel is parked. After the check-in, you should go to the cooperative parking lot of about 200 meters, and then take the discount ticket at the front desk, 15 Euro / 24 hours! But the best thing I think is the hotel's breakfast, rich, delicious, freshly baked bread and ham slices, super delicious! The room we booked was more than RMB 500 a night, including breakfast, and it was very good value. The quality of the breakfast was not worse than that of other hotels that spent more than ten euros before! Overall, it is worth recommending!\n\nShow More\n\n4.1/5\n\nVery Good\n\nGGuest UserStayed for 3 nights in July 2022 with two children. The hotel is old, but mostly very good, clean and comfortable for the reasonable price of around 100 euros a night. Quite big pool area with a small pool for children. A lot of sunbeds and a bar that is open until afternoon. In the hotel there is a free-of-charge kids club (miniclub) with an employee playing with the kids, and 3+ year-olds can stay without parents. Open almost all day. Our children loved it, and often rather wanted to go there than play in the pool. The teacher is lovely and does all kinds of fun things with the kids. They were even given a diploma and a t-shirt after participation. The breakfast was very poor though and needs an immediate improvement. We had it one day, and can't recommend it for any price. Not many options , and food didnt seem fresh and was not tasty. Pastries didnt seem to be from the same day. Long queue to the coffee machine because 2 out of 3 machines were out of use.\n\nShow More"
