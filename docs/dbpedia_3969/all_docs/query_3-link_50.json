        "text": "Its origin is shared with two eighteenth-century chapels were erected on land outside the walls under the pastoral care of Bishop Lazo de la Vega: the Christ of Health and Guadalupe, the latter built of wood and thatched in 1716 , and rebuilt and enlarged by Bishop in 1738, designating the Greater Parish Assistant on December 24, 1739, under the title of Our Lady of Guadalupe and San Francisco Javier. The chapel was located in the alley between the alley Suspiro and Aguila Street.\n\n“The famous shrine of Our Lord Jesus Nazarene of Potosi, which is now the parish church of San Miguel del Padron, was before the year 1644, a chapel belonging to the mayorgazo of Captain Anton Recio, called at the time of Potosi, because it was founded on a hill. Don Martin Salcedo y Oquendo and his wife Juana Recio, dedicated it to the Lord and the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin, and provided for silver, jewels, vestments and a chaplaincy of three thousand dollars so that Mass could be said every Sunday\n\nand holidays.” **\n\nSan Miguel del Padron Church is located at Bernardo Posse # 20323 e/ Calzada de Güines y 3ª, Rpto. La Rosalia, San Miguel del Padrón, C. Habana.\n\nThese files were transcribed from a microfilmed copy found by one of our members. This church was closed and the books are now in San Miguel del Padron Church, La Habana.\n\n** Los Primeros Tres Historiadores de la Isla de Cuba, Tomo I, Dr. Rafael Cowley & D. Andres Pego, Editors\n\nOne of the oldest buildings in current San Miguel del Padrón. It has undergone many transformations, but its first location was in the hamlet that was to the south of the bay of Havana. It took its name from the “Ingenio San Miguel” and from the chapel with the invocation to the saint of the same name, although it hasn’t been determined at what moment it began to be called “del Padrón”.\n\nSan Miguel del Padron Church is located at Bernardo Posse # 20323 e/ Calzada de Güines y 3ª, Rpto.
