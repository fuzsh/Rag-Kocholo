        "text": "St. Andrew the Apostle was one of Jesus’ twelve Apostles. Scripture tells us that he was the brother of St. Peter, and it is thought that he was one of the Apostles who was closest to Jesus.\n\nLet’s use this novena to ask for his intercession, as we strive to grow closer to Christ ourselves!\n\nAbout St. Andrew the Apostle\n\nSt. Andrew the Apostle was born in the early first century A.D. in Bethsaida, which was a village on the Sea of Galilee. He was the older brother of Simon Peter and was also a fisherman.\n\nAccording to the Gospel of St. Matthew, Jesus called Andrew and Simon Peter when He saw them fishing as He walked along the Sea of Galilee. He asked them to follow Him and to become “fishers of men.”\n\nThe Gospel of St. Luke doesn’t explicitly describe St. Andrew’s calling. But it does hint that Andrew was present in the boat when Jesus used Peter’s boat to preach and then caused Peter to catch a huge amount of fish.\n\nThe Gospel of John describes St. Andrew’s calling a bit differently, saying that he was one of St. John the Baptist’s disciples. It says that St. Andrew decided to follow Christ after St. John the Baptist said of Jesus, “Behold, the Lamb of God.” (John 1:36).\n\nWhile the Scriptures do not tell us much more about St. Andrew, they do say that he was the Apostle who told Jesus about the boy with the loaves and fishes. They also say he was one of the Apostles present at the Last Supper.\n\nTradition tells us that, after Christ’s death, St. Andrew preached the Gospel in the area that is now Greece and Turkey, near the Black Sea.\n\nLike all the other Apostles (except for St. John), Andrew died as a martyr. St. Andrew died in Patras, where he was crucified. But like his brother, St. Peter, it is believed that Andrew requested to be crucified in a different manner than Christ was because he did not feel worthy to die in the way Jesus did.\n\nAndrew’s crucifixion was on an X-shaped cross (called a saltire). This X-shaped cross is often called “St. Andrew’s Cross” today. St. Andrew was bound to his cross, rather than nailed as Jesus was.\n\nSt. Andrew’s remains ended up in several places. Some sources say that St. Regulus moved parts of St. Andrew’s remains because he was told in a dream to bring them to the ends of the earth. It is said that St. Regulus had them with him when he was shipwrecked on the coast of Scotland, so he built a shrine to St. Andrew there.\n\nPope Paul VI had the relics of St. Andrew that were in Vatican City brought back to Patras. They are now kept in the Church of St. Andrew in Patras, along with the x-shaped cross he died on.\n\nSt. Andrew the Apostle’s Feast Day: November 30\n\nWhy Pray the Saint Andrew Novena?\n\nSt. Andrew is the patron saint of Scotland, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and Patras. Citizens of these countries can pray the St. Andrew Novena for his protection and intercession for their country.\n\nHe is also a patron saint of fishermen. You can ask for his prayers for help or protection in your own work as a fisherman, or for any fishermen you know. As Jesus told St. Andrew that he could be a fisher of men, you could also ask for St. Andrew’s intercession for your efforts in evangelization, or in following Jesus in your everyday life. St. Andrew is also a patron saint of singers. You can pray for his help if you are trying to establish a career as a singer, or for help if you are nervous about singing.\n\nYou can pray the St. Andrew Novena for any intention!"
