        "text": "San Andres Mixquic is the best place to experience Day of the Dead in Mexico as a tourist (here’s why).\n\nBefore you head off, though, there’s a few things you should know, from what to wear to how to get there!\n\nWhat to wear to Mixquic Day of the Dead\n\nWhile I saw a few locals dressed up Catrina-style in Mixquic, I did not see any costumed or painted foreigners. Most people were just dressed in regular streetwear.\n\nCheck the weather, but I would advise wearing long pants (or jeans), water-resistant boots or shoes (it can still be rainy in the end of October and beginning of November), bring a sweater or jacket, and consider bringing a waterproof poncho. Because the celebration is outdoors, if it rains, you’ll be left to the elements.\n\nI’ve got more suggestions on what to wear in Mexico City (and around) in this post.\n\nWhat to bring to Mixquic Day of the Dead\n\nIn addition to yourself and an open-minded attitude, you’ll want:\n\nUmbrella/packable rain jacket\n\nSmall-bill money for snacks, souvenirs, and donations\n\nA backpack or bag, especially if you plan on buying a lot of stuff\n\nCamera (my favorite mirrorless pick is also waterproof)\n\nTheft-proof purse (like this one)\n\nWhat to know about photography at Mixquic Day of the Dead\n\nIt’s totally acceptable and common practice to take photos of shrines, flowers, and the carnival-style booths.\n\nHowever, you should NOT photograph individuals without their permission (“Puedo tomar una photo?“), and you shouldn’t disturb families who are visiting grave sites.\n\nAvoid using flash as much as possible, especially when photographing people, and if you are going to use flash give a warning (if you’ve never been on the receiving end of a photo with flash in the dark, lucky you)\n\nWhat to eat at Mixquic Dia de Muertos / Day of the Dead\n\nThere’s an endless supply of sweets, treats, and snacks, in addition to little restaurants dotted around the main drag.\n\nWARNING: If you look like a foreigner and don’t speak Spanish like a Mexican, ask for the price before ordering. I’ve never been ripped off in Mexico until Mixquic. A friend ordered a small, typical dish that would usually run about 50 to 100 pesos (probably the low end, for this type of casual establishment), and was charged 500.\n\nHow to Visit Mixquic Day of the Dead\n\nThe easiest way to get to Mixquic is on a guided tour with Viator, but it’s not the only way.\n\nFrom Mexico City (or Puebla), you’ll need to drive to San Andres Mixquic.\n\nRENT A CAR: If you’re driving yourself, you’ll need to park a ways from the city, as parking fills up quickly, and you’ll want to park a ways from the city, as the roads are incredibly congested both before and after the main event.\n\nTAKE UBER: Uber runs from Mexico City to Mixquic, and also picks up in Mixquic to go back to Mexico City (though there’ll be a bit of a delay on the return trip with fewer drivers in the area). Easy peasy.\n\nHIRE A DRIVER: You can also hire a driver (through your hotel is the safest bet), and agree in advance what time he’ll return to pick you up. Around 10pm would be good, though celebrations go until the sun comes up.\n\nOnce in Mixquic, you want to head towards Mixquic Church, or Parroquia de San Andres Apóstol, as everything is organized around that point (including the cemetery and a stage for traditional dance performances). At some point, as you get near, you’ll pass by the carnivalesque stalls set up along the street, selling candies, snacks, souvenirs, and almost anything you can imagine.\n\nWhere to stay in Mexico City for Day of the Dead?\n\nAirbnb is a GREAT value in Mexico (I recommend homes near Chapultepec Park, Roma, and Condesa for the best location and safe neighborhoods in Mexico City). Never used an Airbnb? Now’s the time to start! Get $38 off your first stay with this link.\n\nAgoda also has a variety of price options (everything from budget dorms to high end hotels), and in a range of locations. Agoda runs flash deals, and you earn points towards free stays with every booking, so they are always my hotel aggregator of choice.\n\nWhat to do in Mexico City?\n\nAside from visiting Mixquic for Dia de Los Muertos, Mexico City has a TON to do, see and drink! Check out my ultimate guide here.\n\nWhat to wear and pack for Mexico City?\n\nI’ve got you covered in this end-all and be-all list!\n\nPin it for Later: How to Celebrate Day of the Dead in Mixquic, Mexico"
