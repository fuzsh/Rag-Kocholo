        "text": "The thought of putting up an ice skating rink seems unlikely in a tropical country like the Philippines. But on September 4, 1992, the first ice skating rink in country was opened to the public inside one of the largest malls in Asia.\n\nI had good memories when I had my self-thought lessons on ice skating. I was in grade school and it was only a few months since SM Megamall in Mandaluyong City opened its 849 square meters ice skating rink to the public. There were only a few daredevils who tried the unfamiliar recreational activity and my classmates and myself were one them.\n\nOn some weekends ,one of my classmate’s parents would take us there and let us stay initially for an hour until such time that we developed our skills gliding and keeping our balance on ice that we stayed for longer hours inside the rink.\n\nSoon ice skating became a popular alternative recreational activity in tropical Philippines especially during the summer months. In line with its popularity, ice skating rinks were opened in SM South Mall in Las Pinas, and Sta. Lucia East Mall in Marikina. But we were more at home with the one in SM Megamall.\n\nWith the growing number of ice skating enthusiasts, formal lessons on figure skating and ice hockey have been offered. The ice skating rink in Megamall became a venue for figure skating competitions and home to hockey teams like the Manila Ice Vixens.\n\nIn the years that followed, the ice skating rinks in Sta. Lucia and SM Southmall closed down leaving SM Megamall Ice Skating Rink as the Philippines’ first and the original ice skating rink.\n\n___________________\n\nToday, the recently opened ice skating rink in SM Mall of Asia is the latest and the largest.\n\nFor centuries, the Parian District of Cebu was home to the crème de la crème and founding families of the Queen City. Clustered in this historic district were the stoned-wall ground floor, wood-paneled second floor and tiled-roof ancestral houses. Sadly, only a few of these antique structures survive to this day or at least have been restored with their original configurations intact. One of them is the Yap-San Diego Ancestral House.\n\nRestoring ancestral houses to showcase Parian’s heritage is being well attended by those with extreme passion for heritage preservation like Val San Diego, whose battle cry let us all restore the glorious past of Parian! Committed to his vow, Val restored his ancestor’s 300 hundred year old ancestral house and converted it into a lifestyle museum to showcase his teeming collection of antiques.\n\nWe entered the quaint antique house through a low entrance along Mabini Street directly to the dimly lit silong. Initially, we thought of the place to be an antique shop selling their overflowing collection of chairs and furniture until we were met by Ray, the resident museum tour guide.\n\nRay traced the original owners of the 18th century house to Don Juan Yap, a Chinese merchant and Doña Maria Florido. In the 1880’s, their eldest daughter married Don Mariano San Diego of Obando, Bulacan. The house served as boarding house before it was handed over to choreographer and heritage advocate Val San Diego.\n\nThe antique pieces that made it into the house seem to have been chosen for their sense of romance including an ornately carved church pew from Dalaguete, reserved only for the use of the town’s principalia and a collection of native hats hanging on a bastonera evocative of those genteel times when Don Mariano San Diego would hang his tasseled ebony cane and salakot studded with beaten sliver after attending his affairs as Parian’s cabeza de barangay.\n\nWe were asked by Ray to wear shoe socks before climbing up the wooden stairs but we preferred to explore the second floor barefoot to feel the coolness and comfort of walking on the smooth old balayong floor.\n\nThe caida has a beautiful life-size statue of the Blessed Virgin flanked by a couple of angels. The tableau is surrounded by lagang or handmade flowers painstakingly carved from a certain type pearly white shell.\n\nWe first explored the left wing of the main living quarter where the comedor intended for daily use and the adjacent silid with an over-scale four-post Ah-tay bed are located. A slatted banggera or dish rack which many would imagine is located in the kitchen was traditionally installed on a dining room window. A six-seater dining set completes this room.\n\nThe whole right wing is occupied by the sala and beyond it is another comedor used only for special occassions. The entire length of the sala has wide windows opening to the main street below. In the olden days, chairs were placed beside the window to allow residents to watch the street scenes especially religious processions.\n\nThe glorious amount of sunlight in this spacious room provides illumination to the wall mural depicting the tiled-roof houses of the Old Parian as well as to the display of vintage bottles, antique porcelain, old santos and artworks that made us salivate to have them displayed in our own home.\n\nLooking up to the ceiling as we glide our way on the slippery old balayong floor to the next room, we wondered how the hard wood molave frame managed to hold the original tisa bricks, which we were told weighs about a kilo per brick. The second comedor has a dining table with a set of carnival glass.\n\nIt was common in the olden days to have two dining tables, one for daily use (and subject to wear and tear) and another (a more elaborate one) for special occassions. Beyond the comedor is the tea room which we imagined used for afternoon merienda. Three antique urnas each with santos watchover the round table and set of Bohol chairs and the sillon or birthing chair in one corner.\n\nFrom the tea room, we had a calming view of the jardin below with its Saint Francis statue and a couple of wooden bicycles.\n\nBefore leaving the house museum, we expressed our admiration to Val Sandiego for his effort in creatively putting together the artworks, old furniture and antique pieces to recreate the lifestyle of his ancestors and for generously showcasing his collection for more people to see, smell, touch, and learn from.\n\nIn a town blessed with progress and traumatized by horrific Ondoy, where signs of both God’s provisions and the impending wrath of nature are ever present, religious devotion runs deep.\n\nOn days culminating the Lenten season, the townspeople of San Mateo Rizal are accustomed to participate in the various Holy Week Activities, whether to continue a family tradition or as an intense personal devotion.\n\nWidely participated are the almost daily processions between Holy Wednesday and Easter Sunday. On Holy Wednesday, 57 life-size religious statues depicting key events of the Passion and Death of Christ on decorated carrozas are solemnly paraded along the streets followed either by devotees reciting the rosary or by a brass band.\n\nIn San Mateo, the townsfolk are in-charged in the care and preparation of each statue for the grand processions. But in contrast to biblical characterization of Christ dressed in plain clothing, the statues of Jesus paraded in Holy week processions are dressed grandly and ostentatiously in beaded satin or embroidered velvet.\n\nMrs. Guillermo “Mameng” Disederio commissioned a sculptor to carve the image of Maria Jacobe for the procession of the following year. Being a seamstress by profession, Mameng made the intricately embroidered dress for Maria Jacobe.\n\nEqually stunning is the image of Maria Magdalena which was inherited by Gregorio Manahan from his mother Felicidad Francisco-Manahan in 1962. The 1920’s statue was originally owned by Brigida Agapito-Francisco. For more than 50 years, the Manahan family supervised the preparation and participation of the image and its antique silver carroza in the annual Holy Week processions.\n\nLike the image of Maria Magdalena, many of the statues dressed for the procession are heirloom pieces such as the image of Saint John. The sons of Sixto Pagkatipunan traced the ownership of the image of San Juan to their forebears. It was inherited by Sixto from his father Vicente Pagkatipunan in 1938. The body of the statue has been recently carved to accommodate the antique head and hands of the original image.\n\nLike the Pagkatipunans, the De Los Angeles family of Barangay Patiis once owned a pre-war image of San Pedro. Unfortunately, the image was destroyed during World War II. Since 1945, San Pedro has been absent in the yearly processions until in 1965 when Oscar De Los Angeles commissioned a sculptor to carve the head and hands for the new image.\n\nFor some time, the image of San Pedro has made through the procession with a body made of bamboo commonly called the bastidor. When Oscar passed away in 1986, the care and ownership of the image was given to Randy Florencio -a neighbor of the De Los Angeles who has been dedicated in preparing the image for the annual Holy Week procession.\n\nThe current image of San Mateo is a replica of a much earlier image. The original San Mateo was owned by Vicente Gugol of Barangay Dulong Bayan. When he passed away, his daughter Gliceria Gugol-Cruz took care of the image until in 1968 when the image was inherited by Gliceria’s son, Teodoro Cruz. In 1991, the image was destroyed in fire incident. However, a new image was commissioned by Teodoro for the 1992 procession.\n\nAvelina Bandong owns the image of Maria Salome. Maria Salome was the wife of Zeedeo and mother to apostles James and John. She is one of the women who followed Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem. The image of Maria Salome was commissioned by a Paete master in 1991. The image helps the Bandong family ties close.\n\nThe image Maria Cleofe was originally made not for the town of San Mateo but for the Laguna town of Pakil. The image was bestowed by Pakil-born Guillerma Pasang to her daughter Gloria Isorena-Mateo. In 1963, Gloria married Rodolfo “Ruding” Mateo Sr. -a native of San Mateo. Gloria led her family in continuing the tradition of traveling to Pakil to prepare the image for the procession in her home town. However, in 1988, Gloria decided to bring the image to San Mateo where it now joins the yearly procession.\n\nThe image of the Panalangin depicts the Agony of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemani. The image is under the care of the Candaba family by Mary, wife of Teodoro Candaba Jr. who inherited the image from his mother Consolacion Candaba. The original ownership of the image is traced to Candeng Sta. Maria.\n\nThe image of Mahal na Poong Jesus Nazareno has a large and loyal following each year. Perhaps its because of the popularity of the Nazareno in Quiapo. Both images depict the suffering Christ carrying the weight of the Cross. The original image is owned by the Vicente family of Barangay Sta. Ana.\n\nThe original image was created by Marcelo Vicente during Peacetime. With the passing of Marcelo, Guadalupe Vicente inherited the image. The image was a destroyed while inside the Church of Nuestra Senora de Aranzazu during World War II. Gerardo Vicente (brother of Guadalupe) commissioned a second image after the war and together with his daughter Margarita Vicente-Marquez. Generations of Vicente took turns in taking care of the Nazareno. The image is currently under the care of Arnold Salandan and Robert Manahan, great grandsons of the original owner.\n\nThe image of Sta. Veronica is centuries-old including its treasures and silver carroza. The image was carved in the 1800s in Paete, Laguna and was brought from Pangil, Laguna to San Mateo by Victoriano and Andrea Santos in the 1930’s. The image and all its original treasures are currently under the care of Theresa Manahan-Jazmines who inherited the image from her mother Rosita Santos-Manahan.\n\nThe Virgen de la Soledad is the climax of the Wednesday Procession. The image was inherited by Isabel Manahan-Santiago from its original owner Andrea Diaz. The Santiago family, led by Salud Santiago is in-charged in taking care of the statue and with its preparation for the annual procession during Holy Wednesday.\n\nReference: Tessa Manahan-Jazmines, editor, Debosyon at Kasaysayan: Ang Mahal na Araw sa Bayan ng San Mateo, Parokya ng Nuestra Senora de Aranzazu\n\nRelated posts: San Mateo Holy Week Processions | Kakanin Festival | Grand Sto. Nino Procession in San Mateo | San Mateo Ati-atihan | San Mateo Rizal |\n\nAs a child, I’ve learned about the events of Christ’s final week on earth from the various church activities during lent, the pabasa, visita yglesia, via crucis, siete palabras, and in the almost daily processions beginning Palm Sunday until Easter Sunday.\n\nAs recounted in the New Testament, the events culminating in the crucifixion of Jesus occurred in the week of the Passover sometime in the year 30 A.D.\n\nThe Palm Sunday Procession and the Versatile Palaspas\n\nJesus arrived in Jerusalem on a Sunday with the 12 apostle and they were acclaimed by a crowd waving branches. This event is reenacted in the Palm Sunday procession where the priest astride a horse (instead of a donkey) bless the decorated the palms or the palaspas.\n\nThe blessed palaspas were brought home and place on the window or hung over the door with the belief it wards off evil spirits and shields the house from lightning and natural calamities.\n\nThe sanctified palaspas from the previous year are burned to make ash for Miercoles de Ceniza which starts the 40 days of lent. But there are some who refuse to turnover their old palaspas believing that (like with all blessed objects) it attracts good fortune.\n\nThe Don’ts of Mahal na Araw and the Traditional Pasyon\n\nWith Holy Monday began the don’ts of Holy Week. Meat is prohibited. Fish, seafoods and vegetable dishes bec0me table staple until Friday. No loud music and as children, we were warned not to raise our voices and to avoid boisterous laughter so as not to compete with the eerie wail pouring out of speakers from makeshift chapels in the neighborhood.\n\nThe pabasa -a marathon chanting of the life and passion (or pasyon) of Christ usually begins on Holy Monday and continues unabated until Good Friday. The pasyon is also performed on stage complete with lavish costumes and props in the passion play called the cenaculo.\n\nRites before the Processional Rites\n\nHoly Tuesday is a busy day for the owners of heirloom life-size tableaux and holy images. From stockrooms, they would open several wooden chests containing the rich costumes and jewelry that will be worn by their family’s sacred icons on Holy Wednesday and Good Friday processions.\n\nThe carroza that will bear the image or tableaux has been rolled out of storage several days earlier to be polished until the silver glistens and the wood mirrors the deep beauty of its age. On procession day, the carroza will be dressed with fresh flowers.\n\nHoly Wednesday Procession\n\nThe procession on the afternoon of Holy Wednesday consists of images and tableaux showing the key events leading to the Crucifixion. It begins with the parade of the 12 apostles and then followed by the lead characters in the passion of Christ.\n\nI can easily identify San Pedro when the image is holding a key and a rooster on its side, San Mateo for the feather and an angel, San Andres for the X-shaped cross, Sta. Martha carrying loaves of bread, Sta. Maria Magdalena carrying a bottle of perfume, Maria Salome with an incense burner and so many colorful characters.\n\nThe tableaux showing the events in the passion of Christ are next in queue. At this point, the number of images on the carrozas increases as the procession progresses. It begins with the Humenta -the image of Jesus on a donkey while blessing a crowd waving palms. The climax of the Holy Wednesday procession is the Station of the Cross or Via Crucis which ends with the image of the Pieta -the image of the sorrowful Mother Mary embracing the dead Jesus.\n\nVisita Ylgesia and the Via Crucis\n\nOn Thursday, Jesus and the apostles sat down for supper in celebration of the Passover. On that evening, Christ instituted the sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, washed the feet of the apostles and revealed that He would be betrayed. This occasion is celebrated in the mass on Maundy Thursday where the Body of Christ represented by the Holy Host is enshrined in the Altar of the Repose.\n\nBy evening, pilgrims start moving from church to church to perform the Visita Ylgesia. This Lenten tradition goes back to the time of the early Christian church. Catholic pilgrims visit the Blessed Sacrament in the seven basilicas of Rome. In the Philippines, pilgrims visit a total of 14 churches to contemplate the Via Crucis.\n\nIn continuing our family’s tradition, we attend the Maundy Thursday ceremonies at the Manila Cathedral and begin the First Station of the Cross in the old Sagrario -a side chapel in cathedral where the reposed Host is brought in after a solemn procession led by the Archbishop of Manila.\n\nSiete Palabras and the Procession of Santo Entierro\n\nOn Good Friday, the Sanhedrin (Great Council of the Elders of Israel) found Christ guilty of blasphemy. He was brought to Herod only to be mocked for failing to perform miracles. He was sent back to Pilate and was presented to the people where the crowd decided to set the criminal Barabas free and Jesus to be crucified.\n\nChrist was scourge, crowned with thorns, and made to carry a cross through the streets of Jerusalem. When He reached the hill called Golgotha, place of skull in Latin where He was nailed to the Cross at the third hour or 9:00 in the morning. By this time, my family have already settled at the Santo Domingo Church for the Seven Last Words or Siete Palabras sermons led by the Order of Preachers.\n\nAt the ninth hour or three in the afternoon, Jesus expired and He was taken down from Cross to be buried in a rock tomb. A couple of hours before evening, the solemn procession of the Santo Entierro emerges accompanied by the same tableaux and images from the Holy Wednesday procession, onyl that they are dressed in black or in their mourning costumes. The Santo Entierro, the image of the dead Christ laid on a bier, cap the procession in remembrance of the saddest night in Christendom.\n\nSabado de Gloria and the Blessing of Fire and Water\n\nIn the morning of the next day, Saturday, an outburst of bells pealing from churches marks the end of great silence and no romping. As a child, I was told to jump high to grow taller faster. Meat dishes resurface on dining tables. At afternoon we take a long siesta as preparation for the pre-Easter ritual called the Blessing of Fire and Water.\n\nIn some churches, the ritual blessing of fire and water is still practiced. For the first time since the start of lent, glorious music is played again. For this ceremony, all lights inside the church were turned off. The dark and cold church interior is illuminated by flickering flames and soft glow from the candles held by the faithful.\n\nIt is Sabado de Gloria but the most glorious event is yet happen at the break of dawn the next day – on Easter Sunday.\n\nOld-Style Salubong\n\nBefore the break of dawn on Sunday, the men folk gather in one place to accompany the image of the Risen Christ while the women march apart with the image of the Blessed Mother. The two groups met at a makeshift stage in front of the church under a giant heart.\n\nWhile the choir sings the Regine Coeli, the giant heart opens. A child dressed as an angel descends to remove the black veil covering the Virgin’s face. Everyone in the crowd hail Alleluia! Christ has risen!\n\nHave a Blessed Holy Week.\n\nLocated across the street from the plain and heavily modernized Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral, in the historic Parian District, the Ecclesiastical Museum of the Archdiocese of Cebu is housed in the cathedral’s centuries-old rectory.\n\nSurviving earthquakes, wars, the elements, and clandestine renovators, the museum building served in different occasions as rectory, school, and cooperative store until its adaptive reuse as a repository of religious and secular treasures and antiquities.\n\nAs we walked inside of what looked like an oversized bahay-na-bato, resident museum guide Baby Arnuco greeted us at the lobby. The lobby has an exhibition of artifacts unearthed within the rectory compound. There is also an excavated section showing different layers of flooring that came ahead of the present tiled-flooring.\n\nOur veritable museum guide led us to the restored chapel where she presented an interactive and entertaining overview about the archdiocese’s history, the museum building and museum pieces that belonged to the parish of Carmen, Cebu.\n\nBaby annotated every relic in the Carmen Collection from the antique patarakas used during lent to the massive pews reserved only for the town’s principalia. She also explained the Christian symbols engraved on the wooden altar panels and shared the story about the recent miraculous apparition of the Holy Face of Jesus in the ornate tabernacle.\n\nWe left the chapel bloated with Cebu church trivia. As we ascended the wide antique staircase we felt the child-like curiosity for the things that awaited us on the second floor exhibition galleries.\n\nAt the time of our visit, the galleries on the upper floor concentrate on six major themes. They are -The Genesis of Our Faith, Viam, Veritatis, Elegi (I Have Choosen the Way of the Truth), De Cal Y Canto (Building the House of God), Gathering of Saints, Regalia of Worship, and The Priestly Life.\n\nThe last theme is a peek into the typical bedroom of a priest in the diocese. Among the display were old furniture and religious statues.\n\nWhile The Genesis of Our Faith exhibit traces the beginning of the Catholic faith the Philippines through vintage illustrations and photographs, the De Cal y Canto exhibits photographs and actual building materials that are no longer in used today in constructing colonial period churches including a documentation of materials used in building the church in Liloan, Cebu.\n\nTreasuries of colonial churches have marvelous examples in gold and silver, encrusted with precious stones. The Regalia of Worship showcases a fine collection of chalices, cruets, ciboriums, sacras, monstrance and chasubles. Once venerated, these museum pieces provides the physical dimensions to the spiritual teaching of the church.\n\nWhile the church vessels served their purpose in carrying out the sacraments, Christian images were introduced by Spanish friars as teaching aids. In the Gathering of Saints, antique santos of every conceivable saint collected from the different churches under archdiocese of Cebu are exhibited. Included in the exhibit was an exquisite statue of San Miguel Archangel from Argao and rare San Jose in his deathbed!\n\nThere is a certain beauty in old santos that cannot be defined. They radiate an inimitable forcefulforness. Especially in ivory. Not only that they are an exquisite art they are also prized collectibles from Spanish period churches. Central to the collection are two tableaus in ivory and wood. One of Calvary scene and another depicting the Sagrada Familia on their Flight to Egypt.\n\nAntique santos foster intimacy between the faithful and their holy intermediaries, they have become prized collectibles especially if they were once enshrined on massive retablos of grand churches. Like the San Agustin Museum in Manila, the Baclayon Church Museum in Bohol and a handful of veritable church museums around the country, ecclesiastical museums safeguard these devotional handiwork from voracious collectors, thieves and heedless antique dealers.\n\n__________________________\n\nRelated post: Cebu Heritage Walk"
