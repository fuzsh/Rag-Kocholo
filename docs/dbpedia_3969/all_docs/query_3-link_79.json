After settling near South Bend, Indiana, in 1842, where they would found the University of Notre Dame and St. Joseph Parish, Holy Cross quickly spread throughout the rest of the country.\n\nThe Congregation grew with the country, as the United States became the country with the largest number of Holy Cross religious. Missionaries have gone out from the United States around the world, while within the country, Holy Cross has been known for a strong commitment to Catholic education at all levels."
