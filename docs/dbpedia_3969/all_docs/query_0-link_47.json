Lucia Parish Sasmuan; Immaculada Concepcion Parish, Guagua; Santiago Apostol Parish Betis, Guagua; San Jose Labrador Parish Floridablanca; Sta. Catalina de Alexandria Parish, Porac; Sta.

Reginald Malicdem, Manila Cathedral rector, said Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle has asked clergy members in the\n\narchdiocese to check on the people and churches.\n\n“Yes, he asked priests in the Archdiocese to see if some people in our\n\narea were hurt or displaced, so they could be attended to and to check\n\nthe parish church, rectory, pastoral halls and schools for possible\n\ncracks or damage, so appropriate action could be taken,” Malicdem said\n\nin an interview.\n\nOn the other hand, Sorsogon Bishop Arturo Bastes reported that churches in their diocese are secured.\n\n“All our churches are either brand new or very well renovated. All churches in Sorsogon are strong and beautiful,” he added.\n\nOn Monday, a 6.1 earthquake jolted some parts of Luzon including Metro Manila, damaging roads, buildings, and churches. (PNA)"
