        "text": "[RE: UA-219-2005: PHILIPPINES: Threat against an activist priest; bullets offered after a mass in Bulacan, Luzon]\n\n————————————-\n\nPHILIPPINES: Surveillance and intimidation of a human rights defender; early warning of possible extrajudicial killing or forced disappearance; inadequate government action; rule of law\n\n————————————-\n\nDear friends,\n\nSince the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) issued its first urgent appeal a year ago about alleged death threats against Catholic priest Rolando de Leon of the community of Norzagaray in Bulacan Province (please read our previous appeal UA-219-2005), he has continued to face a series of intimidating incidents to presumably stop him from further work to promote and protect human rights in his area in Central Luzon.\n\nUPDATED INFORMATION:\n\nFather Rolando de Leon is the parish priest of San Andres Apostol Parish in Norzagaray in Bulacan Province and the supervisor of 20 Catholic parishes in the city of San Jose and three towns in the area. He is also the spokesperson for the Catholic human rights organisation in the province. Because of these roles, he is a well-known public figure in this part of the Philippines in Central Luzon located north of Manila.\n\nAs noted in the AHRC’s previous urgent appeal, Father de Leon began experiencing a series of intimidating events after the Mass he celebrated on Sunday 30 October 2005 in Norzagaray. After the Mass, four envelopes were found in the church offering with the following message: “Warning to you Father Rolando de Leon; you will be the next.” Three of the envelopes contained an M-16 bullet. The empty envelope has been interpreted to possibly mean that the missing bullet is meant for Father de Leon. It is suspected that the military or police put the envelopes in the offering as ordinary citizens do not possess or have access to this type of ammunition.\n\nAbout two months later in December 2005 a soldier was seen putting up posters in the main public square of Norzagaray and the adjoining streets and bridges. The posters contained the picture of a priest celebrating Mass with the hammer-and-sickle logo of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its military wing, the New People’s Army (NPA), on the back of the priest’s robe. Although the priest is nameless in the poster, it is believed that the image of the priest refers to Father de Leon as there are only two priests in Norzagaray and Father de Leon’s assistant has not received any death threats. During the same month, the army stationed a detachment of soldiers in front of the neighbourhood clinic from where they could observe Father de Leon’s church.\n\nIn March 2006, Father de Leon spoke at a press conference about human rights violations in Bulacan Province that had been documented by the Catholic Church’s provincial human rights office in Bulacan’s capital of Malolos. A few days later Gen. Jovito Palparan Jr., the military commander of the region at the time, was quoted in the local newspaper Balita as saying that Father de Leon “cannot be trusted because he is a liar.”\n\nMoreover, between January and October 2006, the military organised a series of meetings in the five towns of the province at which the military accused Father de Leon of being a member of the NPA. Furthermore, throughout the year, uniformed soldiers periodically come to Father de Leon’s convent asking for him but never indicate the reason for their visit. In addition, uniformed soldiers also sit in the church’s courtyard with their guns from time to time.\n\nThis pattern of events in the past year are similar to those experienced by other clergy members, lay people and human rights defenders in the Philippines, many of whom who later have been extrajudicially killed or who have disappeared.\n\nSUGGESTED ACTION:\n\nPlease write to the authorities below and urge them to immediately conduct an impartial and thorough inquiry into the alleged intimidation and surveillance of Father Rolando de Leon that follows a similar pattern to other death threats received by other clergy members and human rights defenders in the Philippines. Because many of these clergy members and human rights activists have been killed, please also urge them to immediately take measures to provide effective protection to Father de Leon."
