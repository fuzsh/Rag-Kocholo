        "text": "Back when we started to plan for our wedding, we did not want to hold the reception at a hotel. Our main concern then was how the food will be served to the tables. Hehe. From past experiences as wedding guests, there are tendencies that food is being served to some tables later than the other. If there will be a waiting time, at least keep it at minimum. We had observed kasi before in hotels, some guests are finishing off their meal while other tables are not being served yet. We did not want that to our wedding.\n\nWe got the Silk Wedding Package of Blue Leaf Events Pavilion with K by Cunanan as our Caterer. Later on we upgraded to their Banyan Hall anticipating at least 200 guests to attend.\n\nVenue Inclusion:\n\nFive (5) hours use of the Venue for Event proper\n\nTwo (2)-hour preparation time immediately prior to the Event for the purpose of preparing and decorating the Venue for the Event;\n\nOne (1)-hour Clearing Time.\n\nUse of Air-conditioning System\n\n5000 Lumens LCD Projector and 8’x8’ Screen\n\nSound System: 6 Speakers, 1 Equalizer, 3 Amplifiers, 1 Mixer with 6 inputs, 2 microphones, and a media player\n\nElectricity (up to 60 amperes)\n\nParking Space\n\nUse of restrooms\n\nUse of Caterer’s area of Client’s selected caterer\n\nPavilion Lounge (adjacent to the Venue)\n\nSecurity, Engineering and Maintenance Staff\n\nWedding Essential\n\n– An overnight stay in a 1-Bedroom Executive at Ascott Bonifacio Global City Manila\n\n– Three-layered Fondant Cake c/o Hearts and Bells\n\n– Full Ceiling Drapes\n\n– Complete Lights and Sounds System c/o Sound Assembly\n\n– Photo Booth: 3 hours with unlimited 4R prints on a standee, customized backdrop and template c/o Pose and Prints\n\nVenue: Blue Leaf Events Pavilion – Banyan Hall\n\nBased on their fact sheet, Banyan hall can cater up to 300 guests but they informed us that for weddings it can hold up to 250 guests max only. We had about 180 guests who came – 18 round tables and 2 sets of long tables for the VIP. I found it to be just right as it did not seem a bit cramped and guests could still move around between the tables. I had attended one wedding which had very limited space. The tables and chairs were arranged so close to each other that you would need to excuse yourself from the other guests if you needed to stand up or go to the washroom.\n\nThey required reservation fee upon booking which was deductible to the contract price. We were given 5 instalment to pay up the 50% down payment while the other half must be paid at least one month before the event. Actually, Blue Leaf had been very flexible when it comes to payment. They were not even chasing for payment on the given deadlines, as long as you could settle the total amount a month before the event. They also require a security deposit 2 weeks before your event and can be refunded at least two weeks after the event.\n\nIt seems they are more responsive through SMS or phone calls. It was quite a hassle for us since we are based abroad, their email responses was so delayed that I needed to make overseas call for them to alert them whenever I send an email. When I do, they respond naman maybe it’s just more effective lang through SMS or local phone calls. Our AE though was more assisting than the previous one who was quite dismissive.\n\nAll three pavilions are connected through this Zen-style garden. As they are all connected, our fear was that they might close off section of the garden if all three were booked at the same time. Hehe it seems that Jade Pavilion was not booked during our wedding, so it was only us and the other wedding held at Silk Pavilion sharing the garden. Actually it seemed like our guests had occupied the entire garden. Haha.\n\nOur guests loved the place too and raved even the cozy wash room. Lakas daw maka-sosyal and even joking they can stay there to party. Haha. I think they had it renovated recently because it was not how I remember it the first time we went there in February 2017. Their water feature was also upgraded! Banyan Hall was also repainted last year. It was so good all their reno works had been completed before our event. Haha!\n\nMode of Communication: Email, SMS, Phone Call\n\nValue for Money: Recommended, although we had some issues with the communications but actually they respond and assist naman maybe it is really just more convenient and effective to get them through SMS and local phone calls.\n\nOne (1) Projector Screen was included in the package but we had to add one more Couples may opt for an LED Wall instead. The projector screen seem a bit old. Our AV presentation looked malabo.\n\nHotel Preparation: Ascott Bonifacio Global City\n\nTwo (2) 3-Bedroom Executive Suite (2D/1N)\n\nOne (1) 1-Bedroom Executive Suite (3D/2N)\n\nThe Suites are spacious. In my suite, i think we were more than 20 people there and we still had space to move around. I don’t find the lobby though quite appealing for photo shoot. I saw a photo of my gown on the stairs, I also don’t quite like it. It seems that there were not much of a spot to take photos outside your suite.\n\nService was quite slow. On the morning of my wedding, we had to call numerous times to the front desk officer to ask for the housekeeping – my mother, my eldest sister and my coordinators. There was this male staff too behind the front desk who seemed annoyed while we were doing the shoot in the lobby. Not sure if he was the same guy who we were speaking to over the phone for the housekeeping. I mean if there was any restriction, they should have raised to us prior or had our AE Chad told us, right.\n\nSupplier meals are allowed inside the rooms and there is no limit to the number of guests or your crew.\n\nMode of Communication: Through Blue Leaf Events\n\nValue for Money: Recommendable. Our experience was not so bad. Suites are spacious and more importantly they allow supplier meals and no limit to the number of guests you had.\n\nWedding Cake: Hearts and Bells\n\nThree-layered fondant cake (18″, 14″, 10″x 7″)\n\nBottom layer edible (18″ x 3″) Chocolate flavor\n\nMs. Diana was the first one to remind me of our cake inclusion. We had chocolate flavor cake. Other flavors were red velvet, banana with choco chips, tropical carrot, mocha and vanilla.\n\nWe never had the chance to have cake tasting but the cake was very moist and delicious. I just sent her the peg that we want and she came back to us with the proposal. Actually, wedding cake was the least in our priority but we did not expect it to be delicious. It was moist and sugar flowers were not that sweet. Although it looked like a huge candy, the design was really great.\n\nMode of Communication: Email\n\nValue for Money: Highly Recommended.\n\nPhoto Booth: Pose and Prints\n\nI am not sure but our photo booth did not seem to be popular then. It was placed beside the registration table but it did not look like the typical photo booth area one could notice. They brought some machine that just looked like a box. We would not even notice it until our coordinator brought us to it. So just a tip, maybe a signboard may help direct your guests to the photo booth.\n\nI sent an email to Pose and Prints asking if it is possible to get a soft copy of their shots but until now, i haven’t received any reply from them.\n\nUpdate. As it turned out, 20 copies of the photo prints were uploaded on their website including our couple shot. 😂 Furthermore, only 1 layout was used on the photos there, as opposed to what we had agreed that we will be using the 2 layouts as above. So i am not really sure if that was about all. Til now they haven’t responded to me.\n\nMode of Communication: Email\n\nValue for Money: Not satisfied. I could have requested to deduct this from our package and engage another vendor.\n\n**I would post a separate review for our catering K by Cunanan.\n\nGot questions? Leave me a note.\n\nCheers,\n\nMrs. U"
