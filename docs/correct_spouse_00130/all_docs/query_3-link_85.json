        "text": "TRUE LOVE IS DEAD!\n\nFrom Us Weekly:\n\nAmy Poehler and Will Arnett are separating after nine years of marriage, Us Weekly has learned exclusively. \"It's very amicable,\" a source says. The couple's rep confirms the separation to Us.The couple, who wed on August 29, 2003, are parents to sons Archie, 3, and Abel, 2. Saturday Night Live alum Poehler, 40, and Up All Night actor Arnett, 42, have frequently appeared onscreen together, in both TV and film.\n\nI guess we can count Amy's appearance out of the Arrested Development reboot...\n\nOr a Blades of Glory sequel (not that you would have necessarily wanted it)...\n\nLOVE IS DEAD\n\nShare This Article"
