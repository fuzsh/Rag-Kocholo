        "text": "In a new interview with The Guardian, Arnett reflected on the divorce. At the time, he was filming the fourth season of the sitcom \"Arrested Development\" (picked up by Netflix after season three), and he said the shoot was \"almost excruciating.\" He continued, \"Just brutal, brutal, brutal. I was driving to the set one day and I pulled over to the side of the road and cried for an hour.\"\n\nThe star said that working with Mitchell Hurwitz, the series' creator, helped him turn his pain into something \"hilarious and cathartic\" on the show.\n\nArnett also spoke about the public's reaction to the divorce.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"People talk about you like they know you and they talk about your relationship as if they know what's going on.\n\n\"So imagine how weird that is. It's brutal with any relationship, and we have kids, and without getting into specifics, you then see stuff online, like, this one journalist wrote: 'I'm Team Amy.' I'm like: 'You're a grown person. What are you talking about? This is a breakup. This is a family. This isn't some game.'\"\n\nThe \"BoJack Horseman\" star clarified to The Guardian that his relationship with his children and family was good now.\n\n\"Yeah, you get on with it,\" he said. \"It's been almost 10 years and my kids are so lucky that Amy is their mother and I'm so lucky that we're such a huge part of each other's lives, even more so than we were five years ago.\""
