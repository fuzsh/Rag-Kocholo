        "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A judge has finalized Amy Poehler and Will Arnett’s divorce nearly four years after the comedians separated.\n\nCourt records show the divorce was finalized on Friday. The judgment does not include many details about their settlement, but states that neither actor will receive spousal support.\n\nThe judgment states Poehler and Arnett will share joint custody of their sons, ages 7 and 5.\n\nThe comedians were married in August 2003 and separated in September 2012. Arnett filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences, in April 2014.\n\nPoehler starred on the NBC show “Parks and Recreation.” Arnett voices the main character on Netflix’s animated series “BoJack Horseman.”"
