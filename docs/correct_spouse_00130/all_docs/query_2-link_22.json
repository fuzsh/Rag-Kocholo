        "text": "One of the funniest couples in Hollywood is breaking up.\n\nAmy Poehler, star of the NBC comedy “Parks and Recreation,” and Will Arnett, best known for his work on “Arrested Development,” are separating after nine years of marriage, a representative for the couple said.\n\nLewis Kay confirmed the two have split, but didn’t have any other details on their breakup.\n\nThe couple has two sons, a 3-year-old and a 2-year-old, according to the Internet Movie Database.\n\nThe two met in 2000 and married three years later.\n\nThey worked together several times. Poehler, 40, played a woman Arnett’s “Arrested” character married in Las Vegas. In the movie “Blades of Glory,” they played a brother and sister figure skating team. He also played her love interest in one episode of “Parks and Recreation.”\n\nArnett, 42, told CNN in 2010: “There’s for sure a lot of joking around – just as much as anybody in any household. But we’re a lot more boring than people think. Or, maybe it’s just as boring as people think.”\n\nArnett’s first marriage was to actress Penelope Ann Miller."
