He still brought it up once awhile and blamed her over the ticket for years.\n\nThe way ONTD collectively sobbed over this divorce announcement is forever etched in my memory\n\nI would like to be excluded from this narrative as I don't care about either one of them\n\nThe only thing I remember is that the divorce was a blind item and people here guessed it but they were hoping it was the usual bs.\n\nLmao I always think about that whenever I see news about either of them.\n\nyo i just went back to that post and it was 1400 comments!!!! has that ever happened again since?\n\nJohn Mulaney cheating posts lol\n\n(no subject) - ghostsaddle Expand\n\nImagine how painful it was for Jessica Walter when you and your dumbass male AD castmates instead of showing grace and support, you dared to lecture her, knowing damn well she was hurt.

The cast always seemed to have a bit of a dickish vibe (it always seemed Portia was kept a bit on the outside too) but that was not cool.\n\ngod that fucking INFURIATED me\n\nthey've been able to keep it classy since they split up, right? don't recall hearing about any messiness (in regards to their divorce/co-parenting)\n\nEdited at 2022-02-09 07:15 pm (UTC)\n\nAmy refused to talk about it in her book. She didn’t just ignore it she flat said she wasn’t going to say anything about it.\n\nGood for her, that’s the classy thing to do for your kids\n\n“People talk about you like they know you and they talk about your relationship as if they know what’s going on. So imagine how weird that is. It’s brutal with any relationship, and we have kids, and without getting into specifics, you then see stuff online, like, this one journalist wrote: ‘I’m Team Amy.’ I’m like: ‘You’re a grown person. What are you talking about? This is a breakup. This is a family. This isn’t some game.’”\n\nI see this a lot in the Olivia Munn/that dude who knocked her up/his wife posts and I completely agree with this.\n\nThe way people talk about their relationship is so weird to me. Like none of you guys have any idea what actually happened for them to break up. All you see is what they post on IG. John and Olivia seem very happy together.\n\nI always file that under weird white people news.\n\nEdited at 2022-02-09 08:00 pm (UTC)\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - pikapika217 Expand\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - pikapika217 Expand\n\n(no subject) - anterrabre Expand\n\nI recently read through a series of posts on the HobbyDrama subreddit that followed the nonsense in certain John Mulaney subreddits in regards to the breakup & new relationship/baby...

I know nothing about them even though I read her book\n\n(no subject) - andisprohi Expand\n\n(no subject) - wickedground Expand\n\nI always read he cheated on Amy with Christina Applegate. They were on a flop show together iirc.\n\n(no subject) - therearewords Expand\n\n(no subject) - topismine Expand\n\nIndeed! My guess is that she initiated the split.\n\nthere were rumors he cheated but idk. supposedly the character of Heather Graham on his Netflix show was based after Amy and my guess is Amy's career took off and she became known for smart humor whereas he kind of became known for being stupid/having dumb roles. He got pretty snappy at some comments on instagram about the stuff he was doing (it was a really bad movie about a dog show that flopped) so I wouldn't be surprised if there were deeper issues there.\n\nin amy's memoir she has a whole chapter called \"my books on divorce\" where she says she doesn't want to talk about it because it's \"too sad\" and \"too personal\", and instead pitches some titles for books about divorce that would be more realistic with the advice people need/give. she also says she's happy will is the father of her kids and that she's proud they're able to take care of their kids.\n\ni remember they even quarantined together during the beginning of the pandemic too\n\nQuarantining together for the kids is a really awesome thing to do, I'm glad they could do it.\n\nI can't believe it's been almost 10yr. How?\n\nRight? I remember the ONTD post about it like it was yesterday….😦\n\nThis is my 2nd ever lj and I got a message that it was my 18tj birthday and I've definitely been here most of that time. How!? lmao\n\nHe's one of my favorite Batmen of all time 😬😄\n\nI've thought about what it'd be like to be going through a really hard time and have thousands of strangers commenting on my social media posts about how horrible I am and all the things I did wrong when they know nothing and... idk what'd happen to me. I know to take the internet with a grain of salt but being pelted so consistently with that kind of diatribe would really hurt my mental health.\n\nA few times when I was younger I thought about doing stuff on YouTube and even a few years ago was mulling over a podcast but never got to it and as time rolls on I definitely feel like that laziness ended up benefitting me because I already have an issue with hyper focusing on my flaws by myself, I certainly wouldn't need any outside input LOL\n\nIt’s been almost 10 years\n\nDamn I couldn't believe this but looked it up and they did separate in 2012 (tho didn't officially divorce until 2016) - i can't believe it's been that long\n\n\"People talk about you like they know you and they talk about your relationship as if they know what’s going on.

LOL\n\nThat's definitely something we do a lot - speculate, assign blame, judge - and I do think in general the way we here especially at times have those types of parasocial relationships with our fave celebs could be examined a bit within ourselves. Like it's one thing to judge someone for being actually harmful (abusive, racist, homophobic, sexist) but I've definitely been trying to not assume so-so much myself because ultimately we don't know the whole truth most of the time/in most circumstances. At the same time I do feel glad at the community we have here because we remember important things that are awful that celebs have done and don't just easily brush those aside or pretend they don't matter. We have those nuanced discussions I really can appreciate and get no where else.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nit's the whole search for a perfect god thing and i legit fear for the next generation if we don't get a handle on it. expecting anyone to be perfect, while professing your perfection is a road to ruin. since social media is used as such a judgement ground you see people looking for bad faith in everything and there are legit sociology studies that talk about how if you're always looking for bad faith, you will see it. let alone the discussions on how in real life something is in the past, that's how time has always worked, and being a dumb ass teenager is an actual life thing, but online something years ago can be made current in the blink of a retweet. that alone will screw with one's mental processing since usually it's just family that never lets shit go. oh just mine? /s\n\nLet alone the studies talking about how much the idea of mistakes, forgiveness, actually moving on, atoning, and grace are taking a hit in doing in people's mental health cause nobody is perfect, we've all misspoken, changed a view, etc etc. That colliding with the parasocial relationship stuff, the whole holding celebs to a bigger standard than politicians and actual power people, it's all making for a big recipe for disaster.\n\nI'm endlessly fascinated by the paradoxes that exist online and how much most of us discounted the reach and negatives of social media, i think to our detriment, because we personally felt we had a handle on it and our reactions. all while not fully appreciating the magnitude of the reach and how many can't handle the information waves coming at them. and i don't think it's always a them problem.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - numbedtoe Expand\n\neven truly genuinely good people are messy sometimes because emotions are messy and relationships are messy.\n\n(no subject) - pikapika217 Expand\n\nI really dislike when people say \"team xxxx\" when people are getting divorced, because unless that person is a known shitbag you don't know what is going on. If I learned anything as I got older relationships and marriages end because both sides suck (with the exception of abusive people) at something and it unravels everything.\n\nExample: My mother is unbearable on lots of things, my father hasn't matured past 17 and spends money that isn't there. They both sucked and it was both their faults they got divorced.\n\nIt must suck but I guess celebs must be used to people having unfounded opinions about their lives.\n\nDidn’t he cheat on her??"
