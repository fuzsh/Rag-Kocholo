        "text": "Between her hilarious characters, amazing talent, and epic co-hosting abilities, Amy Poehler is like the best friend everyone desperately wants. So when she and fellow actor Will Arnett announced they were separating in 2012, it wasn't totally uncommon for fans to have this overwhelming urge to hug her and hear all about it. (Of course, hopefully no one did, because that would be incredibly inappropriate.) Now, according to E! Online, Amy publicly discusses the split for the first time in her forthcoming memoir, Yes, Please (available October 28).\n\nAmy writes, \"Imagine spreading everything you care about on a blanket and then tossing the whole thing up in the air. … The process of divorce is about loading that blanket, throwing it up, watching it all spin, and worrying what stuff will break when it lands.”\n\nMORE: The Divorce Rate is Much Lower Than You Think\n\n“When you are a person going through a divorce, you feel incredibly alone, yet you are constantly reminded by society of how frequently divorce happens and how common it has become. You aren't allowed to feel special, but no one knows the specific ways you are in pain.\"\n\nThat feeling of isolation is something to keep in mind when you or someone you know is going through a divorce. Even though this situation is something that is relatively common in our society, that doesn't mean that each person isn't still going through their own unique and complex experience, which may be trivialized by a comment like, \"Ugh, I know, divorce is the worst.\"\n\nMORE: 5 Ways to Help a Friend Through a Divorce\n\nAmy also notes that she's proud of the way she and Will are ensuring that their sons, Abel, six, and Archie, five, have two loving and supportive parents. “I am beyond grateful he is their father, and I don't think a 10-year marriage constitutes failure.”\n\nFor more insights from Amy, check out her book when it hits shelves on October 28."
