You just knocked out 30 percent of this post.\n\nUs Weekly and People are both reporting that Amy Poehler and Will Arnett will amicably separate after nine years of marriage.\n\nThe couple have sons Archie, three and a half, and Abel, two.\n\nI feel like there's probably nothing more annoying when you're in the process of breaking up than to have millions of people you don't know act personally offended, so I won't go on and on about how my heart sank when I saw this.\n\nI will just say: This is my Brad and Jen, people. So be gentle with me the next couple days.\n\nP.S. Want more Obsessed?
