        "text": "Amy Poehler is most likely every girl's dream BFF. From Parks and Recreation's Leslie Knope to the 'Cool Mom' in 'Mean Girls', Poehler's comedic genius is not only coveted but deeply admired within the industry and outside. So it's no wonder that our curiosities are piqued thinking about what exactly it must be like to date the queen of comedy who's not only appeared on countless SNL stints but also has been an award season favorite with her close friend Tina Fey.\n\nHer past has seen the likes of Will Arnett and Nick Kroll among fellow whizzes in the comedy genre who have had the experience of calling her their significant other. But ahead of her self-directed feminist teen comedy 'Moxie' making its Netflix debut, let's take a look at who Poehler is dating.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nNetflix's 'Moxie': Release date, plot, cast, trailer and all you need to know about Amy Poehler's teen comedy\n\nAmy Poehler, the boss of 'Parks and Recreation', is totally up for a revival\n\nAre Amy Poehler and Will Arnett back together?\n\nThe 'Wine Country' actress was recently in the news with ex-husband Will Arnett as the two of them quarantine together amidst the pandemic, with their two children — Archie, six, and four-year-old Abel. Soon as they were spotted together mid-quarantine, fans couldn't help but wonder if they had resumed their relationship with many jumping the gun and calling the reunion a glorious blessing on social media, praying against all odds that the two were reconciling.\n\nUnfortunately, that was not the case. Arnett, who was married to Poehler for 10 years, is currently expecting his first child with his girlfriend Alessandra Brawn. And while some fans earnestly hoped he and Poehler would be back together, many agreed on what better way to spend time with their two young children than this quarantine.\n\nAmy Poehler and Will Arnett's divorce\n\nPoehler and Arnett announced they were getting divorced in September of 2012, after tying the knot in August 2003. Their divorce was finalized in 2016. By then, the actress and comedian had already found love in her 'Parks and Recreation' co-star Kroll. In the middle of announcing their split and their divorce getting finalized, in 2014 came Poehler's memoir where she wrote about the process of splitting up from her long-term beau.\n\n\"When you are a person going through a divorce, you feel incredibly alone, yet you are constantly reminded by society of how frequently divorce happens and how common it has become,\" the 43-year-old comedian shared. \"You aren't allowed to feel special, but no one knows the specific ways you are in pain.\"\n\nShe added, \"Imagine spreading everything you care about on a blanket and then tossing the whole thing up in the air. The process of divorce is about loading that blanket, throwing it up, watching it all spin, and worrying what stuff will break when it lands.\"\n\nWhile Poehler didn't want to dwell on the topic for too long, she did add that it was all \"too sad and too personal,\" explaining \"I also don't like people knowing my shit.\"\n\nReasons behind divorce\n\nWhile the two are co-parenting their two children without a trite, the reason behind their impeccable bond might have to do with what sources said about the reasons behind their divorce. Speaking to Radar Online, a source said, \"Will and Amy started to feel more like best friends than a married couple. They drifted apart, like a lot of couples do, but there’s no malice in the split, nor was anyone else involved. Everyone used to think that because Amy and Will are both comedians their relationship was all fun. However, the laughter stopped a long time ago and now they just want to move on with their lives.”\n\nAbout haters picking sides following their divorce, Arnett had also said on Dax Shepherd's podcast: \"I wanted to respond and go, ‘We’re human beings in a relationship, and our relationship fell apart. It’s really sad. It’s heartbreaking. We have two kids, and this is not some f*cking game. What are you talking about? You have no f*cking clue what our experience is.'”\n\nAmy Poehler and Nick Kroll's romance\n\nWhen her 2014 memoir had come out, Poehler couldn't stop gushing about her new beau at the time, fellow comedian Nick Kroll, who played 'The Douche' on her momentous NBC sitcom 'Parks and Recreation'.\n\nThe two began dating in 2013, before her divorce from Arnett had been finalized. Poehler and her ex-husband were still very much split up when she wrote about her relationship with Kroll in her memoir, saying, \"I have a boyfriend who knows how to settle me. He puts his hand on my chest and tells me boring stories.\"\n\nTheir relationship, much like them, had very quirky moments to make people go absolutely 'awww'. Sharing an example of the same, Poehler wrote: \"On one of our first nights together, I woke up apologizing for my snoring and he pulled out two earplugs he had worn to bed so he could hear what I was saying. It was one of the most romantic gestures I have ever seen.\"\n\nUnfortunately, all of that adorable romance came to an end in 2015, when the couple split over conflicting schedules. Based on what a source told Us Weekly, \"They really tried, but it just wasn't realistic anymore. They were spending more time apart than together.\"\n\nWho is Amy Poehler dating now?\n\nKroll was the first person Poehler had dated since her divorce from ex-long term partner Arnett; ever since her and Kroll's 2015 break up, Poehler's personal life - especially the romance and relationship side - has been extremely secretive. Even if she did find love since then, the news never made it to public knowledge."
