        "text": "Exes Amy Poehler and Will Arnett have been isolating together during the coronavirus pandemic and we’re loving it.\n\nAmy and Will married in 2003 and share two sons Archie, 12, and Abel, 10. They split in 2012 but Will filed for divorce in 2014, which finalised two years later.\n\nThe two actors made an appearance on Canadian Covid-19 broadcast benefit Stronger Together, Tous Ensemble, and what on earth is going on?\n\nAccording to the BoJack Horseman actor, he ‘hasn’t taken a shower in about a month.’\n\nPoor Amy.\n\nThe two later donned face masks and advised people on how to help, saying rather ambiguously: ‘Do whatever you can — all our love to you, Canada. Stay safe.’\n\nOf course, fans went wild at the idea of the two living together during these strange times despite both of them having moved on since their split.\n\nOne fan simply was overwhelmed with the news: ‘amy poehler and will arnett quarantining together, (sic)’ along with a gif of the video game character Kirby falling off a cliff.\n\n‘Knowing @arnettwill and Amy Poehler are still on good terms is enough to get me through the rest of this pandemic. #StrongerTogether,’ another said after the scenes gave them a boost.\n\nOne was impressed at the idea, posting: ‘I love this divorced couple quarantined together for the kids vibe someone do this Halloween costume with me.’\n\nAt least it would be a very easy Halloween costume.\n\n‘Question…..was anyone else super happy to see Will Arnett and Amy Poehler self quarantining together?’ another asked and the answer is yes.\n\nWill – who is expecting a child with girlfriend Alessandra Brawn – recently opened up about how he felt about people taking sides when the two divorced.\n\nSpeaking to Dax Shepard on his podcast Armchair Expert, Will said: ‘I’ll say this, somebody actually tagged me on Twitter – a beat reporter for a Minnesota TV station – saying like, “I don’t know about you guys, but I’m Team Amy.”\n\n‘And I wanted to respond and go, “We’re human beings in a relationship, and our relationship fell apart. It’s really sad. It’s heartbreaking. We have two kids, and this is not some f**king game. What are you talking about? You have no f**king clue what our experience is.”‘\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Piers Morgan shades Dan Walker’s BBC Breakfast coronavirus coverage: ‘If you don’t like holding the government to account, watch them’"
