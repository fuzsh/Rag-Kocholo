        "text": "Will Arnett has spoken candidly about the pain and heartbreak he endured following his split from ex-wife Amy Poehler.\n\nArnett, 51, and Poehler, 50, tied the knot in 2003 but announced in 2012 that they had separated.\n\n\"Just brutal, brutal, brutal,\" Arnett told The Guardian of his separation from Poehler.\n\nREAD MORE: Singer Anne-Marie falls on stage during BRIT Awards\n\nAt the time of their breakup, the BoJack Horseman alum was filming Season 4 of Arrested Development.\n\n\"I was driving to the set one day and I pulled over to the side of the road and cried for an hour,\" he recalled.\n\nArnett added that one of the hardest parts of the breakup was the mass media attention and publicity it received.\n\n\"People talk about you like they know you and they talk about your relationship as if they know what's going on,\" he said.\n\n\"So imagine how weird that is. It's brutal with any relationship, and we have kids. And without getting into specifics, you then see stuff online, like, this one journalist wrote: 'I'm Team Amy.' I'm like: 'You're a grown person. What are you talking about? This is a breakup. This is a family. This isn't some game.'\"\n\nWhile their divorce was \"brutal\" for the actor, he acknowledged that \"you get on with it\" over time.\n\nREAD MORE: Woolies explains its controversial new sales pricing system\n\n\"It's been almost 10 years and my kids are so lucky that Amy is their mother,\" Arnett said. \"And I'm so lucky that we're such a huge part of each other's lives, even more so than we were five years ago.\"\n\nArnett and Poehler split after nine years together and their divorce was finalised in 2016. They continue to co-parent their sons Archie, 13, and Abel, 11.\n\nPoehler has also opened up about the pair's split in her 2014 memoir, Yes Please.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about my divorce because it is too sad and too personal. I also don't like people knowing my s--t,\" the Parks and Recreation alum wrote.\n\n\"I will say a few things. I am proud of how my ex-husband, Will, and I have been taking care of our children; I am beyond grateful he is their father; and I don't think a [nearly] 10-year marriage constitutes failure. That being said, getting a divorce really sucks.\n\nREAD MORE: Woman impales foot with high heel trying to kill spider\n\n\"Any painful experience makes you see things differently. It also reminds you of the simple truths that we purposely forget every day or else we would never get out of bed. Things like, nothing lasts forever and relationships can end. The best that can happen is you learn a little more about what you can handle and you stay soft through the pain. Perhaps you feel wiser. Maybe your experience can be of help to others.\"\n\nArnett and his girlfriend Alessandra Brawn welcomed their son, Alexander Denison Arnett, in May 2020.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here."
