        "text": "Will Arnett and Amy Poehler separated in September 2012, but apparently not everyone is paying attention.\n\nWhen asked by an ET reporter on the CBS live stream of the red carpet how he prepared with his wife for tonight's 65th Emmy Awards, Arnett, 43, said, \"I don't really have a significant otherâ€¦ She doesn't exist.\"\n\nIt was a cringe-worthy moment.\n\nThis came after he told the reporter his Emmy prep was just watching football.\n\nSee The Complete List of Winners for the 65th Emmy Awards\n\nHe closed the interview with some light humor: \"I'm excited, I can't wait to watch this back on YouTube all week.\"\n\nArnett has two sons with Poehler, Archibald and Abel, and he told Details Magazine earlier in the year that his boys have brought him some much-needed joy after the split.\n\n\"I'm 43, and I've found my happiness - which is my kids,\" he said."
