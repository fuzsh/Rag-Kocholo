        "text": "Amy Poehler has spoken about her divorce from Will Arnett for the very first time. The comedy stars shocked fans when they announced they were ending their marriage in September 2012, and now Amy has broken her silence on their split in her new book, Yes Please.\"\n\nImagine spreading everything you care about on a blanket and then tossing the whole thing up in the air,\" the Parks and Recreation actress writes in an excerpt obtained by RadarOnline. \"The process of divorce is about loading that blanket, throwing it up, watching it all spin, and worrying what stuff will break when it lands.\"\n\nAmy Poehler has addressed her divorce from Will Arnett for the first time\n\nCalling the reasons behind the split \"too sad\" and \"too personal\" to talk about, Amy adds: \"When you are a person going through a divorce you feel incredibly alone, yet you are constantly reminded by society of how frequently divorce happens and how common it has become.\n\n\"You aren't allowed to feel special, but no one knows the specific ways you are in pain.\"\n\nDespite their split, Amy has only good things to say about her Arrested Development star Will, with who she has two sons, Archie, nearly six, and Abel, four. \"I am proud of how my ex-husband Will and I have been taking care of our children,\" she says. \"I am beyond grateful he is their father, and I don't think a ten-year marriage constitutes failure.\" But she did add: \"Getting a divorce really sucks.\"\n\nThe Parks and Recreation star has gone on to find love with fellow comedian Nick Kroll\n\nAmy has gone on to find love with comedian Nick Kroll – and also writes candidly about her new man in the book.\n\n\"I have a boyfriend who knows how to settle me,\" she says. \"He puts his hand on my chest and tells me boring stories…\"\n\nOn one of our first nights together I woke up apologising for my snoring and he pulled out two earplugs he had worn to bed so he could hear what I was saying."
