        "text": "Amy Poehler and Nick Kroll started dating back in 2013 after meeting through their mutual love for comedy. At the time, the relationship was a breath of fresh air for Poehler as she had recently gone through a divorce from fellow comedian Will Arnett. The couple were often seen attending events together, making their red carpet debut at the AFI Life Achievement Award Gala Tribute to Mel Brooks. However, their busy schedules ultimately led to their break up in 2015 after two years of being together.\n\nWelcoming himself on the comedy scene with his unique blend of humor, Nick Kroll is best known as the creator and star of Comedy Central's sketch series Kroll Show. He has also played Ruxin on the hit FX series The League and voiced numerous characters in popular animated shows like Big Mouth and Sausage Party. In addition to his comedy career, Kroll has appeared in various film and television projects, solidifying his status as a multifaceted entertainer. Apart from his relationship with Amy Poehler, Kroll has kept his personal life relatively private.\n\nAlthough not a confirmed relationship, there were rumors swirling around that Amy Poehler and John Stamos had a brief romance after a dinner date in 2013. Stamos himself admitted to taking Poehler out for a meal during an appearance on Howard Stern's radio show, mentioning that, at the time, he didn't realize it was a date. While neither party has confirmed if the relationship went beyond that one evening, it certainly fuelled speculation and intrigue among fans and media alike.\n\nEarning a reputation as one of Hollywood's most charismatic and lovable stars, John Stamos shot to fame in the late 1980s when he landed his iconic role as Uncle Jesse on Full House. Since then, Stamos has enjoyed a successful career in acting and music, starring in shows like ER and Grandfathered while also showcasing his musical talents as a drummer for The Beach Boys. As for his romantic life, Stamos was married to model Rebecca Romijn from 1998 to 2005, and is currently married to actress Caitlin McHugh, with whom he has a son.\n\nAmy Poehler and Will Arnett's relationship began when they met in 2000 while working together on a television series called Battery Park. They quickly hit it off and tied the knot in 2003, raising eyebrows and attracting attention due to their shared comedic backgrounds. Throughout their nine-year marriage, the couple often collaborated on various projects, like Arrested Development and Blades of Glory. Sadly, they decided to part ways in 2012, finalizing their divorce in 2016, but remained amicable for the sake of their two sons.\n\nGaining recognition for his distinctive voice and comedic chops, Will Arnett has made his mark in Hollywood with memorable roles in both television and film. Most notably, he played Gob Bluth on the cult classic Arrested Development and lent his voice to hit animated features like The Lego Movie and BoJack Horseman. Following his split from Poehler, Arnett dated actress Arielle Vandenberg before moving on to current girlfriend, entrepreneur Alessandra Brawn, with whom he has a son."
