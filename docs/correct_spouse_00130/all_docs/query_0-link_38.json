        "text": "The two were married for nine years and had two children before the couple split back in 2012, but their divorce was only finalized last month. In her memoir, “Yes Please,” Amy Poehler describes the painful process of divorce. She writes:\n\n“When you are a person going through a divorce, you feel incredibly alone, yet you are constantly reminded by society of how frequently divorce happens and how common it has become. You aren’t allowed to feel special, but no one knows the specific ways you are in pain.”\n\nPoehler’s words likely ring true for many individuals going through divorce. Although it is fairly common today, it is still a very painful and difficult process. However, the level of pain and difficulty of each divorce varies. Oftentimes, parties who have swift divorces tend to suffer less emotionally. Unfortunately, swift divorces are generally rare. Court dockets become full, parties get emotional and retaliate, and issues continuously arise.\n\nHaving an attorney can help with canceling emotions and providing peace of mind. When new issues arise, your attorney can jump in and guide you on how to proceed. Although divorce itself may feel lonely, at least with an attorney by your side, you have a champion in your corner, an advocate, who will sit by you in the courtroom and lead you through the process.\n\nAt The Harris Law Firm, our Denver divorce attorneys are ready to assist you in resolving your legal matters in a way that best suits your needs through communication, teamwork, and dedicated service.
