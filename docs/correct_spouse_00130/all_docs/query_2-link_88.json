Idk.\n\nedit: wow, they separated in 2012? don't mind me then, I can't read.\n\nEdited at 2014-04-17 04:10 am (UTC)\n\nmaybe they had businesses together? i don't think jlo and marcs divorce has been finalized yet, and if it was, it was like less than 2 months ago. anyway, thing is they separated in like 2010 but just divorced (or soon) because they were separating the moneys before filing.\n\ni'm not sure what the laws are like in CA, but when i got divorced in IL the separation period is 2 years before you can file for divorce unless both parties agree to a shorter separation period of 6 months. 2 years seems to be a standard legal separation period\n\nnever got the appeal\n\nThey're both in relationships. I'm surprised this didn't happen sooner.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nReally? He's a \"want to like\" for me - I haven't been that impressed with anything of his besides GOB.\n\nhow much have you seen him in? he does lots of voice work, too.\n\nyou are hilarious.\n\n(no subject) - killerlooks Expand\n\n(no subject) - luvthatdrtywata Expand\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - mrcumberbatch Expand\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - lr489 Expand\n\nI think it's the opposite SHE deserves better.\n\n(no subject) - save_me_xenu Expand\n\nman, I didn't realize they were together so long, that's sad\n\nhe was married to Penelope Ann Miller? so random.\n\ni always forget that he's canadian too .. such a random factoid\n\n(no subject) - tuggernuts Expand\n\nCount me as another who assumed they were already divorced, but this makes me sad all over again.\n\ni was secretly hoping these two crazy kids would work it out ;________;\n\nME TOOOOOOO :-(\n\nsame here. love is dead. :(\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nYOU WILL NEVER HAVE LOVE, PARIS\n\nQUIT FILLING YOUR HOLES\n\nTHAT'S NOT WHERE THE VOID IN YOUR HEART IS\n\nI was sadder when they first broke up, but now I just feel like she's way better off.\n\nAlso, why did they wait so long to file?\n\nyaaaaasssss amy. so glad she is rid of that can of orange sunkist and closer to getting a joint checking account with that talented billionaire comedy genius of hers. teenage mutant ninja turtle money ain't got shit on a rich daddy.\n\nHOW DARE YOU INSULT THE CANADIAN MR.
