        "text": "And as they encouraged viewers to continue to prevent the spread of COVID-19, people began wondering if Poehler was self-isolating in the same house as the Canadian actor during the coronavirus pandemic. Some even speculated about whether or not the comedians have gotten back together.\n\nHowever, Arnett has reportedly been dating Alessandra Brawn, the 33-year-old former CEO of clothing brand Chapel, since 2019. In February, Us Weekly confirmed that the couple is expecting their first child.\n\nBrawn didn't appear in the television special and isn't confirmed to be self-isolating in the same house as Arnett.\n\nAfter factoring in the news that Brawn is pregnant, people pointed out that the exes are likely together to co-parent their kids rather than rekindle their romance.\n\nAnd for some fans, it was uplifting to see the comedians, who appeared together on episodes of \"Parks and Recreation\" and \"Arrested Development,\" on the same screen once again.\n\nPoehler, who briefly dated Nick Kroll after her breakup with Arnett, previously opened up about the couple's divorce in her 2014 memoir \"Yes Please.\"\n\n\"I am proud of how my ex-husband Will and I have been taking care of our children,\" she writes, adding, \"I am beyond grateful he is their father, and I don't think a 10-year marriage constitutes failure. That being said, getting a divorce really sucks.\""
