        "text": "Information about who Amy Poehler is currently dating is unavailable at the moment. However, it is known that she has dated a few men, including fellow comedian Nick Kroll and lawyer Benjamin Graf since her split from her husband.\n\nHollywood is full of love stories. Whether they be fictional or real, fans always hope that their favorite celebrities get to have a happily ever after. Sadly, that isnât always the case as is evidenced by the start and finish of Amy Poehlerâs love story with Will Arnett.\n\nDubbed the comedy worldâs answer to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, no one saw it coming when Poehler and Arnett called it quits after several years together. Many felt confused at the sudden change in what appeared to be a blissful marriage and it wasnât until much later that Amy Poehler spoke up about the divorce.\n\nAmy Poehlerâs Marriage and Separation From Will Arnett\n\nThe first time Amy Poehler and Will Arnett met was in 1996. Arnett saw one of her performances with her improv group Upright Citizens Brigade and she caught his eye instantly. And even though they didnât hit it off immediately, as Arnett went to see the show with his then-girlfriend, four years later, after meeting through mutual friends, they began dating. Their relationship kept on going strong, and three years later on August 29, 2003, Amy and Will tied the knot.\n\nWhile they were married, they used their abilities as excellent comics to work on several TV shows and movies together. Among these projects include Arrested Development, Horton Hears a Who!, The Secret World of Arrietty, Parks and Recreation, Spring Breakdown, Blades of Glory, Monsters vs. Aliens and Blades of Glory.\n\nFans delighted completely in seeing the duo both on and off-screen. Their bond was a beautiful thing to see, so it was no wonder fans became confused when the couple legally separated on September 6, 2012. The belief going around was that Poehler and Arnett were trying to work things out, until Arnett filed for divorce in April 2014. On July 29, 2016, the couple officially divorced.\n\nAmy Poehler stayed silent on the subject until her memoir, Yes Please, was published by HarperCollins imprint Dey Street. Released on October 28, 2014, Poehler touched on the subject of her divorce, though she refused to dive into specifics as it was too sad and too personal.\n\nIn the memoir, she wrote,\n\nâWhen you are a person going through a divorce, you feel incredibly alone, yet you are constantly reminded by society of how frequently divorce happens and how common it has become.â\n\nShe also mentioned fellow comic Louis CK as a friend who helped her through the divorce, acting as her relationship sponsor.\n\nDo Amy Poehler and Will Arnett Have Any Kids Together?\n\nBefore their separation and eventual divorce, Amy Poehler and Will Arnettâs marriage was blessed with two sons; Archibald âArchieâ William Emerson, born in October 2008 and Abel James, born in August 2010. Despite their divorce, Amy and Will have raised their two children together, staying on good terms together.\n\nIn her memoir, she expressed gratitude toward her ex-husband, remarking on how grateful she was that he was their father. Though saddened by the divorce, she also expressed her belief that their ten years together as husband and wife wasnât a waste.\n\nAmy Poehler lives with her sons in Los Angeles. She praised her childrenâs nannies for helping take care of her kids, giving her the chance to balance her career and family.\n\nWho is Amy Poehler Currently Dating?\n\nAmy Poehlerâs onscreen boyfriends and love interests have included the likes of Paul Rudd, Will Ferrell, and Ike Barinholtz over the years, but who is she dating at the moment in real life?\n\nFollowing the divorce, several rumors began floating as to who Amy Poehler had started dating. The only substantial bit of news in all the rumors was when she began dating fellow comedian Nick Kroll. In her memoir, Poehler expresses gratitude to Kroll for being around to support her during the trying times of going through the divorce.\n\nâI have a boyfriend who knows how to settle me,â Amy said of Nick in her memoir, on Us Weekly. âHe puts his hand on my chest and tells me boring stories. On one of our first nights together, I woke up apologizing for my snoring, and he pulled out two earplugs he had worn to bed so he could hear what I was saying. It was one of the most romantic gestures I have ever seen.â\n\nShe writes about how he could calm her down whenever she went through a period of high anxiety. The couple began dating in 2013 but would later end their relationship after two years.\n\nAfter Nick Kroll, Amy Poehler began dating lawyer Benjamin Graf. Based in New York City, Graf is an intellectual property lawyer with Merchant & Gould. Amy and Benjamin were spotted taking a hike together in Los Angeles in May 2016.\n\nEven though itâs not quite clear when they began dating, it seems like they were together for a while before they were seen together in 2016.\n\nIt was later confirmed in early 2017 that they were a couple. In mid-2018, reports began to circulate that Amy Poehler had split from Graf. It was later confirmed by an insider that after two years together the relationship had officially ended. As of writing, Amy Poehler is currently single.\n\nAfter the divorce, Poehler and Arnett maintained a friendly relationship to provide a good upbringing to their two kids. It was reported that they were quarantined together in 2020, as they were seen side-by-side together on a Canadian television special called Stronger Together, Tous Ensemble.\n\nncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunCtzLJkqaeVnbmmvoybprKeop6yr7CMpKCdq12jsrV51qipraBdlrSmew%3D%3D\n\nncG1vNJzZmifopZ7tLLObGWdoZeewaK4zpycmqajpa6ksdJnmqilX6OyuL%2BOmqSyZaCksqm4xKtkm6epm7%2Bqsc2dZKShlKh6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqKzxGefraWc"
