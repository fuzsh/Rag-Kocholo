        "text": "When Amy Poehler and Will Arnett tied the knot in 2003, they appeared to be a match made in heaven. However, after welcoming two children together and nine years of marriage, the couple announced their separation in 2012. Arnett filed for divorce in 2014 and it was finalized in 2016 (via CBS News).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking shortly after the breakup, a source told Radar Online that there was \"no malice in the split\" and the couple simply drifted apart. \"Will and Amy started to feel more like best friends than a married couple ... Everyone used to think that because Amy and Will are both comedians their relationship was all fun. However, the laughter stopped a long time ago and now they just want to move on with their lives,\" the source said at the time.\n\nIn the years following, both parties have remained fairly tight-lipped about the details of their split. However, during an appearance on Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert podcast, Arnett touched upon people's reaction to his divorce from Poehler.\n\n\"I'll say this. Somebody actually tagged me on Twitter — a beat reporter for a Minnesota TV station — saying like, 'I don't know about you guys, but I'm Team Amy,'\" he told Shepard (via Showbiz Cheatsheet). \"And I wanted to respond and go, 'We're human beings in a relationship, and our relationship fell apart. It's really sad. It's heartbreaking. We have two kids, and this is not some [effing] game. What are you talking about? You have no [effing] clue what our experience is.\" Arnett revealed that comments like that really bothered him and \"it took me a long time to get over it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her 2014 memoir Yes Please, Amy Poehler opened up about how she coped with the split back in September 2012, revealing she felt \"incredibly alone\" and was \"constantly reminded by society of how frequently divorce happens and how common it has become.\" As HuffPost reports, she wrote, \"Imagine spreading everything you care about on a blanket and then tossing the whole thing up in the air. The process of divorce is about loading that blanket, throwing it up, watching it all spin, and worrying what stuff will break when it lands.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the memoir, the Parks and Recreation star went on to say she was \"beyond grateful\" for Arnett's role as a father (via Closer). \"I am proud of how my ex-husband Will and I have been taking care of our children,\" she wrote. \"I am beyond grateful he is their father, and I don't think a 10-year marriage constitutes failure. That being said, getting a divorce really sucks.\""
