        "text": "“Imagine spreading everything you care about on a blanket and then tossing the whole thing up in the air. The process of divorce is about loading that blanket, throwing it up, watching it all spin, and worrying what stuff will break when it lands.”\n\nShe added: “I don’t think a ten-year marriage constitutes failure. That being said, getting a divorce really sucks.”\n\nSince the split, Arnett has been romantically linked to celebrity chef (and Billy Joel’s ex-wife) Katie Lee and actress Arielle Vandenberg. Poehler, meanwhile, ended her two-year relationship with fellow comedian Nick Kroll in September 2015."
