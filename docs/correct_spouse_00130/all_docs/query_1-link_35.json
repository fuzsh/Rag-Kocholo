        "text": "The “excruciating” pain of Will Arnett’s split from Amy Poehler caused him to break down in tears on his way to set at the time.\n\n“Just brutal, brutal, brutal,” Arnett, 51, told the Guardian of his separation from Poehler, 50, which took place just as the actor was filming Season 4 of “Arrested Development.” “I was driving to the set one day and I pulled over to the side of the road and cried for an hour.”\n\nThe comedy staples wed in 2003, but announced their separation in 2012 after nine years of marriage. They share sons Archie, 13, and Abel, 11.\n\n“People talk about you like they know you and they talk about your relationship as if they know what’s going on,” Arnett added as he discussed breaking up in the public eye.\n\n“So imagine how weird that is. It’s brutal with any relationship, and we have kids,” he continued. “And without getting into specifics, you then see stuff online, like, this one journalist wrote: ‘I’m Team Amy.’ I’m like: ‘You’re a grown person. What are you talking about? This is a breakup. This is a family. This isn’t some game.'”\n\nWhile their divorce was traumatizing for the “Bojack Horseman” star, he recognizes now that, eventually, “you get on with it” as the years pass.\n\n“It’s been almost 10 years and my kids are so lucky that Amy is their mother,” Arnett said of the “Saturday Night Live” alum. “And I’m so lucky that we’re such a huge part of each other’s lives, even more so than we were five years ago.”\n\nArnett and girlfriend Alessandra Brawn welcomed son Alexander Denison Arnett in May 2020.\n\nPoehler briefly spoke of their split in her 2014 memoir, “Yes Please,” writing, “I don’t want to talk about my divorce because it is too sad and too personal. I also don’t like people knowing my s–t.\n\n“I will say a few things. I am proud of how my ex-husband, Will, and I have been taking care of our children; I am beyond grateful he is their father; and I don’t think a [nearly] 10-year marriage constitutes failure. That being said, getting a divorce really sucks.”"
