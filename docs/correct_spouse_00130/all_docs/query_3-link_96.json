        "text": "A surprise shared appearance on the Canadian fundraiser Stronger Together, Tous Ensemble has the public wondering what’s up with ex-spouses Amy Poehler and Will Arnett? Are they back together?\n\nHere’s what we know.\n\nLast night, Stronger Together, Tous Ensemble boasted a bunch of Canadian celebrities banding together to entertain while raising money for Food Banks Canada. Justin Bieber, Celine Dion, Michael Bublé, Barenaked Ladies, Sarah McLachlan, Eric McCormack, Howie Mandel, Kiefer Sutherland, Margaret Atwood and the cast of Schitt’s Creek all made appearances. But the segment that got tongues wagging involved Poehler and Arnett, who appeared in one shot, one house, not social distancing.\n\nAfter a 10-year-marriage and having two sons together, the couple split in 2012. However, in the segment, they suggested they’ve been quarantining together. THR reports Arnett was appearing in his own living room, where he jokingly confessed he hadn’t showered in a month before saying it didn’t matter. Then, Poehler pops into frame and says, “Actually, it kind of does, Will.”\n\nDoes this mean they’ve reconciled? Plenty on Twitter were pondering. However, it’s far more likely the two decided to pull a Brue Willis/Demi Moore, quarantining together as a blended family. Presumably, Poehler and their two sons, Archie and Abel, are living—for now—with Arnett and his girlfriend Alessandra Brawn, who is pregnant with the couple’s first child.\n\nThis sounds like the premise of an inevitably pitched pilot, full of wacky antics and modern familial anxieties. However, Poehler and Arnett’s split was amicable by all accounts. When their relationship came to an end, an insider told Radar, “Will and Amy started to feel more like best friends than a married couple. They drifted apart, like a lot of couples do, but there’s no malice in the split, nor was anyone else involved.”\n\nPoehler doesn’t speak to the press about her love life. However, in her book Yes, Please, she shared:\n\n“I am proud of how my ex-husband Will and I have been taking care of our children. I am beyond grateful he is their father, and I don’t think a ten-year marriage constitutes failure. That being said, getting a divorce really sucks.”\n\nAs for Arnett, he recently spoke about the challenges of divorce, and how for celebrity couples, that includes the public taking sides. On Dax Shepard’s podcast, Armchair Expert, the BoJack Horseman star shared:\n\n“Somebody actually tagged me on Twitter. This woman, she was a beat reporter for a Minnesota TV station, saying like, ‘I don’t know about you guys, but I’m Team Amy.’ And I wanted to respond and go, ‘We’re human beings in a relationship and our relationship fell apart. It’s heartbreaking. We have two kids, and this is not some f***ing game. And what are you talking about? And you have no f***ing clue of what our experience is.’”\n\nUltimately, a shared segment on a fundraiser isn’t enough to suggest the divorced couple is reconciling publicly while Arnett’s pregnant girlfriend stays out of frame, out of mind. Far more likely: Poehler and Arnett are considerate co-parents who realize whatever heartache and stress there may be, they are—as the hashtag says—Stronger Together."
