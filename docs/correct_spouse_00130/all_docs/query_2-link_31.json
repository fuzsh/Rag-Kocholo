        "text": "Actor Will Arnett has filed for divorce from his wife, \"Parks and Recreation\" star Amy Poehler, more than a year and a half after they announced their separation, EW.com reports. Arnett filed papers with the Los Angeles Superior Court and is seeking joint legal and physical custody of their two sons, Abel and Archie, as well as visitation rights. The couple, who married in 2003, announced their separation in September 2012. The divorce will be the first for Poehler and the second for Arnett, who was previously married to actress Penelope Ann Miller."
