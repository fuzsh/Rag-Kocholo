        "text": "The 25th Annual Thunder By The Bay Music & Motorcycle Festival is proud to announce two headline acts performing live on stage at next year’s Festival – 38 Special (February 18 at 8 p.m.) and Colt Ford (February 19 at 8 p.m.). The iconic three-day Festival, organized by and benefitting Suncoast Charities for Children, is scheduled for February 17-19 at the Sarasota Fairgrounds. Discounted general admission tickets and limited VIP tickets go on sale November 1. Continuous live music will be featured throughout the weekend, and attendees are encouraged to bring lawn chairs and blankets for outdoor seating in front of the stage. Support acts include Nuthin Fancy (Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute), H2H (AC/DC Tribute), Bobby Friss, Maiden Cane, Nobody’s Fool, and Twinkle and Rock Soul Radio. The Festival plans to feature over 100 vendors, a 17-class bike show, a motorcycle stereo sound off competition, motorcycle freestyle demonstrations, a tented full bar area with seating, a “little riders” kid zone, a food court, “Thunder Alley” inside Robarts Arena and so much more! On Sunday, February 19, a “United We Ride – America Strong” charity motorcycle ride will once again take place honoring veterans, active duty military, and first responders. The ride will begin at Adrenaline Harley-Davidson and end at the Sarasota Fairgrounds. Four additional fundraising events will take place in advance of the traditional Festival. They include a “Taste of Thunder” tequila tasting/food pairing experience, Sporting Clay Tournament, a Thunder By The Bay “Rocks The Runway” Fashion Show, and “Born To Be Wild” Festival Kickoff Party. In 2022 the Festival raised $267,000, which enabled Suncoast Charities for Children to provide financial support to The Haven, Loveland Center, Children First, The Florida Center for Early Childhood, Special Olympics, Venice Challenger Baseball, and the Suncoast Foundation. Over the past 23 years, Thunder By The Bay has raised $2.3 million to help local children, teens, and adults with special needs. Presenting sponsors include Adrenaline Harley-Davidson and S&S Motorsports. Major Sponsors include FCCI Insurance Group and Sarasota Ford.
