Sporting events, concerts, and other performances are showcased throughout the year at arenas across North America including iconic venues like the Barclays Center in Brooklyn or The T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The term arena is typically used to describe a large, multipurpose indoor venue that hosts a variety of events ranging from concerts to shows and even hockey, basketball, and indoor football games. One particular genre of rock, arena rock, took its name from the loud, flashy concerts that bands like Poison, Def Leppard and Aerosmith played in the 1970s and 1980s. One of the earliest examples of arenas comes from the Latin term “harena” which described the sand-covered floors of venues like the Colosseum in Rome, which hosted chariot races and other spectator events.\n\nOne popular arena in the United States is Madison Square Garden which hosts nearly 320 events every year.
