        "text": "[Grant Awarded] Operation Warrior Resolution Awarded $25,000 Grant by the Community Foundation of Sarasota\n\nBarbie Heit, barbie.heit@srqme.com\n\nOperation Warrior Resolution has been awarded a $25,000 grant from the Community Foundation of Sarasota County to support veterans and their family members as they transition out of programs designed to provide holistic mental health services to resolve trauma and promote long-term wellness. During week-long retreats, Operation Warrior Resolution provides veterans with brain-based healing techniques and alternative therapies like yoga, meditation, and equine therapy. This funding will be used to support program participants' ongoing needs after participating in the retreats so they can continue to integrate and sustain these changes into their lives moving forward.\n\nSince 2018, Operation Warrior Resolution has been helping veterans heal by providing mental health therapy and brain-based healing techniques, also known as The Cortina Method. Kendra Simpkins, founder and CEO, and her team are known as innovators in the space of mental health for veterans. Simpkins, who saw an immense need for this type of support in the veteran community, started the nonprofit with a personal mission to give veterans effective and immediate care.\n\nWhen Simpkins, a veteran herself, came out of active duty in 2010, she was in a dark place, struggling with addition and feeling lost. After spending years searching for resources, she decided to build a team, spread the word and get good fundraising. From there, Operation Warrior Resolution was born. Over the past few years, Operation Warrior Resolution has helped over 100 veterans through their retreat program and almost one thousand veterans and their families through other activities and events in the Sarasota area. The organization is funded through grants, donations, and fundraisers so everything is at no cost to the veteran and their family. Operation Warrior Resolution also partners with local businesses to provide discounts on services for veterans.\n\nPictured: Previous grant recipients, their families and Operation Warrior Resolution team members.

To support the foundation’s mission of introducing the sport of pickleball to youth, veterans and first responders, The Play for Life Foundation began donating Club-N-Boxes in2022to qualified organizations, including schools, fire and rescue departments, police departments, youth organizations and nonprofits. Each box contains nets, paddles, balls, and instructional material on how to play and set up a court. Most recently, the foundation received a request for a Club-N-Box from Captiva Island Fire Control Station 181 in Lee County to provide much-needed stress relief and camaraderie for the first responders dealing with devastation from Hurricane Ian.\n\n“It is so humbling and fulfilling to use the sport of pickleball to support our community in being healthier by having fun,” said Valerie McCarthy, executive director of the foundation. “Like our name suggests, we hope people use these donations to become players for life and enjoying this wonderful sport, the fastest growing all across the country.”\n\nOther highlights from 2022 include a donation to James Tillman Elementary School in Manatee County, where coaches are now using the donated equipment to implement pickleball into the physical education curriculum. The philanthropic foundation donated a box to the Bradenton Police Department, which is now being used by officers for community outreach, team building and physical fitness training. All 10 East Manatee Fire Rescue Stations received Club-N-Box deliveries. After a donation to Bay Haven School of Basics Plus, the school started a pickleball club with the new equipment. Other organizations that received donations last year included Girls Inc. of Sarasota, and multiple branches of the Boys & Girls Clubs. Also notable in 2022, the Play for Life Foundation received recognition from the Community Center of Sarasota County as a Giving Partner. The foundation relies on local businesses and individual support for most of its funding for the Club-N-Boxes. This year, Play for Life has a goal of donating 50 Club-N-Boxes.

One by one, other women joined the journey, and together their mission empowers women to change the face of philanthropy in the local community. In 2023, Impact100 SRQ is celebrating its 5th giving year, having already funded 15 grants aggregating a total of $1,637,000 donated to local nonprofits since 2019.\n\nThe Impact100 SRQ model is simple. Every year, at least 100 women come together, each make a $1,000 tax-deductible donation, and collectively they fund grants in increments of at least $100,000 to local nonprofits in five focus areas: Arts, Culture & History; Education; Environment & Recreation; Family; and Health & Wellness.\n\nThe women of Impact100 SRQ combine their time, talent, and treasure, to make a greater impact in strengthening the community. Every year nonprofits in Sarasota and Manatee Counties are invited to apply for an Impact100 SRQ grant. All Impact members are encouraged to volunteer their time on a committee to impartially review and extensively evaluate each initiative. These committees then determine finalists from each focus area to present to the full membership for a final vote to decide collectively which grants will be funded.\n\nAll members of Impact100 SRQ are encouraged to design their own experience. As an all-volunteer organization, there is an opportunity for members to get involved as much or as minimally as they desire. Most importantly and uniquely, all members have a voice in deciding which grants will be funded.\n\nThe passion that the women of Impact100 SRQ share for problem solving in our community is extraordinary. The more women who join the organization, the more grants Impact100 SRQ can fund. Joining is open to all women of all backgrounds, all ages, and all stages of life.\n\nGail Lisi Vice President Membership GailL@Impact100SRQ.org www.Impact100SRQ.org\n\nClick Here To Learn More\n\n[Scholarships] Foundation Accepting Scholarship Applications for 2023-24 School Year\n\nGulf Coast Community Foundation (Gulf Coast) is now accepting applications for its 2023-24 scholarship program.

This substantial award will help advance Sarasota Orchestra’s mission to engage, educate and enrich the community through high-quality, live musical experiences by funding the purchase and repair of instruments specifically designated for the Orchestra’s education programs. Over the years, the Sarasota Youth Orchestras and Summer Music Camp have made lasting impacts on the lives of thousands of young people from Sarasota, Manatee and Charlotte counties. Sarasota Orchestra loans instruments and equipment to students in their education programs whose families cannot afford them. Purchasing or renting an instrument could potentially represent a significant financial burden, or even a deterrent, for students wishing to participate in music programs. By loaning out instruments, Sarasota Orchestra is able to offer the joy of music and benefits of music education to all students, regardless of socioeconomic status. The grant funds from Impact100 SRQ will go directly and exclusively toward the purchase and maintenance of education program instruments.
