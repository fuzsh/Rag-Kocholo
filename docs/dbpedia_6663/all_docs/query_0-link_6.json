Discounted tickets will be available beginning November 1 and include free parking.\n\nhttps://thunderbythebay.org/events/\n\nThis iconic festival is organized by, and benefits, Suncoast Charities for Children in support of critical programs\n\nand services for local children, teens, and adults with special needs. In addition to the headliner acts announced,\n\nForeigner Experience, Stormbringer, One Night Rodeo, The Lost Boys, Nobody’s Fool, and KJB will be\n\nperforming the best of classic rock and country music live on stage. The festival will feature over 100 vendors, a\n\nbike show, motocross freestyle demonstrations, Universal Championship Wrestling, activities for the kids, a\n\nfood court, and more for the entire family to enjoy. Thunder Alley will make a return inside Robarts Arena,\n\nshowcasing plenty of custom bikes on display. Sarasota’s own custom bike builder, Kory Souza of Kory Souza\n\nOriginals will be hosting a motorcycle stereo sound-off competition and unveiling a new custom-built\n\nmotorcycle.\n\nOn Sunday, February 18, a motorcycle charity ride called “Ride So Children Can Thrive” will begin\n\nat Adrenaline Harley-Davidson, with stops at several non-profit agencies that receive funding support from\n\nSuncoast Charities for Children, ending at the festival.\n\nA $25,000.00 matching grant has also been announced for the festival thanks to The James M. Doss Charitable\n\nFoundation. Executive Director of Suncoast Charities for Children, Lucy Nicandri, stated: “We are so\n\nappreciative of the generosity that The James M. Doss Charitable Foundation continues to provide. Their\n\nmatching grant during the 2023 Festival helped us raise just over $50,000.00 in support of our mission to serve\n\nindividuals of all ages with special needs. It was also a wonderful way for people to contribute and feel a part of\n\nthe festival, even if they were unable to attend. Our goal is to raise even more in 2024!”"
