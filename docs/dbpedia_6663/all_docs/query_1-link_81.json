        "text": "SARASOTA, Fla. (WWSB) - Sweet smells, along with sweet promises filled the air Saturday at Robarts Arena in Sarasota. It was part of the annual Sarasota County Republican Candidates Rally.\n\nOrganizers said 40 candidates for varying races were on hand to meet and greet voters and supporters.\n\nHeavy police and deputy presence could be spotted both inside and outside the venue throughout the day. The event, fondly referred to now as the “Pie Rally” featured a large selection of home-made pies from Suncoast Amish eateries.\n\nRobert Ludwig was one of many who attended. “The biggest thing for me is the border, and controlling the border, and I’ll support the candidates who support controlling the border and as well as helping out with the financial crisis that we’re in,” the Sarasota native said.\n\nSenator Rick Scott, also facing a re-election run against Democratic challenger Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, was also on hand at the event generating energy for the GOP.\n\nHe said the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump’s life during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania three weeks ago has only strengthened the Republican party in Florida, and nationwide.\n\n“Thank God the president is still alive, we’re going to have a hearing on Tuesday, the acting director of the secret service will be there, and hopefully we’ll get more answers,” Scott said.\n\nThe former Florida governor also believed that the GOP will once again take control of the Senate.\n\n“We will get the majority, I’m running for leader, we have to have a seat change in the Senate, because we need to get things done,” Scott added."
