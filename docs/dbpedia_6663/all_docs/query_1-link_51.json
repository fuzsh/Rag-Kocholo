        "text": "This week the Sarasota County Fair marks its 100th birthday, celebrating the agricultural lifestyle and providing anyone who enjoys fair foods and rides an opportunity for funnel cakes and Ferris wheel views.\n\nBut the question of how many more fairs will take place next to Robarts Arena is murky after the Sarasota County Commission late last year made it a priority in 2024 to examine the \"highest and best use, and best future use\" for the 58-acre property that previous county leaders transferred to a nonprofit organization nearly eight decades ago.\n\nThat organization is governed by a board that includes more than 20 members ranging, from agricultural industry stakeholders, government officials and other community members.\n\nRory Martin, president of the Sarasota County Agricultural Fair Association, said county employees showed up in February requesting access to the property, although he had been aware of the county's focus about a week after the County Commission's priority-setting December meeting.\n\nHe said communication with county officials has been limited for years.\n\n\"I don't know what they (county commissioners) plan,\" he said. \"But they haven't talked to me.\"\n\n'Have to get creative'\n\nCommissioner Mike Moran started the board's fair property discussion as members discussed numerous community issues in a wide-ranging almost six-hour discussion about what county government should focus on in 2024. He sought a staff report that implied county influence over the fate of the fairgrounds property.\n\n“It’s a really specific ask here, but I think it should be a priority, is staff coming back to us with all of the above options for administration and our legal departments to deal with the leadership of the fairgrounds,\" Moran said during the meeting's final half-hour.\n\nHe later clarified his demand by noting he wanted the report to focus on the \"highest and best use and best future use\" for the property as well as \"all the options\" from the legal and administrative departments to deal with the leadership at the fairgrounds.\n\nCounty Administrator Jonathan Lewis then told Moran that he would \"have to get creative\" given the county doesn't own the property and that the land − as well as authority over what development or activities are allowed there − along Fruitville Road east of Tuttle Avenue rests with the city of Sarasota.\n\n\"You can get as crazy as you need to, I don’t care if it’s 50 pages long,\" he said. \"But that’s my thought.\"\n\nOther commissioners also saw the property as a priority and worthy of county focus.\n\n\"I think it’s one of the most impactful pieces of real estate in all of Florida,\" Commissioner Neil Rainford said. \"That’s how big of a deal that is.\"\n\nRainford requested that any report also include information about who's impacted, particularly 4-H, the agriculturally-focused student education organization.\n\nCommissioner Ron Cutsinger said he's always thought about the property's economic potential if it were ever developed.\n\n\"I’ve always looked at that and thought, man if there was a connection there you could just open up ... the opportunities for some really entrepreneurial businesses,\" he said.\n\nCommissioner Mark Smith questioned what ability the county had to influence what happens with the property given that it doesn't currently own the land.\n\n\"That’s what I want to hear,\" Moran said. \"I want to hear what choices we have, because, and I’m not going to play weekend attorney here ... it’s taxpayer property that the fairground uses with a reverter clause back to the taxpayer,\" he said.\n\nA fair purpose\n\nSarasota County deeded over the county fairgrounds to the fairgrounds association in 1947 in a fee simple deed transaction with language to ensure the land is used for public purposes.\n\n\"This deed is given subject to property being used by Sarasota County Agricultural Fair Association for agriculture development in this County and other public purposes, if property ceases to be used for such purposes, title shall revert to the County of Sarasota,\" the deed says.\n\nThe deed also requires the fair association to use the property for public purposes at least every two years.\n\nMartin, the chief executive and president of the fair association, said in addition to holding the county fair, the organization also hosts county job fairs and has allowed the property to be used by Florida Power and Light after hurricanes as a staging area, including during Hurricane Ian.\n\nHe said the county fire department and the Sarasota Police Department also conducts annual drills at the fairgrounds, free of charge.\n\nHe doesn't know what the report will say, or if it will be 50 pages, or how creative it will have to be.\n\nIn his mind, it doesn't matter. The fair association has not ceased to use the property for public purposes for two years. There's only been one year outside of World War II when the fair was cancelled.\n\nThat happened during March 2020 when the fair was forced to cancel its annual March event after some of the earliest cases of COVID-19 surfaced in Sarasota. Martin said he tried to keep the 2020 fair on schedule, even holding a board meeting to vote on the matter.\n\nThe 14-4 vote to keep the fair open resulted in two resignations from the fair board — including Moran — but the decision was taken out of Martin's hands when the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office pulled deputies from participating in fair security.\n\nThe County Commission's seat on the fair board has remained vacant for the past four years.\n\nAny draft reports or reports on the fairground's future were not immediately available.\n\nMoran said in a text message that a report is expected that will include options available to county leadership.\n\n\"At the retreat we directed staff to explore all options we have to help the Fair Board make this property the best it can be for the residents of our community,\" he said in a text message. \"... It will be interesting to see if the community feels the property is being used to its full potential.\""
