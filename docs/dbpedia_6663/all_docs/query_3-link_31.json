        "text": "Favorite Fictional Character: Ferris Bueller\n\nAliases: My wife and I have several secret names for each other depending on the situation.\n\nFavorite Quote: “Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” Ronald Reagan\n\nPet Peeve: Inappropriate public behavior and road rage of any kind.\n\nFavorite Historical Figure: Benjamin Franklin—a Founding Father, inventor, civic activist and diplomat.\n\nFavorite SRQ Music Channel: I like it all, but I especially enjoy 80s alternative rock and anything U2.\n\nFavorite Guilty Pleasure Snack: I do love a good cheeseburger.\n\nFavorite Fictional Character: Niles Crane from Frasier. Intelligent, passionate, neurotic.\n\nAliases: Growing up I always went by Robin, but no one really calls me that anymore because when people see my name for the first time they tend to ask \"Is Robinson your first or last name?\" and having to explain \"My first name is Robinson, but you can call me Robin\" just became too much for me.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"Live every week like it's Shark Week.\"\n\nPet Peeve: Almonds in trail mix.\n\nFavorite Historical Figure: Howard Hughes\n\nFavorite SRQ Office Music Channel: Really anything but silence\n\nFavorite Guilty Pleasure Snack: Queso from Tijuana Flats. I know it's far from authentic, but I could drink it straight.\n\nFavorite Fictional Character: Kitty Foreman or SpongeBob SquarePants\n\nAliases: “Gabby” the perfect nickname for someone who loves to talk a lot.\n\nFavorite Quote: “Your future hasn’t been written yet. No one’s has. Your future is whatever you make it. So make it a good one.” —Doc Brown, “Back To The Future”\n\nPet Peeve: Snoring is something that always bothered me. It’s crazy. I can wake up from somebody snoring but if we have a thunder storm in the middle of the night I will sleep right through it.\n\nFavorite Historical Figure: Rosie the Riveter\n\nHobbies: I love playing pool! I’m no pool shark (…yet) but I have been known to win a few games here and there.\n\nFavorite Guilty Pleasure Snack: Anything spicy! — Hot Cheetos, Hot Fries, Takis… whatever really! I love it so much but my stomach does not.\n\nFavorite Fictional Character: That’s a tough one for me. I don’t really like playing favorites when it comes to anything concerning the nuts and bolts of a piece of art. I can say though that movies are certainly my favorite medium if I had to pick.\n\nA trend I have noticed in myself (to what extent it’s Freudian I am not going to comment) is that I favor male characters that are incredibly pathetic and even tragic types, and I tend to think female characters make for far more interesting “everyman” types nowadays. I guess if we are talking recent movies Riggan Thomson from Birdman, Woody Grant from Nebraska, and “Doc” from Inherent Vice are characters I really enjoy. Likewise Frances Ha from her titular film or Hushpuppy from Beasts of the Southern Wild I both love.\n\nAliases: Wy Guy maybe? My parents told me they tactically picked the name Wyatt because they abhor nicknames. I guess their logic was Wyatt was short enough, rare enough, and weird enough that it would be hard to coin a catchier moniker from.\n\nFavorite Quote: “Whats the difference between ignorance and apathy? I don’t know and I don’t care.” (I have no idea who came up with that but it wasn’t me so I’m calling it a quote.)\n\nPet Peeve: People who are always late. Being late to something is totally fine, but someone acting surprised that they are late when they are always late drives me up the wall.\n\nFavorite Historical Figure: Being completely honest, I almost certainly don’t have one. Not just because there are too many interesting people to choose from (which of course there are), but because I really have a hard time with idolatry in general. I think I’m just bad with favorites, but of course (no biases here right) I think that’s a good thing.\n\nFavorite SRQ Office Music Channel: If pressed I’d have to say whichever one plays Sultans of Swing from the Dire Straits. I’m not big on lyrical music, but I got a soft spot for 70s rock regardless.\n\nFavorite Guilty Pleasure Snack: These awful little things called “Snappers”. They are just these small pretzels completely smothered in caramel and chocolate, and 90% of the time they are all melted together into one huge mass when you go to open the bag. Can’t get enough of those."
