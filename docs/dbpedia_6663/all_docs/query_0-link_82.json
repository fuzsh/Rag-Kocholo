        "text": "The Flying Carrs Circus presents \"Myths & Legends\" brings the magic closer to fans than ever before through dynamic and immersive moments that take place in the air and in the seats at Robarts Arena. Produced by Sarasota native, Krizia Carr, The Flying Carrs Circus is once again elevating the circus show experience with brand-new engaging elements that will fascinate both newcomers and seasoned guests alike. Tickets are on sale now for September 21st - 23rd 2018, go HERE to purchase tickets.\n\nHosted by Johnathan Lee Iverson, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus ringmaster. Johnathan plays the legendary Norse god, Heimdall, who enlivens each performance by welcoming everyone into the magical world of Myths & Legends, setting the stage for a participatory adventure. Guests will embark on a search for clues to find Loki, a cunning trickster who has the ability to change his shape, as well as Thor, god of thunder, and an Amazonian Princess. As each scene unfolds, compelling storytelling will be delivered through multi-level production numbers by elite circus performers, dancers, and acrobats alike.\n\n“Our goal is to deliver performances that captivate and inspire audiences of all ages. This latest production called Myths & Legends, will be focusing on literacy through the art of circus by showcasing some of the world's most iconic legends and bringing them to life,” said Krizia Carr, producer for The Flying Carrs Circus. “We're using books that kids can find (using Accelerated Reader Bookfinder®) as inspiration for each unique act in the show. We're working with the Literacy Council of Sarasota this year to promote a love of reading for all children as well as offering resources at the end of each show for adults who may also need help learning how to read. Roughly 20 percent of adults in Florida lack basic literacy skills, like being able to read a newspaper article. Our hope is to inspire both children and adults to pick up a book based off of our many characters in our show. The excitement will not only happen in front of audiences, but all around them with characters emerging from the stands in unexpected places for one-on-one delightful moments.”\n\nIn high-energy numbers, performers will hype up the crowd through cutting-edge circus choreography. Brave Aerialists in a death-defying Aerial Hair Hang will elevate our circus in their transformation from mermaids to humans, creating a fantastical sequence high above the arena floor. Beautiful Faeries by Sarasota's Russian School of Ballet will captivate the audience with their spellbinding ballet. Gorgeous horses by Sarasota native, Gino Zoppe, will enliven the scene in a fast-pace, trick-riding action and will also showcase his Pegasus and Unicorns throughout this mythical performance. The Valkyrie of the Flying Trapeze will mesmerize audiences, defying all laws of gravity. Creative costume design and fabrication will enhance the scenes as the show imitates life in legendary times.\n\nMyths & Legends will feature a collection of Norse, Greek, and Roman characters fans know and love portrayed by decorated performer-athletes who push the boundaries of what is possible. Their theatrical talents combined with this innovative production elevates the live entertainment experience and will leave families with memories that will last a lifetime. A portion of the proceeds go to the Literacy Council of Sarasota. Visit Flying Carrs Circus for shows and dates.
