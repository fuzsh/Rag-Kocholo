        "text": "Sunshine From Darkness will present “Step Into the Light,” a free mental health wellness event, on Oct. 28 from 9 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. at Robarts Arena in Sarasota.\n\nThe event will feature keynote speaker Linda Larsen and other mental health experts in addition to interactive experiences and resources to promote mental health wellness.\n\n“Our hope is that the summit will empower attendees to learn new coping skills, promote mental health wellness in their unique environments, and reduce the stigma surrounding mental illness,” Sunshine from Darkness executive director Marlene Hauck said.\n\nStep Into the Light is a learning opportunity for clients, clinicians, parents, advocates, and anyone interested in mental health wellness, organizers said.\n\nLarsen will speak on “Breaking the Silence: One Woman’s Ongoing Journey to Mental Well-Being.” Larsen believes in the power of engaging in critical conversations about mental health. Much of her life was shrouded in fears that drove her to the brink of suicide several times, including the day she was taken hostage by an escaped convict and held at gunpoint for six hours – a life-changing experience that dramatically shifted her perspective about life and death.\n\nOther scheduled speakers represent organizations that include the Yale School of Medicine, Resilient Retreat, Johns Hopkins Children’s Hospital, Florida Department of Health/Sarasota County, NAMI Sarasota and Manatee Counties, and Sarasota County Health and Human Services. The topics will include anxiety, depression, children’s mental health, generational trauma, and guidance on navigating the mental health system."
