        "text": "Into every person's life comes a little bad karma, I suppose. With me, it's the local concert scene's nasty habit of taking two acts I'm itching to see and scheduling them on the same night. A few years ago it was Bonnie Raitt and Stevie Wonder. There have been several other occasions, but I guess I've buried the painful memories. This month, on Aug. 24, it's an odd twosome that collide: James Brown _ the newly freed, legendary father of funk _ and Jesus Jones, a band that is taking rock in a beguiling high tech meets strong songs direction. For most, there would be no dilemma. Largely, these acts draw from distinct audiences. But I find the conflict particularly vexing.\n\nI told Jesus Jones leader Mike Edwards of my problem in a recent phone interview, leaving out that I was leaning toward JB (not that Edwards, being an erudite sort, would argue). He had a novel solution. \"Time travel,\" he quipped, laughing.\n\nThere are other shows of merit this month _ Fishbone, Lollapalooza, On-dekoza, Beausoleil, Tanareid, Kenny Drew Jr., Vince Gill _ but I'm preoccupied with the 24th, when you'll probably find me wandering around Central Avenue in St. Petersburg muttering something like, \"Beam me up, Scotty.\"\n\nToday, Theresa Sudah with the Kenny Drew Jr. Trio _ Here's a chance to catch some first-rate jazz for free at Coachman Park in Clearwater. Kenny Drew Jr. is the top jazz pianist in the bay area, probably in the state. He won the piano competition at the most recent Jacksonville Jazz Festival. The artful Sudah has been singing on the local scene for a number of years. Drew's trio will team with Sudah for what should be a special evening. 7 p.m.\n\nToday, Helmet _ The grungy alternative rock group plays the Ritz Theater in Ybor City. Jawbox opens at 10 p.m.\n\nToday, Jimmy Cliff _ The reggae veteran, who always has infused his music with a pop flair, plays Jannus Landing, with Frontline Massive opening at 8 p.m.\n\nSaturday, Fishbone _ A manic mixture of metal, punk, ska, gospel, blues, fusion-jazz and just about anything else, Fishbone is a pop band that is nearly impossible to categorize. That's probably why the L.A. outfit has remained a cult item thus far. The group's crazed stage show has become the stuff of legend. The female rap group Bytches with Problems opens at the Ritz Theater, 10 p.m.\n\nSaturday, Badlands _ One of the latest entries in the hard-rock sweepstakes, Badlands plays the Rock-It Club at 7 p.m.\n\nAug. 7, The Headlights _ The guys in the Headlights probably have mixed feelings about playing Club Detroit. For a good while the group has been one of bay area's Most Likely to Graduate to the Big Time. And the quartet got a strong shot in the arm as the backup band (and occasional opening act) for ex-Byrd Roger McGuinn during his spring solo tour. Playing a local club probably has a nice homecoming air, but I doubt the Headlights want to make it a habit again. Clang opens at 9 p.m.\n\nAug. 8, New Titans on the Block _ Thrash, death-metal and grind-core fans can hardly do better than this package tour including Sepultura, Sacred Reich, Napalm Death and Sick of it All. Ritz Theater, 8 p.m.\n\nAug. 8, Food for Feet _ Bassist John Avila and drummer Johnny Hernandez, who lay down the taut, springy grooves for Oingo Boingo, take a more cerebral approach on their side project, Food for Feet. With guitarist Tovar and guest percussionist, they make smooth pop-rock with traces of ethnic styles and world music. Ritz Theater, 9 p.m.\n\nAug. 9, The Contraband Tour _ Yet another package tour winds its way through the bay area; this one including hard-rockers Ratt, L.A. Guns, Bang Tango and special guest Michael Schenker. The show will close with a set by the all-star aggregation Contraband, which includes members of all but Bang Tango. USF Sun Dome, 7:30 p.m.\n\nAug. 11, Eddie \"The Chief\" Clearwater _ The long-unheralded blues musician resurfaces for a show at Skipper's Smokehouse. The Kingtones open at 7 p.m.\n\nAug. 13, Pato Banton _ The reggae artist, who laces his music with international touches, is becoming a fixture on the area concert scene. He'll play Skipper's Smokehouse with Up-Rising opening at 8 p.m.\n\nAug. 15, Kathy Mattea and Vince Gill _ Two of contemporary country's more revered artists team up for a double bill at Ruth Eckerd Hall. Mattea is among the new group of neotraditionalist singers. Gill's smooth tenor voice is miles removed from the prototypical boozy country crooner. His instrumental work, mostly on guitar, is remarkable. 8 p.m.\n\nAug. 17, Tanareid Trio _ The State Theater welcomes the type of honest-to-goodness swinging jazz that you might encounter at a Manhattan nightclub. Drummer Akira Tana and bassist Rufus Reid are two of the most in-demand players in acoustic jazz. They'll be joined by pianist Rob Schneiderman. 9 p.m.\n\nAug. 17, Beausoleil _ Michael Doucet (Do-SAY), leader of Beausoleil (Bo-so-LAY), is not only one of Cajun music's most talented fiddlers, he has become a spokesman for the Southwest Louisiana style on the international front. But Doucet is no staunch purist. He once made an album of garage-rock classics sung in French. His band mixes the traditional fiddle and accordion with electric instrumentation. Beausoleil always swings and is a great party band. It'll be another steamy Cajun-zydeco fest at El Pasaje Plaza in Ybor City, 8 p.m.\n\nAug. 18, Steel Pulse _ The British group specializes in catchy pop-inflected reggae. Jannus Landing, 8 p.m.\n\nAug. 18, Dave Koz and Phil Perry _ The saxophone/vocal tandem will bring their jazzy R&B stylings to the State Theater, 9 p.m.\n\nAug. 20, Lollapalooza _ Word has it that Lollapalooza is a kind of rolling Woodstock for the '90s, featuring a diverse mixture of bands with alternative leanings. It's also a consciousness-raising effort, with exhibits from Greenpeace and the like. The lineup includes Jane's Addiction, Living Colour, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Nine Inch Nails, Ice-T, B-Hole Surfers and Henry Rollins. The event starts at 1 p.m. at the Central Florida Fairgrounds in Orlando.\n\nAug. 20, Joanna Conner _ The blues singer/guitarist plays the State Theater. The Sarasota Slim Band opens at 9 p.m.\n\nAug. 23, A Flock of Seagulls _ It seems a bit soon for early '80s \"new wave\" to have produced nostalgia bands, but it's hard to view the Flock as anything else. They scored with the synthesizer-heavy I Ran (So Far Away) and essentially faded. The band may indeed see itself as a contemporary force but has done nothing recently to prove it. Ritz Theater, 9 p.m.\n\nAug. 24, James Brown _ The Godfather of Soul has been sprung, and he's gettin' busy. JB started with a pay-per-view special in June, just recently put out a new, self-produced album, Love Over-Due (Scotti Bros.), and is out touring like the Hardest Working Man in Show Business, one of his many appellations. As a concert primer, pick up the four-disc retrospective Star Time (PolyGram). Essential listening. Bayfront Center, 8 p.m.\n\nAug. 24, Jesus Jones _ The British act builds its taut pop-rock around dance-heavy drum machines grooves, and a melange of computer sound samples, fleshing it out with ringing guitar and piercing vocal harmonies. A heady, and catchy, mixture. Jannus Landing, 8 p.m.\n\nAug. 24, Warrant _ Peas in a pod. Warrant, Trixter and Firehouse _ all are mainstream, lowest-common-denominator bands from the hard-rock ranks. Florida State Fairgrounds Expo Hall, 7:30 p.m.\n\nAug. 24, Little Eva, The Buckinghams and others _ The National Music Foundation (formerly the Foundation for the Love of Rock 'n' Roll), which is still doggedly pursuing its goal of establishing a retirement home for aging rock 'n' rollers, stages this benefit oldies show featuring Little Eva (The Loco-Motion), the Buckinghams (Susan, Kind of a Drag), the Dovells (Bristol Stomp), Spencer Davis (Gimme Some Lovin', don't expect Steve Winwood on hand to sing), Johnny Farina of Santo & Johnny, Little Peggy March and Johnny Thunder. The concert will be at the Robarts Arena in Sarasota, 8 p.m. For an extra few bucks, the organizers will throw in a meet-the-stars party after the show. Call 398-2860 in Seminole for information.\n\nAug. 24, Yesterday _ The stars from the musical Beatlemania come together nowadays as Yesterday. At the State Theater, in St. Petersburg, 9 p.m.\n\nAug. 25, The Moody Blues _ Formed in the early '60s, the Moody Blues have made some of the most ethereal sounds in rock annals. They've ridden commercial highs, endured some stiffs, made good music and bad, produced acknowledged classic songs (Nights in White Satin) and albums (Days of Future Passed) broke up, re-formed, changed personnel _ all the usual stuff that happens to bands that last for more than a quarter-century. Sun Dome, 8 p.m.\n\nAug. 30, Ondekoza _ I saw this 11-member Japanese drum ensemble at The Pier earlier this year and was knocked out by its power and musicality. The group has a few drums in its arsenal that you could turn sideways and use as a big trampoline. The endurance that these young musicians possess is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nThe bay area duo Yuko Daiko, consisting of husband Asoka and wife Lorraine Compton, will open the show at the Octagon Arts Center in the Unitarian Universalist Church in Clearwater.\n\nThe fund-raiser for community station WMNF-FM (88.5) begins at 8 p.m. Call 238-8001 (Tampa)."
