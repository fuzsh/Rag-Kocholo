        "text": "[Politics] Ballard, Smith, Neunder Win County Commission contests\n\nJacob Ogles, jacob.ogles@srqme.com\n\nManatee County Commissioner Reggie Bellamy was booted from office, the last casualty of a conservative takeover on the board that started two years ago. Republican Amanda Ballard defeated the incumbent.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Mark Smith came out on top just barely in a Sarasota County Commission race over Democrat Fredd Atkins. That victory came despite Democrats holding a voter registration advantage in a county commission race for the first time in more than a half century.\n\nState Rep. Fiona McFarland, R-Sarasota, comfortably won a second term, winning by nearly 11 percentage points over Democratic challenger Derek Reich in an evenly divided district\n\n\"It’s an honor to serve the people of Sarasota, and I’m humbled to continue the mission. We have big work ahead of us but tonight we celebrate and reflect on our successes across the state,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, a Sarasota County sales tax won renewal with about almost 78% of voters coming out to support the levy.\n\nA national red tide seemed to reach to local level races, guaranteeing all state lawmakers representing Sarasota or Manatee counties will be Republican in the next session. Republican Reps. Tommy Gregory and Mike Beltran both won re-election in Manatee County House seats.\n\nAt the federal level, U.S. Reps. Vern Buchanan, R-Longboat Key, and Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, also won low-profile contests, and likely will join a new Republican majority in the U.S. House.\n\nThe same goes for the entire county commission for both board. Beyond the Ballard win in Manatee County Commission District 4 and Smith win in Sarasota County Commission District 2, Republican Joe Neunder won a Sarasota County Commission District 4 seat with 58.3% of the vote.\n\nOn the Sarasota City Commission, incumbent Jennifer Ahearn-Koch was the top vote-getter in an at-large contest, with Debbie Trice winning a seat as well while Dan Lobeck came in last place after making the three-candidate runoff. Rick Howard and Nick Pachota won seats on the Venice City Council and Philip Stokes secured a spot on the North Port City Commission.\n\nIn Manatee elections, Cindy Spray won a seat on the School Board after a District 2 runoff. Lisa Gonzalez Moore came out on top in a Bradenton City Council race in Ward 4 while Marianne Barnebey was re-elected in Ward 2. Sunshine Matthews won a Palmetto City Commission race.\n\n[First Responders] The Play For Life Foundation Donates Club-N-Box Pickleball Sets to First Responders\n\nBarbie Heit, barbie.heit@srqme.com\n\nEarly next year, The Pickleball Club, a brand-new, healthy living, private pickleball complex will be opening in Lakewood Ranch. Eager to give back to the community in which they live, the Club's owners, Brian and Valerie McCarthy started The Play For Life Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to three key categories: the youth, veterans and first responders, who are often at an increased risk for stress-related physical and mental illnesses. The Play for Life Foundation’s mission is to introduce the sport of pickleball to qualified organization by granting a Club-N-Box, containing nets, paddles, balls, and instructional material on how to play and setup a court.\n\nOn October 28th, National First Responders Day, the Foundation donated its 31st Club-N-Box portable pickleball set to the Bradenton Police Department.\n\n“We are very appreciative of Play For Life's donation, and plan to use the Club-N-Box for community outreach programs throughout the year, as well as for fun team building and physical training activities for our Officers and Bradenton Police Explorers Post No.1004,” said Bradenton Police Department Assistant Chief Joe Wiesman.\n\nThe West Manatee Fire Rescue Station was a recent recipient of a Club-N-Box. \"You can't believe how much fun it is giving one of these boxes to our local firefighters,\" says Brian McCarthy, founder of The Pickleball Club and chairman and president of the Foundation. \"They move the fire engine out, open up the doors, set up the court and they start playing pickleball in the firehouse. It is so cool to see.”\n\n“My husband Brian and I started the Play For Life Foundation to be an extension of The Pickleball Club and be able to give back to our community so that they can improve their healthy lifestyle with a fun sport that can be enjoyed by all ages,” said Valerie McCarthy, executive director of the non-profit organization. “We hope these donated sets will not only provide athletic enjoyment for the Bradenton Police Department, but also be a way for officers to relieve stress.”\n\nPictured: From left to right: Sergeant Aaron Pilant, Officer Josh Sanchez, Officer Zachary Butterfield, Assistant Chief Joe Wiesman, Bradenton Police Department.\n\nTo learn more, visit\n\n[Board Institute] Gulf Coast Community Foundation Announces Fall Board Graduates\n\nTwenty community leaders from across the region graduated October 28 from the 2022 Fall Gulf Coast Board Institute (GCBI).

The association was provided a $50,000 grant from Gulf Coast Community Foundation’s Hurricane Ian Relief Fund and is nearly half-way to their goal of enough funding to support all members who experienced tragedy following the storm. The officers shared that while they were ensuring our community was safe after the storm, they were unsure of the safety of their own families and homes. One officer in particular shared that after helping rescue others, he had to travel home by airboat to see what was left of his own livelihood. Many are unsure how they will pay for the damages to their homes and some are without homes at all. Gulf Coast was honored to meet the boots on the ground who are working every day to uplift and rescue our region.\n\nPictured: NPPOA 24.

Their dreadful, centenarian grandfather is an emotional and financial tax on the family, and he just won’t die.
