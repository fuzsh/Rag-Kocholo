On Sunday, February 18, a motorcycle charity ride called “Ride So Children Can Thrive” will begin

at Adrenaline Harley-Davidson, with stops at several non-profit agencies that receive funding support from

Suncoast Charities for Children, ending at the festival.

A $25,000.00 matching grant has also been announced for the festival thanks to The James M. Doss Charitable

Foundation. Executive Director of Suncoast Charities for Children, Lucy Nicandri, stated: “We are so

appreciative of the generosity that The James M. Doss Charitable Foundation continues to provide. Their

matching grant during the 2023 Festival helped us raise just over $50,000.00 in support of our mission to serve

individuals of all ages with special needs. It was also a wonderful way for people to contribute and feel a part of

the festival, even if they were unable to attend. Our goal is to raise even more in 2024!”
