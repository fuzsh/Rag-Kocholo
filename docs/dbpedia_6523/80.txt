Humidity

We base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.

The chance that a given day will be muggy in Leipzig is essentially constant during May, remaining around 0% throughout.

For reference, on July 25, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 3% of the time, while on October 11, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.

Wind

This section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.

The average hourly wind speed in Leipzig is essentially constant during May, remaining within 0.2 miles per hour of 8.4 miles per hour throughout.

For reference, on January 17, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 12.0 miles per hour, while on August 6, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour.

The lowest daily average wind speed during May is 8.2 miles per hour on May 30.

The hourly average wind direction in Leipzig throughout May is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 39% on May 31.

Growing Season

Definitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).

The growing season in Leipzig typically lasts for 6.5 months (200 days), from around April 12 to around October 29, rarely starting before March 25 or after April 30, and rarely ending before October 8 or after November 24.

The month of May in Leipzig is very likely fully within the growing season, with the chance that a given day is in the growing season gradually increasing from 91% to 100% over the course of the month.

Time Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in May in Leipzig

frigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering

Growing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.

The average accumulated growing degree days in Leipzig are increasing during May, increasing by 255Â°F, from 138Â°F to 392Â°F, over the course of the month.

Solar Energy

This section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.

The average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Leipzig is gradually increasing during May, rising by 0.7 kWh, from 5.4 kWh to 6.2 kWh, over the course of the month.

Data Sources

This report illustrates the typical weather in Leipzig, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.

Temperature and Dew Point

There are 5 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Leipzig.

For each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Leipzig according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.

The estimated value at Leipzig is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Leipzig and a given station.

The stations contributing to this reconstruction are:

Leipzig-Halle Airport (EDDP, 84%, 8 mi, northwest, 85 ft elevation change)

Holzdorf (ETSH, 7%, 45 mi, northeast, -115 ft elevation change)

Dresden Airport (EDDC, 4.1%, 62 mi, east, 377 ft elevation change)

HofâPlauen Airport (EDQM, 2.8%, 76 mi, south, 1,581 ft elevation change)

Karlovy Vary Airport (LKKV, 2.5%, 82 mi, south, 1,611 ft elevation change)

To get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Leipzig and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.

Other Data

All data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.

All other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.

Land Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

Elevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

We draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.

We further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.
