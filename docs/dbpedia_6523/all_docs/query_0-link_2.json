In Leipzig, the chance of a wet day over the course of May is rapidly increasing, starting the month at 20% and ending it at 27%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 31% on July 14, and its lowest chance is 18% on April 10.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during May in Leipzig is increasing, starting the month at 1.3 inches, when it rarely exceeds 2.4 inches or falls below 0.4 inches, and ending the month at 1.9 inches, when it rarely exceeds 3.4 inches or falls below 0.8 inches.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of May in Leipzig, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 25 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 2 minutes, 49 seconds, and weekly increase of 19 minutes, 46 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is May 1, with 14 hours, 52 minutes of daylight and the longest day is May 31, with 16 hours, 17 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Leipzig is 5:42 AM on May 1 and the earliest sunrise is 42 minutes earlier at 5:00 AM on May 31.\n\nThe earliest sunset is 8:33 PM on May 1 and the latest sunset is 43 minutes later at 9:16 PM on May 31.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Leipzig during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during May, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 4:53 AM and sets 16 hours, 37 minutes later, at 9:30 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:13 AM and sets 7 hours, 51 minutes later, at 4:04 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation.\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in May in Leipzig\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in May in LeipzigMay112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMAprJun001010202020303040405050600001010202030303040405060\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nMoon\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for May 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in May in Leipzig\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in May in LeipzigMay112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMAprJunApr 88:22 PMApr 88:22 PMApr 241:50 AMApr 241:50 AMMay 85:23 AMMay 85:23 AMMay 233:54 PMMay 233:54 PMJun 62:38 PMJun 62:38 PMJun 223:09 AMJun 223:09 AM6:23 AM6:23 AM7:49 PM7:49 PM8:05 PM8:05 PM5:52 AM5:52 AM5:15 AM5:15 AM9:50 PM9:50 PM9:40 PM9:40 PM5:01 AM5:01 AM4:10 AM4:10 AM10:09 PM10:09 PM9:49 PM9:49 PM4:26 AM4:26 AM\n\nMay 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 50%3:22 AMSE11:25 AMSW-7:23 AMS232,757 mi 2 41%3:45 AMESE12:53 PMWSW-8:18 AMS230,374 mi 3 30%4:02 AMESE2:22 PMWSW-9:10 AMS228,284 mi 4 19%4:16 AME3:49 PMW-10:00 AMS226,688 mi 5 11%4:29 AME5:17 PMW-10:49 AMS225,791 mi 6 4%4:42 AMENE6:47 PMWNW-11:39 AMS225,763 mi 7 1%4:57 AMENE8:18 PMWNW-12:30 PMS226,698 mi 8 0%5:15 AMENE9:50 PMNW-1:24 PMS228,588 mi 9 3%5:41 AMNE11:16 PMNW-2:21 PMS231,303 mi 10 8%6:16 AMNE--3:20 PMS234,614 mi 11 15%-12:31 AMNW7:06 AMNE4:18 PMS238,222 mi 12 23%-1:27 AMNW8:10 AMNE5:14 PMS241,807 mi 13 33%-2:07 AMNW9:24 AMNE6:06 PMS245,078 mi 14 42%-2:34 AMNW10:41 AMNE6:54 PMS247,803 mi 15 50%-2:53 AMWNW11:56 AMENE7:37 PMS249,817 mi 16 62%-3:07 AMWNW1:08 PMENE8:18 PMS251,032 mi 17 71%-3:18 AMWNW2:19 PME8:57 PMS251,431 mi 18 80%-3:28 AMW3:28 PME9:36 PMS251,057 mi 19 87%-3:38 AMW4:38 PME10:15 PMS250,006 mi 20 93%-3:48 AMWSW5:49 PMESE10:55 PMS248,407 mi 21 97%-4:00 AMWSW7:04 PMESE11:39 PMS246,412 mi 22 99%-4:14 AMWSW8:22 PMSE-- 23 100%-4:33 AMSW9:40 PMSE12:28 AMS244,178 mi 24 100%-5:01 AMSW10:56 PMSE1:21 AMS241,852 mi 25 98%-5:40 AMSW-2:18 AMS239,558 mi 26 93%12:00 AMSE6:37 AMSW-3:19 AMS237,387 mi 27 87%12:50 AMSE7:49 AMSW-4:20 AMS235,395 mi 28 78%1:25 AMSE9:13 AMSW-5:19 AMS233,609 mi 29 67%1:50 AMSE10:40 AMWSW-6:15 AMS232,044 mi 30 50%2:08 AMESE12:07 PMWSW-7:07 AMS230,718 mi 31 44%2:23 AMESE1:33 PMW-7:56 AMS229,674 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Leipzig is essentially constant during May, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 25, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 3% of the time, while on October 11, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Leipzig is essentially constant during May, remaining within 0.2 miles per hour of 8.4 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on January 17, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 12.0 miles per hour, while on August 6, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour.\n\nThe lowest daily average wind speed during May is 8.2 miles per hour on May 30.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Leipzig throughout May is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 39% on May 31.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Leipzig typically lasts for 6.5 months (200 days), from around April 12 to around October 29, rarely starting before March 25 or after April 30, and rarely ending before October 8 or after November 24.\n\nThe month of May in Leipzig is very likely fully within the growing season, with the chance that a given day is in the growing season gradually increasing from 91% to 100% over the course of the month.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in May in Leipzig\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Leipzig are increasing during May, increasing by 255Â°F, from 138Â°F to 392Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Leipzig is gradually increasing during May, rising by 0.7 kWh, from 5.4 kWh to 6.2 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Leipzig are 51.340 deg latitude, 12.371 deg longitude, and 377 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Leipzig contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 187 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 378 feet. Within 10 miles also contains only modest variations in elevation (381 feet). Within 50 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (1,962 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Leipzig is covered by artificial surfaces (98%), within 10 miles by cropland (54%) and artificial surfaces (33%), and within 50 miles by cropland (66%) and trees (19%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Leipzig, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 5 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Leipzig.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Leipzig according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Leipzig is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Leipzig and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nLeipzig-Halle Airport (EDDP, 84%, 8 mi, northwest, 85 ft elevation change)\n\nHolzdorf (ETSH, 7%, 45 mi, northeast, -115 ft elevation change)\n\nDresden Airport (EDDC, 4.1%, 62 mi, east, 377 ft elevation change)\n\nHofâPlauen Airport (EDQM, 2.8%, 76 mi, south, 1,581 ft elevation change)\n\nKarlovy Vary Airport (LKKV, 2.5%, 82 mi, south, 1,611 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Leipzig and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
