        "text": "Up-to-date climate graphs are available for the parameters temperature, precipitation and sunshine duration. The climate data from the past year (365 days or 12 months) are presented on a daily as well as monthly basis and, wherever possible and reasonable, against the background and in comparison with the corresponding long-term means and extremes. The graphs are updated each day / month.\n\nAir temperature\n\nTo the top\n\nDaily values\n\nThere are two graphs for showing (a) the daily means of air temperatures and (b) the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures from the past 365 days. The black lines indicate the mean values for the reference period. The actual values for each day are given as deviations from the long-term mean, with positive deviations of the maximum and daily mean temperatures (=warmer) shown in red, negative deviations (=colder) in blue. The range between the absolute maximum and minimum of daily mean temperatures and the extreme temperatures of the reference period is marked in grey to illustrate the width of temperature variation during the reference period. If the deviation reaches beyond the grey area (upward (red) and downward (blue)), this means that a new record was reached on that day.\n\nPlease take note of the explanations relating to the reference periods (length of the period), which may differ from parameter to parameter.\n\nExample 1: Daily means of air temperature\n\nWhat the graph shows: Warmer-than-normal days (red) alternate with days that are tool cold (blue). Often, there are several days in a row which were warmer or cooler than normal. Mostly, these are spells of weather resulting from large scale weather patterns. In the example, the red spells are predominant; they last longer and their deviation from the average is more pronounced than for the blue areas. This is particularly evident for December 2015: the large red area indicates that during that month, there were hardly any colder-than-normal days. November and August, too, as well as a few other months show only small bits of blue. Only October 2015 has a more distinct spell of cooler-than-normal weather conditions. The annual period presented in the graph was too warm.\n\nThe graph illustrates an interesting feature of our climate: the range between absolute highest and absolute lowest daily means of air temperatures (displayed as grey area) is wider in the cold season than in summer. This means that in winter, the daily means vary over a range of around 30°C, from +10°C to about -20°C. In summer, however, the fluctuation is barely more than 15°C.\n\nIn July and August and also in November and December 2015, a few red peaks reach up to or beyond the edges of the grey area, which means that on these days, this station's daily mean temperatures were warmer than ever before in the 65-year reference period. In October 2015, however, the blue tip, too, slightly projects beyond the grey area, which means that the daily mean values were colder than ever before in the reference period.\n\nExample 2: Daily maximum and minimum air temperatures\n\nWhat the graph shows: With two different parameters included in one graph, the information content is much higher and more complex than is the case for the daily mean temperature. Here, too, the continuous change between red (too warm) and blue (too cold) bits is clearly evident. Red generally means that daytime temperatures were warmer than the average, the blue areas illustrate the days on which the temperatures at night were colder than normal compared to the average over the reference period. When looking at the sequence of temperatures, it becomes apparent that red and blue areas alternate most of the time, but some days also show both colours. Separate occurrence of the coloured areas indicates that the prevailing air masses were overall warmer or cooler than normal, i.e. it was too warm during the day but not too cold at night on the one hand or too cold at night but not too warm during the day. On some days, however, it was both warmer than normal during the day and also too cold at night, with the effect that red peaks coincide with blue tips (e.g. on some days in the middle of February, in the middle of April and at the beginning of November 2015). On these days (mostly very clear days or nights without clouds), the daily temperature range, i.e. the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature, was particularly wide.\n\nThe distance between the black lines representing the mean maximum and minimum temperature is much smaller in winter than in summer. This indicates the seasonal differences in the diurnal temperature range: while in summer, a large difference between maximum and minimum temperature is quite usual, the diurnal variation is much smaller during the winter. Remarkable is that in winter, the temperature fluctuations on one single day are more or less small, whereas the temperature differences between warm and cold days or spells of weather can be more significant than in summer. The width of the grey area in the background visualises this graphically: it illustrates the span between the highest absolute maximum and lowest absolute minimum temperatures of the reference period. In summer, these vary over a span of 25°C; in winter, the span can increase to more than 30°C. So if in the cool season of the year, the differences between the highest and lowest temperatures of one day are rather small as opposed to rather large differences observed when comparing different days, it is not surprising that on some days, the maximum temperatures are lower than the mean minimum temperatures (e.g. October 2015) while other days were so warm that minimum temperatures were higher than mean maximum temperatures (e.g. several occasions in November and December 2015). Such situations are highly unlikely to occur during the summer months.\n\nSome red peaks in July and August and also in November and December 2015 reach up to or even beyond the edges of the grey area, which means that on these days, it was warmer than rarely or never before in the 65-year reference period at this station. On some of the days, new maximum records were set..\n\nTo the top\n\nMonthly values\n\nThe graph contains the monthly mean values averaged over the past 12 months. The mean monthly means for the reference period are shown as black lines, the actual monthly means as deviations from the long-term mean, in red for months that were warmer than normal and blue for those colder than normal. The grey bars represent the range between highest and lowest monthly means for the reference period. If the actual deviation reaches beyond the grey area (upward (red) or downward (blue)), this means that during that month, a new record was set for the monthly mean temperature.\n\nPlease take note of the explanations relating to the reference periods (length of the period), which may differ from parameter to parameter.\n\nExample 3: Monthly means of air temperature\n\nWhat the graph shows: The deviations from the mean values in the reference period are often quite small, only a few months show distinctive coloured areas, which are mostly red.\n\nThe graph shows more red than blue deviations. This is basically in line with the statistical distribution of the deviations of monthly mean temperatures from the long-term mean: warmer-than-normal months are more frequent than colder-than-normal months. On the other hand, in colder-than-normal months, the deviation is often larger than in warmer-than-normal months. This effect is particularly apparent in the cold season; due to it, the grey bars, which represent the full range of the actual monthly mean temperatures, are larger for the cool months than for the warm months.\n\nHowever, the above example does not support the proposition that the deviations from the long-term mean are often larger for colder months than those for warmer months: especially the warmer-than-normal months, which are already more frequent, also feature the largest deviations from the mean value. While in August and November, the deviation is close to the upper end of the grey bar, it exceeds it by far in December. This means that at this station, December 2015 has by far been the warmest December since 1888, whereas August and November 2015 range among the warmest of their series.\n\nThis frequent occurrence of large positive temperature anomalies is 'abnormal' and as such very unusual as it reflects the extraordinary temperature conditions of 2015, which has been the warmest year worldwide and the second-warmest in Germany since measurements began.\n\nTo the top\n\nPrecipitation\n\nTo the top\n\nDaily values\n\nOne of the graphs shows the daily precipitation totals from the past 365 days. As climate data on precipitation for each calendar day of the year are highly random, they are not included in this graphical representation.\n\nExample 4: Daily precipitation totals\n\nWhat the graph shows: Daily precipitation totals are unevenly distributed over the whole period. Phases of frequent precipitation alternate with periods of reduced precipitation. Longer periods of dry weather can be identified in February, April and May 2015. The graph does not show whether winter precipitation fell as rain or as snow, only the amounts of precipitation are given.\n\nAt first glance, it appears that during the period shown, this weather station recorded no significant heavy precipitation events: all precipitation totals are in the lower part of the scale.\n\nTo the top\n\nMonthly values\n\nThe graph contains the monthly precipitation totals from the past 12 months. The mean monthly totals for the reference period are shown as black lines, the actual monthly totals appear as green bars. If the upper end of a green bar is below the mean value line, this means that the month was too dry; if the green bar reaches beyond the mean value line, the month was too wet. The range between the highest and lowest monthly totals of the reference period is represented as a light grey bar. If the green bar is shorter than or reaches beyond the upper end of the light grey bar, a new record for monthly precipitation totals was set in that month.\n\nPlease take note of the explanations relating to the reference periods (length of the period), which may differ from parameter to parameter.\n\nExample 5: Monthly precipitation totals\n\nWhat the graph shows: The grey bars and the mean precipitation lines (black lines) show that the cold months received much lower precipitation amounts than were recorded for the warm months: the most precipitation fell in the summer half-year. This annual distribution pattern of precipitation is typical for places at lower altitudes. At mountain stations, the seasonal differences in the distribution of precipitation amounts are inverted: on average, they receive the most precipitation in the winter half-year (see, for example, the graph for Brocken weather station).\n\nWhat strikes is that the black lines for mean monthly precipitation totals are mostly not in the middle of the light grey bars, but often are clearly shifted towards lower values. Wetter-than-normal months are less frequent than months that are too dry, but the deviation from the normal can be much greater in their case.\n\nIn the example, the upper ends of the green bars, which represent the actual amounts of precipitation in each month, are mostly clearly below the black mean precipitation lines, i.e. below normal precipitation. January 2015 is the only month in which actual precipitation amounts were slightly higher than average. The other eleven months shown partly received far too little precipitation, with extreme and near-extreme precipitation deficits in May and February, respectively. As a matter of fact, at this station, the year 2015 was one of the driest years of the 65-year reference period.\n\nTo the top\n\nSunshine duration\n\nTo the top\n\nDaily values\n\nOne of the graphs shows the daily sunshine duration from the past 365 days. The black line indicates the mean values for the reference period. The actual values for each day are shown as yellow bars. If the upper end of a yellow bar is below the mean value line, this means that the day was less sunny than normal; if the yellow bar reaches beyond the mean value line, the day was sunnier than normal. Daily sunshine duration varies between 0 (= no sunshine) and the astronomically possible sunshine duration varying with the course of the year.\n\nThe maximum values of daily sunshine duration recorded during the reference period are shown as thin grey bars all merging into one grey area. If a yellow bar reaches beyond the grey area, this means that a new record for sunshine duration was set on that day.\n\nExample 6: Daily sunshine duration\n\nWhat the graph shows: The overall unsteady impression of this graph results from the large width of variation among the measured values and the values' rapid changes. The graph shows frequent periods of weather with sunshine duration most of the time above or below the normal. No-sunshine periods of several days duration (sunshine duration = 0) are about as rare as periods of unhindered, maximum possible sunshine.\n\nThe maximum possible sunshine duration is limited by the astronomical day length. Longer reference periods recurrently include days on which actual sunshine duration is very close to the astronomically possible sunshine duration. For this reason, new records for daily sunshine are fairly rare.\n\nThe annual variation is remarkable in terms of the relation between mean sunshine duration (black line) and maximum sunshine duration (upper edge of the grey area): whereas mean sunshine duration in summer is about the half of maximum sunshine duration, it goes down to less than a third of the maxima in winter, although these are half as high as in summer. It appears from this that sunshine duration in winter, which is lower for astronomical reasons, is furthermore considerably reduced due to larger cloud cover.\n\nTo the top\n\nMonthly values\n\nThe graph contains the monthly sunshine duration values from the past 12 months. The mean monthly values for the reference period are shown as black lines, the actual monthly values appear as yellow bars. If the upper end of a yellow bar is below the mean value line, this means that the month received little sunshine; if a yellow bar reaches beyond the mean value line, the month was very sunny. The range between the highest and lowest monthly totals of the reference period is represented as a light grey bar. If a yellow bar is shorter than the light grey bar (i.e. the upper end is in the dark grey area), this month was duller than ever before; if a yellow bar reaches beyond the fair grey bar, a new record for monthly sunshine duration was set in that month.\n\nPlease take note of the explanations relating to the reference periods (length of the period), which may differ from parameter to parameter.\n\nExample 7: Monthly sunshine duration\n\nWhat the graph shows: The graph is dominated by strong yellow bars. In two out of three months, they reach beyond the mean value line, which means that these months were sunnier than it would have been expected from the average over the 30-year reference period. The ends of the bars are well away from the upper and lower ends of the light grey bar parts, which means that there is some distance to the observed extremes. The graph shows a year with overall much sunshine, with the monthly values giving no hints about particularities worth mentioning in terms of sunshine duration.\n\nThe grey bars (long-term means) show that sunshine duration is three times higher in summer than in winter. The range between the most sunniest and the least sunniest extreme values recorded for a month is also impressive: across the whole 65-year reference period, July values at this station show a span of 250 hours. Despite this, sunshine duration in the least sunniest months in summer is still as high as values which are recorded only in the most sunniest of the winter months.\n\nTo the top\n\nExplanatory notes on the reference periods\n\nThe time series of mean and extreme values are processed using different methods and selection criteria. For this reason, the periods of analysis may vary widely.\n\nWhenever possible, the analysis of mean values is based on the reference period 1981–2010, the analysis of extreme values on the longest measurement series available.\n\nTo the top\n\nAccess to the climate data"
