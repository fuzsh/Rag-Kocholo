        "text": "We are here to assist you with preparations for your arrival in Leipzig.\n\nAccommodation\n\nPlease check our Accommodation webpage for an overview of our trusted accommodation providers and book a room with one of them directly.\n\nIf you have any questions about the booking process, please contact studentaccommodation@lancasterleipzig.de.\n\nWhat to Pack\n\nYou’ll need to label your luggage, pack all necessary belongings and bring along important documents including your completed immunization forms, medical records, prescriptions, academic transcripts, and your passport and student visa. You should also carry important bank documents and copies of any agreements for accommodation.\n\nDocuments\n\nProof of identity (Passport or ID card)\n\nOriginal transcripts/Graduation Diploma (original language/certified translations)\n\nProof of English language qualification\n\nProof of valid health insurance\n\nHealth and vaccination records (if available)\n\nContract with your accommodation provider\n\nFor under 18 students:\n\nA copy of your birth certificate (translated into English/German if necessary)\n\nCopies of your parents’ passports\n\nA consent form signed by both parents that you are allowed to apply for a residence permit (sample will be provided by LU Leipzig staff at the Compliance webinar)\n\nClothing\n\nLeipzig is located directly in the transition zone from the oceanic to the continental climate zone. The seasons are characterised by differences in temperature and weather. The summers are warm and hot, the winters are cold and frosty. Temperatures between -2° at night and 4° during the day are normal from December to February. Spring comes to Leipzig in March. In summer (June to August) it is usually 24°-30°. Autumn begins in Leipzig in September. The coldest month is January with an average maximum temperature of 6° and an average minimum temperature of -5°. It rains more or less throughout the whole year.\n\nAs the weather in Leipzig differs according to the season you would need both light and warm clothing, as well as waterproof/wind-proof jackets. The dress code on campus is informal. We advise you to bring clothing appropriate for professional and special social functions as well.\n\nSuggested Items\n\nAvoid bringing excess items that can be purchased once you arrive. Listed below are items students suggest you bring because of expenses and for convenience:\n\nExtra eyeglasses or contact lenses and fluid.\n\nTraditional or special medicines packaged and wrapped – medicines you need should be in your carry-on luggage in case your luggage is lost.\n\nPhotos, slides, maps, flags, artefacts, clothing typical of your country that can be used to share your culture with other students.\n\nMedical history from your home country physician (translated into English and/or German).\n\nYou will need bedding and personal items, but it is best to purchase them after you arrive.\n\nMost importantly, don’t worry if you discover that you’ve forgotten to bring something with you. There are plenty of shops nearby if you need some unexpected essentials.\n\nTravel adaptor\n\nFor Germany there are two associated plug types, types C and F. Plug type C is the plug which has two round pins and plug type F is the plug which has two round pins with two earth clips on the side. Germany operates on a 230V supply voltage and 50Hz.\n\nYou should bring a travel adaptor to make sure that your laptop and phone chargers are compatible when you first arrive.\n\nPlanning your Expenses\n\nLeipzig, when compared to other German cities such as Berlin, Munich, or Frankfurt, is much more affordable when it comes to cost of living (accommodation, food shopping, going out etc.). You can enjoy your student life here without having to miss out on any of the buzz or culture. Find more information on estimated student expenses.\n\nPaying by Card or in Cash?\n\nWhile you can pay by card in various shops, restaurants and coffee shops, you will need cash when visiting places like Farmer’s Market, buying a famous ‘bratwurst’ on the street or a coffee in the park. It is always good to have some cash on you. There is a cash machine on the ground floor in Strohsack Passage.\n\nOpening a Bank Account\n\nOnce you have arrived in Leipzig and registered with the City of Leipzig, we would advise you to open a German bank account (Girokonto). In Germany, it is common to use your debit card as not all stores or companies will accept a Visa or Master card. Once you have opened a German bank account, you will be able to withdraw money from your banks’ ATMs (Geldautomat) without being charged. You can also perform other monetary transactions after you have opened your account. Especially in small restaurants or for daily purchases (bakeries, supermarkets etc.) only cash and on occasion debit cards are accepted in Germany. Transportation tickets can be purchased using cash or your debit card. A German bank account will also be needed as some health insurance companies or landlords may insist on the direct withdrawal of payments from your German bank account.\n\nOpening a bank account in Leipzig can be done either online or in person (usually by appointment). There are many different banks in Leipzig to choose from among them Deutsche Bank, Sparkasse, Commerzbank and many more. There are also online bank providers such as DKB, comdirect, N26 and ING DiBa which usually offer phone support only. One advantage is that they offer free cash withdrawals from other banks’ ATMs as well.\n\nIf you have only limited knowledge of German or an English description is not available, it might be advisable to open an account in person. While not all bank employees will be comfortable conversing in English, bigger banks usually have at least some employees fluent in English, so asking for an English-speaking employee is recommendable.\n\nDocuments you will need include:\n\npassport/ visa\n\ncity registration document\n\nLancaster University Acceptance Letter\n\nAs a Lancaster University Leipzig student, you might qualify for a student bank account, so make sure you will bring your Lancaster University Acceptance Letter with you when opening a bank account. Two aspects you should pay attention to before signing a contract is whether there is a minimum amount that needs to be deposited into your account every month and whether the bank allows overdrafts.\n\nIn case you misplace your bank card, or it gets stolen, make sure you call your bank immediately and report your loss. Every bank also has a 24-hour emergency number for an incident like this."
