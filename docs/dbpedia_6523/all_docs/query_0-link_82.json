These beers are aged with the intention of developing unique attributes imparted by the wood, or liquids that had previously been stored in contact with the wood. Wood-aging does not necessarily impart wood flavors, but does result in distinctive sensory outcomes. Used sherry, rum, whiskey, tequila, port, wine, and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to a beer. A balance of flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel results from the marriage of new beer with attributes imparted by the wood or barrel. Categorizing these beers can be complex. Sour versions which do not exhibit attributes typical of Brettanomyces are categorized as Wood-Aged Sour Beer. Wood-Aged Beers which exhibit sensory attributes typical of Brettanomyces alone, or of Brettanomyces and other microbes, are categorized as Brett Beer or Mixed-Culture Brett Beer respectively. Wood-aged versions of various classic India Pale Ales are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale. Belgian-style ales that exhibit attributes of wood-aging are categorized as Other Belgian Ale or within other Belgian categories. Various fruited Belgian-style beers that exhibit attributes of wood-aging are categorized as BelgianStyle Fruit Beer; similarly, Saison aged in wood and which exhibits attributes of wood-aging is categorized as Specialty Saison.\n\nWhen using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as length of time aged, type of wood or barrel, age, char level or previous liquids held by the wood, ingredients or other processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes.

A silky or full mouthfeel may contribute to overall flavor profile.\n\nAdditional notes: Grist may include oats, wheat, or other adjuncts to promote haziness. Lactose may be used to enhance body and balance. Lactose should not lend to, or overwhelm, the flavor character of these beers. The term ‘juicy’ is frequently used to describe taste and aroma hop-derived attributes often present in these beers which result from late, often very large, additions of hops. A juicy character is not required, however. Likewise the term ‘hazy’ is frequently used to describe the appearance of many examples of these beers. However, some versions may exhibit very low cloudiness. Other hop-derived attributes such as citrus, pine, spice, floral or others may be present with or without the presence of juicy attributes. These beers can exhibit astringency and heat (sometimes referred to as ‘hop burn’) as a result of very high hop usage rates and excessive contact time in beer, which can detract from balance and drinkability when present above low levels. Versions of this style brewed with darker malts, non-traditional ale yeasts, fruits, spices, or other flavorings are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale.\n\nOriginal Gravity (°Plato) 1.067-1.087 (16.5-21 °Plato)\n\nApparent Extract/Final Gravity (°Plato) 1.009-1.016 (2.3-4 °Plato)\n\nAlcohol by Weight (Volume) 6.00%-8.40% (7.60%-10.60%)\n\nBitterness (IBU) 30-80; may differ significantly from perceived bitterness\n\nColor SRM (EBC) 2-7(4-14 EBC)\n\nAmerican-Style Barley Wine Ale\n\nColor: Amber to deep red/copper-garnet\n\nClarity: Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures\n\nPerceived Malt Aroma & Flavor: Caramel or toffee malt aroma attributes are often present.

Diacetyl, DMS, and Brettanomyces should not be present. The evolution of natural acidity at medium-low to high levels develops a balanced complexity and is expressed as a refreshing, pleasant sourness, in harmony with other attributes. The acidity present is usually in the form of lactic, acetic, and other organic acids naturally developed with acidiﬁed malt in the mash or in kettle or post wort fermentation and is produced by various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and attributes of age. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived ﬂavors such as vanillin should not be present. There should be no residual ﬂavors from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry.\n\nBody: Low to high\n\nAdditional notes: Beers exhibiting wood-derived characters or characters of liquids previously aged in wood are categorized as Wood-Aged Sour Beer.

A small amount of yeast haze is acceptable and traditional.\n\nPerceived Malt Aroma & Flavor: Varies depending on the underlying style\n\nPerceived Hop Aroma & Flavor: Varies depending on underlying style. Low level attributes typical of late or dry hopping may be present in some versions.\n\nPerceived Bitterness: Varies depending on underlying style\n\nFermentation Characteristics: Low levels of sulfur and acetaldehyde or other volatiles normally scrubbed during fermentation, if present, can enhance the flavor of these beers. Low fruity esters may be present and may vary slightly from the underlying style due to age and the presence of yeast. Diacetyl is usually absent in these beers but may be present at low levels in keller versions of beer styles which can contain diacetyl when fully aged, such as Bohemian-Style Lager.\n\nBody: Varies depending on underlying style\n\nAdditional notes: Kellerbier or Zwickelbiers are unfiltered versions of lager or ale styles of European origin. These can include traditional Helles, Dunkel, Dortmunder, Vienna, Rotbier, Bohemian, European Dark, Koelsch, Alt, as well as less common traditional or contemporary European-origin lager and ale styles. Carbonation may be below levels typical of the underlying beer style, which may result in decreased head retention. These beers are typically unfiltered, but they may be filtered and then redosed with yeast. Whether filtered or unfiltered these beers are packaged and served with very low to moderate amounts of yeast.\n\nWhen using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information should include the underlying European-origin lager or ale style upon which the entry is based. Competition organizers may create subcategories which reflect groups of entries based on ale or lager yeast type or hue.\n\nOriginal Gravity (°Plato) Varies with style\n\nApparent Extract/Final Gravity (°Plato) Varies with style\n\nAlcohol by Weight (Volume) Varies with style\n\nBitterness (IBU) Varies with style\n\nColor SRM (EBC) Varies with style\n\nBelgian and French Origin Ale Styles\n\nBelgian-Style Table Beer\n\nColor: Gold to black.

Traditional versions do not use artiﬁcial sweeteners nor are they excessively sweet. More modern versions can incorporate sweeteners such as sugar and saccharin added post fermentation for additional sweetness and to increase smoothness.\n\nBody: Low\n\nAdditional notes: These beers may contain malted barley, wheat, and rye as well as unmalted wheat, rye, oats, and corn. Though not common, flavorings such as coriander or orange and lemon peel are sometimes added, but are barely perceptible. The mouthfeel is light to moderate, and sometimes boosted with unfermented sugars/malt sugars. Low carbonation and aftertaste are typical.\n\nOriginal Gravity (°Plato) 1.008-1.023 (2.1-5.8 °Plato)\n\nApparent Extract/Final Gravity (°Plato) 1.002-1.008 (0.5-2.1 °Plato)\n\nAlcohol by Weight (Volume) 0.40%-1.60% (0.50%-2.00%)\n\nBitterness (IBU) 5-15\n\nColor SRM (EBC) 5-50(10-100 EBC)\n\nBelgian-Style Session Ale\n\nColor: May vary widely\n\nClarity: Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures\n\nPerceived Malt Aroma & Flavor: Very low to low, exhibiting a wide range of malt-derived attributes\n\nPerceived Hop Aroma & Flavor: Very low to low, exhibiting a wide range of hop-derived attributes\n\nPerceived Bitterness: Very low to low but sufficient to balance other attributes\n\nFermentation Characteristics: Phenolic spiciness may be absent or may be present at low levels.

Diacetyl should not be present.\n\nBody: Very low to low\n\nAdditional notes: Beers in this category recognize the uniqueness and traditions of Belgian brewing, but do not hew to any other Belgian-style categories defined in these guidelines. The most notable characteristic that these beers share is a modest alcohol content ranging from 2.1% – 5% abv. These beers can be lower gravity formulations of their own, or can be produced from second run wort from the production of higher gravity beers. Balance is a key component when assessing these beers. Wood-aged or fruited versions will exhibit attributes of wood-aging or fruit(s) in harmony with overall flavor profile.\n\nWhen using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include an underlying Belgian beer style not otherwise defined in these guidelines or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients (fruit(s), etc.) or processing (wood-aging, etc.) which influence perceived sensory outcomes.\n\nOriginal Gravity (°Plato) 1.018-1.04 (4.5-10 °Plato)\n\nApparent Extract/Final Gravity (°Plato) 1.002-1.01 (0.5-2.6 °Plato)\n\nAlcohol by Weight (Volume) 1.70%-4.00% (2.10%-5.00%)\n\nBitterness (IBU) 5-35\n\nColor SRM (EBC) May vary widely\n\nBelgian-Style Speciale Belge\n\nColor: Gold to light copper\n\nClarity: Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures\n\nPerceived Malt Aroma & Flavor: Malt aroma should be low.
