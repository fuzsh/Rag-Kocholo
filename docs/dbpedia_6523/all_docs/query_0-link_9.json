        "text": "ABOUT LEIPZIG\n\nLeipzig is located in the East of Germany, in a low-lying area in the north-western part of Saxony by the rivers Elster, Pleisse and Parthe. Its average altitude above sea-level is 118 m. Leipzig currently has about 500,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe city covers an area of 297.6 km2 and enjoys a generally relatively mild climate. The mean temperature in Leipzig in August/September is around 18 degrees Celsius.\n\nLeipzig is a traditional focus of traffic infrastructure. Having grown as a trade-fair and commercial centre at the crossroads of two military and commercial routes, today more than ever the city focuses traffic routes from all directions. So there are numerous ways of getting to Leipzig, including the Leipzig/Halle airport. Its schedule includes direct flights from/to big European cities such as London, Istanbul, Rome, Madrid, Barcelona, Milan or Vienna as well as some long distances destinations.\n\nVisitors who come to Leipzig for a conference will hopefully be able to spend some leisurely hours and dive into the charms and attractions of the host city: the unique flair, the whole variety of things to do and to see: from the concert in the Gewandhaus Concert Hall to a relaxed pub crawl in the evening. Visitors should not miss the architectural gems of Renaissance, Baroque and Art Nouveau, the openness and hospitality of Leipzig people.\n\nThere are only few cities which have such a rich musical tradition as Leipzig. Johann Sebastian Bach was the choirmaster of St. Thomas Church from 1723 to 1750. The house where Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy died can be visited in Leipzig. The story of Robert and Clara Schumann is inseparably linked with Leipzig, and Richard Wagner was born in the city in 1813. Don’t miss such an opportunity to discover this brilliant city at the same time as the rich scientific and\n\neducational programmes of the Congress.\n\nClimate and Clothing\n\nThe mean temperature in Leipzig in August/September is around 18 degrees Celsius.\n\nCommunication\n\nFor international calls to Germany, dial the international code +49 and the correspondent’s number (without the 0).\n\nCredit cards / Cash machines\n\nAll major credit cards are accepted widely, but not everywhere. If in doubt, ask in advance. Cash-oncard services are available from selected American Express, Diners Club, MasterCard and VisaCard addresses. These cards are also accepted by all GWK currency exchange outlets and Change Express Offices.\n\nCurrency\n\nThe local currency is the Euro (EUR/?). 1 Euro =100 cents\n\nCustoms\n\nPlease consult the German Customs Regulations:\n\nElectricity\n\nThe voltage in Germany is 220 volts. Hotels may have a 110-volt or 120-volt outlet for shavers, but travellers are advised to bring a power converter and an adapter for two-prong, round-prong plugs with side grounding.\n\nEmergency numbers\n\nFor all emergencies, please dial 112.\n\nLanguage\n\nGerman is the national language of Germany. The official congress language will be English.\n\nPublic transportation\n\nPublic transport in Leipzig is characterized by a dense light-rail system. 13 tram lines serve a transport area of about 152 kilometres, complemented by more than 30 bus lines in large part being en-route in the suburban area. The operating company of tram and bus lines is called \"Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe\" (LVB). The current public transport tariff of „Mitteldeutscher Verkehrsverbund“ (MDV) is valid not only within the city of Leipzig, but also throughout Central Germany. Only one ticket for tram and bus, that means only one common tariff for all trams, buses, suburban trains, regional express trains, regional trains and also hailed scheduled taxis.The bus is certainly a slower transportation but it allows you to enjoy the city views while moving around.\n\nSafety\n\nLeipzig is a safe place but you should take normal, sensible precautions to avoid mugging, bag snatching and pick pocketing. You should be extra vigilant at airports and railway stations. Do not leave valuables unattended. Most shops and all major taxi companies accept credit and debit cards, so there is no need to carry a lot of cash.\n\nShopping\n\nThe most common business hours are Monday through Saturday, from 9.30 to 18.00.\n\nDifferent pharmacies are open around the clock on different days of the week. To find out which pharmacy is open on a particular night, visit the pharmacy nearest to you. It will have a note in the window or on the door listing the address of the emergency pharmacy, or Notdienst. The pharmacy emergency section in the local newspapers also have a list. Note: you might have to ring a bell for attention out of hours, and that there is an additional charge for night and weekend services.\n\nLeipzig Taxis\n\nFor a taxi, call Taxi Direct on:\n\nPhone:+49 341 863 29777\n\nTaxis are available outside Terminal B and outside Leipzig Hauptbahnhof, and will take you to or from the airport in about 30 minutes.\n\nTime\n\nLeipzig follows Central European Time (CET) which is one hour ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and six hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time (EST). At the time of the Conference, summer daylight saving will be in operation which is two hours ahead of GMT.\n\nTipping\n\nYou are not expected to tip on top of restaurant service charges but you can leave a little extra if you feel service warrants it. If there is no service charge, the customer should consider leaving a 10% tip, but this is not obligatory. Tipping taxi drivers is not common practice, but you are expected to tip the porter at top-end hotels.\n\nTravel Insurance\n\nA travel insurance policy to cover theft, loss and medical problems is recommended. The Organising Secretariat as well as ESPEN will not be held liable for illness, accidents or thefts suffered by Participants or Accompanying Persons during the Congress or their stay in Germany before, during or after the Congress. Participants are strongly recommended to seek insurance coverage for health and accident, lost luggage and trip cancellation.\n\nVisas\n\nGermany is part of the European Union. Many visitors can enter the EU countries without a visa. A valid passport is all you need to enter Germany. Check with the German Embassy or Consulate in your own country whether you need a visa. They also have the necessary forms you have to complete. Foreign Embassies in Germany, and German Embassies abroad, at your service:"
