A member of our internal recruitment team will review your credentials against the requirements of the position. If our recruiters find a potential match, they’ll schedule a call to learn more about your skills and experience. Bring your questions — this is your opportunity to learn more about the role and our chance to hear more about you.\n\nStep 2: Assess\n\nDepending on the role, location, and timeline, we may initiate our dialogue with you via telephone, virtual interview, or through a traditional in-person interview. We recognize an interview should serve a mutual benefit. We invite your questions.\n\nStep 3: Offer & On-Boarding\n\nIt's decision time. Offers are generally extended live via telephone from a member of our internal team. (You will receive a communication from a member of our team if you are not selected for a particular role after the interview process has concluded).\n\nOnce you've accepted an offer at Wabtec, you will receive additional details about your on-boarding experience, including access to our online portal to begin the on-boarding process. It’s important to know that a Wabtec offer of employment is contingent upon completing a successful pre-employment check/ background validation. This process differs by country. Please don’t hesitate to ask your recruiter for details.\n\nAt Wabtec, we celebrate diversity and are committed to providing equal opportunity to our employees and applicants. If you are unable or limited in your ability to use our career website as a result of a physical or mental impairment, you can request reasonable accommodations by emailing to: applicationaccommodation [at] wabtec [dot] com. Please reference Application Accommodation in the subject line of the email and include the requisition number for the position in which you are applying. An internal team member will contact you within 48 business hours of receipt to discuss your requested accommodation.\n\n* We will only share information regarding your requested accommodation with those individuals who have a specific need to know.\n\n** Please note that we are unable to respond to requests regarding application status. If you are a potential match for the position in which you’ve applied, you will be contacted by the Talent Acquisition team for further evaluation. You can check your application status through your candidate homepage.\n\nWe Look to Your Talents!\n\nIf you apply, you can be sure that your application will be given full consideration and that the selection process will be based solely on your ability to carry out the duties of the role in which you’ve applied.\n\nIf your ability to carry out a particular job is likely to be affected by a disability, we will take reasonable steps to identify and implement ways of overcoming these difficulties. Final selection for appointment will be on merit and qualification for the role.\n\nThank you for your interest in Wabtec!\n\nEqual Opportunity Employer M/F/D/V"
