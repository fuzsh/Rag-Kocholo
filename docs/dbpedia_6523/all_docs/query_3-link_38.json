        "text": "Discussion\n\nEver since the description of the techniques of MVRp by Alain Carpentier in his famous publication “The French Correction” (11) MVRp has become the gold standard for patients with MR, especially due to degenerative and ischemic pathology.\n\nThe long-term outcomes after MVRp through a sternotomy approach have been excellent and have been reported by a multitude of publications in the literature (12-14). With the increasing use of laparoscopic and thoracoscopic surgery, minimally invasive access was extended to heart surgery as well. There has always been a lot of scepticism regarding the ability of a surgeon to perform the same quality of MVRp through this so-called “limited vision” access when compared to that with the sternotomy approach, thus presumably having a negative impact on the early and long-term outcomes. Our institution, which has contributed immensely to the development and progress of minimally invasive mitral valve surgery, performs all isolated mitral valve surgeries (except for active endocarditis with paravalvular abscess or severe mitral annular calcification) through a right anterolateral minithoracotomy, irrespective of the complexity of repair or left ventricular function. Having one of the largest experiences in minimally invasive MVRp, the present series includes patients undergoing minimally invasive mitral valve surgery, with particular focus on MVRp.\n\nIt is believed that the threshold for MVR as opposed to MVRp is much lower when performing minimally invasive mitral valve surgery. This was, however, not the case in our series. Although the overall repair rate was 81.2%, it included a large number of patients with dysfunctional mitral valve due to infective endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, ischemic MR with severe restriction of leaflets, etc., which are not amenable for repair. Nevertheless, only 45 (1.6%) patients with an initial attempt at repair ultimately required replacement, resulting in a repair rate of 98.4% amongst the valves that were deemed to be highly reparable before surgery. This was similar to the repair rate of 97.5% observed by McClure et al. in 1,000 patients undergoing minimally-invasive MVRp predominantly through a lower hemi-sternotomy approach (15). Such a high repair rate is evidence enough that the minimally invasive approach was not a deterrent for the surgeons to perform MVRp and that the choice of procedure was influenced more by the valve pathology rather than the operative approach. In addition, the rate of conversion to sternotomy in this series was a meagre 1.4%. This was most commonly due to the presence of severe right-sided pleural adhesions or due to development of complications during surgery, which could not be controlled through the mini-thoracotomy incision.\n\nEven though the overall risk profile of patients in this series appears to be relatively low, there were several patients who were obese with significantly reduced left ventricular function. We believe that patient selection should be considered by surgeons during their learning curve. Obesity, an excessively deep thoracic cavity, and chest wall deformities increase the level of difficulty of minimally invasive surgery. An unpublished analysis of 89 patients with body-mass index ≥35 kg/m2 (38.5±4.4 kg/m2) performed in our institution revealed that minimally invasive mitral valve surgery is safe and feasible in obese patients. The rate of conversion to sternotomy was, however, 5.7%, which was higher than that reported in this series. This can be lowered by obtaining a preoperative computed tomographic (CT) scan of the thorax to assess the distance between the mitral valve and right chest wall. It helps the surgeon determine if this approach is possible with regard to the length of the instruments available. Additionally, the skin incision is made slightly longer than usual and only experienced minimally invasive surgeons operate on obese patients in our institute.\n\nAtluri and colleagues showed that patients with LV dysfunction were able to undergo minimally invasive mitral valve surgery with minimal mortality (2.1% vs. 1.7%, P=0.7) and morbidity, which was comparable to that of patients with normal ventricular function (16). Even reoperations in patients with previous aortic valve replacement or coronary artery bypass grafts can be performed with very good perioperative results (7). A preoperative CT scan of the thorax helps to rule out the presence of significant adhesions between the lung and chest wall. In this series, 5% of patients had undergone previous cardiac operations. The surgeries were performed either by clamping the aorta when possible or by inducing ventricular fibrillation under moderate hypothermia when it was not possible to clamp the aorta due to severe adhesions. Thus, with experience, almost every patient requiring isolated mitral valve surgery can be operated upon by this approach.\n\nAnnuloplasty bands or rings were used in all patients undergoing MVRp. A ring annuloplasty is necessary to achieve a durable repair (17). The mean operative, CPB 133.6±68.6 minutes and aortic clamp times 76.4±35.1 minutes ( ) are longer than one would usually encounter in patients undergoing conventional mitral valve surgery for several reasons. Firstly, all surgeons require more time especially during the initial period of their learning curves. We do have one or two surgeons training in this procedure every year. Secondly, many operative steps, which through a conventional approach would normally be performed by an assistant, have to be performed by the operating surgeon. Thirdly, the freedom of movement that one has when operating through a sternotomy is obviously restricted due to a small 5-7 cm area of access. Finally, all minimally invasive mitral valve surgeries in our institution are performed with a single-lumen endotracheal tube. Hence, CPB is established before thoracotomy and continues until pericardial closure and insertion of chest tubes. Despite this, the CPB and clamp times in this series were lower than those recently reported in an elegant meta-analysis on minimally-invasive versus conventional open mitral valve surgery by Cheng et al. The cross-clamp time 95±39 vs. 74±36 minutes and CPB time 144 vs. 111 minutes were significantly increased with mini- versus conventional mitral valve surgery, respectively (18).\n\nIn our series, the 30-day mortality for patients undergoing minimally invasive MVRp was low at 0.8%. The mortality is the same as that reported by McClure and colleagues in very low risk patients (15), but much better than 2.2% published by Galloway and co-workers in 1,601 patients undergoing minimally invasive MVRp for degenerative disease (19). It is also comparable to many contemporary series on MVRp through a sternotomy approach (20).\n\nExcellent long-term outcomes can be achieved with minimally invasive mitral valve surgery. McClure et al. reported an overall survival of 79±3% for minimally invasive MVR and MVRp at 15 years. For MVRp, freedom from reoperation at 5, 10, and 15 years was 96±1%, 95±1% and 90±3%, respectively (15). Galloway and co-workers described an 8-year freedom from reoperation of 91±2% for sternotomy and 95±1% for minimally invasive P=0.24 isolated MVRp (19). In a 10-year follow-up of single-surgeon minimally invasive MVRp for degenerative disease, D’Alfonso and associates reported an overall survival of 98.7±1.2% and freedom from reoperation of 98.5±1.1% (21). These results are comparable with those of MVRp through a conventional sternotomy approach. In their study, Castillo et al. revealed a cumulative survival of 95.6±1.7% and 88.7±2.2% at 4 and 7 years, respectively. Seven-year freedom from reoperation was 94.1±0.5% (20). In a recent publication by David and associates, the freedom from all-cause mortality and reoperation on the mitral valve at 10 and 15 years was 85.8% and 72.5%, and 95.9% and 94.9%, respectively (14).\n\nAlthough the long-term survival rates ( , ) in the present series are not as good as those in the above-mentioned studies, the freedom from reoperation ( ) is excellent and comparable. Direct comparison of observational studies may be misleading, as patient populations are very variable across different. Our series includes not only patients operated on during the development phase of this technique, but also high risk patients with ischemic MR with poor left ventricular function, acute endocarditis, as well as technically challenging patients with Barlow’s disease operated in recent years. Secondly, one or two new surgeons are trained in this procedure every year, thus their learning curves should be taken into account as well. Holzhey et al. have elegantly shown that the complication rate reduces with increasing experience of the surgeon and the institution as a whole (22). Finally, the patients in our series were older than those included in some of the studies mentioned above (15,20).\n\nOne of the main limitations of this study is its retrospective nature and the resultant issues thereof. It is difficult to identify the exact “true repair rate” in a retrospective analysis, as cases in which the surgeons did attempt some amount of repair surgery, but then rapidly converted to replacement without further attempting to wean the patients off CPB, are sometimes not reported as such, either in the operative notes or in the database. However, those patients who undergo a formal repair attempt with annuloplasty, are weaned off CPB and then have to undergo MVR due to an unsatisfactory repair on TEE, are specifically coded in our database. Secondly, the patient population is a heterogenous group with varying causes of MR.\n\nTo conclude, minimally invasive MVRp can be safely performed with encouraging short and long-term outcomes. It is associated with very low rates of conversion to a conventional sternotomy. The failure rate of repairs is extremely low, especially in the hands of experienced surgeons."
