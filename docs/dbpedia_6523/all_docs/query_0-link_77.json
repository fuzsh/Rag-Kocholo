AIXIIIT, dnted April 10, 1905.METEOROLOGY.'Since the discovery of the periodicity of sun spots, a large)lace in scientific literature has been occupied by articles;encling to establish some connection between this and varia-,le terrestrial phenomena. It is natural that it shoulcl benferrecl that any considerable change in the sun must bringtbout nuinerous clirect or indirect consequences upon the!arth, but one who has given the subject no attention will beitartlecl to find that the following list contains but a portion of,he terrestrial phenomena asserted, on more or less authority,,o be influenced by the sun-spot cycle: Magnetic and electricalionditions, including the aurora borealis; air temperature ;)arometric 1mssure ; humiclity ; the wilds; cloucliness ; rain-hll; depth and quantity of discharge of rivers; retreat anddvance of glaciers; number of shipwrecks; bank failures and:ommercial crises; the crops; prices of grain; famines; wars,mcl even flights of butterflies.It woulcl probably be easier to show that the number ofwticles concerning sun spots in scientific periodicals has an.l-year period than to prove all the above-mentioned rela-'ions to the general satisfaction. For the purposes of thislaper i t will be suficient to assume as proven that terrestrialungnetism ancl the aurora borealis are affected when spots,ppear upon the ~n n ; and that while the eviclence is less simpleu regard to the meteorological elements, temperature, baro-netric pressure, humidity, cloudiness, and rainfall, yet theres good reason to think that these, too, are somewhat connectedvith the sun-spot cycle.Pu1:llished 1:iy permission o f the Secretary of the Sniitlisonian Insti-ut.ion.-APRIL, 1902. MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW. 179FIG. l.-Monbpellier observations with Ci-ova self-registering actinometer. Mean of noon, by years, 1883-1900.HUW SUN SPOTS YAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH TERRESTRIAL PHENOMENA.The question before 11s is this: Through what physical con-nection is the presence of sun spots associated with variationsin terrestrial magnetism and with meteorology? The questionsuggests the possibility either of a single or a dual link be-tween the solar and the terrestrial occurrences. It is con-ceivable, for instance, that the sun spots are associated withgreat electro-magnetic clisturbances upon the sun which arepropagated to the earth ancl directly clisturb terrestrial elec-tricity and magnetism, ancl that such a disturbance of ntmos-pheric electricity as thus occurs i n q indirectly induce orprevent the accumulation of clouds, which in turn may bringon differences in temperature, barometric .l)ressure, and rain-fall. Again, it is conceivable that sun spots are associatedwith an increase or a climinution of the suns radiation, whichobviously woiild directly affect meteorology, and indirectlymight affect terrestrial magnetism and electricity. Still againit might be that the sun spots are associated both with greatelectro-magnetic distiirbances in the sun and with an increaseor diminution of solar radiation, and that in this dual way theterrestrial changes are directly brought about.The second of these hypotheses is, I t,liink, untenalde. as anesplanation of the magnetic effects. These are too quick andpronounced to allow us to suppose for a moment that theyare the indirect results of increased or decreased solar radia-tion. We may then aclmit that electro-magnetic disturbancesare propagated from the sun a t the time of sun spots. Itwould be clificult, however, to prove or disprove that theseare competent to indirectly produce the observed fluctuationsof temperature, presaiire, ancl humidity which have been con-nected with the su-spot cycle. Aliiiost without esception.writers on this subject who have ventured an opinion haveattributed these meteorological changes to alterations in theamount of the solar radiation. There seeins to be a prepon-derance of suggestion that the sun radiates more at sun-spotmasimuiii, although there are not wanting many who holdprecisely the contrary opinion.METHODB OF DETERMININCi THE SUPPOSED VARIABILITY OF SOLAR RADIA-TION-SOLAR ACTINOMETRY.It would seem a t first sight a simple thing to show whetherthe sun radiates more a t one time than a t another by a directexposure of a suitalde actinometer during a term of years.This has been done in several instances, but so far as I knowwith a wholly unconvincing result. About twenty years ago,for instance, two able gentlemen reduced, independently, sucha series of observations extending over a sun-spot cycle anddeduced, the one that the suns rays were appreciably nioreintense a t sun-spot masiinum, the other the exact opposite.Nor are later results with the most perfect apparatus moreconvincing. The illustration (fig. 1 ) is plotted from observn-tions extending back to the year 1883, taken a t Montpellierwith the Crova self-recording actinometer, an instrument ofhighly approved construction and most ably ancl honestlyused. The ordinates represent yearly means of all noon ob-servations taken on clear days. While large fluctuations inthe curve are evident, any connection between them and the11-year sun-Npot period, whose maxims occurred in 1883 and1894, is hard to recognize.EFFECTS OF ATMORPHERIC ABSORPTION.Shall we then conclude that the negative of the question isproved. ancl that the solar radiation does not vary to any con-siderable estent perioclically along with the presence of spotsupon the surface of the sun ? This conclusion would be pre-mature. The observer a t the earths surface sees the sunmuch as a fish at the bottom of the lake sees the clouds.More than one-half of the suns radiation which reaches theouter lagers of the earths atmosphere is reflected or re-racliatecl away or is absorbed within the atmosphere, and failswholly to reach the earths snrface, except as &eat producedby absorption, and communicated chiefly by convection andprecipitation. The atmosphere is constantly varying in itstransparency. These changes are chiefly caused by watervapor, water globules, and dust becoming more or less abun-clant, ancl are so great that even the largest depressions in thecurve of actinometer results, just given, might easily be thuscaused. Indeed, i t occurs to me. ancl may very likely haveoccurred to others. that the great depression in the curve forthe gears 1884. 1885, and 1886 was caused by the presence inthe air of dust from the remarkable eruption of the volcanoof Krakatoa in the summer of 1883.To emphasize the importance of the influence of water vaporon actinometric observations. attention is called to a secondcurve (fig. 2) plotted from the Montpellier observations, show-ing the average yearly fluctuation of solar radiation observed.The ordinates represent the monthly means of the noon ob-servations from 1883 to 1900. It will immediately occur tothe reader that these observations are not taken a t a constantaltitncle of the suu, so that the effects of different thicknessesof the air column must influence the curve as well as those ofdifferent humidity and the like. But a little further reflectionwill show that two months a t equal intervals before and afterthe solstices are comparable so far as the altitude of the sun180 MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW. APRIL, 1902is concerned. Thus, for example, July and May, August andApril can be compared on an equal basis. Such a coniparisonbrings out very clearly the great difference in transparency oithe air between the spriiig and summer months, a differencewhich, as was pointed out in Volume I of the Annals of theSmithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, is chiefly caused b ythe comparative absence of water vapor in the air (luring tliespring months. Recent unpublished spechol〉olometric studiesa t the Astrophysical Observatory show that on two apparentlyequally clear clays, near the niiddle of March. 19()9, with equalaltitudes of the sun. the difference in the absorption in thewell-known visible nncl infra-red water-vapor bands alone wassuch as to cause a difference in the solar radiation a t the earthssurface of 7 per cent. Changes far in escess of this occur fromthe sanie cause between spring and siiiniiier.FIG. 2.-Montpellier obscrvat.ions with Cir,va self-registering actinunieter.Mean of noon VR~LIPH by months for years 1883-1900.I n view of these facts, it is not going too far. I think, to saythat no amount of actinometric observations of tlie totd a d g tradkdion can ever furnish a proof of the suns varialility. solong as the earths ntiiiosphere intervenes. Suc.h observations,to have :veight to decide this question, must be conclucted ashigh above the earths surface as is possible.SPECTRAL ACTINOMETRY.There remains, however, another method of attack lese in-decisive. Imagine for a inoment that there may be a certainwave length for which the earths atmosphere is perfectly trans-parent, so that changes in water-vapor content and the likeare unable to alter the quantity of rays of this wave lengthwhich reach the earths surface. I f such a region in the solarspectrum exists and if the actinometric oljservations be con-iinecl to it, there woulcl be the possibility of determining anyvariability of the suns radiation for this particular wave length.Still, of course. there would remain the chance tliat the amountof emission in other regions of the spectrum might vary andbecome stronger or weaker without affecting this one. Let us,however, still further asmnie that other regions of the spectrumesist where the atmospheric absorption, though not negligible.is of a kind directly calculable with certainty, knowing the airiiinss traversed by the rays, by the aid of a suitable formula.Here, again. there would remain the possibility of clet.erminingthe suns variability from actinometric observations confinedto tliese regions of the spectrum. I f a sufficient portion of thespectrum satisfying tliese requirements esistx, the possibility.just alluded to, of failure to discover the range of wave leiigthswhere the solar emission is variable, would be avoided to agreat degree. To restate the advantages of spectral acti-nometry over actinometry of the complete solar radiation, tlieformer allows the observer to avoid altogether tlie errors in-troduced by the presence of water vapor and other barids ofvariable atmospheric absorption. and to confine his nieasuresto wave lengths whose transmissibility by the atmosphere isless fluctuating and more certainly determinable.Wit,hoat speaking too confidently in a matter of such diffi-culty. I ani inclined to think that regions of the solar spectrumexist whose transmissibility in tlie atmosphere may be closelydet.elminec1 and in which spectral actinometry may be carriedon, even a t the earths surface, in such a way as will determinesatisfactoiilp whether the emission of the sun has an 11-yearperiod or not. It may be of interest to add that spectro-bolometric observations of this kind are now in progress at theSmithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. It can not be denied,however, that still greater certainty and value woulcl be addedto this work if i t were conducted high above the lower strataof the earths atmosphere.DIRECT OBXER\\-ATIONB OF THE SUN.The direct esniiiinatioii of the suns surface by suitable opti-cal methods has yielded interesting facts connected with thesun-spot cycle niicl the question of a possible variability of tohesolar radiation. Thus, continuous records are being kept atseveral observatories of t,he spotted area of the sun and of theappewance of faculE and prominences, notably in Italy. Atevery total solar eclipse iiumerous photographs of the coronaand of the kpectra of the various Solar appenclnges continuethe incomplete records of these phenomena. Furthermore,the Solar Physics Oliservatory a t South Kensington, uncler theefficient direction of Sir Nornian Lockyer, has for many yearscollected photographic spectra of tlie sun spots for comparisonwith the spectra of the surrounding photosphere.Broadly speaking, the results of routine solar study indicatethat there is associated with the maximum of sun spots a masi-mum period of activity in solar phenomena of other kinds. Thisincludes an enlarged extent of surface covered by facula anderuptive prominences and increased brightness of the corona.It is a natural, thoiigli not a necessary, inference that along withthis increase of visible disturbance there will go an increase ofradiation emitted, just as when we stir a fire and bring freshcoals to the top, it sends out the more radiation.Sir Norinan Lockyer goes further than this in discussing thedifferences between the spectra of spots and the spectra of thephotosphere, and seems to a%rm very distinctly, as proved be-yoncl reasonable doubt, that the sun is actually hotter a t sun-spot masimmn. It is observed a t South Kensington that someof the spectral lines within the spots are broadened as com-pared with tlie same lines in the spechum of the photosphere.The lines most broadened a t sun-spot minimum are those whichsppear as emission lines in the spectra of known terrestrialsubstances, as such spectra me produced by introducing metalsin the electric arc, or, in similar fashion, while tlie lines mostbroadened a t sun-spot masimum clo not correspond to the emis-3ion spectra of known terrestrial substances, but have theirwigins unknown. By a plttusilde inference in the nature ofan extrapolation from known data, Lockyer thinks thege un-known lines widened in the spots are clue to simpler atomic(or lesser than atomic) combinations, macle possible only byhigher temperatures than tliose a t our command in the labora-tory. Hence, he concludes that the sun spots are hotter atsun-spot mashnuin than a t sun-spot miniinum, and that theirincreased temperature indicates a hotter siin and greater emis-jion. This argument. i f I rightly apprehend it, is not entirely:onclusive, for even if we accept tlie first assumption in regardbo the nature of tlie b c unknown lines and admit that tlie sunspots are hotter a t sun-spot masimuiii, it still seems possiblethat the higher temperature of the spots may be otherwisezaused than by x hotter sun, for we may see deeper down inh e spots a t niasiinum thau a t minimum, and view them atinaximuin a t a depth where they are surrounded by the hotterinterior of the sim. If, however, direct spectral actinometry,such as I have spoken of above, should be carried on for aterm of years a t some high altitude, and should conclusivelyletermine the amount and kind of changes which may betaking place in the emission of the sun, then it might prove,uot only tliat Lockyers views are indeed the true ones, buttliat his inethod of ol〉servation, while not independently yield-APRIL, 1902. MONTHLY WEATHER REVTEW. 181ing a rigid proof of a variable solar emission, would still bcthe best suited to keep account of the fluctuating condition othe sun after such a variability has been thoroughly establishedSome work has been clone by heat methods and by photometry to compare the radiation of the spots with that of thcphotosphere, notably by Langley about 1875. This worlshows that the spots radiate distinctly less than the photos.phere surrounding them, though not so much less that thtradiation received from a spot a t the center of the suns dimwould fall below the amount received from an equal angulaiarea of the suns disc near the limb where it suffers great ab.soilition in its long path through the solar atmosphere. Lnngley showed incleecl that the direct influence of spots in dimin.ishing the total radiation of the s ~i n is not worth taking intcaccount. At about the same time the investigations of thcabsorption of the suns atmosphere by Langley, Vogel, andothers showed how marked an iufluence this solar atmosphericabsorption exerts on the amount of solar radiation received aithe earth. It would probably be within bounds to say that 8quarter of the radiations of that interior surface, which magroughly be spoken of as the racliating surface of the sun, arcstopped by what may roughly be called the solar atmosphere.Halni, in papers which appeared in recent numbers of theAstronomische Nachrichten and of Nature. uses this a1)sorbingproperty of the solar atmosphere as the h s i s of a most inge-nious theory to account for the perioclicity of siin spots andthe other associated periodic solar phenomena as well as oidifferences of eniission which may exist. His discussion leachto the view that the solar radiation emitted is less as t,he sun-spot maximum period approaches. aiicl that the spots. promi-nences, and faculte are the volcanic evidences of a superheatedcondition within, which line resulted from a restriction of thefreedom of radiation by the cooling and consequent increasingopaqueness of the outer layers of the absorbing atmosphere.The interior of the sun is heated by contraction, according toHalm, faster than its atmosphere allows the heat to be dimin-ished by radiation, Thus a periodic restoration of the temp-erature equilibrium must take place. This is brought aboutby the increased circulation, reheating, and resulting greatertransmissibility of the solar atmosphere. By this view theatmosphere, after such a gradual increase of transiiiissibillity,which reaches its maximum long after the masimum of sunspots, becomes more opaque again by gradual cooling of itsouter layers during the succeeding relatively calm state. Thetruth of this could be determined by observations of the rncli-ation from different parts of the suns disc with the spectro-bolometer of Langley, or with the spectral photometer ofVogel. Such an investigation to deteniiine the transmissi-bility of the solar atmosphere by observations of the energyspectra a t different parts of the suns disc has been maclewithin the past gear a t tlie Sinithsonian Astroph-pical 01)-servatory. I f continued for a period of eleven years thisstudy ought to show any such variations of t,ransmissibilitpas Helms theory requires.THE INFLUENCE OF SOLAR ATMOSPHERIC ABSORPTION.CONCLUSION.These new views then, like all their predecessors. point tothe complexity of the sun, ancl the uncertainty of deductionsbased on our present knowledge. At the same time the pro-bability of a vital connection between the solar changes andmatters of great interest upon the earth has been more andmore confirmed miithin the last thirty years. It would seemthat satisfactory progress in our understanding of these rela-tions requires that observations of the energy of the solarspectrum be carried on a t the highest practicable altitude inor near the Tropics, for a terni of years that shall be not less,but preferably more, than a complete sun-spot period of elevenyears. Such an investigation would determine, it may be hoped, 2 4 .1whether or not the sun emits different quantities of radiationin different years; whether observations a t lower altitudes maybe relied upon to follow the suns condition, and it might alsothrow light on the cause of solar perioclicity.THE UIRCULATION OF THE ATMOSPHBRE IN THI TROPICAL AND EQUATORIAL REGIONS.Ry A. T..AWRRNCR ROTIH, 1)irrrtw. Blue IIill Met.eorologica1 Observatory, dated May 6, 19W.It is evident to students of meteorology and physical geo-graphy that our theories about the circulation of the atmos-phere above the trncle winds ancl clolclrums are based on veryscanty data and consequently that any method of increasingour knowledge of t,he subject should be welcomed. After I had demonstrated last sumiiier that kites could be employedon a steamship to obtain meteorological o1)servations in theupper air clnring bot,h calm and windy weather, and in regionshitherto inaccessible (see MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW, September,ancl December, 1901), it seemed that the most useful field forkites was the ecluatorial and tropical oceans. With a view ofascertaining the state of our knowledge on the subject, as wellas when and where atmospheric soundings should be macle, Iconsulted Prof. H. H. Hildebranclsson, of Upsala, Sweden, who,by reason of his discussion of the international cloud observa-tions and measurements, ancl the attention he has given to thestudy of the circulation of the atmosphere, is one of the bestauthorities on the subject. With the consent of ProfessorHilclebrandsson, his answers to my incluries are here givenalmost verbatim.THE UPPER ANTITR.4DE AND ITS INVPSSTIGATION.Fheoriea of atmoqhet-ic circitlntion.-It has been believed from the timeof Halley, and more fully clevehped t.heories have been put forward 1,y Dove, Maury, and Ferrel, that. the ascending currents above the thernialequat.or proceed ininiediat~ely as southwest and northwest antitrades over t.he nclrt.lieast and srut.lieast t,rade winds. A part of tlie ant,itrade, per- haps, sinks down over the high barometric pressures in the North andRoi1t.h At,lantic oceans and returns with the trade winds, but the greaterpart of the antitrade flrst. descends to tlie surface of the ocean north and 11th of the t.ritde ainds and continues to the poles as the prevailing uthwest or nort,liwest winds of the north or south temperate zones.The facts upon which t.his theory is based are very meager. It is only011 t.he Peak of Teneriffe (12,160 feet) that t,he antitrade can be observedthe whole year. Its mean lower limit is at the height of 9 ,W feet, andt,liis height is greater in suinnier than in winter. In October i t sinks toG,(M.W feet. Leopold von Buch (as cited by Dove, Das Gesetz der St,urnie.p. 27) wrote in 1625, as follows: Should we not believe t,hat the west wind sought for on the suninier voyages froni Teneriffe to England in the Iat,itode of the Azores and ordinarily found there * * * is, as well RHt,he west wind on tlie summit of the Peak, the upper equatorial currentthat has here come dvwn to the level of the sea? It would t,hen follow t.hat t,he equatorial current of the upper regions, at least over the AtlanticOcean, does not rwch t.110 pole.So far a% I know this is the rmly enipirical fact upon which the theoryis founded. but, on the other hand, it should be said t,liat i t is not provedthat the soiface wind at the Azores is the prolongation of t.he antitrade. When t.he center of tlie haroniet.ric niasiniuni shifts to the south, thesouthwest wind also nioves to lower latitudes, and as the antitrade sinks !icar the cent.er at the sanie t,inie. it probably must beat a lower level on t.hp P 4 i when the center is approaching. But.. as already stat.ed. it. islot certain that t.he antitrade reaa:hes the surface of the ocean north of h i s center uf high pressure.We know that the intitrade esists oler the trades. at least in the north Atlantic and at the sandwich Islands, but no one has found this upper current in Central lnierica or in Ecuador, while the siiioke of the highest volcanoes aroundauito constantly indicat.e a strong wind froni the east. On the accorn- Janying map, fig. 2, the isobars and surfaoe winds for July are copiedliwn Hams Atlas der Meteorologie. while the long aimws indicate;he directions of n~oi~e~iient of the cirrus cloudsin July. We see that there s a broad upper streani flowing from the east both above and on eachiide of the t.herma.1 equator. A t Manila the direction is east-northeast,n India southeast. Congo east-southeast. Guiana and Costa Rica due mst, Jamaica and Havana sast-sout.heast, though in winter i t is west-iouthwest, at Havana. I n about latitude twenty degrees the direction isvest-southwest at Key West and west.-northwest. at Mauritius, while over .he whole temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, from tlie United Slates in the west. to Assani and Shanghai in the east, westerly winds)revail. A t Melbourne tlie direction is also west 1 6 O north. In flg. 1/re given the mean monthly directions of the upper clouds extractedAscprtnincd ,fmia.-Our knowledge is very limited."
