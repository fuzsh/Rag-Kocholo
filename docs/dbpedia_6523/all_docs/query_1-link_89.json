The offer includes the historically available observations, i.e. individual time series go back to the 19th century and are available in the following resolutions:\n\ndaily | monthly | annual\n\nPhenological observations\n\nOur phenological data are collected at about 1200 active stations with the help of the instant and annual detectors. On selected plants, such as apple, birch, snowdrop, gooseberry, wheat, wine, etc., the different stages of development are observed and reported to the DWD annually (annual reporters) or immediately (immediate reporters).\n\nData from radiosonde ascents\n\nIn the subdirectory high_resolution/, series of measurements with high temporal resolution (2-10 seconds) and spatial coordinate information (balloon position) are available. The low_resolution/ directory contains data in the traditional output form (main print areas and prominent points).\n\nMonthly profiles of 12 radiosondes (balloon soundings) are available in the original and homogenized (Explanation: Homogenization).\n\n==> Please pay particular attention to the technical notes in the \"General information for all climate data\" at the end of this document. <==\n\nTo the top\n\n2. Derived parameters at station locations\n\nAgricultural meteorological models provide soil parameters at station locations for:\n\npotential and real evaporation -over grass and sandy loam-,\n\nthe soil moisture -under grass and sandy loam-,\n\nthe soil temperatures at depths of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cm -under untilled soil-,\n\nand the maximum frost penetration depth.\n\nAvailable resolutions are available for:\n\ndaily | monthly | and multi-annual (1991-2010)\n\nThe soil parameters are calculated for about 320 station sites, the time series begin in 1991.\n\nThere is a list and a map of the locations for which the calculations were made.\n\nTechnical parameters include heating degree days and cooling days.\n\nTo the top\n\n3. Grid fields for Germany\n\nThe grid fields cover Germany in different temporal resolutions. However, the grid values are not available for all parameters.\n\nThe following precipitation grids are available:\n\nWith continuous updating:\n\n- RADOLAN precipitation grids are derived from radar data and station data ► hourly | daily\n\n- REGNIE precipitation grids, on the other hand, are only calculated from the measured data of the precipitation stations ► daily | monthly | multi-annual\n\n- Climate stations are the data basis for grids in ► monthly | half-yearly | annual | and multi-annual Resolution\n\nFrom recalculation based on radar data with better correction methods:\n\n- RADKLIM Version 2017.002: Post-processed radar-based, station-calibrated hourly precipitation totals from 2001.\n\n- RADKLIM Version 2017.002: Post-processed radar-based, quasi-calibrated 5-minute precipitation totals from 2001.\n\nThe data are available on a Germany-wide grid with a grid width of 1 km x 1 km in polarstereographic projection and cover the period 2001 to 2017. The radar climatology version 2017.002 contains, in comparison to version 2016.003, in addition an extensive correction of radar artefacts.\n\nHeavy precipitation statistics (KOSTRA-DWD) provide information on the probability of occurrence of heavy rain of various durations in Germany.\n\nAgrometeorological models provide grids of soil parameters: derived soil moisture, soil temperature at 5 cm depth, frost penetration depth, potential and real evaporation. Available resolutions are available for:\n\ndaily | monthly | und multi-annual (1991-2010)\n\nAir temperature (average, max, min), sunshine duration, drought index, number of days with snow cover, frost days, as well as the number of days with threshold values for temperature and precipitation are available in the resolution:\n\nmonthly | annual | and multi-annual\n\nSolar radiation grid (1 x 1 km; all derived from satellite data and ground measurements)\n\nGlobal radiation ► monthly | annual | multi-annual mean value\n\ndiffused radiation ► monthly | annual\n\ndirect radiation ► monthly | annual\n\nWind energy parameters are derived from measurements close to the ground and are available as a multi-annual average, both in a 1 x 1 km and a 200 x 200 m resolution.\n\nIn the QuWind100 project, a quantitative wind climatology for current and future wind energy applications at altitudes between 100 and 200 m was established for Germany for the period 1981 - 2010. This horizontally high-resolution (100 m x 100 m) and area-wide dataset considers in particular the influence of different surface types as well as the time of day and season on the wind field.\n\nThe TRY project has calculated different grids on 1 x 1 km for the period 1995 - 2012. They were calculated for air temperature, humidity, pressure, dew point, water vapour content, cloud cover, wind direction and wind speed, as well as for direct radiation, global radiation and long-wave outgoing radiation and are available in the following resolutions:\n\nhourly | daily | monthly\n\nFrom the phenological observations were calculated:\n\nGrid for about 50 phenological phases ► annual\n\nBegin of vegetation ► annual | multi-annual mean value\n\nEnd of vegetation ► annual | multi-annual mean value\n\nTo the top\n\n4. Average values for the individual federal states and for Germany as a whole\n\nThe mean values for the individual federal states and for Germany as a whole are calculated from the grid fields for air temperature, precipitation and sunshine duration and are available for:\n\nmonthly | seasonal | annual\n\nClimatological knowledge days are available in annual resolution:\n\nDays with precipitation ≥10 mm | Days with precipitation ≥20 mm | Hot days | Summer days | Frost days | Ice days\n\nTo the top\n\n5. Grid fields for Europe\n\nIn the grid fields for Europe a 5 x 5 km grid has been calculated for the period 2001 to 2010 for the air temperature at 2 m above ground (mean, max, min) and the wind speeds 10 m above ground and the resolutions are available for:\n\ndaily | monthly\n\nCloud cover derived from satellite data is provided in monthly resolution.\n\nTo the top\n\n6. Regional reanalysis\n\nSelected parameters of the regional reanalysis COSMO-REA6 are provided on https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/REA/. The hourly fields cover Europe for the period 1995 - 2016, in 6 x 6 km resolution. The format is the original format of COSMO (DWD grib1 in rotated coordinates). The following parameters are provided: Air pressure (reduced and non-reduced) at the Earth's surface, precipitation, temperature (min, max, mean) and relative humidity, wind components U and V, wind peak, various radiation parameters (diffuse and direct), height of the boundary layer, integrated water vapour column, cloud cover, depending on the parameters for the lowest 6 model levels, or at 10 m (wind) or 2 m (temperature) above the model ground.\n\nTo the top\n\n7. Global climate station data\n\nIn the global climate station data, the historical and current monthly station data are made available as quality-checked CLIMAT messages, such as air temperature (mean, max, min), precipitation height, number of precipitation days, sunshine duration, air pressure, vapour pressure, as well as the long-term averages derived from them. They also contain - with a multitude of parameters - the monthly files of the worldwide CLIMAT messages checked for month/year information and format.\n\nTo the top\n\nGeneral information for all climate data:\n\nFor regularly versioned data you can choose between the two subdirectories \"recent\" and \"historical\". Under \"recent\" are current data which have not yet passed the routine quality control. For the data in the subdirectory \"historical\" the routine quality control is completed. The very latest 1-minute and 10-minute data can be found in the \"now\" subdirectories.\n\nRoutine quality control ensures that errors in the archived data that are detected at a later date are also corrected. In addition, the time series are constantly being expanded through the digitization of historical recordings. Therefore, our archived climate data are versioned. In the CDC-OpenData section the last valid version is provided under \"historical\", in approximately annual intervals.\n\nThe time series may possibly contain inhomogeneities (e.g. due to station relocation or change of measuring equipment). Users are therefore strongly advised to use the station metadata to find out the causes of possible inhomogeneities and to read the attached data set descriptions.\n\nPlease note that not all meteorological parameters are offered in all temporal resolutions and that the dates of data publication may differ.\n\nContact:\n\nClimate and Environment\n\nCustomer Relations Management\n\nPhone: + 49 (0)69 8062 4400\n\nFax: + 49 (0)69 8062 4484\n\nmailto: klima.vertrieb@dwd.de"
