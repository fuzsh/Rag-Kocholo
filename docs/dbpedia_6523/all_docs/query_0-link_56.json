        "text": "In men, we analyzed: a) 83,900 measurements from the Union Army Veterans of the Civil War cohort (UAVCW) obtained between 1862 and 1930, b) 5998 measurements from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I cohort (NHANES) obtained between 1971 and 1975, and c) 230,261 measurements from the Stanford Translational Research Integrated Database Environment cohort (STRIDE) obtained between 2007 and 2017 (Table 1). We also compared temperature measurements in women within the two later time periods (NHANES, 9303 measurements; and STRIDE, 348,006 measurements).\n\nOverall, temperature measurements were significantly higher in the UAVCW cohort than in NHANES, and higher in NHANES than in STRIDE (Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplement 1). In each of the three cohorts, and for both men and women, we observed that temperature decreased with age with a similar magnitude of effect (between −0.003°C and −0.0043°C per year of age, Figure 1). As has been previously reported (Eriksson et al., 1985), temperature was directly related to weight and inversely related to height, although these associations were not statistically significant in the UAVCW cohort. Analysis using body mass index (BMI) and BMI adjusted for height produced similar results (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) and analyses including only white and black subjects (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) showed similar results to those including subjects of all ethnicities.\n\nIn both STRIDE and a one-third subsample of NHANES, we confirmed the known relationship between later hour of the day and higher temperature: temperature increased 0.02°C per hour of the day in STRIDE compared to 0.01°C in NHANES (Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 1—figure supplement 4). The month of the year had a relatively small, though statistically significant, effect on temperature in all three cohorts, but no consistent pattern emerged (Figure 1—figure supplement 5). Using approximated ambient temperature for the date and geographic location of the examination in UAVCW and STRIDE, a rise in ambient temperature of one degree Celsius correlated with 0.001 degree (p<0.001) and 0.0004 degree (p=0.013) increases in body temperature in UAVCW and STRIDE, respectively. Because the seasonal and climatic effects were small and the independent variables were unavailable for many measurements, we omitted month and estimated ambient temperature from further models.\n\nWe explored whether chronic infectious diseases—even in the absence of a diagnosis of fever—might raise temperature in the UAVCW cohort, by assessing the temperatures of men reporting a history of malaria (N = 2,203), syphilis (N = 465), or hepatitis (N = 24), or with active tuberculosis (N = 738), pneumonia (N = 277) or cystitis (N = 1,301). Only those currently diagnosed with tuberculosis or pneumonia had elevated temperatures compared to the remainder of the UAVCW population [37.22°C (95% CI: 37.20–37.24°C) and 37.06°C (95% CI: 37.03–37.09°C), respectively compared to 37.02 (95% CI: 36.52–37.53)] (Supplementary file 1).\n\nOne possible reason for the lower temperature estimates today than in the past is the difference in thermometers or methods of obtaining temperature. To minimize these biases, we examined changes in body temperature by birth decade within each cohort under the assumption that the method of thermometry would not be biased on birth year. Within the UAVCW, we observed a significant birth cohort effect, with temperatures in earlier birth decades consistently higher than those in later cohorts (Figure 2). With each birth decade, temperature decreased by −0.02°C. We then assessed change in temperature over the 197 birth-year span covered by the three cohorts. We observed a steady decrease in body temperature by birth cohort for both men (−0.59°C between birth decades from 1800 to 1997; −0.030°C per decade) and women (−0.32°C between 1890 and 1997; −0.029°C per decade). Black and white men and women demonstrated similar trends over time (Figure 3).\n\nIn this study, we analyzed 677,423 human body temperature measurements from three different cohort populations spanning 157 years of measurement and 197 birth years. We found that men born in the early 19th century had temperatures 0.59°C higher than men today, with a monotonic decrease of −0.03°C per birth decade. Temperature has also decreased in women by −0.32°C since the 1890s with a similar rate of decline (−0.029°C per birth decade). Although one might posit that the differences among cohorts reflect systematic measurement bias due to the varied thermometers and methods used to obtain temperatures, we believe this explanation to be unlikely. We observed similar temporal change within the UAVCW cohort—in which measurement were presumably obtained irrespective of the subject's birth decade—as we did between cohorts. Additionally, we saw a comparable magnitude of difference in temperature between two modern cohorts using thermometers that would be expected to be similarly calibrated. Moreover, biases introduced by the method of thermometry (axillary presumed in a subset of UAVCW vs. oral for other cohorts) would tend to underestimate change over time since axillary values typically average one degree Celsius lower than oral temperatures (Sund-Levander et al., 2002; Niven et al., 2015). Thus, we believe the observed drop in temperature reflects physiologic differences rather than measurement bias. Other findings in our study—for example increased temperature at younger ages, in women, with increased body mass and with later time of day—support a wealth of other studies dating back to the time of Wunderlich (Wunderlich and Sequin, 1871; Waalen and Buxbaum, 2011).\n\nResting metabolic rate is the largest component of a typical modern human’s energy expenditure, comprising around 65% of daily energy expenditure for a sedentary individual (Heymsfield et al., 2006). Heat is a byproduct of metabolic processes, the reason nearly all warm-blooded animals have temperatures within a narrow range despite drastic differences in environmental conditions. Over several decades, studies examining whether metabolism is related to body surface area or body weight (Du Bois, 1936; Kleiber, 1972), ultimately, converged on weight-dependent models (Mifflin et al., 1990; Schofield, 1985; Nelson et al., 1992). Since US residents have increased in mass since the mid-19th century, we should have correspondingly expected increased body temperature. Thus, we interpret our finding of a decrease in body temperature as indicative of a decrease in metabolic rate independent of changes in anthropometrics. A decline in metabolic rate in recent years is supported in the literature when comparing modern experimental data to those from 1919 (Frankenfield et al., 2005).\n\nAlthough there are many factors that influence resting metabolic rate, change in the population-level of inflammation seems the most plausible explanation for the observed decrease in temperature over time. Economic development, improved standards of living and sanitation, decreased chronic infections from war injuries, improved dental hygiene, the waning of tuberculosis and malaria infections, and the dawn of the antibiotic age together are likely to have decreased chronic inflammation since the 19th century. For example, in the mid-19th century, 2–3% of the population would have been living with active tuberculosis (Tiemersma et al., 2011). This figure is consistent with the UAVCW Surgeons' Certificates that reported 737 cases of active tuberculosis among 23,757 subjects (3.1%). That UAVCW veterans who reported either current tuberculosis or pneumonia had a higher temperature (0.19°C and 0.03°C respectively) than those without infectious conditions supports this theory (Supplementary file 1). Although we would have liked to have compared our modern results to those from a location with a continued high risk of chronic infection, we could identify no such database that included temperature measurements. However, a small study of healthy volunteers from Pakistan—a country with a continued high incidence of tuberculosis and other chronic infections—confirms temperatures more closely approximating the values reported by Wunderlich (mean, median and mode, respectively, of 36.89°C, 36.94°C, and 37°C) (Adhi et al., 2008).\n\nReduction in inflammation may also explain the continued drop in temperature observed between the two more modern cohorts: NHANES and STRIDE. Although many chronic infections had been conquered before the NHANES study, some—periodontitis as one example (Capilouto and Douglass, 1988)— continued to decrease over this short period. Moreover, the use of anti-inflammatory drugs including aspirin (Luepker et al., 2015), statins (Salami et al., 2017) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Lamont and Dias, 2008) increased over this interval, potentially reducing inflammation. NSAIDs have been specifically linked to blunting of body temperature, even in normal volunteers (Murphy et al., 1996). In support of declining inflammation in the modern era, a study of NHANES participants demonstrated a 5% decrease in abnormal C-reactive protein levels between 1999 and 2010 (Ong et al., 2013).\n\nChanges in ambient temperature may also explain some of the observed change in body temperature over time. Maintaining constant body temperature despite fluctuations in ambient temperature consumes up to 50–70% of daily energy intake (Levine, 2007). Resting metabolic rate (RMR), for which body temperature is a crude proxy, increases when the ambient temperature decreases below or rises above the thermoneutral zone, that is the temperature of the environment at which humans can maintain normal temperature with minimum energy expenditure (Erikson et al., 1956). In the 19th century, homes in the US were irregularly and inconsistently heated and never cooled. By the 1920s, however, heating systems reached a broad segment of the population with mean night-time temperature continuing to increase even in the modern era (Mavrogianni et al., 2013). Air conditioning is now found in more than 85% of US homes (US Energy Information Administration, 2011). Thus, the amount of time the population has spent at thermoneutral zones has markedly increased, potentially causing a decrease in RMR, and, by analogy, body temperature.\n\nSome factors known to influence body temperature were not included in our final model due to missing data (ambient temperature and time of day) or complete lack of information (dew point)(Obermeyer et al., 2017). Adjusting for ambient temperature, however, would likely have amplified the changes over time due to lack of heating and cooling in the earlier cohorts. Time of day at which measurement was conducted had a more significant effect on temperature (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). Based on the distribution of times of day for temperature measurement available to us in STRIDE and NHANES, we estimate that even in the worst case scenario, that is the UAVCW measurements were all were obtained late in the afternoon, adjustment for time of day would have only a small influence (<0.05°C) on the −0.59°C change over time.\n\nIn summary, normal body temperature is assumed by many, including a great preponderance of physicians, to be 37°C. Those who have shown this value to be too high have concluded that Wunderlich’s 19th century measurements were simply flawed (Mackowiak, 1997; Sund-Levander et al., 2002). Our investigation indicates that humans in high-income countries have changed physiologically over the last 200 birth years with a mean body temperature 1.6% lower than in the pre-industrial era. The role that this physiologic ‘evolution’ plays in human anthropometrics and longevity is unknown."
