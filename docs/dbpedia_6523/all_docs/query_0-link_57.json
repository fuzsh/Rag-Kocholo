The instrumental measurements constitute the oldest part of Germany's longest temperature series, which was however only\navailable as monthly means up to now. Here we publish the imaged diaries,\ntogether amounting to 10â445Â images. Further, we present the digitized\ninstrumental series, which will serve as the starting point for a new, daily Berlin series. By comparing the series to neighbouring records, we show that the pressure data are reliable in a quantitative sense, whereas this is true for the temperature data only in a qualitative sense as the temperature scale was not converted.",

        "text": "2.1âLife and work\n\nGottfriedÂ Kirch was one of the leading astronomers of the late 17thÂ century. A recent biography (Herbst, 2022) gives a detailed account of his life and work, which is only briefly summarized in the following. Kirch was born in Guben (Fig.Â 1). In the 1660s he started to publish calendars, which remained an important source of income for the family even after his death. As an astronomer, Kirch became famous in the early 1680s, when he discovered a comet and the star cluster M11. His second wife MariaÂ MargarethaÂ Winkelmann was also an astronomer (but she was not admitted to the University of Halle, to which she applied). She discovered the comet C/1702 H1 and worked on sunspots. Gottfried and MariaÂ MargarethaÂ Kirch had six children, many of whom supported or continued the astronomical and meteorological work. Two of them, Christfried and Christine, had their own weather diaries. Christine was further supported by her sisters Margaretha and Dorothea. FigureÂ 2 show the observers and observation locations on a time axis.\n\nThe Kirch family lived in Leipzig from 1676 onward, then moved to Guben in 1692 (Fig.Â 1). In 1700 GottfriedÂ Kirch was appointed as Royal Astronomer by the newly funded Prussian Academy of Science in Berlin (with GottfriedÂ WilhelmÂ Leibniz as president). However, the astronomical observatory was not built yet, and for the next 10Â years observations were performed in the family's apartment (Fig.Â 1).\n\nThe promised apartment was not ready in 1700, and therefore the family initially stayed at different places. In 1708 they eventually moved into the âAstronomenhausâ at Dorotheenstrasse 10 (Fig.Â 1). The observatory was just next door (Fig.Â 3) but was officially opened only in 1711, although observations were made earlier (SiebenhÃ¼hner, 1996).\n\nGottfriedÂ Kirch died in 1710. After the death of her husband, MariaÂ MargarethaÂ Kirch and her son ChristfriedÂ Kirch continued the observations. They decided that Christfried should note the astronomical observations and MariaÂ MargarethaÂ Kirch the weather observations. However, the financial situation became more and more precarious for MariaÂ MargarethaÂ Kirch. Despite her qualification, she could not follow as a director of the observatory but continued to publish the calendars. In 1712, she moved into the house of Baron von Krosigk at WallstrasseÂ 135 (Fig.Â 1), where she observed for the next 2 years (however, there was no thermometer). In 1714, she moved to GdaÅsk with the children. In 1716, ChristfriedÂ Kirch became the director of the Berlin observatory, and MariaÂ MargarethaÂ Kirch moved back in with her son at the Astronomenhaus. In 1716 she began to measure again and continued almost until her death on 29Â DecemberÂ 1720. The data presented in this article start in 1721 and were presumably all taken at the Astronomenhaus (locationÂ B in Fig.Â 1).\n\nMeasurements were continued together by Christfried und ChristineÂ Kirch. Christfried died in 1740. Although not officially a member of the Prussian Academy, Christine continued the astronomical observations and was paid by the academy. She also performed meteorological measurements and continued publishing the calendars. Her house was a gathering point for scientists of the 18thÂ century. Leonhard Euler was a frequent visitor, and other guests include Joseph-Nicolas Delisle and Anders Celsius. The last instrumental meteorological measurements date to 30Â AprilÂ 1774. ChristineÂ Kirch died inÂ 1782.\n\n2.2âInstruments\n\nGottfried and Maria Margaretha Kirch had a thermometer (Wetterglas) since 1691. It was a Florentin-type thermometer manufactured by GottfriedÂ Kirch: a glass bulb filled with spirit of wine with a closed tube. However, the thermometer seems to have been broken at some point. The notes clearly speak of an old and a new thermometer, although it is not fully clear when the change took place.\n\nAt that time observers made their own temperature scales as there was no agreed-upon scale. According to the description by Kirch, the thermometer had a 60â scale. The freezing point was at 20â, and 40â corresponded to a hot summer day. The temperature scale was later analysed by LenkeÂ (1964), who converted the Berlin temperature data for the winter of 1708/1709 to the Celsius scale, though not without difficulties. Later, Christfried und ChristineÂ Kirch reportedly used a Fahrenheit thermometer, but the given temperatures are inconsistent with a Fahrenheit scale. PelzÂ (1978) mentions six different scales that were used in the Kirch diaries, of which only the first one is approximately known.\n\nA barometer was in use since 1709. However, no details are known about the instrument. Likewise, not much is known about the siting of the instruments. According to LenkeÂ (1964), measurements in the Astronomenhaus were made in a north-facing window on the middle floor.\n\n5.1âDigitizing and processing\n\nWe digitized 42â065Â pressure measurements and 39â639Â temperature measurements. Of the former, 49Â have the flag âwmo_time_consistencyâ, and two have the flag âduplicate_observation_timeâ. An overview of the temporal coverage of pressure and temperature data is given in Fig.Â 8. The data cover the periods 1730 to 1751 and 1756 to 1770 very well, with typically threeÂ to four measurements per day. The 1720s and the period 1752â1755 are less well covered. No data are available for the years 1771â1773, and only few pressure measurements are available forÂ 1774.\n\nThe time of day of the measurement is always indicated. A histogram of the measurement hours (Fig.Â 9, top) shows clear peaks, namely between 07:00Â and 09:00âUTC, between 11:00Â and 12:00âUTC, and between 20:00Â and 22:00âUTC. A smaller but distinct peak occurs between 14:00Â and 15:00âUTC. Thus, the measurements were taken rather regularly at the usual observing times (local time is approximately 1âh ahead of UTC).\n\nA histogram of all pressure measurements is given in Fig.Â 9 (bottom). An open question concerns the scale. PelzÂ (1978) assumes that pressure was not given in the official local scale, Rhineland inches (or Prussian inches, which is the same), as the numbers would otherwise be too low, but in Paris inches. However, assuming Paris inches would lead to numbers that are too high, the difference being 30âhPa. We assumed Rhineland inches, and consequently the average pressure is around 995âhPa, which is too low. We note that homogenization will be necessary to scale the pressure data. That said, the time series of monthly mean pressure (Fig.Â 10) does not show any obvious systematic change over time.\n\n5.3âCase study: particularly cold winter of 1739/1740\n\nOne of the coldest European winters of the second millennium was 1739/1740 (Schlaak, 1984; Wanner and Luterbacher, 2002; Casty et al., 2005). It exhibits the lowest cold-season temperature of the northern extratropical land areas of the last 3 centuries in a recent reconstruction by Reichen et al.Â (2002). In fact, results from the spring phenology data from Europe used in that study are summarized in TableÂ 2. Clearly, the spring was extremely late in 1740, although it set the record only in one of the series. In Fig.Â 11 we present a very simple analysis of daily mean temperature in Berlin from 1738 to 1743. For comparison we also show the monthly minimum and maximum temperatures from GdaÅsk, which is over 400âkm away. For Berlin, all measurements made on a particular day were averaged without considering possible variations in the time of day of the measurement. Note also that we do not know the scale of temperature, although it is reported that Christfried and ChristineÂ Kirch used a Fahrenheit thermometer. The fact that slightly negative values are reached in JanuaryÂ 1740 might indicate Fahrenheit temperature (where zero corresponds to â17.8ââC), or it might indicate that the liquid dropped below a self-defined scale. The summer values are clearly too low to be degrees Fahrenheit. Despite all these factors and despite the distance between the two sites, we clearly see common variations. For instance, minimum temperatures were low in NovemberÂ 1739, but then high in DecemberÂ 1739 (with high maximum temperatures as well). Then JanuaryÂ 1740 had very low minimum temperatures but rather normal maximum temperature.\n\nFor pressure, we can compare the Berlin series with that from Nuremberg (the observer was JohannÂ GabrielÂ Doppelmayr, who is also the author of the atlas from which Fig.Â 3 is taken). The agreement is very good, with a correlation coefficient ofÂ 0.83 despite some probable outliers. For the winter of 1739/1740, we find low pressure in DecemberÂ 1739, but then high pressure in JanuaryÂ 1740. This is consistent with temperatures."
