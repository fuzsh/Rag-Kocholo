Although the winters can get somewhat cold, but the average winter temperature rarely drops below the freezing point. The best time to visit Leipzig is during the summers. It is also the time when Leipzig hosts a number of local events such as Street Music Festival.\n\nSummers: - Summers (May to September) are generally warm, averaging at 19 degree Celsius with daytime temperatures of 24 degree Celsius.\n\nWinters: - The cold season lasts from November 29 to February 27 with an average daily high temperature below 7 degree Celsius. It can get most chilly between December and February, when you can expect widespread, overnight frosts at times, particularly during January.\n\nSpring: - This is the best time to visit Leipzig as the climate begins to improve with days getting longer and flora and fauna bursting into bloom."
