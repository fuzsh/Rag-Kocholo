        "text": "I think you can see Europe at any budget level provided you're flexible in making some tradeoffs to make the trip happen (after all, both students living on a shoestring budget and wealthy people travel to Europe, so it's definitely possible), and you are fairly aggressive about shopping for a good airfare and lodging. The other stuff - meals, incidentals, entertainment, etc. - are the most easy to adjust and they usually make up a smaller share of the entire budget.\n\nI really wouldn't worry about other people's spending, or to use their numbers as a reference for what you should do - you have to stick to your own budget and what you can comfortably afford at the end of the day, and that's all that counts. Daily average spending in a continent as large and variable as Europe will be skewed all over the board, so I wouldn't trust those figures anyway.\n\nThis is a very difficult answer to give because of the variables involved. I count all actual costs from the day I leave home until the day I return home. I calculate everything, airfare, hotels, all transportation (rental cars, trains, metros, cabs, etc.), food (meals, drinks, snacks, etc.), tours, sight entry fees and all tips.\n\nI stay at middle of the road hotels (avg. $125). Rarely eat breakfast unless it is included (don't eat breakfast normally anyhow). When traveling solo I try to eat a full meal for lunch and very small dinners (that way I burn off a lot in the pm walking to sights, hiking, etc. and I usually have a drink and something small in the evening and just sit and take in the surroundings.)\n\nI have tracked my spending on several trips and it averages as a SOLO.......$300-320 per day. For 2 people you need to do a calculation regarding hotels. Hotels don't double, but almost everything else does.\n\nIf you are asking about just daytime spending, that is impossible to say. Hiking is cheap....most museums cost money. All depends on your likes and dislikes.\n\nWith 2 kids and 2 adults my rule-of-thumb for a budget that is reasonable for us is $500/day plus the flight from home. The $500 includes everything else - flights within Europe, trains, hotels, food, tickets to attractions. This is a comfortable amount - we could go lower, but this amount generally gives what we need without being extravagant. It's an average, some days will be higher and some lower.\n\nEdit that if I were solo I could keep it to $200 or so. Adding people adds expense.\n\nAlso my trip to Sicily was less than the one to London and Paris, for obvious reasons. Sicily may have been more like $400/day or less, as most of the apartments we rented were around $100 instead of $175+\n\nI would bet most trips are two weeks or less so the substantial cost is the airfare. Everyone here manages to find $500 deals to Europe, much in the same way everyone i have met won in Vegas. I'm going to guess that the average cost is somewhere around $1200 a ticket x 2 (most travel with significant others). So you are now at $2400. Two weeks is 16 days but you spend 3 of those traveling, leaving 13 days meaning you start with a cost of $185 a day.\n\n.\n\nTransfer to and from the airport (again, i don't believe everyone rides the metro), another $55.00. Oh, i left off getting to the airport at the US end? We'll say you took the metro. Me? I pay to park a car.\n\n.\n\nSo the privilege to be there averages out to $240/day\n\n.\n\nNow you gotta sleep and eat at a minimum\n\n.\n\nMid-range hotel in Central Europe (more in the west, less in the east) will set you back at least $125. Ching, ching: total $365/day.\n\n.\n\nThree meals as good as the ones you would have back home, but not better (so why travel?) figure $40 x two folks. Ching, ching: $445/day.\n\n.\n\nBUT you still haven't seen a dang thing.\n\n.\n\nSo now to save money you will spend 45 minutes on a metro to save $20 on a taxi which will reduce the overall cost of the trip by 0.5%; and two dozen similar examples of thriftiness which might save you as much as 3%. Personally, I dont go to Paris and skip the Eiffel Tower, because of the cost or replace it with something that isn't famous because ... well why would something not be famous?\n\nYou can get a lot more value by planning logical trips with logical progressions during, not bad seasons, but shoulder seasons. Be willing to drive a few hours to a cheaper airport, etc. Then when you get there do everything you ever dreamed of and do it well.\n\nOk so last year I went to London at the end of August through Labor Day weekend. I think I was gone for about 13 days. I spent the first two and a half days in Venice, and the rest of the time in London. My flight to LHR was expensive ($1200) because I waited but the flight to and from Venice ($75) wasn't bad. My hotel for London was $1300 total, Venice was $200 for the two nights. So before any thing else even considered I was at around $210 per night. With transport ($150), food ($500, I went to a fancy afternoon tea and bought some friends dinner), and miscellaneous stuff (shampoo, deodorant that I forgot, etc. about $150), I was at about $275/night, including travel days. This doesn't include souvenirs which would probably add about $50/day. I bought a lot of Christmas present in England.\n\nThis year I am getting ready to go to Greece and then spend 4 more days in London. My costs:\n\nFlight to LHR: $650 (including a basic traveler insurance plan, I got a steal!!!)\n\nFlight to Santorini: $100\n\nFerry to Paros and flight to Athens: $75\n\nHotels in Greece: $680\n\nStay for one night at Hever Castle: $275 (it is my birthday present and a dream come true! so excited!)\n\nHotel in London: $600 (it overlooks the Tower of London so I splurged a little)\n\nTransport for the whole trip: $300 (public transit, the tube, etc)\n\nFood: $50/day\n\nSouvenirs: $300 (total)\n\nThis trip: $280/night\n\n(13 days including the days I fly in and out)\n\nThe trip expenses depend on various factors, eg, the exchange rate, cost of the flight if you include that too. I was throwing old credit card statements yesterday, saw that I had booked hotel rooms in Feb 2016 for the trip in June/early July. . These charges were non-refundable with the exchange rate then at $1.07 to the Euro. Now it's much worse at $1.22 or so to the Euro. Obviously, I'm going to be paying more on this trip.\n\nMy Pension in Berlin still charges the same for a single (EZ) as it did in 2016, 42 Euro but I know I'll pay more at the end my week long stay next month due to the weak rate which might be still worse by mid-May compared to now.\n\nThe big advantage this year is that the flight from SFO to London was $500, last year and in 2016 I paid twice as much for the same time period. In past recent years flying out in mid-May to early June from SFO, the flight was $1500 plus (Economy sardine can, non-stop) to Frankfurt or Paris.\n\nOn recent trips I have found out lots of ways to cut down on spending, if that's my intention at the moment. I do that plus a few dinner splurges, no more daily beer, which eliminates the drinking expense.\n\nOne's travel style dictates the final price of a trip, small hotels/Pensionen, B&Bs, night train rides are always part of each trip, meals in train stations, sometimes staying in a hostel dorm room, which I've not done in a few years, using discount train tickets,\n\nI go by how many Euro am I spending each day including the hotel room. Berlin is the cheapest of big cities and capitals (outside of former East bloc capitals) in that regard which affects the total expenses for the day. In London at the B&B if you call up to make the reservation you get 5% off....still helps.\n\nBecause I still haven't cleaned out my old emails, I can see exactly what I spent November 2017 for vacation in the Netherlands. The price of roundtrip airfare was $568 (I paid extra for premium economy to have a little extra legroom to stretch out on flight, or it would have been $198 cheaper for the roundtrip if I opted to just go with standard coach seats).\n\n5 nights at Ibis Rotterdam - 411 Euro (includes 25 Euro spent to get early morning access to room before regular check-in time)\n\n3 nights at boutique hotel in Utrecht - 480 Euro (this was a premeditated splurge - there were other less expensive hotels, but I specifically wanted to stay here)\n\n8 nights at Conscious Hotel Amsterdam - 915 Euro (included an additional fee for a bike rental)\n\nAnd because I have an email from one of my friends who was there with her family at the same time I was in Amsterdam showing me the address of her 3BR/1BA Airbnb rental in DePijp, her rental was $1449 for 4 nights (including all taxes and fees). My other friend was also in Amsterdam during this time for 4 nights in a 1BR/1BA Airbnb rental near Museumplein which cost her $836.\n\nGot an OV Chipkaart but don't recall putting a ton of money on it (maybe 50-60 Euro?) but used it to take the local trains (airport to Rotterdam, Rotterdam to The Hague, Rotterdam to Utrecht, Utrecht to Amsterdam) and a few buses (Rotterdam to Kinderdijk, Amsterdam back to Airport) and some tram rides. Other than that, walked a good amount.\n\nOn that trip I spent 60 Euro on a Museumkaart and about 30 Euro on admissions for places not covered by Museumkaart. Meals were all over the place. When I was solo for part of the trip I tended to dine in cheaper restaurants (dinner entrees under 20 Euro) and also do takeaway (5 to 15 Euro per meal). But with friends we often went cheap at breakfast (5 Euro or less for a coffee and croissant) and cheap on most lunches and splurged on some of the dinners (not every night - but dined at some places where entrees were in the 25-40 Euro range). Alcohol was also all over the place. We drank beers at some inexpensive spots or dropped a decent chunk on some wines with dinner or cocktails in the evening. Also spent a few days sampling some of the offerings at the local coffeeshops with my friends who were staying in the 1BR, but collectively we didn't spend more than 40 Euro between us - although we did tend to have a cup of tea or a juice while sitting in the coffeeshops (so spent an extra 4 or 5 Euro per person for a refreshment).\n\nAnd because I will not wash my clothing in a hotel sink or bath tub, hang it and let it drip all over my hotel room, to wash and dry 2 loads of laundry at the self serve laundromat cost me a total of 12 Euro.\n\nIts all about where and how. and when. My last trip to Scotland was pretty basic but still cost nearly $300 a day (with out airfare)\n\nMy last trip to Montenegro with a private guide, car and driver and beautiful hotels was maybe $225 a day.\n\nBut to ignore WHEN is the first mistake. Generally my tickets to Budapest set me back $1300 in high season but $900 in low season. Low season can extend into April or May and September and October when the weather is generally pretty good where i travel. So I loose nothing by avoiding the summer; except tourist crowds.\n\nThen the HOW. By planning trips logically you can save a lot. My flight into Lviv and out of Budapest cost no more than RT to Budapest. The connecting flight which give me a few days in Kyiv are $125. Of course your daily average could go way down if you spend 3 of those days on a train. But what did you get for your money?\n\nThe WHERE works when you combine a higher cost destination with a lower cost destination. There is so much world to see, its easy for me.\n\nIts all about where and how. and when.

But what did you get for your money?\n\nThe WHERE works when you combine a higher cost destination with a lower cost destination. There is so much world to see, its easy for me.\n\nI travel solo and live close to Europe, so airfare is not even a factor in my destination decisions. Hotels are my biggest expense by far. When I plan a trip, working out a budget is one of my first steps. I price hotels and intercity transportation and car rental, if needed. Then I throw in an estimated per diem - seems to be about â‚¬45-â‚¬75, depending on the country. Mostly I budget in euros, though on my last European jaunt, I went to Poland and Hungary so I budgeted in USD. Then I look at the total and decide if I can live with it. If it looks ridiculously high, I'll reconsider - maybe look for cheaper rooms or cheaper destinations, or even scrap the idea. Usually, though, it sounds reasonable. While I'm traveling I keep track of my spending. If I see I'm going \"over budget\", I may cut back on food expenses - not so many restaurant meals, or I may just say \"what the heck, I can afford it.\" On the other hand, when I'm \"under budget\", that encourages me to splurge :-)\n\nBig cities are usually more expensive, at least for me. My daily expenses in Alsace and Burgundy were about half what they were in Paris. Though I really splurged in Paris because I had a free place to stay.\n\nThis year I'm planning a fall trip to either Greece or northern Spain. What I'm hoping is that I can allow myself to do both because I'm having a lot of trouble choosing between them and I think they are both relatively inexpensive destinations. When I get around to doing the budgets, I'll find out.\n\nOne thing I consider is that if I am traveling I am not at home...which means I am not spending the money I spend at home. Day-to-day expenses, obviously I am still paying my mortgage and fixed things. But if groceries for my family are $240 per week and I'm gone 2 weeks...that's almost $500 of the trip cost \"offset\". Not commuting to work? No gas/subway fare/parking cost. Eat lunch or coffee out during the day at work a few days per week? Not doing that on vacation, neither is your spouse, \"save\" $100. I also skip our monthly date night and babysitter on trip months.\n\nObviously travel is much more expensive than being at home...but there are a few home costs that will bring down the average. If it's $1000 over a 2 week trip, that's $70 per day.\n\nI did not take this into account in my estimate above but if I were really budgeting I might"
