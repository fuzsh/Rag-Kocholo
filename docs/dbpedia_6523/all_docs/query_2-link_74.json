A really simple guide\n\n\"Mankind's survival guide\": UN report on climate change\n\nExperts at the US National Weather Service Center said the global average temperature was 17,01 degrees Celsius on July 3, and the previous record was set in August 2016, when it was 16,92 degrees Celsius.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, researchers have been concerned about the rise in land and sea temperatures.\n\nRecord spring heat in Spain and several Asian countries was accompanied by marine heat waves in areas where they are not common, such as the North Sea.\n\nA long-lasting heat wave with temperatures above 35 degrees Celsius hit China this week, and unfavorable weather conditions were also recorded in the South of America.\n\nThe record seen on Monday is also the highest average temperature since weather conditions have been recorded by satellite, which began in 1979.\n\nThe El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has three phases: warm, cold and neutral.\n\nThey represent the most powerful change in the climate system on Earth.\n\nClimatological researcher Leon Simmons believes that the temperature data is \"symbolically significant for our warming world.\n\n\"Now that the warmer phase of El Niño is starting, we can expect more daily, monthly and annual records over the next year and a half,\" he says.\n\nAverage temperatures last month were 1,46 degrees Celsius higher than those recorded across the planet during June between 1850 and 1900.\n\nHow to restore life and dry the house after a flood, the fourth time in seven years\n\n\"Climate change threatens our health\": Swiss women sued the state before the European Court\n\nWhy more and more scientists are protesting climate change\n\nGreat Britain had the warmest June, as well as Antarctica, where average temperatures of 8,7 degrees Celsius were read in the Ukrainian research base Vernadsky.\n\nScientists believe that new records will be set by the end of summer as El Niño gains strength.\n\n\"There is every chance that July will be the warmest month on record, and that means the warmest in the last 120.000 years,\" says Carsten Haustein of the University of Leipzig.\n\n\"While temperatures in the southern hemisphere of the Earth will drop slightly over the next few days, it looks like July and August will bring even warmer days as El Niño is now in full swing,\" adds the expert.\n\nClimate changes have also reached the Pešter Plateau, known for its low temperatures:\n\nFollow us on Facebook,Twitter i Viber.
