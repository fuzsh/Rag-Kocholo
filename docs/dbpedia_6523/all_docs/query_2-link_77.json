        "text": "Offenbach, 27 February 2023 – Winter 2022/23 in Germany was again much too warm compared to the reference periods. Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) press officer Uwe Kirsche commented: “This makes it the twelfth in a series of excessively warm winters in Germany. Climate change shows no signs of abating.” There was hardly any winter in lowland areas and temperatures at the turn of the year were even at record highs. This also brought high pollen loads early in the year from hazel and alder trees. Winter sports enthusiasts were only really able to enjoy themselves at higher altitudes. Overall, all three winter months were a little too dry. Sunshine was broadly average. This is the summary announced by the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) after an initial analysis of the observations from its approximately 2,000 measuring stations.\n\nExcessively mild winter but with a brief icy snap in December and record high temperatures at the turn of the year\n\nOverall, the average temperature during winter 2022/23 was 2.9 degrees Celsius (°C) and thus 2.7 degrees higher than the figure for the international reference period 1961–1990. The average temperature deviated by 1.5 degrees above normal compared to the current warmer 1991–2020 period. In Germany, the coldest phase of the winter was during the second third of December, when it was very icy. This period brought the lowest temperature of the winter anywhere in Germany, 19.3 °C, measured in Heinersreuth-Vollhof in the rural district of Bayreuth on 18 December. Then the turn of the year saw record temperatures, reaching a peak of over 20 °C on 31 December. At 20.8 °C, the warmest place was the station of Wielenbach in Upper Bavaria.\n\nWinter months slightly too dry overall\n\nGermany saw average precipitation during the winter of around 170 l/m² litres per square metre (l/m²). Compared to the periods 1961–1990, when the figure was 181 l/m², and 1991–2020 (190 l/m²), the precipitation measured by the DWD was around 6 and 10 per cent lower, respectively. Places in the Black Forest, the Harz and the Sauerland recorded over 500 l/m². On 12 January, the highest daily precipitation nationwide (71.9 l/m²) was recorded in Wipperfürth-Gardeweg in the western Sauerland. By way of comparison, during the entire winter less than 70 l/m² were measured in areas of the Upper Rhine Plain.\n\nDuring the winter the south received by far the most hours of sunshine\n\nAt around 160 hours, the sunshine duration in the winter was around 5 per cent higher than the average of 153 hours during the period of 1961 to 1990. Compared to the period 1991–2020 (170 hours), the deviation was around 6 per cent lower than normal. The foothills of the Alps saw most sunshine with over 240 hours. In some areas of the low mountain ranges and the north-east, there was less than 120 hours of sunshine.\n\nAll the values stated in this press release are provisional figures. The data used for the last two days of the winter are based on forecasts. Some of the measurements from DWD's network of stations were not yet available at the time of publication."
