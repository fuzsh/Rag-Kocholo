        "text": "Climate change is already having devastating effects in Germany. This report collates scientific projections of how climate impacts will play out up to 2050 and 2100, on low, medium and high emissions pathways.\n\nThe science shows that Germany will experience devastating climate impacts if it follows a high-emissions pathway. This past summer, many regions experienced the worst flooding in more than 1,000 years. Without urgent action, Germany will see a 466% increase in the population vulnerable to floods by 2050. Projections show Germany will also experience an 80% increase in heatwave frequency. The combined effect of these changes will cost Germany €98 billion by the end of the century.\n\nThe faster Germany adopts low-carbon policies, the less the climate impacts cascade and the more manageable they become. Limiting temperature rise to 2°C will see the cost of climate impacts in Germany drop from 2.95% of its GDP in 2100 under a high emissions scenario to 1.85%.\n\nImage © Bernd Lauter / Greenpeace"
