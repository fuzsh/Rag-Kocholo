        "text": "David Thiselton\n\nThe KZN Racing awards will be held on 30 August in the Classic Room at Hollywoodbets Greyville and there is going to be a quandary this year about the KZN Horse Of The Season just as there was last year.\n\nThe Horse Of The Year award, unlike the other awards, are open to horses from the yards of trainers who are not domiciled in KZN as long as the subject horse has had three or more runs in KZN. It can thus be won by an out of province horse who has excelled in KZN during the season. The other awards can only be won by horses from KZN yards, although Glen Kotzen and Dean Kannemeyer count as KZN yards because they have had satellite yards in KZN for many years.\n\nThe Horse Of The Year exclusion was probably made due to there not being a suitable candidate for some seasons in recent times. However, should not genuine KZN-trained horses like the Michael Roberts-trained See It Again last year and the Nathan Kotzen-trained Royal Victory this year be acknowledged in some way? Everybody in the industry would have viewed the former as the best horse from KZN in the 2022/2023 season, although the Peter Muscutt-trained Isivunguvungu could also have laid a claim, and this season Royal Victory is viewed by all and sundry as the best horse from KZN, although the Gareth van Zyl-trained Flag Man could also lay a claim having performed better on paper than Royal Victory in both the Gr 1 Hollywoodbets Durban July and Gr 1 wfa HKJC Champions Cup.\n\nThe Highveld racing awards could also potentially lead to an out of province horse being named Horse Of The Season. They are actually called the Highveld Feature Season awards as they go on performances of horses on the Highveld in features races during the season. Royal Victory was thus named the Champion Middle Distance Horse and Champion Older Male in the Highveld feature Season awards this year and he was only ousted in the Horse Of The Season award by the outstanding Mike de Kock-trained Gimme A Nother.\n\nHowever, the big difference is that the Highveld features only have a sprinkling of out of province horses competing in them. The Horse Of The Season award will virtually always be won by a Highveld horse and was this year it went to the outstanding Mike de Kock-trained Gimme A Nother, even though Royal Victory became the first out of province horse in history to win both of the Highveld’s biggest races, the Gr 1 Betway Summer Cup and the Gr 1 World Pool Premier’s Champions Challenge.\n\nThe KZN horses, on the other hand, have to compete with every champion from every province, because all champions from around the country descend on KZN for the three month long world famous racing festival, The Champions Season.\n\nLast year the Horse Of The Season was won by the Sean Tarry-trained Princess Calla, who won three Gr 1s in KZN during the season.\n\nThis year the favourite must be the Mike de Kock-trained Dave The King. He qualifies because he ran in KZN three times in the season and he won two open weight for age Gr 1s in KZN. He was in fact the only horse in the country to have won two open wfa Gr 1s last season.\n\nHowever, Royal Victory is a history-making KZN horse. On top of being the first out of province horse to do the Highveld double of the Summer Cup and Premier’s Champions Challenge, he is in fact the first out of province horse to have ever won the Premier’s Champions Challenge and the second out of province horse this millennium to have won the Summer Cup.\n\nHe could well go home empty-handed on KZN Awards night. If Dave The King is to be named Horse Of The Season then he must also surely be named Champion Older Male. Furthermore, the Dean Kannemeyer-trained Green With Envy ran three times in KZN during the season, so qualifies for awards as explained earlier by Kannemeyer’s KZN status, and like Royal Victory he won two middle distance Gr 1s during the season and one of them was in KZN, so he must be in pole position to win the Middle Distance award.\n\nSo the widely acknowledged best horse in KZN, Royal Victory, might be completely unacknowledged in his home province.\n\nThere are special awards occasionally put on at racing award ceremonies and this might be a case in point of creating one.\n\nHowever, what would probably be better considering the realities of racing in KZN during any given season, would be to create a new permanent award to acknowledge KZN’s best horse of the season. The award should only be open to horses from KZN yards.\n\nSource: https://www.goldcircle.co.za/kzn-awards-horse-of-the-season-quandary/\n\nAndrew Harrison\n\nKeagan de Melo, back to Hong Kong later this month, did his old boss Dean Kannemeyer proud last Wednesday with two winners. With stable rider Craig Zackey on holiday, KZN-based Sean Veale has been spreading his talent country-wide and keeps the ride on Mc Dazzler for Kannemeyer in the first at Hollywoodbets Greyville today.\n\nMc Dazzler gets one more chance. He had every chance last run under Veale on the turf in first time blinkers but was rather one-paced and finished out of the money. However, his two best efforts have been on the poly over course and distance and he can finally come to the party.\n\nShould he fail again, Galatus could pick up the pieces as he makes his poly debut over what should prove to be a more suitable trip given his pedigree. Although a well-beaten third last run this trip should suit. Record High has run his two best races on the poly and with the best of the draw he should make a bold bid and is a must in all calculations.\n\nDeception Pass could be one of the better bets on a competitive card. The Mike and Adam Azzie-trained Highveld visitor has not been out of the money in six starts and will be looking to break a string of runner-up berths in the second. He makes his poly debut but is a lightly raced four-year-old and should take to the surface. Teriyaki has another wide draw to contend with but is seldom too far back and should finish in the money but the dark horse could be Turn Around who was a beaten favourite at just his second start after making a promising debut and can do better this trip.\n\nBurning Man is the obvious choice in the first leg of the Pick 6. He makes his poly debut on the back of three runner-placings and a beaten favourite at his last two. He was caught late last run and should make another bold effort. Red Mountain is seldom far back and has been consistent of late. Robbie Hill’s runner stays the trip and should be right there. Bella’s Pablo has his best recent run on the poly and two good efforts since returning from the Cape. He should also be a big runner.\n\nThinks get a lot more difficult from here on. Aberdeen has been disappointing after showing early promise but he did show a return to form when tried on the poly last time out. Glen Kotzen’s runner looks well handicapped and could start at tempting odds. Alyson Wright saddles likely favourite Pirate Prince who has been racing in much stronger company of late and although not winning he has not been far off. Rachel Venniker takes 1.5kg off his back to enhance his chances. Visiting Viva Spirit has patchy Highveld form but is useful on his day. If he takes to the poly he could be dangerous along with My Lady Soul who takes on males. Although a well-beaten third behind Mascherina last time out, Mascherina has since gone on to frank that form in feature company.\n\nThe fifth is another competitive handicap. Visiting Corne Spies-trained Linganomore will strip a fit horse after racing five time within the last month and she was a close-up second last time out. She has run on the poly and is never far back. Dennis Bosch appears to have slipped Ocean Palace under the radar. Although a well-beaten third last run that form has since been franked in better company and she looks well weighted with Rachel Venniker’s allowance. There is not much to Roy’s Rocker but she is as game as they come. However, she picked up an unwanted seven-pound penalty for her modest fourth place last time out which could be her undoing.\n\nSpies saddles Zoombomber in the sixth who is showing signs of returning to his best form. He has done well on the poly before and although this is a tricky handicap he should at least finish in the money. Secret Recipe takes on males but has consistent Highveld form and was a comfortable winner last time out. She has started favourite at her last two starts and the synthetic surface should suit. Shoefella made a winning debut on the poly but also raced in first time blinkers. A repeat effort could see him follow up. There should be little between L’Ultimo and Bally Magic with less than a length between them when last they met. Both have wide draws to contend with.\n\nTwo veterans of the turf could fight out the seventh albeit on the poly. Preemptive Strike bids for his sixth win, his last coming over course and distance. He has run two gallant places over a furlong further at recent outings and is back over what looks to be his optimum trip. The year older Knight Warrior bids for his eighth win and goes well over course and distance. Venniker’s allowance could prove the difference between winning and losing. Zanthar is a recent Highveld maiden winner. He has shown plenty in useful company but the male juvenile form of last season does seem suspect. That said, he cannot be left out of any calculations. Mar Del Plata is relatively lightly raced but has not been out of the money since shedding his maiden and must have a winning chance.\n\nA tricky handicap faces punters in the last. Vision Of Will is at her best over course and distance and has been touched off at her last two. She now gets a 4kg claimer up from the best of the draw and can go all the way. Arverni Princess is at her best on the poly but found stable companion Drive By too good for her last time out. The tables could be turned given the turnover in weights. Surprise package could be visiting King Harry. The five-year-old has only had three starts for no show but the switch to poly with blinkers could bring out the best. Watch the betting here.\n\nSource: https://www.goldcircle.co.za/last-chance-for-mc-to-dazzle/\n\nRACE 1\n\n2 MC DAZZLER 3 GALACTUS 1 RECORD HIGH 7 WHEREVERILAYMYHAT\n\nSummary: MC DAZZLER (2) gets one more chance. He had every chance last run on the turf in first time blinkers but was rather one-paced. His two best efforts have been on the poly over course and distance and he can finally come to the party. GALACTUS (3) makes his poly debut over what should prove to be a more suitable trip given his pedigree. Although a well-beaten third last run this trip should suit. RECORD HIGH (1) has run his two best races on the poly. He has the best of the draw and should make a bold bid. A must for all bets. WHEREVERILAYMYHAT (7) tried much further last run. He is lightly raced and could prefer this trip. (Andrew Harrison: 2-3-1-7).\n\nRACE 2\n\n5 DECEPTION PASS 6 TURN AROUND 9 TERIYAKI 1 DEPUTY CHIEF\n\nSummary: DECEPTION PASS (5) has not been out of the money in six starts and will be looking to break a string of runner-up berths. He makes his poly debut but is a lightly raced four-year-old and should take to the surface. TERIYAKI (9) has another wide draw to contend with but is seldom too far back and should finish in the money. TURN AROUND (6) was a beaten favourite at just his second start after making a promising debut. He can do better this trip. DEPUTY CHIEF (1) was all at sea on debut but that run should have brought him on and the extra furlong should suit. (Andrew Harrison: 5-6-9-1).\n\nRACE 3\n\n2 BURNING MAN 10 RED MOUNTAIN 4 BELLA’S PABLO 5 JUPITER HILLS\n\nSummary: BURNING MAN (2) makes his poly debut on the back of three runner-placings; a beaten favourite at his last two. He was caught late last run but should make another bold effort. RED MOUNTAIN (10) is seldom far back and has been consistent of late. He stays the trip and should be right there. BELLA’S PABLO (4) has his best recent run on the poly and two good efforts since returning from the Cape. He should also be a big runner. JUPITER HILLS (5) was much improved in cheek pieces last run and is one to watch in the market. (Andrew Harrison: 2-10-4-5).\n\nRACE 4\n\n5 ABERDEEN 2 PIRATE PRINCE 4 VIVA SPIRIT 9 MY LADY SOUL\n\nSummary: ABERDEEN (5) has been a little disappointing after showing early promise but he did show a return to form when tried on the poly last time out. He looks well handicapped here and could start at tempting odds. PIRTAE PRINCE (2) has been racing in much stronger company of late and although not winning he has not been far off. Rachel Venniker takes 1.5kg off his back and he is your likely favourite. Visiting VIVA SPIRIT (4) has patchy Highveld form but is useful on his day. If he takes to the poly he could be dangerous. MY LADY SOUL (9) takes on males and was a well-beaten third behind recent feature winner Mascherina last time out. Mascherina has since franked that form. (Andrew Harrison: 5-2-4-9).\n\nRACE 5\n\n4 LINGANOMORE 7 OCEAN PALACE 5 ROY’S ROCKER 3 ENGLISH PRIMROSE\n\nSummary: Competitive handicap. Visiting mare LINGANOMORE (4) will strip a fit horse after racing five time within the last month and she was a close-up second last time out. She has run on the poly and is never far back. Dennis Bosch appears to have slipped OCEAN PALACE (7) in under the radar. Although a well-beaten third last run that form has since been franked in better company and she looks well weighted with Rachel Venniker’s allowance. There is not much to ROY’S ROCKER (5) but she is as game as they come. However, she picked up an unwanted seven-pound penalty for her modest fourth place last time out which could be her undoing here. ENGLISH PRIIMROSE (3) has shown recent improvement and has a strong money chance in this line-up. (Andrew Harrison: 4-7-5-3).\n\nRACE 6\n\n6 ZOOMBOMBER 8 SECRET RECIPE 3 SHOEFELLA 10 L’ULTIMO\n\nSummary: ZOOMBOMBER (6) is showing signs of returning to his best form and he has done well on the poly. This is a tricky handicap but he should at least finish in the money. SECRET RECIPE (8) takes on males but has consistent Highveld form and was a comfortable winner last time out. She has started favourite at her last two starts and the synthetic surface should suit. SHOEFELLA (3) made a winning debut on the poly but also raced in first time blinkers.

Both have wide draws to contend with. (Andrew Harrison: 6-8-3-10).\n\nRACE 7\n\n7 PREEMPTIVE STRIKE 8 KNIGHT WARRIOR 6 ZANTHAR 2 MAR DEL PLATA\n\nSummary: The two veterans of the turf could fight this one out albeit on the poly. PREEMPTIVE STRIKE (7) bids for his sixth win, his last coming over course and distance. He has run two gallant places over a furlong further at recent outings and is back over what looks to be his optimum trip. The year older KNIGHT WARRIOR (8) bids for his eighth win and goes well over course and distance. Rachel Venniker’s allowance could prove the difference between winning and losing.

(Andrew Harrison: 7-8-6-2).\n\nRACE 8\n\n1 VISION OF WILL 10 ARVERNI PRINCESS 5 KING HARRY 8 DRIVE BY\n\nSummary: Tricky handicap to end off with. VISION OF WILL (1) is at her best over course and distance and has been touched off at her last two. She now gets a 4kg claimer up from the best of the draw and can go all the way. ARVERNI PRINCESS (10) is at her best on the poly but found stable companion DRIVE BY (8) too good for her last time out. The tables could be turned given the turnover in weights. Surprise package could be visiting KING HARRY (5). The five-year-old has only had three starts for no show but the switch to poly with blinkers could bring out the best. Watch the betting here.

Unfortunately with Covid we didn’t recruit for two years, so we have a bit of a gap that we’re trying to fill. It’s also why we have quite a few Mauritians with us at present, we try to find people who have had a bit of foundation training. So next year we will have a lot of race riders in the system. We have unfortunately lost our apprentice races due to the lack of race riders, we don’t have enough for the field, so we’re trying to build back up to that, which we will do shortly.”\n\nOne of the apprentices from last year, Malesela Katjedi, qualified to become a fully fledged jockey recently and he celebrated it with a double at the Vaal last Thursday, his second meeting since qualification.\n\nThe Academy had said on August 1, “We are thrilled to announce that Malesela Keratile Katjedi has officially qualified as a professional jockey today, marking the culmination of an impressive apprenticeship that includes 73 career wins. Originally from Naboomspruit, Limpopo, Keratile has just completed his fifth year at the Academy. This achievement is particularly significant for Keratile, driven by the memory of his late father, ‘LJ’ Katjedi, and inspired by his grandfather, Amos Katjedi, who introduced him to the world of horse racing when he was just ten years old. Keratile joined the Academy in 2020, and his journey has been marked by notable achievements. A highlight of his apprenticeship came on the 2nd of October 2022, when he rode a four-timer at Hollywoodbets Greyville Racecourse. He concluded his apprenticeship with exceptional success, being awarded the Highveld Feature Season Champion Apprentice and Highveld Apprentice Champion titles. In his final race as an apprentice he secured a victory aboard Full Go trained by Billy Ruiters, at Vaal Racecourse on the 25th of July 2024. As Malesela Keratile Katjedi transitions into his new role as a professional jockey, we extend our heartfelt congratulations and best wishes His journey reflects remarkable dedication, skill, and the enduring legacy of his father.”\n\nIt is well documented how Keratile’s father “LJ” chose a career as a jockey above one as a computer programmer and he had the world at his feet when his life was tragically cut short in a car accident in 2006, just eight days after he had qualified as a fully fledged jockey.\n\nSiyando Sosibo and Siphesihle Hlengwa will also be qualifying soon.\n\nKobeli Lihaba was national champion apprentice last season with 49 wins. Katjedi had the most wins by an apprentice in the Western Cape, a paltry two, which underlined the effect no recruitments in the two Covid years had on the apprentice ranks. Lihaba led the KZN and East Cape tables on 29 and 13 wins respectively and Katjedi and Siyanda Sosibo both had 17 wins in the Central Provinces.\n\nRachel Venniker became a fully fledged jockey in January, but was still in second place on the log by the end of the season with 26 wins. She gave the world famous SAJA another boost with a world class display of riding at Ascot on Saturday, where she finished tied first in the individual standings of the iconic Shergar Cup and only lost because she had had one winner to Hayley Turner’s too.\n\nTrent Mayhew was next best on last season’s national apprentice log with 23 wins and Paddy said that now that he had ridden out his 4kg claim it would be easier for him as he would be able to ride a little heavier and feel stronger.\n\nWynne is bullish there will be plenty more apprentices coming through to follow in the like of Venniker’s footsteps.\n\nHe said, “There are always promising apprentices. There’s always someone coming through.”\n\nHe said about Brevan Plaaitjies and Nirvan Nastili, “Brevan is still learning, but he has potential. Nirvan has improved a lot in Jo’Burg and since he’s been going to the East Cape.”\n\nGqeberha apprentice Donald Geerthsen is four wins aways from his 50th success.\n\nApprentice Jacie Botes recently had his first win in his 23rd ride.\n\nDamyan Pillay has had three places in 12 rides.\n\nMauritian Iannish Taka gets surprisingly few rides and has only had one win in SA since arriving in May. He had 28 wins in Mauritius.\n\nMauritian apprentice Girish Samo-Burthia made his debut last week with two rides at The Vaal and there should be more Academy debutants soon.\n\nQatar apprentices Mohammed Hassan Alabdulmalik and Abdulla Rashid Al-Mansouri were in South Africa for a period recently.\n\nAlthough they were both over on a private ticket this time, SAJA are in communication with the Qatar Racing and Equestrian Club to create a more formal platform for apprentices to come out here.\n\nIf the Qatar riders are as good as Mohammed then trainers, owners and the public will welcome such a relationship.\n\nSource: https://www.goldcircle.co.za/apprentice-riders-will-be-more-prominent/\n\nDavid Thiselton\n\nRachel Venniker rode overseas for the second time in her career this weekend and made South Africa proud for a second time.\n\nThis time she did it on arguably the world’s biggest stage, Ascot racecourse, where she rode for the Rest Of The World team in the iconic Shergar Cup and she tied for first place with British legend Hayley Turner in the Alistair Haggis Silver Saddle competition i.e. the award for the day’s most successful individual rider. Turner was awarded the Silver Saddle for the third time in her career based on her having had two winners to Rachel’s one.\n\nIn February Venniker became the first female jockey to win in Saudi Arabia, when winning the US$400 000 Invest Saudi International Jockeys Challenge Stakes. This was in addition to her being the first female to be apprentice champion in South Africa, a feat she achieved twice, the first female to have 100 wins in a season in SA, the first female to ride in South Africa’s greatest race, the Gr 1 Hollywoodbets Durban July, the first female to ride a place in Cape Town’s biggest race, the Gr 1 WSB Met and she is likely the first female to have won a SA Triple Crown race, landing the Gr 2 WSB Gauteng Guineas last year.\n\nShe came within a headbob on Saturday of landing the Silver Saddle, a trophy which boasts such big names as Frankie Dettori, Pat Eddery, Kieren Fallon, Hugh Bowman, Gerald Mosse, Richard Hughes, Jamie Spencer, Emma-Jane Wilson, Silvestre De Souza andf Hayley Turner.\n\nAfter a win in the first leg followed by a sixth, a fifth and a second, Rachel led the points standings for the Silver Saddle going into the last race.\n\nShe sat in last place on the Michael Bell-trained 4/1 shot Carrytheone and extracted a scything run to move into a clear third place.\n\nIt looked as if she had done enough to win the Silver Saddle, because Hayley Turner looked booked for second place on the 100/30 favourite New Image as Joanna Mason on the pacemaker Yantardi was still going well in front.\n\nHowever, Turner extracted a late lunge from New Image and the Frankel gelding got up on the headbob.\n\nThat saw Rachel and Hayley finish on an equal 35 points, but it was Haley’s second win of the day.\n\nThere were six races in all with each rider guaranteed five rides.\n\nRachel Venniker of the Rest Of The World team won the first, Haley Turner of The Ladies team won the second, Rachel King of the Rest Of The World team won the third, Billy Loughnane of the Great Britain and Ireland team won the fourth, German champion Bauyrzhan Murzabayev of the European team won the fifth and Turner won the sixth.\n\nThe Rest Of The World team was made up entirely of females, and they finished in third place on 58 points behind the Ladies Team, who retained the trophy on 71 points, Europe on 60 and Great Britain and Ireland on 55.\n\nThe final Alistair Haggis Silver Saddle standings were: Hayley Turner LADIES 35, Rachel Venniker ROW 35, Billy Loughnane GBI 28, Jose-Luis Borrego EUR 28, Marie Velon LADIES 22, Alberto Sanna EUR 17, Seamie Heffernan GBI 15,Bauyrzhan Murzabayev EUR 15, Rachel King ROW 15, Joanna Mason LADIES 14, Tadhg O’Shea GBI 12, Nanako Fujita ROW 8.\n\nVenniker landed a plum ride in the first leg on the William Knight-trained Aclaim gelding Holkam Bay and she covered this 4/1 favourite up nicely from an outside draw in the five furlong event down the straight. He travelled supremely and it was race over a long way out after she had switched him out. He won by 2,75 lengths much to the delight of South African fans watching from afar.\n\nRachel said, “He ran his heart out. Everything worked out perfectly. As soon as I asked him the question he changed legs and I thought ‘they’ll never catch me now’. I’m so proud I’ve won a race here. What a remarkable feeling. I’m over the moon. It’s so fantastic to make South Africa proud and make the boss (Michael Roberts) proud.”In the second race her Michael Stoute-trained mount Fox Journey also started favourite, albeit at 5/1, but the writing was on the wall early as he overraced a touch in front in the two mile event. Rachel did well to keep him going for a 5,25 length sixth.She rode a cracking fifth on the 33/1 shot Bulldog Drummond in the six furlong event as this horse was outpaced at the back but she managed to extract a late finish from him for some crucial points.In the one mile four furlong event Rachel had her mount Champagne Prince in midfield and extracted a resolute finish from him. He failed by a neck to get up.After the thrilling last race, when third on Carrytheone, Rachel said, ““He ran a cracker. He takes quite a tug so I had to just settle him in and he quickened up really well. I am not used to riding at 10st, the saddle is quite heavy! It is disappointing just to be pipped by Hayley but it has been fantastic. I have had a winner, a second and a third. I can’t complain. It has been a very good day and been above and beyond my expectations.” A proud Michael Roberts said, “Ascot is not an easy track, but Rachel rode it like a pro. She carried all the advice out to perfection and she made us all proud today. She also received some very nice accolades from my friends in the UK.”\n\nSource: https://www.goldcircle.co.za/venniker-does-south-africa-proud/"
