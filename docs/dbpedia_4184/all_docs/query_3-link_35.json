Today it plays host to the biggest race on the calendar in the G1 Durban July at Greyville which was first run in 1897.\n\nHorse racing is regulated by the National Horse Racing Authority, formerly The Jockey Club of South Africa, which was founded in 1882. It aims to ensure that thoroughbred racing is provided with the highest level of integrity.\n\nHorse racing takes place in South Africa 364 days of the year which generates a massive R $7 billion turnover. The two bodies which control racing in South Africa are Phumelela Gaming and Leisure and Gold Circle.\n\nPhumelela was formed in 1997 when horse racing was corporatized in Gauteng to ensure it was competitive as the gambling market was set to grow with the legalization of casinos and a national lottery. They contribute around half the country’s prize money which is generated from tote turnover. All tote betting is commingled into a national pool.\n\nPhumelela is licensed to operate horse racing and tote betting in seven of South Africa’s nine provinces (Free State, Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, and Gauteng) while Golden Circle control horseracing in Kwazulu-Natal which has racecourses Greyville and Scottsville.\n\nGold Circle was formed in 1996 when the Durban Turf Club, Clairwood Turf Club and Pietermaritzburg Turf Club amalgamated. In 2005, Gold Circle and Phumelela, established the National Racing Bureau to handle the administration of racing to ensure the sport was streamlined in South Africa.\n\nPhumelela, in partnership with Gold Circle, manages Tellytrack which has the exclusive rights to broadcast the vision of racing in South Africa.\n\nThe “big three” races on the South Africa calendar are the Durban July at Greyville in July, the Cape Town Met at Kenilworth in January, and the Summer Cup at Turffontein in November.\n\nLeading international trainer Mike de Kock is South Africa’s most successful trainer with 129 Grade 1 winners. He has had much success around the globe including in the UAE, Hong Kong, Singapore, United Kingdom and USA.\n\nHe is an eight-time champion trainer in South Africa and won the Summer Cup six times, Durban July four times and Cape Met three times. He claimed another South African Triple Crown in 2021 when Malmoos won the South African Derby.\n\nTop young jockey Luke Ferrais became the youngest jockey to win the South African Triple Crown in 2021 when he teamed up with de Kock and steered Malmoos to victory in the SA Derby.\n\nThe most famous jockey to come out of South Africa is Douglas “Durban Demon” Whtye who dominated the Hong Kong racing scene winning the Jockeys’ title 13 years in a row (2001-2013).\n\nSouth African Racecourses\n\nThere are seven racecourses in operation in South Africa which hosts race meetings 364 days a year.\n\nFairview (Eastern Cape)\n\nDraaifontein Road, Greenbushes, Port Elizabeth\n\nDirection: Clockwise\n\nFairview racecourse opened in 2007 which boasts a stabling complex and various training tracks and facilities. A new polytrack opened in 2013 which hosts meetings at the Port Elizabeth racecourse.\n\nRacing mainly takes place on Friday and they host 20 Listed races throughout the year including the Port Elizabeth Gold Cup in June.\n\nArlington which was the other racecourse in Port Elizabeth closed in 2013 after hosting race meetings for 63 years.\n\nKenilworth (Western Cape)\n\nRosmead Avenue, Kenilworth, Cape Town\n\nDirection: Anti-clockwise\n\nKenilworth racecourse is the oldest in the country established in 1881 offering majestic views as it sits at the bottom of the Table Mountain in Cape Town.

The biggest meeting is in late January which features four Grade 1 races including the Cape Met.\n\nThree are three racecourses at Kenilworth with the main one called the “new” track an oval-shaped 2800 metres circumference track with a short straight. The “old” track is oval-shaped and used during autumn and winter months. There is also a short track of 1200 metres. Racing mainly takes place on Wednesday and Saturdays.\n\nDurbanville (Western Cape)\n\nBowlers Way, Durbanville, Cape Town\n\nDirection: Anti-clockwise\n\nDurbanville racecourse is a unique track with great drainage which makes it a perfect winter racecourse, which is where they host most of their meetings.\n\nThe track is 2200 metres in circumference with a run in of approximately 600 metres and a downhill run in the straight to the winning post. Given these features the course can produce some track specialists which tends to favour horses drawn well.\n\nTheir biggest race of the year on the program is the Listed Settlers Trophy in late September.\n\nGreyville (Kwazulu-Natal)\n\n150 Avondale Road, Greyville, Durban\n\nDirection: Clockwise\n\nGreyville recourse is one of two tracks in Kwazulu-Natal along with Scottsville which are both controlled by Gold Circle with the naming sponsor Hollywoodbets since 2019. It has also hosted night racing since 1996.\n\nIt is a large pear-shaped racecourse with a circumference of 2800 metres; 2400 metres under lights.

It is uphill between 2400 metres to 1,800 metres and then slopes downhill for the next 800 metres before uphill for another 500 metres. It features a straight of approximately 500 metres which is flat run to the winning post.\n\nA 2000 metre all-weather Polytrack opened in 2014 which is on the inside of the racecourse. The polytrack is in action every Friday night between September and April.\n\nIt is home to Africa’s biggest race and massive event in the Durban July which is a colourful celebration with around 50,000 guests packing the racecourse in early July.

Another feature meeting in late June features 2 Grade 2 races in the Track and Ball Derby and the Track and Ball Oaks.\n\nVaal (Free State)\n\nAscot Road, Viljoensdrif\n\nDirection: Clockwise\n\nVaal is a sharp turning track with a large circumference of 2900 metres and boasts the largest straight in the country at 1000 metres.\n\nThe straight has a chute for 600 metres creating a straight course of 1600 metres and is home to great sprint races. Racing in Vaal is predominantly mid-week with meetings on Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nTurffontein (Gauteng)\n\nTurf Club Street, Turffontein, Johannesburg\n\nDirection: Clockwise\n\nTurffontein racecourse hosts some of the best racing in the country. It has a long history being founded in 1887 by the Johannesburg Turf Club and features an impressive backdrop of the Johannesburg buildings.\n\nThere are two tracks: an inner and an outer track. The main (outer) track has long bends and an incline from the 1200 metres to the final turn into the straight making it a testing course.\n\nRacing is predominantly on a Saturday and features some great Grade 1 races across the year most notably the Summer Cup in late November and the South African Derby in early April.\n\nFeature Races in South Africa\n\nCape Town Met – Kenilworth (January)\n\nThe Cape Town Met (Metropolitan) was first run in 1883 and is a race over 2000 metres under weight-for-age conditions. It’s without doubt Cape Town’s biggest race on the calendar and one of the biggest on the African calendar.\n\nOriginally run in November and over 1600 metres it moved to the January slot on the calendar in 1947.\n\nPopular local Pocket Power has won the race an incredible three times (2007,2008,2009).\n\nAnother popular winner was Mike de Kock-trained Horse Chestnut (1999) who was South Africa’s first horse to win the Triple Crown (Guineas, Classic and Derby). Rainbow Bridge won the 2021 edition, claiming the race for the second time.\n\nSouth African Derby – Turffontein (April)\n\nThe South African Derby is the premier race for three-year-olds run over 2450 metres at Turffontein.

It attracts a capacity crowd of 50,000 racegoers.\n\nIt is the pinnacle event for trainers, jockeys, and owners with only six horses having won the race on two occasions.\n\nThe Justin Snaith-trained Do It Again was the last horse to do so winning in 2018 and 2019. Snaith has trained the winner on five occasions and is aiming to surpass Syd Laird who has a record seven July winners.\n\nSummer Cup – Turffontein (November)\n\nKnown as the “People’s race” the Summer Cup has been run since 1887 and is one of the most prestigious races on the calendar.\n\nThe race day itself is a huge celebration and the only meeting which features a half-time show, bringing together hundreds of performers to entertain the crowd for 20 minutes before the main race.\n\nThe time and name changed at various points over the years, but Phumelela reintroduced it to run its traditional slot back in 1999.\n\nSouth Africa Grade 1 Races (29 races)\n\nRace\n\nTrack\n\nWhen\n\nDistance\n\nPrize money (Rand)\n\nConditions\n\nL’Ormarins Queen’s Plate\n\nKenilworth\n\nJan
