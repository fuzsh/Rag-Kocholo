        "text": "Geoff_R said:\n\nJustin, I think the best scene in this film is the sequence with the boy and girl near the pool, their kiss...her death... Visually, it transcends the rest of the film. I think the scenes between the father and son were bogged down by dialogue.\n\nThe score is great! Powerful music!\n\nI can't get that sequence out of my head... 'girl in the water'....'the shot and blood hit on the face'....'the kiss'... awesome\n\nThanks for sharing the film!\n\nJustin,\n\nIt looks like you're getting a lot of good feedback. And the comments are very consistent.\n\nGeoff's comment regarding 'the scene with the kiss, the gun shot, girl in the water' seems to be the one that everyone here really likes as well. There is this calm, quiet moment before you hear the gun shot and see the spray of blood and you still don't know what has happened. That moment seems to linger longer than the actual screen time and then you see the guy falling out of frame. Everyone I've talked to agrees that it's a lovely piece of cinema.\n\nA lot of people really seem to like the underwater footage. Your vision realized! Good call! And props to Amanda. What a trooper being thrown into the water over and over and ...\n\nI also really liked the shots of the 'hitman' when he was following, and almost toying, with his victim as he shot a round, he had this weird thing that he did with his mouth. I thought in those short shots it projected a lot of his character.\n\nGreat use of the music to set the tone at the appropriate places. You have a gift for that timing.\n\nIt was a distinct pleasure working with you and I appreciate your ability to get your 'vision' into the finished product. Congratulations on a great flick.\n\n-Robert\n\nRobertE said:\n\nJustin,\n\nIt looks like you're getting a lot of good feedback.

You have a gift for that timing.\n\nIt was a distinct pleasure working with you and I appreciate your ability to get your 'vision' into the finished product. Congratulations on a great flick.\n\nI just noticed. Thanks for posting some BTS images. So we can see the 'director on set'. I love those shots of you in the pool. That's dedication!\n\n-Robert\n\nThank you so much again Robert. It was so great for you to make the trip up to help. I'll most definitely be asking you again. Perhaps next round I'll have a 'massive' budget to work with. (right.) Amanda and the underwater stuff was great. It's tough to approach an actress and say.. \"Are you willing to drown for me?\" Ya, those BTS... looking forward to seeing the shots from Greg's still camera and tommy's jaw-biting performance was dead on. :thumbup::grin:\n\nAaron Marshall said:\n\nJustin,\n\nI think this is your best film yet. I was very impressed by many of the shots. The underwater shots were especially impressive. Your score was rocking too. It helps that you're so intimate with the material from all angles. It gave you a lot more time to attack the score because you didn't have to do as much prep work, finding out motivation etc.\n\nThe acting was the weakest link. The singular performances weren't bad, but it felt like the two were miles away from one another emotionally. I don't mean that in the sense of the story, but in the sense of judging a technical acting performance.\n\nThe special fx looked awesome! Overall you did a great job and should be proud.\n\nThanks Aaron! Tackling most all those FX shots was a pain in the arse specially since I had relied on some of my friends from the German Film School to help out. Only one of them did. (plane/opening explosion and watch faces). Ugg.. lesson learned. Start earlier without any other planned projects on the plate.\n\nActing... I thought they did a good job and I was proud of their performances. I wished I had more CU's of matt as he was stuck in medium shot land.\n\nHerman Witkam said:\n\nSweeeéét\n\nI was impressed with the overall production quality. Great visuals, and most of all, great score!!\n\nI agree with Aaron about the actor's performances. I also think you've put too much narrative/dialogue into it. The story seemed way to complicated to rush through in a mere 6 mins.\n\nThank you Herman!! If I had a chance, I'd probably go back again and re-work some of the score, but oh well.. I guess it'll do for now. Story... ya, there was a lot to pack in such a short time frame. And to think the cut before this was 9 minutes of even more side-story stuff.\n\nOf course I enjoyed all your pletheras of scores too. Looks like you are building yourself a wonderful little reel that will snagg you the feature films in no time.\n\ncheers DVXr's iN DvX Land.\n\nNow GO VOTE!!\n\n/j"
