        "text": "Video: Ascendance\n\nAscendance is a tribute to nature’s unpredictable power and beauty. I went out to film the Perseid meteor shower but I encountered so much more. When you are out there, you never know for sure what nature will bring. Always be ready for a magical experience.\n\nShot in Joshua Tree National Park and the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest during the Perseid meteor shower. Features ancient trees, lightning, rainbows, meteors, the Milky Way, and lots of stars. Play full screen so you can count the meteors!\n\nMusic is Fields of Honor by Justin R.
