        "text": "Killer Bean Forever is a 2009 computer-animated action feature film directed and written by Jeff Lew. The film features Vegas E. Trip, Bryan Session, David Guilmette, and Matthew Tyler, and additional music created Justin R. Durban. In the film, Killer Bean is tasked with killing a secret target, but is put in jeopardy due to a nearby dance party not turning down the music.\n\nPlot\n\nAt 2:43 am, Killer Bean, a Shadow Bean working for the Shadow Agency, calls the DJ in a nearby warehouse across the street, who is having a dance party with his group of gangsters, to turn down the music. The DJ turns up the music instead and does not listen to Killer Bean's orders, which leads to Killer Bean killing the gangsters in the warehouse. Before the DJ gets killed, he reveals to Killer Bean that he is the nephew of mob boss Cappuccino and that killing everyone in the warehouse will put Killer Bean in a difficult situation with his uncle, but Killer Bean recklessly kills the DJ anyway. That morning, a police bean and Detective Cromwell were sent to investigate the warehouse. Vagan, a former Shadow Bean working for Cappuccino, arrives at the warehouse and is informed by Cromwell about Killer Bean shooting up the warehouse and that he is after Cappuccino.\n\nLater that morning, Killer Bean is awoken by loud sounds outside his apartment, which leads him to attempt to murder one of the cops. Before he can shoot, the Shadow Agency calls him, preventing him from assassinating Cromwell. When he answers, the Voice scolds him for being reckless and not killing the correct target and demands that Killer Bean should stick to the \"mission\". In a restaurant located in the far east, Jet Bean, another Shadow Bean, is eating in the restaurant when he receives a call from the agency. The agency tells him that he is assigned to a secret mission in Beantown, which is to kill Killer Bean, and that it must be done quickly. When he is about to leave the restaurant, Bing Bow, the owner, reminds him that he has not paid the food bill in three months after Jet Bean reminds him that he will be away for a long time. When Jet Bean refuses to pay it, Bing Bow tells Chintow, the chef, that Jet Bean said his food tasted like \"asscrack\", leading to Chintow chasing after Jet Bean. Jet Bean knocks out Chintow and leaves while Bing Bow tells him he does not have to pay the bill and that it is free of charge.\n\nAt a meeting in Cappuccino's tower, Cappuccino tells his beans about narcotic sales dropping down and criticizes them for not valuing their jobs. He decides to lay them off by knocking them off the building. While laying off his beans, Vagan interrupts him and informs him about Killer Bean shooting up the warehouse and killing his nephew. Angered by this, he sends Vagan on a mission to kill Killer Bean.\n\nMeanwhile, Cromwell is analyzing the evidence at the warehouse with his associate Harry and leaves to go to one of Cappuccino's suspected warehouses where Killer Bean might show up, while Killer Bean arrives there already. When Killer Bean arrives, he finds a note saying, \"Shadow Bean, you are too late\". While reading it, he notices Vagan, who fires a shot, missing Killer Bean. The two have a shootout with each other until Killer Bean fires a shot that disables the scope of Vagan's sniper rifle. Both of them leave unharmed. After leaving the warehouse, Killer Bean enters a bar to have some breakfast and watch the news. Cromwell arrives at the warehouse but sees Killer Bean inside a bar. While inside, Cromwell tells Killer Bean that both of them can work together to bring down Cappuccino, but Killer Bean denies it. When Killer Bean leaves the bar, Cromwell points his revolver at him, confronting him about the identity of \"Shadow Bean\". Killer Bean refuses to answer, throws him to the ground, and leaves. Afterwards, Cromwell calls Harry and tells him about his encounter with Killer Bean and about the note regarding the Shadow Beans. Harry tells him about the Shadow Agency, a private organization that formerly worked with the government, and that he thought the agency disbanded years ago.\n\nThat night, Killer Bean arrives at another warehouse owned by Cappuccino. After jumping in and killing more of Cappuccino's beans including the mercenaries hired by Vagan, he is knocked out by an explosion caused by Vagan's motorcycle. When he wakes up, he finds himself tied to a chair and is interrogated by Cappuccino for killing his nephew and his beans, and his reason to kill Cappuccino. After breaking free from a missed shot by one of the beans, he tells Cappuccino that Vagan was his target all along and that Cappuccino just got in his way. Cappuccino, not willing to be involved, fires Vagan for lying to him about Cappuccino being Killer Bean's target, only for Vagan to shoot him in retaliation. Killer Bean demands Vagan (who is revealed to be codenamed \"Dark Bean\") about why he betrayed the agency and stole its databases. Vagan tells him that the agency shifted to treating their members as guns for hire, prompting him to leave and work for Cappuccino to use his knowledge of the weapons market for his vigilantism. Killer Bean doesn't believe him and kills him, but not before Vagan tells him that the agency will now hunt him down as well. Cromwell, who witnessed the whole ordeal from afar, arrives with the entire police force. Killer Bean, who is now aware about the agency coming after him, lets himself get arrested, believing that the police can protect him from the agency.\n\nShortly after, Jet Bean arrives at the warehouse and learns from an officer that Killer Bean has been jailed. After assaulting an officer for being racist, he lets himself get arrested. When the police car arrives at the police department, he first knocks out the two officers accompanying him before killing the rest of the cops. As Jet Bean walks to Killer Bean's cell, Killer Bean tells him about the agency's corruption, to which Jet Bean tells him that he was brainwashed by Vagan, leading to a fight between the two. Eventually, Killer Bean shoots Jet Bean in the chest, fatally wounding him and tells Jet Bean that \"it's over\". Outside the entrance of the police station, Killer Bean calls the agency using Jet Bean's phone, informing them that the latter is dead. The voice then asks him to come so they can \"talk things over\". Killer Bean agrees, but also says that it \"won't be for talking\" before finding a police van full of weapons and driving off.\n\nCast\n\nVegas E. Trip as Killer Bean\n\nHe also voices the News Reporter, DJ Bean, and other bad beans.\n\nBryan Session as Detective Cromwell and Vagan\n\nMatthew Tyler as Cappuccino\n\nHe also voices a few bad beans and the Police Commander.\n\nDavid Guilmette as The Voice and Harry\n\nHe also voices the Bartender, a bad bean, the Mercenary Leader, the Police Dispatcher, and a police bean.\n\nJeff Lew as Jet Bean\n\nHe also voices several bad beans, Bing Bow, Chintow, and some police beans.\n\nProduction\n\nAfter Killer Bean 2: The Party, Jeff Lew decided to work on a next short called The Killer Bean 3, which would be 45 minutes long and sold in DVDs. However, Jeff decided that he wanted to make it a feature film and called it Killer Bean Forever. He also decided he would be previsualizing the scenes instead of storyboarding them, since it was easier and faster to do. Pre-production and animating the previz took a year and a half. Despite animating some of the scenes in previz, he forgot to create concept art of the characters before animating. So, he hired Von C. Caberte, an artist, to create concept art of the characters. Because of the character models being different from the concept art, Jeff had to remodel all of them, making the previz scenes not reusable for the final animation. He then posted an ad on Craigslist for voice actors and cast 4 after auditioning about 20 people.\n\nThe film took about 5 years to create, about year and a half for pre-production (and screenwriting), which was completed in July 2005. Previsualization took 9 months, and modeling and texturing took 6 months. The animation took 2 and a half years, having over 1000 shots, each rendered with a simulated physical camera. Motion capture was used to speed up animation, including lip syncing and camera movements.\n\nSoftware\n\nThe entire movie was animated in Autodesk Maya and edited in Sony Vegas. Feeling Software's Nima and AGEIA's PhysX were used for animating physics. Final Render was used to render the frames and Adobe Photoshop was used to process them. Special effects were done in Particle Illusion and Vue. Some of the movie's soundtrack, voice acting, and sound effects were made in Sony Acid Pro and Adobe Audition. Syntheyes was used for camera tracking. Seamless Texture Generator was used to generate some of the textures and Renderpal was used to manage render farms. Some of the motion capture data was provided by the CMU Computer Graphics Lab.\n\nInitially, the render farm used for rendering the movie had 3 dual-quad computers but was replaced with 4 quad-core computers later on. Each computer had 2 gigabytes of RAM. The GPU used for rendering was a NVIDIA GeForce 7300 GS.\n\nRelease\n\nOn September 5, 2008, the movie was screened to buyers at the Toronto International Film Festival after its rights were acquired by the Cinema Management Group.\n\nThe DVDs for the film were available to pre-order in the US and Canada, starting on April 30, 2009 and ending on July 10. On July 14, the DVDs were shipped to customers living in the US and Canada.\n\nIn May 2018, the entire film was uploaded to YouTube enhanced and upscaled to 4K. The film has obtained a cult following since then, and is now the most viewed video on Jeff's channel.\n\nReception\n\nOn IMDb, the movie was rated a 6.5 out of 10 as of 2023.\n\nMany people praised the movie for its low budget and how it was made by one person. Some did not like how the movie's plot or animation was too simple in some parts.\n\nIn June 2019, Charles White Jr., better known as MoistCr1TiKaL and penguinz0 online, watched the movie live on Twitch and uploaded a clip of it to YouTube, which led to the movie getting a surge in popularity. He called the movie an \"animated masterpiece\" and also said that if Jeff was to make another movie, he would be happy to have a role in it.\n\nGallery\n\nScreenshots\n\nTrivia\n\nThe opening of this movie reuses the plot from the Killer Bean 2: The Party, since both include a party being interrupted by Killer Bean, purely because he could not sleep.\n\nThe length of the remaster is about a minute less than the original because some parts of the movie and the end credits are sped up a bit, and part of the credits were removed for unknown reasons.\n\nBefore the series, it was assumed that he was driving to the Shadow Agency in the ending, but it was proven wrong when he arrived at Kessler's hideout in a police van.\n\nMany people consider this movie an inspiration for John Wick, mainly due to both characters sharing similarities such as their ruthlessness and their absurd murder reasons, as well as this movie preceding John Wick by six years.\n\nJeff Lew's YouTube username is the same as this movie's title.\n\nThe scene where the cop racially mocks Jet Bean became a meme.\n\nSee also\n\nTranscript\n\nPrevis Scenes\n\nDeleted Scenes\n\nAlternate Action Scenes"
