        "text": "üìå THE PAINTING I INHERITED HAS A LABEL ON THE BACK DECLARING ITS AUTHENTICITY, IS THIS ENOUGH TO SELL IT? Those who are familiar with the art market know that the phenomenon of artist's archives is fairly recent, because until a few decades ago, works were often 'authenticated' simply with a label on the back signed either by the artist or the gallerist. In the event of a sale, is this still valid or is it necessary to get a new one? A distinction must be made: if the label on the back of the work is issued directly by the artist, who is still alive, it may be sufficient. If, on the other hand, the author of the work is not alive, it may be necessary to apply to the relevant archive (beware, however, of DIY) ‚ùå. Let us dispel a myth: there is no definitive certification of the authorship of a work. Therefore, even independent art experts can confirm or disavow the authorship of a work of art, despite the claims of an archive. Did you know? #wealthmanagement #heritage #artmarket\n\nTechnology also had its impact on the arts, and the rise of computers brought about the field of digital art. So what are the different types of digital art? There are different types of digital painting, different types of algorithmic art, etc. While no one knows for sure how many different types of digital art there are, we are going to look at the 13 most common ones in this post!

Mark Strassmann reports on Dettmer's vision for a vanishing form of art.\" Two compelling things I found in this video are 1) Dettmer leaving certain words and phrases to add further meaning to his work and 2) the viewpoint of these books as sculpture. This goes back to another recurring theme: non-traditional materials and methods to produce art. A mere shift in thinking allows one to see these works as sculpture and not merely books. Challenge your students to do the same with other objects: What else can sculpture be made from? It will be intriguing to learn what they think of. What would you make? I encourage you to share your thoughts in the comments. #MuseumEducation #BookArt https://lnkd.in/g4eYuURq"
