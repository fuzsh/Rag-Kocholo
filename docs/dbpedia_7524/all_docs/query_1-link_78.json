        "text": "When Hayley Barker speaks of the painters who influence her own work, she names Hans Grundig, Jean-Édouard Vuillard, Charles Burchfield, Paul Gaugin. Men, all of them, because in art history as written until recently, almost every famous painter until the end of the 20th century is male.\n\nIn her own work, Barker emulates the profusion and surplus of these male painters who chose nature as their primary subject. Barker has a way, like they did, of filling up a canvas with so much beauty that it makes your chest hurt from the fullness of it. (Beauty can stuff you.) But Barker aims to be different as well. “I want to make the painting I haven’t seen,” she says.\n\nTraditional Western landscapes, Barker says, are linked to colonialism, the bourgeois, a luxury sensibility that sees nature as something that can, and should be, conquered. Much like an Instagram selfie, traditional landscape painting sees nature as a backdrop for human greatness.\n\nThe landscape painting Barker wants to create relates to femininity, an earth-based spirituality, the idea that humans are not separate from nature, but instead, part of it. “I believe we come from the earth, and the earth is our home and our protector,” Barker says.\n\nIn “The Grass is Blue,” a series of paintings by Barker on view at SHRINE gallery through December 5, nature is captured in colors that never appear in nature. Ferns are cobalt blue, poplars are deep purple, rivers run blue, red and marigold. The effect is somewhat holy. You look at the paintings and understand how, in pre-industrial times, people stood in nature, and experienced God. The unreality of the paintings, which nonetheless clearly reference the Earth, also belie exploitation.\n\nMany of the paintings were made during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when Barker was in isolation at her home in Los Angeles. Front Yard at Dusk with Visitor (2020) shows a garden in gold, lavender and sea green tones cut in the center by a pathway. At the end of the pathway stands a human figure, almost ape-like in shades of brown, wearing a mask, and holding the leash of a dog. At the very beginning of the pathway, a pair of manicured feet sticks out. “I was thinking of the bridge between the private and public spaces during the pandemic,” Barker says. The figure could be benevolent, but she also might not be. How easily she might traverse that pathway, and stay in the profusion of beauty, whether the viewer, represented by those feet, wants her to or not.\n\nBarriers abound in the paintings. In End of Day (2020), a wall separates a field of sunflowers from a mountain range.\n\nIn Huddle (2020), a portal, outlined in blue, distorts the perception of space in a copse of trees.\n\nIn Mourning (2020), a bramble of bushes and trees painted in twilight shades of pink and purple surround a central female character, forming a sort of womb.\n\n“The experience of trauma and illness have informed the way I experience life, and other kinds of life,” Barker says.\n\nNot all of the paintings are landscape. In Still Angry (2020), Barker paints herself. The portrait has aspects of the Weimar era. The bobbed hairstyle, draped clothing and direct gaze of the subject recall the portraits of the Dadaist Christian Schad. Barker’s subject — herself — almost looks as though she’s been sitting for the portrait since the 1920s, and she’s getting pissed that she’s still waiting. Her eyes are drooping. Her mouth is pursed. “As much as I care about the beauty and the healing power of the earth, I also wanted to acknowledge the frustration and sadness and anger that is felt right now in terms of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement,” she says. “It’s a huge collective loss, and I needed the outrage to punctuate my work.”\n\nTo learn more about Barker, visit her website."
