Through video/sound installation, performance, writing, and prints/publishing, she interferes with daily life situations, de-/reconstructs existing objects and found images, digging into their contexts, uses lightness to touch on the visible and invisible boundaries shaped by language, culture, identities and collective memories. Her works are a series of translations, transformations and transpositions based on the transcultural context, leading to reflections on the western cultural hegemony and its profound influence in today's global especially East Asian societies.\n\nEnglishâ†’\n\nEnglishâ†’\n\nJenny Irene Miller\n\nInupiaq, SitÅ‹asuaq â€“ Nome, Alaska, United States\n\nJENNY IRENE MILLER b. 1988; currently based in Dena'ina EÅ‚nena â€“ Anchorage, Alaska.\n\nJenny Irene Miller (she/her, they/them), Inupiaq, is an artist who works primarily with photography. She is originally from Nome, Alaska. Jenny holds an MFA in Art Studio, Photography, from the University of New Mexico, a BFA in Photomedia, and a BA in American Indian Studies, both from the University of Washington. She is a past Beaumont Newhall/Van Deren Coke Photography Fellow, SITE Santa Fe Scholar, Elizabeth Furber Fellow, and Fulbright Canada Killam Fellow.\n\nHer work has been exhibited nationally at the Anchorage Museum, Portland Art Museum, SITE Santa Fe, Penumbra Foundation, Southampton Arts Center, Turchin Center for the Visual Arts, and more. She has also exhibited internationally at the Winnipeg Art Gallery in Canada and at the Incheon Open Port in South Korea, to name a few.

Each piece investigates the fluidity of languageâ€”how, like water, language fills its container. And how we, as the keepers of language, cannot help but contextualize it through our physical experiences, even despite the ostensibly disembodied act of being online.\n\nEnglishâ†’\n\nEnglishâ†’\n\nElizabeth Withstandley\n\nElizabeth Withstandley is a research-based video installation artist that focuses on individuals and communities. She works by experimentation, research and data collection to create conceptually driven projects. Her work is rooted in conceptual art, taking the form of multi-channel video installations that explore contemporary culture through a loose narrative structure. The works question individuality, personal identity, morality, and purpose of life, while presenting a portrait of a person, a group of people, a specific culture or location.\n\nShe is from Cape Cod, Massachusetts and currently lives and works in Los Angeles, CA. She is one of the co-founders of Locust Projects, a not-for-profit art exhibition space, in Miami, FL and Prospect Art a not-for-profit in Los Angeles, CA.

Mekondjo was shortlisted for the Norval Sovereign Africa art prize 2022/2023. Tuli Mekondjo works with mixed media including embroidery, photo transfer, resin and mahangu ( millet) grain- a Namibian food staple. Drawing on colonial and war-time photographic archives, Mekondjoâ€™s practice explores Namibian history and identity politics.\n\nDrawing on histories of change, loss and submission- particularly when it comes to women- she stitches between past and present. She pays homage to her forebears, fertility and continuity, whist commenting on gendered struggle, intergenerational trauma, and displacement. In many resent work, the artist positions herself in dialogue with her ancestors, directly acknowledging their pain, whilst referencing multiple African folklore traditions. Spirituality is an increasingly important element in her work, and Mekondjo extends her textured media into performance.\n\nMekondjo has exhibited in multiple exhibitions and fairs, including museum shows, in Namibia, South Africa, Germany, Cote dâ€™Ivoire, France , USA, Hong Kong, UK, Belgium and Portugal. Her works are held in multiple international collections.\n\nEnglishâ†’\n\nEnglishâ†’\n\nNnenna Onuoha\n\nNnenna Onuoha is a Ghanaian-Nigerian researcher, filmmaker and artist based in Berlin, Germany. Her films and videos centre Afrodiasporic voices to explore monumental silences surrounding the histories and afterlives of colonialism across West Africa, Europe and the US, asking: how do we remember, which pasts do we choose to perform and why? A second strand of her work focuses on archiving Black experience in the present to chronicle how, amidst all this, we practice care and repair for ourselves and each other. Her work has shown at the Galerie im Turm, the Kunsverein Hamburg, the BrÃ¼ckemuseum, the KW Institute for Contemporary Art, the Galerie im KÃ¶rnerpark and alpha nova and galerie futura. Nnenna is currently a doctoral researcher in Media Anthropology at Harvard University and Global History at the University of Potsdam.

She has been a recipient of grants from the National Fund for Culture and the Arts, Mexico, and in 2023 she received a grant for artists over 45 years old from the Kunststiftung K52 (Art Foundation K52) in Germany.\n\nInvestigating language and its possibilities of translation and transference, as well as proposing new alliances between word and image, constitute the compass and guiding thread of her artistic research. Rather than exploring a medium of expression, she focuses on concepts around an event and approaches it from different perspectives and strategies, creating independent and interconnected works, primarily drawings, objects, artist books, videos, and installations.\n\nEspaÃ±olâ†’\n\nEnglishâ†’\n\nEnglishâ†’\n\nJeanno Gaussi\n\nBorn in Kabul, Afghanistan, and grew up across Kabul, Delhi, and Berlin.\n\nUsing a narrative concept as a starting point, Jeanno Gaussi creates intimate installations about space and memory. Her work crosses a variety of media, including video, photography, objects, and texts.\n\nA central theme of her practice is the exploration of the places where she has worked, traveled, and experienced meaningful encounters. Through these encounters, her work engages questions of remembrance, the search for identity, and the social and cultural processes associated with them.\n\nHer work engages with mechanisms of remembrance, the search for identity, and the social and cultural processes associated with them.\n\nShe developed many of her installation projects during residencies in Pakistan (International Diasporic Artists Residency Karachi), Jordan (International Artist Workshop Shatana), Turkey, and Palestine (Al-Mamal Art Residency, Jerusalem) among others.\n\nGaussi has participated in numerous exhibitions, film festivals, and symposia, including the dOCUMENTA 13, the Havana Biennale, and TEDx Marrakesh.\n\nShe is a fellow at the KaÌˆte Hamburger Research Centre in Munich and received the Ann Wolff Foundation Scholarship 2023.\n\nJeanno Gaussi currently lives and works in Berlin and Munich, Germany.\n\nEnglishâ†’\n\nEnglishâ†’\n\nKatharina Schnitzler\n\nKatharina Schnitzler, born in DÃ¼sseldorf in 1963, is a Berlin-based artist and educator. She obtained a Master of Arts degree from UdK Berlin (1999-2003) and prior to that, she completed a diploma in Art Therapy and Pedagogy from FH Ottersberg (1995-1999).\n\nIn 2023, Katharina Schnitzler participated in several solo exhibitions including \"LUFTHOLEN\" at Kunsthaus Potsdam with Ev Pommer, \"INNEHALTEN\" at Mianki.Gallery with Ev Pommer, and \"AUF WUNDER WARTEN\" at Alte Feuerwache Berlin with Ev Pommer.

Additionally, she showcased her work at \"artKARLSRUHE\" at mianki.Gallery.\n\nKatharina Schnitzler observes, uncovers and questions assumed realities.\n\nIn her work, she overlays textures, layers of color, and text, and processes fabrics and newspaper photos. Often the background consists of countless layers. As the brushstroke is visible and pulled in different directions, structures, and patterns emerge. In doing so, Schnitzler emphasizes the materiality of her works, as the structures are reminiscent of cut-outs of fabric panels or embossed ornamental wallpaper. Often a sense of space is created. Although the background and foreground could each stand on their own, they communicate and harmonize with each other, depth of color meets abstract formal language. The essence of her work is the exploration of the \"in-between\". Paintings and drawings are created - installed, poetic, deep, witty, tightly interwoven, and at the same time brutal and beautiful.\n\nEnglishâ†’\n\nEnglishâ†’"
