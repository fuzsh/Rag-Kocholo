        "text": "This publication offers insights into the lively arts scene during the interwar period, ranging from post-impressionism via abstraction and expressionism to the mixed forms characteristic of that time, with works by Jules Schmalzigaug, Marthe Donas, Oscar and Floris Jespers, Edmond Van Dooren, Jozef Peeters, Felix De Boeck, Jan Kiemeneij, Jos Leonard, Paul Joostens, Prosper De Troyer, Marcel-Louis Baugniet and Ossip Zadkine. In addition to two introductory essays, a sequential analysis of individual works maps out a reconstruction of this ‘forgotten’ period in Belgian art history.1925 serves as the pivotal point in the pursuit of a purely visual language, after which the various developments that had resulted in abstract art began to surface in new mutated forms. It is within that context, supported by new research, that this selection from the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp collection is reassessing the significance of this period.\n\nIn early 1920, German art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler wrote from his exile in Switzerland to Pablo Picasso about his forthcoming book on Cubism, scheduled for publication in Germany that year, as well as his plans for a monograph on the artist himself. Six years later, Kahnweiler wrote again, this time to Carl Einstein, to congratulate him on his book \"The Art of the 20th Century.\" For Kahnweiler, Einstein had succeeded in publishing the “definitive” study on the art of their time, including Cubism and Picasso’s contributions to it. Kahnweiler’s and Einstein’s writings—considered today as seminal to Cubist theory and Picasso’s rise—bracket an intense yet under-acknowledged period that witnessed a remarkable proliferation of German-language publications devoted to both subjects. Taken together these texts constitute a form of “hypermediation” rooted in a renewed intellectual engagement with Cubism and Picasso in German-speaking Europe after World War I. Analyzing the mechanisms of transmission and the cultural diplomacy underlying this reconsideration, this paper illustrates the breadth of these contributions to the theorization of Cubism and Picasso, as well as demonstrates that this second, postwar reception of both followed a decidedly different path in Central and Eastern Europe than in France. An earlier version of this paper was presented during the Internationales Nachwuchskolloquium Frankreich-Deutschland / Colloque international de jeunes chercheurs France - Allemagne at the at the Deutsches Forum für Kunstgeschichte (DFK) and the Institut national d'histoire de l'art (INHA), Paris, on 9-11 January 2019."
