        "text": "Art probably isn’t the first thing most of us associate with the Cold War. Maybe heated political diatribe and tanks on parade, but generally not evocative canvases, video, photography and other media. But in Germany, the period between the end of WWII in 1945, and the falling of the Berlin wall 20 years ago, in 1989, was a fertile period for the imagination of artists on both sides of the Brandenberg Gate. Two very different political systems: democratic capitalism in the West and Soviet-style communism in the East, produced dramatically different conditions and influences for artists in both countries. Painting, sculpture, video, photography, performance art and exhibitions were rendered to both reflect and oppose the systems the artists lived in.\n\nThe show, now on view at LACMA until April 19, examines the period’s disparate parts with the concise eye of a skillful documentary, and is the first special exhibition to be mounted at the new Renzo Piano-designed Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM). An added bonus is museum-goers get to experience the show before it travels to Germany, where it will debut this October in Berlin."
