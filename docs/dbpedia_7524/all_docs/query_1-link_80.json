        "text": "This summer, Tate Modern is exploring the art of the Weimar Republic (1919-33) in a year-long, free display, drawing upon the rich holdings of The George Economou Collection. This presentation of around seventy paintings and works on paper addresses the complex paradoxes of the Weimar era, in which liberalisation and anti-militarism flourished in tandem with political and economic uncertainty. These loans offer a rare opportunity to view a range of artworks not ordinarily on public display – some of which have never been seen in the United Kingdom before – and to see a selection of key Tate works returned to the context in which they were originally created and exhibited nearly one hundred years ago.\n\nAlthough the term ‘magic realism’ is today commonly associated with the literature of Latin America, it was inherited from the artist and critic Franz Roh who invented it in 1925 to describe a shift from the anxious and emotional art of the expressionist era, towards the cold veracity and unsettling imagery of this inter-war period. In the context of growing political extremism, this new realism reflected a more liberal society as well as inner worlds of emotion and magic.\n\nThe profound social and political disarray after the First World War and the collapse of the Empire largely brought about this stylistic shift. Berlin in particular attracted a reputation for moral depravity and decadence in the context of the economic collapse. The reconfiguration of urban life was an important aspect of the Weimar moment. Alongside exploring how artists responded to social spaces and the studio, entertainment sites like the cabaret and the circus are highlighted, including a display of Otto Dix’s enigmatic Zirkus (‘Circus’) print portfolio. Artists recognised the power in representing these realms of public fantasy and places where outsiders were welcomed.\n\nWorks by Otto Dix, George Grosz and Max Beckmann perhaps best known today for their unsettling depictions of Weimar life, are presented alongside the works of under recognised artists such as Albert Birkle, Jeanne Mammen and Rudolf Schlichter, and many others whose careers were curtailed by the end of the Weimar period due to the rise of Nationalist Socialism and its agenda to promote art that celebrated its political ideologies.\n\nThe full list of artists in the display includes: Max Beckmann, Richard Biringer, Albert Birkle, Heinrich Campendonk, Marc Chagall, Lovis Corinth, Heinrich Maria Davringhausen, Harry Heinrich Deierling, Rudolf Dischinger, Otto Dix, Josef Eberz, Conrad Felixmüller, Otto Griebel, Carl Grossberg, George Grosz, Hans Grundig, Lea Grundig, Herbert Gurschner, August Heimüller, Karl Otto Hy, Alexander Kanoldt, Paul Klee, Jeanne Mammen, Josef Mangold, Carlo Mense, Richard Müller, Sergius Pauser, Christian Schad, Otto Rudolf Schatz, Rudolf Schlichter, Werner Schramm, Prosper de Troyer, Marie-Louise von Motesiczky and Nicolai Wassilieff.\n\nFor more information or to book tickets, visit the Tate Modern website here\n\nLondon Visitors is the official blog for the Visiting London Guide .com website.

It features works by some of the greatest artists working from the late 14th century to the present including Rogier van der Weyden, Petrus Christus, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Elder, Lucas van Leyden, Rembrandt, Edward Burne-Jones, William Holman Hunt, Otto Dix, Jasper Johns and Bruce Nauman. Many of the works are drawn from the British Museum’s extensive collection of metalpoint drawings alongside major loans from European and American museums as well as private collections, including four sheets by Leonardo da Vinci from the Royal Collection.\n\nAt the beginning at the exhibition is a video which shows the metalpoint process in detail, metalpoint is a drawing technique which developed from medieval manuscripts where the artist uses a metal stylus, usually made of silver, on a specially prepared sheet which leaves traces of the metal on the surface, resulting in a visible drawing. The fine point allows for precise lines so that detailed drawings can be achieved. However, the process is time-consuming and leaves little room for error.\n\nThe technique was at its most popular during the early Renaissance, In Italy it was used to train artists in preparation of making pictures. Drawings by Filippo Lippi, Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci show their mastery of the technique producing work of exquisite refinement.\n\nIn northern Europe, early artists used metalpoint mainly for portraits , works by Petrus Christus, Rogier van der Weyden and especially Hans Holbein illustrate a high level of sophistication. Another master of the technique was Albrecht Durer whose drawings are some of the highlights of the exhibition.\n\nBy the 16th and 17th century, the technique was in decline but was still used by Dutch artists in preparation for small portrait engravings. Works by Goltzuis and de Gheyn are on display together with drawings by Rembrandt.\n\nThe 19th century saw a revival of interest in Renaissance art techniques in Britain led by William Holman Hunt and Alphonse Legros, metalpoint drawings were produced that encouraged later painters to use the technique. In the 20th century, Otto Dix began to experiment with the process and more recently Jasper Johns and Bruce Nauman have used metalpoint for more abstract drawings.\n\nThis fascinating exhibition is one where the close examination of the drawings is necessary to really appreciate the incredible skill of artists to master a difficult, unforgiving technique. The rare bringing together of a large number of metalpoint drawings is a unique opportunity to consider the importance of this particular technique in the history of art.\n\nVisiting London Guide Rating – Highly Recommended\n\nFor more information or to book tickets, visit the British Museum website here\n\nExhibition runs from 10 September to 6 December 2015\n\nTickets\n\nAdults £8, under 16s free\n\nOpening times\n\nMonday–Thursday 10.00–17.30\n\nFriday 10.00–20.30\n\nSaturday–Sunday 10.00–17.30\n\nLondon Visitors is the official blog for the Visiting London Guide .com website.
