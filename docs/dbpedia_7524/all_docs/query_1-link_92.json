To this end, the nature of Neue Sachlichkeit is briefly addressed in the context of the National Socialist art that was to follow it. ‘Inner emigration’ is also discussed, before turning to the work of Otto Dix. Three of his paintings are explored, in order to establish the extent to which, first, Neue Sachlichkeit continued in his work into the Nazi period, and secondly, the degree to which he expressed his opposition to the National Socialist regime during his personal ‘inner emigration’.",
