Grundig (1901 - 1958) was a German artist who joined the Communist Party in 1926. Under the Nazis he was arrested multiple times and ultimately was sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp between 1940 - 44. Amazingly he survived.

After the war he became an art professor in the German Democratic Republic. This was one of his last major works.
