Hans Grundig

Hans Grundig was a German artist of the first half of the twentieth century. He is known as a painter, graphic artist and teacher, professor and rector of the High School of Fine Arts in Dresden, and husband of the artist Lea Grundig.

Grundig produced works that stylistically belong to the "new materiality" and revolutionary-proletarian realism. In 1932 he visited the USSR, where he participated in the exhibition "Revolutionary Art in Capitalist Countries" in Moscow. His art during this period was strongly anti-fascist, the works were created in a realistic-expressive style. After the Nazis came to power, he was banned from painting and his works were recognized as "degenerate art". The artist was arrested and sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp.

Grundig's paintings today are an important part of the golden fund of realist art in twentieth-century Germany.
