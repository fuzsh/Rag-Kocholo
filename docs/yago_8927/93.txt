Directed by Carlos Atanes

With the cast and crew of PROXIMA

Music by Carlos Atanes

There are filmings as exciting as the movies that they generate. To make totally independent movies is always an adventure, but if in top of that what is shooted is something of the ambition and dimensions of PROXIMA, an underground blockbuster directed by Carlos Atanes, the risks and the anecdotes multiply. This documentary follows the shooting from Riotinto's mines in Huelva (with collapses, red acid lakes and electromagnetic anomalies) to the lands of Lleida's dryness, where there happen improbable but real events, as the actor shooting with shotgun.
